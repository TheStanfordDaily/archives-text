# FEATURES
## Formal dining options off the Farm 
### JAMES R DICKEY Editorial staff 
This week's selection of restau
rants features sure-fire winners in
the category of places to go before
formals. Each of the following
eateries has good food, a comfort
able atmosphere and moderate
prices.
British Bankers' Club
Walk into this establishment,
and you've walked into the past.
Old English atmosphere per
meates the air. Thick wooden fur
nishings complemented by leather
furniture and stained glass create
a unique environment for dining.
The dining area is upstairs,
separated from the bar and lounge
by plush red curtains — mating a
semblance of privacy with a sense
of participation in the activity
going on below.
The dining area itself is quite
pleasant, featuring thick, com
fortable chairs, bookcases and
plush carpeting.
Dinner began with a cognac and
truffle pate for myself and onion
soup for my date. The pate was ex
cellent, covered with grated egg,
olives and sliced sweet pickles.
The onion soup was unbelievably
thick, hiding a slice of french
bread and covered by mounds of
melted cheese.
Our wine selection, Domaine
Laurier Sauvignon Blanc, was rec
ommended by the waiter who is as
worthy of mention as the wine.

Both were perfectly aged and any
thing but overbearing.
The house salads with
vinaigrette and bleu cheese were
perfect complements to the meals
to come. My selection of veal nor
mandie, a generous portion of veal
strips covered with apple slices
and an unbelievable cream and
white wine sauce, was perfectly
complemented by the rice, carrots
and broccoli side dishes.
My friend's selection of the fresh
salmon proved equally foolproof.
Joined by portions of carrots,
potatoes and broccoli, the fresh
salmon wrapped in spinach and
covered with a pastry shell was
more than a match for any mere
human's appetite.
With the entrees, the fun had
just begun. From the wide variety
of dessert offerings, we chose a
Grand Marnier truffle in cream
sauce and a chocolate torte,
respectively.
These confections made In
heaven are not for the meek or full
of stomach. No indeed, these are

for the hearty of appetite and
brave of spirit. Being a chocolate
lover, 1 heartily dug in to what
proved to be my undoing, the
torte. A wall of chocolate to end all
such walls, the rich and delicious
concoction proved the better of
me.
The Grand Marnier truffle was
no less delicious. Swimming in a
rich cream that also contained
Grand Marnier and orange slices,
this delicacy begged to be appreci
ated. It was.
The British Bankers Club is lo
cated on El Camino Real in Menlo
Park and is a perfect place for
couples or small groups to enjoy
delicious pre-formal dining.
Mac Arthur Park
This Stanford favorite has for
quite a while enjoyed the favor of
the party-going crowd. The
familiar barn-like building near
campus has a great reputation as
a nice place to dine or take one's
visiting parents.
Having eaten at "The Park"
before several screw-your
roommate parties I must confess
that I was not completely thrilled
with the establishment on this
visit.
Mac Park is perfect for the less
adventurous diner, preparing its
famous ribs or traditional
favorites such as trout or salmon
with the skill those dishes
deserve.
On this visit to Mac Park. 1
decided adventure was called for,
and therefore was disappointed.

Starting with a very dependable
dish, the onion strings, there were
very few surprises. The strings
were thin and crispy without
being overdone, but were as
greasy as one must expect with
fried food.
My first experiment was whole
smoked quail with vegetable slaw
and smoked trout salad as ap
petizers. The quail was too dry
and the slaw's sauce overpowered
what flavor there was. The trout
salad was too sharply seasoned to
enjoy.
Regaining sense during the
entree selection. I enjoyed the half
slab of ribs with french fries and
cole slaw and my friend dined hap
pily on chicken with squash, red
peppers and potatoes. The ribs
were delicious and the sauce
deserved its reputation. The
chicken was only slightly dry and
the portions were respectable.
The desserts were good, with
New York style cheesecake for my
guest and a mixed, fresh berry
shortcake for myself.
The cheesecake, served dry, was
creamy and the crust was perfectly
crumbly. The berry shortcake had
generous portions of berries and
cream but was crunchy and not
the soft, poundcake confection I
expected. It was, however, deli
cious.
Mac Arthur Park, because of its
reputation and sure-fire winners
— like its ribs — is a good place to
go before a formal. Just be sure to
stick to the usual items — don't
experiment.

The Gatehouse Restaurant
This was my first experience
with this gem of a restaurant but
it certainly won't be my last.
Quick service from our waiter,
who's been with the Gatehouse for
10 years and shows it by his
knowledge of the wines and food,
started us right in on the ap
petizers.
I had the good fortune to try the
prawns in Bordelaise sauce, a per
fectly wonderful way to start off
any meal. The sauce contained a
little too much lemon juice, but
was excellent nonetheless.
My guest had the onion soup,
which is not done justice by the
title. The soup was spiced per
fectly. full of French bread and
covered with just the right
amount of mozzarella.
We picked a Vichon '84 Chevrig
non from Napa Valley to comple
ment our choices of Chicken
Jerusalem and noisette d'agneau.
Our meals came with the house
salad with vinaigrette, with just
the right amount of egg and
tomato to enjoy the spices abun
dant in the vinaigrette. The
chicken was tender enough to defy
anyone daring to describe it as
mere meat. The artichoke hearts,
sauce and sides of zucchini,
potatoes and carrot sticks set the
meal off well.
The noisette was an artistic ar
rangement of lamb covered by
maitre de' butter and mushroom
caps. The lamb was juicy enough
to — yes — literally melt in your
mouth.

The portions of the main
courses were slightly smaller here
than at the other restaurants
reviewed, but the side dish por
tions more than compensated.
Before dinner we were asked if
we would like to enjoy one of the
specialties of the house for des
sert. the Grand Marnier Souffle
for two. Luckily, we accepted.
The confection is a perfectly

done souffle with just a hint of
Grand Marnier to tickle the taste
buds. The waiter adorns the
souffle with freshly whipped
cream at the table just before serv
ing. The result is a perfectly timed
delight to top off any meal.
The Gatehouse is not lacking in
atmosphere, either. At the front is
an inviting bar with a lounge area
on one side. The furnishings are
elegant without being preten
tious.
In addition, during spring and
summer seasons, the patron has
the opportunity to dine on tables
set up in an elegant outdoor patio.
It is an experience not to be
missed.
Any one of these restaurants
would be an excellent way to start
off an elegant evening.
