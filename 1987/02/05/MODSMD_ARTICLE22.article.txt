# Managing a weekend at the beach with SOS
## 
### BRYAN COOPERRIDER 
Stanford students love to get away on weekends.
And this weekend representatives of campus student
groups will be getting away to the surf and sand to
receive pointers on how to effectively manage their
organizations.
These students will be flocking to the "Great Con
nection Retreat" sponsored by Student Organiza
tional Services (SOS).
SOS, located on the second floor of Tresidder,
helps to facilitate organization activities. More than
300 organizations are registered with SOS, and all of
them are voluntary and student-run. There is a
resource center so that groups can make posters and
fliers. Information is given, ranging from advice on
how to establish organizations to suggestions for
funding.
SOS tells you "where to go for what, why and how,"
according to Nancy Noelke, the educational pro
grams coordinator.
SOS runs workshops for students involved in plan

ning big events. Last fall, SOS held a workshops on
leadership and getting funds from off-campus
sources.
And on Feb. 6 and 7, SOS will be hosting its first
overnight workshop, entitled "The Great Connection
Retreat."
The retreat is geared toward connecting student
organizations that plan major events. Noelke is head
of the planning committee for the retreat.
"I think it's important that organizations connect
with each other; they need more communication,"
she said. v.
The Montara Lighthouse Youth Hostel, which is lo
cated on the beach just north of Half Moon Bay. is
the site of the SOS retreat. Representatives from
groups like the Gay and Lesbian Alliance, MEChA
and Ram's Head will attend.
But Noelke said the retreat is "mainly targeted
toward up and coming planners — those who haven't
yet been involved in planning any big events."

The agenda is loaded with activities directed
toward effectively and successfully planning events.
After some "getting to know each other" activities,
Friday evening will be spent in groups of five or six
people that will look at their present organizational
skills and roles in the planning process. The evening
will end with presentations by students who have
planned major events. They will discuss their pitfalls
and successes.
Industrial Engineering Profs. Dennis Boyle and
Gayle Curtis will talk Saturday morning on decision
making, problem solving and brainstorming. %
The "meat of the retreat", according to Noelke, is
the simulation planning game. The students will be
involved in planning a fictional event. The planning
involves setting goals, getting funding, advertising
andestablishing contacts.
"There's a myriad of problems they can run into," 1
Noelke said. "We want them to find creative solutions 1
to problems. We also want them to come out of the '>

activity realizing that such groups as SOS and the
departments in the ASSU are here to help them
facilitate and plan their events, not to make things
difficult."
The final event is a round-table discussion with
general questions and answers directed at the
"pivotal" people in planning events. Bill Cleveland
from Events and Services, Bob Berg from Risk Man
agement, Robin Miller from the ASSU Program
Board and Michael Ramsey-Perez from SOS will all be
there answering, questions concerning planning an
' event. Of cdurse, there is-a little free time for the par
ticipants to take a dip in the ocean waves, jog on the
beach or just hang out.
So what's the end result? Noelke hopes the retreat
will "familiarize students with event-planning
processes at Stanford — where to go, who to talk to,
what forms to fill out and also allow the partici
pants to make personal contacts with pivotal people
as well as other student organizations."
