## Winter One Acts mix fantasy and reality 
### JAMES R. DICKEY Editorial staff 
Last night saw the opening of
this years' presentation of the
Original Winter One Acts. The
production, sponsored by Ram's
Head, features three original one
act plays written by Stanford stu
dents. The plays, each complete In
Itself, are molded Into an Integrat
ed whole by the producers, Kristin
Ahlgren and Jill Yonas.

"The rehearsals for each play
were held separately, but we (the
producers), really are trying to
make It one coherent experience,"
Yonas said.
For the most part, Ahlgren and
Yonas succeed admirably.
The first act — "Christmas Pres
ence" by Cooley Windsor — reveals
a myriad of disagreements and
conflicts occurring in a woman's
home on Christmas Eve. The

scene begins with the seduction of
Santa Claus, and ends with the
seduction of the audience by the
Intense animosity present be
tween such seemingly normal
people.
The mother Midge. (Jennifer Ar
nold). Is extravagant indeed. From
her requests for anything but the
usual Christmas presents to her
dealings with her daughter Sara
(Sara Kauffman). she shows her
unique character and style. Ar-

nold does a tremendous job
playing this desirable, con
temptible and completely unusual
mother.
As Sara. Kauffman wonderfully
offsets Arnolds' performance. She
displays a variety of completely
believable emotions, eliciting
suspicion and contempt from the
audience while at the same time
earning compassion.
Al. a department store Santa

Claus who Is picked up by Midge,
is played artfully by John
Johnston. Accent aside, he
presents the perfect picture of the
starving actor who will do most
anything for his big break. Still,
he comes off as the — almost — in
nocent one in this play.
The other poor beguiled man in
the work is Henrik. played
stereotypically by Fred Harris,
who does a masterful job of being
pallid and completely naive. He is
the perfect abused husband and
entirely a victim.
Somehow, however, the women
in the play who better capture the
audience's emotions and sym
pathies.
The next act, "Tales from a
Game'' by Peter Gruenbaum, is an
interesting and revealing look into
human relations.
The act features John Bartunek
as Matt and Jim Farrell as
Thunder. The scene is a simple
game of poker, only instead of
simply winning money, the
players compete for stories.
Through this medium. Gruen
baum reveals the pasts of the two
men and the true qualities of their
emotions.
Bartunek. John-Boy-like in
looks and character, is the
originator of the poker-for-truth
idea. He innocently reveals his
heart in a story which is of a truly
important nature to him. Farrell,
with excellent timing and expres
sion, is a master of humor and
gall. He makes unbelievable situa
tions real and brings a sense of
surrealism to humdrum activi
