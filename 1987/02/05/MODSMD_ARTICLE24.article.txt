XTC: "Skylarking"
Ollie's Folly, Ollie's Folly, Ollie's
Folly, Ollie's Folly, Ollie's
After their last and most disap
pointing LP, "Big Express," and a
vow never to tour again, many of
us had relegated XTC to a
memorable past. But with their
rollicking EP posing as "The
Dukes of the Stratosphear" and
"Skylarking," their latest album,
produced by Todd Rundgren and
recorded in San Francisco, they
have recaptured their status as
the kings of quirk-rock. Easily the
best thing Todd Rundgren has
ever done, the album is a melodic,
poppish and light return to songs
in the style of The Beatles' "Sgt.
Pepper." They've cut back on the
heavy, synthesized beat of
"Express" and picked up more
acoustic Instruments and some
strings, sounding almost folkish
or colonial.
Their lyrics are at times roman
tic in the style of Wordsworth, and
at other times humorous and
witty. Lead singer Andy Partridge
sounds as if he's a simple Dutch
farmboy singing about the trials
of harvests arid seasons, but the
words are about subsistence
living by working-class laborers,
against Star Wars, about greed
and love and also about the
change of seasons. There's even a
tongue-in-cheek medieval-style
sacrificial bonfire thrown in ("So
men pull back hoods and smile/
The scapegoat blood spilled/

Splttled and grilled it cracked and
spat/ And children grew fat on the
meat"). As always. Partridge has a
quirky, childlike voice, and a great
knack for writing a melody. We'd
give this album a five if we had the
guts, but we figured people would
dismiss that as a reviewer trying
to show off how he likes obscure
bands, so we gave it half a rating
less hoping you readers would
admire our restraint.
Crowded House: "Crowded
House"

Everyone who listens to music
seriously has, at one time or an
other, a pet band — the more
obscure, the better. Your relation
ship wih the band is more serious
and personal than it would be
with a well-known band because
you have an egoistic feeling of
having discovered what you think
is the unique privilege of enjoying
their music. You beg DJ's to
pleeea.se enlighten the local
populace with that one song,
hoping to shatter that petrifica
tion of tastes that produces the
constant barrage of REOStyx-
JourneySpeedJoviWagon. Your
song gets played at 3 a.m., and
you go to bed. satisfied that you've
done everyone a great service.
For one of us, a few years ago.
that band was the Split Enz. The
Enz had a certain sound that was
clearly different; it was neither
American nor British, but created
a niche of its own. The band intro

duced an Australian sound to the
United States that helped pave the
way for bands like Midnight Oil
and INXS. As is the case with most
bands of this type, fate was bit
tersweet. The band never received
the popularity it deserved, but it
never sold its soul to the Devil of
Silly Pop Music while trying,
either. After about 10 years and
eight albums of effort, they
decided to give it up. Their only

U.S. hit was the omnipresent "I
Got You." a taste of success inca
pable of satisfying a band which
enjoyed several Number One
records in Australia and in its
original home of New Zealand.
Naturally enough, the two
brothers who did most of the
songwrlting for the band weren't
through. Tim Finn went on to
record a solo album, "Escapade,"
in which (you guessed it) he may
or may not have sold his soul to
the aforementioned devil. It was a

ludgment call. Neil Finn waited a
bit and formed Crowded House.
As usual in this situation, the
shadow of past accomplishment
looms large. Did he follow his
brother or didn't he? 1 refer to Neil
F. rather than to the band as a
whole because he does almost all
the songwrlting. The album is
clearly an attempt to bridge the
musical and lyrical gap between
the Enz and commercial accep-

tability. Fortunately, Crowded
House retains the identifying
marks of the style which distin
guished its predecessor. Two of
the songs. "Love You 'Til the Day I
Die" and "Hole in the River," are
eerily similar (the latter was co
written with Eddie Rayner, who
played keyboards for the Enz). The
rest of the album does an admira
ble job with a tricky situation. The
tunes make you smile and tap
your foot on first audition, but
retain the subtle hints which, to

quote Yogi Berra, make it seem
like "deja vu all over again." This
time around, the emphasis is
clearly on accessibility, which
means that you won't feel like
throwing the LP away in frustra
tion after one listen. The sharp po
litical and psychological messages
of old have faded, but are still
available to those who listen care
fully or read the lyric sheet.
Mixed feelings? Don't let a
diehard Split Enz fan scare you
off. This album has merit that is
easily appreciated. Call the Zoo
and request some Crow Hou and
find out for yourself.
Various artists: "Something
Wild" (Soundtrack)
The Dumb Thing. The Dumb
Thing, The Dumb Thing. The
Dumb Thing
Writing a review of a movie
soundtrack is always a great cop
out for us record reviewers, be
cause we don't have to go com
pletely into the history and style of
a single artist and come up with a
whole buncha pithy hyphenated
phrases to describe precisely what
kind of music the band stands for.
Nope, you can just pick out the
songs you like and mention them
by name, and maybe make fun of
loser bands trying to get their big
break on the record. Really,
anyone could do it. In fact, anyone
could do this whole job. It's easy.
The main thing is to keep the ac
tual record you're reviewing sorta
in the back of your mind while you
come up with non sequitur intros,
comical nicknames, hyphenated
slang, commie-bashing tirades
and new ways to end sentences

with prepositions. Also, pretend
that you're the only person In the
world who has any kind of taste or
knows anything about music, and
that your opinion will be widely
treasured and responsible for the
life or death of any new release.
Practice run-ons and sentence
fragments. Laugh at your own
jokes.
Well, anyway, this here
soundtrack is not bad, as
soundtrax go. Where "Pretty in
Pink" (the last track of any merit)
was devoted to exposing the latest
in trendy pimple-pop, "Something
Wild" has given itself over to lettin'
the world know about this reggae
thing. Yeah, there's at least four or
seven songs that could be called
"reggae-inflected." The best exam
ple is Sister Carol's niftola verzh of
"Wild Thing." It's real good. And
Dave Byrne tries his hand at this
reggae-calypso klnda thing. It's
pretty good. The Fine Young Can
nibals do a ska-wave cover of the
Buzzcocks' Go-Go's-lnspired
"Ever Fallen in Love," which
seems destined for the College
Radio Hall of Fame. It's OK. ÜB4O
contribute a reggae instrumental
that is so melba-toasty that they
musta composed it under the in
fluence of Gavin MacLeod. Gross.
Aaaaand. on the non-reggae
front, you get New Order's first
single, "Temptation." which is
good, even though the whole time
you listen to it you wonder why
the heck it's on here. There's also
some dumb song from those übiq
uitous soundtrack veterans Oingo
Boingo. and another slew of
reggae stuff, including one from
Jimmy Cliff. It's all wonderful,
really, but it's all too much. We
had to lie down afterward.
On the whole, this is a pretty
good compilation, and consider
ing it's a movie soundtrack, it's
terrific. So see the movie, buy the
soundtrack, collect the action fig
ures. What the heck.

The Dumb Thing. The Dumb

Dumb Thing
Writing a review of a movie
soundtrack is always a great cop
out for us record reviewers, be
cause we don't have to go com
pletely into the history and style of
a single artist and come up with a
whole buncha pithy hyphenated
phrases to describe precisely what
kind of music the band stands for.
Nope, you can just pick out the
songs you like and mention them
by name, and maybe make fun of
loser bands trying to get their big
break on the record. Really,
anyone could do it. In fact, anyone
could do this whole job. It's easy.
The main thing is to keep the ac
tual record you're reviewing sorta
in the back of your mind while you
come up with non sequitur intros,
comical nicknames, hyphenated
slang, commie-bashing tirades
and new ways to end sentences

with prepositions. Also, pretend
that you're the only person In the
world who has any kind of taste or
knows anything about music, and
that your opinion will be widely
treasured and responsible for the
life or death of any new release.
Practice run-ons and sentence
fragments. Laugh at your own
jokes.
Well, anyway, this here
soundtrack is not bad, as
soundtrax go. Where "Pretty in
Pink" (the last track of any merit)
was devoted to exposing the latest
in trendy pimple-pop, "Something
Wild" has given itself over to lettin'
the world know about this reggae
thing. Yeah, there's at least four or
seven songs that could be called
"reggae-inflected." The best exam
ple is Sister Carol's niftola verzh of
"Wild Thing." It's real good. And
Dave Byrne tries his hand at this
reggae-calypso klnda thing. It's
pretty good. The Fine Young Can
nibals do a ska-wave cover of the
Buzzcocks' Go-Go's-lnspired
"Ever Fallen in Love," which
seems destined for the College
Radio Hall of Fame. It's OK. ÜB4O
contribute a reggae instrumental
that is so melba-toasty that they
musta composed it under the in
fluence of Gavin MacLeod. Gross.
Aaaaand. on the non-reggae
front, you get New Order's first
single, "Temptation." which is
good, even though the whole time
you listen to it you wonder why
the heck it's on here. There's also
some dumb song from those übiq
uitous soundtrack veterans Oingo
Boingo. and another slew of
reggae stuff, including one from
Jimmy Cliff. It's all wonderful,
really, but it's all too much. We
had to lie down afterward.
On the whole, this is a pretty
good compilation, and consider
ing it's a movie soundtrack, it's
terrific. So see the movie, buy the
soundtrack, collect the action fig
ures. What the heck.

XTC: "Skylarking"
Ollie's Folly, Ollie's Folly, Ollie's
Folly, Ollie's Folly, Ollie's
After their last and most disap
pointing LP, "Big Express," and a
vow never to tour again, many of
us had relegated XTC to a
memorable past. But with their
rollicking EP posing as "The
Dukes of the Stratosphear" and
"Skylarking," their latest album,
produced by Todd Rundgren and
recorded in San Francisco, they
have recaptured their status as
the kings of quirk-rock. Easily the
best thing Todd Rundgren has
ever done, the album is a melodic,
poppish and light return to songs
in the style of The Beatles' "Sgt.
Pepper." They've cut back on the
heavy, synthesized beat of
"Express" and picked up more
acoustic Instruments and some
strings, sounding almost folkish
or colonial.
Their lyrics are at times roman
tic in the style of Wordsworth, and
at other times humorous and
witty. Lead singer Andy Partridge
sounds as if he's a simple Dutch
farmboy singing about the trials
of harvests arid seasons, but the
words are about subsistence
living by working-class laborers,
against Star Wars, about greed
and love and also about the
change of seasons. There's even a
tongue-in-cheek medieval-style
sacrificial bonfire thrown in ("So
men pull back hoods and smile/
The scapegoat blood spilled/

Splttled and grilled it cracked and
spat/ And children grew fat on the
meat"). As always. Partridge has a
quirky, childlike voice, and a great
knack for writing a melody. We'd
give this album a five if we had the
guts, but we figured people would
dismiss that as a reviewer trying
to show off how he likes obscure
bands, so we gave it half a rating
less hoping you readers would
admire our restraint.

Everyone who listens to music
seriously has, at one time or an
other, a pet band — the more
obscure, the better. Your relation
ship wih the band is more serious
and personal than it would be
with a well-known band because
you have an egoistic feeling of
having discovered what you think
is the unique privilege of enjoying
their music. You beg DJ's to
pleeea.se enlighten the local
populace with that one song,
hoping to shatter that petrifica
tion of tastes that produces the
constant barrage of REOStyx-
JourneySpeedJoviWagon. Your
song gets played at 3 a.m., and
you go to bed. satisfied that you've
done everyone a great service.
For one of us, a few years ago.
that band was the Split Enz. The
Enz had a certain sound that was
clearly different; it was neither
American nor British, but created
a niche of its own. The band intro

duced an Australian sound to the
United States that helped pave the
way for bands like Midnight Oil
and INXS. As is the case with most
bands of this type, fate was bit
tersweet. The band never received
the popularity it deserved, but it
never sold its soul to the Devil of
Silly Pop Music while trying,
either. After about 10 years and
eight albums of effort, they
decided to give it up. Their only

U.S. hit was the omnipresent "I
Got You." a taste of success inca
pable of satisfying a band which
enjoyed several Number One
records in Australia and in its
original home of New Zealand.
Naturally enough, the two
brothers who did most of the
songwrlting for the band weren't
through. Tim Finn went on to
record a solo album, "Escapade,"
in which (you guessed it) he may
or may not have sold his soul to
the aforementioned devil. It was a

ludgment call. Neil Finn waited a
bit and formed Crowded House.
As usual in this situation, the
shadow of past accomplishment
looms large. Did he follow his
brother or didn't he? 1 refer to Neil
F. rather than to the band as a
whole because he does almost all
the songwrlting. The album is
clearly an attempt to bridge the
musical and lyrical gap between
the Enz and commercial accep-

tability. Fortunately, Crowded
House retains the identifying
marks of the style which distin
guished its predecessor. Two of
the songs. "Love You 'Til the Day I
Die" and "Hole in the River," are
eerily similar (the latter was co
written with Eddie Rayner, who
played keyboards for the Enz). The
rest of the album does an admira
ble job with a tricky situation. The
tunes make you smile and tap
your foot on first audition, but
retain the subtle hints which, to

quote Yogi Berra, make it seem
like "deja vu all over again." This
time around, the emphasis is
clearly on accessibility, which
means that you won't feel like

tion after one listen. The sharp po
litical and psychological messages
of old have faded, but are still
