## No joy in Mudville: Card pounds Tigers Sprague goes home, hits grand slam against Pacific 
### CHRIS MYERS Editorial staff 
STOCKTON â€” There was no joy In Mudville.
A plaque outside Stockton's Billy Hebert
Field reads. "Legend has it that Stockton, be
cause of Its many early day floods, is the
'Mudville' of Ernest L. Thayer's famous poem
'Casey at the Bat,' first printed in The San
Francisco Examiner on June 3, 1888. 'Casey'
experts claim that a game actually occurred
with 'Casey' as the hometown hero against a
touring team of major league all-stars."
The Stanford baseball team traveled to
Stockton yesterday, and the Cardinal's non
conference matchup with host University of
the Pacific had all the makings of the classic
Mudv'lle tale: a heavily favored visiting squad,
a slightly muddy field and a hometown hero.
But the hometown hero was on the wrong
side in this game. Cardinal catcher Ed
Sprague, a Stockton native, came home and
blasted a grand slam home run in the fifth in
ning to power Stanford's 13-2 defeat of the
Tigers.
The win improves the Cardinal's record to 3-
1. while winless Pacific absorbed its fourth
defeat.
Sprague wasn't the only hometown boy on
the Stanford side. The game was also a happy
homecoming for Stanford Coach Mark
Marquess, another Stockton native.
And though he was far from his hometown
of Weymouth, Mass., freshman rightfielder
Paul Carey looked right at home in Stockton,
drilling two home runs.
Marquess was understandably pleased with
his team's performance.

"Wc swang the bat real well; (starter Steve)
Chitren pitched an extremely good game," he
said. "It's always nice to win at home."
And it's always nice to have 12 hits, includ
ing four home runs, in support of five-hit
pitching.
The Cardinal barrage began immediately,
with three singles in the top of the first. But
with two men on and none out, Tiger starter
Jim Yanko made a life-or-death grab of Jeff
Saenger's ballistic line drive and doubled soph
omore Frank Carey off second to hold the Card
inal to a single run in the inning.
A frame later, first baseman Ron Witmeyer
ripped a home run to right field for the Card
inal's second run.
Meanwhile, Stanford starter Chitren was
making the Tiger batters look like pussycats.
Chitren had a perfect game through three in
nings before giving up a lead-off home run to
catcher Joe Ortiz in the fourth.
By that time, Yanko had settled down; after
four innings the score was still a close 2-1.
Tiger Head Coach John Picone, however, ap
parently didn't realize what a good thing he
had going. He yanked Yanko after four in favor
of righthander Jay Ramey, which, it turned
out, was something like bringing Harding on
in relief of Wilson.
The hapless Ramey gave up a single to
shortstop David Esquer to open the inning,
then Issued walks to the next three batters he
faced.
With the bases loaded and one run already
in. Ramey offered Sprague a homecoming gift
in the form of a 2-0 inside fastball.
That was just the gift Sprague was expect
ing.
"I figured he (Ramey) was going to come with

a fastball." Sprague said. "I was looking for
something on the inside of the plate where I
could drive some runs in."
Sprague's blast drove in four runs and drove
out Ramey, who was replaced by lefthander
Renny Thompson.
Thompson got two quick outs, but then
watched helplessly as Paul Carey launched a
home run to deepest right center to put the
Cardinal up 8-1.
Chitren began to tire in the sixth, giving up
two hits and a base on balls. Still, the Tigers
could only claw out one run, bringing the score
to 8-2.
The Cardinal, however, exploded again in
the seventh. Pacific's fourth pitcher. Scott
Fujlta, walked designated hitter Scott Deluc
chi and centerfielder Toi Cook to start the In
ning. Paul Carey then lashed a three-run oppo
site field homer to put Stanford up 11-2. Yes
terday's shots were the second and third
homers of the season for Carey.
Freshman righthander Mark Carper and
sophomore righty Brian Keyser mopped up for
Chitren, with Carper throwing two no-hit in
nings before yielding to Keyser in the ninth.
The win went to Chitren, who yielded only
four hits in this, his first appearance of the
season. The valiant Yanko was saddled with
his second loss of the year to go with no wins.
Card notes
Yesterday's power production bodes well for
a team that sorely lacked slugging last year.
After ringing up 565 runs and 80 home runs
in 1985, the Cardinal fell off to 425 runs and
36 homers last year.

Steve Chitren made his first start of the season a good one yesterday.
In six innings of pitching the sophomore gave up four hits and two
runs, a performance that moved his record to a perfect 1-0.
