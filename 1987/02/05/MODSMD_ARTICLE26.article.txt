# Card women to play Trojans
## 
### PABLO MORALES Staff writer 
"Frightening" was the word
Coach Tara VanDerveer used to
assess Stanford's completely dom
inant performance against
Berkeley two weeks ago — just two
days after a lackluster showing
against an average Brigham
Young women's basketball squad.
Such a reaction is more often
elicited by horror films than by
basketball games. Nonetheless, it
stands as an adequate evaluation
of Stanford's play this year.
In many ways, it has been a
scary season for VanDerveer and
her Cardinal as a Jekyll-and-Hyde
inconsistency — brilliant one mo
ment, horrific the next — has
plagued the Cardinal throughout
the year.
Following the win over Berkeley
and a convincing sweep of the
Arizona teams, Stanford looked
like it had finally shrugged off the
spell of Inconsistency and other
debilitating side effects caused by
the Cardinal's Inexperienced line
up.
But the Cardinal's eerie trans
formation was triggered once
again by both Oregon teams last
weekend. The two disappointing
losses dropped Stanford from
third to fifth place In the Pacific
-10 Conference.

"We've shown that we can per
form very well," VanDerveer said.
"But this only makes it more
frustrating when we can't.
"It's a matter of people asserting
themselves at the Pac-10 level. We
just have to raise our play to a
higher level," she said.
The Cardinal will definitely have
to play at a higher level tonight
when it faces the 13-6 USC
Trojans in the first of a difficult
two-game road trip through
Southern California.
Led by six-foot-three forward
Cherie Nelson and 6-6 center
Monica Lamb, the Ladies of Troy
boast perhaps the best front line
in the Pac-10.
Nelson leads the Trojans in both
scoring and rebounding at 20
points and 11 boards per game.
Lamb is averaging 15 points and
eight rebounds an outing.
USC's version of the twin towers
combined to dismantle the Card
inal, 72-59, a month ago at Maples
Pavilion. Lamb, a transfer from
Houston, scored a game-high 25
points and Nelson pulled down 20
rebounds to lead both teams.
The Cardinal, 11-8 overall, is
tied with UCLA for fifth place in
the Pac-10. In a battle for the con
ference lead last weekend, the
Trojans fell to the Washington
Huskies 73-61 in Seattle. USC is
7-2 In the Pac-10.
