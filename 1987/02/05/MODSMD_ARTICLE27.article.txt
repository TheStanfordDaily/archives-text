# Top recruits pick Cardinal football
## 
### JON WEISMAN Staff writer 
It's been many years since
Stanford has beaten Nebraska
in football. In recruiting,
however, the Cornhuskers yes
terday lost to the Cardinal
twice.
Two highly regarded recruits,
Rick Davis of Creighton
Preparatory School in Omaha.
Neb., and Ryan Shea of El
Camino High in Sacramento,
verbally committed to Stanford
over Nebraska and several
Pacific 10 Conference schools.
In fact, both indicated that
Stanford was their first choice
since their recruitment began.
Shea going so far as to cancel
trips to Nebraska and UCLA
after visiting the Farm.
Davis appears to have been
quite a steal. Not only is he
from Omaha, but his uncle,
Dick Davis, holds records from
his days as a fullback at Ne
braska from 1966 to 1968.
"Don't get me wrong," Rick
Davis told the Times-Tribune
yesterday. "I'm an avid Ne
braska fan. I love Nebraska a

lot. But Stanford is consistent
with the way my life is going
. . . just everything that Stan
ford could give is better than
Arizona State or Nebraska."
Davis, a 5-foot-11, 190
pounder, rushed for 580 yards
this season, including 95 in the
Nebraska state championship
game. He teamed up with all
state running back George Ac
hola to make up a powerful
backfield duo at Creighton.
Shea was listed on both the
National High School Football
Recruiting Service's top 100
and the "Best in the West"
team, a poll of Pac-10 recruit
ing coordinators.
An interesting aspect of
Stanford's approach to Shea is
that the University was the only
school among Shea's final five
choices to recruit him as a de
fensive lineman. However,
Shea indicated that this was
not a factor in his decision to
enroll at Stanford.
"I just liked the people and
the place," Shea told the Times-
Tribune.
