# Home at last, but no rest yet
## After five games on road Card hosts strong UCLA squad 
### SUSAN SLUSSER Editorial staff 
Returning home for the week
after five straight road games and
a 1-4 record in those away con
tests. you'd think life would be
getting a lot easier for the Stan
ford men's basketball team.
It Isn't.
The Cardinal has the ugly task
of taking on Reggie Miller and Co..
1.e., the UCLA Bruins, arguably
the most talented team In the
crazy, topsy-turvy league that Is
the Pacific 10 Conference, tonight
at Maples Pavilion (7:35 p.m..
KCBS 740 AM. KZSU 90.1 FM).
The Stanford squad goes Into
this evening's matchup with an
11-9 overall record and a 5-6 mark
In Pac-10 play. The Cardinal Is
alone In seventh place In the con
ference after being swept by
Oregon and Oregon State last
weekend, and now trails Pac-10
leader Oregon State (8-3) by three
games. UCLA, on the other hand,
just a half game out of first place
with a 7-1 Pac-10 record, Is tied
for second with Arizona. The
Bruins are 13-5 overall, and have
won 11 of thetr last 12 games.
The good news for Stanford Is
that UCLA Is not nearly as strong
on the road as It Is at home. The
Bruins are 2-4 away from Pauley
Pavilion this season, although
they are on a two-game road win
ning streak after downing Arizona
State 61-51 on Jan. 8 and Arizona
with a last second shot by Craig
Jackson on Jan. 11.
Another bit of Information for

the Cardinal to savor Is that UCLA
has not been playing particularly
well of late, losing Its first home
game of the year to Washington
95-87 last week, and just edging a
weak Washington State team 61-
60. Miller scored a season-low four
points In that contest.

Still, Miller Is one of the most
feared shooters in the league,
scoring 20.6 points per game,
second best in the Pac-10. The 6-
foot-7 senior forward is also
averaging 4.8 rebounds per game.
"That (the Washington State
game) Is not an average Reggie
Miller night." Stanford forward
Todd Llchtl said. "We have to ex
pect him to be tough, but we're
not going to give him a lot of spe
cial attention. When we play man
to-man. we'll try to play him tight.

and when we play zone, we'll try to
make him shoot over us. We've got
to make him work for his points."
The last time the two teams
faced each other. Jan. 2 at UCLA,
Miller scored a game-high 23
points in the Bruins' 95-75 vic
tory. He also totalled 35 points
against the Cardinal In a game
last season.
"I don't think there's a way to
stop Reggie, per se." Stanford
Coach Mike Montgomery said.
"He's going to shoot the ball. . . .
He's a tremendous shooter — the
more often he has the ball, the
more often he scores points. We
can't let him shoot uncontested."
Point guard Pooh Richardson is
also a threat, averaging 11.2
points and 6.4 assists per game.
His assists average is second in
the league, behind Gary Payton of
Oregon State (8.5). and Richard
son is fourth in the Pac-10 in field
goal percentage at .534 (86-of
-161).
Another Bruin scoring in
double figures is reserve forward
Montel Hatcher, who averages
10.2 points per game. Among the
starters, junior guard Dave Immel
totals 7.4 points per game, sopho
more forward Charles Rochelln
averages 6.0 points per game and
senior center Jack Haley scores
4.8 points per game. Also expected
to see action is freshman forward
Trevor Wilson (6.9 points per
game), who scored a season-high
22 points against the Cardinal
earlier this season.
"UCLA Is real scary."
Montgomery said, "because they

have so much talent. We'll have to
keep to our half-court game, be
cause you can't run with them
over the course of a game. We'll
have to keep them out of their full
court game and the defense Is
going to have to locate people. We
can't let them get second shots.
"They shoot shots you would
think are bad shots, but they go
In. What we have to do is make
them shoot as tough of shots as
we can In 40 minutes."
Llchtl, who leads the Stanford
squad In scoring at 17.7 points
per game, agreed that the Card
inal can not run with UCLA.
"They're obviously a good team."
he said. "We're going to have to
slow it down and utilize our half
court offense, not let them get
their full-court game going, and
stop their perimeter game."
Stanford's biggest problem
recently has not been defense, but
rebounding. The Cardinal is sixth
in the Pac-10 in rebounds per
game (32.9), but is being out
rebounded by opponents, who
average 36.1 per game — a differ
ence of -3.2 rebounds a game, the
worst differential in the league. In
last Sunday's loss to Oregon.
Stanford was outrebounded 28 to
41, and managed only one offen
sive board the entire contest.
"It's a source of concern for us."
Montgomery said. "We have to get
back to the boards."
"We have to improve," Llchtl
said. "We worked on It this week
— we have got to get tougher and

concentrate. We need to make a
conscious effort to go to the
boards, and try to be patient on of
fense."
Every home game is crucial at
this point of the season, and Stan
lord will certainly try to make the
most of its home-court advantage,
especially against a team as strong
as UCLA. "It's a real big game for
us." Lichti said. "We want to get
back above .500, and a sweep at
home would put us over .500.
UCLA would be a real nice win. If
we get some home supoort. it
would be even nicer."
Montgomery also emphasized

the Importance of the home
crowd. "I still think over the
course of a long haul that UCLA IS
still the best team in the
league. . . . This is a good oppor
tunity for students to get over
those midterms and yell at some
body else besides their instructors
for awhile. It would be nice to have
them come out. yell at the officials
or yell at me. and vent their
frustrations."
Card Notes
Miller now ranks tenth in Pac-10
history with 1753 points; he needs
just 15 to move ahead of Bill Walton
(1167). In so doing he will move into
second place in UCLA history.
UCLA leads the series 106-67,
despite an early Stanford lead (44-18
in 1942). Since then, UCLA has won
88 of 111 meetings.

that UCLA Is not nearly as strong
on the road as It Is at home. The
Bruins are 2-4 away from Pauley
Pavilion this season, although
they are on a two-game road win
ning streak after downing Arizona
State 61-51 on Jan. 8 and Arizona
with a last second shot by Craig
Jackson on Jan. 11.
Another bit of Information for

the Cardinal to savor Is that UCLA
has not been playing particularly
well of late, losing Its first home
game of the year to Washington
95-87 last week, and just edging a
weak Washington State team 61-
60. Miller scored a season-low four
points In that contest.

Still, Miller Is one of the most
feared shooters in the league,
scoring 20.6 points per game,
second best in the Pac-10. The 6-
foot-7 senior forward is also
averaging 4.8 rebounds per game.
"That (the Washington State
game) Is not an average Reggie
Miller night." Stanford forward
Todd Llchtl said. "We have to ex
pect him to be tough, but we're
not going to give him a lot of spe
cial attention. When we play man
to-man. we'll try to play him tight.

and when we play zone, we'll try to
make him shoot over us. We've got
to make him work for his points."
The last time the two teams
faced each other. Jan. 2 at UCLA,
Miller scored a game-high 23
points in the Bruins' 95-75 vic
tory. He also totalled 35 points
against the Cardinal In a game
last season.
"I don't think there's a way to
stop Reggie, per se." Stanford
Coach Mike Montgomery said.
"He's going to shoot the ball. . . .
He's a tremendous shooter — the
more often he has the ball, the
more often he scores points. We
can't let him shoot uncontested."
Point guard Pooh Richardson is
also a threat, averaging 11.2
points and 6.4 assists per game.
His assists average is second in
the league, behind Gary Payton of
Oregon State (8.5). and Richard
son is fourth in the Pac-10 in field
goal percentage at .534 (86-of
-161).
Another Bruin scoring in
double figures is reserve forward
Montel Hatcher, who averages
10.2 points per game. Among the
starters, junior guard Dave Immel
totals 7.4 points per game, sopho
more forward Charles Rochelln
averages 6.0 points per game and
senior center Jack Haley scores
4.8 points per game. Also expected
to see action is freshman forward
Trevor Wilson (6.9 points per
game), who scored a season-high
22 points against the Cardinal
earlier this season.
"UCLA Is real scary."
Montgomery said, "because they

have so much talent. We'll have to
keep to our half-court game, be
cause you can't run with them
over the course of a game. We'll
have to keep them out of their full
court game and the defense Is
going to have to locate people. We
can't let them get second shots.
"They shoot shots you would
think are bad shots, but they go
In. What we have to do is make
them shoot as tough of shots as
we can In 40 minutes."
Llchtl, who leads the Stanford
squad In scoring at 17.7 points
per game, agreed that the Card
inal can not run with UCLA.
"They're obviously a good team."
he said. "We're going to have to
slow it down and utilize our half
court offense, not let them get
their full-court game going, and
stop their perimeter game."
Stanford's biggest problem
recently has not been defense, but
rebounding. The Cardinal is sixth
in the Pac-10 in rebounds per
game (32.9), but is being out
rebounded by opponents, who
average 36.1 per game — a differ
ence of -3.2 rebounds a game, the
worst differential in the league. In
last Sunday's loss to Oregon.
Stanford was outrebounded 28 to
41, and managed only one offen
sive board the entire contest.
"It's a source of concern for us."
Montgomery said. "We have to get
back to the boards."
"We have to improve," Llchtl
said. "We worked on It this week
— we have got to get tougher and

concentrate. We need to make a
conscious effort to go to the
boards, and try to be patient on of
fense."
Every home game is crucial at
this point of the season, and Stan
lord will certainly try to make the
most of its home-court advantage,
especially against a team as strong
as UCLA. "It's a real big game for
us." Lichti said. "We want to get
back above .500, and a sweep at
home would put us over .500.
UCLA would be a real nice win. If
we get some home supoort. it
would be even nicer."
Montgomery also emphasized

the Importance of the home
crowd. "I still think over the
course of a long haul that UCLA IS
still the best team in the
league. . . . This is a good oppor
tunity for students to get over
those midterms and yell at some
body else besides their instructors
for awhile. It would be nice to have
them come out. yell at the officials
or yell at me. and vent their
frustrations."
Card Notes
Miller now ranks tenth in Pac-10
history with 1753 points; he needs
just 15 to move ahead of Bill Walton
(1167). In so doing he will move into
second place in UCLA history.
UCLA leads the series 106-67,
despite an early Stanford lead (44-18
in 1942). Since then, UCLA has won
88 of 111 meetings.
Returning home for the week
after five straight road games and
a 1-4 record in those away con
tests. you'd think life would be
getting a lot easier for the Stan
ford men's basketball team.
It Isn't.
The Cardinal has the ugly task
