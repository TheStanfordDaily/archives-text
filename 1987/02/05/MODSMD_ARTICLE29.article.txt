# Boyd returns, bolsters Card gymnastics
## 
### EVAN TUCHINSKY Staff writer 
"Once upon a time there was a
girl from Los Angeles named
Cindy Boyd who came to Stan
ford." So began Homer Sardina.
Stanford Women's Gymnastics
Coach, describing the senior who
took a year off from competitive
gymnastics to study in Paris and
has returned in great form and
great spirits, averaging 8.6 on the
balance beam just three weeks
into the season.
"Cindy is truly an amazing Indi
vidual." Sardina said. "She is one
of the nicest people you could
meet."
The coach is not alone in his
respect for Boyd. "She is one of the
hardest working, most disciplined
people I know," teammate Alison
McGann said. "She is really sup
portive. When I was a freshman,
her support really helped me a
lot."
Boyd's Interest in gymnastics
began when she was six years old.
"In 1972, I used to go to Scats
Gym (in Huntington Beach) to see
Cathy Rigby work out," the senior
said. "My father would take me
there, and I sat on the steps and
watched her work out for the
Olympics."
She subsequently enrolled in
the youth program at Scats, where
she competed through high
school. She started competing at
the Class I level in 1978 and that
same year garnered the California
Class I championship and

finished ninth in the national
vault finals.
Boyd competed nationally at
Class I until 1982, when she
became an Elite level gymnast.
"That's the highest level in the
U.S. today," Sardina said.
After reaching that high level so
quickly. Boyd's senior year in high
school became one of decision and
dilemma. To complicate the typi
cal college choices that most
seniors face, Boyd sustained an
injury that made collegiate compe
tition uncertain.
"In her senior year she dislo
cated her elbow, so we didn't know
where she was athletically," Sar
dina said. Consequently, she was
recruited but not offered financial
aid.
"Stanford was the only place I
was recruited, but I didn't get a
scholarship." Boyd said.
Other schools expressed inter
est In her joining their programs,
but Stanford was her only choice.
"I wanted to go Ivy League." she
recalled. "1 looked at schools like
Wellesley and Brown that don't
really have gymnastics programs."
As is now obvious, Boyd chose
the Farm, and elected to compete
for the Cardinal. "Her first year
she was good, and her second year
she was superb," Sardina said.
In addition, "Cindy was team

captain in 1985. something that
not many people know." noted
McGann, who worked out with
Boyd for many years at Scats.
Junior year at Stanford marked
another hallmark decision in
Boyd's life, when she opted to
study in Paris for a year. "It was
something I've always wanted to
do," she said. "I'm a French major
and interested in international re
lations. I wanted to know a new
culture and see America from a
new perspective."
"We offered her financial aid for
her junior year, but she elected to
go to Paris," Sardina said. Though
he was losing one of his best ath
letes, Sardina supported her deci
sion. "It was a once-in-a-lifetime
opportunity." he said.
Apart from the educational
benefits of her overseas experi
ence, Boyd was given the privilege
of working out with the French
national team. "The head coach at
Scats was an Olympic coach," she
said. "I asked him if he knew
where I could train in Paris.
"I got a letter of reference from
him," she continued. After
presenting the letter to the French
coach, "he said I was welcome to
come by and work out when I
wanted.
"I worked out when they (the
French gymnasts) were there, but

not with them. It was basically my
own training." Boyd added. None
theless. "I was pretty lucky. It was
an honor."
Coming back to Stanford has
been "a major adjustment, but not
culture shock, because It's the
same culture I left." she said.
The only real changes she had to
face were on the gymnastics
squad. "Now on our team she has
to overcome more obstacles." Sar
dlna said. "With 11 out of 16 new
gymnasts, most of the people on
the team were fresh faces. Also,
the overall quality of the team Is
up."
Boyd agreed. "The teams have
Improved since freshman year. I
notice a great difference now that I
have been back. The skill level Is
higher.
"It's been an adjustment be
cause it's a young team, but
they're supportive." she added.
"It's nice to have a very supportive
team."
With teammates like Boyd, it
seems easy for the Cardinal gym
nasts to be supportive.
Just as a picture is worth a
thousand words, so one incident
may best illustrate the personality
of Cindy Boyd. "When she missed
on beam last Saturday," Sardina
recalled, "she came up to me and
apologized. She's a very special
person indeed."

notice a great difference now that I
have been back. The skill level Is
higher.
"It's been an adjustment be
cause it's a young team, but
they're supportive." she added.
"It's nice to have a very supportive
team."
With teammates like Boyd, it
seems easy for the Cardinal gym
nasts to be supportive.
Just as a picture is worth a
thousand words, so one incident
may best illustrate the personality
of Cindy Boyd. "When she missed
on beam last Saturday," Sardina
recalled, "she came up to me and
apologized. She's a very special
person indeed."

At this time last year team captain Cindy Boyd was seeing the sights
of Paris. This year the senior gymnast is back at home competing for
the Cardinal.
"Once upon a time there was a
girl from Los Angeles named
Cindy Boyd who came to Stan
ford." So began Homer Sardina.
Stanford Women's Gymnastics
Coach, describing the senior who
took a year off from competitive
gymnastics to study in Paris and
has returned in great form and
great spirits, averaging 8.6 on the
balance beam just three weeks
into the season.
"Cindy is truly an amazing Indi
vidual." Sardina said. "She is one
of the nicest people you could
meet."
The coach is not alone in his
respect for Boyd. "She is one of the
hardest working, most disciplined
people I know," teammate Alison
McGann said. "She is really sup
portive. When I was a freshman,
her support really helped me a
lot."
Boyd's Interest in gymnastics
began when she was six years old.
"In 1972, I used to go to Scats
Gym (in Huntington Beach) to see
Cathy Rigby work out," the senior
said. "My father would take me
there, and I sat on the steps and
watched her work out for the
Olympics."
She subsequently enrolled in
the youth program at Scats, where
she competed through high
school. She started competing at
the Class I level in 1978 and that
same year garnered the California
Class I championship and

finished ninth in the national
vault finals.
Boyd competed nationally at
Class I until 1982, when she
became an Elite level gymnast.
"That's the highest level in the
U.S. today," Sardina said.
After reaching that high level so
quickly. Boyd's senior year in high
school became one of decision and
dilemma. To complicate the typi
cal college choices that most
seniors face, Boyd sustained an
injury that made collegiate compe
tition uncertain.
"In her senior year she dislo
cated her elbow, so we didn't know
where she was athletically," Sar
dina said. Consequently, she was
recruited but not offered financial
aid.
"Stanford was the only place I
was recruited, but I didn't get a
scholarship." Boyd said.
Other schools expressed inter
est In her joining their programs,
but Stanford was her only choice.
"I wanted to go Ivy League." she
recalled. "1 looked at schools like
Wellesley and Brown that don't
really have gymnastics programs."
As is now obvious, Boyd chose
the Farm, and elected to compete
for the Cardinal. "Her first year
she was good, and her second year
she was superb," Sardina said.
In addition, "Cindy was team

captain in 1985. something that
not many people know." noted
McGann, who worked out with
Boyd for many years at Scats.
Junior year at Stanford marked
another hallmark decision in
Boyd's life, when she opted to
study in Paris for a year. "It was
something I've always wanted to
do," she said. "I'm a French major
and interested in international re
lations. I wanted to know a new
culture and see America from a
new perspective."
"We offered her financial aid for
her junior year, but she elected to
go to Paris," Sardina said. Though
he was losing one of his best ath
letes, Sardina supported her deci
sion. "It was a once-in-a-lifetime
opportunity." he said.
Apart from the educational
benefits of her overseas experi
ence, Boyd was given the privilege
of working out with the French
national team. "The head coach at
Scats was an Olympic coach," she
said. "I asked him if he knew
where I could train in Paris.
"I got a letter of reference from
him," she continued. After
presenting the letter to the French
coach, "he said I was welcome to
come by and work out when I
wanted.
"I worked out when they (the
French gymnasts) were there, but

not with them. It was basically my
own training." Boyd added. None
theless. "I was pretty lucky. It was
an honor."
Coming back to Stanford has
been "a major adjustment, but not
culture shock, because It's the
same culture I left." she said.
The only real changes she had to
face were on the gymnastics
squad. "Now on our team she has
to overcome more obstacles." Sar
dlna said. "With 11 out of 16 new
gymnasts, most of the people on
the team were fresh faces. Also,
the overall quality of the team Is
up."
Boyd agreed. "The teams have
Improved since freshman year. I
notice a great difference now that I
have been back. The skill level Is
higher.
"It's been an adjustment be
cause it's a young team, but
they're supportive." she added.
"It's nice to have a very supportive
team."
With teammates like Boyd, it
seems easy for the Cardinal gym
nasts to be supportive.
Just as a picture is worth a
thousand words, so one incident
may best illustrate the personality
of Cindy Boyd. "When she missed
on beam last Saturday," Sardina
recalled, "she came up to me and
apologized. She's a very special
person indeed."
