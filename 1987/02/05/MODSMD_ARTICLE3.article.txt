# DUI details released as examples

### CHARLIE GOFEN Senior staff writer 
Judicial Affairs Officer Sally Cole has
released details of two recent investigations
Into alleged drunk driving on campus, saying
she hopes the visibility of the cases will deter
students from driving after consuming alco
hol.
In both cases, Cole determined that the stu
dents had violated the University's official code
of acceptable behavior, the Fundamental Stan
dard, because their driving posed a risk to per
sons and property.
"Student A," arrested In the vicinity of
Mayfield Avenue and charged by Stanford

police with driving while intoxicated, was
traveling 50 mph In a 25 mph zone. According
to sanitized judicial documents that Cole
released to The Dally — names and dates have
been expunged — Cole charged the student
with a violation of the Fundamental Standard
because his behavior posed a danger to prop
erty and to "numerous pedestrians" in the
area.
"Student B," also charged by police with
driving while intoxicated, ran a stop sign at
Campus Drive and Alvarado Row. lost control
of the automobile and collided into a curb,
leaving more than 80 feet of skid marks in his
wake, according to a report written by Cole.
The student had been driving a friend's car.

Cole charged "Student B" with violating the
Fundamental Standard by driving danger
ously. and added that the student had been
"disrespectful of the rights of others."
Speaking in an interview last week. Cole said
she wants students to know that a drunk
driving arrest on campus can lead not only to
criminal charges under state law but also to
University charges and penalties under Stan
ford's own set of laws.
Cole emphasized that the University looks at
different criteria than state law enforcement
officials when investigating cases of drunk
driving. The University, using the Fundamen-
tal Standard, considers: the man
ner. time and place in which the
vehicle was driven; the amount of
alcohol or drugs ingested and the
likelihood that they affected the
driver s mental and physical
faculties at the time of the viola
tion; and the damage or injury, if
any, caused by the driver.
The University's standards are
not always more stringent than
the state's. Cole decided earlier
this academic year not to charge a
drunk driver with violation of the
Fundamental Standard after she
determined that the student's
driving had not posed a threat to

persons or property and that the
driver's reported swerving on
Mayfleld Avenue had merely been
a set of maneuvers "to avoid
potholes."
In other drunk driving inci
dents. including a precedent
setting case two years ago. the
Stanford judicial system may find
a student guilty of violating the
Fundamental Standard even
when the student is acquitted of
charges In a court of law.
Drunk driving appears to be a
significant and growing problem
at Stanford. "The numbers have
gone up dramatically (even
though) the population on
campus has not changed dramati
cally over the last 15 years," Stan
ford Police Chief Marvin Her
rington said.

Herrlngton said he makes a two
to five-minute report each Monday
morning at the weekly University
president's meeting, and also
talks frequently with Dean of Stu
dent Affairs James Lyons to alert
him to any student arrests that
the University may wish to investi
gate. Herrington added that he
never releases information that is
not in the public domain.
Asst. Dean of Student Affairs
Diana Conklin, who will mete out
penalties to the two students
charged by Cole with violations of
the Fundamental Standard, said
yesterday that she has not yet
made her recommendations in the
two cases. Conklin's recommen
dations will be forwarded to Act
ing University President James
Rosse for approval.
