ATLANTIC CITY. N.J. (AP) - A
physician once looked at Mark
Breland's narrow, almost delicate
hands, and told him he should
have taken up golf.
But Breland stuck with punch
ing heads and bodies, overcame
sore hands and criticism, and to
morrow night will challenge for
the World Boxing Association wel
terweight championship.
The unbeaten Breland will meet
Harold Volbrecht of South Africa
in a scheduled 15-round bout at
the 2,800-seat Convention Center
Ballroom, and he is an overwhelm
ing favorite.
Two boxing people were talking

about the fight in the hotel lobby
when one asked. "How do you see
it?"
"Breland inside five," was the
reply.
"You mean minutes?"
The 23-year-old Breland. of New
York, is fully aware if what is ex
pected of him. but he appeared
relaxed at a news conference Wed
nesday.
"I've learned to control pressure
now, to live with it," said Breland.
who scored 73 knockouts in pos
ting a 101-1 amateur record, win
ning five New York Golden Gloves
titles, a world championship and
an Olympic gold medal.

But Breland's phenomenal suc
cess brought with it demands that
he be spectacular every time he
fought.
"People put me on a pedestal,
and it was not enough if 1 just
won." he said. "I was not fighting
for myself, 1 was fighting for the
crowd."
Breland also heard boos in his
early pro fights, but he shut them
out and worked at making style
changes and developing as a pro.
"It got to the point where I knew
I couldn't please everyone, I've just
got to win."
The 6-foot-2 Breland, who
scored four knockouts in winning

his first eight fights, really
blossomed in 1986. He opened the
year with a 10-round decision over
Troy Wortham. then knocked out
his next seven opponents, five of
them within two rounds. In

third-round knockout of Darryl
Anthony, who handed him his
only amateur loss.

record with nine knockouts, is
ranked No. 1 for his second WBA

uled as a 12-round elimination
