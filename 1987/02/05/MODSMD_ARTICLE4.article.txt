# Condoms: Get 'em while they last
## 
### BAIE NETZER Senior staff writer 
Winter quarter may be a sluggish time for
some students, but apparently not for all. A
condom rush Is on, according to counselors
at the Contraceptive Information Center.
And while recent price Increases of local
suppliers have caused CIC workers to
scramble to San Francisco to find cheaper
condoms, students paying 10 cents per
condom at the CIC office on the second floor
of Cowell Student Health Center may be
happily surprised to find free condoms
awaiting them downstairs.
The free condoms available downstairs
(Ramses Extras condoms, lubricated with
spermicide), were donated to Cowell last

quarter lor distribution with a filer on
"Breaking the STD chain," according to Dr.
Doryn Davis-Chervln. director of the Health
Promotion Program. After condoms were
sent to resident assistants and distributed
In White Plaza, there were approximately
1,000 condoms left over.
But It took a number of weeks for the con
doms to find their way back to Cowell.
Senior Steve Stanford, who helped dis
tribute the condoms, at one point had
hundreds of contraceptives In his bedroom
closet. Senior Ken Ruebush of the AIDS
Education Project then acquired some for
distribution during National Condom
Week, and Stanford returned the rest of the
condoms to Cowell.
The AIDS Education Project will
use the condoms in a contest
planned for Feb. 17 and 18. Pack
ets of seven or eight different
brands of condoms will be dis
tributed in White Plaza for stu
dents to take home and "check
them out." said Ruebush. Stu
dents will then be asked to rate
the condoms according to color,
size, shape, texture and taste.
Meanwhile, CIC workers say
they have a booming business
upstairs selling the Prime lubr
icated condoms they keep in
stock. The CIC has already sold
approximately 400 condoms this

quarter, according to junior Eric
Sean Jackson, a counselor at CIC.
The CIC normally sells around 500
condoms over the course of an
entire quarter, he said.
"They go really quickly, but they
usually peak near the end of the
quarter." Jackson said.
CIC previously acquired con
doms from Planned Parenthood in
San Mateo. But when Planned
Parenthood recently hiked its
price from 10 cents to 25 cents per
condom. CIC volunteers went
looking elsewhere.
Since the price hike. CIC volun
teers have made two trips to San
Francisco to acquire 900 con
doms. Jackson said.
On the trip to San Francisco,
Jackson said he also acquired
"fun condoms" to show at dorm
outreach presentations.
