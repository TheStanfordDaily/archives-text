# Fund raising might go coed
## 
### TRACIE THOMPSON Staff writer 
University Athletic Director
Andy Geiger wants to combine
scholarship fund raising for Stan
ford men's and women's athletics,
but his idea is encountering resis
tance from some of the most
generous alumni supporters of
Stanford sports.
The Buck Club has been very
successfully raising money for
athletic scholarships since 1934
— but only for men. The female
equivalent, the Cardinal Club, has
never been able to raise enough
money to cover all women's athle
tic scholarships, which have
rapidly grown in the last nine
years.
The shortfall has been covered
by the Athletic Department, but at
a cost. The Athletic Department
has had an accumulating budget
deficit, mostly due to financial aid
costs, for the last five years.
This year, for example, the de
partment had a deficit of around
$375,000. Of that total, »317,000
was spent on financial aid for ath
letes.
Geiger noted that the Buck Club
has raised enough money to cover

the women's athletic scholarship
deficit problem. But under the
current arrangement, Buck Club
money Is In a restricted fund and
can be used only for men's schol
arships.
Besides removing gender re
strictions from funds raised, mer
ging the two clubs will also save
money, according to Geiger.
"It enables me to get more en
ergy out of a 22-cent stamp."
Geiger said. Currently, many
alumni receive separate solicita
tion pitches from the Buck and
Cardinal clubs.
But some members of the Buck
Club believe a merger will actually
reduce the amount of money
raised for scholarships.
According to 1962 graduate
Frank Atkinson, a former chair
man of the Buck Club, some club
members believe that one
combined donation might
amount to less than the Athletic
Department receives from the two
checks in separate solicitations.
Geiger acknowledged that argu
ment, but said that the people
making it are responding more
emotionally than logically.
"It's foolhardy to continue
gender-separate fund raising,"
Geiger said. He added that a
merged effort will yield more
money from younger alumni who
might be put off by the gender
specific fund raising.
A proposed trial run at
combined clubs was narrowly
voted down at a spring meeting of
the Buck Club. Geiger has no
timetable for merging the fund
raising efforts, because he said he
is not going to force the Buck Club
members into the arrangement.
But he said he estimated it would
take two to three years to make
the transition.
It's difficult to fund-raise in a
climate of anger. I want them to
come around and say that it's the
right thing to do." Geiger said.
But Geiger has a plan to put
pressure on the club. He has told
the Buck Club that if the athletic

financial aid program continues
to run big deficits he will make the
necessary cuts in athletic scholar
ships for men as well as women.
"I am a staunch believer in
women's athletics." Geiger said.
The scholarship funds are the
only aspect of the Athletic Depart
ment that is separated by gender.
Stanford does not waive the tui
tion of athletes on aid. The money
is paid by the Athletic Department
and clubs, which last year gave
the University *4.7 million in tui
tion. room, board and fees. Two
thirds of the 400 athletes who
received aid were male.
There is a great deal of pressure
on Stanford's fund raising effort
because of the ever-increasing
cost of a Stanford education. Ac
cording to the former director of
annual giving for the Buck Club.
Jack Laird, it probably costs UC-
Berkeley fund raisers only half as
much to offer a football player the
same "full ride" scholarship that
Stanford offers.
