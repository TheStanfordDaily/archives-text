# Fund raising might go coed
## 
### TRACIE THOMPSON Staff writer 
University Athletic Director
Andy Geiger wants to combine
scholarship fund raising for Stan
ford men's and women's athletics,
but his idea is encountering resis
tance from some of the most
generous alumni supporters of
Stanford sports.
The Buck Club has been very
successfully raising money for
athletic scholarships since 1934
— but only for men. The female
equivalent, the Cardinal Club, has
never been able to raise enough
money to cover all women's athle
tic scholarships, which have
rapidly grown in the last nine
years.
The shortfall has been covered
by the Athletic Department, but at
a cost. The Athletic Department
has had an accumulating budget
deficit, mostly due to financial aid
costs, for the last five years.
This year, for example, the de
partment had a deficit of around
$375,000. Of that total, »317,000
was spent on financial aid for ath
letes.
Geiger noted that the Buck Club
has raised enough money to cover

the women's athletic scholarship
deficit problem. But under the
current arrangement, Buck Club
money Is In a restricted fund and
can be used only for men's schol
arships.
Besides removing gender re
strictions from funds raised, mer
ging the two clubs will also save
money, according to Geiger.
"It enables me to get more en
ergy out of a 22-cent stamp."
Geiger said. Currently, many
alumni receive separate solicita
tion pitches from the Buck and
Cardinal clubs.
But some members of the Buck
Club believe a merger will actually
reduce the amount of money
raised for scholarships.
According to 1962 graduate
Frank Atkinson, a former chair
man of the Buck Club, some club
members believe that one
combined donation might
amount to less than the Athletic
Department receives from the two
checks in separate solicitations.
Geiger acknowledged that argu
ment, but said that the people
making it are responding more
emotionally than logically.
