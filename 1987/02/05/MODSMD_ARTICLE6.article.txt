# Police say they can decide cause of Cox's death

### MARK LAWRENCE Senior staff writer 
Friends of Allan Cox, dean of the
School of Earth Sciences who died
In a bicycle crash last week, say a
detective for the San Mateo
County Sheriffs Department over
stepped his authority In attribut
ing the death to suicide, but offi
cers say it is normal police proce
dure to state a cause of death,
even before the coroner's final
report is available.
San Mateo County Lt. Richard
McKillip said that while final au
thority to determine-the cause of
death in such cases rests with the
coroner, police often find evidence
that leads them to their own con
clusions, which they can include
in police reports and public state
ments long before the coroner's
report is complete. From the facts
surrounding Cox's bicycle crash,
it was "obvious" that the death
was suicide, McKillip said.
The chief investigator for the
San Mateo County Coroner's Of
fice, David Fortman, said,
however, that only his office can
determine cause of death. Acting
Earth Sciences Dean George

Thompson said in a Jan. 30 letter
to students, staff and faculty in
the department that he was told
the coroner was "furious" that the
officer investigating the crash
gave "unauthorized speculations"
about the cause of death.
But Fortman on Tuesday
refused to answer questions about
the way the sheriff department
handled the case. He said results
of toxicology tests will not be
availible for at least three to four
weeks.
Cox, who is internationally
known for his work in paleomag
netism and plate tectonics theory,
was killed Jan. 27 when his
bicycle ran off the road and hit a
tree in the hills near his Woodside
home. What at first appeared to be
an accident was called into ques
tion the next day when San Mateo
County Detective Michael Dirick
son said the crash was more likely
suicide, possibly to avoid a pend
ing criminal complaint against
Cox for child molestation.
Dirickson said there was strong
evidence pointing to suicide. Cox
rode his bicycle straight off
