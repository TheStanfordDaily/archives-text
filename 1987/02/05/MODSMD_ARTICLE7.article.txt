# Farm puts on campaign show

### ERIC RICHARDSON Staff writer 
University President Donald Kennedy and a host of
other high-ranking Stanford officials tried out their
sales pitch for the Stanford Centennial campaign on
the national media yesterday, kicking off a five-year,
•l. I -billion fund-raising drive that promises to be
the most ambitious in the history of American
higher education.
Reporters from newspapers as far away as Boston
and Chicago, as well as representatives of the wire
services, Time and Newsweek, were on hand as Ken
nedy tried to show the country exactly why Stanford
and other "elite" private Institutions "look so rich,
yet feel so poor."
Kennedy said Stanford has to combat the notion

that "we (elite, private institu
tions) are big and rich and don't
need (the money) and don't merit
it"in seeking donations for the
Centennial. He pointed to the
"terrible depreciation" of research
facilities, an increasingly competi
tive market for top-quality faculty
and hostile attitudes among
federal policymakers toward taxa
tion and student aid as the key
elements motivating the large
Centennial campaign.
Vice President for Development
Henry Riggs explained that the
Centennial's goal of raising $1.1
billion by 1991, including $567
million in specific "featured cam
paign objectives." will surpass
Princeton's record-setting $410-
million campaign ended in 1985.
Riggs also noted that a $557 mil

lion fund-raiser is getting under
way at the University of Southern
California.
The "greatest challenge in this
campaign," Riggs said, involves
finding donors to give $180 mil
lion for renovation of science and

engineering facilities in the 41-
acre Near West Campus. Specific
projects would include construct
ing about 20 new science build
ings, making the science facilities
more accessible to the main
campus and leveling the above

ground portions of the High En
ergy Physics Lab (HEPL).
To emphasize the deterioration
of science facilities. Kennedy and
acting Provost Robert Street led
the reporters on a tour of the west
side of campus. Street pointed to
three "smokestack-shaped
structures" protruding from the
roof of the McCullough building as
evidence of increasing require
ments for cleanliness and human
safety that necessitate renovation
of facilities. In the basement of
HEPL, reporters were shown a
super-collider — state of the art
technology 20 years ago — which
stood amid a clutter of tools and
aluminum foil.
In addition to facilities con
struction. Centennial campaign
objectives include $160 million for
100 new endowed professorships.
Kennedy noted that most of these
professorships will be in the
humanities and "softer" social
sciences.

Norman Wessells, dean of
Humanities and Sciences, ex
plained that increasing competi
tion for top-quality faculty re
quires Stanford to raise teaching
salaries in order to retain the na
tion's best professors. "New
schools entering seriously into the
research level — for example
Carnegie-Mellon, Virginia. Geor
gia. Florida, Tennessee and Texas
— all are increasing the competi
tion for and cost of top-level fac
ulty in the marketplace," he said.
Furthermore, the campaign
aims to raise *95 million for a va
riety of programs benefitting un
dergraduates — including a new
dormitory complex, major
reconstruction of Encina Gym
and *25 million for undergradu
ate scholarships.
Stanlord is well on its way
toward reaching the *1.1 -billion
goal, having already received a
"nucleus" of *307 million. Riggs
said.
