Senate approves highway bill
WASHINGTON — The Senate overwhelmingly passed a *65.4
billion transportation bill yesterday that would allow states to set
a speed limit of 65 mph on rural highways and would Include mil
lions of dollars for the Los Angeles Metro Rail transit line.
"There are several battles left to fight," said Sen. Pete Wilson, R-
Callf., who helped sidetrack two attempts by his colleagues to
eliminate funding for the transit line.
The states and the highway-construction Industry have been
seeking passage of a transportation bill since October, when
Congress adjourned without reaching agreement, leaving funding
for hundreds of highway projects In jeopardy across the nation.
Many states said they would be unable to carry out their con
struction projects this spring If Congress did not quickly adopt a
new transportation measure.
Senate overrides water bill veto
WASHINGTON — Congress yesterday enacted a *20 billion
water cleanup bill over President Reagan's veto as the Senate
voted 86 to 14 to join the House in handing the president his first
major defeat in the Democrat-controlled 100 th Congress.
The Senate overrode the veto as it prepared to follow the House
in approving a huge highway and mass transit package that also
has drawn veto threats from the White House in what has become
a confrontational start to Reagan's relations with the new
Congress.
Congress has overridden only seven of Reagan's 60 vetoes over
the past six years, most recently last September to force the ad
ministration to impose economic sanctions against the South
African government.
The clean water bill, containing $18 billion for sewage treat
ment facilities and *2 billion for related projects over eight years,
is identical to legislation that Reagan "pocket-vetoed" after the
99th Congress adjourned last fall.
It extends the 1972 Clean Water Act by authorizing >9.6 billion
to continue direct grants for construction of treatment plants
through fiscal 1990 and *8.4 billion to establish state-run revolv
ing loan funds to finance the construction thereafter. It also au
thorizes *400 million for a new program to help states with
"nonpoint source pollution" from water runoff and *30 million to
help clean up the Chesapeake Bay.
Pakistan, India agree on troops
NEW DELHI — After five days of talks aimed at easing tension
along their border, India and Pakistan agreed yesterday to
withdraw several dlvisons from a strategic northern area.
They also agreed "not to attack each other" and to continue ne
gotiations for the withdrawal of at least 10 additional divisions
that will still be in place on the border.
The military face-off on the border started two weeks ago as In
dia prepared to carry out a military exercise, the largest in its his
tory, in the state of Rajasthan, adjacent to Pakistan's Sind prov
ince.
Pakistan, with an army only half the size of India's 1-milllon
man force on active duty, reacted by moving several divisions to
key northern locations, near Slalkot, across from Jammu in the
Indian state of Jammu and Kashmir, and along the Sutlej River
across from Fazllka in the state of Punjab.
India promptly moved troops Into nearby areas. By Jan. 23, ac
cording to India's Foreign Secretary Alfred Gonsalves, the situa
tion had reached a "crescendo of tension."
Iran releases Journal reporter
WASHINGTON — Iran said yesterday that it has released Wall
Street Journal reporter Gerald Seib from prison and will expel him
from the country today, five days after arresting him as a "spy for
the Zionist regime."
Seib was handed over to the Swiss Embassy in Tehran yester
day afternoon to await a commercial flight to Europe today, ac
cording to Iranian Ambassador Said Rajaie-Khorassani at the
United Nations. Iran's official news agency said Seib would be
"permanently banned from returning to Iran."
U.S. officials here and relatives in Hays, Kan., where Seib grew
up, welcomed the Iranian accounts yesterday, but remained cau
tious as they awaited his actual departure from the country that,
after inviting him and more than 50 other foreign correspondents
to visit, singled him out for detention when the visit ended.
The accounts from Tehran yesterday shed little light on the
reasons for Seib's arrest or the decision to release him just a day
after the state-run Tehran radio had labeled him a "spy for the
Zionist regime" — Iran's name for Israel. There were indications,
however, that an Investigation had convinced authorities that
Seib had acted legitimately as a journalist, and suggestions that
his detention might have resulted from rivalries among Iranian
power factions.
Democrats call for test ban
WASHINGTON — House Democrats called yesterday for enact
ment of legislation to halt U.S. nuclear testing as long as the So
viet Union continues its testing moratorium. That signaled the
start of what is expected to a year-long battle between Congress
and the White House over arms-control policy.
"This represents a fundamental disagreement between the pres
ident and Congress" on the policy. House Democratic Caucus
Chairman Richard Gephardt of Missouri said after the caucus
voted without audible dissent to approve a resolution calling for
the legislation.
The action occurred a day after the Reagan administration con
ducted its first underground nuclear test of 1987, which some
lawmakers said prompted Democrats to strengthen the resolution
to include a call for legislation rather than a non-binding appeal to
President Reagan to curtail testing.
The move came as Senate GOP conservatives met with National
Security Adviser Frank Carluccl in an apparently Inconclusive ef
fort to decide how to handle two nuclear-test treaties pending at
the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.
America wins back its cup
FREMANTLE, Australia — On a day that will live in yachting
history, the first American to lose sailing's greatest prize became
the first to win it back. What went Down Under is coming back up.
Yesterday. Dennis Conner sailed Stars & Stripes to an easy, 1-
mlnute 59-second victory that completed a 4-0 sweep over
Kookaburra 111 in the only Cup final ever held outside the United
States.
Conner. 44. invited his entire team to the foot of the stage at the
Fremantle Port Authority, and up to the stage they marched. 35
strong — trimmers, grinders, navigators, sewermen and all their
backups — to listen while U.S. Ambassador Bill Lane broadcast by
phone a message from President Reagan.

a confrontational start to Reagan's relations with the new
Congress.
Congress has overridden only seven of Reagan's 60 vetoes over
the past six years, most recently last September to force the ad
ministration to impose economic sanctions against the South
African government.
The clean water bill, containing $18 billion for sewage treat
ment facilities and *2 billion for related projects over eight years,
is identical to legislation that Reagan "pocket-vetoed" after the
99th Congress adjourned last fall.
It extends the 1972 Clean Water Act by authorizing >9.6 billion
to continue direct grants for construction of treatment plants
through fiscal 1990 and *8.4 billion to establish state-run revolv
ing loan funds to finance the construction thereafter. It also au
thorizes *400 million for a new program to help states with
"nonpoint source pollution" from water runoff and *30 million to
help clean up the Chesapeake Bay.
Pakistan, India agree on troops
NEW DELHI — After five days of talks aimed at easing tension
along their border, India and Pakistan agreed yesterday to
withdraw several dlvisons from a strategic northern area.
They also agreed "not to attack each other" and to continue ne
gotiations for the withdrawal of at least 10 additional divisions
that will still be in place on the border.
The military face-off on the border started two weeks ago as In
dia prepared to carry out a military exercise, the largest in its his
tory, in the state of Rajasthan, adjacent to Pakistan's Sind prov
ince.
Pakistan, with an army only half the size of India's 1-milllon
man force on active duty, reacted by moving several divisions to
key northern locations, near Slalkot, across from Jammu in the
Indian state of Jammu and Kashmir, and along the Sutlej River
across from Fazllka in the state of Punjab.
India promptly moved troops Into nearby areas. By Jan. 23, ac
cording to India's Foreign Secretary Alfred Gonsalves, the situa
tion had reached a "crescendo of tension."
Iran releases Journal reporter
WASHINGTON — Iran said yesterday that it has released Wall
Street Journal reporter Gerald Seib from prison and will expel him
from the country today, five days after arresting him as a "spy for
the Zionist regime."
Seib was handed over to the Swiss Embassy in Tehran yester
day afternoon to await a commercial flight to Europe today, ac
cording to Iranian Ambassador Said Rajaie-Khorassani at the
United Nations. Iran's official news agency said Seib would be
"permanently banned from returning to Iran."
U.S. officials here and relatives in Hays, Kan., where Seib grew
up, welcomed the Iranian accounts yesterday, but remained cau
tious as they awaited his actual departure from the country that,
after inviting him and more than 50 other foreign correspondents
to visit, singled him out for detention when the visit ended.
The accounts from Tehran yesterday shed little light on the
reasons for Seib's arrest or the decision to release him just a day
after the state-run Tehran radio had labeled him a "spy for the
Zionist regime" — Iran's name for Israel. There were indications,
however, that an Investigation had convinced authorities that
Seib had acted legitimately as a journalist, and suggestions that
his detention might have resulted from rivalries among Iranian
power factions.
Democrats call for test ban
WASHINGTON — House Democrats called yesterday for enact
ment of legislation to halt U.S. nuclear testing as long as the So
viet Union continues its testing moratorium. That signaled the
start of what is expected to a year-long battle between Congress
and the White House over arms-control policy.
"This represents a fundamental disagreement between the pres
ident and Congress" on the policy. House Democratic Caucus
Chairman Richard Gephardt of Missouri said after the caucus
voted without audible dissent to approve a resolution calling for
the legislation.
The action occurred a day after the Reagan administration con
ducted its first underground nuclear test of 1987, which some
lawmakers said prompted Democrats to strengthen the resolution
to include a call for legislation rather than a non-binding appeal to
President Reagan to curtail testing.
The move came as Senate GOP conservatives met with National
Security Adviser Frank Carluccl in an apparently Inconclusive ef
fort to decide how to handle two nuclear-test treaties pending at
the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.

FREMANTLE, Australia — On a day that will live in yachting
history, the first American to lose sailing's greatest prize became

mlnute 59-second victory that completed a 4-0 sweep over

States.
Conner. 44. invited his entire team to the foot of the stage at the
Fremantle Port Authority, and up to the stage they marched. 35

backups — to listen while U.S. Ambassador Bill Lane broadcast by
phone a message from President Reagan.

Senate approves highway bill
WASHINGTON — The Senate overwhelmingly passed a *65.4
billion transportation bill yesterday that would allow states to set
a speed limit of 65 mph on rural highways and would Include mil
lions of dollars for the Los Angeles Metro Rail transit line.
"There are several battles left to fight," said Sen. Pete Wilson, R-
Callf., who helped sidetrack two attempts by his colleagues to
eliminate funding for the transit line.
The states and the highway-construction Industry have been
seeking passage of a transportation bill since October, when
Congress adjourned without reaching agreement, leaving funding
for hundreds of highway projects In jeopardy across the nation.
Many states said they would be unable to carry out their con
struction projects this spring If Congress did not quickly adopt a
new transportation measure.
Senate overrides water bill veto
WASHINGTON — Congress yesterday enacted a *20 billion
water cleanup bill over President Reagan's veto as the Senate
voted 86 to 14 to join the House in handing the president his first
major defeat in the Democrat-controlled 100 th Congress.
The Senate overrode the veto as it prepared to follow the House
in approving a huge highway and mass transit package that also
has drawn veto threats from the White House in what has become
a confrontational start to Reagan's relations with the new
Congress.
Congress has overridden only seven of Reagan's 60 vetoes over
