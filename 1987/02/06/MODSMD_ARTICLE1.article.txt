# Poli Sci under the sky
## 
### 
Taking advantage of the unusually warm weather, political science graduate student and teaching
assistant Richard Steinberg led his flock of Political Science 1 students outdoors for yesterday's
class. The warm weather, as well as the Poli Sci 1 class, is expected to continue for at least the next
few days.
