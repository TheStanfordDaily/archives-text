# Visits to CAPS up by 30 percent
## 
### MARY K. McDEVITT Senior staff writer 
More students than ever are seeking profes
sional psychological counseling here, accord
ing to University experts.
And if this quarter is like most winters at
Stanford, students are having more trouble
sleeping, stomaching food and thinking
straight than they will have during the rest of
the year.
An annual report written by Dr. Vincent
D'Andrea. director of Counseling and Psycho
logical Services (CAPS) at Cowell Student
Health Center, revealed an approximate 30
percent increase over recent years in student
visits for 1984-85 and 1985-86. As expected,
much of the increase accompanied the intro
duction of group and workshop programs, ac
cording to D'Andrea.
More striking Is the increase in "emergency"
visits, which nearly doubled last year. Of the
more than 1,400 students who visited CAPS
last year, or about one in every 10 of the total
population. 3.1 percent came In for emergency
help. In 1984, the figure was 1.7 percent.
University officials aren't sure how to ex
plain the increase. It may be that students are
having more difficulty coping with stress, al
though that seems unlikely, officials said.
Students have always felt a lot of stress but
may not have known about readily available
University help, according to Norm Robinson,

associate dean of Student Affairs. "If people are
more aware of the services provided," he said,
"the Import or severity (of the crisis) may make
them feel that they need to tend to It right
now."
Last year's Increase In emergencies "may be
an artifact," D'Andrea said. Callers may em
phasize that their needs are urgent In order to
get Immediate appointments. Resident assis
tants and faculty also may be encouraging
greater numbers of students to go to CAPS.
D'Andrea said.
Each year, winter quarter seems to be stu
dents' worst.
The pressure-packed 10-week quarter has a
cumulative effect," he said. "Either you get it
done In 10 weeks, or It carries over." In the
middle of the academic year with summer
vacation seeming far off. "It's make-or-break
time for many people," D'Andrea said.
The types of problems students bring to
CAPS have not changed substantially over the
past five years, according to D'Andrea. The
most common problems are conflicts with In
timates, feelings of depression or anxiety, is
sues of self-concept and academic planning.
Eating disorders accounted for about 5.5
percent of CAPS visits, concerns related to
sexual functioning about 5 percent and prob
lems of substance use about 1.7 percent.
About 55 students last year sought help for
suicidal or psycho-pathological problems, in
cluding suicidal and pychotic thinking.

However, there have been no student suicides
on campus In the past several years, according
to D'Andrea.
CAPS visitors come from all student groups.
The report found:
□ Of more than 1,400 student visitors last
year, about 57 percent were women. 12 per
cent of them married.
□ Approximately 42 percent of visitors were
male students, with the number of graduate
students on the rise.
□ Visits by minority students coincided with
the minority representation in the student
population.
Not all students go to CAPS with personal
crises. Some want to speak to professional
counselors "for positive reasons." D'Andrea
added. "They want to figure something out, to
problem-solve. They see it as a resource rather
than as a last resort."
Most CAPS visitors expressed high satisfac
tion with the services they received, according
to a 1983-84 survey. The most common com
plaint concerned occasionally having to wait
several days for an appointment.
CAPS therapists are expanding their
services. The staff will soon be adding a
woman who specializes in counseling lesbians.
The office is also focusing on issues unique to
minority women and to women who may have
been sexually assaulted at a younger age. The
latter problem "looks much more prevalent
than people thought." D'Andrea said.

sional psychological counseling here, accord
