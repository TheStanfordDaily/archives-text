## THE
						STANFORD DAILY An Independent Newspaper Once in 100 years 
### 
Henry Riggs, University vice president for
Development, put on his favorite bow tie
Wednesday, and he and other high-ranking
Stanford officials threw a fast pitch to repre
sentatives of major league news organiza
tions. It was no 1974 Ford Pinto they un
veiled, however â€” they announced the un
precedented drive to raise * 1.1 billion for the
University.
Yes folks, this is Centennial time; sched
uled to occur only once in Stanford's history,
it is unique even if we choose to ignore it. It
is important even if we, as students, are gone
when the celebration is over and the last
checks are cashed.
The Centennial represents much more
than a chance to bring in the bucks,
however. The occasion allows us to celebrate
ourselves and the institution that will stay
with us for the rest of our lives, whether or
not we give millions of dollars a la Hewlett
and Packard. In addition, the Centennial is
more than a party in the Quad, pomp and
circumstance, and a hearty pat on our col
lective back. The Centennial marks an im
portant opportunity to assess where we are
and where we should go.
We need to set our priorities. Especially im
portant are the 100 endowed professorships
to be funded by Centennial money. We must
honestly look ahead to the years when the

University of Texas and other institutions
will have enough money to "buy" professors
away from Stanford and other elite private
institutions. Thus, the Centennial is a fine
time to reaffirm Stanford's commitment to
undergraduate education. Also, the im
provements of facilities, including Encina
Gym and various science buildings, are
needed. We can't just rest on our laurels; we
must be able to compete.
As Buckaroo Banzai said: "Wherever you
go, there you are." We should accept this as
truth and decide where we are going for our
selves. Read one of the histories of Stanford
and learn the significance of this University,
what it represents. But go a step further and
ask if it is living up to its purpose. What
needs to be improved? What needs to be
changed, strengthened, reaffirmed, obliter
ated? Let us tell the University what to do
with the money it is raising in our name, and
in the name of students to follow.
Undergraduates can take advantage of
some amazing Centennial events: fine
speakers, parties, processions and the like.
But students should also think about what
Stanford means, and what it should mean,
and act on their findings.
And remember the words of Mick Jagger,
"You can't always get what you want, but if
you try sometimes, you get what you need."
