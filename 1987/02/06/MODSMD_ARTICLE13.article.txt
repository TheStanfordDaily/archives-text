Dollie auditions
open to all men
In response to the recent edito
rial "Guys and Dollies," (Daily,
Feb 3) I pose one question — who
said men were banned from Dollie
auditions?
Dollie tryouts are open to all
Stanford students, regardless of
gender. In the past, however, the
showing has been overwhelm
ingly female.
Should any students wish to
audition for the self
choreographed. self-governed
Dollie team — they are not
"cheerleaders" — the first
practice will be held on Monday,
February 9, at 3 p.m., outside the
Band Shak. I hope to see some
Daily editors there.

Column sexist
In his first column of the new
volume (Daily, Feb. 2), Allen C.
Estes has once again demon
strated his unique style of jour
nalism. Mr. Estes' column on
surrogate parenting not only
displays his usual chauvinistic
opinions, but also a pervasive
lack of thought and profundity.
In a column that is supposed to
concern itself with the legality
and enforceability of surrogate
motherhood, Mr. Estes states
that, "surrogate parenting should
certainly be more legal than abor
tion, since it is creating a life
rather than destroying one." The
Supreme Court did not legalize
abortion to destroy lives, but to
reaffirm the rights of those
already alive. Abortion, in a
strictly legal sense, is simply the
right of a woman to be in control
of her own body. Although some
people may agree with Mr. Estes'
opinion that abortion is the
destruction of life, the courts
have legalized abortion on
grounds not directly related to
this issue. We would like Mr.
Estes to explain how he came to
believe that one law can be "more
legal" than another.
Mr. Estes continues his column
with this statement: "A woman
who wants to avoid stopping
work or wants to preserve her
figure would be sorely tempted (to
employ a surrogate mother)."
Couples who employ surrogate
mothers do so because they are
physically unable to have
children. Surrogate mothers
provide an option to these
couples who so desperately desire
a child. However. Mr. Estes does
not concern himself with the
problems experienced by. or the
precautions necessary to protect,
these couples and the surrogates.
Instead, he creates a vain, super
ficial woman, who would be
"sorely tempted" to use a sur
rogate mother because "morning
sickiness. extra weight and labor
pains are not a bargain." The real
women who employ surrogates
would gladly go through the pains
of pregnancy, if only they were
able. Unfortunately for his
column. Mr. Estes does not write
about the real situation, but
concerns himself with this sexist
creation that is more concerned
with the preservation of its figure

than the creation of human life.
The real disappointment of Mr.
Estes' column is that he poorly
addresses a subject that demands
everyone's attention. In his con
clusion, Mr. Estes says that he
has no solutions because it is
difficult even to define the ques
tions and their implications. If
only he had expanded on the
"certain precautions (that) are
needed for both parties," perhaps
we too could attempt to under
stand fully the questions sur
rounding the subject of surrogate
moth-erhood. Unfortunately for
all, he was sidetracked from this
subject, and a promising article
degenerated into sexist assump
tions and generalizations.

Bad Res Ed idea
It baffles me that a University
that loudly espouses its
"diversity" should implement
policies of segregation. I am
speaking about the Res Ed re
commendation to eliminate fresh
man dorm choices. Recent con
troversy over theme houses seems
to reflect a campus-wide concern
about segregating housing
leading to a lack of diversity. Yet
at least those who live in a theme
house choose to live there. Fresh
men, on the other, hand have no
choice in the matter — they live
where assigned.
Res Ed proposes to assign
freshman to dorms by their West
ern Culture tract. I wonder at the
logic behind this proposal. Does
Res Ed think that those who
choose a similar Western Culture
track will get along better? Obvi
ously, this is nonsense; most of
us choose our track by reading a
one-paragraph blurb sent in the
mail. This hardly reflects our
personalities. Does Res Ed hope
to facilitate academic and/or
social interaction? Since we
already meet those people in our
Western Culture track at lecture
and section, isn't it far better that
we meet an entirely different
group of people in our dorms?
And what about an exchange of
ideas? Often I learned a lot more
about a work I was studying for
my Western Culture class in dis
cussions with my roommate, who
was In an entirely different track
and thus could present a new
angle on the work.
I can also foresee at least one
distressing problem that may
ensue If this recommendation is
implemented — namely, that
incoming frosh may start to
choose their Western Culture
track In order to live in a desired
dorm, not by their academic in
terest. Thus a pro-fro may be told
not to choose Literature and the
Arts so as not to be "stuck" in
Wilbur, or to pick Conflict and
Change to get Into Branner.
One last point. Assoc Dean for
Student Affairs Norm Robinson
seems to think that "the differ
ence really Isn't that major" be
tween all-frosh and four-class
dorms. And History Prof. Albert
Camarillo says that students "end
up being pretty happy with the
dormitory" they are assigned no

matter what the choice. Oh really
guys? Just talk to my friends and
me who lived in Loro (frosh popu
lation: 19) last year as freshmen,
and then go talk to those who
spent last year In Branner (frosh
population: about 180) and tell
me that we are all equally happy
with our dormitories as freshmen
and that the differences weren't
major. Well, I'd choose a Western
Culture track that assigned me to
Branner over one in Loro
anytime.

Protect animals
The recent death notice for
animal rights couldn't be more
wrong. Only 124 years ago in
America human beings were
property to be beaten, abused or
murdered — some slaves were
treated very well, of course, as
valuable race horses and show
dogs are now. Anti-slavery adv
ocates were labeled foolish and
destructive by those we now con
sider to have been morally obtuse
and spritually dead.
More and more people are
waking up to see that animals are
not objects, that we cannot
destroy life to get life and that the
pain of other beings can never
heal us. We should ask ourselves
how many hours would we be
willing to watch an animal suffer
to "save" our lives. I have to an
swer — none.

SDlfilm unfair
In a recent article (Daily, Feb.
3), about STAND (Stanford Action
for Nuclear Disarmament) and
their attempt to make February
"SDI Awareness Month." A repre
sentative of STAND was quoted as
saying that the film, "Star Wars:
The Search for Security." is
"neutral on SDI." Similar claims
to neutrality were made on
various fliers advertising the
showing of this film in Roble Hall.
On Monday, Feb. 2, STAND
made its presentation in Roble
Hall. As students interested in
SDI, we were there to see this
"impartial" film. Unfortunately,
we were soon disappointed.
The bias of the film came out in
many ways. Opponents of SDI
outnumbered proponents by a
wide margin, and always had the
last word. The narrator of the
film, who tried to appear ob
jective. systematically manip
ulated the discussion; by the end
of the film, he appealed to viewers
to write to their congressmen and
to the president in opposition to
SDI. After the film, even the
STAND representatives did not
dispute the fact that the film was
extremely one-sided.
We do not question STAND'S
right to present its views on cur
rent defense issues. However, we
feel thai it is misleading for
STAND to claim that the film is
neutral when it actually only
advocates one side of the issue.
