# Scandal is in the name
## 
### 
Americans love a scandal, especially the media and
politicians. Word of Oval Office wrongdoing sends
reporters scurrying across the newsroom floor, hot
in pursuit of the elusive lead. For legislators lucky
enough to be In on the fun (assuming of course that
they are not involved and belong to the other party),
the ill deeds represent front-page coverage and near
crusader status.

Unfortunately, the Iran-contra controversy, while
it has been top-of-the-news for months now, has
failed to capture the imagination of the American
public. Polls Indicate that Interest in the scandal Is
evaporating. Only a very small, and declining, por
tion of Americans believe that the Iran mess is of
central importance to the country.
The problem with the Reagan administration's di
lemma is that no one can quite figure out what to call
it; the scandal lacks a properly awe-inspiring name.
Some have labeled the affair "Irangate." But this is
little more than a misguided blast of nostalgia.
Others are advocating the term "Contraversy." Puns,
however, have never held much definitional appeal
for the Amercian public.
Scandals of the past had grand, important
sounding names that conjured up images of smokey
rooms, sneaky deals and sordid secrets. Teapot
Dome, Credit Mobilier, the Whiskey Ring and the
Bay of Pigs seem so impressive compared to
"Irangate."
Things just haven't been the same since
Watergate. Scandal names probably will never be
able to match the overpowering guilt and monstrous
evil that the word Watergate engenders.
The media czars of today seem particularly unable
and unwilling to break the death-lock Watergate
holds on wrongdoing. Every scandal name now must
have the requisite "gate" attached to its end — hence
"Irangate" or "Contragate" or even "Insert-your
scandal-name-here-gate." The innocent word "gate"
has been transformed into the most imposing suffix
in the American political dialect.
Watergate. The very mundaneness of the word
highlights its terrible monstrosity. Perhaps that is
the heart of the problem — government wrong
doings have become too commonplace. Scandal just
does not have the romantic connotations it used to
hold. Repeated occurrence of bad deeds has shrunk
scandal; it is no longer large enough to satiate
America's desire for gossip.
Americans have long strlved to maintain an air of
innocence and purity in political affairs. This is not
to say that Americans do not enjoy reaping he
benefits of covert, somewhat illegal activities. They
just don't like to hear about the the costs. The means
might justify the ends, but only If the means aren't
known.

Before the break-In In at the Watergate Hotel and
the Nixon administration's subsequent cover-up.
Americans could always close their eyes to the not
so-nice machinations of big government. Govern
ment action, aided by public complicity, led to ClA
instigated coups in Iran in 1953 and Guatemala in
1954. which hardly raised an eyebow. Americans
liked the fact that the dreaded left-leaning rulers
were sent fleeing. Blows for democracy felt all too
good.
Watergate, however, shattered the illusion. The
American public has come to expect covert,
sometimes sneaky and duplicltious behavior. Polls
show that most Americans do not think Reagan has
been talking straight to them about the Iran affair.
But the polls also reveal that this is no more than
they expect from any public figure. Watergate
crushed any pretensions to moral superiority and
purity.
Only a fool could think that secret, and occasion
ally illegal, acts do not occur; it is just that dirty
deeds usually are not found out. Granted, Americans
have never stopped expecting their leaders to be per
sonally upstanding and honest. The only really good
nasty deeds that still can cater to the American fancy
involve secret, naughty deals on a personal level —
like Abscam. There is a large difference, however, be
tween secret deeds done to promote the Interest of
the country and to enhance Individual wealth and In
fluence.
Secrecy is a necessary part of government activity.
Meaningful negotiations between countries certainly
would not occur if all discussion were served for
public consumption. Deals between the United
States and other nations are made behind the scenes
and only later are the details laid before the public
eye — complete with an administration's well
developed interpretation.
Covert activities are often the easiest methods
available for protecting certain paramount U.S. In
terests, such as the security of the Western Hemi
sphere. It is doubtful, for example, that any Ameri
can president would allow an elected Mexican gov
ernment to stand that attempted to forge a close mili
tary alliance with the Soviet Union. Secret, perhaps
illegal, interference with a sovereign nation, while
unpalatable to most Americans, is still often a matter
of national necessity.
Unfortunately, the conduct of covert activity re
quires a certain distillation of responsibility from top
officials to the operatives In the field. As in most
walks of life, people sometimes overstep the bound
aries of authority. The perpetrators of, as well as
scapegoats for, the "Irantroversy" will be found and
punished. But while Oliver North might not be the
kind of man you want marrying your daughter, it
does not appear that he set up the arms-for-contras
deal In order to line the walls of his house with dollar
bills. Scandals that involve the conduct of covert
policies of government just can't keep the viewing
public in a fevered pitch.
Since Watergate, secret, not always entirely legal,
government activity has seemed so run-of-the-mill. It
has been.

Editor's notes

Americans love a scandal, especially the media and
politicians. Word of Oval Office wrongdoing sends
reporters scurrying across the newsroom floor, hot
in pursuit of the elusive lead. For legislators lucky
enough to be In on the fun (assuming of course that
they are not involved and belong to the other party),
the ill deeds represent front-page coverage and near
crusader status.

Unfortunately, the Iran-contra controversy, while
it has been top-of-the-news for months now, has
failed to capture the imagination of the American
public. Polls Indicate that Interest in the scandal Is
evaporating. Only a very small, and declining, por
tion of Americans believe that the Iran mess is of
central importance to the country.
The problem with the Reagan administration's di
lemma is that no one can quite figure out what to call
it; the scandal lacks a properly awe-inspiring name.
Some have labeled the affair "Irangate." But this is
little more than a misguided blast of nostalgia.
Others are advocating the term "Contraversy." Puns,
however, have never held much definitional appeal
for the Amercian public.
Scandals of the past had grand, important
sounding names that conjured up images of smokey
rooms, sneaky deals and sordid secrets. Teapot
Dome, Credit Mobilier, the Whiskey Ring and the
Bay of Pigs seem so impressive compared to
"Irangate."
Things just haven't been the same since
Watergate. Scandal names probably will never be
able to match the overpowering guilt and monstrous
evil that the word Watergate engenders.
The media czars of today seem particularly unable
and unwilling to break the death-lock Watergate
holds on wrongdoing. Every scandal name now must
have the requisite "gate" attached to its end — hence
"Irangate" or "Contragate" or even "Insert-your
scandal-name-here-gate." The innocent word "gate"
has been transformed into the most imposing suffix
in the American political dialect.
Watergate. The very mundaneness of the word
highlights its terrible monstrosity. Perhaps that is
the heart of the problem — government wrong
doings have become too commonplace. Scandal just
does not have the romantic connotations it used to
hold. Repeated occurrence of bad deeds has shrunk
scandal; it is no longer large enough to satiate
America's desire for gossip.
Americans have long strlved to maintain an air of
innocence and purity in political affairs. This is not
to say that Americans do not enjoy reaping he
benefits of covert, somewhat illegal activities. They
just don't like to hear about the the costs. The means
might justify the ends, but only If the means aren't
known.

Before the break-In In at the Watergate Hotel and
the Nixon administration's subsequent cover-up.
Americans could always close their eyes to the not
so-nice machinations of big government. Govern
ment action, aided by public complicity, led to ClA
instigated coups in Iran in 1953 and Guatemala in
1954. which hardly raised an eyebow. Americans
liked the fact that the dreaded left-leaning rulers
were sent fleeing. Blows for democracy felt all too
good.
Watergate, however, shattered the illusion. The
American public has come to expect covert,
sometimes sneaky and duplicltious behavior. Polls
show that most Americans do not think Reagan has
been talking straight to them about the Iran affair.
But the polls also reveal that this is no more than
they expect from any public figure. Watergate
crushed any pretensions to moral superiority and
purity.
Only a fool could think that secret, and occasion
ally illegal, acts do not occur; it is just that dirty
deeds usually are not found out. Granted, Americans
have never stopped expecting their leaders to be per
sonally upstanding and honest. The only really good
nasty deeds that still can cater to the American fancy
involve secret, naughty deals on a personal level —
like Abscam. There is a large difference, however, be
tween secret deeds done to promote the Interest of
the country and to enhance Individual wealth and In
fluence.
Secrecy is a necessary part of government activity.
Meaningful negotiations between countries certainly
would not occur if all discussion were served for
public consumption. Deals between the United
States and other nations are made behind the scenes
and only later are the details laid before the public
eye — complete with an administration's well
developed interpretation.
Covert activities are often the easiest methods
available for protecting certain paramount U.S. In
terests, such as the security of the Western Hemi
sphere. It is doubtful, for example, that any Ameri
can president would allow an elected Mexican gov
ernment to stand that attempted to forge a close mili
tary alliance with the Soviet Union. Secret, perhaps
illegal, interference with a sovereign nation, while
unpalatable to most Americans, is still often a matter
of national necessity.

quires a certain distillation of responsibility from top
