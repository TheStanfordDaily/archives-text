## Festivities as business ventures Party planning not all profits and losses 
### LAURA LEWIS STEVEN LURIE 
"Work hard, play hard" Is a motto often
used to describe Stanford students.
The work usually takes place in the dim
recesses of either Meyer or Green Libra
ries.
The play often centers around parties.
Parties are a major social activity and a
way for students to take a break from
studying. Parties can be room gatherings,
dorm get-togethers, all-campus bashes,
fraternity mixers and business ventures.
Business ventures?
Although not necessarily profit-seeking
in nature, parties involve logistics, such
as marketing and planning, that often
characterize a business.
Senior Pub Nights are perfect examples
of this.
According to B.G. Porter, a senior class
president, "Pub Night is a well-known
tradition. We use this fact as a marketing
point when we approach" potential
clients.
"We present the idea that Pub Night can
be mutually beneficial (for both students
and the bar). We guarantee a crowd of 50
to 100 people by advertising in The Daily
and elsewhere, and in return the bar pro
vides free food and discounted drinks."
Porter said.
Organizing these events "is a definite
business undertaking," he added.
Allison Lambird, who helped organize
the mausoleum party on Halloween,

noted that all-campus parties require re
sources from throughout the Stanford
community.
First, formal permission is needed. In
order to use University facilities for non
academic purposes, voluntary student or
ganizations must talk to Michael Ramsey-
Perez. who runs Student Organization
Services (SOS). Ramsey-Perez advises the
event planners on such matters as alcohol
policy, security, rain plans and proper
facility use.
In advertising for an event, planners
can utilize several Stanford services.
Fliers and posters are the most common
ways used to spread word of an event. The
ASSU Advertising Agency, which creates
and distributes notices, is commonly
resorted to for this service.
The least expensive method to advertise
is to place a banner in White Plaza — such
as those around the Claw.
Security plays a major role in large
Stanford parties because of the crowds
and the drunkenness.
Because the mausoleum party is held
outdoors and is easily accessible, or
ganizers must control routes to alcohol by
vigorously checking for Stanford iden
tifications. not just for a set of University
issued keys. Student monitors also con
tinuously scan the area.
Unlike the case at many universities,
Stanford parties rarely charge admission.
This is not because parties are cheap,
however. The Sigma Alpha Epsilon frater

nity spent * 1.200 on their campus-wide
party at the beginning of the year.
Fraternity bar nights generally run
about #200 and are financed by the social
dues of house members.
The total cost of a party does not end
with alcohol. University regulations re
quire that "equally attractive non

alcoholic beverages" also be served.
Costs may also include food, music and
other items that are not so obvious. For
example, the mausoleum party was
charged *2.000 "for University labor to
set up and take down barriers, tables and
lights," according to Porter.
Finally, as in any business venture,

there exists bureaucracy.
Notes Allison Lamblrd: "For the Hallo
ween party, just renting two portable
toilets required three phone calls and four
forms. We had to also work through many
Stanford agencies — primarily SOS and
Events and Services. Basically, throwing
a party required meetings and filling out
forms — lots of forms."
