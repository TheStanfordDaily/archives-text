### INGRID WICKELGREN Staff Writer 
The Santa Clara County Planning Commission
voted unanimously yesterday not to reconsider its
Dec. 4 approval of the projected site of the Ronald
Reagan Presidential Library, but reserved the right
to examine the details of the library at a later date,
according to Chief Planning Officer Bob Sturdivant.
The decision was based on the commissioners'
view that they had received all relevant information
about the library when they originally approved the
site. Sturdivant said.
Sturdivant said the issue was reopened at the
planning commission's monthly meeting because
letters of complaint from people dissatisfied with the
original 4-2 approval of the site.

The letters complained about the proposed size of
the library, the amount of traffic that will be
generated by the library and the destruction of open
space in the foothills that will occur, according to
Planning Commissioner Anne Coombs.
The letters also stated that the library Is more
likely to be a tourist attraction than an archive and
that the University had already approved smaller
buildings in the same foothills area for art studios
before the library was proposed. Coombs said.
According to Coombs, the commission decided the
information received in the mail was not new infor
mation.
Coombs said the commission decided there will be
many points later in the process of evaluating the
piano for the Reagan Library in
which specific details of the li
brary could be changed as the
commission sees fit.
She emphasized that the com
mission's original decision only
said that building the Reagan Li

brary in the foothills location was
consistent with the general plan of
the area. The decision did not ap
prove any details of the library.
Before the library plans are com
pleted. the planning commission
must certify an environmental im
pact report and approve a use per
mit for the library. In addition, the
design of the building must be ap
proved and a building permit
issued by the County Architecture

and Site Committee, according to
University Planning Director Phil
Williams.
Williams said the planning com
mission and site committee can
impose conditions on the
landscaping of the building,
parking facilities, lighting and
surrounding vegetation. He said
each step in the process involves a
public meeting where people can
voice dissent.
