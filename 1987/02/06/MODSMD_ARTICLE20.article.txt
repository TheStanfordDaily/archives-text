# Counseling safety net keeps students' heads above water
## 
### EMMA STERLAND 
Most students probably are not aware of the time
and energy that are devoted to their mental well
being at Stanford.
Resident Assistants (RAs), Resident Fellows (RFs)
and Counseling and Psychological Services at the
Cowell Student Health Center (CAPS) — all form a
part of a safety net designed to help keep students
from becoming overwhelmed by the pressures of uni
versity life.
The system at Stanford seems effective. Students
speak glowingly of their RAs and RFs, and regular
surveys show that students who use CAPS are
satisfied with the service they receive.
However, problems sometimes arise which, al
though they do not amount to significant holes in
the safety net, present difficulties for those charged
I with students' welfare.
A major problem for CAPS is catering to the needs
of the approximately 13,000 students on campus.
Dr. Vincent D'Andrea, director of CAPS, says that
despite fliers, brochures, films and advertisements
in The Daily, a survey showed that only 35 percent of
students even know CAPS exists.
One senior, who has been going to a Cowell
sponsored eating disorders group since spring, says
CAPS has been very useful.
However, she says she is the only Stanford woman
in the class. The rest are non-students.
"It's too bad that more students don't know about
the services available," she says.
According to D'Andrea, students' lack of aware
ness about CAPS is not a serious problem.
"We're not out to drum up trade; we already have
enough business, so to speak," he explains.
Despite its low profile, CAPS is already well-used.
Last year, for the first time, there was a waiting list
for students wanting to see therapists.
D'Andrea says the services at CAPS are for stu
dents with psychological problems. Other issues, he
says, should be dealt with in the dormitories by RAs
and RFs, and not at CAPS.
"It's distressing to an RA or an RF when
roommates are having a quarrel," he says, "but
that's a behavioral rathe*- than a psychological prob
lem."
Several RAs and RFs, however, say they feel that
they have too much responsibility already.
"I'm sympathetic to the difficulty they face (at
CAPS), but I'm reluctant to get the dorm people in
volved any more than they already are," says Twain
RF Denis Phillips.
"RAs spend a great deal of time talking to people,
often until two or three in the morning and often
when it's extremely inconvenient for them — for ex
ample during exam time, " he says.
Fred Cate, a Crothers Hall RA, says, "I'm always
trying to stay alert and know what's going on, but it's
really difficult." He says that, as a result, people with
serious problems sometimes escape his notice.
Roble Hall RF Ann Porteus sums up the problem:
"Overall CAPS is a necessary and good service, but
it's operating with too few resources for an over
whelming number of people to serve."

Some RFs are unhappy about the way they are
treated by CAPS, Porteus says.
"There is a general feeling of frustration among
RFs because CAPS operates on a principle of con
fidentiality," Porteus says.
"When we send students to CAPS we get no feed
back from them as to whether they are indeed seeing
our students," she explains, "That leaves a burden
on us to have to worry about whether a student who
we know is in trouble is getting help."
Porteus says she feels that CAPS does not treat RFs
as professionals.
"It's our responsibility to watch out for people in
the dorm," she says,"and it's definitely frustrating to
be left in a state of not knowing what's going on."
The RF's job can be difficult. RFs are not psych
ologists but they are responsible for the mental well
being of the students in their dorm.
They often find themselves in situations that they
are not equipped to deal with.
"Very often, someone who does need help is reluc
tant to go and get help — for example, alcoholics or
people with eating disorders," Phillip says.
"We can't force people to go for help," he explains,
"and yet we feel responsible; and probably the Uni
versity would hold us responsible."
RFs are given some training in counseling and
each year Cowell and Residential Education run edu
cational programs that the RFs attend.
Although he says that, in general, these programs
are useful, Phillips says he is slightly critical of them.
"Res Ed has ideological commitments to one thing
or another, which RFs largely share, but that
sometimes makes it seem like something is an issue
on campus when it isn't," he says.
Last year, Phillips says, there was much concern
about AIDS and the question of what to do if some
one discovered his or her roommate was gay.
"Undoubtedly it was an issue we should address."
he says, "but it seemed for a while that it was the
only relevant health issue on campus."
Many of the problems with the safety net at Stan
ford seem to be caused by a lack of communication
between CAPS, RAs and RFs.
Res Ed and CAPS both seem genuinely concerned
with students' welfare, but as Phillips points out,
each needs to be "more sympathetic to the other's
responsiblities and pressures."
