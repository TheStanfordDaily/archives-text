## Stanford trampled by UCLA, 93-62 Miller torments Card from inside and out 
### TOM SENF Editorial staff 
At the beginning of last night's game between
Stanford and UCLA, the Maples Pavilion crowd
decided to get on Reggie Miller, booing the Bruin for
ward and Imploring him to shoot every time he
touched the ball.
It didn't last long, however.
In the first eight and a half minutes, Miller showed
why many people believed that he would be the pri
mary beneficiary of the new three-point rule In col
lege basketball. The 6-foot-7 senior buried three from
beyond the three-point line without a miss to stake
the Bruins to a 19-11 lead. Stanford got closer than
this margin only once in UCLA's 93-62 blowout.
"I like the recognition," Miller said of the crowd's
attempt to unnerve him. "It shows that they're think
ing of me. I like to see how quiet they are when you
make a couple."
Miller made a couple more, but only one more
three-pointer, in the first half. With four minutes left
before halftime, the score was Reggie Miller 18, Stan
ford 17.
For the game, Miller led all scorers with 29 points,
hitting 11 of 16 shots from the field and five of six
three-pointers. "When he's shooting from 25 feet,
what can you do?" Stanford forward Bryan
McSweeney said.
"I got the ball in the right spot," Miller said. "I
couldn't complain. They were leaving people open at
28 feet. I wouldn't leave me open at 28 feet."
"They left him open, which you very seldom see,"
UCLA Coach Walt Hazzard said. "They usually pick
him up when he crosses halfcourt."
Miller entered last night's game hitting just 36 per
cent of his three-pointers, a shot he compared to "a
layup" before the season began.
"I could be doing a lot better (from three-point
range)," Miller said. "But you're not going to make
them all. Now I just go out and play."
Despite taking most of his shots from zip codes dif
ferent than the basket's. Miller is a 54 percent career
shooter. He has scored 29 or more points 17 times
and was an All-Pacific 10 Conference selection last
year.
Last night Miller became the No. 2 scorer in UCLA
history (1,782 points), surpassing Bill Walton and
trailing only Lew Alcindor (now known as Kareem
Abdul-Jabbar) â€” not bad for someone once referred
to in Sports Illustrated as the only player in UCLA
history who could not outplay his sister (ex-USC star

first-half dunk rather than on one of his patented outside bombs. Miller scored a game
