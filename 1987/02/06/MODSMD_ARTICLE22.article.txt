With 4:36 left to play in the
game, the Stanford women's
basketball team, fighting to
overcome an early deficit, had
inched back within seven
points. 63-56.
Stanford basketball coach
Tara VanDerveer is never con
tent with defeat, especially
when her team is in position to
win a game against the very
talented USC Trojans.
But in retrospect, with 4:36

have Just wished that she had

Trojans. We'll Just leave now. if
you don't mind."

Had the Cardinal quietly
slipped out of Pauley Pavilion at
that moment, it would have
been spared the wrath of an
awakening giant and a 16-1
scoring barrage.
The result was the most
lopsided close game ever
played: 79-57.
"It took a lot of work to get
within seven points." VanDer
veer said. "By getting behind
early, we had dug a hole for our
selves that we just couldn't get
out of."
As if they weren't content to
have Stanford stuck in a hole,
the Trojans promptly unloaded
a truck-full of soil upon the

subterranean Cardinal during the
final four minutes.
"They went on an absolute
rampage," VanDerveer said. "All of
the sudden they were running
faster, jumping higher and shoot
ing better.
"It was a game until the last four
minutes. It was more a matter of
what they did rather than what we
couldn't do. USC is not a good
team to get behind."
Stanford got behind early, but

some tough work under the
boards prevented a Trojan
runaway.
Led by freshman forward Katy
Steding, the Cardinal kept the
Trojans away from any offensive
rebounds. The Trojans, however,
didn't need very many second op
portunities as frontline players
Cherie Nelson and Monica Lamb
and guard Karon Howell made the
most of their attempts.
"The problem was that they shot
57 percent from the field." Van-
Derveer said. "They spread out
their offense well and passed very
well. And when their big kids got
the ball, they went right to the

basket."
Stanford's inside play, by con
trast, could not get on track of
fensively, and as a team, the Card
inal shot a sub-par 40 percent for
the game.
"I think we were intimidated."
VanDerveer said. "Our inside
players weren't going to the bas
ket, and we missed a lot of open
shots."
One Cardinal who didn't miss
was guard Charli Turner, who
came off the bench to score 14
points. Her blistering seven-of
nlne shooting performance was
the only redeeming offensive
statistic for the Cardinal.
