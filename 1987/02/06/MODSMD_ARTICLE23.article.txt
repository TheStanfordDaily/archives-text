### SUSAN SLUSSER Editorial staff 
Take that, Stanford.
UCLA forward Reggie Miller
vowed after losing to Stanford and
California last season that the
Bruins would never lose again to
their Northern California breth
ren while he was still at UCLA. A
victory over California tomorrow,
and they won't.
Taking advantage of the new
three-point line to the tune of 30
points on 10-of-14 shooting.
UCLA handed Stanford its worst
conference defeat in five seasons.
93-62, last night before 7,102 at
Maples Pavilion.
The Bruins upped their record
to 14-5 overall and 8-3 in the
Pacific 10 Conference to remain
tied for second with Arizona, a
half game behind Oregon State,
which downed Arizona State 86-
72 on the road last night. Stan
ford fell to 11-10 overall and 5-7 in
league play, and still inhabits the
seventh spot in the Pac-10.
Miller was the main UCLA
weapon, hitting 11-of-16 from the
field including 5-of-6 from three
point range. The senior forward
was also perfect from the line,
sinking two-of-two to total a game
high 29 points. In the first half
alone, Miller scored 18 points.
"They came out in a zone and
there was a gap," Miller said, "My
teammmates found me, and
things were falling."
It was a record-setting outing
for Miller, who passed UCLA great
Bill Walton to move into second
place on the all-time Bruin scoring
list with 1,782. But it may have
been Miller's defensive effort that
hurt the Cardinal the most, as the
UCLA star was assigned Todd
Lichti in the Bruins' man-to-man
defense. Lichti scored a career-low
four points.
"Reggie is an all-around talent,"
Stanford Coach Mike Montgomery

said. "They put him on Todd, and
he accepted the challenge. Maybe
Todd was a little frustrated. He
ended up 2 for 9, and that isn't
like him."
Lichti, who is averaging 17.7
points per game, has scored just
eight points in the last three
halves he has played, and did not
score in the second half against
UCLA.
"Everyone knows Todd is a good
player," Montgomery said, "and
they're putting their best players
on him. It's hard for him. it's real
difficult."
Last night's game was real diffi
cult for the entire Stanford team,
which shot 39 percent as a team
compared to UCLA's 55 percent.
"We wanted to go inside," Lichti
said."But it was obvious that
things weren't dropping for us.
Then we went outside and
couldn't hit out there. One thing
led to another and it was hard to
get back on track. It wasn't a fun
game."
The Cardinal was also out
rebounded again. 44-23, as fresh
man forward Trevor Wilson pulled
down 10 rebounds in just 19
minutes of play to lead both
teams. Lichti and guard Novian
Whitsitt led the Cardinal with four
each.
"They outrebounded us very
badly," Montgomery said. "That's
something that's been a great con
cern to us."
Stanford led early, 5-3. but the
lead was history as quick as you
can say Reggie Miller or three
point line. Miller's bombs boosted
the Bruins to a 23-11 lead nine
minutes later and 33-17 with 4:21
left in the half.
The Cardinal would have been
history by halftime save for a last
minute spurt. Greg Butler,
taunted by UCLA freshman Greg
Foster to shoot, faced him with a
19-footer from the left side. Whit
sitt hit a 10-footer and Eric
Reveno scored Inside to make It
35-25 at intermission.
The rally continued In the
second half. Reveno netted a turn
around Jumper from the left
baseline and Terry Taylor swished
a three-pointer and It was 37-30.
But the Cardinal got no closer.
Miller began scoring again, and
a pair of fast-break lay-Ins by the
human exclamation point made It
52-36. Miller's fifth three-pointer
of the evening made it 64-43 with
8:28 left, and yet another three
pointer by David Immel with three
seconds to go gave the Bruins
their first 30-point victory in more
than a season.
"I thought all the players made a
contribution all the way down to
the 12th man." UCLA Coach Walt
Hazzard said. "Dave Immel just
went crazy at the end. He just
went bonkers. ... He had one of

those left-handed, cork-screw,
lean-away shots that went In. He
was in one of those rolls where the
basket's like the ocean. Anything
you throw up goes in."
Immel finished with 20 points.
18 In the second half. Charles
Rochelln and Jermone "Pooh"
Richardson added 10 each to lead
a barrage of 11 Bruin scorers.
Only two Cardinal players
finished in double digits — Whit
sitt with 15 points and Howard
Wright with 12. Taylor, who en
tered the game shooting better
from three-point land than two.
tallied all his nine points from be
hind the stripe of paint.
The only optimistic statistic for
Stanford was turnovers. The
Cardinal committed eight, but the
Bruins weren't far behind with
nine.
"UCLA played awful well,"
Montgomery said. "Whatever we
tried, they had an answer for. We
tried to make them shoot deep,
and they sure had the answer to
that early.
"For us to beat UCLA, we have to

do everything well. And we're not
doing that right now."
The Cardinal will have its work
cut out for it Sunday afternoon at
3 against USC (KCBS 740. KZSU
90.1 FM and KPIX Channel 5).
Granted, the Cardinal has han
dled the Trojans with remarkable
ease in recent years, winning six
straight. But the young Trojans
gave Cal all It could handle last
night before losing. 56-53. and
Stanford hasn't been playing stel
lar ball of late.
The Trojans' forte is defense. In
their last six games, their oppo
nents have not topped 60 points.
In the six games previous to the
Cal contest, their foes were shoot
ing 39 percent from the floor.
Senior forward Derrick Dowell
leads the Trojans with a 20.3
points-per-game average, followed
by junior guard Brad Winslow
(9.3), freshman forward Bob Erbst
(7.6), sophomore guard Rich
Grande (7.4) and senior forward
Rod Keller (6.8). Dowell leads the
team in rebounding (8.6).

Whitsitt led the Cardinal with four
each.
"They outrebounded us very
badly," Montgomery said. "That's
something that's been a great con
cern to us."
Stanford led early, 5-3. but the
lead was history as quick as you
can say Reggie Miller or three
point line. Miller's bombs boosted
the Bruins to a 23-11 lead nine
minutes later and 33-17 with 4:21
left in the half.
The Cardinal would have been
history by halftime save for a last
minute spurt. Greg Butler,
taunted by UCLA freshman Greg
Foster to shoot, faced him with a
19-footer from the left side. Whit
sitt hit a 10-footer and Eric
Reveno scored Inside to make It
35-25 at intermission.
The rally continued In the
second half. Reveno netted a turn
around Jumper from the left
baseline and Terry Taylor swished
a three-pointer and It was 37-30.
But the Cardinal got no closer.
Miller began scoring again, and
a pair of fast-break lay-Ins by the
human exclamation point made It
52-36. Miller's fifth three-pointer
of the evening made it 64-43 with
8:28 left, and yet another three
pointer by David Immel with three
seconds to go gave the Bruins
their first 30-point victory in more
than a season.
"I thought all the players made a
contribution all the way down to
the 12th man." UCLA Coach Walt
Hazzard said. "Dave Immel just
went crazy at the end. He just
went bonkers. ... He had one of

those left-handed, cork-screw,
lean-away shots that went In. He
was in one of those rolls where the
basket's like the ocean. Anything
you throw up goes in."
Immel finished with 20 points.
18 In the second half. Charles
Rochelln and Jermone "Pooh"
Richardson added 10 each to lead
a barrage of 11 Bruin scorers.
Only two Cardinal players
finished in double digits — Whit
sitt with 15 points and Howard
Wright with 12. Taylor, who en
tered the game shooting better
from three-point land than two.
tallied all his nine points from be
hind the stripe of paint.
The only optimistic statistic for
Stanford was turnovers. The
Cardinal committed eight, but the
Bruins weren't far behind with
nine.
"UCLA played awful well,"
Montgomery said. "Whatever we
tried, they had an answer for. We
tried to make them shoot deep,
and they sure had the answer to
that early.
"For us to beat UCLA, we have to

do everything well. And we're not
doing that right now."
The Cardinal will have its work
cut out for it Sunday afternoon at
3 against USC (KCBS 740. KZSU
90.1 FM and KPIX Channel 5).
Granted, the Cardinal has han
dled the Trojans with remarkable
ease in recent years, winning six
straight. But the young Trojans
gave Cal all It could handle last
night before losing. 56-53. and
Stanford hasn't been playing stel
lar ball of late.
The Trojans' forte is defense. In
their last six games, their oppo
nents have not topped 60 points.
In the six games previous to the
Cal contest, their foes were shoot
ing 39 percent from the floor.
Senior forward Derrick Dowell
leads the Trojans with a 20.3
points-per-game average, followed
by junior guard Brad Winslow
(9.3), freshman forward Bob Erbst
(7.6), sophomore guard Rich
Grande (7.4) and senior forward
Rod Keller (6.8). Dowell leads the
team in rebounding (8.6).
Take that, Stanford.
UCLA forward Reggie Miller
vowed after losing to Stanford and
California last season that the
Bruins would never lose again to
their Northern California breth
ren while he was still at UCLA. A
victory over California tomorrow,
and they won't.
Taking advantage of the new
three-point line to the tune of 30
points on 10-of-14 shooting.
UCLA handed Stanford its worst
conference defeat in five seasons.
93-62, last night before 7,102 at
Maples Pavilion.
The Bruins upped their record
to 14-5 overall and 8-3 in the
Pacific 10 Conference to remain
tied for second with Arizona, a
half game behind Oregon State,
which downed Arizona State 86-
72 on the road last night. Stan
ford fell to 11-10 overall and 5-7 in
league play, and still inhabits the
seventh spot in the Pac-10.
Miller was the main UCLA
weapon, hitting 11-of-16 from the
field including 5-of-6 from three
point range. The senior forward
was also perfect from the line,
sinking two-of-two to total a game
high 29 points. In the first half
alone, Miller scored 18 points.
"They came out in a zone and
there was a gap," Miller said, "My
teammmates found me, and
things were falling."
It was a record-setting outing
for Miller, who passed UCLA great
Bill Walton to move into second
place on the all-time Bruin scoring
list with 1,782. But it may have
been Miller's defensive effort that
hurt the Cardinal the most, as the
UCLA star was assigned Todd
Lichti in the Bruins' man-to-man
defense. Lichti scored a career-low
four points.
"Reggie is an all-around talent,"
Stanford Coach Mike Montgomery

said. "They put him on Todd, and
he accepted the challenge. Maybe
Todd was a little frustrated. He
ended up 2 for 9, and that isn't
like him."
Lichti, who is averaging 17.7
points per game, has scored just
eight points in the last three
halves he has played, and did not
score in the second half against
UCLA.
"Everyone knows Todd is a good
player," Montgomery said, "and
they're putting their best players
on him. It's hard for him. it's real
difficult."
Last night's game was real diffi
cult for the entire Stanford team,
which shot 39 percent as a team
compared to UCLA's 55 percent.
"We wanted to go inside," Lichti
said."But it was obvious that
things weren't dropping for us.
Then we went outside and
couldn't hit out there. One thing
led to another and it was hard to
get back on track. It wasn't a fun
game."
The Cardinal was also out
rebounded again. 44-23, as fresh
man forward Trevor Wilson pulled
down 10 rebounds in just 19
minutes of play to lead both
teams. Lichti and guard Novian
Whitsitt led the Cardinal with four
each.
