# A
						Cardinal clash with the Titans
## Stanford meets No. 16 Fullerton on the road 
### TOM SENF Editorial staff 
After losing its season opener to
San Jose State, the Stanford
baseball team has shown steady
improvement in winning its next
three games. But starting this
weekend, the Cardinal will have a
chance to see just how far it has
progressed in its preparation for
the Pacific 10 Southern Division
season.
In the next three weeks. Stan
ford will play weekend series
against Fullerton State, Fresno
State and UC-Santa Barbara, all
potential NCAA tournament
teams. The Cardinal opens this
difficult stretch tonight with a 7
p.m. game at Fullerton State. The
series continues tomorrow and
finishes Sunday with 1 p.m. con
tests.
"The next three weeks will be
really tough." Stanford Coach
Mark Marquess said. "There will
be some tremendous competition
for us. but at the same time that's
the same type of people we'll play
in our league. Even though we
may take our lumps. 1 think it's
good for us."

Marquess was not sounding too
confident for the coach of the No.
4 team in the nation, but Fuller
ton State Coach Augie Garrido
was not to be outdone in the
down-playing department. "This
is an underdog team," Garrido
said before the season began. "It
will not be the favorite to win the

Pacific Coast Athletic Association
title, and it will not be ranked in
any preseason polls."
The Baseball America pollsters,
however, showed more confidence
in the Titans than Garrido did by
putting them at No. 16. Although
Fullerton has failed to reach the
NCAA tournament the past two

years. Garrido has built one of the
nation's premier baseball pro
grams. In his 14 years at the helm.
Garrido has guided the Titans to a
.692 winning percentage and two
NCAA titles (1979 and 1984).

With a difficult schedule ahead of it in the next few weeks, the inexperienced Stanford baseball team will
be looking to veterans like senior outfielder Toi Cook for stability. The fourth-ranked Cardinal opens a
three-game series with Fullerton State tonight at Fullerton.
