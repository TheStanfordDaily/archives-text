# A 						Cardinal clash with the Titans
## Stanford meets No. 16 Fullerton on the road 
### TOM SENF Editorial staff 
After losing its season opener to
San Jose State, the Stanford
baseball team has shown steady
improvement in winning its next
three games. But starting this
weekend, the Cardinal will have a
chance to see just how far it has
progressed in its preparation for
the Pacific 10 Southern Division
season.
In the next three weeks. Stan
ford will play weekend series
against Fullerton State, Fresno
State and UC-Santa Barbara, all
potential NCAA tournament
teams. The Cardinal opens this
difficult stretch tonight with a 7
p.m. game at Fullerton State. The
series continues tomorrow and
finishes Sunday with 1 p.m. con
tests.
"The next three weeks will be
really tough." Stanford Coach
Mark Marquess said. "There will
be some tremendous competition
for us. but at the same time that's
the same type of people we'll play
in our league. Even though we
may take our lumps. 1 think it's
good for us."

Marquess was not sounding too
confident for the coach of the No.
4 team in the nation, but Fuller
ton State Coach Augie Garrido
was not to be outdone in the
down-playing department. "This
is an underdog team," Garrido
said before the season began. "It
will not be the favorite to win the

Pacific Coast Athletic Association
title, and it will not be ranked in
any preseason polls."
The Baseball America pollsters,
however, showed more confidence
in the Titans than Garrido did by
putting them at No. 16. Although
Fullerton has failed to reach the
NCAA tournament the past two

years. Garrido has built one of the
nation's premier baseball pro
grams. In his 14 years at the helm.
Garrido has guided the Titans to a
.692 winning percentage and two
NCAA titles (1979 and 1984).

team that went 36-21 last season
are pitchers Larry Casian and
Mike Harkey. Casian, an All-PCAA
performer last year, went 6-1 with
a 2.84 ERA.
Harkey, along with Stanford's
Jack McDowell, was named a
preseason All-America. Last
season Harkey posted a 9-6 record
and a 3.41 ERA with 125
strikeouts in 129.1 innings.
Casian and Harkey are an im
pressive pair, but it is hard to im

aglne Stanford being at a pitching
disadvantage in any series this
year. The Cardinal staff has an
ERA of 1.29.
Marquess is counting on the
pitching and a couple of veterans
to stabilize a team dominated by
youth. "You always go through a
couple of streaks when you don't
play that well," he said.
"Hopefully, our pitching will be
consistent and allow us to get out
of those things quickly. I'm con
cerned that they (the young
players) don't get too down, but I
think that Ruben (Amaro) and Toi
(Cook) should help with that."
One young player who has not

been down at all Is freshman right
fielder Paul Carey. Carey leads the
team In batting (.500), home runs
(three) and RBIs (seven). "We don't
know whether It's a situation
where he's just on a tear or
whether he's really that good,"
Marquess said of Carey's fast
start. "We knew he was a good hit
ter, but this has been more than
we expected."
Both Rob Wassenaar and Jim
Price will pitch for Stanford
tonight, although Marquess has
not yet decided who will start. Lee
Plemel will get the call tomorrow,
with Steve Chitren going on Sun
day.
