# Swimmers look out for No. 1
## Card travels to Texas to take on top-ranked Longhorns 
### BRENDAN HEALEY Senior staff writer 
The eyes of Texas will be on the Texas Swim
ming Center tomorrow when the Stanford
women hit the pool for a 3:30 p.m. matchup
with the top-ranked Longhorns.
It's a Texas-style duel — big — and Is a
matchup between the top two teams in the
country. However, both Stanford Coach
George Haines and Texas Coach Richard
Quick are playing down the meet's Importance
as they point toward conference and NCAA
championships later in the season.
"We're not going to let up on our workouts."
Haines said. "We're going down with the Idea
of Improving. If we happen to win. that's Icing
on the cake."
According to Quick, his swimmers are
"excited about this meet, (but) what matters is

the last week in March (NCAAs are March 19-
21)."
The three-time defending national cham
pion Longhorns are on a roll after hammering
No. 3 Florida 67-46 In Gainesville and will be
looking to avenge an 85-58 loss to the Cardinal
at DeGuerre Pool last year.
Quick has so many Olympians on his squad,
one wonders if he serves ambrosia and nectar
at the training table. Seven of his charges com
peted in the Los Angeles Games in 1984. win
ning six gold medals.
And if the Longhorns can be compared to the
Greek gods, then Betsy Mitchell is their Ath
ena. Along with Stanford's Jenna Johnson
and California's Mary T. Meagher. Mitchell Is
one of the preeminent swimmers in the United
States today. She Joined Meagher as the only
American woman to win an Individual event at
last summer's World Championships, taking

the 200 meter backstroke, and holds the world
record in that event.
Mitchell, however, is fighting the lingering
effects of a flu that knocked her out of the
Florida meet. "I've been fairly sporadic since
Christmas." she said Tuesday. "We've had a
hard three or four weeks of training. I'm a little
tired and sore today."
Nonetheless. "We're real excited for the
meet." she added. "I am particularly excited to
race against Michelle (Donahue) and the other
backstrokers."
Mitchell is not the only Longhorn fighting
physical problems, as Olympian Kim Rhoden
baugh has also had the flu and Tiffany Cohen,
one of the best U.S. distance freestylers ever, is
hindered by a sore right shoulder.
Cohen won gold medals in the 400 and 800
freestyles at Los Angeles, but
Quick reported that she Is only at
about 80 percent due to a rotator
cuff problem. Both the length and
intensity of her workouts have
been reduced as she works to
make It through the season.
In the absence of Its wounded
warriors, though, Texas has seen
other swimmers come to the fore
front. Freshman Andrea Hayes
has picked up where Cohen left off
and has already qualified for the
NCAAs in the 500 and 1,650
freestyles.
Another newcomer, Carrie
Steinseifer, who captured three
Olympic gold medals, is also
beginning to hit her stride and
could push Stanford's Johnson in
the sprint freestyles. Veterans like
Tori Trees, Patty Sabo and Tracey
McFarlane all boast individual
NCAA championships and are fur
ther evidence that the stars in
Texas really are big and bright.
Haines, however, is not in
timidated.

"We're not worried about big
name swimmers." he said. "A lot
of their big-name swimmers have
not been swimming that well. We
stack up with them pretty well.
(Stanford's) Jenna Johnson, Mi
chelle Griglione and Susan Rapp
are three of the biggest names in
American swimming."
Quick shares Haines' respect for
the Cardinal's top three swim
mers.
"I don't think there's any ques
tion about it that Stanford has the
strongest team we've faced since
we started winning NCAAs three
years ago," he said. "We've prob
ably got to beat Jenna. Michelle or
Susan in something for us to win
the meet. Those girls could win
three events apiece easily."
Haines said he plans to swim
Johnson in the 100 butterfly, and
100 and 200 freestyles as well as a
relay. This leaves Quick with the
choice of either using Steinseifer
in the freestyles and possibly
Mitchell, who recently swam her
best collegiate time in the butter
fly, against Johnson or simply
conceding these races by saving

his stars for relays and other
events.
Quick said how he uses Mitchell
"will depend on how the meet's
going."
While Donahue will have her
hands full with Mitchell in the
backstrokes, Susan Lenth. Almee
Berzins and Stacy Shupe could
sneak in to grab victories for the
Cardinal.
Quick also characterized highly
touted Stanford freshman Laura
McLean as a "darkhorse," and
said. "McLean is going to be fan
tastic."
Regardless of who wins, both
teams are expected to post fast
times. The Texas pool is fast and
deep, with wide lanes and gutters
designed to hold down water tur
bulence.
Haines' took a squad of 20
healthy swimmers to Austin this
morning, and simply predicted
that, "we're going to swim fast."
Stanford will finish Its regular
season schedule with a dual meet
at California on Feb. 14. The
Cardinal will then take part In the
Pacific 10 Championships from
Feb. 26-28.

Mitchell is not the only Longhorn fighting
physical problems, as Olympian Kim Rhoden
baugh has also had the flu and Tiffany Cohen,
one of the best U.S. distance freestylers ever, is
hindered by a sore right shoulder.
Cohen won gold medals in the 400 and 800
freestyles at Los Angeles, but
Quick reported that she Is only at
about 80 percent due to a rotator
cuff problem. Both the length and
intensity of her workouts have
been reduced as she works to
make It through the season.
In the absence of Its wounded
warriors, though, Texas has seen
other swimmers come to the fore
front. Freshman Andrea Hayes
has picked up where Cohen left off
and has already qualified for the
NCAAs in the 500 and 1,650
freestyles.
Another newcomer, Carrie
Steinseifer, who captured three
Olympic gold medals, is also
beginning to hit her stride and
could push Stanford's Johnson in
the sprint freestyles. Veterans like
Tori Trees, Patty Sabo and Tracey
McFarlane all boast individual
NCAA championships and are fur
ther evidence that the stars in
Texas really are big and bright.
Haines, however, is not in
timidated.

"We're not worried about big
name swimmers." he said. "A lot
of their big-name swimmers have
not been swimming that well. We
stack up with them pretty well.
(Stanford's) Jenna Johnson, Mi
chelle Griglione and Susan Rapp
are three of the biggest names in
American swimming."
Quick shares Haines' respect for
the Cardinal's top three swim
mers.
"I don't think there's any ques
tion about it that Stanford has the
strongest team we've faced since
we started winning NCAAs three
years ago," he said. "We've prob
ably got to beat Jenna. Michelle or
Susan in something for us to win
the meet. Those girls could win
three events apiece easily."
Haines said he plans to swim
Johnson in the 100 butterfly, and
100 and 200 freestyles as well as a
relay. This leaves Quick with the
choice of either using Steinseifer
in the freestyles and possibly
Mitchell, who recently swam her
best collegiate time in the butter
fly, against Johnson or simply
conceding these races by saving

his stars for relays and other
events.
Quick said how he uses Mitchell
"will depend on how the meet's
going."
While Donahue will have her
hands full with Mitchell in the
backstrokes, Susan Lenth. Almee
Berzins and Stacy Shupe could
sneak in to grab victories for the
Cardinal.
Quick also characterized highly
touted Stanford freshman Laura
McLean as a "darkhorse," and
said. "McLean is going to be fan
tastic."
Regardless of who wins, both
teams are expected to post fast
times. The Texas pool is fast and
deep, with wide lanes and gutters
designed to hold down water tur
bulence.
Haines' took a squad of 20
healthy swimmers to Austin this
morning, and simply predicted
that, "we're going to swim fast."
Stanford will finish Its regular
season schedule with a dual meet
at California on Feb. 14. The
Cardinal will then take part In the
Pacific 10 Championships from
Feb. 26-28.

To beat the star-studded lineup of three-time defending national champion Texas, Stanford will need to
rely on its depth, such as that provided by freshman freestyler Lisa Gillespie. The No. 2 Cardinal is in Aus
tin this weekend to challenge the top-ranked Longhorns for the nation's No. 1 spot
The eyes of Texas will be on the Texas Swim
ming Center tomorrow when the Stanford
women hit the pool for a 3:30 p.m. matchup
with the top-ranked Longhorns.
It's a Texas-style duel — big — and Is a
matchup between the top two teams in the
country. However, both Stanford Coach
George Haines and Texas Coach Richard
Quick are playing down the meet's Importance
as they point toward conference and NCAA
championships later in the season.
"We're not going to let up on our workouts."
Haines said. "We're going down with the Idea
of Improving. If we happen to win. that's Icing
on the cake."
According to Quick, his swimmers are
"excited about this meet, (but) what matters is

the last week in March (NCAAs are March 19-
21)."
The three-time defending national cham
pion Longhorns are on a roll after hammering
No. 3 Florida 67-46 In Gainesville and will be
looking to avenge an 85-58 loss to the Cardinal
at DeGuerre Pool last year.
Quick has so many Olympians on his squad,
one wonders if he serves ambrosia and nectar
at the training table. Seven of his charges com
peted in the Los Angeles Games in 1984. win
ning six gold medals.
And if the Longhorns can be compared to the
Greek gods, then Betsy Mitchell is their Ath
ena. Along with Stanford's Jenna Johnson
and California's Mary T. Meagher. Mitchell Is
one of the preeminent swimmers in the United
States today. She Joined Meagher as the only
American woman to win an Individual event at
last summer's World Championships, taking

the 200 meter backstroke, and holds the world
record in that event.
Mitchell, however, is fighting the lingering
effects of a flu that knocked her out of the
Florida meet. "I've been fairly sporadic since
Christmas." she said Tuesday. "We've had a
hard three or four weeks of training. I'm a little
tired and sore today."
Nonetheless. "We're real excited for the
meet." she added. "I am particularly excited to
race against Michelle (Donahue) and the other
backstrokers."
Mitchell is not the only Longhorn fighting
physical problems, as Olympian Kim Rhoden
baugh has also had the flu and Tiffany Cohen,
one of the best U.S. distance freestylers ever, is
hindered by a sore right shoulder.
Cohen won gold medals in the 400 and 800
