# Swimmers look out for No. 1
## Card travels to Texas to take on top-ranked Longhorns 
### BRENDAN HEALEY Senior staff writer 
The eyes of Texas will be on the Texas Swim
ming Center tomorrow when the Stanford
women hit the pool for a 3:30 p.m. matchup
with the top-ranked Longhorns.
It's a Texas-style duel — big — and Is a
matchup between the top two teams in the
country. However, both Stanford Coach
George Haines and Texas Coach Richard
Quick are playing down the meet's Importance
as they point toward conference and NCAA
championships later in the season.
"We're not going to let up on our workouts."
Haines said. "We're going down with the Idea
of Improving. If we happen to win. that's Icing
on the cake."
According to Quick, his swimmers are
"excited about this meet, (but) what matters is

the last week in March (NCAAs are March 19-
21)."
The three-time defending national cham
pion Longhorns are on a roll after hammering
No. 3 Florida 67-46 In Gainesville and will be
looking to avenge an 85-58 loss to the Cardinal
at DeGuerre Pool last year.
Quick has so many Olympians on his squad,
one wonders if he serves ambrosia and nectar
at the training table. Seven of his charges com
peted in the Los Angeles Games in 1984. win
ning six gold medals.
And if the Longhorns can be compared to the
Greek gods, then Betsy Mitchell is their Ath
ena. Along with Stanford's Jenna Johnson
and California's Mary T. Meagher. Mitchell Is
one of the preeminent swimmers in the United
States today. She Joined Meagher as the only
American woman to win an Individual event at
last summer's World Championships, taking

the 200 meter backstroke, and holds the world
record in that event.
Mitchell, however, is fighting the lingering
effects of a flu that knocked her out of the
Florida meet. "I've been fairly sporadic since
Christmas." she said Tuesday. "We've had a
hard three or four weeks of training. I'm a little
tired and sore today."
Nonetheless. "We're real excited for the
meet." she added. "I am particularly excited to
race against Michelle (Donahue) and the other
backstrokers."
Mitchell is not the only Longhorn fighting
physical problems, as Olympian Kim Rhoden
baugh has also had the flu and Tiffany Cohen,
one of the best U.S. distance freestylers ever, is
hindered by a sore right shoulder.
Cohen won gold medals in the 400 and 800
