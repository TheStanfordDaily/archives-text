# Stanford swimmers battle southern foes
## No. 2 Card at home against Trojans, Bruins 
### ERIK ESELIUS Senior staff writer 
The recipe is straightforward
enough: Take four or five Olym
pians, add some World Champion
ship participants, toss in a
healthy heaping of NCAA finalists,
qualifiers and a spare porpoise or
two, and one promptly gets what
may be the best poolside, long
and short-course swimming
available anywhere.
The festivity begins when the
second-ranked Stanford men's
swimming team hosts seventh
ranked UCLA today and the
fourth-ranked USC Trojans to
morrow. Both meets begin at 1
p.m.
For the Cardinal, the Trojans
pose the swiftest and tallest order
of the two schools. USC, led by
Olympic gold medalist Mike
O'Brien, enters the contest with a
8-1 season record, the lone loss
coming to Texas, in a meet
decided by the final race. Speed,
no doubt, will predominate.
"This could be the fastest dual
meet in NCAA history," sopho
more butterflier David Schraven
said.
The meet could be "definitely
the fastest in the country this
year, possibly the the fastest in
the history of the sport," contin
ued senior breaststroker Sam
McAdam.
Indeed, this year's Trojan
squad, the strongest in over 10
years, according to Stanford
Coach Skip Kenney, has depth to
match its individual skill.
"To have a great dual meet
team, you need four or five people

and then you work everyone
around them. USC has done
that," Kenney said. Joining
O'Brien in the elite Trojan subset
is freshman distance freestyle sen
sation Dan Jorgenson, who
already is considered to be the
best long-course swimmer in the
country.
Unfortunately for Jorgenson,
the meet will be conducted in the
short-course, 25-yard DeGuerre
pool, the home of Olympian Jeff
Kostoff, who excels in the shorter
length pools because of his excep
tional execution on turns.
More importantly, however, is
the fact that Kostoff is a senior,
swimming his final meet against a
school that he has shown little or
no affection for.
"I'm real determined to finish
this [senior season] up right."
Kostoff said. "I'm glad our last
meeet is against USC. I want to
kill them."
The candid Kostoff, noted for
voicing an opinion or five, has the
confidence of Kenney. "Jorgenson
is someone we have to respect,"
Kenney said. "But I don't see
anyone beating Jeff in our own
facility."
Junior Olympic butterflier An
thony Mosse stressed the impor
tance of "starting off strong," and
winning the one-on-one
matchups with the best USC
swimmers.
One USC strength, breast
stroker and second-place 200-yard
NCAA finisher Steve Bentley,
could be particularly troublesome
for the rapidly improving, yet in
experienced Cardinal breaststroke
group, composed of two freshmen.

a sophomore and one senior.
As the two teams battle for first
place showings, Kenney said he
feels the fight for seconds and
thirds in the races "would be the
big difference" in the meet, along
with the steady and expected con
tributions from his freshmen,
chiefly from the heralded quartet
of Sam Schwartz, Lunn Lestina,
Byron Burson and John Witchell.
The winner of the meet will ac
quire the honor and prestige of
the Bell Trophy, a coveted bronze
showpiece that is annually passed
along to the winner. Victorious in
the first 10 years, the Trojans
were reluctant to part with the
trophy after Stanford snapped Its
string five years ago. Only after
the Cardinal won again the follow
ing year did the Trojans concede
the prize. USC has not touched
the ornament for four years.
Today's meet against the UCLA
should also serve to test the Card
inal. Though not as strong as the
Trojans, the Bruins, 6-2 overall,
feature defending NCAA cham
pion and Olympian Giovanni
Minervini. who last year upset
Stanford's own Olympian John
Moffet for the NCAA title in the
100-yard breaststroke.
But overall, the meet may sway
with the first splash, according to
Kenney, who labeled the opening
400-yard medley relay as the "key
swim of the meet."
"I think that the NCAA cham
pion in the medley relay is going to
come from either Stanford or
UCLA. Whoever wins that first
relay has the best chance at win
ning the meet," Kenney said.

is freshman distance freestyle sen
sation Dan Jorgenson, who
already is considered to be the
best long-course swimmer in the
country.
Unfortunately for Jorgenson,
the meet will be conducted in the
short-course, 25-yard DeGuerre
pool, the home of Olympian Jeff
Kostoff, who excels in the shorter
length pools because of his excep
tional execution on turns.
More importantly, however, is
the fact that Kostoff is a senior,
swimming his final meet against a
school that he has shown little or
no affection for.
"I'm real determined to finish
this [senior season] up right."
Kostoff said. "I'm glad our last
meeet is against USC. I want to
kill them."
The candid Kostoff, noted for
voicing an opinion or five, has the
confidence of Kenney. "Jorgenson
is someone we have to respect,"
Kenney said. "But I don't see
anyone beating Jeff in our own
facility."
Junior Olympic butterflier An
thony Mosse stressed the impor
tance of "starting off strong," and
winning the one-on-one
matchups with the best USC
swimmers.
One USC strength, breast
stroker and second-place 200-yard
NCAA finisher Steve Bentley,
could be particularly troublesome
for the rapidly improving, yet in
experienced Cardinal breaststroke
group, composed of two freshmen.

a sophomore and one senior.
As the two teams battle for first
place showings, Kenney said he
feels the fight for seconds and
thirds in the races "would be the
big difference" in the meet, along
with the steady and expected con
tributions from his freshmen,
chiefly from the heralded quartet
of Sam Schwartz, Lunn Lestina,
Byron Burson and John Witchell.
The winner of the meet will ac
quire the honor and prestige of
the Bell Trophy, a coveted bronze
showpiece that is annually passed
along to the winner. Victorious in
the first 10 years, the Trojans
were reluctant to part with the
trophy after Stanford snapped Its
string five years ago. Only after
the Cardinal won again the follow
ing year did the Trojans concede
the prize. USC has not touched
the ornament for four years.
Today's meet against the UCLA
should also serve to test the Card
inal. Though not as strong as the
Trojans, the Bruins, 6-2 overall,
feature defending NCAA cham
pion and Olympian Giovanni
Minervini. who last year upset
Stanford's own Olympian John
Moffet for the NCAA title in the
100-yard breaststroke.
But overall, the meet may sway
with the first splash, according to
Kenney, who labeled the opening
400-yard medley relay as the "key
swim of the meet."
"I think that the NCAA cham
pion in the medley relay is going to
come from either Stanford or
UCLA. Whoever wins that first
relay has the best chance at win
ning the meet," Kenney said.

be making their final DeGuerre Pool appearances this weekend against USC and UCLA. To beat the highly
ranked Trojans and Bruins, the No. 2 Cardinal will need strong performances from its younger swimmers
as well, such as freshman Mark Dietrich (right).
