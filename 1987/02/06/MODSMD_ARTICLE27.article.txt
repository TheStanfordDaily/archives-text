# Four Cardinal seniors finish their DeGuerre Pool careers
## 
### ERIK ESELIUS Senior staff writer 
From a cluttered morass of dripping humanity
came loud incantations of "Kill, kill, bevo — bevo,
bevo — blood, blood, blood." The message is
menacing, the intent is kindness. Led by senior
captains Jeff Kostoff, Sam McAdam and Pablo
Morales, the Stanford men's swimming did their
bit to say goodbye and good luck to the Texas
bound women's swim team on the deck of
DeGuerre Pool.
You won't it find in a Hallrn.vk card.
For seniors McAdam, Morales, Kostoff and Dave
Louden, this weekend's meets against UCLA and
USC will be their final Pacific 10 Conference home
appearance, ideally culminating in an undefeated
home dual meet record.
The accomplishments of the foursome are
varied and great. Between Kostoff and Morales
alone, Stanford has claimed 13 NCAA relay and in
dividual championships. Louden has been a
NCAA finalist for two years while McAdam has
been instrumental in Stanford's two champion
ship seasons.
"These guys (the seniors) came to Stanford with
the goal of being national champions, and that's
exactly what they've done," Stanford Coach Skip
Kenney said. "The last two years, this class has
been a coach's dream. They have great attitudes
and they help everyone on the team.
"They stay late after practice and come early to
practice. They make people around them better. I
think this is the best class that has ever gone
through Stanford."
Now that sounds like a Hallmark card.
Certainly though, the influence of the seniors
has been far-reaching. In their four years here,
Stanford has only suffered one dual meet setback

while winning the NCAA team championship the
last two years.
This season, for the first time since he has been
a coach at Stanford, Kenney chose to have three
captains. Morales, Kostoff and McAdam have
more than fulfilled their roles.
"It's great having best friends as seniors," soph
omore John Hodge said. "It makes the team really
strong and gives us confidence."
"They complement each other very well," added
sophomore Dave Schraven, who compared swim
ming with the likes of Morales and Kostoff to
playing basketball with Michael Jordan. Search
ing desperately to continue the basketball anal
ogy, Schraven thought kiddingly of Milwaukee's
Paul "Dr. Mo" Mokeski when McAdam was men
tioned.
"Sam is the most vocal of the three. Though
Sam hasn't accomplished as much as the other
two, 1 think he'll be missed as much as any Stan
ford swimmer (ever) to come through here."
Each of the captains adds a certain dimension
of leadership and force to the team. All three have
gained immeasurable respect from their
teammates and, most notably, from Kenney.
"All three have played their leadership roles in a
little different matter. Sam McAdam has been the
rah-rah guy, mostly has got all the work done that
the captains have to do," Kenney said.
"Pablo has led by his performance in the water.
Hasn't had to say a lot. Kostoff, on the other hand,
probably talks and shows more self-confidence
than anyone else I have met, and that is so con
tagious to others," Kenney continued.
Sophomore John Hodge added to the Kostoff
lore. "KB (Kostoff) has as strong of an opinion as
anyone on the team — postive all the way around
no matter what comes out of his mouth — and
that's a lot," Hodge concluded. "He's probably the
best work-out swimmer in the world."
