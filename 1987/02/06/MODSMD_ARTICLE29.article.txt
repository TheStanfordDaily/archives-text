# Gymnasts host Cardinal Classic
## Women seek revenge against Cal 
### EVAN TUCHINSKY Staff writer 
Tonight at 7:30 one might
mistake Maples Pavilion for
Mutual of Omaha's Wild Kingdom,
as the Stanford women's gymnas
tics team hosts the California
Golden Bears and the New Mexico
Lobos in the 1987 Cardinal Clas
sic. a competition that could prove
to be as fierce as any fight In the
Jungle.
"It's going to be a good meet."
Stanford Coach Homer Sardlna
said. "Last week, Berkeley soundly
defeated us. Now let's see how they
do In our den. the Cardinal den."
Cal comes to Stanford after
defeating the Cardinal. Washing
ton and UC-Santa Barbara last
week at its California Invitational,
scoring 180.4 to the Cardinal's
176.15. New Mexico, which
recently garnered a 180.15, is also
a formidable competitor.
A vocal and supportive audience
could well make the difference for
Stanford. "Last week the crowd
was sound with Berkeley sup
port." Sardlna said. "I hope we
have as big a turnout. Let's see
how big the home field advantage
really is.
"We'd like to see more students
out for meets," he added. "It really
helps the athletes perform, and
it's really entertaining."
Another big factor for the Card
inal squad Is hitting routines. The
team recorded 11 falls last
weekend, costing the team 5.5
points In deductions alone.
"If you add up the falls and add
it to the last meet's score, it's a
182," Asst. Coach Sam Shaw ob

served. "They (Cal) scored 180-
plus. We're just as good as they
are, we just have to show it. If the
girls stay on the apparatus, we'll
win."
Sardina concurred. "If we're
going to win, we've got to hit," he
said. "We can't beat ourselves.
"Our key event will be bars
again; we'll be throwing a lot of
release moves," Sardina contin

ued. "I also think we'll do much
better on beam and much better
on floor."
More difficult moves in routines
should improve Stanford's
showing. "Dina (Amoroso) is
using her double back for the first
time this season, and Cheryl Doo
is too," Sardina said. "You could
see nine double backs this meet â€”
that's a lot of tumbling."

The coaches have set some
sizeable yet realistic goals for the
Cardinal. "We're going to try and
score a 46 on vault, 45 on bars,
46-plus on beam and settle for
45.5 or 46 on floor," Sardina
declared. This would net Stanford
a score in the 182 range, the level
of performance necessary to
qualify for post-season competi
tion.
