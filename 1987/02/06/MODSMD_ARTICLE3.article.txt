# Profs attack right-wing links

### JOHN POLLACK Senior staff writer 
Concern over a possible Stan
ford/Hoover/Reagan link surfaced
again yesterday at a meeting of the
Faculty Senate, when several fac
ulty members expressed reserva
tions about the public's percep
tion of Stanford and its relation
ship to the Reagan Library and
the Hoover Institution.
Acting University President
James Rosse, while acknowledg
ing that such concerns deserve
careful examination, discounted
the existence of a link between
Stanford, Hoover and the Reagan
administration.

English Prof. Robert Polhemus
said, "Hoover, the Reagan Library
and rightist political causes get
jumbled together In public
opinion with the identity of Stan
ford University." He blamed this
confusion on Hoover Director W.
Glenn Campbell.
Campbell, in the 1986 Hoover
Annual Report, wrote that in ac
cepting the Reagan Library, Stan
ford had chosen to "honor"
Reagan and could "boast" of a
"Reagan connection."
Polhemus asked Rosse if the
University Administration in
tended to disassociate itself from
Campbell's remarks.
"Does the Administration have

any plans to meet head on the at
best sophistical practice of the
Hoover director and perhaps
others of its officers in the linking
the prestige of Stanford University
to a partisan political agenda?"
Polhemus asked.
Rosse asked for time to consider
the issue. "The question that you
ask me to answer is one that calls
for a thoughtful and more careful
answer than I feel comfortable
making as I sit here," he said.
However, Rosse said Campbell
and others at Stanford "are likely
to speak what's on their mind,
regardless of what 1 think."
