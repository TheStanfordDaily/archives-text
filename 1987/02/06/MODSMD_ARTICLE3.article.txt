# Profs attack right-wing links
## 
### JOHN POLLACK Senior staff writer 
Concern over a possible Stan
ford/Hoover/Reagan link surfaced
again yesterday at a meeting of the
Faculty Senate, when several fac
ulty members expressed reserva
tions about the public's percep
tion of Stanford and its relation
ship to the Reagan Library and
the Hoover Institution.
Acting University President
James Rosse, while acknowledg
ing that such concerns deserve
careful examination, discounted
the existence of a link between
Stanford, Hoover and the Reagan
administration.

English Prof. Robert Polhemus
said, "Hoover, the Reagan Library
and rightist political causes get
jumbled together In public
opinion with the identity of Stan
ford University." He blamed this
confusion on Hoover Director W.
Glenn Campbell.
Campbell, in the 1986 Hoover
Annual Report, wrote that in ac
cepting the Reagan Library, Stan
ford had chosen to "honor"
Reagan and could "boast" of a
"Reagan connection."
Polhemus asked Rosse if the
University Administration in
tended to disassociate itself from
Campbell's remarks.
"Does the Administration have

any plans to meet head on the at
best sophistical practice of the
Hoover director and perhaps
others of its officers in the linking
the prestige of Stanford University
to a partisan political agenda?"
Polhemus asked.
Rosse asked for time to consider
the issue. "The question that you
ask me to answer is one that calls
for a thoughtful and more careful
answer than I feel comfortable
making as I sit here," he said.
However, Rosse said Campbell
and others at Stanford "are likely
to speak what's on their mind,
regardless of what 1 think."
Rosse said he found It
"disturbing, but not entirely un
heard of' for a member of the Ad
ministration, such as Campbell,
to express "points of view that are
in dissonance with other mem
bers of the Administration."
English Prof. Ronald Rebholz
said Campbell's comments were a
"genuine violation of the partisan
neutrality" of the University. Reb
holz asked Rosse if it was not his

responsibility as acting president
to stop Campbell from making
such public statements.
Rosse replied that he was not re
sponsible for controlling Camp
bell's public statements but rather
for "worrying about the conse
quences of the statements he
(Campbell) made in the context of
the University's progress through
time."
Rosse also pointed out that the
location of the Reagan Library at
the University should not be inter
preted as an attempt to honor
Reagan. Rather, Rosse empha

sized the academic value of the li
brary's archival collection to Stan
ford.
In other business, the Commit
tee on Libraries (C-Lib) presented
its annual report for 1985-86.
Among other things, the report
emphasized the expanding role of
electronic information in the li
brary system.
Questions were raised concern
ing the rate at which pre-1973 li
brary materials are being trans
ferred from the card catalog onto
Socrates â€” the University's com
puter library reference catalogue.
Currently, 40,000 titles are en

tered into Socrates each year, and
at this rate the task will not be
complete until the year 2007.
Rebholz and others expressed
dissatisfaction with the slow pace.
"We do need to accelerate the
transfer" of titles onto Socrates,
Rebholz said. But the C-Lib said
budget constraints prevent a more
rapid conversion.
The Senate also received reports
on neurosciences, biophysics and
Graduate Special Programs from
the Committee on Graduate
Studies (C-GS). The Senate
renewed the authority of all the
programs to grant degrees.
