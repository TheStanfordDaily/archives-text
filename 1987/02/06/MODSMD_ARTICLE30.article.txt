# Track loosens up for outdoor season at Louisiana State
## 
### ERIK STEN Editorial staff 
During the cold months of
winter you don't see too much
of the track team. Kind of like a
bear in hibernation, a typical
track athlete spends most of
the year's cold months training
and training . . . and training
some more.
Finally, as spring draws
nearer, the athletes start to
emerge. They come out from
their hiding places and start to
test themselves and their train
ing. In final preparation for the
upcoming outdoor season, they
begin to compete.
This Saturday. Stanford will
begin its 1987 campaign at the
Louisiana State Indoor. Going
into the meet. Stanford Coach
Brooks Johnson isn't expecting
too much. He simply wants to
give his team an opportunity to
compete, and himself a chance
to assess the squad.
With a total of 95 athletes on
the team, the largest turnout in
Johnson's time at Stanford,
the outlook for the season may
be the best in years. But for
now, Johnson is content to
take it slow, for as he well
knows, these meets don't
count. The later ones do.
"We don't know enough of
where we are. It's time to find
out," Johnson said. "We've had

some great training and at this
point we're pretty high on the
team. We just need a chance to
shake out the cobwebs. 1 '
The Cardinal will get that
chance this weekend. In Baton
Rouge, Stanford will compete
against some of the country's
top teams. Alabama. Rice and
Arizona will join Stanford and
host LSU to complete a talented
field.
Throwers and distance ath
letes will make up the brunt of
the Cardinal contingent and
will most likely be the ones to
watch. Two of the nation's best,
sophomore Patty Purpur and
co-terminal student Pam
Dukes, who has one year of in
door eligibility left, along with
talented freshmen Andy Papat
hanasslou and Brian Boggess
will compete in the shotput.
In the distances, Kathy
Smith, Brenda Steenhof and
freshman cross country All-
America Carol Gray should face
some stiff competition from
Rice's distance crew.
A total of 13 athletes will
make the trip. Because of the
high level of stress Involved in
sprinting, Johnson has
decided to leave the squad's
sprinters at home. For them,
the regular season will be long
enough. For the others, It's
time to see just what their
training has done.
