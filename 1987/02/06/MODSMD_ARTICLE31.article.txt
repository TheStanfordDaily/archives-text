# Injury-plagued gymnasts compete at UCLA Sunday
## 
### MARK SMOYER Staff writer 
It's a lot different looking from
the bottom up than from the top
down, and the Stanford men's
gymnastics team will find that out
Sunday night.
Not that last year's squad,
ranked No. 3 nationally, has
dropped off into oblivion, but the
Cardinal is not the force it was last
winter. Meanwhile the tough com
petition it edged out wins against
a year ago is, in many cases, now
even tougher. All this means that
while a nagging injury or two -
combined with a few poor
routines â€” did not necessarily
mean a loss last season, even
against the nation's elite, this year
it means a sure loss.
The gymnasts understand what
they will be up against when they
enter UCLA's Pauley Pavilion Sun
day night. "We're going to see at
this UCLA meet what our competi
tion is really going to be at the
NCAAs," said sophomore Scott
Schaffer.

"We're ready for a rough road
trip," freshman Charles Loop
agreed, adding that the team is
much more optimistic about next
week's home opener, the Hobee In
vitational.
According to team member Mike
Matzek, Stanford will be a little
conservative this weekend to
assure that no injuries are ag
gravated to the point where the
Cardinal would not be able to give
its best at next week's competi
tion, which will feature, besides
some of the country's best col
legians, an exhibition perfor
mance from four of the country's
best gymnasts.
UCLA, Illinois. Arizona State
and Minnesota are ranked No. 3.
No. 5, No. 8 and No. 11 nationally.
They will all be competing Sun
day, as will New Mexico, also a
NCAA-quality team. Add the Card
inal to this lineup and you have
six teams that are all a fairly good
bet to finish this season among
the top 10, although only UCLA
has a realistic chance to win the

NCAA championship.
The Bruins feature four U.S. Na
tional Team members, including
United States Ail-Around Cham
pion Curtis Holdsworth. David St.
Pierre is ranked three spots be
hind Holdsworth. UCLA Is 3-0 on
the season with a team high score
of 280.90.
Chuck Gerardo leads the Card
inal with the team's best score all
around and on three of six events.
Freshman Conrad Voorsanger is
the team leader on the other three
apparatl and is second all-around.
Although the Cardinal gym
nasts hesitate to continue using
injuries as an excuse for their slow
start this winter, they could do so
justly. Top freshman Adam For
man will not compete at all this
weekend, Voorsanger will be
unable to compete In all six events
and Gerardo's wrist Injury will
restrict him on certain events.
Tonight, Stanford will be at UC-
Davis for a relatively in significant
meet. The Cardinal beat Davis
easily a month ago.
