# Cardinal spikers to face tough competition at UCSB tourney
## 
### ALICIA KENT Staff writer 
Invited to play against the highest-ranked teams in
the nation, the Stanford men's volleyball team will
face UCLA, Pepperdine and USC in the UCLA/Reebok
Collegiate Volleyball Classic tonight at UCLA's Pauley
Pavilion.
At 7:30, the Cardinal will take on UCLA, which was
recently ranked No. 2 nationally, while Pepperdine,
No. 3. will play against No. 4 USC at 5:30. Playing the
traditional tournament format of three-out-of-five
games in each match, the losers of tonight's games
will play tomorrow night at 6 p.m. and the winners
will compete in a championship match at 8 p.m.
Traditionally, UC-Santa Barbara is invited to the
tournament; however, this year Stanford was invited
as a representive of Northern California.
The tournament will give the Cardinal the chance
to play against a highly competitive field. "The
criteria (for the match) is strong, very competitive
teams that are of interest to the public. Even though
we are not one of the top five in the country, we can
compete at that level," Stanford Asst. Coach Ruben
Nieves said. *
Stanford Coach Fred Sturm, who played for UCLA
Coach A 1 Scates as an undergraduate and helped
lead the Bruins to NCAA championships in 1972,
1975 and 1976, had the chance to observe the UCLA
squad at the UC-Santa Barbara Classic two weeks
ago. The Bruins' strength this year rests on the fact
that they have the tallest lineup in the country, with
a player at 6-foot-9, three players at 6-6, two at 6-5
and the the short man of the team at 6-1.
With an overall record of 14-3, a Western Intercol

legiate Volleyball Association conference record of 2-
0 and a strong win against the Cardinal at the UCSB
Classic, the Bruins will provide tough competition
for Stanford, which does not yet have a set starting
lineup. "We are still a ways from setting a starting
lineup. The players continue to change, creating a
competition among the players," Nieves said.
Banking on the success of last weekend's starting
lineup, Nieves said he thinks that freshman setter
Parker Blackman will lead seniors Stephen Blue,
John McDermott and Robert Peterson, junior Scott
Fortune and freshman Craig Forsyth in tonight's
match, although freshman outside hitter Dan
Hanan has been playing well in practice and could be
worked into the lineup. "We're still looking at all the
players. We know a lot more about the individual
players and about the team, but there is still a lot
more to find," Nieves said.
Tomorrow's competition for the Cardinal is less
clear. USC is not a tall team like UCLA, but what it
lacks in size, it makes up for in offense. "USC has a
good, smooth, consistent offense. They don't block
as well, so they have to keep siding-out," Nieves said.
Sturm and Nieves have not had the opportunity to
see Pepperdine play this year. Pepperdine's strength
rests on one man, Troy Tanner, who has been called
the best all-around collegiate player in the country.
Pepperdine also returns three other starters from
last year's national championship team.
Although the competition is tough, the Cardinal is
going into the Classic with an anxious, optimistic
feeling, according to Nieves. "We've gotten a lot bet
ter. Here's a chance to show our opponents and our
selves that we have improved," he said.
