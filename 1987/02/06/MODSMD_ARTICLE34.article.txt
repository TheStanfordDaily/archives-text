## Lineup changes for women vs. UC-Irvine 
### KEN STEVENS Editorial staff 
With both the Stanford men's
and women's tennis teams
scheduled to play today at the
Varsity Tennis Courts at 1:30
P-m., the top-ranked Cardinal
women will have to share the
home spotlight. But don't expect
them to play second fiddle.
While the men are exchanging
forehands and backhands with
Rollins College (Fla.), the Stan
ford women should be aclng the
Anteaters of UC-Irvlne.
The Cardinal blanked the Ant
eaters 9-0 here last April with
out the services of Patty Fendlck
or Carl Hagey. Today, Stanford
will be missing seniors Stepha
nie Savides and Leigh Anne
Eldredge and sophomore Eleni
Rossldes, but the Cardinal
should still easily raise Its 1987
dual match record to 2-0.
Still, Stanford Coach Frank
Brennan likes to be cautious
when playing a team he knows
little about. "They're not a
power, but they'll probably be a
pretty good match," he said.
Though Savides is in Rich
mond, Va., for the Rolex Na

tlonal Indoor Intercollegiate
Tennis Championships, and
Eldredge and Rossldes continue
to sit on the sidelines with
stress fracture injuries. Fendick
and Hagey will play against the
Anteaters this year.
With two different team
matches being played at the
same time, spectators on hand
today will likely be splitting their
attention between the various
courts. Most will be watching
Fendick, however, as all eyes in
the collegiate tennis world have
been focused on the talented
senior lately.
Fendick. the defending NCAA
singles champion, has won 29
consecutive collegiate singles
matches dating back to last
season. As usual, she will be
playing In the No. 1 singles slot
today, although she may not
participate in doubles as
Savldes, her partner, is in Vir
ginia.
Hagey — returning from a
muscle pull that kept her out of
the lineup in Tuesday's 9-0
season-opening victory against
Rollins — will play both singles
and doubles today.
Junior Kay Tittle, who will be

at No. 2 singles, Is the only other
returnee from last year's squad
scheduled to play today. The
remainder of the lineup will con
sist of freshmen Lisa Green (at
No. 4) and Valerie Wilson (No. 5).
and sophomore Cindy Buchs
baum (No. 6).
The Cardinal doubles teams,
completely revamped from last
season, will be changed once
again today. Fendlck and
Savldes, who established them
selves two weeks ago by captur
ing the Women's Intercollegiate
Invitational title at Pacific
Palisades, will not be In the No.
1 spot today.
Brennan said Fendick may or
may not play doubles. "I might
take her out of the doubles and
move everybody up and see what
happens," he said.
However, if the match were
still close heading Into the
doubles, then the Cardinal
might be in trouble. "1 don't
want to put a weaker doubles
lineup in and then be 4-2 in
singles," Brennan added.
If Fendick does not play
doubles, then Green and Tittle
will move into the No. 1 spot and
Hagey and Wilson will play No. 2.
