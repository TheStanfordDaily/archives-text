# Men face Division II powerhouse Rollins
## 
### JON WEISMAN Staff writer 
In a basketball game a few years ago,
Chaminade University of Hawaii played Virginia,
which at the time was a perennial NCAA tourna
ment team. From an enrollment of 900, the Sil
verswords put on court a team that defeated Vir
ginia and All-America Ralph Sampson.
Now. meet Rollins College.
Located in Winter Park, Fla., Rollins College has
an enrollment of 1,300 students. Last year, the
Rollins men's tennis team finished sixth in NCAA
Division 11. This year, the Tars are currently
ranked sixth.
Now that that's out of the way, those who were
going to dismiss Rollins as no competition for
NCAA Division I defending champion Stanford
(out of understandable ignorance of what exactly
Rollins was) now can judge objectively the threat
the Tars pose.
Coming off a 5-2 loss to UC-Irvine last Friday,
Stanford Coach Dick Gould obviously would not
downgrade any opponent, even if he knew noth
ing about it.
"We've proven we can't go out (and win) in just
any match." Gould said. "We're hoping to play a
little more intelligently, a little more to our capa
bility.
"It's a chance to redeem ourself for last Friday,"

Gould said. "It's going to be a little tougher for us
because Patrick (McEnroe) won't be there."
McEnroe is playing in Richmond, Va. at the
Rolex National Indoor Intercollegiate Tennis
Championships. After losing to Louisiana State's
Billy Uribe, 6-1, 6-1, McEnroe was scheduled to
enter the consolation bracket of the tournament.
With Stanford's No. 1 player out, Rollins will be
playing its Virginia without its Sampson. The
Tars are led by Pat Emmet, who is the second
ranked player in Division 11. A semi-finalist in last
year's Division II tournament. Emmet also teams
up with ninth-ranked Pat Johnson to form a top
doubles team.
The rest of Rollins lineup includes 25th-ranked
Robert Green, Don Martin, Scott Speilberger and
Barry Pelts.
Though it may not have much bearing on Rol
lins' postseason play, meeting Stanford for the
first time ever is quite important for the Tars.
"We're really excited about it," Rollins Coach
Norm Copeland said. "Just playing Stanford
means a lot for our program."
Now, to relax those still nervous from the
opening warning, on Tuesday the Rollins
women's team met defending champion Stanford,
and lost, 9-0.
At Stanford Tennis Stadium at 1:30 p.m. today
it will be revealed which script this match will fol
low.
