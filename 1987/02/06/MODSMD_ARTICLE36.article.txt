### FAITH PERRY Staff writer 
"Roadrunner ... if he catches you, you're
through." The Stanford wrestling team will try to
avoid that predicament tomorrow at 5 p.m. when
it faces the formidable Cal State-Bakersfield
Roadrunners at Maples Pavilion.
Stanford competed against Bakersfield in the
All-Cal Tournament last weekend in San Fran
cisco. Bakersfield dominated the tournament,
and according to Stanford Coach Chris Horpel,
the Cardinal is definitely a "dark horse" in tomor
row's match.
"Bakersfield is the toughest team we've wrestled
so far." Horpel said. "The Roadrunners are ranked
first or second in the NCAA Division 11. and two of
their athletes are ranked first in the division in
their weight class. They're definitely the best team
on the West Coast."
There were two Stanford wrestlers who beat
their Bakersfield opponents in the All-Cal tourna
ment, but the matches were extremely close. Co

captain Scott Wiggen (150 pounds) tied with
Roadrunner Junior Saunders in their regulation
match. In the overtime period. Wiggen was losing
in points when he managed to pin Saunders to
win the match. Cardinal Steve Yarbrough (158)
had an even closer match with his Bakersfield op
ponent.
Yarbrough went up against Deijnik Bak and the
two tied in regulation time. The match went into
overtime, and the two were so close that the
judges had to use the seventh criterion (out of
eight) to determine who had won the match. It
was decided that Yarbrough had 20 seconds
worth of riding time over Bak. and Yarbrough was
given the victory.
Though Wiggen and Yarbrough posted victories
over Bakersfield opponents last week, Horpel said
the two victories will be "difficult to repeat."
Tomorrow is the last home match of the season.
The Cardinal will travel to the Southern Cal Duals
Feb. 15, followed by a match at San Jose State
Feb. 21. The Pacific 10 Conference champion
ships are scheduled for March 7 and 8.
