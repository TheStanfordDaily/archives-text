# Fencing meets UC-Santa Cruz
## Banana Slugs invade Farm 
### CHRIS CRADER Staff writer 
It is now that ugly time in the
quater when midterms begin.
Students get upset and start
having violent thoughts, held in
check only by the fear of arrest.
Some lucky students will have a
chance to get their frustrations
out, however, when the Stanford
fencing teams take on UC-Santa
Cruz tomorrow.
The match will take place at
Roble Gym at 1 p.m.
The men's team has a 7-7 record
and is struggling through a
season in which five of its nine
fencers have no previous varsity
experience. The team expects to
be in the top three at the Western
Reglonals in three weeks, but its
youth has lead to an up-and-down
season.
The men hope to defeat the
Banana Slugs with their strong
sabre team leading the way. The
sabre team is lead by senior co
captain Steve Levitan and junior
Mike Cramer, both of whom went
undefeated last weekend against
San Francisco State.

The epee team is also having a
good year behind the other senior
co-captain, Larry Murk. All three
members of the foil team,
however, are in their first year of
competition.
The women's team isn't having
any of those youth problems,
though. It is at 10-3 on the year
and has been ranked in the na
tion's top 10 all year. Santa Cruz
is expected to battle Stanford for
the regional title, but the Cardinal
has the psychological advantage of
having beaten the Banana Slugs
last November, 10-6. In fact, the
Santa Cruz women have never
beaten Stanford.
Stanford Coach Buzz Hurst was
somewhat worried about the
Banana Slugs, though. "UCSC is
stronger now than even when we
fenced them in November," he
said. "But I also think our team is
considerably stronger with Tracy
Schmidt."
Schmidt had ankle surgery in
October and has been back for
just three weeks. "My ankle is just

fine," she said, proving it by post
ing a 3-0 record last Saturday.
Santa Cruz also has a surprise,
however, with a fencer coming
back for her last quarter of
eligibility after some time off.
"She's good," said Schmidt, "but
not as good as Holly Taylor."
So far this year, few have been
as good as Taylor, as the Stanford
co-captain has fenced her way to a
43-4 record. The senior, who also
went 43-4 last year, combines
with Allyson Yarus, another
senior, to serve as a great one-two
punch.
Schmidt expects a tough fight.
"I think they are psyched to beat
us. but part of that is they know
we're hard to beat," she said.
"Santa Cruz is going to be diffi
cult, but the more difficult it is,
the more fun it is," she said.
Both the men and women will
be off next weekend before travel
ing to Berkeley Feb. 21 to con
clude the regular season against
Calfornia. The women will host
the Western Regionals on Feb. 28.
