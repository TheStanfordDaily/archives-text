## 
### BISHAKHA DATTA Staff Writer 
A favorable international environment and the
right domestic policies will help Mexico overcome its
economic crisis, according to the former Mexican
finance minister.
Given today's global, "interdependent" economy,
the United States will play a major role in Mexico's
economic recovery. Jesus Silva-Herzog told about
100 people in a Kresge Auditorium speech last night.
At the same time, Mexico will have to "enter a
profound process of change, restructuring and eco
nomic reform" to increase efficiency and productiv
ity. Silva-Herzog said.
Silva-Herzog. who was Mexico's finance minister
from 1982 to 1986. said Mexico today "faces its worst
economic crisis in more than 50 years."
He said certain domestic factors like government
deficits, inflation, interest rates and exchange rates
partly led to the weakening of the Mexican economy
in 1982.

In a speech in Kresge Auditorium last night, former Mexican Finance Minister Jesus
Silva-Herzog addressed the changes in both U.S. and Mexican policy that are needed
to remedy Mexico's present economic and political difficulties.
the 1986 oil shock and declining
oil prices have aggravated the sit
uation he said.
"We were coming out of the In
tensive care unit when we were
hit on the head with a heavy
stick," Sllva-Herzog told the audi
ence.
Calling on the United States to
pay greater attention to the effect
its national policies has on Mex4cÂ«
and Latin America, Silva-Herzog
outlined specific U.S. policies that,
would help Mexico.

He mentioned the need to
reduce the U.S. government defi
cit. This, he said, would lead to a
"less restrictive monetary policy"
and lower the interest rates of deb
tor nations.
Saying that "protectionism is
more today than yesterday," Silva-
Herzog called on the United States
to buy more Mexican goods. He
said the United States should
realize that regions other than
Mexico and Latin America are be
hind its trade problems.
"Interdependence is not an
abstract concept, but a reality,"
said Silva-Herzog. The United
States should adopt a "more defl

nite attitude" toward Mexico's
debt problem, he said.
He also stressed that the
Mexican government had a critical
role to play in initiating recovery.
"Mexico's economic problems
are Mexico's responsibility," he
emphasized. "Nobody will do for
us what we ourselves don't do."
Silva-Herzog said the Mexican
government should focus on
boosting exports, attracting more
domestic savings, fighting the
debt problem and reducing infla
tion.
He added "restoration of confi
dence" and following "consistent

policies" to the list of domestic
priorities. He said Mexico should
set its priorities without following
"ideological suggestions" and
"religious recipes" from abroad.
A failure to go the crisis
could lead to social conflict, he
warned.
Silva-Herzog stepped down from
his position in 1986. citing per
sonal reasons. Acting Univeristy
President James Rosse intro
duced him as one of the "prime
contenders for the Mexican
presidency."
This speech was his fourth and
final one in the Americas Program
lecture series.
