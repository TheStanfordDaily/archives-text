### BISHAKHA DATTA Staff Writer 
A favorable international environment and the
right domestic policies will help Mexico overcome its
economic crisis, according to the former Mexican
finance minister.
Given today's global, "interdependent" economy,
the United States will play a major role in Mexico's
economic recovery. Jesus Silva-Herzog told about
100 people in a Kresge Auditorium speech last night.
At the same time, Mexico will have to "enter a
profound process of change, restructuring and eco
nomic reform" to increase efficiency and productiv
ity. Silva-Herzog said.
Silva-Herzog. who was Mexico's finance minister
from 1982 to 1986. said Mexico today "faces its worst
economic crisis in more than 50 years."
He said certain domestic factors like government
deficits, inflation, interest rates and exchange rates
partly led to the weakening of the Mexican economy
in 1982.
