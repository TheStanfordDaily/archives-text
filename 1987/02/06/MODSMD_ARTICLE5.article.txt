# IFC may reform Rush
## Rush committee recommends closed parties and a dry week 
### MARCUS MABRY Senior Staff Writer 
The Rush Committee of the In
terfraternity Council (IFC) sub
mitted to IFC members Wednes
day evening a proposal to alter fra
ternity Rush that would prohibit
alcohol from functions during one
of the event's three weeks.
If approved by the IFC at its next
meeeting on Feb. 18, the proposal
will make the second week of Rush
"dry," prohibiting fraternities
from serving alcoholic beverages
to rushees during activities that
week.
In addition to the dry second
week, the proposal calls for Rush
cards to be issued to students who
plan to attend Rush functions.
The cards would list the rushee's
name, class and residence and
would be issued by the IFC. No one
would be admitted to any Rush ac
tivities, including parties, without
the cards.
The cards would be distributed
at an all-campus meeting — an
other proposed new feature of this
year's Rush — that would be held
before Rush in order to provide in
terested students with Informa
tion and rules concerning Rush
and fraternities. The cards would
also be available at locations
throughout campus, including
the Office of the Fraternal Affairs
Adviser.

The proposed overhaul of Rush
comes at a time when many frater
nity members, as well as Univer
sity administrators, are feeling in
creased pressure to reduce the
disorder some feel has plagued
Rush in recent years.
IFC President Steve Singleton
said the proposal reflects fraterni
ties' commitment to present an or-

ganized Rush and to dissuade the
University from intervening and
imposing its own restrictions.
"We (the IFC) were not sure that
Rush, in its present form, was
doing what we thought it should,
as best it could," Singleton said.
"The purpose of Rush is to give
[rushees and fraternity members)
the opportunity to get to know
each other in ways that will help

them make their decisions about
living together," Singleton said.
"Rush Is more important than a
big party."
An altercation during last year's
Rush involving students who had
attended a Delta Upsilon Rush
party and a letter from Norm Rob
inson, associate dean of Student
Affairs, led the IFC to begin a criti
cal evaluation of present Rush
guidelines, Singleton said.
The letter from Robinson, sent
to Singleton during the summer,
suggested a re-examlnation of
current Rush policies.
A six-man committee was
formed fall quarter and includes
representatives from three of the
University's 11 housed fraterni
ties and one from an unhoused
fraternity. The committee began
examining the possibilities of
shortening Rush, limiting the use
of alcohol and changing the
event's format.
The committee's final proposals
were based on its own delibera
tions and responses to question
naires concerning the Rush exper
ience that the IFC distributed to
fraternity pledges last quarter.
Fraternal Affairs Adviser Joe
Pisano called the proposal "a good
step toward eliminating some of
the problems of Rush."
"The Committee deserves a lot
of credit. It's been almost 15 years


Joe Pisano

since anyone's taken a compre
hensive look at Rush. I'm really
quite pleased with the proposal
and I hope it gets the considera
tion it deserves," he said.
Pisano viewed the all-campus
meeting and the card system as
the most positive aspects of the
proposal, saying that it will help
fraternities better distinguish be
tween those who are genuinely in
terested in fraternity living and
those who are not.
Both Singleton and Pisano were

optimistic about the prospects of
IFC approval for the proposal and
said fraternity officers at Wednes
day night's meeting apppeared
supportive.
The proposal preserves the
length and basic format of Rush,
but restricts the fraternities to
serving only beer, wine and non
alcoholic beverages during the
first week. If approved, the new
Rush would still be three weeks
long. The all-campus meeting
would be on April 2, the first par
ties on April 6 and the conclusion
on April 26. The first and third
weeks would consist of evening
parties and the second week
would consist of afternoon par

ties. Fraternity parties would be
clustered according to housed fra
ternities' locations, and each fra
ternity would be able to give one
party between Monday and
Thursday.
The only difference from last
year would be that the space previ
ously occupied by the now un
recognized Delta Upsilon frater
nity will now be used by the un
housed Sigma Alpha Mu frater
nity.
If the proposal is not approved
by the IFC at its meeting in two
weeks, the committee will have to
formulate another proposal. "It's
all or nothing," Singleton said.
