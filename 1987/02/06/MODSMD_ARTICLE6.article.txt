# Troubles test Tresidder

### TOM OSCHERWITZ Staff writer 
Facing serious problems, which include locating
finances for new renovations and a Coffee House in
..ueed of upgrading _U> meet, health code standards,
University officials and student leaders say they will
press forward with plans to renovate Tresidder Un
ion despite the absence of a permanent director for
the center.
"I hope we can keep the ball rolling," said Paul
Szczesiul, acting director of Tresidder Union.
Szczesiul will act as interim director until a perman
ent director is appointed in eight to nine months.
Ellie Oppenheim, the former director, resigned last
month.
Szczesiul said Oppenheim's departure will not af
fect short-term renovation plans. The Union will still
enlarge the first floor dining area and will refurnish
the upper lobby by adding new carpeting, furniture
and meeting rooms, he said.
But, according to Dean of Student Affairs James
Lyons, long-term plans are more uncertain. The
questions of finance, how the renovations will fit
into the University's regional plans and Tresidder's
role in the University haven't been answered yet, he
said.
Major renovation plans currently under considera
tion include moving the Coffee House to the site of
the present computer facilities, moving The Store to
the Coffee House's current location, moving the Cor

ner Pocket to the present site of The Store and en
larging the Tresidder kitchen.
Plans for the new store include building extra shelf
space, renting VCRs and selling fresh fruit, fresh
baked breads and dairy products. The Coffee House
would occupy a much larger space, and the Corner
Pocket would be next to the kitchen.
One obstacle preventing major renovations is the
presence of LOTS computer facilities and Computer
Science Department offices located in Tresidder.
Lyons said the computer facility will be moved
from its current location by 1988 and will be put into
another temporary site if a permanent one cannot be
found.
Historically, Tresidder has been inadequately
maintained due to a lack of funds and University offi
cials agree that a postponement of Tresidder's
renovations beyond 1988 could have serious finan
cial consequences, Szczesiul said.
According to junior Grant Winfrey, chairman of
the Tresidder Union Board, Tresidder places a
higher priority on serving the needs of the commu
nity than on making profits. Tresidder remains open
during unprofitable periods such as late evenings,
weekends and school breaks, Winfrey said.
Winfrey added that the Coffee House site, in partic
ular, requires extensive renovations. "The Coffee
House is not up to health code," he said. x
Poor ventilation, the lack of an
exhaust system, insufficient elec
trical power and a very small food
preparation area are among the
Coffee House's structural
deficiencies.
If the proposed move of the Cof
fee House into the current com
puter site is delayed by more than
two years, "we could be forced by
the health department to make
substantial expenditures," said
Nancy Howe, Tresidder food direc
tor.
Howe estimated the cost of con
verting the food preparation area
into a modernized kitchen at
♦ 150,000.
Other Tresidder food services
also have problems. At The Store,
"the floor is wearing through and
the freezer's breaking," Winfrey
said. Corner Pocket workers have
to bring pizzas through the dining
room, he added.
The long-range plan is crucial to
the profitability of the food service
facilities, according to Howe. Rest
aurants traditionally have a per
iod of growth, then the number of
customers levels off and finally,
the restaurants experience a per
iod of decline, she said. At the Cof
fee House, the total customer
count has declined during the
past several years, she said, and
without a fresh Infusion of capi
tal, the Coffee House will continue
to lose customers.
In order to provide space for the
computer facilities currently lo
cated in Tresidder and to facilitate
renovation plans, officials are con

jointly any future additions.
Funding sources will Include
loans, private donations and al
locations from the capital expen
ditures section of the University
budget.
The cost of constructing the
second floor extension and ex
panding the first floor services will
total approximately $8 million.
Before Tresidder can Implement
its planned changes, its role in the
central campus must be deter

mined. Bacchetti added. Both
Lyons and Bacchetti said plans for
the central campus should be de
termined by the end of this year.
The central campus region in
cludes the Bookstore, the Stan
ford Press Building. White Plaza
and the Career Planning and
Placement Center.
Lyons also said he would like to
realign the focus of Tresidder Un
ion.
Currently, the community Un
ion functions as an independent
service center. Lyons said. Rather
than competing with other stu
dent programs, the Union "should
be agressively responsive to the
University." Tresidder should try
to integrate its services with the
community by providing a
meeting place and publicity for
community programs, he said.
"The Union should be more out
ward than inward looking," Lyons
added.
Winfrey, who currently serves
on a committee aimed at redefin
ing Tresidder's purpose, says the
new Tresidder will place an in
creased emphasis upon students
and non-commercial services.
According to Howe, food
services are a vital part of Tresid
der and should continue to play
an integral role. "Primarily, we
want the Union to be a place
where people can come and so
cialize. The food services are an
important magnet in getting
people here."
Carey White, a member of the
Council of Presidents (COP) said
the first priority for the COP is the
second-deck expansion of Tresid
der. There is a critical need for
student office space in the Union,
he said.

two years, "we could be forced by
the health department to make
substantial expenditures," said
Nancy Howe, Tresidder food direc
tor.
Howe estimated the cost of con
verting the food preparation area
into a modernized kitchen at
♦ 150,000.
Other Tresidder food services
also have problems. At The Store,
"the floor is wearing through and
the freezer's breaking," Winfrey
said. Corner Pocket workers have
to bring pizzas through the dining
room, he added.
The long-range plan is crucial to
the profitability of the food service
facilities, according to Howe. Rest
aurants traditionally have a per
iod of growth, then the number of
customers levels off and finally,
the restaurants experience a per
iod of decline, she said. At the Cof
fee House, the total customer
count has declined during the
past several years, she said, and
without a fresh Infusion of capi
tal, the Coffee House will continue
to lose customers.
In order to provide space for the
computer facilities currently lo
cated in Tresidder and to facilitate
renovation plans, officials are con

jointly any future additions.
Funding sources will Include
loans, private donations and al
locations from the capital expen
ditures section of the University
budget.
The cost of constructing the
second floor extension and ex
panding the first floor services will
total approximately $8 million.
Before Tresidder can Implement
its planned changes, its role in the
central campus must be deter

mined. Bacchetti added. Both
Lyons and Bacchetti said plans for
the central campus should be de
termined by the end of this year.
The central campus region in
cludes the Bookstore, the Stan
ford Press Building. White Plaza
and the Career Planning and
Placement Center.
Lyons also said he would like to
realign the focus of Tresidder Un
ion.
Currently, the community Un
ion functions as an independent
service center. Lyons said. Rather
than competing with other stu
dent programs, the Union "should
be agressively responsive to the
University." Tresidder should try
to integrate its services with the
community by providing a
meeting place and publicity for
community programs, he said.
"The Union should be more out
ward than inward looking," Lyons
added.
Winfrey, who currently serves
on a committee aimed at redefin
ing Tresidder's purpose, says the
new Tresidder will place an in
creased emphasis upon students
and non-commercial services.
According to Howe, food
services are a vital part of Tresid
der and should continue to play
an integral role. "Primarily, we
want the Union to be a place
where people can come and so
cialize. The food services are an
important magnet in getting
people here."
Carey White, a member of the
Council of Presidents (COP) said
the first priority for the COP is the
second-deck expansion of Tresid
der. There is a critical need for
student office space in the Union,
he said.

Facing serious problems, which include locating
finances for new renovations and a Coffee House in
..ueed of upgrading _U> meet, health code standards,
University officials and student leaders say they will
press forward with plans to renovate Tresidder Un
ion despite the absence of a permanent director for
the center.
"I hope we can keep the ball rolling," said Paul
Szczesiul, acting director of Tresidder Union.
Szczesiul will act as interim director until a perman
ent director is appointed in eight to nine months.
Ellie Oppenheim, the former director, resigned last
month.
Szczesiul said Oppenheim's departure will not af
fect short-term renovation plans. The Union will still
enlarge the first floor dining area and will refurnish
the upper lobby by adding new carpeting, furniture
and meeting rooms, he said.
But, according to Dean of Student Affairs James
Lyons, long-term plans are more uncertain. The
questions of finance, how the renovations will fit
into the University's regional plans and Tresidder's
role in the University haven't been answered yet, he
said.
Major renovation plans currently under considera
tion include moving the Coffee House to the site of
the present computer facilities, moving The Store to
the Coffee House's current location, moving the Cor

ner Pocket to the present site of The Store and en
larging the Tresidder kitchen.
Plans for the new store include building extra shelf
space, renting VCRs and selling fresh fruit, fresh
baked breads and dairy products. The Coffee House
would occupy a much larger space, and the Corner
Pocket would be next to the kitchen.
One obstacle preventing major renovations is the
presence of LOTS computer facilities and Computer
Science Department offices located in Tresidder.
Lyons said the computer facility will be moved
from its current location by 1988 and will be put into
another temporary site if a permanent one cannot be
found.
Historically, Tresidder has been inadequately
maintained due to a lack of funds and University offi
cials agree that a postponement of Tresidder's
renovations beyond 1988 could have serious finan
cial consequences, Szczesiul said.
According to junior Grant Winfrey, chairman of
the Tresidder Union Board, Tresidder places a
higher priority on serving the needs of the commu
nity than on making profits. Tresidder remains open
during unprofitable periods such as late evenings,
weekends and school breaks, Winfrey said.
Winfrey added that the Coffee House site, in partic
ular, requires extensive renovations. "The Coffee
House is not up to health code," he said. x
Poor ventilation, the lack of an
exhaust system, insufficient elec
trical power and a very small food
preparation area are among the
Coffee House's structural
deficiencies.
If the proposed move of the Cof
fee House into the current com
puter site is delayed by more than
two years, "we could be forced by
the health department to make
substantial expenditures," said
Nancy Howe, Tresidder food direc
tor.
