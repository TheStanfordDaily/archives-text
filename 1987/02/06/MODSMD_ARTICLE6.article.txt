# Troubles test Tresidder

### TOM OSCHERWITZ Staff writer 
Facing serious problems, which include locating
finances for new renovations and a Coffee House in
..ueed of upgrading _U> meet, health code standards,
University officials and student leaders say they will
press forward with plans to renovate Tresidder Un
ion despite the absence of a permanent director for
the center.
"I hope we can keep the ball rolling," said Paul
Szczesiul, acting director of Tresidder Union.
Szczesiul will act as interim director until a perman
ent director is appointed in eight to nine months.
Ellie Oppenheim, the former director, resigned last
month.
Szczesiul said Oppenheim's departure will not af
fect short-term renovation plans. The Union will still
enlarge the first floor dining area and will refurnish
the upper lobby by adding new carpeting, furniture
and meeting rooms, he said.
But, according to Dean of Student Affairs James
Lyons, long-term plans are more uncertain. The
questions of finance, how the renovations will fit
into the University's regional plans and Tresidder's
role in the University haven't been answered yet, he
said.
Major renovation plans currently under considera
tion include moving the Coffee House to the site of
the present computer facilities, moving The Store to
the Coffee House's current location, moving the Cor

ner Pocket to the present site of The Store and en
larging the Tresidder kitchen.
Plans for the new store include building extra shelf
space, renting VCRs and selling fresh fruit, fresh
baked breads and dairy products. The Coffee House
would occupy a much larger space, and the Corner
Pocket would be next to the kitchen.
One obstacle preventing major renovations is the
presence of LOTS computer facilities and Computer
Science Department offices located in Tresidder.
Lyons said the computer facility will be moved
from its current location by 1988 and will be put into
another temporary site if a permanent one cannot be
found.
Historically, Tresidder has been inadequately
maintained due to a lack of funds and University offi
cials agree that a postponement of Tresidder's
renovations beyond 1988 could have serious finan
cial consequences, Szczesiul said.
According to junior Grant Winfrey, chairman of
the Tresidder Union Board, Tresidder places a
higher priority on serving the needs of the commu
nity than on making profits. Tresidder remains open
during unprofitable periods such as late evenings,
weekends and school breaks, Winfrey said.
Winfrey added that the Coffee House site, in partic
ular, requires extensive renovations. "The Coffee
House is not up to health code," he said. x
