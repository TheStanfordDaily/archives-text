The business book invasion
has begun.
A walk into any bookstore
will reveal untold stacks of
books claiming to contain solu
tions to the many problems en
countered by businesses.
The proliferation of general
business books is a national
trend. The best selling book of
1985 was the business autobi
ography "lacocca." Other books
that topped the charts include
"In Search of Excellence" and
"What They Don't Teach You at
Harvard Business School."
"In the past five years, sales
of commercial business books
have skyrocketed." says Mark
Ouimet. general book buyer for
the Stanford Bookstore.
Publishers are scrambling to
expand their business book in
ventories in an effort to capi

talize on the current boom.
New companies, such as
Amacom Books and Probus
Publishing, that deal only with
business-related titles have
sprung into existence
nationwide.
Chain bookstores such as B.
Dalton allocate 10 to 20 percent
of shelf space to business books
alone. Even the Stanford
Bookstore underwent a sub
stantial expansion in the busi
ness book area; a large part of
the first floor is now devoted to
the subject.
The vast amount of business
literature available these days
can overwhelm even the
seasoned businessperson.
Experts In the field are
churning out new solutions to
age-old problems. Product de
velopment blues? Go with
"Interpreneurship," a system de
signed to encourage innovation in
large companies.
Or maybe it's a problem with
Japanese competition. That's easy
enough to deal with; just do as the
Japanese themselves do and set
up "quality circles" for manage
ment and labor to discuss produc
tivity and product quality.
But books aimed at company ex
ecutives are not the only ones en
joying increased popularity. In
cluded in the boom are books that
are also targeted at the general
public.
Interested in personal finance?
Try the books "How to Pay Zero
Taxes" or "How to Make It When
You're Cash-Poor."
Want to know what it's like to be
a corporate chief? Try "Staying at
the Top" or "The Naked Manager:
Games Executives Play."
Starting a business? Try "How
to Work the Competition into the
Ground and Have Fun Doing It."
Ouimet says he believes the new
trend is toward marketing. "In the
early '80s, management tech
niques were more popular. But
people realize now that manage
ment doesn't sell things, market
ing does," he says.

Ouimet notes that the Stanford
Bookstore recorded a 209 percent
increase in sales of marketing
related books last year.
Books such as "lacocca" —
chronicles of the trials and
tribulations of the corporate exec
utive officer — have met with ex
traordinary successes. Tales of
corporate struggle and victory,
such as John Love's "McDonalds:
Behind the Arches," also receive
an enthusiastic reception from
readers.
Jayne Pearl, publicity agent for
Tom Peters, co-author of the best
selling management books "In
Search of Excellence" and "A Pas
sion for Excellence," says she sees
the business book trend shifting
from marketing and management
tutorials to autobiographies of ex
ecutives and profiles of successful
companies.
"People want to read about how
other people have made it," she
says.
Some, like Henry Morgan, dean
of Boston University's School of
Management, attribute the im
mense popularity of how-to busi
ness books to the problems beset
ting Industries today, such as
foreign competition, deregulation
and technological change.
Business executives are
"groping for better ways to
manage," Morgan told Newsweek

in May 1985.
Stephen Kippur, head of the
business/law/general books divi
sion of publisher John Wiley and
Sons, has his own theory on the
surging business book market.
"First off," he said last month in
Sky Magazine, "business is a
much more common interest of
many more people than it was in
the '60s.
"It's an overall cultural change
— people are more focused on ad
vancing their careers and on
making money," he concluded.
So what's the impact of the slew
of business material flooding
today's market? Is the magic ad
vertised in these books making
success stories out of run-of-the
mill businesses?
The authors would probably
swear by their individual tech
niques, but others are skeptical of
the new theories. As one
anonymous marketing manager
told Newsweek, "In the past 18
months, we have heard that profit
is more important than revenue,
that quality is more important
than profit, that people are more
important than profit, that cus
tomers are more important than
our people, that big customers are
more important than small cus
tomers and that growth is key to
our success. No wonder our per
formance is inconsistent."
