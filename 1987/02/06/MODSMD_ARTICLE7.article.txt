The business book invasion
has begun.
A walk into any bookstore
will reveal untold stacks of
books claiming to contain solu
tions to the many problems en
countered by businesses.
The proliferation of general
business books is a national
trend. The best selling book of
1985 was the business autobi
ography "lacocca." Other books
that topped the charts include
"In Search of Excellence" and
"What They Don't Teach You at
Harvard Business School."
"In the past five years, sales
of commercial business books
have skyrocketed." says Mark
Ouimet. general book buyer for
the Stanford Bookstore.
Publishers are scrambling to
expand their business book in
ventories in an effort to capi

talize on the current boom.
New companies, such as
Amacom Books and Probus
Publishing, that deal only with
business-related titles have
sprung into existence
nationwide.
Chain bookstores such as B.
Dalton allocate 10 to 20 percent
of shelf space to business books
alone. Even the Stanford
Bookstore underwent a sub
stantial expansion in the busi
ness book area; a large part of
the first floor is now devoted to
the subject.
The vast amount of business
literature available these days
can overwhelm even the
seasoned businessperson.
