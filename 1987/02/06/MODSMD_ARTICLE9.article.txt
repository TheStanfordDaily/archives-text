Conference on terrorism canceled
WASHINGTON — The Reagan administration yesterday can
celed plans for an International meeting to consider strategy
against terrorism after Britain. France and West Germany refused
to attend because they were afraid that the session would provoke
kidnappers in Lebanon to harm their hostages.
At the same time, the Pentagon announced a partial reduction
of its naval armada off the Lebanese coast, apparently in an effort
to ease fears of a U.S. military response to the hostage crisis.
Taken together, the steps deflated a U.S. effort to put psycholog
ical pressure on shadowy Lebanese groups that are holding at
least 26 foreigners, including eight Americans. The administra
tion pulled back because the prospect of U.S. military action
seemed to frighten the nation's European allies more than the ter
rorists.
European sources said that Britain, France and West Germany,
all of which have nationals among the hostages in Lebanon, were
worried that the kidnappers might react by harming the hostages.
For the same reason, these sources said, the Europeans also
opposed the U.S. naval buildup In the eastern Mediterranean.
Soviets to resume nuclear testing
MOSCOW — The Soviet Union announced plans yesterday to
resume nuclear testing after an 18-month pause, saying the deci
sion was necessary because of growing risks to its security inter
ests and the refusal of the United States to observe a mutual ban
on nuclear explosions.
Soviet officials, however, offered hope that a joint moratorium
could eventually be arranged that would lead to an ultimate, per
manent ban on nuclear testing to be agreed to by the super
powers.
Deputy Foreign Minister Vladimir Petrovsky said that as soon as
the U.S. administration halted nuclear testing, the Soviets would
follow suit. He also said that Moscow would be willing to pursue
compromise steps toward a complete ban, including a joint reduc
tion in the frequency and yield of nuclear tests.
The Soviet announcement followed the first American nuclear
explosion this year at a Nevada testing ground on Tuesday. The
Soviet leadership declared last December that Moscow would be
compelled to end its unilateral moratorium after the first U.S. test
in 1987.
Calling the American test this week a "cynical act," Petrovsky
said, "By this provocative step, the American administration has
rejected the example of the Soviet Union and its calls to convert
the moratorium Into a two-way measure to halt the arms race."
Abrams predicts contra victory
WASHINGTON — Nlcaraguan rebels can win their guerrilla war
against the leftist Sandinista regime in two to four years if the
United States continues to give them military aid, the Reagan ad
ministration said yesterday.
Elliott Abrams. assistant secretary of state for inter-American
affairs, testifying before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee,
said that he believes the Nlcaraguan government is "wildly un
popular" and that the rebels, known as the contras, will quickly
force the Sandinista army onto the defensive.
Abrams said that the administration defines success for the
contras not as "a straight-out military victory, as we won in World
War II," but as a "political victory like the Sandinistas had in
1979," when the dictatorship of Anastasio Somoza collapsed.
"How long will it take to win?" Sen. Joseph Biden (D-Del.)
asked.
"I hate to be pinned down in time, but I'll give you an answer,"
Abrams said. "We think it will take two to four years."
His prediction, however, was met with open skepticism both by
Republicans and Democrats that the contras, who have been
fighting for more than five years, are capable of exerting serious
pressure on the Soviet-armed Sandinistas.
Wave of killings shakes Columbia
BOGOTA, Colombia — A recent wave of drug-related killings of
Judges, journalists and government officials is shaking Colom
bia's establishment and instilling widespread fear.
The 6-month-old government of President Vlrgilio Barco has in
tensified policing of the narcotics trade. It showed a rare deter
mination this week to move against even the biggest bosses by ar
resting and rapidly extraditing to the United States one of Colom
bia's most notorious reputed cocaine traffickers, Carlos Lehder
Rivas.
But the assassinations, for which few suspects have been ar
rested. have left justice and law enforcement in this country
looking painfully weak. Despite nearly three years of antl
narcotlcs efforts heralded by U.S. authorities as a Latin American
model, senior government officials concede their forces are still no
match for the cocaine operators who. with caravans of
bodyguards, have continued to move through the otreets of major
cities.
Amid a new round of press stories detailing police corruption
and Intimidation of judges, growing numbers of Colombians are
questioning whether the loss of lives by those brave enough to
fight is worth what so far has seemed to be a largely futile battle.
Chinese press adopts negative view
PEKING — It has been a busy few weeks for Chinese journalists
In the United States. There has been a lot of bad news there to
cover.
In recent weeks. Washington correspondents for the official New
China News Agency have been spending their time on a U.S. De
partment of Justice report about violent crime and another one
about the prevalence of heart disease in America.
On Jan. 19, the news agency's New York correspondent. He
Chengzhang, tried his hand at the sort of local story that would
not ordinarily be covered by the Chinese: a Long Island Rail Road
strike.
"Thousands of stranded Long Island commuters today must
find alternative ways of getting to work," his story began.
These are but a few examples of the decidedly negative new ap
proach that the official Chinese press is taking toward the United
States these days.
For the last month, Chinese newspapers and radio and televi
sion stations have devoted increasing amounts of time and space
to showing the Chinese public the darker side of American life.
Diplomats here say it is evident that the Communist Party is
directing a new propaganda campaign against the United States.
Trade policy emerging in Congress
WASHINGTON — Key House leaders appear to be backing away
from the overtly protectionist measures they Included In trade
legislation last year, signaling an emerging bipartisan consensus
on trade policy in both houses of Congress.
In a very active day for trade politics on Capitol Hill yesterday.
Senate Finance Committee Chairman Lloyd Bentsen (D-Tex.)
flanked by 15 other members, went before television cameras to
introduce a bill to beef up enforcement of existing trade laws.
Meanwhile, several lawmakers In the House. Including Rep.
Don Bonker (D-Wash.). the chairman of the House Democratic
trade task force, suggested that they might be willing to abandon
the idea of Imposing sanctions against Japan. Brazil and other
nations for running large trade surpluses with the United States,
a central sticking point on the Issue.
