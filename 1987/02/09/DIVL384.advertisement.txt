Your parenLs sent you to Stanford...
so on Valentine's Day (or Mother's or Father's Day),send Stanford to
your parents!
The newest book by Dr. Herant Katchadourian makes a unique gift
that will let your parents know you're thinking about them.
Most parents probably have a shelf-load of books on how to better
understand their children; 50: MIDLIFE IN PERSPECTIVE is the
book that helps kids understand their parents, and gives parents in
sight into themselves.
We'll mail your gift for you-we'll even pay your postage! All you
need to do is bring your own Valentine's card (or use one of our gift
cards) to Bowman Alumni House today or tomorrow with your
$9.95 payment. Your gift will be shipped UPS (orders received
before 11:00 a.m. will be sent the same day). Gifts for Mother's Day
(May 10) or Father's Day (June 21) will be sent with one of our gift
cards two weeks prior to the holiday.
50: MIDLIFE IN PERSPECTIVE is the latest volume in The Hor
rible Stanford book series published by the Stanford Alumni Associ
ation.

The Director of the Radcliffe Publishing Course, a
