# DUs lose national charter
## 
### DIANE BISGEIER Senior staff writer 
National officials of the Delta
Upsilon fraternity have notified
Stanford members and pledges
that they "will not be permitted to
operate as a chapter until fall
1989 or later" and have ordered
Scott Hartman, the fraternity's
president, to "show cause" for the
chapter to avoid suspension.
The notification came from the
group's national board of direc
tors in a letter dated Feb. 3 that
was sent to all pledges as well as
active members.
The DUs. were suspended by the
University last May in response to
several disruptive incidents in
volving DU members, including a
fight that nearly resulted in the
death of one student after a Rush
party April 10. Citing a lengthy
history of DU-related incidents,
which also included the flooding
of the fraternity house two years
ago and the the throwing of a bur
ning couch off a third-floor bal
cony. University officals revoked
recognition of the Stanford chap
ter and terminated its housing
privileges.
In the letter, Thomas Hansen,
DU executive director, stated that
"irresponsible behavior associated
with the name of Delta Upsilon
must cease immediately."
The letter sent to active mem
bers stated that their status was
as alumni fraternity members.
In a separate letter sent to cur
rent pledges, Hansen demanded
that they "immediately cease the
use of the registered trademarks
of Delta Upsilon fraternity, includ
ing the words Delta Upsilon, the
letters DU' and the Greek letters
Delta Upsilon, and the Coat of
Arms of the Fraternity."
"I guess I was not surprised by
the receipt of (the) letter." said
senior Ted Muftic. "I kind of ex
pected it. It was probably a direct
result of us being kicked off
campus."
Muftic said that the national
board probably acted as the result
of public attention, but added that
"there are a lot more serious inci
dents that occur nationally at
other universities" that don't
result in suspension.
"I imagine the University is
quite willing to cooperate with the
national board and was pretty
happy to give them this informa
4ion," he said.
In addition to the incidents that
led up to the suspension of the fra
ternity last May. two DUs pledges
were evicted from Hurlburt last
month after they were linked to
vandalism that occurred on the
Row Jan. 15.
The Stanford chapter is nearly
"91 years old," the letter stated.
