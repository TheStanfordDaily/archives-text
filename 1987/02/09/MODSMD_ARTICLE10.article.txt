### RUSSELL KOROBKIN Editorial staff 
Stanford Out of South Africa (SOSA), the
Black Student Union (BSU) and members of
the ASSU Senate will hold a sit-in today to
protest the University's investments in com
panies that do business in South Africa, mem
bers of those organizations said yesterday.
The protest corresponds with meetings of
the University Board of Trustees scheduled for
today and tomorrow.
The sit-in has the dual purpose of maintain
ing "our presence in the minds of the trustees"
and keeping the "level of awareness of campus
at a reasonable level," according to SOSA mem
ber Bill Minyard.
According to ASSU Senator Stacey Ley ton.
one of the sit-in's organizers, the protesters
will not reveal the location of the sit-in until

noon to avoid being "locked out" of buildings
by the University Administration. She said the
group has a right to be in University buildings
until 5 p.m.
Minyard said the protest would be legal and
the group would not do anything that would
result in arrests.
He also said he was expecting a crowd of 20
to 30 people to participate in the protest and
said the divestment movement has remained
viable.
While "a couple of years ago the divestment
movement was much bigger than it is now."
student apathy is not to blame for the issue's
loss of momentum, he said.
"South Africa has seriously clamped down
on information," keeping the country out of
the news and making it harder for students to
find out about the repressive actions of the
white minority government, he said.

Leyton said she thinks waning interest in di
vestment protests can be attributed to people
seeing "the trustees as being intransigent."
The leaders of the protest said they think the
protest will send a message to the trustees
despite the anticipated small turnout. Leyton
said the sit-in is "supposed to be a reminder to
the trustees" and will show that students still
do care about divestment.
While admitting that a larger group would be
more Impressive, Minyard said that "a small
group of very vocal students is a much better
signal to send the trustees than no group at
all."
The event's organizers said that during the
sit-in. protesters will discuss the issue of di
vestment. Faculty members are being sought
to participate, Minyard said adding that SOSA
was focusing its energy on education at the
present time. "The movement at this point is
at a building phase." he said.
