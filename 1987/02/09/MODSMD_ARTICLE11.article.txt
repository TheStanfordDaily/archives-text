# New microchip will aid search for extra-terrestrials

### INGRID WICKELGREN Staff writer 
In search of extraterrestrial life, Stan
ford engineers have developed a micro
chip that will expand their capacity to
detect artificial signals within and beyond
this galaxy, according to Stanford scien
tist Ivan Linscott.
The chip was developed by a team of
Stanford electrical engineering graduate
students led by Linscott, advised by Prof.
Allen Peterson and funded by NASA for
the last five years as part of their Search
for Extraterrestrial Intelligence (SETI)
program, Linscott said.
He said that the chip will be used in a
one-year-old machine thai ieads informa-

tion from radio waves from an antenna in
the Mojave desert.
Because of the vast quantities of noise
created by gaseous clouds, cosmic debris
and the 300 billion stars that make up
this galaxy, a high-performance, special
purpose computer is needed to process
the samples and identify the artificial sig
nals. said Linscott. senior research asso
ciate in the radioscience group of the
Space Telecommunication and Radios
cience Laboratory at Stanford.
The system, called a multichannel spec
trum analyzer (MCSA), monitors waves in
the microwave region of the spectrum,
the region with the least interference and
in which they believe extraterrestrials are
likely to send their signals, according to

Linscott.
Linscott said the current MCSA model,
without the new chip, simultaneously
monitors 72.000 one-hertz wide chan
nels. The new chip, called a SETI Digital
Signal Processing (DSP) Engine, will in
crease the number to 10 million chan
nels, still only a tiny fraction of the total
"microwave window." which is 10 billion
hertz wide.
One-hertz wide signals are monitored
In order to distinguish between natural
noise and artificial signals. The most nar
row of natural signals has a range of fre
quencies 1,000 times broader than an ar
tificial signal. A one-hertz wide signal
would probably be from an artificial
source, Linscott said.

The new chip requires only 78 boards
as opposed to the 2.000 boards necessary
for the current model. It is 8 millimeters
squared in area, contains 34,000 transis
tors, and can perform 80 million arith
metic operationss per second, according
to Bryn Eckroot. a graduate student on
the SETI DSP Engine design team.
The new chip is a technological
breakthrough and will give scientists
great capabilities in resource exploration,
medical imaging and failure analysis.
Linscott said.
MCSA has not yet pickec up any ex
traterrestrial signals, but it did success
fully detect an artificial signal from the
Pioneer 10 spacecraft outside the solar
system, according to Linscott.

Linscott said scientists haven't yet
scratched the surface In their search for
extraterrestrial life, but "we're building a
new machine to do some serious mining.
It's virgin ground and who knows what
we'll find, but 1 think we have a pretty
good chance (of detecting extraterrestrial
signals)."
Linscott said the cost of chip produc
tion was minimal for SETI. because a pro
gram for integrated systems supported by
the Department of Defense actually con
structed the chip. "It was a huge expense
for them.'' he said. "I don't know how
much it cost the taxpayer, but it was
cheap for us." he said. Peterson said
Stanford receives about *500,000 per
vear from NASA for SETI activities.
