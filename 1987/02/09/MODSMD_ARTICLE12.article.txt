### BISRAKHA DATTA Senior staff writer 
At Tresidder Union Friday, a
small group of Stanford students
protested the alleged role of Wells
Fargo Bank in helping to prolong
an 18-month long strike of Wat
sonville workers.
At noon a handful of students
distributed leaflets urging the
bank to "exert its considerable in
fluence" to settle the strike of

1,100 Mexican and Chicano
workers at the Watsonville Can
ning Co.
John Inda, an undeclared soph
omore, said the protest was held
to make people aware of the situa
tion the striking Chicano workers
face.
The strike began in September
1985 in response to proposed
wage cuts of 30 percent and to
cuts in benefits such as vacation
time and medical coverage.

Two protest coordinators, Inda
and Michael Schmitz, a 1986
graduate, claimed Wells Fargo
played a key role in helping the
company hold out against the
strikers' demands. A similar
protest was held at the Wells Fargo
branch in Berkeley, they said.
Roger Cruzen, a bank spokes
man in San Francisco, confirmed
that the bank had "a lending rela
tion to the canning company."

However, he said that the bank
had not filed any papers "saying
that the (Watsonville Canning)
company has defaulted on its
loans, which is the first step
toward foreclosure."
According to the protesters.
Wells Fargo loaned the owner of
Watsonville Canning *18 million
five days before the strike. This
amount was "used to finance the
first year of the strike." they said.
