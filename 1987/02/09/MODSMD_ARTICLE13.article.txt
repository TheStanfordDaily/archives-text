## THE 						STANFORD DAILY An Independent Newspaper Why raise tuition? 
### 
The Stanford Board of Trustees will meet
tomorrow to discuss, among other things,
how much to raise tuition for the upcoming
academic year. There is little doubt that the
Board will vote an increase of $672, to
$11,880, the amount recommended by the
Administration.
Last year the inflation rate was 4 percent,
but the tuition increase was nearly 7 per
cent. This past year inflation was barely 1
percent, but the requested increase amounts
to 6 percent. Perhaps, if tuition were indexed
to inflation, increases would be more easily
understood. As it stands, the growing cost of
a Stanford education is not only hard to ex
plain but a disturbing trend.
Rising tuition is hardly a problem unique
to Stanford. However. Stanford can be
unique in dealing with the problem now.
When the cost of attending a top private uni
versity becomes too high, some prospective
students will think twice about paying the
price. Minority students and economically
disadvantaged groups are affected the most;
too often, students will not even apply to a
school because of its hefty tuition figure.
Consequently, the diversity that schools

such as Stanford work so hard to foster suf
fers because the student body contains a
smaller percentage of these disadvantaged
students.
None of this is to suggest that Stanford is
doing nothing about the problem. University
President Donald Kennedy has spoken about
his concern that students may be leaving
school too deep in debt. Part of the money
raised during the Centennial campaign is
earmarked for financial aid. Most impor
tantly. the University remains committed to
its need-blind admissions policy. These ac
tions are to be commended, but they do not
address the central issue: The total cost of a
Stanford education.
Keeping tuition costs down will not be
easy, but it is an important and worthwhile
goal. It will be easy for the board to approve
the recommended tuition increase; in the
short run, the consequences will be minimal.
Unless something is done, however, the ef
fect will be felt in the long run. If Stanford
wants to continue to attract the best stu
dents, without regard to their financial
status, this trend of ever-increasing tuition
must come to an end.
