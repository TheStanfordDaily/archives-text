# Vote-getting production value
## 
### 
One of my favorite political cartoons of late
shows two good old country boys, a la Bartles
and James, sitting at a gas station. It's election
time, and one guy says to the other: "1 gotta go
with this Lundeen fella, Pervis. . . . His TV
spots have slicker production value and have
positioned the candidate well with a media
buy that targets an upscale market, vote-wise."
Sad but true.

Journalist Daniel Schorr once said that tele
vision is a terrible medium for transmitting
stationary information — documents, essays,
etc. But that same medium is an incredibly
dynamic force for transmitting moving infor
mation — people. Washington knows this and
plays the game of image-building smart. Very
smart.
Exhibit A' is. of course, our very own Presi
dent Ronald Reagan. The charming, likeable
ex-actor takes to the screen like a fish to water.
Despite screams of "teflon image," the Gipper
managed to carry 49 states in the 1984 elec
tion.
Following the Reagan landslide, everybody
has been trying to get into the act. My favorite

is Democratic presidential contender Sen. Joe
Biden of Delaware. Times-Tribune columnist
Mark Simon, covering the recent California
Democratic party convention, captured the
idea rather nicely when he wrote: " 'Gloom on
the horizon' is to be for Biden's campaign in
1988 what 'new ideas' was for Sen. Gary Hart's
presidential campaign in 1984: a theme to
capture the mood of the American people as it
develops next year."
Say you heard it here first: A man named
Patrick Caddell got paid big bucks to tell Joe
Biden that "gloom on the horizon" would
capture the mood of the American people.
Remember Jesse Jackson's "Rainbow Coali
tion"? That's quite a step up from "Tippecanoe
and Tyler too." In fact, the Smithsonian
Museum of American History can show just
how big a step it is; it dedicated an entire ex
hibit to buttons, slogans and strategies used
in past political campaigns. "Campaigning" or
"electioneering" has gradually emerged from a
few gimmicks to a full-fledged science — a sci
ence with big computers and big brains to stay
abreast of the latest political developments.
Behind every candidate is a massive network
of specialists who focus on particular aspects
of the campaign. Together, these people
"package" the candidate and "sell" him to you
— just like a life insurance policy.
There are people called "campaign
managers" and "political consultants" who do
everything from scheduling public appear
ances to giving advice on hot issues. There are
people who raise funds. There are people who

monitor public opinion polls. There are media
spokesmen, speechwriters . . . the list goes on.
Those of you who remember the recent Cali
fornia senatorial contest between Alan
Cranston and Ed Zschau undoubtedly heard
the cry, "It was the dirtiest campaign in his
tory." When asked about the low blows and po
litical cheap shots, the two camps replied. "It
works."
My roommate tells me there was a movie
called "Power" that focused on the tactics in
volved in running a political campaign. In it.
he said that the candidate's main adviser had
a success percentage of 80 percent. A
percentage? You mean they keep track of that?
You betcha. It just goes to remind us that
our "impressions" are not really impressions
at all. A huge amount of time, money and man
power went into making that person seem
"tough" or "sharp" or "nice." The finished
package you saw was sealed, wrapped and
signed by,a large number of people.
So one is regretably forced to ask, "If the guy
I'm thinking about voting for had his speech
written for him, his funds raised for him, the
media coaxed into coverage for him. the audi
ence selected for him. the travel arrangements
made for him, his suit tailored for him and
probably his hair combed for him, then who
the hell is this guy?
All of which makes us turn to the sports sec
tion and cheer for the victory in the America's
Cup.
