# Don't negotiate with the PLO
## 
### 
In a recent viewpoint (Daily, Jan. 30), Blair
King called for a more pragmatic approach to
the Israeli-Palestinian problem. He suggested
that negotiations between the Palestinian
Liberation Organization (PLO) and Israel
would be the easiest road to peace in that
troubled region. Unfortunately, there are three
main faults with this solution.
First, the PLO as a group (if viewed as a
single unit), resorts to terrorism to fulfill its
"policy goals." and therefore should not be
recognized, let alone negotiated with. Second,
the PLO is splintered into so many radical
groups that it can no longer be considered one
entity. Finally, the PLO should not be consid
ered a legitimate representative of the Palestin
ian people.

KOLEMAN STRUMPH

To begin with, there is a very clear definition
of terrorism that separates PLO action from Is
raeli action. Israeli actions, whether one
agrees with their purpose or not. have some
military objective as their end goal. Hence, the
recent bombings of Palestinian camps in
Lebanon were aimed at preventing a resur
gence of terrorism against Israeli citizens. A
similar claim could not be made about PLO
tactics. Its tactics are scare tactics, with no
military goal in mind; it is attempting to try
the wills of the Israelis.
Of course, these moves are well orchestrated
by the PLO. An adviser to PLO leader Yasir
Arafat said it was "no coincidence" that trou
ble had broken out in Lebanon and the West
Bank through armed strength. The PLO Is
simply trying too harass Israel into negotia
tions. Would a nation led by the PLO act any
differently? That is unlikely. It would continue
to use terrorism.
The PLO's adherence to terrorism is rooted
in its founding document, the Palestinian Na
tional Covenant. After a brief lapse of
"moderation" iri the late 19705, the PLO and
Arafat have returned to close adherence to this
treatise. Indeed, at a recent meeting in Moscow
of the main PLO factions, the covenant was
reaffirmed. What most people do not realize is
that this document is more than just a declara
tion. but also a formal call to arms against the
Israeli state.

This brings me to the second point: The PLO
is unstable and disunified. When someone
refers to the PLO. there are indeed a variety of
people and ideologies he or she may have in
mind. Most Americans' image of the PLO is
based on the actions of the mainstream Fatah
movement, led by Yasir Arafat. But numerous
groups are also under the PLO umbrella. There
is George Habash's Popular Front for the
Liberation of Palestine (PFLP), a Libyan
supported Marxist faction, which split from
the PLO in 1974 but returned to the organiza
tion in 1981 — yet still opposes Yasir Arafat as
the leader of the PLO. Also, there is the Demo
cratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine un
der Nairn al-Ashahab, which is strictly
Marxist-Leninist and maintains close ties with
Moscow. All of these groups can or do have rep
resentation on the Palestine National Council,
the PLO's governing body, and hence must be
considered part of the vague unit, "the PLO."
What all of this amounts to is that Israel can
not simply negotiate with "the PLO," but
rather must choose which faction to deal with.
Israel would obviously pick the most moderate
of the groups. A 1 Fatah, but. unfortunately,
the moderate groups are forced into more ex
treme positions because of the radical fac
tions. Threats of secession from the PLO. the
formation of counter-Palestinian liberation
groups and even attempted assassinations are
all possibilities that the Fatah must keep in
mind when it makes policy. Hence, the radical
influence is actually quite large within the
PLO. Of course, this is not a stable situation,
and the amount of fighting within the PLO
limits its ability to attain its goals. Moreover,
many of the groups, frustrated by others'
demands, act unilaterally through terrorism.
This further destabilizes the group and pushes
it toward additional extremism. Hence, the
PLO does not truly represent a unified,
moderate group, as King implied, but rather a
variety of fanatical subgroups that are both
splitting the PLO apart and pushing It toward
further terrorism.
In addition, there are questions of corrup
tion within the PLO. There were reports last
June that the PLO had been secretly amassing
a fortune by sidetracking" money sent to it as
humanitarian aid and placing it In secret bank
accounts in Switzerland. Lebanon and Jor
dan: this is effectively doing the same thing
that drove Marcos and "Baby Doc" Duvalier
from their countries. This crisis further split
the PLO factions.

Finally, there Is the question of whether the
PLO Is truly representative of the Palestinian
people or merely a group trying to further its
own political ambitions. The PLO strenuously
opposed the offer of Jordon's King Hussein to
pump *1 billion over five years into the largely
Palestinian West Bank on the grounds that it
had "imperialistic motives." Is the PLO ar
guing that Jordan is trying to reinforce the Is
raeli position in the territory by supporting
further settlements? This is ludicrous. Jordan
still maintains a claim over the area. Indeed,
the money would have been used to improve
health facilities and improve living conditions
of the Palestinians in the West Bank. If this
had happened, the PLO would have lost influ
ence in the area. The PLO thrives and spreads
when there is dissatisfaction among the Pales
tinians, so any increase in their welfare \yould
harm It. If anything, the PLO must hope\|hat
Israeli Palestinians are repressed. Clearly, the
motive behind the PLO action is to insure its
own power base and not to represent the
majority of Palestinians. PLO members are po
litical opportunists in the truest sense of the
word — not representatives of the needs and
desires of the Palestinian people.
Putting all of this aside, there still seems no
reason for Israel to negotiate with the PLO.
Besides lacking the credentials as a represen
tative of the Palestinian people, the PLO is be
coming more and more a Soviet-allied group.
The recent PLO reunification attempt was held
in Moscow and Prague and highly praised by
the Kremlin. The Israelis would have to be sus
picious. Is the Soviet Union trying to bolster Its
limited position in the Middle East through a
rebel group, as it has done in the past in South
Africa and Central America? Fear of becoming
a pawn in the East/West power struggle is an
other reason for Israel not to negotiate with the
PLO.
But most importantly, the fact is. in the
status quo. it is Israel rather than the PLO
which controls the Palestinian lands. This
places the burden for initial action directly
upon the PLO. It is up to them to accept U.N.
Resolution 242. which recognizes Israel's right
to exist, before the Israelis even consider
negotiating with them. Thus, the best Israeli
(as well as U.S.) foreign policy move would be
no move at all. Forced negotiations would be a
disaster to all.

from their countries. This crisis further split
the PLO factions.

Finally, there Is the question of whether the
PLO Is truly representative of the Palestinian
people or merely a group trying to further its
own political ambitions. The PLO strenuously
opposed the offer of Jordon's King Hussein to
pump *1 billion over five years into the largely
Palestinian West Bank on the grounds that it
had "imperialistic motives." Is the PLO ar
guing that Jordan is trying to reinforce the Is
raeli position in the territory by supporting
further settlements? This is ludicrous. Jordan
still maintains a claim over the area. Indeed,
the money would have been used to improve
health facilities and improve living conditions
of the Palestinians in the West Bank. If this
had happened, the PLO would have lost influ
ence in the area. The PLO thrives and spreads
when there is dissatisfaction among the Pales
tinians, so any increase in their welfare \yould
harm It. If anything, the PLO must hope\|hat
Israeli Palestinians are repressed. Clearly, the
motive behind the PLO action is to insure its
own power base and not to represent the
majority of Palestinians. PLO members are po
litical opportunists in the truest sense of the
word — not representatives of the needs and
desires of the Palestinian people.
Putting all of this aside, there still seems no
reason for Israel to negotiate with the PLO.
Besides lacking the credentials as a represen
tative of the Palestinian people, the PLO is be
coming more and more a Soviet-allied group.
The recent PLO reunification attempt was held
in Moscow and Prague and highly praised by
the Kremlin. The Israelis would have to be sus
picious. Is the Soviet Union trying to bolster Its
limited position in the Middle East through a
rebel group, as it has done in the past in South
Africa and Central America? Fear of becoming
a pawn in the East/West power struggle is an
other reason for Israel not to negotiate with the
PLO.
But most importantly, the fact is. in the
status quo. it is Israel rather than the PLO
which controls the Palestinian lands. This
places the burden for initial action directly
upon the PLO. It is up to them to accept U.N.
Resolution 242. which recognizes Israel's right
to exist, before the Israelis even consider
negotiating with them. Thus, the best Israeli
(as well as U.S.) foreign policy move would be
no move at all. Forced negotiations would be a
disaster to all.

In a recent viewpoint (Daily, Jan. 30), Blair
King called for a more pragmatic approach to
the Israeli-Palestinian problem. He suggested
that negotiations between the Palestinian
Liberation Organization (PLO) and Israel
would be the easiest road to peace in that
troubled region. Unfortunately, there are three
main faults with this solution.
First, the PLO as a group (if viewed as a
single unit), resorts to terrorism to fulfill its
"policy goals." and therefore should not be
recognized, let alone negotiated with. Second,
the PLO is splintered into so many radical
groups that it can no longer be considered one
entity. Finally, the PLO should not be consid
ered a legitimate representative of the Palestin
ian people.

KOLEMAN STRUMPH

To begin with, there is a very clear definition
of terrorism that separates PLO action from Is
raeli action. Israeli actions, whether one
agrees with their purpose or not. have some
military objective as their end goal. Hence, the
recent bombings of Palestinian camps in
Lebanon were aimed at preventing a resur
gence of terrorism against Israeli citizens. A
similar claim could not be made about PLO
tactics. Its tactics are scare tactics, with no
military goal in mind; it is attempting to try
the wills of the Israelis.
Of course, these moves are well orchestrated
by the PLO. An adviser to PLO leader Yasir
Arafat said it was "no coincidence" that trou
ble had broken out in Lebanon and the West
Bank through armed strength. The PLO Is
simply trying too harass Israel into negotia
tions. Would a nation led by the PLO act any
differently? That is unlikely. It would continue
to use terrorism.
The PLO's adherence to terrorism is rooted
in its founding document, the Palestinian Na
tional Covenant. After a brief lapse of
"moderation" iri the late 19705, the PLO and
Arafat have returned to close adherence to this
treatise. Indeed, at a recent meeting in Moscow
of the main PLO factions, the covenant was
reaffirmed. What most people do not realize is
that this document is more than just a declara
tion. but also a formal call to arms against the
Israeli state.

This brings me to the second point: The PLO
is unstable and disunified. When someone
refers to the PLO. there are indeed a variety of
people and ideologies he or she may have in
mind. Most Americans' image of the PLO is
based on the actions of the mainstream Fatah
movement, led by Yasir Arafat. But numerous
groups are also under the PLO umbrella. There
is George Habash's Popular Front for the
Liberation of Palestine (PFLP), a Libyan
supported Marxist faction, which split from
the PLO in 1974 but returned to the organiza
tion in 1981 — yet still opposes Yasir Arafat as
the leader of the PLO. Also, there is the Demo
cratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine un
der Nairn al-Ashahab, which is strictly
Marxist-Leninist and maintains close ties with
Moscow. All of these groups can or do have rep
resentation on the Palestine National Council,
the PLO's governing body, and hence must be
considered part of the vague unit, "the PLO."
What all of this amounts to is that Israel can
not simply negotiate with "the PLO," but
rather must choose which faction to deal with.
Israel would obviously pick the most moderate
of the groups. A 1 Fatah, but. unfortunately,
the moderate groups are forced into more ex
treme positions because of the radical fac
tions. Threats of secession from the PLO. the
formation of counter-Palestinian liberation
groups and even attempted assassinations are
all possibilities that the Fatah must keep in
mind when it makes policy. Hence, the radical
influence is actually quite large within the
PLO. Of course, this is not a stable situation,
and the amount of fighting within the PLO
limits its ability to attain its goals. Moreover,
many of the groups, frustrated by others'
demands, act unilaterally through terrorism.
This further destabilizes the group and pushes
it toward additional extremism. Hence, the
PLO does not truly represent a unified,
moderate group, as King implied, but rather a
variety of fanatical subgroups that are both
splitting the PLO apart and pushing It toward
further terrorism.
In addition, there are questions of corrup
tion within the PLO. There were reports last
June that the PLO had been secretly amassing
a fortune by sidetracking" money sent to it as
humanitarian aid and placing it In secret bank
accounts in Switzerland. Lebanon and Jor
dan: this is effectively doing the same thing
that drove Marcos and "Baby Doc" Duvalier
from their countries. This crisis further split
the PLO factions.
