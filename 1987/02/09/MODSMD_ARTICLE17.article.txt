EEs: We want
a house, too
How many students swarm to
ERL labs each day (how many
know where they are)? How many
people can recite the contribu
tions of Ampere, Maxwell,
Thevenln, Bode and Schottky to
mankind? How many people
know how to properly implement
precharged domino CMSOS
logic?
Today we live in a world that is
increasingly dependent upon
electronics. The need for an un
derstanding of basic concepts is
vital. An electrical engineering
(EE) house would cater to this
need.
EE is an excellent candidate for
a theme house since the field is
so broad. The house would be a
place where the focus is EE and
where people are intellectually
inspired and allowed to practice
their talents and Interests. It
would be especially appealing to a
non-major since it could provide
training and materials normally
unavailable to them. It would also
serve as the focal point for EE
activities on campus by sponsor
ing events such as lectures and
film series. An EE theme house
would enrich the whole commu
nity and add to the diversity of
Stanford Universtiy.
A house on the Row would be
most desirable, such as the Amer
ican Studies House or 558
Mayfield. However, if a Row loca
tion cannot be arranged, facilities
exist at Governor's Corner for an
EE theme house.
Wherever housed, space must
be made for an electronics lab,
which must be stocked with all of
the latest oscilloscopes and the
biggest proto-boards. Other ne
cessary equipment includes a
terminal and TIP in every room; a
Cray 2; chip fabrication facilities;
a satellite dish; and a library,
containing books and magazines
on all aspects of electrical engi
neering.
There would be a mandatory
one- to two-unit in-house semi
nar each quarter, as well as a
modest project (such as the
design and implementation of a
128 bit microprocessor). In addi
tion, the house would force EE
majors to be a little more well
rounded by requiring that all
residents take a least 10 units of

computer science sometime
during the year.
An EE theme house is as valid
and as valuable as any of the
other theme houses currently
vying for creation. Considering
the current and future impor
tance of electronics in the world,
an EE house is the only logical
choice for the next theme house
on campus.

Donation
was no gift
The *7.8 million "gift" from
SmithKline Beckman Corp.
(Daily, Feb. 4) to Stanford's Cen
ter for Molecular and Genetic
Medicine is a travesty of corporate
benevolence. In return for the
"gift," SmithKline will receive all
patent rights to products and
processes resulting from projects
it funds.
"Gift" Is defined simply as
"something given" â€” there is no
mention of anything being taken
back. Thus, SmithKline's dona
tion hardly qualifies as a "gift." It
is precisely this contingency that
endangers academic freedom by
defining research In terms of
potential profit as opposed to
healthy scientific curiosity.
This investment is extremely
unfortunate because SmithKline
is a strong financial supporter of
the Heritage Foundation, an
ultra-conservative think tank,
whose chair sits on the board of
SmithKline's trustees. Yet again
the University has created embar
rassing politically partisan ties of
dubious merit, no doubt to the
chagrin of socially conscious
students and faculty. The time
has come for the University Ad
ministration to consider conduct
ing its financial affairs with some
degree of social responsibility. Or
perhaps it would be enough to
abide by the caveat: Beware of
ultra-conservative corporations
bearing gifts.
