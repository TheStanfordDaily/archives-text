# Taking a gamble on Casino Night

The scene was perfectly Stan
ford — hundreds of carefree
college students gambling away
their money like members of
the Blyth Fund, then shuffling
to the dance floor to finish the
evening with Madonna.
With blackjack, roulette and
craps for the risk-loving, and
mingling, dancing and drink
ing for the risk-averse, the
ninth annual Senior Casino
Night, sponsored by the Stan
ford Alumni Association and
held Friday at the Hyatt Palo

Alto, provided something for
everyone. By all accounts, the
event was a stunning success.
"Everything was great." said
Senior Class President B.G.
Porter at the end of the even
ing. "1 just wish more people
could have come." The Alumni
Association sold only 400 pairs
of tickets to seniors because of
space considerations.
Students were each given
•25 in chips — not ex
changeable for real money, of
course — to gamble with. Ser
ving as blackjack dealers were
27 faculty and staff members.
