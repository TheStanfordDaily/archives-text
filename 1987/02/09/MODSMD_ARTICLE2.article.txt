# Taking a gamble on Casino Night
## 
### MARY K. McDEVITT CHARLIE GOFEN Senior staff writers 
The scene was perfectly Stan
ford — hundreds of carefree
college students gambling away
their money like members of
the Blyth Fund, then shuffling
to the dance floor to finish the
evening with Madonna.
With blackjack, roulette and
craps for the risk-loving, and
mingling, dancing and drink
ing for the risk-averse, the
ninth annual Senior Casino
Night, sponsored by the Stan
ford Alumni Association and
held Friday at the Hyatt Palo

Alto, provided something for
everyone. By all accounts, the
event was a stunning success.
"Everything was great." said
Senior Class President B.G.
Porter at the end of the even
ing. "1 just wish more people
could have come." The Alumni
Association sold only 400 pairs
of tickets to seniors because of
space considerations.
Students were each given
•25 in chips — not ex
changeable for real money, of
course — to gamble with. Ser
ving as blackjack dealers were
27 faculty and staff members.
among them Stanford Athletic Di
rector Andy Geiger, Vice President
for Development Henry Riggs, Bi
ology Prof. Robert Simoni and As
sistant to the President Bob
Hamrdla.
"I'm a frustrated gambler," said
Hamrdla. a veteran Casino Night
blackjack dealer. "I can't have the
same fun on this side of the table,
but I'm having a great time
dealing anyway. I like to do differ
ent stuff, a double or triple hand. I
like to surprise em."
Asked to compare blackjack
dealing with his administrative

position, Hamrdla said dealing
was "much more fun," but added.
"1 wouldn't want to do this for a
living, either."
Several students warned
against gambling at Geiger's
table, charging that he is a com
pulsive cheater.
Alumni association members
and professional dealers also ran
many of the tables. Dealer Jim Al
len of Casino Game Rentals said
he enjoyed working Stanford's
Casino Night more than working
Reno or Las Vegas. "The people
are looser," Allen said. "They're
not here to get upset about losing
money. It's just losing plastic."
But winning still meant a lot for
some of the student gamblers.
