Kampfe said he didn't count
cards to monitor when the odds
were in his favor, as some profes
sional gamblers do. but he did
write a computer program "which
simulated how the blackjack table
performs." In Computer Science
1068, Kampfe explained, he
learned when to hit and when to
double down.
"We're ecstatic," he said,
proudly displaying the <107 in

Couples representing all four
classes and at least one local high
school dressed in sports coats and

"The best part was winning at
craps and seeing freshmen dorm
friends." said senior Paul Endo.
Eileen Matsumi, a senior who
wore a black silk dress, said she
thought the evening had a special
air for senior reunions. "Getting
dressed up and seeing everyone is
fun," she said. "You usually see
them wearing T-shirts and jeans."
"It's kinda cool, seeing people
from freshmen dorms and doing a
more adult thing." added senior
Tracy Pannell.
The only complaint of the even

lins, who noted shortly after mid
night, "They closed the damn
place down too early. I'm driving
to Reno."
The gambling stopped around

ready to go home. Raffle prizes —

ceiling and carried them out,
while others tied helium balloons
to their wrists before they left.
The Stanford Alumni Associa

Lin helped organize this year's
event.
The Alumni Association,
working hard to forge ties with
soon-to-be alumni, is also spon
soring a senior weekend at the
Stanford Sierra Camp in April ansl
a luncheon for seniors and their
families the day before gradua
tion.

Bob Hamrdla, a veteran Casino Night blackjack dealer, said blackjack
dealing is "much more fun" than his position as administrative assis

for a living, either."
