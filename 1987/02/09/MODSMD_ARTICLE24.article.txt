# The 						Graduate: Stanford style
## 
### GILES GOODHEAD 
With major backing from a
Wall Street firm, a group of
Stanford students will produce
and direct a film that uses the
Stanford Graduate School of
Business (GSB) as its back
drop.
Merrill Lynch, a leading New
York investment banking firm,
recently agreed to provide a
grant of $26,000 to finance the
production. The film will be a
fictional story that depicts the
personal and career issues
faced by students in the GSB.
"It's a film about people and
about change," said Omar
Khan, the director of the proj
ect and a second-year student
at the business school.
"We follow the life of a woman
who goes to business school
after being an actress in New
York. For her, it's a new and
very different environment,
and in coming to terms with it.
she faces the important issues
of her career goals and personal
identity." Khan said. "Along
the way she gets Involved with
student activities, job inter
views, friendships and relation
ships."
A central theme of the film is
how student life in general —
and business school life in par
ticular — can change people by
forcing them to reassess their
goals and ambitions.
The film also seeks to dismiss
the stereotype of MBA students

as overaggressive and overac
hieving know-it-alls, according

to Khan.
"We will show people what
business schools are really
like," Khan said. "But we will
give a balanced perspective and
show that they (the students)
are interesting people."
Khan, who has considerable
television experience, has been
working on the script for nearly
a year with fellow student Doug
Textor, who once worked for

Columbia Pictures in Los An
geles.
Both said they are excited
about the movie because it is a
chance for many people to get
involved and learn exactly how
to make a high quality, profes
sional film. The grant from
Merrill Lynch will allow the
crew to use professional
camera equipment and editing
facilities.
Khan and Textor are also
looking for wide student in
volvement on both sides of the
camera. Evening auditions are
being held at the GSB tomor
row and Wednesday. Apart
from the lead role, there are
four major characters and
many smaller parts.
Shooting will take place over
spring break, and the or
ganizers hope to premiere the
film in May to coincide with the
Centennial Cornerstone
Weekend.
Co-producer Kevin Reidy ap
plauded the grant from Merrill
Lynch. As a heavy recruiter of
Stanford students, Merrill
Lynch certainly welcomes the
exposure they will get, Reidy
said. However, the firm is al
lowing him and the others in
volved in the project much
freedom, he said.
"It's still an independent
film. Only now we really have
something to live up to," Reidy
said.
So watch out for cameras on
campus over spring break and
expect the premiere of a film to
compliment "The Graduate" —
Stanford-style.
