## Basketball defeats USC 72-57 at home Lichti scores 21, Reveno grabs 10 boards as Stanford snaps 3 game losing streak 
### SUSAN SLUSSER Editorial staff 
Yesterday's matchup with the USC
Trojans was a must win for the Stanford
men's basketball team, and win Stan
ford did. trouncing the Trojans 72-57
before 4,133 at Maples Pavilion to
remain in seventh place in the Pacific 10
Conference with a 6-7 league record. 12-
10 overall.
USC dropped to 3-9 in the conference,
tied for eighth with Washington State,
and now has an 8-13 record.
Things were starting to look bleak for
the Cardinal following a 1-4 road trip
and a 93-62 loss to UCLA Thursday
night. Stanford's problems of late have
been twofold — shooting and rebound
ing. The Cardinal shot a combined .399
in the five games previous to the USC
contest, and had been outrebounded in
the last six straight games, including a
44-23 deficit against UCLA.
Stanford turned these important sta
tistics around against the Trojans,
however, shooting .511 from the field to
USC's .440 and collecting 29 boards to
27 for the Trojans. The Cardinal also col
lected 1 1 offensive rebounds — only two
less than the team totalled the last three
games.
"We did a much better job
(rebounding)." Stanford Coach Mike
Montgomery said. "No question. Guys
were competing on the boards, getting
in there, roughing it up."
"It's just a matter of being more ag
gressive." said Stanford forward Eric
Reveno, who pulled down a game-high
10 boards. "Different coaches say that
rebounding is 90 percent effort. . . .
Tonight was a concentrated effort be
cause rebounding was our Achilles'
heel."
A rebound actually got the Cardinal

rolling. Early on in the game, with the
score tied at 8. Todd Lichti electrified
the crowd and his teammates with a
soaring offensive rebound over several
Trojans. Center Howard Wright was
fouled underneath the basket shortly
after and hit both free throws, and
Novian Whitsitt followed with a 17-foot
jumper from the left side to put the
Cardinal up 12-8 with 13:04 left in the
half. Stanford would not relinquish the
lead again.

In fact, every time the Trojans threat
ened in the first half, the Cardinal
responded with a three-pointer, as Terry
Taylor hit one from the left side when
USC pulled within one at 17-16 to make
things 20-17, and then Lichti hit an
other when the Trojans trailed just 28-
25 late in the half. This last was most
important, as the Cardinal had not
scored a point in the previous 3:23. By
the end of the half. Stanford had upped
its lead to 35-25.
In the second half, the closet USC

could come was eight points. 55-47 on a
Derrick Dowell lay-in. despite a 3:14
Stanford scoring drought.
"You only get so many opportunities,"
USC Coach George Raveling said. "And
if you don't take advantage ol them, you
suffer your fate. We were very stagnant
— Stanford sat on an eight-point lead
for over three minutes. If someone
knocks on the door and offers you ad
vice, if you don't take it you have no one
to blame but yourself. We had the

before 4,133 at Maples Pavilion to
remain in seventh place in the Pacific 10
Conference with a 6-7 league record. 12-
10 overall.
USC dropped to 3-9 in the conference,
tied for eighth with Washington State,
and now has an 8-13 record.
Things were starting to look bleak for
the Cardinal following a 1-4 road trip
and a 93-62 loss to UCLA Thursday
night. Stanford's problems of late have
been twofold — shooting and rebound
ing. The Cardinal shot a combined .399
in the five games previous to the USC
contest, and had been outrebounded in
the last six straight games, including a
44-23 deficit against UCLA.
Stanford turned these important sta
tistics around against the Trojans,
however, shooting .511 from the field to
USC's .440 and collecting 29 boards to
27 for the Trojans. The Cardinal also col
lected 1 1 offensive rebounds — only two
less than the team totalled the last three
games.
"We did a much better job
(rebounding)." Stanford Coach Mike
Montgomery said. "No question. Guys
were competing on the boards, getting
in there, roughing it up."
"It's just a matter of being more ag
gressive." said Stanford forward Eric
Reveno, who pulled down a game-high
10 boards. "Different coaches say that
rebounding is 90 percent effort. . . .
Tonight was a concentrated effort be
cause rebounding was our Achilles'
heel."
A rebound actually got the Cardinal

rolling. Early on in the game, with the
score tied at 8. Todd Lichti electrified
the crowd and his teammates with a
soaring offensive rebound over several
Trojans. Center Howard Wright was
fouled underneath the basket shortly
after and hit both free throws, and
Novian Whitsitt followed with a 17-foot
jumper from the left side to put the
Cardinal up 12-8 with 13:04 left in the
half. Stanford would not relinquish the
lead again.

In fact, every time the Trojans threat
ened in the first half, the Cardinal
responded with a three-pointer, as Terry
Taylor hit one from the left side when
USC pulled within one at 17-16 to make
things 20-17, and then Lichti hit an
other when the Trojans trailed just 28-
25 late in the half. This last was most
important, as the Cardinal had not
scored a point in the previous 3:23. By
the end of the half. Stanford had upped
its lead to 35-25.
In the second half, the closet USC

could come was eight points. 55-47 on a
Derrick Dowell lay-in. despite a 3:14
Stanford scoring drought.
"You only get so many opportunities,"
USC Coach George Raveling said. "And
if you don't take advantage ol them, you
suffer your fate. We were very stagnant
— Stanford sat on an eight-point lead
for over three minutes. If someone
knocks on the door and offers you ad
vice, if you don't take it you have no one
to blame but yourself. We had the
