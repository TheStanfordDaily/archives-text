An eight-hour bus ride after an
afternoon baseball game can be
quite an ordeal, but Stanford
made its considerably easier yes
terday with an 11-1 victory at
Fullerton State.
The win was Stanford's second
of the three-game weekend series
and ran the Cardinal's record to 5-
2. while the Titans fell to 1-2. The
teams split the first two contests,
with Fullerton taking a 7-4 deci
sion Saturday night after the
Cardinal pulled out a wild 11-
inning affair. 6-5, the previous
evening.
Yesterday, with the Titans
leading 1-0 in the top of the fifth,
Fullerton starter Larry Casian
walked the bases loaded. Toi Cook
(3 for 5 on the day) then drove in
two runs with a single to left, and
when the Titan leftfielder
misplayed the ball, a third run
scored. Casian eventually gave
way to Gary Buckels. but by the
time Buckels was able to retire the
side, the Cardinal had a 6-1 lead.
The five-run advantage turned
out to be more than enough for

Stanford starter Steve Chitren.
The sophomore right-hander went
the distance for his second win of
the year, allowing eight hits, while
striking out eight and walking
none.
Saturday's game was supposed
to be an afternoon contest, but
was postponed until that evening
because of high winds. When
night fell, however. It was the
Titans who were doing the heavy
gusting, as they blew Stanford
away en route to their first win of
the season.
Led by leftfielder Greg Mannion,
who had two doubles and scored
four runs. Fullerton reached Stan
ford pitchers Lee Plemel and Rob
Wassenaar for 14 hits. The Titans
took a 7-0 lead after seven innings
until the Cardinal scorcd one in
the eighth and three in the ninth
(two on freshman shortstop Troy
Paulsen's first collegiate homer)
off starter Lonzo Garcia.
Friday's contest was by far the
weekend's most exciting, featur
ing two extra frames, some late
inning heroics and three bench
clearing altercations.
