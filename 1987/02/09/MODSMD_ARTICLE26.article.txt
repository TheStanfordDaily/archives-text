## 
### TOM SENF Editorial staff 
An eight-hour bus ride after an
afternoon baseball game can be
quite an ordeal, but Stanford
made its considerably easier yes
terday with an 11-1 victory at
Fullerton State.
The win was Stanford's second
of the three-game weekend series
and ran the Cardinal's record to 5-
2. while the Titans fell to 1-2. The
teams split the first two contests,
with Fullerton taking a 7-4 deci
sion Saturday night after the
Cardinal pulled out a wild 11-
inning affair. 6-5, the previous
evening.
Yesterday, with the Titans
leading 1-0 in the top of the fifth,
Fullerton starter Larry Casian
walked the bases loaded. Toi Cook
(3 for 5 on the day) then drove in
two runs with a single to left, and
when the Titan leftfielder
misplayed the ball, a third run
scored. Casian eventually gave
way to Gary Buckels. but by the
time Buckels was able to retire the
side, the Cardinal had a 6-1 lead.
The five-run advantage turned
out to be more than enough for

Stanford starter Steve Chitren.
The sophomore right-hander went
the distance for his second win of
the year, allowing eight hits, while
striking out eight and walking
none.
Saturday's game was supposed
to be an afternoon contest, but
was postponed until that evening
because of high winds. When
night fell, however. It was the
Titans who were doing the heavy
gusting, as they blew Stanford
away en route to their first win of
the season.
Led by leftfielder Greg Mannion,
who had two doubles and scored
four runs. Fullerton reached Stan
ford pitchers Lee Plemel and Rob
Wassenaar for 14 hits. The Titans
took a 7-0 lead after seven innings
until the Cardinal scorcd one in
the eighth and three in the ninth
(two on freshman shortstop Troy
Paulsen's first collegiate homer)
off starter Lonzo Garcia.
Friday's contest was by far the
weekend's most exciting, featur
ing two extra frames, some late
inning heroics and three bench
clearing altercations.

Stanford right fielder Toi Cook, here shown sliding under a tag by
Santa Clara shortstop Matt Toole, went 3 for 5 in the Cardinal's 11-1
victory over Fullerton State yesterday.
In the top of the third. Stanford
had Ruben Amaro at third and
Frank Carey at first. Carey took off
for second and Fullerton catcher
Mike Ham threw through, allow
ing Amaro to score.
After first baseman Mike
Cameron tagged out Carey in the
ensuing rundown, Carey took ex
ception to the force of the tag and
shoved Cameron. The benches
cleared, but no blows were struck.
Unfortunately for those who
wanted to see cooler heads prevail.
Cameron led off the following in
ning and was drilled in the foot by
Stanford starter Jim Price.
Cameron charged the mound (a
questionable move considering
that Price is 6-foot-5 and weighs
240 pounds) but was grabbed
from behind by catcher Ed
Spragne

The benches cleared again, and
this time some punches were
thrown, although no one was
ejected.
Fight number three came in the
bottom of the seventh. With Stan
ford leading 4-2, Fullerton had
Jim Osborn on second and Tony
Trevino on first. Reliever A 1 Osuna
trapped Osborn off second, but
Osborn escaped when shortstop
David Esquer hit him in the back
with a throw. On his way to third,
Osborn chose to go through
rather than around third
baseman Mark Machtolf. and the
two went after each other. Both
were ejected.
With the score tied at five in the
top of the 11th, Esquer walked
and stole second. As Brian
Johnson struck out. the ball got
away from Ham, allowing Esquer
to go to third. Amaro then hit a
chopper toward first, and new
first baseman Keith Kaub could
not make the play as Esquer raced
across with the winning run.
