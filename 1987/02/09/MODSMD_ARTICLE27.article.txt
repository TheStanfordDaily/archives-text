# Women's gymnastics beats Bears, Lobos

Records are meant to be broken,
and the Stanford women's gym
nasties team obliterated two in its
victory Friday night at the Card
inal Classic Invitational, setting
new individual and team vaulting
highs and defeating both Califor
nia and New Mexico.
Stanford's Cardinal team,
featuring the team's strongest
performers, won the meet with a
score of 181, followed closely by
New Mexico at 180.80. Cal, which
beat Stanford last weekend at the
California Invitational, garnered a
178.55, and Stanford's White
team took up the rear with a
160.30.
"I think we all pulled together so
much better this meet." said
freshman Karen Gryler, a member
of the White squad. "Having the
crowd behind us really helped. It
all clicked this meet."
"I think our team did a great job
as a team," senior Nanci
Goldsmith said. "Overall, for this
early in the season, we did a great
job."
Stanford Choreographer Nancy
Roach, a resident of Reno. Nev.,

and here for her first meet this
season, shared Goldsmith's senti
ments. "I think they did well for
this early in the season. They had
a few misses on floor, but that's
just the nature of this time of the
year," she said.
"I'm satisfied." Goldsmith
added. "(Stanford Coach) Homer
(Sardina) should be happy, and
I'm happy."
Sardina, however, was far from
ecstatic at the conclusion of the
meet. "I am disappointed with the
way we took the meet home," the
coach said. "We could have scored
a 185 here tonight. We've got to
learn to take meets home if we
want to become a national pro
gram.
"If the team is going to go any
further, [it has) to start disciplin
ing [itself] all the way through the
competition and into the locker
room, like a basketball team," he
added.
"It's easy to lose your focus in
the heat of the moment," Sardina
continued. "The girls were going
along well, but they didn't perform
well enough to bring the meet
home."
Those may seem hard words for
a man whose team has just won
the meet, but Sardina was not en
tirely displeased with the team's
performance. "I'm not down on
them as such." he said. "Some
things were good, and some
things were not as good. We
should address those things in
practice this week."
"We did better on bars this
week, but we could have done bet
ter on beam," junior Alison
McGann said. "That we broke a
record on vaulting shows that
we're improving."
The Cardinal team certainly
made the first rotation count, top
pling the former Stanford vaulting
record of 45.60 with its impres
sive finish of 46.75 on the appara
tus. In addition, freshman Dina
Amoroso captured the Stanford
Individual record with her mark of
9.65, besting the 9.60 teammate
Beth Pope earned in the 1985
Cardinal Classic.
