# Men's swimming downs SoCal rivals USC, UCLA
## 
### ERIK ESELIUS Senior staff writer 
Pacing up and down the pool deck with his stun
ning red sports jacket and dark sunglasses both set
neatly in order, Stanford Coach Skip Kenney was
truly in vintage form against rival USC.
He wasn't alone.
In what could be considered one of its finest dual
meet efforts ever, the Stanford men's swimming
team toppled the No. 4-rankcd USC Trojans 68-45
Saturday at deGuerre Pool.
"I'm really proud of this team." Kenney said.
"There was no phony or forced emotion. It was all
inside. This win really came from the heart."
The Cardinal started fast and set the tone early in
the meet's opening race, the 400-vard medley relay-
Paced by sophomore Jay Mortenson's explosive back
stroke lead-off. the quartet of Mortenson. Pablo
Morales. Byron Burson and Sam Schwartz led from
the beginning en route to a deGuerre Pool record and
national best time of 3:18.31. The Stanford B medley
relay team, which finished third, turned in the third
fastest time in the nation this season.
"We knew when we came here that we had to win
the relays." USC Coach Peter Daland said afterwards.
"The medley relay was the turnaround. Jay
(Mortenson) Just blew us out in that first 50."
From there, the Stanford freestyle sprinters and
distance corps took command. In the 1.000 freestyle.
Jeff Kostoff. who expected a push from the Trojan's
highly-regarded Dan Jorgenson. won in relatively
easy fashion. The showdown didn't exactly occur —
Jorgenson didn't participate.

Stragically shuffling his lineup for an anticipated
close dual meet. Daland opted to swim Jorgenson
only in the 200 and 500 freestyle to rest the fresh
man sensation sufficiently for the final 400 freestyle
relay.
Such a stratagem looked sound on paper, accord
ing to Kenney. The ink however, must have smeared
before freshman John Witchel read it.
A native of New York. Witchel grabbed the early
lead In the 200 freestyle and fought off Trojan
favorites Jorgenson and former Olympian Mike
O'Brien. Witehel's first-place clocking of 1:37.36 was
good enough to qualify him for the NCAAs and to
place him in the deGuerre Pool record archives.
After strong second- and third-place swims bv
Doug Lillydahl and John Hodge in the 50 freestyle.
Stanford's Pablo Morales, once called the soul of
American swimming by Sports Illustrated, came
through with a U.S. best of 1:49.10 in the 200 indi
vidual medley.
Morales followed that fine performance with a
second-place showing in the 200 butterfly behind
teammate Anthony Mossc, who continued the trend
of U.S bests with his own of 1:45.70, also a pool
record.
The Cardinal upped its lead to 57-22 when Juniors
Sean Murphy and Matt Nance finished one-two In
the 200 backstroke. Murphy, who has been a steady
and much overlooked swimmer throughout his
Stanford career, churned out vet another sub-NCAA
standard swim.
"We (the team) take his swims for granted.
Morales said. "Not many people appreciate his un
wavering excellence."
