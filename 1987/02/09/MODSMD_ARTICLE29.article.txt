# Women hoopsters drop two in LA
## 
### PABLO MORALES Staff writer 
The grueling schedule of the
inaugural Pacific 10 Confer
ence season may be at last
taking a toll on the Stanford
women's basketball team.
Saturday night in Los An
geles, the Cardinal, playing in
its fourth straight road game,
fell to the UCLA Bruins 64-48.
The loss, Stanford's fourth
against a conference opponent,
dropped the Cardinal to 5-6 in
the Pac-10.
"Unlike last year (in the
Pacific West Conference), we
have tough games day in and
day out," Stanford Coach Tara
VanDerveer said. "It's difficult
playing four road games in a
row, but we're in every game we
play."
As in the previous three
losses, Stanford kept pace early
in the contest, but faded
toward the end.
In the first half, an energetic
Stanford defense held a potent
Bruin offense, boasting prolific
scorers such as Jaime Brown
and Dora Dome, to just 25
points. But Stanford's offense,
drought-stricken as of late,
could only match that total.
The 25-25 halftime score was
the last time the Cardinal could
entertain hopes of snapping its
current skid, as its offense
remained stalled during the
second half.
The Bruin offense didn't do
much better, but thanks to the
offensive rebounding efforts of

freshman Sheri Bouldin and a
tiring Stanford defense, the
Bruins converted their second
opportunities. The Bruins out
rebounded the Cardinal by a
50-36 count.
"We come out for each game
playing very hard â€” especially
on defense," VanDerveer said.
"We're holding down their of
fenses, but our (lack of) offense
is putting too much pressure
on our defense. Our defense is
right up there so we just wish
some of our shots would fall."
Against the Bruins, some of
Stanford's attempts were suc
cessful, but 19-for-58 shooting
will not beat very many teams.
Junior Kami Anderson owned
eight of those baskets and
finished with a game-high 20
points.
Led by the intense play of
Stanford senior Erica Mueser,
the Cardinal defense held
Brown and Dome in check
throughout the night. Dome,
who scored 42 points Thursday
night against Berkeley, could
only manage 12 against Stan
ford. Brown, a Cardinal killer
in the past, shot a horrendous
four-of-17 from the field.
But according to VanDerveer.
such defensive performances
will be futile if the offense can
not score. "We still need a big
ger contribution from our
frontline players. We need them
to bang inside and take the ball
to the basket like other teams
do against us. We have to
relieve the pressure from our
defense."
