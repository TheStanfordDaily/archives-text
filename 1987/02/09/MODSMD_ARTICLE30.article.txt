# Women swimmers lose to UT
## 
### BRENDAN HEALEY Senior staff writer 
"Remember deGuerre Pool" may not be the most
famous rallying cry in Texas annals, but last year's
loss at Stanford may have provided the extra motiva
tion for the Longhorns' convincing 92-48 victory over
the Stanford women's swimming team Saturday.
Going into the meet. Stanford had looked to be on
a par with the Longhorns. or perhaps capable of up
setting the No. 1 team in the country. However,
Texas jumped all over the 400-yard medley relay,
missing the American record by .54 of a second, and
never looked back.
The Longhorns' Kim Rhodenbaugh admitted that
last year's 85-58 loss at Stanford "was in the back of
some people's minds," but said she was "really
surprised" at the way Texas steamrolled the Card
inal.
"I think right off the bat we won the relay, and 1
couldn't believe how fast people swam," added
Rhodenbaugh, who competed in the 1984 Olympics.
"1 think our adrenaline got going, and it just
wouldn't stop. We have this certain feeling on the
team, and once it's generated, you can't slow it down.
I can't explain it. It's not like we drink any magic po
tions or anything."
Some Stanford observers had a different explana
tion for Texas' remarkably good times. Rested swim
mers go much faster, and Cardinal freshman Mi
chelle Griglione said the Longhorns seemed surpris
ingly fresh in the meet's opening race.
Her coach felt the same way.
"When you're only six-tenths off the American
record. I had a sneaking suspicion that they must
have rested." Stanford Coach George Haines said.
"That was a big surprise. I didn't think we'd lose by
that much, but still we improved. I think they're
beatable. We just were not rested. We went with
weights twice hard this week."
Whatever the reason. Texas was overwhelming in
winning 10 of the 16 events and sweeping the top

three places in a trio of races. Such was the
Longhorns' dominance that their 400 freestyle B
relay team met the NCAA qualifying mark, and their
C quartet missed it by less than three-tenths of a
second.
It wasn't that the Cardinal swam poorly in seeing
its 30-meet win streak broken. Three national-best
times were posted by Stanford's Jenna Johnson and
Susan Rapp. Johnson posted the year's top marks in
the 100 butterfly (54.73) and the 200 freestyle
(1:47.55), while Rapp blazed home in the 200
breaststroke in 2:17.01. Stanford swimmers re
corded 26 personal season-best times and hit eight
more NCAA cuts.
Yet the meet was essentially over after two events,
as the Longhorns surged to a 15-1 lead in front of a
crowd of more than 1,000 in the Texas Swimming
Center. The Texans were aided in building that cus
hion when Stanford's Stacy Shupe false-started in
the meet's second race, the 1,000 freestyle.
"We lost the medley, plus we lost our best 1,000
person from the start, so that put us behind the
eight ball." Haines said. "They just got on us early.
That's the way it goes sometimes."
While the team race was virtually a foregone con
clusion at that point, the meet nonetheless produced
hard-fought individual events and proved to be one
of the fastest dual meets in history.
At least three NCAA cuts were hit in each event,
and in one. the 200 backstroke, all but one swimmer
hit the qualifying time. Texas' Betsy Mitchell, the
world record holder in the 200 backstroke, could
only manage second in that race, and less than two
seconds separated first and seventh places.
The Longhorns' depth was evidenced by the fact
that while three of their swimmers recorded
national-best times, none of the marks was set by
one of Texas' seven resident Olympians. Instead.
Kara McGrath. Patty Sabo and Tracey McFarlane
came to the fore in setting the standards in the 200
butterfly. 1.000 freestyle and 100 breaststroke,
respectively.
