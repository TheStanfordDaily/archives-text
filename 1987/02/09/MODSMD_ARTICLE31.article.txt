# Women's tennis crushes Irvine

### KEN STEVENS Editorial staff 
Several stars of the past were on hand Friday
at the Varsity Tennis Courts, but It was the
present Stanford women's tennis team that
put on a show as the top-ranked Cardinal
upped its record to 2-0 with an 8-1 defeat of
UC-Irvine.
Former standouts Kate Gompert. Linda
Gates and Marianne Werdel came out to watch
the Cardinal Friday, and what they saw was
another impressive performance by Patty Fen
dick. The defending NCAA singles champion
won the first nine games of her No. 1 singles
match with Irvine's Stephanie Rhorer en route
to a 6-0, 6-1 victory.
The senior from Sacramento has now won
30 straight collegiate singles matches. Fendlck
combined her powerful baseline game with im
proved net play to quickly put the Cardinal
ahead 1-0.
Stanford Coach Frank Brennan said that
Fendick's decision to remain at Stanford for
her senior year rather than turn professional
will pay dividends in the long run. She will be
able to use some of the easier matches this
season to experiment with different shots, he
said.
"It gives her an opportunity to work on
things," Brennan said, referring especially to
Fendick's net game. "In the pros, you don't
have an easy match."
Stanford freshman Valerie Wilson certainly
had an easy match Friday, rolling past the An
teaters' Debbie Strombeck, 6-2, 6-1, in the No.
5 singles to give the Cardinal a 2-0 lead.
Just moments later, Cari Hagey, who had
started slowly in the No. 4 singles match,
finished off Irvine's Dina Trenwith 6-2, 6-3,
and Stanford led 3-0.
Hagey missed the Cardinal's first dual match
of the season and was playing Friday with a
wrap on the muscle that she had pulled in her
left upper leg. After falling behind 2-1 in the
first set, Hagey won nine of the next 10 games
to secure the victory.
Sophomore Cindy Buchsbaum also

struggled early In her match with the An
teaters' Carol Northrup, but she too rallied for
a victory that gave Stanford a 4-0 lead.
Buchsbaum trailed 3-0 in the first set of the
No. 6 singles before taking 10 of the next 12
games on her way to a 6-3, 6-2 win.

Like Hagey. Stanford's Lisa Green won 6-2,
6-3, but Green's victory over Kathy Rose in the
No. 3 singles was more of a struggle. The fresh
man from San Jose was inconsistent, at times
