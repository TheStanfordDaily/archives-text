# Women's tennis crushes Irvine
## 
### KEN STEVENS Editorial staff 
Several stars of the past were on hand Friday
at the Varsity Tennis Courts, but It was the
present Stanford women's tennis team that
put on a show as the top-ranked Cardinal
upped its record to 2-0 with an 8-1 defeat of
UC-Irvine.
Former standouts Kate Gompert. Linda
Gates and Marianne Werdel came out to watch
the Cardinal Friday, and what they saw was
another impressive performance by Patty Fen
dick. The defending NCAA singles champion
won the first nine games of her No. 1 singles
match with Irvine's Stephanie Rhorer en route
to a 6-0, 6-1 victory.
The senior from Sacramento has now won
30 straight collegiate singles matches. Fendlck
combined her powerful baseline game with im
proved net play to quickly put the Cardinal
ahead 1-0.
Stanford Coach Frank Brennan said that
Fendick's decision to remain at Stanford for
her senior year rather than turn professional
will pay dividends in the long run. She will be
able to use some of the easier matches this
season to experiment with different shots, he
said.
"It gives her an opportunity to work on
things," Brennan said, referring especially to
Fendick's net game. "In the pros, you don't
have an easy match."
Stanford freshman Valerie Wilson certainly
had an easy match Friday, rolling past the An
teaters' Debbie Strombeck, 6-2, 6-1, in the No.
5 singles to give the Cardinal a 2-0 lead.
Just moments later, Cari Hagey, who had
started slowly in the No. 4 singles match,
finished off Irvine's Dina Trenwith 6-2, 6-3,
and Stanford led 3-0.
Hagey missed the Cardinal's first dual match
of the season and was playing Friday with a
wrap on the muscle that she had pulled in her
left upper leg. After falling behind 2-1 in the
first set, Hagey won nine of the next 10 games
to secure the victory.
Sophomore Cindy Buchsbaum also

struggled early In her match with the An
teaters' Carol Northrup, but she too rallied for
a victory that gave Stanford a 4-0 lead.
Buchsbaum trailed 3-0 in the first set of the
No. 6 singles before taking 10 of the next 12
games on her way to a 6-3, 6-2 win.

Like Hagey. Stanford's Lisa Green won 6-2,
6-3, but Green's victory over Kathy Rose in the
No. 3 singles was more of a struggle. The fresh
man from San Jose was inconsistent, at times

Freshman Cindy Buschbaum, playing at the No. 6 singles spot for Stanford last Friday
against UC-Irvine, won 6-3, 6-2, despite being down 3-0 in the first set
moving Rose around the court ef
fortlessly and in other instances
missing easy shots.
"She's that type of player; she
has trouble with her concentra
tion." said Brennan, indicating
that with time Green will improve
the mental aspect of her game.
"Hopefully she'll mature a little
bit."
Despite the inconsistency in her
game Friday, Green's effort was
good enough to clinch the team
victory for the Cardinal.
! While Green's performance was

a little off. junior Kay Tittle was
really struggling Friday in the No.
2 singles match. Tittle is normally
as consistent as any player from
the baseline, but against Irvine's
Uma Rao she had trouble prolong
ing rallies.
After losing the first set. Tittle
was able to fight for a 4-6, 6-4, 6-1
victory, but even as she was win
ning the second and third sets,
she was constantly frustrated
with her inability to keep the ball
in play.
"Kay didn't have a great day, but
she managed to pull it out," Bren
nan said. "It was just one of those
days. You don't feel strong, you
don't feel quick. The good players

win on those days."
Brennan said that moving up to
the No. 2 singles position had no
effect on Tittle's game. He also
added that even without Leigh
Anne Eldredge and Eleni Rossides
(who are out with stress
fractures), the Cardinal would
have no trouble filling the No. 2
spot all season.
"I think whoever we have there
will do well," Brennan said.
"That's one of the toughest calls —
who's going to play two. three and
four. They (Tittle, Green and
senior Stephanie Savides) are
pretty much interchangeable."
The Stanford rout continued
over Irvine in the No. 3 doubles

match as Hagey and Wilson, the
tall and short of Stanford tennis,
combined to crush Strombeck
and Northrup 6-0, 6-3.
The Cardinal's only setback of
the day came in the No. 1 doubles
match, where Rhorer and Tren
with surprised Tittle and Green 6-
3. 6-0. Fendick and Savldes are
normally Stanford's top doubles
team, but with Savides playing in
an indoor tournament in Rich
mond. Va., Brennan decided to
move Tittle and Green up in the
lineup.
Fendick and Buchsbaum com
pleted the match with a 6-4, 6-1
sweep of Rao and Rose in the No. 2
doubles.

"That's one of the toughest calls —
who's going to play two. three and
four. They (Tittle, Green and
senior Stephanie Savides) are
pretty much interchangeable."
The Stanford rout continued
over Irvine in the No. 3 doubles

match as Hagey and Wilson, the
tall and short of Stanford tennis,
combined to crush Strombeck
and Northrup 6-0, 6-3.
The Cardinal's only setback of
the day came in the No. 1 doubles
match, where Rhorer and Tren
with surprised Tittle and Green 6-
3. 6-0. Fendick and Savldes are
normally Stanford's top doubles
team, but with Savides playing in
an indoor tournament in Rich
mond. Va., Brennan decided to
move Tittle and Green up in the
lineup.
Fendick and Buchsbaum com
pleted the match with a 6-4, 6-1
sweep of Rao and Rose in the No. 2
doubles.
Several stars of the past were on hand Friday
at the Varsity Tennis Courts, but It was the
present Stanford women's tennis team that
put on a show as the top-ranked Cardinal
upped its record to 2-0 with an 8-1 defeat of
UC-Irvine.
Former standouts Kate Gompert. Linda
Gates and Marianne Werdel came out to watch
the Cardinal Friday, and what they saw was
another impressive performance by Patty Fen
dick. The defending NCAA singles champion
won the first nine games of her No. 1 singles
match with Irvine's Stephanie Rhorer en route
to a 6-0, 6-1 victory.
The senior from Sacramento has now won
30 straight collegiate singles matches. Fendlck
combined her powerful baseline game with im
proved net play to quickly put the Cardinal
ahead 1-0.
Stanford Coach Frank Brennan said that
Fendick's decision to remain at Stanford for
her senior year rather than turn professional
will pay dividends in the long run. She will be
able to use some of the easier matches this
season to experiment with different shots, he
said.
"It gives her an opportunity to work on
things," Brennan said, referring especially to
Fendick's net game. "In the pros, you don't
have an easy match."
Stanford freshman Valerie Wilson certainly
had an easy match Friday, rolling past the An
teaters' Debbie Strombeck, 6-2, 6-1, in the No.
5 singles to give the Cardinal a 2-0 lead.
Just moments later, Cari Hagey, who had
started slowly in the No. 4 singles match,
finished off Irvine's Dina Trenwith 6-2, 6-3,
and Stanford led 3-0.
Hagey missed the Cardinal's first dual match
of the season and was playing Friday with a
wrap on the muscle that she had pulled in her
left upper leg. After falling behind 2-1 in the
first set, Hagey won nine of the next 10 games
to secure the victory.
Sophomore Cindy Buchsbaum also

struggled early In her match with the An
teaters' Carol Northrup, but she too rallied for
a victory that gave Stanford a 4-0 lead.
Buchsbaum trailed 3-0 in the first set of the
No. 6 singles before taking 10 of the next 12
games on her way to a 6-3, 6-2 win.

Like Hagey. Stanford's Lisa Green won 6-2,
6-3, but Green's victory over Kathy Rose in the
No. 3 singles was more of a struggle. The fresh
man from San Jose was inconsistent, at times


Barry Saik/Dally
Freshman Cindy Buschbaum, playing at the No. 6 singles spot for Stanford last Friday
against UC-Irvine, won 6-3, 6-2, despite being down 3-0 in the first set
moving Rose around the court ef
fortlessly and in other instances
missing easy shots.
"She's that type of player; she
has trouble with her concentra
tion." said Brennan, indicating
that with time Green will improve
the mental aspect of her game.
"Hopefully she'll mature a little
bit."
Despite the inconsistency in her
game Friday, Green's effort was
good enough to clinch the team
victory for the Cardinal.
! While Green's performance was

a little off. junior Kay Tittle was
really struggling Friday in the No.
2 singles match. Tittle is normally
as consistent as any player from
the baseline, but against Irvine's
Uma Rao she had trouble prolong
ing rallies.
After losing the first set. Tittle
was able to fight for a 4-6, 6-4, 6-1
victory, but even as she was win
ning the second and third sets,
she was constantly frustrated
with her inability to keep the ball
in play.
"Kay didn't have a great day, but
she managed to pull it out," Bren
nan said. "It was just one of those
days. You don't feel strong, you
don't feel quick. The good players

win on those days."
Brennan said that moving up to
the No. 2 singles position had no
effect on Tittle's game. He also
added that even without Leigh
Anne Eldredge and Eleni Rossides
(who are out with stress
fractures), the Cardinal would
have no trouble filling the No. 2
spot all season.
"I think whoever we have there
will do well," Brennan said.
"That's one of the toughest calls —
who's going to play two. three and
four. They (Tittle, Green and
senior Stephanie Savides) are
pretty much interchangeable."
