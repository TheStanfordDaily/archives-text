# Gymnasts last at UCLA tourney
## 
### MARK SMOYER Staff writer 
It seems that a few of the na
tion's top men's gymnastics pro
grams are confused about ex
actly what point this season has
reached.
Last night, at the UCLA Invita
tional, the host team scored an
extraordinary 282.40 to easily
defeat its competition. Not that
the competition was bad — most
teams recorded scores that do
not deserve to be easily defeated

so early in the season. Although
some teams may have been dis
appointed with their placing,
their performances, aside from
comparison with that of the
Bruins, must have been satisfy
ing.
Stanford, which recorded a
very respectable 271.95,
finished sixth, about three
points behind a three-team pack
of Arizona State, New Mexico
and Minnesota. Two points
ahead of the Sun Devils was Illi
nois at 278.50. The Cardinal's

team total last night was over
eight points better than its pre
vious 1987 best.
Individually, Stanford did not
place any gymnasts among the
top five all-around performers.
Only Mike Matzek's 9.50 vault
placed among any single events
top three performances, coming
in at second. 1984 Mexican
Olympian Tony Pineda led the
way for the Bruins with a stag
gering 57.90, over a point ahead
of Gopher Collin Godkin's
second place performance.
