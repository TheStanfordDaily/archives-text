# Men's tennis defeats Rollins; Tarango winner in tiebreaker
## 
### JON WEISMAN Staff writer 
There was a noticeable differ
ence between the Stanford's men's
and women's tennis teams as the
shadows fell across the Varsity
Tennis Courts Friday afternoon.
The difference was that the
women were no longer there.
Long after the Stanford women
had finished their 8-1 romp over
UC-Irvine, the men were still tan
gling with Rollins College. And
though the 6-3 win over Rollins
raised the sixth-ranked Cardinal's
record to 2-1, it was something
less than satisfying not to have
romped over a Division II school —
albeit a fourth-ranked one.
"This team (Rollins) is not a bad
team," Stanford Coach Dick
Gould said, "but it's not a UCLA or
a Pepperdine or a USC either.
"We need a win; we'll take the
win," Gould said. "But you have to
keep it in perspective. We've got to
get a lot better."
At first, it seemed the men were
going to keep pace with the
women (in a rarity, both matches
were played simultaneously).
Freshman Barry Richards got the
men off to a quick start, defeating
Rollins' Scott Speilberger, 6-2, 6-
1, for his third straight win.
"I started out pretty quick," Ric
hards said, "and he was just kind
of a steady player, and he let me
kind of play my game, let me get
my shots. So I just waited around
for my shots, came into the net,
hit some good volleys."
Next it was sophomore Curtis
Dunn, playing in his first varsity
singles match for Stanford. Dunn
showed no signs of nervousness
in beating Barry Pelts, 6-1, 6-4.
"We had been practicing really
hard," Dunn said, "so I didn't
really think about it as a first
match."
Jeff Cathrall and Scott Moody
were next to color the winner's
board cardinal. Cathrall defeated
Pat Johnson, 6-3, 7-5, while
Moody came from down 5-4 in the
first set to knock off Don Martin,
7-5, 6-2.
With Stanford one match away
from the win, Cardinal freshman
Jeff Tarango, playing No. 1 for the
first time in place of Patrick
McEnroe (who sat out after reag
gravating a foot injury in the Rolex
National Intercollegiate Tennis
Championships), was going down
to the wire against Rollins' Pat
Emmet, the second-ranked player
in Division 11.

The momentum swayed back
and forth during the match,
prompting Stanford's Andy Sands
to say in the third set, "If Jeff pulls
this one out it will truly be a
miracle."
Tarango himself exclaimed after
one point, "I need a psychologist
after that."
Leading 5-4, Tarango fell be
hind 6-5 to Emmet but then broke
Emmet's serve and sent the match
into a tiebreaker with two tough
backhand shots that Emmet was
unable to return.
Tarango looked like the loser as
the tiebreaker began, flying out on
the first point and later getting
caught flat-footed on another that
caused him to fall behind 5-1.
However, Tarango came alive
when he needed to, continually
crossing Emmet with shots to

both sides of the court to capture
six straight points, the match and
the victory for Stanford, 3-6, 6-2,
7-6 (7-5).
"I didn't have a very good day,"
Tarango said. "I was a little tired,
and I thought he was playing
really well. He has a really big
serve, and the serve was kind of
streaky, so when he hit the serves
really big it was hard for me to get
in.
"In the end he was hitting big
serves in the breaker," Tarango
said, "but I just came through. I
wasn't moving in on his serve. . . .
Sometimes when it's a big serve
you think to move back, and I
should have been moving for
ward."
That was as good as it got for
the Cardinal, however. Geordie
McKee lost a third-set lead over

Rollins' Robert Green and fell, 2-6,
6-4. 7-5.
Then, In doubles, Cathrall and
Tarango were blown away by Em
met and Johnson, 6-2, 6-3, and
McKee and Moody lost to Green
and Pelts, 6-4, 6-4. Even the 6-4,
6-7, 6-2 win by Stanford's Eric
Peus and Richards, an hour after
the women had finished with
Irvine, did not please Gould much.
"In doubles, frankly, we were
atrocious — in all three doubles."
Gould said. "In third doubles
(Peus and Richards) we had some
streaks, but we played very poorly
in doubles. Obviously, we have to
work a lot."
The Cardinal will have do that
work in a short time as the team
plays its first away match of the
year tomorrow at San Jose State.

and Pelts, 6-4, 6-4. Even the 6-4,
6-7, 6-2 win by Stanford's Eric
Peus and Richards, an hour after
the women had finished with
Irvine, did not please Gould much.
"In doubles, frankly, we were
atrocious — in all three doubles."
Gould said. "In third doubles
(Peus and Richards) we had some
streaks, but we played very poorly
in doubles. Obviously, we have to
work a lot."
The Cardinal will have do that
work in a short time as the team
plays its first away match of the
year tomorrow at San Jose State.

Geordie McKee did not have an enjoyable afternoon against Rollins College, despit a 6-3 Stanford win.
McKee lost in three sets. 2-6, 6-4, 7-5, to Robert Greer, and then lost in doubles with partner Scott Moody
to Green and Barry Pelts.
There was a noticeable differ
ence between the Stanford's men's
and women's tennis teams as the
shadows fell across the Varsity
Tennis Courts Friday afternoon.
The difference was that the
women were no longer there.
Long after the Stanford women
had finished their 8-1 romp over
UC-Irvine, the men were still tan
gling with Rollins College. And
though the 6-3 win over Rollins
raised the sixth-ranked Cardinal's
record to 2-1, it was something
less than satisfying not to have
romped over a Division II school —
albeit a fourth-ranked one.
"This team (Rollins) is not a bad
team," Stanford Coach Dick
Gould said, "but it's not a UCLA or
a Pepperdine or a USC either.
"We need a win; we'll take the
win," Gould said. "But you have to
keep it in perspective. We've got to
get a lot better."
At first, it seemed the men were
going to keep pace with the
women (in a rarity, both matches
were played simultaneously).
Freshman Barry Richards got the
men off to a quick start, defeating
Rollins' Scott Speilberger, 6-2, 6-
1, for his third straight win.
"I started out pretty quick," Ric
hards said, "and he was just kind
of a steady player, and he let me
kind of play my game, let me get
my shots. So I just waited around
for my shots, came into the net,
hit some good volleys."
Next it was sophomore Curtis
Dunn, playing in his first varsity
singles match for Stanford. Dunn
showed no signs of nervousness
in beating Barry Pelts, 6-1, 6-4.
"We had been practicing really
hard," Dunn said, "so I didn't
really think about it as a first
match."
Jeff Cathrall and Scott Moody
were next to color the winner's
board cardinal. Cathrall defeated
Pat Johnson, 6-3, 7-5, while
Moody came from down 5-4 in the
first set to knock off Don Martin,
7-5, 6-2.
With Stanford one match away
from the win, Cardinal freshman
Jeff Tarango, playing No. 1 for the
first time in place of Patrick
McEnroe (who sat out after reag
gravating a foot injury in the Rolex
National Intercollegiate Tennis
Championships), was going down
to the wire against Rollins' Pat
Emmet, the second-ranked player
in Division 11.

The momentum swayed back
and forth during the match,
prompting Stanford's Andy Sands
to say in the third set, "If Jeff pulls
this one out it will truly be a
miracle."
Tarango himself exclaimed after
one point, "I need a psychologist
after that."
Leading 5-4, Tarango fell be
hind 6-5 to Emmet but then broke
Emmet's serve and sent the match
into a tiebreaker with two tough
backhand shots that Emmet was
unable to return.
Tarango looked like the loser as
the tiebreaker began, flying out on
the first point and later getting
caught flat-footed on another that
caused him to fall behind 5-1.
However, Tarango came alive
when he needed to, continually
crossing Emmet with shots to

both sides of the court to capture
six straight points, the match and
the victory for Stanford, 3-6, 6-2,
7-6 (7-5).
"I didn't have a very good day,"
Tarango said. "I was a little tired,
and I thought he was playing
really well. He has a really big
serve, and the serve was kind of
streaky, so when he hit the serves
really big it was hard for me to get
in.
"In the end he was hitting big
serves in the breaker," Tarango
said, "but I just came through. I
wasn't moving in on his serve. . . .
Sometimes when it's a big serve
you think to move back, and I
should have been moving for
ward."
That was as good as it got for
the Cardinal, however. Geordie
McKee lost a third-set lead over

Rollins' Robert Green and fell, 2-6,
6-4. 7-5.
Then, In doubles, Cathrall and
Tarango were blown away by Em
met and Johnson, 6-2, 6-3, and
McKee and Moody lost to Green
and Pelts, 6-4, 6-4. Even the 6-4,
6-7, 6-2 win by Stanford's Eric
Peus and Richards, an hour after
the women had finished with
Irvine, did not please Gould much.
"In doubles, frankly, we were
atrocious — in all three doubles."
Gould said. "In third doubles
(Peus and Richards) we had some
streaks, but we played very poorly
in doubles. Obviously, we have to
work a lot."
The Cardinal will have do that
