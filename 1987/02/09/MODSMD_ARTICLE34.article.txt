### ERIK STEN Editorial staff 
A shot of confidence, a chance to rest and
three NCAA qualifiers were the Cardinal's
rewards this weekend in Louisiana.
Competing in Saturday's Louisiana State
Indoor at Baton Rouge, the Stanford track
and field team opened its 1987 season on a
resounding note. Looking ahead at the
meet, expectations had been cautious, as
Coach Brooks Johnson wasn't sure exactly
how ready his athletes would be to compete.
But by the time it was all over, the coach's
words weren't quite so reserved. "A lot of
things we thought could happen, did hap
pen. A lot of potential became a reality.
"We're pretty excited," Johnson said.
Generating much of the excitement were
three Cardinal women: Pam Dukes, Patty
Purpur and Peggy Odita, all of whom
qualified for the NCAA Indoor Champion
ships. Odita qualified in the high jump
with a leap of 5-feet-l 1 and 1/4 inches and
Purpur and Dukes both bettered the stan
dard in the shot put with throws of 51-11

and 56-8, respectively.
For Purpur and Dukes, both returning
All-America selections, the meet became
just the confidence booster they needed.
After struggling for two weeks, Purpur with
a lack of confidence in her throwing and
Dukes with a new rule that outlaws her
practice of taping her hands when compet
ing, the two were looking for a
breakthrough.
A breakthrough they got. "It feels like a
turning point," Dukes said. It gave us a lot
of confidence in our ability."
In the high jump competition. Odita
dropped out as soon as she cleared the na
tional standard. A nagging cist in her tibia
had slowed the freshman since the start of
the year. But now that she is certain of a
spot at nationals, Odita is free to take a
couple of weeks off for the surgery she
needs.
"The doctor had told me. If you can han
dle the pain, you can go (to Louisiana),' "
Odita said. "I decided to go and just shoot
for the standard." Now that she made it,
Odita can rest.
