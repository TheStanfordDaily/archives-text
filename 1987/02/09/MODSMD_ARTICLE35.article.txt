# Roadrunners run over Card wrestling team
## 
### FAITH PERRY Staff writer 
If you turned on your television set Saturday morn
ing, you could probably have seen hard-working Wile
E. Coyote attempting fruitlessly to conquer the
speedy Roadrunner.
If you came to Maples Pavilion Saturday night, you
could have watched a similar scenario, as the Cal
State-Bakersfield Roadrunners completely dom
inated the Cardinal by a score of 41-6.
Stanford forfeited in the 118-pound division, and
lost at 126, 134 and 142 pounds as well.
Team co-captain Scott Wiggen (150 pounds) gave
the Cardinal its first three points with a convincing
7-0 win over Roadrunner Doug Holley.
Freshman Steve Yarbrough gave Stanford its next
three points with a 6-2 victory over Bakersfield's Paul
Olejnik. Yarbrough and Olejnik wrestled each other
twice last weekend at the All-Cal tournament held in
San Francisco. In their first match, the two were so
close after overtime that the judge had to use the
seventh criterion (out of eight) to determine the win
ner. The judge decided that Yarbrough had 20
seconds more riding time than Olejnik, and
Yarbrough was given the victory.Yarbrough also won
the second tournamemt match, 7-4.
"I knew the coach was counting on me to win the
match tonight." Yarbrough said after beating Olejnik
Saturday. "The other matches I had against Olejnik
were really close, but now that I'm 3-0 against him,
I've proven to myself that I'm a better wrestler than
he is."
Although Yarbrough was the last wrestler to score
for Stanford, junior Eric Harber (167 pounds) came
extremely close. Harber and Roadrunner Mike Mon

tonye were tied 5-5 at the end of the final period.
However, the judge awarded Montonye one point for
20 seconds of riding time, and the Roadrunner was
given the victory.
Stanford freshman Ron Perry (177 pounds)
couldn't have faced a tougher opponent. Perry went
against Bakersfield's Darell Pope. Pope won his
weight class in the All-Cal tournament, was voted the
tournament's "outstanding wrestler," and was
recently ranked first in the country at 177 by
Amateur Wrestling News.

According to Perry, "The match was like coming in
as a freshman in high school, and wrestling a state
champion." Perry lost by technical fall after the third
period, 17-2.
In the heavyweight division. Cardinal co-captain
Kurt Kassulke faced All-Cal winner Mike Monroe.
Kassulke, who placed third in the All-Cal, had never
wrestled against Monroe and lost to the Roadrunner
by technical fall in the first period.
"Monroe set the tempo, and Kassulke never
regained composure," Horpel said. "Monroe was a lot
bigger than Kassulke, and I think the size factor had
a lot to do with it. Usually, Kurt can go against a big
guy because he's so strong. Bigger guys are usually
slow, and Kurt can move like a madman. But Monroe
moves quickly too. He's wrestles like a big Kurt Kas
sulke."
