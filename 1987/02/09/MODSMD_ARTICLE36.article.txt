## 
### ALICIA KENT Staff writer 
The trek down south was an encouraging trip for
the Stanford men's volleyball team, as the spikers
were able to beat the No. 3 team in the nation. Pep
perdine, in two straight games. 15-6, 15-6, Saturday
night at UCLA's Pauley Pavilion.
On Friday, the first night of the UCLA/Reebok Col
legiate Volleyball Classic. Stanford lost 15-8. 15-11,
15-4, to UCLA in a one-hour-and-45-minute match.
USC, ranked No. 4, convincingly beat Pepperdine 3-
0, as Pepperdine did not play as well as expected, ac
cording to Stanford Coach Fred Sturm.
In Saturday night's consolation round, the Card
inal redeemed itself by forcing a strong victory on
Pepperdine, and Stanford's loss to UCLA was put in
perspective when the No. 2 ranked Bruins won the
tournament easily by beating USC in the champion
ship match.
Entering the Classic, Stanford was in the awkward
position of being up against the nation's top teams.
The loss to UCLA was not a surprise for the Cardinal.
"They out-served us and out-passed us," Sturm said.
Although Stanford was siding-out well, making
UCLA's victory hard-earned, the Cardinal could not
seem to score any points when it was serving and lost
long strings of points.
Friday night's starting lineup took over Saturday
night in one of the Cardinal's most consistent
matches this season. "It was clearly one of our best
performances of the year. We served much more ef
fectively and were able to do everything pretty well,"
Sturm said.
The difference in Saturday's match was Stanford's
team unity. "We played really smoothly. We played
well as a team," outside hitter Fortune said. Accord
ing to Fortune, the team sided-out well offensively
and blocked well defensively.
Blue, an outside hitter, was named one of the six
all-tournament players because of his outstanding
play for both matches. "Blue had a great tourna
ment. He played his best volleyball of all year," Sturm
said.
With each match the spikers play, the improve
ment becomes more evident. "The group gets better
and better each match. We just have to keep it
going," Sturm said.
