# Few fail out of Farm football
## Stanford graduation rate among the highest in nation 
### CLAY CALVERT Staff writer 
Last December, during the an
nual college football bowl
bonanza, the lives of student
athletes across the country were
thrust into the media spotlight.
Sparked by the implementation of
the NCAA's new drug-testing
policy and the controversy sur
rounding the use of anabolic
steroids, a media barrage of
student-athlete profiles bom
barded the networks' pregame
and halftime shows.
Amid this air of things gone
wrong in the world of college ath
letics and the feeling that college
football players were no more than
hired hands employed by univer
sities in the name of higher educa
tion, some colleges attempted to
raise themselves from the muck
by purporting high graduation
rates for their football players.
When Penn State squared off
against the University of Miami
for the national championship, an
almost pious attitude was taken
with respect to the academic
achievements of Penn State
players. It seemed Penn State was
the last bastion of higher educa
tion in which the athlete was a
student first and a competitor on
the field second.
Penn State's graduation rates
for recruited football players,
however, are no higher than that
of a number of schools, including
Stanford, Notre Dame and Duke
University, according to informa
tion made available from all four
universities.
UC-Berkeley's graduation rate
for recruited football players is sig
nificantly lower than those of
Stanford and Duke when all three

institutions are compared using
an NCAA graduation formula.
While it seems clear that
graduation rates alone are not a
sufficient indicator of the quality
of student-athletes' work or of the
intellectual caliber of the institu
tion and the fields in which stu
dents major, the NCAA places
enough stock in graduation rates
to require all Division I institi
tions to file an annual report of
recruited athletes, according to
Ursula Walsh, director of research
and sports science for the NCAA in
Mission. Kan.

The NCAA's graduation formula
is based on a five-year period, or
the time a student-athlete would
have at an institution while eligi
ble to compete, allowing for one
red-shirted year. In reports filed
last fall with the NCAA, univer
sities were requested to look at all
recruited student-athletes who
matriculated as freshmen in the
1980-81 school year and to deter

mine their graduation status as of
Aug. 31, 1985.
The NCAA's formula, however,
is not as simple as it sounds. It ex
cludes from a university's figures
all student-athletes who left "in
good standing" from the institu
tion. Also, junior college transfers
are not counted in the data. Walsh
said.
While the NCAA's full report will
not be available until Feb. 23 and
the only past data the NCAA has is
from a 1981 report that combined
statistics from Division I, II and 111
institutions, several universities
were willing to disclose gradua
tion rates for recruited football
players. Some universities pro
vided information using the
NCAA's formula, while others pro
vided their own figures and data
spanning a number of years.
Stanford's five-year graduation
rate for recruited football players
using the NCAA's formula is 95.2
percent, according to University
Registrar Sally Mahoney. The
same formula gives all student
athletes for that period a 91.4 per
cent figure, while the number for
all students is 92.4 percent.
Using the University's own
graduation statistics, which in
clude any student-athlete who left
the University for any reason, 93.5
percent of all scholarship football
players who entered between 1976
and 1983 have either graduated or
are still enrolled here, according to
Law Prof. Jack Friedenthal. the
University's faculty-athletic repre
sentative to the Pacific 10 and the
NCAA.
"Our figures are for every kid
who walks through that door."
Friedenthal said, noting that
