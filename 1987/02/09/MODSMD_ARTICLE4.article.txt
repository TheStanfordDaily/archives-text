# Few fail out of Farm football
## Stanford graduation rate among the highest in nation 
### CLAY CALVERT Staff writer 
Last December, during the an
nual college football bowl
bonanza, the lives of student
athletes across the country were
thrust into the media spotlight.
Sparked by the implementation of
the NCAA's new drug-testing
policy and the controversy sur
rounding the use of anabolic
steroids, a media barrage of
student-athlete profiles bom
barded the networks' pregame
and halftime shows.
Amid this air of things gone
wrong in the world of college ath
letics and the feeling that college
football players were no more than
hired hands employed by univer
sities in the name of higher educa
tion, some colleges attempted to
raise themselves from the muck
by purporting high graduation
rates for their football players.
When Penn State squared off
against the University of Miami
for the national championship, an
almost pious attitude was taken
with respect to the academic
achievements of Penn State
players. It seemed Penn State was
the last bastion of higher educa
tion in which the athlete was a
student first and a competitor on
the field second.
Penn State's graduation rates
for recruited football players,
however, are no higher than that
of a number of schools, including
Stanford, Notre Dame and Duke
University, according to informa
tion made available from all four
universities.
UC-Berkeley's graduation rate
for recruited football players is sig
nificantly lower than those of
Stanford and Duke when all three

institutions are compared using
an NCAA graduation formula.
While it seems clear that
graduation rates alone are not a
sufficient indicator of the quality
of student-athletes' work or of the
intellectual caliber of the institu
tion and the fields in which stu
dents major, the NCAA places
enough stock in graduation rates
to require all Division I institi
tions to file an annual report of
recruited athletes, according to
Ursula Walsh, director of research
and sports science for the NCAA in
Mission. Kan.

The NCAA's graduation formula
is based on a five-year period, or
the time a student-athlete would
have at an institution while eligi
ble to compete, allowing for one
red-shirted year. In reports filed
last fall with the NCAA, univer
sities were requested to look at all
recruited student-athletes who
matriculated as freshmen in the
1980-81 school year and to deter

mine their graduation status as of
Aug. 31, 1985.
The NCAA's formula, however,
is not as simple as it sounds. It ex
cludes from a university's figures
all student-athletes who left "in
good standing" from the institu
tion. Also, junior college transfers
are not counted in the data. Walsh
said.
While the NCAA's full report will
not be available until Feb. 23 and
the only past data the NCAA has is
from a 1981 report that combined
statistics from Division I, II and 111
institutions, several universities
were willing to disclose gradua
tion rates for recruited football
players. Some universities pro
vided information using the
NCAA's formula, while others pro
vided their own figures and data
spanning a number of years.
Stanford's five-year graduation
rate for recruited football players
using the NCAA's formula is 95.2
percent, according to University
Registrar Sally Mahoney. The
same formula gives all student
athletes for that period a 91.4 per
cent figure, while the number for
all students is 92.4 percent.
Using the University's own
graduation statistics, which in
clude any student-athlete who left
the University for any reason, 93.5
percent of all scholarship football
players who entered between 1976
and 1983 have either graduated or
are still enrolled here, according to
Law Prof. Jack Friedenthal. the
University's faculty-athletic repre
sentative to the Pacific 10 and the
NCAA.
"Our figures are for every kid
who walks through that door."
Friedenthal said, noting that

some universities do not include
transfers in their statistics.
From 1976 to 1983, 144 of 154
scholarship football players who
entered Stanford graduated or are
still enrolled, Friedenthal said,
calling those statistics "stunning
figures."
Penn State, which would not
release the graduation rate it filed
with the NCAA, has an 86 percent
graduation rate for its football
players over the past 30 years, ac
cording to Pete Kowalskl of Penn
State's S.I.D. That figure Includes
all those who entered Penn State
and graduated at some time from
the university, he said.
While Friedenthal praised Penn
State's commitment to academics,
he noted that one must also con
sider the types of majors student
athletes pursue at such univer
sities.
During the Fiesta Bowl, majors
including parks and recreation
and administration of justice
flashed below the names of several
Penn State football players.
Penn State also has mandatory
study halls four nights per week
for all freshmen football players.
Kowalskl said. While Stanford has
no such mandatory study periods,
other universities, including

Duke and Oklahoma, have some
form of mandatory study sessions
for their freshmen football
players, according to officials at
those schools.
At Duke, 89 percent of all
recruited football players who en
tered in 1980-81 graduated in five
years, according to Chris Ken
nedy. assistant athletic director.
That figure, based on the NCAA's
formula, is just slightly below the
92 percent of all student-athletes
at Duke who graduate in five
years.
Unlike Stanford and most Divi
sion I institutions, Duke does not
redshirt freshman players unless
they are injured, Kennedy said.
Kennedy attributed Duke's high
graduation figure to several fac
tors including the quality of stu
dents admitted to the university,
concern on the part of coaches
and a "reasonably effective sup
port system."
Part of that system allows Ken
nedy to look at the course
schedules of players and draw up
a daytime study period for fresh
man football players.
Notre Dame boasts some of the
most impressive figures among
major universities, Including a
98.9 percent graduation rate in
four years for all recruited football
players, according to Brian
Boulac. assistant athletic direc
tor. That figure is similar to the
data compiled for the NCAA as it
does not include students who
transfered from the university,

Boulac said.
Notre Dame has been
recognized by the College Football
Association (CFA) for its gradua
tion percentages, winning the
CFA's annual academic achieve
ment award in 1981, 1982 and
1983, Boulac said. Duke won the
award in 1986.
The CFA award is presented to
the university with the highest
percentage of players who entered
a university and graduated in five
years, including those who trans
fered elsewhere. In 1984, 27 of 28
athletes recruited five years prior
to that date graduated from Notre
Dame, Boulac said.
Boulac stressed that while Notre
Dame provides a tutoring system
for its scholarship football players
free and at a cost for other stu
dents. the university doesn't make
academics easier for student
athletes.
"We're not going to pamper
them or lead them by the hand,"
Boulac said, adding that "you're a
student here first."
Boulac also added that Notre
Dame does not offer a physical
education major, one often associ
ated with student-athletes at
many universities.
The University of Missouri,
which competes in the Big Eight
Conference with Oklahoma, last
fall filed with the NCAA a 58 per
cent graduation rate for its foot
ball players, according to Parris
Watts, director of Missouri's Total
Person Program. That program is

designed to meet the intellectual,
mental and academic needs of all
student-athletes. Watts said.
Watts said that number was
probably "one of the best in the
Big Eight."
He noted that at Missouri "very
few, even of the non-student
athletes. graduate in four years,"
pointing out that 49 percent of
Mizzou's total student population
take five years to graduate.
UC-Berkeley's graduation per
centage for recruited football
players, filed last fall and using
the NCAA's formula, is 41.6 per
cent. according to Carol Iwaoka,
faculty-athletic representative.
wnile that figure is lower than
Oklahoma's, Iwaoka stressed that
it is hard to compare the academic
quality and emphasis at the two
institutions.
"You're comparing apples and
oranges." Iwaoka said, adding
that "one sport should not reflect
the academic achievements of the
student-athlete population" at
Berkeley.
Comparing graduation rates
without looking at the academic
caliber of the universities "does
not do an institution justice," she
said.
The graduation rate in five years
for the entire student population
at UC-Berkeley, including those
who transfer in good standing, is
approximately 62 percent, accord
ing to Austin Frank, director of
academic research.

Faculty athletic representative
some universities do not include
transfers in their statistics.
From 1976 to 1983, 144 of 154
scholarship football players who
entered Stanford graduated or are
still enrolled, Friedenthal said,
calling those statistics "stunning
figures."
Penn State, which would not
release the graduation rate it filed
with the NCAA, has an 86 percent
graduation rate for its football
players over the past 30 years, ac
cording to Pete Kowalskl of Penn
State's S.I.D. That figure Includes
all those who entered Penn State
and graduated at some time from
the university, he said.
While Friedenthal praised Penn
State's commitment to academics,
he noted that one must also con
sider the types of majors student
athletes pursue at such univer
sities.
During the Fiesta Bowl, majors
including parks and recreation
and administration of justice
flashed below the names of several
Penn State football players.
Penn State also has mandatory
study halls four nights per week
for all freshmen football players.
Kowalskl said. While Stanford has
no such mandatory study periods,
other universities, including

Duke and Oklahoma, have some
form of mandatory study sessions
for their freshmen football
players, according to officials at
those schools.
At Duke, 89 percent of all
recruited football players who en
tered in 1980-81 graduated in five
years, according to Chris Ken
nedy. assistant athletic director.
That figure, based on the NCAA's
formula, is just slightly below the
92 percent of all student-athletes
at Duke who graduate in five
years.
Unlike Stanford and most Divi
sion I institutions, Duke does not
redshirt freshman players unless
they are injured, Kennedy said.
Kennedy attributed Duke's high
graduation figure to several fac
tors including the quality of stu
dents admitted to the university,
concern on the part of coaches
and a "reasonably effective sup
port system."
Part of that system allows Ken
nedy to look at the course
schedules of players and draw up
a daytime study period for fresh
man football players.
Notre Dame boasts some of the
most impressive figures among
major universities, Including a
98.9 percent graduation rate in
four years for all recruited football
players, according to Brian
Boulac. assistant athletic direc
tor. That figure is similar to the
data compiled for the NCAA as it
does not include students who
transfered from the university,

Boulac said.
Notre Dame has been
recognized by the College Football
Association (CFA) for its gradua
tion percentages, winning the
CFA's annual academic achieve
ment award in 1981, 1982 and
1983, Boulac said. Duke won the
award in 1986.
The CFA award is presented to
the university with the highest
percentage of players who entered
a university and graduated in five
years, including those who trans
fered elsewhere. In 1984, 27 of 28
athletes recruited five years prior
to that date graduated from Notre
Dame, Boulac said.
Boulac stressed that while Notre
Dame provides a tutoring system
for its scholarship football players
free and at a cost for other stu
dents. the university doesn't make
academics easier for student
athletes.
"We're not going to pamper
them or lead them by the hand,"
Boulac said, adding that "you're a
student here first."
Boulac also added that Notre
Dame does not offer a physical
education major, one often associ
ated with student-athletes at
many universities.
The University of Missouri,
which competes in the Big Eight
Conference with Oklahoma, last
fall filed with the NCAA a 58 per
cent graduation rate for its foot
ball players, according to Parris
Watts, director of Missouri's Total
Person Program. That program is

designed to meet the intellectual,
mental and academic needs of all
student-athletes. Watts said.
Watts said that number was
probably "one of the best in the
Big Eight."
He noted that at Missouri "very
few, even of the non-student
athletes. graduate in four years,"
pointing out that 49 percent of
Mizzou's total student population
take five years to graduate.
UC-Berkeley's graduation per
centage for recruited football
players, filed last fall and using
the NCAA's formula, is 41.6 per
cent. according to Carol Iwaoka,
faculty-athletic representative.
wnile that figure is lower than
Oklahoma's, Iwaoka stressed that
it is hard to compare the academic
quality and emphasis at the two
institutions.
"You're comparing apples and
oranges." Iwaoka said, adding
that "one sport should not reflect
the academic achievements of the
student-athlete population" at
Berkeley.
Comparing graduation rates
without looking at the academic
caliber of the universities "does
not do an institution justice," she
said.
The graduation rate in five years
for the entire student population
at UC-Berkeley, including those
who transfer in good standing, is
approximately 62 percent, accord
ing to Austin Frank, director of
academic research.
Last December, during the an
nual college football bowl
bonanza, the lives of student
athletes across the country were
thrust into the media spotlight.
Sparked by the implementation of
the NCAA's new drug-testing
policy and the controversy sur
rounding the use of anabolic
steroids, a media barrage of
student-athlete profiles bom
barded the networks' pregame
and halftime shows.
Amid this air of things gone
wrong in the world of college ath
letics and the feeling that college
football players were no more than
hired hands employed by univer
sities in the name of higher educa
tion, some colleges attempted to
raise themselves from the muck
by purporting high graduation
rates for their football players.
When Penn State squared off
against the University of Miami
for the national championship, an
almost pious attitude was taken
with respect to the academic
achievements of Penn State
players. It seemed Penn State was
the last bastion of higher educa
tion in which the athlete was a
student first and a competitor on
the field second.
Penn State's graduation rates
for recruited football players,
however, are no higher than that
of a number of schools, including
Stanford, Notre Dame and Duke
University, according to informa
tion made available from all four
universities.
UC-Berkeley's graduation rate
for recruited football players is sig
nificantly lower than those of
Stanford and Duke when all three

institutions are compared using
an NCAA graduation formula.
While it seems clear that
graduation rates alone are not a
sufficient indicator of the quality
of student-athletes' work or of the
intellectual caliber of the institu
tion and the fields in which stu
dents major, the NCAA places
enough stock in graduation rates
to require all Division I institi
tions to file an annual report of
recruited athletes, according to
Ursula Walsh, director of research
and sports science for the NCAA in
Mission. Kan.

The NCAA's graduation formula
is based on a five-year period, or
the time a student-athlete would
have at an institution while eligi
ble to compete, allowing for one
red-shirted year. In reports filed
last fall with the NCAA, univer
sities were requested to look at all
recruited student-athletes who
matriculated as freshmen in the
1980-81 school year and to deter

mine their graduation status as of
Aug. 31, 1985.
The NCAA's formula, however,
is not as simple as it sounds. It ex
cludes from a university's figures
all student-athletes who left "in
good standing" from the institu
tion. Also, junior college transfers
are not counted in the data. Walsh
said.
While the NCAA's full report will
not be available until Feb. 23 and
the only past data the NCAA has is
from a 1981 report that combined
statistics from Division I, II and 111
institutions, several universities
were willing to disclose gradua
tion rates for recruited football
players. Some universities pro
vided information using the
NCAA's formula, while others pro
vided their own figures and data
spanning a number of years.
Stanford's five-year graduation
rate for recruited football players
using the NCAA's formula is 95.2
percent, according to University
Registrar Sally Mahoney. The
same formula gives all student
athletes for that period a 91.4 per
cent figure, while the number for
all students is 92.4 percent.
Using the University's own
graduation statistics, which in
clude any student-athlete who left
the University for any reason, 93.5
percent of all scholarship football
players who entered between 1976
and 1983 have either graduated or
are still enrolled here, according to
Law Prof. Jack Friedenthal. the
University's faculty-athletic repre
sentative to the Pacific 10 and the
NCAA.
"Our figures are for every kid
who walks through that door."
Friedenthal said, noting that

He noted that at Missouri "very
few, even of the non-student
athletes. graduate in four years,"
pointing out that 49 percent of
Mizzou's total student population
take five years to graduate.
UC-Berkeley's graduation per
centage for recruited football
players, filed last fall and using
the NCAA's formula, is 41.6 per
cent. according to Carol Iwaoka,
faculty-athletic representative.
wnile that figure is lower than
Oklahoma's, Iwaoka stressed that
it is hard to compare the academic
quality and emphasis at the two
institutions.
"You're comparing apples and
oranges." Iwaoka said, adding
that "one sport should not reflect
the academic achievements of the
student-athlete population" at
Berkeley.
Comparing graduation rates
without looking at the academic
caliber of the universities "does
not do an institution justice," she
said.
The graduation rate in five years
for the entire student population
at UC-Berkeley, including those
who transfer in good standing, is
approximately 62 percent, accord
ing to Austin Frank, director of
academic research.
