# Career Center releases policy
## 
### TRACIE THOMPSON Staff writer 
Employers who unlawfully dis
criminate on the basis of sexual
orientation will be prohibited next
year from recruiting at Stanford,
according to a policy statement
from the Career Planning and
Placement Center (CPPC).
But the policy — unlike that of
the Law School and Graduate
School of Business — would still
allow campus recruiting by the
United States military and federal
agencies such as the CIA that are
legally permitted to discriminate
against homosexuals.
The CPPC has changed its Non-
Discrimination Policy Statement
for 1987-88 to permit use of its
facilities only by "employers who
do not unlawfully discriminate in
the selection of employees on the
basis of. . . sexual orientation."
"It's really not a great change in
policy in that the military will still
be able to come on campus," said
Ruth Schneider, director of CPPC.
Students and others on campus
have been trying since 1975 to get
sexual orientation added to
CPPC's list of unacceptable dis
crimination. Within the last three
years, both the Law School and
Graduate School of Business have
adopted policies barring dis
criminatory federal employers
from using their career planning

offices in any way.
Daniel Bao, a junior and spokes
man for the Gay and Lesbian Alli
ance at Stanford (GLAS), said he
would have been "much happier"
if the new policy statement had
prohibited all employers who dis
criminate against gays. "The Uni
versity aids and abets the military
in its discriminatory hiring," Bao
said.
Schneider defended the policy
as consistent with the center's
role as a student service. "The mil
itary does discriminate and we
know they discriminate, but we
don't think it's our role to make
decisions for students who want
to talk to the military." Schneider
said.
The Department of Defense has
threatened to cut their federal
funding to colleges or universities
that ban military recruiters that
could theoretically result in a
$125 million loss for the Univer
sity, Bao said. He added that he
believed even if Stanford did ban
military recruiters, the Pentagon
would not carry through with its
threat because of the importance
of Stanford's research.
Schneider said she was not
aware of the Department of
Defense rules but said "it was not
a factor in our decision."
