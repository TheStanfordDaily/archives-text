## 
### MARK LAWRENCE Senior staff writer 
A Branner freshman who at
tempted suicide Thursday night
by ingesting sodium cyanide crys
tals is being held at a Belmont
hospital pending the results of a
psychological evaluation.
The student has been in good
physical condition since recover
ing from the poison at Stanford
Hospital Friday morning, but doc
tors at the Belmont Hills Psychia
tric Center are monitoring him
closely to determine whether long
term psychiatric care is necessary,
according to Branner resident as
sistants and University adminis
trators familiar with the case.
Branner RAs Clay Calvert and
Dana Treister said they had not
believed before Friday that the
student was especially troubled,
and the Stanford officials. Asst.
Deans of Student Affairs Diana
Conklin and James Larimore,
said they had never heard of any
problems with him.
Police are unsure how the stu
dent obtained the cyanide crys
tals. RAs said. But. they said,
police found a partially full bottle

of the poison hidden in his closet
and will try to trace its origin.
Police were unavailable for com
ment last night.
The bottle had a neat label that
included the factory lot number of
the bottle, but Stanford chemists
said it is unlikely the chemical
came from a University lab, ac
cording to RAs.
The suicide attempt was discov
ered at about 12:15 a.m. Friday,
when a roommate found the stu
dent lying unconscious on his
bed, gasping for breath. Calvert
called the police after he and the
roommate were unable to rouse
the poisoned student.
Police and paramedics took the
student to Stanford Hospital,
where he was treated and kept un
til Friday afternoon, when doctors
decided to transfer him to the
hospital's Hoover Pavilion build
ing for the remainder of a 72-hour
observation period, according to
Larimore.
In preparation for the move to
the Hoover Pavilion, nurses
removed his intravenous medica
tion, and, when orderlies left him
unattended for a short time in the
lobby of the Pavilion, he left the
building alone, Larimore said.
The student was later found at
Toyon Hall and taken to Belmont
Hills, a higher-security facility,
added Larimore, who said he is
unsure what the student did
during the afternoon.
Larimore said he does not know
when or if the student will return
to school.
