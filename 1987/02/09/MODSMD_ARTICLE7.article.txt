# Blacks' economic difficulties addressed
## 
### KRISTIN BARENDSEN Staff writer 
Black Americans suffer low self
esteem. low aspirations and a lack
of racial identity that prevent
them from climbing the economic
ladder in the United States, psy
chologist Nairn Akbar said in a
symposium in Kresge Auditorium
Friday night.
"Our situation is desperate."
Akbar said, his comments greeted
with applause. "We need to look
beyond the devastating statistics
at the imperative behind them.
Unless you can throw the statis
tics out of the window and trans
form the world, you are an idiot
and a failure and we don't need
you."
Three other speakers joined Ak
bar. a professor of psychology and
a clinical psychologist at Florida
State University, at the sympo
sium. entitled: "The Time is Now:
Black Economic Empowerment.

More than 130 people attended.
Manning Marable. professor of
sociology and political science at
Purdue University, spoke of the
impact of President Reagan's "war
economy" on the job prospects for
black Americans. According to
Marable. the defense industry al
most exclusively hires highly
trained whites, "creating apart
heid" and limiting employment
opportunities for blacks. "There's
something wrong in a society
where 20 million people sleep
homeless every night. We need to
demand a fuil-employment eco
nomy (with) an activist, interven
tionist strategy."
Marable cited examples of un
reported outbreaks of racial vio
lence in Toledo. Brooklyn and
several college campuses. "Does
Howard Beach represent a new
trend?" Marable asked. He
referred to the district courts,
where the black appointment is
"below 1 percent." to illustrate the

"social context for white
supremacy."
"What can students do? Study
and struggle." Marable said.
Using statistics from the U.S.
Census Bureau, Margaret Simms,
deputy director of research at the
Joint Center for Political Studies
in Washington. D.C., said the
average black family income is
only 55 percent of the average
white family income. She said
black entrepreneurial activity is
far below that of other groups,
constituting 2 percent of total
U.S. businesses in 1982.
In 1982, only 11 percent of
black businesses had one or more
paid employees, and black busi
ness represented less than one
fifth of 1 percent of total U.S.
receipts, she said.
Simms cited as causal factors
the lack of black role models in
successful positions, the lack of
emphasis in black culture toward

business and blacks' lack of
venture capital.
"There is one factor that is a
psychological barrier," Akbar
said. "We didn't come (to America)
by way of Ellis Island, looking for
opportunity."
According to Akbar, while other
groups built communities, such
as Chinatowns, based on a sense
of cultural pride, the black experi
ence was "a process of denying our
source of strength. We were
ashamed of our culture."
Akbar said this problem of iden
tity is the root of today's black eco
nomic crisis. "Blacks camouflage
their identity. They want to work
for somebody. Few of us want to
take over corporate America."
"We have a fear of wealth," Ak
bar continued. "Wealth requires
responsibility, and we have to face
competition and low self-esteem."
