Hostage makes videotaped plea
BEIRUT, Lebanon — American professor Alann Steen.
kidnaped with three colleagues two weeks ago. yesterday appealed
to the United States to comply with his captors' demands or "our
fate will be execution."
A 10-minute-long video cassette of Steen. kidnapped from
Beirut University College last month, was delivered to news
agencies today. It showed him sitting against a red background
and reading, in an even voice, from a handwritten text. The text
appeared to be dictated by his captors because of its numerous
grammatical errors.
His captors, the Islamic Jihad for the Liberation of Palestine,
renewed threats to kill the four professors — three Americans and
one Indian — if Israel does not released 400 imprisoned Pales
tinians by Monday.
"If they don't get released our fate will be execution and the Is
lamic Jihad for the Liberation of Palestine is serious about the
time it set," Steen said. "They are also serious about taking
revenge from any country that helps the Americans make use of
its territories in its attack on Lebanon."
A U.S. Navy assault force, including the USS John F. Kennedy
and the USS Nimltz aircraft carrier, had moved near Lebanon last
week following the lastest round of kidnaplngs here, raising fears
of a U.S. attack.
Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger said in London Sunday
that the United States may send more warships to the Mediter
ranean. but refused to speculate about reprisals if the hostages
are killed. "As situations get somewhat more critical — and no one
can deny that what is happening in Lebanon, in Syria, In Iran and
in Iraq is not a somewhat critical situation — then the presence
may Increase."
Shultz backs new ABM policy
WASHINGTON — Secretary of State George Shultz indicated
yesterday he now accepts the need to follow a more permissive in
terpretation of the 1972 Antiballistic Missile (ABM) treaty to test
key elements of the Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI).
But Shultz. speaking on ABC's "This Week With David
Brlnkley," added that the administration would not formally make
such a decision before consulting with Congress and U.S. allies.
SDI research has yielded considerable progress, he said, even
under the "restrictive" or narrow interpretation of the ABM treaty
that successive U.S. administrations embraced from 1972 until
1985. when the Reagan White House first questioned it.
"But it is clear enough now. given the progress that has been
made, that you'd be able to pursue the program much more effec
tively — and perhaps only — if a different pattern of testing is per
mitted." Shultz said, in a statement that aides said was worked
out in a Friday meeting with Secretary of Defense Caspar
Weinberger. The phrase "a different pattern of testing" appeared
to mean a pattern of tests not permitted under the previous,
restrictive interpretation of the ABM treaty.
That pact barred the superpowers from deploying mobile an
tiballistic missile systems on land, sea or in space. The adminis
tration has claimed that ambiguities in the negotiating record
leave room for testing and development of such systems if they are
based on exotic technologies not known in 1972, when the treaty
was negotiated.
Iran-Iraq combat remains heavy
CAIRO, Egypt — Iraqi Army counterattacks last week routed
Iranian forces from some positions just east of Basra but failed to
dislodge the bulk of Iran's assault force occupying Iraqi territory.
An Iranian military communique reported that 700 Iraqis were
killed or wounded during the weekend when Iraqi forces mounted
a two-pronged counterattack against Iranian forces besieging the
southern port city of Basra. The hand-to-hand fighting reportedly
was supported on the Iraqi side by tanks and heavy artillery.
Western military analysts credit the Iraqi counterattacks, which
began a week ago. with a brutal rout of Iranian attackers from the
western banks of Fish Lake, a canal-like reservoir built as a defen
sive barrier six miles east of Basra.
The Iraqis also reportedly reversed the forward momentum of
Iranian forces that slogged their way up the western banks of the
Shatt al Arab waterway during the first two weeks of the offensive.
But as of Sunday, one month after the offense began, neither
side has been able to consolidate its battlefield gains. With an
other major Iranian push expected this month, military intelli
gence analysts in the region suggest that the offensive may be set
tling into a war of attrition that poses grave dangers for Iraq.
Britain uneasy about Reagan
LONDON — Britain has become uneasy, and increasingly out
spoken. over what it sees as mounting indications that the
Reagan administration has become a lame duck.
Concern is most immediately focused on the administration's
seeming inability to come to grips with the Iran-contra arms af
fair. The continuation of the controversy in Washington, and the
worsening situation in Lebanon and the Persian Gulf, have had
two results here.
One has been a gradual intensification of British disapproval of
the arms-for-hostages deal, and resentment over the deception it
entailed. "The pot has been calling the kettle black." said a senior
government official, referring to administration warnings to its
Western European allies over the past several years of the dangers
of dealing with terrorists.
But the Iran scandal has had the much broader effect of under
mining confidence in administration ability to deal effectively,
and in the British view wisely, with a range of issues from
East/West relations and arms control to the Middle East and
Central America.
In some instances, it has emboldened the Western European
allies to band together to disagree with U.S. policy and push their
own alternatives. Rejecting the recent U.S. military buildup in the
Mediterranean as a counterproductive show of bravado in obtain
ing the release of hostages. Britain and France joined last week to
refuse to participate in a U.S.-proposed meeting in Rome on the
hostage crisis. The meeting was canceled.
Military schedules exchanged
BRUSSELS. Belgium — The first military exercise to be held un
der the 1986 Stockholm agreement on security and confidence
building measures in Europe took place last week in western
Czechoslovakia not far from the West German border, watched by
at least a dozen official observers from Western countries. NATO
authorities said Sunday.
In addition. Warsaw Pact nations have officially notified all
North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) powers and and all
other European governments except that of Albania of the dates,
size of forces and map locations for 31 other sets of maneuvers or
field exercises that they will be holding during 1987. Eighteen of
these will be in the Soviet Union.
For their part, the NATO countries have given similar notices of
19 major field exercises that are planned during the year, and
neutral and nonaligned states have given notice of five, three of
the latter in Switzerland and one each In Austria and Yugoslavia.
