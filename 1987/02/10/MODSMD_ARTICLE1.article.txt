# Trustees postpone CIR plan

### CLINT HIGHFILL Senior staff writer 
Stanford will not have formal
voting criteria when stockholders
in Hewlett-Packard Corp., Fluor
Corp. and Deere and Company
vote in the next four weeks on
resolutions calling for those com
panies' withdrawal from South
Africa.
Instead, Stanford will proceed
on a case-by-case basis in voting
852,508 shares of Hewlett-
Packard stock, 500 shares of Fluor
Corp. stock and an unspecified
amount of Deere stock.
Stanford will vote on more than
50 withdrawal resolutions be
tween now and June, and though
none are expected to pass, the
resolutions are intended to put
pressure on boards of directors to
pull their companies out of South
Africa.
The Commission on Investment
Responsibility (CIR) has drawn up
criteria for Stanford to follow in
voting on the resolutions, but yes
terday the Board of Trustees Spe
cial Committee on Investment Re
sponsibility (SCIR) deferred action
on that plan until next month.
CIR Chairman Frederick Hillier
said trustees on the SCIR will
work with the 11-member CIR in
the next few weeks to modify the
voting criteria proposed by the
CIR.
But Hillier said the final criteria
will probably be less stringent
than the ClR's proposed
guidelines and. if so. would result
in fewer Stanford votes in favor of
withdrawal.
The CIR recommended that:
□ "Stanford should automatically
vote for disinvestment from com
panies that are not Sullivan sig
natories or have a Sullivan rating
of III."
11l Is the lowest Sullivan rating
possible. Of the companies in the
Stanford portfolio facing
withdrawal resolutions, three
have a 111 rating on the Sullivan
Priniciples, and three are non
signatories, according to Hillier.
□ Stanford should vote for disin
vestment from companies with a
Sullivan rating of II or "new."
[signalling a new signatory] unless
the company's historical record or
level of commitment leads the CIR
to believe that they continue to be
an unusually progressive force."
Twenty-eight of the Stanford
companies facing withdrawal
resolutions have a II rating, and
