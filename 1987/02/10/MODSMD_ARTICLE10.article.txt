Reagan administration's secret
arms sales to Iran, was rushed to
Bethesda Naval Hospital yesterday

tablets of the tranquilizer Valium.
McFarlane. who was listed in
good condition yesterday, was ad
mitted to the hospital at about 8
a.m., just two hours before he was
scheduled to testify before the
Tower Commission, the presiden

fice. McFarlane was conscious and
able to talk a bit, but he did not in
dicate why he had taken the drug.

"He made no statement as to the
reason why. although there's
every indication it was an
overdose." Acquaviva said. "He did
not talk â€” outside of indicating he
had taken the Valium. . . . Mrs.
McFarlane appeared to be upset
but also apparently perplexed
about the situation."
Acquaviva said his investigation
was a routine procedure after a
report of "an unattended death or
death attempt."
John Henshaw. an aide to
McFarlane. confirmed that the
former national security adviser
had taken "an apparent Valium
overdose" but would not comment
on whether the overdose had been
a suicide attempt.
Friends and associates of
McFarlane acknowledged yester

strain as a result of the investiga

amounts of Valium and all that
happens Is that you sleep for some
time."

A friend of McFarlane said he
was not looking forward to a
spring of testifying about the Iran
contra affair. "He didn't relish
being put in the position he's In,"

McFarlane's testimony had con

question of whether Reagan ap
proved the shipment of weapons
to Iran sent by Israel.
