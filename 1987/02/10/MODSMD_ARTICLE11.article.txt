BEIRUT, Lebanon - Kidnappers holding
three American professors hostage here
relented after threatening to kill them as of
midnight last night if Israel failed to respond
to their demands for the release of 400 Pales
tinian prisoners. Shortly after midnight, the
kidnappers said they were extending the
deadline "until further notice."
The captors' communique, delivered early
today to the offices of a news agency, along
with a photograph of one of the hostages.
Robert Polhill, said the delay was prompted by
the "repeated calls of the hostages themselves
for a deferment of the deadline, mounting
pleas by their families and national Lebanese
bodies as well as the Indian government."
The communique also referred to a state
ment by Israeli Foreign Minister Shimon
Peres, which it said "contained certain positive
points over the release" of the Palestinian
prisoners. "We want the fastest clarifications
on this subject," the captors said

Peres had said yesterday that Israel would
not meet the demands of the kidnappers, but
he had left the door open for a solution by ob
serving that until Israel is approached directly,
"it will not take any initiative on that issue."
The abrupt dropping of the deadline for kil
ling the hostages came only hours after their
kidnappers released a letter from them that
called on the United States to press Israel to
respond to the demands and contained
moving personal messages to families and
friends, one of them referring to midnight as
"the farewell hour."
"This is the last message," said the three
page handwritten letter, signed by hostages
Alann Steen, Robert Polhill and Jesse Turner.
"Once again we announce that we will be ex
ecuted at midnight. Until then, if you do love
us and your hearts beat for us. put pressure on
Israel to show good will."
Later, just four hours before midnight, the
wives of the hostages made an emotional ap

peal on behalf of their husbands. "Please,
please spare the lives of our husbands,"
pleaded Ferial Polhlll at a press conference.
Islamic Jihad for the Liberation of Palestine,
the group that has claimed responsibility for
the Jan. 24 gunpoint abduction of the three
Beirut University College professors and an In
dian colleague, Mithileshwar Singh, who was
not named in the hostages' letter, has offered
to free them in exchange for the release of 400
Palestinians captured by Israel In southern
Lebanon over the past 10 years.
In a quavering voice, Virginia Rose Steen ap
peared to signal that efforts were under way to
work out a solution. "Things are happening
here," she said, addressing her husband and
the other hostages. "You must know we are ur
ging everyone throughout the world, our gov
ernment and the governments of the world to
open peaceful and humanitarian dialogue.
They are acting now to save you."
