# Prof. shortage may harm education quality
## 
### HUGH R. BETHELL Staff writer 
Over the next two decades, a dwindling
faculty, increased competition among uni
versities for top professors and a shortage
of resources available to attract them may
affect the quality of education at Stanford,
according to Dean of Humanities and
Sciences Norman Wessells.
However, the academic difficulties chal
lenging Stanford and other top universities
make this an ideal time for college students
to consider academic careers, Wessells said
in a press briefing last week.
Wessells identified two causes of what he
called the "new reality of the faculty market
place," a situation in which professors will
be sought by more universities, offering
larger incentives.
He said one reason for the coming change
is that more major universities are entering
into serious research efforts, which means
more jobs are being created for top profes
sors around the country.
"In the past, we have had the Ivys, Cal
Tech. MIT, the Michigans and the
Berkeleys. Now there is a new group. It in
cludes, for example. Carnegie-Mellon, the

Universities of Virginia, Georgia, Florida.
Tenessee and Texas," Wessells said.
In addition, the large number of profes
sors who began working in the 1950s and
'60s are now reaching retirement age. Since
relatively few young professors have joined
university faculties during the last 20
years, those retirements will create a drop
in the number of professors working in the
United States. Wessells said.
As a result of the increased demand and
declining supply of professors, many uni
versities could have difficulty offering the
types of academic programs that they are
interested in maintaining.
"It could mean real difficulty in the com
ing decades for many universities and col
leges in hiring enough high-quality faculty
to maintain the standards we now enjoy."
Wessells said.
Specifically, Wessells said he worries that
the available intellectual energy will be
spread too thin, depriving society of the
synergistic effect of having the best minds
working together in close proximity.
As more top professors are offered
salaries over $100,000, the increased
amount of competition among universities

may present serious financial difficulty for
the Univeristy.
"Truthfully, the Stanfords cannot com
pete in that ballpark, so we don't endeavor
to make counter offers at such high levels."
he said.
Instead of offering high salaries. Stanford
tries to lure top academics to Stanford by
emphasizing the quality of its students and
faculty, according to Wessells.
Other problems most universities must
face in coming years include the decreasing
level of financial support from federal and
state government, and the difficulty of fin
ding new professors housing and jobs for
their spouses in extremely expensive and
crowded areas like Boston, Princeton and
Palo Alto. Wessells said.
The silver lining of this impending faculty
shortage is that jobs will be plentiful for
those now entering graduate programs
with an eye on beginning careers in the aca
demic sector, he said. More positions, in a
wide variety of traditional and emerging
fields, will be open to young professors, es
pecially to women and minorities, Wessells
said.
Stanford Is encouraging undergraduate
students to pursue academic careers by in

volving more undergraduates In research,
developing a "minority pipeline" and
fundraising for graduate stipends and un
dergraduate incentives as part of the Cen
tennial campaign, according to Dean of Un
dergraduate Studies Carolyn Lougee.
In a national survey, over 30 percent of
freshmen entering Stanford this year said
they intend to earn a doctorate. That level is
impressively above the 18 percent national
average, Lougee said.
"The late 1980s is a terrific time for
talented people to be entering colleges and
universities and graduate schools with the
intent of a career in the academic profes
sions. because the jobs are going to be
there." Wessells said.
In addition to creating new career oppor
tunities. the changing reality of the aca
demic marketplace may also spark the
realignment of curricula, intellectual
thought and research foci, as younger pro
fessors bring new perspectives to the aca
demic world, he said.
"Universities and colleges need to take ad
vantage of this opportunity by reallocating
resources so that our teaching and research
will be even stronger, more cogent and more
forward-looking. . . ."
