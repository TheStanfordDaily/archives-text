A small group of anti-apartheid students protest
ing University investment policy staged a protest yes
terday at the Hoover Institution, where the Board of
Trustees was holding a meeting.
The group had originally planned to gather in
White Flaza for an anti-apartheid rally, then march
to the Hoover Institution, according to junior Barb
Voss, a member of Stanford Out of South Africa
(SOSA).
The planned White Plaza rally was thwarted,
however, by unexpected competition from another
speaker â€” evangelist Brother Cliffe.

The group of approximately 15 protesters
proceeded to Hoover, where they played loud music
and unfurled banners calling for divestment.
Because security at Hoover was tight, the
protesters decided to cancel a planned "sit-in/teach
in" with speakers from SOSA and the Stanford
African Students Association.
The protesters had hoped to be permitted to read a
set of demands to the trustees calling for full divest
ment from South Africa and increased dialogue be
tween students and the University on issues of in
vestment, Voss said.
Another protester noted that the Trustees' meeting
included no investment issues on its agenda.
