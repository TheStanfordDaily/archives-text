# Correction

### 
A news story in yesterdays Daily
stated incorrectly that two Delta
Upsilon pledges "were evicted
from Hurlburt last month after
they were linked to vandalism that
occurred on the Row Jan. 15. Ac
cording to Director of the Row
Diana Conklin. neither student
has been directly implicated for
vandalism.
The Daily regrets the error.
