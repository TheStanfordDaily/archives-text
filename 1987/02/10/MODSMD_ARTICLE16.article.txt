### 
On Friday the Interfraternity Council's
Rush Committee made two sensible
proposals concerning changes in Rush activ
ities. We urge the full IFC to adopt the recom
mendations when it meets Feb. 18.
The first proposal is that no alcohol be
served to Rushees during the middle week of
the three-week-long Rush. This would be a
good way of to ensure that the emphasis of
Rush parties is where it should be —off al
cohol use and on fraternity members and
Rushees getting to know each other.
The adoption of this proposal would give
each fraternity the opportunity to display to
its Rushees that fun can be had in the house
without the presence of alcohol.
The second proposal is that "Rush cards"
be distributed. Possession of a card would be
required for entrance to Rush activities. The
point of this is to limit Rush parties to those

who are really interested in rushing.
We back this recommendation as well. The
fraternities have blamed those not serious
about rushing with causing problems during
Rush. If the non-serious are kept out, prob
lems should be eliminated. If incidents con
tinue to occur during Rush activities, they
could no longer be blamed on outsiders.
Also, if parties are smaller, the chances of
them getting out of hand are fewer.
The fraternities should take responsibility
for their activities, so it is good to see that a
reform of Rush policies is coming from
within the IFC.
The Rush Committee's recommendations
come after several months of reviewing the
policy and talking with fraternity pledges
about their Rush experiences. Their conclu
sions are well-considered, moderate changes
that the IFC should adopt.
