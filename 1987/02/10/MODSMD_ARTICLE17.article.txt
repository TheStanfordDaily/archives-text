LOWELL UNGAR

In a society that is justly afraid
to walk its streets in the daylight,
support of legalized killing has
somehow become a sign of
humane feeling. Perhaps people
do not care that innocent defen
dants will be executed — four
people on death row in Arizona
were recently discovered to be in
nocent. Perhaps they choose not
to see the cruel psychological pain
of waiting for execution and the
terrible physical pain of all meth
ods of killing used (though they
oppose "cruel or unusual" punish
ment). But I do not see how to
escape the inherent inhumanity
of taking a human life. For I
believe that any killing — in the
midst of a lovers' quarrel or after
dozens of legal appeals —
cheapens the value of human life
and violates our human right to
live.
The argument for human rights
is simple. A human right is one
which we all have simply because
we are human. Thus, the Univer
sal Declaration of Human Rights
starts with the "recognition of the
inherent dignity and of the equal
and inalienable right of all mem
bers of the human family." Like it
or not, this family includes mili
tary officers (e.g. Colonel North),
radical Marxists and even axe
murderers. All these people have
the right to freedom of speech,
free practice of religion and due
process of the law. Can you deny
the fundamental righ« to life,
wihout which we can have no
other rights? It would be
hypocritical to give someone the
right to speak and then to rip out
his tongue. No act. however awful,
can justify the denial of the per
petrator's right to exist.
The valuing of human life is
harder to convey. We show how
much we care about other people
bv how we act. Every time we treat
other people as if they were
irksome ilies or we deny them the
ability to live in decent housing or
we relegate them to the ash heap
of history, we cut the value we put
on any human life. By denying the
humanity, the "Inherent dignity"
of people, we do two things: We do
not give them the respect they
deserve as humans, and. by exam
ple. we encourage others to act in
similar inhumane ways.
When someone I know looks
through me as if I were a metal
post or when a secretary treats me
as a minor inconvenience. I start
to adopt similar unseeing and bu
reaucratic attitudes toward
people. I no longer care about
others' feelings or even about their
lives. Murder is the ultimate
denial of a person's humanity, of
her or his existence. The death
penalty is a form of legalized,
selective murder. It Ignores the
fact that even a criminal is human
and violates the inherent dignity

we all share. And it lowers our
concern for human life. By killing
a murderer we do not show that
killing is wrong, only that it must
be sanctioned by the state.
Indeed, by ordering such deaths,
the state indicates that we indi
vidually should recognize the
worth of only certain lives, that
only some of us should be treated
as if we are human. I, for one,
would not presume to judge which
of us is so deserving.
The judgements that are made
show other inequities of capital
punishment. Only about 1 per
cent of all homicides (5 percent of
all convictions for murder) result
in a death sentence, and most of
these sentences are overturned on
appeal. Who is finally executed
depends mostly on factors such as
the judge and counsel who take
part in the case, the state in which
it is tried and random chance.
This system of Russian roulette
hardly seems appropriate to the
dignity of humans or to the
seriousness of the punishment.
Even more insidious are less
random factors in death sen
tences, especially class and race.
One recent study examined trials
for homicide in Florida, Georgia
and Texas from 1976 to 1978.

homicide" against whites received
the death penalty seven times as
often as whites arrested for the
same crime. Even more important
was the victim: The accused mur
derer of a white was 12 times more
likely to be sentenced to death
than one who killed a black.
Clearly, the death of a white (legal
or illegal) is seen as a more horren
dous event than the death of a
black; the lives of people with
black skin were given a lower
value. Similarly, defendants with
court-appointed counsel are much
more likely to be executed than
those with private counsel — your
life is worth what you can afford to
pay a lawyer to save it. As long as
the lives of colored and poor
people are not given equal protec
tion and equal worth, unfair ap
plication of the death penalty will
be an extreme example of. and a
contributing factor to. this dis
crimination.
The other reason 1 oppose capi
tal punishment is because all the
reasons cited for it are unconvinc
ing. The most common purpose
given for the death penalty is its
supposed deterrent effect on po
tential murderers. This effect
seems intuitively obvious, but it
vanishes under consideration.

Most murders are committed be
tween friends or lovers in great
anger and/or under the influence
of drugs; these unplanned mur
ders cannot be deterred by ra
tional considerations. The few
premeditated murders are com
mitted by people who think they
will not be caught and thus do not
care about our laws. It should not
be surprising that there is no clear
evidence for deterrence. Many
studies have been done compar
ing adjacent, similar states (e.g.
New Hampshire and Vermont),
one with and one without the
death penalty. Others have ex
amined the effect of the abolition
or reinstatement of a death
penalty law or the effects of actual
executions. The studies have
found only slight variations in
homicide rates, generally, but not
always, higher where capital
punishment is applied. Similarly,
actual executions seem to produce
only short term, minor effects —
they often are followed by a slight
increase in the murder rate. How
could capital punishment cause
an increase in murders? Precisely
because it shows a low value on
human life; it makes the taboo
against killing a person less
strong. For those few who can
countenance death, it gives the
perpetrator a kind of glamor,
making the murderer into a mar
tyr. Regardless of the cause of the
increase, I cannot believe we
demand anyone's death for a
clearly nonexistent deterrent ef
fect.
If we are serious about reducing
the number of killings in our soci
ety, there are many ways of doing
so. Most effective would be remov
ing handguns from general distri
bution through gun control. With
out a convenient, deadly weapon
at hand most of the arguments
that end in death today would
leave only ill-feelings or minor in
juries. Fighting drug (especially
alcohol) abuse would also prevent
many "irrational" homicides. The
murders that occur during the
committing of robbery and other
crimes would be reduced by eco
nomic measures — reducing un
employment and poverty are
about the only measures that have
been shown to affect the crime
rate. And I believe that any mea
sure that shows an increased ap
preciation for human life, espe
cially for the lives of poor and
downtrodden and uncared-for
people, will reduce our propensity
to hurt or kill those we forget are
human too.
The first step is to abolish the
death penalty. The California Su
preme Court should not face the
task of making decisions that di
rectly determine if a human being
will live or die. It certainly should
not make these decisions in the
political atmosphere of today —
justice cannot be blind to the
sight of a scared and outraged
public. But the more dispas
sionate the trial, the more well
considered the verdict, the greater
is the disrespect for human rights
and human life. We find those
murders worst which are done
coldly and deliberately, with care
ful forethought. Most callous of all
killings, most carefully consid
ered. are those with the full ap
proval of society and of the state.
The most respected moral ac
tors in our society have realized
this truth. Amnesty International
and other human rights organiza
tions. as well as most religious
denominations oppose the death
penalty. Every other Western in
dustrialized nation has abolished
it. They have realized that killing
people who kill people will never
show that killing people is wrong.
Shouldn't we do the same?

fact that even a criminal is human
and violates the inherent dignity

we all share. And it lowers our
concern for human life. By killing
a murderer we do not show that
killing is wrong, only that it must
be sanctioned by the state.
Indeed, by ordering such deaths,
the state indicates that we indi

worth of only certain lives, that
only some of us should be treated

of us is so deserving.

punishment. Only about 1 per

depends mostly on factors such as
the judge and counsel who take

This system of Russian roulette

homicide" against whites received
the death penalty seven times as
often as whites arrested for the
same crime. Even more important
was the victim: The accused mur
derer of a white was 12 times more
likely to be sentenced to death
than one who killed a black.
Clearly, the death of a white (legal
or illegal) is seen as a more horren
dous event than the death of a
black; the lives of people with
black skin were given a lower
value. Similarly, defendants with
court-appointed counsel are much
more likely to be executed than
those with private counsel — your
life is worth what you can afford to
pay a lawyer to save it. As long as
the lives of colored and poor
people are not given equal protec
tion and equal worth, unfair ap
plication of the death penalty will
be an extreme example of. and a
contributing factor to. this dis
crimination.
The other reason 1 oppose capi
tal punishment is because all the
reasons cited for it are unconvinc
ing. The most common purpose
given for the death penalty is its
supposed deterrent effect on po
tential murderers. This effect
seems intuitively obvious, but it
vanishes under consideration.

Most murders are committed be
tween friends or lovers in great
anger and/or under the influence
of drugs; these unplanned mur
ders cannot be deterred by ra
tional considerations. The few
premeditated murders are com
mitted by people who think they
will not be caught and thus do not
care about our laws. It should not
be surprising that there is no clear
evidence for deterrence. Many
studies have been done compar
ing adjacent, similar states (e.g.
New Hampshire and Vermont),
one with and one without the
death penalty. Others have ex
amined the effect of the abolition
or reinstatement of a death
penalty law or the effects of actual
executions. The studies have
found only slight variations in
homicide rates, generally, but not
always, higher where capital
punishment is applied. Similarly,
actual executions seem to produce
only short term, minor effects —
they often are followed by a slight
increase in the murder rate. How
could capital punishment cause
an increase in murders? Precisely
because it shows a low value on
human life; it makes the taboo
against killing a person less
strong. For those few who can
countenance death, it gives the
perpetrator a kind of glamor,
making the murderer into a mar
tyr. Regardless of the cause of the
increase, I cannot believe we
demand anyone's death for a
clearly nonexistent deterrent ef
fect.
If we are serious about reducing
the number of killings in our soci
ety, there are many ways of doing
so. Most effective would be remov
ing handguns from general distri
bution through gun control. With
out a convenient, deadly weapon
at hand most of the arguments
that end in death today would
leave only ill-feelings or minor in
juries. Fighting drug (especially
alcohol) abuse would also prevent
many "irrational" homicides. The
murders that occur during the
committing of robbery and other
crimes would be reduced by eco
nomic measures — reducing un
employment and poverty are
about the only measures that have
been shown to affect the crime
rate. And I believe that any mea
sure that shows an increased ap
preciation for human life, espe
cially for the lives of poor and
downtrodden and uncared-for
people, will reduce our propensity
to hurt or kill those we forget are
human too.
The first step is to abolish the
death penalty. The California Su
preme Court should not face the
task of making decisions that di
rectly determine if a human being
will live or die. It certainly should
not make these decisions in the
political atmosphere of today —
justice cannot be blind to the
sight of a scared and outraged
public. But the more dispas
sionate the trial, the more well
considered the verdict, the greater
is the disrespect for human rights
and human life. We find those
murders worst which are done
coldly and deliberately, with care
ful forethought. Most callous of all
killings, most carefully consid
ered. are those with the full ap
proval of society and of the state.
The most respected moral ac
tors in our society have realized
this truth. Amnesty International
and other human rights organiza
tions. as well as most religious
denominations oppose the death
penalty. Every other Western in
dustrialized nation has abolished
it. They have realized that killing
people who kill people will never
show that killing people is wrong.
Shouldn't we do the same?

LOWELL UNGAR

In a society that is justly afraid
to walk its streets in the daylight,
support of legalized killing has
somehow become a sign of
humane feeling. Perhaps people
do not care that innocent defen
dants will be executed — four
people on death row in Arizona
were recently discovered to be in
nocent. Perhaps they choose not
to see the cruel psychological pain
of waiting for execution and the
terrible physical pain of all meth
ods of killing used (though they
oppose "cruel or unusual" punish
ment). But I do not see how to
escape the inherent inhumanity
of taking a human life. For I
believe that any killing — in the
midst of a lovers' quarrel or after
dozens of legal appeals —
cheapens the value of human life
and violates our human right to
live.
The argument for human rights
is simple. A human right is one
which we all have simply because
we are human. Thus, the Univer
sal Declaration of Human Rights
starts with the "recognition of the
inherent dignity and of the equal
and inalienable right of all mem
bers of the human family." Like it
or not, this family includes mili
tary officers (e.g. Colonel North),
radical Marxists and even axe
murderers. All these people have
the right to freedom of speech,
free practice of religion and due
process of the law. Can you deny
the fundamental righ« to life,
wihout which we can have no
other rights? It would be
hypocritical to give someone the
right to speak and then to rip out
his tongue. No act. however awful,
can justify the denial of the per
petrator's right to exist.
The valuing of human life is
harder to convey. We show how
much we care about other people
bv how we act. Every time we treat
other people as if they were
irksome ilies or we deny them the
ability to live in decent housing or
we relegate them to the ash heap
of history, we cut the value we put
on any human life. By denying the
humanity, the "Inherent dignity"
of people, we do two things: We do
not give them the respect they
deserve as humans, and. by exam
ple. we encourage others to act in
similar inhumane ways.
When someone I know looks
through me as if I were a metal
post or when a secretary treats me
as a minor inconvenience. I start
to adopt similar unseeing and bu
reaucratic attitudes toward
people. I no longer care about
others' feelings or even about their
lives. Murder is the ultimate
denial of a person's humanity, of
her or his existence. The death
penalty is a form of legalized,
selective murder. It Ignores the
fact that even a criminal is human
and violates the inherent dignity

we all share. And it lowers our

found only slight variations in
homicide rates, generally, but not
always, higher where capital
punishment is applied. Similarly,
actual executions seem to produce
only short term, minor effects —
they often are followed by a slight
increase in the murder rate. How
could capital punishment cause
an increase in murders? Precisely
because it shows a low value on
human life; it makes the taboo
against killing a person less
strong. For those few who can
countenance death, it gives the
perpetrator a kind of glamor,
making the murderer into a mar
tyr. Regardless of the cause of the
increase, I cannot believe we
demand anyone's death for a
clearly nonexistent deterrent ef
fect.
If we are serious about reducing
the number of killings in our soci
ety, there are many ways of doing
so. Most effective would be remov
ing handguns from general distri
bution through gun control. With
out a convenient, deadly weapon
at hand most of the arguments
that end in death today would
leave only ill-feelings or minor in
juries. Fighting drug (especially
alcohol) abuse would also prevent
many "irrational" homicides. The
murders that occur during the
committing of robbery and other
crimes would be reduced by eco
nomic measures — reducing un
employment and poverty are
about the only measures that have
been shown to affect the crime
rate. And I believe that any mea
sure that shows an increased ap
preciation for human life, espe
cially for the lives of poor and
downtrodden and uncared-for
people, will reduce our propensity
to hurt or kill those we forget are
human too.
The first step is to abolish the
death penalty. The California Su
preme Court should not face the
task of making decisions that di
rectly determine if a human being
will live or die. It certainly should
not make these decisions in the
political atmosphere of today —
justice cannot be blind to the
sight of a scared and outraged
public. But the more dispas
sionate the trial, the more well
considered the verdict, the greater
is the disrespect for human rights
and human life. We find those
murders worst which are done
coldly and deliberately, with care
ful forethought. Most callous of all
killings, most carefully consid
ered. are those with the full ap
proval of society and of the state.
The most respected moral ac
tors in our society have realized
this truth. Amnesty International
and other human rights organiza
tions. as well as most religious
denominations oppose the death
penalty. Every other Western in
dustrialized nation has abolished
it. They have realized that killing
people who kill people will never
show that killing people is wrong.
Shouldn't we do the same?

LOWELL UNGAR

In a society that is justly afraid
to walk its streets in the daylight,
support of legalized killing has
somehow become a sign of
humane feeling. Perhaps people
do not care that innocent defen
dants will be executed — four
people on death row in Arizona
were recently discovered to be in
nocent. Perhaps they choose not
to see the cruel psychological pain
of waiting for execution and the
terrible physical pain of all meth
ods of killing used (though they
oppose "cruel or unusual" punish
ment). But I do not see how to
escape the inherent inhumanity
of taking a human life. For I
believe that any killing — in the
midst of a lovers' quarrel or after
dozens of legal appeals —
cheapens the value of human life
and violates our human right to
live.
The argument for human rights
is simple. A human right is one
which we all have simply because
we are human. Thus, the Univer
sal Declaration of Human Rights
starts with the "recognition of the
inherent dignity and of the equal
and inalienable right of all mem
bers of the human family." Like it
or not, this family includes mili
tary officers (e.g. Colonel North),
radical Marxists and even axe
murderers. All these people have
the right to freedom of speech,
free practice of religion and due
process of the law. Can you deny
the fundamental righ« to life,
wihout which we can have no
other rights? It would be
hypocritical to give someone the
right to speak and then to rip out
his tongue. No act. however awful,
can justify the denial of the per
petrator's right to exist.
The valuing of human life is
harder to convey. We show how
much we care about other people
bv how we act. Every time we treat
other people as if they were
irksome ilies or we deny them the
ability to live in decent housing or
we relegate them to the ash heap
of history, we cut the value we put
on any human life. By denying the
humanity, the "Inherent dignity"
of people, we do two things: We do
not give them the respect they
deserve as humans, and. by exam
ple. we encourage others to act in
similar inhumane ways.
When someone I know looks
through me as if I were a metal
post or when a secretary treats me
as a minor inconvenience. I start
to adopt similar unseeing and bu
reaucratic attitudes toward
people. I no longer care about
others' feelings or even about their
lives. Murder is the ultimate
denial of a person's humanity, of
her or his existence. The death
penalty is a form of legalized,
selective murder. It Ignores the
fact that even a criminal is human
and violates the inherent dignity

we all share. And it lowers our
concern for human life. By killing
a murderer we do not show that
killing is wrong, only that it must
be sanctioned by the state.
Indeed, by ordering such deaths,
the state indicates that we indi
vidually should recognize the
worth of only certain lives, that
only some of us should be treated
as if we are human. I, for one,
would not presume to judge which
of us is so deserving.
The judgements that are made
show other inequities of capital
punishment. Only about 1 per
cent of all homicides (5 percent of
all convictions for murder) result
in a death sentence, and most of
these sentences are overturned on
appeal. Who is finally executed
depends mostly on factors such as
the judge and counsel who take
part in the case, the state in which
it is tried and random chance.
This system of Russian roulette
hardly seems appropriate to the
dignity of humans or to the
seriousness of the punishment.
Even more insidious are less
random factors in death sen
tences, especially class and race.
One recent study examined trials
for homicide in Florida, Georgia
and Texas from 1976 to 1978.

homicide" against whites received
the death penalty seven times as
often as whites arrested for the
same crime. Even more important
was the victim: The accused mur
derer of a white was 12 times more
likely to be sentenced to death
than one who killed a black.
Clearly, the death of a white (legal
or illegal) is seen as a more horren
dous event than the death of a
black; the lives of people with
black skin were given a lower
value. Similarly, defendants with
court-appointed counsel are much
more likely to be executed than
those with private counsel — your
life is worth what you can afford to
pay a lawyer to save it. As long as
the lives of colored and poor
people are not given equal protec
tion and equal worth, unfair ap
plication of the death penalty will
be an extreme example of. and a
contributing factor to. this dis
crimination.
The other reason 1 oppose capi
tal punishment is because all the
reasons cited for it are unconvinc
ing. The most common purpose
given for the death penalty is its
supposed deterrent effect on po
tential murderers. This effect
seems intuitively obvious, but it
vanishes under consideration.

Most murders are committed be
tween friends or lovers in great
anger and/or under the influence
of drugs; these unplanned mur
ders cannot be deterred by ra
tional considerations. The few
premeditated murders are com
mitted by people who think they
will not be caught and thus do not
care about our laws. It should not
be surprising that there is no clear
evidence for deterrence. Many
studies have been done compar
ing adjacent, similar states (e.g.
New Hampshire and Vermont),
one with and one without the
death penalty. Others have ex
amined the effect of the abolition
or reinstatement of a death
penalty law or the effects of actual
executions. The studies have
found only slight variations in
homicide rates, generally, but not
always, higher where capital
punishment is applied. Similarly,
actual executions seem to produce
only short term, minor effects —
