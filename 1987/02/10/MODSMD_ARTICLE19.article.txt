# Make bomb immortal
## 
### 
There are strange things in the basement of
Twain, and maybe in other basements as well. In the
shadows there are 17.5 gallon drums and cardboard
boxes which contain metal boxes which contain
crackers. The metal drums say "drinking water."
They're empty. They also have directions, how to
"reuse as commode." Good thing they're empty then.
Those of you who've stored your bikes in that base
ment know about this civil defense stuff. But you
probably don't have a water can and a box of crackers
in your room. 1 do. Someone asked me once if I was
living in fear of a nuclear war. I said no.

These survival supplies wouldn't exactly help me
live longer. The cracker tin can't be opened by a nor
mal can opener, even if I had a can opener. I have
managed to pry one open, though, and I've seen
what's inside. Now its contents will be revealed to
you.
The tins are gold-colored, and clearly labelled "civil
defense all-purpose survival cracker." I don't claim to
know all the purposes that these crackers can be put
to. Just don't feed them to your dog. I did. He threw
up.
The tins weigh six-and-a-half pounds and there
are 419 crackers per tin. This is what it says on the
tin. My box is stamped with the date 7-62, which
means it's 25 years old this year. It's four years older
than I am. A quarter of a century, and still no
demand. Good to know we haven't needed them.
Scary to think they're all we have.
I took a box home with me last summer, mostly for
entertainment. (Look. Mom and Dad. food service!)
We opened it with wire cutters, or something. It
produced wicked sharp edges. Are there first-aid kits
in that basement? Somebody should check.
The crackers are wrapped in wax paper, like
graham cracker packages. The crackers look like
saltines, sort of. They're made of wheat and corn
flour, corn sugar, vegetable shortening, salt and
leavening — plus chemicals, for freshness. They were
baked by the National Biscuit Company, New York.
Made in the U.S.A.
They smelled musty. I think I only tasted a crumb.
Like I said, we gave some to the dog.
Don't try this at home.
You wouldn't want to live on crackers like that, es
pecially after a nuclear war. After the bomb, you want
chocolate.

I'm reminded of where my family lives, in a sub
division bordering Fort Ord. It is an empty land —
fields and hills and a stream bed — where people jog
and walk their dogs. But sometimes I'd look out my
bedroom window and see a tank. The first time it
happened, I couldn't believe it was a tank. I got out
the binoculars to make sure. Perched on the top of a
hill, it looked like a cardboard silhouette.
Sometimes the dog finds half-empty ration
packages out there and eats what's left. If you go on
the other side of the hill, you can find bullet shells.
My high school also bordered on Army land. We'd
sit in class and the windows would rattle from mor
tar practice.
This is all so strange because in America we can't
imagine tanks in our streets, but we're at home with
survival supplies. We think of civil defense as some
thing comic — duck and cover. The bomb is more ab
surd than horrifying. We know it as a cultural image.
It's like a TV rerun — always with us. The bomb is
like the Bill Cosby of destructive forces. We're fond of
it.
This is how it should be.
As in the movie "Desert Bloom." the bomb is like a
flower. It's beautiful.
But the bomb is fate as an end. not as a process.
But for atheists, the bomb can seem to replace
God, and all the things that a god means.
These are conflicting viewpoints.
I think it means something that I can't talk about
the nuclear issue seriously. If I'm serious, then I'm
thinking of our nuclear capability as a problem to be
solved; just like the scientists thought of its creation
as a problem to be solved. But we can't solve the
bomb, any more than we can "solve" human exis
tence. Both exist now. If we want to preserve human
life, then we need to cradle the bomb.
This is the hardest thing humans have ever had to
do. Wc are used to thinking of life's events as having
a beginning, middle and end. Boxes of crackers are
consumed and thrown away. People, even, are born
and live and die. But the bomb can't come to this
kind of end. In the bomb, humans have created
something immortal.
We have to stop thinking of the bomb as an instru
ment of mortality. It has no responsiblity for itself.
Rather, in the bomb, humans have created the
device by which the human dream of immortality
can be achieved. We have too preserve the life of the
bomb — keep it in suspension, rather, out of time —
in order to preserve human life. All the immortality
that can be sustained in books and art and human
artifacts is now dependent on the immortality of the
bomb.
So as long as those crackers stay sealed in the
basement, life goes on.
