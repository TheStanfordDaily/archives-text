Dollie editorial
missed point
Let's Just set the record
straight, shall we? I'm the "at
least one male" who tried out for
Dollies last year. That's right, the
only male — In fact, to the best of
my knowledge, I'm the only male
who has ever tried out for the
squad as It stands now. I didn't
audition to make history; I had
another purpose in mind. I had
no intention of trying to change
the Dollies into "Dollies and
Dudes"; I wanted to play by their
rules. As my feminist friends
pointed out in their editorial
"Guys and Dollies" (Daily, Feb. 3),
"it was once inconceivable that

there would be female doctors."
This is true, but the medical
profession didn't all at once
change to accommodate women;
women became doctors by travel
ing the same routes that men had
to travel.
If men want to be on the field,
we have to do it the Dollies' way.
And if we don't make it. we do
what any Stanford student would
do. start up our own group.
But I was not interested in
forming a squad of Dudes. In
fact. I didn't even expect to be
considered for the Dollies. I
simply wanted to make a state
ment about sexism by challeng
ing a certain non-conscious
belief: "The Dollies' squad is for
women." I read the rules, and as

John Mannion stated in his letter
(Daily. Feb. 5). any student may
audition. 1 thought that by
auditioning for the Dollies, 1
would make a few people uncom
fortable; I felt that my presence —
even in rehearsals — was a direct
challenge to sexist values.
Unfortunately. I didn't make it
to second cuts, and so, very few
people knew that I had audi
tioned (The Daily begins coverage
at second cuts). I did, however,
manage to learn a few things
along the way that deserved a lot
more attention than The Daily
gave them in last year's article on
auditions. For instance, the Band
treats the auditioners like bur
lesque showgirls. Imagine 50
half-drunk people yelling about
your breast size as you finish

your routine. Try to practice
dancing accompanied by a tape of
the Band yelling "Take off your
shirt" or "Show us your tits." I
think John Mannion's letter res
ponding to the "Guys and Dollies"
article also missed the point. It
was exactly the cocky, sexist
response one would expect from
someone secure in the knowledge
that a male would never make it
all the way through auditions —
"I hope to see some Daily editors
there." One must retain one's
image, right John? At least John
had the decency to refer to the
women as "the self
choreographed, self-governed
Dollie team," instead of what the
band usually calls them.

Perhaps John Lis should learn
not to criticize things that he
does not understand. His recent
article (Daily, Feb. 4) deriding the
America's Cup races did little
more than display his own ignor
ance about the sport of sailing.
Believe it or not. there are many
people who do enjoy watching
sailing on television because it is
an exciting and fast-paced sport.
If Lis doesn't think so. he is cer
tainly entitled to his own opinion,
but the way he expressed it was
rude and insulting to those of us
who have been following the
America's Cup races this winter.
Lis also seems to be under the

impression that the Cup races are
only a competition to see "whose
million-dollar yacht is faster."
While it is true, just as it is for
any sport, that the equipment
used should be in the best shape
possible, this hardly determines
the outcome of the race. Sailing is
a precision sport that requires
skill, strategy and — Lis' defini
tion of an athlete notwithstand
ing — a lot of hard work and
endurance.
There are those of us who will
cheer for Conner and the crew of
the Stars & Stripes when they
bring the Cup home. If Lis can't
understand our sport, the least
he could do is respect it.

fact. I didn't even expect to be
considered for the Dollies. I
simply wanted to make a state
ment about sexism by challeng
ing a certain non-conscious
belief: "The Dollies' squad is for
women." I read the rules, and as

John Mannion stated in his letter
(Daily. Feb. 5). any student may
audition. 1 thought that by
auditioning for the Dollies, 1
would make a few people uncom
fortable; I felt that my presence —
even in rehearsals — was a direct
challenge to sexist values.
Unfortunately. I didn't make it
to second cuts, and so, very few
people knew that I had audi
tioned (The Daily begins coverage
at second cuts). I did, however,
manage to learn a few things
along the way that deserved a lot
more attention than The Daily
gave them in last year's article on
auditions. For instance, the Band
treats the auditioners like bur
lesque showgirls. Imagine 50
half-drunk people yelling about
your breast size as you finish

your routine. Try to practice
dancing accompanied by a tape of
the Band yelling "Take off your
shirt" or "Show us your tits." I
think John Mannion's letter res
ponding to the "Guys and Dollies"
article also missed the point. It
was exactly the cocky, sexist
response one would expect from
someone secure in the knowledge
that a male would never make it
all the way through auditions —
"I hope to see some Daily editors
there." One must retain one's
image, right John? At least John
had the decency to refer to the
women as "the self
choreographed, self-governed
Dollie team," instead of what the
band usually calls them.

Sailing's great
Perhaps John Lis should learn
not to criticize things that he
does not understand. His recent
article (Daily, Feb. 4) deriding the
America's Cup races did little
more than display his own ignor
ance about the sport of sailing.
Believe it or not. there are many
people who do enjoy watching
sailing on television because it is
an exciting and fast-paced sport.
If Lis doesn't think so. he is cer
tainly entitled to his own opinion,
but the way he expressed it was
rude and insulting to those of us
who have been following the
America's Cup races this winter.
Lis also seems to be under the

impression that the Cup races are
only a competition to see "whose
million-dollar yacht is faster."
While it is true, just as it is for
any sport, that the equipment
used should be in the best shape
possible, this hardly determines
the outcome of the race. Sailing is
a precision sport that requires
skill, strategy and — Lis' defini
tion of an athlete notwithstand
ing — a lot of hard work and
endurance.
There are those of us who will
cheer for Conner and the crew of
the Stars & Stripes when they
bring the Cup home. If Lis can't
understand our sport, the least
he could do is respect it.

Dollie editorial
missed point
Let's Just set the record
straight, shall we? I'm the "at
least one male" who tried out for
Dollies last year. That's right, the
only male — In fact, to the best of
my knowledge, I'm the only male
who has ever tried out for the
squad as It stands now. I didn't
audition to make history; I had
another purpose in mind. I had
no intention of trying to change
the Dollies into "Dollies and
Dudes"; I wanted to play by their
rules. As my feminist friends
pointed out in their editorial
"Guys and Dollies" (Daily, Feb. 3),
"it was once inconceivable that

there would be female doctors."
This is true, but the medical
profession didn't all at once
change to accommodate women;
women became doctors by travel
ing the same routes that men had
to travel.
If men want to be on the field,
we have to do it the Dollies' way.
And if we don't make it. we do
what any Stanford student would
do. start up our own group.
But I was not interested in
forming a squad of Dudes. In
fact. I didn't even expect to be
considered for the Dollies. I
simply wanted to make a state
ment about sexism by challeng
ing a certain non-conscious
belief: "The Dollies' squad is for
women." I read the rules, and as

John Mannion stated in his letter
