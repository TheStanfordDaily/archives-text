## Outdoor sculpture: Art that pleases the public 
### 
"It's supposed to be risk-free.
"Many people (at Stanford) are very sophisticated
about science and literature, but not about art," he
continued. "They're trying to read and translate (art)
into numbers and letters, but they can't and they're
frustrated and they're lazy.
"One of the things the Stanford student is grossly
uneducated about is visual education." Elsen added,
pointing out the existence of classes, books and
campus art tours of which students can take advan
tage, but often do not.
Merryman admitted that Stanford students may
be uneducated when it comes to art. but he added
"almost everyone is ignorant." Furthermore, he said,
the overall attitude of students is "pretty good."
"One of the things which has given me the most
satisfaction is the way the art is received," he said. "A
lot of students come and talk to me about it."
Merryman mentioned that when artist Kenneth
Snelson was assembling "Mozart 1," a tribute to
Mozart in pipe and wire on the lawn behind the
Career Planning and Placement Center, students
from the School of Engineering got excited and
began to help him put it together. Bystanders gath
ered to watch.
"There was a party going on there all the time," he
said.
"People notice them (the sculptures)," one student
said. "The fountains are appreciated, especially
when it gets so dry around here."
A Shoestring Budget
"Our objective is to have the greatest collection of
outdoor sculpture of any university in America," El
sen said. "And when you look at the fact that we have
no budget for it, we're doing pretty well."
UPOA must rely on donation in order for Stanford
to obtain a new sculpture. Many times, an artist will
loan a work to the University and hope that a donor
will like the sculpture and give the University money
to buy it.
The University does pay for the maintenance of
sculptures, but with the exception of the Rodin
Sculpture Garden in back of the museum, it has
never bought any.
"There ought to be something in (the budget) for
art." Merryman said. "We need to take the visual edu
cation of the student seriously."
Although UPOA tries to bring excellent art to
campus, much of its time is spent rejecting offers. In
fact, three-fourths of the time, sculptures which are
being considered do not work out because of money
problems or conflicts of interests between the donors
and the panel, according to Elsen.
Merryman sees one of the functions of the panel as
"protecting the University against bad art."
"We turn down a lot of stuff," he added.
"We're not in a hurry to fill up spaces because we
know the kind of art we want doesn't grow on trees,"

according to Elsen. "We don't want followers, we
want leaders," he said of the artists the panel favors.
Rodin was disapproved of in his time "because
people thought he was being too intimate, that his
work was ugly and wasn't well made," Elsen said.
In spite of the problems with money and the
hassles of working through the University bureau
cracy, Stanford has a unique collection because of
"people who believe in art and people who believe in
Stanford," according to Elsen.
"We're a kind of city, people come from all over the
world to see Stanford," he said.
The Future of Outdoor Art
"We don't know where the next sculpture is com
ing from," Elsen said.
But the panel is currently trying to get the oldest
sculpture the University owns out of storage.
"The Holy Trinity," a monument to the Leland
Stanford family, was made in 1900, and the panel
has been trying since 1970 to have it removed from
storage.
"The purpose of the University is to put the stu
dent in contact with great things." Elsen said.

"There ought to be something in (the budget) for
art." Merryman said. "We need to take the visual edu
cation of the student seriously."
Although UPOA tries to bring excellent art to
campus, much of its time is spent rejecting offers. In
fact, three-fourths of the time, sculptures which are
being considered do not work out because of money
problems or conflicts of interests between the donors
and the panel, according to Elsen.
Merryman sees one of the functions of the panel as
"protecting the University against bad art."
"We turn down a lot of stuff," he added.
"We're not in a hurry to fill up spaces because we
know the kind of art we want doesn't grow on trees,"

according to Elsen. "We don't want followers, we
want leaders," he said of the artists the panel favors.
Rodin was disapproved of in his time "because
people thought he was being too intimate, that his
work was ugly and wasn't well made," Elsen said.
In spite of the problems with money and the
hassles of working through the University bureau
cracy, Stanford has a unique collection because of
"people who believe in art and people who believe in
Stanford," according to Elsen.
"We're a kind of city, people come from all over the
world to see Stanford," he said.
The Future of Outdoor Art
"We don't know where the next sculpture is com
ing from," Elsen said.
But the panel is currently trying to get the oldest
sculpture the University owns out of storage.
"The Holy Trinity," a monument to the Leland
Stanford family, was made in 1900, and the panel
has been trying since 1970 to have it removed from
storage.
"The purpose of the University is to put the stu
dent in contact with great things." Elsen said.

"The Stanford Wall" was given to the University by Josef Albers in 1973. It is located between the 9 uad
and the physics tank.
"It's supposed to be risk-free.
"Many people (at Stanford) are very sophisticated
about science and literature, but not about art," he
continued. "They're trying to read and translate (art)
into numbers and letters, but they can't and they're
frustrated and they're lazy.
"One of the things the Stanford student is grossly
uneducated about is visual education." Elsen added,
pointing out the existence of classes, books and
campus art tours of which students can take advan
tage, but often do not.
Merryman admitted that Stanford students may
be uneducated when it comes to art. but he added
"almost everyone is ignorant." Furthermore, he said,
the overall attitude of students is "pretty good."
"One of the things which has given me the most
satisfaction is the way the art is received," he said. "A
lot of students come and talk to me about it."
Merryman mentioned that when artist Kenneth
Snelson was assembling "Mozart 1," a tribute to
Mozart in pipe and wire on the lawn behind the
Career Planning and Placement Center, students
from the School of Engineering got excited and
began to help him put it together. Bystanders gath
ered to watch.
"There was a party going on there all the time," he
said.
"People notice them (the sculptures)," one student
said. "The fountains are appreciated, especially
when it gets so dry around here."
A Shoestring Budget
"Our objective is to have the greatest collection of
outdoor sculpture of any university in America," El
sen said. "And when you look at the fact that we have
no budget for it, we're doing pretty well."
UPOA must rely on donation in order for Stanford
to obtain a new sculpture. Many times, an artist will
loan a work to the University and hope that a donor
will like the sculpture and give the University money
to buy it.
The University does pay for the maintenance of
sculptures, but with the exception of the Rodin
Sculpture Garden in back of the museum, it has
never bought any.
"There ought to be something in (the budget) for
art." Merryman said. "We need to take the visual edu
cation of the student seriously."
