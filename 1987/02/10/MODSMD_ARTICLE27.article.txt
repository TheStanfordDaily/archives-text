# Bug goes to dogs over evolution of Goofy
## 
### KATHRYN VER PLOEG 
Hello there.
Just a reminder — your ques
tions are still being eagerly
awaited care of Bug Me. The Stan
ford Daily, Storke Student
Publications Building. Stanford.
Calif., 94305 and through LOTS
rnail at "BUG-ME."
As Ed McMahon once said. "You
can't win if you don't enter."
Pear Bug Me:
A couple of weeks ago, my
friends and I went to the Flicks
and saw a movie that brought up
an Important intellectual di
lemma. We have spent endless
hours discussing the haunting
question the movie posed, but
have reached no conclusions.
Perhaps you. in your infinite wis
dom. can shed some light upon
the subject. The movie was
"Stand By Me" and the question
is "What is Goofy, anyway?" In-

Yes. everyone. Goofy is a dog.
But we do understand the confu
sion. As Paula Sigmen, a profes
sional archivist for Disney
Studios, put it: "Goofy is probably
less dog-like than Mickey is
mouse-like and Donald is duck
like." Debuting in the 1932 car
toon "Mickey's Revue," his
original name was Dippy Dawg.

which gradually evolved Into
Dippy the Goof and has rested at
Goofy.
Pluto, on the other hand,
debuted in the 1930 cartoon "The
Chain Gang" as "just a regular
dog dog." That's the way it goes
sometimes. As the nice fellow ten
ding office while all the full-fledged
Disney publicists were out to
lunch said, "Mickey needed a dog
to take hunting, sorta like Elmer
Fudd." But Pluto did indeed speak
once. While lying limply in
Mickey's arms after a near-death
experience. Pluto suddenly
opened his eyes to Mickey and
said, "Kiss me."
Dear Bug Me:
Being mildly curious, I'm won
dering how many bike accidents
the Stanford campus has per
year. It seems like everyone's
had at least one so Jar. How
many can the average person ex
pect to be in during their time

here? Will we get killed or what?
Also, who puts up all those
posters telling us to stop, use a
light, etc.?
- Wondering
The Bicycle Safety Committee, a
group of students, faculty and
staff that works in cooperation
with the Planning Office and the
Stanford Police Department, is re
sponsible for both the posters and
explanations for the accident
tallies. Its coordinator. Margaret
Wang, wouldn't give an exact
number of yearly accidents be
cause she guesses only a fourth or
fifth of all wrecks actually get re
ported.
"Nobody knows for sure about
the total; it's at least in the
thousands." Wang said, adding
that, "you can't escape without
getting very, very, very close to two
or three, depending on how
defensively you ride. Just about
everybody is going to have an acci

dent, whether it's their fault or
not."
This year's injuries have ranged
from simple scrapes tc broken col
larbones and skull fr? ctures.
But there is some hope. Be care
ful when crossing ihe highest ac
cident areas: White Plaza and the
corner between the Clock Tower
and the Quad. Be careful when
you first arrive at Stanford —
most of the major accidents
during the first two months of the
school year involve freshmen. And
just plain be careful, says Wang.
"You can prevent most of these
accidents if you'd just pay atten
tion."
Dear Bug Me:
What makes virgin wool
"virgin?" Also, what makes virgin
vinyl "virgin?" Wouldn't it be
rather hard to tell?
- Dr. Ruth
Noah Webster defines "virgin"
as. among other things, "untrod."

A 1 Barghinl of Golden Gate
Textiles tells us that untrod wool
is wool that has never been a part
of any garment before the one it's
in right now. Long ago. when
frugality reigned and it was much
more common to tear apart old
clothing threads for reweaving
into new fabric, the phrase "virgin
wool" carried much more impor
tance. Now. since almost all wool
is virgin, Barghinl explains that
the phrase is used "to convey the
idea that it's 100 percent wool, not
a 50/50 mix."
Initially calling virgin vinyl "an
absolute misnomer." he eventu
ally decided that it was probably
vinyl in its first application.
This brings up questions of
extra-virgin olive oil; if it's already
virgin, how could it get more vir
gin? A local olive oil broker. Tosi
Trading Company, lets us know
that it's a matter of pressing. It
seems that olive oil is a rare thing
that gets more virgin the more it
gets trod.


quiring minds want to know!

had at least one so Jar. How
many can the average person ex
pect to be in during their time

here? Will we get killed or what?
Also, who puts up all those
posters telling us to stop, use a
light, etc.?
- Wondering
The Bicycle Safety Committee, a
group of students, faculty and
staff that works in cooperation
with the Planning Office and the
Stanford Police Department, is re
sponsible for both the posters and
explanations for the accident
tallies. Its coordinator. Margaret
Wang, wouldn't give an exact
number of yearly accidents be
cause she guesses only a fourth or
fifth of all wrecks actually get re
ported.
"Nobody knows for sure about
the total; it's at least in the
thousands." Wang said, adding
that, "you can't escape without
getting very, very, very close to two
or three, depending on how
defensively you ride. Just about
everybody is going to have an acci

dent, whether it's their fault or
not."
This year's injuries have ranged
from simple scrapes tc broken col
larbones and skull fr? ctures.
But there is some hope. Be care
ful when crossing ihe highest ac
cident areas: White Plaza and the
corner between the Clock Tower
and the Quad. Be careful when
you first arrive at Stanford —
most of the major accidents
during the first two months of the
school year involve freshmen. And
just plain be careful, says Wang.
"You can prevent most of these
accidents if you'd just pay atten
tion."
Dear Bug Me:
What makes virgin wool
"virgin?" Also, what makes virgin
vinyl "virgin?" Wouldn't it be
rather hard to tell?
- Dr. Ruth
Noah Webster defines "virgin"
as. among other things, "untrod."

A 1 Barghinl of Golden Gate
Textiles tells us that untrod wool
is wool that has never been a part
of any garment before the one it's
in right now. Long ago. when
frugality reigned and it was much
more common to tear apart old
clothing threads for reweaving
into new fabric, the phrase "virgin
wool" carried much more impor
tance. Now. since almost all wool
is virgin, Barghinl explains that
the phrase is used "to convey the
idea that it's 100 percent wool, not
a 50/50 mix."
Initially calling virgin vinyl "an
absolute misnomer." he eventu
ally decided that it was probably
vinyl in its first application.
This brings up questions of
extra-virgin olive oil; if it's already
virgin, how could it get more vir
gin? A local olive oil broker. Tosi
Trading Company, lets us know
that it's a matter of pressing. It
seems that olive oil is a rare thing
that gets more virgin the more it
gets trod.

Hello there.
Just a reminder — your ques
tions are still being eagerly
awaited care of Bug Me. The Stan
ford Daily, Storke Student
Publications Building. Stanford.

rnail at "BUG-ME."
As Ed McMahon once said. "You
can't win if you don't enter."
Pear Bug Me:
A couple of weeks ago, my
friends and I went to the Flicks
and saw a movie that brought up
an Important intellectual di
lemma. We have spent endless
hours discussing the haunting
question the movie posed, but
have reached no conclusions.
Perhaps you. in your infinite wis
dom. can shed some light upon
the subject. The movie was
"Stand By Me" and the question
is "What is Goofy, anyway?" In-

Yes. everyone. Goofy is a dog.
But we do understand the confu
sion. As Paula Sigmen, a profes
sional archivist for Disney
Studios, put it: "Goofy is probably
less dog-like than Mickey is
mouse-like and Donald is duck
like." Debuting in the 1932 car
toon "Mickey's Revue," his
original name was Dippy Dawg.

which gradually evolved Into
Dippy the Goof and has rested at
Goofy.
Pluto, on the other hand,
debuted in the 1930 cartoon "The
Chain Gang" as "just a regular
dog dog." That's the way it goes
sometimes. As the nice fellow ten
ding office while all the full-fledged
Disney publicists were out to
lunch said, "Mickey needed a dog
to take hunting, sorta like Elmer
Fudd." But Pluto did indeed speak
once. While lying limply in
Mickey's arms after a near-death
experience. Pluto suddenly
opened his eyes to Mickey and
said, "Kiss me."
Dear Bug Me:
