## Blue, McDermott lead sweep of Hawaii 
### ALICIA KENT Staff writer 
The conquering attitude of the Stan
ford men's volleyball team continued last
night as the Cardinal overpowered Hawaii
18-16, 15-9, 15-7 at Maples Pavilion.
Stanford, ranked No. 8 in the nation,
now has an 11-4 overall record and is 2-1
in the Western Intercollegiate Volleyball
Association.
In a long, hard fight for the first game,
Stanford was able to finally dominate the
scoreboard after 45 minutes of game
time. Although the Rainbows' .274 hit
ting percentage after the first game ap
peared better than the Cardinal's .200,

Stanford was able to make the final, ne
cessary effort at 16-16 with John McDer
mott serving and Stephen Blue scoring
the two winning points.
Hawaii Coach Alan Rosehill noticed
that the tone for the match was set after
the first game. "We were not up to our ca
pability. The first game was the key game
â€” it could have gone either way. And we
never really recovered." Rosehill said.

Hawaii and playing with four new fresh
men whose first conference match was
last night. No. 9 ranked Hawaii was not
able to execute well against the strong
passing and hitting of Stanford.

the spikers were able to maintain their
energy for the second game, dominating
play for the first four points. The Rain
bows never had the chance to take the
lead, although they were able to hold off
defeat for 35 minutes.
Again Blue, the senior outside hitter
who dominated the match with 21 kills,
scored the winning point. "Blue has been
playing very well." Stanford Coach Fred
Sturm said. Not only was Blue's offensive
game strong, but he also recorded 17
digs, the most of any player in the match.
The final game of the night clearly
belonged to Stanford, as it beat Hawaii in
25 minutes with a .432 percentage to
Hawaii's .333.

Senior outside hitter McDermott estab
lished a high percentage of .500 for the
three games and played very well, accord
ing to Sturm. McDermott's dinking abil
ity and six digs scored several key points
for the Cardinal.
"1 was trying to mix them up and it
worked most of the time." said McDer
mott, who is from Honolulu. Hawaii. "It
was the best game we played this year. We
focused on siding out, hoping that there
would be no way they could score points
on us."
Saturday's 15-6, 15-6 win at the
UCLA/Reebok Volleyball Classic against
No. 3 ranked Pepperdine helped prepare
Stanford for last night's match. "We were

feeling good after Pepperdine, really confi
dent," said Robert Peterson, a 6-foot-6
outside hitter who scored four blocks and
posted 12 digs. "We made a solid effort.
Our intensity was high: we were in the
match the whole time."
The difference in last night's match was
the experience of the two teams. Ironi
cally. inexperience has been the Card
inal's problem, with six veteran players
and six first-year players. But tonight it
was the Rainbows who felt the lack of
team unity. "We were making a lot of er
rors (30) because we don't have the exper
ience of playing together." said Hawaii

At the start of the season. Stan
ford lacked a starting lineup. The
spikers did not have the match
time to feel like a team unit, al
though they knew that they had
the potential to become a threat
ening team. The team has been
improving with each match it has
played.
Last night, however, it was the
Rainbows who needed the experi
ence of playing time in order to
improve. "It will take a little time
for us to reach our potential,"
Rodgers said.

Rosehill was not surprised that
Stanford won. "I saw them at
UCLA. They are a good team, a big
force," he said.
Setting for Stanford was fresh
man Parker Blackman, who has
been the spikers' starting setter
the last five matches. "It feels good
to be starting because the guys are
really supportive. They've been
playing well, which keeps the
pressure off me," Blackman said.
The pressure will return for the
Cardinal Wednesday at 7:30 p.m.
at Maples when Stanford will
again host the Rainbows. Stan
ford will try to repeat last night's
performance and Hawaii will try to
establish a better team consis
tency.
