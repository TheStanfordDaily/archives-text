# Netters away from home for first time in '87
## UOP hosts Card women 
### KEN STEVENS Editorial staff 
Last year's scheduled women's
tennis match between Stanford
and the University of the Pacific
was rained out twice before It was
finally cancelled. Unless an unex
pected storm hits Stockton today,
the Tigers will have no such luck
this year.
No. 1 ranked Stanford may be
without Its ace, Patty Fendick, In
today's 1.30 p.m. match at UOP,
but the Cardinal still should have
little trouble Increasing Its 1987
record to 3-0.
Indicating that UOP is "the
third best Northern California
school," Stanford Coach Frank
Brennan said that the Tigers
could give the Cardinal a tough
match. "They're pretty good." he
said. "They're probably going to be
like Irvine."
If UOP is like Irvine, however,
then they're probably going to be
smashed by Stanford. The Ant
eaters were 8-1 losers Friday at the
Varsity Tennis Courts.
In all likelihood, the Cardinal
will field a new lineup for the third
time in as many matches this
season. Fendick, who notched her
30th consecutive collegiate singles
victory Friday against Irvine's
Stephanie Rhorer, is playing in
both the singles and doubles
draws of this week's Virginia
Slims professional tournament in
San Francisco.
Even though Fendick was
eliminated last night from the
singles 4-6, 7-5, 6-0 by second
seeded Kathy Rinaldi, she is still
in the Virginia Slims doubles with
Caryn Copeland — who is Bren
nan's assistant — and probably
will not make the trip with the
Cardinal today.

The absence of Fendick would
result in senior Stephanie Savides
moving up to No. 1 singles.
Savides was not in the Stanford
lineup against Irvine, because she
was at the Rolex National Indoor
Intercollegiate in Richmond, Va.,
where she lost in the first round of
singles to second-seeded Ronni
Reis of Miami, 7-5, 6-2.
The No. 2 through 6 spots in the
lineup would be filled, in order, by
junior Kay Tittle, freshman Lisa
Green, junior Cari Hagey. fresh
man Valerie Wilson and sopho
more Cindy Buchsbaum.
The No. 2 and 3 doubles teams
of Tittle-Green and Hagey-Wilson
will remain intact today. If Fen
dick makes the trip, she will team
with Savides at No. 1.
