# Vote imminent in tenure case
## 
### CHRIS MYERS Editorial staff 
The History Department will
likely vote tomorrow for a second
time on whether to grant tenure to
Asst. History Prof. Stephen Fer
ruolo, according to a history pro
fessor who asked not to be identi
fied.
The vote will cap a tenure evalu
ation process which has lasted
over a year for Ferruolo, an expert
on medieval history. Ferruolo was
denied tenure in a vote by the His
tory Deptartment last January. He
subsequently appealed the deci
sion, charging that he had been
treated "unfairly and dis
criminatorily" in the ruling.
Last August, a grievance officer
granted Ferruolo a rehearing and
the three-member tenure review
committee assigned to Ferruolo's
case presented its recommenda
tion to the History Department at
a meeting last Wednesday. Tomor
row's vote will bring the reevalua
tion process to a close, although

final tenure approval would go to
Dean of Humanities and Sciences
Norman Wessells for his decision.
Ferruolo said he will greet the
end of the proceedings with relief.
"It's very hard to go through this
process once," he said. "To have to
go through it twice Is excruciat
ing."
Despite the unusual circum
stances, the Ferruolo delibera
tions have not been receiving
undue attention within the de
partment, according to Prof.
James Sheehan, chairman of the
History Department.
"Each of these (tenure delibera
tions) is dealt with very carefully,"
Sheehan said. "1 don't think this
one is any more or less intensive."
Ferruolo's case became contro
versial because of confusion about
the criteria used to evaluate his
candidacy before the first vote last
January.
Individual departments vote
tenure recommendations based
upon consideration of a candi
date's scholarly achievement and
student appraisal of the candi
date's teaching skill.
Tenure criteria outlined in the
1984 Faculty Handbook mandate
that a candidate's work be
compared to leading scholars of
comparable age and position in
the candidate's field.
In April 1985, Wessells issued a
memorandum altering the criteria
for evaluation of a candidate's
scholarship. The new criteria re
quire that a candidate "must
show equivalent potential, if not
equivalent accomplishment, to
those who are setting the stand
ards of the field, regardless of age.
Tenured promotions are given to
those . . . scholars who have
shown that they have the capacity

to change the character and ex
pand the paradigms of their disci
plines."
Ferruolo was the first history
professor to be evaluated accord
ing to the new guidelines. He said
he was not aware until after he
was denied tenure that he had
been evaluated according to the
new criteria.
Political Science Prof. Emeritus
Gabriel Almond, the grievance of
ficer who reviewed Ferruolo's ap
peal. found that the new rules had
been improperly applied when the
tenure review committee
evaluated Ferruolo.
Almond ruled that Wessell s
guidelines — ostensibly a
clarification of existing tenure
rules — amounted to a sub
stantive change in review policy.
Almond's ruling also stated that
although the University has the
right to change its standards, the
changes must be explained clearly
and applied consistently. The af

fected faculty member must also
be given a chance to comply. None
of these conditions were met in
Ferruolo's case, Ferruolo said in
August.
"Almond found the criteria were
new and had been applied more
stringently in my case." Ferruolo
said. "He said Stanford has the
right to change its criteria, but I
wasn't given sufficient notice."
In addition, Almond ruled that
the tenure review committee had
failed to solicit letters from Stan
ford medieval scholars in other de
partments, a procedure required
by University guidelines.
After the August grievance deci
sion, a new tenure evaluation
committee was organized, and a
new letter consistent with the
older 1984 guidelines was drawn
up. according to History Prof.
Gavin Langmuir, a member of the
three-person tenure review com
mittee
The second set of letters was

"sent to a different set of outside
scholars," Langmuir said.
Although Ferruolo has heard
"really nothing at all" about the
progress of the rehearing, he said
he is satisfied with the revalua
tion process.
"As far as I know, the procedure
outlined in the grievance decision
has been followed," he said. "I un
derstand that medievalists at
Stanford have been solicited."
"It's treated as the first time
around." he said. "There's a whole
new set of evidence, a whole new
set of letters. The hope is that
people can evaluate that new ma
terial and vote on it freshly."
Before the first vote on Fer
ruolo's tenure last January, the
tenure review committee pre
sented a unanimous recommen
dation supporting Ferruolo's can
didacy. The subsequent vote to
deny him tenure was "very close."
according to Ferruolo.
