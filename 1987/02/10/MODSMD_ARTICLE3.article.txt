# Vote imminent in tenure case
## 
### CHRIS MYERS Editorial staff 
The History Department will
likely vote tomorrow for a second
time on whether to grant tenure to
Asst. History Prof. Stephen Fer
ruolo, according to a history pro
fessor who asked not to be identi
fied.
The vote will cap a tenure evalu
ation process which has lasted
over a year for Ferruolo, an expert
on medieval history. Ferruolo was
denied tenure in a vote by the His
tory Deptartment last January. He
subsequently appealed the deci
sion, charging that he had been
treated "unfairly and dis
criminatorily" in the ruling.
Last August, a grievance officer
granted Ferruolo a rehearing and
the three-member tenure review
committee assigned to Ferruolo's
case presented its recommenda
tion to the History Department at
a meeting last Wednesday. Tomor
row's vote will bring the reevalua
tion process to a close, although

final tenure approval would go to
Dean of Humanities and Sciences
Norman Wessells for his decision.
Ferruolo said he will greet the
end of the proceedings with relief.
"It's very hard to go through this
process once," he said. "To have to
go through it twice Is excruciat
ing."
Despite the unusual circum
stances, the Ferruolo delibera
tions have not been receiving
undue attention within the de
partment, according to Prof.
James Sheehan, chairman of the
History Department.
"Each of these (tenure delibera
tions) is dealt with very carefully,"
Sheehan said. "1 don't think this
one is any more or less intensive."
Ferruolo's case became contro
versial because of confusion about
the criteria used to evaluate his
candidacy before the first vote last
January.
