# Stanford without McEnroe at SJSU
## 
### JON WEISMAN Staff writer 
Stanford's Patrick McEnroe, ranked third in men's
collegiate tennis, will miss his second straight match
at 2 p.m. today when the Stanford men's tennis team
travels to San Jose State for its first road contest of
the season.
McEnroe has had bruises on the bottoms of his
feet the entire season, and he reaggravated them last
weekend in a tournament in Richmond. Va. Stan
ford Coach Dick Gould decided that it was important
to rest McEnroe so that he can get well for the 2-1
Cardinal's most important tournament this month,
the National Team Indoors, held Feb. 19-22 in Louis
ville. Ky.
McEnroe lost 6-1.6-1 to 34th-ranked Billy Uribe of
Louisiana State in the Rolex National Indoor Inter
collegiate Tennis Championships Thursday.
However. Stanford Asst. Coach John Whitlinger did
not cite the bruises on McEnroe's feet as the reason
for the loss.
"He just had a bad day." Whitlinger said. "He was
competing and trying very hard, but it was just one
of those days that he couldn't put anything together.
"The guy (Uribe) played pretty well and never let
Patrick in the match," Whitlinger added. "I felt that if
Patrick could have gotten a break here or there, the
match, even though it was 6-1. 6-1, could have
swung around.
"Patrick would never want to have his feet as an
excuse." Whitlinger said. "I mean, they're not good
and hopefully they get better, but it really wasn't a

factor in the match."
Still, McEnroe will again be
replaced in the No. 1 position by
Jeff Tarango, who is a freshman
but has defeated four top-50 oppo
nents since September. Tarango
is 3-0 in 1987, having defeated
Rollins College's Pat Emmet in his
debut at the top, 3-6, 6-2, 7-6 (7-
5).
"I was nervous against Rollins
in the beginning." Tarango said.
Tarango feels the responsibility
of assuming the top position on
the defending-national champion
team.
"When I came here I was hoping
to play in the top three," he said.

"I've been working my way up.
"It's really neat to be playing No.
1 for the best school in the na
tion," Tarango said. "I haven't
really stopped to think about
it. ... I hope that I can just repre
sent my school well and do my
best."
Gould has also shaken up the
doubles combinations in hope
that different combinations will
bring different results. So far this
season, Stanford has lost five of
seven doubles matches.
Scott Moody, who in the past
has played doubles with McEnroe
and last week played with Geordie
McKee, will play with Tarango.
Freshmen Jeff Cathrall and Eric
Peus will also team up, followed by
Curtis Dunn and McKee.
