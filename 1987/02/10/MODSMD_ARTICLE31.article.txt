What goes up. must come down. That des
cribed Stanford Fencing Coach Buzz Hurst's
feelings on Saturday as he watched his
women's team defeat UC-Santa Cruz 9-7. then
saw his men fall to the Banana Slugs 18-9.
With only one match remaining, at Califor
nia Feb. 21. the women are now 11-3. while
the men dropped to 7-8.
In beating Santa Cruz, the women put on
"their guttiest performance of the season." ac
cording to Hurst. "Santa Cruz is our strongest
competition (in the Western region)." he said.
With the regional championships less than
three weeks away. Saturday s win provided an
Important psychological boost for the women's
team.
The women were led by captain Holly Taylor,
who went 4-0 to run her win streak to 23
straight bouts. The senior is now 47-5 on the
year, and is considered the strongest fencer in
the West, especially after beating Banana Slug
Suzanne Lahara. five touches to two.
Lahara Is probably the No. 2 fencer in the
region, but she was no match for Taylor. In
fact, after two quick touches were scored on
her at the start of her first bout. Taylor re
corded 20 touches of her own. interrupted only
by the two scores by Lahara.
Senior Alyson Yarus also turned In a fine
performance for the Cardinal as she peaks
toward reglonals. going 3-1. "In all the bouts I

won. I was fencing better than I have been all
year," she said.
Hurst echoed her comments. "Alyson Yarus
was magnificent today," he said.
Also fencing well for the Cardinal was
Alexandra Rankin, who went 2-2. The senior is
coming back from a hamstring Injury, but,
with the match tied 6-6, turned In a big win.
The bout was tied at four. Then, after what
seemed like an hour. Rankin finally scored the
last touch to put Stanford in the lead.
"The Idea of getting into a sudden death sit
uation. a beginner versus an experienced fen
cer. and the beginner pulls it out. says a lot
about character." Hurst said.
After Rankin's clutch victory and freshman
Elisabeth Spilman's tough 5-4 loss to Lahara,
It was Yarus' turn. Knowing that both she and
Taylor needed wins to avoid a 8-8 tie. Stan
ford's No. 2 beat Santa Cruz' No. 2. Laurel Wil
son. by a 5-2 score.
"I don't mind that kind of pressure." Yarus
said. "I felt better in knowing I had to win it."
Then it was once again Taylor's show. She
came out and won her match in under 30
seconds fencing time, making five attacks,
scoring five clean hits and avoiding a single
touch.
"Holly once again did an outstanding job."
said Hurst. "She just dominated her bouts.
There was never any doubt as to who was
going to win."
There was a lot of doubt about the men.
though, as they came in with more than half

Iheir fencers in their first year of competition.
Despite their falling under .500 again. Hurst
was not too displeased. "This is the hardest
schedule we've ever fenced," he said. "If we
come out .500, I'll he happy with them. Not ec
static. but happy."
The sabre team, as always, led the way. pos
ting a 7-2 record. Senior co-captain Steve
Levitan went 3-0 to run his win streak to 29
bouts, while juniors Mike Cramer and David
Fishman were both 2-1. Levitan is now 39-4 on
the year, and his .907 winning percentage is
the best on the squad.
Hurst was most impressed with Fishman.
his No. 3 man. "I'm more than satisfied with
his 2-1 record." he said.
The epee team went 2-7. with the other
senior co-captain. Larry Murk, going 2-1, and
two novices, sophomores Lee Tankersley and
Steve Schmidt, coming close but each finish
ing 0-3. A big reason was the success of
Banana Slug Brvn Kanar. whose unorthodox
style was effective enough to give him a perfect
3-0 mark on the day.
The foil team lost bv a 9-0 score, but at least
there was a silver lining to the cloud. "UCSC
has the best foil team in the West." said Hurst.
"Our guys fenced much better against them
than they did the time before."
Despite the 18-9 defeat. Hurst was
philosophical. "I would like to have beaten
Santa Cruz. But I can't say I really expected to
beat them. Even in defeat there were some
good points."
