# Munk aiming for starting position
## 
### KENNETH FENYO Editorial staff 
When he was still a high
school student. Chris Munk
had the goal of playing one day
at Maples Pavilion. He had
assumed, however, he would be
wearing white and cardinal and
not the maroon and gold of
use.
Sunday, in his first game at
Stanford against the Cardinal.
Munk showed the flashes of
dominance that last year made
him a Parade Magazine High
School All-American and
former Stanford Coach Tom
Davis' highest recruiting
priority.
Munk is perhaps Stanford's
most publicized athletic recruit
not to be admitted to the Uni
versity. The Office of Admis
sions decision last March 21 to
deny entrance to the 6-foot-9
power forward could have been
a catalyst in Davis' decision to

leave Stanford. Davis is now
the coach at lowa.
While he said he was not bit
ter toward Stanford. Munk did
say that he felt an "added moti
vation" to do well against the
Cardinal. "I came up (to the Bay
Area) with a lot of emotion. . . .
I really wanted to play hard."
Munk said.
That extra emotion helped
him to one of his best games of
the season in the 72-57 Trojan
loss. In 22 minutes against
Stanford, the freshman scored
seven points, pulled down five
rebounds (two offensive) and
blocked a shot. Munk had been
averaging 3.2 points and 2.9
boards per game.
"Things were really falling
tonight. . . . My offensive game
came around a bit more. I felt a
lot more relaxed and comforta
ble on the floor," he said.
