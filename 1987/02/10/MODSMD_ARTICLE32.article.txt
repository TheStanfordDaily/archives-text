# Munk aiming for starting position
## 
### KENNETH FENYO Editorial staff 
When he was still a high
school student. Chris Munk
had the goal of playing one day
at Maples Pavilion. He had
assumed, however, he would be
wearing white and cardinal and
not the maroon and gold of
use.
Sunday, in his first game at
Stanford against the Cardinal.
Munk showed the flashes of
dominance that last year made
him a Parade Magazine High
School All-American and
former Stanford Coach Tom
Davis' highest recruiting
priority.
Munk is perhaps Stanford's
most publicized athletic recruit
not to be admitted to the Uni
versity. The Office of Admis
sions decision last March 21 to
deny entrance to the 6-foot-9
power forward could have been
a catalyst in Davis' decision to

leave Stanford. Davis is now
the coach at lowa.
While he said he was not bit
ter toward Stanford. Munk did
say that he felt an "added moti
vation" to do well against the
Cardinal. "I came up (to the Bay
Area) with a lot of emotion. . . .
I really wanted to play hard."
Munk said.
That extra emotion helped
him to one of his best games of
the season in the 72-57 Trojan
loss. In 22 minutes against
Stanford, the freshman scored
seven points, pulled down five
rebounds (two offensive) and
blocked a shot. Munk had been
averaging 3.2 points and 2.9
boards per game.
"Things were really falling
tonight. . . . My offensive game
came around a bit more. I felt a
lot more relaxed and comforta
ble on the floor," he said.
Munk said he gained "a lot of
confidence from (Sunday's) game.
Hopefully, this will be a catalyst
for the games ahead."
Munk had been a special project
for Davis. The Stanford basketball
staff had been working with Munk
since his sophomore year at Rior
dan High School in San Fran
cisco. Under Davis' guidance,
Munk strengthened his curricu
lum and raised his grade point
average to 3.0. He also took the
Scholastic Apptitude Test four
times.
Davis was greatly disappointed
by the decision not to admit Munk
— considered by some scouts to be
the No. 8 high school prospect in
the country last year. "I feel the
decision is Stanford's loss," Davis
said at the time.
However, Davis denied that
Munk's rejection initiated his
search for a new head coaching
job. "We all understand the diffi
culty of that (the Munk) decision,"
he told The Daily last April. "I
respect the job the admissions
people have done."
Stanford Coach Mike
Montgomery refused to speculate
on what would have happened if
Munk had attended the Univer
sity. "He seems like a nice kid with
good physical ability. . . . But for
me to speculate on (what if) is not
in the cards," Montgomery said.
Montgomery said the decision
not to accept Munk into the Uni
versity will have an adverse effect
on recruiting. "How can it not
hurt recruiting when the pool of
prospects is smaller?" he said.
According to Montgomery,
however, Stanford "didn't hire me
with the idea" that athletes who
did not meet admissions stand
ards would be granted entrance.
"There will be frustrations along
the way for someone who can't get
in, but that's just the way it is,"
Montgomery said.
"I couldn't be happier with my
relationship" with the Admissions

Office, said Montgomery. "1 think
they're excellent. They are very
supportive."
This season has been a learning
experience for Munk. according to
the freshman and his coaches.
"I've put great stress on . . . per
spective and tactics. I've learned a
lot," Munk said.
"The more he learns and
progresses, he is really going to
start being one of the dominant
players on the West Coast." USC
Asst. Coach Glenn Mars said.
Mars added that Munk has dis
played "steady improvement
everytime he plays."
So far this season, Munk has
been a defensive specialist. "I look
to the defense more," he said. "My
best contribution is on defense.
That is what I key on."
According to USC Coach George
Raveling. "Given time, he could be
a great basketball player. He really
hits the boards. He has the chance
to be a great defensive player. He
could be one of the best defensive
players I've ever coached."
Eric Reveno, who battled with
Munk for much of the afternoon,
said, "I've known Chris for a
while. He's a really nice guy, but
he's a bear on the court. He's really
strong. He's got quick feet and
he's always moving. Chris has got
a lot of potential. He can improve
on a lot of things, but he's a great
athlete."
The game against Stanford also
displayed Munk's strong offensive
potential, as his several power
moves to the basket resulted
either in a basket or foul. Munk
said that he is finally developing
"a feel for the offense." He said he
is now "playing and not thinking.
Earlier in the season. I was think
ing too much."
Although his role so far this
season has been that of a reserve,
Munk hopes to crack the starting
lineup by year's end. Munk said he
was going to "keep stabbing away,
playing great defense," until he
becomes a starter. However, Munk
said, "If offense is what is needed
to break the starting lineup, I will
do it."

job. "We all understand the diffi
culty of that (the Munk) decision,"
he told The Daily last April. "I
respect the job the admissions
people have done."
Stanford Coach Mike
Montgomery refused to speculate
on what would have happened if
Munk had attended the Univer
sity. "He seems like a nice kid with
good physical ability. . . . But for
me to speculate on (what if) is not
in the cards," Montgomery said.
Montgomery said the decision
not to accept Munk into the Uni
versity will have an adverse effect
on recruiting. "How can it not
hurt recruiting when the pool of
prospects is smaller?" he said.
According to Montgomery,
however, Stanford "didn't hire me
with the idea" that athletes who
did not meet admissions stand
ards would be granted entrance.
"There will be frustrations along
the way for someone who can't get
in, but that's just the way it is,"
Montgomery said.
"I couldn't be happier with my
relationship" with the Admissions

Office, said Montgomery. "1 think
they're excellent. They are very
supportive."
This season has been a learning
experience for Munk. according to
the freshman and his coaches.
"I've put great stress on . . . per
spective and tactics. I've learned a
lot," Munk said.
"The more he learns and
progresses, he is really going to
start being one of the dominant
players on the West Coast." USC
Asst. Coach Glenn Mars said.
Mars added that Munk has dis
played "steady improvement
everytime he plays."
So far this season, Munk has
been a defensive specialist. "I look
to the defense more," he said. "My
best contribution is on defense.
That is what I key on."
According to USC Coach George
Raveling. "Given time, he could be
a great basketball player. He really
hits the boards. He has the chance
to be a great defensive player. He
could be one of the best defensive
players I've ever coached."
Eric Reveno, who battled with
Munk for much of the afternoon,
said, "I've known Chris for a
while. He's a really nice guy, but
he's a bear on the court. He's really
strong. He's got quick feet and
he's always moving. Chris has got
a lot of potential. He can improve
on a lot of things, but he's a great
athlete."
The game against Stanford also
displayed Munk's strong offensive
potential, as his several power
moves to the basket resulted
either in a basket or foul. Munk
said that he is finally developing
"a feel for the offense." He said he
is now "playing and not thinking.
Earlier in the season. I was think
ing too much."
Although his role so far this
season has been that of a reserve,
Munk hopes to crack the starting
lineup by year's end. Munk said he
was going to "keep stabbing away,
playing great defense," until he
becomes a starter. However, Munk
said, "If offense is what is needed
to break the starting lineup, I will
do it."

Noted for his strong inside game, Chris Munk was Stanford's top high school recruit
last season. Munk, who was not admitted to Stanford, made his debut at Maples
Pavilion Sunday as a member of the USC Trojans.
When he was still a high
school student. Chris Munk
had the goal of playing one day
at Maples Pavilion. He had
assumed, however, he would be
wearing white and cardinal and
not the maroon and gold of
use.
Sunday, in his first game at
Stanford against the Cardinal.
Munk showed the flashes of
dominance that last year made
him a Parade Magazine High
School All-American and
former Stanford Coach Tom
Davis' highest recruiting
priority.
Munk is perhaps Stanford's
most publicized athletic recruit
not to be admitted to the Uni
versity. The Office of Admis
sions decision last March 21 to
deny entrance to the 6-foot-9
power forward could have been
a catalyst in Davis' decision to

leave Stanford. Davis is now
the coach at lowa.
While he said he was not bit
ter toward Stanford. Munk did
say that he felt an "added moti
vation" to do well against the
Cardinal. "I came up (to the Bay
Area) with a lot of emotion. . . .
I really wanted to play hard."
Munk said.
That extra emotion helped
him to one of his best games of
the season in the 72-57 Trojan
loss. In 22 minutes against
Stanford, the freshman scored
seven points, pulled down five
rebounds (two offensive) and
blocked a shot. Munk had been
averaging 3.2 points and 2.9
boards per game.
"Things were really falling
tonight. . . . My offensive game
came around a bit more. I felt a
lot more relaxed and comforta
ble on the floor," he said.
Munk said he gained "a lot of
confidence from (Sunday's) game.
Hopefully, this will be a catalyst
for the games ahead."
Munk had been a special project
for Davis. The Stanford basketball
staff had been working with Munk
since his sophomore year at Rior
dan High School in San Fran
cisco. Under Davis' guidance,
Munk strengthened his curricu
lum and raised his grade point
average to 3.0. He also took the
Scholastic Apptitude Test four
times.
Davis was greatly disappointed
by the decision not to admit Munk
— considered by some scouts to be
the No. 8 high school prospect in
the country last year. "I feel the
decision is Stanford's loss," Davis
said at the time.
However, Davis denied that
Munk's rejection initiated his
search for a new head coaching
job. "We all understand the diffi

he told The Daily last April. "I
