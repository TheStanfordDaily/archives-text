A lack of riders compounded by a string of bad luck
made the Stanford cycling team's first race of the
1987 season Saturday at UC-lrvine a less than
memorable occasion.
Just over half of the Stanford team attended the
early-season race, with many riders electing to con
tinue their training schedule until the regular
season opener in early March.
The C race started a few minutes after 9 a.m.. and
after the very first lap the troubles had already begun
for Stanford. John Shinn and Bob Pratt, both in
their first race, crashed in the S-turn. Both failed to
regain their position and were lapped after six and
10 circuits, respectively.
Still. John Lengal's second-place sprint brought
Stanford its first points of the year.
In the B race, a crash once again marred the
results. Stanford's Brock Laporte fell on the lap
before the first preem and was unable to recover his
position.
Scott Evans and Hank Dart rode well, however,
and with additional support Stanford could have
won the race. Dart took seventh place, and Evans
finished just behind in 10th.
The Cardinal's bad luck continued in the final race
of the day. After only two laps of the A race, a Cal
Poly-San Luis Obispo rider crashed on the hill taking
all four Stanford riders down with him. The rest of
the team worked in a frenzy to get captain Bob Bor
chers, last year's captain Tom Moyer, freshman
Eugene Sargent and Mike Fadich back on their
bikes.
Borchers had to switch bikes and rode a frame
three centimeters too big for 1 the remainder of the
race. Sargent recovered well from a dive over the fal
len Moyer.
Soon after recovering. Borchers sprinted off the
front of the pack, setting up a later break by Sargent.
After the attempted break, the size of the bike began
to wear on Borchers' knees and he was finally lapped
after 25 circuits.
Sargent jumped off the front of the pack with a Cal
Poly rider on lap 14. They were not strong enough to
stay away, however, and were caught four laps later.
With eight laps remaining, the winning break
formed without any Stanford riders. Two Cal Poly
riders and two members of the UC-San Diego team
jumped off the front and were never caught. In the
field sprint, Moyer finished third and Sargent was
10th, for eighth and 15th place overall, respectively.
