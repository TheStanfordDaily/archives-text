# Rush chairmen react to IFC proposal
## 
### MARCUS MABRY Senior staff writer 
A recent Interfraternity Council (IFC) pro
posal calling for changes in this year's fra
ternity Rush has sparked sharp disagree
ment among Rush chairmen.
The proposal was submitted to the IFC
last week by the IFC Rush Committee. After
extensive examination of the current Rush
process, the committee recommended such
reforms as requiring Rushees to use official
IFC registration forms, or "Rush cards," to
gain entrance to Rush functions.
The proposal also calls for restricted use
of alcohol during the first week of Rush and
prohibits the use of alcohol during the
second week of the three- week event.

The proposal is to be formally discussed
at house meetings in the fraternities this
week. The IFC will meet Feb. 18 for a final
vote on the proposal. If approved, the new
policy will take effect immediately.
Phi Delta Theta Rush Chairman Richard
Barton said he was satisfied with the pro
posal "on the whole." but that his fraternity
may propose some minor changes, such as
dropping the prohibition of hard liquor
during the first week.
"I feel the proposal is very good, particu
larly the Rush cards.' They will keep the
number of people attending the parties
down tc these u&oare intc-ested in frater
nity life," Barton said.
Kappa Alpha Rush Chairman Chris Erlin
disagreed, saying that while he does not see

the proposed alcohol policy as a point of
contention, the Rush card policy may be ob
jectionable.
According to Erlin, the inaccessibility of
the cards, which would only be available at
a general information meeting and at four
other locations around campus, may dis
courage some students, particularly fresh
men, from attending Rush.
He was especially concerned about those
students who initially attend functions
simply as social outlets, but who then dis
cover that fraternities are more than just
parties. These students would not be likely
to go through the effort to get the cards and
might miss the opportunity to really explore
Stanford's fraternities, he said.
Citing the proposed alcohol policy and

the Rush card policy as controversial
measures, Erlin said "I'm not sure that the
entire proposal will be approved. I would
not be at all surprised If It had to be
revised."
Bob Hess, Rush chairman for the Delta
Kappa Epsllon fraternity, was more confi
dent about the proposal's chances of ap
proval. saying "I definitely agree with every
thing In it."
Hess said he had discussed the possible
changes with house officers and noted that
their responses had been favorable.
"We're trying to de-emphasize alcohol. I
think it'll have a positive effect. It (the pro
posal) will make the parties more Rush-
oriented." he added.
All three chairmen said they
believed the proposed dry second
week would not alter the Rush ex
perience. They also agreed that
the one dry week may be extended
to all of Rush in the future, follow
ing a national trend toward dry
rushes.
Although Hess said he "had
nothing against a dry Rush." Er
lin said a policy of prohibiting al
cohol during the period when pro
spective members are being intro
duced to fraternity life can be mis
leading.
Barton called the proposal
"accommodation" with the Uni
versity.
Citing recent problems with
Rush on this campus and the
trend toward dry rushes
nationwide, Barton said he
believed "Rush will eventually go
dry as a mandate from the Univer
sity.
