### FRANK QUARATIELLO Staff writer 
A theft of student art work last weekend from the Cum
mings Art Building may have harmful effects on the future
of the Stanford art community, according to the two theft
victims.
Two silkscreen prints were stolen from a student art
show in the hallway outside Annenberg Auditorium
sometime between late Friday afternoon and early Monday
morning, said Art Prof. Matthew Kahn.
"It was the first instance that I know about where art
work has been stolen (from a show in the Cummings Art
Building)," Kahn said.
"The immediate impulse is to take the show down and
not put any more shows up," Kahn said. Noting that the

current exhibition is still up. Kahn urged that the Art De
partment continue to allow students to show their art
work.
The theft may cause Stanford art students to think twice
before agreeing to exhibit their works in the future, accord
ing to seniors Maia Fong and senior Hugh Driscoll. the vic
tims of the crime. "It's too early to understand the full
ramifications of the theft," Kahn noted.
Both Fong and Driscoll said they felt the theft may stifle
future student art shows.
"If people are afraid of theft, they may not show their art
work." Driscoll said.
Fong. whose gray and purple nine-by-three-foot print
was stolen, characterized the theft as a "breaking of a com
munity trust." The show was a public display for the enjoy
ment and appreciation of everyone, she said.

The two stolen silkscreen prints were part of a large show
of exceptional works from an autumn quarter pattern
design class, said Kahn, who was the instructor. He said
that some members of the class had organized the show
themselves and that they had been very enthusiastic about
it. He said that although not all classes produce displayable
work, there are usually two or three shows each year.
The student art work was on display in the hallways
around Annenberg Auditorium. Some smaller works were
in locked, glass cabinets. The two prints that were stolen,
however, were hanging unprotected from the walls along
with several other large prints.
Kahn said the location of the two prints made it easier to
take them without being seen from the main doors at the
end of the hallway.
