# The 						art of Stanford outdoor sculpture
## 
### JULIE WIDMAN Senior staff writer 
"I may disagree with what
you say, but I'll support your
right to say it."
That is how one student
characterized the outdoor art
on the Stanford campus, and
Art Prof. Albert Elsen agreed.
"Generally speaking, when
we put in a sculpture, we put it
in to challenge students." said
Elsen, a member of the Univer
sity Panel on Outdoor Art
(UPOA). which is responsible
for reviewing and recommend
ing outdoor art proposals.
Otherwise, the sculpture
"wouldn't belong on a univer
sity campus: it would belong in
a shopping mall or in an office."
he said.
"Art that pleases the public
from the beginning is usually
art that doesn't last." Elsen
added. "If art is so trpid, so

palatable, so self-evident, then
you should get your money
back."
Diversity of Excellence
The collection of sculptures
and fountains on campus is
one of the three best in the
country, according to John
Henry Merryman, professor
emeritus of the Law School and
former member of UPOA. The
Stanford campus is unusual in
that it has both a sculpture gar
den and an outdoor program.
Art for just about every taste
can be found on campus, from
Rodin figure sculptures to the
abstract "Vanguard" by Bruce
Beasley on the lawn near
Kresge Auditorium.
"No one can accuse us of
choosing the same kind of art,"
Elsen said.
can be found on campus, from Rodin figure
sculptures to the abstract "Vanguard" by Bruce
Beasley on the lawn near Kresge Auditorium.
"No one can accuse us of choosing the same kind
of art," Elsen said.
The collecting of outstanding and unique outdoor
sculptures began in earnest in 1969 with the ac
quisition of modernist artist Henry Moore's "Large
Torso: Arch," which now rests in front of the Cum
mings Art Building. The latest addition was Jack
Zajac's "Big Ram's Skull and Horn," installed last
June between Green Library and Crothers Hall.
Since then, the University has acquired dozens of
works in a variety of styles. Elsen said.
Sometimes individuals make an anonymous gift,
as did the donor of Joan Miro's "Oiseau," which is in
the courtyard of Cummings Art Building.
Many times the sculpture is given so that the
donor or someone else may be remembered. Alexan
der Calder's "The Falcon." in front of the law school
and Arnaldo Pomodoro's "The Cube," in front of the

Stanford Museum of Art, are examples of this. "The
Cube" was donated by Chemistry Prof. Carl Djerasi
in memory of his daughter.
Jacques Lipchitz's "Song of the Vowels," at the en
trance to the Medical Center, was a gift from friends
of the late Dr. Henry Kaplan, who "if he had lived,
would have probably won a Nobel prize," according to
Merryman.
The process of acquiring the sculpture began while
Kaplan, who had cancer, was still alive and able to
communicate.
The design for "The Stanford Wall" between the
Quad and the physics tank was given to Stanford by
the artist Josef Albers in 1973. But it was not built
until 1980, after the University Administration had
deliberated over the site and construction of the
sculpture.
Originally, the Wall was to be placed in front of the
Law School, but the Law faculty objected, and the lo
cation was switched to the sculpture's present site.
This kind of occurrence is not at all uncommon,
according to Elsen. "We (the members of UPOA) are
sensitive to what people in the neighborhood want,"
he said.
The two different sides of the Wall contribute to its
intriguing appearance. On one side is a relief: On the
other are four different line drawings, all generated
from the same set of points.
"The artist was interested in the way we see physi
cal facts and psychological effects," Elsen said.
Perhaps the most controversial work on campus is
George Segal's "Gay Liberation." which Stanford ac
cepted after the cities of Cambridge, Mass., New York
and Los Angeles had turned it down. The work, lo
cated between Varian Physics Lab and Serra Street,
features two men standing side by side and two
women sitting next to each other on a bench.
The Mildred Andrews Fund which donated the
work "believed that art can help people to be ed
ucated about social issues," and wanted the statues
placed where intelligent people could see them, ac
cording to Elsen.
"The sculpture is there to create tolerance," he
said.
Differing Attitudes
Tolerance, however, seems to be a scarce quality in
some cases. In a particularly chilling episode of van
dalism a few years ago, a "psychopath" attacked the
"Gay Liberation" statues with a hammer, according
to Merryman. The two women's faces were the tar
gets of most of the damage.
Big Game has also produced some incidents of
vandalism, most recently the 1985 spray-painting of
the Rodin sculptures, which, according to Elsen,
caused irreparable damage.
Elsen said he finds the callous and even hostile at
titudes of many students toward the outdoor art to
be common.
"People expect public art to be a confirmation of
what they already know and already like," he said.

vandalism, most recently the 1985 spray-painting of
the Rodin sculptures, which, according to Elsen,
caused irreparable damage.
Elsen said he finds the callous and even hostile at
titudes of many students toward the outdoor art to
be common.
"People expect public art to be a confirmation of
what they already know and already like," he said.

Arnaldo Pomodoro's "The Cube", which sits in

by Prof. Carl Djerassi in memory of his daughter.
"I may disagree with what
you say, but I'll support your
right to say it."
That is how one student
characterized the outdoor art
on the Stanford campus, and
Art Prof. Albert Elsen agreed.
"Generally speaking, when
we put in a sculpture, we put it
in to challenge students." said
Elsen, a member of the Univer
sity Panel on Outdoor Art
(UPOA). which is responsible
for reviewing and recommend
ing outdoor art proposals.
Otherwise, the sculpture
"wouldn't belong on a univer
sity campus: it would belong in
a shopping mall or in an office."
he said.
"Art that pleases the public
from the beginning is usually
art that doesn't last." Elsen
added. "If art is so trpid, so

palatable, so self-evident, then
you should get your money
back."
Diversity of Excellence
The collection of sculptures
and fountains on campus is
one of the three best in the
country, according to John
Henry Merryman, professor
emeritus of the Law School and
former member of UPOA. The
Stanford campus is unusual in
that it has both a sculpture gar
den and an outdoor program.
Art for just about every taste
can be found on campus, from
Rodin figure sculptures to the
abstract "Vanguard" by Bruce
Beasley on the lawn near
Kresge Auditorium.
"No one can accuse us of
choosing the same kind of art,"
Elsen said.

sculptures to the abstract "Vanguard" by Bruce

"No one can accuse us of choosing the same kind
of art," Elsen said.
The collecting of outstanding and unique outdoor
sculptures began in earnest in 1969 with the ac
quisition of modernist artist Henry Moore's "Large
Torso: Arch," which now rests in front of the Cum
mings Art Building. The latest addition was Jack
Zajac's "Big Ram's Skull and Horn," installed last
June between Green Library and Crothers Hall.
Since then, the University has acquired dozens of
works in a variety of styles. Elsen said.
Sometimes individuals make an anonymous gift,
as did the donor of Joan Miro's "Oiseau," which is in
the courtyard of Cummings Art Building.
Many times the sculpture is given so that the
donor or someone else may be remembered. Alexan
der Calder's "The Falcon." in front of the law school
and Arnaldo Pomodoro's "The Cube," in front of the

Stanford Museum of Art, are examples of this. "The
Cube" was donated by Chemistry Prof. Carl Djerasi
in memory of his daughter.
Jacques Lipchitz's "Song of the Vowels," at the en
trance to the Medical Center, was a gift from friends
of the late Dr. Henry Kaplan, who "if he had lived,
would have probably won a Nobel prize," according to
Merryman.
The process of acquiring the sculpture began while
Kaplan, who had cancer, was still alive and able to
communicate.
The design for "The Stanford Wall" between the
Quad and the physics tank was given to Stanford by
the artist Josef Albers in 1973. But it was not built
until 1980, after the University Administration had
deliberated over the site and construction of the
sculpture.
Originally, the Wall was to be placed in front of the
Law School, but the Law faculty objected, and the lo
cation was switched to the sculpture's present site.
This kind of occurrence is not at all uncommon,
according to Elsen. "We (the members of UPOA) are
sensitive to what people in the neighborhood want,"
he said.
The two different sides of the Wall contribute to its
intriguing appearance. On one side is a relief: On the
other are four different line drawings, all generated
from the same set of points.
"The artist was interested in the way we see physi
cal facts and psychological effects," Elsen said.
Perhaps the most controversial work on campus is
George Segal's "Gay Liberation." which Stanford ac
cepted after the cities of Cambridge, Mass., New York
and Los Angeles had turned it down. The work, lo
cated between Varian Physics Lab and Serra Street,
features two men standing side by side and two
women sitting next to each other on a bench.
The Mildred Andrews Fund which donated the
work "believed that art can help people to be ed
ucated about social issues," and wanted the statues
placed where intelligent people could see them, ac
cording to Elsen.
"The sculpture is there to create tolerance," he
said.
Differing Attitudes
Tolerance, however, seems to be a scarce quality in
some cases. In a particularly chilling episode of van
dalism a few years ago, a "psychopath" attacked the
"Gay Liberation" statues with a hammer, according
to Merryman. The two women's faces were the tar
gets of most of the damage.
Big Game has also produced some incidents of
vandalism, most recently the 1985 spray-painting of
