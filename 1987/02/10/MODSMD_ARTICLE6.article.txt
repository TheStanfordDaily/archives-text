# The
						art of Stanford outdoor sculpture

"I may disagree with what
you say, but I'll support your
right to say it."
That is how one student
characterized the outdoor art
on the Stanford campus, and
Art Prof. Albert Elsen agreed.
"Generally speaking, when
we put in a sculpture, we put it
in to challenge students." said
Elsen, a member of the Univer
sity Panel on Outdoor Art
(UPOA). which is responsible
for reviewing and recommend
ing outdoor art proposals.
Otherwise, the sculpture
"wouldn't belong on a univer
sity campus: it would belong in
a shopping mall or in an office."
he said.
"Art that pleases the public
from the beginning is usually
art that doesn't last." Elsen
added. "If art is so trpid, so

palatable, so self-evident, then
you should get your money
back."
Diversity of Excellence
The collection of sculptures
and fountains on campus is
one of the three best in the
country, according to John
Henry Merryman, professor
emeritus of the Law School and
former member of UPOA. The
Stanford campus is unusual in
that it has both a sculpture gar
den and an outdoor program.
Art for just about every taste
can be found on campus, from
Rodin figure sculptures to the
abstract "Vanguard" by Bruce
Beasley on the lawn near
Kresge Auditorium.
"No one can accuse us of
choosing the same kind of art,"
Elsen said.
