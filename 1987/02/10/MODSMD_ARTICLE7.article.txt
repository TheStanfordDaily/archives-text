### DIANE BISGEIER Senior staff writer 
The issue of divestment from South Africa is "a
constant source of worry, and the University does
not have an absolute and unmalleable position" con
cerning it, according to Warren Christopher, presi
dent of the Stanford Board of Trustees.
Christopher, former U.S. Deputy Secretary of State
under President Carter, answered several questions
last night in Gavilan lounge regarding the Univer
sity's policy on divestment and the current status of
the Reagan administration.
The University's policy of selective divestment from
South Africa was introduced when four students,
carrying a large poster which read "Where is your
morality? Divest," entered the lounge.
Christopher outlined Stanford's position of
"selective divestment" â€” the University will Individu
ally examine each company that does business in
South Africa in which the University invests, to see if
it is "carrying out policies that encompass non
discrimination and working for change" in that
country. He then pointed out several questions
which arise when the University chooses to divest
from a company, such as whether it is acceptable to
receive grants from that company, maintain stocks
in Its subsidiaries or allow It to conduct research at
University facilities.
"There are a lot of relationships that a university
has with a corporation." he said.
