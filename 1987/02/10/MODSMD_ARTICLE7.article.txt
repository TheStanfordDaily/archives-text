# Christopher explains Board Policy
## 
### DIANE BISGEIER Senior staff writer 
The issue of divestment from South Africa is "a
constant source of worry, and the University does
not have an absolute and unmalleable position" con
cerning it, according to Warren Christopher, presi
dent of the Stanford Board of Trustees.
Christopher, former U.S. Deputy Secretary of State
under President Carter, answered several questions
last night in Gavilan lounge regarding the Univer
sity's policy on divestment and the current status of
the Reagan administration.
The University's policy of selective divestment from
South Africa was introduced when four students,
carrying a large poster which read "Where is your
morality? Divest," entered the lounge.
Christopher outlined Stanford's position of
"selective divestment" — the University will Individu
ally examine each company that does business in
South Africa in which the University invests, to see if
it is "carrying out policies that encompass non
discrimination and working for change" in that
country. He then pointed out several questions
which arise when the University chooses to divest
from a company, such as whether it is acceptable to
receive grants from that company, maintain stocks
in Its subsidiaries or allow It to conduct research at
University facilities.
"There are a lot of relationships that a university
has with a corporation." he said.

Warren Christopher, president of the Board of Trustees, speaks on University divest
ment policy and the Iran-Contra arms controversy yesterday in Gavilan lounge.
"We're not talking about invest
ment in the South African govern
ment or police, but in American
corporations that happen to be
there. There is a plausible argu
ment that they can do more by
staying there. The question is,
would we be doing something
good or not .by divesting from
these companies? The answer to
that is quite unclear," he said.
Christopher also summarized
the position of the Reagan admin
istration in light of the recent

Iran-contra arms controversy. He
said the relationship between
Reagan and the American people
has been "fundamentally
changed" as a result of Reagan's
being "led astray by some of his
advisers in the White House."
He said the arms deal, in which
profits from arms sold to Iran were
channeled to aid contra rebels in
Nicaragua, was wrong and
represented "a dramatic reversal
of U.S. policy." The move was
"costly in the credibility of the
president with so many constitu
ents, including foreign nations as
well as the American public."
Christopher said he attributed
the policy move to the administra

tion's treatment of the National
Security Council (NSC). "At the
beginning of his (Reagan's) ad
ministration, Reagan preferred
ideology to competence on the
council and downgraded it. They
weren't steeped enough in their
history and not careful enough in
their thought process."
He said Lt. Col. Oliver North's
influence in the Iran-contra deci
sion was a result of the
"confidence the president had in
him and the feeling that he had
the confidence of the president."'
"North was allowed to run free
and wild. The council needs to be
greatly strengthened," Christo
pher said.
