Car bomb kills 15 in Beirut
BEIRUT. Lebanon — A huge explosion rocked the Shla Moslem
controlled southern suburbs of Beirut yesterday afternoon, killing
at least 15 people and wounding at least 80 others.
A white Mercedes loaded with 150 pounds of explosives blew up
near a gas station in the Rwais area in the crowded southern sub
urbs. The death toll was expected to rise.
After the explosion, gunmen from the Shia Moslem militia Amal
took to the streets, shooting in the air to clear the way for am
bulances and rescue workers rushing to the scene. The relief
crews had to pull away rubble brought down in the blast to free
victims.
Beirut radio stations reported that fires erupted in the area and
many shops and buildings were destroyed.
The explosion was the second in West Beirut yesterday. Earlier
in the day, four people were wounded by a suitcase bomb that had
been planted in a house for refugees. A resident found the bomb
and threw it into the street, where it exploded among shoppers.
Amal security officials appeared on Moslem-controlled Lebanese
television with a woman they accused of attempting to park a car
loaded with explosives in the Shia-controlled area of Bourj Baraj
neh.
U.S. to ease export control
WASHINGTON — Commerce Secretary Malcolm Baldrige,
asserting that restrictions on the overseas sale of technology
weaken American security, yesterday announced an easing of
export-control procedures designed to help U.S. companies com
pete in foreign markets.
"We can make these changes without giving up national secur
ity," Baldrige said. "We are talking about rectifying the areas
where we have gone too far. Our idea is not to hurt national secur
ity"
The changes involve one of the most contentious trade issues
within the Reagan administration. In the debate leading up to
yesterday's announcement, the Commerce Department was pitted
against the Pentagon over the degree of controls necessary to
prevent the Soviet military from gaining access to U.S. technol
ogy-
Baldrige listed 11 changes in the procedures governing the sales
of U.S. technology to Western nations. These include removing re
strictions on sales to government agencies in allied countries;
easing controls on exports to other non-Communist countries, as
well as on products that are widely available from other countries;
and revising within the next few weeks restrictions on sales of
components and spare parts for U.S.-made technology.
Commerce Department sources said the Baldrige reforms have
the support of the White House, and that President Reagan was
expected to incorporate some of them in the trade bill he will pres
ent to Congress Feb. 19. Others can be implemented without con
gressional approval and reportedly received the support of the Na
tional Security Council and the State Department at a meeting
two weeks ago.
Iranian radicalism not relevant
WASHINGTON — President Reagan's chief spokesman, ack
nowledging that Vice President George Bush was told last summer
that the United States was dealing with Iran's most radical ele
ments in its arms sales, said yesterday that the question of
whether the contacts were with moderates or radicals was not rel
evant to the goals of the secret weapons shipments.
"The administration was trying to open a dialogue with ele
ments in Iran that were prepared to work with us, with the United
States. And the question of moderates and radicals is a semantic
difference," White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said.
"We were hoping for moderate in the sense of elements who were
willing to work with us. But you can define moderates and radi
cals in hundreds of different ways, particularly in Iran." said
Fitzwater. who was Bush's spokesman before becoming the White
House spokesman last week.
Fitzwater acknowledged that Bush was told that the Iranian
contacts were among the radical elements in the Tehran regime
during a meeting in Israel with Amiram Nir. an anti-terrorism ad
viser to the Israeli government. Details of the session were in
cluded in a top-secret memorandum prepared by Craig Fuller,
Bush's chief of staff and the only other person who took part.
The disclosure, made first by the Washington Post, indicated
that Bush had a greater involvement in the Iran operation than
had previously been known. It also went to the heart of the admin
istration's portrayal of the operation as an attempt to win the fa
vor of "moderate" Iranian elements and boost their chances of
gaining control after the death of the Ayatollah Ruhollah
Khomeini, the aging leader of the Tehran regime.
Contras may violate war laws
WASHINGTON — The U.S.-funded Nicaraguan rebels are guilty
of systematic violations of the laws of war, including indis
criminate attacks against civilians, assassination of suspected
opponents and widespread kidnapping, a human rights organiza
tion charged yesterday.
The group, Americas Watch, also accused Nicaragua's Sandi
nista government of human rights abuses but said that the
regime does not regularly violate the laws of war as the contras do.
The Reagan administration and the contras heatedly denied the
charges. The administration is expected to ask Congress for
renewed funding for the contras soon, and opponents of contin
ued aid say the rebels' human rights record will be one of their
central arguments.
"Violations of the laws of armed conflict by the contras cause
g-eat suffering to the Nicaraguan people," Americas Watch said in
its annual report on human rights in Nicaragua.
"They still engage in selective but systematic killing of persons
they perceive as representing the government, in Indiscriminate
attacks against civilians . . . and in outrages against the personal
dignity ol prisoners." the report said. "The contras also engage in
widespread kidnapping of civilians, apparently for purposes of
recruitment as well as intimidation: a significant number of the
kidnap victims are children."
Administration and contra officials flatly rejected the charges
and accused Americas Watch, a largely liberal group, of bias in fa
vor of the leftist Sandinistas.
"It's clear by now that Americas Watch is at least as interested in
political polemics as in human rights." Department of State
spokesman Gregory Lagana said. "The idea that there's a sys
tematic pattern of abuses by the contras is just nonsense."
Police save robbery hostages
MARSEILLES. France — Gunmen trying to rob a bank here held
23 hostages in a 12-hour standoff yesterday before fleeing as
police stormed the bank and rescued the hostages.
Police said all the hostages were unhurt. The gang, thought to
consist of six or seven men, escaped through the cellar of the
building as a special police anti-gangster unit burst in.
Detectives said the holdup men were probably professional
criminals. Although police had blocked off much of the town and
surrounded the bank with sharpshooters, the robbers calmly
rifled all the safe-deposit boxes in the bank.

Car bomb kills 15 in Beirut
BEIRUT. Lebanon — A huge explosion rocked the Shla Moslem
controlled southern suburbs of Beirut yesterday afternoon, killing
at least 15 people and wounding at least 80 others.
A white Mercedes loaded with 150 pounds of explosives blew up
near a gas station in the Rwais area in the crowded southern sub
urbs. The death toll was expected to rise.
After the explosion, gunmen from the Shia Moslem militia Amal
took to the streets, shooting in the air to clear the way for am
bulances and rescue workers rushing to the scene. The relief
crews had to pull away rubble brought down in the blast to free
victims.
Beirut radio stations reported that fires erupted in the area and
many shops and buildings were destroyed.
The explosion was the second in West Beirut yesterday. Earlier
in the day, four people were wounded by a suitcase bomb that had
been planted in a house for refugees. A resident found the bomb
and threw it into the street, where it exploded among shoppers.
Amal security officials appeared on Moslem-controlled Lebanese
television with a woman they accused of attempting to park a car
loaded with explosives in the Shia-controlled area of Bourj Baraj
neh.
U.S. to ease export control
WASHINGTON — Commerce Secretary Malcolm Baldrige,
asserting that restrictions on the overseas sale of technology
weaken American security, yesterday announced an easing of
export-control procedures designed to help U.S. companies com
pete in foreign markets.
"We can make these changes without giving up national secur
ity," Baldrige said. "We are talking about rectifying the areas
where we have gone too far. Our idea is not to hurt national secur
ity"
The changes involve one of the most contentious trade issues
within the Reagan administration. In the debate leading up to
yesterday's announcement, the Commerce Department was pitted
against the Pentagon over the degree of controls necessary to
prevent the Soviet military from gaining access to U.S. technol
ogy-
Baldrige listed 11 changes in the procedures governing the sales
of U.S. technology to Western nations. These include removing re
strictions on sales to government agencies in allied countries;
easing controls on exports to other non-Communist countries, as
well as on products that are widely available from other countries;
and revising within the next few weeks restrictions on sales of
components and spare parts for U.S.-made technology.
Commerce Department sources said the Baldrige reforms have
the support of the White House, and that President Reagan was
expected to incorporate some of them in the trade bill he will pres
ent to Congress Feb. 19. Others can be implemented without con
gressional approval and reportedly received the support of the Na
tional Security Council and the State Department at a meeting
two weeks ago.
Iranian radicalism not relevant
WASHINGTON — President Reagan's chief spokesman, ack
nowledging that Vice President George Bush was told last summer
that the United States was dealing with Iran's most radical ele
ments in its arms sales, said yesterday that the question of
whether the contacts were with moderates or radicals was not rel
evant to the goals of the secret weapons shipments.
"The administration was trying to open a dialogue with ele
ments in Iran that were prepared to work with us, with the United
States. And the question of moderates and radicals is a semantic
difference," White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said.
"We were hoping for moderate in the sense of elements who were
willing to work with us. But you can define moderates and radi
cals in hundreds of different ways, particularly in Iran." said
Fitzwater. who was Bush's spokesman before becoming the White
House spokesman last week.
Fitzwater acknowledged that Bush was told that the Iranian
contacts were among the radical elements in the Tehran regime
during a meeting in Israel with Amiram Nir. an anti-terrorism ad
viser to the Israeli government. Details of the session were in
cluded in a top-secret memorandum prepared by Craig Fuller,
Bush's chief of staff and the only other person who took part.
The disclosure, made first by the Washington Post, indicated
that Bush had a greater involvement in the Iran operation than
had previously been known. It also went to the heart of the admin
istration's portrayal of the operation as an attempt to win the fa
vor of "moderate" Iranian elements and boost their chances of
gaining control after the death of the Ayatollah Ruhollah
Khomeini, the aging leader of the Tehran regime.
Contras may violate war laws
WASHINGTON — The U.S.-funded Nicaraguan rebels are guilty
of systematic violations of the laws of war, including indis
criminate attacks against civilians, assassination of suspected
opponents and widespread kidnapping, a human rights organiza
tion charged yesterday.
The group, Americas Watch, also accused Nicaragua's Sandi
nista government of human rights abuses but said that the
regime does not regularly violate the laws of war as the contras do.
The Reagan administration and the contras heatedly denied the
charges. The administration is expected to ask Congress for
renewed funding for the contras soon, and opponents of contin
ued aid say the rebels' human rights record will be one of their
central arguments.
"Violations of the laws of armed conflict by the contras cause
g-eat suffering to the Nicaraguan people," Americas Watch said in
its annual report on human rights in Nicaragua.
"They still engage in selective but systematic killing of persons
they perceive as representing the government, in Indiscriminate
attacks against civilians . . . and in outrages against the personal
dignity ol prisoners." the report said. "The contras also engage in
widespread kidnapping of civilians, apparently for purposes of
recruitment as well as intimidation: a significant number of the
kidnap victims are children."
Administration and contra officials flatly rejected the charges
and accused Americas Watch, a largely liberal group, of bias in fa
vor of the leftist Sandinistas.
"It's clear by now that Americas Watch is at least as interested in
political polemics as in human rights." Department of State
spokesman Gregory Lagana said. "The idea that there's a sys
tematic pattern of abuses by the contras is just nonsense."
Police save robbery hostages
MARSEILLES. France — Gunmen trying to rob a bank here held
23 hostages in a 12-hour standoff yesterday before fleeing as
police stormed the bank and rescued the hostages.
Police said all the hostages were unhurt. The gang, thought to
consist of six or seven men, escaped through the cellar of the
building as a special police anti-gangster unit burst in.
Detectives said the holdup men were probably professional
criminals. Although police had blocked off much of the town and
surrounded the bank with sharpshooters, the robbers calmly
rifled all the safe-deposit boxes in the bank.
