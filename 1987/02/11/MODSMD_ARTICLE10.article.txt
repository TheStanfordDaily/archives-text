# Secret hostage talks now underway
## 
### 
JERUSALEM — Secret negotiations are un
der way to swap Israeli prisoners of war as part
of an exchange involving 400 Arab detainees
and four professors held hostage in Beirut,
western diplomatic sources said yesterday.
The sources indicated that the talks are
being conducted abroad to ensure confiden
tiality and involve private intermediaries
rather than governments or the Geneva-based
International Committee of the Red Cross
(ICRC).
The reports here and in Beirut that negotia
tions had begun followed an announcement
early yesterday by the group that kidnapped
the four professors— three Americans and an
Indian with U.S. residency —that it was
postponing their execution. The kidnappers,
who call themselves Islamic Jihad for the
Liberation of Palestine, had threatened to kill
their hostages if the 400 Arab prisoners were
not released by midnight Monday.
Israeli government officials had said that if
the kidnappers' ultimatum were rejected, talks
could be conducted without publicity through
"proper channels." Such has been the case in
seven recorded past exchanges involving
captured Israeli servicemen.

Lending further credence to the reports of
negotiations were reports that the ICRC in
Beirut has received a detailed list of 310
Lebanese and 90 Palestinian detainees from Is
lamic Jihad for the Liberation of Palestine.
[Washington Post special correspondent
Nora Boustany reported from Beirut that the
310 Lebanese prisoners were Shiite Moslems,
held mostly at Khiam in Israel's "security zone"
in southern Lebanon. The 90 Palestinians,
well-informed political sources told Boustany,
include three men sentenced to life imprison
ment for a grenade attack near Jerusalem's
Western Wall last fall. Most of the Palestinians
are held inside Israel, at Atlit prison, the
sources said.)
Israeli Prime Minister Yitzak Shamir, inter
viewed on state television, said that Israel
would consider a "direct request" to negotiate
to trade Arab prisoners for the hostages. But
he said no such request had been received.
In Washington White House spokesman
Marlin Fitzwater said the United States has
not asked Israel to negotiate for release of the
American hostages. U.S. policy, he said,
remains that "we will not ransom hostages nor
will we encourage other countries to do so."

At stake is still problematic agreement on a
complicated package deal among Israel and
rival, mutually suspicious Arab groups hold
ing various groups of detainees.
The first indication of movement since the
four professors were kidnapped from the
campus of Beirut University College on Jan. 24
came last Saturday.
Speaking in Damascus, Nabih Berri, the
Syrian-backed leader of the moderate Shiite
Moslem militia Amal, offered to free an Israeli
navigator downed over southern Lebanon in
October as part of an overall deal involving the
professors.
Israel and Berri previously had worked out
the broad basis of an agreement to swap the
aviator, held by Amal, for an undisclosed num
ber of Amal prisoners, the sources said.
But that deal fell through because Berri ap
parently felt he would be further weakening
his position by dealing directly with Israel on a
bilateral basis.
The more radical Lebanese Shiites of the
pro-Iranian Hezbollah, or "party of God," have
gained strength steadily at Amal's expense in
southern Lebanon.
