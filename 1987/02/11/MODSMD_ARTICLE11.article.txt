# Stanford prof. opposed 'racist' history textbook
## 
### A.J. THOMAS 
State legislators last Friday called for the resigna
tion of state commissioners who approved the sale of
an American history textbook considered racist and
inaccurate, and asked for an investigation into the
selection of the book.
The California Bicentennial Commission an
nounced last Thursday it had stopped selling copies
of "The Making of America," which describes black
children as "pickaninnies" and blames American
slaves for their own mistreatment.
Last spring three members of the five-member
commission voted to sell the book, one member
abstained and Stanford History Prof. Jack Rakove
opposed the sale.
The book had been used to raise funds for commis
sion activities in celebration of the 200 th anniver
sary of the U.S. Constitution.
It was written by W. Cleon Skousen, a former Salt
Lake City police chief, a one-time local John Birch
Society leader and current head of the National Cen
ter for Constitution Studies (NCCS).
Although Rakove noted that neither he nor the
other commission members read the book very care
fully. he said, "I looked at it enough to know it was
trash . . . that several parts of it were very question
able if not objectionable."
The textbook was sold in an "incidental way" to In
dividuals and community groups, according to
Rakove. He said no more than 200 of the books had
been sold, mostly In Southern California, and sales
revenues did not exceed $900.
One passage in the book reads: "Numerous obser
vers . . . agreed that brutality was no more common
in the black belt than among free labor elsewhere,
and that slave owners were the worst victims of the
system."

Rakove became more concerned about the book in
late summer after reading it more carefully. He said
he did not read the chapters on slavery but focused
on Skousen's treatment of the Constitution —
Rakove's own area of scholarship.
"The book contains an extremist ideological treat
ment of the U.S. Constitution," State Senator Gary
Hart (D-Santa Barbara), who asked for the investiga
tion into the selection of the book, told the San Fran
cisco Chronicle.
In the book's discussion of First Amendment reli
gion provisions and states' rights issues. Rakove
said, he "found enough to turn me off."
From that point. Rakove's "real concern was to
make sure the commission did not push the book on
schools or endorse it as a serious historical text."
Rakove helped persuade California Superintend
ent of Public Education Bill Honig to establish an ad
visory committee to the bicentennial commission.
The advisory committee's role, Rakove said, is
twofold: to evaluate any kind of educational projects
undertaken by the commission and to serve as a fil
ter for the selection of school materials.
Last fall, Rakove's concern mounted when some
members of the bicentennial commission suggested
marketing "US 1.Q.," a trivia-question game that
serves as a companion to Skousen's textbook.
Rakove said he felt it was "entirely inappropriate
for a public commission to be associated with an ex
tremely controversial and far-right organization" like '
the NCCS.
He contacted the executive director of People for
the American Way while in Washington. D.C. Rakove
credits that group with putting pressure on the
bicentennial commission to re-examine its sale of
the textbook.
