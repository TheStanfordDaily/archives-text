# Expert discusses chlamydia epidemic
## 
### JENNIFER SCHMID 
Noting that the number of cases of
chlamydia seems to be increasing, an expert
on sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) said
yesterday that the United States is currently
experiencing an "epidemic."
Chlamydia is a sexually transmitted disease
that causes infertility in many American
women, according to the expert. Prof. Julius
Schatchter of the UC-San Francisco Medical
School.
The spread of chlamydia is very serious, ac
cording to Schatchter, because the large
percentage of women with chlamydia in the
United States could result in a very high infer
tility rate in the future. One out of six sexually
active teenage girls have chlamydia infections,
he said.
Schatchter spoke to about 70 people in Fair
child Auditorium, addressing the incidence of
chlamydia in both developing Third World
countries and the United States. The disease is
a leading cause of blindness in the Third

World, and it causes blocked fallopian tubes
and ectopic pregnancies, as well as infertility,
in American women.
The lecture was part of a series in a human
biology class on STDs.
STDs such as AIDS are being given more at
tention than chlamydia, which is more
widespread than AIDS, because "AIDS is here
now and it is frightening," Schatchter said.
Chlamydia is just as serious, however, be
cause of its effects when left untreated, he
said. "Each year over 1 million women get pel
vic inflammatory disease (as a result of
chlamydia). This results in 100,000 cases of
surgery on fallopian tubes, 25,000 cases of ec
topic pregnancies and about 200,000 cases of
sterility."
While many men are infected with
chlamydia, the consequences of infections in
men "are trivial" when compared with the da
mages caused by the infection in women,
Schatchter said.
In addition to infertility and tubal scarring,
women also carry the additional risk of pass

ing chlamydia to their infants, according to
Schatchter. Chlamydia is the leading cause of
pneumonia in newborn children.
Twenty percent of men and 40 percent of
women with an STD also have chlamydia, he
said. The patient sometimes has no symptoms
of chlamydia, and the infection may persist
after the patient is "clinically cured (of the
other disease)." Therefore, he said, "treatment
of diseases like gonorrhea should always be fol
lowed by treatment for chlamydia."
Chlamydia is also widespread in developing
countries, where it is not known as an STD
but instead is spread by flies and dirt, accord
ing to Schatchter.
In these countries, chlamydia is the cause of
the common disease trachoma, he said, noting
that trachoma is "the world's leading cause of
preventable blindness."
Trachoma is no longer found in the United
States because it is "a disease of poverty,"
Schatchter said. Chlamydia-caused trachoma
used to be a problem in the United States, but
it disappeared with industrialization, he
added.
