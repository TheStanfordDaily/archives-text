Patriotism got out of hand last week when
Tennessee high schools came under attack
— literally.
Members of the Tennessee National Guard
assaulted four Knoxville area high schools
with mock bombs and fake gunfire Wednes
day as part of a "Patriotism Awareness" pro
gram.
At Fulton High School, Guard members
landed a helicopter on the football field and
then, firing blanks and setting off smoke
bombs, stormed a darkened auditorium in
which unsuspecting students were watching
a film.
After the assault. Guard members told stu
dents the military action was not real, but it
could have happened if the students' parents
and grandparents had not fought in wars to
keep the country free. Before they left, the
Guardsmen handed out American flags.
The tactics of the Tennessee National
Guard are more than ridiculous. They are
dangerous and should not be repeated.
There is a difference between healthy patri
otism and jingoism. True patriotism — if by
that we mean a devotion to country, a respect
for its principles and laws and a conviction
that it is worth defending — is not likely to be
instilled by scare tactics or hype.
The conduct of the Guard displays an atti

tude that differs little from the coercive
ideologies Americans have always rejected
and at times combatted.
Why did our parents and grandparents
fight in the wars the Guard members men
tioned? Presumably it was not merely to try
out fancy military hardware on someone
besides high school students. They fought to
preserve a way of life they valued.
Among the freedoms Americans value
most are the freedom to speak and think as
they wish and for their children to be ed
ucated in an atmosphere of open-minded
discourse.
The jingoistic grandstanding by the Ten
nessee National Guard is inconsistent with
these principles. Perhaps even more appall
ing is the complicity of the Knoxville high
school officials who knew about and ap
proved the programs. High school principalis
have no business disrupting the process of
education so that teenagers can be am
bushed and indoctrinated by gun-toting
zealots.
The Tennessee Guard has announced it
will cancel the remainder of its planned pa
triotism awareness rallies. That's good. Bor
rowing the tactics of fascism to remind stu
dents how free they are is the wrong way to
instill patriotism.
