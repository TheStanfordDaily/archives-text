# It's the Stanford way

### 
I must commend Residential Education policy
makers for their latest campaign to transform the
University's student residences into theme houses.
When one ponders the use of our tuition money at
this institution, it is gratifying to realize that it goes
toward the critical needs on our campus. We are
definitely above the narrow-minded practice of, say,
building more housing for unsettled students when
we can displace current occupants by infusing a
homogeneous new residency and spend quite a bit of
money doing so. Why do things the simple way when
we could do them the Stanford way?

JEFF PHILLIBER

Certainly there will be those critics who decry this
movement as unnecessary, unworkable or down
right unfair. "If it ain't broke, don't fix it," one could
imagine the simple-minded among us preaching.
To answer them, let us examine our tremendously
successful pioneer theme houses. We are told upon
entering Stanford that Res Ed's directive is to posi
tion us so as to learn from the breadth and diversity
of fellow students living with us, to force an interac
tion of dialogue and cooperation among heterogene
ous peoples in their living situations. Nowhere has
this been better accomplished than in Stanford's
current theme houses — Ujamaa. East House,
Okada, Zapata and the housed fraternities.
To the average non-Stanford person, it might not
make sense to take a young Chicano from a Hispanic
ghetto and put him or her directly into a residence
filled with people as culturally, physically and politi
cally similar to him or her as can be found on this
campus. However, we — the Stanford educated —
know better — this environment will surely stim
ulate the young adult to question his or her values,
examine alternative cultures and ideas and generally
learn to interact with the plethora of peoples and
ideas that make up the whole of our society.
Likewise, there is nothing like a good dose of

fraternal living to help broaden a young, affluent
white male's mind, to help instruct him in tem
perance. tolerance and generally to dispel any notion
he may have of himself as the center of the universe.
The success, therefore, of racial/cultural theme
houses is not in question. Allegations that putting
rowdy men together in fraternities might make them
sexist or that housing mainstream whites in white
mainstream houses will make them ignorant and in
sensitive are all unfounded — indeed. Res Ed is quite
correct in thinking that segregation is the key to true
cultural and racial interaction and understanding.
These initial successes in segregated theme
houses then lead to a logical fruition in theme
houses centered around majors and study interests.
After all, what could an engineer possibly learn
from a poet, or why should a political scientist try to
communicate with a physicist, now or ever? For that
matter, why would any policy-maker need to under
stand science and psychology, or why would a doctor
or technological innovator need morality?
I would also argue, in concurrence with Res Ed,
that students involved in intense majors do not
spend enough time with peers in their discipline. An
electrical engineer who attends the same classes as
other EEs, studies at the same library and crams
with them nightly on problem sets for four straight
years at Stanford surely needs to spend more time
with this close-knit group of people.
At Terra House, the co-op where I live, a commu
nity of 65 students ranging from sophomores to
Ph.D. candidates comes together. These men and
women span disciplines from mathematics to clas
sics, from English to engineering. Whites,
Hispanics, blacks, Asians, Chinese, Europeans, In
dians and Africans live and learn from each other.
Res Ed could change all of this, however.
Some people might call that ridiculous.
Others might say that it is inherently unfair and
patently stupid.
I would just say that it is a case of Stanford Resi
dential Education at work.

sexist or that housing mainstream whites in white
mainstream houses will make them ignorant and in
sensitive are all unfounded — indeed. Res Ed is quite
correct in thinking that segregation is the key to true
cultural and racial interaction and understanding.
These initial successes in segregated theme
houses then lead to a logical fruition in theme
houses centered around majors and study interests.
After all, what could an engineer possibly learn
from a poet, or why should a political scientist try to
communicate with a physicist, now or ever? For that
matter, why would any policy-maker need to under
stand science and psychology, or why would a doctor
or technological innovator need morality?
I would also argue, in concurrence with Res Ed,
that students involved in intense majors do not
spend enough time with peers in their discipline. An
electrical engineer who attends the same classes as
other EEs, studies at the same library and crams
with them nightly on problem sets for four straight
years at Stanford surely needs to spend more time
with this close-knit group of people.
At Terra House, the co-op where I live, a commu
nity of 65 students ranging from sophomores to
Ph.D. candidates comes together. These men and
women span disciplines from mathematics to clas
sics, from English to engineering. Whites,
Hispanics, blacks, Asians, Chinese, Europeans, In
dians and Africans live and learn from each other.
Res Ed could change all of this, however.
Some people might call that ridiculous.
Others might say that it is inherently unfair and
patently stupid.
I would just say that it is a case of Stanford Resi
dential Education at work.
