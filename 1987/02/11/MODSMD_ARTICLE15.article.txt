# Sickeningly perky apparitions
## 
### 
Despite the chaotic nest of papers scattered
about me. it was obvious to everyone (except
myself) that I was not studying. I never study
at Tresidder: I just go there and pose with my
books for an hour or two and fool myself into
thinking that I am being productive. I was
doing particularly well, having almost con
vinced myself that I knew what I was reading,
when I became aware of someone looming be
hind me.

I turned around to see the very incarnation
of energy and enthusiasm. Sporting a "Donner
86-87" T-shirt and bearing a backpack over
flowing with Western Culture books, the ap
parition was sickeningly perky. "Is this seat
taken?" it asked.
I made a negative noise and he sat down and
began pulling a seemingly endless supply of
Cliff Notes from his backpack. "What are you
studying?" he asked brightly.
"I'm not. I'm posing here with my books
trying to fool myself into thinking that I'm
being productive. It's kind of a ritual."
"Oh. You must be a senior."
"Is It that obvious?"
"Yes."
Silence settled awkwardly over the table and
my eyes returned to the same paragraph they
had scanned a dozen times before. After a few
minutes of this, my mind was happily wander
ing far away from the unpleasant realities of
Impending midterms.
"What are you going to do after you
graduate?" asked the intruder suddenly.
Argh. I repeated my usual litany: "I dunno.
Work. Go to grad school. Or something." This

was ridiculous. I had come to Tresidder to do
some serious posing and here I was being
harassed by some obscenely cheerful fresh
man.
"I'm a freshman." he said cheerfully.
I made a non-commltal noise, hoping he
would go away.
"1 graduated last year." he said in an odd
tone.
"From Paly?"
"No, from Stanford. With a bachelor's degree
In international relations."
"Huh?"
And suddenly he was full of intensity. "Mike,
we have been watching you for a long time. We
think that you are ready to become one of us.
Listen. Mike: You don't have to graduate."
"Huh?"
"How old do you think 1 am?" he demanded.
"18? 19?" This was becoming very confus
ing. "Wrong. I'm 32. I have more degrees than
you can imagine. I have been at Stanford since
1972."
"Huh?"
"You know those freshmen who are almost
too stereotypical to be believable? People who
take frat parties seriously? Who drink cases of
beer even though they hate the stuff? People
who study for their midterms, call papers
essays' and Jump at all the wrong times during
All Right Now'? Some of these people are Just
naturally clueless, but most have been trained
by us. And we could train you. too."
My brain reeled. Me. a freshman?
Impossible.
"I don't have what It takes to be a freshman
again. I'm too old. too mature. Do 1 look like I
could be a freshman?"
"Yes." he said flatly, "you do." Well, that was
true enough. "Too mature," he continued with
a wicked smirk. "Let's see." From his backpack
he produced a thick folder filled with
photographs. "Now this would appear to be
you tobogganning down a flight of stairs on a
food service tray."

"Hey! Where did you get that?"
"And I believe this is you rolling around the
halls covered with shaving cream. And you
stealing someone's door. And you pushing a
shopping cart around the claw. And here we
have you leaping through someone's window
carrying vodka jello, wearing a kamikaze head
band and throwing paper airplanes and
firecrackers. What was that all about?"
"It was Pearl Harbor Day," I ventured weakly.
"Ah, of course. Mike, I believe your training
would be easier than most."
"But. . .
"No buts. Listen. You've had a great time
here for four years, right? All kinds of wild, ex
hilirating fun. Well, guess what? They're going
to kick you out. Then what are you going to
do? Go to grad school and spend another year
taking classes you hate? Or perhaps you will
abandon all your ideals and aspirations and
become a corporate tool, writing weapons con
trol systems for Northrop. Are you ready to
start hanging around in Chuck Taylor Grove,
wearing red polyester pants and reminiscing
about the good old days?"
"Well, of course not. But there must be some
thing meaningful 1 can do. I mean. I can't hide
here forever, can I?"
"Why not? Look at me. Look at the charac
ters in Doonesbury. Hell, they were in college
for decades."
"It's tempting. It really is. But I don't think
that becoming a freshman again is the answer.
Even Zonker Harris had to graduate. Sooner or
later I have to become a real person. No, I think
I'll take my chances with graduation. At least I
won't have to live in Stern again."
The 32-year-old freshman looked at me for a
long time with a mingling of disappointment
and pity. "We'll contact you again in June," he
said finally. "Maybe you'll reconsider then."
Maybe I will.

taking classes you hate? Or perhaps you will
abandon all your ideals and aspirations and
become a corporate tool, writing weapons con
trol systems for Northrop. Are you ready to
start hanging around in Chuck Taylor Grove,
wearing red polyester pants and reminiscing
about the good old days?"
"Well, of course not. But there must be some
thing meaningful 1 can do. I mean. I can't hide
here forever, can I?"
"Why not? Look at me. Look at the charac
ters in Doonesbury. Hell, they were in college
for decades."
"It's tempting. It really is. But I don't think
that becoming a freshman again is the answer.
Even Zonker Harris had to graduate. Sooner or
later I have to become a real person. No, I think
I'll take my chances with graduation. At least I
won't have to live in Stern again."
The 32-year-old freshman looked at me for a
long time with a mingling of disappointment
and pity. "We'll contact you again in June," he
said finally. "Maybe you'll reconsider then."
Maybe I will.

Despite the chaotic nest of papers scattered
about me. it was obvious to everyone (except
myself) that I was not studying. I never study
at Tresidder: I just go there and pose with my
books for an hour or two and fool myself into
thinking that I am being productive. I was
doing particularly well, having almost con
vinced myself that I knew what I was reading,
when I became aware of someone looming be
hind me.

I turned around to see the very incarnation
of energy and enthusiasm. Sporting a "Donner
86-87" T-shirt and bearing a backpack over
flowing with Western Culture books, the ap
parition was sickeningly perky. "Is this seat
taken?" it asked.
I made a negative noise and he sat down and
began pulling a seemingly endless supply of
Cliff Notes from his backpack. "What are you
studying?" he asked brightly.
"I'm not. I'm posing here with my books
trying to fool myself into thinking that I'm
being productive. It's kind of a ritual."
"Oh. You must be a senior."
"Is It that obvious?"
"Yes."
Silence settled awkwardly over the table and
my eyes returned to the same paragraph they
had scanned a dozen times before. After a few
minutes of this, my mind was happily wander
ing far away from the unpleasant realities of
Impending midterms.
"What are you going to do after you
graduate?" asked the intruder suddenly.
Argh. I repeated my usual litany: "I dunno.
Work. Go to grad school. Or something." This

was ridiculous. I had come to Tresidder to do
some serious posing and here I was being
harassed by some obscenely cheerful fresh
man.
"I'm a freshman." he said cheerfully.
I made a non-commltal noise, hoping he
would go away.
"1 graduated last year." he said in an odd
tone.
"From Paly?"
"No, from Stanford. With a bachelor's degree
In international relations."
"Huh?"
And suddenly he was full of intensity. "Mike,
we have been watching you for a long time. We
think that you are ready to become one of us.
Listen. Mike: You don't have to graduate."
"Huh?"
"How old do you think 1 am?" he demanded.
"18? 19?" This was becoming very confus
ing. "Wrong. I'm 32. I have more degrees than
you can imagine. I have been at Stanford since
1972."
"Huh?"
"You know those freshmen who are almost
too stereotypical to be believable? People who
take frat parties seriously? Who drink cases of
beer even though they hate the stuff? People
who study for their midterms, call papers
essays' and Jump at all the wrong times during
All Right Now'? Some of these people are Just
naturally clueless, but most have been trained
by us. And we could train you. too."
My brain reeled. Me. a freshman?
Impossible.
"I don't have what It takes to be a freshman
again. I'm too old. too mature. Do 1 look like I
could be a freshman?"
"Yes." he said flatly, "you do." Well, that was
true enough. "Too mature," he continued with
a wicked smirk. "Let's see." From his backpack
he produced a thick folder filled with
photographs. "Now this would appear to be
you tobogganning down a flight of stairs on a
food service tray."

"Hey! Where did you get that?"
"And I believe this is you rolling around the
halls covered with shaving cream. And you
stealing someone's door. And you pushing a
shopping cart around the claw. And here we
have you leaping through someone's window
carrying vodka jello, wearing a kamikaze head
band and throwing paper airplanes and
firecrackers. What was that all about?"
"It was Pearl Harbor Day," I ventured weakly.
"Ah, of course. Mike, I believe your training
would be easier than most."
"But. . .
"No buts. Listen. You've had a great time
here for four years, right? All kinds of wild, ex
hilirating fun. Well, guess what? They're going
to kick you out. Then what are you going to
do? Go to grad school and spend another year
taking classes you hate? Or perhaps you will
abandon all your ideals and aspirations and
become a corporate tool, writing weapons con
trol systems for Northrop. Are you ready to
