The Bible isn't
infallible truth
Lily Lo s recent viewpoint
(Daily, Feb. 5) disagrees with
Scott Schulz's column (Daily,
Jan. 30) regarding homosexuality
and the church on the basis of
her belief that God's truth is
"perfect and immutable." She
concludes from this that since
the Judeo-Christian Bible says
that homosexuality is wrong.
Christians "have a duty to hate
homosexuality" despite any noble
desires not to do so.
I feel there is a basic flaw in her
logic that lies in the implied as
sumption that everything written
in the Bible is God's truth and
standard. To illustrate that bibli
cal texts must be interpreted, I
offer the following example,
which should be especially rele
vant to an academic institution
such as Stanford.
The same Bible that says
homosexuality is an abomination
also forbids women from
"teaching or usurping authority
over men" (1 Timothy 2:12-14).
This should be most distressing
to some of Lo s professors, not to
mention many other researchers,
lecturers, TAs and administrators
on this campus. Is this con
demnation of female teaching
therefore perfect and Immutable,
following Lo s definition?
On the other hand, the book of
Judges (chapters four and five)
tells the story of Deborah, who
led, taught and judged the people
of Israel before the days of the
kings. It seems, then, that the
condemnation was mutable in
Deborah's case.
If there are contradictions in
the Bible, then it must be up to
the reader to interpret the con
flicting passages. Once we let
ourselves interpret some
passages, the whole book opens
up for at least a low level of inter
pretation.
The Catholic Church, which
was the main church in question
in Scott Schulz's column,
originally interpreted Genesis as

saying that the earth was the
center of the universe, with the
sun and stars all accessories. It
ultimately did what Lo insists we
cannot do, when it officially (and
quite recently) admitted that
perhaps Galileo wasn't as hereti
cal as it had originally thought.
A true homophobe could easily
interpret God's standard as con
demning homosexuality.
However, if Lo truly believes, as
she said, that it would be a noble
dream for society to stop con
demning homosexuality, then I
think she can claim the right to
"hate" a little less and accept a
little more.

We didn't call
film neutral
Regarding a recent article on
SDI Awareness Month (Daily, Feb.
3) we as members of Stanford
Action for Nuclear Disarmament
(STAND) would like to clarify the
purpose of the dorm outreach
film "Star Wars: A Search For
Security." We regret any misun
derstandings concerning the
neutrality of the film. As the fliers
stated, "It takes a critical look at
SDI and examines alternatives for
reducing the threat of nuclear
war." Although the film presents
both sides of this crucial and
controversial issue, it ultimately
takes an anti-SDI point of view
that parallels STAND'S purpose:
To educate, motivate and ac
tivate.
Education is an invaluable
starting point, but it is fruitless
without translation into action.
Yet we also feel that action with
out education is blind, and
welcome debate after the film in
order to give people with different
political views an open chance to
express their position. Therefore
we have organized SDI Awareness
Month.

Profs. wrong on
Hoover issue
It strikes me as supremely
ironic that professors of English
and political science, of all things,
should object to the success of
fellow academics in communica
ting their political views to the
public as Profs. John Manley and
Ronald Rebholz did in bemoaning
the efforts of the prolific scholars
at the Hoover Institution to place
op-ed articles and provide policy
ideas to the Reagan administra
tion (Daily, Feb. 4).
Why, pray tell, is it not perfectly
proper for policy specialists at
Stanford or any other university
to encourage the government in
power to espouse the policies they
believe are called for? That is the
essence of democracy, and of
academic freedom.
If anything, the extent to which
government listens should be a
measure of the institution's suc
cess — as it has been for decades
at Harvard, to name an example.
Profs. Manley and Rebholz may
well disagree with the views of the
leading minds at the Hoover Insti
tution and in the Reagan admin
istration — many of us do. But
they shouldn't confuse that disa
greement with the right of Hoover
scholars to express themselves to
the public and to their govern
ment.
No one is alleging that the lob
bying is going on the other way
around, or that — as the good
professors imply with their loose
and frequent use of the adjective
"well-financed" — Stanford's
ideas are somehow hostage to
some nefarious Republican
financing scheme.
Perhaps Manley and Rebholz
would be more successful at limit
ing Hoover's influence if. instead
of seeking to limit their col
leagues' academic freedom, they
worked a little harder at promot
ing their own views in the politi
cal and public arena. Frankly,
America could use a few energetic
voices from the long-silent left.
