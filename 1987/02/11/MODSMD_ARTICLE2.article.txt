### DEBBIE RUBENSTEIN Senior staff writer 
The Board of Trustees' approval yes
terday of the 1986-87 operating and fin
ancial aid budgets of the Department of
Athletics. Physical Education, and
Recreation (DAPER) will increase future
support from University general funds,
restructure the intercollegiate program
and decrease the number of athletic
scholarships.
The proposal is a "step forward over

Geiger said he is working on details to
include future support from University
general funds in a complete plan, along

in June.

Department and all offer full scholar

II sports offer scholarships. Varsity I and
Varsity II level sports compete at the Pac
-10 and NCAA championship level.
Club sports are 95 percent self-help
programs with a small amount of fund

the ASSU.
Under the new program, most Varsity

renamed "Varsity" level sports. Geiger
