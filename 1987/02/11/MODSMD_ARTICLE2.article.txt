# Board approves adjustment in Athletic Department budget
## 
### DEBBIE RUBENSTEIN Senior staff writer 
The Board of Trustees' approval yes
terday of the 1986-87 operating and fin
ancial aid budgets of the Department of
Athletics. Physical Education, and
Recreation (DAPER) will increase future
support from University general funds,
restructure the intercollegiate program
and decrease the number of athletic
scholarships.
The proposal is a "step forward over
all," according to Athletic Director Andy
Gelger.
Geiger said the most crucial element
of the proposal is the addition of general
funds to support the athletic program.
The budget proposal — which is based

on the activities of the first four months
of the academic year — shows a
projected deficit of *75,000, according
to the DAPER proposal. The deficit is ex
pected after a *300,000 one-time contri
bution has been made from the Univer
sity, the proposal stated.
Geiger said he is working on details to
include future support from University
general funds in a complete plan, along
with a 1987-88 budget, to be completed
in June.
In addition to future general funds to
help ameliorate the department's finan
cial difficulty, the proposal outlines a
restructuring of the current intercol
legiate program: Varsity I, Varsity II and
club sports.
Under the present guidelines. Varsity I

sports are fully funded by the Athletic
Department and all offer full scholar
ships. Varsity II sports are partially
funded by the Athletic Department and
partially through self-help. Some Varsity
II sports offer scholarships. Varsity I and
Varsity II level sports compete at the Pac
-10 and NCAA championship level.
Club sports are 95 percent self-help
programs with a small amount of fund
ing from University general funds and
the ASSU.
Under the new program, most Varsity
I sports will remain ns is and be
renamed "Varsity" level sports. Geiger
said.
All Varsity II level sports and a few Var-
sity 1 level sports will come under
the heading of "Varsity Club"
sports, "sports for which no merit
aid would be awarded but for
which broad-based undergradu
ate participation would be the
goal. This group would likely
receive some University and de
partment funding, but these

sports would have to rely on fund
raising to support a significant
portion nf their intercollegiate ac
tivities." the proposal stated.
All sports at the Varsity Club
level will be assured money for
coaches, equipment and travel ex
penses. which is more support
than these sports receive now. he
said.
Geiger would not say which Var
sity I level sports will have their
scholarship money removed, al
though he did said he had some

Ideas.
The department will save money
through the Increase In funding
by the University general funds,
which will help support the Var
sity Club sports and help cover
operations and maintenance ex
penses. according to the proposal.
The growing deficit is the result
of DAPER's expansion of its inter
collegiate club sports and physical
education programs in the 1980s,
the proposal stated.
