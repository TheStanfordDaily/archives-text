## Issues no longer beyond the Farm 
### LESLIE HATAMIYA 
The ongoing turmoil of
Nicaragua, Afghanistan and
South Africa may be thousands
of miles away, but thanks to a
new lecture series sponsored by
Stanford-in-Government, the
current events of the world are
being brought home to the
Farm.
"Issues Beyond the Farm" Is
a new 10-part series of discus
sions focusing on current na
tional and international politi
cal issues. The program is
sponsored by SlG's Public
Policy Forum (PPF).
In order to raise awareness of
the social, political and eco
nomic problems of today's soci
ety, the PPF. the SIG committee
that organized the "Issues
Beyond the Farm" series, has
chosen topics such as tax
reform, arms control and
U.S./South Africa relations for
discussion, according to soph
omore Isaac Winer, director of
the forum.
"SIG has two main objec
tives," he said. "Most students
are aware of the first objective
of assisting students in obtain
ing internships with govern
ment and private agencies.
"The second objective is to
promote intellectual discourse
on political issues within the
Stanford community, and the
Public Policy Forum is respon
sible for this objective," he said.
According to Winer, "Issues
Beyond the Farm," which
began this quarter, is one of
SlG's latest efforts to fulfill this
second goal.
This series Is a departure

from years past. In previous
years, SIG has promoted a se
ries of programs in conjunction
with the nationwide "Great
Decisions Program," which is
sponsored by the World Affairs
Council (WAC).
Winer said that SIG decided
to break away from WAC's pro
gram in order to best present
the current problems of the
world to the Stanford commu
nity. The PPF started this year
and devised its own series of
programs, with U.S. and inter
national officials as well as
Stanford faculty participating,
Winer said.
The third installment of the
series, "The Iran-Contra Affair:
What was Israel's Role?" takes
place this afternoon in the
Branner lounge.
Highlighting this event will
be Ehud Ulmart, an Israeli gov
ernment official and member of
the Knesset, the parliamentary
body of the Israeli government.
The response to SlG's change
to "Issues Beyond the Farm"
has been promising, according
to Winer.
The attendance for the first
two programs was "good" and
is expected to be greater at the
future talks, Winer said. "All
the talks so far have been really
fantastic," he added.
Plans for other political fig
ures to speak on campus this
year include Gary Hart, Demo
cratic presidential hopeful and
former U.S. Senator from
Colorado, and Bruce Babbitt,
former Governor of Arizona,
Winer said.
