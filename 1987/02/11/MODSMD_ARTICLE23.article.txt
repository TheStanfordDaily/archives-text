## 'Light of Day': It's pretty dim 
### EDWARD G. ANDERSON 
Critic's note: Due to the ap
pearance of rock star Joan Jett
in "Light oj Day," for the follow
ing review I have secured the
aid of Richard Trevor Bruiser IV.
Detroit Tigers Jan, founder of the
Clint Eastwood for President
movement and professional
heavy metal critic. Richard and
I will attempt a movie review in
dialogue form. Sort of like Siskel
and Ebert, but much better.
Ed: "Light of Day" is the story of
aspiring rock musicians Michael
J. Fox and Joan Jett, who in
their struggle for musical suc
cess tackle myriad ethical, eco
nomic and family dilemmas.
Rick: Is that what it's about? I
couldn't tell.
Ed: I think so. I have to admit,
though, that I'm not quite sure,
because basically "Light of Day"
doesn't have a plot worthy of its
name. Writer-director Paul

Schrader just follows the mind
less meanderings of whining
Patty Rasnick (Jett) and her
slightly less insipid brother Joe
(Fox) in their quasi-revolt
against suburbia, as personified
by their mother (Gina
Rowlands). And when I say
Schrader follows them, I do
mean follows; he constantly uses
walking cameras, presumably to
bring the viewer into the action.
His cameramen could take a few
lessons in technique from a TV
news crew.
Anyway, the conflict of this
movie is never clearly defined.
Patty and her mother fight con
stantly, with her mother always
telling Patty to get married.
(Patty, it turns out, has an ille
gitimate son by the local mini
ster, who happens to be a friend
of her mother.) Joe and Patty
argue over the morality of theft
and whether it's OK to have her
son Benjie participate. Patty

waxes pseudo-philosophic over
her nihilistic devotion to
rock'n'roll. In an about-face later
in the movie, when her mother
dies of cancer, Patty agrees to
join her in heaven. I found
myself praying that this last
agreement was a suicide pact. I
wasn't so lucky, and had to
watch for another 30 minutes. In
the end everyone's problems are
solved with the panacea of a
rock'n'roll performance by Joe
and Patty. Right. Just like real
life.
Rick: So, dude, who's the villain
in the movie?
Ed: The producer. And by the
way, if my plot description seems
disjointed, it's because of the
movie. What a waste of talent.
Fox makes more funny jokes in
half an episode of "Family Ties"
than he does in this entire
movie. Michael McKean of
"Spinal Tap" is poorly utilized
and makes no impact. And al

though I suspect from her
monotonous performance that
Joan Jett is a lousy actress. 1
might be wrong, because
Schrader's direction Is so poor.
I'll leave Joan Jett as performer
for Rick to criticize.
Rick: Joan Jett just can't rock
out as good as she used to. I fell
asleep during one song. Not that
Jett was ever any good. In fact,
her best song In the entire movie
is Motley Crue's "The Looks That
Kill" — played, incidentally,
during Patty's heavy metal
phase. The best performance In
the movie is by the Fabulous
Thunderbirds, who show up in
the middle for no real reason.
I have to disagree with you on
one thing, Ed. On the
Barbusters' (Joe and Patty's
band) road trip, there were some
good scenes of Kalamazoo, Mi
chigan .
Ed: Uh, yeah. Kalamazoo, the fa
mous center of Midwestern cul
ture, with the name that no one
can pronounce with a straight
face. Pretty apt commentary on
the movie, though. Pardon my
interruption.
Rick: The only good original
songs in the movie were done by
Fox. Which brings up an inter
esting point: did you notice that
all of the stars of the movie could
really play their instruments?
Ed: Wonderful. I should mention
that there were some other inter
esting parts. One scene in which
Patty's father (Jason Miller)
winds the watch of his late wife
while she's in her coffin showed
interesting technique. There
were some other interesting
parts, I'm sure of it. I just can't
seem to think of them right
now. . . .
Rick: I think the best comment
on the movie came from the
people In front of us in the
theatre who couldn't stop cough
ing. For a movie with no sex, no
shooting deaths and no baseball
it was, well, pretty bad. I'd give it
one star for the Fabulous Thun
derbirds.
Ed: In closing, then, "Light of
Day" has a non-existent plot,
poor directing, uninspired per
formances and lousy music. I
think Rick's being too generous.
I sure hope I'm getting reim
bursed for the ticket.

Michael J. Fox and Joan Jett try to figure out just what they're doing in "Light of Day," written and
directed by Paul Schrader. The movie did have some interesting scenes; we just can't think of them
right now.
Critic's note: Due to the ap
pearance of rock star Joan Jett
in "Light oj Day," for the follow
ing review I have secured the
aid of Richard Trevor Bruiser IV.
Detroit Tigers Jan, founder of the
Clint Eastwood for President
movement and professional
heavy metal critic. Richard and
I will attempt a movie review in
dialogue form. Sort of like Siskel
and Ebert, but much better.
Ed: "Light of Day" is the story of
aspiring rock musicians Michael
J. Fox and Joan Jett, who in
their struggle for musical suc
cess tackle myriad ethical, eco
nomic and family dilemmas.
Rick: Is that what it's about? I
couldn't tell.
Ed: I think so. I have to admit,
though, that I'm not quite sure,
because basically "Light of Day"
doesn't have a plot worthy of its
name. Writer-director Paul

Schrader just follows the mind
less meanderings of whining
Patty Rasnick (Jett) and her
slightly less insipid brother Joe
(Fox) in their quasi-revolt
against suburbia, as personified
by their mother (Gina
Rowlands). And when I say
Schrader follows them, I do
mean follows; he constantly uses
walking cameras, presumably to
bring the viewer into the action.
His cameramen could take a few
lessons in technique from a TV
news crew.
Anyway, the conflict of this
movie is never clearly defined.
Patty and her mother fight con
stantly, with her mother always
telling Patty to get married.
(Patty, it turns out, has an ille
gitimate son by the local mini
ster, who happens to be a friend
of her mother.) Joe and Patty
argue over the morality of theft
and whether it's OK to have her
son Benjie participate. Patty

waxes pseudo-philosophic over
her nihilistic devotion to
rock'n'roll. In an about-face later
in the movie, when her mother
dies of cancer, Patty agrees to
join her in heaven. I found
myself praying that this last
agreement was a suicide pact. I
wasn't so lucky, and had to
watch for another 30 minutes. In
the end everyone's problems are
solved with the panacea of a
rock'n'roll performance by Joe
and Patty. Right. Just like real
life.
Rick: So, dude, who's the villain
in the movie?
Ed: The producer. And by the
way, if my plot description seems
disjointed, it's because of the
movie. What a waste of talent.
Fox makes more funny jokes in
half an episode of "Family Ties"
than he does in this entire
movie. Michael McKean of
"Spinal Tap" is poorly utilized
and makes no impact. And al

though I suspect from her
monotonous performance that
Joan Jett is a lousy actress. 1
might be wrong, because
Schrader's direction Is so poor.
I'll leave Joan Jett as performer
for Rick to criticize.
Rick: Joan Jett just can't rock
out as good as she used to. I fell
asleep during one song. Not that
Jett was ever any good. In fact,
her best song In the entire movie
is Motley Crue's "The Looks That
Kill" — played, incidentally,
during Patty's heavy metal
phase. The best performance In
the movie is by the Fabulous
Thunderbirds, who show up in
the middle for no real reason.
I have to disagree with you on
one thing, Ed. On the
Barbusters' (Joe and Patty's
band) road trip, there were some
good scenes of Kalamazoo, Mi
chigan .
Ed: Uh, yeah. Kalamazoo, the fa
mous center of Midwestern cul
ture, with the name that no one
can pronounce with a straight
face. Pretty apt commentary on
the movie, though. Pardon my
interruption.
Rick: The only good original
songs in the movie were done by
Fox. Which brings up an inter
esting point: did you notice that
all of the stars of the movie could
really play their instruments?
Ed: Wonderful. I should mention
that there were some other inter
esting parts. One scene in which
Patty's father (Jason Miller)
winds the watch of his late wife
while she's in her coffin showed
interesting technique. There
were some other interesting
parts, I'm sure of it. I just can't
seem to think of them right
now. . . .
Rick: I think the best comment
on the movie came from the
people In front of us in the
theatre who couldn't stop cough
ing. For a movie with no sex, no
shooting deaths and no baseball
it was, well, pretty bad. I'd give it
one star for the Fabulous Thun
derbirds.
Ed: In closing, then, "Light of
Day" has a non-existent plot,
poor directing, uninspired per
formances and lousy music. I
think Rick's being too generous.
I sure hope I'm getting reim
bursed for the ticket.
