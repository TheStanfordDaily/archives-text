# A 						surprising 'Winter'
## 
### MACKINLAY POLHEMUS 
Like most mystery/suspense
films, "Dead of Winter" tries to use
Hitchcock scare tactics in original
ways. An isolated house on a
stormy night, a car that won't
start, downed telephone lines and
people who jump out of hidden
places make for a typical suspense
movie, and they all appear in
"Dead of Winter." Although the
scary scenes are predictable, they
are used in a believable scenario
that makes this movie both
original and successful.
Kate McGovern (Mary Steenbur
gen) answers producer Thomas
Murray's (Roddy McDowall) news
paper ad calling for an actress to
be in a key movie role. When she's
offered the role, she goes to the al

leged producer's house to be made
over to fit the part. Once there,
she finds that she's not only
trapped in the house (that darn
storm) but also trapped in her role
(those darn psychopathic killers).
Slowly, frightening details ac
cumulate and she realizes that
Murray the producer is very
strange. She has some key clues.
The tone and accent of his voice
bear a striking resemblance to
Dracula's. His topic of conversa
tion always involves hunting or
dead things, and he often laughs
out of context (he bursts out
laughing when a mousetrap snaps
and kills a mouse). He also burns
all her identification. All this adds
to her growing fear and suspicion.

Mary Steenburgen plays three roles in "Dead of Winter," at one point
appearing as both killer and victim on the same screen.
At times, the plot does lose its
credibility. Steenburgen plays
three different characters; at one
point she's both a killer and a vic
tim on the same screen. 1 hate
that. It defies common sense. Why
not just hire another actress and
leave the intrusive technical
wizardry for sci-fi movies? But I
must credit Steenburgen for her
convincing portrayals of both
characters. I would have believed
they were different persons if they
didn't look exactly the same.
As the movie progresses, it gets
more believable and scary. Kate
McGovern finds a phone in the at
tic that actually works. Unlike any
other horror/suspense movie I've
seen, McGovern calls the police
and — even more surprisingly —
they come. During horror movies,
how many times do you catch
yourself saying, "Why doesn't she
just call the police?" or "Why
doesn't she just use the knife?" or
"Why doesn't she just leave?"

During "Dead of Winter" I asked
all these questions. And the Kate
McGovern character did every
thing she was supposed to. She
exhausted all my great ideas, and
still nothing worked.
The police arrive and McGovern
screams that she's in danger, and
even has bodily evidence to prove
that her captors have hurt her.
End of movie? No. Thanks to
some quick thinking by mad psy
chiatrist Dr. Lewis (Jan Rubes),
the police think that she's one of
his hysterical patients. He has her
psychiatric record with her photo
to prove it. You know you're
watching a good horror movie
when even the good old men in
blue can't save the victim.
At this point I asked, "Why
doesn't she tell them about the
dead body in the attic?" Well, she
does. The police check the attic,
only to find that the body has
curiously disappeared. This dead
body moves around the house so
much it seems to be more mobile
than the killer himself.
The movie is entertaining be
cause the killers possess interest
ing psychopathic quirks that are

truly frightening. The crazy doctor
has a gizmo that causes his piano
to play when his heart beats too
fast; you can imagine the mo
ments when it begins to play.
McDowall plays Murray, the al
leged producer who is really a
devoted ex-patient of the psychia
trist and will do anything — and
that means anything — to please
him. He plays the character much
like Anthony Perkins' in "Psycho,"
only better.
Before it's revealed that he's
crazy, he brings some warm milk
up to McGovern. Making con
versation, she says, "Dr. Lewis
really seems to like you." He
replies, "Do you think so? Oh,
that makes me so happy." A nor
mal enough line, except that
McDowell moves about 20 differ
ent facial muscles while saying it.
McDowell is a first-rate actor and a
truly convincing loony here.
The end of the movie has an
original twist. 1 won't give away
any more than I already have, but
believe me, "Dead of Winter" has
plenty of surprises for even the
most seasoned mystery/suspense
film buffs.

must credit Steenburgen for her
convincing portrayals of both
characters. I would have believed
they were different persons if they
didn't look exactly the same.
As the movie progresses, it gets
more believable and scary. Kate
McGovern finds a phone in the at
tic that actually works. Unlike any
other horror/suspense movie I've
seen, McGovern calls the police
and — even more surprisingly —
they come. During horror movies,
how many times do you catch
yourself saying, "Why doesn't she
just call the police?" or "Why
doesn't she just use the knife?" or
"Why doesn't she just leave?"

During "Dead of Winter" I asked
all these questions. And the Kate
McGovern character did every
thing she was supposed to. She
exhausted all my great ideas, and
still nothing worked.
The police arrive and McGovern
screams that she's in danger, and
even has bodily evidence to prove
that her captors have hurt her.
End of movie? No. Thanks to
some quick thinking by mad psy
chiatrist Dr. Lewis (Jan Rubes),
the police think that she's one of
his hysterical patients. He has her
psychiatric record with her photo
to prove it. You know you're
watching a good horror movie
when even the good old men in
blue can't save the victim.
At this point I asked, "Why
doesn't she tell them about the
dead body in the attic?" Well, she
does. The police check the attic,
only to find that the body has
curiously disappeared. This dead
body moves around the house so
much it seems to be more mobile
than the killer himself.
The movie is entertaining be
cause the killers possess interest
ing psychopathic quirks that are

truly frightening. The crazy doctor
has a gizmo that causes his piano
to play when his heart beats too
fast; you can imagine the mo
ments when it begins to play.
McDowall plays Murray, the al
leged producer who is really a
devoted ex-patient of the psychia
trist and will do anything — and
that means anything — to please
him. He plays the character much
like Anthony Perkins' in "Psycho,"
only better.
Before it's revealed that he's
crazy, he brings some warm milk
up to McGovern. Making con
versation, she says, "Dr. Lewis
really seems to like you." He
replies, "Do you think so? Oh,
that makes me so happy." A nor
mal enough line, except that
McDowell moves about 20 differ
ent facial muscles while saying it.
McDowell is a first-rate actor and a
truly convincing loony here.
The end of the movie has an
original twist. 1 won't give away
any more than I already have, but
believe me, "Dead of Winter" has
plenty of surprises for even the
most seasoned mystery/suspense
film buffs.

She wouldn't be smiling if she knew what she was in for. Pictured above are Jan Rubes, Roddy McDowall
and Mary Steenburgen in the frightening new movie "Dead of Winter."
Like most mystery/suspense
films, "Dead of Winter" tries to use
Hitchcock scare tactics in original
ways. An isolated house on a
stormy night, a car that won't
start, downed telephone lines and
people who jump out of hidden
places make for a typical suspense
movie, and they all appear in
"Dead of Winter." Although the
scary scenes are predictable, they
are used in a believable scenario
that makes this movie both
original and successful.
Kate McGovern (Mary Steenbur
gen) answers producer Thomas
Murray's (Roddy McDowall) news
paper ad calling for an actress to
be in a key movie role. When she's
offered the role, she goes to the al

leged producer's house to be made
over to fit the part. Once there,
she finds that she's not only
trapped in the house (that darn
storm) but also trapped in her role
(those darn psychopathic killers).
Slowly, frightening details ac
cumulate and she realizes that
Murray the producer is very
strange. She has some key clues.
The tone and accent of his voice
bear a striking resemblance to
Dracula's. His topic of conversa
tion always involves hunting or
dead things, and he often laughs
out of context (he bursts out
laughing when a mousetrap snaps
and kills a mouse). He also burns
all her identification. All this adds
to her growing fear and suspicion.

Mary Steenburgen plays three roles in "Dead of Winter," at one point
appearing as both killer and victim on the same screen.
At times, the plot does lose its
credibility. Steenburgen plays
three different characters; at one
point she's both a killer and a vic
tim on the same screen. 1 hate
that. It defies common sense. Why
not just hire another actress and
leave the intrusive technical
wizardry for sci-fi movies? But I
must credit Steenburgen for her
convincing portrayals of both
characters. I would have believed
they were different persons if they
didn't look exactly the same.
