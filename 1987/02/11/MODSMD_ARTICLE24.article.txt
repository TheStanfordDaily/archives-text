Like most mystery/suspense
films, "Dead of Winter" tries to use
Hitchcock scare tactics in original
ways. An isolated house on a
stormy night, a car that won't
start, downed telephone lines and
people who jump out of hidden
places make for a typical suspense
movie, and they all appear in
"Dead of Winter." Although the
scary scenes are predictable, they
are used in a believable scenario
that makes this movie both
original and successful.
Kate McGovern (Mary Steenbur
gen) answers producer Thomas
Murray's (Roddy McDowall) news
paper ad calling for an actress to
be in a key movie role. When she's
offered the role, she goes to the al

leged producer's house to be made
over to fit the part. Once there,
she finds that she's not only
trapped in the house (that darn
storm) but also trapped in her role
(those darn psychopathic killers).
Slowly, frightening details ac
cumulate and she realizes that
Murray the producer is very
strange. She has some key clues.
The tone and accent of his voice
bear a striking resemblance to
Dracula's. His topic of conversa
tion always involves hunting or
dead things, and he often laughs
out of context (he bursts out
laughing when a mousetrap snaps
and kills a mouse). He also burns
all her identification. All this adds
to her growing fear and suspicion.
