# Winger's 'Widow': Excruciating to watch
## 
### JAMES LUJAN Editorial Staff 
Sometimes it's really difficult to sit in a theatre and
watch a movie fail when you know there was a lot of
talent involved in putting it together. Such is the
case with "Black Widow." I walked in expecting great
things from director Bob Rafelson ("Five Easy Pieces"
and"The King of Marvin Gardens") and two-time Os
car nominee Debra Winger ("An Officer and a
Gentleman" and "Terms of Endearment"). Unfortun
ately, I left the theatre amazed that so much talent
could produce so little.
The lapses in the story line are what make this a
truly excruciating movie to watch. It alternates be
tween periods of dullness and implausibility. The
plot of the movie goes something like this: There's
this computer expert named Alex Barnes (Debra
Winger) who workes for the Justice Department. She
suspects something fishy is going on after a series of
wealthy men begin to die one right after another.
Sure enough, after looking at photographs of these
men and their wives. Winger notices that the wife of
all of them is the same person. She brings this infor
mation to her supervisor (Terry O'Quinn), but he
doesn't think the women look anything alike; he just
thinks that Winger is going off the deep end because
she doesn't have a sex life.
Of course. Winger is right and she eventually
becomes obsessed with tracking down the mur
deress (played with eye-opening intensity by Theresa
Russell). She ends up following Russell to Hawaii,
where they become good friends and fall in love with
the same man for some reason. With this, there are
some psychological implications thrown around that
Russell is the key to our heroine's sexual awakening,
or something like that. The movie finally concludes

with a cheap, cheap, cheap ending that any pulp
detective writer could have improved upon.
The lame screenplay by Ronald Bass occasionally
shows some flashes of promise, but it never follows
through on the situations it sets up. For example,
there is a bit about Winger trying to think like Rus
sell thinks, to understand why she does what she
does — a territory that was covered much better in
Michael Mann's "Manhunter." That whole premise,
however, is dropped.
Another annoying aspect to the movie is that we
never get to understand the characters' motivations
for their actions. We never do find out what makes
Russell's character tick. In fact, we never find out
what makes Winger's character tick, either. All we
know is that she's a sexually repressed federal agent
who becomes inexplicably obsessed with finding
Russell and goes as far as chucking her career and
selling all her possessions to track down Russell in
Hawaii.
One of the real disappointments of the film is
Debra Winger. Here, all she does is reprise her
patented tough, feisty heroine performance. Come
on, Debra, do something different for a change. We
all know you've got spunk, but there's no need to play
the same part in every movie.
The only good thing about the movie is Theresa
Russell as the sexy, cunning and psychologically dis
turbed murderess. Russell doesn't really have much
material to work with here and her performance
sometimes borders on stoicism, but she infuses her
role with a forceful, magnetic presence that no direc
tor or writer could have given her.
Ultimately, though, Russell only steals the movie
from Winger; she can't save it."The Black Widow" is
a movie — and an insect too, for that matter — to be
avoided.

turbed murderess. Russell doesn't really have much
material to work with here and her performance
sometimes borders on stoicism, but she infuses her
role with a forceful, magnetic presence that no direc
tor or writer could have given her.
Ultimately, though, Russell only steals the movie
from Winger; she can't save it."The Black Widow" is
a movie — and an insect too, for that matter — to be
avoided.

Another handshake. Pictured above are Sami Frey, Theresa Russell and Debra Winger in "Black Widow."
Russell plays her seductive murderess role with eye-opening intensity, but even she can't save this
movie.
