## Stanford netters easily cruise through Pacific

Remaining unbeaten In singles action
this season, the Stanford women's tennis
team roared past Pacific 9-0 yesterday at
Stockton.
The No. 1 ranked Cardinal, playing
without standout Patty Fendick. raised
its 1987 dual match record to 3-0. The
team has won all 18 singles matches and
eight of nine doubles duals this season.
Despite the final score, UOP did not fall
easily, taking Stanford to three sets on
three occasions and forcing the Cardinal
into two tiebreakers. "They played very
well, and we played very well." Stanford
Coach Frank Brennan said.
Senior Stephanie Savides, taking Fen
dick's No. 1 singles spot, survived a
second-set tiebreaker to defeat UOP's
Leslie Powell 6-1, 7-6.
Savides missed the Cardinal's dual
match last Friday against UC-Irvine be
cause she was in Richmond, Va., for the
Rolex National Indoor Intercollegiate. She
lost twice in Virginia, but the experience
was good nevertheless, according to Bren
nan. "It was nice for her to be in that com
pany back East," he said.
Stanford sophomore Kay Tittle, who
was erratic against Irvine, struggled
again yesterday before pulling out a 3-6,

6-0, 6-4 win over the Tigers' Kristi Kern in
the No. 2 singles.
"She (Tittle) played pretty well,'' Bren
nan said. "She hasn't been tip-top health
wise. She's just a half a step here and a
little bit there."
Freshman Lisa Green was a little bit
overwhelming yesterday in the No. 3
singles match, downing UOP's Tiffany Lee
6-0, 6-2.
Junior Carl Hagey was equally impres
sive for the Cardinal, scoring a 6-3, 6-4
victory over Julie Fairchild in the No. 4
singles. "I thought she (Hagey) played the
best match I've seen her play in a long,
long time," Brennan said. "1 don't know if
she's played better than that before."
Not to be outdone by her teammates,
freshman Valerie Wilson crushed UOP's
Paige Jackson 6-1, 6-0 in the No. 5 singles
match.
The most exciting match of the day was
down at No. 6 singles, where Stanford's
Cindy Buchsbaum rallied from four
match points to defeat the Tigers' Julie
DeArmond 1-6, 6-2, 7-5.
As the score indicates, Buchsbaum was
blown out in the first set. "Buchsbaum
couldn't hit the broad side of a barn in the
first set," Brennan said. "Slowly but
surely she got her poise."
The Stanford sophomore won the
second set fairly easily, but then found

herself trailing 5-4 in the third set and
down 3-0 in the 10th game. Buchsbaum
survived, however, as DeArmond lost the
next four points. "More accurately. Cindy
won it (the 10th game)." Brennan said.
"There were no double faults, no errors.
They were long rallies."
The match was not over, though, as the
score was knotted at 5-5. "She
(Buchsbaum) had to hold serve, which
had been tough for her." Brennan said.
Buchsbaum did just that, and then
broke DeArmond's serve to take the
match.
The Stanford doubles teams also swept
the Tigers yesterday. Tittle and Green
rallied for a 3-6, 6-1. 6-2 victory over
Powell and Kern at No. 1. Hagey and Wil
son knocked off Lee and Jackson 7-6, 6-3
at No. 2, and Buchsbaum and Savides
rolled past Fairchild and Michelle Mat
sumura 6-3, 6-2 in the No. 3 match.
Card notes
Fendick missed her first match of the season
yesterday after playing Monday night in the
Virginia Slims of California in San Francisco.
The defending NCAA champion took second
seeded Kathy Rinaldi to three sets before
losing Monday by a 4-6, 7-5, 6-0 score.
"She played a very, very good first set, a
pretty good second set, and then she just ran
out of gas," Brennan said.
