# Coyle set to join Stanford skating elite
## 
### MARK SMOYER Staff writer 
There are three Stanford students who
have a lot In common. Two are world fa
mous; one is a virtual unknown. They
are Debl Thomas, Eric Helden and John
Coyle.
All three have spent a great deal of
time on ice. Thomas and Coyle skate at
the same rink and had an English class
together last quarter. Heiden is and
Coyle will be world-class in the same two
sports. Coyle stayed with Heiden when
visiting the campus last year. Coyle's
home phone number is the same as
Heiden's number here at Stanford.
Thomas is a sophomore and the reign
ing World Figure Skating champion.
Heiden swept the speed skating medals
at the 1980 Winter Olympics, is among
the nation's top cyclists and is a student
at Stanford Medical School. Coyle is a
freshman and perhaps the nation's top
indoor speed skater. He is also the Na
tional Intermediate Outdoor Speed
Skating champion and a former member
of the 7-Eleven junior cycling team, and
he turned down an offer to be on their
senior team.
Newspapers all over the world have
run stories on Heiden and Thomas. Not
many have chronicled the exploits of
Coyle. He is the nations youngest stand
out in a sport that he believes will catch
fire and become popular when it is
showcased for the first time at the 1988
Winter Olympics in Calgary in its debut
as an Olympic event. Coyle may be the

best outdoor speed skater in the nation
under the age of 19 and he may have
made thousands of dollars cycling on the
national circuit this summer, but these
are mere hobbies in relation to his pas
sion and talent for the sport of indoor
speed skating.
The simplest method of explaining in
door racing is with a comparison to a
track race. The skaters start in a pack
and, at the gun, begin racing around an
oval of ice. Covering distances ranging
from 500 to 3,000 meters, the skaters
must not only combat the slickness of
the ice and the physics of circling a nar
row 100-meter ellipse at speeds of up to
27 mph, but they must — as in track —
strategically race their competition.
On the track, runners will set the
pace, hang in the back of the pack, surge
occasionally to the lead or get in position
to sprint to the finish line. To do these
things effectively, they must dodge
spikes, change direction quickly, endure
elbows and shoves and change speed
drastically in a split-second. These same
things must be done by speed skaters —
but on skates, on ice. Falls are frequent,
and one fall means a lost race.
While Coyle boasts impressive creden
tials on the outdoor rink and the
velodrome, it Is on the indoor ice that he
has been most impressive, though a
little unlucky. He started skating in his
hometown of West Bloomfield, Mich., six
years ago to supplement his cycling
training. By 1983, at the age of 14. he
was good enough to finish 16th in the
U.S. trials for the World Championships.

There, in his first major competition, his
aggressive style was already quite
developed, but not quite perfected.
"The judge called me a kamikaze,"
Coyle says. "My first two races I took
everybody down."

In 1984, he knew he was good, but at
the Nationals he met misfortune, some
thing he still has yet to avoid at the U.S.
Championships. "I thought I was going
to win the Nationals, because I had been
winning all my races, and I got to the Na
tionals and pulled a muscle," Coyle says.

The next year, Coyle made the four
man American world team. He was only
16 years old, the youngest person ever to
make the U.S. squad. Poor scheduling
had the Nationals conflicting with the
Worlds, however, and once again Coyle
— undeniably the best in his age group
and one of the four best in the country —
missed out on the U.S. Championships.
"We were leaving for the Worlds during
the second day of the Nationals, so I
went to the first day and won two races.
Then I had to leave, so I guess I got
third."
Coyle doesn't let on any bitterness
about his bad luck; he is actually quite
casual about everything to do with some
thing as intense as athletic competition
on an international level. For example,
he is unsure of the when and where of
the most important meets — such as the
Olympic trials — in each sport. He has
been training on the ice only once a week
this winter. This informality, combined
with the distractions of being a teenager
and going to college — something few
other skaters or cyclists do — will be an
advantage down the road. Burn-out will
not be as much of a factor, he says.
We're not finished, however, with the
road already traveled. After the unevent
ful World Championships in the Nether
lands, 1986 came along, and with it a
couple more mishaps.
At the U.S. trials for the Worlds, Coyle
was disqualified in one of the prelimi
nary races, yet still managed to finish

fifth as the national team's alternate.
Then came the dreaded U.S. Champion
ships. "I fell (in) three out of five races
and won the other two. . . . Two of the
times I fell I was within 50 feet of the
finish line in first place."
Coyle says there are similarities and
differences between indoor and outdoor
skating. "The technique is pretty similar
but you don't have to be as low indoors,
because there is no wind," Coyle says.
"Also, the turns are a lot different be
cause you get a lot of centrifugal force in
doors."
You don't have to understand
centrifugal force to understand that
going around a sharp corner at 25 mph
is tough. "Your legs get really tired,"
Coyle says. "You don't really get that out
of breath at all, but when you go around
those corners it feels like you've got 600
pounds on your back."
And it's not just that you have 600
pounds on your back. Indoor speed
skating is not just two fellows skating on
different sides of a line dividing a 400-
meter ice track, like you've seen on TV.
It's a packed group of skaters wearing
knee pads and helmets looking for an op
portunity to cut one another off.
"There's a lot of body contact — it seems
like I get disqualified every other race,"
Coyle says.
If he's not disqualified, he still might
fall. But when John Coyle doesn't fall, he
almost always wins. He is a sure bet to be
an Olympian in 1988.
