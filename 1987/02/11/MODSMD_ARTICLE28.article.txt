## 
### JON WEISMAN Staff writer 
When you're struggling a little,
when you're in a rut. sometimes it
helps to get away from it all. That's
about the condition the Stanford
men's tennis team was in.and it
found San Jose State a relaxing
vacation spot. The Cardinal raised
tts record to 3-1 with a 7-1 win
over the Spartans, its easiest win
of the year.
For the first time this year.
Stanford swept all six of its singles
matches, and there was even im
proved play in doubles, the Card
inal's Achilles' heel this season.
"There was no single bad match
for us." Stanford Coach Dick
Gould said. "The matches were all
pretty routine."
Playing No. 1 for the second
straight match in place of the
injured Patrick McEnroe. Jeff
Tarango defeated SJSU's Allen
Malcolm. 7-5. 2-6, 7-6 (8-6). It was
the second straight match
Tarango won in a third-set tie
breaker.
Tarango had a 4-1 lead in the
first set. but let Malcolm close the
gap by twice losing games he was
one point away from winning.
Gould commented that those
games seemed to give Malcolm
confidence that buoyed him to his
second-set victory in which he
"outplayed Jeff in the backcourt."
"Jeff had to slow it down and at
tack when the opportunity pre
sented Itself." said Gould, who
also noted that Tarango was able
to get Malcolm out of the groove he
was in bv serve-and- volleying and

changing the pace of his shots to
the backcourt.
"Jeff didn't have any concentra
tion lapses in this match." Gould
said. "He beat a bona fide player."
Freshman Jeff Cathrall, playing
No. 2, ran his season record to 3-1
with a 7-5, 6-2 win over the Spar
tans' Tom Sheehan, who Gould
said has always been tough
against Stanford.
Geordie McKee almost had a
deja vu experience like Tarango's.
Last Friday against Rollins Col
lege. McKee won the first set but
lost a tough second set and let the
win get away from him.
Yesterday against Paul Carbone,
McKee again won the first set,
broke to get a lead in the second
set. but then lost that lead. This
time, however. McKee toughed it
out to nab the win. 6-3. 7-5.
"Geordie started off very well,"
Gould said, "The other guy got
back in the match. ... To his
credit, he was able to get back in
the match which last week got
away from him. and did it on a
foreign court."
Scott Moody also enjoyed Stan
ford's vacation, defeating SJSU's
Gary Peralta. 6-3, 6-2.
"Moody started slowly but found
out how to play the guy," Gould
said.
Completing Stanford's singles
sweep were two rookie players who
have yet to lose in their young
careers. Freshman Barry Richards
netted his fourth straight victory,
over Ristow Moilanen. 6-1. 6-4.
