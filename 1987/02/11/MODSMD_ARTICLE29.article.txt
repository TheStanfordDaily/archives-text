# SF State visits Sunken Diamond
## 
### TOM SENF Editorial staff 
Right now. the Stanford
baseball team needs more pitch
ing about as much as Michael Jor
dan needs a couple more inches
on his vertical leap, bu* the
already strong Cardinal staff will
now be even stronger with the
return of preseason All-American
Jack McDowell.
McDowell, a second-team All-
America and first-team All-Pacific
10 Southern Division selection
last year, will be on the mound
today when Stanford meets San
Francisco State in a 2 p.m contest
at Sunken Diamond.
The hard-throwing junior right
hander has not pitched com
petitively since last season,
remaining inactive during the
summer and fall due to a sore
shoulder. When practice began In
January, the shoulder was
healthy, but McDowell pulled a
groin muscle and was sidelined
again.
Anyone who wants to see the
Cardinal ace in action today
should not plan on coming late.
"He'll go two or three innings,
then we'll probably bring him
back on Monday (against Fresno
State)." Stanford Coach Mark
Marquess said. "We'll be keeping
track of his pitches."
Keeping track of the pitches
thrown by the Cardinal has
proven to be a difficult task for op
posing batters in the first seven
games. The Stanford hurlers have
limited their opponents to a .204
batting average and one home
run. The Cardinal has a team ERA

Jack McDowell, a second team Ail-American last year when he was 11-4 with a 2.51 ERA, will get his first
start of the season today against San Francisco State.
