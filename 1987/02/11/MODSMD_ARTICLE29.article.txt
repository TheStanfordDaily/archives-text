# SF State visits Sunken Diamond
## 
### TOM SENF Editorial staff 
Right now. the Stanford
baseball team needs more pitch
ing about as much as Michael Jor
dan needs a couple more inches
on his vertical leap, bu* the
already strong Cardinal staff will
now be even stronger with the
return of preseason All-American
Jack McDowell.
McDowell, a second-team All-
America and first-team All-Pacific
10 Southern Division selection
last year, will be on the mound
today when Stanford meets San
Francisco State in a 2 p.m contest
at Sunken Diamond.
The hard-throwing junior right
hander has not pitched com
petitively since last season,
remaining inactive during the
summer and fall due to a sore
shoulder. When practice began In
January, the shoulder was
healthy, but McDowell pulled a
groin muscle and was sidelined
again.
Anyone who wants to see the
Cardinal ace in action today
should not plan on coming late.
"He'll go two or three innings,
then we'll probably bring him
back on Monday (against Fresno
State)." Stanford Coach Mark
Marquess said. "We'll be keeping
track of his pitches."
Keeping track of the pitches
thrown by the Cardinal has
proven to be a difficult task for op
posing batters in the first seven
games. The Stanford hurlers have
limited their opponents to a .204
batting average and one home
run. The Cardinal has a team ERA

of 2.00; the school record is 1.68
set in 1968.
Stanford, 5-2 overall, is coming
off a three-game series at No. 16
Fullerton State in which it won
two. "I was pleased with it,"
Marquess said. "Fullerton is a
good team, nationally ranked.
Beating them down there is
tough."

Even though it is averaging
nearly seven runs per game, the
Cardinal is hitting just .254 as a
team, but Marquess is not overly
concerned.
"We've faced real good pitching."
he said. "(Fullerton's Mike) Harkey
is probably the No. 1 prospect in
the nation. He didn't get the loss
(in Stanford's 6-5 win last Friday),
but we had a 4-0 lead against him.
We've also faced Anthony Telford
{of San Jose State). I hate to think
that's the kind of pitching we'll
face all year."

The Cardinal may be up against
another tough hurler today, as
San Francisco State Coach Mi
chael Simpson is likely to go with
senior John Wilson. Wilson was
11-0 last year with a 3.13 ERA and
was named a Division II All-
American.
Simpson was a huge success in
his first year at San Francisco
State, guiding the Gators to the
Northern California Athletic Con
ference title and a 27-15 overall
record. Included among those 27
wins was a 6-5 home victory over

Stanford.
Not surprisingly, Marquess is
not taking the Gators lightly.
"They're considered to be one of
the strongest teams in Division
II," he said. "They beat us last
year, and baseball people say
they're even better this year. We're
not going to overlook them or take
them for granted. We'll have our
hands full, but we'll be ready."
Card notes
Stanford has been rained out five
times this season, and Marquess lears
another postponement today.
