The Board of Trustees yesterday raised

and board 5.4 percent, increasing the
combined total by $927 to $16,835.
Undergraduate tuition will be $11,880.
Room and board will be $4,955.
Graduate tuition will increase faster in
the School of Engineering than in any other
school, with a 9.7 percent rise. The lowest
tuition increase will be the Law School's,
which will rise 5.8 percent.
The board approved increases for:
□ General graduate tuition, from $11,208
to $11,880;
□ School of Medicine tuition, from $13,440
to $14,535;
□ Gradute tuition in the School of Engi
neering, from $11,358 to $12,465;

$12,180 next year; and
□ Graduate School of Business tuition,
from $12,102 to $12,960.
Tuition payments are the largest single
source of funds for the University's annual
operating budget. In the 1985-86 budget,
42.8 percent of operating revenues came
from tuition payments.
The operating budget pays for instruc
tion, student support services, financial
aid, libraries, and operations and mainte
nance.
According to a report submitted to the
trustees, three factors were considered in
evaluating next year's budgetary needs: the
needs of the academic program, Stanford's
position "in the marketplace of potential
tuition payers," and Stanford's position "in
the market of public trust and opinion."
To maintain the academic program, the
University must continue to attract out
standing faculty, according to the report,
which is compiled by the Office of Public Af
fairs. Keeping salaries competitive, the
report says, "will require increases above
inflation."
Other 1987-88 costs related to the aca
demic program will be the Centennial fund
raising campaign, enhancements in ad
ministrative and educational computing,
and changes in federal tax laws.
In the market for potential students,

"(Stanford's) tuition increases of recent
years, when combined with our need-blind
financial aid policies, have not affected our
ability to draw a diverse group of students."
the report says."It is fair to say that the
numbers and the kinds of students at
tracted to Stanford have been remarkably
impressive in recent years."
Offsetting increases in student charges
have been increases in disposable personal
income, according to the report. In the last
20 years, "student charges have grown at
8.9 percent, while disposable income has
grown at 9.1 percent.
"From 1981-86, however, student
charges have moved more rapidly than dis
posable income, 10.8 percent to 7 percent,"
the report says.
But that difference came during the early
years of this decade, while in the past two
years, the growth rates have been closer,
the report says.
In the "marketplace of public opinion,"
the University's position "is clearly not as
strong as it is in the marketplace for tuition
payers," according to the report.
Higher education has recently "seen
growing criticism from a number of quar
ters about the costs of higher eduction, as
well as calls to reform the kind of education
provided."
"We need to be mindful of the criticisms
expressed over the prices we charge, while
recognizing that they should not deter us
unduly from seeking the resources neces
sary to continue to provide the highest
quality education," the report says.
In other business yesterday, the Board
authorized the vice president for business
and finance to negotiate a lease on a hotel to
be located south of Sand Hill Road near In
terstate 280.
The University is negotiating with the
Westin Hotel Company of Seattle. Kent
Peterson, associate vice president for busi
ness affairs, said the negotiations will take
several weeks.
After a lease is signed, the hotel must
receive approval from the city of Menlo
Park. The approval process could take "a
year or so," Peterson said.
The hotel as proposed would have about
300 rooms.
