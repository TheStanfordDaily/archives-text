# ASSU NEWS presents
## LOVE, INTIMACY, AND MEANINGLESS RELATIONSHIPS VALENTINE ME PLEASE 
### 
These groups are applying for funding for 1987-88. These are two ways you can get money
from the ASSU: (1) You can get a Special Fee for large amounts ($6,000-$80,000+); or (2)
Apply to Program/Publication Board for lesser amounts.
SPECIAL FEES
These are Special Fee requests, which you can vote on in April.
If you vote for all of these, ASSU fees would go to $22 per quarter (we pay out all the fees
back to student groups.) But before the get to the ballot the Senate can screw with them a
whole lot, so they will not be quite (half?) this big.
Many people will love if you vote for these groups, and ;you will receive many valentines in
the mail.
