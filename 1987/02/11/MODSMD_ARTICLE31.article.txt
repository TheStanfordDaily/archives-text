# Program Board Requests
## 
### 
The Program Board gives out money in cycles all tnrough the year so that student groups have some
flexibility in cash (they only have to wait six weeks instead of nine months).
Students vote on how much TOTAL money the Board gives out — there is a "base amount" of Program
Board, and you get to vote the base up or down — and the Board decides how to divide ti among groups
like the following. This is what they all applied for. By the way, these groups will probably get only about
half of what they ask for, because that is all therte will probably be.
Some of these guys were not too clued in and applied for like twelve times the amount of money they can
get. Don't worry, we will be sure to ruthlessly embarrass them when they come in to interview.
