Lena Slachmjuilder. Student Athletics Committee
Ben Garcia. ASSU Senate
Steven Stanford. Inter-Fraternity Council
Eseryone got to speak and we took notes on how students can have influence because it's about time
we figured it out. The administrators gave us some terrific advice: If you want to have influence on the
University policy, you must have a large gun It would also help to:
Find out who makes the decisions.
Alt's not always the person you think — Don takes a day off sometimes — and it's often a whole
group of people
Find out how the decision is supposed to he made
Is it a routine problem whose solution will get handled bv the stalP Is it a policy decision that will
need to originate with a committee 1 Or does it not fall under any caiegorv —isit a decision for
which no process exists yet. and for which special groups will have to come together in the men's
john outside Building 10 in the middle ol the night 1
Be clued to what's going on.
Keep meeting with eseryone who will talk to you about your issue, and scan everything from
Campus Report to committee minutes The staff has all the inside information: if you can get at
least some of it thev will siari to take you seriously
Learn what rules the hlg guvs have to play by.
What can thes do and not do in theii jobs 1 What's their role, and who's looking oser their
shoulder — that is to say, how much can you realistically hope foi from them 1
Use the right tactics for the right times.
Can you handle it calm and cool, and do you have time 1 Write well-reasoned letters, set up
meetings with the key people and keep it up until it's over or you expire (crapshoot which
one 1 ! Or are you confrontational and at a roadblock 1 Petitions and protests may be the wav to go
But you have to decide which before you start
