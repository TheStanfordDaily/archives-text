# We Get Letters, Too
## 
### 
Dear ASSU News,
I never thought that your forum letters were real until my ex
perience at LOTS II last week. I consider myself a very well
rounded, attractive girl and I have many male friends (my C.S.
108 C TA is just a womderful guy). I was experimenting with a
new interface that I had been playing with for the past week,
when suddenly I was greeted through my screen by a stimulating
message, signed by S. Swinger. He sounded wonderful. With my
heart throbbing and my lips beginning to purse with the presage
of passion, I abandoned my interface to respond to his pulsating
message. Breathing heavily, I could just imagine his large firm
hands caressing a responding keyboard with care. I moaned with
pleasure as this mysterious sender shot his cursor all over my
screen. He was incredible. He was driving it faster and faster, put
ting me into a frenzy. I gagged several times, but I didn't care, for
I was so involved with what I was doing and what was being
done to my screen. By now, I was panting and sweating as my
hands crept nearer to the vibrant keyboard. I was ready to ex
plode; I desperately wanted this stranger to come into my heated
terminal area. The cursor was going wild now, as he shot an array
of electrifying currents through my monitor. I couldn't take it
anymore; I was jumping uncontrollably. I had to respond. What
should I say? My head was spinning with delight as I reached for
the keys with my sweltering fingers. I was out of control...hot
with passion. ..I couldn't hold back...And then...And then...lt
happened...LOTS crashed.
My feelings were mixed. I had lived through the most exciting
moment of my life. Yet I felt so lonely. I am still seasrching for the
mysterious sender, but even if I never hear from him again, I am
grateful for the memory he has provided me. HAPPY
VALENTINES DAY, S. SWINGER.
