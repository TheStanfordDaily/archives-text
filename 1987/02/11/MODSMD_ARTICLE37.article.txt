So you twist your ankle playing ultimate frisbee and go to the
training room to have it taped, and lo and behold they've run out
of trainers. Why? Because the Athletic Department has a budget
deficit. Or you're on the field hockey team and every Sunday in
stead of resting from your game on Saturday, you're picking up
garbage for 6 hours after the football game in order to raise
money to rent buses for away games. Why? BECAUSE THE ATH
LETIC DEPT IS HAVING MONEY PROBLEMS!
We're the STUDENT ATHLETIC COMMITTEE, and our pur
pose is to survey the finances of the department and see what can
be done to improve this awful mess. So...we want YOUR HELP to
HELP US to HELP THEM, got it? And, we've got the support of
many qualified people, including professors and outside consul
tants...so this is something that is surely going to happen in a very
professional fashion! So now you can sprint to the Senate of
fice in the ASSU and sign up to help out in an area that will
clearly serve your interests and those of any student-athlete of
any level here at Stanford! After all, if you play soccer, lacrosse,
tennis, water polo, football rugby, Softball, or any other sport at
Stanford...YOU HAVE AN INTEREST IN THIS ISSUE!!! And
if you want to know even more about SAC, call Lena at 328-
9241. Thanks for reading all this.
