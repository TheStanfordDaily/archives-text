# Regaining his old confidence, Taylor adjusts to starting role
## 
### LINDA DODGE 
Sophomore guard Terry Taylor has
patiently adapted to Stanford. He Is happy to
be getting B's. He doesn't score as many
points as he did In the past. And he Is glad
just to be starting for the Cardinal this year.
Quite a change from Terry Taylor in high
school: Colorado Player of the Year, Converse
All-American, state scoring leader and class
valedictorian at Rangeview High School in

the Denver suburb of Aurora.
"I went from being Mr. World to just
mediocre," Taylor said, his eyes lighting up
from beneath a Stanford baseball cap. "Our
team won state, so I used to be stuck up. like
how most big jocks are — popular. Everyone
would always come up to me and say hi."
Then Taylor arrived at Stanford, only to
discover that he was no longer a star. He
blended into the mass of overachievers.
People no longer sought him out. And his
competition for the point guard position

never amounted to any competition at all —
the job already belonged to three-year starter
Keith Ramee, who held the position all
season.
Taylor's father, Terry Sr., was also his high
school coach, and he said Taylor had always
been realistic. "We prepared him." he said.
"Terry knew that there were a lot of good
players already there. He knew that he had to
pay his dues."
Knowing that didn't make it easier for
Taylor, however. But instead of remaining
unhappy, Taylor decided to wait his turn.
"I learned a lot from Keith last year." he
said. "And 1 learned sitting on the bench was
not fun. I was going to do whatever I had to
do to get more minutes or to start."
Autographed basketball hero posters, as
well as pictures of his girlfriend and family,
engulf the walls of his dorm room. By the
sheer number of them, there is a feeling that
these things are all important to him, be
cause everything about him has a definite
place and purpose.
A sense of purpose characterizes the inten
sity with which Taylor sought the starting
point guard spot this season. Of course,
Ramee's graduation and the decision of
quarterback John Paye to concentrate on
football didn't hurt his chances, but Taylor
was taking nothing for granted.
Off-season workouts Included ball
handling practice and strength and condi
tioning drills, but the biggest change was a
mental one. "The biggest difference between
Terry Taylor this year and Terry Taylor last
year is confidence," Ramee said.
"I'm more comfortable than last year,"
Taylor said. "I had a lack of self-confidence.
They (former Coach Tom Davis and staff)
made me feel like I wasn't that good." The
pressure of Davis' substitution system,
which continuously shuttled players in and
out, didn't help. "Last year, when I only had a
couple of minutes to play. I felt like 1 had to
do something great, even when I hadn't got
ten a feel for the game. I'd make a dumb play

just to impress the coaches."
Taylor said Davis "played with my mind" in
a manner he had never before encountered.
"At the Richmond game, it was our first loss,
and I was called for traveling at the end of the
first half," he said. "Coach Davis came up to
me after the game and said. Without that
call, it could have been a different game.' "
But with the departure of Davis to lowa,
new Coach Mike Montgomery brought a dif
ferent system to Stanford. And
Montgomery's staff recognized Taylor's po
tential. "He's got great physical and mental
toughness." Asst. Coach Denny Huston said.
"When things are going bad, he's still up.
And he keeps his teammates up."
His primary role as a point guard is bring
ing the ball upcourt, rarely taking a shot
himself. It's a different role than scoring 600
points a season, as he did in high school.
"My role is to be a team person," Taylor said.
"I'm not looking to score. We've got other
good guys: Todd (Lichti), Howard (Wright),
G.B. (Greg Butler) who can do all that. I'm
Mr. Assist Man."
That he has been. He tied the Stanford
single-game record last month with 12
against Washington State, and he leads the
team with 120 this season.
Taylor's outside shooting ability has
become increasingly important as the Card
inal faces more zone defenses. He is shooting
as well from behind the new three-point line
(47 percent) as he is overall (46 percent).
Taylor knows, though, that "team philoso
phy comes before my 30 points a game."
With an attitude like that, Huston has him
marked as "a good kid. . . . He's the kind of
kid I'd want to have for my own son. I enjoy
being around him."
Perhaps with praise like that, some players
would become overly arrogant. But Taylor's
experiences in learning to adapt — to Stan
ford, to new coaches, to a new role on the
court — leave him with a paradoxical humble
confidence seeking only more of a challenge.

players already there. He knew that he had to
pay his dues."
Knowing that didn't make it easier for
Taylor, however. But instead of remaining
unhappy, Taylor decided to wait his turn.
"I learned a lot from Keith last year." he
said. "And 1 learned sitting on the bench was
not fun. I was going to do whatever I had to
do to get more minutes or to start."
Autographed basketball hero posters, as
well as pictures of his girlfriend and family,
engulf the walls of his dorm room. By the
sheer number of them, there is a feeling that
these things are all important to him, be
cause everything about him has a definite
place and purpose.
A sense of purpose characterizes the inten
sity with which Taylor sought the starting
point guard spot this season. Of course,
Ramee's graduation and the decision of
quarterback John Paye to concentrate on
football didn't hurt his chances, but Taylor
was taking nothing for granted.
Off-season workouts Included ball
handling practice and strength and condi
tioning drills, but the biggest change was a
mental one. "The biggest difference between
Terry Taylor this year and Terry Taylor last
year is confidence," Ramee said.
"I'm more comfortable than last year,"
Taylor said. "I had a lack of self-confidence.
They (former Coach Tom Davis and staff)
made me feel like I wasn't that good." The
pressure of Davis' substitution system,
which continuously shuttled players in and
out, didn't help. "Last year, when I only had a
couple of minutes to play. I felt like 1 had to
do something great, even when I hadn't got
ten a feel for the game. I'd make a dumb play

just to impress the coaches."
Taylor said Davis "played with my mind" in
a manner he had never before encountered.
"At the Richmond game, it was our first loss,
and I was called for traveling at the end of the
first half," he said. "Coach Davis came up to
me after the game and said. Without that
call, it could have been a different game.' "
But with the departure of Davis to lowa,
new Coach Mike Montgomery brought a dif
ferent system to Stanford. And
Montgomery's staff recognized Taylor's po
tential. "He's got great physical and mental
toughness." Asst. Coach Denny Huston said.
"When things are going bad, he's still up.
And he keeps his teammates up."
His primary role as a point guard is bring
ing the ball upcourt, rarely taking a shot
himself. It's a different role than scoring 600
points a season, as he did in high school.
"My role is to be a team person," Taylor said.
"I'm not looking to score. We've got other
good guys: Todd (Lichti), Howard (Wright),
G.B. (Greg Butler) who can do all that. I'm
Mr. Assist Man."
That he has been. He tied the Stanford
single-game record last month with 12
against Washington State, and he leads the
team with 120 this season.
Taylor's outside shooting ability has
become increasingly important as the Card
inal faces more zone defenses. He is shooting
as well from behind the new three-point line
(47 percent) as he is overall (46 percent).
Taylor knows, though, that "team philoso
phy comes before my 30 points a game."
With an attitude like that, Huston has him
marked as "a good kid. . . . He's the kind of
kid I'd want to have for my own son. I enjoy
being around him."
Perhaps with praise like that, some players
would become overly arrogant. But Taylor's
experiences in learning to adapt — to Stan
ford, to new coaches, to a new role on the
court — leave him with a paradoxical humble
confidence seeking only more of a challenge.


Terry Taylor
Sophomore guard Terry Taylor has
patiently adapted to Stanford. He Is happy to
be getting B's. He doesn't score as many
points as he did In the past. And he Is glad
just to be starting for the Cardinal this year.
Quite a change from Terry Taylor in high
school: Colorado Player of the Year, Converse
All-American, state scoring leader and class
valedictorian at Rangeview High School in

the Denver suburb of Aurora.
"I went from being Mr. World to just
mediocre," Taylor said, his eyes lighting up
from beneath a Stanford baseball cap. "Our
team won state, so I used to be stuck up. like
how most big jocks are — popular. Everyone
would always come up to me and say hi."
Then Taylor arrived at Stanford, only to
discover that he was no longer a star. He
blended into the mass of overachievers.
People no longer sought him out. And his
competition for the point guard position

never amounted to any competition at all —
the job already belonged to three-year starter
Keith Ramee, who held the position all
season.
Taylor's father, Terry Sr., was also his high
school coach, and he said Taylor had always
been realistic. "We prepared him." he said.
"Terry knew that there were a lot of good
players already there. He knew that he had to
pay his dues."
