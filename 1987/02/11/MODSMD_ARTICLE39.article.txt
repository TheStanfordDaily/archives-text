# Deja vu for spikers playing Hawaii again
## 
### ALICIA KENT Staff writer 
Feeling confident after Monday
night's big win against a tradi
tionally strong Hawaii team, the
No. 8 Stanford men's volleyball
team will face the No. 9 Rainbows
again tonight at 7:30 at Maples
Pavilion.
Immediately following Monday's
match. which Stanford
dominated with an 18-16, 15-9,
15-7 shutout, both coaches said
their teams had techniques and
strategies to work on in prepara
tion for tonight's second match.
In the Western Intercollegiate
Volleyball Association, Stanford
plays each team twice during the
season, one home match and one
away. Because Hawaii is such a
long and expensive trek for each
team to make, though, Hawaii
and Stanford visit each other in
alternate years and play both
matches in one shot.
The back-to-back matches put
Stanford Coach Fred Sturm in a
somewhat different position.
Sturm usually has several weeks
between repeat matches, allowing
time for opponent scouting, men
tal preparation and improvement
in indiviual play and team unity.
"I'm going to go home and
watch the films (of Monday's
match)," Sturm said immediately
following his team's victory.
"There are a couple of things we
need to work on. Hawaii did some
things that no other team in the
country does." Sturm was refer
ring to techniques that the Rain
bows have developed such as
sophomore hitter Allen Allen's
spiking ability, which gave him 17
kills in Monday's match. Allen is a
native of Amanave, Samoa.
The Cardinal's blocking, led by
junior hitter Scott Fortune's nine
blocks, was one area in which the

spikers can improve. Robert Peter
son. usually a strong blocker, re
corded only four blocks, posting
for 26 blocks during the match.
The Cardinal hopes as well that
its serving is stronger tonight
after Monday's nine service errors
to only four service aces. "We'll
have to keep siding out and hope
fully serve tougher." said senior
John McDermott, who hit for a
.500 percentage on Monday.
The Cardinal's strength in Mon
day's game was its consistent abil
ity to side out. "If we keep siding
out. then there is no way they can
score points." said McDermott.
who is an outside hitter from
Honolulu. Hawaii's hitting
percentage of .274 and 30 errors
was very close to Stanford's .299
percentage and 28 errors, but be
cause the Cardinal was able to
side out and score when it had the
serve, it dominated the
scoreboard on Monday.
The Rainbows have the difficult
task of having to block out Mon
day's loss and start fresh.
"Wednesday we'll have to play bet
ter. We made a lot of mistakes.
We're at a disadvantage because
for some players this is their first
time ever in college play," Hawaii
Coach Alan Rosehill said after
Monday's defeat. "Wednesday will
be much closer than tonight."
Rainbow captain Jeff Rodgers
agreed. "We were surprised by our
own play, not by Stanford's. We
were making a lot of errors. We're
going to try to make a comeback
— try to get our heads into the
game and play better," said
Rodgers, who is the team's only re
turning senior.
"We will try to do the same
thing, stay as consistent as we
were. If we play like we did
tonight, then I don't think there
are many teams in the country
who could beat us," Peterson said.

time ever in college play," Hawaii
Coach Alan Rosehill said after
Monday's defeat. "Wednesday will
be much closer than tonight."
Rainbow captain Jeff Rodgers
agreed. "We were surprised by our
own play, not by Stanford's. We
were making a lot of errors. We're
going to try to make a comeback
— try to get our heads into the
game and play better," said
Rodgers, who is the team's only re
turning senior.
"We will try to do the same
thing, stay as consistent as we
were. If we play like we did
tonight, then I don't think there
are many teams in the country
who could beat us," Peterson said.
