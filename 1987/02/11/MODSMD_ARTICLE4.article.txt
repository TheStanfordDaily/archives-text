# Senate votes $87,000 for ASSU facilities renovation
## 
### MONIQUE SCHEER Senior staff writer 
The ASSU Senate last night voted to renovate the
ASSU facilities with $87,000 from reserve funds.
The senate also passed resolutions calling for the
University to review Dead Week policy and to allow
incoming freshmen to retain residence preferences
allowed past freshmen.
Members of the committee that authored the
renovation bill voiced their support for the new floor
plan designed by a committee headed by Council of
Presidents member Carey White. The new plans,
they said, would make access to ASSU offices easier
for students using ASSU services as well as provide a

more efficient work space for employees.
Senator Jeff Sloan described the present offices lo
cated in Tresidder Union as "atrocious to spend a lot
of hours working in."
The new plans include an outside service window
for the ASSU Lecture Notes office, wider corridors
and a more logical organization of the offices. It also
calls for carpeting and a new coat of paint for the
facility.
The proposal presented to the senate claims that
the new design "will help students use things with
less hassle and will help them find services and
offices they need. Students will be less uncomfort
able when waiting or working here."
Senator Bob Griffin voiced an objection to the

amount of money budgeted for the project. Implying
that the ASSU was spending a large amount because
of a sudden "windfall" profit it recently received. He
suggested that only $5,000 be spent, with the
remaining $82,000 allocated for campus student
groups.
Financial Manager Mariah Dickson said that the
ASSU was not spending the $87,000 simply because
It had the money, but that the renovation budget
was the result of long and serious consideration.
The senate voted 16-4 to approve the renovation.
Senator Eric Allen proposed a resolution for the
Committee on Academic Appraisal and Achievement
(CAAA) to review the University's Dead Week policy,
claiming that the "current Dead Week policy . . .

doesn't do anything."
The policy as it now stands states that professors
cannot make any "extraordinary" assignments
during Dead Week, meaning assignments additional
to what is regularly on the syllabus. They are not to
use the week to "catch up."
Under this policy, professors "can basically assign
all they want" during Dead Week, Allen said. He
added that many students, particularly those in
technical classes, find that problem sets, computer
programs and other assignments during Dead Week
interfere with their preparation for finals.
The resolution recommends "that [the CAAA) fash-
ion a new policy which strongly
and specifically discourages, if not
prohibits, the assignment of read
ings, problem sets or other proj
ects during Dead Week or some
specified period of time therein."
It does not recommend limitation

of in-class instruction during
Dead Week.
The senate passed the resolu
tion by a divided voice vote.
Senator Leonard Adler pre
sented a resolution for the Sub
committee on Residential Educa
tion and Advising (SREA) to
reverse its recommendation to
prevent incoming freshmen from
choosing their residences.
The SREA recently proposed as

signing incoming freshmen to
dorms based on their choice of
Western Culture track, denying
them the housing option based on
class standing or gender.
The senate unanimously passed
the resolution with a voice vote.
In other business, it was an
nounced that change machines
will be installed in Wilbur Hall
laundry rooms on an experimental
basis.
