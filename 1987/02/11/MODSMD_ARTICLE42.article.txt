# Parking situation to improve
## 
### DIANE BISGEIER Senior staff writer 
Within six months, on-campus parking should be
easier to come by.
The construction of two new facilities will alleviate
the parking crunch, according to Dennis Perkinson,
associate director for Transportation Programs in
the Office of Real Estate & Lands Management.
Calling the current situation "not typical at all." he
attributed the lack of space to new construction, par
ticularly at the Stanford Medical Center, which
results in cars parking in other nearby lots. "We're
building everything over existing (parking) spaces at
the medical center. There are at least two or three
projects going on now. not to mention our parking
structure." he said.
The structure underway at the medical center will
contain 1,050 spaces and cost just under * 10 million
to build. Construction should be completed by mid-
July. Perkinson said.
A second project, to be located near Forsythe Hall
and due for completion in mid-1988, will contain ap
proximately 750 spaces. The two facilities are
"expected to provide a reasonable surplus for the
next few years at least," Perkinson said.
The problem with such projects is the removal of
existing parking to add new parking.
In order to build the medical center lot. a 200-car
lot had to be closed, Perkinson said. "The addition of

the new lot will bring 1.000 new spaces In the most
crowded area of the campus, but the difficulty is it all
takes time. Even temporary lots set up to alleviate
the problem take time to construct," he said.
The preliminary plan for the structure calls for all
the parking spaces to be 'C' permit spaces, according
to Perkinson. This could cause the medical center to
redesignate 'C'-permit lots as A'-permlt spaces, he
said.
The structure's ground floor can be turned into
metered spaces at a later date. Perkinson said.
As of March 1986. there were approximately 3.000
spaces for cars with 'A' permits, the costliest parking
permit. 5,300 spaces for cars with C permits and
2,000 visitor spaces, which are metered. There were
also about 4,500 spaces for students and residents.
The ideal margin of empty spaces is a 10 percent
vacancy, according to Perkinson. As for the number
of cars registered, "the Administrative Council did
not offer limits on selling permits but we can convert
C* spaces to A' spaces if they are oversold." he said.
Funding of new lots comes straight from the Uni
versity. "These things are so expensive." Perkinson
said. "A percentage of costs that go toward new con
struction also go into the General Plan Improvement
Fund, which subsidizes roads and parking costs. If
spaces are lost, a price is also paid per lost space.
None of the sticker fees pay for parking construc
tion."
