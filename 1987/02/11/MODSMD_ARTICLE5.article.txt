# Prepaid tuition plan introduced

SACRAMENTO - Rising college
tuition costs and cuts in federal
student loans are a threat to the
educational future of today's
youth, according to two California
assemblymen who have proposed
similar tuition guarantee plans to
combat this problem.
"The affordability of education
is in doubt for the next genera
tion," Assemblyman Tom Hayden
(D-West Los Angeles) said yester
day at a hearing in Sacramento.
The price of a college education at
public institutions in California
has risen 900 percent over the
past two decades, he said, leaving
many parents unable to meet the
cost of their children's education.
Hayden, chairman of the As
sembly Subcommittee on Higher
Education, predicted that tuition
rates will continue to rise and
that, unless action is taken, only
the affluent will be able to afford

higher education.
In an effort to prevent such a sit
uation. Hayden introduced legis
lation last month that would, if
enacted, establish the California
Education Trust (CET). The CET,
modeled after a novel plan recently
adopted by the state of Michigan,
would be a state-administered in
vestment fund. The state would
guarantee investors' children a
college education by allowing the
investors to purchase a certificate
redeemable for four years of un
dergraduate tuition at any state
college or university when their
children reach college age.
Similar legislation has also been
introduced by Assemblyman Step
hen Peace (D-Chula Vista).
"(Guaranteed tuition) speaks to
the anxiety that many parents feel
in regard to their children's edu
cation," Hayden said.
James Blanchard, the governor
of Michigan, testified yesterday as

State Assemblyman Tom Hayden outlines a proposal that would al

"We hope that we can find a way to make college affordable for the
working class, for poor families and for minority families," Hayden
said.
a special witness at the hearing on
Hayden's bill. "We're confident
that this (the tuition guarantee
plan) is a major step in creating
access to education," Blanchard
said, noting that both California
and Michigan are known for their
excellent public universities.
But while most educators and
legislators agreed that rising tui
tion is limiting access to higher
education, some remained skepti
cal of CET and asked why private
investment firms could not estab
lish equivalent tuition guarantee
plans.
Robert Bowman, Michigan's
state treasurer and architect of
the Michigan plan, addressed this
question: "Private Industry can
guarantee a rate of return. They
can't guarantee tuition."
CET was also criticized for

failing to directly help the most
needy in society, those who could
not even afford to purchase a tui
tion guarantee certificate.
Blanchard responded that a tui
tion guarantee plan would ideally
be accompanied by other legisla
tion offering low-interest loans to
low-income parents who wished to
purchase a tuition guarantee cer
tificate. He said he hoped civic
groups, grandparents and
churches would purchase tuition
guarantee certificates for children
of their choice, thus providing an
incentive for those children to
work hard in school.
CET could have ramifications
for private schools such as Stan
ford. increasing the price gap be
tween public and private institu
tions and intensifying competi
tion for students.
The CET would widen the price
gap by encouraging the state to
keep tuition lower at public insti
tutions. according to William
Moore, president of the Associa
tion for Independent California
Colleges and Universities, of
which Stanford is a member. This
would create an incentive for stu
dents to attend public rather than
private universities, he said.
Timothy Warner, associate
provost of Stanford's Office of
Budget and Management, agreed
with Moore. He added that the
idea was good in principle, but
might be more equitable if it were

national in its scope.
"A plan that's more of a national
plan would be more preferable
than one that is state-based," he
said.
Under the Michigan plan, stu
dents holding guaranteed tuition
certificates who decide to attend a
private university or college will
receive an amount equal to the
average cost of tuition at all public
colleges and universities in the
state. This amount can then be
applied toward the cost of tuition
at the private school.
In its most most basic form, the
CET would sell certificates
redeemable for four years of un

dergraduate tuition at any public
college or university in California.
The price of the tuition guarantee
certificates would depend on the
age of the beneficiary at the time
the certificate was purchased.
This will allow enough interest to
accrue on the purchase price to
cover the projected cost of tuition
when the child reaches college
age.
If the beneficiary died or decided
not to go to college, the initial In
vestment would be returned to the
purchaser, with some but not all
of the interest accrued. This
would prevent people from using
the CET as a tax shelter.
