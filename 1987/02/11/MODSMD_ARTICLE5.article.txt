SACRAMENTO - Rising college
tuition costs and cuts in federal
student loans are a threat to the
educational future of today's
youth, according to two California
assemblymen who have proposed
similar tuition guarantee plans to
combat this problem.
"The affordability of education
is in doubt for the next genera
tion," Assemblyman Tom Hayden
(D-West Los Angeles) said yester
day at a hearing in Sacramento.
The price of a college education at
public institutions in California
has risen 900 percent over the
past two decades, he said, leaving
many parents unable to meet the
cost of their children's education.
Hayden, chairman of the As
sembly Subcommittee on Higher
Education, predicted that tuition
rates will continue to rise and
that, unless action is taken, only
the affluent will be able to afford

higher education.
In an effort to prevent such a sit
uation. Hayden introduced legis
lation last month that would, if
enacted, establish the California
Education Trust (CET). The CET,
modeled after a novel plan recently
adopted by the state of Michigan,
would be a state-administered in
vestment fund. The state would
guarantee investors' children a
college education by allowing the
investors to purchase a certificate
redeemable for four years of un
dergraduate tuition at any state
college or university when their
children reach college age.
Similar legislation has also been
introduced by Assemblyman Step
hen Peace (D-Chula Vista).
"(Guaranteed tuition) speaks to
the anxiety that many parents feel
in regard to their children's edu
cation," Hayden said.
James Blanchard, the governor
of Michigan, testified yesterday as

State Assemblyman Tom Hayden outlines a proposal that would al
low parents to prepay their children's college tuition. With this plan,
"We hope that we can find a way to make college affordable for the
working class, for poor families and for minority families," Hayden
said.
