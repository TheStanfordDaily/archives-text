# It pays to network while at Stanford
## 
### MORTY POSNER Editorial staff 
It used to be called the "old
boy network." but then women
gained entrance to the corpor
ate world. Then they called it
being "well-connected." but
that sounded silly. Now it's
simply known by the generic,
yuppified term "networking."
But it still means it pays to
have friends.
According to undergraduate
coordinator Lynne Mason at
the Career Planning and Place
ment Center (CPPC), only
about 20 to 25 percent of jobs
are gained in the traditional
way â€” by looking through want
ads or job listings. The rest are
found through networking.
"Networking doesn't get you
a job," Mason said. "It helps
you find a job."
Many jobs never get ad
vertised or are advertised only

to comply with the law.
Sometimes, the job has already
been promised to someone else
once it reaches the newspaper.
How can you realistically ex
pect to hear about jobs that will
never be advertised or don't ex
ist until you inquire? Talk to
family, friends and acquain
tances, experts say.
John Danner, a junior in
electrical engineering, got his
last three summer jobs through
acquaintances of his parents.
And he wasn't flipping burgers,
either.
Working at electrical contrac
tor Cupertino Electric last sum
mer, Danner was responsible
for implementing the use of a
computer system that esti
mated the cost of projects that
were to be bid on. Hiring Dan
ner was "more cost-effective
than having the owner train
the managers." he said.
"I'm not sure the job would have existed if
my mother didn't know the people."
Certainly, not everyone's parents have con
tacts with companies doing work in your field.
You can still develop contacts while at Stanford
that will help you in the future.
Wade French, a programmer/analyst in the
University's personnel department, got a job as
an office assistant in Overseas Studies after he
graduated from Stanford. He then got a job in
the University's telecommunications depart
ment as a data aide. They knew him when he
was a student working as a University oper
ator.
French subsequently recommended a class
mate he met as a student at Stanford-in-Berlin
for his Job at Overseas Studies. He knew she
was looking for a Job change, but she was un
aware of the opening. She got the job.
Working as a data aide, French heard from a
friend in the Office of Development that a job
was opening up in the personnel department.
French's new manager worked in Residential
Education when French was in Overseas
Studies and was familiar with his work.
"It's this idea that when you know somebody
and you're applying for a job and the person
who's hiring is looking at people of equal
quality, he'll choose the knowable quantity,"
French said.
Noting that qualified candidates may look
good "on paper," French said that " 'on paper'
doesn't cut it on the actual job." Most
managers will opt to hire the person whose
work they know.
French emphasized the importance of the
contacts one makes while a student at Stan
ford.
"One thing that you're paying a lot of money
for is the peer group that you're with. Stanford
has chosen a very good group of people and the
prospect of knowing someone who's going to
be successful is very high.
"You're talking about people who are going
to do very well in society. You should try to get
to know people," French said.
Talking to Stanford alumni is another effec
tive way to conduct a job search. Many alumni
are more than happy to give students career
advice, point out opportunities and offer jobs.
Cheryl Frank, a business development offi

cer at a local bank, got one of her first market
ing positions by speaking with a corporate vice
president, a Stanford alumnus, who asked her
if she would be interested In working for him.
She was later told by the personnel director
that "this is not the way we normally hire
here."

Stu Corliss, also a graduate, has a market
ing job with Del Monte. He said alumni "want
to make a go of it. . . . They're going to give you
every opportunity to shine."
This fondness for graduates of one's alma
mater creates a kind of "external loyalty" that
can open doors in a job search.

"It's not so much that you get preferential
treatment, but access," said Carl Danner (no
relation to John), a regulatory planning spe
cialist for the California Public Utilities Com
mission.
"In government the access is so important
... if you can get an introduction which gets
you on your own" you have a better chance of
getting a job. Danner explained.
On campus, access to alumni is gained
through the alumni contact service. The
Alumni Association has listings of 900 to
1.000 alumni in different fields who are willing
to give advice to students about their careers.
They represent 12 metropolitan areas, with
over 300 in the Bay Area and 250 in the Los
Angeles area.
Jeff McColloch of the Alumni Association
cautioned, however, that the directory is "not a
job service."
"We've made an administrative decision not
to get into the job market per se," McColloch
said, explaining that this is left to the CPPC.
Rather, McColloch said that it is used "just to
get job advice."
Another way to network is to be a volunteer,
which puts you in contact with potential
employers while gaining experience that
makes you more attractive in the job market.
"Being a volunteer is a wonderful source of
networking. You make friends over a broad
spectrum of alumni," said Jean Coblentz, a
graduate who was once a sales manager at
Hewlett-Packard.
After leaving the work force to raise a family,
Coblentz served as a volunteer at the Stanford
Children's Hospital. One day she got a call
from the director of the Annual Fund, who had
noticed her work at the Hospital. She's been
working in the Development Office for the last
16 years.
Coblentz said she cannot emphasize enough
how employers notice volunteer work.
"Those that work hard are being watched,"
Coblentz said.
Information and access are all-important in
the job search and everyone you ever meet is a
potential contact. A study done 20 years ago
found that, on average, one person can get in
contact with any other person through about
five intermediaries who know one another.
Thus, you are probably only a few phone calls
away from the person you'd like to work for. It
is indeed a small world.
Mason explained that "if you're genuinely
seeking information most people are very will
ing to talk to you."
