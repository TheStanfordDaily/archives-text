Interest rate and dollar both up
WASHINGTON — The Federal Reserve issued a guarded signal
yesterday that it is willing to prop up the sagging American dollar
by allowing a rise in interest rates, which have declined substan
tially over the last two years.
In response, interest rates and the dollar both increased
sharply.
At the same time, Secretary of the Treasury James Baker 111
hinted at a bid to halt the dollar's slide by warning of hardships to
Japan from any further plunge in the U.S. currency. "At some
point." Baker told the House Ways and Means Committee, "It
becomes counterproductive to talk in terms of further exchange
rate changes, or further exchange rate adjustments."
The Fed, opening a key secret policy-making meeting this week,
failed to counteract a sharp increase in short-term interest rates
in credit markets. That apparently convinced currency traders
that the central bank is prepared to allow rates to rise — thereby
making U.S. investments more attractive to foreigners and help
ing protect the dollar against further declines.
Baker and Fed Chairman Paul Volcker are engaged in a high
wire act of international economic brinkmanship, winning ap
plause in Congress by using the threat of a weaker dollar to help
ward off protectionist legislation while also trying to assuage
foreign fears that a further plunge in the dollar would wreak havoc
in Europe and Japan by suddenly undermining their export-led
economies.
S.African policy deemed a failure
WASHINGTON —The administration's blue-ribbon advisory
committee on South Africa described President Reagan's
"constructive engagement" policy as a failure yesterday and urged
the United States to recruit its major allies to impose their own
economic sanctions to pressure the Pretoria government to aban
don its apartheid policy of racial segregation.
The 12-member panel of businessmen, lawyers and academics
— including two former Cabinet officers — also called for closer
contacts between the U.S. government and South African black
organizations, including the banned African National Congress.
Secretary of State George Shultz, who appointed the committee
a little more than a year ago in an effort to attract a bipartisan con
sensus behind the administration's policies, disagreed sharply
with many of the panel's recommendations, including the one ur
ging more widespread sanctions against the white minority gov
ernment.
The panel conceded that communists were active in the ANC
but said the main reason for that was the South African govern
ment's ban on the organization. The ban created a favorable envi
ronment for the Communist Party, which it described as a "tightly
organized, clandestine party with close links to external sources of
arms and military training." The committee predicted that the
ANC's ties with the communists "would diminish in an open poli
tical environment."
Experts call Hanford plant unsafe
WASHINGTON —The Hanford nuclear reactor cannot be made
adequately safe during its current *50 million renovation pro
gram and six-month shutdown, and the government should plan
for a permanent replacement, three nuclear experts who studied
the Washington state plant told a congressional hearing yester
day.
The examination of Hanford, which manufactures plutonium
for nuclear weapons, was conducted because it has a design
similiar to the Soviet Union's Chernobyl plant, where a fire and ra
diation release in April killed 31 people and forced a massive popu
lation evacuation.
The Soviet reactor at Chernobyl is unstable at low tempera
tures. and the specific accident that occurred there is almost
impossible at Hanford, which has a much more rapid emergency
shutdown system, independent experts testified.
However, they added, there is a potential for other accidents at
Hanford. And three independent nuclear experts told the subcom
mittee that Hanford falls below the strict safety standards re
quired for commercial nuclear power plants, adding that the gov
ernment should begin planning to replace the plant, which has
been in operation since 1963.
Ist Interstate may face takeover
LOS ANGELES — First Interstate Bancorp's withdrawal of its
bid to acquire BankAmerica will not deter its longtime expansion
strategy of acquiring other banks in California and nationwide,
analysts and company officials say.
But First Interstate's failure to acquire BankAmerica again
focuses attention on its own vulnerability to a takeover, some ob
servers said. First Interstate Chairman Joseph Pinola is known to
have hoped to acquire BankAmerica in part to shield his own in
stitution, whose 12-state banking operations are seen as attrac
tive to potential suitors who could afford the multibillion dollar
price.
Withdrawal of the BankAmerica bid will allow First Interstate to
look for other takeover targets, possibly among smaller banks in
California, where its flagship bank. First Interstate Bank of Cali
fornia. has largely failed to gain market share in recent years.
First Interstate's strategy of seeking "acquisitions and franchises
to expand the scope of our territory" has not changed with the end
of the BankAmerica bid. First Interstate spokesman Paul Minch
said.
Soviets hold first secret election
MOSCOW — The Soviet Union has conducted what appears to
be its first secret-ballot, multiple-candidate election for a regional
Communist Party post, according to media reports.
Two major newspapers and the official news agency Tass re
ported yesterday on the outcome of an election for first secretary of
a party district in far-off Siberia.
It's not normally the stuff that makes headlines in the Moscow
press, but this election was different: It had two candidates and
the winner was chosen by secret ballot.
All that was apparently the first result of Soviet leader Mikhail
Gorbachev's call for secret-ballot, multiple-candidate elections of
senior party officials by members of central committees at local,
regional and republic levels.
In launching what could be a Siberian trial balloon, the first sec
retary of the regional party. N. Ermakov. pronounced the election
a success. However, he said, the whole process might come to be
regarded as a "mistake" by higher party bodies. If so. he said, he is
willtng to be corrected.
Stats show school improvements
WASHINGTON —Secretary of Education William Bennett,
reporting that college entrance scores held steady last year and the
nation's high school dropout rate increased slightly, declared that
"we have to do better."
Bennett, releasing the department s fourth annual "report card"
on the nation's schools, said that the statistics indicated "a little
gain, a little slippage." Although the figures were dismissed by
some critics as misleading. Bennett emphasized that schools were
making progress toward improving education in the United
States.

S.African policy deemed a failure
WASHINGTON —The administration's blue-ribbon advisory
committee on South Africa described President Reagan's
"constructive engagement" policy as a failure yesterday and urged
the United States to recruit its major allies to impose their own
economic sanctions to pressure the Pretoria government to aban
don its apartheid policy of racial segregation.
The 12-member panel of businessmen, lawyers and academics
— including two former Cabinet officers — also called for closer
contacts between the U.S. government and South African black
organizations, including the banned African National Congress.
Secretary of State George Shultz, who appointed the committee
a little more than a year ago in an effort to attract a bipartisan con
sensus behind the administration's policies, disagreed sharply
with many of the panel's recommendations, including the one ur
ging more widespread sanctions against the white minority gov
ernment.
The panel conceded that communists were active in the ANC
but said the main reason for that was the South African govern
ment's ban on the organization. The ban created a favorable envi
ronment for the Communist Party, which it described as a "tightly
organized, clandestine party with close links to external sources of
arms and military training." The committee predicted that the
ANC's ties with the communists "would diminish in an open poli
tical environment."
Experts call Hanford plant unsafe
WASHINGTON —The Hanford nuclear reactor cannot be made
adequately safe during its current *50 million renovation pro
gram and six-month shutdown, and the government should plan
for a permanent replacement, three nuclear experts who studied
the Washington state plant told a congressional hearing yester
day.
The examination of Hanford, which manufactures plutonium
for nuclear weapons, was conducted because it has a design
similiar to the Soviet Union's Chernobyl plant, where a fire and ra
diation release in April killed 31 people and forced a massive popu
lation evacuation.
The Soviet reactor at Chernobyl is unstable at low tempera
tures. and the specific accident that occurred there is almost
impossible at Hanford, which has a much more rapid emergency
shutdown system, independent experts testified.
However, they added, there is a potential for other accidents at
Hanford. And three independent nuclear experts told the subcom
mittee that Hanford falls below the strict safety standards re
quired for commercial nuclear power plants, adding that the gov
ernment should begin planning to replace the plant, which has
been in operation since 1963.
Ist Interstate may face takeover
LOS ANGELES — First Interstate Bancorp's withdrawal of its
bid to acquire BankAmerica will not deter its longtime expansion
strategy of acquiring other banks in California and nationwide,
analysts and company officials say.
But First Interstate's failure to acquire BankAmerica again
focuses attention on its own vulnerability to a takeover, some ob
servers said. First Interstate Chairman Joseph Pinola is known to
have hoped to acquire BankAmerica in part to shield his own in
stitution, whose 12-state banking operations are seen as attrac
tive to potential suitors who could afford the multibillion dollar
price.
Withdrawal of the BankAmerica bid will allow First Interstate to
look for other takeover targets, possibly among smaller banks in
California, where its flagship bank. First Interstate Bank of Cali
fornia. has largely failed to gain market share in recent years.
First Interstate's strategy of seeking "acquisitions and franchises
to expand the scope of our territory" has not changed with the end
of the BankAmerica bid. First Interstate spokesman Paul Minch
said.
Soviets hold first secret election
MOSCOW — The Soviet Union has conducted what appears to
be its first secret-ballot, multiple-candidate election for a regional
Communist Party post, according to media reports.
Two major newspapers and the official news agency Tass re
ported yesterday on the outcome of an election for first secretary of
a party district in far-off Siberia.
It's not normally the stuff that makes headlines in the Moscow
press, but this election was different: It had two candidates and
the winner was chosen by secret ballot.
All that was apparently the first result of Soviet leader Mikhail
Gorbachev's call for secret-ballot, multiple-candidate elections of
senior party officials by members of central committees at local,
regional and republic levels.
In launching what could be a Siberian trial balloon, the first sec
retary of the regional party. N. Ermakov. pronounced the election
a success. However, he said, the whole process might come to be
regarded as a "mistake" by higher party bodies. If so. he said, he is
willtng to be corrected.
Stats show school improvements
WASHINGTON —Secretary of Education William Bennett,
reporting that college entrance scores held steady last year and the
nation's high school dropout rate increased slightly, declared that
"we have to do better."
Bennett, releasing the department s fourth annual "report card"
on the nation's schools, said that the statistics indicated "a little
gain, a little slippage." Although the figures were dismissed by
some critics as misleading. Bennett emphasized that schools were
making progress toward improving education in the United
States.

Interest rate and dollar both up
WASHINGTON — The Federal Reserve issued a guarded signal
yesterday that it is willing to prop up the sagging American dollar
by allowing a rise in interest rates, which have declined substan
tially over the last two years.
In response, interest rates and the dollar both increased
sharply.
At the same time, Secretary of the Treasury James Baker 111
hinted at a bid to halt the dollar's slide by warning of hardships to
Japan from any further plunge in the U.S. currency. "At some
point." Baker told the House Ways and Means Committee, "It
becomes counterproductive to talk in terms of further exchange
rate changes, or further exchange rate adjustments."
The Fed, opening a key secret policy-making meeting this week,
failed to counteract a sharp increase in short-term interest rates
in credit markets. That apparently convinced currency traders
that the central bank is prepared to allow rates to rise — thereby
making U.S. investments more attractive to foreigners and help
ing protect the dollar against further declines.
Baker and Fed Chairman Paul Volcker are engaged in a high
wire act of international economic brinkmanship, winning ap
plause in Congress by using the threat of a weaker dollar to help
ward off protectionist legislation while also trying to assuage
foreign fears that a further plunge in the dollar would wreak havoc
in Europe and Japan by suddenly undermining their export-led
economies.
