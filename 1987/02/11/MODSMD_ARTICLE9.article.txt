# Soviets release political prisoners

### 
MOSCOW - The Soviet Union
has released 140 political
prisoners in a mass pardon that
may climb to nearly 300, a Foreign
Ministry spokesman said yester
day.
The pardon, granted by special
decree of the Soviet Union's high
est legislative body, the Presidium
of the Supreme Soviet, was for
prisoners who had been convicted
under Article 70 of the Soviet Con
stitution, spokesman Gennadi
Gerasimov told reporters in a
press briefing. The act makes
"agitation and propaganda"
against the Soviet regime an im
prisonable crime.
Those freed had been sent to
prisons and camps for actions
ranging from circulating under
ground articles about Soviet
human rights abuses to using
Western contacts in attempts to
emigrate from the Soviet Union.
The pardon is the largest mass
release of Soviet political
prisoners since 1956, when then
Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev

released thousands of prisoners
who had been imprisoned during
the era of Joseph Stalin.
Gerasimov's announcement
comes days after returning
prisoners began to arrive in the
Soviet capital, signalling that
their cases had been resolved.
Last Saturday, dissident physicist
Andrei Sakharov, who was
released from seven years of exile
in December, reported that he and
his wife Yelena Bonner had
compiled a list of 43 political
prisoners who had been set free.
Although the decree to free the
prisoners was passed more than a
week ago, today's Foreign Ministry
account, reported in a short dis
patch released Monday night by
the official news agency Tass, was
the first mention of the mass par
don in the Soviet media.
The Foreign Ministry spokes
man declined to post the full list of
those pardoned, but said he would
respond to reporters' inquiries
about individual cases. He also
declined to reveal the number of

Soviets imprisoned under Article
70.
Western analysts said official
willingness to set free those who
had been charged with anti-Soviet
actions may signal a looser inter
pretation of the public ability to
speak critically about the Soviet
Union. "This is In line with our
policy of democratization."
Gerasimov said.
In reaction to Geraslmov's an
nouncement, Bonner told
reporters: "I am very happy and I
am waiting for the day when all
these 140 people are home with
their families."
Among those released are many
names hardly known in the West
but celebrated In the Soviet dissi
dent community. They Include:
Yuri Shikhanovich, who edited
the human rights journal
Chronicle of Higher Events, and
Sergei Grigoryants, a literary
critic who had been imprisoned at
Chistopol, near Kazan.
Those released had either asked
for pardon or agreed not to con

tlnue the crime they had been
convicted for, Gerasimov said. He
added that the prisoners signed
documents before their release in
which "they probably said that
they would not continue with any
anti-Soviet propaganda."
Two groups of prisoners were
released, Gerasimov said, on Feb.
2 and Feb. 9. Another group of
"about the same number," is now
under review, he said.
Positive action on all the cases
would bring the total number to
double the current figure of 140,
the spokesman said.
The action still left an un
specified number of political pris
oner cases unresolved. Estimates
of the number of Soviets im
prisoned for crimes of conscience
or political acts ranges widely;
many Western experts put the fig
ure at 1,000.
The Jewish activist loslf Begun,
who was arrested, convicted and
imprisoned in 1978, was not in
cluded In the pardon.

speak critically about the Soviet
Union. "This is In line with our
policy of democratization."
Gerasimov said.
In reaction to Geraslmov's an
nouncement, Bonner told
reporters: "I am very happy and I
am waiting for the day when all
these 140 people are home with
their families."
Among those released are many
names hardly known in the West
but celebrated In the Soviet dissi
dent community. They Include:
Yuri Shikhanovich, who edited
the human rights journal
Chronicle of Higher Events, and
Sergei Grigoryants, a literary
critic who had been imprisoned at
Chistopol, near Kazan.
Those released had either asked
for pardon or agreed not to con

tlnue the crime they had been
convicted for, Gerasimov said. He
added that the prisoners signed
documents before their release in
which "they probably said that
they would not continue with any
anti-Soviet propaganda."
Two groups of prisoners were
released, Gerasimov said, on Feb.
2 and Feb. 9. Another group of
"about the same number," is now
under review, he said.
Positive action on all the cases
would bring the total number to
double the current figure of 140,
the spokesman said.
The action still left an un
specified number of political pris
oner cases unresolved. Estimates
of the number of Soviets im
prisoned for crimes of conscience
or political acts ranges widely;
many Western experts put the fig
ure at 1,000.
The Jewish activist loslf Begun,
who was arrested, convicted and
imprisoned in 1978, was not in
cluded In the pardon.
