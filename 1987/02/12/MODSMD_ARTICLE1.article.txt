### CHRIS MARIO 
A Jackson Browne concert
originally scheduled for Memorial
Auditorium will be held March 8
at the San Jose Center for the Per
forming Arts.
Browne's show was scheduled
for early May in Memorial
Auditorium, but when the per
former changed the show to
March, scheduling conflicts made
it impossible to find an on
campus site, said Mary Novarro,
one of the concert's organizers.
"The people at (University)
Events and Services bent over
backwards to heip us, but with
such short notice, there wasn't
much they could do," said
Novarro, a coordinator of the Palo
Alto-Stanford Medical Aid Com
mittee for Central America
(PASMAC).
PASMAC, an organization of
Stanford faculty and students
that sends medical supplies to
Nicaragua and El Salvador, hopes
to raise $10,000 with the concert,
Novarro said.
Browne, whose recent album,
"Lives in the Balance." contains
songs regarding U.S. policies in
Central America, will donate his
time for the concert as part of a
short benefit tour for Central
American advocacy groups.
PASMAC was founded in 1984
by medical students Chris Stoehr
and Sarah Scher to combat what
Stoehr called "the unequal distri
bution of health care in the
world."
"It seems absurd to me. working
at Stanford, where one baby has a
$2 million medical bill, that
children elsewhere can't even get an
tibiotics," Stoehr said.
Since its inception, PASMAC has
raised $30,000 in money and medical
supplies. The organization supports a
hospital and a barrio clinic in Managua,
Nicaragua, as well as an El Salvadoran
organization that assists rural refugees
displaced by the government's anti

insurgency activities.
"We mainly focus on sending supplies,
but we also try to educate about the
United States' role In Central America
and its contribution to declining health
standards there," Novarro said.
Stanford students can get tickets at
the Tresidder ticket office starting
today. Tickets will cost $17.50 or
$18.50. Special tickets, which Include
admission to a reception for Browne and
his band following the concert, are
available through PASMAC for $75.
