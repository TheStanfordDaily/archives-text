# Shultz protested CIA deception plot

### 
WASHINGTON - Secretary of
State George Shultz held a tense
showdown with President Reagan
last Nov. 20 after learning that tes
timony prepared for CIA Director
William Casey would have
deliberately misinformed the Sen
ate Select Committee on Intelli
gence the next day about arms
sales to Iran, according to in
formed officials.
Shultz's urgent appeal to the
president in the White House
living quarters and a parallel ob
jection made to the Justice De
partment by the secretary's legal
counsel prompted Attorney Gen
eral Edwin Meese 111 to begin an
investigation that culminated in
his disclosure five days later that
money from the Iran arms deal
had been diverted to aid the
Nicaraguan rebels.
Casey's proposed testimony,
drafted by the Central Intelligence
Agency and National Security
Council, would have disclaimed
any U.S. government knowledge of
a shipment of Hawk anti-aircraft
missiles from Israel to Iran in No

vember 1985, the sources said.
Casey was to be the first witness
in the first congressional hearing
into the Iran affair.
The CIA director planned to tell
the Senate committee that the
shipment, which was delivered to
Iran by a CIA-controlled airline,
was believed by all U.S. officials in
volved at the time to be "oil drilling
equipment."
In fact, according to recent tes
timony and evidence uncovered by
congressional investigators,
Casey, Shultz, Reagan and other
top administration officials knew
before the November 1985 ship
ment that the cargo was Hawk
missiles intended as part of an
arms-for-hostages deal. The "oil
drilling" explanation was a cover
story furnished at the time by NSC
aide Lt. Col. Oliver North to CIA of
ficials arranging for the aircraft
and flight logistics, according to
the recent Senate intelligence
committee report on the matter.
As Casey's Nov. 21 date with the
Senate committee approached,
two senior aides to Shultz, Under

secretary of State Michael Ar
macost and legal adviser Abraham
Sofaer, were briefed Nov. 18 by
Vice Adm. John Poindexter. then
White House national security ad
viser. Later that day, at their re
quest, Armacost and Sofaer were
permitted to see a copy of the draft
of Casey's planned testimony,
which included the oil drilling
story. They subsequently reported
back to Shultz.
"This very much concerned
Shultz" because he knew that
senior government officials had
been aware at the time that the
shipment contained Hawk
missiles, one knowledgeable offi
cial said.
Shultz also was "shocked" by
Reagan's lack of accurate informa
tion about the Iran arms deal in
the Nov. 19 televised news confer
ence centering on the issue, ac
cording to White House and State
Department officials. In the secre
tary's view, insufficient and even
erroneous information was com
ing from Poindexter, who had
briefed Reagan before the news

conference and who was coordi
nating the drafting of Casey's tes
timony.
On the evening of Nov. 20.
Shultz took his concerns to
Reagan in what appears to have
been a showdown session that left
administration policy and
Shultz's future hanging in the bal
ance.
Shultz had already publicly dis
tanced himself from the White
House policy on Iran in the three
weeks since the story became
public. He had been urging
Reagan to announce that there
would be no more arms sales and
that the State Department would
be clearly placed in charge of
policy toward Iran.
The recent Senate report,
relying on information gathered
by Meese, said Shultz at the Nov.
20 meeting "informed the presi
dent that some of the statements
being made about the Iran arms
affair would not stand up to
scrutiny."
