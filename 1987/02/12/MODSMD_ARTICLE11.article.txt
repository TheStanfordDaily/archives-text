# Ambassador: Arms control within reach
## 
### 
MOSCOW — Departing U.S. Ambassador Ar
thur Hart man said yesterday that some Soviet-
American arms control agreements are
"practically within reach" if the Kremlin would
drop its demand for a package deal that would
include restrictions on the U.S. Strategic
Defense Initiative.
Hartman also urged Soviet leader Mikhail
Gorbachev to visit the United States this year
even if there is no accord on reduction of nu
clear weapons.
In an unusual on-the-record news confer
ence, the retiring American diplomat praised
the Soviet leadership for improvements in
some aspects of human rights, but said there
had been no progress in other areas.
Gorbachev may unveil some new arms con
trol ideas Monday when he speaks before 850
foreign delegates to a Moscow forum on a
nuclear-free world. Hartman said.
Some headway has been made at the Geneva
arms talks, he said, by defining differences be
tween the two sides.
But Hartman, who was one of President
Reagan's team of advisers at the summit
meeting with Gorbachev in Reykjavik. Iceland,
last October, said it was possible to make

agreements in two major areas — strategic
missiles and medium-range missiles.
"There are elements of this that are practi
cally within reach today, and we should go for
them," he said.
He mentioned a 50 percent cut in Soviet and
American strategic missiles and elimination of
medium-range missiles by both sides in
Europe, with each side allowed to keep 100 of
the latter on its own territory.
"They would be good agreements," Hartman
said, but he recalled that Gorbachev had
linked agreements on those two areas to strict
curbs of research on Reagan's Strategic
Defense Initiative, the space-based missile
defense system also known as "Star Wars."
"They have not broken that linkage," he
said, although he added that Soviet scientists
had shown greater flexibility in discussing
ways to curtail Star Wars research without
stopping the program entirely.
Hartman, a career Foreign Service officer,
resigned his post after 50 years in Moscow to
return to private life. Reagan has nominated
Jack Matlock Jr., a member of the National Se
curity Council staff, to replace him.
In a farewell meeting with American

reporters, Hartman said he favored higher
level Soviet-American meetings if there is pro
gress at the Geneva arms talks.
"With or without progress," he added, "a
visit (by Gorbachev) to the United States is
long overdue. No Soviet leader has been to the
United States since Brezhnev's trip there (in
1973).
"A visit to our country and a visit around our
country would be worthwhile," Hartman
added.
Gorbachev agreed to visit the United States
in 1986, and Reagan said he would come to the
Soviet Union in 1987, but Gorbachev decided
against an American trip, saying that there
were insufficient prospects of an arms control
accord.
Hartman said he had told Soviet officials
that it would be better to reach an agreement
on arms control this year so that it can be
ratified by the U.S. Senate before presidential
election maneuvering becomes intense in
1988.
"I am absolutely convinced that any agree
ment the president signs would sail through
the Senate (in 1987)," he added.
