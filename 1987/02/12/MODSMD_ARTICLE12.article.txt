# Coroner plans to conduct interviews about Cox
## 
### MARK LAWRENCE Senior staff writer 
The San Mateo County Coroner's Office
has decided to conduct a "psychological
autopsy on Allan Cox to help determine
whether the Stanford Earth Sciences dean
committed suicide.
According to "autopsy" procedure, a
panel of psychologists, psychiatrists and
social workers will interview Cox's friends
and colleagues about his mental state prior
to his death last month. The panel will also
review police reports and conduct Its own
investigation of the bicycle crash in which
Cox died, according to David Fortman,
chief investigator for the coroner's office.
After the procedure is completed, in
about a month, the coroner's office will
make a ruling on the cause of Cox's death,
Fortman said. That ruling will be public in
formation.

A "psychological autopsy" Is routine in
cases Involving "unusual or unexplained
circumstances," said Fortman, adding that
the procedure often yields valuable results.
Although the coroner's office Is respon
sible for making a final statement on the
cause of death, the San Mateo County
Sheriffs Office conducted its own investiga
tion and decided the crash was suicide,
possibly over a pending criminal complaint
of child molestation against Cox.
Cox. a geologist noted for his work In
paleomagnetism and plate tectonics theory,
died on Jan. 27 when his bicycle crashed
Into a tree along Tunitas Creek Road near
his home in Woodside. The next day a San
Mateo County detective, who had been in
vestigating the molestation complaint, said
the death might be suicide.
The detective, Michael Dirickson. said
there was strong evidence pointing to
suicide.
