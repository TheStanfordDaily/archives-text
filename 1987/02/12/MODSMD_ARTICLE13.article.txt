# Profs, vote on tenure
## 
### CHRIS MYERS Editorial staff 
The History Department voted yesterday
on whether to grant tenure to Asst. Prof.
Stephen Ferruolo, according to History
Prof. Paul Seaver, chairman of the tenure
review committee assigned to Ferruolo's
case.
The result of the vote is confidential and
will be sent to Dean of Humanities and
Sciences Norman Wessells, who makes final
decisions in all tenure cases.
"If they (the History Department) voted in
favor, they'll forward that to us (the Office of
Humanities and Sciences) for approval,"
Wessells said. "If they voted against, they
have to explain to us why."

Wessells said that the decision would be
finalized in four to six weeks.
Yesterday's vote was the second the His
tory Department has called regarding Fer
ruolo's tenure.
Last January the department voted to
deny tenure to Ferruolo. Ferruolo appealed
the ruling in May, charging that new
criteria for evaluating tenure candidates
had been improperly applied in his case.
Last August a University grievance officer
ruled in favor of Ferruolo, ordering a
rehearing of the case.
The three-member tenure review commit
tee assigned to evaluate Ferruolo presented
its recommendation to the History Depart
ment at a meeting last Wednesday.
Ferruolo was unavailable for comment
last night.
