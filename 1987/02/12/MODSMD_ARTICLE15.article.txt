This is a night from hell. The gods of
typesetting have frowned upon Camelot.
The Knights of the Round Table — and
Indeed, the Knights of the Light Table —
have dealt us a cruel blow. Ah, cruel fate!
The precious inches of a former King lie
on the cutting room floor. Many battles
were fought, but who won the war?
If this isn't long enough, surely, we all
are doomed.
