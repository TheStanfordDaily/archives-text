						STANFORD DAILY An Independent Newspaper Choice housing? 
### 
Recently, the Subcommittee on Residen
tial Education and Advising (SREA) pro
posed limiting the ability of incoming fresh
men to chose whether they lived In four-class
or all-frosh dormitories and on single-sex or
coed floors. Instead, incoming freshmen
would be told over the summer that their
choice of a Western Culture program will be
the deciding factor in their dorm placement.
For several reasons, the recommendations of
the subcommittee should not be instituted
by Residential Education.
First of all, freedom of choice is an impor
tant goal that should be maintained when
assigning freshmen to residences. At pres
ent, a vast majority of incoming freshmen
choose to live in all-frosh dorms; many can
not be accomodated. Similarly, those choos
ing to live in coed halls cannot always be
given their first choice. Nevertheless, a great
plurality of incoming freshmen do end up in
the living situation they want, and those who
(for a variety of personal reasons) want to live
in single-sex halls or four-class dorms almost
always have their choices met.
In addition, telling incoming students that
their Western Culture choice dictates what
dorm they will be placed in presents many
problems. Imagine the burden being placed
on an incoming student who has to choose
what Western Culture class to enroll in:
Based on just a few paragraphs describing
each track in the "Approaching Stanford"
book, a student is not only ranking what
year-long sequence he or she would like to be
a part of, but is also, in effect, choosing a
dorm. Freshmen who have visited Stanford,
as well as others who have relatives or friends
here, could readily ascertain which dorm
would be housing which Western Culture

track. The result could lead an informed
freshman to pick a track based solely on the
percentage possibility of being placed in a
more attractive dorm. Is this outcome, which
seems likely to occur, in accordance with the
goals of Res Ed?
Furthermore, there is no valid reason to
think that a Wilbur Hall full of freshmen en
rolled in the history track will be more intel
lectually stimulating than a Wilbur Hall com
prised of students enrolled in all tracks. As
matters stand now, there is so little differ
ence between reading lists in the various
tracks (a show of hands please — how many
freshmen out there read Descartes last
week?) that the new recommendations by
the SREA seem arbitrary and contradictory
to Res Ed's purported goals.
Besides, a dorm full of freshmen who all
hear the same lectures about the same topics
is bound to be intellectually stagnant and not
more stimulating. The Residential Educa
tion system would seem to work best when
freshmen enrolled in different tracks could
share different insights on the same author
or historical period.
Res Ed should reconsider the recommen
dations made by the SREA. Incoming fresh
men deserve as much choice as possible to
make their first year at Stanford intellectu
ally and socially stimulating. The new
proposals, however, could create freshmen
dorms that are too narrowly focused and
dangerously homogeneous. Res Ed must
realize that diversity and intellectual
stimulation are not mutually exclusive —
indeed, they are complementary — and it
should avoid arbitrary tampering, no matter
how "experimental."
