Suicide story
just gossip
As a resident of Branner Hall, I
was deeply disturbed by the arti
cle about the recent suicide at
tempt — made by another resi
dent of Branner — that appeared
on the front page (Daily, Feb. 9).
The Daily must better make the
distinction between news and
gossip. Any story of a suicide
attempt by a student, when re
ported as in the article mentioned
above, must be considered little
more than gossip. The story in
cluded information identifying
the dorm involved and contained
insinuations of severe mental
illness, at a time when only test
ing is being conducted. Even
worse, it was reported while the
student was still on campus, and
could possibly return to classes.
If a female student got drunk
and had sex with every member of
a large fraternity, would this also
be reported on the front page?
No, fewer people would like to
read this story! And would The
Daily also mention the dorm the
student was from?
Aside from the purely objective
journalistic flaws in the decision
to run the story, a complete dis
respect for the privacy of the
individual is clearly evident.
Reading about his personal plight

on the front page of The Daily,
which everyone he knows will be
reading, can only serve to further
intensify whatever problems led
him to this attempt.
I sincerely hope that more dis
cretion will be exercised in the
future whenever events involving
the private lives of students come
to The Daily's attention.

Homosexual
acts are sinful
A recent viewpoint (Daily, Feb.
5) stated that the Christian view
holds that homosexuality is a sin.
As a practicing Catholic, I feel it
is necessary to clarify the position
of the Catholic Church in this
regard.
Every truly human action re
quires free will. An action per
formed without free will is not
human, but merely animal.
Homosexuality is an inborn char
acteristic of a person. Since
homosexuality is a state and not
an action, it is not culpable and is
therefore not sinful. Homosexual
activity, because it involves
human action without a good
moral end, is sinful. Thus, Catho
lic teaching clearly differentiates
between homosexuality and
homosexual action, and urges us
to pray for those who are

homosexual that they may lead
chaste lives in view of their diffi
culties.

Yeah Leonard!
Three cheers for Leonard Adler!
In an age when student govern
ment leaders seem occupied with
Herculean projects, ambitious
task forces on every conceivable
topic and $100,000 renovation
projects, it is nice to see that at
least one member of the ASSU
establishment has done some
thing to improve the everyday
lives of students.
Leonard took it upon himself to
try to accomplish a workable goal
that everyone who has lived in a
Stanford residence can appreci
ate. He single-handedly managed
to get a company to install change
machines in the Wilbur laundry
room on a trial basis. This was no
small chore. Companies recognize
that laundry rooms are not very
secure places and so it was no
small leap of faith for them to
trust their machines to our dor
mitories.
If all goes well at Wilbur, other
large dorms may soon see change
machines. Thanks, Leonard.
Keep up the good work!
