# U.S. can't afford isolationism
## 
### 
I've never been a big Caspar Weinberger fan,
but he made a point last month that really hit a
cord with me. In a speech he made Jan. 15. the
Secretary of Defense said, "I think we should
all be concerned that overreaction to the Iran
controversy could lead to another dangerous
period of American withdrawal, isolationism
and confusion about its proper role in the
world."

It is Important for the press and for the
American people to get to the bottom of the
Iranscam/Contragate/Iragua mess. Americans
have a right to know whether their president
Intentionally broke the laws of the United
States or whether he merely failed to notice
that his closest advisers were breaking the law.
All those House and Senate investigating com
mittees are Important. And it's interesting to
know that Ollie North was hospitalized for psy
chological problems or that Nancy Reagan
hates Don Regan.
But it's time for the American press and
people to realize that the Iragua affair has a
global significance. Americans cannot simply
turn inward to deal with this issue. After all. it
is a crisis of foreign policy as well as a domestic
disgrace.
Americans must also recognize the im
mensely Important role that the United States
plavs on the world stage. The strength and

credibility of the American government affects
millions, if not billions of people around the
world. While America is cleaning house, it
must not forget to keep an eye on the rest of
the neighborhood.
Polls from West Germany and Great Britain
point out the problem. According to surveys
done for the Los Angeles Times and The Econ
omist. 87 percent of Britons and 86 percent of
Germans believe (hat Reagan is lying about his
involvement in the Iragua plot. Sixty-five per
cent of Britons think that U.S. foreign policy is
"weak and disorganized." Eighty-four percent
of Germans think that Iragua has "damaged
the credibility of the United States as the
leader of the Western alliance."
American allies in places other than Western
Europe have been upset by this affair. Canada,
an important economic and strategic ally, has
been a victim of U.S. skullduggery. According
to Canadian officials, the Iragua deal, with its
use of Canadian middle men to finance the
deal, may have violated major Canadian laws.
The Royal Canadian Mounted Police are inves
tigating.
The Mounties aren't the only ones who al
ways get their man. Allan Fotheringham, one
of Canada's premier Washington-watchers,
recently called Reagan "an old man whose lazy
and casual attitude toward leadership allowed
the crazed cowboys beneath him to bend the
law just as much as Nixon's lads did."
And pity the poor folks in Israel, who tried to
help out an ally, and ended up getting blamed
for the whole thing — as if a tiny nation, eco
nomically and militarily dependent on the
United States, could really dictate American
foreign policy!

While Mikhail Gorbachev scores Impressive
PR victories abroad, U.S. foreign policy
stagnates. And while the Soviet Union sud
denly seems like a country on the move,
America seems as moribund as the sick old
man who leads the country.
These are Just a few examples of the
ramaflcations of the Iran-contra arms deal
around the world. And this list does not begin
to take into account the impact of the U.S.
blunder on relations in Latin America and the
Middle East. But my point here is not to list all
the various ways in which the American gov
ernment has messed up. It is rather to point
out that Americans cannot pretend that Iragua
is purely an internal problem.
Weinberger is right. The United States can
not afford isolation, be it splendid or
shamefaced. The nation cannot afford to get so
involved in untangling this mess that it
neglects the rest of U.S. foreign policy.
Admittedly, this is a wonderful issue for the
press, for the congressional committees, for
armchair politicians. But America must lift Its
eyes and look beyond its borders. There's a
whole wide world out there and America can
not afford to ignore it.
When Jesse Jackson spoke here last month,
he called for more internationalism in Ameri
can government, for a recognition that the
United States must work with other countries.
Who would have thought that Casper
Weinberger and Jesse Jackson would agree on
anything?

Polls from West Germany and Great Britain
point out the problem. According to surveys
done for the Los Angeles Times and The Econ
omist. 87 percent of Britons and 86 percent of
Germans believe (hat Reagan is lying about his
involvement in the Iragua plot. Sixty-five per

"weak and disorganized." Eighty-four percent
of Germans think that Iragua has "damaged
the credibility of the United States as the
leader of the Western alliance."
American allies in places other than Western
Europe have been upset by this affair. Canada,
an important economic and strategic ally, has
been a victim of U.S. skullduggery. According
to Canadian officials, the Iragua deal, with its
use of Canadian middle men to finance the
deal, may have violated major Canadian laws.

not afford isolation, be it splendid or

involved in untangling this mess that it
neglects the rest of U.S. foreign policy.

I've never been a big Caspar Weinberger fan,
but he made a point last month that really hit a
cord with me. In a speech he made Jan. 15. the
Secretary of Defense said, "I think we should
all be concerned that overreaction to the Iran
controversy could lead to another dangerous
period of American withdrawal, isolationism
and confusion about its proper role in the
world."

It is Important for the press and for the
American people to get to the bottom of the
Iranscam/Contragate/Iragua mess. Americans
have a right to know whether their president
Intentionally broke the laws of the United
States or whether he merely failed to notice
that his closest advisers were breaking the law.
All those House and Senate investigating com
mittees are Important. And it's interesting to
know that Ollie North was hospitalized for psy
chological problems or that Nancy Reagan
hates Don Regan.
But it's time for the American press and
people to realize that the Iragua affair has a
global significance. Americans cannot simply
turn inward to deal with this issue. After all. it
is a crisis of foreign policy as well as a domestic
disgrace.
Americans must also recognize the im
mensely Important role that the United States
plavs on the world stage. The strength and

credibility of the American government affects
millions, if not billions of people around the
world. While America is cleaning house, it
must not forget to keep an eye on the rest of
the neighborhood.
