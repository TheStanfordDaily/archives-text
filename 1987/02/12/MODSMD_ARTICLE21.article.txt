# Workers' pay is fair
## 
### 
Jim Durkin's recent column (Daily, Feb. 3) about
the high cost of food service perpetuated a miscon
ception commonly found at Stanford. Students here
are always complaining about the high cost of food
service, and rightfully so — $7.65 for a food service
dinner is ridiculous. In response to these unreason
able prices students naturally look for someone to
blame. Unfortunately, in this society, the natural
thing to do is blame the workers. To blame the
workers, however, incorrectly assumes that overly
inflated wages are the cause of high Food Service
prices. It also doesn't fully consider the human side
of the importance of wages and benefits to University
Food Service workers.

Durkin compares the high cost of Stanford's Food
Service to Yale's lower prices — so we decided to do a
little research to try and find out the reason such a
gap exists. At Stanford, most Food Service jobs fall
under the "Food Service I, Food Service II and Food
Service III" classifications. The beginning salaries of
these jobs range from $6.91 to $7.59 per hour. We
called the president of the union at Yale, and he told
us that the majority of Yale's food service workers
start at $7.50 and $8.00 per hour. Yet Yale's meals
cost about half of Stanford's. The cause of Stanford's
high prices clearly doesn't seem to be workers'
wages.
Durkin also compares Food Service to Saga and
wonders why Saga can provide a similar service at
lower prices. The answer is that Saga doesn't provide
a similar service; it cuts corners everywhere It can.
For example, according to a Saga cook, Saga often
uses cheap meat, the second-to-lowest grade
available. University Food Service, in contrast, gen
erally uses high quality meat and produce. This
allows Saga to charge lower prices for lower quality
food and still make a profit.
Moreover, Durkin should journey back into the
Saga kitchen sometime. If he did, he would find that
it was unclean and unhealthy because it is so under
staffed. When I went back there the morning I read
Durkin's column, I saw spills all over the floor. Dust,
dirt and accumulated crud were all over the kitchen.
The Saga pantry upstairs looked sickeningly dirty —
Saga also has a roach problem. This is a real contrast
to Food Service's clean kitchens, which are kept
clean by adequate staffing. Most students probably
prefer to know that their food is prepared in a
kitchen that doesn't have any roaches in it.
And if Durkin has any illusions that Saga would be
able to keep Food Service prices down, he should
think twice. Saga was kicked out of San Francisco
State's food service in 1985 because of low quality
and high prices. And San Francisco State is not an
anomaly — there have been complaints about Saga's
food service on other campuses around the country.

But there was something more that disturbed us
about Durkin's column. When Durkin says that
workers here "collect benefits like sick leave, dis
ability insurance, paid vacations, paid personal days
and all those other good things that go along with
working for a behemoth like Stanford U.," hopefully
he didn't mean to imply that workers shouldn't
receive such benefits, or that Stanford workers
should receive the minimum wage that Denny's
workers do. Surely we can afford decent benefits to
people who devote years of their life to working to
make Stanford a better place.
We should also remember that these benefits
didn't always "go along with" working for Stanford.
At one time, there was no union here. Workers here
can remember co-workers from that time with
salaries so low that they lived below the poverty level
and were eligible for welfare benefits. Many Food Ser
vice workers had to work split shifts, meaning they
worked in the morning, had a break for a few hours,
and then worked hours in the evening. Thus, they
were at work for 12 to 14 hours every day and were
paid for only eight. This meant that many Stanford
workers, especially those who couldn't afford trans
portation, missed spending any time with their
families and watching their children grow up. Do we
want workers who prepare our food living in such
conditions?
Actually, we should all be aware that many of the
workers at Tresidder today live in such conditions. It
would be interesting to know who told Durkin that
Saga employees get "similar salaries and benefits."
This is simply not true. A few months ago, the start
ing wage for some Tresidder workers was >4.40 per
hour. This meant that after taxes one worker with
two children to support took home about <3.75. For
many, these wages mean living below the poverty
level. When you consider the high rents in this area,
virtually all of that worker's salary would be going
just for rent, leaving little for food, clothing transpor
tation and other living expenses.
So we agree with Durkin: "You might want to
think a little before you march in the next United
Stanford Workers rally." You might want to think
about whether you want the workers who prepare
your food to be unable to spend time with, or ade
quately provide for, their families so that you can
save a little bit of money. You might want to think
about the conditions that workers at this University
used to live In and the conditions in which many
Saga workers currently live. And finally, you might
want to think about how hard workers here had to
fight to get a union and to improve their wages and
benefits, and how important it is for the lives of
Stanford Food Service workers and their families
that these wages and benefits stay that way. Remem
ber, these issues have very serious Implications for
people's lives.

receive such benefits, or that Stanford workers
should receive the minimum wage that Denny's
workers do. Surely we can afford decent benefits to
people who devote years of their life to working to
make Stanford a better place.
We should also remember that these benefits
didn't always "go along with" working for Stanford.
At one time, there was no union here. Workers here
can remember co-workers from that time with
salaries so low that they lived below the poverty level
and were eligible for welfare benefits. Many Food Ser
vice workers had to work split shifts, meaning they
worked in the morning, had a break for a few hours,
and then worked hours in the evening. Thus, they
were at work for 12 to 14 hours every day and were
paid for only eight. This meant that many Stanford
workers, especially those who couldn't afford trans
portation, missed spending any time with their
families and watching their children grow up. Do we
want workers who prepare our food living in such
conditions?
Actually, we should all be aware that many of the
workers at Tresidder today live in such conditions. It
would be interesting to know who told Durkin that
Saga employees get "similar salaries and benefits."
This is simply not true. A few months ago, the start
ing wage for some Tresidder workers was >4.40 per
hour. This meant that after taxes one worker with
two children to support took home about <3.75. For
many, these wages mean living below the poverty
level. When you consider the high rents in this area,
virtually all of that worker's salary would be going
just for rent, leaving little for food, clothing transpor
tation and other living expenses.
So we agree with Durkin: "You might want to
think a little before you march in the next United
Stanford Workers rally." You might want to think
about whether you want the workers who prepare
your food to be unable to spend time with, or ade
quately provide for, their families so that you can
save a little bit of money. You might want to think
about the conditions that workers at this University
used to live In and the conditions in which many
Saga workers currently live. And finally, you might
want to think about how hard workers here had to
fight to get a union and to improve their wages and
benefits, and how important it is for the lives of
Stanford Food Service workers and their families
that these wages and benefits stay that way. Remem
ber, these issues have very serious Implications for
people's lives.

Jim Durkin's recent column (Daily, Feb. 3) about
the high cost of food service perpetuated a miscon
ception commonly found at Stanford. Students here
are always complaining about the high cost of food
service, and rightfully so — $7.65 for a food service
dinner is ridiculous. In response to these unreason
able prices students naturally look for someone to
blame. Unfortunately, in this society, the natural
thing to do is blame the workers. To blame the
workers, however, incorrectly assumes that overly
inflated wages are the cause of high Food Service
prices. It also doesn't fully consider the human side
of the importance of wages and benefits to University
Food Service workers.

Durkin compares the high cost of Stanford's Food
Service to Yale's lower prices — so we decided to do a
little research to try and find out the reason such a
gap exists. At Stanford, most Food Service jobs fall
under the "Food Service I, Food Service II and Food
Service III" classifications. The beginning salaries of
these jobs range from $6.91 to $7.59 per hour. We
called the president of the union at Yale, and he told
us that the majority of Yale's food service workers
start at $7.50 and $8.00 per hour. Yet Yale's meals
cost about half of Stanford's. The cause of Stanford's
high prices clearly doesn't seem to be workers'
wages.
Durkin also compares Food Service to Saga and
wonders why Saga can provide a similar service at
lower prices. The answer is that Saga doesn't provide
a similar service; it cuts corners everywhere It can.
For example, according to a Saga cook, Saga often
uses cheap meat, the second-to-lowest grade
available. University Food Service, in contrast, gen
erally uses high quality meat and produce. This
allows Saga to charge lower prices for lower quality
food and still make a profit.
Moreover, Durkin should journey back into the
Saga kitchen sometime. If he did, he would find that
it was unclean and unhealthy because it is so under
staffed. When I went back there the morning I read
Durkin's column, I saw spills all over the floor. Dust,
dirt and accumulated crud were all over the kitchen.
The Saga pantry upstairs looked sickeningly dirty —
Saga also has a roach problem. This is a real contrast
to Food Service's clean kitchens, which are kept
clean by adequate staffing. Most students probably
prefer to know that their food is prepared in a
kitchen that doesn't have any roaches in it.
And if Durkin has any illusions that Saga would be
able to keep Food Service prices down, he should
think twice. Saga was kicked out of San Francisco
State's food service in 1985 because of low quality
and high prices. And San Francisco State is not an
anomaly — there have been complaints about Saga's
food service on other campuses around the country.

But there was something more that disturbed us
about Durkin's column. When Durkin says that
workers here "collect benefits like sick leave, dis
ability insurance, paid vacations, paid personal days
and all those other good things that go along with
working for a behemoth like Stanford U.," hopefully
he didn't mean to imply that workers shouldn't
receive such benefits, or that Stanford workers
should receive the minimum wage that Denny's
workers do. Surely we can afford decent benefits to
people who devote years of their life to working to
make Stanford a better place.
