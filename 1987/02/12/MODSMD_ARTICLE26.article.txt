Trattoria Ramona
541 Bryant St, Palo Alto
Trattoria Ramona, located off of University
Avenue In downtown Palo Alto, Is a fairly ex
pensive restaurant — but one well worth the
money. This Italian delight leaves little to be
desired, offering a pleasant atmosphere, excel
lent service and authentic Italian food.
Having been there before, I went to the Trat
toria with high expectations; needless to say, I
wasn't disappointed. The comforting decor —
highlighted by oak wine racks, lace curtains
and white table cloths — was quaint and invit
ing. The antique kerosene lamps, authentic
Italian music and tuxedo-clad waiters set the
mood for a memorable evening of fine dining.
The menu had offerings for both adven
turous and timid diners. The 11 pasta selec
tions, all prepared with homemade noodles,
ranged from canneloni stuffed with chicken,
veal and spinach to Fettucini Alfredo. The
numerous fresh fish and house specials of
fered a wide range of choices and the wine list
provided an excellent selection of Italian
favorites.
In addition to the menu, five specials are
available every night that are usually sure-fire
winners. I would recommend spending the ex
tra *3.95 and buying the complete dinner,
which includes — along with your entree — an
antlpasto plate, pasta or soup of the day,
spumoni or sherbert, and coffee. This is a fill
ing meal and well worth the price.

This Italian delight
leaves little to be
desired.

After contemplating the menu, I chose the
Saltinbocca Romana and my friend selected
the Mahi Mahi, one of the evening's specials.
The Saltinbocca was thinly pounded veal scal
lopini topped with prosciuto in a sage sherry
sauce. The prosciuto was nicely set off by the
delicate sauce, and the combination perfectly
complemented the tender veal. Each flavor was
distinct but not overpowering.
The Mahi Mahi was sauteed in a creamy
pesto sauce and cooked to perfection. Both
dishes came with vegetables of the day that
were pleasant but not outstanding.
With our meal, we ordered a bottle of Cortese
di Gavi, a crisp, medium- bodied, dry white
wine. This is just one of the excellent Italian
wines on Trattoria Ramona's extensive wine
list.
Finally, be sure not to pass up the savory
dessert cart; it just may be the best part of your
meal. I indulged in the Some Fredo. a dripping
rum cake layered with fresh cream and topped
with shaved dark chocolate. My friend chose
the house specialty, chocolate almond torte, an
extremely rich torte made of an inch-thick
layer of pure chocolate topped by a delightful
almond paste. Both desserts were delicious
and an excellent finish to a splendid meal.
Trattoria Ramona shouldn't be missed by
anyone who enjoys Italian cuisine. For those of
you who aren't partial to fine Italian food. Trat
