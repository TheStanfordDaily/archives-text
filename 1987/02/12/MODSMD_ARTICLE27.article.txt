This Italian food haven has a wide variety of
dishes to choose from at moderate prices.
Like most traditional Italian restaurants, it
is a family establishment, with the owner act
ing also as chef.
To some extent, Joe's rellects its industrial
area environment. The service is quick and
most major credit cards are accepted. The res
taurant enjoys a brisk lunch crowd.
All the same, Joe's provides a pleasant place
for a traditional Italian meal or a mixture of
American and Italian dishes.
The furnishings in the establishment are
made of thick, dark wood. The walls and car
peting are also in dark colors. Spotlighting
gives a sense of privacy in the midst of a busy
dining area.
The menu offers a wide range of choices —
from French dip to veal piccata to top sirloin —
but the emphasis is on quality Italian cooking.
For appetizers, my guest and I shared an
tlpasto misto and baked mozzarella cheese
bread. The antipasto contained generous por
tions of ham, vegetables, salami, cheeses,
calamari and anchovies — all covered in a light
vinaigrette. The mozzarella dish consisted of
thick wedges of fried cheese covered with a
spicy red sauce.
To accompany our choices of seafood can
neloni and tortelllni alia bolognese, we selected
a bottle of Chateau Julien '82 Chardonnay.
The wine was light and fruity, as appropriate
with dessert as it was with dinner.
The canneloni was stufed with scallops,
crab, shrimp, ricotta cheese and mushrooms.
The dish was topped with a creamy clam sauce
and served with fresh steamed green beans
and cauliflower. The sauce was light and not
too heavily spiced.
The tortelllni was served with ground chuck,
mushrooms and tomatoes In a delicious spicy
red sauce. The tortelllni were plump and juicy,
the sauce was just rich enough and the herbs
and spices made the entire experience enjoy
able.
We rounded out the meal with zabaione (for
two) — a light, airy, warm wine custard with
strawberries. The berries provided an excellent
contrast to the tartness of the custard and
made for an interesting blend of flavors. This
dessert isn't for everyone, but for those who
would appreciate it, there is little better.
In all. Palo Alto Joe's provides an excellent
place to go for a reasonably priced, relaxed Ital
ian dining experience.
