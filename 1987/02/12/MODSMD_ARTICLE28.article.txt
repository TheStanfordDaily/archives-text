Rudolfo's
4020 El Camino, Palo Alto
This family owned and operated restaurant
reflects the best elements in casual Italian
dining. The mural, red lighting, outside tables
and checkered tablecloths create the impres
sion of a pleasant Italian cafe.
The cooking area is visible to all diners, and
watching the preparation of the food provides
some unusual dinner entertainment.
Also known for its take-out and pizzas,
Rudolfo's supplies a traditional supper menu
that's certain to please. The service is so quick
that the entrees are often served before the ap
petizers are finished.

Our soup and salad, provided with most
entrees, were perfect examples of homemade
dishes. The minestrone was served in a large
bowl and contained generous slices of carrots,
onions and celery in a rich broth. The salad
was just as large and was garnished with
beets, tomatos, pepperoni and red beans.
Generous portions of linguini with clams —
my selection — and lasagne — my guest's —
soon arrived. Each dish contained easily
enough food for more than one dinner.
The linguini with white clam sauce proved to
be delicious. The sauce was served piping hot.
the clams were tender and juicy, with the
spices adding just enough bite to the dish.
The incredibly fresh lasagne was an excellent
traditional dish, sure to please any palate. It
was thick, cheesy and incredibly rich.
The garlic bread and Chanti Classico La
Ripa '83 that we chose to accompany our meal
added substantially to our enjoyment. The
bread had only a hint of garlic and herbs. The
wine was a light, dry Italian red that suited the
linguini and lasagne equally well.

Our dessert choice was the chocolate Kahlua
cake. The cake was light and fluffy and
prepared with generous amounts of Kahlua. It
was dressed with layers of rich chocolate icing
and cream.
Any dinner selection will undoubtedly leave
the average restaurant-goer with a sizable por
tion of leftovers and the chinese-style take-out
containers supplied upon request seldom go
unused.
No reservations are accepted.
