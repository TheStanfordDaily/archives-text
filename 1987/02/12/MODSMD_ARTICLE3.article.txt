# Western Culture adapts readings
## 
### LORI SILVER Staff writer 
In response to the growing debate over
Western Culture, several Western Cul
ture tracks have made changes in their
reading requirements to include the
contributions of women and minorites,
according to track chairmen.
Although a new Western Culture
course focusing on the experiences and
contributions of women and minorities
will be offered for the first time spring
quarter, some track chairmen asserted
that they have been planning their mod
ifications since the debate on Western
Culture began last spring.
During spring quarter, freshmen have
the option to take "Western Culture: An
Alternative View" taught by Assoc. His
tory Prof. Clayborne Carson instead of
the final course in their Western Culture
track. Freshmen must file a request to
take the class by Friday. If more than
100 students request the class, they will
be selected randomly, said Paul Robin
son, professor of history and director of

the Western Culture program.
"I think the course is prompting other
tracks to engage in reform," Carson
said.
"People involved in other tracks are
open to the idea of including other read
ings by women and non-white racial
groups, but they are unfamiliar with the
options. My syllabus suggested some
possibilities, and they may come up
with some on their own," he said.
Great Works, Structured Liberal Edu
cation (SLE) and History made changes
in their reading lists last September and
will continue incorporating works by
minority and women writers spring
quarter, according to track heads.
"Radical changes" have been made in
the spring quarter Arts and Literature
track, according to Ronald Rebholz, pro
fessor of English. Rebholz is the winter
quarter lecturer for Arts and Literature.
"We just brought up and highlighted
the modern period in terms of the his
tory of European imperialism, non-
Western culture and the influence of
non-Western art and music," said En

glish Prof. Larry Friedlander, who
lectures for Arts and Literature spring
quarter.
The history of the feminist and the gay
liberation movements, and popular
images of sex and gender will also be
featured in Arts and Literature spring
quarter. Friedlander said.
The Great Works track is "changing in
response to the whole debate on Western
Culture," and not specifically in
response to Carson's new course, said
English Prof. David Riggs. Riggs is
chairman of the Great Works track.
"We changed about one-third of the
whole spring quarter list as a result of
the ongoing discussion which began
last spring. We actually worked out
changes before (Carson's) syllabus was
available. We never had a chance to look
at the syllabus," said Riggs.
When Carson came to speak to SLE
lectures and students last year, sugges
tions he made were incorporated into
this year's SLE program, said Lawrence
