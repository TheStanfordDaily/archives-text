## Shakespeare is McKellen's passion 
### CHRISTINA LEPNIS 
Kneeling before an imaginary
tombstone, lan McKellen brushes
away centuries of dust to lay bare
the name "Shakespeare."
With this simple and casually
metaphorical gesture, McKellen
conveys the essence of his purpose
on stage in "Acting Shakespeare,"
a solo enterprise in vibrant perfor
mance at the Marines Memorial

Theater in San Francisco. A
highly regarded English stage ac
tor and master of the classical
theater, McKellen makes It quite
plain that Shakespeare is his pas
sion.
Combining wit, versatility, an
engaging manner and educated
perspectives on Shakespearean
drama, he sets out to enlighten
and inspire. And he succeeds.
McKellen shares the stage with

a wooden chair that resembles a
throne. In which he occasionally
reposes. More often, he moves
tirelessly—but never randomly
—about the stage, looking slightly
wind-blown.
He establishes an instant rap
port with the audience by inviting
comments, supplying interesting
historical annotations and offer
ing anecdotal humor. He chats
leisurely about himself and recol
lects some of his experiences in
theater, from early student-acting
at Cambridge to his work with the
Royal Shakespeare Company.
His greatest moments, however,
occur when he interprets Shake
speare's most famous roles, enact
ing soliloquies and other excerpts
from the plays. Exhibiting an as
tonishing command of concentra
tion, he slips into an urgent Henry
V, an agonized, contorted Hamlet
and a lean and devious Richard
111. never ignoring the finer shades
of character that can be over
looked when a speech is delivered
out of the context of its original
scene.
Twenty-five years of experience
have coalesced with McKellen's
natural talents, enabling him to
comfortably alternate between
episodes of involved acting and
amiable lecturing. Indeed, his su
perb vocal control, seeming plas
ticity of face and ability to
naturally tie movement in with
verse are constant reminders of
the length and range of his experi
ence.
McKellen's treatment of Mac
beth deserves particular recogni
tion for its riveting intensity and
ominous evocation. The atmos
phere he conjures up, using only
himself, is so memorable that it is
doubtful the addition of
costumes, lighting effects, stage
design or props could greatly aug
ment it. In fact, at other points in

the performance, one hardly
notices that the sword being bran
dished or the dagger lifted really
isn't there at all.
The second half of McKellen's
program finds his instructional
mode acquiring a new dimension.
Using a specially selected passage
from Macbeth, he undertakes a
careful study of its language and
poetic structure to elucidate the
underlying sense. He then adjusts
his verbal delivery to this newly
derived understanding, making
choices regarding rhythm and in
tonation. It is, in his hands, a fas
cinating process.
McKellen explores the nature of
theater itself through passages
that deal with acting, such as
Hamlet's advice to the players or

Richard ll's histrionics. They all
carry metaphorical implications,
and McKellen's periodic attention
to them establishes the subject as
a strong thematic element in his
program.
Not surprisingly, there are no
meaningful references to the
lesser-known plays like "Cym
belline" or "Titus Andronicus."
The list of neglected plays even in
cludes many that are popular in
repertoire; McKellen does promise
a reasonably varied collection of
contrasting pieces, but a lesson in
esoterica this isn't. Had it been,
the production probably would
have never left England. As it is,
McKellen has been intermittently
touring worldwide since his first
version of the production ap

peared at the Edinburgh Festival
in 1977.
Not to exclude the literary and
theatrical personalities who dealt
with the Shakespearean legacy,
McKellen renders brief caricatures
of Samuel Pepys, David Garrick
and George Bernard Shaw with
comical aplomb.
At the heart of it all lies McKel
len's attitude that each play is an
adventure; the challenge in dis
covering the nuances and the
pleasure is in being able to linger
over a particular word or line of
verse. As a Shakespearean actor,
McKellen is an epicurean.
"Lan McKellen Acting Shake
speare" runs until March 1 at the
Marines Memorial Theater In San
Francisco.

McKellen is never solemn in his attitude toward Shakespeare; he balances his reverence with a humor
that makes his "Acting Shakespeare" all the more enjoyable.
