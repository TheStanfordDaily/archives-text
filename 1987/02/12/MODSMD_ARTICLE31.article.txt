# Books: John Lennon is still fascinating today

### BRUCE BROWN 
Skywriting By Word of Mouth
By John Lennon
New York: Harper and Row
200 pages
During the 19605, when the Beatles
were creating a new beat in the music
world and moving a generation with the
sound of their singing, John Lennon
managed to find the time to turn his voice
onto several other stages — most notably
those of politics and the international
peace movement. But he also quietly es
tablished himself as a writer not only of
lyrics, but also of prose and verse. He pub
lished two collections of his written
pieces, "In His Own Write" and "A
Spaniard in the Works."

And now we have "Skywriting by Word
of Mouth," a series of pictoral and
autobiographical vignettes and drawings,
most unrelated, that Lennon drafted
sometime between 1975 and 1980, when
he pulled himself away from the public
world and channeled most of his energy
into his family life. But this period we
know was productive artistically as well —
not only do we have this new book, but
also the album "Double Fantasy," released
in 1980, that showed a tempered
maturity to Lennon's music: the perman
ent romantic promise of "Just Like Start
ing Over," and the witty self-portrait of
"Watching the Wheels."
Considering Lennon after all these
years — six, in fact, since that bitter De
cember when Mark David Chapman

crawled out of an alleyway in New York
City and fired the bullets that taught
many people my age the old ritual of col
lective mourning — one is called into the
unevenness of this late work. Moments of
clarity and sensitivity play alongside of
gibberish and careless sexual innuendo,
and the humor is often off-color. One can
not possibly know what Lennon himself
might have edited out.
For the book has a rough unfinished
quality, much like the album "Milk and
Honey," a final group of songs, which
Yoko Ono, the musician's widow, released
in 1983. Indeed, one difficulty in dealing
with any new work of Lennon's is discern
ing what is solely his, and what has
Yoko's fingerprints. None of his work will
ever again come directly to us.

That said, one still feels this book is es
sentially John's. The brash, caustic wit
he revealed in press conferences and in
terviews is certainly present here. He at
tacks organized religion, saying that
Christians are "too busy condemning
themselves and others, or preaching at
people, or worse, still killing for Christ.
None of them understanding, or trying in
the least, to behave like a Christ." He also
attacks social stuffiness. He speaks of
Martha's Vineyard, for example, as
"Martha's Graveyard, home of the Quack
ers, a slightly balmy group, known only by
a loud moaning on Easter Sunday." And
even his old favorite, the British royalty,
receives scrutiny. He recalls seeing a
"photograph of a princess going down on
a racehorse. ... I remembered her proud

royal buttocks, once the private stock of
English society, but no longer. ... All we
need now is a picture of the Pope in drag
and the world is ours." And finally, he
pokes fun at himself, here playing off the
lyrics of "Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds"
— "I pictured myself on a boat in a river
with tangerine trees and nervous
dysplasia."
There are glimpses into Lennon's
metaphysics that invite comparison, in
the quality of their language, to his late
1960s track "Across the Universe" —
"Here, as 1 gaze ideas into your spiritual
unit, I find the strong indigo color vibrat
ing most strongly. You have traveled
throughout all the continents of your uni-
