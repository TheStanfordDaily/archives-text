# Books: John Lennon is still fascinating today

### BRUCE BROWN 
Skywriting By Word of Mouth
By John Lennon
New York: Harper and Row
200 pages
During the 19605, when the Beatles
were creating a new beat in the music
world and moving a generation with the
sound of their singing, John Lennon
managed to find the time to turn his voice
onto several other stages — most notably
those of politics and the international
peace movement. But he also quietly es
tablished himself as a writer not only of
lyrics, but also of prose and verse. He pub
lished two collections of his written
pieces, "In His Own Write" and "A
Spaniard in the Works."

And now we have "Skywriting by Word
of Mouth," a series of pictoral and
autobiographical vignettes and drawings,
most unrelated, that Lennon drafted
sometime between 1975 and 1980, when
he pulled himself away from the public
world and channeled most of his energy
into his family life. But this period we
know was productive artistically as well —
not only do we have this new book, but
also the album "Double Fantasy," released
in 1980, that showed a tempered
maturity to Lennon's music: the perman
ent romantic promise of "Just Like Start
ing Over," and the witty self-portrait of
"Watching the Wheels."
Considering Lennon after all these
years — six, in fact, since that bitter De
cember when Mark David Chapman

crawled out of an alleyway in New York
City and fired the bullets that taught
many people my age the old ritual of col
lective mourning — one is called into the
unevenness of this late work. Moments of
clarity and sensitivity play alongside of
gibberish and careless sexual innuendo,
and the humor is often off-color. One can
not possibly know what Lennon himself
might have edited out.
For the book has a rough unfinished
quality, much like the album "Milk and
Honey," a final group of songs, which
Yoko Ono, the musician's widow, released
in 1983. Indeed, one difficulty in dealing
with any new work of Lennon's is discern
ing what is solely his, and what has
Yoko's fingerprints. None of his work will
ever again come directly to us.

That said, one still feels this book is es
sentially John's. The brash, caustic wit
he revealed in press conferences and in
terviews is certainly present here. He at
tacks organized religion, saying that
Christians are "too busy condemning
themselves and others, or preaching at
people, or worse, still killing for Christ.
None of them understanding, or trying in
the least, to behave like a Christ." He also
attacks social stuffiness. He speaks of
Martha's Vineyard, for example, as
"Martha's Graveyard, home of the Quack
ers, a slightly balmy group, known only by
a loud moaning on Easter Sunday." And
even his old favorite, the British royalty,
receives scrutiny. He recalls seeing a
"photograph of a princess going down on
a racehorse. ... I remembered her proud

royal buttocks, once the private stock of
English society, but no longer. ... All we
need now is a picture of the Pope in drag
and the world is ours." And finally, he
pokes fun at himself, here playing off the
lyrics of "Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds"
— "I pictured myself on a boat in a river
with tangerine trees and nervous
dysplasia."
There are glimpses into Lennon's
metaphysics that invite comparison, in
the quality of their language, to his late
1960s track "Across the Universe" —
"Here, as 1 gaze ideas into your spiritual
unit, I find the strong indigo color vibrat
ing most strongly. You have traveled
throughout all the continents of your uni-
verse, you have entered the solar
systems In vast creativity in
search of a greater wisdom that is
not without but within Itself and
found Its identity in the
supremacy of all energies."
We also see Lennon the celebrity
and the awful ambivalence of that
status. One night he returns to
his apartment to find that some
well-wishers had left some
packages for him at the front
desk. "I, of course, immediately
threw the parcels out of mind
completely. I have enough of my
own garbage, never mind dealing
with other people's. But still they
meant well; or did they?" This
questioning reminds us that Len
non had come to New York, after
all. to escape the public eye; com
ing across a suggestion of a slight
paranoia sends a chill of memory
— history having made his
worries justified, and thus all the
more unsettling to read In
retrospect.
Some of the humor in this col

lection Is wonderfully Jarring.
"Out of the corner of his third
eye." Lennon writes of one of his
fictional characters, "he could see
the Mediterranean. It was filled
with water. Laughing children
dipped their parents' personal
belongings, wllly-nllly. in the
briny froth. An air of abodlng
hung heavy round his lunch. An
attractive blond In a four-piece
swlmsult was drowning a little
further down the coast; but his
mind was on the job. 'This would
be a holiday if I wasn't working.'
he told himself."
And other times this silliness
modulates effectively, if abruptly,
to seriousness. A particular farci
cal tale. "It Nearly Happened in
Rome," which recounts a couple's
trip to Italy, ends with this histori
cal commentary: "The world stage
was soon to reopen with a revival
of World War I. It was to be known
as World War 11. . . . The collapse
of a drink-sodden nun was to set
fire to a new German spirit called,
. . ..in English, Hitler."
But for all of these passages
where there Is a lucidity amid the
nonsense, many others do not
move beyond the trivial — "My

You were wearing me out, but I've

Lennon writes his own style of
stream of consciousness, a style
that Is lettered with run-on
phrases, as an extended word

Skywriting By Word of Mouth
By John Lennon
New York: Harper and Row
200 pages
During the 19605, when the Beatles
were creating a new beat in the music
world and moving a generation with the
sound of their singing, John Lennon
managed to find the time to turn his voice
onto several other stages — most notably
those of politics and the international
peace movement. But he also quietly es
tablished himself as a writer not only of
lyrics, but also of prose and verse. He pub
lished two collections of his written
pieces, "In His Own Write" and "A
Spaniard in the Works."

And now we have "Skywriting by Word
of Mouth," a series of pictoral and
autobiographical vignettes and drawings,
most unrelated, that Lennon drafted
sometime between 1975 and 1980, when
he pulled himself away from the public
world and channeled most of his energy
into his family life. But this period we
know was productive artistically as well —
not only do we have this new book, but
also the album "Double Fantasy," released
in 1980, that showed a tempered
maturity to Lennon's music: the perman
ent romantic promise of "Just Like Start
ing Over," and the witty self-portrait of
"Watching the Wheels."
Considering Lennon after all these
years — six, in fact, since that bitter De
cember when Mark David Chapman

crawled out of an alleyway in New York
City and fired the bullets that taught
many people my age the old ritual of col
lective mourning — one is called into the
unevenness of this late work. Moments of
clarity and sensitivity play alongside of
gibberish and careless sexual innuendo,
and the humor is often off-color. One can
not possibly know what Lennon himself
might have edited out.
For the book has a rough unfinished
quality, much like the album "Milk and
Honey," a final group of songs, which
Yoko Ono, the musician's widow, released
in 1983. Indeed, one difficulty in dealing
with any new work of Lennon's is discern
ing what is solely his, and what has
Yoko's fingerprints. None of his work will
ever again come directly to us.

That said, one still feels this book is es
sentially John's. The brash, caustic wit
he revealed in press conferences and in
terviews is certainly present here. He at
tacks organized religion, saying that
Christians are "too busy condemning
themselves and others, or preaching at
people, or worse, still killing for Christ.
None of them understanding, or trying in
the least, to behave like a Christ." He also
attacks social stuffiness. He speaks of
Martha's Vineyard, for example, as
"Martha's Graveyard, home of the Quack
ers, a slightly balmy group, known only by
a loud moaning on Easter Sunday." And
even his old favorite, the British royalty,
receives scrutiny. He recalls seeing a
"photograph of a princess going down on
a racehorse. ... I remembered her proud

royal buttocks, once the private stock of
English society, but no longer. ... All we
need now is a picture of the Pope in drag
and the world is ours." And finally, he
pokes fun at himself, here playing off the
lyrics of "Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds"
— "I pictured myself on a boat in a river
with tangerine trees and nervous
dysplasia."
There are glimpses into Lennon's
metaphysics that invite comparison, in
the quality of their language, to his late
1960s track "Across the Universe" —
"Here, as 1 gaze ideas into your spiritual
unit, I find the strong indigo color vibrat
ing most strongly. You have traveled
throughout all the continents of your uni-
verse, you have entered the solar
systems In vast creativity in
search of a greater wisdom that is
not without but within Itself and
found Its identity in the
supremacy of all energies."
We also see Lennon the celebrity
and the awful ambivalence of that
status. One night he returns to
his apartment to find that some
well-wishers had left some
packages for him at the front
desk. "I, of course, immediately
threw the parcels out of mind
completely. I have enough of my
own garbage, never mind dealing
with other people's. But still they
meant well; or did they?" This
questioning reminds us that Len
non had come to New York, after
all. to escape the public eye; com
ing across a suggestion of a slight
paranoia sends a chill of memory
— history having made his
worries justified, and thus all the
more unsettling to read In
retrospect.
Some of the humor in this col

lection Is wonderfully Jarring.
"Out of the corner of his third
eye." Lennon writes of one of his
fictional characters, "he could see
the Mediterranean. It was filled
with water. Laughing children
dipped their parents' personal
belongings, wllly-nllly. in the
briny froth. An air of abodlng

And other times this silliness

to seriousness. A particular farci

was soon to reopen with a revival
of World War I. It was to be known
as World War 11. . . . The collapse
of a drink-sodden nun was to set
fire to a new German spirit called,

But for all of these passages
where there Is a lucidity amid the

Skywriting By Word of Mouth
By John Lennon
New York: Harper and Row
200 pages
During the 19605, when the Beatles
were creating a new beat in the music
world and moving a generation with the
sound of their singing, John Lennon
managed to find the time to turn his voice
onto several other stages — most notably
those of politics and the international
peace movement. But he also quietly es
tablished himself as a writer not only of
lyrics, but also of prose and verse. He pub
lished two collections of his written
pieces, "In His Own Write" and "A
Spaniard in the Works."

And now we have "Skywriting by Word
of Mouth," a series of pictoral and
autobiographical vignettes and drawings,
most unrelated, that Lennon drafted
sometime between 1975 and 1980, when
he pulled himself away from the public
world and channeled most of his energy
into his family life. But this period we
know was productive artistically as well —
not only do we have this new book, but
also the album "Double Fantasy," released
in 1980, that showed a tempered
maturity to Lennon's music: the perman
ent romantic promise of "Just Like Start
ing Over," and the witty self-portrait of
"Watching the Wheels."
Considering Lennon after all these
years — six, in fact, since that bitter De
cember when Mark David Chapman

crawled out of an alleyway in New York
City and fired the bullets that taught
many people my age the old ritual of col
lective mourning — one is called into the
unevenness of this late work. Moments of
clarity and sensitivity play alongside of
gibberish and careless sexual innuendo,
and the humor is often off-color. One can
not possibly know what Lennon himself
might have edited out.
For the book has a rough unfinished
quality, much like the album "Milk and
Honey," a final group of songs, which
Yoko Ono, the musician's widow, released
in 1983. Indeed, one difficulty in dealing
with any new work of Lennon's is discern
ing what is solely his, and what has
Yoko's fingerprints. None of his work will
ever again come directly to us.

That said, one still feels this book is es
sentially John's. The brash, caustic wit
he revealed in press conferences and in
terviews is certainly present here. He at
tacks organized religion, saying that
Christians are "too busy condemning
themselves and others, or preaching at
people, or worse, still killing for Christ.
None of them understanding, or trying in
the least, to behave like a Christ." He also
attacks social stuffiness. He speaks of
Martha's Vineyard, for example, as
"Martha's Graveyard, home of the Quack
ers, a slightly balmy group, known only by
a loud moaning on Easter Sunday." And
even his old favorite, the British royalty,
receives scrutiny. He recalls seeing a
"photograph of a princess going down on
a racehorse. ... I remembered her proud

royal buttocks, once the private stock of
English society, but no longer. ... All we
need now is a picture of the Pope in drag
and the world is ours." And finally, he
pokes fun at himself, here playing off the
lyrics of "Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds"
— "I pictured myself on a boat in a river
with tangerine trees and nervous
dysplasia."
There are glimpses into Lennon's
metaphysics that invite comparison, in
the quality of their language, to his late
1960s track "Across the Universe" —
"Here, as 1 gaze ideas into your spiritual
unit, I find the strong indigo color vibrat
ing most strongly. You have traveled
throughout all the continents of your uni-
verse, you have entered the solar
systems In vast creativity in
search of a greater wisdom that is
not without but within Itself and
found Its identity in the
supremacy of all energies."
We also see Lennon the celebrity
and the awful ambivalence of that
status. One night he returns to
his apartment to find that some
well-wishers had left some
packages for him at the front
desk. "I, of course, immediately
threw the parcels out of mind
completely. I have enough of my
own garbage, never mind dealing
with other people's. But still they
meant well; or did they?" This
questioning reminds us that Len
non had come to New York, after
all. to escape the public eye; com
ing across a suggestion of a slight
paranoia sends a chill of memory
— history having made his
worries justified, and thus all the
more unsettling to read In
retrospect.
Some of the humor in this col

lection Is wonderfully Jarring.
"Out of the corner of his third
eye." Lennon writes of one of his
fictional characters, "he could see
the Mediterranean. It was filled
with water. Laughing children
dipped their parents' personal
belongings, wllly-nllly. in the
briny froth. An air of abodlng
hung heavy round his lunch. An
attractive blond In a four-piece
swlmsult was drowning a little
further down the coast; but his
mind was on the job. 'This would
be a holiday if I wasn't working.'
he told himself."
And other times this silliness
modulates effectively, if abruptly,
to seriousness. A particular farci
cal tale. "It Nearly Happened in
Rome," which recounts a couple's
trip to Italy, ends with this histori
cal commentary: "The world stage
was soon to reopen with a revival
of World War I. It was to be known
as World War 11. . . . The collapse
of a drink-sodden nun was to set
fire to a new German spirit called,
. . ..in English, Hitler."
But for all of these passages
where there Is a lucidity amid the
nonsense, many others do not
move beyond the trivial — "My

You were wearing me out, but I've
lost a few pounds of flesh fruit is

mind you, I couldn't swear to wit
to woo to each his own back yard
stick."
Lennon writes his own style of
stream of consciousness, a style
that Is lettered with run-on
phrases, as an extended word
game: "bluegrass mountain

curried beef and rice. . .
Though the language is inventive
and is amusing to read aloud, it
becomes rather tedious when it
continues for several pages.
One of the nice touches to this
book is the pen drawings that are
scattered throughout it. These
drawings are more independent
works than illustrations of the
text, though many of them are
drawn in the same spirit of witti
ness with which the book is writ-

Perhaps the most memorable
drawing, and one that is truly
edifying, is a self-portrait of the
musician seated at a piano. His
hands are busy at the keyboard
and tiny musical notes sing from
the soundboard. Lennon pasted a
big smile on his face, and we too,
even after all the tragedy, cannot
help but smile with him. recalling
the joy with which his music lit
the world.

is appropriate. I think, for John

himself weakness and Insistence
to go his own way creatively made
him remarkably accessible as an
artist and as a man. He is much
missed.
