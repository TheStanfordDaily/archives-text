## McDowell, Paulsen pace Card win 
### TOM SENF Editorial staff 
A win against a Division II team, even one as good
as San Francisco State, is not anything for the No. 4
team in the nation to get really excited about, but in
Stanford's 13-6 triumph yesterday over the Gators,
there were two developments that bode very well for
the Cardinal's prospects this season.
First, pitcher Jack McDowell made his 1987 debut
a successful one, hurling three shutout innings to
record the win. Showing no effects of the shoulder
problems that kept him inactive during the summer
and fall, McDowell allowed only a bad-hop single to
the first hitter he faced.
Second, shortstop Troy Paulsen became the
second member of Stanford's highly-touted fresh
man class (along with outfielder Paul Carey) to show
the capability of contributing right away by going 4-
for-5 with six RBIs to pace the Cardinal's 11 -hit at
tack.
Throwing mostly lastballs with a few sliders mixed
in, McDowell had no trouble popping catcher Doug
Robbins' glove or finding the strike zone. "We're very
pleased," Stantord Coach Mark Marquess said. "His
velocity was good. He wasn't real good with his loca
tion, although he was throwing strikes. He was up a
little more than he usually is, but he hasn't pitched
in six or seven months."
Not surprisingly, McDowell did not enjoy the wait.
"It ate me up all fall," he said. "And watching us play
and not being able to help out, that was hard. But if
we had been losing, it would have been harder."
The junior right-hander was more relieved than

overjoyed by his 28-pitch performance. "It was great
to be out there, basically," he said. "I wasn't throw
ing as hard as I can, and I wasn't as crisp on my
pitches. I'm not really in pitching shape yet."
With two on and two out in the bottom of the
second, Paulsen put Stanford ahead to stay with a
two-run double off the left field fence. There were also
men in scoring position in each of Paulsen's other
four at-bats, and he drove one in each time, with RBI
singles in the fourth, sixth and eighth innings and a
groundout in the seventh.
"I felt real comfortable in the batters' box." Paulsen
said. "With runners on base, I was pretty much sit
ting on the fastball because I knew they didn't want
to put another runner on with the top of the lineup
coming up." Paulsen hit ninth yesterday.
Paulsen has seven hits in his 12 at-bats for a .583
average. He is tied for second with Ed Sprague
(behind Carey) for the team lead in RBIs with eight.
He would seem to have the inside track to the start
ing shortstop job, but senior David Esquer showed
he is still a viable candidate by coming off the bench
in the designated hitter spot to go 2-for-2 with two
runs scored and two RBIs.
That makes eight runs driven in by the two
shortstops. "Not bad, huh?" Marquess said. "Too
bad we can't play two of them."
Stanford appeared to be cruising with a 5-0 lead
after four innings before three unearned runs helped
get the Gators to within one. But Paulsen's single in
the sixth put the Cardinal up by two, and then Stan
ford broke it open with a five-run seventh. The rally
was keyed by two-run singles by Esquer and Ron Wit
meyer.

Stanford catcher Doug Robbins was 0-2 yesterday, but he did manage to score twice, once after being
walked and again after being hit by a pitch. Overall, the Cardinal managed 11 hits on the day, all of them
singles — a feat which sent five San Francisco State pitchers to the showers.

"I felt real comfortable in the batters' box." Paulsen
said. "With runners on base, I was pretty much sit
ting on the fastball because I knew they didn't want
to put another runner on with the top of the lineup
coming up." Paulsen hit ninth yesterday.
Paulsen has seven hits in his 12 at-bats for a .583
average. He is tied for second with Ed Sprague
(behind Carey) for the team lead in RBIs with eight.
He would seem to have the inside track to the start
ing shortstop job, but senior David Esquer showed
he is still a viable candidate by coming off the bench
in the designated hitter spot to go 2-for-2 with two
runs scored and two RBIs.
That makes eight runs driven in by the two
shortstops. "Not bad, huh?" Marquess said. "Too
bad we can't play two of them."
Stanford appeared to be cruising with a 5-0 lead
after four innings before three unearned runs helped
get the Gators to within one. But Paulsen's single in
the sixth put the Cardinal up by two, and then Stan
ford broke it open with a five-run seventh. The rally
was keyed by two-run singles by Esquer and Ron Wit
meyer.

Stanford catcher Doug Robbins was 0-2 yesterday, but he did manage to score twice, once after being
walked and again after being hit by a pitch. Overall, the Cardinal managed 11 hits on the day, all of them
singles — a feat which sent five San Francisco State pitchers to the showers.
