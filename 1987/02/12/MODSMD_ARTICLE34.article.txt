# Volleyball beats the Rainbows in 3 sets
## 
### ALICIA KENT Staff writer 
The Stanford men's volleyball
team knew what it had to do last
night: Repeat Monday's domin
ance over Hawaii. With a shutout
match of 15-6, 15-11, 15-5 last
night at Maples Pavilion, the
Cardinal met its challenge and
destroyed its opponents.
Monday's shutout victory, 18-
16. 15-9, 15-7, over No. 9 Hawaii,
combined with last night's win,
put Stanford's overall record at
12-4 and 3-1 in the Western Inter
collegiate Volleyball Association.
Its one conference loss was to UC-
Santa Barbara, who Stanford will
face again this season on April 18.
Last night's match was a simple
case of the more experienced team
dominating the less powerful
team. The Cardinal outplayed the
Rainbows, as it did in Monday's
match.
"This match was a case of us
beating Hawaii pretty soundly on
Monday and having to do the
same thing tonight. They were
forced to go back to the drawing
board, change their serving order,
put their strongest hitters against
our weakest. But we kind of an
ticipated that," Stanford Asst.
Coach Rubin Nieves said after yes
terday's match.
"We served well and passed well.
They tried different things, but
our passing held up against some
pretty aggressive serving." Nieves
said. Hawaii served for four aces
to Stanford's two, although the
Rainbows began the match with a
service error and made 15 service
errors during the contest.
The first game began with the
Rainbows reaching the score
board first, scoring three points
before the Cardinal was able to
catch up. But with Stephen Blue
and Scott Fortune hitting, and
Robert Peterson blocking for five
assists, Stanford was able to tie
the Rainbows at three and from
there never looked back.
Last night, team unity was the
Cardinal's strength. "We played
really smoothly, both in offense
and defense," Fortune said. No
longer do the spikers feel like the
inexperienced newcomers. Ac
cording to Nieves, the team is out
of that state, and ready to face No.
1 UCLA, No. 8 Long Beach State
and No. 3 USC next week.
