# Card goes north for two weekend games

### SUSAN SLUSSER Editorial staff 
After a short two-game homes
tand, the Stanford men's bas
ketball team heads back on the
road, facing Washington State
tonight (7:30 p.m., KCBS 740
AM, KZSU 90.1 FM) and Wash
ington Saturday.
The road has not been kind to
the Cardinal this season; in five
straight away contests Stanford
recently finished 1-4, and the
team is just 2-7 overall on oppo
nents' courts. The Cardinal is 6-
7 in the Pacific 10 Conference,
alone in seventh place, three
and-a-half games behind league
leaders Oregon State and UCLA.
Stanford is 12-10 overall.
Washington State, despite in
habiting the ninth place spot in
the Pac-10 standings with a 3-9
record (7-14 overall), has proven
that it can compete with the
best. The Cougars not only
defeated UCLA at home earlier
this year, but also played the
first-place Bruins (who defeated
Stanford 93-62 last week) close
at Pauley Pavilion before losing
61-60.
"They're actually a reasonably
talented basketball team that
has some trouble sustaining
and winning,'' Stanford Coach
Mike Montgomery said. "They
played UCLA to a one-pointer
and did a real nice job there. "
Washington State is "a bas
ketball team that matches up
fairly well against us. We feel
that if we go in and compete and
play well, we have a chance to
win," Montgomery said.
The last time the two teams
faced each other, on Jan. 10,
Stanford did win. and by quite a

If Todd Lichti can average 17.5 points per game for the rest of
the season, he will become the first Stanford player to tally
1,000 career points as a sophomore. Lichti is averaging 17.2
points per game this season — the same as he did last year.
bit, 93-76. High scorer for Stan
ford was Eric Reveno. who totalled
a career-high 19 points, followed
closely by Howard Wright, who
had 18 points and 12 rebounds.
Washington State forward Joe
Wallace led all scorers with 24
points, shooting 9-of-12 from the
field and 5-of-7 from the free
throw line, in the first match-up
between the teams. The 6-foot-7
senior also added eight rebounds
In just 25 minutes of play before
fouling out. Wallace is currently
second In scoring for the Cougars
at 15.4 points per game.
"They're a pretty good team."
Stanford point guard Terry Taylor
said. "It was just In that game
(Stanford's win over WSU) we got
Wallace in some foul trouble. He's
a major scoring threat when he's
in the game. . . . Wallace can hurt
you by himself with his one-on
one talent."
Brian Quinnett, a 6-8 junior for
ward, leads the Cougar squad
with 16.0 points per game. 6-9
forward Dwayne Scholten, who
scored 17 points and pulled down
10 boards against Stanford earlier
this year, is averaging 12.2 points
and a team-high 9.0 rebounds per
game. Other starters for Washing

ton State Include sophomore
guards Brian Wright (8.4 points
per game) and Anthony Kidd (2.4
points per game).
"Washington State has better
talent than probably people give
them credit for," Montgomery
said. "Wallace is an excellent
outside shooter, and Quinnett is a
very fine basketball player. They
have quickness at the guards —
though I think if you talk with
(Washington State Coach) Len
Stevens, he'd probably say their
guards are their weak point; they
don't shoot the ball very well. But
they are 6-3, 6-4 and good athletes
— they can put on some pressure
on defense.
"They're very big inside,"
Montgomery continued.
"Scholton is 6-9 with long, long
arms and they have two seven
footers on the bench they come in
with."
Stanford is coming off a win,
after defeating USC 72-57 Sun
day, while the Cougars are coming
off a Tuesday night 62-60 loss at
Southwest Louisiana. WSU's 86-
80 win over rival Washington at
home Sunday snapped a nine
game losing streak. Washington
State is 5-3 at home on the year
and 3-2 in conference play.

Scholten has been shooting 62 per
cent from the floor — a mark that
would break the school record if he
keeps up his current pace.

Stanford point guard Terry Taylor
said. "It was just In that game
(Stanford's win over WSU) we got
Wallace in some foul trouble. He's
a major scoring threat when he's
in the game. . . . Wallace can hurt
you by himself with his one-on
one talent."
Brian Quinnett, a 6-8 junior for
ward, leads the Cougar squad
with 16.0 points per game. 6-9
forward Dwayne Scholten, who
scored 17 points and pulled down
10 boards against Stanford earlier
this year, is averaging 12.2 points
and a team-high 9.0 rebounds per
game. Other starters for Washing

ton State Include sophomore
guards Brian Wright (8.4 points
per game) and Anthony Kidd (2.4
points per game).
"Washington State has better
talent than probably people give
them credit for," Montgomery
said. "Wallace is an excellent
outside shooter, and Quinnett is a
very fine basketball player. They
have quickness at the guards —
though I think if you talk with
(Washington State Coach) Len
Stevens, he'd probably say their
guards are their weak point; they
don't shoot the ball very well. But
they are 6-3, 6-4 and good athletes
— they can put on some pressure
on defense.
"They're very big inside,"
Montgomery continued.
"Scholton is 6-9 with long, long
arms and they have two seven
footers on the bench they come in
with."
Stanford is coming off a win,
after defeating USC 72-57 Sun

off a Tuesday night 62-60 loss at
Southwest Louisiana. WSU's 86-
80 win over rival Washington at
home Sunday snapped a nine
game losing streak. Washington
State is 5-3 at home on the year
and 3-2 in conference play.
