### SUSAN SLUSSER Editorial staff 
After a short two-game homes
tand, the Stanford men's bas
ketball team heads back on the
road, facing Washington State
tonight (7:30 p.m., KCBS 740
AM, KZSU 90.1 FM) and Wash
ington Saturday.
The road has not been kind to
the Cardinal this season; in five
straight away contests Stanford
recently finished 1-4, and the
team is just 2-7 overall on oppo
nents' courts. The Cardinal is 6-
7 in the Pacific 10 Conference,
alone in seventh place, three
and-a-half games behind league
leaders Oregon State and UCLA.
Stanford is 12-10 overall.
Washington State, despite in
habiting the ninth place spot in
the Pac-10 standings with a 3-9
record (7-14 overall), has proven
that it can compete with the
best. The Cougars not only
defeated UCLA at home earlier
this year, but also played the
first-place Bruins (who defeated
Stanford 93-62 last week) close
at Pauley Pavilion before losing
61-60.
"They're actually a reasonably
talented basketball team that
has some trouble sustaining
and winning,'' Stanford Coach
Mike Montgomery said. "They
played UCLA to a one-pointer
and did a real nice job there. "
Washington State is "a bas
ketball team that matches up
fairly well against us. We feel
that if we go in and compete and
play well, we have a chance to
win," Montgomery said.
The last time the two teams
faced each other, on Jan. 10,
Stanford did win. and by quite a

If Todd Lichti can average 17.5 points per game for the rest of
the season, he will become the first Stanford player to tally
1,000 career points as a sophomore. Lichti is averaging 17.2
points per game this season â€” the same as he did last year.
