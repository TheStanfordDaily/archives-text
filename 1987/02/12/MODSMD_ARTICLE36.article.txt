# It's now official; top recruits sign
## 
### SCOTT ROTH Staff writer 
The 1987 version of the col
legiate football recruiting derby
came to an end yesterday, and by
all accounts, the Cardinal came
out smelling like a rose. After
more than a year's work, Stanford
Coach Jack Elway and his staff
were able to sit back and wait as
27 highly touted recruits
autographed national letters of in
tent to attend Stanford.
"We couldn't be happier," Elway
said. "We're very pleased with our
talent. They're all bright, intelli
gent young men and tremendous
athletes," he added.
It seems that the Cardinal staff
went in search of speed this year.
Of the 27 recruits, 19 are either of
fensive or defensive backs. Ac
cording to recruiting coordinator
Dick James, Stanford football
fans can expect to see a lot of
quick players in the coming
seasons.
"We recruited many young men
who have tremendous athletic
ability. 1 think you'll see speed on
our team like you haven't seen in
years," James said.
Elway echoed James' senti
ments. "We have brought in many
fine athletes with just fantasic
speed," Elway said.
Topping the list of recruits is
Jason Palumbis. a 6-foot-3 205-
pound quarterback from Lake Os
wego, Ore. Palumbis. who verbally
commited to the Farm some weeks
ago. comes in with an impressive
list of achievements to his name.
Among his accomplishments, he
was voted a Parade Ail-American
and a first team Best-in-the-West
selection after tossing for 4,000
yards and 42 touchdowns in two
years.
Another name to watch for is
Cory Booker, a 6-foot-4, 220-
pound wide receiver who will enter
Stanford as a USA Today first

team Ail-American. Booker Is said
to be one of the best recruits of
this class.
The Cardinal also bagged John
Hopkins, a plaeekicker, who
strangely enough attends the
same high school ks did place
kicker David Sweeney. Hopkins
could provide much-needed relief
on special teams; he was 9-of-12
on field goals last season, with his
longest coming from 52 yards out.
On the defensive side of the ball,
the Cardinal went hunting for
linemen and defensive backs. El
way said he was slightly disap
pointed with the small number of
defensive linemen who chose
Stanford..
"We needed'a few more defen
sive linemen, but with the quality
were getting, we'll be just fine," El
way said.
Among the best defensive backs
to sign is Blaik Nichols of nearby
Alameda. Many recruiting service
predict that Nichols, who weighs
in at 225 pounds, will be a great
cornerback. Tom Lemmings of
Prep Football Report said in the
Times-Tribune yesterday that Nic
hols "has exceptional skills and is
always around the ball. He'll
knock your head off."
Although tired, Elway was still
able to smile and predict a trip to
Pasadena next year. Though
coaches are usually optimistic. El
way's prognostications may be
right on the money. Many recruit
ing services are saying thai the
Cardinal pulled in one of the best
classes nationwide.
James, too, was happy, but
places little faith in ranking
recruiting classes.
"I'd like to stay in the top 25
(classes) each year and steal some
players from the Washingtons and
the Oklahomas like we did this
year. However, the true measure
of a team is not their high school
statistics, but how they play in
three or four years."

on field goals last season, with his
longest coming from 52 yards out.
On the defensive side of the ball,
the Cardinal went hunting for
linemen and defensive backs. El
way said he was slightly disap
pointed with the small number of
defensive linemen who chose
Stanford..
"We needed'a few more defen
sive linemen, but with the quality
were getting, we'll be just fine," El
way said.
Among the best defensive backs
to sign is Blaik Nichols of nearby
Alameda. Many recruiting service
predict that Nichols, who weighs
in at 225 pounds, will be a great
cornerback. Tom Lemmings of
Prep Football Report said in the
Times-Tribune yesterday that Nic
hols "has exceptional skills and is
always around the ball. He'll
knock your head off."
Although tired, Elway was still
able to smile and predict a trip to
Pasadena next year. Though
coaches are usually optimistic. El
way's prognostications may be
right on the money. Many recruit
ing services are saying thai the
Cardinal pulled in one of the best
classes nationwide.
James, too, was happy, but
places little faith in ranking
recruiting classes.
"I'd like to stay in the top 25
(classes) each year and steal some
players from the Washingtons and
the Oklahomas like we did this
year. However, the true measure
of a team is not their high school
statistics, but how they play in
three or four years."
