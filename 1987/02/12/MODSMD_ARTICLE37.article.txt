# Two captains lead gymnastics
## Different personalities together become ideal pair 
### EVAN TUCHINSKY Staff writer 
German political philosophy may
seem quite distant from collegiate ath
letics, but the captains of the Stanford
women's gymnastics team clearly em
body Hegel's concept of dialectic. Sopho
more Cheryl Doo and junior Alison
McGann are two very distinctive individ
uals, but in the gym they combine effec
tively to guide their teammates to suc
cess.
"They both seem to take on different
characteristics," Stanford Asst. Coach
Gary Smith said. "Cheryl is more ener
getic and more vociferous. Alison is
more laid back, quieter, more conserva
tive in her comments. Both aspects are
beneficial."
Stanford Coach Homer Sardina
agreed. "Cheryl will instigate things.
She'll say. 'Come on over to my house
and I'll make dinner.'
"Alison is a stabilizing force." Sardina
continued. "She's not usually way up or
way down emotionally. She's very
collected. Cheryl stimulates; Alison
soothes."
McGann came to Stanford from Foun
tain Valley. Calif., after competing for

Scats Gym alongside teammate Cindy
Boyd. During that time, she competed
nationally, and was California State
Champion on uneven bars and balance
beam.
After her freshman season, she was
elected the team's Most Valuable Fresh
man and co-captain for 1986. but 1987
seems to be her year. "It's a different Ali
this year." Doo said. "She's happier and
more confident.
"In her sophomore year, she was in a
rut." Doo continued. "Everyone goes
through a transition year in gymnastics.
Sophomore year was the transition for
her. She's made vast improvements in
gymnastics, and her all-around and in
dividual event scores have gone up from
last year."
"Alison came into the program think
ing she was at her maximum level of
gymnastics efficiency and didn't think
she could overcome the difficulties of
collegiate competition, but lo and be
hold. she has." Sardina said. "I can fore
see her scoring 9.3 on each event. She
was scoring 35 (all-around) and now is
approaching 37."
Doo is another example of success
through hard work. The sophomore is a
native of Hawaii, not a noted breeding

ground for gymnasts. "Hawaii doesn't
have an extensive gymnastics program
and doesn't have very good facilities."
she said, recalling the days when she
spent a half hour before and after
practice with her teammates setting up
and taking down all the equipment.
"1 started gymnastics sort of late." Doo
said. "I've only been in the sport for
about ten years." In that time she was
Class I State runner-up in 1983 and
Hawaii champion in 1984 and 1985.
"Coming to Stanford. I didn't know
what to expect." she said. "In Hawaii you
know all the girls you compete against
and all of the judges. Here it is com
pletely different."
She has apparently made the adjust
ment well. Though she walked onto the
team as a freshman, she earned a schol
arship for this year. She was awarded
the Most Consistent Athlete by the team
for 1986 and elected co-captain for
1987.
"Cheryl is a competitor." Sardina said.
"When she goes out on the competition
floor, a light goes on. .She knows her
physical limitations and goes within
them."

Sophomore Cheryl Doo's boisterous leadership has been a key to the success of the
women's gymnastics team this season.
"Cheryl is a very hard worker,
and it shows in her performance,"
McGann said. "She is always one
of the last people to leave the gym.
Even if it's time to end practice,
she won't leave the gym until she
is satisfied with what she has
been doing.
"She's a very consistent per
former and you can always count
on her in (the) clutch," McGann
added. "The thing I was impressed
with was that she was having
trouble with her release move in
practice, but she caught it in the
meet (at California)."
Clearly, the Stanford team has
two fine role models. "I think they
were good choices (for team cap
tains)," Smith said. "They set a
really good example for the rest Of

the team. The girls look up and
respect them, which is actually
more important than anything
they do."
"We look up to those two be
cause they set a good example,"
sophomore Bayer noted. "Both are
good communicators with
Homer."
"They both raise our morale and
keep our spirits high," said Boyd,
a senior and captain in 1985. "I
think the two complement each
other. Cheryl is vivacious,
whereas Alison is enthusiastic
and encouraging."
"One of the reasons we elected
Alison was because she was a cap
tain last year and did a good job,"
Bayer added. As for Doo, "Cheryl
has a great attitude. She's a good
person to talk to. If you have a
problem, she'll set you straight."
On the roles of the captains,
both Doo and McGann feel that

their duties are the same. "I am a
little more vocal than Alison, but
we basically do the same thing,"
the sophomore said. "We have the
same roles, including communi
cation between the gymnasts and
coaches and making sure every
one feels wanted."
McGann agreed. "Our role as
captains is to keep the team
chemistry positive and keep the
team together in the meet. We
have our own personal styles, but
we basically handle it the same
way."
"These two people, Alison and
Cheryl, epitomize leadership,
team spirit, team involvement and
striving to be the best that they
can be," Sardina declared. "Brad
Muster said it best: Individual
awards truly only happen if the
team is behind you. Because we
have positive leaders, our environ
ment is positive."
