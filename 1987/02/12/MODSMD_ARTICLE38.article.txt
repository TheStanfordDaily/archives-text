# Women look for victory at home
## 
### PABLO MORALES Staff writer 
Stanford coach Tara VanDer
veer can empathize with the plight
of Kookabura 111 â€” and not just
because she happens to be an avid
sailor.
Like Australia's ill-fated entry in
the recently concluded America's
Cup race, the Stanford women's
basketball team started the 1986-
87 season quite briskly, but lately
has had a little wind taken out of
its sails.
After posting a 5-2 record in the
competitive Pacific 10 Conference,
the Cardinal has since lost four
straight games. The latest, a 64-
49 defeat to UCLA last Saturday,
was also the fourth consecutive
setback against a conference rival.
"We've played very strong at
home," VanDerveer said after Sat
urday's game. "Our last four
games have been road games, and
very tough road games. It's
sometimes hard to see progress
playing in this kind of situation.
We just need a second wind."
Tonight at Maples Pavilion,
Stanford may get the wind it
needs as it continues its Pac-10
season against the 8-12 Washing
ton State Huskies, a team that has

yet to defeat a conference op
ponent.
The rough waters of the Pac-10,
the third or fourth toughest con
ference In the nation, have
impeded Stanford's quest for any
post-season action.
After climbing up as high as
third place in the Pac-10. the
Cardinal now occupies sixth
place, two games behind UCLA
and Oregon State, which share
fourth place. Probably, Stanford
would need at least a third-place
finish to insure an NCAA tourna
ment bid.
Despite the recent skid, the
Cardinal remains optimistic.
"We've always had the goal of
making the tournament, and we
still do," senior forward Sue
Sebolt said. "This week is the
hardest we have worked all
season. We just need to come out
strong (against WSU) and concen
trate on trying hard for 40
minutes."
A lapse of concentration during
the second half of games has
plagued the relatively inexperi
enced Cardinal in each of the last
four losses.
"I think it's a combination of
physical fatigue and lack of confi

dence," VanDerveer said. "We
depend so much on young kids."
Freshman Katy Steding might
be considered a young kid by Van-
Derveer's standards, but so far
this year she's been playing like a
seasoned veteran for Stanford.
She leads the team in rebounding

and is scoring in double figures.
"There's not much more we can
ask of Katy. She's doing every
thing for us. She's the only one
who goes for the offensive boards,
and she takes the ball to the bas
ket. effectively. She needs more
support."

Through four straight losses, forward Katy Steding has continued to
shine. The freshman leads the team in rebounding.
