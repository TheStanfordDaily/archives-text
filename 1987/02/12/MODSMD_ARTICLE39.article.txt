# Card should beat injured Spartans
## 
### KEN STEVENS Editorial staff 
If the Stanford women's ten
nis team ever starts feeling
sorry for itself because two of
its key players are out with
stress-fracture injuries, all the
Cardinal has to do is look down
the road about 30 miles to see
that the situation could be
worse.
In their first two dual
matches of the season, the
Spartans of San Jose State had
to forfeit two singles matches
and one doubles match, be
cause the team consists of only
four players. SJSU will attempt
to perform a miracle today at
1:30 p.m. as it takes on the top
ranked Cardinal at the Varsity
Tennis Courts.
The predicament began for
first-year SJSU Coach Mary
Visser when Lisa Beritzhoff,
last year's coach, accepted a
coaching job at UC-Santa Bar
bara. Beritzhoff took Chandra
Thompson, last season's No. 3
singles performer, with her to
Santa Barbara.
In addition to losing
Thompson. Visser has had
eligibility problems with other

athletes and has been forced to
go with four players: Shelly
Stockman. Whitney Clarke.
Jeanne Pasley-Miller and Kris
ten Hlldebrand.
Even more unbelievable than
the size of the Spartan lineup is
the fact that SJSU has won its
first two dual matches, knock
ing off the University of San
Francisco and UC-Santa Cruz.
In fact, excluding the forfeits,
the Spartans won each individ
ual match in those two
matches.
Stanford has had lineup
troubles of its own. Senior
Leigh Anne Eldredge and soph
omore Eleni Rossides remain
hobbled with stress fractures.
Also, Patty Fendick. the team's
top player, will miss her second
straight dual match as she is in
Boca Raton, Fla., attempting to
qualify for the Virginia Slims
professional tournament there
next week.
Nevertheless, Stanford is 3-0
and should have no trouble up
ping that mark to 4-0 today.
The Cardinal's depth has been
proven in the first three
matches, as each of seven
singles performers has gone
undefeated.
