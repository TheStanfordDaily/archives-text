# Speaker: Israel won't cooperate

### MARK LAWRENCE Senior staff writer 
The Israeli government will not
allow the United States to investi
gate the role of Israeli officials in
arranging arms deals between the
United States and Iran, a senior
member of the Israeli parliament
said yesterday.
Speaking before about 50
people in Branner lounge yester
day, Ehud Ulmart said Israel
regards the controversial arms
sales as a "state-to-state matter"
and will not allow blame for the
transactions to fall on Isreali offi
cials, who. he said, acted on or
ders from the Israeli government.
Israel would see any request by
the United States to conduct such

a probe "an insult to the state of
Israel," said Ulmart, a member of
the right-of-center Likud Party
who has served in the Israeli parli
ament. the Knesset, for 13 years.
A close friend of Israeli Prime Min
ister Yitzhak Shamir, Ulmart
serves on the Knesset's Foreign
Relations and Defense Committee
and the Subcommittee on Intelli
gence.
Ulmart said that blame has fal
len on Israel because U.S. officials
involved in the arms deals refused
to give testimony â€” pleading the
Fifth Amendment in investiga
tions of the transactions. He said
Israel acted only as a middleman
after ending its own participation
