# Speaker: Israel won't cooperate
## 
### MARK LAWRENCE Senior staff writer 
The Israeli government will not
allow the United States to investi
gate the role of Israeli officials in
arranging arms deals between the
United States and Iran, a senior
member of the Israeli parliament
said yesterday.
Speaking before about 50
people in Branner lounge yester
day, Ehud Ulmart said Israel
regards the controversial arms
sales as a "state-to-state matter"
and will not allow blame for the
transactions to fall on Isreali offi
cials, who. he said, acted on or
ders from the Israeli government.
Israel would see any request by
the United States to conduct such

a probe "an insult to the state of
Israel," said Ulmart, a member of
the right-of-center Likud Party
who has served in the Israeli parli
ament. the Knesset, for 13 years.
A close friend of Israeli Prime Min
ister Yitzhak Shamir, Ulmart
serves on the Knesset's Foreign
Relations and Defense Committee
and the Subcommittee on Intelli
gence.
Ulmart said that blame has fal
len on Israel because U.S. officials
involved in the arms deals refused
to give testimony â€” pleading the
Fifth Amendment in investiga
tions of the transactions. He said
Israel acted only as a middleman
after ending its own participation

In a speech last night at Branner Hall, Israeli parliament member
Ehud Ulmart predicted that Israel will not allow a U.S. investigation of
its role in the Iranian arms transactions.
in the program to aid Iran.
Ulmart said he believes Marine
Lt. Col Oliver North, former dep
uty director for political-military
affairs for the National Security
Council, and Adm. John Poindex
ter, former national security advi

ser, deliberately turned attention
to Israel by their silence.
But, he said. President Reagan
and Congress realize that Israel
after January 1986 acted only as a
go-between In the transactions,
which contradicted a U.S. policy
against negotiating for the release
of hostages and possibly violated
U.S. law.
"I have heard rumors that Israel

and others convinced the United
States to do something it didn't
want to do," Ulmart said. "But I
don't know that any of the
Americans are on the level of Boy
Scouts either."
Ulmart said Israel played a key
role in developing contacts be
tween the United States and
Iranian "moderates" interested in
establishing ties with the West.
In April 1985, the Israeli govern

ment received a letter from the
"moderates," who were interested
in ending the war between Iran
and Iraq, he said. At about the
same time, a U.S. official traveled
to Israel to discuss the possibility
of establishing ties with Iran, said
Ulmart, who said he took part at
every stage of decision-making on
the arms deals.
Until the following January, Is
rael played an active role in the

arms sales, according to Ulmart.
He said that while the United
States was greatly interested in
making arms deals to help gain
the release of U.S. hostages held
by pro-Iranian terrorists in
Lebanon, Israel also had its own
motivations for assisting in the
transactions.
First, he said, Israel wanted to
help arm the Iranians against
Iraq, a traditional enemy of Israel

and a country that Israelis fear
could attack them if It were not oc
cupied with the six-year-old war
with Iran.
Second, Ulmart said, Israel, like
the United States, was interested
in making contacts with and
gaining the favor of a group of
Iranians that may assume power
when 80-year-old Iranian leader
Ayatullah Ruhollah Khomeini
dies.
