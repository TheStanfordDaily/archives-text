"We're just inching along."
Men's Golf Coach Tim Schaff said
after the first round of the John
Burns Invitational in Waikiki.
The Cardinal finds itself 20th
out of 24 teams after 18 holes of
thethree-day event. Stanford fired
a 298, led by freshman Mark Fun
seth's 73. Sophomore Brad Geer
and freshman Don Christensen
each finished at 74. Sophomores
Roger Moraglia and John Mahon
shot 77 and 80. respectively.
Schaff is encouraged by the
progress his young team has
made from the beginning of the
fall to this point In the winter
season.
"Everyone's improving. When
you watch the guys every day you
realize that it may not be start
lingly apparent yet. but it will be."
Schaff added.
The day. however, clearly
belonged to the UCLA team and
Mike Springer of the University of
Arizona.
The 12th-ranked Bruins tore up
the par-70 Olomana course to the

tune of 273 and a two-stroke lead
over 14th-ranked Arizona, while
Springer shot a blazing 63 to sieze
the individual lead by three
strokes over Fresno State's Ron
Ewing.
Four UCLA players broke par in
yesterday's opening round. Bob
Lasken, Kevin Leach and Rich
Greenwood came in at 68 to tie
them with John Hearn of the Uni
versity of the Pacific for third
place.
"Most of the teams that played
well had a really low score. We
didn't. The guys have been playing
well in practice and haven't bro
ken through with a low score.
We're only 10 shots out of the
pack," Schaff noted.
The Cardinal will have to con
centrate on avoiding disastrous
holes today and tomorrow if It
hopes to move up in the stand
ings.
"We really didn't play that badly.
We had 10 penalty shots, and it's
not that hard to avoid all that
(water and out of bounds). We hit
a few too many out of play and
nobody had the hot hand," Schaff
said.
