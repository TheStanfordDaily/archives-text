# Profs.: Skills aren't biological

What does biology have to say about sexual
difference?
Very little, according to two philosophy pro
fessors who spoke yesterday at the Law School.
Biology alone cannot explain why males are
better at mathematics or why females have su
perior verbal skills, said visiting Philosophy
Prof. Ruth Doell.
Social and cultural factors also influence
sex-differentiated behavior, Doell said. "Social
behaviors require social explanations."
Doell, along with Assoc. Philosophy Prof.
Helen Longino, spoke before about 60 people
as part of a lecture series on "Theoretical Per
spectives on Sexual Difference."
Longino argued against traditional views
that state that the brain's functions are split
between the right side, which performs non
verbal tasks, and the left side, which performs

verbal tasks.
Longino said people relied on this theory to
explain "sexual differences in Intelligence and
performance," such as women are better at
verbal tasks and men non-verbal tasks.
In turn, this provides a convenient answer
for why there are fewer women going Into ar
chitectural. engineering and science jobs. Lon
gino said.
Longino also said there is no conclusive bio
logical evidence that males have superior spa
tial skills.
A member of the audience challenged Lon
gino's theory, saying it "contradicts Scholastic
Aptitude Test (SAT) scores." He said the scores
show men have superior spatial skills.
Longino replied that the SAT seems to mea
sure other skills.
Doell said that "tomboyism" is also wrongly
held to be biologically determined.
She said social influences cause tomboy be
havior. "Tomboyism is a social phenomenon."

A member of the audience said sex
differentiated behavior, such as child-rearing,
is biologically, rather than socially, deter
mined.
"Why would the mother be interested in the
young" unless there is a biological basis such
as passing on the genes, he asked.
"There's a built-in biological pressure to
have the offspring survive," said another mem
ber of the audience.
Doell answered that although "biology gives
us the capacity to behave maternally," social
phenomena determine whether we behave
maternally.
"Like most complex human behavior, it
would turn out to be complexly determined by
the history of the individual."
The month-long series of lectures, spon
sored by the Institute for Research on Women
and Gender, includes a conference this
weekend covering anthropological, legal and
feminist approaches to sexual difference.
