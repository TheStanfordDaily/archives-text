# Center releases new arms control study
## 
### MARK LEMLEY 
The largest non-government study ever
conducted on arms control treaty compli
ance will be released this morning by a
Stanford arms control group, according to
Greg Dalton, a spokesman for Global Out
look.
Global Outlook, a working group of Stan
ford's Center for International Security and
Arms Control, will make the study public at
a press conference at the Brookings Institu
tion in Washington, D.C.
The U.S. Government's Arms Control and
Disarmament Agency is required by law to
release a report on U.S. and Soviet compli
ance with the treaties by Dec. 1 of each
year. The 1986 report has not yet been
released, although informed sources in the
government said it had been completed and
was being reviewed for accuracy by the Na
tional Security Council.
Dalton said the Stanford report is in
tended to provide the press, Congress and
the public with an alternative to the
forthcoming government report. Although
he would not disclose the report's contents,
Dalton said it "makes clear policy recom
mendations."
It is probable that the study's conclusions
will differ from those of the Reagan admin
istration on a variety of key issues.
The Stanford report covers four major
existing treaties ratified by both powers, as

well as three treaties that the United States
has never ratified but to which both sides
have agreed to adhere — SALT 11, the Peace
ful Nuclear Explosions Treaty and the
Threshold Test Ban Treaty.
Included in the survey of compliance is
the recently controversial Anti-Ballistic
Missile (ABM) Treaty of 1972. The Reagan
administration is currently contemplating
whether to "reinterpret" the ABM treaty to
allow the Defense Department to test com
ponents of the proposed Strategic Defense
Initiative (SDH
Soviet officials have argued that such a
loose interpretation would be "a clear viola
tion of the letter and intent" of the pact.
U.S. officials counter that the Soviets
have already violated the treaty. They claim
that a phased-array radar center at Kras
noyarsk in the Soviet Union could be used
to control a ballistic missile defense. The
agreement prohibits such radar systems.
Alleged Soviet violations of the SALT II
treaty will also be addressed in the Stanford
report. Administration officials claim the
Soviet SS-25 ICBM, now being deployed, vi
olates that agreement, which limits offen
sive weapons. The United States ceased
complying with the treaty in November.
The study is the culmination of 18
months of research by the group, which is
centered on campus in Galvez House.
