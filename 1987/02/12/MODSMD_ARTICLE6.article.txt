# Library plans in dispute
## 
### TODD PIERCE Staff writer 
The Reagan Library controversy in
creased several decibels in volume recently
in response to remarks by its architect and
after the Santa Clara County Planning
Commission reaffirmed its support for the
library's site — rejecting a petition signed
by more than 3,500 people.
Architect Hugh Stubbins angered many
when he labeled Stanford's sandstone
buildings "very ugly." Stubbins made the
comments while unveiling the library plans
in Washington, D.C.
In addition, recent comments by Hoover
Institution director W. Glenn Campbell
linking the University to the Reagan admin
istration angered Political Science Prof.
David Abernethy.
But despite protest, "Stanford approval is
more or less finished except for the lease
agreement with the National Archives,"
said Charles Palm, liaison between the
Reagan Presidential Foundation and the
University.
But libraiy planners have not put away
their erasers. "We are re-evaluating meeting
room space at the request of the Stanford
trustees," Palm said. He said the size of the
auditorium, currently 350 seats, is also
being reconsidered.
Abernethy, the only faculty member on
the library planning committee, questioned
whether the plan meets the low-visibility re
quirement delineated by the Santa Clara
County Planning Commission.
He questioned the need for a second story
on the library for conference rooms and en
tertainment space for the president.
"The visibility was clearly affected by the
architect's plans. My objection to the floor
overlooking campus is that it is not per
forming a scholarly function," he said. He

added that "the space devoted to conference
facilities is excessive."
Abernethy, who originally agreed to locate
the library in the foothills, has withdrawn
his support for that location because Stub
bins' plans disregarded two previous condi
tions. While the planning committee had
prohibited an access road across flat land
now used by joggers and determined that
the library should not be seen from
campus, the new plans contain a two-lane
road cutting across jogging paths and
grazing pastures and add a second story to
the library building.
"If the conditions are not met, there's not
a valid case to locate the library on that
site," Abernethy said. He said there were
two other sites farther away that would be
more suitable.
Palm said the Board of Trustees had
decided on the access road and that the
design approved a second story. "David was
simply outvoted," he said.
The Santa Clara Planning Commission
rejected the petitioners' idea at a meeting
last week. That leaves the Ronald Reagan
Presidential Foundation with the tasks of
preparing an environmental Impact report
(EIR) and applying for a use permit. Palm
said neither would be finished for another
six months.
"Except for schematic designs, they won't
do anything until the EIR," Palm said.
Campbell, in Hoover's 1986 annual
report, said "not only the Hoover Institu
tion can boast of a Reagan connection, but
the entire University."
According to Abernethy, "those kinds of
remarks affect the possibility of a library
and hurt the reputation of the University
for being non-partisan."
A recent open letter by English Prof.
Ronald Rebholz and Political Science Prof.
John Manley called on the University to
"stop Hoover."
