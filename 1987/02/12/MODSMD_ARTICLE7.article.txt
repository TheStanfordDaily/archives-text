# Valentine's Day the French way
## 
### KATHY LACHENAUER Staff writer 
Leland Froshman dreams
about the perfect evening for
his Stanford valentine. He envi
sions a quaint French restau
rant where he and his sweet
heart can dine by candlelight
and sip champagne to soft
violin music.
Suddenly remembering that
he has no car and only *10 to
his name, Leland despairs be
cause he thinks that his
romantic vision is shattered.
But Leland need not worry.
La Crepe Chouette offers the lo
cation. affordability and

romantic atmosphere Stanford
students are looking for this
Valentine's Day.
Located in the French House
(610 Mayfield Ave), La Crepe
Chouette is a non-profit,
student-run restaurant. Resi
dents of the house band to
gether every Saturday to offer
the entire Stanford community
a chance to enjoy a taste of
France.
Senior Alex Perez, manager
for La Crepe Chouette, says
running the restaurant is "a
house activity which brings
people together."
About 15 of the 35 residents
in the French House are
actively involved In the restau
rant. According to Perez, there
is "a lot of enthusiasm " among
the participants.
For example, junior Jens
Broderson, a waiter for La
Crepe Chouette, says that
sometimes he works seven
hours in an evening. Despite
such a long shift, Broderson
sees his job as fun and not
"real" work.
"I waited at the Faculty Club
before, but this job is so differ
ent because it's student organ
ized," Broderson says.
Sharing Broderson's enthus
iasm, senior Palmer
Colamatino says that working
for La Crepe Chouette is "really
a special thing because you can
invite your friends over and
Impress them."
Each Saturday, Colamarino
and the rest of the restaurant's
helpers take part in the
cooking, which is an all-day af
fair. Everyone must take hourly
shifts throughout the day to
prepare the food for the even
ing's guests.
Recipes come from the house
chef, who has experience in
French cooking.
Translated into English, La
Crepe Chouette means "my
cute crepe," and crepes are the
restaurant's specialty.
Perez recommends poularde,
a crepe filled with chicken in
white wine sauce. But Perez
says that La Crepe Chouette's
real delicacies are Its desserts.
His favorites are the chocolate

crepes and the chocolate
mousse.
Although these dishes sound
appealing, sophomore Marshall
Schlff was not especially Im
pressed with his dinner last
Saturday. Schlffs advice Is "go
for the atmosphere and not the
food."
Unlike Schlff, senior Roger
Alt's only complaint was that he
wished he knew how to speak
French before he went. Alt, a
Resident Assistant, says La
Crepe Chouette has a "fun at
mosphere." Alt says he might
try to arrange a night at La
Crepe Chouette for his
dormmates.
Perez says that many fresh
men from Branner and Wilbur
Halls have come to the restau
rant. A >5 dinner includes
salad, a crepe, quiche, dessert
and coffee. The meal costs less
than a University Food Service
dinner.
If not the price, then the at
mosphere of La Crepe Chouette
might entice students. Red and
white checkered cloths cover
tables which are lit by candles.
French House residents play
the guitar and piano to enter
tain guests while they dine.
According to Perez, "La Crepe
Chouette is open to anyone
who wants to come and enjoy
French food."
But Saturday's dinner seems
especially geared to Valentine's
Day couples.
A special room will be set
aside for tables of two. The
night will Include complimen
tary champagne, flowers and a
violin string quartet which will
travel from table to table.
To all who go to La Crepe
Chouette this Valentine's Day,
bon appetlt!

Chouette this Valentine's Day,
bon appetlt!
Leland Froshman dreams
about the perfect evening for
his Stanford valentine. He envi
sions a quaint French restau
rant where he and his sweet
heart can dine by candlelight
and sip champagne to soft
violin music.
Suddenly remembering that
he has no car and only *10 to
his name, Leland despairs be
cause he thinks that his
romantic vision is shattered.
But Leland need not worry.
La Crepe Chouette offers the lo
cation. affordability and

romantic atmosphere Stanford
students are looking for this
Valentine's Day.
Located in the French House
(610 Mayfield Ave), La Crepe
Chouette is a non-profit,
student-run restaurant. Resi
dents of the house band to
gether every Saturday to offer
the entire Stanford community
a chance to enjoy a taste of
France.
Senior Alex Perez, manager
for La Crepe Chouette, says
running the restaurant is "a
house activity which brings
people together."
About 15 of the 35 residents
in the French House are
actively involved In the restau
rant. According to Perez, there
is "a lot of enthusiasm " among
the participants.
For example, junior Jens
Broderson, a waiter for La
Crepe Chouette, says that
sometimes he works seven
hours in an evening. Despite
such a long shift, Broderson
sees his job as fun and not
"real" work.
"I waited at the Faculty Club
before, but this job is so differ
ent because it's student organ
ized," Broderson says.
Sharing Broderson's enthus
iasm, senior Palmer
Colamatino says that working
for La Crepe Chouette is "really
a special thing because you can
invite your friends over and
Impress them."
Each Saturday, Colamarino
and the rest of the restaurant's
helpers take part in the
cooking, which is an all-day af
fair. Everyone must take hourly
shifts throughout the day to
prepare the food for the even
ing's guests.
Recipes come from the house
chef, who has experience in
French cooking.
Translated into English, La
Crepe Chouette means "my
cute crepe," and crepes are the
restaurant's specialty.
Perez recommends poularde,
a crepe filled with chicken in
white wine sauce. But Perez
says that La Crepe Chouette's
real delicacies are Its desserts.
His favorites are the chocolate

crepes and the chocolate
mousse.
Although these dishes sound
appealing, sophomore Marshall
Schlff was not especially Im
pressed with his dinner last
Saturday. Schlffs advice Is "go
for the atmosphere and not the
food."
Unlike Schlff, senior Roger
Alt's only complaint was that he
wished he knew how to speak
French before he went. Alt, a
Resident Assistant, says La
Crepe Chouette has a "fun at
mosphere." Alt says he might
try to arrange a night at La
Crepe Chouette for his
dormmates.
Perez says that many fresh
men from Branner and Wilbur
Halls have come to the restau
rant. A >5 dinner includes
salad, a crepe, quiche, dessert
and coffee. The meal costs less
than a University Food Service
dinner.
If not the price, then the at
mosphere of La Crepe Chouette
might entice students. Red and
white checkered cloths cover
tables which are lit by candles.
French House residents play
the guitar and piano to enter
tain guests while they dine.
According to Perez, "La Crepe
Chouette is open to anyone
who wants to come and enjoy
French food."
But Saturday's dinner seems
especially geared to Valentine's
Day couples.
A special room will be set
aside for tables of two. The
night will Include complimen
tary champagne, flowers and a
violin string quartet which will
travel from table to table.
To all who go to La Crepe
Chouette this Valentine's Day,
bon appetlt!
