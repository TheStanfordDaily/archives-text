Shamir urges U.S./Iran contact
JERUSALEM — Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir urged the
United States Wednesday to continue reaching out to potentially
friendly elements in Iran and to reject the "guilt complex" that he
suggested some Arab countries are trying to impose on Washing
ton for having supplied arms to Tehran.
Claims by Arab states such as Egypt and Jordan that the Iran
scandal has damaged American prestige and credibility in the
Middle East are "very much exaggerated." in an effort to extract
"compensation" in the form of arms sales or more economic aid,
the Israeli leader asserted in an interview with The Washington
Post.
But Shamir coupled his call for renewed American activism in
the Middle East with his first public indication that he did not ap
prove of Israel's role in helping ship U.S. arms to Iran.
Shamir said he had been "not very well informed" about the op
eration, and compared his attitude to that of Secretary of State
George Shultz, who opposed the arms shipments.
Reagan meets with Tower panel
WASHINGTON — President Reagan met yesterday for a second
time with the commission reviewing the workings of the National
Security Council in the wake of the Iran-contra affair, one day
after the panel had reviewed excerpts of the president's private
notes.
Reagan spent 70 minutes with the commission before granting
it a second extension, to Feb. 26., to complete its work.
Herbert Hetu, the commission spokesman, said its request for a
one-week extension from the previous Feb. 19 deadline "was
based on a recent acquisition of new material. " He would disclose
no information about the material, but said It was was unrelated
to the president's notes.
In a statement issued by presidential spokesman Marlin
Fitzwater. the White House said only that Reagan and the panel
reviewed "the development and execution of the Iran policy and
the president's role."
"The president answered all of the board's questions," Fitzwater
said. Reagan was joined by Peter Wallison, his White House attor
ney, and David Abshire, a special counselor appointed to handle
issues tied to the Iran-contra affair.
Senators investigate farm crisis
GARRETSON. S.D. — Three U.S. Senators were in the small
farming community of Garretson, near the Minnesota border yes
terday on the last leg of an unusual series of Senate Agriculture
Committee hearings, arranged by Sen. Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.), the
new chairman, to get a first-hand look at the farm economic
crisis.
Visiting the town with Leahy were Sens. Tom Daschle (D-S.D.)
and Kent Conrad (D-N.D.).
The story they heard in Garretson was a story they heard
repeatedly at stops in four other states since Monday — five years
of economic stress has raised grave doubts about the future in the
small rural towns that prosper only when farming prospers.
Even so, Garretson (population about 950) is holding on a bit
better than other towns of its size in the Farm Belt. A more diver
sified agricultural base and the availability of off-farm jobs in
nearby Sioux Falls has helped.
But Mayor Gene Hunt said the town cannot carry on much
longer. "The crisis is drying up our town's cash flow," he said.
Angered blacks plan to march
ATLANTA — Alabama blacks, angered by Republican Gov. Guy
Hunt's failure to name blacks to high-profile administration posts
and by attempts on the part of white Democratic legislative
leaders to "exclude" blacks from choice committee assignments in
the Legislature, plan a massive protest march on the state capitol
in Montgomery on Saturday.
Joe Reed, head of the Alabama Democratic Conference, one of
the state's most powerful black political organizations, said that
the march was designed to dramatize concerns among Alabama
blacks that "the clock is being turned back" on their hard-won po
litical gains.
"What's happening in Alabama is part of a whole national at
mosphere of conservatism and retrogression in racial matters,"
Reed charged. "We're not going to sit idly by and watch such ram
pant racism take its course here."
At least four black Alabama legislators, two senators and two
House members, have already resigned their committee appoint
ments In disgust at what they view as "the systematic exclusion of
blacks from meaningful leadership positions in the Legislature."
Officials cash in on Pope's visit
MONTEREY — Catholic officials here have angered
broadcasters and unsettled national church leaders by proposing
to auction off exclusive rights to live television coverage of the
Pope's visit to the city later this year.
The television rights bidding Is one of two fundralsing ideas
being posited by the diocese to cover the estimated *2 million cost
of Pope John Paul ll's Sept. 17 visit to Monterey and Carmel. Un
der the other idea, each of the 45 parishes in the diocese will be ex
pected to help cover costs in proportion to the number of tickets It
receives for a papal Mass at Laguna Seca raceway.
In proposing the sale of broadcast rights to area TV news direc
tors last week, diocesean communications director Ted Elisee
stressed that the papal visit, the first ever by a Pope to California,
is a "once-in-a-lifetime event." Deadline for submitting bids and a
"plan of action" Is March 15.
Broadcasters publicly scoffed at the proposal yesterday, al
though Monterey church officials contend that some stations
were considering it.
Punk singer faces prosecution
LOS ANGELES - Producers of the Dead Kennedy's
"Frankenchrist" album and lead singer Jello Biafra are not con
stitutionally protected from criminal prosecution for including an
allegedly pornographic poster with the album, a judge ruled yes
terday.
Los Angeles Municipal Court Judge Sherrill Luke rejected argu
ments that singers, manufacturers and distributors of record al
bums cannot be held responsible for sale of their material to
children, ruling that a California law banning distribution of
"harmful material" to minors can be applied to virtually anyone
Involved In that distribution.
Moreover, the First Amendment does not necessarily protect ar
tists and record manufacturers from prosecution when they take
no safeguards to ensure that such material is not sold to minors,
Luke said.
"Stripped of the legal niceties, the deciding question here Is
whether or not the statute in question Is valid as applied to these
defendants. All things considered, the court believes the statute in
question is so valid," Luke said. "I don't feel the constitutional
guarantees of free speech and due process would be violated if the
defendants were to be prosecuted under this statute." he added.

the Israeli leader asserted in an interview with The Washington
Post.
But Shamir coupled his call for renewed American activism in
the Middle East with his first public indication that he did not ap
prove of Israel's role in helping ship U.S. arms to Iran.
Shamir said he had been "not very well informed" about the op
eration, and compared his attitude to that of Secretary of State
George Shultz, who opposed the arms shipments.
Reagan meets with Tower panel
WASHINGTON — President Reagan met yesterday for a second
time with the commission reviewing the workings of the National
Security Council in the wake of the Iran-contra affair, one day
after the panel had reviewed excerpts of the president's private
notes.
Reagan spent 70 minutes with the commission before granting
it a second extension, to Feb. 26., to complete its work.
Herbert Hetu, the commission spokesman, said its request for a
one-week extension from the previous Feb. 19 deadline "was
based on a recent acquisition of new material. " He would disclose
no information about the material, but said It was was unrelated
to the president's notes.
In a statement issued by presidential spokesman Marlin
Fitzwater. the White House said only that Reagan and the panel
reviewed "the development and execution of the Iran policy and
the president's role."
"The president answered all of the board's questions," Fitzwater
said. Reagan was joined by Peter Wallison, his White House attor
ney, and David Abshire, a special counselor appointed to handle
issues tied to the Iran-contra affair.
Senators investigate farm crisis
GARRETSON. S.D. — Three U.S. Senators were in the small
farming community of Garretson, near the Minnesota border yes
terday on the last leg of an unusual series of Senate Agriculture
Committee hearings, arranged by Sen. Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.), the
new chairman, to get a first-hand look at the farm economic
crisis.
Visiting the town with Leahy were Sens. Tom Daschle (D-S.D.)
and Kent Conrad (D-N.D.).
The story they heard in Garretson was a story they heard
repeatedly at stops in four other states since Monday — five years
of economic stress has raised grave doubts about the future in the
small rural towns that prosper only when farming prospers.
Even so, Garretson (population about 950) is holding on a bit
better than other towns of its size in the Farm Belt. A more diver
sified agricultural base and the availability of off-farm jobs in
nearby Sioux Falls has helped.
But Mayor Gene Hunt said the town cannot carry on much
longer. "The crisis is drying up our town's cash flow," he said.
Angered blacks plan to march
ATLANTA — Alabama blacks, angered by Republican Gov. Guy
Hunt's failure to name blacks to high-profile administration posts
and by attempts on the part of white Democratic legislative
leaders to "exclude" blacks from choice committee assignments in
the Legislature, plan a massive protest march on the state capitol
in Montgomery on Saturday.
Joe Reed, head of the Alabama Democratic Conference, one of
the state's most powerful black political organizations, said that
the march was designed to dramatize concerns among Alabama
blacks that "the clock is being turned back" on their hard-won po
litical gains.
"What's happening in Alabama is part of a whole national at
mosphere of conservatism and retrogression in racial matters,"
Reed charged. "We're not going to sit idly by and watch such ram
pant racism take its course here."
At least four black Alabama legislators, two senators and two
House members, have already resigned their committee appoint
ments In disgust at what they view as "the systematic exclusion of
blacks from meaningful leadership positions in the Legislature."
Officials cash in on Pope's visit
MONTEREY — Catholic officials here have angered
broadcasters and unsettled national church leaders by proposing
to auction off exclusive rights to live television coverage of the
Pope's visit to the city later this year.
The television rights bidding Is one of two fundralsing ideas
being posited by the diocese to cover the estimated *2 million cost
of Pope John Paul ll's Sept. 17 visit to Monterey and Carmel. Un
der the other idea, each of the 45 parishes in the diocese will be ex
pected to help cover costs in proportion to the number of tickets It
receives for a papal Mass at Laguna Seca raceway.
In proposing the sale of broadcast rights to area TV news direc
tors last week, diocesean communications director Ted Elisee
stressed that the papal visit, the first ever by a Pope to California,
is a "once-in-a-lifetime event." Deadline for submitting bids and a
"plan of action" Is March 15.
Broadcasters publicly scoffed at the proposal yesterday, al
though Monterey church officials contend that some stations
were considering it.
Punk singer faces prosecution
LOS ANGELES - Producers of the Dead Kennedy's
"Frankenchrist" album and lead singer Jello Biafra are not con
stitutionally protected from criminal prosecution for including an
allegedly pornographic poster with the album, a judge ruled yes
terday.
Los Angeles Municipal Court Judge Sherrill Luke rejected argu
ments that singers, manufacturers and distributors of record al
bums cannot be held responsible for sale of their material to
children, ruling that a California law banning distribution of
"harmful material" to minors can be applied to virtually anyone
Involved In that distribution.
Moreover, the First Amendment does not necessarily protect ar
tists and record manufacturers from prosecution when they take
no safeguards to ensure that such material is not sold to minors,
Luke said.
"Stripped of the legal niceties, the deciding question here Is
whether or not the statute in question Is valid as applied to these
defendants. All things considered, the court believes the statute in
question is so valid," Luke said. "I don't feel the constitutional
guarantees of free speech and due process would be violated if the
defendants were to be prosecuted under this statute." he added.

Shamir urges U.S./Iran contact
JERUSALEM — Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir urged the
United States Wednesday to continue reaching out to potentially
friendly elements in Iran and to reject the "guilt complex" that he
suggested some Arab countries are trying to impose on Washing
ton for having supplied arms to Tehran.
Claims by Arab states such as Egypt and Jordan that the Iran
scandal has damaged American prestige and credibility in the
Middle East are "very much exaggerated." in an effort to extract
"compensation" in the form of arms sales or more economic aid,
the Israeli leader asserted in an interview with The Washington
