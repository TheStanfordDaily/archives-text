# Frosh must decide on new track
## 
### LORI SILVER Staff writer 
With final preparations under way for the alterna
tive spring quarter Western Culture course, fresh
men must decide today whether or not to enroll In
the new course instead of the third quarter of their
previous Western Culture track.
The course, "Western Culture: An Alternative
View," will be limited to 100 students. Interested stu
dents now enrolled in any Western Culture track
must file a request today to take the course, which
will be taught by History Prof. Clay Carson.
If more than 100 students opt to take the course,
students will be chosen at random, according to His
tory Prof. Paul Robinson, director of the Western Cul
ture program.
The course, which will focus on the contributions
of women and minorities to western culture, will be
taught Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday at 10 a.m.
with a two-hour discussion section, according to a
letter Robinson sent to all freshmen. Freshmen also
received Carson's syllabus and their current track's
spring reading list.
Professors expect the course — which they con
sider experimental — to provide information that
will enable them to decide whether or not the entire
Western Culture program needs to be reformed.
The course will have a "profound impact on the
whole program." said History Prof.
Paul Seaver, who heads the West
ern Culture task force, which is ex
amining possible long-term
reforms In the program.
"This kind of experiment is
valuable in a number of ways. It
will help us find what kind of stu
dent demand there is for the
course, and it will provide new
source material that other tracks
can borrow," he said.
Whether freshmen will opt to
take the class because they are
genuinely interested or because
they are dissatisfied with their
current track is an Important
Issue, Seaver said.
Freshman Ashley Ryan said she
requested to take the class be
cause she "heard that Clay Carson
is such a good professor and be
cause it's a new, experimental
course."
Freshman Matt Schwartz said
he thought the course's reading
list sounded interesting.
English Prof. Ronald Rebholz
objected to the course fulfilling the
Western Culture requirement be
cause "It involves too many sec
ondary and not enough primary
readings," he said.
Instead. Rebholz said he
believes the course "would be a far

more valuable way of fulfilling the
non-Western requirement than
courses on Eastern religions."
According to Carson, the
course, which he called a short
term solution, will only be offered
this year.
"I created It to meet guidelines
that I hope won't exist after this
year," he said.
"We really need to rethink the
question of what should be re
quired of all students as part of
their Stanford education. The
only year-long required course in
Western Culture. It needs to be
rethought in the context of the
1980s. Students need to be
exposed to ideas, cultural variety
In the world." he said.
"The whole point of reform is to
get the Western Culture program
to reflect what has been going on
in newly developed fields, such as
women's studies and black
studies," Carson said.
