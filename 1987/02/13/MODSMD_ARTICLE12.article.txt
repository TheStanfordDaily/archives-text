# Coverage of STDs mixed, panel finds
## 
### MARCUS MABRY Senior staff writer 
Journalists and media experts said last
night that the local media has done a generally
good job covering sexually transmitted
diseases (STDs). particularly AIDS, but they
also highlighted many areas of reporting on
the subject that the media should try to Im
prove.
Every member of the panel agreed that the
media has played an invaluable role in the edu
cation of the public about STDs and AIDS, but
some said that the press, both electronic and
print, may have been "beating them (the is
sues) into the ground."
The panel discussion was part of the Human
Biology 128 lecture series, sponsored by the
departments of Human Biology and Feminist

Studies, the Student Affairs Office and stu
dent health organizations.
The panel consisted of David Perlman. sci
ence editor for the San Francisco Chronicle;
Micheal Helqulst. a reporter for Focus maga
zine; Holly Smith, media relations coordinator
for the San Francisco AIDS Foundation; Dr.
Howard Torman. a nationally syndicated medi
cal reporter; and Dianne Fukami, news direc
tor of KPIX-TV in San Francisco.
The program began with opening state
ments by each panelist, included a discussion
among the panelists and concluded with ques
tions from the audience. The program was
moderated by Craig Heller, chairman of ihe
Human Biology Program.
Torman. until recently a medical reporter for
KRON-TV in San Francisco, said television is

guilty of not examining issues In depth. "TV
news has an insatiable appetite for what's hap
pening now. It doesn't have time for what con
ccrned us yesterday."he said.
The panel also charged the media with ini
tially designating AIDS as an exclusively
homosexual disease, even though that was
never the case. "Early on we labeled and stig
matized AIDS as the gay plague." Smith said.
The panelists also discussed social impedi
ments the media has had to overcome in its at
tempt to educate the public. Helquist cited
Americans' overall lack of "medical sophistica
tion" as the chief problem in communicating
the facts to them. Smith said the media must
be allowed to use explicit language connected
with STDs and AIDS in order to communicate
most effectively.
