## THE 						STANFORD DAILY An Independent Newspaper Call Oral's bluff 
### 
"And then there was Oral, and God said it
was good." TV evangelist Oral Roberts,
however, may not be around much longer.
His life hinges on his ability to raise *8 mil
lion — an amount God told Roberts he must
raise if he hopes to survive the month of
March.
Roberts' plea for his followers to donate
cash, lest he be divinely executed, reveals the
utter hypocrisy, contempt, conceit and, yes,
blasphemy of the whole lot of television's
übiquitous preachers. We can only hope
Roberts' gambit will sound the death knell,
so to speak, of the evangelical movement on
television.
There is something inherently disgraceful
about the TV evangelism movement; the
word of God has been perverted into a TV
melee. The main problem with the evan
gelists is that their organizations worship
the dollar far more than anything else.
Money is the name of the TV religion game.
"I'll preach against such worldly ills as greed
and ambition, but only if you donate to me
large sums of money," these TV religious per
sonalities seem to say.

Many people will feed money into Roberts'
coffers. Money, however, is a precious thing,
and shouldn't be wasted on useless causes.
Besides, it is likely that the poorest of
Roberts' viewers, who look to him for the in
spiration necessary to make it through life,
will give cash that they need for themselves.
When it comes right down to it, Roberts is ex
hibiting nothing more than gross avarice.
While his "put-up or shut-me-up-forever"
call does display Robert's impressive faith in
the liquidity of his followers, his plea
amounts to little more than mass extortion.
Roberts is no more than a TV terrorist; he
seeks to achieve his goals by instilling fear
into the hearts of his flock. It has always
been the desire of most Americans that the
country not give into terrorism — let's hope
the public does not start now.
When April Fool's Day rolls around and
Roberts has not raised the requisite sum —
but yet still finds himself breathing — the
power of the preacher will be broken. Per
haps his disgrace will be the catalyst for the
elimination of television's religious
demagogues. Come on, America. Call Oral's
bluff.
