ADAM ARONSON

Her ideas are in the genre of religious thought that
led religious leaders in the 17th century to condemn
Galileo and his followers as heretics, that led religi
ous leaders in this country only a century ago to
quote Scriptural passages to justify the perpetuation
of slavery ("Slaves be obedient to those who are your
earthly masters," Ephesians 6:5), and that has led
religious people in every age to justify the persecu
tion and execution of people of "inferior" races and
religions.
Lo's argument is understandable within the con
text of our society. People are afraid of and react
against what they don't understand, and they look
for justification for their fearful reactions. The most
convenient justification for what otherwise cannot
be understood or explained is the religious justifica
tion; "God says so" becomes the final argument.
In the 17th century people were afraid to accept
Galileo's heliocentric theory because it threatened
earthly and human prominence in the universe.
Moreover, it contradicted their "common sense" —
one need only look into the sky to see that the sun
revolved around the earth.
In the same way people today feel threatened by the
increasing evidence that homosexuality is a com
pletely natural way of life for millions of people.
Moreover, it seems "common sense" that
homosexuality must be wrong, for heterosexuals
need only examine their own feelings to find that
they don't feel "that way." Never mind that gay
people's only "crime" is loving other people who hap
pen to be of the same gender.
While Lo's argument is understandable, it cannot
be excusable, for it promotes the same sort of stag
nancy in religion and in understanding our world as
did the religious reaction against Galileo. In insist
ing that homosexuality is "unnatural," Lo shows the
same disregard for irrefutable evidence to the con
trary that religious people in Galileo's time showed
for his irrefutable evidence that the earth revolves
around the sun; study after study shows that being

gay is natural for about 10 percent of the population,
human and animal, and that one's socio-sexual ori
entation cannot be changed.
"Truth is immutable," as Lo says, but human un
derstanding of truth is not. When religion is used as
an excuse to suppress a better understanding of our
world and the people in it, it Is shrouding truth
rather than fostering a heightened awareness of it.
Yet organized religion need not be, and in many
cases is not, a stagnant force in society. It can in
stead grow and develop with increased human un
derstanding. Many sects of Christianity (such as the
conservative Quakers) and several branches of
Judaism are today recognizing the injustices that
have been committed throughout history against gay
people in the name of religion, and rather than ad
hering doggedly to ill-conceived and disproved no
tions, they are helping their congregants advance
beyond misunderstanding and fear.
Though "Christians have a duty to hate
homosexuality," according to Lo, they also "have a
duty not to condemn homosexuals themselves." If
those Christians who could not find it within them
selves to accept homosexuality as part of the natural
human diversity in our world were to uphold their
"duty not to condemn," many of the problems that
gay people face every day would not exist. If this
"duty" were upheld, we would not see religious
leaders on television proclaiming that homosexuality
should be punished as a capital crime; we would not
have to endure "fag bashing" while society, turning
its head, justifies its apathy (or its outright hostility)
with quotations from the Scripture; and we would
not have to be afraid to feel the love that we feel and
to be the people that we are.
Unfortunately the reality has been that people gen
erally condemn, persecute and discriminate against
those who embody what they "hate."
"Truth is immutable," and being gay is the truth
for millions of people — their true nature — and as
immutable as any other truth. As long as religious
people continue to escape from this truth by encour
aging and excusing hatred, oppression and con
demnation of homosexuality under the guise of reli
gious piety, they will continue to perpetuate the suf
fering of millions of human beings as well as their
own misunderstanding of the natural diversity in
our world.

Lo's argument is understandable within the con
text of our society. People are afraid of and react
against what they don't understand, and they look
for justification for their fearful reactions. The most
convenient justification for what otherwise cannot
be understood or explained is the religious justifica
tion; "God says so" becomes the final argument.
In the 17th century people were afraid to accept
Galileo's heliocentric theory because it threatened
earthly and human prominence in the universe.
Moreover, it contradicted their "common sense" —
one need only look into the sky to see that the sun
revolved around the earth.
In the same way people today feel threatened by the
increasing evidence that homosexuality is a com
pletely natural way of life for millions of people.
Moreover, it seems "common sense" that
homosexuality must be wrong, for heterosexuals
need only examine their own feelings to find that
they don't feel "that way." Never mind that gay
people's only "crime" is loving other people who hap
pen to be of the same gender.
While Lo's argument is understandable, it cannot
be excusable, for it promotes the same sort of stag
nancy in religion and in understanding our world as
did the religious reaction against Galileo. In insist
ing that homosexuality is "unnatural," Lo shows the
same disregard for irrefutable evidence to the con
trary that religious people in Galileo's time showed
for his irrefutable evidence that the earth revolves
around the sun; study after study shows that being

gay is natural for about 10 percent of the population,
human and animal, and that one's socio-sexual ori
entation cannot be changed.
"Truth is immutable," as Lo says, but human un
derstanding of truth is not. When religion is used as
an excuse to suppress a better understanding of our
world and the people in it, it Is shrouding truth
rather than fostering a heightened awareness of it.
Yet organized religion need not be, and in many
cases is not, a stagnant force in society. It can in
stead grow and develop with increased human un
derstanding. Many sects of Christianity (such as the
conservative Quakers) and several branches of
Judaism are today recognizing the injustices that
have been committed throughout history against gay
people in the name of religion, and rather than ad
hering doggedly to ill-conceived and disproved no
tions, they are helping their congregants advance
beyond misunderstanding and fear.
Though "Christians have a duty to hate
homosexuality," according to Lo, they also "have a
duty not to condemn homosexuals themselves." If
those Christians who could not find it within them
selves to accept homosexuality as part of the natural
human diversity in our world were to uphold their
"duty not to condemn," many of the problems that
gay people face every day would not exist. If this
"duty" were upheld, we would not see religious
leaders on television proclaiming that homosexuality
should be punished as a capital crime; we would not
have to endure "fag bashing" while society, turning
its head, justifies its apathy (or its outright hostility)
with quotations from the Scripture; and we would
not have to be afraid to feel the love that we feel and
to be the people that we are.
Unfortunately the reality has been that people gen
erally condemn, persecute and discriminate against
those who embody what they "hate."
"Truth is immutable," and being gay is the truth
for millions of people — their true nature — and as
immutable as any other truth. As long as religious
people continue to escape from this truth by encour
aging and excusing hatred, oppression and con
demnation of homosexuality under the guise of reli
gious piety, they will continue to perpetuate the suf
fering of millions of human beings as well as their
own misunderstanding of the natural diversity in
our world.

Lily Lo's recent viewpoint (Daily, Feb. 5) purport
ing that "God's standards will never allow Christians
' to stop seeing homosexuality itself as wrong"
• demonstrates the same sort of religious short
sightedness that has suppressed human under
' standing and fostered bigotry throughout history.

Her ideas are in the genre of religious thought that
led religious leaders in the 17th century to condemn
Galileo and his followers as heretics, that led religi
ous leaders in this country only a century ago to
quote Scriptural passages to justify the perpetuation
of slavery ("Slaves be obedient to those who are your
earthly masters," Ephesians 6:5), and that has led
religious people in every age to justify the persecu
tion and execution of people of "inferior" races and
religions.
