# Racism, alive and well, is not isolated
## 
### 
Two racially motivated attacks have
captured many headlines lately. In Forsyth
County, Georgia, two civil rights marches were
disrupted by the Ku Klux Klan and Its sympat
hizers. In Howard Beach, a neighborhood of
Queens. N.Y.. a black man was struck by a car
and killed while being chased by whites.
While attention to these incidents is good.

there is a bad side. There Is a danger that
people are becoming comfortable in believing
that today's racism occurs in isolated places
they have never heard of. There is also a mis
conception that racism occurs as the product
of a very distasteful group like the KKK. This
belief — along with a general denial of the exis
tence of racism — is being perpetuated by the
statements of William Bradford Reynolds, the
head of the Justice Department's civil rights
section. In addition, racism is alive and well in
the United States, and that includes here at
Stanford, an alleged beacon of enlightenment
in the West. First, some dirt on Reynolds.
In criticizing the media attention to tin
Georgia incident. Reynolds described the Klan
faction as "a small band of bystanders whose
childish prattle went almost completely un
noticed." In fact, hundreds of racists threw
rocks and chanted racial Insults. More than 60
people were arrested. They dldn t go "almost
completely unnoticed" as Reynolds claims.
Americans "are with Increasing volume and

anger beginning to stand up and be heard, to
express ... a deep and abiding revulsion for
the Klan ... as well as for the sort of racial vio
lence that put Howard Beach on the national
map." Reynolds said. Is he saying that the bat
tle against racism is almost won? This Is any
thing but true. No one with his attitude should
hold such an Important civil rights position in
government. The opinion of many black
leaders that the Reagan administration has
created a climate in which racism can thrive is
weh founded.
Bradford also claims that overt racist attacks
have decreased, which has outraged minority
leaders who have documented an increase
during the past seven years. I'm not convinced
one way or the other whether the attacks have
Increased or decreased, and I'm not sure I care
per se. Quibbling over data involving incidents
that are not always reported obscures the
issue. It serves to limit racism to the most out
rageous acts. There are more whites worried
about members of minority groups moving
Into neighborhoods and schools than there are
Americans bursting at the seams to somehow
express revulsion for the Klan. as Reynolds
would have us believe. An argument over how
many "Howard Beaches" there were in 1986
compared to 1985 is not productive. It veils the
fact that racism is all too prevalent all over
America, taking forms more subtle than in
Howard Beach. Racism will not have disap
peared or even declined dramatically if there
are no Howard Beaches next year.
Racism is sometimes excused as a phenome
non limited to backward Southern states and
rednecks. This denies what is staring us in the
face everywhere, including at Stanford. Last
year a shanty built in White Plaza to display
the plight of black South Africans was

destroyed. A Nobel laureate here has advanced
theories of genetic inferiority. At the Hoover In
stitution, Joseph Coors (as in brewed from
Rocky Mountain water) sits on the Board of
Directors. He recently implied to an audience
of black businessmen that the best thing to
happen to American blacks was when they
were brought in chains and forced to live here.
1 have heard a few Stanford students express
blatant beliefs of white supremacy. This was
the greatest shock 1 have experienced at Stan
ford. I have heard students say they do not fa
vor divestment because "blacks are not capable
of ruling in Africa." They cite the terrible and
black dictatorships that have indeed existed
on that continent. But I've never heard anyone
say that whites should be denied a right to gov
ern in America because Hitler was a bad guy.
There are more subtle Instances of racism at
Stanford. A friend told me that he got out of a
car to urinate at night, but that because there
were three black men standing at a bus stop
nearby he quickly returned to the car. Con
versation widely accepted at Stanford Includes
"Is that a good high school?" "No. it's mostly
black (or Hispanic, etc.)."
Perhaps Reynolds is right that racial attacks
like Howard Beach are declining, but racism is
not. It is alive and well, and we are certainly
not Immune to it here. Looking back on what
I've written. I feel I state the obvious. But for
every time I think it is obvious, a Stanford stu
dent says he has not heard of Howard Beach or
someone tells me, when he learns that I am
writing a column on the prevalence of racism,
that "people's attitudes can't be legislated" —
the same thing they argued before Brown v.
Board of Education and the Civil Rights Act.
We've come a long way. baby.

express revulsion for the Klan. as Reynolds
would have us believe. An argument over how
many "Howard Beaches" there were in 1986
compared to 1985 is not productive. It veils the
fact that racism is all too prevalent all over
America, taking forms more subtle than in
Howard Beach. Racism will not have disap
peared or even declined dramatically if there
are no Howard Beaches next year.
Racism is sometimes excused as a phenome
non limited to backward Southern states and
rednecks. This denies what is staring us in the
face everywhere, including at Stanford. Last
year a shanty built in White Plaza to display
the plight of black South Africans was

destroyed. A Nobel laureate here has advanced
theories of genetic inferiority. At the Hoover In
stitution, Joseph Coors (as in brewed from
Rocky Mountain water) sits on the Board of
Directors. He recently implied to an audience
of black businessmen that the best thing to
happen to American blacks was when they
were brought in chains and forced to live here.
1 have heard a few Stanford students express
blatant beliefs of white supremacy. This was
the greatest shock 1 have experienced at Stan
ford. I have heard students say they do not fa
vor divestment because "blacks are not capable
of ruling in Africa." They cite the terrible and
black dictatorships that have indeed existed
on that continent. But I've never heard anyone
say that whites should be denied a right to gov
ern in America because Hitler was a bad guy.
There are more subtle Instances of racism at
Stanford. A friend told me that he got out of a
car to urinate at night, but that because there
were three black men standing at a bus stop
nearby he quickly returned to the car. Con
versation widely accepted at Stanford Includes
"Is that a good high school?" "No. it's mostly
black (or Hispanic, etc.)."
Perhaps Reynolds is right that racial attacks
like Howard Beach are declining, but racism is
not. It is alive and well, and we are certainly
not Immune to it here. Looking back on what
I've written. I feel I state the obvious. But for
every time I think it is obvious, a Stanford stu
dent says he has not heard of Howard Beach or
someone tells me, when he learns that I am
writing a column on the prevalence of racism,
that "people's attitudes can't be legislated" —
the same thing they argued before Brown v.
Board of Education and the Civil Rights Act.
We've come a long way. baby.

Editor's Notes
wmm—mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmtrnl
Two racially motivated attacks have
captured many headlines lately. In Forsyth
County, Georgia, two civil rights marches were
disrupted by the Ku Klux Klan and Its sympat
hizers. In Howard Beach, a neighborhood of
Queens. N.Y.. a black man was struck by a car
and killed while being chased by whites.
While attention to these incidents is good.

there is a bad side. There Is a danger that
people are becoming comfortable in believing
that today's racism occurs in isolated places
they have never heard of. There is also a mis
conception that racism occurs as the product
of a very distasteful group like the KKK. This
belief — along with a general denial of the exis
tence of racism — is being perpetuated by the
statements of William Bradford Reynolds, the
head of the Justice Department's civil rights
section. In addition, racism is alive and well in
the United States, and that includes here at
Stanford, an alleged beacon of enlightenment
in the West. First, some dirt on Reynolds.
In criticizing the media attention to tin
Georgia incident. Reynolds described the Klan
faction as "a small band of bystanders whose
childish prattle went almost completely un
noticed." In fact, hundreds of racists threw
rocks and chanted racial Insults. More than 60
people were arrested. They dldn t go "almost
completely unnoticed" as Reynolds claims.
Americans "are with Increasing volume and

anger beginning to stand up and be heard, to
express ... a deep and abiding revulsion for
the Klan ... as well as for the sort of racial vio
lence that put Howard Beach on the national
map." Reynolds said. Is he saying that the bat
tle against racism is almost won? This Is any
thing but true. No one with his attitude should
hold such an Important civil rights position in
government. The opinion of many black
leaders that the Reagan administration has
created a climate in which racism can thrive is
weh founded.
Bradford also claims that overt racist attacks
have decreased, which has outraged minority
leaders who have documented an increase
during the past seven years. I'm not convinced
one way or the other whether the attacks have
Increased or decreased, and I'm not sure I care
per se. Quibbling over data involving incidents
that are not always reported obscures the
issue. It serves to limit racism to the most out
rageous acts. There are more whites worried
about members of minority groups moving
Into neighborhoods and schools than there are
