Cut managers'
salaries
Jim Durkin's recent column
(Daily, Feb. 3) smacks of an offen
sive kind of elitism. He implies
that Stanford should do whatever
possible to abuse workers more
—a la McDonald's — simply so
that he can enjoy a less expensive
hamburger. But why, I wonder,
does he blame the workers for
this unfortunate drain on his
pocketbook?
Stanford workers receive
salaries and benefits far below
those of Stanford's numerous
Food Service supervisors and
managers. What Durkin should
have proposed, to slash his ham
burger costs most drastically, is
that the salaries and benefits of
Food Service administrators be
reduced to McDonald's levels.
This cut seems only fair. After all,
the managers merely spend their
time watching other people work
or sitting in their offices. It is the
workers who actually perform the
labor that allows Durkin to eat
his overpriced burger.

New idea for
library
location
In light of the controversy sur
rounding the placement of the
Reagan Library in the foothills
surrounding the campus, per
haps the Board of Trustees
should consider another location.
If the library were to be placed
where I'm thinking, it would end
the furor over the desecration of
the beautiful foothills. More im
portantly, there would be no need
to submit an environmental im
pact report.
Where? Why. the Saks Fifth
Avenue store in the Stanford
Shopping Center. There the li
brary would be located amid a
monument to capitalism and the
American way. among what is
best about suburban America.
The archives could be placed on
the third floor while the historical
displays could be on the second
floor, between replicas of Nancy's
famous dresses and that much
needed White House china.

The judicial
process and
drunk driving
Thanks for the recent article
(Dally, Feb. 5) on DUI incidents
on campus that have involved
Stanford students. I hope It
served to clarify the circum
stances under which drunk
driving on campus will be viewed
as a possible violation of the Fun
damental Standard.
I would like to correct an Im
pression conveyed by the article
that my function in the Judicial
process Is to determine guilt or
Innocence. Not so. I evaluate
evidence of possible misconduct
and then decide whether the
strength of that evidence war
rants pursuing the matter
through a formal judicial process.
In cases where a student denies
guilt, that initial decision is then
scrutinized by an off-campus
attorney and subsequently by the
Stanford Judicial Council, an
annually appointed body of stu
dents and faculty.
