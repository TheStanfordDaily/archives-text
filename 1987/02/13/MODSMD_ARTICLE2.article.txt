# Report attacks perceptions of compliance
## 
### MARK LEMLEY Staff writer 
U S. and perceptions about compli
ance with agreements on~ nuclear wcispons have
created a crisis in arms control, according to a report
released yesterday by a Stanford arms control group.
Global Outlook, a working group of the Stanford
Center for International Security and Arms Control,
says the United States "must seek to restore the
process of dispute resolution" neglected by the
Reagan administration if it expects past, present or
future arms control agreements to work.
The report, entitled "Compliance and the Future of
Arms Control." is the culmination of 18 months of
research by the center. Its findings were released at a
press conference at the Brookings Institution in
Washington, D.C. The report is the largest compre
hensive study of arms control compliance ever pub
lished by a private organization.
The authors argue that "the image that either So
viet or American arms control compliance has been
weak in the past is false." They note that most arms
treaties today are upheld without question, and that
even where compliance is questioned, both sides
have abided by the most central provisions.
The report blames false perceptions largely on the
Reagan administration, saying that the administra-
tion's annual reports "over
emphasized Soviet violations of
agreements."
The Arms Control and Disarma
ment Agency, the government
agency that publishes non
compliance reports, could not be
reached yesterday to comment on
the allegation.
Of the dozens of allegations
made each year on each side about

failure to comply with arms
treaties, the report's authors
found only one clear violation; the
Soviet large phased-array radar
(LPAR) at Krasnoyarsk.
The radar was apparently built
as part of a national early-warning
system. Such systems are
outlawed under the Anti-Ballistic
Missile (ABM) Treaty of 1972.
The Soviets say the radar sta
tion is used for tracking of space
probes.
The report also expresses con
cern about three "gray areas." So
viet deployment of SS-25 intercon
tinental ballistic missiles, Soviet

encryption of its missile test data,
and U.S. modernization of its
LPAR's in Greenland. Great Brit
ain and the United States con
stitute "causes for concern."
The United States has also at
tempted to "reinterpret" the ABM
Treaty to allow the Department of
Defense to test and deploy its Stra
tegic Defense Initiative, according
to the report. The report criticizes
the action, noting that the move
has little legal basis and would vio
late the clear intent of the pact.
In addition, the group says the
ABM agreement allowed research
and development work on SDI to

continue. The report notes that
SDI research — funded by a
budget approved in Congress —
could all be conducted within the
scope of the treaty.
While the report says compli
ance with arms pacts has not been
perfect, it notes that "none of
these activities . . . has major na
tional security implications for
either side."
Further, the group contends
that where compliance issues
were of concern, the most produc
tive approach was to raise the
issue in the Standing Con
sultative Commission.
