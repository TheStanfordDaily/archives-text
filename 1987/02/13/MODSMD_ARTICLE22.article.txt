## Stanford in Japan: Not such a new idea 
### BRYAN COOPERRIDER 
On the sidelines of all of the excitement about new
Stanford overseas centers around the world is a
small, often overlooked program that has been send
ing Stanford students to Japan and bringing
Japanese students to Stanford for more than 30
years.
Each spring, students from Keio University in
Tokyo come to Stanford; each summer, students
from Stanford go to Keio. On Feb. 22. eight Keio stu
dents — seven women and one man — will arrive
here to spend three weeks with host families and
then move onto campus for the remainder of their
two-month stay.
The Stanford-Keio exchange began in 1954 when
Stanford Political Science Prof. James T. Watkins
went to Japan to teach English. During his stay he
recognized similarities between Stanford and Keio
and conceived the idea of an exchange.
"Keio has a reputation like Stanford." said David
Akiyama. a 1985 exchange student.
The exchange program, as set up by Watkins, was
originally administered by an organization called the
International Institute of Relations (IIR). When the
lIR folded in the 19605, the Keio exchange survived
as a student-run program.
At the Stanford end. "the basic goal of the program
is to introduce Japanese students to American life,"
said Mike Miyamoto, co-chairman of the Stanford-
Keio Exchange Committee.
The exchange program is more cultural than aca
demic. When the Japanese students arrive, they are
greeted by their host families, with whom they will
stay for three weeks.
"It's real easy to host the students because we're
not asked to do that much," said Sharon Wong, who
has been a program host for five years. Wong, who
works in the Governor's Corner office, noted that the
students have a full schedule.
"We wish we could spend more time with them,"
she added.
The Japanese students have very little trouble ad
justing to the American lifestyle. Communication is
not a problem because the students tend to speak
English quite fluently.

There are other difficulties, though. Several years
ago the difference in cultures became apparent in
one host family situation. "The Japanese, out of
tradition, don't accept food on the first offer. The
host family assumed they weren't hungry and didn't
offer again," said Miyamoto.
The Exchange Committee now tries to foresee
these problems and informs the host families about
Japanese customs. "We try to go to the houses of the
host families and give them a list of Japanese tradi
tions so they know what to expect," said Stefani
Tomono, Exchange Committee secretary.
Visiting a new country is often both a frightening
and exciting experience. The Japanese students
seem to come prepared, however. "We were shocked,
they came dressed so American," said Wong.
Host families often try to make students feel at
home by cooking Japanese food. This doesn't always
work, however.
"We had a student that hated Japanese food and
just loved fast food. He was more American than my
kids!" Wong said.
"It seems all the students want to be American
while they are here. They see America as freer and
more fun, but as a host family we try to point out

that there are problems with both cultures." she
added.
After three weeks the Japanese students move to
campus into any available dorm openings. The stu
dents stay on campus until June 1. They attend
classes but are not graded.
There are a variety of activities planned during
their stay, including white-water rafting and trips to
Santa Cruz, Tahoe. Yosemite and Pomona. The stu
dents also go bowling, horseback riding and ice
skating.
In the past, East Asian studies professors have
lectured to the visiting students. "We're trying to line
that up again as well as possibly getting an American
studies professor to talk about American society,"
said Miyamoto.
Last summer only one Stanford student made the
exchange trip to Japan to visit the Keio campus for
two months.
"They are really well organized in Japan and they
were really disappointed (to have) only one student,"
said Miyamoto.
In Japan, Stanford students live with host families
for the entire two months. "Tokyo is surprisingly
Americanized. My host family lived close to an Ameri
can grocery store where I could go to get everything I

wanted, including Fruit Loops, Akiyama said.
In 1985. during Aklyama's stay, the students
spent two weeks in the Kansai area just south of
Tokyo. Some of the scheduled events included visit
ing the historical sites in Kansai.
"The Kansai area is very old," with a lot of ancient
temples and interesting historical sites, Akiyama
said.
At the Keio campus the Stanford students went to
a few lectures, visited the campus and talked to the
professors in order to learn about the Japanese edu
cational system.
"As high school students the Japanese work very
hard, but I don't think they work real hard once
they're in a university," said Akiyama.
"The Japanese students accompanied us every day
on our excursions. I don't think they even went to
class until their finals." he added.
Some of the activities in the Tokyo area included
climbing Mt. Fuji, visiting Tokyo Disneyland and
touring the Nissan factory.
And. despite the relatively low value of the dollar,
the program is fairly affordable. "The nicest thing
about the program is that It is so inexpensive. You
only have to pay airfare and a program fee ol *500
dollars — the host families cover just about every
thing else," Akiyama commented.
There are no real requirements for the exchange —
only interest and a desire to learn about Japanese
culture. It's not even necessary to know the lan
guage.
"It's really a lot of fun; you meet so many people
and they take great care of you. The Japanese are
known for their hospitality," said Akiyama, who is
co-chairman of the program committee.
Students interested in meeting the Japanese stu
dents should attend the Keio Club's weekly meeting
Wednesdays at 12:15 in the Tresidder Aspen room.
"We always stress that new members are welcome,"
Miyamota said.
Akiyama pointed out that "we are always looking
for people that are interested in going to Japan — the
Japanese want more people to come."
The program members are also still looking for
Stanford or Palo Alto area host families. Individuals
interested in hosting students or just learning more
about the program can contact Mike Miyamota.
