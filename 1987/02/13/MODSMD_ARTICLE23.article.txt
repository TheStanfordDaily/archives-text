## Baseball hosts Fresno Stale Another PCAA challenge for Card 
### TOM SENF Editorial staff 
With the Pacific 10 Southern Di
vision season just two weeks
away. Stanford continues its prep
aration for its conference-opening
showdown against No. 2 UCLA
with a three-game weekend series
against perennial Pacific Coast
Athletic Association power Fresno
State.
The series begins tomorrow at
Sunken Diamond and continues
Sunday and Monday. All games
begin at 1 p.m.
The fourth-ranked Cardinal
responded well to its first PCAA
challenge, taking two of three
from No. 16 Fullerton State last
weekend on the road. Stanford
played only one game this week,
beating San Francisco State 13-6
on Wednesday to raise its record
to 6-2.
Freshman shortstop Troy Paul
sen paced an 11 -hit. 10-walk at
tack with four hits and six RBIs.
Paulsen is hitting .583 and is tied
for third with Ed Sprague (behind
Paul Carey and Ron Witmeyer) for

the team lead in RBIs with eight.
"He's played well for us," Stan
ford Coach Mark Marquess said.
"It's been tough to get him In the
lineup because David Esquer and
Frank Carey have played so well,
but we knew we had to get him
some playing time."

Middle infielders are not usually
known for their offensive fire
power, but Stanford has been get
ting good production from Paul

sen. senior shortstop Esquer and
second baseman Carey, who
started at short for the Cardinal
last year.
Against San Francisco State,
Esquer came off the bench to go 2-
for-2 with two runs scored and
two RBIs. Carey went 2-for-2 as
well and scored three runs,
raising his average to .333.
"We've been getting great play
up the middle from those three
guys," Marquess said. "It's been a
real plus for us."
For now it seems that Carey will
play second while Esquer and
Paulsen battle it out at short, al
though that situation could
change at any time. Paulsen
denies any tension between him
self and Esquer. welcoming the
competition.
"We're both good friends." he
said. "Sure we're competing, but
when I'm out there he's rooting for
me, and when he's out there I'm
rooting for him. When you know
there's somebody right behind
you, you know you have to play
well."
This factor of quality produced

by depth has also been present in
the Stanford pitching staff, which
has an ERA of 2.13. Lee Plemel (1-
2) and Steve Chitren (2-0) have
been the first two recipients of the
Six-Pac Pitcher of the Week award
and will start tomorrow and Sun
day. respectively.
Monday's starter will be Jack
McDowell, who made his first
1987 appearance against San
Francisco State with three
shutout innings. Marquess will
probably let McDowell go further
on Monday.
"We'll probably still put a limit
on him." Marquess said.
"(Wednesday) it was three innings
or 50 pitches, and he threw 28. We
could extend it to 60 or 70
pitches."
McDowell's opponent on Mon
day is another highly regarded
pitcher coming back from
shoulder problems. Fresno State's
Mike Goff was an All-PCAA selec
tion last year, going 11-5 with a
3.38 ERA. Unlike McDowell,
however, Goffs season debut was
