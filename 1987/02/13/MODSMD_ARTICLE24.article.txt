						Stanford fan sees things differently with Davis in Iowa

### GEOFF SANBORN Special to The Dally 
lOWA CITY, lowa â€” "Not even
comparable."
Midway thorough the first
half of last night's soldout game
between No. 4 lowa and No. 7
Purdue. I found myself writing
those words in my notebook. I
had just witnessed a beautifully
impossible feed from lowa's
B.J. Armstrong to teammate
Roy Marble, who proceeded to
turn, take two Boilermakers
into the air and lay in a gentle
left-handed bank on his way
down. I sat back in my chair,
listening to the wind-tunnel
roar of 15,500 ecstatic Haw
keye fans and thought, no
wonder Tom Davis decided to
come out here.
After four years of general

frustration on the bleachers of
Maples Pavilion, a sideline seat
for Purdue's 80-73 upset of
Davis' formerly No. 1-ranked
team was a revelation, a
glimpse of the kind of bas
ketball I had seen only on TV.
From the fans' perspective, at
least. Stanford basketball Is
nothing like the show they put
on in the Midwest.
It's not just the stratospheric
abilities of the athletes, al
though that is a big factor. It's
the two Diamond Vision
screens they have hanging
from the rafters. It's the wanna
be-Late-Night Hawkeye band,
complete with synthesizers, sit
down drummer, electric guitar
and bass, and oh yes. 30
backup horns.
