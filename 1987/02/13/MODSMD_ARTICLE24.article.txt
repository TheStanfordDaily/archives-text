# A 						Stanford fan sees things differently with Davis in Iowa
## 
### GEOFF SANBORN Special to The Dally 
lOWA CITY, lowa â€” "Not even
comparable."
Midway thorough the first
half of last night's soldout game
between No. 4 lowa and No. 7
Purdue. I found myself writing
those words in my notebook. I
had just witnessed a beautifully
impossible feed from lowa's
B.J. Armstrong to teammate
Roy Marble, who proceeded to
turn, take two Boilermakers
into the air and lay in a gentle
left-handed bank on his way
down. I sat back in my chair,
listening to the wind-tunnel
roar of 15,500 ecstatic Haw
keye fans and thought, no
wonder Tom Davis decided to
come out here.
After four years of general

frustration on the bleachers of
Maples Pavilion, a sideline seat
for Purdue's 80-73 upset of
Davis' formerly No. 1-ranked
team was a revelation, a
glimpse of the kind of bas
ketball I had seen only on TV.
From the fans' perspective, at
least. Stanford basketball Is
nothing like the show they put
on in the Midwest.
It's not just the stratospheric
abilities of the athletes, al
though that is a big factor. It's
the two Diamond Vision
screens they have hanging
from the rafters. It's the wanna
be-Late-Night Hawkeye band,
complete with synthesizers, sit
down drummer, electric guitar
and bass, and oh yes. 30
backup horns.
And most of all. It's the 15,000
other spectators, who live and die
on every shot and sent more chills
up my spine In two hours than I
got in some seasons in Maples.
Only one element of the game
was truly recognizable. Davis
looks the same, coaches the same
and responds to setbacks with the
same equanimity that he did for
four years at Stanford.
His players still press, throw
bounce passes and shift in and
out of the game every minute or
so. Davis still spends most of the
game squatting in front of his
bench, stroking his chin, until a
bad play or a questionable call
prompts him to stalk down the
sidelines for a closer look at the of
fending party. Then, as always, he
shakes his head, hikes up his
slacks and turns back to the
bench.
Nothing was out of the ordinary
at his postgame press conference,
either. Surrounded by eight televi
sion cameras and over 30 re
porters, he was as personable and
as philosophical about losses as
he was before a small circle of
Stanford correspondents.
The Big Ten game may look dif
ferent from the seats, but from
Davis' point of view, not much has
changed.
"Coaching is coaching," he said.
"People are surprised, but it's
really true.
"It's been fun with the rankings,
and it's nice for the kids, but
that's mostly a media thing,"
Davis continued. "I'm still just
coaching and recruiting, holding
press conferences twice a week,
the same as I did at Stanford."
Is there any difference In the
players?
"They're the same type of guys."
He paused. "A little taller, a little

quicker and deeper, maybe, but
otherwise. ... We had Greg
(Butler) back here this summer,
and he fit right in with the rest of
the kids."
And then, the coach of one of
the nation's 10 best teams began
to reminisce about his former em
ployer. "Stanford was just a fan
tastic place to be. Great faculty,

great 3taff . . . great people. It's
not that I never enjoyed it there. I
just didn't like losing. I kept won
dering, 'God, wasn't there some
thing else I could have done?' I
worried about what that was
doing to me."
Here in lowa City, after only
three losses in 24 games. Davis
doesn't look worried at all.

The players may be taller and quicker, but to former Stanford Coach
Tom Davis, things are not that much different as coach of No. 4 lowa,
an 80-73 loser to No. 7 Purdue last night "Coaching is coaching,"
Davis said.
