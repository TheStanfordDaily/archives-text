# Cardinal clawed by Cougars, 74-64
## 41-29 rebounding advantage, freshman guard Rowe's 24 points pace WSU; Stanford drops to 6-8 in Pac-10 
### SUSAN SLUSSER Editorial staff 
PULLMAN, Wash. - Who is Reco
Rowe?
The last time the Stanford men's bas
ketball team faced Washington State,
the 6-foot-5 Rowe played just two
minutes and did not score. Last night,
before 2,315 at Friel Court, the fresh
man guard got his first start of the
season and scored 24 points on nine-of
-12 shooting (including one of two three
pointers) and five-of-eight from the line
in the Cougars' 74-64 win.
The loss dropped Stanford to 12-11
and 6-8 in the Pacific 10 Conference, as
the Cardinal remains in seventh place.
Washington State is now 8-14 overall
and 4-9 in the league, alone in eighth
place.
"He's a good player," Stanford guard
Novian Whitsitt said of Rowe. "I hadn't
heard anything about him." "I hadn't
seen him much," Stanford Coach Mike
Montgomery said. "But we knew he was
a pretty good shooter. . . . When he
comes in and gets 24, that's a nice lift
for them to get from a guy coming off the
bench who hasn't started before."
Rowe, getting a start over Brian
Wright, who had been averaging 8.4
points per game, was averaging just 3.9
points going into last night, but Wash
ington State Coach Len Stevens felt
Rowe had played well enough lately to
get the call.
"Rico's earned it." Stevens said. "He's
been playing good and warranted a
start. . . . When you lose 10 out of 1 1
games and have got a guy who has
played pretty darn good, he deserves it."
"I was kind of nervous," Rowe ad
mitted. "But once the game started, I got
into the flow of things and my nervous
ness went away and I took the shots as
they came."
Wright, the man Rowe replaced in the
starting lineup, also performed well,
scoring 14 points in the second half and

16 total in just 21 minutes of play, as
Washington State wound up getting 40
points from essentially one position.
"Brian Wright played a hell of a game for
us," Stevens said.
"I didn't even find out I was starting
until yesterday," Rowe said. "Brian took
it in stride and we both did what Coach
wanted us to do. The shots were falling
and good things coming (were) out of
that."
A productive evening from the guards
was definitely a good thing for the
Cougars, as second-leading scorer Joe
Wallace did not start and was held to
just four points on the night in seven
minutes of play. The senior forward had
been averaging 15.4 points per game
and had scored more than 20 four times
against the Cardinal.
Wallace, the Pac-10 Player of the Week
last week after outings of 28 and 26
points in two games against Washing
ton, surrendered his starting position to
sophomore John Hodges, who was
averaging just 2.5 points per game.
Hodges totalled six points against the
Cardinal, and leading Cougar scorer
Brian Quinnett tallied 14 points, two
under his average. A big night from the
second guard position was crucial as
point guard Anthony Kidd scored only
two.
"A lot of people think that our guards
aren't as good as other teams'," said
Rowe, who also collected five rebounds.
"But I really don't think that's true. We
generally can do the same things as
other teams. We don't have the superior
ball handling, but we can do the things
Coach wants us to do. We have to be con
sistent."
Consistency was something Stanford
had difficulty with against Washington
State, particularly in the first half, when
the Cardinal was outrebounded 19-6
and shot 44 percent to the Courgars' 71
percent.
"The first half rebounding was a prob
lem again," Montgomery said. "And

when they shoot 70 percent, there's no
way we can compete with those kind of
numbers."
The Cardinal dug a hole for itself early,
going from the 14:29 mark to the 8:08
mark — a total of 6:21 — with just two
points, a pair of Todd Lichti free throws.
In that same stretch, the Cougars reeled
off 14 points to go up 28-15, and wound
up with a 40-29 lead at the half.
"They were able to do whatever they
wanted in the first half," Montgomery
said. "They got the ball inside, they got it
up off the boards, and our defense was
getting beat consistently. Washington
State pretty much had their own way in
the first half without question.
"We sure didn't do much In the first
half. We were not vec>L competitive; we
kind of floundered around."
"We played tentatively," Whitsitt
agreed. "We play like that too often. We
don't go ahead and play with confi
dence."
"We didn't really come out as hard as
we should have on defense," said Stan
ford guard Terry Taylor, who finished
with 14 points on five-of-10 shooting in
cluding three-for-three from three-point
range. "They got on a roll and got their
confidence going. It was downhill the
rest of the way for us. We had to play
catch-up the rest of the game."
The Cardinal did a good job of playing
catch-up in the opening minutes of the
second half, as Stanford outscored
Washington State 10-2 in a 4:36 stretch,
climaxing in a Lichti slam dunk, which
made the score 44-41 in favor of WSU.
The Cougars roared right back,
however, outscoring the Cardinal 14-2
in the next 4:52 to go up 58-43 as Quin
nett got two slams in a row and Wright
added a three-pointer, two baskets and a
free throw.

Stanford's inside woes continued last night, as the Cardinal was outrebounded 41-29
by Washington State. Eric Reveno and fellow big men Howard Wright and Greg Butler
combined for just 14 points, 10 by Wright in the Cardinal's 74-64 loss.

was fouled by Kidd and sank the
free throw, but that was as close
as the Cardinal would come.
"In the second half we were at
least competitive," Montgomery
said. "We cut it to three and we
didn't get outrebounded and
didn't get outshot."
"We couldn't sustain it," Whit
sitt said. "We didn't have the in
tensity to pounce on them when
they were weak."
Lichtl led Stanford with 17
points, and was among three
Stanford players with five
rebounds, as Howard Wright and
Eric Reveno also pulled down five.
Dwayne Scholten had 1 1
rebounds for the Cougars. Quln
nett added eight.
Still, the real story was the
surprise freshman Reco Rowe.
"You never expect a guy to come
right off the bench and get 24,"
Stevens said. "I was hoping he

would get about 12, and he got
twice that."
Stanford faces Washington to
morrow night (8 p.m., KCBS 740
AM, KZSU 90.1 FM, ESPN). The
Huskies are 13-11 overall and 7-6
in the Pac-10 after losing 70-68 to
California last night.
The fifth-place Huskies are led
by 1986 Pac-10 Player of the Year
Chris Welp. The 7-foot senior is
averaging 20.4 points per game
and nine rebounds. Six-foot-10
Phil Zevenbergen, who scored 25
points against Stanford in the 82-
77 Cardinal win at Maples earlier
this season, is averaging 15.9
points and 8.7 rebounds.
"It's our only nationally televised
game of the year," Taylor said, "It
would be nice if we could go in and
play well, maybe get a win. . . . It's
a big incentive."
Card notes
Four Stanford team jerseys were
stolen somewhere on the trip from San
Francisco to Spokane. Taylor. Scott
Meinert, Oliver Cunningham and
Charles Schwager were all victimized,
and Schwager was left without a uni
form and could not play.
