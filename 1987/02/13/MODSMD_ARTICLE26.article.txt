# Top butterfliers clash at Cal
## 
### BRENDAN HEALEY Senior staff writer 
They call her Madame Butterfly,
and Mary T. Meagher is tougher to
eatch than a Monarch flitting
about on a summer day.
Jenna Johnson has no such
nickname, but In the pool she
becomes a condor, surging power
fully as her body transforms into
one long sinew and her legs pound
the water, driving her torso up
and out so she can spread her
wings again.
In a sense, being a butterflier is
the constant quest for freedom as
the swimmer struggles to escape
the encumbrance of the medium
in which she moves. As perhaps
the top two butterfliers in the
world. Stanford's Johnson and
California's Meagher have found
this freedom, but they have a'Â«so
found that this freedom can be an
illusion.
Tommorrow. the two should
meet in the 100-yard butterfly for
one of the last times when the
Cardinal takes on the Bears in a 1
p.m. matchup at Cal's Spieker
Pool. Johnson is the heir apparent
to Meagher's spot at the top of the
butterfly world, and. with Meag
her contemplating retirement,
they may not race again after the

It is a generally accepted fact that Stanford sophomore Jenna Johnson is the preeminent American but
terflier of the future and that California senior Maiy T. Meagher is the butterflier of the past Who is domi
nant in the present, however, may be determined tomorrow when the Cardinal meets the Bears in a dual
meet in Berkeley.
NCAA meet in March.
"I'm beginning to feel older and
older In the sport, and I can see
her taking my place." said Meag
her. who set her first world record
at the age of 14 and is now a Cal
senior.
Meagher has reached a plateau
realized by few others in athletics.
Having held the world record in
the 100- and 200-meter butterfly
since 1979, she had few chal
lenges before Johnson came
along.
"It kind of gets lonely at the
top," Meagher said. "I lost a lot of
incentive to train. You get to the
top challenging people above you.
After a while I found it real hard.
Who's there to knock off but your
self?"

According to Johnson: "She
even told me. 'I was thinking of
quitting a long time ago If you
hadn't come along.' "
Johnson first knocked off Meag
her at the 1984 Olympic Trials in
the 100-meter butterfly but was
unable to beat the Cal star In a
short-course race until last year's
NCAA 100-yard butterfly final,
when she edged Meagher for the
title. Meagher knew then that she
was watching the woman who
would succeed her.
"I swam a perfect race in NCAAs.
and she beat me." Meagher said.
"For the longest time I've had a
mental block about her." Johnson
said. "Just by getting to know her
personally I've realized she's just a
regular person too. Our races are
getting closer and closer."
Those who expect a fierce rivalry
between the two will be disap
pointed. Their relationship is
founded on the kinship felt be

tween two people who share the
knowledge of what It's like to go
beyond the bounds of normal per
formances.
"We're not nearly as close as I'd
love to be." Meagher said. "1 never
really realized how intimidating I
was to her. It's people like her that
really help me keep going. More
and more. I realize how hard It is
to talk and relate to someone else.
They really can't relate to some of
the hard times you go through
being a top athlete."
Johnson said: "I've always
looked up to her and respected
her. When I was talking to her ear
lier this year, it was weird. I felt
like crying. I felt like 'Gosh, I've
just gotten to know you.' She's
helped me a lot."
Tomorrow's race could show
case the different styles that have
taken Meagher and Johnson to
the top. According to Stanford
Coach George Haines, Meagher

has a rather flat stroke, while
Johnson has more hip action and
tends to resemble a dolphin in the
water. Meagher has also done
more over-distance training (her
best event is actually the 200 but
terfly) while Johnson is a pure
sprinter.
"She's really, really strong at the
end of her races," Johnson said
However, there is some doubt
over whether the race will even oc
cur. While Johnson will definitely
swim the 100 butterfly. Cal Coach
Karen Thornton reported that
Meagher has yet to hit her NCAA
cuts in the freestyles and may
compete in those events.
Thornton said she does not plan
to set her lineup until tomorrow
morning, and added. "I think
they'll probably race somewhere. It
may not be the 100 fly if we feel it's
in the best interest of the team."
While both coaches admit that
the team competition between the

No. 8 Bears and No. 2 Cardinal
will probably not be close.
Thornton is nonetheless looking
to have Meagher qualify In more
events for the NCAA meet. The
Bears finished fourth there last
year and have lost only NCAA
champion Conny van Bentum
from that squad.
Thornton pointed to freshman
Lisa Meyers In the individual med
ley and junior breaststroker Amy
Clark as swimmers to watch, but
said. "Really Mary T. is the only
one who . . . can challenge for vic
tory."
Haines, meanwhile, continues
to push his swimmers in prepara
tion for NCAAs, and said. "They'll
be up for Cal. I don't think Cal has
enough depth to beat us, but you
can't take them lightly."
Haines also noted that Aimee
Berzins will try to hit the NCAA
cut in the 200 freestyle as will
Laurie McLean in the 200 IM and

Susannah Miller in the 200 back
stroke.
But the race of the day. should
Thornton decide to swim Meagher
in it. will be the 100 butterfly.
Johnson and Meagher will prob
ably seldom compete against each
other again. The butterflies will be
set free.
Meagher will be free from the
pressure of spending years at the
top as well as countless morning
workouts and millions of yards of
swimming. She will also be free
from the restrictions that kept her
from capitalizing on her three
Olympic gold medals.
"In a lot of ways. I'm really tired
of swimming, and a lot of that
comes from being under NCAA
rules, which are so strict." Meag
her said. "I can't do any type of
promotional work. There have
been opportunities where I've had
to say, 'No, I can't talk to you
about that.' It will be a relief
