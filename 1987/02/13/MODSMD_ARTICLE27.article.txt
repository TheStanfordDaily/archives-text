### ROBERT PORTNOY Staff writer 
If the Stanford men's golf
team wants to return to
Waikiki for next year's John
Burns Invitational, they'll have
to turn it on in today's final
round.
"We have three teams within
five shots of us and we've got a
good shot to pass them. We're
playing with them in the final
round, so we'll know right
where we stand. There's a little
pressure on us because you
have to finish in the top 18 to
get invited back, and naturally
we want to come back," Card
inal sophomore John Mahon
said.
Stanford finds itself in 20th
position at 594 after yester
day's round of 296. The three
teams they will be chasing

Barbara. Hawaii and Utah are
at 589, and Santa Barbara is at
592.
Mahon is the main reason

shots the 298 It shot in Tues

day's opening round. Posting
Stanford's only under-par
round of the tournament,
Mahon fired a one-under-par
69 on the 6,223-yard Olomana
course.
"I had one three-putt on the
front and hit eight of nine
greens. I was one over at the
turn, then bogeyed the 10th,"
Mahon said.
"From there I missed three
out of four greens and made
some pretty good up-and
downs. That got me to the 16th
at two over, and I knocked a few
close on the last three (holes). I
was able to make the putts to
birdie the last three and get un
der par."
The shot of the day for
Mahon came on the 520-yard,
par-five ninth hole, which was
Mahon's 18th because he
started the day by teeing of on
the 10th hole.
"I hit a 240-yard three-wood
about 15-20 feet from the hole
and had a tap-in two-putt for
birdie," Mahon said. His other
two birdies at the 16th and
