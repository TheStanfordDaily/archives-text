# Stanford keeps WSU at bay
## Yanke, Azzi lead women to 73-61 win; Washington up next 
### PABLO MORALES Staff writer 
Last night's game against the
visiting Washington State Cou
gars wasn't exactly a walkover for
the Stanford women's basketball
team.
But fans certainly came away
with a sense that the Cardinal's
73-61 win was a mere formality, a
chance to put behind a nagging
four-game losing streak and to re
establish winning ways, a confi
dence builder with an eye toward
tomorrow's showdown against
Pacific 10 Conference leader
Washington.
"As a team, we never really had
doubts," Stanford Asst. Coach
June Daugherty said. "We knew
that as long as we executed, the
score would take care of Itself."
But Washington State wasn't
about rcl! over for the 12-10
Cardinal.
After Stanford broke quickly to
an 8-0 lead, the Cougars came
scratching back behind the dead
eye shooting of 6-foot-1 sopho
more Jonni Gray. Her baseline
jumper at the eight-minute mark
pulled Washington State to within
one point at 13-12.
Undaunted by the Cougar
surge, Stanford unleashed 6-5 Jill
Yanke to repel Washington State.
The sophomore center came off
the bench and in a two-minute
flurry that included three baskets,
two tough offensive rebounds and
two blocked shots, helped push
the Cardinal to a comfortable 21-
12 advantage.
But Washington State freshman
Linda Clegg helped lead the
Cougars on a scoring barrage of
their own. With Clegg shredding
the nets from long distance,
Washington State was able to take
its first and only lead of the game,
24-23, with 4:40 left in the first
stanza.

But the Cardinal, apparently at
will, extended the lead to a com
fortable margin whenever Wash
ington State thought It might
make the game close.
Again. Yanke gave the Cardinal
the lead with two more timely
buckets, and forward Katy
Stedlng helped extend the advan
tage. 37-32. with two hoops of her
own.
"Jill really pJayed solidly at both
ends of the court." Daugherty
said. "She definitely looked like
she was controlling the middle a
lot better than she has in other
games."
The Cardinal continued to tease
the Cougars for most of the
second half, but with Washington
State tapping on the door again at
46-43 with a little more than 10
minutes left, guard Jennifer Azzi
decided that she had had enough
of this close-score business.
The 5-7 freshman from Oak
ridge, Tenn., led a bombardment
of fast breaks, net-shredders and
fancy assists that, in four
minutes, gave the Cardinal its big
gest lead of the evening, 65-50.
Azzi finished the game with 15
points and 10 assists. Yanke
tossed In a game-high 18 points
and five rebounds to pace the
Cardinal.
Stanford will need another
strong inside attack when it faces
league-leading Washington tomor
row night at Maples Pavilion. The
17th-ranked Huskies boast an ex
tremely quick pressure defense
that dismantled the Cardinal of
fense In January's 27-point
thrashing in Seattle.
Washington owns a 9-1 confer
ence record and a 17-3 overall
mark. The Huskies have won six
consecutive games, including a
73-61 drubbing of USC two weeks
ago.

The Cardinal continued to tease
the Cougars for most of the
second half, but with Washington
State tapping on the door again at
46-43 with a little more than 10
minutes left, guard Jennifer Azzi
decided that she had had enough
of this close-score business.
The 5-7 freshman from Oak
ridge, Tenn., led a bombardment
of fast breaks, net-shredders and
fancy assists that, in four
minutes, gave the Cardinal its big
gest lead of the evening, 65-50.
Azzi finished the game with 15
points and 10 assists. Yanke
tossed In a game-high 18 points
and five rebounds to pace the
Cardinal.
Stanford will need another
strong inside attack when it faces
league-leading Washington tomor
row night at Maples Pavilion. The
17th-ranked Huskies boast an ex
tremely quick pressure defense
that dismantled the Cardinal of
fense In January's 27-point
thrashing in Seattle.
Washington owns a 9-1 confer
ence record and a 17-3 overall
mark. The Huskies have won six
consecutive games, including a
73-61 drubbing of USC two weeks
ago.
