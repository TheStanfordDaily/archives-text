# Card swimmers hoping to solve Calgary mystery
## 
### ERIK ESELIUS Senior staff writer 
Hmmm. Canadian swim
mers? Certainly, at this time of
season — when zambonis,
cross-checks and slap-shots go
free — one would expect most
Canadians to be skating on
water, not traversing through
it. At the very least, they should
be watching the NHL All-Stars
one-up the Russians in their
motherland.
The fact of the matter is.
Canadians swim, regardless of
season. And to punctuate the
point, they swim well, quite
well in fact.
So if anyone snickers when
swimming and the University
of Calgary are linked, sober
them up with cold water. This
Saturday's 1 p.m. meet at
deGuerre Pool against Calary
should prove to be fast and in
teresting.
Coming off the Canadian Na
tionals, the highly touted
Canadian squad will be pretty
much at peak condition, both
well-rested and shaved.
"I don't know what will hap
pen," Junior Anthony Mosse
said, referring to the meet. "I
don't think that they came all
the way to take it easy.
No doubt little time will be
wasted in the pool. Calgary is
led by medley swimmer Rob
Churnoff, butterflier Tom Pon
ting and backstroker Mark
Turksvury. Though Mosse
expects that Calgary will "put
together some pretty good
swims," he has little idea about

Calgary's overall depth. Simply
put. Calgary remains a bit of a
mystery. "It (the meet) should
be interesting." Mosse said.
With the NCAAs closing in,
the Cardinal is gradually shift
ing into a tapering period,
whereby the team focuses more
on rest and eventually qualify
ing more individual swimmers
for the spring NCAAs.
According to Mosse. the meet
will allow those swimmers not
already qualified to take an
other shot at the NCAA stan
dard. Those who have passed
the NCAA barrier will probably
swim off-events, he said.
Just for "interest's sake,"
Mosse will swim the backstroke
as well as his specialty, (ihe 200-
yard butterfly, an event that he
qualified for some two months
Likewise. Pablo Morales, still
called the soul of American
swimming by Sports Illus
trated. plans on participating
in an off-event.
Stanford has a number of
swimmers ready to join the
rapidly expanding Cardinal list
of NCAA qualifiers. One such
swimmer is junior Matt Nance,
who in a fine showing last
weekend against USC and
UCLA narrowly missed qualify
ing in both the 200 backstroke
and 200 individual medley.
Two hundred backstroker
Rickey Gould is also riding the
momentum of a fine weekend
performance. Against the
Trojans, Gould cut two seconds
off his previous best seasonal
time.
