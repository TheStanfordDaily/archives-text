Do fallout shelters really offer
protection from nuclear attack?
This Is the question addressed
by a film that was shown yester
day in Jordan Hall and by a panel
discussion that followed.
About 200 people attended the
screening of "Control," a 90-
minute movie in which actor Burt
Lancaster concluded, "There is no
shelter from the bomb."
"The moment we accept nuclear
shelters we're admitting there's
nothing we can do about nuclear
madness." said Lancaster, who
played an eminent American nu
clear physicist in the film.
A Federal Emergency Manage
ment Agency (FEMA) official chal
lenged this view in the panel dis
cussion.
Fallout shelters can save lives
even in the worst kind of nuclear
attack, said Ronald Sandwina,
west coast regional FEMA chief.
From a technical and engineer
ing standpoint, fallout shelters
are safe, Sandwina said.
The problem with providing

civil defense for nuclear attacks is
the expense, according to
Sandwina. A civil defense pro
gram for the United States wculd
cost <100 billion, he said.
Herbert Abrams, Stanford pro
fessor of diagnostic radiology and
nuclear medicine, presented an
other point of view.
"Fallout shelters, crisis reloca
tion, getting 10 million people out
of New York over the George Wash

ington Bridge" are not the solu
tion, said Abrams, who won the
1985 Nobel Peace Prize for his
work against nuclear weapons.
Instead, he said, nuclear war
must be prevented by convincing
political leaders that not just the
national interest, but "the entire
Northern Hemisphere, is in
volved."
While Abrams said that fallout
shelters could provide protection

against radiation, he warned that
fires could "make any shelter «
potentially an incinerator."
The third speaker, former Dean
of the Chapel Robert Hamerton-
Keliy, said fallout shelters would
upset the "balance of deterrence*"
According to Hamerton-Heliy, ?
civilians in both the United States i
and the Soviet Union must be
equally vulnerable for deterrence
to work.
