Do fallout shelters really offer
protection from nuclear attack?
This Is the question addressed
by a film that was shown yester
day in Jordan Hall and by a panel
discussion that followed.
About 200 people attended the
screening of "Control," a 90-
minute movie in which actor Burt
Lancaster concluded, "There is no
shelter from the bomb."
"The moment we accept nuclear
shelters we're admitting there's
nothing we can do about nuclear
madness." said Lancaster, who
played an eminent American nu
clear physicist in the film.
A Federal Emergency Manage
ment Agency (FEMA) official chal
lenged this view in the panel dis
cussion.
