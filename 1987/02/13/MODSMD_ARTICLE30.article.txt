# U.S., top college squads compete at Hobee's Invite
## 
### MARK SMOYER Staff writer 
They are good — so good that
they are not expected to send a full
team, yet are still expected to win
without difficulty.
They are this year's edition of
the perennially prominent UCLA
Bruins men's gymnastics team,
and they will enter Maples Pavilion
tonight as the nation's No. 1
squad. The Bruins Include four of
the United States' top 15 gym
nasts on their team, among them
top-ranked Curtis Holdsworth.
They also boast Mexican Olym
pian Tony Pineda, whose NCAA
leading all-around score of 57.9
led UCLA to a team score of 282.40
at its own invitational meet last
weekend.
While UCLA is in the middle of
as fine a season as it could ask for,
Stanford can only look at the
Bruins and remember the Card
inal squad of last winter, which
enjoyed the same excellence. Just
as it appeared that Stanford
Coach Sadao Hamada might have
almost had six healthy gymnasts
for competition, another injury
has come along to put sufficient
training and routines on hold for
at least another week.
For the effects of the squad's in
juries, simply refer to the last five
articles on Cardinal men's gym
nastics. Here are the facts: Scott
Schaffer hurt his shoulder last
weekend and will be competing
minimally tonight. Adam For
man's shoulder will keep him out
of yet another meet and perhaps
the rest of the season. Chuck
Gerardo is unable to throw a com
plete high bar routine because of
an Injured wrist. It would be best
simply to consider the positives of
this evening's competition.
It's the Hobee's Invitational, at
7:30. Admission is free to stu
dents with a University I.D. In ad
dition to UCLA, the Cardinal, Cali
fornia, and three other collegiate
squads, a U.S. team will be ex
hibiting Olympic talent — all this

all at once on the floor of Maples.
The U.S. team will include three
of the nation's most famous prac
ticing magicians. 1984 Olympian
Tim Daggett, now training for the
'88 games, has two years of work
under his belt since his multi
medal performance in Los An
geles. Stanford's Jon Louis com
pleted his collegiate career with

the 1986 NCAA individual cham
pionship. He, too, is training
toward the Olympics. Also with
his eyes on Seoul Is former Cal
gymnast Billy Paul, a member of
the U.S. National Team.
"You'll see spectacular routines
thrown by these gymnasts,"
Hamada said. "It's going to be a
good show."
