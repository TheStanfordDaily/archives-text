# Husky indoor track
## Card looks for qualifiers 
### ERIK STEN Editorial staff 
With only two weeks remaining until the start of
the outdoor track season, Stanford Coach Brooks
Johnson will take advantage of a rare opportunity
this weekend — a chance to compete without any
pressure.
Tommorow Johnson and his troops will take
part In the University of Washington Indoor Track
Meet, a preseason event. For most of Stanford's
team the meet is simply an opportunity to com
pete, the exception to that rule being the athletes
who are already in shape enough to qualify for the
NCAA Indoor Championships.
Last week In Louisiana sophomore Patty Pur
pur, cotermlnal student Pam Dukes and fresh
man Peggy Odita all qualified — Purpur and
Dukes in the shotput and Odita in the high jump.
In Seattle distance runner Brian Connolly will be
looking for the right to join his teammates at the
championships.
Connolly won the men's 800 meter last weekend
in a time of 1:49.9, the best time by a U.S. col

legian so far this year. Unfortunately there is no
800 at the Indoor championships, so Connolly's
time didn't qualify him.
This week. In hopes of breaking the national
qualifying standard of 2:23, Connolly will be en
tered In the 1,000. So far this year his training
has been going well, and consequently Connolly
thinks he may be ready to break the standard.
"That's my intention." he said.
The only hitch in Connolly's plans may be the
Huskies' track, which, according to Johnson, is
quite slow. Connolly, however, is not thinking
about that disadvantage. "That may be true
(about the track), but I try not to look at that as a
consideration," he said.
Thirty athletes will be competing for the Card
inal in Seattle, but the squad will still not be at full
strength. Stanford will be without the services of
four athletes who will be in Idaho with Asst.
Coach Dorothy Doolittle, and freshman runners
Erik and Rick Mastilir will be in Texas attempting
to qualify for the National Cross Country Cham
pionships.
