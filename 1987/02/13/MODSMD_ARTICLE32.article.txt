# Stanford sailors to host premier western teams
## 
### HUGH R. BETHELL Editorial staff 
Last spring, the Stanford
sailing team surprised quite a few
observers by placing third at the
Intercollegiate National Team
Racing Championships.
The success was surprising be
cause Cardinal sailors had not
competed in team racing since the
national championships of the
previous year.
This year, the sailing team
hopes to get a little more practice
and do even better at the national
championships. To make sure
that it gets the chance to team
race against other schools, Stan
ford is hosting its own team
racing regatta.

This weekend's event will be the
first major team race regatta,
other than the national qualifiers,
held on the West Coast. Califor
nia, Cal Poly-San Luis Obispo, UC-
Irvine and a number of other top
western sailing schools are ex
pected to compete with Stanford
on Saturday and Sunday at the
Cardinal's home base in Redwood
City.
"It's going to be the major team
racing event of the season, and it
should really help us prepare for
the team racing national quali
fiers coming up in the spring,"
Stanford Coach Blake Middleton
said yesterday.
In team racing, each school
sends a team of three boats
against another school's team for

a set of races. In a regatta such as
the one Stanford will be hosting,
each school races against the
other schools, one by one. The
team with the best win-loss record
at the end of the event wins.
Sailing for Stanford will be
junior Doug Hagen and senior
Kari Skilbred, junior Drew Gash
ler and senior Kristen Boyles,
juniors Dan Buckstaff and Kath
leen Mallery, and senior Tom
Kuhnle and freshman Rita Snape.
Anyone whose interest In
sailing has been sparked by the
America's Cup can catch the ac
tion tomorrow or Sunday after
noon by taking Seaport Boulevard
off Highway 101 to the Stanford
Sailing Center on Redwood Creek.
