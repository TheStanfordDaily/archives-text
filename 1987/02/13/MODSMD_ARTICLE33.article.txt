The start of the 39th Annual
Northern California Intercol
legiate Tennis Championships
Is In danger of being delayed by
rain — for three years.
Last year, for the first time,
the NorCal Intercollegiate was
rained out. Considering the cur
rent weather In the Bay Area. It
appears that a very undesirable
tradition could be beginning to
form Saturday In Berkeley, a
tradition Stanford Coach Dick
Gould does not want to see hap
pen at this time of the season.
"We're a young team," Gould
said, "and we need as many
matches as possible. I hope It's
not rained out; we just need to
play."
Stanford has two of the eight
singles seeds In the tourna
ment. which does not count
toward team standings due to
the NCAA limitation on the
number of matches teams can
play.
Jeff Tarango, 4-0 In 1987, Is
seeded third, while Jeff Cathrall
(3-1) Is listed sixth. Stanford
also will be entering Geordle
McKee, Scott Moody, Barry
Richards and Curtis Dunn.
Woody Hunt of tournament
host California is the top seed,
with Fresno State's Jean
LeClercq (Dunn's opening
round opponent) Is second. Two
more Bears, Brian Flowers and
Ted Scherman, are fourth and

Championships to be held this "weekend in Berkeley.
fifth, with San Jose State s Malcolm Allen and Cal
State-Hayward's Mauriclo Achondo rounding out the
top eight.
"I think that probably the two best players In the
area are not playing singles — Steve DeVries and
Patrick McEnroe," California Coach Steve McKane
said. "They would have been first and second seeds."
California's DeVries, McKane said, has been
playing "absolutely fantastically." This season,
DeVries has been a finalist In the Volvo/ITCA All-
Amerlcan Tennis Championships Tournament in
Los Angeles and In the Rolex Intercollegiate Indoor
Tennis Championships in Richmond, Va.
The Rolex tournament was the last action Stan

ford's McEnroe has seen. After being eliminated in
the first round of that tournament, McEnroe has
missed the Cardinal's last two dual matches while
resting his injured feet.
However, the defending tournament champion in
doubles (with Derrick Rostagno) returns this
weekend to form the top-seeded doubles team with
Moody. DeVries and Scherman are seeded right be
hind them, followed by California's Alex Nizet and
Doug Eisenmann and FSU's LeClercq and Eric
Slegle.
Stanford's other doubles teams will be Tarango
and McKee, a first-time pair, and Cathrall and Eric
Peus.
McKane said that the tournament, scheduled to
run through Tuesday, will be canceled again if It
rains Saturday and Sunday.
"We just have to pray for the rain to stop," McKane
said.
