This weekend the Stanford women's gymnas
tics team will imitate a boomerang, as it travels
south to face top-ranked Utah at No. 6 Fullerton
State tonight, only to head to Seattle tomorrow to
face No. 12 Washington, which defeated the Card
inal two weeks ago at the California Invitational.
"This is a tough weekend for us," Stanford
Coach Homer Sardlna confessed. "The next two
weeks are the toughest in our schedule. Once
they're through, we'll be out of the gate and on our
way."
Tonight's meet at Fullerton will mark the first
time that Stanford has faced the Titans and the
Utes this season. Fullerton State is a perennial
powerhouse In gymnastics, and Utah has been
the NCAA champion for six consecutive years.
"It's going to be a great, great competition," Sar
dina predicted. "I'm looking forward to this meet.
It's going to tell a story. We have to score around
185 in both competitions.
"In the team meeting, the girls said that they
were thinking 180," he said, describing last
week's Cardinal Classic where the squad scored a
181 while the coach had hoped for a 185. "They
need to retool their thinking Into 185, and think
9.3 or 9.4 (per performance) Instead of 9.0."
Sardlna, however, does not want his athletes

overly concerned with scoring. "The girls have to
be concerned with hitting routines," he said.
"We have to score another 46 on vault." Sardlna
continued. "It would be nice If we go 45.5 on bars.
On beam, we have to score a 46. and on floor we
have to Improve dance to get In the 46 range."
The balance beam caused the Cardinal the most
difficulty last week, as the gymnasts recorded five
falls off the apparatus. "We need to live up to our
beam potential." Sardlna replied. "Beam Is tradi
tionally a strong event for us. We have to concen
trate and not let down."
As for the potential effects on the team's win
loss record from the strenuous weekend. Sardlna
Is not concerned. "I'm not too involved with wins
and losses." he said. "We could be 0-11 and still
qualify for regionals." Post-season competition Is
determined by an average of the team's five high
est scores.
The Stanford team competing this weekend is a
talented group of nine. Freshmen Dina Amoroso.
Susan Banta and Becky Ashton will be joined by
sophomores Jinny Rhee, Jessica Armstrong and
co-captaln Cheryl Doo, plus junior co-captain
Alison McGann and seniors Nancl Goldsmith and
Cindy Boyd.
"I have a lot of confidence in this group." Sar
dlna said. "There are two fine people leading them
in the team captains, and a support cast with
great chemistrv.
