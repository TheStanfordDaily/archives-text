Question: What does Arizona
State's athletic budget have to
do with the cancellation of a
Stanford wrestling team road
trip to Fullerton State this
weekend?
Answer: Everything.
The Cardinal wrestlers were
scheduled to go to Fullerton
this weekend for the Southern
California Duals. The teams in
volved in this tournament
would have been Fullerton
State, San Jose State, Caltech,
Cal State-Bakersfield, Stanford
and Arizona State. But Arizona
State's wrestling coach figured
out last night that he overspent
his budget by >10,000, and

that's when the trouble began.
Arizona State's athletic de
partment put a moratorium on
all road trips for the Sun Devil
wrestlers, until the Pacific 10
Conference Tournament In
March.
"I've been trying to get in
touch with Arizona State's
coach all week." Stanford
Coach Chris Horpel said.
Horpel decided not to take
his wrestlers down to the Duals
because he didn't think the
tournament would benefit his
wrestlers without the presence
of Arizona State.
