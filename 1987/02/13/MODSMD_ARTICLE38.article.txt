## 
### CHARLIE GOFEN Senior staff writer 
Roth House residents held a house meeting
last night to discuss security concerns after
the resident assistant there encountered a
naked man on a second-floor hallway yesterday
afternoon.
The resident assistant, senior Tammy
Bryant, said she was leaving her room when
she spotted the naked man in the hall. She
said she asked another resident to dial 911.
and then made the call herself, but said the
man ran into a second-floor bathroom and
then descended the back stairs and exited the
house before police arrived.
Details of the intrusion at the University's
only all-female residence are sketchy. The man
may have showered In the women's second
floor bathroom. Junior Stephanie Gulgou said
she believes that the man used her towel and
left a shower running. But Bryant said that

when she saw the man, he did not appear to
have taken a shower.
Shower or no shower. It appears that the
man left his clothes in the bathroom when he
wandered into the hall, and then dressed when
he returned to the bathroom before going
downstairs.
The house cook, Sam Shamoun, said he saw
a man wearing a black sweater, black pants
and black shoes come down the stairs, briefly
enter the kitchen, and then run out the front
door. Shamoun said that the man, who was
carrying a pair of white underwear, seemed
confused and might have been drunk.
Shamoun said he encountered the man
around 1:30 p.m.
Both Bryant and Shamoun said the man
tried to give the impression that he was visit
ing someone in the house. Bryant said she
heard him say. "Oh. 1 thought you were Jill."
There is no resident by that name in the
house. Shamoun said the man claimed he was

in the house "for an appointment.
Bryant and Shamoun also gave a similar
physleal description of the Intruder, saying he
was a short, stoeky white man with curly,
dark brown hair, who appeared to be In his
early 20s.
Bryant said she did not panic when she en
countered the man. He was not threatening,
but was merely "an exhibitionist." she said.
She said she also saw the man outside,
"heading toward Phi Psi." a short while later.
She confirmed Shamoun's account that the
man was dressed In black and was carrying
white underwear.
Stanford Police Sgt. Philip Love said last
night that there was "evidence of shower use"
in the reported intrusion but noted that all
charges are as yet "unsubstantiated and un
confirmed."
Bryant said last night that Roth residents
are on the lookout for strangers and may
decide to keep their front door locked.
