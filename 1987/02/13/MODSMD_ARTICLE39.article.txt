# VALENTINES 1987
## 
### 
We'H follow forever, thin/thick
Fall from the bars, even a stick
Yogurt in Berkeley is very fine
But leave us and we'M be cry'n
Tops on bars-floor-vault n beam
No better Little League team
Sheri, Aly, Nan and Ginny
We know you re best of the many.
\ Love, Little League Fathers

Edith, together, • • ** /•
We're NP-compiete
We're graph isomorphic, _ \ • *.. •
We form our own clique. \ jj-n..
We're a perfect matching,
Integer programmed for two.
Let's bind our free variables
To be faithful and true.
I'm satisfiabie,
But only with you,
A traveling salesman
Whose circuits are few.
My knapsack I've packed
With dreams that I'll chart
The optimal route
To winning your heart
Be my valentine, David.

GOOD LIKE I NEVER,EVER THOUGHT
I WOULD." THANKS FOR BEING MY
BEST FRIEND AND SO MUCH MORE.

My feelings towards you
I would write a book
Made from words of love

Because you'll be inside
But sH these words can express
A> of my feelings for you
The only words are right
Are the words—l Love You

All the peguins honk-honked from below

So be patient with changing
While or life's rearranging
And keep letting our love of life show.
Oh yeah.. you're the love of my life, don't you

Ode To Ivy Maidens
I wonder through the woods my hear a-pimng,
My soul distraught, my spirit heavy laden.
A star I seek, in whom the Light is shining.
How shall I choose for me an ivy maiden?
The five-two crew doth fill my heart with bliss.
But could I stoop so low to get a kiss?
O alpine twin, I love none more than thee;
Alas, you love your chocolate more than me.
Neglected grads, more lovely than the dawn,
You'll still be here long after I am gone.
O Mary K., no plea nor verse nor sermon
Could wrest for me thy heart from Pee Wee
Herman.
Anita,Bobbi,Laurel, and Georgina,
Elisa, Sharon, Cathy, Katarina,
Plus all the Kims (how many are there now?)
And many more, which time does not allow
Romance-too often but a frantic game-
Pursued and sometimes broken hastily.
More satisified am I that I can claim
The friendship of the maidens of ivy.

Stinky-
You think
You're so sly.
Well. I luv u
more lhan
moo shooz!
Con besos,
