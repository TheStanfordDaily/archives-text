# Ferruolo loses vote on tenure
## In spite of committee support 
### RUSSELL KOROBKIN Editorial staff 
The History Department voted
Wednesday to deny tenure to Asst.
Prof. Stephen Ferruolo despite a
positive recommendation from
the three-member tenure review
committee that evaluated the
case, according to History Prof.
Paul Seaver, who chaired the com
mittee.
A source close to the proceed
ings who asked not to be identi
fied said the vote was "not close"
and Ferruolo was offered "no ex
planation."
Seaver declined to comment on
the details of the vote, but he said
most members of the History De
partment faculty felt the decision
was very difficult to make.
Ferruolo, a medieval history ex
pert, was denied tenure by a His
tory Department vote last Janu
ary. He subsequently appealed the
decision on the grounds that new
criteria for evaluating tenure can
didates had been improperly ap
plied in his case.
Last August, a University griev
ance officer granted Ferruolo a re
evaluation, The process cul
minated with Wednesday's vote.
Seaver confirmed yesterday that
the review committee unani
mously recommended that Fer
ruolo be granted tenure.
The recommendation was based
on 13 letters evaluating Ferruolo's
scholarship that the committee
solicited from experts outside the
University, letters from scholars
within the University with an in
terest in Ferruolo's field of ex

pertise. evidence concerning the
quality of his teaching and careful
readings of his work. Seaver said.
Classics Prof. Susan Treggiari.
who served on the review commit
tee, characterized the letters from
outside scholars as "extremely
positive." Evaluations of Fer
ruolo's teaching ability were al
ways "very positive." Seaver said.
According to Treggiari, all His
tory Department faculty members
had access to the same informa
tion the review committee consid
ered. There was "absolutely no
question in my mind" that Fer
ruolo should be granted tenure,
she said. But, she added, the
solicited letters and Ferruolo's
scholarship could be subject to
different interpretations.
While Treggiari said she
"thought the evidence was enough
to compel us to recommend ten
ure," she said she believes
"everyone made a tremendous ef
fort to look at the whole body of
evidence."
Treggiari admitted that per
sonal relationships "can never be
completely exluded" from these
types of reviews, but said "we all
tried extremely hard to set aside
personal feelings and be as ob
jective as we possibly could be."
Seaver said he was personally
"very sorry the decision turned
out the way that it did."
The department's decision will
now be sent to Dean of Human
ities and Sciences Norman Wes
sells for approval. Wessels told The
Daily Wednesday the decision will
be finalized in four to six weeks.
