# Panel won't disclose speaker possibilities

### ALLISON HARTWELL 
The 1987 Commencement speaker will be an
nounced "In the very near future," but the panel In
volved In the selection process has decided not to dis
close the names of those under consideration In an
effort to avoid the confusion that surrounded last
year's selection, according to a member of the panel.
"The speaker will be named after the invitation has
been extended and accepted." said Marlene Wine,
special assistant to University President Donald Ken
nedy and chair of the Panel to Advise the President
on the Commencement Speaker.
Last year, names of potential speakers were
released before the decision was final. According to
Wine, the publicity surrounding negotiations be
tween the University and the candidates put both
parties in "a difficult position."
Ted Koppel, anchor of ABC's "Nightline," was
named the 1986 Commencement speaker, but only
after actor Bill Cosby declined the invitation when
the University refused to grant him an honorary

degree. Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev was also
invited to speak by a group of seniors, but that effort
failed when Gorbachev canceled plans to visit the
United States in conjunction with arms control
talks.
"There was a lot of misinformation last year," said
Mary Obana, a senior class president and a member
of the advisory panel.
"That is a situation that we'd like to avoid this
year. . . . We are going to secure the information
before making it public," she said.
According to Obana, the advisory panel is com
prised of two undergraduates, two graduate stu
dents, five faculty members and Wine. The panel
submitted a list of potential speakers to Kennedy at
the end of last quarter. Wine said. Because Kennedy
is on leave this quarter, Acting University President
James Rosse has been considering the recommen
dations and will issue the official invitation, she
added.
"There was a lot of give and take, a lot of discussion

about the candidates," Wine said, adding that the
panel tried to get input from "a cross-representation
of the University community."
Recommendations from this year's seniors were
taken from the results of a survey conducted by the
senior class presidents last quarter, Obana said.
The nature of this year's survey differed markedly
from last year's, according to B.G. Porter, another
senior class president and member of the advisory
panel.
"This year's survey was not a popularity referen
dum," Porter said. Instead, those surveyed were
asked "what qualities they looked for most in a
graduation speaker," he said.
Last year the senior class presidents released the
results of their survey, which asked seniors to rank a
list of potential speakers.
According to Porter. " 'Wisdom,' 'inspiration' and
'creativity' were very important" to this year's senior
class. "It was surprising that seniors did not rank
'youth' very high," he said.
