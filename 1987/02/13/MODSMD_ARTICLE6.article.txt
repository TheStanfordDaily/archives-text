# Humanities lacking?
## Profs, say they need resources 
### TRACIE THOMPSON Staff writer 
The recent announcement of
Stanford's ambitious Centennial
fund-raising drive has brought
national media attention to the
University — coverage that
describes Stanford as a top-notch
institution but questions the Uni
versity's academic strength In the
humanities.
An article profiling Stanford in
Sunday's Los Angeles Times
quoted one unnamed English pro
fessor as describing the University
as increasingly becoming "too
'techy' — sort of like the MIT of the
West."
In another profile. The New York
Times on Wednesday referred to
"Stanford Tech'' and compared
the University unfavorably to Har
vard. Princeton and Yale in the
humanities. The Times article
was also notable for a number of
factual errors, including two refer

ences to "Jean" Stanford and one
to Provost "Gene" Rosse.
The criticism of Stanford's com
mitment to the humanities is not
new. The perception of Stanford
as particularly strong in engineer
ing and the sciences has existed
since the Cold War period, if not
before, according to Prof. W. Bliss
Carnochan, head of the Human
ities Center.
But the question is a timely one
for some faculty. They cite the new
and improved science facilities
planned for the Near West
Campus as evidence of the Univer
sity's priorities. Administrators
and other faculty say that the
serious study of the sciences
simply costs more because of the
expensive equipment required.
Carnochan said the humanities
are improving, noting the recent
addition of "extraordinarily dis
tinguished scholars" including
