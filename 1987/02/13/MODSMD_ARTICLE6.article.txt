# Humanities lacking?
## Profs, say they need resources 
### TRACIE THOMPSON Staff writer 
The recent announcement of
Stanford's ambitious Centennial
fund-raising drive has brought
national media attention to the
University — coverage that
describes Stanford as a top-notch
institution but questions the Uni
versity's academic strength In the
humanities.
An article profiling Stanford in
Sunday's Los Angeles Times
quoted one unnamed English pro
fessor as describing the University
as increasingly becoming "too
'techy' — sort of like the MIT of the
West."
In another profile. The New York
Times on Wednesday referred to
"Stanford Tech'' and compared
the University unfavorably to Har
vard. Princeton and Yale in the
humanities. The Times article
was also notable for a number of
factual errors, including two refer

ences to "Jean" Stanford and one
to Provost "Gene" Rosse.
The criticism of Stanford's com
mitment to the humanities is not
new. The perception of Stanford
as particularly strong in engineer
ing and the sciences has existed
since the Cold War period, if not
before, according to Prof. W. Bliss
Carnochan, head of the Human
ities Center.
But the question is a timely one
for some faculty. They cite the new
and improved science facilities
planned for the Near West
Campus as evidence of the Univer
sity's priorities. Administrators
and other faculty say that the
serious study of the sciences
simply costs more because of the
expensive equipment required.
Carnochan said the humanities
are improving, noting the recent
addition of "extraordinarily dis
tinguished scholars" including

Psychology Prof. Philip Zimbardo (left) moderated the panel discussion on nuclear fallout shelters follow
ing the movie "Control." which was shown in his Psychology of Mind Control class. Ronald Sandwina, Dr.
Herbert Abrams and Robert Hamerton-Kelly debated.
Rene Girard, professor of French
and Italian; Joseph Frank, profes
sor of Slavic languages; Philoso
phy Prof. Stuart Hampshire and
English Prof. Stephen Orgel.
But Carnochan noted that Stan
ford's history has been marked by
even more impressive research
and faculty acquisitions in scien
tific and technical areas. He said
he was looking for "more explicit
assurances" that the University in
the future would not neglect the
humanities, especially in plan
ning for the replacement of junior
faculty.
Prof. Edward Courtney, chair
man of the Classics Department,

stated that Stanford is "not giving
the humanities enough priority
and support." He said the Univer
sity needs to hire more faculty in
the humanities.
Courtney also suggested that
the University use some "positive
discrimination" in its admission
process to bring in more students
interested in the humanities.
Bob Hamrdla, special assistant
to University President Donald
Kennedy, said that declining stu
dent interest in the humanities is
not a problem unique to Stanford,
but reflects the career concerns of
young Americans going to college.
Religious Studies Prof. Van Har
vey agreed with The New York
Times characterization of Stan
ford, adding that there are fewer
humanities faculty at Stanford
than at other top schools. But he

also said that Stanford humanists
need to communicate with each
other and develop an "esprit de
corps."
"We're Balkanized as depart
ments right now," Harvey said. He
said that in addition to giving the
the humanities faculty strength in
numbers, regular faculty meet
ings could be used to develop a
more coherent undergraduate
curriculum.
"I don't think we do a very good
job of providing a humanities edu
cation," Harvey said. He argued
that the Western Culture curricu
lum, for example, should be
shaped by those who will teach it,
rather than by the Faculty Senate.
English Prof. Ronald Rebholz
compared Stanford's humanities
programs favorably with those at
other schools, but he said that

"relative to other segments of
Stanford we're still in second
place."
"I think technology and science
still rule Stanford University,"
Rebholz said. He said he also
thought the situation has been
deteriorating.
"The drive for prestige which is
so characteristic of the Kennedy
Administration is pushing us into
further commitments in the sci
entific and technical fields," he
said. He characterized Stanford's
corporate ties, Including patent
rights that are given to companies
that donate to the University, as
"biasing the shape of scientific re
search."
Rebholz said the University
needed to devote more of its
money to increasing humanities
faculty and improving the acces
sibility of its libraries.
