Reagan endorses new health plan
WASHINGTON — After months of internal White House contro
versy. President Reagan yesterday endorsed the "catastrophic"
health-Insurance plan developed by Health and Human Services
Secretary Otis Bowen, saying It would help many senior citizens
avoid "an Intolerable choice — a choice between bankruptcy and
death."
The president's decision was a major victory for the HHS secre
tary, a "country doctor" and former Indiana governor who drafted
the plan after a nine-month study ordered by Reagan. "The Issue
has been smoldering for so long, the need is so great now," Bowen
said afterward in an interview.
Under the plan. Medicare optional coverage would be broadened
to provide 365 days of hospital care annually with patients paying
no more than *2,000 in out-of-pocket expenses for covered hospi
tal and doctor bills. The plan would be financed by an extra
Medicare premium of *4.92 a month.
Bowen's plan already had won strong congressional backers In
both parties since its presentation in November, and it had a good
chance of congressional approval even without Reagan's endorse
ment. Conservatives. Including Attorney General Edwin Meese,
had opposed the plan because of its financing through Medicare.
The coming congressional debate may turn on whether to ac
cept Bowen's plan to finance the new Medicare catastrophic
benefits for the elderly through a new Medicare premium — some
Democrats want to use general revenues — and whether to add
benefits not included in the president's request.
An indication of future fights came yesterday when Rep. Claude
Pepper (D-Fla.) called the bill "timid" and"the step of a dwarf' be
cause it does not address such issues as long-term nursing home
care and home-care aid for persons with Alzheimer's disease.
Drive for reform in campaign law
WASHINGTON — Congressional support for sweeping change
in federal campaign law is at its highest level in a decade largely
because of excessive spending fueled by record donations from
special Interest groups in last year's Senate and House elections,
legislative aides and reform advocates said yesterday.
According to latest estimates, Senate and House candidates
spent more than *340 million on their 1986 campaigns after col
lecting more than *125 million from the political action commit
tees of business, labor and other special interest groups. Those
figures mean that total spending jumped roughly 14 percent, and
PAC contributions about 23 percent, in the two years following
the 1984 elections.
Directly related to the soaring numbers was an unprecedented
wave of negative television advertising and money-chasing by can
didates that turned off many voters last year, reform advocates
charge.
When the 100 th Congress convened last month, newly installed
Senate Majority Leader Robert Byrd (D-W.Va.) made campaign
reform a top priority and threw his weight behind far-reaching
legislation that would limit PAC contributions and provide partial
public funding to candidates who voluntarily adhere to spending
limits.
Byrd protested "the high cost of running for Congress, the ex
cessive time it takes to raise funds and the dangers of undue influ
ence gained by special interests that contribute large sums of
money."
Soviets to publish 'Dr. Zhivago'
MOSCOW — A Soviet editor announced yesterday that he plans
to publish Boris Pasternak's novel "Dr. Zhivago."
The announcement was the latest step in the official rehabilita
tion of Pasternak, a poet and novelist who died in 1960. He fell
into disfavor with Soviet authorities in 1958 when "Dr. Zhivago"
brought him the Nobel Prize for Literature. The book has never
been published in the Soviet Union.
Sergei Zalygin, the new editor-in-chief of Novy Mir, the monthly
literary review, announced that he intends to publish the novel
next year in three or four installments.
Novy Mir was widely known in the 1960s as a pioneering maga
zine that published controversial material. Among other things, it
published articles by Alexander Solzhenitsyn on conditions in
prison camps of the Stalin era.
According to Tass, the Soviet news agency, a commission set up
to preserve Pasternak's literary legacy held its first meeting yester
day to discuss plans for observing the centenary of Pasternak's
birth, in 1890. The commission decided, Tass said, to place
memorial plaques on the building where he was born and on his
dacha (country home) in the village of Peredelkino, outside Mos
cow, where he did most of his writing.
Pressure mounts to deport Nazi
WASHINGTON — A leading group that seeks to trace surviving
Nazi collaborators urged the Reagan administration yesterday to
move swiftly to deport accused war criminal Karl Llnnas to the So
viet Union to face a death sentence handed down in absentia 25
years ago.
Rabbi Marvin Hier, dean of the Los Angeles-based Simon
Wlesenthal Center, told a news conference that his organization
was "frustrated at the slow pace at which the administration is
moving on the Linnas case.
"There is no reason for Karl Linnas to spend an additional day
in freedom in the United States," Hier said, adding that to allow
the 67-year-old retired surveyor from Long Island, N.Y.. permis
sion to do so would be an "insult to democracy."
After six years of civil court proceedings, the U.S. Supreme
Court last month cleared the way for Linnas' deportation to Es
tonia. now part of the Soviet Union, on grounds that he had failed
to disclose his collaboration with the Nazis when he applied to em
igrate to the United States in 1951. The Supreme Court rejected
an earlier petition In December by the narrow margin of 6-3, one
vote short of the number needed to accept a case for review.
According to evidence supplied by the Soviet government, Lin
nas took part in rounding up and murdering Jews in Estonia
during the Nazi occupation and at the age of 21 was appointed
chief of a concentration camp. His family and his lawyer, former
U.S. Attorney General Ramsey Clark, argue that Linnas has never
had a chance to confront his accusers in a jury trial and contend
that there are clear indications that Soviet testimony In the case
was coerced.
EPA approves genetic experiment
WASHINGTON — The Environmental Protection Agency Wed
nesday reapproved a controversial genetic engineering experi
ment to help retard frost formation on strawberries.
The action is one in a series of regulatory victories for the
biotechnology industry, following years of battles In court and
with government agencies over testing of their products.
The test, which involves spraying genetically engineered bac
teria on a small test patch of strawberries, will be carried out by
Advanced Genetic Sciences. Inc. of Oakland. The company has
had its experiments delayed for the past two years by protests,
court actions and EPA disciplinary action in which the company
was found to have violated federal rules by spraying the bacteria
on trees rather than keeping it contained In a laboratory.
The company was required to do new safety tests and to choose
new. more remote sites than those readied for earlier tests. The
three sites now approved are in Northern California, including
two some miles from Holllster in San Benito County and one near
Bryon In Contra Costa County. All the sites are in relatively
remote, unincorporated areas, said an EPA press spokesman.

day to discuss plans for observing the centenary of Pasternak's
birth, in 1890. The commission decided, Tass said, to place
memorial plaques on the building where he was born and on his
dacha (country home) in the village of Peredelkino, outside Mos
cow, where he did most of his writing.
Pressure mounts to deport Nazi
WASHINGTON — A leading group that seeks to trace surviving
Nazi collaborators urged the Reagan administration yesterday to
move swiftly to deport accused war criminal Karl Llnnas to the So
viet Union to face a death sentence handed down in absentia 25
years ago.
Rabbi Marvin Hier, dean of the Los Angeles-based Simon
Wlesenthal Center, told a news conference that his organization
was "frustrated at the slow pace at which the administration is
moving on the Linnas case.
"There is no reason for Karl Linnas to spend an additional day
in freedom in the United States," Hier said, adding that to allow
the 67-year-old retired surveyor from Long Island, N.Y.. permis
sion to do so would be an "insult to democracy."
After six years of civil court proceedings, the U.S. Supreme
Court last month cleared the way for Linnas' deportation to Es
tonia. now part of the Soviet Union, on grounds that he had failed
to disclose his collaboration with the Nazis when he applied to em
igrate to the United States in 1951. The Supreme Court rejected
an earlier petition In December by the narrow margin of 6-3, one
vote short of the number needed to accept a case for review.
According to evidence supplied by the Soviet government, Lin
nas took part in rounding up and murdering Jews in Estonia
during the Nazi occupation and at the age of 21 was appointed
chief of a concentration camp. His family and his lawyer, former
U.S. Attorney General Ramsey Clark, argue that Linnas has never
had a chance to confront his accusers in a jury trial and contend
that there are clear indications that Soviet testimony In the case
was coerced.
EPA approves genetic experiment
WASHINGTON — The Environmental Protection Agency Wed
nesday reapproved a controversial genetic engineering experi
ment to help retard frost formation on strawberries.
The action is one in a series of regulatory victories for the
biotechnology industry, following years of battles In court and
with government agencies over testing of their products.
The test, which involves spraying genetically engineered bac
teria on a small test patch of strawberries, will be carried out by
Advanced Genetic Sciences. Inc. of Oakland. The company has
had its experiments delayed for the past two years by protests,
court actions and EPA disciplinary action in which the company
was found to have violated federal rules by spraying the bacteria
on trees rather than keeping it contained In a laboratory.
The company was required to do new safety tests and to choose
new. more remote sites than those readied for earlier tests. The
three sites now approved are in Northern California, including
two some miles from Holllster in San Benito County and one near
Bryon In Contra Costa County. All the sites are in relatively
remote, unincorporated areas, said an EPA press spokesman.

Reagan endorses new health plan
WASHINGTON — After months of internal White House contro
versy. President Reagan yesterday endorsed the "catastrophic"
health-Insurance plan developed by Health and Human Services
Secretary Otis Bowen, saying It would help many senior citizens
avoid "an Intolerable choice — a choice between bankruptcy and
death."
The president's decision was a major victory for the HHS secre
tary, a "country doctor" and former Indiana governor who drafted
the plan after a nine-month study ordered by Reagan. "The Issue
has been smoldering for so long, the need is so great now," Bowen
said afterward in an interview.
Under the plan. Medicare optional coverage would be broadened
to provide 365 days of hospital care annually with patients paying
no more than *2,000 in out-of-pocket expenses for covered hospi
tal and doctor bills. The plan would be financed by an extra
Medicare premium of *4.92 a month.
Bowen's plan already had won strong congressional backers In
both parties since its presentation in November, and it had a good
chance of congressional approval even without Reagan's endorse
ment. Conservatives. Including Attorney General Edwin Meese,
had opposed the plan because of its financing through Medicare.
The coming congressional debate may turn on whether to ac
cept Bowen's plan to finance the new Medicare catastrophic
benefits for the elderly through a new Medicare premium — some
Democrats want to use general revenues — and whether to add
benefits not included in the president's request.
An indication of future fights came yesterday when Rep. Claude
Pepper (D-Fla.) called the bill "timid" and"the step of a dwarf' be
cause it does not address such issues as long-term nursing home
care and home-care aid for persons with Alzheimer's disease.
Drive for reform in campaign law
WASHINGTON — Congressional support for sweeping change
in federal campaign law is at its highest level in a decade largely
because of excessive spending fueled by record donations from
special Interest groups in last year's Senate and House elections,
legislative aides and reform advocates said yesterday.
According to latest estimates, Senate and House candidates
spent more than *340 million on their 1986 campaigns after col
lecting more than *125 million from the political action commit
tees of business, labor and other special interest groups. Those
figures mean that total spending jumped roughly 14 percent, and
PAC contributions about 23 percent, in the two years following
the 1984 elections.
Directly related to the soaring numbers was an unprecedented
wave of negative television advertising and money-chasing by can
didates that turned off many voters last year, reform advocates
charge.
When the 100 th Congress convened last month, newly installed
Senate Majority Leader Robert Byrd (D-W.Va.) made campaign
reform a top priority and threw his weight behind far-reaching
legislation that would limit PAC contributions and provide partial
public funding to candidates who voluntarily adhere to spending
limits.
Byrd protested "the high cost of running for Congress, the ex
cessive time it takes to raise funds and the dangers of undue influ
ence gained by special interests that contribute large sums of
money."
Soviets to publish 'Dr. Zhivago'
MOSCOW — A Soviet editor announced yesterday that he plans
to publish Boris Pasternak's novel "Dr. Zhivago."
The announcement was the latest step in the official rehabilita
tion of Pasternak, a poet and novelist who died in 1960. He fell
into disfavor with Soviet authorities in 1958 when "Dr. Zhivago"
brought him the Nobel Prize for Literature. The book has never
been published in the Soviet Union.
Sergei Zalygin, the new editor-in-chief of Novy Mir, the monthly
literary review, announced that he intends to publish the novel
next year in three or four installments.
Novy Mir was widely known in the 1960s as a pioneering maga
zine that published controversial material. Among other things, it
published articles by Alexander Solzhenitsyn on conditions in
prison camps of the Stalin era.
According to Tass, the Soviet news agency, a commission set up
