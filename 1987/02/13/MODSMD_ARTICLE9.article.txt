# Speaker says U.S. led city growth
## 
### JOHN POLLACK Senior staff writer 
"Suburbanization represents the greatest
achievement of the United States," according
to an expert on the history of U.S. cities who
spoke here yesterday on the past and future of
metropolitan sprawl in California.
Kenneth Jackson, professor of history and
urban planning at Columbia University, spoke
to a group of about 30 people In a lunchtlme
talk at History Corner.
Jackson compared growth of U.S. cities to
expansion of cities in other countries, saying
that American cities, particularly those in Cali
fornia, are unique in the way in which they
spread out over wide areas.
"When cities were booming, California was
the leader showing a new way to live — the
suburban way of living." he said.
According to Jackson, suburbs developed in
the United States because housing was
relatively inexpensive In those areas. American
housing was a "bargain" In international
terms, he said.
Two factors contributed to this, Jackson
said. First, he said, the abundance of land in
the United States made real estate relatively In
expensive, allowing many Americans to buy
land on which to build. Second, he said, the
abundance of timber and the development of
the balloon-frame house kept construction
costs low.

"We have the wood and we have the method
(of construction)," Jackson said.
These factors made owning a home a real
possibility for many Americans, he said,
noting that as a result home ownership is
twice as common in the United States as it is
in other modern industrial nations, such as
Sweden and West Germany.
The low cost of transportation was also a fac
tor contributing to the development of Ameri
can suburbs. Jackson said. "It has always
been cheaper to go from one place to another"
in this country than elsewhere, said Jackson,
noting that cars and interstate highways
allowed cities to spread without inflicting ap
preciable travel costs on their inhabitants.
But these conditions are changing. Jackson
said. Current land prices are high, especially
in California, and while the price of gasoline is
now low, it is expected to rise again as re
sources are depleted.
Coupled with changes in the lending rates
for home loans, it is becoming more difficult
for Americans to buy homes, he said.
While predicting that suburban growth will
continue in California until the end of this
century, Jackson said there will be a "blurring
between city and suburbs" and that there will
be a "trend back towards congestion."
Jackson is the author of several books, in
cluding his latest. "Crabgrass Frontier: The
Suburbanization of the United States." which
won the Francis Parkman Prize and the
Bancroft Prize.
