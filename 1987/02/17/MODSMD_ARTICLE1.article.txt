Stanford Law Prof. Paul Brest has been named the
10th dean of the Stanford Law School, Acting Uni
versity President James Rosse announced Friday.
Brest, an authority on constitutional law, will
begin serving as dean Sept. 1. He will succeed John
Hart Ely, who has said he is stepping down to con
centrate on his teaching and research.
Brest predicted that the "most exciting challenge
of my deanship" will be to enhance the second- and
third-year curriculum at the Law School, which he
said is "less engaging" for students than the first
year.
"I think there is a consensus that there is a need

Born in Jacksonville, Florida, Brest grew up in
New York City. After graduating from Swarthmore
College and Harvard Law School, he worked for the
NAACP Legal Defense Fund in Jacksonville, Miss.,
from 1966 until 1968. He attributes his Interest In
constitutional law largely to this experience.
After leaving Mississippi, Brest clerked for Assoc.
Justice John Harlan of the U.S. Supreme Court. He
came to Stanford in 1969.

We would try to encourage or induce firms to limit
flybacks to that period," he said. A flyback is an all
expense paid trip to a firm's main office so that a stu
dent can be interviewed more extensively.
Brest also said he wants to make second- and
third-year students more interested in school by
creating "a sense that students are really progress
ing." He said he envisions "something like a major"
in which students would concentrate on a particular
area of law so their third year they would be doing
"quite advanced work."
Students often work for public interest law firms
or forjudges during the summer, and Brest said he
would like to see students pursue courses that are
related to that work.
Brest also noted that he wants the Law School to
maintain its current liberal arts approach so that
