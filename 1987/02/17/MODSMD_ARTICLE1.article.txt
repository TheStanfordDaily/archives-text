# Law School names dean
## 
### MARTHA MOODY Staff writer 
Stanford Law Prof. Paul Brest has been named the
10th dean of the Stanford Law School, Acting Uni
versity President James Rosse announced Friday.
Brest, an authority on constitutional law, will
begin serving as dean Sept. 1. He will succeed John
Hart Ely, who has said he is stepping down to con
centrate on his teaching and research.
Brest predicted that the "most exciting challenge
of my deanship" will be to enhance the second- and
third-year curriculum at the Law School, which he
said is "less engaging" for students than the first
year.
"I think there is a consensus that there is a need
for change," he said.
Born in Jacksonville, Florida, Brest grew up in
New York City. After graduating from Swarthmore
College and Harvard Law School, he worked for the
NAACP Legal Defense Fund in Jacksonville, Miss.,
from 1966 until 1968. He attributes his Interest In
constitutional law largely to this experience.
After leaving Mississippi, Brest clerked for Assoc.
Justice John Harlan of the U.S. Supreme Court. He
came to Stanford in 1969.
One problem he hopes to address, Brest said, is
the "Intrusion of the interviewing process," which
takes students away from their studies during their
second and third years as they look for jobs.
"One thing that has been under consideration is
the possibility of (scheduling) one week during fall
semester when we wouldn't even try to have classes.
We would try to encourage or induce firms to limit
flybacks to that period," he said. A flyback is an all
expense paid trip to a firm's main office so that a stu
dent can be interviewed more extensively.
Brest also said he wants to make second- and
third-year students more interested in school by
creating "a sense that students are really progress
ing." He said he envisions "something like a major"
in which students would concentrate on a particular
area of law so their third year they would be doing
"quite advanced work."
Students often work for public interest law firms
or forjudges during the summer, and Brest said he
would like to see students pursue courses that are
related to that work.
Brest also noted that he wants the Law School to
maintain its current liberal arts approach so that
students will be exposed to all
areas of law, including those they
do not intend to practice. But he
said the current curriculum lacks
a "sense of progression" because
students generally do not concen

trate in a specific area.
Brest said he is particularly in
terested in establishing opportu
nities for students in law and
business, especially the business
of technology development. He
said the study of antitrust laws
and "other regulatory schemes
that can affect technological inno
vation . . . (are some] of the most
intriguing areas" of law.

The new dean said he hopes to
create a program at the Law
School for the study of law and
business. He mentioned that the
Stanford Law School is already in
tegrated with the Stanford
Graduate School of Business be
cause a number of students are
enrolled in both schools through
the JD/MBA joint degree program.
He said he wants to "increase con

tacts between the Law School and
the Business School, the Econom
ics Department and . . . the
graduate program in engineering
economic systems."
Brest said he endorses the
recent shift in admissions policy
in favor of "older students . . .stu
dents who have done something
(since receiving their undergradu
ate degrees.)"
