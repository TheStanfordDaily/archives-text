### LORI SILVER Staff writer 
Asst. Attorney General
William Bradford Reynolds,
head of the Civil Rights Divi
sion of the U.S. Justice Depart
ment. will participate tonight
in a forum entitled "Civil
Rights and the Reagan Admin
istration."
The forum will be held in An
nenberg Auditorium at 7 p.m.
It will be loderated by Justice
Allen Broussard of the Califor
nia Supreme Court, the second
highest ranking black justice
in the United States, and will
include James Steyer. a lec
turer in political science and a
representative of the NAACP Le
gal Defense and Educational
Fund.
Covering the entire civil
rights record of the Reagan ad
ministration , the forum "won't
just be about legal tech

nicalities and abstract cast"
law," Steyer said.
"There have been so many
ways the Reagan administra
tion and the Department of
Justice have set back the civil
rights of blacks, minorities,
women and poor people." he
said.
"No one needs to answer
more to that than Mr.
Reynolds." he said.
Steyer said he expects
Reynolds to counter these accu
sations by saying that Reagan
is really In favor of civil rights
and that Reagan's civil rights
policy has been misun
derstood.
The Reagan administration
wants a "colorblind, race
neutral society." Steyer said.
"It strikes me rather odd that
anyone in 1987 would say that
we live in a colorblind, race
neutral society." he said.
