## THE
						STANFORD DAILY An Independent Newspaper Respect decision 
### 
Last Wednesday capped a long, puzzling
and — for Asst. History Prof. Stephen Fer
ruolo — painful tenure evaluation process.
While the particulars of this case seem hard
to understand, the process itself remains
valid and fair.
The facts of this case seem confusing. In
January 1986, the History Department voted
to deny Ferruolo tenure. After questions were
raised about the proper application of new
tenure guidelines in his case, Ferruolo filed a
grievance last August and was granted a
rehearing. On Wednesday, he was denied
tenure for the second time.
Ferruolo is a popular teacher; in the first
tenure vote last year, his teaching was hailed
as "fantastic, above question." The quality of
his scholarship was called "very consider
able." And last week, the committee review
ing Ferruolo's case unanimously recom
mended that he be granted tenure. Letters
solicited from outside scholars were uni
formly glowing. Indeed, one member of the
review committee said there was "absolutely
no question" that Ferruolo should have been
granted tenure.
Given all this, why was Ferruolo denied
tenure? Only his colleagues in the History
Department know for certain. This is as it

should be. The confidentiality of the tenure
review process, frustrating as it may be, is
more important than the career of any single
professor.
Opening up the review process to public
scrutiny would only serve to exacerbate an
already delicate situation. What's more, it's
doubtful that going public with complaints
about the process — or the specifics of a par
ticular case — would significantly change the
outcome of tenure voting. It's more likely
that such a public airing of the University's
confidential tenure process would result in
an unfortunate battle that would credit nei
ther the University nor the professor in ques
tion.
Universities such as Stanford use tenure
to attract and keep the best professors. Al
though knowing the specifics of certain
cases would be interesting, it would serve no
real purpose and would set an unhealthy pre
cedent.
The History Department's decision may be
baffling, but it must also be respected. Fer
ruolo's own colleagues are better judges of
his qualifications for a tenured position than
anyone else. Stephen Ferruolo will have to
take his considerable talents as a scholar and
as a teacher elsewhere; this case is closed.
