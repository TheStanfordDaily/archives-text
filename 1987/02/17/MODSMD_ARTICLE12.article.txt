Madonna to play at Stanford?
Nope. Not anytime soon, at least.
Last quarter, students at UC-Santa Barbara
enjoyed the concerts of Simple Minds and
Cyndi Lauper. At UC-Davis they also saw Cyndi
Lauper, along with the likes of Pat Benetar and
Oingo Boingo. San Jose State, right down the
road, had Berlin and X not too long ago. We sat
on our thumbs here at Stanford.
I think its time we faced up to the facts. The
closest we're going to get to Madonna is Dr.
Ruth. Somehow it's not the same.

Why don't we have rock concerts like other
universities? Two words — Concert Network.
And this spring, they'll be up for a $39,000 fee
assessment. I think it's time we evaluate the
situation.
First a little history. The Concert Network
charter was written about three years ago. Be
cause of it, University President Donald Ken
nedy lifted a two-year-old moratorium on con
certs, during which not so much as an electric
guitar was heard on the Farm. The intention
was to form an organization that would quell
the University's fear that students would lose
money, while at the same time produce con
certs. The Stanford Administration had good
reason to fear taking a bath in the concert
promotion industry, since the Stanford con
cert agencies in the past had put on great con
certs (like Tom Petty and Pat Benatar), but lost
big bucks — $ 100.000 in fact.
The new concert organization was well in
tentioned, to be sure, but something went
wrong. Here were the problems in a nutshell:
□ The Concert Network's relationship wii.i
Bill Graham — the Bay Area concert promoter
— deteriorated. This was partly due to mis
management and partly due to the fact that
Bill Graham simply doesn't need Stanford. He
has the new Shoreline Ampitheater in Moun
tain View.

□ The Concert Network didn't have the funds
to produce a large concert without someone
like Graham. They started with a $50,000 to
$60,000 fee assessment from the ASSU and
also had investors like the Black Student Un
ion, the Band and the Chaparral buy shares of
the organization. But that kind of money isn't
enough to make it in the major concert pro
duction biz. A show with Tom Petty and the
Heartbreakers in Frost Ampitheater would
cost roughly $30,000 to $40,000.
□ While the Concert Network scratched its
head trying to figure out how to get around
these difficulties, what resources they had
were slowly being drained. Staff member
salaries totalled a few thousand a year, and the
salary of the special Concert Network adviser
(one of the innovations of the new charter) was
a whopping $12,000 or so per year for part
time work. Add to this the Red Hot Chili Pep
per fiasco, a phone bill, recruitment costs, you
name it, and that $60,000 didn't go very far.
The present reserve is about $30,000.
So where does that leave us students? This
year the Concert Network has given us a few
comedy shows (where, incidentally, the Palo
Altans outnumbered the students by an enor
mous margin). One of these concerts was
scheduled for the beginning of Dead Week.
Ticket prices were also on the high side. And
on Feb. 19, some jazz dude named David Gris
man will be rocking 'ol Dinkelspiel
Auditorium. Also, on April 9 (remember, you
heard it here first) jazz guitarist Stanley Jor
dan will be playing the Farm.
All kidding aside, Grisman and Jordan are
noted jazz artists. Jazz is nice, and deserves its
place on campus, but there's good reason why
the Concert Network should be doing things
other than jazz and comedy: Both forms of en
tertainment have been handled by other or
ganizations. Comedy is being done by STARTS
(Student Arts at Stanford) and has been organ
ized by other student groups, and Lively Arts
and STARTS both do, and have done jazz.
When the Concert Network recently muscled
into these areas it was more concerned with
keeping the organization afloat than with ful
filling student entertainment needs. I happen
to think the bottom line of any student group
should be serving the needs of the students.
Call me a crazy, teary-eyed idealist.

What should the Concert Network be doing?
Well, my taste is rock 'n' roll. That's right —
rock 'n' roll! My idea of a concert is Billy Idol, or
Madonna or Billy "He Doesn't Deserve Christy"
Joel or Oingo Boingo. I, like many of you,
picture a sweaty crush of bodies inching
toward a far-off stage when I hear the word
"concert." This Grisman thing just doesn't
seem like that type of event. Other people I've
talked to want to see some L.A. bands or new
wave groups here. Heavy metal, country west
ern, reggae, you name it — these are the forms
of music that are missing here at Stanford.
These are the types of shows the Concert Net
work should be putting on.
While it's pretty obvious that a big rock con
cert won't be happening here unless Bill
Graham suddenly has a change of heart,
Shoreline burns down or the Concert Network
wins the California Lottery, what could the
Concert Network be doing to meet some of
these unsatisfied student musical needs?
Can't we have small-name rock concerts in
Frost or on Wilbur Field with groups like the
Tubes, Lone Justice, Beat Rodeo or the Violent
Femmes?
Nope. That won't happen either, and this is
my biggest problem with shoveling another
$40,000 into the organization. You see, the
Concert Network was set up with the wrong
philosophy. It's supposed to make money — to
be self-supporting. It's an organization sepa
rate from the ASSU. It's not a service project
like the Speakers Bureau or a business project
like the Sunday Flicks.The fact that they can't
afford to lose money castrates them as a
concert-producing organization. They have a
limited range of shows they can put on in a
limited number of venues.
What can we do if we want shows that are
different from the ones we're getting this year?
Shake things up a bit is my answer. Break the
mold of the Concert Network, restructure it
based on what we've learned and can learn
from experience and other universities, and
loosen our purse strings. We shouldn't kid our
selves. It's going to take money to do it right.
But let's not spend that money until we've
had a chance to revise the Concert Network.

ern, reggae, you name it — these are the forms
of music that are missing here at Stanford.
These are the types of shows the Concert Net
work should be putting on.
While it's pretty obvious that a big rock con
cert won't be happening here unless Bill
Graham suddenly has a change of heart,
Shoreline burns down or the Concert Network
wins the California Lottery, what could the
Concert Network be doing to meet some of
these unsatisfied student musical needs?
Can't we have small-name rock concerts in
Frost or on Wilbur Field with groups like the
Tubes, Lone Justice, Beat Rodeo or the Violent
Femmes?
Nope. That won't happen either, and this is
my biggest problem with shoveling another
$40,000 into the organization. You see, the
Concert Network was set up with the wrong
philosophy. It's supposed to make money — to
be self-supporting. It's an organization sepa
rate from the ASSU. It's not a service project
like the Speakers Bureau or a business project
like the Sunday Flicks.The fact that they can't
afford to lose money castrates them as a
concert-producing organization. They have a
limited range of shows they can put on in a
limited number of venues.
What can we do if we want shows that are
different from the ones we're getting this year?
Shake things up a bit is my answer. Break the
mold of the Concert Network, restructure it
based on what we've learned and can learn
from experience and other universities, and
loosen our purse strings. We shouldn't kid our
selves. It's going to take money to do it right.
But let's not spend that money until we've
had a chance to revise the Concert Network.

Madonna to play at Stanford?
Nope. Not anytime soon, at least.
Last quarter, students at UC-Santa Barbara
enjoyed the concerts of Simple Minds and
Cyndi Lauper. At UC-Davis they also saw Cyndi
Lauper, along with the likes of Pat Benetar and
Oingo Boingo. San Jose State, right down the
road, had Berlin and X not too long ago. We sat
on our thumbs here at Stanford.
I think its time we faced up to the facts. The
closest we're going to get to Madonna is Dr.
Ruth. Somehow it's not the same.

Why don't we have rock concerts like other
universities? Two words — Concert Network.
And this spring, they'll be up for a $39,000 fee
assessment. I think it's time we evaluate the
situation.
First a little history. The Concert Network
charter was written about three years ago. Be
cause of it, University President Donald Ken
nedy lifted a two-year-old moratorium on con
certs, during which not so much as an electric
guitar was heard on the Farm. The intention
was to form an organization that would quell
the University's fear that students would lose
money, while at the same time produce con
certs. The Stanford Administration had good
reason to fear taking a bath in the concert
promotion industry, since the Stanford con
cert agencies in the past had put on great con
certs (like Tom Petty and Pat Benatar), but lost
big bucks — $ 100.000 in fact.
The new concert organization was well in
tentioned, to be sure, but something went
wrong. Here were the problems in a nutshell:
□ The Concert Network's relationship wii.i
Bill Graham — the Bay Area concert promoter
— deteriorated. This was partly due to mis
management and partly due to the fact that
Bill Graham simply doesn't need Stanford. He
has the new Shoreline Ampitheater in Moun
tain View.

□ The Concert Network didn't have the funds
to produce a large concert without someone
like Graham. They started with a $50,000 to
$60,000 fee assessment from the ASSU and
also had investors like the Black Student Un
ion, the Band and the Chaparral buy shares of
the organization. But that kind of money isn't
enough to make it in the major concert pro
duction biz. A show with Tom Petty and the
Heartbreakers in Frost Ampitheater would
cost roughly $30,000 to $40,000.
□ While the Concert Network scratched its
head trying to figure out how to get around
these difficulties, what resources they had
were slowly being drained. Staff member
salaries totalled a few thousand a year, and the
salary of the special Concert Network adviser
(one of the innovations of the new charter) was
a whopping $12,000 or so per year for part
time work. Add to this the Red Hot Chili Pep
per fiasco, a phone bill, recruitment costs, you
name it, and that $60,000 didn't go very far.
The present reserve is about $30,000.
So where does that leave us students? This
year the Concert Network has given us a few
comedy shows (where, incidentally, the Palo
Altans outnumbered the students by an enor
mous margin). One of these concerts was
scheduled for the beginning of Dead Week.
Ticket prices were also on the high side. And
on Feb. 19, some jazz dude named David Gris
man will be rocking 'ol Dinkelspiel
Auditorium. Also, on April 9 (remember, you
heard it here first) jazz guitarist Stanley Jor
dan will be playing the Farm.
All kidding aside, Grisman and Jordan are
noted jazz artists. Jazz is nice, and deserves its
place on campus, but there's good reason why
the Concert Network should be doing things
other than jazz and comedy: Both forms of en
tertainment have been handled by other or
ganizations. Comedy is being done by STARTS
(Student Arts at Stanford) and has been organ
ized by other student groups, and Lively Arts
and STARTS both do, and have done jazz.
When the Concert Network recently muscled
into these areas it was more concerned with
keeping the organization afloat than with ful
filling student entertainment needs. I happen
to think the bottom line of any student group
should be serving the needs of the students.
Call me a crazy, teary-eyed idealist.

What should the Concert Network be doing?
Well, my taste is rock 'n' roll. That's right —
rock 'n' roll! My idea of a concert is Billy Idol, or
Madonna or Billy "He Doesn't Deserve Christy"
Joel or Oingo Boingo. I, like many of you,
picture a sweaty crush of bodies inching
toward a far-off stage when I hear the word
"concert." This Grisman thing just doesn't
seem like that type of event. Other people I've
talked to want to see some L.A. bands or new
wave groups here. Heavy metal, country west
ern, reggae, you name it — these are the forms
of music that are missing here at Stanford.
These are the types of shows the Concert Net
