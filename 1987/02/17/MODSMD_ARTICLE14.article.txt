# Islam innocent

### 
It is sad to see average
Americans in the media these
days calling for putting the Mos
lems in this country in detention
camps with the minimum means
of survival.
I don't really blame the average
American for having that kind of
feeling when I look at the way Is
lam is covered by the media — es
pecially concerning the issue of
terrorism. Many words like
"terrorist," "hijacker" and
"kidnapper" have been used as
synonyms for the word "Moslem."
Whenever someone from any
country commits a crime, he is
referred to by his name and
sometimes his nationality.
However, when the person turns
out to be a Moslem, the word
"moslem" always precedes his
name in the media — even if he
was from the Druze, who are not
Moslems and do not like to be
referred to as such.

The man who was accused of
putting a bomb in his girlfriend's
purse was talked about as if he
were the sole representative of Is
lam. That particular case is inter
esting because of the strong viola
tions of Islam made by the per
petrator. First, a Moslem man
cannot have a girlfriend in the col
loquial sense, let alone be guilty of
the crime of impregnating her. An
impregnation would be adultery,
which is prohibited in Islam.
Worse than this crime was the at
tempt to kill the innocents on the
plane.
Not only in peace but also in
war, Islam prohibits terrorism,
kidnapping and hijacking when
carried out against civilians.
Whoever commits these crimes is
a murderer in Islam and is to be
punished by the Islamic state.
During wars, Islam prohibits Mos
lem soldiers from harming
civilians, women, children, elderly
and religious men such as priests
and rabbis. It also prohibits cut
ting down trees and destroying ci
vilian constructions.
Many Islamic terms like "Jihad"
and "Islam" have been abused by
violents. Nobody has a power over
these groups to force them to stop
abusing such names. This could
happen to Christianity as well if a
Mafia group called itself "The
Christian Crusade Group." for ex

ample. In that case, we wouldn't
consider it as a representative of
Christianity, just as we don't con
sider Adolf Hitler the ideal of Ger
mans. When Moslems want to
learn about Christian beliefs, they
read the Bible, and hope that the
Christians will go and read the
Quran and the Hadith
(Muhammad's traditions), since
only these represent Islam.
Christians are 5 to 7 percent of
the population of countries like
Jordan, Syria and Egypt, and
have been living there peacefully
for over 1400 years. Nobody put
them In detention camps when
70,000 Moslems were massacred
in Jerusalem during the
Crusades, which took place in
those particular areas, nor were
they harmed during the massacre
of the Moslems and the Jews in
Spain in 1492. It is against Is
lamic laws to punish those for
crimes committed by others —
people who were violating their
own Christian faith, which has
love as its main teaching.
The most misinterpreted term
by the media is "Jihad," which
refers to the Holy War. Jihad is not
only a defensive war, as some Mos
lems try ignorantly to defend it. It
is also an offensive war against
any unjust regime that does not
let its citizens chose their faith. If
such a regime exists, then the war
is carried against that regime and
not against the people of that
country. It should never be inter
preted as a way of forcing specific
beliefs on others, since there is an
explicit verse in the Qur'an that
says, "There is no compulsion in
religion." Had this not been the
case, there would have never been
any Christian, Jew or non-Moslem
in the Islamic world during the
past 1400 years.
Concerning the case of
Lebanon, that country became
like a pot with too many fingers
dipped in it. Nothing is stable over
there and not many people are fol
lowing the teachings of their
faiths. There are crimes in
Lebanon that are committed un
der the names of all religions and
not only Islam. Sabra and Shattela
are not that far away. Everybody is
fighting everyone else and there is
lot of overlapping between the
groups' interests. So, I don't think
it is fair to judge Islam from what
has been done in Lebanon, nor is
it fair to judge Christianity or
Judaism from what we have seen
there either.

religion." Had this not been the
case, there would have never been
any Christian, Jew or non-Moslem
in the Islamic world during the
past 1400 years.
Concerning the case of
Lebanon, that country became
like a pot with too many fingers
dipped in it. Nothing is stable over
there and not many people are fol
lowing the teachings of their
faiths. There are crimes in
Lebanon that are committed un
der the names of all religions and
not only Islam. Sabra and Shattela
are not that far away. Everybody is
fighting everyone else and there is
lot of overlapping between the
groups' interests. So, I don't think
it is fair to judge Islam from what
has been done in Lebanon, nor is
it fair to judge Christianity or
Judaism from what we have seen
there either.

It is sad to see average
Americans in the media these
days calling for putting the Mos
lems in this country in detention
camps with the minimum means
of survival.
I don't really blame the average
American for having that kind of
feeling when I look at the way Is
lam is covered by the media — es
pecially concerning the issue of
terrorism. Many words like
"terrorist," "hijacker" and
"kidnapper" have been used as
synonyms for the word "Moslem."
Whenever someone from any
country commits a crime, he is
referred to by his name and
sometimes his nationality.
However, when the person turns
out to be a Moslem, the word
"moslem" always precedes his
name in the media — even if he
was from the Druze, who are not
Moslems and do not like to be
referred to as such.

The man who was accused of
putting a bomb in his girlfriend's
purse was talked about as if he
were the sole representative of Is
lam. That particular case is inter
esting because of the strong viola
tions of Islam made by the per
petrator. First, a Moslem man
cannot have a girlfriend in the col
loquial sense, let alone be guilty of
the crime of impregnating her. An
impregnation would be adultery,
which is prohibited in Islam.
Worse than this crime was the at
tempt to kill the innocents on the
plane.
Not only in peace but also in
war, Islam prohibits terrorism,
kidnapping and hijacking when
carried out against civilians.
Whoever commits these crimes is
a murderer in Islam and is to be
punished by the Islamic state.
During wars, Islam prohibits Mos
lem soldiers from harming
civilians, women, children, elderly
and religious men such as priests
and rabbis. It also prohibits cut
ting down trees and destroying ci
vilian constructions.
Many Islamic terms like "Jihad"
and "Islam" have been abused by
violents. Nobody has a power over
these groups to force them to stop
abusing such names. This could
happen to Christianity as well if a
Mafia group called itself "The
Christian Crusade Group." for ex

ample. In that case, we wouldn't
consider it as a representative of
Christianity, just as we don't con
sider Adolf Hitler the ideal of Ger
mans. When Moslems want to
learn about Christian beliefs, they
read the Bible, and hope that the
Christians will go and read the
Quran and the Hadith
(Muhammad's traditions), since
only these represent Islam.
Christians are 5 to 7 percent of
the population of countries like
Jordan, Syria and Egypt, and
have been living there peacefully
for over 1400 years. Nobody put
them In detention camps when
70,000 Moslems were massacred
in Jerusalem during the
Crusades, which took place in
those particular areas, nor were
they harmed during the massacre
of the Moslems and the Jews in
Spain in 1492. It is against Is
lamic laws to punish those for
crimes committed by others —
people who were violating their
own Christian faith, which has
love as its main teaching.
The most misinterpreted term
by the media is "Jihad," which
refers to the Holy War. Jihad is not
only a defensive war, as some Mos
lems try ignorantly to defend it. It
is also an offensive war against
any unjust regime that does not
let its citizens chose their faith. If
such a regime exists, then the war
is carried against that regime and
not against the people of that
country. It should never be inter
preted as a way of forcing specific
beliefs on others, since there is an
explicit verse in the Qur'an that
says, "There is no compulsion in
religion." Had this not been the
case, there would have never been
any Christian, Jew or non-Moslem
in the Islamic world during the
past 1400 years.
