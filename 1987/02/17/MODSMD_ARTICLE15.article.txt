The name
of the game
is Sexploration
Philip Roth once complained
about the paucity of a writer's
imagination in the face of the
realities of the modern world.
Recently, paintings by DeKooning
and Jasper Johns brought prices
in the millions, Tim Raines of the
Montreal Expos termed an offer of
even more millions to play
baseball as "insulting" and stu
dents at an ostensibly reputable
university held a referendum on
the rather redundant question of
whether to stockpile cyanide
tablets for use in the event of a
nuclear attack. Satiric efforts by
writers seem amateurish in com
parison. The usefuless of Roth's
observation was illustrated locally
with the announcement that
Residential Education has
created (and. indeed, copyrighted
in the name of Stanford) a board
game about sex.
"Sexploration" (their name, not
mine) has been designed to teach
some of the most gifted students
in the country about sex by
moving tokens around a board
and amassing little blue chips as
symbols of progress. One begins

the game by choosing one of
several paths upon which to move
titled "Drugs and Alcohol,"
"Contraceptives." "Pregnancy."
"Abortion," "Relationships" and
(the biggie) "Sexually Transmit
ted Diseases." Whether these
categories offer a choice anyone
would care to make is uncertain.
There is also a bit of role-playing,
although not anything as im
aginative as can be found in any
local night club on a weekend.
Finally, players answer trivia
questions and are awarded blue
chips to encourage talk about
sexual issues. Having spent a few
years living in University dorms, I
haven't noticed a complete silence
on the topic of sex, despite the
inability to earn such valuable
rewards.
In fact, if the folks at Res Ed are
serious about making the game a
hit. they ought to consider offer
ing prizes to those fortunate
enough to amass a given number
of chips. The following could be
awarded:
□ First prize (3000 or more
chips): The collected works of Dr.
Ruth Westheimer, purged of
course of her illiberal notions on
date rape.
□ Second prize (1000 or more
chips): A 5 percent discount on
your favorite contraceptive.
□ Third prize (500 or more
chips): A date with a fellow

"Sexploration" player from USC.
If this didn't work, the game
could be revised to include an
element of danger ("Take a walk
on the boardwalk, if you pass go
contract the sexually transmitted
disease of your choice," or "Make
a move en passant, and be cited
for sexual harassment.")
When students are regularly
exploring the subtleties of Milton
and ordinary differential equa
tions. a board game about sex
tends toward the banal. While the
informal curriculum of a univer
sity is an important or even vital
part of the time one spends in
college, it is not improved by
innovations like games about sex.
Alas, in comparison to more
primitive means of learning about
sex. this game seems as exciting
as a study of electric power
delivery in northwestern Sas
katchewan. There are better ways
to spend one's time.

Give tenure to
young faculty
It is tragic that the History
Department didn't wait three
more months to denv Asst. His-

Tory Prof. Stephen Ferruolo ten
ure; the full-blown pageantry of
the Centennial celebrations
would have provided an appropri
ately ironic backdrop for the ten
ure debate. One of the greatest
universities is in the midst of
reflecting upon its accomplish
ments and promulgating a vision
for the future — one marked with
academic and scholastic excel
lence — yet the leaders of Stan
ford. in one myopic sweep, have
lost a zealous contributor to this
vision.
The denial of Ferruolo's tenure
points to a greater worry: The
future of the humanities and
sciences at Stanford. A recent
article in the Los Angeles Times
(Feb. 8) highlighted the atrophied
condition of the liberal arts at
Stanford; Norman Wessells, dean
of Humanities and Sciences, told
the Times that "there just aren't
enough young faces (teaching) in
the classroom.'' James Sheehan,
chairman of the History Depart
ment. characterized this lack of
young faculty as "lamentable."
If Ferruolo is the example of
how Stanford treats its young
faculty. Dean Wessells should
worry. But he shouldn't ponder
the lack of young faces — the
answer Is all too obvious.

lence — yet the leaders of Stan
ford. in one myopic sweep, have
lost a zealous contributor to this
vision.
The denial of Ferruolo's tenure
points to a greater worry: The
future of the humanities and
sciences at Stanford. A recent
article in the Los Angeles Times
(Feb. 8) highlighted the atrophied
condition of the liberal arts at
Stanford; Norman Wessells, dean
of Humanities and Sciences, told
the Times that "there just aren't
enough young faces (teaching) in
the classroom.'' James Sheehan,
chairman of the History Depart
ment. characterized this lack of
young faculty as "lamentable."
If Ferruolo is the example of
how Stanford treats its young
faculty. Dean Wessells should
worry. But he shouldn't ponder
the lack of young faces — the
answer Is all too obvious.

The name
of the game
is Sexploration
Philip Roth once complained
about the paucity of a writer's
imagination in the face of the
realities of the modern world.
Recently, paintings by DeKooning
and Jasper Johns brought prices
in the millions, Tim Raines of the
Montreal Expos termed an offer of
even more millions to play
baseball as "insulting" and stu
dents at an ostensibly reputable
university held a referendum on
the rather redundant question of
whether to stockpile cyanide
tablets for use in the event of a
nuclear attack. Satiric efforts by
writers seem amateurish in com
parison. The usefuless of Roth's
observation was illustrated locally
with the announcement that
Residential Education has
created (and. indeed, copyrighted
in the name of Stanford) a board
game about sex.
"Sexploration" (their name, not
mine) has been designed to teach
some of the most gifted students
in the country about sex by
moving tokens around a board
and amassing little blue chips as
symbols of progress. One begins

the game by choosing one of
several paths upon which to move
titled "Drugs and Alcohol,"
"Contraceptives." "Pregnancy."
"Abortion," "Relationships" and
(the biggie) "Sexually Transmit
ted Diseases." Whether these
categories offer a choice anyone
would care to make is uncertain.
There is also a bit of role-playing,
although not anything as im
aginative as can be found in any
local night club on a weekend.
Finally, players answer trivia
questions and are awarded blue
chips to encourage talk about
sexual issues. Having spent a few
years living in University dorms, I
haven't noticed a complete silence
on the topic of sex, despite the
inability to earn such valuable
rewards.
In fact, if the folks at Res Ed are
serious about making the game a
hit. they ought to consider offer
ing prizes to those fortunate
enough to amass a given number
of chips. The following could be
awarded:
□ First prize (3000 or more
chips): The collected works of Dr.
Ruth Westheimer, purged of
course of her illiberal notions on
date rape.
□ Second prize (1000 or more
chips): A 5 percent discount on
your favorite contraceptive.
□ Third prize (500 or more
chips): A date with a fellow

"Sexploration" player from USC.
If this didn't work, the game
could be revised to include an
element of danger ("Take a walk
on the boardwalk, if you pass go
contract the sexually transmitted
disease of your choice," or "Make
a move en passant, and be cited
for sexual harassment.")
When students are regularly
exploring the subtleties of Milton
and ordinary differential equa
tions. a board game about sex
tends toward the banal. While the
informal curriculum of a univer
sity is an important or even vital
part of the time one spends in
college, it is not improved by
innovations like games about sex.
Alas, in comparison to more
primitive means of learning about
sex. this game seems as exciting
as a study of electric power
delivery in northwestern Sas
katchewan. There are better ways
to spend one's time.
