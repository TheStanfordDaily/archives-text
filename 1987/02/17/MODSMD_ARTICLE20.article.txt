## Bug sheds light on cardinal color 
### KATHRYN VER PLOEG Staff writer 
Dear Bug Me:
We are the Stanford Cardinal
but are our colors red and white
or cardinal and white? And ex
actly what color is cardinal? The
Bookstore doesn't ,eem to know,
since it has all shades of red.
- Colorblind senior
For simple starters, the 1987
World Almanac lists Stanford's
school colors as both cardinal and
white. Cardinal's exact shade gets
a bit more complex. Although no
one knew where It Is officially re
corded. it seems that everyone
knows what shade it really is.
According to an employee in the
Bookstore's clothing department,
"Cardinal is like a maroon, not red
at all. . . . It's just that red's
evolved into the unofficial school
color, because it's easier to find
red clothes."
Hanging in the corner of the
room that houses the University
archives is a blood red square of
cloth with these words: "Original
Stanford colors: This red silk
handkerchief was waved at the

various Stanford student body
meetings in the fall of 1891. when
the selection of an official color for
the new University was under dis
cussion."
According to a 1892 edition of
the Sequoia, a rally was once held
in San Francisco and "all day the
lurid hue flourished in profusion.
Anything went, so it was red."
"A Son of a Gambolier"' an early
1900s standby, opens with, "We'll
cheer for dear old Stanford, where
the color of life is red."
In the Pacific 10 Conference,
Arizona State wears maroon and
gold, while USC's jerseys are card
inal and gold, yet both wear uni
forms of the same maroon shade.
The academic robes for doctoral

students contain a vivid shade of
red.
A worker in the Art Library
claims that "the color cardinal is
bright red. no doubt."
The dictionary defines the color
as "bright-red, like the robe of a
cardinal."
An official in the Athletic De
partment says that "it's a separate
color between maroon and red . . .
but we often have to go with
whatever color the uniform sup
pliers have," which helps to ex
plain why some teams sport
maroon, while others sport red.
And "A Field Guide to the Birds"
says that "the female cardinal is a
yellowish brown."
So now you know too. Pick your
personal favorite.
Dear Bug Me:
Last night, I was listening to
KZSU and the disc Jockey said
the station name had been
changed to "KZSU - The Call of
the Wighat." What is a wighat,
and why is it calling?
- Mad Hatter
I spoke with senior Leif Wenar,
the self-appointed force behind

KZSU's new image and host of the
"Radio Free Wighat" show
Thursday nights on KZSU. Wenar
confirmed that the station's name
has indeed been changed to "The
Call of the Wighat" in an effort to
reflect Stanford radio's alternative
and progressive nature.
So what exactly is a Wighat?
"Better to ask what is not Wig
hat." said Wenar, putting some
thing that looked like a drowned
opossum on his head.
I waited for some sort of elabora
tion, but he just hooted and
handed me a piece of paper. If you
ever figure this out, please let me
know:
"First Manifesto of Wighat:
"1. The Wighat is the totality of
all realities. The Essence of Being.
"2. And why does the Wighat
call? Why do you not call the Wig
hat? I respond. Moses took the
Hebrews into the desert where
they donned the Wighat and in
their madness ate insects. God
spurned the Wighat.
Gosh, how's that for weird? I'm
not sure that answers the ques
tion. but after all of this, I'm not
sure what the question really was.
