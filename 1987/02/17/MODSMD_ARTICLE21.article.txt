Muddy trails and Impending
rain did not deter University
President Donald Kennedy
from a visit with his feathered
friends Friday afternoon.
Kennedy, who Is on sabbati
cal. volunteered to lead mem
bers of the Stanford commu
nity on a bird-watching excur
sion with Stanford Outdoor Ad
ventures and Recreation
(SOAR). Despite the rain, Ken
nedy and the group of 11 chose
the perfect day for spotting
birds at the Baylands Nature
Preserve.
With telescope in hand, Ken
nedy marched his group
through mud and over cat
walks. He said he hoped the ex
cursion would be "a crash
course in identifying common
species of ducks" for his on
lookers.
Kennedy succeeded in point
ing out a variety of birds in a
spectrum of colors. Snowy
egrets, black turkey vultures.

blue herons and green-winged
treals were just some of the
species he identified for the
group.
Jean Martin, a resident of
Palo Alto, was one observer who
marveled at Kennedy's identifi
cation skills.
"I'm really impressed by how
much President Kennedy
knows; he turns left and right
and just points out the birds,"
Martin said.
Kennedy said he acquired his
skills one summer when he
took an undergraduate ornit
hology class at the University of
Michigan. Bird-watching has
been a hobby of his ever since.
Kennedy actively pursues his
interest because the Baylands
Nature Preserve is so close to
Stanford. He said that the
Baylands "is quite an extraordi
nary spot" for avid bird
watchers.
Despite living in Palo Alto for
many years. Martin confessed
that it was her first trip to the
Baylands.
