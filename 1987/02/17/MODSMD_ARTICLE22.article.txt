## Hoopsters fall to Huskies as Zevenbergen scores 24 
### SUSAN SLUSSER Editorial staff 
For the first time in eight straight
road games, the Stanford men's basket
ball team outrebounded its opponent.
The Cardinal also held 1986 Pacific 10
Conference Player of the Year Chris Welp
to just 13 points, well under his season
average of 20.7 points per game. Still, it
was not quite enough to beat Washing
ton at Edmundson Pavilion before a
crowd of 4,753 and an ESPN national
audience, as the Huskies prevailed 70-
65.
Stanford dropped to 12-12 on the year
and 6-9 in the Pac-10, seventh place in
the league standings. Washington im
proved its record to 14-11 overall and 8-
6 (fourth place) in the conference after
snapping a three-game losing streak.
Saturday night's game was perhaps
Stanford's most physical road outing of
the year, as the Cardinal came away
with a 34-33 edge in the rebounding cat
egory, including 14 offensive boards, the
most the team has amassed since a
season-high 18 against Columbia at the
beginning of the season. The Cardinal
also collected 25 personal fouls (to 17 for
Washington), as two players, Eric
Reveno and Terry Taylor, fouled out.
The biggest person to get into foul
trouble — both physically and in terms
of importance to the game — was 7-foot
Husky center Welp. who missed much of
the action on the bench after picking up
two fouls early on and wound up playing
just 22 minutes. The German native
finished with only three rebounds,
despite averaging nine per game.
The man who picked up the slack for

Washington has a familiar name to
Stanford fans, and not just because of
its difficulty. Phil Zevenbergen, a 6-foot
-10 forward, scored a game-high 25
points and added 11 rebounds in a 82-
77 Husky loss at Maples Pavilion earlier
this season, and had a similar perfor
mance this time around at home, total
ling 24 points and 10 rebounds, both
game-highs.
Stanford spent much of the first half
proving itself to a national television au
dience by trading leads with the
Huskies. The Cardinal was on top by two
points much of the period until Wash
ington drew even at 14 with 9:55 left in
the half on a Ron Calwell 18-footer from
the right side.
Stanford then managed only one bas
ket in a 6:07 period — an eight-foot
bank shot by Howard Wright — and fell
behind 22-16. Finally, with :13 left in
the half and the Cardinal down by four.
Todd Lichti hit a 3-point shot to clip the
score at intermission to 30-29.
Taylor's three-pointer from the top of
the key tied things up at 34 with 16:22
left, but that was as close as the Card
inal would come. Washington got the
next three scores on two baskets by
Zevenbergen and one by Welp. Zevenber
gen, in fact, totalled 18 points in the
second half.
"Zevenbergen hurt us when he got the
ball late," Stanford coach Mike
Montgomery said. "He's reallv the reason
Washington got the momentum late."
Late in the game, however, Stanford
made another run at the Huskies, and
might have pulled even if it were not for
a few crucial Cardinal mistakes, begin
ning with a pair of missed free throws by

Reveno, which, when they occurred, did
not seem too Important, with Stanford
trailing 61-53. After the Cardinal scored
the next three hoops on a 19-foot jumper
from the left baseline by Taylor, a 10-foot
fallaway by Wright from the right
baseline and another three-pointer by
Taylor, trimming the Huskies' lead to
61-60, the missed free throws loomed
larger.
Welp tipped in a rare Zevenbergen
miss, and then made one of two free
throws after being fouled by Reveno,
who left with his fifth personal at 2:58.
Seconds later, Welp himself fouled out
and Wright subsequently sank two
freethrows to make the score 64-62.
Continuing the trend, Wright, in turn,
fouled Kevin Vidato, who made both.
With the score 66-62, Zevenbergen
fouled Lichti, an 84 percent free throw
shooter. Lichti only made one of two,
however. Stanford's Greg Butler, the
next player to fall victim to the foul,
missed the first shot of a one-and-one —
and the Huskies took advantage of their
next two possessions on baskets by
Eldridge Recasner and Mark West to
wrap things up. Two Taylor free throws
made the final score 70-65, as two
desperation three-point tries by Novian
Whitsitt fell short.
"If we'd hit a couple of free throws at
the end or a couple of plays had gome
our way instead of theirs, we could have
had a different outcome," said Taylor,
who finished with a career-high 17
points on 6-of-8 shooting, including
three from three-point range and two of
two free throws. Lichti led the Cardinal
with 20 points, hitting 7-of-10 from the
field and 5-of-8 from the line.
