# Card nine has tough weekend at home, drops 2 to Bulldogs
## 
### TOM SENF Editorial staff 
After two weeks of cold, damp
weather, Stanford finally got a
perfect day to play baseball. The
1,843 fans at Sunken Diamond,
unfortunately, got to see the Card
inal play its worst baseball of the
season in a 12-4 loss yesterday to
Fresno State.
With its usually vaunted pitch
ing staff allowing 10 hits and 15
walks, the Cardinal dropped its
second of the three-game series.
Stanford won the series opener on
Saturday 2-0 behind the seven-hit
pitching of Lee Plemel, then lost 4-
2 on Sunday. The Cardinal is now
7-4 on the season. Fresno State is
5-3.
"Normally, we do a pretty good
job of getting the ball over the
plate," Stanford Coach Mark
Marquess said. "It wasn't just one
individual; it was everybody. You
can't give a good team that many

opportuntles, and they took ad
vantage of them."
Marquess was right on all three
counts. One, Stanford did come
Into the game averaging just 2.6
walks per nine Innings. Two, five
of the six Cardinal pitchers used
yesterday did walk at least one
man, and the sixth, Dave Reis,
faced just one batter. And three,
the Bulldogs did take advantage of
the Cardinal's generosity, as seven
of the 15 men walked scored.
Jack McDowell started for Stan
ford and, unlike his three-inning
shutout performance last week
against San Francisco State,
showed some of the effects of his
seven-month layoff. The second
team All-America right-hander did
not seem to have consistent pop
on his fastball and had trouble
getting his slider down in the
strike zone. He allowed five runs
(four earned) in his three innings.
"As long as he stays healthy,
he'll be all right. It'll just take some

time," Marquess said. "He can't be
expected to just go out and domi
nate."
With the score 5-0. Stanford
threatened to make a game of it
with three runs in the bottom of
the fourth on an RBI single by
Paul Carey and a two-run single by
Frank Carey.
That, however, was it for the
Cardinal offense until sophomore
pinch hitter Scott Delucchi's first
collegiate homer in the ninth. For
the weekend. Stanford scored in
just four of the 26 innings in
which it batted.
"That's obviously a big prob
lem." Marquess said. "We've got to
generate more runs to beat good
teams. We can't pitch under that
kind of pressure all the time."
Jim Price managed to keep the
Bulldogs at bay during the fourth
and fifth innings, but the Bull
dogs gradually pulled away with

two runs in the sixth, one in the
seventh, two in the eighth and two
in the ninth.
Stanford got off to a good start
on Sunday by scoring two runs in
the first off Fresno State starter
John Salles on an RBI groundball
by Toi Cook and a run-scoring
double by Ed Sprague, but then
Salles took command, allowing
just four hits the rest of the way en
route to a six-hit complete game
victory.
Two runs looked to be enough
in the early going, as Stanford
starter Steve Chitren cruised
through the first five innings. But
in the sixth Chitren gave up an
RBI single to Eddie Zosky that left
the bases full with two outs.
With a left-handed pinch hitter,
Eddie Bustamante, coming up,
Marquess called on southpaw
reliever A 1 Osuna. Osuna quickly
got ahead of Bustamante at 0-2,
but then threw a breaking ball in
the dirt that eluded catcher Doug
Robbins and allowed the tying run

to score.
In the eighth, after Steve Pearse
reached on a one-out infield
single, Osuna went to 2-1 on
pinch hitter Scott Rath. Accord
ing to Rath. Osuna had gotten the
best of their earlier junior college
meetings, but this time the Card
inal hurler got one up too high in
the strike zone, and Rath blasted
it over the centerfield fence for a
two-run homer.
"I was just looking for some
thing in the zone," Rath said.
"When I hit it. I was pretty excited.
It felt pretty solid."
On Saturday, it was Stanford's
Plemel who was pretty solid, as the
junior right-hander, now 2-2 with
a 1.80 ERA. shut the Bulldogs out
on seven hits and a walk while
striking out seven, including the
final three men to face him.
Cook provided all the scoring in
the first with line-drive two-run
homer off Bulldog starter Derek
Stroud that cleared both the left
field wall and the back fence adja
cent to the Stanford soccer field. "I
figured he would try to come in
with something off-speed," Cook
said. "He hung it up there, and 1
just went after it."

Plemel had to pitch himself out
of a couple of tough situations,
the toughest coming in the
fourth. With the bases loaded and
two out, Plemel fell behind third
baseman Evln Edwards 2-0, but
came back and threw three
straight strikes, the last a slow
curve that froze Edwards in his
tracks.
"He just refuses to self
destruct," Stanford pitching
coach Tom Dunton said. "He's got
a lot of confidence in himself. He's
got an inner strength you like to
see in a pitcher."
Indeed, Plemel was unperturbed
by the 2-0 count on Edwards. "I
missed where I wanted to miss,"
Plemel said. "I knew I could come
back. The curveball is my pitch.
I've got to be able to throw it
anytime."
For Plemel. the real nervousness
had come earlier — he had not
escaped the first inning un
scathed all season. "Once 1 got
through that, 1 thought I'd be
OK," he said.
Dunton was more emphatic.
"We thought we'd have a victory
party after he finally made it
through a first inning," he said.

Dunton was more emphatic.
"We thought we'd have a victory

After two weeks of cold, damp
weather, Stanford finally got a
perfect day to play baseball. The
1,843 fans at Sunken Diamond,
unfortunately, got to see the Card
inal play its worst baseball of the
season in a 12-4 loss yesterday to
Fresno State.
With its usually vaunted pitch
ing staff allowing 10 hits and 15
walks, the Cardinal dropped its
second of the three-game series.
Stanford won the series opener on
Saturday 2-0 behind the seven-hit
pitching of Lee Plemel, then lost 4-
2 on Sunday. The Cardinal is now
7-4 on the season. Fresno State is
5-3.
"Normally, we do a pretty good
job of getting the ball over the
plate," Stanford Coach Mark
Marquess said. "It wasn't just one
individual; it was everybody. You
can't give a good team that many

opportuntles, and they took ad
vantage of them."
Marquess was right on all three
counts. One, Stanford did come
Into the game averaging just 2.6
walks per nine Innings. Two, five
of the six Cardinal pitchers used
yesterday did walk at least one
man, and the sixth, Dave Reis,
faced just one batter. And three,
the Bulldogs did take advantage of
the Cardinal's generosity, as seven
of the 15 men walked scored.
Jack McDowell started for Stan
ford and, unlike his three-inning
shutout performance last week
against San Francisco State,
showed some of the effects of his
seven-month layoff. The second
team All-America right-hander did
not seem to have consistent pop
on his fastball and had trouble
getting his slider down in the
strike zone. He allowed five runs
(four earned) in his three innings.
"As long as he stays healthy,
he'll be all right. It'll just take some

time," Marquess said. "He can't be
expected to just go out and domi
nate."
With the score 5-0. Stanford
threatened to make a game of it
with three runs in the bottom of
the fourth on an RBI single by
Paul Carey and a two-run single by
Frank Carey.
That, however, was it for the
Cardinal offense until sophomore
pinch hitter Scott Delucchi's first
collegiate homer in the ninth. For
the weekend. Stanford scored in
just four of the 26 innings in
which it batted.
"That's obviously a big prob
lem." Marquess said. "We've got to
generate more runs to beat good
teams. We can't pitch under that
kind of pressure all the time."
Jim Price managed to keep the
Bulldogs at bay during the fourth
and fifth innings, but the Bull
dogs gradually pulled away with

two runs in the sixth, one in the
seventh, two in the eighth and two
in the ninth.
Stanford got off to a good start
on Sunday by scoring two runs in
the first off Fresno State starter
John Salles on an RBI groundball
by Toi Cook and a run-scoring
double by Ed Sprague, but then
Salles took command, allowing
just four hits the rest of the way en
route to a six-hit complete game
victory.
Two runs looked to be enough
in the early going, as Stanford
starter Steve Chitren cruised
through the first five innings. But
in the sixth Chitren gave up an
RBI single to Eddie Zosky that left
the bases full with two outs.
With a left-handed pinch hitter,
Eddie Bustamante, coming up,
Marquess called on southpaw
reliever A 1 Osuna. Osuna quickly
got ahead of Bustamante at 0-2,
but then threw a breaking ball in
the dirt that eluded catcher Doug
Robbins and allowed the tying run

to score.
In the eighth, after Steve Pearse
reached on a one-out infield
single, Osuna went to 2-1 on
pinch hitter Scott Rath. Accord
ing to Rath. Osuna had gotten the
best of their earlier junior college
meetings, but this time the Card
inal hurler got one up too high in
the strike zone, and Rath blasted
it over the centerfield fence for a
two-run homer.
"I was just looking for some
thing in the zone," Rath said.
"When I hit it. I was pretty excited.
It felt pretty solid."
On Saturday, it was Stanford's
Plemel who was pretty solid, as the
junior right-hander, now 2-2 with
a 1.80 ERA. shut the Bulldogs out
on seven hits and a walk while
striking out seven, including the
final three men to face him.
Cook provided all the scoring in
the first with line-drive two-run
homer off Bulldog starter Derek
Stroud that cleared both the left
field wall and the back fence adja
cent to the Stanford soccer field. "I
figured he would try to come in
with something off-speed," Cook
said. "He hung it up there, and 1
just went after it."

Plemel had to pitch himself out
of a couple of tough situations,
the toughest coming in the
fourth. With the bases loaded and
two out, Plemel fell behind third
baseman Evln Edwards 2-0, but
came back and threw three
straight strikes, the last a slow
curve that froze Edwards in his
tracks.
"He just refuses to self
destruct," Stanford pitching
coach Tom Dunton said. "He's got
a lot of confidence in himself. He's
got an inner strength you like to
see in a pitcher."
Indeed, Plemel was unperturbed
by the 2-0 count on Edwards. "I
missed where I wanted to miss,"
Plemel said. "I knew I could come
back. The curveball is my pitch.
I've got to be able to throw it
anytime."
For Plemel. the real nervousness
had come earlier — he had not
escaped the first inning un
scathed all season. "Once 1 got
through that, 1 thought I'd be
OK," he said.
Dunton was more emphatic.
"We thought we'd have a victory
