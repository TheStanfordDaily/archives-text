### TOM SENF Editorial staff 
After two weeks of cold, damp
weather, Stanford finally got a
perfect day to play baseball. The
1,843 fans at Sunken Diamond,
unfortunately, got to see the Card
inal play its worst baseball of the
season in a 12-4 loss yesterday to
Fresno State.
With its usually vaunted pitch
ing staff allowing 10 hits and 15
walks, the Cardinal dropped its
second of the three-game series.
Stanford won the series opener on
Saturday 2-0 behind the seven-hit
pitching of Lee Plemel, then lost 4-
2 on Sunday. The Cardinal is now
7-4 on the season. Fresno State is
5-3.
"Normally, we do a pretty good
job of getting the ball over the
plate," Stanford Coach Mark
Marquess said. "It wasn't just one
individual; it was everybody. You
can't give a good team that many

opportuntles, and they took ad
vantage of them."
Marquess was right on all three
counts. One, Stanford did come
Into the game averaging just 2.6
walks per nine Innings. Two, five
of the six Cardinal pitchers used
yesterday did walk at least one
man, and the sixth, Dave Reis,
faced just one batter. And three,
the Bulldogs did take advantage of
the Cardinal's generosity, as seven
of the 15 men walked scored.
Jack McDowell started for Stan
ford and, unlike his three-inning
shutout performance last week
against San Francisco State,
showed some of the effects of his
seven-month layoff. The second
team All-America right-hander did
not seem to have consistent pop
on his fastball and had trouble
getting his slider down in the
strike zone. He allowed five runs
(four earned) in his three innings.
"As long as he stays healthy,
he'll be all right. It'll just take some

time," Marquess said. "He can't be
expected to just go out and domi
nate."
With the score 5-0. Stanford
threatened to make a game of it
with three runs in the bottom of
the fourth on an RBI single by
Paul Carey and a two-run single by
Frank Carey.
That, however, was it for the
Cardinal offense until sophomore
pinch hitter Scott Delucchi's first
collegiate homer in the ninth. For
the weekend. Stanford scored in
just four of the 26 innings in
which it batted.
"That's obviously a big prob
lem." Marquess said. "We've got to
generate more runs to beat good
teams. We can't pitch under that
kind of pressure all the time."
Jim Price managed to keep the
Bulldogs at bay during the fourth
and fifth innings, but the Bull
dogs gradually pulled away with
