### PABLO MORALES Staff writer 
Saturday night's game against Pacific 10 Confer
ence leader Washington was a revelation of sorts for
the Stanford women's basketball program.
The 67-57 loss to the 17th-ranked team in the na
tion showed how far Cardinal basketball has come,
and how far it has yet to go.
Once again, Stanford proved that it could play with
anyone for at least a half, inching ahead of highly re
garded Washington 32-31 in the first half. But in the
second half, when depth and overall strength came
to the fore, the Cardinal also displayed why it has
been faltering against elites like the 18-4 Huskies.
"Our bench is not as strong as theirs, so our
players were getting tired by the second half," Stan
ford Coach Tara VanDerveer said. "It reflects our
depth. And that's been the story of our whole
season."
Huskies coach Chris Gobrecht, in a story-telling
mood of her own. gave a different account of her
team's season, but one just as germane to Saturday's
outcome.
"The story of our year has been different people
coming through for us at different times." she said.
"We got excellent play from our bench and that was
the key. Our (starters) were able to get rest and still
come back into the game with the lead."
Huskies forward Tract Thurdgill and center Amy
Mickelson came off the bench to help Washington
maintain as much as a five-point lead for most of the
first half. The two shot a combined 8-for-10 from the
field for 17 points.
Stanford, however, playing a superb first half of
basketball, passed the ball effectively through Wash
ington's tight pressure defense and into a posting
Jill Yanke who scored 11 points in the opening
stanza. Her two free throws with no time remaining
on the clock gave Stanford the one-point advantage
at halftime.
Stanford's momentum carried over into the
opening minutes of the second half as a Jennifer
Azzi steal and fast-break layup gave the Cardinal a
38-35 advantage. But from there Washington's
abundant talent took control of the contest.
Guard Yvette Cole spearheaded the Washington
surge with two quick steals followed by a couple of
fast-break hoops that gave the Huskies the lead for
good at 39-38.

With occasional help from
i reserves like Thurdgill and Jacki
Myers, who hit two clutch baskets
down the stretch, the Huskies
kept the Cardinal at a safe dis
tance. When Cole added two more
quick baskets with a little under
five minutes to play, Washington
established a decisive advantage.
61-53.
Cole's 14 points in the second
half gave her a game-high 23
points. Yanke led Stanford scorers
with 19 points.
"We don't have the explosive

player (like Cole) who can put the
ball down and go," VanDerveer
said. "And if we don't have that
type of player, then they better
know how to pass well."
After passing well in the first
half, the Cardinal offense suc
cumbed to the Huskies' pressure
and looked much more out of
synch in the second stanza.
"We had a better idea of what
they wanted to do," Gobrecht said.
"We played smarter and were a
step better in the second half."
The loss dropped the Cardinal
below .500 in the Pac-10 to 6-7.
Stanford sits in sixth place in the
conference, a game and a half
ahead of California.
