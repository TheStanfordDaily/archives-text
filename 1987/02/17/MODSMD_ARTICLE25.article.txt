# Men's swimming gets comeback win
## 
### ERIK ESELIUS Senior staff writer 
The last time the Stanford
men's swimming team found
itself down by 27 points at
deGuerre Pool, pterodactyls
were laying eggs for the nearby
neanderthal country store.
But in last Saturday's home
meet against the Calgary
Dinosaurs, that's precisely
what evolved until Stanford
fought from behind to secure a
50-45 victory.
Coming off the Canadian Na
tionals, the well-rested and
shaved Dinosaurs almost laid
ruin to the current Stanford
seniors' four-year unblemished
home streak.
Calgary started fast by upset
ting the Cardinal in the
opening 400-yard medley relay,
posting a relatively impressive
clocking of 3:22.36. The Stan
ford A team finished a dis
apointing half-second behind.
Following a customary first
place showing by senior tri
captain Jeff Kostoff in the
1,000 freestyle, the Dinosaurs
then began to soar. In the next
two events, the 50 freestyle and
the 200 IM. Calgary captured
both first and second going
into the diving competition.
The score read Calgary 35.
Stanford 8. Pterodactyl eggs
went on wholesale.
A bit taken back. Stanford
subsequently went on its own
tear and ran off a 42-10 swing.
"Everything was real posi
tive. There was no maybe we'll
win this or that. We just came
together and said we're going to
do this," sophomore John

Hodge said. "We really came
through."
Hodge said that in the
opening stanza of the meet.
Stanford mostly swam people
in off-events. But once the
Cardinal found itself down, way
down, it opted for its stronger
lineup after the diving break.
In what Hodge called "an in
spiration," Cardinal butter
fliers Anthony Mosse and Pablo
Morales touched home first and
second in the 200 butterfly over
Calgary's highly touted Mike
Ponting. "That (the 200 butter
fly) got us rolling," Hodge said.
Freshman John Witchell and
Kostoff continued the momen
tum, nabbing first and second
in the 500 freestyle. Then
Morales, who along with the
other seniors was swimming in
his final meet ever at deGuerre
Pool, turned in yet another
clutch performance.
Swimming in an "off-event,"
Morales edged out the
Dinosaurs' top breaststroker.
Hob Chernoff, to claim first.
Stanford clinched the meet
with a decisive victory in the
400 freestyle relay.
"If we |had| lost, we would
have been lower than whale
shit." Kostoff said afterwards.
"I thought I learned my les
son a couple of years ago â€” you
put the meet away, then you
have fun," Stanford coach Skip
Kenney said. ' What we tried to
do In this meet was to allow the
team to rely on some new faces.
What It came down to was that
we had to rely again on the old
faces."
