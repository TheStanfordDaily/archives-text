### EVAN TUCHINSKY Staff writer 
FULLERTON â€” The full moon
on Friday the 13th certainly vexed
the Stanford women's gymnastics
team this weekend. Despite a solid
performance, the 18th-ranked
Cardinal squad was defeated by
No. 1 Utah and No. 6 Fullerton
State, and then fell Saturday in
Seattle to Washington.
Utah won the Sizzler Invita
tional Friday with a score of
183.85, followed by Fullerton at
180.90. Stanford finished third
with a mark of 176.75, but the
mark was not an accurate in
dicator of the team's performance.
"I think our team hit our
routines, but I think the scoring
was way too low," senior Nanci
Goldsmith said. "They're not
giving us a chance to show that
we're a national power."
Her teammates shared her sen
timents. "We had a great meet,
but I think the scoring was a little
off," freshman Becky Ashton said.
"We hit beam and almost hit bars.
Floor and vault went well. Actu
ally, it was a pretty good meet."
Individually, the Cardinal fared

somewhat better, especially fresh
man Dlna Amoroso. Amoroso,
who halls from nearby Placentia
and drew a fairly supportive
crowd, tied for first on vault with a
9.5 and won first on floor with a
9.45, finishing fourth in the all
around.
"Dina Amoroso had an out
standing meet," Stanford Coach
Homer Sardina observed. "So did
Jinny Rhee, Nanci Goldsmith and
Alison McGann.
"They say that on the way to the
top you take your lumps." he con
tinued. "You hate to do it. but
you've got to take your knocks.
Overall I think it was a good exper
ience for everyone, and I'm looking
forward to Seattle."
At Washington, fatigue rather
than competition was the Card
inal's greatest enemy. The squad
finished at 180.90, almost four
points below the 12th-ranked
Huskies' 184.84.
Amoroso once again lead the
Stanford effort with her first-place
finish on vault, though she had to
scratch on the floor due to a
jammed toe. McGann and Cheryl
Doo also performed well, tying for
third on vault.
