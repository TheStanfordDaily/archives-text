# Men's gymnastics third at Hobee's Invitational
## 
### MARK SMOYER Staff writer 
Friday night at Maples Pavilion, a
noisy — when not speechless — crowd
enjoyed a show of acrobatics, daring and
sheer strength performed to near perfec
tion by some, and frightening ineptness
by others as over 40 gymnasts put on an
thrilling if not flawless six-ring circus.
When the chalk dust cleared, the win
ner of the Stanford Hobee's Invitational,
as expected, was No. 1 UCLA, though its
275.65 team score was disappointing to
team members and to those who had
hoped to see the expertise that had led
the Bruins to a score of 282.4 the week
before.
Second behind the Bruins was No. 4
California at 274.6, followed by Stanford
with 272.1. A team comprised of ex
collegians now on the U.S. National
Team, many of whom were not in com
petition shape, finished fourth at 269.1.
San Jose State followed with a score of
256. UC-Santa Barbara came in at
251.55 and UC-Davis finished last.
The Cardinal gymnasts were, in gen
eral, pleased with their team's perfor
mance.
The Cardinal's work on the rings,

lowllghted by captain Mike Matzek's
8.35, produced only a 43.95 event score
to start off the competition. After the
vault, where again a Stanford standout
— this time Gerardo — scored 8.35, the
Cardinal scored above 45 points on each
apparatus. The squad capped off the
night with a meet-leading 46.95 on the
pommel horse.
"1 think we're coming along," sopho
more Andy Ropp said. "We're not perfect
yet, but we're getting better every time
out. . . . We got off to a slow start, but
then we kicked In and got momentum,
and it carried us for the rest of the
meet."
1984 Olympian Tim Daggett won the
all-around title with a score of 57.6, an
entire point ahead of fellow U.S. team
member Billy Paul. Cal's Steve Mikulak
came in third. UCLA's Tony Pineda, cur
rently the nation's No. 1 collegian, re
corded the meet's top single event score
with a 9.8 on the parallel bars. Vince
Jervis of UC-Davis recorded the meet's
lowest single event score with a 4.35 on
the rings.
Stanford's top all-around performer
was Matzek, who finished fifth at 55.35.
Freshman Conrad Voorsanger came in
next at 54.55.
