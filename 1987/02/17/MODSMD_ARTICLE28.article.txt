Finally, the Cardinal five is healthy. A fit Stanford
women's golf team showed its true colors in yester
day's first round of the Arizona Intercollegiate in
Tucson.
Stanford is in fourth place at 308, Just 10 shots be
hind leader Arizona State and four ahead of host
Arizona. The University of New Mexico is second at
305. with USC third at 307.
Not surprisingly, senior Kathleen McCarthy is also
right in the thick of the individual race. In cold and
windy conditions, McCarthy shot a solid 74 on the
par 72. 6.100-yard Randolph Golf Course to grab
fifth place. ASU's Pam Wright and New Mexico's Tara
Fleming each shot 71 to seize the early lead-
One shot behind that pair are Laurette Maritz of
U.S. International University and Kate Golden of
Texas at even-par. Tied with McCarthy are USC s
Kim Saiki. Vicky Lane of UCLA and ASU's Amy Fur
wirth.
The Cardinal five was a model of consistency in the
opening round. Each player broke 80 to place the
Cardinal in excellent position to make a run at the
team title. Sophomore Clare Dolan fired a 77. juniors
Trish McGonigle and Kay Cornelius 78 and 79
respectively, and senior Adriene Gilmartin 79.
More important than being in the thick of the
tournament, the Cardinal's excellent round was cri
tical in their quest for an NCAA Championship
berth. Each team's lowest 15 rounds of .the year will
be combined to determine the 14 schools that will
participate in the final tournament of the season.
