# Campus launches Condom Week
## 
### BAIE NETZER Senior staff writer 
As student groups at colleges around the na
tion gear up to distribute condoms this week
as part of National Condom Week, Stanford
students appear caught up in the excitement.
In fact, many have chosen to purchase their
supplies immediately rather than wait for free
samples to be distributed today and tomorrow
in White Plaza.
Since the free condoms available at the
Cowell Student Health Center gained
publicity, counselors at the Contraceptive In
formation Center (CIC) say more and more stu
dents are coming in requesting condoms. The
CIC has now sold nearly 700 condoms this
quarter, with 300 condoms sold in the past 10
days alone, according to CIC counselor Eric
Jackson. The CIC normally sells around 500
condoms over the course of an entire quarter,
he said.
"We're running very low on condoms," Jack
son said. "We're down to just a few hundred
and we predict they'll be sold by the end of next
week."
But for those who fear running low on

supplies, Jackson says CIC counselors will buy
1,000 more condoms next week. And for those
whose condom budget is in the red, free con
doms will be available in White Plaza today.
As part of National Condom Week at Stan
ford, the AIDS Education Project will dis
tribute 500 packets of condoms today and to
morrow in White Plaza between 11 a.m. and
1:15 p.m. Each packet contains eight brands
of condoms, among them "exotic pink and
black condoms from Japan, smooth and
ribbed condoms, and a condom with Tahiti
colors," according to senior Meg Richman.
Students will be asked to rate the condoms ac
cording to color, size, shape, texture and taste.
The rating forms are due to be returned
Friday, and those interested could know by
next Monday which condoms Stanford stu
dents like best, according to Richman.
The AIDS Education Project is distributing
the condoms "not just to educate about con
doms but also implicitly about AIDS," Rich
man said.
While the AIDS Education Project is not affil
iated with the National Condom Week Com
mittee's office in Oakland, over 50 other
agencies and colleges are affiliated with the of

fice and many more are using the National
Condom Week slogan to hand out condoms
and information relating to contraception and
sexually transmitted diseases (STDs), accord
ing to Charles Mayer, assistant coordinator of
National Condom Week.
"Our goals are to stop the spread of STDs, to
stop unintentional pregnancies and to get
males more involved in family planning,"
Mayer said. Through humor, organizers hope
"that people will lighten up a little bit and talk
about these issues more," Mayer said.
Organizers at colleges around the country
appear to be hoping for the same thing.
At UC-Berkeley, students plan to hold the
sixth annual "Dik-athlon" Friday, according to
organizer Karen Hughes. Contestants will
compete in five events: Pin the Condom on the
Man, the Condom Blow Up, a Pregnant Man
Pageant, a Condom Quiz Show and a Water-
Filled Condom Throw.
The Berkeley Men's Octet will open the "Dik
athlon" with the National Condom Day Song,
sung to the tune of "Runaround Sue."
Helium-filled condoms and information
from various student groups will
also be distributed Friday, accord
ing to Hughes.
At the University of lowa, the
Condom Queen and his five con
dom cuplds distributed condoms
on Valentine's Day. according to
Joel Gray, student advisor to the
Gay People's Union at the univer
sity.
Activities are also planned at
Virginia Tech. the University of
North Carolina. Foothill College
and San Jose State.
Meanwhile. Stanford students
await their packets.
Senior Kristy Carter said she
thought condom distribution was
a good Idea "as long as they pro
vide information about how effec
tive condoms are."
If condoms are the next best
thing to abstinence in preventing
STDs. senior Dylan Kohler said he
supports the distribution,
"although I think they should dis
tribute bigger condoms."
Senior Bob Pratt said he also
supports the distribution of con
doms In White Plaza "as long as
the condoms don't have to be used
there."
Meanwhile, sophomore Mike
Sommer calculated the utility of
the elght-condom pack. "That
should last me until I'm 30."
