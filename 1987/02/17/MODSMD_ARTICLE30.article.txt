# Women's swimming downs Cal, but Meagher defeats Johnson
## 
### BRENDAN HEALEY Senior staff writer 
BERKELEY — Jennifer Pokluda may
have backed her way into the NCAA
meet, but that's fine with her.
Pokluda. a junior co-captain of the
Stanford women's swimming team,
knocked nearly two seconds off her
season-best time with a 2:03.67 in the
200-yard backstroke and helped the
Cardinal swamp the California Bears
156-111 at California's Spieker Pool on
Saturday.
"I'm really glad to have it out of the
way," said Pokluda, who had already
met her cut in the 100 backstroke and
garnered All-America honors in both
events last year. "1 think part of the rea
son I did better was working on my
turns. This week I've really been focus
ing on hitting my turns and my start."
While Pokluda's second-place swim
was one of the few season-best times re
corded by the Cardinal on a gray day in

Berkeley, it wasn't the only highlight of a
generally lackluster meet.
The touted matchup In the 100 but
terfly between Stanford's Jenna
Johnson and Cal's Mary T. Meagher
lived up to its billing. Johnson led for
the first 75 yards as she gobbled huge
amounts of water with each powerful
stroke.
Meagher was not to be denied,
though, and she came off the last turn
in first. Meagher's endurance training
paid off in the last 25 yards as she
steadily pulled away for the win in a
pool-record time of 54.39. Johnson
finished a hair behind at 54.76.
After the race, the two immediately
looked at each other, and Meagher gave
her young rival a hug before leaving the
pool.
"Mary T. swam great," California
Coach Karen Thornton said. "She has
probably the best last quarter of
anybody."
Before the meet, Thornton had said

she felt Meagher was the only member of
her team capable of winning an event,
but the Bears picked up firsts from two
other swimmers and surprised Stanford
in taking the 200 freestyle relay.
"We had our big meet of the year last
week (against No. 1 Texas)," Stanford
Coach George Haines said. "We had
some girls who didn't swim too well. I
just don't think we had a good meet
overall. It wasn't important enough to
them."
Nonetheless, the Cardinal did manage
to qualify two more swimmers for the
NCAA meet in addition to Pokluda. Mi
chelle Griglione swam the 200 individ
ual medley for the first time this season
and easily hit her cut, while Susannah
Miller qualified in the 100 backstroke,
an event in which five Stanford swim
mers have hit the qualifying time.
The Cardinal had two double winners,
as Griglione added a first in the 100
freestyle, and Katie Connors took both
diving events.
