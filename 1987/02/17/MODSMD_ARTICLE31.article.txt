## 
### JON WEISMAN Staff writer 
The rain that some had feared would delay or can
eel the Northern California Intercollegiate Tennis
Championships for the second consecutive year
never arrived. However, because of commitments to
the National Team Indoors in Louisville, Ky.. the
championship matches in both singles and doubles
will be delayed until sometime next week.
The singles championship will feature Stanford's
Jeff Tarango against California's surprising Cary
Streeter. According to Stanford Asst. Coach John
Whitlinger, Streeter is apparently the seventh or
eighth man on the Bears, and was playing only be
cause Cal's top two singles players, Steve DeVries
and Alex Nizet, sat out the singles last weekend.
Tarango. the third seed, defeated five opponents to
gain his place in the finals. In his quarterfinal match
against eighth-seeded Mauricio Achondo, Achondo
was serving for the win at 5-3 of the third set.
Tarango broke serve to win that game, as well as the
next three, taking the match 6-3, 4-6, 7-5.
Tarango, who remains undefeated after nine
singles matches this year, found second seed Jean

LeClerq of Fresno State much easier competition,
winning 6-2, 6-2 to earn the right to play Streeter.
Scott Moody was the other big highlight in singles
for the Cardinal. Moody won three times before
losing to LeClerq in the quarterfinals. 6-4, 5-7, 7-6.
"Scott did a great job overall." Stanford Coach Dick
Gould said. "He won three tough matches. 1 was
really pleased with his play."
"(The NorCal) was the first time I've felt comforta
ble on the court in a while." Moody said. "My confi
dence had slipped a little bit; I had a string of losses."
Three other Stanford players won two matches
before bowing out: Sixth-seeded Jeff Cathrall,
Geordie McKee and Barry Richards. Curtis Dunn lost
to erstwhile Cardinal killer LeClerq in the opening
round, 6-4, 4-6, 6-3.
In doubles, the Cardinal team of Cathrall and Eric
Peus provided what Gould felt was "our only good
play in doubles." The pair took two before losing to
second-seeded DeVries and Ted Scherman, 6-1, 6-1.
Top seeds Patrick McEnroe and Moody lost to Cal's
Nizet and Doug Eisenmann in the semifinals, 6-4, 6-
1, while Tarango and McKee were eliminated after
losing two tiebreakers in a second-round match.
