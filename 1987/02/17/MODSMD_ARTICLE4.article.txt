# Frosh to keep dorm options
## 
### CLAY CALVERT Staff writer 
A proposal that would have
eliminated the opportunity for in
coming freshmen to express pref
erence for housing based on the
sex and class composition of dor
mitories has been rejected by
Dean of Student Affairs James
Lyons.
After consulting Thursday with
Dean of Undergraduate Studies
Carolyn Lougee and Classics Prof.
Marsh McCall, chair of the Com
mittee on Undergraduate Studies
(C-US), Lyons decided to reject the
recommendation of the Subcom
mittee on Residential Education
and Advising (SREA).
The SREA recommendation
would have denied incoming
freshmen the opportunity to ex
press preference for assignment to
an all-freshman or four-class
dorm or to a single-sex or coed cor

"That choice will be there for
next year," Lyons said, adding
that he thought more discussion
on the issue was needed before he
would reconsider the recommen

Lyons did, however, accept the

SREA recommendation allowing
freshmen to Increase their
chances of assignment to one of
Stanford's three ethnic theme
houses — Okada. Ujamaa and
Zapata — by giving them the op
portunity to express preference for
a particular theme house or
houses.
According to Lyons, the wording
of the forms freshmen use to indi
cate housing and Western Culture
track preferences will probably be
changed next year.
"One of the changes in next
year's information will be to point
out that 40 percent of the choices
this year could not be fulfilled,"
Lyons said, making reference to
the percentage of incoming fresh
men last year whose preferences
for all-freshman or four-class dor
mitories or for single-sex or coed
corridors could not be honored.
According to a Jan. 2 memoran
dum to SREA members from Alice
Supton, assistant dean of Student
Affairs, the University was able to
grant the preferences of 53 per
cent of this year's freshmen who
requested all-freshman, coed
housing. Eighty-five percent of
