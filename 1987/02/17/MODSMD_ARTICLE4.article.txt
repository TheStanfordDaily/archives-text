# Frosh to keep dorm options
## 
### CLAY CALVERT Staff writer 
A proposal that would have
eliminated the opportunity for in
coming freshmen to express pref
erence for housing based on the
sex and class composition of dor
mitories has been rejected by
Dean of Student Affairs James
Lyons.
After consulting Thursday with
Dean of Undergraduate Studies
Carolyn Lougee and Classics Prof.
Marsh McCall, chair of the Com
mittee on Undergraduate Studies
(C-US), Lyons decided to reject the
recommendation of the Subcom
mittee on Residential Education
and Advising (SREA).
The SREA recommendation
would have denied incoming
freshmen the opportunity to ex
press preference for assignment to
an all-freshman or four-class
dorm or to a single-sex or coed cor
ridor.
"That choice will be there for
next year," Lyons said, adding
that he thought more discussion
on the issue was needed before he
would reconsider the recommen
dation.
Lyons did, however, accept the

SREA recommendation allowing
freshmen to Increase their
chances of assignment to one of
Stanford's three ethnic theme
houses — Okada. Ujamaa and
Zapata — by giving them the op
portunity to express preference for
a particular theme house or
houses.
According to Lyons, the wording
of the forms freshmen use to indi
cate housing and Western Culture
track preferences will probably be
changed next year.
"One of the changes in next
year's information will be to point
out that 40 percent of the choices
this year could not be fulfilled,"
Lyons said, making reference to
the percentage of incoming fresh
men last year whose preferences
for all-freshman or four-class dor
mitories or for single-sex or coed
corridors could not be honored.
According to a Jan. 2 memoran
dum to SREA members from Alice
Supton, assistant dean of Student
Affairs, the University was able to
grant the preferences of 53 per
cent of this year's freshmen who
requested all-freshman, coed
housing. Eighty-five percent of
those freshmen requesting a four
class house with single-sex cor
ridors received that preference.
Western Culture track
preferences now take precedence
over class and sex composition
preferences, according to Director
of Housing Rodger Whitney.
Western Culture and ethnic
theme house preferences "have al
ways been the priority criteria for
assignment," Whitney said,
noting that "there are a lot of
residence-based Western Culture
sections throughout the system."
Such sections are composed of
students from the same dormitory

but do not always take place
within the dorm Itself, he said.
Lougee expressed concern
about eliminating the opportunity
for students to express dormitory
preference based on sex and class
composition.
"A number of students have
talked to me about their strong
feeling that it does make a differ
ence that one is in a four-class or
all-freshman (dormitory)," Lougee
said, adding that students "care
about being able to make a
choice."
"I have my doubts about the
wisdom of resting everything on
the Western Culture choice,"
Lougee said.
Supton, however, said students
generally are happy In whatever

house they live.
"We know that people are happy
where they end up for the most
part," Supton said, citing housing
evaluations filled out by students
in past years.
"The houses are much more
similar than they are different,
Supton said, adding that "the way
that the overall goals of Residen
tial Education are met in the
dorms is very similar."
Supton stressed that SREA's
recommendations are completely
separate from the Wilbur "cluster
experiment" now in effect in four
dorms at Wilbur Hall. Under that
plan, Otero House Is composed en
tirely of students in the Great
Works Western Culture track,
while Madera is composed of 50

percent students from both Great
Wo ks and Literature and the
Arts, Supton said. Trancos and
Rineonada are composed of half
Literature and the Arts students,
with the other half coming from a
variety of tracks.
"I think that the resident fellows
in the Wilbur project would agree
that the population of students is
diverse in terms of academic inter
ests, community mindedness and
athletics." Supton said.
Charlie Junkerman, assistant
to the dean of undergraduate
studies and a resident fellow in
Madera, said preliminary aca
demic interest cards filed by fresh
men last summer showed that di
versity does exist in the dorms in
volved in the Wilbur project.
