### CHRIS MARIO 
Bureaucratic red tape and un
derqualified doctors at the Stan
ford Medical Center caused the
untimely death in 1983 of a man
with a brain tumor, according to a
lawsuit filed against Stanford that
went to trial Wednesday in State
Superior Court in San Jose.
Walter Clements, a Federal Avia
tion Administration (FAA) flight
engineer from Belmont, died Dec.
5, 1983, after a number of Stan
ford doctors failed to diagnose and
treat a "lemon-sized" astrocytoma
in the left frontal lobe of Clements'
brain, said Bruce Bailey, a Bur
lingame attorney representing
Clements' family in the suit.
Stanford attorneys at the trial
have maintained that because of
the seriousness of Clements' con
dition. no amount of medical at
tention could have saved him. ac
cording to the San Jose Mercury
News.
Socrates Manoukian, the lawyer
representing Stanford's insurance
representatives, called the errors
in Clements' treatment at Stan
ford Hospital "administrative"
rather than medical, the Mercury
News reported. Manoukian said at
the trial that Clements' condition
was untreatable.
Manoukian was out of town yes

terday and could not be reached
for comment.
Hospital officials declined to
comment on the case because it is
currently in litigation, but Spyros
Andreopoulous, director of com
munications at the medical cen
ter, said that malpractice cases
against Stanford are rare.
"Stanford Hospital generally
does not face this sort of prob
lem," he said.
Bailey declined to discuss how
much money Clements' family
hopes to win in damages, but ad
mitted that a $450,000 out-of
court settlement proposal was
rejected by Stanford last year.
According to Bailey, Clements
suffered a seizure in March 1982
in Saudi Arabia, where he was
working for the FAA. After a Saudi
Arabian CT-scan failed to show
any abnormalities in Clements'
brain, FAA officials advised Cle
ments to get a follow-up diagnosis
at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester,
Minn., or at Stanford. Bailey said.
A CT-scan is a computer
assisted X-ray procedure that
produces a three-dimensional
image of any internal organ, such
as the brain.
According to Bailey, Clements
saw a resident in neurology at
Stanford on April 15, 1982. On
