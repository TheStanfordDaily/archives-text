# Lawsuit targets Medical Center
## 
### CHRIS MARIO 
Bureaucratic red tape and un
derqualified doctors at the Stan
ford Medical Center caused the
untimely death in 1983 of a man
with a brain tumor, according to a
lawsuit filed against Stanford that
went to trial Wednesday in State
Superior Court in San Jose.
Walter Clements, a Federal Avia
tion Administration (FAA) flight
engineer from Belmont, died Dec.
5, 1983, after a number of Stan
ford doctors failed to diagnose and
treat a "lemon-sized" astrocytoma
in the left frontal lobe of Clements'
brain, said Bruce Bailey, a Bur
lingame attorney representing
Clements' family in the suit.
Stanford attorneys at the trial
have maintained that because of
the seriousness of Clements' con
dition. no amount of medical at
tention could have saved him. ac
cording to the San Jose Mercury
News.
Socrates Manoukian, the lawyer
representing Stanford's insurance
representatives, called the errors
in Clements' treatment at Stan
ford Hospital "administrative"
rather than medical, the Mercury
News reported. Manoukian said at
the trial that Clements' condition
was untreatable.
Manoukian was out of town yes

terday and could not be reached
for comment.
Hospital officials declined to
comment on the case because it is
currently in litigation, but Spyros
Andreopoulous, director of com
munications at the medical cen
ter, said that malpractice cases
against Stanford are rare.
"Stanford Hospital generally
does not face this sort of prob
lem," he said.
Bailey declined to discuss how
much money Clements' family
hopes to win in damages, but ad
mitted that a $450,000 out-of
court settlement proposal was
rejected by Stanford last year.
According to Bailey, Clements
suffered a seizure in March 1982
in Saudi Arabia, where he was
working for the FAA. After a Saudi
Arabian CT-scan failed to show
any abnormalities in Clements'
brain, FAA officials advised Cle
ments to get a follow-up diagnosis
at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester,
Minn., or at Stanford. Bailey said.
A CT-scan is a computer
assisted X-ray procedure that
produces a three-dimensional
image of any internal organ, such
as the brain.
According to Bailey, Clements
saw a resident in neurology at
Stanford on April 15, 1982. On
the basis of the Saudi Arabian test
results, the resident stated In his
report that the cause of the sei
zure could not be diagnosed, al
though he did note "a possible
brain tumor," Bailey said.
One month later, while in
France, Clements suffered an
other seizure. Doctors at the Uni
versity of Lille, who reviewed the
Saudi Arabian X-rays after the
second seizure, told Clements that
an abnormality in his brain was
evident, and suggested that he
return to Stanford for further ex
amination. Bailey said.
The Saudi Arabian CT-scan has
since been lost and cannot be
used as evidence in the trial.
Bailey said.
According to Bailey, Clements

met at Stanford on July 8. 1982.
with a resident who had been in
neurology for only one week, and
who had little knowledge In either
neurology or oncology.
The resident "admitted to me in
a deposition that he didn't know
the difference between a malig
nant and a benign tumor." Bailey
said. "He (the resident) decided
soon after seeing Clements that he
didn't really want to be a
neurologist after all. and quit the
program."
The resident did, however, or
der a second X-ray, also a CT
scan. Bailey said. After processing
the test five days later, a staff
radiologist noted a large brain
tumor in a report he sent to the
head of the neurology department,
Bailey said.
According to Bailey, the report
was filed, but neither Clements
nor his physicians were notified of

the diagnosis.
Soon afterward. Bailey said. Cle
ments received notification by
mall that his follow-up examina
tion. scheduled for the end of
July, had been canceled. When
Clements called the hospital to
ask about the cancellation and the
results of the CT-scan, he was told
by a receptionist that he had noth
ing to worry about. Bailey said.
"The receptionist told him that
if his appointment had been can
celed, then there was no reason to
worry — he obviously didn't have a
brain tumor," Bailey said.
According to Bailey, Clements
was not told by Stanford of his
condition until Aug. 26. 1982. A
few weeks later, after switching
doctors, Clements was admitted
to Sequoia Hospital in San Jose,
where "most of the left part of his
brain" was removed In an opera
tion. Bailey said.

return to Stanford for further ex
amination. Bailey said.
The Saudi Arabian CT-scan has
since been lost and cannot be
used as evidence in the trial.
Bailey said.
According to Bailey, Clements

met at Stanford on July 8. 1982.
with a resident who had been in
neurology for only one week, and
who had little knowledge In either
neurology or oncology.
The resident "admitted to me in
a deposition that he didn't know
the difference between a malig
nant and a benign tumor." Bailey
said. "He (the resident) decided
soon after seeing Clements that he
didn't really want to be a
neurologist after all. and quit the
program."
The resident did, however, or
der a second X-ray, also a CT
scan. Bailey said. After processing
the test five days later, a staff
radiologist noted a large brain
tumor in a report he sent to the
head of the neurology department,
Bailey said.
According to Bailey, the report
was filed, but neither Clements
nor his physicians were notified of

the diagnosis.
Soon afterward. Bailey said. Cle
ments received notification by
mall that his follow-up examina
tion. scheduled for the end of
July, had been canceled. When
Clements called the hospital to
ask about the cancellation and the
results of the CT-scan, he was told
by a receptionist that he had noth
ing to worry about. Bailey said.
"The receptionist told him that
if his appointment had been can
celed, then there was no reason to
worry — he obviously didn't have a
brain tumor," Bailey said.
According to Bailey, Clements
was not told by Stanford of his
condition until Aug. 26. 1982. A
few weeks later, after switching
doctors, Clements was admitted
to Sequoia Hospital in San Jose,
where "most of the left part of his
brain" was removed In an opera
tion. Bailey said.
Bureaucratic red tape and un
derqualified doctors at the Stan
ford Medical Center caused the
untimely death in 1983 of a man
with a brain tumor, according to a
lawsuit filed against Stanford that
went to trial Wednesday in State
Superior Court in San Jose.
Walter Clements, a Federal Avia
tion Administration (FAA) flight
engineer from Belmont, died Dec.
5, 1983, after a number of Stan
ford doctors failed to diagnose and
treat a "lemon-sized" astrocytoma
in the left frontal lobe of Clements'
brain, said Bruce Bailey, a Bur
lingame attorney representing
Clements' family in the suit.
Stanford attorneys at the trial
have maintained that because of
the seriousness of Clements' con
dition. no amount of medical at
tention could have saved him. ac
cording to the San Jose Mercury
News.
Socrates Manoukian, the lawyer
representing Stanford's insurance
representatives, called the errors
in Clements' treatment at Stan
ford Hospital "administrative"
rather than medical, the Mercury
News reported. Manoukian said at
the trial that Clements' condition
was untreatable.
Manoukian was out of town yes

terday and could not be reached
for comment.
Hospital officials declined to
comment on the case because it is
currently in litigation, but Spyros
Andreopoulous, director of com
munications at the medical cen
ter, said that malpractice cases
against Stanford are rare.
"Stanford Hospital generally
does not face this sort of prob
lem," he said.
Bailey declined to discuss how
much money Clements' family
hopes to win in damages, but ad
mitted that a $450,000 out-of
court settlement proposal was
rejected by Stanford last year.
According to Bailey, Clements
suffered a seizure in March 1982
in Saudi Arabia, where he was
working for the FAA. After a Saudi
Arabian CT-scan failed to show
any abnormalities in Clements'
brain, FAA officials advised Cle
ments to get a follow-up diagnosis
at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester,
Minn., or at Stanford. Bailey said.
A CT-scan is a computer
assisted X-ray procedure that
produces a three-dimensional
image of any internal organ, such
as the brain.
According to Bailey, Clements
saw a resident in neurology at
Stanford on April 15, 1982. On
the basis of the Saudi Arabian test
results, the resident stated In his
report that the cause of the sei
zure could not be diagnosed, al
though he did note "a possible
brain tumor," Bailey said.
One month later, while in
France, Clements suffered an
other seizure. Doctors at the Uni
versity of Lille, who reviewed the
Saudi Arabian X-rays after the
second seizure, told Clements that
an abnormality in his brain was
evident, and suggested that he
return to Stanford for further ex
amination. Bailey said.
The Saudi Arabian CT-scan has
since been lost and cannot be
used as evidence in the trial.
