# Centennial to boost financial aid base
## 
### ERIC RICHARDSON Staff writer 
Even if the Stanford Centen
nial fund-raising campaign
brings In Its goal of *80 million
for financial aid, students
should not expect to see In
creases In their Individual aid
offers, according to University
officials.
Instead, fund raising for stu
dent aid Is aimed at
strengthening the University's
general financial aid endow
ment so that "Stanford can
continue to offer financial aid
to all students on a need-blind
basis", according to Raymond
Bacchetti. vice provost and di

rector of University Budgets.
University President Donald
Kennedy and Board of Trustees
President Warren Christopher
announced the specific goals of
the *1.1 billion Centennial
campaign last Tuesday. The
goals include *25 million for
undergraduate scholarships.
*40 million for support of cur
rent financial aid programs
and *15 million for graduate
fellowships. Funds for scholar
ships and fellowships will go to
the University's student aid en
dowment.
Despite the large sums, addi
tional policy changes would be
necessary for the Centennial cam
paign to directly increase individ
ual student awards, Bacchetti
said.
In conjunction with Centennial
goals, Kennedy said Stanford
might be able to increase student
aid support if the Centennial cam
paign is successful. He said the

University should decrease em
phasis on work-study to allow un
dergraduates more time to con
duct in-depth research and
should Alleviate the growing stu
dent debt burden after gradua
tion.
But Bacchetti and officials in
Stanford's Financial Aids Office
Indicated that no definite plans
have been made yet to implement
Kennedy's proposed changes.
"That kind of a change (in un

dergraduate awards) would have
to be a policy decision to be made
with regard to what other institu
tions are doing and with regard to
the federal government," Bac
chetti said. "The main thing is
that Centennial success will
enable us to keep up with rising
costs and allow us to continue to
guarantee that we will fully meet
the demonstrated financial need
of every student offered admission
to Stanford."
