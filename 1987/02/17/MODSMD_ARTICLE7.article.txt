# DUI increase sparks ride service
## 
### MARK LAWRENCE Senior staff writer 
If a group of Sigma Chi fraternity members
achieves its goal, students who party too hard
on campus or at local bars will have an alterna
tive to driving themselves home.
The group is trying to establish an escort
service to drive students who have been drink
ing, or who do not want to drive with intox
icated friends, in an effort to address the
growing problem of drunk driving on campus.
The service, headed by junior Charlie Ahern,
will start on a pilot basis spring quarter, and
organizers hope to continue it permanently in
the fall, if students approve funding for the
program in the spring ASSU election.
According to plans for the program, a dis
patcher in the Interfraternity Council (IFC) of
fice at 670 Lomita Drive will take calls from
students who want rides home from campus
parties and local drinking spots. Student vol
unteers. who will operate in teams of two, will
pick up the callers and drive them home.
The service, which will run between 10 p.m.
and 2 a.m. Thursday through Saturday during

spring quarter, is designed to operate within a
five-mile radius of campus, but, Ahern said,
drivers will be willing to go further if neces
sary.
Ahern said organizers will make changes in
the program and adjust times and schedules
for the fall after they see how students respond
to the program next quarter.
The program comes in response to a growing
campus problem with drunk driving, legally
defined as driving with at least a .10 blood al
cohol level.
Stanford Police Chief Marvin Herrington
said arrests for drunk driving on campus have
increased "dramatically" over the last 15 years,
even though the Stanford population has not
changed significantly in that time.
According to statistics provided by Her
rington. there has been an average of 105
drunk driving arrests on campus over the last
five years. Herrington said there were never
more than 50 in any single year before 1982
and only about 15 or 20 per year when he first
started working at Stanford in the early 19705.
Herrington estimated, however, that only
about 20 to 25 percent of people arrested on

campus for drunk driving over the last five
years were Stanford students, faculty or staff.
The 17 volunteers involved in the escort pro
gram will receive special training from Stan
ford police and the Cowell Student Health Cen
ter in dealing with unruly passengers and
caring for those who may be seriously ill.
In the fall, organizers will try to recruit vol
unteers from all over campus to take part in
the program, but for now. Ahern said, or
ganizers will have an easier time getting
started by keeping the program "localized" to
Sigma Chi.
Drivers will use their own cars and will be
reimbursed for mileage and gas expenses, ac
cording to University Fraternal Affairs Adviser
Joe Pisano, who is helping students organize
the project. For spring quarter, the Office of
Student Affairs, the Stanford police and pos
sibly the IFC and individual houses will fund
the program. Ahern said.
Ahern said Stanford police are concerned
that the program will not be used heavily at
first, but. he said, he plans to keep the pro
gram alive through what may be a slow first
few quarters.
