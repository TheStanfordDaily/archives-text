Gorbachev: Reforms 'irreversible'
MOSCOW — Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev told an interna
tional peace gathering here yesterday that "the broad
democratization" of Soviet society "is irreversible" and, at the
same time, he charged the Reagan administration with attempt
ing to scrap the 1972 U.S.-Soviet treaty banning antiballistlc
missile defenses.
Addressing a crowd of about 850 visiting Americans and other
foreigners and Soviets. Gorbachev used the occasion to boost
Moscow's recent domestic and foreign policy initiatives and un
dercut what he sees as Western prejudices against the Soviet Un
ion and Soviet motives behind its reform drive.
"You have arrived in the Soviet Union when essentially revolu
tionary changes are under way," he told an audience including
hundreds of western celebrities, film stars, economists,
physicians and businessmen who were brought here at Soviet ex
pense for the three-day meeting. "It is often said — we still hear it
— that there is some threat stemming from the U.S.S.R," he said,
"a Soviet threat to peace and freedom."
"But we want to be understood," he added, "and we hope that
the world community will at last acknowledge that our desire to
make our country better will hurt no one, with the world only
gaining from this."
"And I must disappoint those who think that this has been the
result of pressure on us from the West, that we want to gain some
body's fancy in pursuit of ulterior motives." he said, insisting that
the changes were in accordance with "socialist choice."
Counterterrorism helped North
WASHINGTON — In January 1986, about the same time that
President Reagan was signing an authorization for U.S. arms
sales to what his administration officially defined as the "terrorist
state" of Iran, Marine Lt. Col. Oliver North became co-chairman of
a small group that coordinated the government's counterter
rorism efforts at the National Security Council.
Creation of the lnter-governmental "Operations Sub-Group"
(OSG), which met at the National Security Council, had long been
one of North's goals. And that year he got another wish: He was
put in charge of a new unit on terrorism within the NSC, with two
military officers and two secretaries working for him in renovated,
ultra-secure offices.
According to congressional and other investigators of the Iran
contra affair, it is clear in retrospect that the administration's
counterterrorism program was instrumental in helping North in
crease his power and independence within the NSC. Officials who
are familiar with his work in that area say North made counterter
rorism "his turf."
ABA supports tobacco advertising
NEW ORLEANS — The American Bar Association yesterday
refused to support a proposed prohibition on cigarette advertising
in magazines, newspapers and on billboards, giving the tobacco
companies a boost in their attempt to head off congressional pas
sage of such a ban.
The proposed ban gained steam last July, when the Supreme
Court, in a ruling that prohibited the advertising of legal gam
bling in Puerto Rico, suggested that the government may ban the
promotion of "products and activities deemed harmful."
Officers of the American Medical Association, which supports
such a ban, came here to enlist the backing of the ABA, which
represents 330,000 lawyers and judges nationwide.
Cigarettes are "uniquely harmful" and result in the death of
nearly 1,000 Americans a day, Dr. Robert McAfee of the AMA told
the delegates. "The toll from cigarettes alone is greater than the
annual combined sum of all deaths caused by heroin, cocaine, al
cohol, fire, automobiles, homicide, suicide and AIDS," McAfee
said.
The tobacco industry spends *2 billion a year to promote
cigarettes with the goal of addicting young people to their prod
uct, he said.
But attorneys took to the floor to argue that the Constitution
does not permit a government ban on "truthful speech about a
lawful product."
Violence returns to Guatemala
GUATEMALA CITY, Guatemala — The pattern of disappearance
and murder was distressingly familiar.
Late last month, Camilo Garcia, an impoverished hill farmer
who had settled in Guatemala City, was awaiting a local jitney
when a carload of men in civilian clothing approached. The armed
men bundled him into a car and Garcia was never heard from
again.
Two days later, Garcia's wife, Marta Odilia Raxal. and her
mother. Maria Sisimit, went looking for him. Friends say the pair
received a telegram from the police summoning them to come and
retrieve Garcia.
The women, too. disappeared, only to be found dead and buried,
half naked and suffocated, along a country road near San Jose
Poaquil, their hometown. Garcia's fate is still unknown.
The incident recalls numerous death-squad style killings in
Guatemala during the last decade, the kind of atrocity that was
supposed to have ended with the accession of Vinicio Cerezo, a ci
vilian. to the presidency here about 13 months ago.
France finally to try Klaus Barbie
PARIS — After four years of delay and debate. France appears
ready to try the notorious Gestapo officer Klaus Barbie for crimes
against humanity.
Many said the proceeding, now scheduled for May, could never
be held because of its ability to reopen wounds to French honor
and conscience during the World War II Nazi occupation.
Barbie. 73, was extradited from Bolivia in February 1983 and
imprisoned in Lyons, where from 1942 to 1944 he ran a Gestapo
unit in charge of repressing the anti-Nazi underground. His
brutality against French Resistance leaders and Jews during
those years earned him a reputation as "the butcher of Lyons."
His job also put him at the center of a struggle matching
Frenchmen in the Resistance against those who cooperated with
Nazi occupation authorities and France's own collaborationist
government in Vichy. Memories of who did what during that per
iod have remained an important theme in French political and so
cial life 40 years later.
Polish subway project continues
WARSAW, Poland — Deep below downtown Warsaw lies a wine
cellar that is the only trace of the city's first attempt to build a sub
way.
Started in 1951. the subway was planned with Soviet help and
designed to double as a shelter in case of nuclear war. After two
years, it was abandoned. Authorities said there were geological
problems, but in fact there was no more money.
"It was too expensive." said Tadeusz Romanowski, whose first
Job out of college was to help prepare the drawings for that ill-fated
project. "The economic situation was awful, so they stopped."
Poland's economic situation is still troubled today, but the gov
ernment is funneling billions of zlotys into Metroprojekt. a new ef
fort to turn the subway dream into reality. Romanowski is the new
project's construction manager.
Reality may be take longer than expected. Poland has been
forced to cut back on spending for the showcase project, as it has
been forced to cut back on the construction of badly needed
housing and other projects.

Polish subway project continues
WARSAW, Poland — Deep below downtown Warsaw lies a wine
cellar that is the only trace of the city's first attempt to build a sub
way.
Started in 1951. the subway was planned with Soviet help and
designed to double as a shelter in case of nuclear war. After two
years, it was abandoned. Authorities said there were geological
problems, but in fact there was no more money.
"It was too expensive." said Tadeusz Romanowski, whose first
Job out of college was to help prepare the drawings for that ill-fated
project. "The economic situation was awful, so they stopped."
Poland's economic situation is still troubled today, but the gov
ernment is funneling billions of zlotys into Metroprojekt. a new ef
fort to turn the subway dream into reality. Romanowski is the new
project's construction manager.
Reality may be take longer than expected. Poland has been
forced to cut back on spending for the showcase project, as it has
been forced to cut back on the construction of badly needed
housing and other projects.

Gorbachev: Reforms 'irreversible'
MOSCOW — Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev told an interna
tional peace gathering here yesterday that "the broad
democratization" of Soviet society "is irreversible" and, at the
same time, he charged the Reagan administration with attempt
ing to scrap the 1972 U.S.-Soviet treaty banning antiballistlc
missile defenses.
Addressing a crowd of about 850 visiting Americans and other
foreigners and Soviets. Gorbachev used the occasion to boost
Moscow's recent domestic and foreign policy initiatives and un
dercut what he sees as Western prejudices against the Soviet Un
ion and Soviet motives behind its reform drive.
"You have arrived in the Soviet Union when essentially revolu
tionary changes are under way," he told an audience including
hundreds of western celebrities, film stars, economists,
physicians and businessmen who were brought here at Soviet ex
pense for the three-day meeting. "It is often said — we still hear it
— that there is some threat stemming from the U.S.S.R," he said,
"a Soviet threat to peace and freedom."
"But we want to be understood," he added, "and we hope that
the world community will at last acknowledge that our desire to
make our country better will hurt no one, with the world only
gaining from this."
"And I must disappoint those who think that this has been the
result of pressure on us from the West, that we want to gain some
body's fancy in pursuit of ulterior motives." he said, insisting that
the changes were in accordance with "socialist choice."
Counterterrorism helped North
WASHINGTON — In January 1986, about the same time that
President Reagan was signing an authorization for U.S. arms
sales to what his administration officially defined as the "terrorist
state" of Iran, Marine Lt. Col. Oliver North became co-chairman of
a small group that coordinated the government's counterter
rorism efforts at the National Security Council.
Creation of the lnter-governmental "Operations Sub-Group"
(OSG), which met at the National Security Council, had long been
one of North's goals. And that year he got another wish: He was
put in charge of a new unit on terrorism within the NSC, with two
military officers and two secretaries working for him in renovated,
ultra-secure offices.
According to congressional and other investigators of the Iran
contra affair, it is clear in retrospect that the administration's
counterterrorism program was instrumental in helping North in
crease his power and independence within the NSC. Officials who
are familiar with his work in that area say North made counterter
rorism "his turf."
ABA supports tobacco advertising
NEW ORLEANS — The American Bar Association yesterday
refused to support a proposed prohibition on cigarette advertising
in magazines, newspapers and on billboards, giving the tobacco
companies a boost in their attempt to head off congressional pas
sage of such a ban.
The proposed ban gained steam last July, when the Supreme
Court, in a ruling that prohibited the advertising of legal gam
bling in Puerto Rico, suggested that the government may ban the
promotion of "products and activities deemed harmful."
Officers of the American Medical Association, which supports
such a ban, came here to enlist the backing of the ABA, which
represents 330,000 lawyers and judges nationwide.
Cigarettes are "uniquely harmful" and result in the death of
nearly 1,000 Americans a day, Dr. Robert McAfee of the AMA told
the delegates. "The toll from cigarettes alone is greater than the
annual combined sum of all deaths caused by heroin, cocaine, al
cohol, fire, automobiles, homicide, suicide and AIDS," McAfee
said.
The tobacco industry spends *2 billion a year to promote
cigarettes with the goal of addicting young people to their prod
uct, he said.
But attorneys took to the floor to argue that the Constitution
does not permit a government ban on "truthful speech about a
lawful product."
Violence returns to Guatemala
GUATEMALA CITY, Guatemala — The pattern of disappearance
and murder was distressingly familiar.
Late last month, Camilo Garcia, an impoverished hill farmer
who had settled in Guatemala City, was awaiting a local jitney
when a carload of men in civilian clothing approached. The armed
men bundled him into a car and Garcia was never heard from
again.
Two days later, Garcia's wife, Marta Odilia Raxal. and her
mother. Maria Sisimit, went looking for him. Friends say the pair
received a telegram from the police summoning them to come and
retrieve Garcia.
The women, too. disappeared, only to be found dead and buried,
half naked and suffocated, along a country road near San Jose
Poaquil, their hometown. Garcia's fate is still unknown.
The incident recalls numerous death-squad style killings in
Guatemala during the last decade, the kind of atrocity that was
supposed to have ended with the accession of Vinicio Cerezo, a ci
vilian. to the presidency here about 13 months ago.
France finally to try Klaus Barbie
PARIS — After four years of delay and debate. France appears
ready to try the notorious Gestapo officer Klaus Barbie for crimes
against humanity.
Many said the proceeding, now scheduled for May, could never
be held because of its ability to reopen wounds to French honor
and conscience during the World War II Nazi occupation.
