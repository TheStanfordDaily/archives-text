# Senate to discuss censure action

### DAN DeLUCE RUSSELL KOROBKIN Editorial staff 
The Faculty Senate will consider tomorrow a mo
tion to censure Hoover Institution Director W. Glenn
Campbell for claiming that the location of the
Reagan Library on campus allows the University to
"boast" of its "Reagan connection."
The final wording of the motion was approved yes
terday by the Steering Committee of the Faculty Sen
ate and distributed to all senators. The Steering
Committee sets the agenda for the full senate.
"Such public statements by a University officer
run counter to the non-partisan rationale offered by
the Board of Trustees for siting the Reagan Presiden
tial Library on this campus," according to the mo
tion.
The motion further states that the acceptance of
the library "reflects the Importance of Mr. Reagan's
presidency for American and world history. In no
way, however, does the offer represent a collective po
sition either endorsing or condemning the person or
the policies of Mr. Reagan."
According to Kenneth Arrow, economics professor
and chair of the senate, the committee wanted "to
make it clear that the acceptance of the Reagan Li
brary is not an honoring of the president." Presiden
tial libraries do not represent "a value judgment (on a
particular presidency)," he added.
The Steering Committee also submitted a resolu
tion to the senate that requests a presentation "in
the near future" of the architectural plans for the li
brary, and asks the University Administration to
guarantee "substantial Academic Council represen
tation In the processes by which decisions about the
use of the (library's) facilities are made."
English Prof. Ronald Rebholz agreed with the
censure of Campbell's comments, but said the
second motion is too weak. He said he will probably
propose an additional motion tomorrow specifically
calling for a scaling down of the library's proposed
design, which he called "too grand."
