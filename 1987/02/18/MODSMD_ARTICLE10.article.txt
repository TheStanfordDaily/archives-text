# Candidate for CIA post grilled

### 
WASHINGTON - Robert Gates.
President Reagan's nominee to be
director of the Central Intelligence
Agency, said yesterday that he did
not inform Congress about the
possible diversion of money from
the Iranian arms sale to aid the
Nicaraguan contras because he
had "worrisome but extraor
dinarily flimsy" evidence.
Gates' testimony at his con
firmation hearing before the Sen
ate Select Committee on Intelli
gence prompted sharp and skepti
cal questioning by the panel, par
ticularly from Sen. Arlen Specter,
R-Pa., who expressed "reserva
tions" about the nomination and
"serious concerns" about Gates'
role in the Iran-contra affair.
Another Republican, Sen.
William Cohen of Maine, was even
harsher in criticizing Gates' insis
tence that he had only scant
knowledge of the affair. Cohen
described the 43-year-old Gates,
currently the CIA deputy director,
as "an ambitious young man,
type-A personality, climbing the
ladder of success. You basically
didn't want to rock the boat. You
were not prepared to lay your

career on the line over a matter
you did not create. You didn't
want to know about It."
Gates sought to distance him
self from his predecessor, William
Casey, by saying that had he been
Central intelligence Agency direc
tor and known what he knows
now, he "probably would have"
opposed Reagan's decision to sell
arms to Iran. Casey, a key figure
in the Iran-contra affair, resigned
Feb. 2 after undergoing surgery
for a brain tumor.
Gates said that although there
was "no formal division of labor"
between himself and Casey, "In
fact there was an informal divi
sion" and that Casey "took the
lead on Iran and Central America
and I took the lead on other is
sues." When Sen. John Warner, R-
Va., said he understood that
Gates and Casey had "close per
sonal and professional ties," Gates
replied that it was "primarily a
close professional relationship."
In retrospect, Gates said, the
ClA's "biggest mistake" was
failing to inform Congress about
the arms sales to Iran. But Gates
then defended Reagan's "consti
tutional authority" not to notify

Congress about covert actions, le
gal requirements notwithstand

fair.
"The entire undertaking was a
unique activity that we are all de
termined not to repeat," Gates
said during a full day of hearings
that are scheduled to continue
today. "Even so. we have learned
important lessons for the future."
Gates noted that since becom
ing acting CIA director he has or
dered an investigation of the
agency's operations in Central
America by the CIA inspector gen
eral and disciplined the station
chief In Costa Rica for Improper
contacts with the contras, who are
fighting the government of
Nicaragua.

questioned Gates about a number
of controversial issues that have
arisen from the ClA's role in the
Iran-contra scandal, including the
administration's assertion at one
point that "oral findings" are as
valid as written presidential aut
horizations of covert action.
Gates said that while "a strong
legal case" could be made for such
oral orders. "I would not proceed
on the basis of an oral finding." In
cases that demanded "instant ac
tions," Gates added, he would be
"willing to proceed on the basis of
an oral finding from the presi
dent" but would "immediately"
ask for the order in writing.
But as senators focused on
Gates' role in the Iran-contra af
fair, and particularly his Dec. 4
testimony before the committee, a
majority were clearly dissatisfied
with his explanations as well as
his conception of the job.

WASHINGTON - Robert Gates.
President Reagan's nominee to be
director of the Central Intelligence
Agency, said yesterday that he did
not inform Congress about the
possible diversion of money from
the Iranian arms sale to aid the
Nicaraguan contras because he
had "worrisome but extraor
dinarily flimsy" evidence.
Gates' testimony at his con
firmation hearing before the Sen
ate Select Committee on Intelli
gence prompted sharp and skepti
cal questioning by the panel, par
ticularly from Sen. Arlen Specter,
R-Pa., who expressed "reserva
tions" about the nomination and
"serious concerns" about Gates'
role in the Iran-contra affair.
Another Republican, Sen.
William Cohen of Maine, was even
harsher in criticizing Gates' insis
tence that he had only scant
knowledge of the affair. Cohen
described the 43-year-old Gates,
currently the CIA deputy director,
as "an ambitious young man,
type-A personality, climbing the
ladder of success. You basically
didn't want to rock the boat. You
were not prepared to lay your

career on the line over a matter
you did not create. You didn't
want to know about It."
Gates sought to distance him
self from his predecessor, William
Casey, by saying that had he been
Central intelligence Agency direc
tor and known what he knows
