# White House vacancies abound

WASHINGTON - White House Chief of Staff
Donald Regan, under fire for managerial
shortcomings from Republican politicians and
First Lady Nancy Reagan, is finding it increas
ingly difficult to fill the growing number of
vacancies on the White House staff.
Two well-informed sources said yesterday
that the first lady is no longer speaking to
Regan, whose replacement she has been ur
ging since December. The sources said that
President Reagan has not indicated any
change in his commitment to keep Regan, but
said the chief of staff might leave on his own
within the next few weeks if he concludes that
it would benefit the president.
"The consensus has firmed that Regan's
demise is inevitable," said one Republican
source close to the administration. "There is
virtually unanimous consensus on the hill and
in the Washington political community that
the sooner Regan departs the more opportu
nity there is to rejuvenate the last period of the
Reagan presidency."
Regan, who acknowledges that he supported
the president's clandestine arms sale to Iran,
has been virtually invisible in Washington
since he held a news conference in mid-
December after testifying before the Senate In
telligence Committee. Yesterday, he said

through a spokesman that he talked "virtually
dally" to the first lady but otherwise declined to
respond to criticisms about him or reports
that he would leave.
White House and Republican sources said
yesterday that Regan was encountering diffi
culty in trying to fill the job of White House po
litical director. The job will soon be vacated by
Mitchell Daniels, who resigned two months
after he urged Regan to quit and allow the
president to make "a fresh start."
These sources said that Regan was prepared
to offer the political director's job to Frank
Donatelli, a conservative Washington attorney
who was a regional director in the 1980
Reagan campaign and has close ties to Trea
sury Secretary James Baker.
Donatelli was the second choice for the job,
which was rejected last week by Stuart Spen
cer, a longtime friend and political adviser of
the Reagans.
Last month, John Cogan, the number two
official at the Hoover Institution, turned down
an offer to head the White House Office of
Policy Development, a post subsequently filled
by Gary Bauer, an assistant at the Department
of Education.
These sources also said that Regan has "not
settled" on a replacement for White House

communications director Patrick Buchanan,
who resigned earlier this month. Marl Maseng,
the White House director of public liaison,
which reports to Buchanan, has been inter
viewed for the post.
Most of the prospective appointees are less
well-known than those they are replacing. A
widespread judgment inside the administra
tion, expressed yesterday in the White House
Notebook of the nonpartisan National Journal,
is "that the White House staff, during Reagan's
remaining years, will largely be a haven fcr
people hoping to make names for themselves,
rather than those who already have."
In part, officials say the difficulty of filling
White House jobs is a normal consequence of
declining vitality in an administration enter
ing its final two years. This has been com
pounded by a disinclination of some prospec
tive appointees to join an administration that
is wracked by investigations into the Iran
contra affair.
But sources said that some who have been
approached to join the White House staff are
reluctant to work under Regan's hierarchical
system. Others say they are concerned about
being hired by Regan without knowing if he
will stay.
