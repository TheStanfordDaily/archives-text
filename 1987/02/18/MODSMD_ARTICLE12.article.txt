# Offices not top priority
## 
### TOM OSCHERWITZ Staff writer 
There Is no end in sight to the current
student office space crunch, University
administrators said last night.
A large contlgent of students from the
Asian American Student Association
(AASA) attended a forum on student office
space, and they expressed the need for a
private cultural center. But Dean of Stu
dent Affairs James Lyons said he "could
not accept carte blanche" a request by a
student organization for a building of its
own.
Any new construction, such as an addi
tion on the patio area of Tresidder Union,
will take four years to complete, according
to Asst. Provost John Hughes. It takes two
years to raise the funds and two years to
construct the building, Hughes said.
The need for office and meeting space
does not currently top the University's list
of funding priorities, Lyons said. Aca
demic needs, the desire to maintain a
need-blind admissions policy and concern
over the development of the University's
humanities programs all have higher
priorities than student office space. Lyons
said.
But Lyons added that the development
of the Near West Campus will aid student
organizations by freeing up space in the
central campus that is currently occupied
by University departments.

Hughes added that funding, the
availability of the land and time are the
three central factors limiting student
space needs.
"Space is a more precious commodity
than money on this campus." Hughes
said.
According to Vivian Wu. AASA member
and ASSU senator, the AASA cannot ade
quately serve the 2,000 members of the
Asian community from Its current
headquarters in the Old Firehouse.
Wu said the makeshift walls,
dilapidated furniture and crowded condi
tions deter students from using their
alotted space as a cultural center.
"Yes, we agree that Old Firehouse is fall
ing apart, but we just don't have the funds
to take care of it," said Juan Yniguez, asst.
dean of Tresidder Union.
The entire organization is dependent on
student staff members who have their
own academic responsibilities, she said.
According to Stuart Reges, asst. chair
man of the Computer Science Depart
ment, the gay community considers the
privacy that a building like the Old
Firehouse affords as an essential In
gredient for its student office spaces.
Student leaders also said 24-hour
access, space for the long-term storage of
records and equipment, a photocopier
and a phone were among their office
needs.
