Clues as to how certain tumor
promoting chemical compounds aid car
cinogens in the developement of cancer
have recently been discovered by
Chemistry Prof. Paul Wender.
Although carcinogens cause the ini
tial genetic mutation of a normal cell,
Wender said, it is chemicals known as
tumor promoters that actually regulate
the growth of cancerous tissue.
In the absence of tumor promoters, a
mutation is usually relatively harmless
because special enzymes either repair
the cell or it dies a natural death,
Wender said.
Tumor promoters increase the growth
rate of genetically altered cells, promot
ing the development of a cancerous
tumor, he said. Tumor promoters prob
ably interfere with the body's normal
"stop growth" messages to the damaged
cell, allowing it to grow unchecked, he
said.
"The overall intent of our studies is to
map out the molecular events that lead
to tumors," Wender said, adding that
understanding the way in which
molecules cause cancer could help scien
tists find ways to control it. "We may
eventually be able to find compounds
that inhibit the action of these
promoters.
"We have, as a society, been very con

cerned about identifying carcinogens,
but we haven't been as concerned with
identifying other risk factors (involved
in the development of cancer)." Wender
said. He said tumor promoters are one
such risk factor.
AP tumor promoters activate an
enzy.ne called protein kinase C (PKC),
Wender said. PKC is a critical enzyme
thai regulates the formation of can
cerous tumors. Wender said he is study
ing how and why this enzyme Is activa
ted by the tumor promoters. Ex
perimenting on animals. Wender is in
vestigating how tumor promoters bind
to PKC.
Phorbol esters, chemical compounds
derived from plants, have been the most
studied and most important tumor
promoters, according to Wender.
Recently, however, many chemical com
pounds that are structurally very differ
ent from phorbol esters have been found
to have the same tumor-promoting ef
fect. he said.
Using computers and a technique
called X-ray crystallography. Wender has
discovered that the tumor-regulating
enzyme PKC only recognizes the part of
a tumor promoter that is the same in all
tumor promoters. The PKC enzyme thus
sees the very different tumor-promoting
compounds as being one and the same,
Wender said.
Expanding on this discovery, Wender
has synthesized new organic com

pounds with structural features that the
tumor promoters have In common.
After verifying that he has now de
signed molecules that can bind to the
enzyme PKC. Wender said the next step
is to study differences in how various
tumor promoters affect the PKC enzyme.
According to Wender. tumor promo
ters are encouraged by a variety of fac
tors. including lime oil. honey, cigarette
smoke, chemicals released by bacteria
and phenol, a compound contained in
numerous over-the-counter medica
tions.
Wender said the unexpectedly strong
response of some people to cigarette
smoke can be explained by the dual ac
tion of the smoke both as a carcinogen
and as a tumor promoter.
About 95 percent of tumor promoters
act as skin irritants. Wender said. The
tumor promoter Teleocidin. for example,
is produced by blue-green algae and is
responsible for swimmer's itch experi
enced by swimmers in ocean water when
the algae bloom.
As research on tumor promoters con
tinues, "we will be in a better position to
minimize people's exposure to them,"
Wender said. He added that research on
the molecular mechanism of tumor
promotion could eventually aid in the
development of cancer-inhibiting chem
icals.

enzyme PKC. Wender said the next step
is to study differences in how various
tumor promoters affect the PKC enzyme.
According to Wender. tumor promo
ters are encouraged by a variety of fac
tors. including lime oil. honey, cigarette
smoke, chemicals released by bacteria
and phenol, a compound contained in
numerous over-the-counter medica
tions.
Wender said the unexpectedly strong
response of some people to cigarette
smoke can be explained by the dual ac
tion of the smoke both as a carcinogen
and as a tumor promoter.
About 95 percent of tumor promoters
act as skin irritants. Wender said. The
tumor promoter Teleocidin. for example,
is produced by blue-green algae and is
responsible for swimmer's itch experi
enced by swimmers in ocean water when
the algae bloom.
As research on tumor promoters con
tinues, "we will be in a better position to
minimize people's exposure to them,"
Wender said. He added that research on
the molecular mechanism of tumor
promotion could eventually aid in the
development of cancer-inhibiting chem
icals.
