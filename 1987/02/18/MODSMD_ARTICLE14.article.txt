Last week the Board of Trustees approved
a 1986-87 Athletic Department budget that
Includes a *300,000 "one-time" contribution
from University general funds to reduce the
department's deficit of *375,000. Athletic
Director Andy Geiger told The Daily he Is
working on details to include future support
from general funds in the athletics budget.
While the gift may be advisable as an emer
gency measure, the University should reject
the idea of using general funds to support
the Athletic Department on a regular basis.
Geiger has said that without University as
sistance sports that do not receive scholar
ships can no longer be supported by the de
partment's income from football and contri
butions. While every effort should be made to
avoid the elimination of these sports, a solu
tion to the department's financial problems
should not be achieved by granting monetary
support that the vast majority of student or
ganizations throughout the University are
denied.
By regularly subsidizing the Athletic De
partment, the University would be, in effect,
contributing money to all teams that don't
raise enough revenue to pay for their travel
and equipment expenses. If these teams
deserve University support, then so does
every group — from the ultimate frishee team

to campus political organizations — which
receives little or no funding from University
general funds.
When the Athletic Department is strapped
for money, as it is now, there is no reason
why varsity teams shouldn't reduce their
reliance on department funds by raising
some of the money they need, just as club
sports and other campus groups do regu
larly. Last summer, the water polo team
raised enough money to tour Europe. Those
dollars could have been used to cover costs of
traveling to matches.
If the University sets a precedent of giving
general funds to athletics, it will be difficult
to keep budgets of individual teams at
reasonable levels. Each team will certainly be
able to justify a need for new and better
equipment or more road trips. With the Uni
versity acting as a safety net for the Athletic
Department, there will be no incentive for
the department to critically evaluate such re
quests.
Athletic teams are a valuable part of the
University, but they should not be entitled to
special privileges. The Athletic Department
should look to internal measures to solve its
budgetary problems rather than asking for
an annual University bail-out.
