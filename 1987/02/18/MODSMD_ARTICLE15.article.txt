# Exam survival guide
## 
### 
You've seen them in bookstores, among "how-to"
manuals of different sizes and colors. There's always
a section of them — those how-to-study books. You
know, the books that explain, step by step, how to do
all the reading, hand in assignments on time, get
eight hours of sleep, and still have time to floss your
teeth in the morning. These books are written by ex
perts, by those hallowed few who aced every midterm
they ever took.
Unfortunately, these books do me no good what
soever. The authors of these tomes know nothing
about the last-minute cram, cannot counsel me on
the 4 a.m. disk failure and do not describe the panic
that sets in when you discover that you don't remem
ber the professor's name and it's worth two points on
the test. How-to-study books are written for people
who already know how to and want to pat themselves
on the back. For what it's worth, I thought I'd offer
my own set of guidelines on how-to-midterm:

1. Do not assume that the word "midterm" means
"an exam that occurs in the middle of the term."
They rarely do. Anyone who has taken Chem. 31 un
derstands this. The word "midterm" comes from the
tendency of these exams to catch you in mid-stride,
as you're strolling along in ignorant bliss, and hurl
you headfirst onto the ground.
2. Put off all your studying until the night before
the exam. This way the material will all be fresh in
your mind. The human brain is like a full box — the
last things you cram into it will be the first to tumble
out. Because of this phenomenon, avoid talking to
people before the exam or all your knowledge will
come spilling out.
3. When you need a break from studying, go to the
library and watch people climb the walls. Better yet,
bring a Twinkle with you and eat it in front of a libra
rian.
4. Stress. Go ahead, you're going to do it anyway
so you might as well get it over with. Anyone who
says. "Don't stress!" might as well say, "Don't sweat!"
or "Don't get wet when it's raining!" The best thing
to do is get it out of your system before the test. Pent

up stress can lead to dizziness, leg cramps and an
urge to run yodeling through White Plaza.
5. Avoid highlighters. If God had meant typed
print to be florescent yellow, He would have colored it
himself. Instead, get a thick black marker and delete
all the unimportant material. Textbooks are always
full of unnecessary fluff. Of course, selling these
books back to the Bookstore may be a bit tricky.
6. Go to Green Library when you are finished
studying and sit in one of the padded chairs. You'll
be asleep in seconds and your roommate can't wake
you up with her favorite Iron Maiden album.
7. Never study with anyone smarter than you are.
It's not good for the ego or the id. This friend of mine
called me yesterday with a fantastic idea. "Look," she
said. "I have a fantastic idea. We'll study together. I'll
impress you with my intelligence, and you'll crawl
home feeling like a retarded banana slug. What do
you say?"
8. Never look at last year's midterm. Live in the
present.
9. Never ask TAs about the test. I once asked a TA
about a review question.
"How am I supposed to know what this means?" I
asked, pointing to part of the first question.
"That's the title of the text," he answered.
10. Leave your calculator and pencils in your room
when you go to take the test. There is nothing like a
quick sprint from the Physics tank to Wilbur and
back again to get your neurons snapping.
11. Flip through the entire test before you begin
and calculate just how badly you're going to do.
Check to make sure your exam is written in English.
Foreign language teachers are always trying to pull
funny stuff.
12. Bluff. Any answer is better than no answer at
all. Write down interesting things the professor
might want to know: the population of Westerville,
Ohio; the volume of a four-dimensional basketball;
anything.
These are my top 12 tips for the midterm season.
Above all, remember that midterms are only fragile
pieces of paper. I once took a midterm that giggled
maliciously at me for an entire hour. It knew I didn't
know anything, I knew I didn't know anything, but It
was damn hard trying to make up answers as It
chuckled to Itself. When I got it back the next week. I
burned it. She who laughs last laughs best.

It's not good for the ego or the id. This friend of mine
called me yesterday with a fantastic idea. "Look," she
said. "I have a fantastic idea. We'll study together. I'll
impress you with my intelligence, and you'll crawl
home feeling like a retarded banana slug. What do
you say?"
8. Never look at last year's midterm. Live in the
present.
9. Never ask TAs about the test. I once asked a TA
about a review question.
"How am I supposed to know what this means?" I
asked, pointing to part of the first question.
"That's the title of the text," he answered.
10. Leave your calculator and pencils in your room
when you go to take the test. There is nothing like a
quick sprint from the Physics tank to Wilbur and
back again to get your neurons snapping.
11. Flip through the entire test before you begin
and calculate just how badly you're going to do.
Check to make sure your exam is written in English.
Foreign language teachers are always trying to pull
funny stuff.
12. Bluff. Any answer is better than no answer at
all. Write down interesting things the professor
might want to know: the population of Westerville,
Ohio; the volume of a four-dimensional basketball;
anything.
These are my top 12 tips for the midterm season.
Above all, remember that midterms are only fragile
pieces of paper. I once took a midterm that giggled
maliciously at me for an entire hour. It knew I didn't
know anything, I knew I didn't know anything, but It
was damn hard trying to make up answers as It
chuckled to Itself. When I got it back the next week. I
burned it. She who laughs last laughs best.

You've seen them in bookstores, among "how-to"
manuals of different sizes and colors. There's always
a section of them — those how-to-study books. You
know, the books that explain, step by step, how to do
all the reading, hand in assignments on time, get
eight hours of sleep, and still have time to floss your
teeth in the morning. These books are written by ex
perts, by those hallowed few who aced every midterm
they ever took.
Unfortunately, these books do me no good what
soever. The authors of these tomes know nothing
about the last-minute cram, cannot counsel me on
the 4 a.m. disk failure and do not describe the panic
that sets in when you discover that you don't remem
ber the professor's name and it's worth two points on
the test. How-to-study books are written for people
who already know how to and want to pat themselves
on the back. For what it's worth, I thought I'd offer
my own set of guidelines on how-to-midterm:

1. Do not assume that the word "midterm" means
"an exam that occurs in the middle of the term."
They rarely do. Anyone who has taken Chem. 31 un
derstands this. The word "midterm" comes from the
tendency of these exams to catch you in mid-stride,
as you're strolling along in ignorant bliss, and hurl
you headfirst onto the ground.
2. Put off all your studying until the night before
the exam. This way the material will all be fresh in
your mind. The human brain is like a full box — the
last things you cram into it will be the first to tumble
out. Because of this phenomenon, avoid talking to
people before the exam or all your knowledge will
come spilling out.
3. When you need a break from studying, go to the
library and watch people climb the walls. Better yet,
bring a Twinkle with you and eat it in front of a libra
rian.
4. Stress. Go ahead, you're going to do it anyway
so you might as well get it over with. Anyone who
says. "Don't stress!" might as well say, "Don't sweat!"
or "Don't get wet when it's raining!" The best thing
to do is get it out of your system before the test. Pent

up stress can lead to dizziness, leg cramps and an
urge to run yodeling through White Plaza.
5. Avoid highlighters. If God had meant typed
print to be florescent yellow, He would have colored it
himself. Instead, get a thick black marker and delete
all the unimportant material. Textbooks are always
full of unnecessary fluff. Of course, selling these
books back to the Bookstore may be a bit tricky.
6. Go to Green Library when you are finished
studying and sit in one of the padded chairs. You'll
be asleep in seconds and your roommate can't wake
you up with her favorite Iron Maiden album.
7. Never study with anyone smarter than you are.
It's not good for the ego or the id. This friend of mine
called me yesterday with a fantastic idea. "Look," she
said. "I have a fantastic idea. We'll study together. I'll
impress you with my intelligence, and you'll crawl
home feeling like a retarded banana slug. What do
you say?"

present.
