# Isolationism is not the issue
## 
### 
Paula Simon's column (Daily. Feb. 12) on the
need for the United States to avoid "iso
lationism" raises some very important issues,
but her terms for the problem hang in the air
unanalyzed, like free-floating question marks.
What is this language? What are we to make of
potential "isolationism"? What does its oppo
site, "internationalism." really mean in U.S.
foreign policy? Despite Simons' tidy conclu
sion, Jesse Jackson and Caspar Weinberger
share precious little common ground on this
score. And Simons' approach to it obscures the
questions that most need asking.

Avoid isolation? For the past six years we
have seen nothing if not an intensely activist
American foreign policy. From Latin Ameri
can. Caribbean. African, Middle Eastern, and
South Asian military and political interven
tions to the re-missiling of Western Europe to
the pursuit of "free market" structures in the
world economy.
Just what you think about any aspect (or the
overall shape) of the policy depends to no small
extent on your ideology. For some, these have
been the new halcyon days that re-established
our claims to political and moral greatness in
the world. To others it has been a shameful era
of knee-jerk U.S. interventionism and im
perialism that Is reaping a harvest of ill will
and troubles. For many in between, the legacy
of the Reagan doctrine years remains ambigu
ous.
But now American foreign policy Is implod
ing: Its elaborate structure Is collapsing In on

itself. It is imploding from a scandal of il
legalities and deceptions (Iran-aragua-who
knew-what-when-gate). It Is imploding from
weaknesses of the policies themselves:
"constructive engagement" with South Africa,
peacekeeping and establishing order In
Lebanon, "no negotiation with terrorists" and
the search for Iranian "moderates." Other
policies like contra aid are hotly debated, but
those listed above have failed on their own
terms, calling the terms themselves into ques
tion. And it is imploding because even though
President Reagan is ultimately responsible for
his foreign policy, nobody has been effectively
overseeing its totality.
Nobody since Secretary of State Alexander
Haig has had the temerity, let alone the actual
ability, to venture that he or she is "in charge
here" — and Halg realized he was wrong. For
get his famous verbal gaffe; when he saw that
foreign policy planning was getting out of his
— or any one person's — control during the
first Reagan administration, he quit. Our
scandal Is new. but foreign policy planning has
been adrift for some time.
Simon's call to avoid isolationism unfortun
ately has little to say about these fundamental
problems. The Canadians, Britons. Germans
and others aren't upset because a scandal has
untracked American internationalism. The
"crisis of confidence" has arisen because the
scandal all too plainly exposed the content of
our internationalism. It has been riddled with
major contradictions between principle and
practice in some cases. In other cases it has
winked at. sidestepped, or broken the law in
secret pursuance of contentious, narrowly
ideological goals.
The Iran scandal revealed to allied govern

ments that the U.S. administration for a few
years now has been secretly undermining ob
jectives that it had agreed to follow up on. It
exposed the sloppy and uncoordinated way by
which foreign policy has been made here.
You bet there's a crisis of confidence in our
foreign policy, and well there should be. Dis
cussion couched in terms of
isolation/internationalism will do nothing to
resolve it. It's time to look at content, not follow
Ed Koch's lead and paste murals of cheerful
brownstones over gutted tenements. After all,
what should U.S. internationalism consist of?
Resolutions here lie in thinking about what
America's role in the world should be, what
kinds of relationships we want with our allies
and opponents and those in between, with the
industrial world, with the Third World and so
on. What values and interests do we want to
promote in the world? What means are accept
able for achieving foreign policy ends? Are
there limits? Is there to be frank accountabil
ity to Congress? To allies? To anyone?
It hardly needs to be asked whether the
foreign policy-making apparatus needs to be
better coordinated; its lines of authority, com
munications and responsibility streamlined. If
the foreign policy resulting from such rethink
ing wouldn't suit everyone's beliefs (probably
not mine, for instance), it would at least have a
fighting chance at being coherent.
To close with a slightly strained analogy,
foreign policies are like belly buttons: Whether
it's an "innle" or an "outie." every country's got
one. Our concern should be less about isola
tion, and far, far more about what U.S. foreign
policy tries to achieve in the world, and how.
