Execute killers
When Lowell Ungar asks in his
viewpoint (Daily, Feb. 10) if we
will be better off after a public
execution I must respond by
saying yes. Every time I read that
someone arrested for murder had
served time in prison for an ear
lier murder I am outraged that
that person was allowed to roam
free to kill again. The only certain
way to keep violent criminals
from repeating their crimes is to
execute them.
His simplistic assertion that
banning handguns will lower the
murder rate is completely false.
Many areas with strict handgun
controls have higher murder
rates than those areas with few
controls.
The fact is. as long as convicted
violent criminals are allowed back
on the streets, handguns are
necessary tools for honest per
sons to have at their disposal to
defend themselves.

The big rip-ojf
The recent decision of the
Board of Trustees to raise tuition
is a major blow to the student, a
travesty of justice and just plain
inappropriate.
Although we do not ascribe to
President Reagan's economic
policies, such as converting stu
dent lunch money into MX
missiles, we recognize that his
agenda has resulted in signifi
cantly lower inflation rates.
Therefore, as inflation has not
been a predominant part of our
recent economic environment, we
believe that our Board of Trustees
has acted irresponsibly during
our four-year stay here at Stan
ford. continually assessing tui
tion increases lrregardless of the
national rate of Inflation.
They say that this prestigious
University must attract better
faculty, remain competitive on a
national basts and continue to
provide a quality education for Its
beloved students. We contend,
however, that these tuition hikes
occur because students are all too
willing to pay them.

Therefore, we propose two
courses of action to combat this
economic injustice. First, stu
dents and parents should unite
and allow their spring quarter
tuition checks to bounce. Or. in
lieu of such action, we should
secure an agreement from the
trustees that this tuition hike
and all subsequent increases be
accompanied by equal grade infla
tion. After all, the Board of Trus
tees wants us to get our money's
worth.

Palestinians
prefer the PLO
Koleman Strumpfs recent view
point (Daily. Feb. 9) is simply
another attempt to justify Israel's
refusal to seek a just settlement
with the Palestinians.
Strumpf is right that the PLO
includes numerous groups that
are often in disagreement. But
the same is true of Israel, where
religious, political and ethnic
antagonisms have at times ex
ploded into violence, and where
extremists now threaten the dem
ocratic basis of the state.
Nevertheless, Israelis are united
in a commitment to their nation's
survival and in their recognition
of a common national identity.
The Palestinians, regardless of
their differences, have an equally
strong commitment to nation
hood and to their chosen leader
ship — the PLO.
In 1976. when Israel last per
mitted free elections on the West
Bank, PLO candidates won over
whelmingly. Israel later ousted
them and canceled all elections.
Last September, a poll by
Newsday and the Australian
Broadcasting Corporation
revealed that 93.5 percent of West
Bank Palestinians consider the
PLO to be their sole legitimate
representative, and 78.6 percent
named Yasir Arafat as their
preferred leader. Israel later ex
pelled the political science profes
sor who conducted the poll.

Strumpfs conclusion, that "it
is Israel rather than the PLO
which controls the Palestinians'
lands," and therefore "the best
Israeli (as well as U.S.) foreign
policy would be no move at all," is
dangerously shortsighted. Con
tinued refusal by Israel and the
United States to negotiate with
the Palestinians' preferred repre
sentatives means condemning
the Palestinian people to contin
ued subservience under Israeli
military rule.

Re-establish
nursing school
While my husband has been
treated for bladder cancer at the
Stanford Medical Center, I have
seen how important it is to re
start the Stanford School of Nur
sing.
Nursing is in a particular time
of crisis now. On the one hand,
our medical technology has in
creased and expanded demand
for expert nurses. On the other,
nursing, as a traditional field for
women, has seen many of those
women opt for fields with higher
remuneration.
I still believe that outstanding
young women would be attracted
to the nursing field by the name
and prestige of Stanford Univer
sity if Stanford were to restart its
School of Nursing.
It's going to take power and
money — neither of which grow
on bushes for easy picking. I
happen to believe prayer is the
greatest power in the world —
could those who care spend a few
minutes praying each day for a
School of Nursing, which would
bless so many? As to the money
— solidarity is the word — all who
care are important, and what
can't be done alone can be done
by concerned people together.
I think it's an idea whose time
has come — Stanford should once
again lead in nursing care excel
lence as it leads in excellence in
other disciplines.
