# Kennedys decide to end marriage
## 
### MICHAEL NEWMAN Editorial staff 
University President Donald Kennedy and his wife
Jeanne are separating, the couple announced yester
day.
The Kennedys released this statement to staff
members at the Hoover House, the President's Office
and the Community and Patient Relations Office at
Stanford University Hospital:
"Dear Friends and Colleagues:
"We have decided to end our marriage, though not
our enduring friendship for one another.
"We know that we can both count on you for help
in managing the transition gracefully and in retain
ing our closeness to you and to the Stanford family."
The couple was married in 1953 and came to Stan
ford in 1960. They have two daughters. Mrs. Ken
nedy currently serves as director of community and
patient relations for the Stanford Hospital.
Neither Mrs. Kennedy nor Assistant to the Presi
dent Robert Hamrdla would say yesterday whether
the Kennedys plan to get a divorce.
Hamrdla said the matter was "a very difficult one"
and called the situation "a separation."
Mrs. Kennedy said she did not feel the statement
released needed elaboration. "It stands by itself," she
said.
