## Farm hands graduates diplomas but not jobs 
### MORTY POSNER Editorial staff 
This is the second in a series of
articles about careers at Stan
ford.
Stanford is one of the Bay Area's
largest employers. But if you're a
senior, don't expect a job offer
with your diploma. Job opportu
nities for recent graduates rarely
lead to a career and turnover is
high. As a whole, Stanford does
not tend to hire its own.
Elizabeth Hiyama, the adminis
trative director of Residential
Education, echoes the sentiments
of many who hire at the Univer
sity.
"We don't give preference to
Stanford graduates. It's nice if
someone has some knowledge of
the University, but it isn't manda
tory." Hiyama said.
While Hiyama believes "the stu
dents who've worked for us are
really bright, smart people" who
would probably be capable of
handling a position within Res
Ed, she noted that "recent grad
uates don't have that many oppor
tunities to get the experience"
that Res Ed desires from its appli
cants.
Speaking at a panel sponsored
by the Career Planning and Place
ment Center on career opportuni

ties at Stanford. Michael Brltt of
the Personnel Department esti
mated that Stanford graduates
number only five to seven percent
of all University employees.
"Stanford Isn't very home
grown. We look for the best." Britt
said.
Some positions at Stanford are
made with no expectation of long
term employment.
Anne Vosti. credentials coordin
ator in the Undergraduate Admis
sions Office, said that at any one
time the office employs nine direc
tors, often recent graduates, who
go to high schools to recruit appli
cants. Vosti pointed out that the
directors only remain a few years
because of the pressure and the
repetitious nature of the job.
"It's a steppingstone position,"
Vosti said, noting that after
taking a break upon completing
their undergraduate educations,
those who have been directors of
ten go on to law, medical or busi
ness school.
A graduate degree Is required to
become a dean of admissions, so
recent graduates taking the direc
torships cannot expect to advance
without leaving first.
"They (Stanford students)
either don't apply or they don't
have what we're looking for," said
Delia Van Heyst, deputy director of

the alumni association. She
believes that Stanford students
are eager to leave campus upon
graduation.
Forty-five percent of the alumni
association's employees are Stan-

ford graduates. Van Heyst noted
that there is "more of a turnover
in our younger hires."
Many recent graduates find that
after a few years with the associa
tion they want to find work in the
corporate world. Toward this end,
the association is happy to help by

using its alumni contacts. How
ever, most recent graduates tend
to need more specialized work ex
perience (in travel or publishing)
before they apply.
For some of the association's
projects all of the staff are from
Stanford. The association hires
30 students each summer to staff
its Sierra Camp and everyone in
volved in the association's tours
are graduates.
Norm Robinson, associate dean
of Student Affairs for Residential
Education, took a job at an ac
counting firm on Wall Steet after
earning an MBA from Columbia.
He decided that he did not belong
there and came to Stanford to
study counseling psychology. He
served as a resident assistant in
Toyon Hall for two years, after
which his career at Stanford took
off.
Robinson believes that many
graduates aren't willing to start a
career at Stanford because they
see entry-level jobs as "clerical"
and because often "there isn't a
natural progression" of advance
ment.
One of the best ways to stay at
Stanford after graduating is to
have made an impression while
working as a student. Even then,
the prospect of staying more than
a few years is slim.

Few employees of Operations
and Maintenance are graduates,
but facility engineer Marty Beene
was asked to stay on after working
several years as a student in the
map and records division.
Beene noted that "as a student.
I had about three years experi
ence" in the job he was offered full
time and that it was more cost
effective to hire him than to train
someone who hRd no experience
in the department and no know
dge of Stanford.
There are many job opportuni
ties for Stanford graduates in the
Athletic Department: Senior As
soc. Director of Athletics Alan
Cummings said that "initial ex
perience and interest in the Stan
ford athletic program really starts
as an undergraduate."
As elsewhere in the University,
there are clerical, administrative
and fund-raising opportunities,
but these often fail to retain
graduates because there is "not a
direct career plan or advancement
pattern," Cummings said.
Another way to get started in a
Stanford career here is to have
been a volunteer as a student.
Career opportunities exist within
the Development Office and Stan
ford graduates often find entry
level positions with the Annual
Fund as phone associates or in

program planning if they have
helped raise funds in the past.
Being on campus is probably
the best way to find out about job
openings at Stanford, according
to employment manager Phil Wil
liams. At any given time. Williams
estimates that there are 200 to
300 job openings and about 1,500
annually. At the same time, there
are about 20,000 applicants vying
for those jobs.
The Personnel Department
serves as a central clearinghouse
of job openings, but since 1979,
University employment has been
decentralized. Application is made
to individual departments now.
with those applying for secretarial
and clerical positions having the
option to also submit their appli
cation to Personnel, where it may
be forwarded to another depart
ment if a similar opening exists.
Due to Stanford's selective
method of recruiting applicants
and advertising job openings
through newspapers, community
agencies, professional trade jour
nals and other means, the only
way to find out about all opportu
nities is to regularly check the job
listings in the personnel office or
to read the Campus Report every
week, which has all new job list
ings.
