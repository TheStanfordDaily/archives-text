# BSU leader carries big ideals and captivates crowds
## 
### MARCUS MABRY Senior staff writer 
When a capacity crowd gathered earlier
this quarter to hear the Rev. Jesse Jack
son speak at Memorial Auditorium, the
audience was expecting a rousing and ex
hilarating address — and that's just what
it got. In fact, it got two of them — one
from Jesse and one from a small but loud
black woman whom no one would have
believed was a Stanford undergraduate.
Like Jesse Jackson, that woman also
received a standing ovation, and like
Jesse Jackson, that woman continues
today a struggle started long ago in an
America much like this one.
That woman is Amanda Kemp, chair
woman of the Black Student Union (BSU).
She has been politically active since she
attended the prestigious all-female
Master's High School in Dobbs Ferry, New
York.
She speaks of dedication, commitment
and responsibility to the black commu
nity as the major motivations behind her

political and moral stands, and recalls
fantastic accomplishments as well as
paralyzing fears as parts of her Stanford
experience.
Viewing her today as one of the
foremost leaders of Stanford's black com
munity, it would be hard to imagine that
when she arrived on campus two years
ago Kemp was "intimidated."
"Living in Florence Moore and par
ticipating in the SLE program my fresh
man year, I wasn't exactly running into
thousands, or even tens, of black people
every day," she said.
"Even though I (became) the leader of
the Black Liberation Month committee. I
wasn't sure how the black community
would accept me. So, I made an effort to
get out and meet people," Kemp added.
The insecurities she felt upon arrival at
Stanford were part of a larger insecurity
— the insecurity of racial identity.
After attending an elite, predominantly
white private institution, Kemp felt the
same doubts that many other black stu
dents report concerning their true iden

tity and community.
"There's a contradiction (in my life),"
Kemp explained. "I'm poor and come from
the inner city — that's one part of me.
"But I did attend that elite school for
four years and it was the most stable time
of my life. So. it became 'home,' in a
sense, to me, but it could never really be
home because it wasn't my world," she
said.
"I have always felt a responsibility, an
obligation and a link to the black commu
nity; but at the same time 1 have opportu
nities before me that they (the majority of
the people living there) don't," Kemp said.
"A lot of times that causes them to be
suspicious of me," she added. "People
wonder if you're going to make them feel
like shit, or if you think you're better than
they are.
"When I got to Stanford, I wondered if
everyone would be from the inner city and
distrust me for my boarding school back
ground or if they would all be from upper
middle class backgrounds — and I'm
definitely not that," Kemp said.

"So I felt alienated from the start —
alienated from the black community,
from my dorm, from everyone. I was de
pressed most of my freshman year." she
recalled.
It took the interest of a friend, the inspi
ration of the activists who participated in
the March for Peace. Justice and Jobs
and Jesse Jackson's convention speech to
turn her around. While participating in
the march. Kemp said she was over
whelmed by the enthusiasm and the
power of the people there. She claims that
they showed her it was "OK to be loud and
OK to care." After that there was no stop
ping her.
That year. Kemp became one of the
founding members of Stanford Out of
South Africa (SOSA).
Her sophomore year, Kemp became sec
retary of the BSU, participated on the
South Africa Committee, the Police
Brutality Rally, a women's caucus, the
People's Platform and was assistant to the
