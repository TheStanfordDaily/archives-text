## Stoppard's 'Real Thing' has wit and emotion 
### JAMES R. DICKEY Editorial staff 
Tom Stoppard has finally put an end to critics' ar
guments that he can only create intellectual exer
cises of wit and comedy. With "The Real Thing."
Stoppard has invented an emotionally charged, witty
and interesting drama.
The Real Thing,'' winner of the Tony Award for
Best Play. Is now being performed by the American
Conservatory Theatre in San Francisco. It Is the
story of a writer (Mark Harellk) and his stormy life
while he attempts to understand and come to terms
with his own emotions.
Harellk. a playwright himself, spares no energy in
bringing Henry, the writer, to life. His performance
is charged with excitement and concern. The love
scenes and argument scenes are equally believable,
thanks to his performance.
The opening scene sets the pace for the play with a
polite but meaningful outburst by Max (Rick Hamil
ton) toward his supposedly unfaithful wife, Char
lotte. Unforgettable phrases like. "Save the gerund,
screw the whale!" are scattered throughout the scene
like confetti.
The witty dialogue and banter that ensues is a
pleasing introduction to the tone of the work as a
whole, but in true Stoppard style, it is soon revealed
that the scene Is merely part of a play Henry has writ
ten in which his wife Charlotte and his friend Max
are performing.
In the next scene Stoppard reveals the myriad emo
tional relationships with which he will confront the
viewer. Into Henry and Charlotte's not-so-happy
home march Max and his wife Annie. Once again,
Stoppard shows his talent through the mixed metap

hors and word games resplendent In the dialogue.
The scene unfolds to show Henry in the dilemma of
picking just the right songs for a radio show he Is to
be a guest on — a good example of the types of efforts
that absorb most of Henry's attentions. The scene
also reveals the Illicit relationship between Henry
and Annie, Max's wife.
Annie is played beautifully by Margaret Klenck.
She changes moods and tempers quite naturally and
adds a unique sensitivity to the role of mistress and
wife.
The two decide to reveal their relationship, but are
unable to do so until they are discovered. Once
exposed, so to speak, they decide to make a clean
break of it and get divorced and then marry each
other. The rest of the play centers on the struggles of
Henry and Annie to cope with the necessary readjust
ments in their lives and the emotions that still run
unchecked in their relationships.
"The Real Thing," accented with nostalgic '60s
songs and sensitive monologues, is first and
foremost the touching story of a man In search of
certainties in life in an uncertain world.
The set changes, in true ACT style, are the smooth
est on this or any other side of Broadway. The
costumes are colorful and appropriate, with few ex
ceptions.
Stoppard's work is not for the prudish or reserved,
however. The play abounds with clever innuendo
and spicy discussions of "grooming mounts and
mounting grooms." Yet none of the dialogue seems
out of place or in bad taste, merely revelations of the
shifting morals of the modern family.
"The Real Thing" plays now through March 6 at
the ACT's Geary St. theater.
