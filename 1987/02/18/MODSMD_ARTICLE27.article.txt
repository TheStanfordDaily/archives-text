# CD NOTES

### JOSE BOWEN ADAM GROSSMAN 
Expense and limited repertoire
are no longer good reasons for not
starting your compact disc (CD)
collection. If you've ever used a
compact disc player, then the ad
vantages of its increased dynamic
range, convenience and brilliant
noise-free sound are obvious to
you. This column will focus on
building a basic library of jazz and

classical music, but we want to
start by telling you why we prefer
to use CDs.
A few points about value: first,
you get much for your money
when you buy a CD player instead
of a record player and cartridge of
the same price. Second, although
CDs are more expensive per unit,
they can hold up to 75 minutes of
music, while records only hold
about 45 minutes at most. You
can often buy one CD that holds
as much music as two records
(example: "Sinatra at the Sands"
can be had as one CD or two LPs).
Sets are particularly good buys on
CD: we'll include this information
in our reviews to assist in bargain
hunting.
In addition, several new budget
CD lines are in the works, includ
ing Vox Prima CD Wallet from the
Moss Music Group. These list for
♦ 12.99 but are selling at discount
houses for <>9.99. Third, CDs last
forever and always sound great.
You can upgrade your turntable,
but not your records — a better

turntable will In fact make your
old records sound worse.
Each edition of this column will
make recommendations about
either jazz or classical discs, In
cluding Information about the
quality of music, the recording,
and how much music you'll get for
your money. Our recommen
dations will be guided by this ob
jective information as well as our
personal taste. We'd like to begin
with two of our favorite discs.
"Jessye Norman singing Rich
ard Strauss' Four Last Songs"
(Philips CD 411-052-2, recorded
August 1982 with Kurt Maser con
ducting the Gewandhaus Or

chestra of Leipzig).
Jessye Norman will change your
entire concept of the soprano
voice. Her effortless highs and
rich lows make her voice a part of
the orchestral texture. The loud
passages are full and powerful
without being harsh.
"The Four Last Songs" were
written in the last two years of
Strauss' life. Without the flam
boyance of his earlier works,
Strauss returns to simpler
melodic lines while retaining his
mastery of orchestral color. Also
included are several of Strauss'
earliest works, including a favor
ite, "Zueignung (Dedication)."
This disc was one of the very
first CDs and so the sonics aren't

perfect. It still sounds very good,
however. What the disc lacks in
length (it's 46 minutes long), it
more than makes up for in the
music and the performance.
Highly recommended.
The Stan Getz Quartet, "The
Dolphin" (Concord Jazz CD
-4158, recorded May 1981, with
Lou Levy, piano; Monty Budwig,
bass; and Victor Lewis, drums).
Stan Getz' velvet sound has
earned him the title of "Prince of
the Tenor Saxophone" and"The
Dolphin" is a good example of
what Getz can do with that beauti
ful sound. His sensitive inter
pretations and inventive melodies
abound on a variety of standards.
"Joy Spring" is taken a little
slower than some artists take it,
but it sits well at this slower
tempo; you get to hear all the
notes. The group plays extremely
well together, from the quiet
passages in "A Time for Love" to
the high-energy rhythm of "The

Night Has a Thousand Eyes." Vic
tor Lewis opens up a bit on this
track. His subtle approach, com
plex rhythms and Incredible
facility definitely distinguish him
as a world-class drummer.
The disc is only 46 minutes
long, but is a great introduction to
Stan Getz.
Highly recommended.
Our next column will feature
classical music for people who are
not crazy about classical music.
