## Baseball defeats Davis as Keyser picks up win 
### ROBERT PORTNOY Staff writer 
On the strength of three home runs and sopho
more Brian Keyser's seven innings of four-hit ball,
the Stanford baseball team ended its two-game skid
with a 10-1 pounding of UC-Davis yesterday.
The Cardinal attack exploded for a six-run third
inning and a three-run fourth to give Keyser a fluffy
nine-run cushion that he rode smoothly until allow
ing a run in the seventh, the only time he allowed a
runner to reach third base all day.
"Keyser has been pitching mainly relief for us. and
he got a chance to start and did very well. He'll con
tinue to pitch and get a lot of innings for us. It was
good for him and it was good for us because we
needed a lift right now." Stanford Coach Mark
Marquess said.
Sophomore third baseman Ed Sprague led the
Cardinal power binge with two home runs. The first,
a three-run shot, came in the fourth, and the second
was a solo blast in the seventh.
"One was a 1-0 curveball and the other was a 2-2
slider. It was just one of those days when you feel real
comfortable at the plate and things go your way."
Sprague said.
Freshman Paul Carey continued to contribute in
the clutch for Stanford with a three-run homer of his
own to cap the third. The homer was his fourth of
the season, earning him a tie with Sprague for the
team lead.
"He's a lot like Sprague. He can get in a streak and
really hurt a team and then he can fall into a slump.
He'll learn to recognize pitches better and continue

to improve on what he's done so far, just like
Sprague." Marquess said.
To start off the third, freshman shortstop Troy
Paulsen had a run-scoring ground-out. Junior desig
nated hitter Jeff Saenger followed that with an RBI
single, and sophomore first baseman Ron Witmeyer
then delivered a two-run double before Carey s
homer.
"Both Witmeyer and Saenger have hit the ball
much better than their current averages (.181 and
.206. respectively). Witmeyer had one ball besides
the double that he hit hard and was robbed by a
great defensive play. Saenger has hit the ball hard all
season and makes good contact a lot of the time,"
Marquess said.
"That was the first hit I've had in a while. It was a
1-2 curveball and I was just looking for a good pitch
to hit. I took it back up the middle like I was trying to
do all day," Witmeyer said.
Keyser was especially pleased to pitch effectively in
a starting role and to win the first game of his col
legiate career after going 0-1 last season.
"I was real happy with the performance." Keyser
said. "I went with the fastball and slider mainly
today. I tried to keep it at the knees today because I
noticed the ball was carrying really well in batting
practice. I did it pretty successfully, for the most
part."
The Cardinal batters were not at all fooled by Davis'
starting pitcher Staub. His fastball didn't have a lot
of zip and the breaking pitches were not moving
enough to cause any problems.

Davis, but failed to hit in four at-bats. The sophomore is hitting .263 this season.
