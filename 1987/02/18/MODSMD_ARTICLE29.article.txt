### ROBERT PORTNOY Staff writer 
Stanford senior Kathleen
McCarthy yesterday shot a
tournament and course record
4-under-par 68 to move Into
first place In the individual
competition at the Arizona In
tercollegiate In Tuscon.
The Cardinal star followed an
opening-round 74 with a flve
birdie, one-bogey masterpiece
on the 6,100-yard Randolph
Golf Course. McCarthy leads
the tournament by three shots
over Arizona State's Pam
Wright at 145. Next are Texas'
Kate Golden and Laurette
Maritz of U.S. International
University at 146. At 147 are
Dina Ammaccapane of ASU and
Kim Saiki of USC.
"I got off to a really good
start," McCarthy said. "The
first hole I had a 10-footer for
birdie and missed it. I made a
five-footer for birdie on second
and birdied the par-5 third,
getting up and down out of the

front bunker after coming over
my second shot."
The only negatives in
McCarthy's round were a three
putt bogey on the 17th and a
three-putt on the par-5 fifth
after reaching in two.
"Today (yesterday) was a
pretty flawless round. The last
two days I've hit the ball very
well, and today I putted well
too," McCarthy said.
McCarthy hit no less than 17
of 18 greens In regulation yes
terday, and may have had a
bogey-free round were it not for
a bad break on the 17th.
Stanford is in fourth place at
610 after two rounds. 18
strokes behind ASU and out of
contention.
"We can't win it now, but we
like to look for team rounds. We
won't be happy with a third or
fourth place finish, but that's
what it looks like so we're
looking for a good team round
to finish the tournament,"
McCarthy said.
