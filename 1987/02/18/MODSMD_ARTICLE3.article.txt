Three mid-career South Afri
can blacks will come to Stanford
this fall to pursue studies in
management, journalism and
education as part of an effort by
universities around the nation
to give South African blacks the
skills necessary to build a post
apartheid society, according to
the program's coordinator.
The fellowship program will
"provide an opportunity for
black South Africans to gain ex
pertise that they can use and to
develop skills to work together,
set goals and to work toward" a
new society, according to John
Marcum, coordinator of the pro
gram and professor of political
science at UC-Santa Cruz.
Marcum will head the pro
gram at a group of universities
that includes Stanford, Cornell,
Princeton, the University of

Washington and several Univer
sity of California campuses.
Twenty-five mid-career South
Africans will join 350 black
South African students who are
studying at American colleges
and universities. The Educa
tional Opportunity Council
(EOC), a South African group
led by Archbishop Desmond
Tutu, selects both groups for
study in the United States. Mar
cum said that the EOC and the
universities "jointly designed"
the new program.
The EOC will match the aca
demic Interests of the mid
career black South Africans
with the appropriate campus in
the consortium. The duration of
each stay will vary according to
the type of study. According to
Marcum, each South African fel
low will be matched with a uni
versity mentor who will design
an appropriate academic pro
gram.

The effort is "a positive contri
bution American universities
can make to the situation in
South Africa to help provide
skills and training relevant to
the South Africa of the future."
according to Political Science
Prof. Richard Brody. head of the
fledgling Presidential Advisory
Committee on Educational In
itiatives for Black South
Africans.
