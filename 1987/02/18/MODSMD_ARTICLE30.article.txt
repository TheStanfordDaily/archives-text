Three tough matches in four days will be the next
challenge for the Stanford men's volleyball team,
which has a match tonight at 7:30 against No. 1
UCLA, Friday at 7:30 p.m. against No. 8 Long Beach
State, and Saturday at 7:30 p.m. vs. No. 3 USC.
In addition to the number of matches and high
rankings of the opponents. No. 6 Stanford will play
its first away matches of the season against confer
ence teams.
It will be a hard road trip for the Cardinal, espe
cially for freshmen starters Parker Blackman and
Craig Forsyth, neither of whom have had the experi

"This week will be tough, especially when we play a
team like UCLA where their plan is to wear you
down," said Blackman, who has been the Cardinal's
starting setter for the last three conference matches,
all of which have been victories.
Stanford's starting lineup will remain the same, al
though senior Stephen Blue had injured his ankle at
the start of Wednesday's match against Hawaii. Blue
has been a key player in the last two wins against
Hawaii and at the UCLA/Reebok Collegiate Classic
on Feb. 6 and 7. leading Stanford with 59 kills and
39 digs.
Stanford's strong blocking and hitting offense will
face the powerful serving and consistent passing of
UCLA. The Cardinal enters the match with some
foreknowledge, having played UCLA at the UC-Santa
Barbara Classic on Jan. 23 and 24 and at the UCLA
Classic. Stanford was shut out by UCLA in each con
frontation.
