## 
### HUGH R. BETHELL Staff writer 
When the Stanford sailing team decided to host a
team racing regatta, it was only hoping to gain a little
practice before the national championship qualify
ing regatta that will be held in the spring.
Cardinal sailors got more than practice in the
regatta this past weekend, however. In an impressive
display of consistent speed, the Cardinal team racing
squad went undefeated in eight races to capture a
victory at the first Stanford Team Race Regatta.
"It was really good practice for all the Northern Cal
ifornia schools that came, and especially for our
sailors. I think the North will have a real advantage
when it comes time to compete against the southern
schools for the right to go to the national champion
ships." Stanford Coach Blake Middleton said after
the regatta.
In team racing, each school fields a team of three
boats that battles every other school in a round-robin
rotation. By defeating each of the other schools
twice. Stanford captured the regatta's only perfect
record.
All competitors shared in enjoying perfect weather
during the regatta, though. After racing in sun and
light winds on Saturday, the sailors were ready for
Sunday's warm temperatures and 15 to 18 knot
winds.
"It was the nicest sailing day I've seen (this year)."
Middleton said.
The first team from UC-Berkeley came closest to
challenging the Cardinal squad's top position, but
ended up second with a record of six wins and two
losses. Cal Poly-San Luis Obispo placed third, while
Berkeley's second team and San Jose State rounded
out the top five.
"The A-team from Cal was very good. They gave us
a battle, especially on the second day.and Stanford's
second race against Cal was definitely the toughest
of the regatta for our sailors. We only beat them by
one point." Middleton said.
Sailing for Stanford were junior Drew Gashler and
senior Kristen Boyles. juniors Dan Buckstaff and
Kathleen Mallery. and Junior Doug Hagen and senior
Karl Skllbred.
