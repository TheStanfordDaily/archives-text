### KEN STEVENS Editorial staff 
With the Pacific 10 Confer
ence season opener just two
days away, the No. 1 ranked
Stanford women's tennis team
will play the last of its pre
season tuneups today against
Santa Clara at the Stanford
Tennis Stadium at 1:30 p.m.
The Cardinal, 3-0 in dual
matches, inaugurates the Pac
-10 season with matches Friday
at Arizona State and Saturday
at Arizona. Last season, Stan
ford, ranked No. 1 at the time,
almost returned from Arizona
without its undefeated record.
Even though Patty Fendick.
the Cardinal's top performer,
will not be in the lineup, Stan
ford's perfect dual-match
record will not be in jeopardy
today against Santa Clara.
"They're not very good."
Stanford Coach Frank Brennan
said of the Broncos. "They're
not as good as UOP (whom
Stanford beat 9-0 last Tues
day)."
Fendick will miss her second
match of the season. The
defending-NCAA singles cham
pion is in Boca Raton. Fla.,
where she is playing today in
the first jound of a professional
tournament.
Senior Stephanie Savides
will take over the No. 1 singles
spot in place of Fendick today.
Junior Kay Tittle and freshman

Lisa Green will play No. 2 and
3, respectively. Brennan said
that he is uncertain as to who
else will see action today,
though he did indicate that he
would like to play senior Jackie
Joseph somewhere.
Two players that Brennan
would also like to play — senior
Leigh Anne Eldredge and soph
omore Eleni Rossides — have
both received some encourag
ing news about the stress
fracture injuries that have kept
them off the court all season,
Rossides' doctor in Oregon
told her last weekend that she
can star! hitting in two weeks,
and P (dredge has already
begun to hit for 20 minutes
each day.
Eldredge said that she too is
"getting more optimistic." but
she also explained that she is
going to be extremely cautious
in her comeback. The injured
leg is "really sore." Eldredge
said. "I'm not sure if it's caused
from the hitting or from exer
cising It's more of a muscle
soreness."
The former NCAA doubles
champion indicated that, even
if all goes well, she will not
return until April. "If things
were to go smoothly from here,
with no setbacks, maybe I'll be
back in April," she said. "I don't
think sooner, because the
progression will take awhile.
There's a possibility that I
could get In and play doubles
sooner."
