# Stanford track finishes 2nd in Wash. Indoor
## 
### ERIK STEN Editorial staff 
Come finals week, distance runner Mark Mastallr
may have a hard time concentrating on his studies.
Finals end on March 20 but Mastallr's thoughts will
most likely be wandering a few days down the road to
March 22 and the World Junior Team Cross Country
Championships in Milan. Italy.
By placing sixth In last weekend's U.S. Junior
Cross Country Trials in Dallas, the freshman earned
a spot on the junior national team, which along with
the senior men's and women's teams, will spend two
weeks training and racing in Italy.
The championships will be the freshman's first
taste of international competition. And though the
opportunity to compete abroad may eventually
become routine for the distance ace, Mastallr was
understandably pleased with this weekend's perfor
mance.
"Training has been going well over the last couple
of months," he said. "Things really worked out."
While Mastallr was busy in Texas, the rest of his

Stanford teammates were competing in two different
locations.
The team was in Seattle at the Washington Indoor
Track Meet, the Cardinal's only Pacific 10 Confer
ence indoor meet of the year, as well as the Boise In
door, in which four of the Cardinal competed as indi
viduals.
In Washington Stanford placed second, behind
Washington and ahead of Oregon State. Keys to the
Cardinal's performance were Carol Gray, Charles Al
exander and John Gash. Gray set a meet record in
the mile with a time of 4:56.3 and then completed a
sweep by winning the two mile in 10:24.4.
Gray won but she also found the wins less satisfy
ing than a fourth place finish the weekend before at
Louisiana State. "I'd much rather get in a race and
mix It up than finish first in a slow time," Gray said.
Alexander placed third in the mile at 4:15.9 and
then won the two mile in 9:08.7, bettering the
second and third place times by a full seven seconds.
Gash, like Gray, was also a double winner with vic
tories in both the pole vault and the long jump with
marks of 15-feet-7 and 1/2 and 21-11, respectively.
