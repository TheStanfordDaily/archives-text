# Men's golf 18th in Hawaii tourney
##

In life, we all eventually have
to set realistic goals for our
selves.
The Stanford men's golf
team, after two dismal rounds
to open the John Burns Invita
tional in Honolulu, had to do
much the same. In 20th place
out of 24 teams heading into
Friday's final round, the
players found but one consola
tion. If they shot well enough to
move into the top 18, they
would be invited back to the
tournament next season.
The team accomplished that,
barely. Stanford wound up in a
tie for 18th place with UC-
Santa Barbara, one of two
teams it passed to pull off the
feat. Were it not for Washing

ton's collapse In the final round
— the Huskies led Stanford by
seven strokes after two rounds
— the Cardinal may not have
reached Its goal.
UCLA led the tournament
from start to finish to defeat
Arizona and Oklahoma by a
whopping 16 strokes. Arizona's
Mike Springer won the individ
ual title, topping Arizona
States' Bill Mayfalr by four
strokes.
The Cardinal surge can be
largely attributed to the final
two rounds of sophomore John
Mahon, who posted a 69 and a
71 to close the tournament.
"Mahon played very well. His
71 the final day was one of the
top 10 rounds of the day,"
Stanford Coach Tim Schaff
said.
