# Reynolds defends Reagan's policy on civil rights
## 
### LORI SILVER Staff writer 
Women, blacks and other
minorities in the job market are
not entitled to "any extra points,
any preference, any leg up," Asst.
Attorney General William Brad
ford Reynolds said last night in a
forum on civil rights and the
Reagan administration.
Stressing his goal of achieving a
"colorblind, race-neutral society"
where people are measured by
merit and"the content of their
character." Reynolds, head of the
Civil Rights Division of the De
partment of Justice, claimed that
the Justice Department under the
Reagan administration has
pursued the most active civil
rights enforcement policy in his
tory.
Reynolds sparred with Political
Science Lecturer James Steyer, a
representative of the NAACP Legal
Defense Fund, throughout the
forum held in Annenberg Audi
torium and attended by more than
500 people. Justice Allen Brous
sard of the California Supreme
Court moderated the forum,
which was sponsored by Stanford
in-Government.
"Merit is not what makes the
world go around," said Steyer,
noting that networking and con
tacts lead to most jobs. "If !t were,
then for God's sake, Edwin Meese
would not be the attorney general
of the United States," he said.
Women and people of color have
never truly had fair access to the
job market, Steyer claimed. For
them, "civil rights is a myth," he
said.
Steyer criticized the lack of
women and minorities holding
high-ranking positions in the
Reagan administration and the
Justice Department.

Steyer went on to enumerate a
decent level of health care, educa
tion, access to a job and a decent
place to live as the building blocks
of a society that provides equal op
portunity to everyone.
The focus of civil rights should
be "properly turned to women,
minorities, the poor, blacks and
Latinos who are still denied the
building blocks of civil rights," he
said.
Reynolds then discussed pro
grams aimed at providing those
building blocks. Affirmative ac
tion and mandatory student
busing have had some "marginal
benefits" but have been largely
counterproductive, he said. Rey
nolds cited the Reagan adminis
tration's Affirmative Outreach job
training program and magnet
schools as examples of successful
civil rights programs.
"We have never compelled
people in this country who have
not wanted an integrated educa
tion to have one," Reynolds said.
"White flight" away from manda
tory busing and into private
schools destroyed opportunities
that the busing created, he said.
Reynolds said magnet schools
— schools that offer a unique cur
riculum In order to promote vo
luntary integration — attract an
integrated student body by offer
ing a quality education. He called
them "an exciting and wonderfully
successful alternative to manda
tory busing."
Reynolds said the incidents of
racial violence at Howard Beach,
New York, and Forsyth Co., Geor
gia, received "rapid-fire attention
by law enforcement agencies."
These incidents "represent the
lingering racial cancer that is still
with us and must be removed to
