# Attorney: Doctors followed procedures
## 
### CHRIS MARIO 
Doctors at the Stanford Medical Cen
ter followed accepted medical proce
dures and provided the best possible
care to a Belmont flight engineer who
died of a brain tumor in 1983, accord
ing to the attorney defending the Uni
versity in a malpractice case now un
der way in State Superior Court in San
Jose.
Socrates Manoukian, who repre
sents Stanford's insurance carriers in
the lawsuit, said that Stanford doctors
were not negligent in their treatment
of Walter Clements, who died Dec. 5,

1983 of an astrocytoma in the left fron
tal lobe of his brain.
Calling the errors made in Clements'
case "administrative" rather than
medical, Manoukian rejected the Cle
ments family's claim that errors made
by Stanford doctors led to Clements'
death. He also said that the serious
ness of the tumor made recovery
impossible, and thus the administra
tive error was irrelevant to Clements'
death.
In a malpractice suit filed against
Stanford in 1985 and now being
argued in court, the Clements family
maintains that Clements' death

resulted from the failure of Stanford
doctors to diagnose and treat Cle
ments' condition after his first visit to
Stanford Hospital on April 15, 1982,
according to Bruce Bailey, the family's
lawyer.
Clements first saw doctors at Stan
ford after suffering a seizure in Saudi
Arabia, where he was working for the
Federal Aviation Administration. On
the basis of a Saudi Arabian CT-scan, a
computer-assisted X-ray procedure,
the doctor Clements saw at Stanford
on April 15, 1982 determined that no
cause for the seizure was evident,
Manoukian said.

The Clements family claims that a
new CT-scan should have been done at
Stanford to determine the cause of the
seizure. But according to Manoukian,
the Stanford doctors were justified in
using the Saudi Arabian test results.
The Clements family's expert wit
nesses "admit that in 75 percent of all
seizures, the cause is unknown,"
Manoukian said. The experts also said
that no duplication of the CT-scan in
the United States was necessary for the
diagnosis, according to Manoukian.
In July 1982, Clements returned to
Stanford for a follow-up examina
tion, Manoukian said. At that
time, a new CT-scan found a
meningioma, a cancerous growth
in the tissue that surrounds the
brain. But because of what
Manoukian called an
"administrative problem," the
results of the test were never com
municated to Clements' doctors.
"The doctors at Stanford did
nothing wrong. It was just a bu
reaucratic problem, the type of
problem that you have in any
large, bureaucratic organization,"
Manoukian said.
The Clements family claims that
a receptionist told Clements he
had "no reason to worry" when he
called to ask about the results of
the second CT-scan, Bailey said.
When a third CT-scan was per
formed in August, doctors identi
fied the astrocytoma in Clements'
brain, and notified Clements of
the seriousness of his condition.
According to Manoukian, such
tumors are incurable.
"Experts unanimously agree

that astrocytomas cannot be
cured. Many doctors tell their
patients to skip treatment and to
go to Hawaii." Manoukian said.
After the diagnosis, Clements
chose to seek treatment at Se
quoia Hospital In San Jose, where
"most of the left side of his brain"
was removed in an operation, ac
cording to Bailey. Clements died
about one year later.
"The case isn't that hard to un
derstand," Manoukian said. "The
man had a tumor from which he
was going to die, and no amount
of treatment could have saved
him. Two thousand people get
this kind of tumor each year, and
only five In all recorded medical
history have recovered. And all five
of those were dramatically distin
guishable from the present case."
"In order to recover (damages)
in a tort case, the plaintiff must
first show negligence, and second,
must show that further injury was
caused by the negligence,"
Manoukian said. "The key Issue
here is proximate cause. The doc
tor at Sequoia Hospital who did
the surgery says that even If the
procedure had been done in July,
the outcome wouldn't have been
any different."

cured. Many doctors tell their
patients to skip treatment and to
go to Hawaii." Manoukian said.
After the diagnosis, Clements
chose to seek treatment at Se
quoia Hospital In San Jose, where
"most of the left side of his brain"
was removed in an operation, ac
cording to Bailey. Clements died
about one year later.
"The case isn't that hard to un
derstand," Manoukian said. "The
man had a tumor from which he
was going to die, and no amount
of treatment could have saved
him. Two thousand people get
this kind of tumor each year, and
only five In all recorded medical
history have recovered. And all five
of those were dramatically distin
guishable from the present case."
"In order to recover (damages)
in a tort case, the plaintiff must
first show negligence, and second,
must show that further injury was
caused by the negligence,"
Manoukian said. "The key Issue
here is proximate cause. The doc
tor at Sequoia Hospital who did
the surgery says that even If the
procedure had been done in July,
the outcome wouldn't have been
any different."
Doctors at the Stanford Medical Cen
ter followed accepted medical proce
dures and provided the best possible
care to a Belmont flight engineer who
died of a brain tumor in 1983, accord
ing to the attorney defending the Uni
versity in a malpractice case now un
der way in State Superior Court in San
Jose.
Socrates Manoukian, who repre
sents Stanford's insurance carriers in
the lawsuit, said that Stanford doctors
were not negligent in their treatment
of Walter Clements, who died Dec. 5,

1983 of an astrocytoma in the left fron
tal lobe of his brain.
Calling the errors made in Clements'
case "administrative" rather than
medical, Manoukian rejected the Cle
ments family's claim that errors made
by Stanford doctors led to Clements'
death. He also said that the serious
ness of the tumor made recovery
impossible, and thus the administra
tive error was irrelevant to Clements'
death.
In a malpractice suit filed against
Stanford in 1985 and now being
argued in court, the Clements family
maintains that Clements' death

resulted from the failure of Stanford
doctors to diagnose and treat Cle
ments' condition after his first visit to
Stanford Hospital on April 15, 1982,
according to Bruce Bailey, the family's
lawyer.
Clements first saw doctors at Stan
ford after suffering a seizure in Saudi
Arabia, where he was working for the
Federal Aviation Administration. On
the basis of a Saudi Arabian CT-scan, a
computer-assisted X-ray procedure,
the doctor Clements saw at Stanford
on April 15, 1982 determined that no
cause for the seizure was evident,
Manoukian said.

The Clements family claims that a
new CT-scan should have been done at
Stanford to determine the cause of the
seizure. But according to Manoukian,
the Stanford doctors were justified in
using the Saudi Arabian test results.
The Clements family's expert wit
nesses "admit that in 75 percent of all
seizures, the cause is unknown,"
Manoukian said. The experts also said
that no duplication of the CT-scan in
the United States was necessary for the
diagnosis, according to Manoukian.
In July 1982, Clements returned to
Stanford for a follow-up examina
tion, Manoukian said. At that
time, a new CT-scan found a
meningioma, a cancerous growth
in the tissue that surrounds the
brain. But because of what
Manoukian called an
"administrative problem," the
results of the test were never com
municated to Clements' doctors.
"The doctors at Stanford did
nothing wrong. It was just a bu
reaucratic problem, the type of
problem that you have in any
large, bureaucratic organization,"
Manoukian said.
The Clements family claims that
a receptionist told Clements he
had "no reason to worry" when he
called to ask about the results of
the second CT-scan, Bailey said.
When a third CT-scan was per
formed in August, doctors identi
fied the astrocytoma in Clements'
brain, and notified Clements of
the seriousness of his condition.
According to Manoukian, such
tumors are incurable.
"Experts unanimously agree

that astrocytomas cannot be
cured. Many doctors tell their
patients to skip treatment and to
go to Hawaii." Manoukian said.
After the diagnosis, Clements
chose to seek treatment at Se
quoia Hospital In San Jose, where
"most of the left side of his brain"
was removed in an operation, ac
cording to Bailey. Clements died
about one year later.
"The case isn't that hard to un
derstand," Manoukian said. "The
man had a tumor from which he
was going to die, and no amount
of treatment could have saved
him. Two thousand people get
