# University rejected Stanford grad's plan
## UC-Berkeley students to study with new program in Ecuador 
### MARTHA MOODY Staff writer 
This summer between three and six undergradu
ates will have the opportunity to live in Ecuador,
study its political and economic situation and write
policy recommendations that will be read by the U.S.
Agency for International Development. But these
students will be from Berkeley rather than from
Stanford because David Lempert, the course direc
tor, was unable to find a sponsor for his course here.
Lempert, who holds law and business degrees from
Stanford, said he believes a Stanford education does
not provide sufficient exposure to "the people that
are being affected" by the "textbook" policies that
students learn here. After teaching a SWOPSI class
called "The Unseen America"in which he took stu
dents to prisons and mental hospitals, among other
places, Lempert decided to try to teach a class in a de
veloping country.
Lempert wanted to teach the class through
SWOPSI, so he approached Innovative Academic
Courses (lAC), the University department that over
sees SWOPSI. According to John Winkler, assoc. pro
fessor of classics who was then faculty director of
lAC. Lempert's class was "not the kind of thing our
office can do." Acceptance of Lempert's program

would have necessitated the hiring of a new staff
member who knew how to go about obtaining visas
and insurance for the students, he explained.
"People in offices just know what they're allowed to
do," Winkler said.
Since this was not something his office was
prepared to implement, Winkler did not present
Lempert's proposal to the SWOPSI Program Board.
But according to Fred Cate, an ASSU graduate
senator who was, at the time, a member of the
SWOPSI Program Board, the board would probably
not have accepted Lempert's proposal anyway.
SWOPSI classes should be "available to as many stu
dents as possible" and should involve the "active in
volvement of a faculty member," according to Cate.
Lempert's class would not have fulfilled either of
these criteria, Cate said.
He also cited a "phenomenal liability problem" and
competition for limited funding as reasons that Lem
pert's idea would not have been approved by the com
mittee.
Winkler suggested that Lempert take his proposal
to Overseas Studies, an office that he thought would
be more prepared to implement the idea. Overseas
Studies was also unwilling to sponsor Lempert's
class. Nancy Padgett, deputy di
rector of Overseas Studies, ques
tioned Lempert about grading
procedures, written work and
other academic aspects of the
class, according to a source close
to Overseas Studies. She then
concluded that Lempert's class
did not have enough structure,
the source said.
Lempert said he had had a
"dispute over educational philoso
phy" with members of the Over
seas Studies office because they
only wanted to sponsor "tight,
highly structured programs that
will encourage students to stay on
campus and study."
Frustrated with what he consid
ered an "administrative mas
sacre" of his proposal, Lempert
submitted it to the University of
California's Education Abroad
Program at Santa Barbara. Be
cause the program only sends stu
dents to other universities,
administrators suggested to Lem
pert that he make his class a joint
effort between a UC school and a

school in another country. They
also told him that he would have
to be affiliated with an academic
department in the UC system in
order to teach the course.
At that point Lempert applied to
both Stanford's and UC-Berkeley's
Ph.D. programs in anthropology,
hoping that as a graduate student
in that department he might fi
nally find a sponsor for his class.
Lempert was accepted by UC-
Berkeley's anthropology depart
ment but was rejected by
Stanford.
But Lempert was still unwilling
to give up the idea of teaching the
class here. He wrote a letter de
scribing his plan to Warren Chris
topher, president of the Stanford
Board of Trustees. Christopher
forwarded Lempert's letter to
Carolyn Lougee, dean of under
graduate Studies.
According to Lougee, the "only
possibility" for teaching such a
class outside of Innovative Aca
demic Courses is to obtain a fac
ulty sponsor. She. in turn,
forwarded Lempert's letter to
George Collier, professor of
anthroplogy and director of the
Center for Latin American
Studies. Collier has an interest in

field work in Latin America, and
will take eight Stanford students
to Mexico this summer to work
with local health authorities.
Lempert says that he suggested
that his class be made an exten
sion of Collier's program but Col
lier was unwilling to sponsor the
idea.
Collier said he was unprepared
to comment on his decision over
the phone.
When evaluating Lempert's pro
posal to travel to Ecuador, Collier
consulted Edmundo Fuenzalida,
academic advisor to Overseas
Studies. Fuenzalida criticized the
method of Lempert's class, saying
he would have preferred a pro
gram like Collier's that involves a
"dialogue with local authorities"
instead of "just going down there
and saying 'This is what you need
to do In order to develop.' "
Fuenzalida also said he thought
that Lempert's program would
place "too much emphasis on the
experiential side" of learning, and
not enough on the academic side.
Deciding there was little chance
Stanford would sponsor his class,
Lempert enrolled at UC-Berkeley
and began searching for a faculty
sponsor for his class.

did not have enough structure,
the source said.
Lempert said he had had a
"dispute over educational philoso
phy" with members of the Over
seas Studies office because they
only wanted to sponsor "tight,
highly structured programs that
will encourage students to stay on
campus and study."
Frustrated with what he consid
ered an "administrative mas
sacre" of his proposal, Lempert
submitted it to the University of
California's Education Abroad
Program at Santa Barbara. Be
cause the program only sends stu
dents to other universities,
administrators suggested to Lem
pert that he make his class a joint
effort between a UC school and a

school in another country. They
also told him that he would have
to be affiliated with an academic
department in the UC system in
order to teach the course.
At that point Lempert applied to
both Stanford's and UC-Berkeley's
Ph.D. programs in anthropology,
hoping that as a graduate student
in that department he might fi
nally find a sponsor for his class.
Lempert was accepted by UC-
Berkeley's anthropology depart
ment but was rejected by
Stanford.
But Lempert was still unwilling
to give up the idea of teaching the
class here. He wrote a letter de
scribing his plan to Warren Chris
topher, president of the Stanford
Board of Trustees. Christopher
forwarded Lempert's letter to
Carolyn Lougee, dean of under
graduate Studies.
According to Lougee, the "only
possibility" for teaching such a
class outside of Innovative Aca
demic Courses is to obtain a fac
ulty sponsor. She. in turn,
forwarded Lempert's letter to
George Collier, professor of
anthroplogy and director of the
Center for Latin American
Studies. Collier has an interest in

field work in Latin America, and
will take eight Stanford students
to Mexico this summer to work
with local health authorities.
Lempert says that he suggested
that his class be made an exten
sion of Collier's program but Col
lier was unwilling to sponsor the
idea.
Collier said he was unprepared
to comment on his decision over
the phone.
When evaluating Lempert's pro
posal to travel to Ecuador, Collier
consulted Edmundo Fuenzalida,
academic advisor to Overseas
Studies. Fuenzalida criticized the
method of Lempert's class, saying
he would have preferred a pro
gram like Collier's that involves a
"dialogue with local authorities"
instead of "just going down there
and saying 'This is what you need
to do In order to develop.' "
Fuenzalida also said he thought
that Lempert's program would
place "too much emphasis on the
experiential side" of learning, and
not enough on the academic side.
Deciding there was little chance
Stanford would sponsor his class,
Lempert enrolled at UC-Berkeley
and began searching for a faculty
sponsor for his class.
This summer between three and six undergradu
ates will have the opportunity to live in Ecuador,
study its political and economic situation and write
policy recommendations that will be read by the U.S.
Agency for International Development. But these
students will be from Berkeley rather than from
Stanford because David Lempert, the course direc
tor, was unable to find a sponsor for his course here.
Lempert, who holds law and business degrees from
Stanford, said he believes a Stanford education does
not provide sufficient exposure to "the people that
are being affected" by the "textbook" policies that
students learn here. After teaching a SWOPSI class
called "The Unseen America"in which he took stu
dents to prisons and mental hospitals, among other
places, Lempert decided to try to teach a class in a de
veloping country.
Lempert wanted to teach the class through
SWOPSI, so he approached Innovative Academic
Courses (lAC), the University department that over
sees SWOPSI. According to John Winkler, assoc. pro
fessor of classics who was then faculty director of
lAC. Lempert's class was "not the kind of thing our
office can do." Acceptance of Lempert's program

would have necessitated the hiring of a new staff
member who knew how to go about obtaining visas
and insurance for the students, he explained.
"People in offices just know what they're allowed to
do," Winkler said.
Since this was not something his office was
prepared to implement, Winkler did not present
Lempert's proposal to the SWOPSI Program Board.
But according to Fred Cate, an ASSU graduate
senator who was, at the time, a member of the
SWOPSI Program Board, the board would probably
not have accepted Lempert's proposal anyway.
SWOPSI classes should be "available to as many stu
dents as possible" and should involve the "active in
volvement of a faculty member," according to Cate.
Lempert's class would not have fulfilled either of
these criteria, Cate said.
He also cited a "phenomenal liability problem" and
competition for limited funding as reasons that Lem
pert's idea would not have been approved by the com
mittee.
Winkler suggested that Lempert take his proposal
to Overseas Studies, an office that he thought would
be more prepared to implement the idea. Overseas
Studies was also unwilling to sponsor Lempert's
class. Nancy Padgett, deputy di
rector of Overseas Studies, ques
tioned Lempert about grading
procedures, written work and
other academic aspects of the
class, according to a source close
to Overseas Studies. She then
concluded that Lempert's class
did not have enough structure,
