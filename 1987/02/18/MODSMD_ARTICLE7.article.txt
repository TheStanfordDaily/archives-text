# University rejected Stanford grad's plan
## UC-Berkeley students to study with new program in Ecuador 
### MARTHA MOODY Staff writer 
This summer between three and six undergradu
ates will have the opportunity to live in Ecuador,
study its political and economic situation and write
policy recommendations that will be read by the U.S.
Agency for International Development. But these
students will be from Berkeley rather than from
Stanford because David Lempert, the course direc
tor, was unable to find a sponsor for his course here.
Lempert, who holds law and business degrees from
Stanford, said he believes a Stanford education does
not provide sufficient exposure to "the people that
are being affected" by the "textbook" policies that
students learn here. After teaching a SWOPSI class
called "The Unseen America"in which he took stu
dents to prisons and mental hospitals, among other
places, Lempert decided to try to teach a class in a de
veloping country.
Lempert wanted to teach the class through
SWOPSI, so he approached Innovative Academic
Courses (lAC), the University department that over
sees SWOPSI. According to John Winkler, assoc. pro
fessor of classics who was then faculty director of
lAC. Lempert's class was "not the kind of thing our
office can do." Acceptance of Lempert's program

would have necessitated the hiring of a new staff
member who knew how to go about obtaining visas
and insurance for the students, he explained.
"People in offices just know what they're allowed to
do," Winkler said.
Since this was not something his office was
prepared to implement, Winkler did not present
Lempert's proposal to the SWOPSI Program Board.
But according to Fred Cate, an ASSU graduate
senator who was, at the time, a member of the
SWOPSI Program Board, the board would probably
not have accepted Lempert's proposal anyway.
SWOPSI classes should be "available to as many stu
dents as possible" and should involve the "active in
volvement of a faculty member," according to Cate.
Lempert's class would not have fulfilled either of
these criteria, Cate said.
He also cited a "phenomenal liability problem" and
competition for limited funding as reasons that Lem
pert's idea would not have been approved by the com
mittee.
Winkler suggested that Lempert take his proposal
to Overseas Studies, an office that he thought would
be more prepared to implement the idea. Overseas
Studies was also unwilling to sponsor Lempert's
