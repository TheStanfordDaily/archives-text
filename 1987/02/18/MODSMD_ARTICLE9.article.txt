Fighting in West Beirut kills 30
BEIRUT, Lebanon — At least 30 people were reported killed and
more than 100 wounded yesterday In the worst fighting this year
In Beirut, as a new alliance of communist and Druze forces fought
against Shilte Amal militiamen In what was seen as the most
serious challenge to Amal here since it took control of the Moslem
half of the capital three years ago.
The fighting, with tanks, artillery and anti-aircraft weapons,
spread over a wide area of West Beirut. From Christian East
Beirut, residents already anguished by the city's long, unchecked
slip into anarchy could see new palls of smoke hanging over the
area and fires blazing In the distance.
Syria's military intelligence chief in Lebanon, Brig. Ghazl
Kanaan, rushed to West Beirut with top aides for a meeting with
leaders of the Druse and the Syrian-backed Amal movements in a
bid to halt the fighting.
Despite a cease-fire declared after sunset, however, West Beirut
residents reported seeing tanks firing and the intermittent rattle
of machine guns and the thud of artillery shells continued into the
night.
Amal's chief military spokesman, Tareq Ibrahim, accused Druze
leader Walid Jumblatt of initiating the fighting to aid Palestinian
factions under siege by Shiite militias and to "scuttle" national
reconciliation proposals being discussed by Syria, Amal and the
Lebanese government of President Amin Gemayel.
Reagan boosts American business
WASHINGTON — President Reagan, attempting to marshal sup
port for his competitiveness program, challenged business leaders
yesterday to join a "quest for excellence" to restore pride in Ameri
can products and maintain U.S. leadership in the global economy
In the 21st century.
"In the year's ahead, we're going to have to work harder and
work better" to keep America "at the top of the charts, the front of
the pack, the head of the class" in the year 2000, the president
told 100 business leaders gathered in the East Room of the White
House.
To achieve that goal, Reagan Is reversing his early opposition to
efforts to retrain workers who have lost their jobs. He now is ask
ing for * 1 billion in training funds, and called these workers "a
national treasure" that should not be wasted.
"Properly prepared workers in our declining industries can be
the competitive edge for our rising industries," Reagan said, refer
ring to the hundreds of thousands of manufacturing workers who
have lost their jobs since 1981.
His six-part competitiveness package also includes a doubling
of funds for the National Science Foundation over the next five
years and new laws to help get the fruits of American laboratories
into the marketplace surer and speedier.
Rebel cause suffered during truce
MANILA, Philippines — Philippine communist insurgents, who
in the week since the end of a 60-day cease-fire have returned to
fighting government troops, suffered a major political loss during
the truce, in the view of diplomats and military observers.
At the same time, the government of President Corazon Aquino,
in marked contrast to widespread perceptions at the start of the
cease-fire last December, has become increasingly convinced that
it has won the public opinion battle for the support of the middle
class, officials and analysts said.
As a test of that renewed public support for the Aquino govern
ment, the military is embarking cautiously on a new offensive
against the insurgents.
"They (the communists) made some early gains in propaganda,"
said one Asian diplomat, "but toward the end of the cease-fire,
they seemed to be losing it."
Vietnam government reshuffles
HANOI, Vietnam — Vietnam announced a major government
reshuffle here yesterday, with six new vice premiers named and
more than a dozen ministries and state commissions affected.
A front-page story in the Communist Party newspaper Nhan
Dan showed that the main beneficiary of the reshuffle was Nguyen
Co Thach, 65, who retained the Foreign Ministry portfolio as well
as being promoted to vice premier (deputy chairman of the council
of ministers).
The five other new vice premiers named were Nguyen Khanh,
who will also hold the post of cabinet secretary general; former
agriculture minister Nguyen Ngoc Triu; Tran Due Luong; Doan
Duy Thanh, who retained the foreign trade portfolio; and Nguyen
Van Chlnh.
Tran Quynh and Dinh Lieu surrendered their posts as vice
premiers, the newspaper said.
A Cabinet shuffle had been widely expected since a party
congress in December, which heard sharp criticism of the failure
of officials to solve Vietnam's massive economic problems, obser
vers here said.
Helmut Kohl cleared of suspicions
BONN, West Germany — A West German parliamentary com
mission here yesterday cleared Chancellor Helmut Kohl's govern
ment of suspicions that it encouraged the illegal sale of submarine
blueprints to South Africa.
As was widely expected, the panel, dominated by Kohl's own po
litical party, the Christian Democratic Union, and by Liberals,
said the government could not be faulted politically or legally.
However, the two opposition parties said that several questions
were left unanswered.
The opposition Social Democrats and the Greens announced
that they would call for the formation of another commission of
inquiry once the new Parliament convened today for its first
meeting since the Jan. 25 general election.
Newspapers had reported last Novembver that the state-owned
HDW shipyard, based in the port of Kiel, and a Luebeck engineer
ing company sold the blueprints for some *23 million, apparently
against laws on arms exports.
According to the findings of the commission, the two compan
ies had used contacts in Bonn to try and Improve the "political
climate" for a submarine deal with Pretoria.
Study probes Soviet dissatisfaction
CHICAGO — The young, the educated and the affluent in the
Soviet Union are much more likely to be dissatisfied with their
lives than their counterparts in the West. American researchers
reported yesterday. They said there seems to be a direct correla
tion between the amount of exposure to Western influences and
the degree of dissatisfaction.
The last such survey, done after World War 11. had found that
older Soviet citizens were the least satisfied with their lot.
The new study, based on detailed Interviews with Soviet
emigres In the United States, was reported at a meeting of the
American Association for the Advancement of Science here.
It is the first such study since the Harvard Refugee Project,
which studied Soviets In displaced-persons camps after the
second World War.
Lead by economist James Millar of the University of Illinois at
Urbana-Champaign. the team Interviewed 2,793 Soviet emigres
between January 1979 and April 1982. The subjects were selected
from more than 34.000 Soviet Immigrants who arrived In the
United States during that period.

Fighting in West Beirut kills 30
BEIRUT, Lebanon — At least 30 people were reported killed and
more than 100 wounded yesterday In the worst fighting this year
In Beirut, as a new alliance of communist and Druze forces fought
against Shilte Amal militiamen In what was seen as the most
serious challenge to Amal here since it took control of the Moslem
half of the capital three years ago.
The fighting, with tanks, artillery and anti-aircraft weapons,
spread over a wide area of West Beirut. From Christian East
Beirut, residents already anguished by the city's long, unchecked
slip into anarchy could see new palls of smoke hanging over the
area and fires blazing In the distance.
Syria's military intelligence chief in Lebanon, Brig. Ghazl
Kanaan, rushed to West Beirut with top aides for a meeting with
leaders of the Druse and the Syrian-backed Amal movements in a
bid to halt the fighting.
Despite a cease-fire declared after sunset, however, West Beirut
residents reported seeing tanks firing and the intermittent rattle
of machine guns and the thud of artillery shells continued into the
night.
Amal's chief military spokesman, Tareq Ibrahim, accused Druze
leader Walid Jumblatt of initiating the fighting to aid Palestinian
factions under siege by Shiite militias and to "scuttle" national
reconciliation proposals being discussed by Syria, Amal and the
Lebanese government of President Amin Gemayel.
Reagan boosts American business
WASHINGTON — President Reagan, attempting to marshal sup
port for his competitiveness program, challenged business leaders
yesterday to join a "quest for excellence" to restore pride in Ameri
can products and maintain U.S. leadership in the global economy
In the 21st century.
"In the year's ahead, we're going to have to work harder and
work better" to keep America "at the top of the charts, the front of
the pack, the head of the class" in the year 2000, the president
told 100 business leaders gathered in the East Room of the White
House.
To achieve that goal, Reagan Is reversing his early opposition to
efforts to retrain workers who have lost their jobs. He now is ask
ing for * 1 billion in training funds, and called these workers "a
national treasure" that should not be wasted.
"Properly prepared workers in our declining industries can be
the competitive edge for our rising industries," Reagan said, refer
ring to the hundreds of thousands of manufacturing workers who
have lost their jobs since 1981.
His six-part competitiveness package also includes a doubling
of funds for the National Science Foundation over the next five
years and new laws to help get the fruits of American laboratories
into the marketplace surer and speedier.
Rebel cause suffered during truce
MANILA, Philippines — Philippine communist insurgents, who
in the week since the end of a 60-day cease-fire have returned to
fighting government troops, suffered a major political loss during
the truce, in the view of diplomats and military observers.
At the same time, the government of President Corazon Aquino,
in marked contrast to widespread perceptions at the start of the
cease-fire last December, has become increasingly convinced that
it has won the public opinion battle for the support of the middle
class, officials and analysts said.
As a test of that renewed public support for the Aquino govern
ment, the military is embarking cautiously on a new offensive
against the insurgents.
"They (the communists) made some early gains in propaganda,"
said one Asian diplomat, "but toward the end of the cease-fire,
they seemed to be losing it."
Vietnam government reshuffles
HANOI, Vietnam — Vietnam announced a major government
reshuffle here yesterday, with six new vice premiers named and
more than a dozen ministries and state commissions affected.
A front-page story in the Communist Party newspaper Nhan
Dan showed that the main beneficiary of the reshuffle was Nguyen
Co Thach, 65, who retained the Foreign Ministry portfolio as well
as being promoted to vice premier (deputy chairman of the council
of ministers).
The five other new vice premiers named were Nguyen Khanh,
who will also hold the post of cabinet secretary general; former
agriculture minister Nguyen Ngoc Triu; Tran Due Luong; Doan
Duy Thanh, who retained the foreign trade portfolio; and Nguyen
Van Chlnh.
Tran Quynh and Dinh Lieu surrendered their posts as vice
premiers, the newspaper said.
A Cabinet shuffle had been widely expected since a party
congress in December, which heard sharp criticism of the failure
of officials to solve Vietnam's massive economic problems, obser
vers here said.
Helmut Kohl cleared of suspicions
BONN, West Germany — A West German parliamentary com
mission here yesterday cleared Chancellor Helmut Kohl's govern
ment of suspicions that it encouraged the illegal sale of submarine
blueprints to South Africa.
As was widely expected, the panel, dominated by Kohl's own po
litical party, the Christian Democratic Union, and by Liberals,
said the government could not be faulted politically or legally.
However, the two opposition parties said that several questions
were left unanswered.
The opposition Social Democrats and the Greens announced
that they would call for the formation of another commission of
inquiry once the new Parliament convened today for its first
meeting since the Jan. 25 general election.
Newspapers had reported last Novembver that the state-owned
HDW shipyard, based in the port of Kiel, and a Luebeck engineer
ing company sold the blueprints for some *23 million, apparently
against laws on arms exports.
According to the findings of the commission, the two compan
ies had used contacts in Bonn to try and Improve the "political
climate" for a submarine deal with Pretoria.
Study probes Soviet dissatisfaction
CHICAGO — The young, the educated and the affluent in the
Soviet Union are much more likely to be dissatisfied with their
lives than their counterparts in the West. American researchers
reported yesterday. They said there seems to be a direct correla

the degree of dissatisfaction.
The last such survey, done after World War 11. had found that
older Soviet citizens were the least satisfied with their lot.
The new study, based on detailed Interviews with Soviet
emigres In the United States, was reported at a meeting of the
American Association for the Advancement of Science here.
It is the first such study since the Harvard Refugee Project,
