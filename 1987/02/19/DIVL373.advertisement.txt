■ As a Product Manager at Microsoft, you have a head start over the rest. H
t I
■ First you work closely with a brilliant software development team. Then you handle every H
aspect of a product from inception to distribution. And you have a tradition of winners: H
from MS-DOS, to QuickBASIC, to the powerful Microsoft Excel spreadsheet. You also H
H| have a name that is known by personal computer users throughout the world. H
Hj But there's a challenge, too. You must bring important advances in software H
technology within the understanding of the business world. You'll determine the strategy H
H| that will position your product within the minds of our market, and you will implement it step H
II by step. You'll guide the software of the future to its place as a practical part of the business
|H as usual. H
That's why our product manager positions call for a unique kind of leadership—one H
HB equally at home with software concepts and marketing plans. H
If you're interested in Applications, Systems, or Languages Marketing, and if you have an H
MBA as well as experience in software marketing or product management, we want to taik H
with you. We're looking for the best— leaders and visionaries—those who have
demonstrated technical/marketing ability and a record of achievement. H
■ Our location in the Pacific Northwest, near Seattle, is one of the most diverse in the H
H country—an area where quality of life is high and exciting. Mountains for skiing, hiking, H
and climbing are close enough for day-tripping. Three spectacular national parks are H
WM within easy reach. The beautiful San Juan Islands are yours to explore by sailboat or ferry, H
■ car or bike. Fishing? Only if you like salmon and steelhead. H
|B Most importantly it's a place where you can be a leader with a leading company— H
MICROSOFT. We offer private offices, flexible hours, and a health club membership. And H
we'll take care of you with generous benefits and relocation packages.
