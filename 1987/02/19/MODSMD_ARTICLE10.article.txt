# Israel agrees to help in Iran probe
## 
### 
WASHINGTON — Prime Minister Yitzhak
Shamir agreed yesterday that Israel will begin
compiling a chronology of financial transac
tions and contacts with U.S. officials and will
answer questions submitted by the Senate and
House select committees investigating the
Iran-contra arms scandal, the panels' leaders
announced after meeting with him.
The committees will prepare "an inter
rogatory, or set of questions" to be submitted
to Israel, which "will in turn provide us with
answers," Senate panel Chairman Daniel
Inouye, D-Hawaii, said.
"If we desire clarifications of the answers,
steps will be taken by both countries to bring
this about," he added, without indicating
what steps, if any. had been discussed with
Shamir.
However, Inouye said senior committee staff
members probably would travel to Israel if fur
ther clarification is needed.
Inouye and House panel Chairman Lee
Hamilton, D-Ind., described Shamir as

"extremely cooperative" during the discus
sions. which were also attended by Senate and
House leaders.
According to Hamilton, Shamir said Israel
wants to provide the committees with "all the
information" Israel has and that he is "very
pleased" with his accord with committee
leaders. "I think it will expedite our investiga
tion," he said.
"We both understand that, if difficulties
arise down the road, then we'll have to talk to
one another to work out those difficulties,"
Hamilton said. "But we think we have in place
modalities now that will permit us to get the
facts we want."
The agreement came a few hours after Presi
dent Reagan urged Shamir at a White House
meeting to cooperate with U.S. authorities in
vestigating the Iran-contra affair and Shamir
pledged that Israel will do so. according to a
senior administration official.
The official said Reagan and Secretary of
State George Shultz, who met three times with
Shamir Tuesday and Wednesday, urged Israel

to cooperate with the Tower commission
probing the Iran-contra affair, with indepen
dent counsel Lawrence Walsh and with the two
select committees.
The official had refused to clarify whether
the administration is unhappy with the pres
ent degree of Israeli cooperation in the various
investigations, but the fact that Reagan and
Shultz brought up the issue seemed to indi
cate friction about the matter.
Israeli government spokesman Yossi
Ahimeir said earlier this week that Shamir was
adamantly opposed to interrogations by U.S.
authorities of Israelis involved in secret arms
shipments to Iran. He said Israel instead
wanted the United States to refer all questions
to the Israeli government for written answers.
The select committees apparently agreed to
this basic approach. Inouye remarked that the
relationship between the committees and Is
rael would be "government-to-government,"
with questions sent to Shultz for forwarding to
proper Israeli authorities.
