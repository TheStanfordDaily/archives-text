Prophylactic tactic
Is any Stanford student still unaware that this is National Condom Week? As part of their effort to in
crease student awareness and use of prophylactics, members of the AIDS Education Project have
been distributing various brands of condoms in White Plaza this week. Senior Meg Richman (right)
hands out condoms to passers-by. The condom packets also include forms to rate various condom
varieties. Results of "The Great Condom Rating Contest" will be available next week.
