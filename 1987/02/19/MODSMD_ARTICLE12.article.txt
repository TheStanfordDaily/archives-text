A letter by Secretary of Education William Bennett
lambasting tuition Increases at Stanford and other
universities has drawn sharp criticism from Univer
sity officials.
The letter, published yesterday in The New York
Times, blasts universities for increasing tuition far
beyond the present level of inflation and for failing to
develop a vision of higher education.
The Board of Trustees recently approved a 6 per
cent increase in Stanford's undergraduate tuition
for the 1987-88 school year, boosting tuition to
*11,880. The rate of inflation through 1986 was ap
proximately 1.8 percent.
A report submitted to the trustees by the Office A
Public Affairs defends the University's tuition in
creases in recent years while acknowledging
criticism for the higher costs.
"We need to be mindful of the criticisms expressed
over the prices we charge, while recognizing that
they should not deter us unduly from seeking the re
sources necessary to provide the highest quality edu
cation," the report states.
Bennett, however, charges that the problem uni
versities face today is not that of a funding shortage.
"The real problem is not lack of money but failure
of vision," Bennett says in his letter.
"Unfortunately, when it comes to higher educa
tion, this distinction is frequently lost. Stanford Uni
versity's vague justification for increased charges —
'new knowledge Is inherently more expensive' — only
underscores the lack of focus and purpose at some of
our nation's most prestigious universities," Bennett
says.
James Rosse, acting University president, said he

"doesn't really agree with Secretary Bennett, but he
is entitled to his point of view."
Rosse added that "there has been nothing vague,
nor will there be anything vague" about reasons for
tuition increases at the University.
Carolyn Lougee, dean of undergraduate studies,
criticized Bennett for not "doing his homework''
before making statements about the vision of under
graduate education at Stanford.
"One phrase is not enough to understand what an
institution is about." Lougee said, noting that the
phrase Bennett quoted in his letter was made by Uni
versity President Donald Kennedy at a Feb. 4
meeting with members of the national media.
At that forum several University administrators,
including Kennedy and Lougee. gave talks about the
educational goals of Stanford.
"A great deal of care is going into the planning of
undergraduate education at Stanford." she said.
In the letter, Bennett also defends the Reagan ad
ministration's student aid policies, noting that
"since 1982, money available through federal stu
dent aid programs has increased every single year."
Bennett stresses that the administration "has con
sistently sought to redirect aid to the neediest stu
dents." adding that "all students presently receiving
aid would continue to be eligible for the same dollar
amount" under the administration's 1988 budget
proposal.
"Higher education is not underfunded," Bennett
writes. "It is under-accountable and under
productive. Our students deserve better than this.
They deserve an education commensurate with the
large sums paid by parents and taxpayers and
donors."
Bennett was not in his office in Washington, D.C.,
yesterday and was unavailable for comment.
