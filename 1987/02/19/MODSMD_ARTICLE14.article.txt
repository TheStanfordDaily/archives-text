### 
Asst. Attorney General William Bradford
Reynolds spoke here Tuesday night to defend
the Reagan administration's civil rights
record. Needless to say, it was a tall order;
despite his positive rhetoric, Reynolds
couldn't hide the administration's dismal
record.
The Reagan administration has routinely
opposed affirmative action programs. The
administration itself is ironic testimony to
this fact; almost all of its high-level positions
are filled by white males. Reynolds defended
the administration's anti-affirmative action
stance, saying that women and minorities in
the job market are not entitled to "any extra
points, any preference, any leg up." He went
on to say that his goal is a "colorblind, race
neutral society" where people are judged on
merit.
However, it would be naive to believe —
given U.S. race history — that without civil
rights laws and their enforcement,
employers will act in a colorblind manner
and hire only according to merit.
If the Reagan administration's true goal is
a race-neutral and colorblind society, its
policies for achieving this goal have been
woefully shortsighted. The administration
has fought against programs that would give
underprivileged members of our society —
the poor, women, blacks and other
minorities — the opportunity to educate
themselves and thus have the chance to com
pete equally. On critical issues of housing,
education and voting rights, the administra
tion has done little.

□ The Equal Employment Opportunity Com
mission, an agency designed to enforce
employers' compliance with civil rights laws,
has seen its staff cut 25 percent since
Reagan took office.
□ Up through March 1984, there was only
one civil rights lawsuit filed by the adminis
tration in the area of education, and this
only after a federal court order to do so. This
shouldn't be that shocking, however, since
Reynolds himself has said the administra
tion is "not going to compel children who
don't choose to have an integrated education
to have one."
□ On average, the Justice Department has
filed fewer than three new fair housing law
suits per year since Reagan took office,
compared to the 32 per year filed between
1969 and 1978.
□ The administration opposed the extension
of the Voting Rights Act of 1982 until
Congress passed it overwhelmingly; even
then, Reagan proposed measures that would
have weakened it.
With a record like that, one might be
tempted to think that the administration is
attempting to turn the clock back on civil
rights progress. The administration's lack of
action should serve as a reminder that the
hard-won civil rights gains of the last three
decades are hardly an ingrained and per
manent feature of our society. The ideas of
true equality take a long time to be absorbed.
If it is truly serious about reaching its goal of
a "colorblind, race-neutral society," the
Reagan administration needs to make civil
rights issues a top priority.
