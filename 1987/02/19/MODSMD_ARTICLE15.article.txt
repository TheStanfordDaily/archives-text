Really, we are
a reform effort

Ahem. Allow us to introduce
ourselves. We are ARE. Yes, that
is what we call ourselves, defying
definition. Yet, the reading public
feels insecure without some
acronymical meaning, so we'll
offer a few possibilities. ARE is:
an Aggregation of Radical
Egomaniacs. A Red Apple, Actu
ally a Reform Effort or All Really
Excitable. However, we didn't
write to discuss the obscurity of
our name. We at ARE quite both
ered by the absurdities that occur
at Stanford and in the world at
large, so we are proposing some
solutions. We demand that:
□ We be allowed to make
demands.
□ The Reagan Library be built in
South Africa.
□ People stop picking on
"homosexuals" and start harass
ing those who are
"homogeneous."
□ Contraceptives be sent to the
contras.
□ Christians and their foes stop
arguing about birth control,
"Catcher in the Rye," the Pope
and Jerry Falwell, and start
talking about Jesus Christ.
□ Stanford build a larger en
trance to the Quad.
□ KZSU have a tribute to Glenn
Miller.

If these demands are not met,
we will:
□ Cry.
□ Join the Democratic party and
sell cheap reproductions of Ken
nedy campaign posters.
□ Rush a fraternity.
□ Stop saying our prayers to Don
Kennedy.
Now that we have offended the
greatest number of people possi
ble in such a short space, we
hope that some reform will result.
In the meantime, have a nice day.

Most terrorist
acts Islamic
In a recent viewpoint (Daily,
Feb. 17), a student raised the
issue of "unfair" treatment of
Moslems in the media's coverage
of terrorism. All too often, he
wrote, terrorists are described as
"Islamic terrorists" acting on
behalf of a "jihad," or "holy war."
Such descriptions, he said,
portray Islam in a negative man
ner.
These objections, in my mind,
are unjustifiable and even
ridiculous. If the press ignored
the religious and political motives
of terrorist attacks it would be
responsible for a gross negligence

that would leave the American
public sadly uninformed. Imagine
the following news bulletin:
"A band of men belonging to a
certain religious group has kid
napped another man on the basis
of his particular religion and
nationality. Experts speculate
that a certain religious state may
be responsible for this action,
although we can't mention any
names for fear of growing religi
ous prejudice in the United
States."
It is certainly true that the
overwhelming majority of Mos
lems are not terrorists. It is also
true that the Islamic religion does
not condone terrorist activity.
Nonetheless, it is undeniable that
many terrorists are fanatic Mos
lems fighting in a holy war
against Israel, the United States
and each other. The American
press simply does not invent
stories about Moslem fanatics
exploding Vans in U.S. Marine
compounds or kidnapping U.S.
reporters in Iran. If these violent
acts were committed by Chris
tians, Jews, Hindus or Bud
dhists, the press would duly
report their involvement. Yet, the
painful fact still remains: Most
terrorist acts are sponsored by
Islamic groups, and some of these
acts appear to be sponsored by
Islamic states like Syria and
Libya.
