# It could be a worse Amerika

The premise for ABC's "Amerika" miniseries
— that the United States has been taken over
by Soviet and United Nations forces — does not
seem very likely. Why couldn't ABC choose
something more realistic? For example. . . .
Imagine, 10 years from now. the United
States has been taken over — without a shot
being fired — by a corrupt alliance of Republi
can and Democratic political hacks. In the
name of freedom, democracy and fiscal conser
vatism. the president guts social programs,
runs up a trillion-dollar debt, expands the mili
tary forces, fattens arms contractors' pocket
books and increases arms exports to terrorist
rebel groups and to almost every nation in the
world — including dictatorships — which
routinely uses torture and murder to keep it
self in power.

Imagine that when moderate forces In
Congress object to arms sales to terrorists and
dictatorships, the president authorizes a
massive undercover operation through the Na
tional Security Agency and the CIA to achieve
his foreign policy goals. When moderates ob
ject to the military buildup, he classifies many
programs as secret so that no one will know
what is going on or see the massive waste and
fraud conducted by the arms contractors.
When moderates object to the massive debts
and cuts in social programs, he uses clever
propaganda techniques and his persuasive,
telegenic powers to sweet-talk everyone into ac
cepting it.

In this scenario, the president is elected to
power by only 27 percent of those eligible to
vote and most of those 27 percent are unin
formed about the issues and uninformed
about the candidates' positions on the issues.
Those that are informed feel powerless to af
fect the Republican/Democrat stranglehold on
the political process because of its backing by
the military-industrial complex, greedy politi
cal action committees and wealthy special in
terests. The Republican/Democrat alliance is
able to roll right into power. America has lost
its nerve.
In this scenerio. those who do dissent are
ignored by the news media or dismissed as un-
American. People who try and resist with non
violent boycotts, strikes and demonstrations
are derided, harassed, arrested or co-opted
into mere feel-good excercises. Violent resis
tance is brutally suppressed.
Worst of all, in this scenario, people mostly
accept their subjugation. They accept murder,
vandalism, poverty, homelessness. unemploy
ment. tedious and dangerous work places,
stultifying schools, alcoholism, chemical
spills, toxic wastes, smog, racism, sexism and
child abuse as if these were as natural as tor
nadoes or earthquakes. Many blame them
selves for their situation or blame their prob
lems on poor ethnic groups. Others mindlessly
repeat to each other their cynical expressions
of hopelessness: "It has always been this way,"
"You can't do anything about it," "Just do
what you have to do to get along" and"It could
be worse — at least we can buy VCRs."
In one part of this scenario, millions of
Americans sit passively In front of their televi
sion sets, drugged out on alcohol, cigarettes.
Twinkles and titillating blue Jean commer

cials, watching a 14-hour show that makes
them feel powerless and fearful that the only al
ternative to the current situation is to be taken
over by a ruthless, totalitarian country.
But then, a few people begin to resist. They
get together with others and soon there is a
whole movement of people wofking to end
oppression. It challenges the status quo and
stands up for the ideals of America. These
people refuse to allow anyone to be hurt or
belittled. They work against institutions that
crush the human spirit. They try to heal their
own and others' hurts and addictions. They
develop cooperative ways to work together in
their own groups and with others, Including
other countries, and demand that they be tried
and implemented. They encourage dissent and
the resolution of conflicts through non-violent
negotiation and mediation.
Through numerous non-violent actions they
resist the special interests and challenge and
replace the repressive, entrenched bureau
cracy. Of course, it is not easy to take on the
Republican/Democrat alliance, with its
wealthy and powerful backers, especially since
ipany people fear that change will only lead to a
worse situation. So there are thousands of dra
matic encounters in which unarmed people
courageously face the firepower of the es
tablishment and convincingly demonstrate
that they will actively fight for what is right
and risk their lives to create a truly good soci
ety.
Now that would make for an Interesting TV
show. But come to think of it.it sounds like it
would be much more fun to do than to watch.
