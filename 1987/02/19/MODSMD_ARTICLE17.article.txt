# SDI is a muddled ideal
## 
### 
It has been nearly four years since President
Reagan sat in his office, squarely faced the camera,
and uttered these words: "I call upon the scientific
community who gave us nuclear weapons to turn
their great talents to the cause of mankind and world
peace, to give us the means of rendering these nu
clear weapons impotent and obsolete." Thus the na
tion witnessed the controversial birth of the Strate
gic Defense Initiative (SDI).
It has taken me nearly four years to realize this one
salient fact (and I hold this truth to be self-evident):
Ronald Reagan, the venerable president of our
country, Is radically confused about the realistic op
tions embodied in SDI. As he stumbles clumsily
ahead on his crusade for an alleged nuclear shield,
he guides us closer to a total collapse In our relation
ship with the Soviet Union and quite possibly toward
upsetting the precarious strategic balance.

Consider SDI as Reagan understands it. In the
beginning there was the X-ray laser, once the center
piece of SDI, a visionary weapon whose beams are
generated by small thermonuclear explosions. But
Reagan opposes the use of nuclear weapons in SDI
and the idea of hundreds of hydrogen bombs floating
around in space or buried In submarines swimming
perilously close to Soviet shores seemed unrealistic.
Thus, the original vision was amended: Maybe
we'd have lasers based on the ground, and bounce
the beams off gigantic mirrors in space. Or maybe
we'd place all the lasers in space, veritable sitting
ducks for Soviet countermeasures. But whatever SDI
turns out to be, we'll share it with the evil Russians.
Better yet, we'll make them pay for It. Or maybe we'll
just keep it for ourselves after all. But of course we
won't deploy it until the Soviets make huge reduc
tions In their offensive missiles. Never mind that we
won't really need it then. And I'm sure we'll have no
problems convincing the Russians to reduce the size
of their forces even as we vigorously pursue SDI.
Finally, SDI isn't going to be the impenetrable
shield that protects the whole western population, as
was earlier promised, but it will protect some of our
missile sites; so I guess nuclear weapons won't be
rendered obsolete after all.
The president has flip-flopped, sidestepped and
misstated the facts so often that he doesn't know
what the hell is going on now. In the meantime, the
whole country Is utterly confused about SDI — what
it can and cannot do, when it will be ready, if ever,
and if we'll need it when it is ready. And even though
Congress has run off in 535 different directions
since the Introduction of SDI. we still manage to
spend billions of dollars we can't afford in pursuit of
this blurred vision.
Because of Reagan's confusion and stunning in
transigence regarding SDI, the United States and the

Soviet Union missed an opportunity for a sweeping
arms control agreement at the non-summit summit
in Reykjavik, Iceland. As our side tells It: "We came to
Iceland to advance the cause of peace. And though
we put on the table the most far-reaching arms con
trol proposal in history, [Soviet leader Mikhail] Gor
bachev rejected it."
At a press conference that followed the meeting,
Reagan further explained this failure: "I had pledged
to the American people that I would not trade away
SDI." Thank you very much. But you were not asked
to trade away SDI; you were asked to simply delay
testing and deployment for 10 years, a not-so
unreasonable request in the eyes of most reputable
scientists — especially given SDl's alarming political,
technical and economic uncertainties.
A political cartoon that recently appeared in the
San Francisco Chronicle summed up the prevailing
attitude in the White House. In the picture Ronald
Reagan sits in a rocket perched on an incline,
readied for launch. The rocket, labeled "Star Wars,"
is pointed in the wrong direction. The caption reads:
"Why don't we just assume we know what we're
doing."
For four years now, the president and his staff
have pretended to know what they were doing,
pretended to know what the whole SDI debate has
been all about; and the whole nation, it seems,
blindly followed them in dizzying circles.
"Never underestimate the power of sheer ignor
ance in Washington," warns Fred Reed, a military
observer. There is the presumption that, if they
pretend to know what's going on. nobody will notice
that they don't know what's really going on. And we
American citizens assume that somebody some
where must know the truth behind SDI. Well that
somebody is not Ronald Reagan, for he has already
demonstrated, with a remarkably dramatic flair, that
he in fact does not.
I sympathize with the president's conviction that
there is something unsettling about the doctrine of
Mutually Assured Destruction, about dealing with
other nations by threatening their existence. But he
apparently does not — or will not — acknowledge the
obvious political costs of SDI. As the editors of The
New Republic noticed, "Reagan gives the world a
shape he would like it to have," then determines that
to be the way things are. It's always fun to watch em
barrassed cabinet members and advisers try to reign
in the president's galloping imagination.
Maybe the man is simply held captive by his own
visions of the Good Life: The electronic wizardry of
SDI buzzes overhead; laser beams flash at the
speed oj light through the darkness oj space to
thwart aggressive Soviet missiles. And in quiet
towns across America, smiling mothers tuck sleep
ing children into bed for the night. Another of life's
uncertainties diminishes. Freedom and democracy
reign. All (in the West) live happily ever after.
An appealing vision, Mr. President, but can you
spell naive?
