# IFC to implement new Rush policies
## 
### BAIE NETZER Senior staff writer 
Representatives from 11 fraternities ap
proved a new Rush policy that will involve
the Issuance of "Rush cards" and the
prohibition of alcohol from the second week
of Rush at a meeting last night of the Inter-
Fraternity Council (IFC).
Fraternal Affairs Adviser Joe Pisano said
he supports the new Rush guidelines and
predicted that the new Rush "will go a long
way toward eliminating some of the prob
lems."
"No one here can really tell how well it'll
work," Pisano said. "But I think it's a solid
effort on the part of the IFC. and I hope it's
successful."
Under the new guidelines, this year's
Rush will begin with an April 2 meeting de
signed to be a "substitute for the Rush
book," according to IFC President Steve
Singleton.
At the April meeting, information will be
distributed and Rush cards will be issued to
prospective rushees. Each card will list a
rushee's name, class and residence and will
be required of any male wishing to attend a
fraternity's open house during Rush.
The 14-8 vote in favor of the new policy
followed a short discussion by IFC members
of the new Rush guidelines. Each fraternity
was allowed two votes. Alpha Delta Phi,
Theta Xi and Sigma Alpha Mu fraternities

voted against the proposed Rush
guidelines. Four fraternities did not cast
votes at the meeting.
Alpha Delta Phi members at the IFC
meeting opposed the introduction of Rush
cards because "most people we attract up at
the house are not the sort of people who are
going to go out of their way to get Rush
cards," according to sophomore Nick Ar
redondo.
Alpha Delta Phi members said many of
those living in their house had not
originally intended to rush but decided to
rush after wandering up to the fraternity's
residence. Members of the fraternity said
they were concerned that Rush cards would
mean a lower Rush turnout and perhaps af
fect their status as a housed fraternity.
Members of the IFC's Rush Committee
said that Rush cards will continue to be
available at various locations on campus
after the April 2 meeting. Phi Delta Theta
fraternity member Vinnle Frost said the
cards were necessary "to keep randoms out
of parties."
Under the new guidelines, the only stu
dents who will be allowed into fraternity
open houses will be fraternity members.
Rushees and Rush hostesses.
"Rush is more than just waiting for
people to come up to your parties,"
Singleton said. "Some of Rush can be done
