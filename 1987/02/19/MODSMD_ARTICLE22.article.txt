## Dining, dancing and sailing in an evening of excitement on the Bay 
### JAMES R DICKEY Editorial staff 
The age of elegant dining and luxurious
travel Is alive and well on San Francisco Bay.
The Hornblower Yachts Co. presents the
Peninsula's only dinner and dancing cruises in
the best of rlverboat traditions. Its vessel, "City
of San Francisco." is a floating nightclub and
restaurant in one.
The staff quickly set the tone for the evening
with its courtesy and efficiency. The full nauti
cal dress of the stewards and the captain gave
one the feeling of embarking on a true ad
venture.
As the last of the guests were seated, the
crew smoothly and silently nudged the ship
out of its berth and the journey began.
The guests were treated to candlelit settings
on each of the yacht's three levels. Each level
was unique in its presentation of space and
entertainment, offering a variety for the adven
turous passenger.
The lower-deck passengers enjoyed the most
spacious of the three decks, with a band that
did justice to songs from Huey Lewis to Glenn
Miller, a dance floor and a cabaret show by the
trio of Nicholas, Glover and Wray.
The cabaret was a pleasant accompaniment
to dinner, with the three young ladies mixing
beautiful harmonies with interesting arrange
ments of Duke Ellington and Cab Calloway
tunes.
The hum of the diesels in the background
and the view of the Bay outside the picture

windows were the only reminders that we were
in fact at sea while our steward served the hors
d'oeuvres and cocktails.
We were offered our choice of several entrees
for dinner â€” my guest and I chose filet mignon
and poached prawns. Both meals, prepared on
board by the ship's several chefs, were quite
satisfactory.
The Napa Valley jewel, ZD's '80 Cabernet
Sauvig >on was an excellent complement to the
entrees and assured continued enjoyment of
the meal.
Between courses, we toured the decks and
enjoyed the sights of the Bay. The middle deck
was adorned with mahogany accents and
boasted an excellent jazz band.
As the smallest of the decks, the upper deck
was the only one without a band, and it pro
vided a quiet, intimate atmosphere perfect for
the Valentine's weekend passengers.
In the highest point on the ship, the pilot

cabin, Captain Bell proudly discussed his rela
tionship with the unusual firm. "This is the
most rewarding of careers," he said. "The cap
tain has the pleasure of seeing the fruits of his
labor immediately."
"On these cruises most of the guests have
very little experience at sea," Bell explained.
"Therefore my job is to be sure to avoid or min
imize the impact of the slightest of swells."
We returned to find a delightful dessert of
chocolate mousse covered with strawberry
sauce awaiting us. The mousse was light and
fluffy and a delicious topper to what was
proving to be an excellent evening.
The guests were all quite friendly and
sociable, as if the cruise were as much a social
event as an interesting way to spend an even
ing on the Bay.
The company offers both dinner and brunch
cruises, which leave from Pier 33 in San Fran
cisco.
