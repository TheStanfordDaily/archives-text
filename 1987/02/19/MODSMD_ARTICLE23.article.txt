## Award nominations reflect conservative tastes 
### JAMES LUJAN Editorial staff 
Everybody who goes to movies likes to
see good movies (although I do know a few
people whose ideal afternoon consists of
catching the matinee performance of
"Killer Mopeds from Hell"), but what ex
actly is a good movie? The answer to that,
of course. Is completely subjective. We all
have different standards and varying
degrees of taste and tolerance. One per
son's "Howard the Duck" is another per
son's "Citizen Kane." Each year, however,
anybody who cares about what Is best in
the movies takes his opinions and
measures them up against the estab
lished barometer of quality In the film in
dustry — the Oscars.
Last Wednesday, the Academy of Mo
tion Picture Arts and Sciences announced
its annual list of superlatives for the 59th
Academy Awards. They're the only awards
that anyone really cares about and the
only ones that matter — a best picture
win can boost the box-office take of a
movie by millions of dollars.
The conservative academy normally and
empirically has given nominations to
films of high-minded, traditional, noble
Ideals — films with which the academy
would like to see itself historically associ
ated (such as "Chariots of Fire" and
"Gandhi"). The academy rarely runs the
risk of jeopardizing its high- class image
by nominating films that would fall below
its stuffy standards. As a result, films one
rarely — if ever — sees nominated are
science-fiction, horror, action-adventure
and X-rated films. Even comedies are gen
erally ignored. This year's nominations,
more so than in other years, seem to
reflect the conservative attitude of the
academy.
Two of this year's picture
nominees that exemplify this attitude are
"A Room with a View" and"The Mission."
Although "A Room with a View" deserves
its nomination, "The Mission" doesn't.
"The Mission" is a mediocre film made
grand with a moralistic and epic gloss. It
typifies the high-minded, prestige prod
ucts that the academy seeks to recognize.

The film that the academy obviously
didn't have the guts to nominate this year
is "Blue Velvet," David Lynch's saga of
sexual perversion in small-town America.
"Blue Velvet" was awarded many critics'
prizes for best film, but it is not the type
of endeavor with which the academy likes
to be associated. Although I didn't really
care for the film myself, it would've been
nice to see the academy do something
daring and different this year.
The film that the academy chose to
nominate instead is "Children of a Lesser
God," a harmless, old-fashioned love
story. Although the film contained two
great performances, the overall impact of
the film was about as much as you'd get
from a paperback romance. 1 still think

"Blue Velvet" would have made a more
worthy nomination.
The two pictures that are the front
runners this year are "Platoon" and
"Hannah and Her Sisters." I would like to
see "Hannah and Her Sisters" win. I
thought it was the finest film of the year,
a Woody Allen product full of rich, meaty
characters and funny, well-written
dialogue. It would be a shoo-in for best
picture in any other year, but this year
undoubtedly looks like a "Platoon" year.
"Platoon" is a good movie, even though it

occasionally suffers from its preachy ex
cesses; no film seems destined to deny
"Platoon" its Oscar for best picture. With
all the controversy surrounding it, it just
has too much momentum going for it. It's
a powerful movie about a powerful sub
ject.
Moving on. the pleasant surprise in the
best actor category is James Woods' inclu
sion. Woods is a consistently good actor
who has been consistently overlooked. He
should have been nominated years ago for
"The Onion Field," but at least now he's
getting his due for his frenetic, hyped-up
performance in "Salvador." Unfortun
ately, Woods' presence has closed out the
nods for Jeff Goldblum's superior perfor
mance in"The Fly" and Harrison Ford's

acclaimed performance in"The Mosquito
Coast."
Another interesting nomination in this
category is Dexter Gordon in " 'Round
Midnight." For his performance as an
aging, alcoholic jazz musician, Gordon
joins Dr. Haing S. Ngor of "The Killing
Fields" in the ranks of non-actors who
have been nominated for what are, essen
tially, autobiographical movie roles.
The other nominees are Bob Hoskins
for "Mona Lisa," William Hurt for
"Children of a Lesser God" and Paul New

man for "The Color of Money." After being
written off last year with an honorary
award. Newman has shown the academy
that he still has some steam left in him
with his seventh nomination. He has
never won before and this will probably be
the year that the academy will award New
man an Oscar — not only for his stylish,
flashy performance in"The Color of
Money," but for his entire career.
The biggest surprises in the best
actress category are Jane Fonda for "The
Morning After" and Sigourney Weaver for
"Aliens." Jane Fonda is surprising be
cause she simply didn't deserve a nomina
tion for her overacted, overmannered per
formance. Sigourney Weaver's nod is sur
prising because the academy doesn't

usually recognize the achievements of
action-adventure films.
The other nominations for best actress,
which are less surprising, are Marlee Mat
lin for "Children of a Lesser God," Sissy
Spacek for "Crimes of the Heart" and
Kathleen Turner for "Peggy Sue Got
Married." Marlee Matlin's sensitive,
spirited performance looks like the one to
beat this year.
The biggest surprise in the best sup
porting actor category is not who got
nominated but what one of the con

tenders got nominated for. Despite win
ning numerous critics' awards for his act
ing in "Blue Velvet." the academy instead
nominated Dennis Hopper for his lesser
known role in "Hoosiers" in what looks
like a deliberate "Blue Velvet" snub. While
Hopper was good in "Hoosiers." he prob
ably would have had a better chance of
winning if he had been nominated for his
more prominent, hilariously maniacal
performance in "Blue Velvet."
The other nominees in this category are
Tom Berenger and William Dafoe for
"Platoon," Michael Caine for "Hannah
and Her Sisters" and Denholm Elliot for
"A Room with a View." My money here is
on Tom Berenger for his personification
of pure evil in "Platoon."
I'm not quite sure how Piper Laurie got
nominated for best supporting actress in
"Children of a Lesser God." It was a minor
role that barely registered, and — worse
— she knocked Cathy Tyson out of con
tention, who is much more deserving for
her performance in "Mona Lisa." Other
nominees are Tess Harper for "Crimes of
the Heart," Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio
for "The Color of Money," Maggie Smith
for "A Room with a View" and Dianne
Wiest for "Hannah and Her Sisters." Wiest
has claimed virtually all of the critics'
awards and she deserves to win the Oscar
for her neurotic, man-hungry role in
"Hannah and Her Sisters."
One of the biggest surprises in the best
director category is the inclusion of David
Lynch for "Blue Velvet." Even though the
academy ignored his movie in every other
category, it did give Lynch a deserved
nomination. The nomination that
definitely isn't deserved is Roland Joffe
for "The Mission." Other nominees are
Woody Allen for "Hannah and Her
Sisters." James Ivory for "A Room with a
View" and Oliver Stone for "Platoon." Like
I said before. I'd like to see Woody Allen
win, but Oliver Stone has too much
firepower and will blast everybody else out
of his way.
How important are the Oscars? As I
mentioned, they do have immediate box
office impact, but who can remember who
was the best supporting actor for last
year? Nevertheless, place your bets. The
Oscars will be presented Mar. 30.
