KZSU Picks wants you to know
that no one has ever died from
eating Pop Rocks and Coke, not
even Mikey from the Life cereal
ads. Pop Rocks is a registered
trademark of the General Mills
Food Company, and in no way
suggests a predisposition to a cer
tain genre of music.

Julian Cope: "World Shut Your
Mouth"
Eartha Kitt, Eartha Kitt, Eartha

This guy I know. Brandon, told
me what I needed to know about
this guy before I reviewed him. He
said that Julian used to be In The
Teardrop Explodes, the mid- and
late-'7os psychedelic revival band.
He also has released two solo al
bums before this one. On one of
them, he wore nothing but a big
turtle shell and was trying to
pretend that he was a turtle. He
said that Julian Cope used to be a
guy with long, shaggy hair that
went down to his chin and was the
same length all the way around.
Now, that's kind of funny, I
thought. He sure doesn't seem like
that kind of guy. I mean, take a
look for yourself. On this, his
newest EP. his hair seems to be
normal length and even looks
blow-dried.
So I go back and listen to a pre
vious album of his, also called
"World Shut Your Mouth." Noth
ing very weird about It, no sir; in
fact, it's good old semi-psychedelic
rock 'n' roll with real melodies and
everything. Brandon tells me, "No,
no. he used to do lots of drugs."
Aaaaaaah, I see.
So, I've listened to the EP five
times, and maybe, just maybe,
he's on drugs on one song, but I
think that's studio effects. Other

wise, he sounds exactly like the
Kinks. Now, that's no terrible
thing, especially seeing as how the
Kinks are a fine band and all. The
difference is that this Cope EP is
far better than the latest Kinks LP.
It's got better lyrics, better
melodies, lively, somewhat
raunchy guitar and it's fun to
boot.
I'd recommend this to everyone,
but there's an image problem.
Here's this alleged former druggie
who is a new modern rocker but
sounds like the Kinks and acts
like a turtle. What the heck are
you supposed to wear? I've got no
idea. (JC is playing at Wolfgang's
with The Three O'Clock this

The Beastle Boys: "Licensed to
III"
Julie Newmar, Julie Newmar,

You're a sophisticated person.
You can read The Daily in about
five minutes, do the crossword in
10, circle all the ads for interviews
in two and still have time to catch
"Bloom County"' and "Farm Side"
before devoting the rest of your 11
a.m. class to parsing and
diagramming this review
thoroughly so as to catch every
precious drop of subtle nuance so
carefully laid out for you, the so

phisticated reader.
Well, of course, what you can't
understand as Mr./ Ms. Sophisti
cation '87 is why all record
reviewers like the Beastie Boys so
gosh-darned much. We didn't
either. I mean, we laughed at their
video and thrilled at their single a
coupla times, but doesn't it wear
off eventually? We just assumed it
did.
But the hard, cold fact of it is
that you can't appreciate the B-
Boys until you have the power.
That means you have to be playing
the tape/record/CD/DAT on your
own thing. When someone else is
playing the record like it should
be, really loud, it isn't any fun.
It's irritating even. But when you
have the power coming from your
thing, really loud like it should
be, it's great. Amazing even. Few
records compare to "LTI" in creat
ing the sheer joy of playing some
thing that you know is incredibly
obnoxious and grating to the rest
of world but brings you so much
pleasure. Mr. Rogers' first album
maybe. "TV 'Toons," perhaps. The
Art of Noise, obviously. And the
added advantage of the B-Boys is
that it's actually best listened to
real soft-like and in a studying
type of atmosphere. Just kidding.
But really, in addition to the
cool crunching guitar and the
furniture-shaking bass and the
temple-throbbing drums and the
scratchin' and the yellin' and the
rhymin' about themselves and sex
and themselves and beer and
themselves and school and them
selves and junk food and them
selves and each other, there's
something else. When you hear
these guys who couldn't sing on

key to save their lives having a
great ol' time chanting along to
prerecorded crunch-o-metal, you
think, "Hey! I could do that!" and
your roommate says, "Yeah, you
could," and you say "So why don't
I?" and your roommate says,
"Because you're stupid," and you
beat the heck out of him, just like
you've been wanting to do all quar
ter. Just kidding.
Yeah, it's that last element (not
the roommate bashing part,
before that, about the "you could
do it") that makes the Beasties so
appealing. Oh, sure, 1 know, rap
is-the-wave-of-the-future-because-
i t-incorporat es-and-appeals-to
all-facets-of-rock-and-someday-all-
music-will-be-like-this. Maybe so.
But for now, the reason this is
such a great record is because you
live vicariously through it. Vicaro
rock. You see that anybody can be
a rock star, even if he can't sing
and only knows about six chords
and his name is Adam Horovitz.
It's a terrific feeling. You'll laugh.
You'll yell along. You'll want to
form your own band. But don't.
Your mom will kill you (no kid
ding).

The Golden Palominos: "Blast of
Silence"
Lee Merriweather, Lee Merriweat
her, Lee Merriweather
"The Golden Palominos? Look,
how am I supposed to know if this
is good or not? You can't trust
anyone who reviews Duran Duran
and Bruce Springsteen in the
same breath, and I've never even
heard of these guys." And with

that you begin rummaging
through your pockets to find some
change to buy the Diet Coke that
will keep you awake during the
next 50 minutes.
But wait. Do the names Michael
Stipe, John Lydon, Richard
Thompson, Don Dixon, T-Bone
Burnett, Matthew Sweet or Chris
Stamey ring a bell? No? Better go
back to your pockets. At one time
or another all of these artists have
collaborated with drummer Anton
Fier and a small group of regulars

to create the Golden Palominos.
The result Is a supergroup, at
least by college radio standards.
"Blast of Silence" is the third LP
produced by this eclectic combi
nation. The previous record,
"Visions of Excess." used this con
cept to great effect. The folk
inflected music of the band, paced
by Fier's confident drumming,
was the perfect stage for Stipe.

Thompson and Lydon. Combined,
the three had a hand in seven out
of the eight songs. Their influence
gave the record an intriguing
sound, a sound readily identifia
ble as being a product of those in
dividuals but one that was still
distinct from their efforts else
where.
"Blast of Silence" sorely lacks
the synergistic (bad rock review
adjective no. 37) edge which gave
the previous album its character.
As a result, the new album isn't
bad; it's complacent. Don Dixon
(who sounds amazingly like Dusty
Hill of ZZ Top on this record) and
T-Bone Burnett inject life into a
couple of tracks, but most of the
LP is a retreat from the raw energy
of "Visions."
The change is perhaps best ex
emplified by the band's decision to
include two Lowell George songs
on the album. One would expect
interesting reinterpretations by
the adventurous Fier, but the ef
fort is geared more to sounding
like Little Feat than the Golden
Palominos. The result is good but
a little too easy and relaxed to be
special.
Paradoxically, it appears that
this was a result of Fier having too
much rather than too little control
over "Blast of Silence."
Addendum to the Julian Cope
review: Attention discriminating
record buyer! The record you want
is the album entitled "World Shut
Your Mouth." This is the record
Cope made after he left his former
band The Teardrop Explodes and
declared that he was about to
make a record "eight times better"
than anything The Teardrop Ex
plodes ever recorded. He was
right. Forget this new EP, grab the
LP, which probably costs less
anyway because it's a couple of
years old. English quirk-pop from
heaven — 4 1/2 rating. Ben says
check it out.
