Howl
By Allen Ginsburg
New York: Harper and Row, 1986

Alan Ginsberg's "Howl," perhaps the most-read
contemporary American poem, didn't begin as a
poem at all. According to the author's preface of this
new edition of "Howl," Ginsberg first conceived of the
work as a six-page catalog of "Inspired sympathies"
to be shared with his friend Jack Kerouac. Several
months and drafts later, "Howl" was a finished piece,
and a mimeographed version was sent off to
Ginsberg's friends and mentors.
Since then, the poem has gone through many
refinements in appearance if not content; an
obscenity trial that attempted to banish it from the
public eye made the poem a tenet of American
literary studies and a tenant of high school textbooks
and numerous anthologies. Now, 30 years after its
publication, we have a sleek, coffee-table "Howl,"
containing not only the poem proper but drafts, an
notations, "contemporaneous conversation, legal
skirmishes, precursor texts" and more.
The commemorative edition of "Howl" is a Virgina
Slims dream of a book; it has come a long way
indeed. The question is, has It gone too far? Though
1 found the volume fascinating as a literary curiosity,
I'm unsure that this poem — any poem — should be
treated in exactly this fashion.
The jacket copy points out that the annotation of a
work by a living author is "a rare act." I certainly
wasn't able to come up with any other examples.
Ginsberg, in his author's preface, doesn't come up
with any either, though he does mention that both
Wordsworth and Whitman — great heroes of his —
have written commentaries on their own work. Very
well, but there's a thick line between discussion and
dissection. Moving beyond the tradition of self
criticism, Ginsberg has performed an autopsy on his
own poem — somewhat with the effect of the

biologist who dissects his cat to observe the circula
tion of the blood.
The book is divided into four sections — the first,
facsimile reproductions of "Howl's" successive
drafts, is the one I find most valuable. Each of the
three sections of the poem are given separate com
mentary. describing the number of drafts the section
went through, and giving a brief critical synopsis.
Ginsberg's drafts are faced by a typeset version with
his manuscript corrections printed In red ink.
The manuscripts themselves make the book
worthwhile, as studying them gives a good deal of in
sight into Ginsberg's creative process; one can com
pare each draft both with succesive drafts and the
final poem. The critical comments in front of each
draft, while brief and sometimes obvious, are a good
key to Ginsberg's relationship to "Howl."
But aside from their academic value, the
manuscripts also give the reader the voyeuristic
thrill of looking at an author's unfinished product,
coffee-stained and criss-crossed with corrections. If
this Is what makes you reach for the annotated
"Howl," read on; voyeurism is the theme of the bulk
of the book.
Like many of the works produced by beat
generation authors, the status of "Howl" has always
fluctuated between that of poem and that of social
document. Critics and the public alike have treated
the poem sometimes as a work of art, sometimes as a
beautifully written society column from a weird and
funky time. Ginsberg's publishers seem caught up in
this ambiguity; the jacket copy bills the book both as
a "prophetic masterpiece that changed the course of
American poetry" and "a veritable social history of
the time." The remainder of the book, particularly
the annotations, seems to be far more concerned
with documenting social history then with establish
ing a masterpiece.
After reading the manuscript of the poem, I turned
directly to the annotations, expecting to find several
short critical comments and perhaps a few clarified
obscurities. Instead, I was overwhelmed by 23
packed pages. Reading through the annotations was

like the delicate perusal of a curiosity shop; critical
comments by Ginsberg are grouped with reminis
cences about his drug experiences, mother Naomi,
beat adventures and famous friends. We don't know
what to consider germane to the construction or
criticism of "Howl," and what to simply admire for
weirdness and re-shelve.
My initial feeling about the annotations was that
they were chaotic, but this really isn't the case. Their
ordering correlates to the ordering of the stanzas in
the poem; this is logical enough. But since the anno
tations are not printed beside the manuscript but in
their own section, one loses the urge to continually
refer back to the poem and starts to read them on
their own, as a pastiche of all the mental mutterings
that went on In Ginsberg's mind at the time "Howl"
was written.
It is their first-person authority that differentiates
these annotations from any others I've read;
Ginsberg almost seems to want to give us a rough
draft of his mind at the time he wrote "Howl," in ad
dition to giving us a rough draft of the poem itself.
But such a scrapbook is bound to leave out pieces,
and I ultimately don't trust it. The annotations,
though they fascinated me and brought me closer to
the events surrounding the poem, didn't bring me
any closer to the poem itself.
The oddest part of this edition of "Howl" is the sec
tion titled "Carl Solomon Speaks," in which the
"mythical dedicatee" of the poem talks of himself, in
sanity and the playwright Artaud. Solomon was a
one-time fellow mental patient of Ginsberg's; at the
time of the poem's conception he had been recom
mitted. I don't know exactly why Ginsberg decided to
give Solomon his own chapter in this book; perhaps
I'll have to wait for the annotated edition of the an
notated "Howl." And I don't know exactly how to
react; it is very well and nice to meet Solomon, but
having him speak about a poem written in his name
— and occasionally pop up in the annotations to
comment on the action — gives the book an absur
dist quality.
When I was through with this book, I felt that per

haps I'd read it the wrong way — that is, perhaps it's
not meant to be read at all, but rather used as a refer
ence book or memory album. Now that I have read it,
I'm not sure how I feel about "Howl" anymore, either;
I've become more Interested in the parts and less in
the whole. I suppose that's the danger of looking at
anything too closely; pity that Ginsberg felt his 30-
year-old poem so worthy of exegesis.


Allen Ginsburg, shown here in the '50s, has
recently reissued his poem "Howl," complete with
his own annotations.
