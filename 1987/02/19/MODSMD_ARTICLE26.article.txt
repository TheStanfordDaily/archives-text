## Stanford golf ends up third 
### ROBERT PORTNOY Staff writer 
After Tuesday's record
setting 4-under-par 68,
what could Kathleen
McCarthy possibly do for an
encore?
Plenty. In yesterday's final
round of the Arizona Inter
collegiate in Tucson, the
Stanford senior fired a one
under 71 to set a tourna
ment and course record of
213 and capture the individ
ual title.
As a ttam, the Cardinal
shot 294, breaking 300 for
the first time this season. A
three-day total of 904 earned
15th-ranked Stanford a
third-place finish. Third
ranked UCLA shot 883 to
win the team championship
by 13 strokes over USC.
"Kathleen was just mag
nificent. Her ball-striking
was probably the best I've
ever seen it. Randolph Golf
Course is a difficult layout
and she beat a tremendous
group of individuals in this
field," Coach Tim Baldwin
said.
"The girls have been
working hard and we needed
a confidence-builder like
this. It will be somewhat rep
resentative of the rest of the
year," Baldwin added.
Indeed. McCarthy's final-round
71 could've been even better.
"She played so well and knocked
the ball so damn close, It got
frustrating to her because she
couldn't make any putts, and
she's a great putter. If she was
putting the way she's capable, she
would've shot 29 or 30 on the
front nine. It was just a tremen
dous display of tee-to-green play."
Baldwin said.
Though she didn't know It be
cause her closest competitor teed
off nearly an hour after her, as

McCarthy teed It up on the 16th
hole she had just a one-shot lead
over U.S. International's Laurette
Maritz.
The final three holes had not
been kind to McCarthy in Tucson.
The first day of the tournament
she bogeyed all three. This time
around she attacked them when it
counted the most.
"The 16th is a par-5 with water
in front of the green. It wasn't
high percentage after my tee shot
to go for it In two. I knocked my
third shot to about 10 feet and
made birdie." McCarthy said.
"I had two girls on my tail
(Maritz and Arizona State's Pam
Wright), and I knew I had to shoot
par or better to win It. Maritz and I
have gone head-to-head a lot of

times In the past three years.
Seventeen and 18 become very
tough holes under pressure tourn
ament conditions, especially with
water guarding the second shot
Into the 18th green."
McCarthy's only other birdie of
the day came on the par-5 fifth
hole. She knocked a five-Iron
second shot stiff to within five feet
of the hole but missed the eagle
putt. She tapped it in and moved
to one-under-par.
The round's one blemish oc
curred on the 11th. a par-3. After
a poor tee shot, she dropped a five
foot knee-knocker to salvage a
bogey.
"Today was one of the toughest
rounds 1 think I've ever played.

mentally and emotionally. I had so
many conversations with myself
to keep going and keep that edge."
McCarthy said.
"In the lead, you're not catching
anybody, and you have to play
little games with yourself to keep
together. I really wanted to win
this thing badly because I knew
the game was there to do It, that I
was playing well enough, and the
conditions were perfect."
Cardinal sophomore Clare
Dolan shot 72 on the final day to
finish at 227. Junior Trlsh
McConigle shot 75 to wind up at
231. Senior Adrlenne Gllmartin's
76 put her at 233, and Junior Kay
Cornelius posted a 78 for a 235
total.
