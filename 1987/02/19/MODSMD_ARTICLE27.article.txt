### KEN STEVENS Editorial staff 
At the outset of yesterday's
women's tennis match between
Stanford and Santa Clara, the
swirling winds at the Stanford
Tennis Stadium threatened to
blow potential winning shots
right off the court.
By the end of the match, the
winds had died down, but the
Cardinal rackets continued to
roar as No. 1 ranked Stanford
blew away the visiting Broncos 9-
0.
"This was a good way to send us
off to Arizona." Coach Frank Bren
nan said, referring to the Card
inal's road trip this weekend that
opens the Pacific 10 Conference
season.
Stanford overwhelmed Santa
Clara yesterday — winning each of
the 18 sets that were played — to
increase its dual-match record to
4-0. In addition, the Cardinal
remained undefeated in singles
action this season.
Junior Cari Hagey was the first
to notch a victory for Stanford.
Playing at No. 4 singles, Hagey
employed an aggressive net game
to turn away Santa Clara's Jenni
fer Steen, 6-2, 6-0.
Stanford's Jackie Joseph played
her first match of the season yes
terday, but her performance at No.
6 singles must have left Santa
Clara's Kathy Voile wondering why
the Cardinal senior isn't always in
the lineup. Joseph dropped Voile
6-1, 6-1 to give Stanford a 2-0
lead.
Freshman Lisa Green continued
the Cardinal onslaught and her
flawless singles record with a 6-2,
6-1 win over Catherine Beuregard
in the No. 3 singles match.
Playing at No. 1 for the second

straight match, senior Stephanie
Savides won again, defeating the
Broncos' Shaun Considine 6-3, 6-
2to give Stanford a 4 ; 0 advantage.
"Stephanie's been doing a v pretty
good job," Brennan said. "She's
been winning in straight sets,
which is always tough for her. She
can lose a set real easily."
Another player that continues
to be impressive at the top of the
lineup for the Cardinal is junior
Kay Tittle. In the No. 2 spot for the
third consecutive match. Tittle
found trying to keep the wind
from blowing her hat off to be
more difficult than beating Santa
Clara's Kim Grace. She won 6-2.
6-3 to clinch the team victory for
Stanford.
Freshman Valerie Wilson
finished off the singles sweep with
a 6-3, 6-2 win over the Broncos'
Tina Crivello in the No. 5 singles.
The Cardinal doubles tandems
found the going no tougher. Tittle
and Green dumped Considine and
Beuregard 6-1, 6-3 in the No. 1
match. Hagey and Wilson
disposed of Steen and Grace 6-4.
6-0 in the No. 2 doubles, and
Savides and Joseph routed Santa
Clara's Maureen Feltz and Amy
Leonard 6-0, 6-3 in the No. 3
match.
Stanford's success yesterday
was not limited to the victory over
Santa Clara. Senior Patty Fen
dick. the Cardinal's top singles
performer, advanced to the third
round of the Virginia Slims of
Florida professional tournament
in Boca Raton.
Fendick, who defeated high
school senior Halle Cioffi 6-3, 6-1
in the first round, knocked off
Lisa Bonder 6-2, 6-4 in yesterday's
second round to advance to


Lisa Romerein/Dally
Freshman Lisa Green has yet to lose a singles match this year. Yesterday playing in the No. 3 position,
she knocked off Santa Clara's Catherine Beuregard 6-2, 6-1 to help lead a 9-0 Cardinal sweep of the
Broncos in which Stanford did not lose a single set.
today's match against Helena
Sukova.
Should Fendick upset Sukova
and advance into tomorrow's
fourth round, a conflict would
arise for the defending NCAA

singles champion. Stanford
battles Arizona State tomorrow, a
match in which Fendick's services
will be necessary, according to
Brennan.
"If she wins (against Sukova),
we have a problem." Brennan
said. "The basic agreement was
that she'd be in Arizona come hell
or high water."
