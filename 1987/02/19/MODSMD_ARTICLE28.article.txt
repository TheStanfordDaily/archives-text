# Top-ranked Bruins spike Stanford
## 
### ALICIA KENT Staff writer 
Starting its road trip with a setback, the Stanford
men's volleyball team will have to re-evaluate its ap
proach after its shutout loss of 15-7, 15-8, 15-7 to
No. 1 UCLA at the Bruin's Pauley Pavilion last night.
This loss gives the No. 6 Cardinal a 3-2 conference
record and 12-5 overall mark. Although Stanford was
the underdog going into the match, the loss was still
a tough one for the spikers to accept, in that they
have two more conference games on the road this
weekend that they must be mentally prepared for.
"The next two matches are very important," Stan
ford Coach Fred Sturm said. "We'll have to get
prepared in two days of practice."
The Bruins clearly outplayed the Cardinal last
night, using their experience to dominate the 65-
minute match. UCLA, with a 19-3 overall record and
a 5-0 conference mark, now leads the Western Inter
collegiate Volleyball Association.
The key to the Bruins' victory last night was their
ability to expose Stanford's weaknesses. "We met the
enemy tonight and the enemy was us," Sturm said.
The last time Stanford faced UCLA, on Feb. 6, it
lost by a similiar score of 15-8, 15-11, 15-4. However,
that match seemed to be quite a different effort on
the Cardinal's part, as the team played one of its best
serving and siding-out matches of the season.
Last night, the Bruins' powerful and varied serving
and Stanford's weaker receiving lineup led to the
Cardinal's downfall. "They dictated where we went by
serving and blocking very well. They were able to
limit our options with blocks and serves to players
and zones that are vulnerable," Sturm said.
Part of the Cardinal's problem last night was the
emphasis the spikers placed on this one match. "We
may have taken this match too seriously. I may have
asked too much for this kind of a match." Sturm
said.
He said he felt that the team was emotionally tense
before the match, leading to its 29 errors and low hit
ting percentage of .096, compared to UCLA's 14 er
rors and .342 percentage.
However, Sturm said the Cardinal was able to
learn from last night's errors. "We are more aware of
how vulnerable we are and where we need to im
prove," he said.
