# Tennis set to face Cal in Kentucky

### JON WEISMAN Staff writer 
Playing in what Stanford
Coach Dick Gould termed the
"miniature NCAAs," the Stan
ford men's tennis team begins
its most challenging test of the
non-conference season tonight
at the National Team Indoors in
Louisville, Ky.
As its seedings are based on
the pre-season rankings
released at the beginning of
this year, the tournament con
sists of virtually every top col
lege team in the country, in
cluding the top five of USC,
Southern Methodist, UCLA,
Pepperdine and Texas.
"[Those rankings] can be
really off," Gould said, explain
ing that many teams did not
compete at full strength in the
fall season on which they are
based. "We're a little high, espe
cially without Patrick
(McEnroe)."
McEnroe, who returned to
play doubles in the NorCal In
tercollegiate in Berkeley after a
two-tournament absence, is
still bothered by injured feet
and did not make the trip.
The sixth-ranked Cardinal's
first foe will be 15th-ranked
California, which defeated Mi
chigan yesterday in a prelimi
nary match. 6-3. If Stanford
wins, it will play the winner of
the Texas Christian-UCLA
match tomorrow; a loss would

put the Cardinal in the consola
tion bracket against the TCU
UCLA loser.
The Cardinal will probably be
relying on singles to carry it
through the tournament. Jeff
Tarango, a finalist at the Nor-
Cal, and Scott Moody, elevated
to no. 2 in singles based on his
three-win performance in
Berkeley last weekend, head
the lineup.
The rest of the singles players
this weekend are Geordie
McKee, Jeff Cathrall, Barry Ric
hards and Curtis Dunn.
Stanford's doubles teams
this season have seen more
partners than dancers in a Vir
ginia reel. Tonight, Tarango
and Moody pair up for the first
time, followed by Cathrall and
Eric Peus and two of either
Dunn. Richards or McKee.
Although Stanford doubles
this season has been character
ized by uneven play, the injur
ies to McEnroe and Mark
Jacobsen may be the foremost
cause of the lineup instability.
Jacobsen, whose only action
this season was with Moody in
a win in the season opener
against Utah, underwent elbow
surgery two weeks ago.
'He's reasonably healthy
now." Gould said. "It's healing
very well. We'll.try to get him in
the lineup in a week or so. I
would expect after this our
lineup will be more solid than it
is."
