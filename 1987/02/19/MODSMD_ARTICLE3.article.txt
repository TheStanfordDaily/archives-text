# Stanford and Candlestick boosted as 1991 Bowl sites

The Bay Area Super Bowl Task Force
last week made Its bid for the 1991 Super
Bowl, offering either Stanford Stadium or
Candlestick Park as sites for the National
Football League's championship game.
"I think there is a good chance that the
Bay Area will be one of the iareas) that will
make the short list," said Stanford Assoc.
Athletic Director Alan Cummlngs. The
NFL will choose three or four cities as
finalists at a March 14 meeting in Hawaii,
Cummlngs said.

"But whether that means Stanford or
Candlestick, I just don't know,"he said.
Cummlngs accompanied the Bay Area
Super Bowl Task Force last week at its bid
presentation before a four-member NFL
subcommittee in New York.
"(My) preference Is Stanford," said state
Sen. Quentln Kopp, founder and chair
man of the task force. "But we offered
Stanford or Candlestick â€” take your pick.
Stanford has more tickets to sell than
Candlestick. On the other hand. Candles
tick will have 100 new luxury suites by
then."
Kopp cited Stanford Stadium's 84,000-

person capacity, Stanford's public transit
facilities, its "gorgeous campus, un
matched west of the Mississippi." and the
concurrence of the University's centen
nial celebration with the 25th anniver
sary of the Super Bowl as arguments in
favor of holding the game here.
Stanford's "down side" includes the
bench seating and low number of
restrooms at the stadium, both of which
will need to be improved. Kopp said.
He also described the attitude of Palo
Alto as negative and said the city has com
plained about its experience with the

1985 Super Bowl, which was held at
Stanford.
According to Kopp, Palo Alto officials
were dissatisfied with some of the ar
rangements of the 1985 Super Bowl and
want access to 1,500 tickets for Super
Bowl XV should it be held in Stanford
Stadium. "I think the NFL set an unfor
tunate precedent by allocating tickets to
Pasadena officials (for this year's Super
Bowl)," Kopp said.
As host of the 1985 Super Bowl, Stan
ford made "several millions of dollars of
improvements" on its stadium using cor
porate and business contributions, ac

cording to Cummings. If Stanford hosts
Super Bowl XXV, a 50 percent increase in
restroom facilities and improved alumi
num seating would be needed, he said.
"There is no fund set aside for these im
provements," Cummings said, but added
that the University "would be looking in
that direction again, in working with the
Bay Area Task Force" to raise funds for an
upcoming Super Bowl.
Kopp said the University's chances of
hosting the 25th Bowl may be enhanced
as a result of stadium innovations made
