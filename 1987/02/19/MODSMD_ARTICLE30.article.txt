# Steeling becoming one of Pac-10's best
## Freshman leading conference in free throws, team in rebounding 
### ED STACKLER Staff writer 
Stanford's new "garbage collector" is certainly a
welcome addition to Maples Pavilion. However, this
person is not a new janitor hired by the Athletic De
partment to clean up the stands after games. The
Stanford women's basketball team's new "garbage
collector." as Coach Tara VanDerveer puts it. is
freshman starter Katy Steding
So why call a player like Steding, who leads the
Cardinal in rebounds and is one of the team's seven
main starters, a "garbage collector"? As VanDerveer
says, it is a compliment. Teammate Evon Asforis
sums up the description of Katy best: "She's always
at the right place at the right time. . . . When I think
of Katy. i think of a person who goes to the boards
hard."
Teammate Kami Anderson agrees. "If there's a
loose ball. Katy's there," she says.
"Steady" Steding. as Coach VanDerveer calls her.
began starting for the Cardinal after the second
game of the season against UNLV. In that game As
foris was injured and Steding was called in from the
bench to replace her. Since then Steding has joined
the starting seven, playing the positions of small and
power forward.
This season has been a big step up from where she
started her basketball career in Lake Oswego. Ore. At

Lake Oswego High School, she played both varsity
basketball and volleyball. She excelled in basketball,
however, and was named league MVP for three con
secutive years and was a Converse All-Amcrican.
When it came time to choose a college. Steding said
she had six or seven universities in mind. Soon,
however, she had narrowed her search down to
Washington. California and Stanford. In November
1985 she signed a letter of intent to play ball for the
Cardinal.
November was a relatively early time for a senior to
commit to any college team. What made the choice so
easy for her? "The reason 1 came here was because of
the coaches and the people on the team more than
anything else." Steding says.
Beyond her role as the garbage collector who takes
advantage of a play gone wrong, much of Steding's
contribution to the team can be described by one
word: rebound.
"Her definite strength is her rebounding, of
fensively and defensively." says Anderson.
And for VanDerveer there is no question about it.
"Katy is easily our best offensive rebounder — she
works to get position." she says. Steding now leads
Stanford and is sixth in the Pacific 10 Conference in
rebounding, with an average of 8.3 boards per game.
And that isn't all Steding can do. She leads the
entire Pac-10 in free throw percentage with an 88.9
percent average. Steding also has the second-highest

scoring average on the team at 1 1.4 points per game.
In spite of all this success, Steding has little praise
for herself and much hope for improvement. It is this
drive of Steding's . VanDerveer claims, that sets the
freshman apart from the average player.
"Almost without exception, Katy is the first person
on the floor at practice, working," VanDerveer says.
"She's a battler. She doesn't take losing easy, and
that's good."
Of herself. Steding speaks only of improvement,
and she attributes much of her success to others.
"My mom has been real supportive, keeping me
playing when I was down," she notes. Her high
school basketball coach was another important fig
ure in her early basketball days. "I looked up to him
— he was a good role model for me," she says. "He
was always there for me to talk to."
And of improvement? "I think I need to play even
better defense and work harder offensively at helping
out the point guard. Hopefully I'll look to drive a lot
more offensively and move better without the ball."
she says.
Steding also admits that it has not been an easy
season for her. "I was intimidated" by the college
game initially, she says. "It was hard at first. The in
tensity was a big step up for me." But she worked
steadily at her game and is now "getting used to the

If Steding was intimidated by
the college competition. It wasn't
apparent In her performance.
"Intimidation isn't a word in her
vocabulary," VanDerveer says.

All of her hard work is now
paying off. VanDerveer says that
Steding is definitely one of the
best freshman players in the Pac
-10. and she may be one of the top
contenders for the Pac-10 Fresh
man of the Year Award.
A garbage collector? Maybe. But

rebounding, with an average of 8.3 boards per game.
And that isn't all Steding can do. She leads the
entire Pac-10 in free throw percentage with an 88.9
percent average. Steding also has the second-highest

scoring average on the team at 1 1.4 points per game.
In spite of all this success, Steding has little praise
for herself and much hope for improvement. It is this
drive of Steding's . VanDerveer claims, that sets the
freshman apart from the average player.
"Almost without exception, Katy is the first person
on the floor at practice, working," VanDerveer says.

that's good."

out the point guard. Hopefully I'll look to drive a lot
more offensively and move better without the ball."

Stanford's new "garbage collector" is certainly a
welcome addition to Maples Pavilion. However, this
person is not a new janitor hired by the Athletic De
partment to clean up the stands after games. The
Stanford women's basketball team's new "garbage
collector." as Coach Tara VanDerveer puts it. is
freshman starter Katy Steding
So why call a player like Steding, who leads the
Cardinal in rebounds and is one of the team's seven
main starters, a "garbage collector"? As VanDerveer
says, it is a compliment. Teammate Evon Asforis
sums up the description of Katy best: "She's always
at the right place at the right time. . . . When I think
of Katy. i think of a person who goes to the boards
hard."
Teammate Kami Anderson agrees. "If there's a
loose ball. Katy's there," she says.
"Steady" Steding. as Coach VanDerveer calls her.
began starting for the Cardinal after the second
game of the season against UNLV. In that game As
foris was injured and Steding was called in from the
bench to replace her. Since then Steding has joined
the starting seven, playing the positions of small and
power forward.
This season has been a big step up from where she
started her basketball career in Lake Oswego. Ore. At

Lake Oswego High School, she played both varsity
basketball and volleyball. She excelled in basketball,
however, and was named league MVP for three con
secutive years and was a Converse All-Amcrican.
When it came time to choose a college. Steding said
she had six or seven universities in mind. Soon,
however, she had narrowed her search down to
Washington. California and Stanford. In November
1985 she signed a letter of intent to play ball for the
Cardinal.
November was a relatively early time for a senior to
commit to any college team. What made the choice so
easy for her? "The reason 1 came here was because of
the coaches and the people on the team more than
anything else." Steding says.
Beyond her role as the garbage collector who takes
advantage of a play gone wrong, much of Steding's
contribution to the team can be described by one
word: rebound.
"Her definite strength is her rebounding, of
fensively and defensively." says Anderson.
And for VanDerveer there is no question about it.
"Katy is easily our best offensive rebounder — she
works to get position." she says. Steding now leads
