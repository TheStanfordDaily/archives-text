SAN DIEGO â€” Last weekend
was one of mixed accommoda
tions, mixed weather and mixed
emotions at the annual San Diego
"Winter Crystal" Ultimate Frisbee
Tournament.
The Stanford men's ultimate
frisbee team, overcoming a forget
table night In a just as forgettable
hotel obtained at the cost of *30
per night, opened Saturday s play
by trouncing UC-Berkeley 15-8. It
was a big win. but the victories
were not yet over.
The next game truly demon
strated Stanford's potential, as an
inspired defense overpowered a
baffled UC-Davls squad and the
team jumped out to an 11-2 lead.
The Bulldogs retired to their ken
nels after the Cardinal completed
a 15-8 rout.
"I have never seen such inten
sity. even on last year's team," co
captaln Peter Scheman said. "We
played some defense."
But the intensity wasn't quite

enough, as Stanford dropped a
close battle with UC-Santa Bar
bara by a count of 15-12. "I have
no doubts we will beat these guys
come reglonals," Keith Sarkislan
said. "We just need to concentrate
and not let up in the middle of the
game."
With the end of the day's play
came a third-place seeding for
Sunday, a bye in the round of 16
and Improved lodgings as the
team moved to a nicer hotel.
Sunday dawned dull and
drizzly, but Cardinal optimism
seemed high. Stanford's quarter
final opponent was perennial
power Chabot College. The game
was close-fought for two hours,
but Chabot finally pulled out a 15-
12 victory.
"I'm disappointed," Jim Nichol
son said. "After yesterday's play I
feel we are potentially the best
(collegiate) team on the West
Coast."
