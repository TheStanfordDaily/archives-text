Structural changes in the Constitution
have become necessary to curb the power of a
presidency that has become "increasingly in
efficient and alarmingly dangerous," History
Prof. Carl Degler suggested in a debate last
night with History Prof. Jack Rakove in
Branner Lounge.
Rakove claimed that the framers of the
Constitution intended to grant the president
considerable autonomy from the legislative
branch, and cited the Constitution itself as
evidence.
The framers of the Constitution concen
trated primarily on how the president should
be elected and left the actual powers of the
executive branch ambiguous, Rakove
argued. The fact that the House of Represen
tatives chooses the president if the electoral
college fails to do so suggests an intention to
guarantee "some degree of independence of
the president" from the Senate, with which a
president has to deal on a regular basis, he
said.
Rakove also cited examples of strong gover
nors in the late 18th century who caused the
constitutional framers to recognize the pos
sibility of an autonomous executive
"enhancing the presidency."
In reference to Watergate and the recent
Iran-contra arms crisis, however, Rakove
conceded that "something is fundamentally

awry when even strong presidents find them
selves in these positions."
Degler said he found the basic problem
with the presidency to be both an inflated
image of the presidency and its increased
Isolation from Congress.
Over the past 20 years, presidents have
become increasingly pretentious, and the
size of their staffs has increased. Degler said.
Furthermore, there are no effective chains
on presidential power except quadrennial
elections, he added. Congressional power to
override vetos and to enact legislation limit
ing executive power only leads the president
to act without consulting Congress, he said.
"The very separation of Congress and the
president as set forth in the Constitution en
courages the president to evade limits on
what he sees as his legitimate power," Degler
said.
He cited as evidence President Johnson's
handling of public opinion during the Viet
nam War. President Nixon's Watergate scan
dal and President Carter's loss of respect and
inability to govern.
President Reagan appeared at first to
"rescue the office." Degler said, but with the
outbreak of the Iran-contra crisis, it is evi
dent that even Reagan "has not escaped the
defects of his predecessors."
The solution, according to Degler, is to
minimize the separation between the presi
dent and Congress, which would require
"structural alterations" in the Constitution.

He suggested a separation of what he saw
as the two functions of the president: chief of
state and chief policy-maker. The fact that
the president is seen as "the symbol of
America" makes it difficult for people to
criticize him and his policies, Degler said.
He contrasted the American system with
the British, in which the queen symbolizes
England and the prime minister manages
the country. The British people can criticize
Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's policies
without symbolically deriding their country,
Degler said.
A parliamentary system with less division
between the executive and legislative
branches "would certainly mean more effi
cient government" with fewer disputes be
tween the president and Congress, Degler
noted. "The president would become an arm
of the legislature, rather than an an
tagonist."
In recent years, disputes between the two
branches of government have replaced those
between political parties, Degler said. Less
than half of congressmen vote with their
party now. compared to 70 percent in 1900.
Most presidents in the past two decades have
had to deal with congressional majorities of
the opposing party. One-third of American
voters now register as independent.
According to Degler, this decline in the
U.S. party system parallels the recent decline
in voter participation.
