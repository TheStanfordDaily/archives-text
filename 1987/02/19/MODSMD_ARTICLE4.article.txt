# Farm suicides few; prevention stressed

### MARK LAWRENCE Senior staff writer 
Although the media have
recently devoted much atten
tion to a probable suicide by a
Stanford professor and a
suicide attempt by a student,
University officials say suicide
among Stanford students —
while always an alarming issue
— is not of particular concern
this year.
At any one time there are
about 55 Stanford students
"seriously working with the op
tion of suicide," according to
Dr. Vincent D'Andrea, associ
ate director of Counseling and
Psychological Services (CAPS)
at the Cowell Student Health
Center. "But it's not as big a
problem as people think." he
said.
There is an average of 1.2
successful suicides per year
among Stanford students, he
said.
Stanford maintains an array
of students and faculty and a
professional staff of 13 coun
selors at CAPS to help students
through psychological difficul
ties. Resident assistants, fel
lows and deans are instructed
in counseling, handling crises
and referring cases to profes
sional counselors.
This "hands-on" approach to
student non-academic life
makes Stanford fairly success
ful among comparable univer
sities at helping its psychologi
cally troubled students, and
this approach keeps Stanford's
suicide rate on "the better side
of average," said Dean of Stu
dent Affairs James Lyons.

Nationally, 19 of every
100,000 people between the
ages of 18 and 25 will commit
suicide, according to statistics
provided by D'Andrea. The rate
is 12 per 100,000 for college
students between those ages,
he said.
Stanford's suicide rate has
remained stable for the last 17
to 18 years, and its student
population has remained at
about 13,000, D'Andrea said.
The characteristics of a
suicidal student have also
remained stable over those
years. D'Andrea said.
Typically, Stanford students
contemplating suicide are male
graduate students who have a
background of disappoint
ment. depression or loss,
whether academic, family or
personal, D'Andrea said.
At Stanford, most students
who attempt suicide have not
received counseling at CAPS,
he said.
"We think we do a pretty good
job with them," D'Andrea said.
"But when they don't come in.
obviously we don't have a
chance."
Lyons said residence officials
find suicide a difficult issue,
since the circumstances of
each case are generally very dif
ferent.
"We pay close attention to see
if there's something special
that relates to environment
over which we have some con
trol," Lyons said.
In an emergency, resident as
sistants and fellows are in
structed to call 911 and Cowell
immediately.
