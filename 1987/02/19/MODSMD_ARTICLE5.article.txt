# Fac Sen to debate land use changes
## 
### JOHN POLLACK Senior staff writer 
Ideas for a new governance structure aimed
at resolving conflicts between Stanford, faculty
and the local community regarding the devel
opment of University land for academic
purposes will be discussed at today's Faculty
Senate meeting.
The discussion will explore the necessity of
creating "more explicit processes for express
ing the concerns of campus residents and for
resolving apparent conflicts between those

concerns and academic decisions," according
to a memo acting University President James
Rosse sent last week to senate members.
In other business, the senate will consider a
motion to censure Hoover Institution Director
W. Glenn Campbell for claiming that, because
of the Reagan Library's location here, Stanford
can "boast" of a "Reagan connection."
The senate will also consider adoption and
implementation of two resolutions: one provid
ing for "substantial Academic Council repre
sentation" in decision-making processes con
cerning programming at the Reagan Library,

and one calling for a presentation of the li
brary's architectural plans to the senate "in
the near future."
The impetus to discuss ideas regarding a
new governance structure arises in part from
the controversy surrounding the location of
the Reagan Library and the development of fac
ulty housing on the site of the Ryan Labora
tory. According to Rosse, these issues contrib
ute "urgency" to the discussion.
Currently, most recommendations regard-
Ing the development of University
land for academic purposes are
made by the Committee on Land
and Building Development, whose
members are appointed by the
University president.
Some special projects, such as

the renovation of the Inner Quad
and the development of the Near
West Campus, are handled sepa
rately.
A new governance structure, if
developed and adopted, might al
low faculty and community mem
bers to provide input on develop
ment proposals earlier in the ad
ministrative process than is cur
rently possible.
