# Life as a Dollie: Not just for kicks
## 
### FELICIA PAIK Editorial staff 
There are several rites of winter
that indicate spring quarter at
Stanford is fast approaching.
We make extravagant fun-filled
plans for spring break. Lagunita
begins to fill up. We begin to dis
card our sweaters and scarfs for
shorts and T-shirts in anticipa
tion of sunny California weather.
And the tryouts for the new Dollies
are held.
Dollie tryouts began Feb. 9, and
the new Dollies will be chosen Feb.
28. This year's Dollies are glad
their tenure is over, but they agree
they will miss the camaraderie
and responsibility.
"I'm ready for it to be over be
cause being a Dollie is time
consuming and exhausting. But I
would do it again even knowing
what I know now," said sopho
more Dineen Johnson.
"I think I'll miss the friendships
the most. I feel like I'll be friends
with some of the people (in the
Band) even in 20 years," said Julie
Nasif, a sophomore.
"All of us feel like picking up an
instrument so we can still be in

Stanford Dollies Julie Nasif, Dineen Johnson. Vicky Takatsuka, Katie Genshlea and Lisa Larragoite love
the fun and excitement of their jobs but say that their positions involve responsibility and commitment
the Band," said junior Lisa Lar
ragolte.
Although each woman acknowl
edged the fun and excitement of
being a Dollle. each stressed the
responsibility and commitment of
the position.
"We have no choreographer or
director. We make up our own
routines and schedule our
practices." Larragolte said. "It's
up to us how much we practice."
Academics are also hard to bal
ance with Dollie activities, accord
ing to Larragolte and sophomore
Vlcki Takatsuka. Each Dollie took
an average of 12 units during fall
quarter, but each is taking a regu
lar load this quarter.
"If you take fewer units, you
have to work that much harder
the following year," said Takat
suka, an industrial engineering
major.
"You could take a full load but
then you wouldn't be able to enjoy
being a Dollie as much," said Lar
ragolte, a history major.
Besides performing at Stanford
sporting events, the Dollies and
the Band are periodically invited
to perform at weddings, openings
of restaurants and the other such
events.

"Many people don't realize that
we perform outside of football and
basketball games." Larragoite
said.
They were all quick to define
and defend the position of a
Dollle.
"Some people think that we are
totally worthless, but then there
are others who really like us," Lar
ragoite said.
"What makes It (being a Dollie) a
good thing is that we're not cheer
leaders. The Band is an entertain
ing group, and we just add to the
performance, " she explained.
"We're just part of a song and
dance group," she said.
"Our goal is to promote spirit for
the sport by dancing and using
our energy. We're not cheerleaders
looking to lead anyone," Johnson
said.
This year's Dollies also offered
words of advice to those aspiring
to assume the challenging posi
tions.
"People should try out If they
love to dance. But, you also should
know that there Is a responsibility
and (there are) commitments to
keep," Naslf said.
"Have fun at the tryouts. Don't
be uptight or have any precon
ceived notions," Johnson added.
"And It's still not too late to
audition," she said.
