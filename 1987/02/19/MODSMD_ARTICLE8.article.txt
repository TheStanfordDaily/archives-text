Regan's decision: Quit or stay
WASHINGTON — President Reagan declared yesterday that he
won't fire his embattled chief of staff, Donald Regan, but added
that he wouldn't stand In the way If Regan decides to quit.
Asked by reporters whether Regan would stay on as chief of
staff, the president paused for a moment and said, "This is up to
him." Speaking deliberately, he then added a formulation he has
often used when an official was expected to resign.
"I have always said that when the people that I've asked to come
into government feel that they have to return to private life, that's
their business and I will never try to talk them out of It," Reagan
said, responding to reporters' questions at an Oval Office picture
taking ceremony for the first time in nearly three months.
Regan, standing behind the president and Israel Prime Minister
Yitzhak Shamir, appeared startled by the exchange. But he had
recovered his composure when he strolled smilingly along a
colonnade with the president after the Shamir meeting.
Reporters shouted questions, asking the president if Regan
were leaving. "No," Reagan replied. They then put the same ques
tion to Regan, who looked at the president and said, "It's up to
him."
Parties to sponsor 1988 debates
WASHINGTON — The Republican and Democratic parties will
Jointly sponsor 1988 presidential debates, the parties' chairmen
announced yesterday, dismaying the League of Women Voters,
which has run the debates since 1976.
Democratic National Chairman Paul Kirk Jr. and Republican
National Chairman Frank Fahrenkopf Jr. said that the parties
had decided to form a bipartisan, non-profit commission to con
duct the nationally televised forums so that they can play a greater
role In that crucial aspect of the presidential campaign.
Representatives of the league, meanwhile, charged that party
sponsored debates would inevitably give short shrift to third-party
candidates and would amount to no more than a "political pillow
fight."
"I think they're trying to steal the debate from the American
voter, not the League of Women Voters." said league President
Nancy Neuman, who declared that her organization would
proceed with plans for three 1988 presidential debates and one
vice-presidential debate. She said that she was confident the can
didates will cooperate.
At the heart of the dispute is a desire by the parties to assert
control over the organization and format of the debates, which
can have more voter impact than any other single candidate ap
pearances during the latter stages of the campaign. The league,
however, seems determined to retain the high profile role that has
lent it considerable prestige over the last 10 years.
Park service to establish fees
WASHINGTON — If a ticket booth for tourists appears at Ford's
Theater, can a fee for visitors to the Washington Monument be far
behind?
Nope. The National Park Service already has drawn up plans to
add Washington's trademark obelisk, along with St. Louis'
Gateway Arch and Abraham Lincoln's home In Springfield, 111., to
the list of pay-as-you-go national parks and memorials if an ex
perimental program under way this year gets permanent approval
from Congress.
Seventy-two federal parks and monuments that used to be free
for the looking will be charging entrance fees this year, from the
Statue of Liberty In New York Harbor to the Montana battlefield
where Lt. Col. George Custer fought his last stand.
At 62 other sites, prices are going up for the first time In 15
years. It will cost *5 a carload, instead of *2, to leaf-peep along the
Skyline Drive in Shenandoah National Park or to peer into the
maw of the Grand Canyon.
The experiment marks at least a partial victory for the adminis
tration in its six-year battle to increase the gate at national parks.
The Interior Department has trotted out the proposal at budget
time every year since 1981 as part of a general strategy of "user
fees" aimed at making government programs more self
supporting, and every year the enthusiasm was wan.
Opposition wins in Irish voting
DUBLIN, Ireland — Ireland headed toward a change in govern
ment last night, as vote counts from Tuesday's nationwide elec
tion indicated massive losses for Prime Minister Garret
FitzGerald's Fine Gael party.
With final tallies not due until midday Thursday, however, lt
remained unclear whether the main opposition Fianna Fail party,
under its controversial leader Charles Haughey, would win
enough seats for an outright majority in the 166-member Parlia
ment, or would have to seek additional support from one of several
minority groups.
Significant counts from all 41 of the country's electoral districts
gave Haughey's Fianna Fail 44.1 percent of the vote, closc to the
46 percent it had estimated would be needed for an 84-seat
majority. The party entered the election with 71 seats.
Near midnight last night, several commentators predicted that
Fianna Fail would fall short with no more than 82 seats.
Fine Gael, which has governed since November 1982 in coali
tion with the small Labor Party, appeared certain to lose at least
10 of its current 68 seats.
Battle goes on in West Beirut
BEIRUT, Lebanon — Tank and artillery battles thundered
across West Beirut last night after futile day-long efforts by Syria
to halt fierce combat between leftist Lebanese forces and the
Shilte Amal movement.
Hospitals reported that at least 70 people have been killed and
more than 170 wounded in the three days of fighting as Amal
militiamen sought desperately to keep key strongholds in the sec
tor of the capital that they have dominated for three years.
Factional control of the Moslem half of the capital and the pres
ence of Palestinian military forces appear to be the chief issues in
the fighting, viewed as the worst here since 1984, when the
Shiites drove the Lebanese army out of West Beirut. Also at stake
are rival efforts by Syria and Iran to exercise control, along with an
apparent effort by the leftist forces to expand Soviet influence in
the war-torn country.
A warning by Syria's military intelligence chief here. Brig. Ghazi
Kanaan, to call in more troops from Damascus if peace is not
restored within 24 hours was ignored as Druze and Lebanese
Communist Party militiamen sought to advance on elements of
the Shlite Amal movement.
Amal. meanwhile, partially lifted its four-month-long siege of
the Burj al Barajinah Palestinian refugee camp in southern
Beirut, allowing 300 women to leave, stock up on provisions and
medications and return.
Ratings tell all about *Amerika' )
NEW YORK — It was beauty vs. bad times on television Tuesday
night, and when the national ratings became available yesterday,
they showed that a beauty pageant beat ABC's grim "Amerlka" In
head-to-head competition.
CBS says that A.C. Nielsen Co. figures for the time slot when the
two shows were directly competing against each other, CBS' Miss
USA Pageant got a 22.7 rating. ABC's "Amerlka" a 17.7, and a two
hour "Remington Steele" episode on NBC a 15.5.

remained unclear whether the main opposition Fianna Fail party,
under its controversial leader Charles Haughey, would win
enough seats for an outright majority in the 166-member Parlia
ment, or would have to seek additional support from one of several
minority groups.
Significant counts from all 41 of the country's electoral districts
gave Haughey's Fianna Fail 44.1 percent of the vote, closc to the
46 percent it had estimated would be needed for an 84-seat
majority. The party entered the election with 71 seats.
Near midnight last night, several commentators predicted that
Fianna Fail would fall short with no more than 82 seats.
Fine Gael, which has governed since November 1982 in coali
tion with the small Labor Party, appeared certain to lose at least
10 of its current 68 seats.
Battle goes on in West Beirut
BEIRUT, Lebanon — Tank and artillery battles thundered
across West Beirut last night after futile day-long efforts by Syria
to halt fierce combat between leftist Lebanese forces and the
Shilte Amal movement.
Hospitals reported that at least 70 people have been killed and
more than 170 wounded in the three days of fighting as Amal
militiamen sought desperately to keep key strongholds in the sec
tor of the capital that they have dominated for three years.
Factional control of the Moslem half of the capital and the pres
ence of Palestinian military forces appear to be the chief issues in
the fighting, viewed as the worst here since 1984, when the
Shiites drove the Lebanese army out of West Beirut. Also at stake
are rival efforts by Syria and Iran to exercise control, along with an
apparent effort by the leftist forces to expand Soviet influence in
the war-torn country.
A warning by Syria's military intelligence chief here. Brig. Ghazi
Kanaan, to call in more troops from Damascus if peace is not
restored within 24 hours was ignored as Druze and Lebanese
Communist Party militiamen sought to advance on elements of
the Shlite Amal movement.
Amal. meanwhile, partially lifted its four-month-long siege of
the Burj al Barajinah Palestinian refugee camp in southern
Beirut, allowing 300 women to leave, stock up on provisions and
medications and return.
Ratings tell all about *Amerika' )
NEW YORK — It was beauty vs. bad times on television Tuesday
night, and when the national ratings became available yesterday,
they showed that a beauty pageant beat ABC's grim "Amerlka" In
head-to-head competition.
CBS says that A.C. Nielsen Co. figures for the time slot when the
two shows were directly competing against each other, CBS' Miss
USA Pageant got a 22.7 rating. ABC's "Amerlka" a 17.7, and a two
hour "Remington Steele" episode on NBC a 15.5.

Regan's decision: Quit or stay
WASHINGTON — President Reagan declared yesterday that he
won't fire his embattled chief of staff, Donald Regan, but added
that he wouldn't stand In the way If Regan decides to quit.
Asked by reporters whether Regan would stay on as chief of
staff, the president paused for a moment and said, "This is up to
him." Speaking deliberately, he then added a formulation he has
often used when an official was expected to resign.
"I have always said that when the people that I've asked to come
into government feel that they have to return to private life, that's
their business and I will never try to talk them out of It," Reagan
said, responding to reporters' questions at an Oval Office picture
taking ceremony for the first time in nearly three months.
Regan, standing behind the president and Israel Prime Minister
Yitzhak Shamir, appeared startled by the exchange. But he had
recovered his composure when he strolled smilingly along a
colonnade with the president after the Shamir meeting.
Reporters shouted questions, asking the president if Regan
were leaving. "No," Reagan replied. They then put the same ques
tion to Regan, who looked at the president and said, "It's up to
him."
Parties to sponsor 1988 debates
WASHINGTON — The Republican and Democratic parties will
Jointly sponsor 1988 presidential debates, the parties' chairmen
announced yesterday, dismaying the League of Women Voters,
which has run the debates since 1976.
Democratic National Chairman Paul Kirk Jr. and Republican
National Chairman Frank Fahrenkopf Jr. said that the parties
had decided to form a bipartisan, non-profit commission to con
duct the nationally televised forums so that they can play a greater
role In that crucial aspect of the presidential campaign.
Representatives of the league, meanwhile, charged that party
sponsored debates would inevitably give short shrift to third-party
candidates and would amount to no more than a "political pillow
fight."
"I think they're trying to steal the debate from the American
voter, not the League of Women Voters." said league President
Nancy Neuman, who declared that her organization would
proceed with plans for three 1988 presidential debates and one
vice-presidential debate. She said that she was confident the can
didates will cooperate.
At the heart of the dispute is a desire by the parties to assert
control over the organization and format of the debates, which
can have more voter impact than any other single candidate ap
pearances during the latter stages of the campaign. The league,
however, seems determined to retain the high profile role that has
lent it considerable prestige over the last 10 years.
Park service to establish fees
WASHINGTON — If a ticket booth for tourists appears at Ford's
Theater, can a fee for visitors to the Washington Monument be far
behind?
Nope. The National Park Service already has drawn up plans to
add Washington's trademark obelisk, along with St. Louis'
Gateway Arch and Abraham Lincoln's home In Springfield, 111., to
the list of pay-as-you-go national parks and memorials if an ex
perimental program under way this year gets permanent approval
from Congress.
Seventy-two federal parks and monuments that used to be free
for the looking will be charging entrance fees this year, from the
Statue of Liberty In New York Harbor to the Montana battlefield
where Lt. Col. George Custer fought his last stand.
At 62 other sites, prices are going up for the first time In 15
years. It will cost *5 a carload, instead of *2, to leaf-peep along the
Skyline Drive in Shenandoah National Park or to peer into the
maw of the Grand Canyon.
The experiment marks at least a partial victory for the adminis
tration in its six-year battle to increase the gate at national parks.
The Interior Department has trotted out the proposal at budget
time every year since 1981 as part of a general strategy of "user
fees" aimed at making government programs more self
supporting, and every year the enthusiasm was wan.
Opposition wins in Irish voting
DUBLIN, Ireland — Ireland headed toward a change in govern

FitzGerald's Fine Gael party.
