WASHINGTON - Acting CIA Di
rector Robert Gates was accused
yesterday by members of the Sen
ate Intelligence Committee of
having helped his predecessor,
William Casey, to mislead
Congress last November about the
full extent of his agency's involve
ment in the Iran-contra affair.
Gates, testifying in confirma
tion hearings on his nomination
to head the CIA, insisted that
Casey's statement before the com
mittee last Nov. 21 "was a fair
statement of what we knew at the
time." even though some impor
tant facts were omitted.
"It was not an effort to mislead
or misguide the committee."
Gates said.
Among other things, Casey had
failed to tell the committee that
the CIA assisted a covert shipment
of U.S. arms to Iran a year earlier
without receiving a written

"finding," or directive, from the
president, as required by law. He
also did not mention that he had
reason to suspect that profits
from the arms sales had been
diverted to the Nlcaraguan rebels
— a development that was not
publicly disclosed by the adminis
tration until four days later.
The Senate Intelligence Com
mittee, which is empowered by
law to oversee activities of the CIA,
summoned Casey to testify last
Nov. 21 shortly after learning that
President Reagan had sold arms
to Iran without notifying
Congress. It was the first of many
such hearings that Congress has
since held on the matter.
The committee is expected to
confirm Gates' nomination later
this month, even though he drew
considerable criticism from mem
bers of both parties. The panel
was so tough on him, in fact, that

he was overheard mumbling "take
this job and shove it" into what he
apparently thought was a dead
microphone. He later dismissed
his remark as a joke.
Gates, appearing for the second
straight day, also disclosed that
the CIA had made a profit of
♦300,000 on the U.S. arms sales
to Iran. He said the money, which
remains in an agency bank ac
count where it was deposited by
the Iranians, belongs to the U.S.
Treasury.
Sen. Arlen Specter, R-Pa., who
described Casey's November tes
timony as "skimpy, scanty, uni
nformative and really misleading,"
accused Gates of "dissembling"
about his own role in drafting the
testimony. "You are trying to dis
tance yourself from that tes
timony." he said.
Although Gates acknowledged
that, as Casey's deputy, he was in

volved at several points in the
preparation of the Nov. 21 tes
timony, he insisted that he was
not responsible for its content. He
said he read several drafts and In
structed those who were prepar
ing It to Include "all the facts that
we knew."
But he added that CIA officials
were still scrambling to learn the
facts of the case when Casey ap
peared before the committee.
Gates, a career CIA employee
who has been acting director
since Feb. 2 when Casey resigned
after undergoing surgery for a
brain tumor, also argued that the
director had been under no obliga
tion to tell the committee that the
agency had aided in an arms ship
ment to Iran in November 1985,
before receiving a formal "finding"
signed by the president on Jan.
17.
