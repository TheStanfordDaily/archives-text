# Hoover head censured for statement
## 
### JOHN POLLACK Senior staff writer 
The Reagan Library once again became the main
focus of debate in the Faculty Senate yesterday as the
senate approved a motion to censure the director of
the Hoover Institution for his recent partisan com
ments and explored ways of resolving land-use con
flicts between the University, faculty and the com
munity.
The senate adopted a resolution censuring Hoover
Director W. Glenn Campbell for his recent comment
that Stanford can "boast" of a "Reagan connection"
because of the location of the Reagan Library on
campus. Campbell's remarks, which appeared in the
1986 Hoover Annual Report, "run counter to the
non-partisan rationale offered by the Board of Trus
tees for siting the Reagan Presidential Library on
this campus," the resolution stated. A stronger
resolution proposed by English Prof. Ronald Rebholz
was tabled.
Debate over the library shifted its focus when Act
ing University President James Rosse initiated dis
cussion on University governance, the myriad of bu
reaucratic stuctures through which the University,
faculty and the community resolve conflicts over is
sues such as land use.
"The University is a complex organization, and it is
not always easy to figure out how wd make deci
sions," Rosse said, noting that policy decisions are
currently made by many different bodies including
the trustees, the Faculty Senate and advisory bodies
appointed by the University president.
Choosing the Reagan Library as a case study of
University governance, Rosse traced the decision
making process behind Stanford's acceptance of the
library and its subsequent siting.
While defending the decision-making process that
has occurred, Rosse acknowledged that the commu
nity's lack of authority in the debate was a problem.
"Residents on campus do not have a direct role in the
(University's) decision-making process," he said.
A coalition of three community groups has
opposed the library, arguing that the building will
spoil the undeveloped foothills west of campus and
bring too much traffic to the area.
Political Science Prof. David Abernethy criticized
the lack of citizen participation In University
decision-making. He also questioned the makeup of
the Ronald Reagan Library Planning Committee.
which was appointed by Univer
sity President Donald Kennedy In
1984.
"The residents and home
owners, it is true, were heard. . . .
They wanted to be. but were not
represented formally on the com
mittee," Abernethy said.
Abernethy pointed out that
since he was the only faculty mem
ber on the Reagan Library com
mittee, the body's makeup was in
congruous with the purported
academic purpose of the library.
"Since the rationale for the li

brary on campus is academic ... I
think one person from the faculty
represents a small sample" of fac
ulty opinion, Abernethy said. The
committee had nine members.
Rebholz agreed with Abernethy.
"It is quite clear that the Academic
Council had little impact" or role
in the acceptance and siting of the
library, Rebholz said.
English Prof. Herbert Lin
denberger voiced the same
opinion. He said the faculty felt
"left out" of the decision-making
process behind the library, saying
that alternative siting plans for
the library were not honestly pre
sented.
Rosse responded that he was
"convinced that all reasonable al

ternatives" had been considered.
To ensure Academic Council
representation in the future use of
the library's facilities, the senate
passed a motion directing the Uni
versity Administration to take
"prompt measures" to establish a
mechanism by which to achieve
representation of the faculty.
In light of mounting concern
over the building's scale and the
amount of conference and exhibit
space, as well as a controversial
second story, the senate also
passed a resolution requiring that
the architectural plans for the li
brary be presented to the senate
"in the near future."
Although adopted, this resolu
tion was not passed without

debate. It was pointed out that the
Faculty Senate will have no au
thority to order the architect to
redraw the plans if they are un
satisfactory.
But Rosse said the Board of
Trustees, which has that author
ity, is "sympathetic" to the views
of the senate.
On another subject. Rosse
criticized a letter from Secretaiy of
Education William Bennett enti
tled "Our Greedy Colleges" that
appeared in The New York Times
Wednesday. In the letter, Bennett
accused the nation's universities
of relying on "generous federal
loans" to compensate for their
lack of "self-restraint" in raising
tuition.

because of the location of the Reagan Library on
campus. Campbell's remarks, which appeared in the
1986 Hoover Annual Report, "run counter to the
non-partisan rationale offered by the Board of Trus
tees for siting the Reagan Presidential Library on
this campus," the resolution stated. A stronger
resolution proposed by English Prof. Ronald Rebholz
was tabled.
Debate over the library shifted its focus when Act
ing University President James Rosse initiated dis
cussion on University governance, the myriad of bu
reaucratic stuctures through which the University,
faculty and the community resolve conflicts over is
sues such as land use.
"The University is a complex organization, and it is
not always easy to figure out how wd make deci
sions," Rosse said, noting that policy decisions are
currently made by many different bodies including
the trustees, the Faculty Senate and advisory bodies
appointed by the University president.
Choosing the Reagan Library as a case study of
University governance, Rosse traced the decision
making process behind Stanford's acceptance of the
library and its subsequent siting.
While defending the decision-making process that
has occurred, Rosse acknowledged that the commu
nity's lack of authority in the debate was a problem.
"Residents on campus do not have a direct role in the
(University's) decision-making process," he said.
A coalition of three community groups has
opposed the library, arguing that the building will
spoil the undeveloped foothills west of campus and
bring too much traffic to the area.
Political Science Prof. David Abernethy criticized
the lack of citizen participation In University
decision-making. He also questioned the makeup of
the Ronald Reagan Library Planning Committee.
which was appointed by Univer
sity President Donald Kennedy In
1984.
"The residents and home
owners, it is true, were heard. . . .
They wanted to be. but were not
represented formally on the com
mittee," Abernethy said.
Abernethy pointed out that
since he was the only faculty mem
ber on the Reagan Library com
mittee, the body's makeup was in
congruous with the purported
academic purpose of the library.
"Since the rationale for the li

brary on campus is academic ... I
think one person from the faculty
represents a small sample" of fac
ulty opinion, Abernethy said. The
committee had nine members.
Rebholz agreed with Abernethy.
"It is quite clear that the Academic
Council had little impact" or role
in the acceptance and siting of the
library, Rebholz said.
English Prof. Herbert Lin
denberger voiced the same
opinion. He said the faculty felt
"left out" of the decision-making
process behind the library, saying
that alternative siting plans for
the library were not honestly pre
sented.
Rosse responded that he was
"convinced that all reasonable al

ternatives" had been considered.
To ensure Academic Council
representation in the future use of
the library's facilities, the senate
passed a motion directing the Uni
versity Administration to take
"prompt measures" to establish a
mechanism by which to achieve
representation of the faculty.
In light of mounting concern
over the building's scale and the
amount of conference and exhibit
space, as well as a controversial
second story, the senate also
passed a resolution requiring that
the architectural plans for the li
brary be presented to the senate
"in the near future."
Although adopted, this resolu
tion was not passed without

debate. It was pointed out that the
Faculty Senate will have no au
thority to order the architect to
redraw the plans if they are un
satisfactory.
But Rosse said the Board of
Trustees, which has that author
ity, is "sympathetic" to the views
of the senate.
On another subject. Rosse
criticized a letter from Secretaiy of
Education William Bennett enti
tled "Our Greedy Colleges" that
appeared in The New York Times
Wednesday. In the letter, Bennett
accused the nation's universities
of relying on "generous federal
loans" to compensate for their
lack of "self-restraint" in raising
tuition.
