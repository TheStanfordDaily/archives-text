The Reagan Library once again became the main
focus of debate in the Faculty Senate yesterday as the
senate approved a motion to censure the director of
the Hoover Institution for his recent partisan com
ments and explored ways of resolving land-use con
flicts between the University, faculty and the com
munity.
The senate adopted a resolution censuring Hoover
Director W. Glenn Campbell for his recent comment
that Stanford can "boast" of a "Reagan connection"
because of the location of the Reagan Library on
campus. Campbell's remarks, which appeared in the
1986 Hoover Annual Report, "run counter to the
non-partisan rationale offered by the Board of Trus
tees for siting the Reagan Presidential Library on
this campus," the resolution stated. A stronger
resolution proposed by English Prof. Ronald Rebholz
was tabled.
Debate over the library shifted its focus when Act
ing University President James Rosse initiated dis
cussion on University governance, the myriad of bu
reaucratic stuctures through which the University,
faculty and the community resolve conflicts over is
sues such as land use.
"The University is a complex organization, and it is
not always easy to figure out how wd make deci
sions," Rosse said, noting that policy decisions are
currently made by many different bodies including
the trustees, the Faculty Senate and advisory bodies
appointed by the University president.
Choosing the Reagan Library as a case study of
University governance, Rosse traced the decision
making process behind Stanford's acceptance of the
library and its subsequent siting.
While defending the decision-making process that
has occurred, Rosse acknowledged that the commu
nity's lack of authority in the debate was a problem.
"Residents on campus do not have a direct role in the
(University's) decision-making process," he said.
A coalition of three community groups has
opposed the library, arguing that the building will
spoil the undeveloped foothills west of campus and
bring too much traffic to the area.
Political Science Prof. David Abernethy criticized
the lack of citizen participation In University
decision-making. He also questioned the makeup of
the Ronald Reagan Library Planning Committee.
