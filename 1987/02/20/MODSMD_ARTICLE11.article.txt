# Art thefts force closing of show
## 
### FRANK QUARATIELLO Staff writer 
Two recent art thefts from the
Cummings Art Building have
forced a show there to close, ac
cording to Art Prof. Matthew
Kahn.
A large, unframed silkscreen
print was stolen from a public dis
play inside the Cummings build
ing last Tuesday night or Wednes
day morning. A second piece was
pulled halfway off the wall, but not
stolen, according to Kahn.
"No more textiles of this sort will
be hung in the space (in the hal
lway surrounding Annenberg
Auditorium)," said Kahn.
This was the second art theft
from the show in two weeks. Two
similar silkscreen prints were
taken in the first theft, which oc
curred three weeks ago.
After the second theft, Kahn
said, he authorized that the show
be taken down. The show had
been set up by a fall quarter pat
tern design class that Kahn had
taught.
"The long pieces (in the show)
were removed entirely because

students didn't care to risk fur
ther loss." said Kahn.
The smaller pieces of the two
part show are still on display in
locked glass cabinets outside of
Annenburg Auditorium.
Kahn said he is skeptical about
the future of art shows.
"There have been no art faculty
meetings yet (to discuss the
thefts), but my own inclination is
not to have future shows," said
Kahn.
Other art professors and their
students will have to decide
whether or not it is safe to display
their artwork, according to Kahn.
It may be safer for painting and
sculpture classes to display their
work, because they cannot be con
cealed as easily as textiles, Kahn
said.
"I won't use the space for a show
of work of this type again," Kahn
said.
Kahn said he does not feel that
the thefts reflect a negative atti
tude toward art at Stanford.
"In a bizarre and twisted way.
art theft is the highest form of art
appreciation, but it's still very
wrong," Kahn said.
