The observance of National Condom Week
here and at campuses across the country has
highlighted the importance of safe and re
sponsible sexual behavior.
Awareness about contraception, however,
is essential at all levels. In particular, contra
ceptive education should be part of the
schooling of all junior and senior high school
students.
A recent Harris poll of U.S. teenagers
revealed that more than half have sex by the
time they are 17. Of those, only one-third use
contraceptives consistently.
Last year, more than one million teenage
girls became pregnant — giving the United
States the highest teen pregnancy rate in the
Western world. More than half of all teenage
mothers are unmarried. Typically they come
from low-income households, and many drop
out of school to have their babies. Few have
access to adequate prenatal care or nutrition
information.
Today, sexually active teenagers face an
even more potentially devastating threat —
AIDS. Many public health experts worry that

teenagers will be the next high-risk group for
the disease.
The stakes are too high for the United
States to stand by and intone prudishly that
youngsters should 'just say no' to sex. Such
moralistic concerns are now largely moot;
American teenagers are already sexually ac
tive.
Few people would disagree that sex educa
tion should start at home. However, most
parents are too uncomfortable with the sub
ject to discuss it. The Harris poll showed that
64 percent of teenagers had never talked
about sex with their parents. If students
aren't learning about contraception at home,
then it is up to the schools to educate them.
No study has ever borne out the notion —
prevalent among critics of sex education —
that giving students information about con
traception and sex encourages them to be
promiscuous. On the contrary, classes and
school-based clinics have proven effective in
delaying sex and reducing pregnancy rates.
Sexual responsibility is important for
everyone, especially teenagers. We owe it to
them to give them all the information.
