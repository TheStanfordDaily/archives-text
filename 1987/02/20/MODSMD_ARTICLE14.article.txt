# Oxford's a big letdown
## 
### 
Have you ever been disappointed by something
that was supposed to be wonderful? I have. That is
what happened to several of us at Stanford-in-Oxford
this past fall quarter. I had heard so many good
things about it that I decided to go. 1 am back on the
Farm this quarter because the "Oxford Experience"
is not all that it is cracked up to be.

There certainly are wonderful things to be said
about Oxford University. I do not mention them here
because I know that they are propounded all over
campus. It is the negative side of the Stanford pro
gram that has somehow been overlooked. I think
that it is because the people that come back from
this overseas center with a negative impression will
not show up at information meetings or let their
opinions be known. We are told: "Oxford is wonder
ful. If you don't like it. it's probably because you
didn't try hard enough."
Those of us who did not like it feel somewhat guilty
since this program attracts many more applicants
than it can admit. Perhaps our being In Oxford took
away from someone else who would have loved it. I
know now that I am not the only one that did not love
my time spent abroad. Anyone from Stanford that is
thinking about going to Oxford should know about
this center's problems before you arrive.
First of all, Stanford-in-Oxford is a world unto it
self. All of the Stanford students must live in the
equivalent of a Row or fraternity house. The Stanford
students become a close-knit group because they are
forced to live together and because the administra
tion there is so bad. The director. Geoffrey Tyack, is
simply not a good leader for an overseas study pro
gram. He did try to meet everyone on the first day,
but he did not come to any house meetings that he
himself did not call, and he was horribly ineffective
in dealing with the problems that arose throughout
the quarter. Stanford should replace Tyack.
Students planning to go abroad should know that
the classes they take at the Stanford program in Ox
ford, with only minor exceptions, will be filled exclu
sively with Stanford students. The minor exception
last quarter was an English program that was offered
through St. Catherine's College. It probably was a
wonderful class, but only five Stanfordites were
allowed in. But many more than five went to Oxford
with the expressed intention of taking this course.
You can imagine the disappointment of those who
were 6,000 miles from Stanford and could not get the
class they wanted. They were forced back into regu
lar Stanford-in-Oxford classes where one sits with

other Stanford kids in a Stanford overseas study
classroom. Most quarters, students can take classes
with a regular Stanford professor too. How great! So
when does the international experience come in?
The famous and overrated Bodelian Library prob
ably does have every book that one could need for Ox
ford academic work. The problem is that it will take
at least overnight for the library staff to find any book
you need on their closed shelves because they stop
searching for books at 4:30 p.m. on weekdays. Stan
ford students are not allowed in until 5 p.m. And
only about half of last quarter's students were lucky
enough to get permission at all. There are other li
braries. but most either restrict or prohibit Stanford
students from using them. The Stanford-in-Oxford
library is small but good. Unfortunately, it has only
about one-third the number of study desks that are
needed.
If you are planning to go to Oxford, you should
know that Oxford University is made up of distinct
colleges that supposedly allow Stanford students to
partake in residential education the English way.
The problem was that after receiving a photocopy
with my name scribbled at the top explaining all the
great things I could do at Magdalen College, I was
promptly turned away from using its IBM PCs, its
squash courts (that was later taken care of) and its li
brary. Other people did join college sports teams, but
I was stuck with just eating at the college. To be
honest, the food was not good, either. So much for a
good residential set-up.
I believe Oxford is one of the great learning centers
of the world. At first I was excited to be a part of it.
Then I saw reality. I was frustrated at being an out
sider looking in and I became disgusted.
I understand that Stanford "ruffled a few feathers"
when it decided to establish an Oxford campus by
charging in with considerable haste. I have also
learned that Stanford offended important people at
Oxford when it applied to get library privileges for us.
Maybe we did not make a perfect entry, but we
should have worked out our problems by now.
In light of Stanford's desire to save money by shut
ting down overseas campuses in Western Europe, I
propose that Stanford promptly shut down its pro
gram in Oxford. We should not put up with the City
of Oxford's stipulation that we allow only 51 students
a quarter to study at our center. We should not waste
our time, money and resources trying to fight an ar
chaic and decaying system that does not care
whether we stay or go. There are plenty of wonderful
exchange programs for students in England. By
closing ours, no Stanford student should suffer.
Let's divorce ourselves from Oxford.

self. All of the Stanford students must live in the
equivalent of a Row or fraternity house. The Stanford
students become a close-knit group because they are
forced to live together and because the administra
tion there is so bad. The director. Geoffrey Tyack, is
simply not a good leader for an overseas study pro
gram. He did try to meet everyone on the first day,
but he did not come to any house meetings that he
himself did not call, and he was horribly ineffective
in dealing with the problems that arose throughout
the quarter. Stanford should replace Tyack.
Students planning to go abroad should know that
the classes they take at the Stanford program in Ox
ford, with only minor exceptions, will be filled exclu
sively with Stanford students. The minor exception
last quarter was an English program that was offered
through St. Catherine's College. It probably was a
wonderful class, but only five Stanfordites were
allowed in. But many more than five went to Oxford
with the expressed intention of taking this course.
You can imagine the disappointment of those who
were 6,000 miles from Stanford and could not get the
class they wanted. They were forced back into regu
lar Stanford-in-Oxford classes where one sits with

other Stanford kids in a Stanford overseas study
classroom. Most quarters, students can take classes
with a regular Stanford professor too. How great! So
when does the international experience come in?
The famous and overrated Bodelian Library prob
ably does have every book that one could need for Ox
ford academic work. The problem is that it will take
at least overnight for the library staff to find any book
you need on their closed shelves because they stop
searching for books at 4:30 p.m. on weekdays. Stan
ford students are not allowed in until 5 p.m. And
only about half of last quarter's students were lucky
enough to get permission at all. There are other li
braries. but most either restrict or prohibit Stanford
students from using them. The Stanford-in-Oxford
library is small but good. Unfortunately, it has only
about one-third the number of study desks that are
needed.
If you are planning to go to Oxford, you should
know that Oxford University is made up of distinct
colleges that supposedly allow Stanford students to
partake in residential education the English way.
The problem was that after receiving a photocopy
with my name scribbled at the top explaining all the
great things I could do at Magdalen College, I was
promptly turned away from using its IBM PCs, its
squash courts (that was later taken care of) and its li
brary. Other people did join college sports teams, but
I was stuck with just eating at the college. To be
honest, the food was not good, either. So much for a
good residential set-up.
I believe Oxford is one of the great learning centers
of the world. At first I was excited to be a part of it.
Then I saw reality. I was frustrated at being an out
sider looking in and I became disgusted.
I understand that Stanford "ruffled a few feathers"
when it decided to establish an Oxford campus by
charging in with considerable haste. I have also
learned that Stanford offended important people at
Oxford when it applied to get library privileges for us.
Maybe we did not make a perfect entry, but we
should have worked out our problems by now.
In light of Stanford's desire to save money by shut
ting down overseas campuses in Western Europe, I
propose that Stanford promptly shut down its pro
gram in Oxford. We should not put up with the City
of Oxford's stipulation that we allow only 51 students
a quarter to study at our center. We should not waste
our time, money and resources trying to fight an ar
chaic and decaying system that does not care
whether we stay or go. There are plenty of wonderful
exchange programs for students in England. By
closing ours, no Stanford student should suffer.
Let's divorce ourselves from Oxford.

Have you ever been disappointed by something
that was supposed to be wonderful? I have. That is
what happened to several of us at Stanford-in-Oxford
this past fall quarter. I had heard so many good
things about it that I decided to go. 1 am back on the
Farm this quarter because the "Oxford Experience"
is not all that it is cracked up to be.

There certainly are wonderful things to be said
about Oxford University. I do not mention them here
because I know that they are propounded all over
campus. It is the negative side of the Stanford pro
gram that has somehow been overlooked. I think
that it is because the people that come back from
this overseas center with a negative impression will
not show up at information meetings or let their
opinions be known. We are told: "Oxford is wonder
ful. If you don't like it. it's probably because you
didn't try hard enough."
Those of us who did not like it feel somewhat guilty
since this program attracts many more applicants
than it can admit. Perhaps our being In Oxford took
away from someone else who would have loved it. I
know now that I am not the only one that did not love
my time spent abroad. Anyone from Stanford that is
thinking about going to Oxford should know about
this center's problems before you arrive.
