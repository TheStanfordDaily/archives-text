# It's not a library, it's a shrine

### 
Library or shrine? It appears that University
planners are unable or unwilling to make the
Reagan Library proposal clear on this crucial
point. Upon this hinges the character of Uni
versity/Reagan Library relationships, the size
of the traffic problems created on Junipero
Serra Blvd. and the impact of the intrusion
into Stanford's foothills.
Just how attractive are the shrines? This
depends on a number of factors: the popularity
and duration of the presidency memorialized;
the size and density of the population living
nearby: the amount of tourist traffic on nearby
highways (where signs arc inevitably placed
which attract visitors); the programs the
shrine conducts for school children, political
groups and other organizations; and the
length of time since the opening of the library.
But whatever the combination of the above,
the ratio of shrine visitors to archive users is
alwavs well above 100 to one.

Another aspect of the shrine pattern worth
noting is that the tourist-oriented displays
have great problems with objectivity. Accord
ing to a Duke University study, the Kennedy
Library display avoids mention of the Bay of
Pigs debacle and the Johnson Library rather
miraculously forgets to mention the Vietnam
War.
Clearly Stanford's new library will be a major
attraction, given Reagan's popularity. Its loca
tion in the fourth largest metropolitan area in
the country, the tourist traffic on Routes 280
and 101. and the freshness of the presidency

memorialized. The Kennedy Library in its early
years attracted more than 400,000 visitors a
year. The average for the Johnson Library in
Austin, Texas was over 600,000 during its first
seven years. Last year even the Truman Li
brary, in a small Missouri town, attracted
176,000 visitors.
University planners and Mr. Charles Palm,
the head librarian of the Hoover Institution ar
chives who serves as a spokesman for the
Reagan Library supporters, claim that the li
brary has a primarily educational function and
that its impact on the foothills, local roads and
campus will be minimal. The plans they have
put forward, however, are at best contradictory
and vague on the crucial issue of whether this
library will, in fact, be designed and aimed to
attract non-academic visitors.
Mr. Palm estimates that there will be
200,000 to 300,000 visitors a year. This con
stitutes a modest shrine, but why has he put
the figure so low when a less popular president
(Johnson), in a less populated and well
traveled part of the country (Austin. Texas),
has regularly attracted twice the numbers?
Mr. Palm cites display floor space as his rea
son. arguing that a smaller exhibit will draw
fewer people. Yet few tourists actually make
visits because of the size of the display, and
10.500 square feet is surely a large enough
area, coupled with films and video clips, to
please most visitors. It is certainly fair to
assume that the library's board and staff will
be oriented to the visitors much more than to
the archive users.
The plans are contradictory. For instance, a
parking lot for 350 cars indicates an expecta
tion of large volume. The Ford Library at the
University of Michigan, which Is separated

from the Ford Museum (in Grand Rapids), and
is thus the only true archive library in the sys
tem, has a parking lot for only 40 cars, which
is deemed quite adequate.
The Ford archives are closed on weekends,
but are open from 8:30 p.m. to 4:30 p.m. on
weekdays to accommodate scholarly activity.
The Reagan Library planners assure us that
this library will be open only between 10 p.m.
and 4 p.m. Why? To avoid peak traffic times on
Junipero Serra. Again, it seems the plans
point to a shrine.

The plans put forward
are at best contradictory.

Finally, the auditorium (350 seats) and large
meeting room (120 seats) appear useful
primarily for shrlne-type activities. The
Johnson Library now averages three large
evening events a week (mostly banquets).
These are not scholarly gatherings. What is to
prevent the same pattern from happening at
Stanford?
If It is to be academic in its essential nature,
as county zoning requires, then let the plan
ners. the Board of Trustees and the University
present a credible scheme. This should include
restricting Its shrine characteristics and put
ting the "library" squarely under the control of
the University. Not to do so forthrightly at this
stage is to create a problem of extraordinary di
mensions for Stanford, now and In the future.
