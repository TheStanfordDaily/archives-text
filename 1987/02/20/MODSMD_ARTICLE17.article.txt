# Stanford and Stamford
## 
### 
The University has been getting a lot of media at
tention lately, what with the Centennial and all. This
is a good thing. Stanford is a nice place, and one way
people will discover that is through the press and
television. Of course, "Stanford" isn't exactly a
household word quite yet; I'm sure more than a few
journalists bought round-trip airline tickets to a
small town in Connecticut when they heard we were
having a 100 th birthday party.
We always get confused with that small town in
Connecticut. Practically the entire eastern seaboard
thinks we're a bedroom community of Manhattan
commuters. Historically, The New York Times has
been the worst offender; when the University set new
records for collegiate fund raising in the late '70s,
The Times buried it on an inside page with a
headline about how "Stamford" was getting richer.
The Times ran a story about us last week, too. They
spelled our name right, but the article contained a
slew of other mistakes. And they put it on page 12.

People in Boston — where I'm from — are ignorant
about Stanford, too. When I first told people I was
planning to attend Stanford, most everybody
thought I had made a good choice.
"Oh, Connecticut's a nice state," they'd say. "And
you'll be so close to New York City."
A few were more worried. "Will you be lonely so far
away from home?" they'd ask.
Eventually, I got used to all of it. Sometimes I'd
even reassure everyone that it was only Connecticut,
just one state over, and that I'd be home for Thanks
giving. Maybe even before that.
"Well, that's good," they'd say. "At least you won't
be halfway across the country, like your brother."
Well, I'm getting sick and tired of all this confusion
between us and them. It's needless. The difference
between Stanford and Stamford is a lot more than a
letter of the alphabet. Stamford Is a nifty little city,
and Stanford is a large university. Anybody with half
a brain can see that we're different.
Stamford is older than Stanford. The city was
founded in 1640 by settlers from nearby Hartford.
Railroads — when you get right down to it, we owe
our existence to those steel tracks — weren't even in
vented then. Stamford is also home to about a dozen
Fortune 500 companies. As far as I can tell, we don't
have any, unless you count the Bechtel International
Center or figure in Hewlett and Packard somehow.
Stamford is much bigger than Stanford, too; it has a
population of about 107,000. In all, it seems like a
pretty happening place — its nickname is "The
Gateway to New England."

Stamford has its problems, though. "There aren't
a heckuva lot of tourist attractions here," said Joe
Ercolano, the vice president of regional economic is
sues for the Southwestern Connecticut Area Com
merce and Industry Association. "People don't come
trekking in from California to visit." At least we get
visitors from Connecticut.
According to Ercolano, who has one of the longest
titles I've ever seen, things are swell in Stamford.
"Stamford is one of the most successful urban
renewal centers in the country," he said, noting that
there are a lot of big corporations with headquarters
in Stamford. They like to brag about that. "We have
over 12 million square feet of office space here, with
another three or four million either under construc
tion or planned," Ercolano said. In fact, Stamford
has so many R&D facilities within its limits that Er
colano said it is gaining a new nickname: Research
City.
Stamford. The third-most-popular home of corpor
ate headquarters on the East Coast. The Gateway to
New England. Research City. You wouldn't think
people would confuse us — but they do. Paul Pacter,
the city's finance commissioner, said Stamford is al
ways getting mixed up with Stanford. "Nationwide,
you guys are probably better known," he noted.
Obviously, something needs to be done here.
Stamford is Stamford, and Stanford is Stanford. We
both need to work together to reinforce this. Donald
Kennedy and the mayor of Stamford — he's a hard
guy to get a hold of, I tried — should get together and
make some sort of agreement.

The difference between
Stanford and Stamford is
a lot more than a letter of
the alphabet.

We could start by sending maps out to every news
paper and television station in the country. Every
time we send any kind of press release out, we should
make it clear that we're Stanford, not Stamford. We
could also attach a disclaimer to every piece of
literature that leaves campus, like they do with
works of fiction: "Any resemblance between the char
acters, places or events at Stanford University and
those in Stamford, Connecticut is purely coinciden
tal." That ought to let people know where we stand —
literally.
Of course, Stamford officials could help, too.
Maybe they could just lie low for awhile. We could cut
a deal. They keep quiet and send all inquiries to us,
and we give them the Reagan Library. I'm sure no
one in the White House would even notice.

records for collegiate fund raising in the late '70s,
The Times buried it on an inside page with a
headline about how "Stamford" was getting richer.
The Times ran a story about us last week, too. They
spelled our name right, but the article contained a
slew of other mistakes. And they put it on page 12.

People in Boston — where I'm from — are ignorant
about Stanford, too. When I first told people I was
planning to attend Stanford, most everybody
thought I had made a good choice.
"Oh, Connecticut's a nice state," they'd say. "And
you'll be so close to New York City."
A few were more worried. "Will you be lonely so far
away from home?" they'd ask.
Eventually, I got used to all of it. Sometimes I'd
even reassure everyone that it was only Connecticut,
just one state over, and that I'd be home for Thanks
giving. Maybe even before that.
"Well, that's good," they'd say. "At least you won't
be halfway across the country, like your brother."
Well, I'm getting sick and tired of all this confusion
between us and them. It's needless. The difference
between Stanford and Stamford is a lot more than a
letter of the alphabet. Stamford Is a nifty little city,
and Stanford is a large university. Anybody with half
a brain can see that we're different.
Stamford is older than Stanford. The city was
founded in 1640 by settlers from nearby Hartford.
Railroads — when you get right down to it, we owe
our existence to those steel tracks — weren't even in
vented then. Stamford is also home to about a dozen
Fortune 500 companies. As far as I can tell, we don't
have any, unless you count the Bechtel International
Center or figure in Hewlett and Packard somehow.
Stamford is much bigger than Stanford, too; it has a
population of about 107,000. In all, it seems like a
pretty happening place — its nickname is "The
Gateway to New England."

Stamford has its problems, though. "There aren't
a heckuva lot of tourist attractions here," said Joe
Ercolano, the vice president of regional economic is
sues for the Southwestern Connecticut Area Com
merce and Industry Association. "People don't come
trekking in from California to visit." At least we get
visitors from Connecticut.
According to Ercolano, who has one of the longest
titles I've ever seen, things are swell in Stamford.
"Stamford is one of the most successful urban
renewal centers in the country," he said, noting that
there are a lot of big corporations with headquarters
in Stamford. They like to brag about that. "We have
over 12 million square feet of office space here, with
another three or four million either under construc
tion or planned," Ercolano said. In fact, Stamford
has so many R&D facilities within its limits that Er
colano said it is gaining a new nickname: Research
City.
Stamford. The third-most-popular home of corpor
ate headquarters on the East Coast. The Gateway to
New England. Research City. You wouldn't think
people would confuse us — but they do. Paul Pacter,
the city's finance commissioner, said Stamford is al
ways getting mixed up with Stanford. "Nationwide,
you guys are probably better known," he noted.
Obviously, something needs to be done here.
Stamford is Stamford, and Stanford is Stanford. We
both need to work together to reinforce this. Donald
Kennedy and the mayor of Stamford — he's a hard
guy to get a hold of, I tried — should get together and
make some sort of agreement.

The difference between
Stanford and Stamford is
a lot more than a letter of
the alphabet.

We could start by sending maps out to every news
paper and television station in the country. Every
time we send any kind of press release out, we should
make it clear that we're Stanford, not Stamford. We
could also attach a disclaimer to every piece of
literature that leaves campus, like they do with
works of fiction: "Any resemblance between the char
acters, places or events at Stanford University and
those in Stamford, Connecticut is purely coinciden
tal." That ought to let people know where we stand —
literally.
Of course, Stamford officials could help, too.
Maybe they could just lie low for awhile. We could cut
a deal. They keep quiet and send all inquiries to us,
and we give them the Reagan Library. I'm sure no
one in the White House would even notice.

The University has been getting a lot of media at
tention lately, what with the Centennial and all. This
is a good thing. Stanford is a nice place, and one way
people will discover that is through the press and
television. Of course, "Stanford" isn't exactly a
household word quite yet; I'm sure more than a few
journalists bought round-trip airline tickets to a
small town in Connecticut when they heard we were
having a 100 th birthday party.
We always get confused with that small town in
Connecticut. Practically the entire eastern seaboard
thinks we're a bedroom community of Manhattan
commuters. Historically, The New York Times has
been the worst offender; when the University set new
records for collegiate fund raising in the late '70s,
The Times buried it on an inside page with a
