## Card looks to break Bears' jinx at Maples 
### SUSAN SLUSSER Editorial staff 
The University of California men's
basketball team hasn't had much trou
ble with Stanford in the recent past —
especially at Maples Pavilion, where the
two teams meet Sunday at 3 p.m. (KCBS
740 AM, KZSU 90.1 FM, Raycom-TV
Channel 5). The Bears have won 10 of
the last 11 games against the Cardinal,
including five in a row and five straight
at Maples.
Stanford has a 12-12 overall record,
and is alone in seventh place in the
Pacific 10 Conference with a 6-9 league
record. Cal, on the other hand, comes
into the matchup with a 16-11 overall
record and a 9-6 mark in the conference,
good for fourth place.
Despite inhabiting the upper echelon
of the Pac-10 and whipping Stanford 87-
72 at Harmon Gym earlier this season,
the Bears have been having something
of a disappointing year after returning
all five starters from the 1986 team — a
squad which finished third in the con
ference and was awarded an NIT berth.
In mid-January, however, California
center Leonard Taylor, then the Bears'
leading scorer and rebounder, was lost
for the season with a spinal irregularity.
"In some respects, it's been disap
pointing because expectations were so
high and we legitimately thought we
could win 24 or 25 games this season,"
California Asst. Coach Derek Alllster
said. "On the other hand, since the loss
of Leonard Taylor, we've really come
around as a team — as evidenced by our
sweep in Washington last weekend. I'm
pleased with where we are now, consid
ering what we've been through."
"Obviously losing a player the magni

tude of Leonard Taylor is going to re
quire some adjustments." Stanford
Coach Mike Montgomery said. "But
Cal's got good people and enough veter
ans to step in."
The Bears inflicted a lot of damage
even without Taylor in their 15-point
victory over the Cardinal on Jan. 17.
The hot hand for Cal that day belonged
to veteran point guard Kevin Johnson,
who nearly beat Stanford all by himself,
especially in the first half. The 6-foot-1
senior scored 26 of his game-high 31 in
that half — on an amazing 10-of-ll at
tempts from the floor and 5-of-5 from
the line.

The Stanford players know their work
is cut out for them if they are going to
stop Johnson, who is currently leading
the Bears in scoring with 16.7 points
per game. "We'll just try to play him
straight up, with whoever Is in his area
aware of him to help out," said Stanford
forward Todd Lichti, who is also leading
his team in scoring, with 17.3 points
per game. "He's so quick and he handles
the ball so well, he's hard to stop. People
have to be ready to give help when we
need it."

"Kevin's a hard player to prepare for."
Montgomery admitted. "He's hard to
contain because of his athletic ability.
We obviously can't allow him to have the
type of ballgame — certainly the half —
he had up there. We'll try to contain
him, limit the number of times he has
the ball, but if we pick him up. it will al
low everyone else on their team to
score."
"Everyone else" includes senior Dave
Butler, brother of Stanford forward Greg
Butler, who is averaging 11.5 points per
game and a team-high 6.6 rebounds per
game. The 6-9 forward was named Pac
-10 Player of the Week after his season
high 24 points in Cal's 68-66 win at
Washington State last weekend.
The other Cal starters are senior
guard Chris Washington (6.9 points per
game), sophomore center Hartmut
Ortmann (3.8 points per game) and for
ward Jon Wheeler, who has led the
Bears in scoring in three of their last
four games. The 6-7 senior, who totalled
11 points and five rebounds the last
time Cal faced Stanford, is currently
averaging 7.2 points per game and 4.3
rebounds per game.
"Jon Wheeler has to be the biggest
suprise in the Pac-10 right now." Allister
said. "He wasn't even in our plans at the
beginning of the season. For him to be
doing this right now is incredible. Who's
the guy that rose from the dead in the
Bible? Lazarus? Jon Wheeler is the
Lazarus of California basketball. He's
gone from the outhouse to the pent
house in a very short time. He's superb.
He's doing a great job."
"He's something we'll have to be con
cerned with more than we were earlier."
Lichti said. "Hopefully he won't hurt
us."

forward Todd Lichti, who is also leading
his team in scoring, with 17.3 points
per game. "He's so quick and he handles
the ball so well, he's hard to stop. People
have to be ready to give help when we
need it."

"Kevin's a hard player to prepare for."
Montgomery admitted. "He's hard to
contain because of his athletic ability.
We obviously can't allow him to have the
type of ballgame — certainly the half —
he had up there. We'll try to contain
him, limit the number of times he has
the ball, but if we pick him up. it will al
low everyone else on their team to
score."
"Everyone else" includes senior Dave
Butler, brother of Stanford forward Greg
Butler, who is averaging 11.5 points per
game and a team-high 6.6 rebounds per
game. The 6-9 forward was named Pac
-10 Player of the Week after his season
high 24 points in Cal's 68-66 win at
Washington State last weekend.
The other Cal starters are senior
guard Chris Washington (6.9 points per
game), sophomore center Hartmut
Ortmann (3.8 points per game) and for
ward Jon Wheeler, who has led the
Bears in scoring in three of their last
four games. The 6-7 senior, who totalled
11 points and five rebounds the last
time Cal faced Stanford, is currently
averaging 7.2 points per game and 4.3
rebounds per game.
"Jon Wheeler has to be the biggest
suprise in the Pac-10 right now." Allister
said. "He wasn't even in our plans at the
beginning of the season. For him to be
doing this right now is incredible. Who's
the guy that rose from the dead in the
Bible? Lazarus? Jon Wheeler is the
Lazarus of California basketball. He's
gone from the outhouse to the pent
house in a very short time. He's superb.
He's doing a great job."
"He's something we'll have to be con
cerned with more than we were earlier."
Lichti said. "Hopefully he won't hurt
us."

Stanford is winless (0-3) against California so far during sophomore Todd Lichti's
career, but the Cardinal's leading scorer (17.3 points per game) will try to remedy that
situation Sunday when Stanford meets Cal at Maples Pavilion, where the Bears have
won five straight
The University of California men's
basketball team hasn't had much trou
ble with Stanford in the recent past —
especially at Maples Pavilion, where the
two teams meet Sunday at 3 p.m. (KCBS
740 AM, KZSU 90.1 FM, Raycom-TV
Channel 5). The Bears have won 10 of
the last 11 games against the Cardinal,
including five in a row and five straight
at Maples.
Stanford has a 12-12 overall record,
and is alone in seventh place in the
Pacific 10 Conference with a 6-9 league
record. Cal, on the other hand, comes
into the matchup with a 16-11 overall
record and a 9-6 mark in the conference,
good for fourth place.
Despite inhabiting the upper echelon
of the Pac-10 and whipping Stanford 87-
72 at Harmon Gym earlier this season,
the Bears have been having something
of a disappointing year after returning
all five starters from the 1986 team — a
squad which finished third in the con
ference and was awarded an NIT berth.
In mid-January, however, California
center Leonard Taylor, then the Bears'
leading scorer and rebounder, was lost
for the season with a spinal irregularity.
"In some respects, it's been disap
pointing because expectations were so
high and we legitimately thought we
could win 24 or 25 games this season,"
California Asst. Coach Derek Alllster
said. "On the other hand, since the loss
of Leonard Taylor, we've really come
around as a team — as evidenced by our
sweep in Washington last weekend. I'm
pleased with where we are now, consid
ering what we've been through."
"Obviously losing a player the magni

tude of Leonard Taylor is going to re
quire some adjustments." Stanford
Coach Mike Montgomery said. "But
Cal's got good people and enough veter
ans to step in."
The Bears inflicted a lot of damage
even without Taylor in their 15-point
victory over the Cardinal on Jan. 17.
The hot hand for Cal that day belonged
to veteran point guard Kevin Johnson,
who nearly beat Stanford all by himself,
especially in the first half. The 6-foot-1
senior scored 26 of his game-high 31 in
that half — on an amazing 10-of-ll at
tempts from the floor and 5-of-5 from
the line.

The Stanford players know their work
is cut out for them if they are going to

the Bears in scoring with 16.7 points
per game. "We'll just try to play him
straight up, with whoever Is in his area
aware of him to help out," said Stanford
