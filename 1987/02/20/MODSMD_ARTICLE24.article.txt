## 
### JON WEISMAN Staff writer 
It's kind of like staying up to
watch "Late Night with David Let
terman" and finding out it's a
repeat.
Last night in Louisville, Ky,, the
sixth-ranked Stanford men's ten
nis team played past 12:30 a.m.,
and the show they put on was no
festival. California swept the
Cardinal in doubles to post a 5-4
win in the National Team Indoors.
The loss puts Stanford in the
tournament's consolation bracket
today against Texas Christian,
which also had a late night loss to
UCLA, 5-3. That match begins 10
hours after the teams went to bed
last night.
"We had a good tough match
against a very tough team," Stan
ford Coach Dick Gould said.
"There is no single match I was
disappointed in."
Stanford got pretty high ratings
on its prime-time singles play,
winning four of six without the
injured Patrick McEnroe.
Jeff Tarango raised his 1987
record to 10-0 by knocking off the
Bears' highly-regarded Steve
DeVries at No. 1 singles, 6-3, 7-5.
Tarango, 14th in the pre-season
rankings, figures to move up on
the basis of that win alone.
California's Woody Hunt, put
ting a tough 10-8 tiebreaker loss
in the first set to Scott Moody be
hind him. came back to beat the
Stanford senior, 6-7, 6-1, 6-4.

Moody, playing his first match at
No. 2 singles, pulled a hamstring
and is questionable for today's
match.
Gcordie McKee, after winning
the first set, lost a second-set tie
breaker 8-6 and then fell to Cali
fornia's Alex Nizet, 5-7, 7-6, 6-1.
Stanford swept the bottom half
of the singles ledger, with Jeff
Cathrall defeating Ted Scherman,
6-3, 6-3, Barry Richards beating
Kurt Streeter (Tarango's opponent
In the suspended NorCal Intercol
legiate finals) 6-4, 6-4, and Curtis
Dunn winning over Gerald Yung,
6-4. 6-2.
For Stanford, however, doubles
was indeed a repeat â€” a repeat of
the miseries that part of the
team's game has suffered this
season.
Paired for the first time.
Tarango and Moody easily fell to
DeVries and Scherman, 6-2, 6-1.
The Bears' Hunt and Brian
Flowers then put away Cathrall
and Eric Peus, 6-4, 6-2, leaving
McKee and Dunn to play Doug
Eisenman and Nizet for the
match.
The two teams split 6-4 sets, but
it was the Bears' pair in the end,
scoring a 6-2 win to give Califor
nia an upset victory.
In other action. No. 1 USC beat
Kentucky, 5-2, and it was No. 2
SMU over Miami (tied for 10th
with Louisiana State), 5-3. Pep
perdine, tied for third with UCLA,
lost to LSU, 5-1.
