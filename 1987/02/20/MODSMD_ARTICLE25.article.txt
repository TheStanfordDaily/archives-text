# Netters open Pac-10 season
## Top-ranked Card women to meet troublesome Devils, Wildcats 
### KEN STEVENS Editorial staff 
Arizona State and Arizona are the only Pacific
10 Conference women's tennis teams not ranked
in the national top 10, but when the Sun Devils
and Wildcats host No. 1-ranked Stanford today
and tomorrow, you can bet they'll battle the Card
inal right down to the last game.
"Their teams are always feisty," Stanford Coach
Frank Brennan said.
Brennan need only look back to last season's
trip to Arizona to remember just how feisty ASU
and Arizona can be. The Sun Devils split the six
singles matches with Stanford, forcing the Card
inal to sweep the doubles en route to a 6-3 victory.
Stanford won four singles matches against the
Wildcats to come away with a narrow 5-4 win at
Tucson.
ASU has graduated Sheri Norris, a singles semi
finalist in last year's NCAA championships, and
Arizona no longer has its top player of last season,
Jill Smoller. Both beat defending NCAA singles
champion Patty Fendlck when Stanford ventured
to Arizona last year.
However, with injuries to senior Leigh Anne
Eldredge and sophomore Eleni Rossides, the
Cardinal is currently not up to last year's standard
either. "This year. I would say their teams are

Senior Stephanie Savides will be at No. 2 singles today when Stanford opens its
Pacific 10 Conference season against Arizona State. Savides will also play at No. 1
doubles with senior Patty Fendick.
down a little bit; they're missing a
few players." Brennan said.
"They're a little bit weaker, but so
are we."
The Sun Devils and Wildcats
traditionally make up In confi
dence what they lack In talent.
They pride themselves on upset
ting highly ranked teams. "There
are two types of No. 15 (ranked)
teams," Brennan said. "One No.
15 team can beat everybody from
16 to 100, but never beat any of
the top 15 teams. They truly are
the 15th best team.
"Another type of No. 15 may lose
to a couple of teams below them,
but give a few of the good teams a
scare," Brennan added. "That's
what the Arizona schools are like.
They'll lose to some people, but
then they'll beat a San Diego State
7-2 after we beat them 5-4."
Stanford, 4-0 in dual matches,
opens the inaugural Pac-10
season today In Tempe at 1:30
p.m. The Sun Devils are ranked
13th In the most recent H.I.T.S.
poll.
With the graduation of Norris
and Allyson Ingram, ASU is
relying this season on senior Carol
Coparanis and sophomore Laura
Glitz. Coparanis played in the No.
2 singles spot last year and
knocked off Stanford's Marianne
Werdel in straight sets. Glitz, who
played No. 4 last season, has been
playing No. 1 this year.
Arizona, which the Cardinal
plays tomorrow morning in Tuc
son at 11, is ranked 19th nation

ally. The Wildcats return everyone
except Smoller from the team that
almost upset Stanford last season.
Brennan indicated that Tucson
has been particularly tough on the
Cardinal in recent years. "The
Arizona team has never been in
timidated by us â€” even when we
were really good and they were
really bad." he said. "It's a little an
noying."
Suzanne Russo, a winner in
both singles and doubles in last
year's Arizona-Stanford match in
Tucson, has moved up to the No. 1
singles spot vacated by Smoller.
Stanford will field its top lineup
(with the exception of the injured
Eldredge and Rossldes) this
weekend for the first time since
the opening match of the season.
Fendick. who has a 30-match col
legiate winning streak dating
back to last season, will be at No. 1
singles. She will be followed by
senior Stephanie Savides, junior
Kay Tittle, freshman Lisa Green,
junior Cari Hagey and freshman
Valerie Wilson.
Fendick and Savides will play
No. 1 doubles. Tittle and Green
No. 2 and Hagey and Wilson No. 3.
Card notes
Stanford players, both past and
present, fared well at a Virginia Slims
tournament last night in Florida.

shocked Chris Evert-Lloyd, 3-6, 6-4.
6-2, while Fendick nearly upset
fourth-seeded Helena Sukova, falling
