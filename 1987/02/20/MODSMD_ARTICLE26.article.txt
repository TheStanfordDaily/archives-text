# Stanford baseball duels good-hit, no-pitch UCSB
## 
### TOM SENF Editorial staff 
After splitting Its first six games
against Pacific Coast Athletic As
sociation competition, Stanford
figures to get Its toughest PCAA
test this weekend, as the Cardinal
travels south to face UC-Santa
Barbara in a three-game series
that begins today at 2 p.m.
According to Stanford Coach
Mark Marquess, the Cardinal will
have faced the best the PCAA has
to offer by the end of this
weekend. Stanford played Fuller
ton State two weeks ago and
Fresno State last weekend, "Those
three teams will be one-two-three
in that league." he said.
The consensus, however. Is that
UCSB will be the one in that se
quence. "Everybody is picking
Santa Barbara (to win the confer
ence) and rightfully so," Fresno
State Coach Bob Bennett said.
The Gauchos are the defending
PCAA champs with a 1986 confer
ence mark of 18-3, 45-19 overall.
This year they are 4-4-1 (yes. a tie

with Cal State-Los Angeles) and
are ranked 15th nationally by
Baseball America, 17th by
ESPN/Collegiate Baseball.
"They're supposed to be even
better this year." Marquess said.
"They haven't pitched well, but
they're a great offensive team.
They've always given us trouble,
especially down there."
UCSB took two of three from
Stanford last year at Sunken Dia
mond. In the series finale, the
Gauchos pounded the Cardinal
pitching staff for six homers in an
11-6 win.
As it was last year, the name of
the game at UCSB is offense. The
Gauchos are currently hitting
near .350 as a team, led by Tim
McKercher at .455. First-team All-
PCAA selection Tom Logan is next
on the Gaucho hit parade at .444,
followed by Greg Vella at .379.
And things are likely to get
worse for UCSB opponents before
they get better because Qulnn
Mack, another All-PCAA per
former. is not likely to remain at

his current .152 batting level for
long.
The Gauchos should provide
quite a challenge for a Cardinal
staff that will bring a 2.75 ERA
into this weekend. Stanford is
holding opposing hitters to a
paltry .215 average.
There's an old baseball saying
that good pitching stops good hit
ting, but Marquess is not putting
much faith in cliches. "I think it
may be true over the long haul,
over a season." he said. "But in a
three-game series I think it goes
out the window."
The key to the series may well
not be whether the highly-touted
Stanford pitching staff can stifle
the highly-touted UCSB offense,
but whether the inconsistent
Cardinal attack can take advan
tage of the consistent — as in con
sistently terrible — Gaucho pltch-
Ing.
UCSB currently has a team ERA
of 6.53. Tomorrow's starter, right
hander Steve Connolly, has been

Lee Plemel deserved congratulations after his seven hit shutout of Fresno State last Saturday. Plemel s
performance earned him Pacific 10 Southern Division Pitcher of the Week honors, the second time in
three weeks that he has won the award. Plemel will start for Stanford today against hard-hitting UC-Santa
Barbara.
particularly generous, with an 0-2
record and a 16.20 ERA. One
Gaucho hurler who has been
stingy is left-hander Renay
Bryand, who is 1-0 with a 2.93
ERA. Bryand will start tonight for
UCSB, with Dan Peters (0-0, 5.40)
going Sunday.

Stanford has struggled at times
offensively. The Cardinal has a
team batting average of .261 and
began the week last among Pacific
10 Southern Division teams in
hitting. Stanford is averaging 6.5
runs per game, but has yet to
show it can produce consistently.
"We're capable of scoring in
bunches, but we haven't put con
sistent pressure on other teams,"
Marquess said. "We'd like to give
our good pitching a cushion."

Even in Tuesday's 10-1 win over
UC-Davis, the Cardinal scored in
just three of the game's innings.
Lee Plemel (2-2, 1.80) will start
today for Stanford. Plemel was
recently named Six-Pac Pitcher of
the Week for the second time this
year for his seven-hit shutout per
formance last Saturday against
Fresno State. Steve Chitren (2-0,
2.18) will get the call tomorrow
and Jack McDowell (1-1, 6.00) will
throw on Sunday.

KZSU Radio (90.1 FM) will carry
all three of this weekend's games.
Game time tomorrow and Sunday
is 1 p.m.
Card notes
Stanford has a monopoly on the
Pitcher of the Week award. Plemel
won it In weeks one and three of the
season, with Chitren getting the
award in week number two.
The Cardinal Is ranked fourth in the
latest Baseball America and
ESPN/Collegiate Baseball polls.

Pitcher of the Week award. Plemel
won it In weeks one and three of the
season, with Chitren getting the
award in week number two.
The Cardinal Is ranked fourth in the
latest Baseball America and
ESPN/Collegiate Baseball polls.
After splitting Its first six games
against Pacific Coast Athletic As
sociation competition, Stanford
figures to get Its toughest PCAA
test this weekend, as the Cardinal
travels south to face UC-Santa
Barbara in a three-game series
that begins today at 2 p.m.
According to Stanford Coach
Mark Marquess, the Cardinal will
have faced the best the PCAA has
to offer by the end of this
weekend. Stanford played Fuller
ton State two weeks ago and
Fresno State last weekend, "Those
three teams will be one-two-three
in that league." he said.
The consensus, however. Is that
UCSB will be the one in that se
quence. "Everybody is picking
Santa Barbara (to win the confer
ence) and rightfully so," Fresno
State Coach Bob Bennett said.
The Gauchos are the defending
PCAA champs with a 1986 confer
ence mark of 18-3, 45-19 overall.
This year they are 4-4-1 (yes. a tie

with Cal State-Los Angeles) and
are ranked 15th nationally by
Baseball America, 17th by
ESPN/Collegiate Baseball.
"They're supposed to be even
better this year." Marquess said.
"They haven't pitched well, but
they're a great offensive team.
They've always given us trouble,
especially down there."
UCSB took two of three from
Stanford last year at Sunken Dia
mond. In the series finale, the
Gauchos pounded the Cardinal
pitching staff for six homers in an
11-6 win.
As it was last year, the name of
the game at UCSB is offense. The
Gauchos are currently hitting
near .350 as a team, led by Tim
McKercher at .455. First-team All-
PCAA selection Tom Logan is next
on the Gaucho hit parade at .444,
followed by Greg Vella at .379.
And things are likely to get
worse for UCSB opponents before
they get better because Qulnn
Mack, another All-PCAA per
former. is not likely to remain at

his current .152 batting level for
long.
The Gauchos should provide
quite a challenge for a Cardinal
staff that will bring a 2.75 ERA
into this weekend. Stanford is
holding opposing hitters to a
paltry .215 average.
There's an old baseball saying
that good pitching stops good hit
ting, but Marquess is not putting
much faith in cliches. "I think it
may be true over the long haul,
over a season." he said. "But in a
three-game series I think it goes
out the window."
The key to the series may well
not be whether the highly-touted
Stanford pitching staff can stifle
the highly-touted UCSB offense,
but whether the inconsistent
Cardinal attack can take advan
tage of the consistent — as in con
sistently terrible — Gaucho pltch-
Ing.
UCSB currently has a team ERA
of 6.53. Tomorrow's starter, right
hander Steve Connolly, has been

Lee Plemel deserved congratulations after his seven hit shutout of Fresno State last Saturday. Plemel s
performance earned him Pacific 10 Southern Division Pitcher of the Week honors, the second time in
three weeks that he has won the award. Plemel will start for Stanford today against hard-hitting UC-Santa
Barbara.
particularly generous, with an 0-2
record and a 16.20 ERA. One
Gaucho hurler who has been
stingy is left-hander Renay
Bryand, who is 1-0 with a 2.93
ERA. Bryand will start tonight for
UCSB, with Dan Peters (0-0, 5.40)
going Sunday.

Stanford has struggled at times
offensively. The Cardinal has a
team batting average of .261 and
began the week last among Pacific
10 Southern Division teams in
hitting. Stanford is averaging 6.5
runs per game, but has yet to
show it can produce consistently.
"We're capable of scoring in
bunches, but we haven't put con
sistent pressure on other teams,"
Marquess said. "We'd like to give
our good pitching a cushion."

Even in Tuesday's 10-1 win over
UC-Davis, the Cardinal scored in
just three of the game's innings.
Lee Plemel (2-2, 1.80) will start
today for Stanford. Plemel was
recently named Six-Pac Pitcher of
the Week for the second time this
year for his seven-hit shutout per
formance last Saturday against
Fresno State. Steve Chitren (2-0,
2.18) will get the call tomorrow
and Jack McDowell (1-1, 6.00) will
throw on Sunday.

KZSU Radio (90.1 FM) will carry
all three of this weekend's games.
Game time tomorrow and Sunday
is 1 p.m.
