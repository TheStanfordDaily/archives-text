# Cardinal fencers conclude regular season at California
## 
### CHRIS CRADER Staff writer 
The Stanford men's and
women's fencing teams, which
unlil now have often been going in
different directions, have one last
chance to simultaneously shift
into high gear as they face Califor
nia tomorrow in Berkeley at 1
p.m.
The women are coming off of
their biggest win of the season, a
9-7 victory over UC-Santa Cruz,
while the men will try to rebound
from their loss to the Banana
Slugs. The women are 11-3 and
the men are 7-8.
This is the last match of the reg
ular season for both squads. The
women's West Regionals are next
weekend at Stanford. The men's
regionals are the following
weekend at Fullerton State.
The women's victory over UCSC
reaffirmed Stanford as the West's

top power, and the Cardinal
should not have too much trouble
with the Bears, which Stanford
defeated 11-5 in November.
Leading the way will be senior cap
tain Holly Taylor, who has a 47-5
record on the year. One of those
losses came against a Cal south
paw earlier in the season. Al
though she admitted that left
handers are always tough, Taylor
doesn't expect to lose again.
"1 shouldn't have lost it." she
said of her only loss in the west
region. "Hopefully 1 can rectify
that."
Alyson Yarus is also having a
great year, as the senior has gone
21-2 in her last six matches. Tracy
Schmidt is doing well in the No. 3
spot, having posted a 10-6 mark
over the same period.
The men also have a good
chance at victory, having defeated
Cal this season as well. The No

vember score was 15-12, but Stan
ford has improved since then.
The men will be again led by the
sabre team, which shut out Cal
last time and has a 10-match win
streak. Senior Steve Levitan has
won 29 straight bouts and junior
Mik*. Cramer has a 34-10 record
on the year.
The epee team also beat Cal last
time, by a 5-4 score. The Card
inal's No. 1 is Larry Murk, and the
senior has posted a 38-7 mark for
the season.
The foil team, with all partici
pants in their first year of compe
tition, could be the key to how
close the match is.
After the last match, two weeks
ago. Stanford Coach Buzz Hurst
said, "This is the first time I've
seen really significant improve
ment in the foil team." If this
trend continues, the foil team
could be able to score some very
important match points.
