As a baby, Scott Wiggen was probably very diffi
cult to put in a cradle. Now, as a Stanford All-
America wrestler, putting the 150-pound senior
in a cradle is close to impossible. That is what
Wiggen's opponent is likely to find out as the
Cardinal takes on San Jose State tomorrow night
at 7:30 in San Jose.
Wiggen, who holds the Stanford wrestling
record for most career wins, will lead the Cardinal,
along with co-captain Kurt Kassulke against, the
Spartans.
The meet against the Spartans marks the final
dual meet for the Cardinal this season, as well as
the last opportunity the Stanford wrestlers have
to compete before the Pacific 10 Conference
tournament in March.
According to Cardinal wrestler Steve
Yarbrough, tomorrow's match holds much signifi
cance, both for himself and the team.
"We want to finish the season strong as we go
into the Pac-lOs. If we win against San Jose State
tomorrow night, hopefully we will be able to use
the momentum to our advantage at the Pac-10
tournament later on," Yarbrough said.

Stanford and San Jose State have actually come
full circle In dual meet action. Last November, the
Spartans were the Cardinal's first dual meet op
ponent of the season. The Spartans won that
match, but the Stanford team has come a long
way since then. In its last encounter with the
Spartans, at the All-Cal tournament held in Janu
ary, the Cardinal squad placed well ahead of San
Jose State.
Perhaps it was this last loss to the Cardinal that
prompted the San Jose State coach to make
several changes in his lineup. The Spartan
wrestler that Yarbrough beat in the All-Cal tourn
ament at 158 pounds will now move up to 167
pounds to wrestle Stanford junior Eric Harber,
while the man that Cardinal Brian Veit (134
pounds) lost to by a close 10-8 margin during
their early season dual meet will move to the 126-
pound division, where he will face Stanford's Josh
Lisle,
The Cardinal should be fairly well-rested for its
meet tomorrow night, since it had all last weekend
to relax after a last-minute decision to pull out of
the Southern Cal Duals in Fullerton.
The road trip down to San Jose shouldn't be too
arduous, either.
