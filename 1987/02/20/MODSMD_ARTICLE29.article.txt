# Swimmers take on Cal
## A
						Big Meet in name only 
### ERIK ESELIUS Senior staff writer 
It's called the Big Meet, and by all means. It's an
important contest. But during the course of the dual
meet against host California, don't expect the Stan
ford men's swimming team to participate in any
"Give 'em the Axe" cheer.
For starters, it's a rather insipid chant. Most
notably, however, this is not the do-or-die football
equivalent.
Tomorrow's 1 p.m. dual meet will be more of a
preparatory effort to the ensuing Pacific 10 Confer
ence championships than that of an intense head-to
head battle.
Led by Olympian Matt Biondi the Golden Bears are
indeed a talented group that always seems to excel by
the end of the season despite traditionally slow
starts.
"The meet will be a good indicator for us to see how
good they will be at the [NCAAsI," junior backstroker
Sean Murphy said. "We want to gain some confi
dence this weekend for Pac-lOs."
"Cal is a potential threat at NCAAs," senior tri
captain Sam McAdam added. 'We want to get one-up
on them."
And if nothing else, as freshman John Witchell

cavalierly pointed out. "It's always fun to beat the
Weenies."
To accomplish this. Stanford will use its strongest
lineup not only to ensure victory, but also to focus on
qualifying more swimmers for the upcoming NCAAs
held in the first week of April.
"It's (the meet) really geared toward people
specializing and getting some experience in different
events," Stanford Asst. Coach Ted Knapp said.
According to Knapp. the mile and the 400-yard in
dividual medley will be held in order for swimmers to
prepare for the NCAAs, which, unlike the regular
season, includes these events.
One event that should prove particularly interest
ing this weekend is the 100 butterfly, Knapp said.
Cal's Biondi, who is currently hampered by a nag
ging muscle injury, may have to enter the 100 butter
fly in an attempt to break up the Cardinal's potential
sweep led by Anthony Mosse, Pablo Morales and Jay
Mortenson. Biondi will also most likely compete in
the 50 and 100 freestyle.
Winning aside, what would really cause Stanford
swimmers and coaches to cheer would be to qualify
more individuals for the NCAAs.
Presently, Stanford has five swimmers slated for
NCAAs with six others looming on the edge. Knapp
had high hopes for the breaststroke corps as well.

With the help of swimmers such as sophomore Jay Mortenson, Stanford is expected to cruise past Cali
fornia tomorrow in Berkeley. The Cardinal will be racing the clock as well as the Bears as it tries to qualify
as many swimmers as possible for the upcoming NCAA Championships. Mortenson has already qualified
in his specialty, the 100-yard butterfly.
