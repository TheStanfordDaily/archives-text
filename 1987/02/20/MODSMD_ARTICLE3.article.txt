# Computers help protein research

A team of scientists at Stanford, trying to
gain information on how protein molecules
work, has developed a computer system that
uses nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spec
troscopy and artificial intelligence to analyze
protein molecules as they exist in nature.
This is the first time that NMR and artificial
intelligence have been used jointly in the study
of protein molecules.
The expert system, called Protean, was
developed as a joint effort by scientists at the
Stanford Magnetic Resonance Laboratory
(SMRL) and the Stanford Knowlege Systems
Laboratory, in an effort to use computers to
mimic human reasoning powers. Using data

from NMR. which was discovered by former
Stanford Prof. Felix Bloch, in concert with ar
tificial intelligence, it has given scientists the
clearest picturc yet of a protein molecule.
The study of protein molecules is important
to scientists in understanding how biological
systems work.
"Protean is the name of an expert system."
said medical student Olivier Lichtarge, one of
the scientists involved in the project. "It
belongs to a class of computer programs which
are buill so thai they can perform specialized
tasks as well or better than what a human
could do.
"We try to extract from human experts what
it is that they do so well and encode it into a
computer system," said Lichtarge.

Oleg Jardetsky, director of SMRL, said,
"There are some major kinds of questions that
should be answerable using this system. . . .
Protean allows you to look at the binding of
other molecules to the proteins."
Jardetzky explained that proteins, which are
composed of amino acids, work by binding
other molecules to the amino acids. After bin
ding, the protein can perform a number of
functions, such as molecule splitting, synthe
sis or transport, depending on the "specificity"
of the protein.
Jardetzky said scientists are also interested
in examining folding in the molecular
