# Computers help protein research

A team of scientists at Stanford, trying to
gain information on how protein molecules
work, has developed a computer system that
uses nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spec
troscopy and artificial intelligence to analyze
protein molecules as they exist in nature.
This is the first time that NMR and artificial
intelligence have been used jointly in the study
of protein molecules.
The expert system, called Protean, was
developed as a joint effort by scientists at the
Stanford Magnetic Resonance Laboratory
(SMRL) and the Stanford Knowlege Systems
Laboratory, in an effort to use computers to
mimic human reasoning powers. Using data

from NMR. which was discovered by former
Stanford Prof. Felix Bloch, in concert with ar
tificial intelligence, it has given scientists the
clearest picturc yet of a protein molecule.
The study of protein molecules is important
to scientists in understanding how biological
systems work.
"Protean is the name of an expert system."
said medical student Olivier Lichtarge, one of
the scientists involved in the project. "It
belongs to a class of computer programs which
are buill so thai they can perform specialized
tasks as well or better than what a human
could do.
"We try to extract from human experts what
it is that they do so well and encode it into a
computer system," said Lichtarge.

Oleg Jardetsky, director of SMRL, said,
"There are some major kinds of questions that
should be answerable using this system. . . .
Protean allows you to look at the binding of
other molecules to the proteins."
Jardetzky explained that proteins, which are
composed of amino acids, work by binding
other molecules to the amino acids. After bin
ding, the protein can perform a number of
functions, such as molecule splitting, synthe
sis or transport, depending on the "specificity"
of the protein.
Jardetzky said scientists are also interested
in examining folding in the molecular
structures of proteins. In their ef
forts to understand how they
work.
"One can. using this method,
look at the question of folding as
well as the question of specificity."
said Jardetzky. "Those are pretty
far-reaching specifications."
"What we're trying to do is
analyze the three-dimensional
structures of protein molecules,"
said Computer Science Research
Associate James Brlnkley, an
other scientist in the Protean
team. "Once we know the
structures, we can figure out
function, and once we know
structure relates to function, we
can eventually design new ones."
The study of proteins Is not
new. The Protean system,
however, with its unique ap
proach of using NMR in conjunc
tion with artificial intelligence, is
the most successful.
"There are labs in Switzerland
and Holland that are relatively
successful," said Jardetzky, "but

none of these groups have the type
of A.I. (artificial intelligence) ex
pertise we have here at Stanford.
We have a lucky combination."
Although the main source of
data used by Protean in the
analyses Is NMR, other sources of
information, such as neutron dif
fraction and small-angle X-ray
scattering, are used. However, the
information obtainable from these
alternative sources Is not as useful
as that from NMR.
"The quality of the data coming
from NMR is better than anything
else," said Llchtarge.
Brinkley agreed. "It's a very hard
problem to solve using ordinary
methods," he said. "We have a
blurry picture of a protein. . . . We
can get it very fast on a very cheap
machine. We're trying to build a
more complete system that pro
vides a more complete answer."
All of the molecular structures
that have been derived so far have
been calculated from data on
proteins in crystal form. The ad
vantage of the Protean system is
that it is able to examine data on
proteins in solution, which Is how
they are found in the human
body.
