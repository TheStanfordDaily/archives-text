## 
### ALICIA KENT Staff writer 
The plan of attack for the Stan
ford men's volleyball team, which
plays at Long Beach State tonight
at 7:30. will be to return to the
drawing board after the Cardinal's
loss to No. 1 UCLA Wednesday
night. Stanford will complete Its
three-match road trip and return
home after tomorrow's match
against the No. 3 USC Trojans at
7:30 p.m.
After a day of practice and rest,
and, for many of the players from
Southern California, a return
home, the No. 6 Cardinal will face
the No. 8 49ers, who have a losing
conference record of 2-3.
Cardinal players will be facing a
new serving order and backcourt
attack, according to Coach Fred
Sturm. "UCLA made us look worse
than we really are," Sturm said
after Wednesday's loss. The loss
made Sturm look at the team's
weaknesses and try to re-evaluate
its strengths. "We need to go back
to the drawing board," he said.
However, the match will not be
an easy one for the Cardinal,
which split matches last year with
the 49ers. "Long Beach is the
most unpredictable team we'll
play," Stanford Asst. Coach
Ruben Nieves said. "Last year
when we played them they played
one of their best matches ever."
Long Beach is expected to fight
hard In its match against Stan
ford. "They'll approach this one
like a big match," Nieves said.
"We'll have to prepare like they're
at their best. When they're at their
best, they can beat anybody."
For tomorrow's match against

USC. Stanford will have an experi
enced team to face, including
1986 NCAA Player of the Year
Adam Johnson, a senior outside
hitter. "USC has some very good
players but they're not always
steady. Certain players are not in
vincible," Nieves said.

'Ifind we're very
capable of win
ning both USC
and Long
Beach.' -

The Trojans have established a
strong conference record of 3-1,
beating Northridge, UC-Santa
Barbara and San Diego State and
losing to Pepperdine.
For tonight and tomorrow's
matches. It will be important for
the Cardinal to forget Wednes
day's match, which Sturm felt was
taken too seriously, and focus on
Its own side of the net. "When we
play teams as different as these
three, we will work on our own
team, regardless of our op
ponent," Nieves said.
The players wouldn't predict the
outcome of either match, al
though they are confident that if
they play up to their potential,
they have the talent to win. "I find
we're very capable of winning both
USC and Long Beach," said fresh
man setter Parker Blackman.
