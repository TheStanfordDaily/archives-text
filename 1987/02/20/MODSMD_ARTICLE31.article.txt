# Gymnasts seek season highs
## Women host Hobee's Invitatonal, travel to California 
### EVAN TUCHINSKY Staff writer 
It's deja vu all over again this
weekend as the Stanford wo
men's gymnastics team experi
ences Its second consecutive
back-to-back meet weekend,
facing Oregon State and Cal
State-Northridge tonight at
Maples Pavilion in the Hobee's
Invitational before traveling to
UC-Berkeley tomorrow for its
third clash this season with the
Bears.
"It's another two-meet week
end," Stanford Coach Homer
Sardlna said. "The first meet Is
the important meet. We want to
do well, really well, in that meet.
That's where we'll put our con
centration.
"It's going to be a two-team
race between Oregon State and

Stanford." he continued.
"There's no doubt about that.
Northrldge Is a very good Divi
sion II team, but they're out of
their league with us. Oregon
State beat Washington (ranked
No. 12 nationally) two weeks ago.
so they're not a team to be taken
lightly."
Sardlna said he thought the
Cardinal would perform well
during the meet. "The girls are
primed to hit routines. We will
see how much they believe they
are a 185 team." he said. A score
of 185 generally indicates a team
is of post-season competition
caliber.
Orx individual performers, the
coaches did make predictions.
"I'm anticipating a really good
performance from Jinny Rhee,"
Shaw said.
"Jinny's been hitting and get

ting bad scores," he added. "Now
at home she'll get the scores."
Stanford Asst. Coach Sam
Shaw said. "If we get the crowd
participating and behind us.
there will be no way they can
touch us."
More than in most other
sports, crowd support really
creates a home court advantage.
"We saw in Fullerton (last Friday)
that if the crowd Is really
supportive, the judges tend to
give the athlete the benefit of the
doubt," Shaw said.
"I would like to see a good
turnout, and with that support
we'll have the home court advan
tage like other schools do." Shaw
continued. "The girls will hit the
routines, and the fans will get
the scores."
On the subject of scoring. Sar
dlna chose to be silent. "I'm not

going to predict scores this
meet." he said. "Every time I do
it's a bad omen."
As for the California meet,
other Cardinal gymnasts will be
thrust Into the spotlight. "As far
as Saturday, we're going work
with Susan Banta and Becky
Ashton in all-around," Sardina
said. "We're going to compete
every person but Nancl
Goldsmith. Jinny will work a few
events, Cindy Boyd will work
two, Cheryl Doo will work one
and Dina Amoroso will work
one."
Sophomore Jessica Armstrong
will be a key member of the Stan
ford squad. Armstrong will not
compete tonight in order to rest
for tomorrow, when she will
compete in three events, accord
ing to Sardina, "to pick up some
of the slack."
