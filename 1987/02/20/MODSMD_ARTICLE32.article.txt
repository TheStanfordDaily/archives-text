# Cardinal men shooting for 275 against Fullerton State

### MARK SMOYER Staff writer 
It's getting better all the time. The Beatles
said this and now the Stanford men's gym
nastics team is saying it as it goes into yet
another meet expecting yet another season
best team score.
"We've changed a few of the guys' difficulty,
and we've cleaned up a lot," Stanford Coach
Sadao Hamada said. "We've also improved
our consistency a little."
All this has occurred in the past week of
workouts after the squad's best meet of the
winter at the Hobee's Invitational. Tonight,
the Cardinal hopes to see the effects of these
improvements as it visits Fullerton State for
its only competition this weekend.

Hamada considers Fullerton, with a team
high score of 279.35, one of the nation's top
five teams. But Hamada said he thinks the
Cardinal can defeat the Titans. "The guys
have improved a lot (since last week), and I'll
be using Scott (Schaffer) in at least three
events."
Schaffer suffered a shoulder Injury two
weeks ago, forcing him out of four events in
last Friday's meet. Also, junior Chuck
Gerardo may be able to throw a complete
high bar routine tonight for the first time
since he injured his wrist three weeks ago. It
is the smoothing over of these rough edges
that could lead the Cardinal back into the
nation's elite.
The condition of the two returning ath
letes may hinder the team somewhat

tonight. Freshman Charles Loop said, "We're
still trying to get healthy," but overall the
outlook from a physical standpoint is the
best it has been this year. Loop added,
however, that freshman Adam Forman will
be redshirting this season due to continuing
shoulder problems.
Loop said Stanford will be looking more
toward improving its score than toward
defeating Fullerton. "We want to go 275-plus
(tonight)," Loop said. "We want to be at 278
by the time Fullerton comes up here (next
weekend)."
Loop said that these consecutive three
point jumps from the team's present top
score of 272 are possible because "our diffi
culty will be improved so our potential is
much greater than it was."
