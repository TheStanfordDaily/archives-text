# Women battle Cal at Harmon
## 
### PABLO MORALES Staff writer 
Nothing is easier for the Stan
ford women's basketball team
than getting psyched up for Cali
fornia.
But the Cardinal also knows
that nothing's harder than
beating the Bears in Harmon
Gym. even if Cal is only the
seventh-place team in the Pacific
10 Conference.
The fact of the matter is that
Stanford is currently just one
place higher than its East Bay
rival, and furthermore, the Card
inal historically has had trouble
winning in the Bears' lair.
Stanford is not the only one.
At home this season Cal has
defeated both Pac-10 power
houses, Washington and USC.
The mighty Trojans received a
102-85 thrashing in January, and
last week, the Washington Hus
kies dropped into a first-place tie
with USC after losing to the Bears,
92-84.
This season, the Bears boast a
10-2 record at home (13-9 overall).
The 12-11 Cardinal has not won
in Harmon Gym since the 1980-81
season.
In their last meeting, Stanford
played perhaps its finest half of
basketball this season during the

second stanza en route to 77-59
whipping of the Bears at Maples
Pavilion in January.
In that game, the Cardinal
defense held the Bears' star cen
ter. Jennifer Bennet. to just two
points in the second half while
frustrating Cal's three dead-eye
shooters from Finland — Seija
Leino, Anja Hellman and Mia
Kuusisto — with good defensive
pressure thoughout the game, but
especially in the second half. The
59 points against Stanford marks
Cal's lowest output of the season.
Stanford will definitely need to
put two strong defensive halves to
gether if It wishes to keep pace
with the Bears, who. as the 102
points against USC and the 92
against a stingy Husky defense in
dicate. have a habit of scoring a
great deal at home.
In the game against Washing
ton, Bennet tossed in a school
record 44 points, then scored 25
as an encore in Cal's following vic
tory over Washington State. One
of the leading candidates for the
conference Player of the Year, she
is averaging 21.5 points and 9.6
rebounds per game for the Bears.
Stanford occupies sixth place in
the Pac-10 standings with a 6-7
mark, and Cal, having won its last
two conference games, is just a
game behind at 5-8.
