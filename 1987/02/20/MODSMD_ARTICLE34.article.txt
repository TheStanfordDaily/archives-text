# Doctors plan bulimia study here

Since bulimia became a prevalent medical
problem in the late 19605, there has been a
steady number of severe cases of bulimia, ac
cording to Psychiatry Prof. W. Stewart Agras.
who Is planning to conduct a study on the
disease here.
Agras said he is looking for bulimic Stanford
students to participate in the study.
A victim of bulimia typically binges on food,
induces vomiting and uses laxatives and
diuretics for fear of gaining weight, said Agras.
One of the causes of bulimia is society's
"extreme concentration on a fashionable thin
figure, which mainly affects women," he said.
"Society should get rid of this thin image if we
are to prevent bulimia," he added.
Agras said that about 1 to 1.5 percent of the
U.S. population suffers from severe bulimia
and that a victim of a severe case of the disease
vomits an average of 10 times a week, said
Agras. About 5 to 10 percent of the college pop
ulation suffers from milder cases of bulimia,
vomiting an average of once a month, he said.
Sixty percent of all high school girls go on
diets, yet only a small percentage of them
become bulimic, said Agras. He added that
this discrepancy can be explained by a mal

function of the slnotonin mechanism in the
bodies of those who suffer from the disease.
Slnotonin is a chemical excreted by the body
when it has eaten enough, Agras said.
Despite this physiological theory, research
ers are unsure whether the cause of the
disease is physical or psychological. Agras
said.
In the early 1980s, anti-depressant drugs —
when used in a study on depression — were ac
cidentally found to cure bulimia, said Elise
Rossiter, a Stanford staff psychologist who will
help Agras In the study. "Most bulimics are
also suffering from depression," said Agras.
Agras said his upcoming study will concen
trate on the effects of the anti-depressant
desipramine, a component of imipramine,
which was used in a previous study on bulimia
also conducted at Stanford by Agras.
Rossiter said the study is mainly interested
in the physiological and pharmaceutical
aspects of bulimia. Rossiter will monitor psy
chological fluctuations through psychological
interviews and personal records on mood
swings kept by the patients, but "there will be
no psychological therapy involved," Rossiter
said.
Agras said he believes that if the physiologi
cal factors of bulimia are cured, psychological

recovery will follow. "We want to find out
whether the patient will relapse or whether
this treatment will be of a certain duration,
said Rosslter. "We're looking for the optimal
duration of the treatment."
There will be no placebo condition, unlike in
the previous study, said Rosslter. One group
will be administered the drug for six weeks and
another for 12 weeks, she said. If patients
relapse, they will be given the option to start
again with the drugs, said Rosslter.
The drugs will be administered In a con
trolled manner, said Rosslter. Because of side
effects such as blurred vision, constipation
and dryness of the mouth, psychiatrists will
adjust the dosages to individual needs.
The patients will have to come In once a
week at first and later, only once every two or
three weeks, Rosslter said.
Both Agras and Rosslter said that bulimia is
life-threatening.
Rapid weight loss and vomiting cause the
depletion of salt and vital body fluids, said
Agras. Rossiter said vomiting itself causes
electrolyte disturbances that lead to ir
regularities in heart rate. Renal problems and
erosion of the teeth due to acids are other ef
fects of bulimia, she said.
