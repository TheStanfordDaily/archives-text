# Conference examines sex roles

Gender identity and its influences on behavior
are rooted in the individual's early life as an infant
and toddler.
How gender influences behavior — or whether it
does at all — depends on group processes and the
individual as a member of the group.
The role of gender in shaping behavior is deter
mined by the individual and his or her society.
These varying theories were presented yester
day by three psychologists and sociologists as part
of a two-day conference titled "Theoretical Per
spectives on Sexual Difference."
Sponsored by Stanford's Institute for Research
on Women and Gender, the conference brings to
gether biologists, lawyers, historians, philosop
hers. psychologists and other scholars to discuss

the origins and implications of
sexual difference. The conference
continues today with two after
noon sessions.
Yesterday's panel on
"Psychological and Sociological
Perspectives on Sexual Difference"
drew a predominantly female au
dience of approximately 150
people !o Kresge Auditorium.
Formation of a gender identity
and its influence on behavior oc
curs during the first few years of
life, according to panelist Nancy
Chodorow. an assistant professor
of sociology at UC-Berkeley who is
noted for her work on psycho
analytic feminist theory.
Young children become aware of
their genitals and therefore of
their gender before they recognize

sexual differences, and these early
realizations have profound Influ
ence on an individual's behavior
and perception of the self,
Chodorow said.
Gender's influence on behavior
is dependent on group processes
and the individual as a member of
a group, said Barrie Thorne, pro
fessor of sociology at Michigan
State. Gender may be more impor
tant when an individual is acting
as a member of one group than
when he or she is acting as a
member of another group, she
said.
Studies of gender-related behav
ior place too much Importance on
those moments when gender is
salient and not enough on those
when gender has little or no influ
ence on behavior, Thorne said.
The resultant belief that males
and females are essentially differ
ent must be challenged, she said.
"A spirit of opposition and con

trast pervades the interpretation''
of statistics on gender-related be
havior, resulting in heavily dualis
tic studies.
Referring specifically to studies
of child behavior, Thorne said:
"The literature suffers from acute
androcentrlsm. Boys are des
cribed first and in greater detail;
girls are contrasted to the 'norm'
of boys."
She also took issue with the as
sumption that children live in
gender-segregated worlds with vir
tually no interaction. "Boys and
girls do not live in a world of pur
dah or sexual apartheid. They are
found together in families, in
classes . . . and interaction varies
with the situation they are in."
While conceding that "when the
topic Is gender, there is no escap
ing differences," Thorne sugges
ted a fluid approach to gender that
makes less use of dichotomy and
places more emphasis on the in

fluence of variable social context
and those aspects of an individ
ual's identity other than gender,
such as race and class.
There are three determinants of
how much influence gender
wields on an individual's behav
ior: the individual's attitudes, the
other person's attitudes and the
context, according to Kay Deaux,
a fellow at Stanford's Center for
Advanced Study in the Behavioral
Sciences. The individual and soci
ety determine the importance of
gender in any behaviorial choice.
This model of influence ack
nowledges behavior that does not
reflect the regular patterns of
gender-differentiated behavior in
Western society, Deaux said. It
allows for the continuum of influ
ence — from none to strong —
that gender has on behavior and
recognizes that behaviorial
choices have numerous motiva
tions beyond gender.
