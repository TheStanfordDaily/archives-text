Gender identity and its influences on behavior
are rooted in the individual's early life as an infant
and toddler.
How gender influences behavior — or whether it
does at all — depends on group processes and the
individual as a member of the group.
The role of gender in shaping behavior is deter
mined by the individual and his or her society.
These varying theories were presented yester
day by three psychologists and sociologists as part
of a two-day conference titled "Theoretical Per
spectives on Sexual Difference."
Sponsored by Stanford's Institute for Research
on Women and Gender, the conference brings to
gether biologists, lawyers, historians, philosop
hers. psychologists and other scholars to discuss
