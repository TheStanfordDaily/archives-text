# O'Neill to speak at graduation
## 
### MARK LAWRENCE Senior staff writer 
Thomas "Tip" O'Neill, recently
retired speaker of the U.S. House
of Representatives, will be the
featured speaker at Stanford's
96th Commencement on June 14.
The Massachusetts Democrat,
who decided not to seek re
election in November after 34
years in the House, represented
the state's Bth District, which in
cludes Harvard, the Massachu
setts Institute of Technology and
20 other institutions of higher
education. O'Neill served as
speaker of the House for 10 years,
the longest continuous tenure in
the history of that position.
A consistent opponent of the
Reagan administration, O'Neill
earned a reputation for his
defense of liberal policies in a per
iod dominated by a conservative
swing in U.S. politics. Despite his
differences with the Reagan ad
ministration, however, public
policy polls repeatedly rated
O'Neill the second most influential
U.S. politician behind Reagan.
O'Neill's acceptance of the invi
tation was announced yesterday
by Acting University President
James Rosse, ending months of
secret deliberation by a committee
of students, faculty and staff as
sembled to draw up a list of candi

dates from which Rosse could
choose.
The speech will take place in
Stanford Stadium, which has
seated crowds estimated between
25,000 and 30,000 for graduation
ceremonies in recent years.
Members of the selection com
mittee said they were pleased with
the selection of O'Neill. No mem
ber would say, however, whether
O'Neill was Stanford's first choice
or if any other candidate had
turned down an offer.
Panel members said the Univer
sity was embarrassed last year
when the selection process was
publicized, revealing that Ted
Koppel, anchor of ABC television's
"Nightline," was not Stanford's
first choice.
Graduate student Kenneth War
ren, one of four students on the
selection committee, said O'Neill
was not a "clear-cut" choice. He
said the panel had originally
preferred a speaker with a back
ground in literature or the arts.
But committee members said
they had no regrets about select
ing the former politician.
"He's in a position of being en
gaged with current events, yet he
has lifted himself above political
partisanship," Warren said. "He
would not use the Commence
ment speech as a forum for
making a politically Interested ad
dress."
Committee member B.G. Porter,
one of the senior class presidents,
said O'Neill's appearance will not
associate Stanford with his politi
cal position. "He's much less of a
political figure now that he's out
of politics," Porter said. "Having
him doesn't make a particular po
litical statement by the Univer
sity."
The members of this year's se

lection committee also Included:
Norman Wessells, dean of
Humanities and Sciences; Robert
Freelen, vice president for public
affairs; Thomas Ambrogi, acting
dean of the chapel; Drama Prof.
Charles Lyons; Art Prof. Jody Max
min; senior Mary Obana; and
graduate student Carey Crutcher.
The committee advises the presi
dent, who extends the invitation.
O'Neill traveled to New Orleans
for a speaking engagement yester
day and was unavailable for com
ment, but the scheduling secre
tary at his Boston office, Francine
Gannon, said O'Neill was "quite
honored" by the invitation.

Gannon said O'Neill has been
speaking two to three times a
week since retiring from Congress
and has been "inundated" with re
quests to speak at June gradua
tion ceremonies.
O'Neill, who received his bach
elor's degree from Boston College
in 1936, served for 16 years in the
Massachusetts House of Repre
sentatives before going to Wash
ington.
His only defeat in an election
came during his senior year in col
lege, when he ran for the
Cambridge City Council and lost
by 150 votes. The following fall, he
ran for the state house and won.

O'Neill's support in Cambridge
helped him win a close-fought
1952 campaign to succeed John
F. Kennedy as the district's U.S.
representative.
Recent Stanford Commence
ment speakers have included:
Stanford graduate Koppel last
year; New York Gov. Mario Cuomo
in 1985; former University Presi
dent Richard Lyman, president of
the Rockefeller Foundation, in
1984; Secretary of State George
Shultz, on leave from the Stanford
Graduate School of Business, in
1983; and Supreme Court Justice
Sandra Day O'Connor, a Stanford
alumna, in 1982.

O'Neill traveled to New Orleans
for a speaking engagement yester
day and was unavailable for com
ment, but the scheduling secre
tary at his Boston office, Francine
Gannon, said O'Neill was "quite
honored" by the invitation.

Gannon said O'Neill has been
speaking two to three times a
week since retiring from Congress
and has been "inundated" with re
quests to speak at June gradua
tion ceremonies.
O'Neill, who received his bach
elor's degree from Boston College
in 1936, served for 16 years in the
Massachusetts House of Repre
sentatives before going to Wash
ington.
His only defeat in an election
came during his senior year in col
lege, when he ran for the
Cambridge City Council and lost
by 150 votes. The following fall, he
ran for the state house and won.

O'Neill's support in Cambridge
helped him win a close-fought
1952 campaign to succeed John
F. Kennedy as the district's U.S.
representative.
Recent Stanford Commence
ment speakers have included:
Stanford graduate Koppel last
year; New York Gov. Mario Cuomo
in 1985; former University Presi
dent Richard Lyman, president of
the Rockefeller Foundation, in
1984; Secretary of State George
Shultz, on leave from the Stanford
Graduate School of Business, in
1983; and Supreme Court Justice
Sandra Day O'Connor, a Stanford
alumna, in 1982.
Thomas "Tip" O'Neill, recently
retired speaker of the U.S. House
of Representatives, will be the
featured speaker at Stanford's
96th Commencement on June 14.
The Massachusetts Democrat,
who decided not to seek re
election in November after 34
years in the House, represented
the state's Bth District, which in
cludes Harvard, the Massachu
setts Institute of Technology and
20 other institutions of higher
education. O'Neill served as
speaker of the House for 10 years,
the longest continuous tenure in
the history of that position.
A consistent opponent of the
Reagan administration, O'Neill
earned a reputation for his
defense of liberal policies in a per
iod dominated by a conservative
swing in U.S. politics. Despite his
differences with the Reagan ad
ministration, however, public
policy polls repeatedly rated
O'Neill the second most influential
U.S. politician behind Reagan.
O'Neill's acceptance of the invi
tation was announced yesterday
by Acting University President
James Rosse, ending months of
secret deliberation by a committee
of students, faculty and staff as
sembled to draw up a list of candi

dates from which Rosse could
choose.
The speech will take place in
Stanford Stadium, which has
seated crowds estimated between
25,000 and 30,000 for graduation
ceremonies in recent years.
Members of the selection com
mittee said they were pleased with
the selection of O'Neill. No mem
ber would say, however, whether
O'Neill was Stanford's first choice
or if any other candidate had
turned down an offer.
Panel members said the Univer
sity was embarrassed last year
when the selection process was
publicized, revealing that Ted
Koppel, anchor of ABC television's
"Nightline," was not Stanford's
first choice.
Graduate student Kenneth War
ren, one of four students on the
selection committee, said O'Neill
was not a "clear-cut" choice. He
said the panel had originally
preferred a speaker with a back
ground in literature or the arts.
But committee members said
they had no regrets about select
ing the former politician.
"He's in a position of being en
gaged with current events, yet he
has lifted himself above political
partisanship," Warren said. "He
would not use the Commence
ment speech as a forum for
making a politically Interested ad
dress."
Committee member B.G. Porter,
one of the senior class presidents,
said O'Neill's appearance will not
associate Stanford with his politi
cal position. "He's much less of a
political figure now that he's out
of politics," Porter said. "Having
him doesn't make a particular po
litical statement by the Univer
sity."
The members of this year's se

lection committee also Included:
Norman Wessells, dean of
Humanities and Sciences; Robert
Freelen, vice president for public
affairs; Thomas Ambrogi, acting
dean of the chapel; Drama Prof.
Charles Lyons; Art Prof. Jody Max
min; senior Mary Obana; and
graduate student Carey Crutcher.
