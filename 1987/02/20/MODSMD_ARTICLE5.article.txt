# O'Neill to speak at graduation
## 
### MARK LAWRENCE Senior staff writer 
Thomas "Tip" O'Neill, recently
retired speaker of the U.S. House
of Representatives, will be the
featured speaker at Stanford's
96th Commencement on June 14.
The Massachusetts Democrat,
who decided not to seek re
election in November after 34
years in the House, represented
the state's Bth District, which in
cludes Harvard, the Massachu
setts Institute of Technology and
20 other institutions of higher
education. O'Neill served as
speaker of the House for 10 years,
the longest continuous tenure in
the history of that position.

ceremonies in recent years.
Members of the selection com

the selection of O'Neill. No mem
ber would say, however, whether
O'Neill was Stanford's first choice
or if any other candidate had
turned down an offer.
Panel members said the Univer
sity was embarrassed last year
when the selection process was
publicized, revealing that Ted
Koppel, anchor of ABC television's
"Nightline," was not Stanford's
first choice.
Graduate student Kenneth War
ren, one of four students on the
selection committee, said O'Neill
was not a "clear-cut" choice. He
said the panel had originally
preferred a speaker with a back
ground in literature or the arts.
But committee members said
they had no regrets about select
ing the former politician.
"He's in a position of being en
gaged with current events, yet he
has lifted himself above political
partisanship," Warren said. "He
