# Disagreements slow fraternities report
## 
### MARCUS MABRY Senior staff writer 
A final report from the Task
Force to Study Fraternities and
Sororities at Stanford has been
delayed for three years because of
discord between the task force's
chairman, Business School Prof.
Oscar Serbein, and its members,
according to Peter Sylvester, asso
ciate director of the Office of De
velopment and a task force mem
ber.
Sylvester said the process of
submitting the report has
"dragged on and on."
"There's a difference (of
opinion) between the chairman
and most of the committee. He
thinks he submitted the report,
but most of us wanted to make
some changes. The report as he
presented it ended up containing
a lot of things that we (the task
force) had never even discussed,"
he said.
The task force made public its
recommendations in June 1984
and disbanded immediately after,
according to Serbein.
Recommendations included

denying housing privileges to self
selective fraternal organizations,
calling for cooperation between
the University and the fraternities
and saying that fraternities
should be supported and guided,
but not housed. At the time of the
recommendations. Dean of Stu
dent Affairs James Lyons pre
dicted that he would release the
final report by the end of the fol
lowing fall quarter.
Almost three years later, the
task force's completed report has
not yet been published.
Fraternal Affairs Adviser Joe
Pisano called the amount of time
the report has taken an "em
harassment."
Lyons said he expects the final
report to be submitted to him in
about two weeks. "Once I get it, I'll
publish it,"he said.
Sylvester cited the chairman's
minority opinion as a further im
pediment to the completion of a
final report, stating that Serbein
"was kinder to some of the faults
of the fraternity system than the
majority of us were."
