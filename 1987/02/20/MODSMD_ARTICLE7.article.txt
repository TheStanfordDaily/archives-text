# Band history: Infamous past
## 
### SUSAN LINDHEIM Staff writer 
The sign above the door reads "Child Development
and Retardation Center." Walk through the door and
you have entered the Band Shak, home of the Leland
Stanford Junior University Marching Band
(LSJIJMB).
The inside is filled with signs, each having its own
unique history. The signs recall prominent, insignif
icant and somewhat forgotten moments of the
Band's notorious yet little known past.
The Band operates out of the Band Shak, located
on Galvez Steet. The current Shak was originally
built for steam plants. At one time, the building was
used as a ROTC firing range. The Band was given the
Shak when the ROTC moved off campus.
The original Band Shak was condemned, and in
1973 it was destroyed and burned. The "last rites"
for the building were attended by former Dean of Un
dergraduate Admissions Fred Hargadon and then-
University President Richard Lyman.
As for the signs that adorn the walls of the Shak,
Band alumnus Scott De√üarger said: "It's great to
keep putting up new and funny signs. It gives you a
new appreciation for signs in the real world."
