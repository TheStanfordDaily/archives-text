# Band history: Infamous past
## 
### SUSAN LINDHEIM Staff writer 
The sign above the door reads "Child Development
and Retardation Center." Walk through the door and
you have entered the Band Shak, home of the Leland
Stanford Junior University Marching Band
(LSJIJMB).
The inside is filled with signs, each having its own
unique history. The signs recall prominent, insignif
icant and somewhat forgotten moments of the
Band's notorious yet little known past.
The Band operates out of the Band Shak, located
on Galvez Steet. The current Shak was originally
built for steam plants. At one time, the building was
used as a ROTC firing range. The Band was given the
Shak when the ROTC moved off campus.
The original Band Shak was condemned, and in
1973 it was destroyed and burned. The "last rites"
for the building were attended by former Dean of Un
dergraduate Admissions Fred Hargadon and then-
University President Richard Lyman.
As for the signs that adorn the walls of the Shak,
Band alumnus Scott Deßarger said: "It's great to
keep putting up new and funny signs. It gives you a
new appreciation for signs in the real world."
The attitude that Inspires sign
stealing extends to everything,
continued Band archivist and his
torian Phil Cline. "Eveiy time you
go out In the real world the phrase
that comes to mind Is 'Wouldn't
that look good In the Shak?' "
During his year as archivist,
Cline, a senior, compiled a history
of the Band dating back to 1938.
when the Band first threatened to
strike. Cline spent the summer of
1985 working on the history. "The
more I got Into it, the more fasci
nating It was," he said.
Sign-stealing, like most of the
Band's pranks and traditions, is
not new. Some of the signs were
moved from the old Shak before it
was destroyed (or "grovelled" in
Band terminology), said Cline.
The Band's shows, formulated
currently late Monday nights by
Stanford Marching Unit Thinkers
(SMUT), have long been a source
of infamy and controversy. In
1966, the Band first began to scat
ter during its "Commercials"
show.
In 1975, the Band presented a
Patty Hearst show which included
the "Hearstburger" formation —
all buns and no "Patty."
The "Death of Mao" show in
1976 "managed to offend both
liberals and conservatives." ac
cording to Cline. And the Big
Game show of 1983 "apologizes
for all of the world's problems

except for The Play (when Stan
ford lost in the final seconds of the
1982 game as Band members
flooded onto the field.)"
Cline's history adds,"At the
same game, the Cal band and its
buses are mysteriously absent un
til the end of second quarter."
The buses, Cline explained, had
been delayed by the Stanford
Band manager who had accl
dently, in chartering buses for the
Big Game rally, discovered the
agency the Cal band was using for
Big Game.
"They (the buses) actually
weren't canceled, they were
delayed," said Cline. "But they
arrived In time to do their halftime
show."
During the 1982 USC game,
Band members dropped *1 bills
all over the field during its show so
that when the officials and foot
ball teams came back onto the
field, they needed to pick up the
money before they could play. For
this reason, Cline's history notes,
a USC player was "photographed
handing some money to referree."
The Band has also been educa
tional In its shows. The "Materials
Science Show" of 1982, the
brainchild of Band photographer
and materials science doctoral
student Robbie Beyers, was
shown annually as part of the in
troduction to Materials Science
Prof. Robert Sinclair's science of
materials course.
Sinclair announced the show,
parts of which demonstrated such
principals of material science as
matter in a liquid state coalescing

Into a crystal and the phenome
non of edge disorders. The final
formation had the Dollies,
representing photons, excite the
Band members, who represented
matter, to a higher state.
"It (the show) is the Band's con
tribution to Stanford's educa
tional process," said Deßarger.
According to the history. Dollies
first Joined the Band In the 19505,
when they were more yell-leaders
than dancers and when males
were also Included in the group. In
1963. after striking when Director
of Bands Julius Schuchat was
fired unexpectedly, the Band
became student-run and Arthur
Barnes was appointed director.
But radical changes In the
Band's behavior did not occur
simply because of the 1963 stu
dent takeover. "It's been an evolv
ing process for quite a long time,"
explained Deßarger.
There had actually been a long
history of student governance
before the takeover, Cline added.
"They (the students) just got a
little bit more control," he said.
The Band was the first college
band to fly to an away game (in
1949). Since then it has traveled
across the United States, having
rallied In Michigan, Pennsylvania,
Texas and Washington D.C. Band
members, however, waited for the
Queen Elizabeth II of England to
come to Stanford In 1983 before
they serenaded her.
Memorable Band road trips in
clude one in 1970 when, Cline
records, "The 'immortal 67'
hitchhike to (the) Arkansas game,

'drop trou' on national television
and receive telegram from Step
hen Stills thanking the Band for
playing his song."
In Colorado in 1977, Cline
records, "Colorado students bom
bard their own band with water
balloons after cheering LSJUMB."
The Band has not formally been
banned from television, although
most major networks "generally
make a policy not to show our
shows," said Deßarger.
The Band has not formally been
banned from airlines either, al
though there was an incident in
1982 when Band members stole
seat belts from a plane, grounding
the plane until the belts were
returned.
"We've flown on just about every
airline," said Cline."Basically we
look for the cheapest flight and
not the ones that will let us fly."
Airlines officials and networks
executives are not the only people

the Band has upset throughout
the years. The Band also gets alot
of unfavorable letters.
"We generally don't take hate
mail all that seriously," Deßarger
said, explaining that the Band
posts its hate mail in the Shak for
everyone to read. "If you write to
the Band, people will read your let
ters,"he said.
Letters responding to the
Band's recent suspension varied
widely. "I hope the Administration
dissolves your gang of idiots called
a Band. We don't need a bunch of
slime bag bastards performin' in
public," one said. The Princeton
University Band, however, con
gratulated the band on "a job well
done."
In compiling the history, Cline
noticed many patterns. He said
the Band has been performing
similar shows and similar pranks,
and receiving similar complaints
for quite a while.

For example, the charges voiced
against the Band during last
year's suspension were similar to
those of 1977-78 when the Univer
sity and the public complained
about "boring, repetitive and of
fensive shows," Cline said. As a
result of the recent suspension,
the Band drafted a charter for it
self that proposed restrictions for
alcohol use and reforms In the
show-formulating process
(SMUT).
The Band differs from season to
season. In the spring, when there
are only rallies and baseball games
to attend, anyone can play,
regardless of ability. Many people
who join in the spring continue in
the fall when the Band swells to its
largest consistent membership of
roughly 150. "Red Vest," the win
ter band, is smaller (about 40) and
consists of more able and dedi
cated musicians.

Band's notorious yet little known past.
The Band operates out of the Band Shak, located
on Galvez Steet. The current Shak was originally
built for steam plants. At one time, the building was
used as a ROTC firing range. The Band was given the
Shak when the ROTC moved off campus.
The original Band Shak was condemned, and in

moved from the old Shak before it
was destroyed (or "grovelled" in
Band terminology), said Cline.
The Band's shows, formulated
currently late Monday nights by
Stanford Marching Unit Thinkers
(SMUT), have long been a source
of infamy and controversy. In
1966, the Band first began to scat
ter during its "Commercials"
show.
In 1975, the Band presented a
Patty Hearst show which included
the "Hearstburger" formation —
all buns and no "Patty."
The "Death of Mao" show in
1976 "managed to offend both
liberals and conservatives." ac
cording to Cline. And the Big
Game show of 1983 "apologizes
for all of the world's problems

except for The Play (when Stan

1982 game as Band members
flooded onto the field.)"
Cline's history adds,"At the
same game, the Cal band and its

The buses, Cline explained, had
been delayed by the Stanford
Band manager who had accl
dently, in chartering buses for the
Big Game rally, discovered the
agency the Cal band was using for
Big Game.
"They (the buses) actually
weren't canceled, they were

brainchild of Band photographer
and materials science doctoral

shown annually as part of the in

Prof. Robert Sinclair's science of

Sinclair announced the show,
parts of which demonstrated such
principals of material science as
matter in a liquid state coalescing

Into a crystal and the phenome

formation had the Dollies,
representing photons, excite the
Band members, who represented
matter, to a higher state.
"It (the show) is the Band's con

According to the history. Dollies
first Joined the Band In the 19505,
when they were more yell-leaders

1963. after striking when Director
of Bands Julius Schuchat was

became student-run and Arthur
Barnes was appointed director.
But radical changes In the
Band's behavior did not occur
simply because of the 1963 stu

explained Deßarger.
There had actually been a long
history of student governance
before the takeover, Cline added.
"They (the students) just got a
little bit more control," he said.
The Band was the first college
band to fly to an away game (in
1949). Since then it has traveled
across the United States, having
rallied In Michigan, Pennsylvania,
Texas and Washington D.C. Band
members, however, waited for the
Queen Elizabeth II of England to
come to Stanford In 1983 before
they serenaded her.
Memorable Band road trips in
clude one in 1970 when, Cline
records, "The 'immortal 67'
hitchhike to (the) Arkansas game,

'drop trou' on national television
and receive telegram from Step
hen Stills thanking the Band for
playing his song."
In Colorado in 1977, Cline
records, "Colorado students bom
bard their own band with water
balloons after cheering LSJUMB."
The Band has not formally been
banned from television, although
most major networks "generally
make a policy not to show our
shows," said Deßarger.
The Band has not formally been
banned from airlines either, al
though there was an incident in
1982 when Band members stole
seat belts from a plane, grounding
the plane until the belts were
returned.
"We've flown on just about every

formation had the Dollies,
representing photons, excite the
Band members, who represented
matter, to a higher state.
"It (the show) is the Band's con
tribution to Stanford's educa
tional process," said Deßarger.
According to the history. Dollies
first Joined the Band In the 19505,
when they were more yell-leaders
than dancers and when males
were also Included in the group. In
1963. after striking when Director
of Bands Julius Schuchat was
fired unexpectedly, the Band
became student-run and Arthur
Barnes was appointed director.
But radical changes In the
Band's behavior did not occur
simply because of the 1963 stu
dent takeover. "It's been an evolv
ing process for quite a long time,"
explained Deßarger.
There had actually been a long
history of student governance
before the takeover, Cline added.
"They (the students) just got a
little bit more control," he said.
The Band was the first college
band to fly to an away game (in
1949). Since then it has traveled
across the United States, having
rallied In Michigan, Pennsylvania,
Texas and Washington D.C. Band
members, however, waited for the
Queen Elizabeth II of England to
come to Stanford In 1983 before
they serenaded her.
Memorable Band road trips in
clude one in 1970 when, Cline
records, "The 'immortal 67'
hitchhike to (the) Arkansas game,

'drop trou' on national television
and receive telegram from Step
hen Stills thanking the Band for
playing his song."
In Colorado in 1977, Cline
records, "Colorado students bom
bard their own band with water
balloons after cheering LSJUMB."
The Band has not formally been
banned from television, although
most major networks "generally
make a policy not to show our
shows," said Deßarger.
The Band has not formally been
banned from airlines either, al
though there was an incident in
1982 when Band members stole
seat belts from a plane, grounding
the plane until the belts were
returned.
"We've flown on just about every
airline," said Cline."Basically we
look for the cheapest flight and
not the ones that will let us fly."
Airlines officials and networks
executives are not the only people

the Band has upset throughout
the years. The Band also gets alot
of unfavorable letters.
"We generally don't take hate
mail all that seriously," Deßarger
said, explaining that the Band
posts its hate mail in the Shak for
everyone to read. "If you write to
the Band, people will read your let
ters,"he said.
Letters responding to the
Band's recent suspension varied
widely. "I hope the Administration
dissolves your gang of idiots called
a Band. We don't need a bunch of
slime bag bastards performin' in
public," one said. The Princeton
University Band, however, con
gratulated the band on "a job well
done."
In compiling the history, Cline
noticed many patterns. He said
the Band has been performing
similar shows and similar pranks,
and receiving similar complaints
for quite a while.

For example, the charges voiced
against the Band during last
year's suspension were similar to
those of 1977-78 when the Univer
sity and the public complained
about "boring, repetitive and of
fensive shows," Cline said. As a
result of the recent suspension,
the Band drafted a charter for it
self that proposed restrictions for
alcohol use and reforms In the
show-formulating process
(SMUT).
The Band differs from season to
season. In the spring, when there
are only rallies and baseball games
to attend, anyone can play,
regardless of ability. Many people
who join in the spring continue in
the fall when the Band swells to its
largest consistent membership of
roughly 150. "Red Vest," the win
ter band, is smaller (about 40) and
consists of more able and dedi
cated musicians.
