State Dept. tried to prevent attack
WASHINGTON — The State Department took extraordinary
steps in the summer of 1985, including summoning the U.S. am
bassador to Egypt home on a secret weekend mission, to head off
a White House-sponsored plan for a joint U.S.-Egyptian military
attack on Libya, according to Informed sources.
Libya, under the radical leadership of Moammar Khadafi, has
been an urgent concern, some say an obsession, in the White
House throughout the Reagan administration. President
Reagan's Initial meeting with his National Security Council on his
first full day in office. Jan. 21, 1981, focused on Libya and Iran.
In mid-1985, emboldened by Reagan's overwhelming re-election
and frustrated by four years of Indecisive struggle against Khadafi
through covert actions and unconventional means, senior figures
in the White House and Central Intelligence Agency called for a
direct military confrontation.
The Joint Chiefs of Staff, in a study apparently Intended to
dampen White House enthusiasm for an invasion plan, estimated
that an operation in Libya on the scale being envisioned could
eventually require six U.S. combat divisions, about 90,000 troops.
Such a force, which is about 15 times greater than that employed
in the 1983 U.S. Invasion of Grenada, would have required a
major diversion of U.S. forces from NATO.
North passed secret data to Iran
WASHINGTON - Lt. Col. Oliver North, the fired National Secur
ity Council staff aide in the Iran-contra affair, gave Iran top-secret
intelligence information that was not supposed to be shared with
foreigners, according to messages that investigators have
retrieved from the NSC computer system that were described by
informed sources yesterday.
President Reagan authorized limited sharing of intelligence
with Iran when he secretly approved selling arms to Tehran on
Jan. 17, 1986. But two sources said the evidence in the computer
messages disclosed that North passed data from secret and top
secret intelligence that was designated "NOFORN," meaning it
was not to be seen by any foreign national.
A senior official said yesterday that North's "free-lance"
Intelligence-sharing, designed to win the release of American
hostages being held in Lebanon and build credibility with
Iranians, may turn out to be a "nightmare," demonstrating that
the administration was operating at cross-purposes.
Scientists locate Alzheimer's gene
WASHINGTON — Researchers yesterday reported several critical
findings about Alzheimer's diseast that experts believe could help
lead to the discovery of its cause.
In scientific journal articles published this week, different
groups of researchers said they have found the location of a gene
that causes one form of the disease.
At the same time, they reported that they have isolated a genetic
substance that causes some of the brain damage which is charac
teristic of Alzheimer's disease.
The findings are considered among the most important in the
recent history of Alzheimer's research because they significantly
narrow the huge genetic field scientists have been combing in
search of a trigger for the disease. Experts stressed that it could
take some time, possibly years, to actually find the cause.
Previous studies have shown that one of the identifying
signatures"of tJile di&gase is a defective protein called amyloid.
Amyloids are like clumps of debris which form and cause damage
to brain cells characteristic of Alzheimer's.
In another finding reported yesterday, researchers said they
now have isolated the gene that directs the manufacture of the
suspect protein.
Panel attacks treaty policy
WASHINGTON — Senate Foreign Relations Committee delibera
tions on arms control got a wobbly start yesterday as the panel's
new Democratic chairman issued a scathing Indictment of
"disarray" in President Reagan's conduct of foreign policy and
called on Democrats to take the lead In restoring order.
Frustrated by weeks of inconclusive negotiations with the White
House, the committee voted to clear the way for Senate action on
two long-pending nuclear test-ban treaties. It also attached
verification requirements requested by the White House and
opposed by some Democrats.
The treaties are the Threshold Test Ban Treaty of 1974 and the
Peaceful Nuclear Explosions Treaty of 1976. which would limit
U.S. and Soviet underground nuclear tests to no more than 150
kilotons. the equivalent of 150,000 tons of TNT.
Beirut quiets after 180 killed
BEIRUT, Lebanon — Scattered but persistent combat and a fer
vent call to arms by Shlite leader Nabih Berrl to counter a Druze
leftist alliance yesterday weakened prospects that a shaky Syrian
backed truce to end the week-long battle for control of Moslem
west Beirut would last.
The four days of street fighting — the most intense here in four
years — has left 180 people dead and more than 350 wounded, ac
cording to police.
The intensity of combat subsided as a joint security unit of 200
Syrian special forces. 200 Lebanese Army soldiers and policemen
and a 100-man Shiite-Druze militia set up disengagement points
in contested neighborhoods shortly after midnight. But edgy gun
men still held positions on the ravaged streets.
Druze and Lebanese Communist Party fighters, joined by the
remnants of a Sunnl Moslem fighting force, continued to nibble at
Shlite Amal strongholds hours after Syrian military intelligence
chief Brig. Ghazi Kanaan asked combatants to withdraw from the
streets.
The main fighting yesterday was in the Abu Chaker quarter, a
poor Moslem square linking the strategic Corniche Mazraa avenue
to the Arab University, near the Palestinian refugee camps of
Sabra and Shatila.
U.S. report admonishes S. Africa
WASHINGTON — The Reagan administration, releasing its an
nual report yesterday on human rights worldwide, singled out a
"sharp deterioration" of conditions in South Africa as the worst
development in human rights last year.
Richard Schifter, assistant secretary of state for human rights,
traced the source of the problem to the June 12 declaration of a
state of emergency last year by the white-minority government In
Pretoria. In briefing reporters on the 1.356-page report, he said
that South African whites appear to have chosen "a self
destructive course" in dealing with racial conflict.
Congressional critics and human rights organizations faulted
the Reagan administration for portraying the report as an impar
tial tool aimed at promoting human rights. They charged that the
report showed lenience toward governments favored by Washing
ton. reserving the heaviest fire for regimes antagonistic to the
United States.
Jerome Shestack. president of the International League of
Human Rights, credited the administration with some improve
ment in Its policies and praised Schifter as a "positive force" for
change. However, in his testimony. Shestack scored the sale of
arms to Iran, asserting that America "has not only assisted a
country that has one of the most horrendous and abhorrent of
human rights records but also one that has made terrorism a
state policy."

The main fighting yesterday was in the Abu Chaker quarter, a
poor Moslem square linking the strategic Corniche Mazraa avenue
to the Arab University, near the Palestinian refugee camps of
Sabra and Shatila.
U.S. report admonishes S. Africa
WASHINGTON — The Reagan administration, releasing its an
nual report yesterday on human rights worldwide, singled out a
"sharp deterioration" of conditions in South Africa as the worst
development in human rights last year.
Richard Schifter, assistant secretary of state for human rights,
traced the source of the problem to the June 12 declaration of a
state of emergency last year by the white-minority government In
Pretoria. In briefing reporters on the 1.356-page report, he said
that South African whites appear to have chosen "a self
destructive course" in dealing with racial conflict.
Congressional critics and human rights organizations faulted
the Reagan administration for portraying the report as an impar
tial tool aimed at promoting human rights. They charged that the
report showed lenience toward governments favored by Washing
ton. reserving the heaviest fire for regimes antagonistic to the
United States.
Jerome Shestack. president of the International League of
Human Rights, credited the administration with some improve
ment in Its policies and praised Schifter as a "positive force" for
change. However, in his testimony. Shestack scored the sale of
arms to Iran, asserting that America "has not only assisted a
country that has one of the most horrendous and abhorrent of
human rights records but also one that has made terrorism a
state policy."

State Dept. tried to prevent attack
WASHINGTON — The State Department took extraordinary
steps in the summer of 1985, including summoning the U.S. am
bassador to Egypt home on a secret weekend mission, to head off
a White House-sponsored plan for a joint U.S.-Egyptian military
attack on Libya, according to Informed sources.
Libya, under the radical leadership of Moammar Khadafi, has
been an urgent concern, some say an obsession, in the White
House throughout the Reagan administration. President
Reagan's Initial meeting with his National Security Council on his
first full day in office. Jan. 21, 1981, focused on Libya and Iran.
In mid-1985, emboldened by Reagan's overwhelming re-election
and frustrated by four years of Indecisive struggle against Khadafi
through covert actions and unconventional means, senior figures
in the White House and Central Intelligence Agency called for a
direct military confrontation.
The Joint Chiefs of Staff, in a study apparently Intended to
dampen White House enthusiasm for an invasion plan, estimated
that an operation in Libya on the scale being envisioned could
eventually require six U.S. combat divisions, about 90,000 troops.
Such a force, which is about 15 times greater than that employed
in the 1983 U.S. Invasion of Grenada, would have required a
major diversion of U.S. forces from NATO.
North passed secret data to Iran
WASHINGTON - Lt. Col. Oliver North, the fired National Secur
ity Council staff aide in the Iran-contra affair, gave Iran top-secret
intelligence information that was not supposed to be shared with
foreigners, according to messages that investigators have
retrieved from the NSC computer system that were described by
informed sources yesterday.
President Reagan authorized limited sharing of intelligence
with Iran when he secretly approved selling arms to Tehran on
Jan. 17, 1986. But two sources said the evidence in the computer
messages disclosed that North passed data from secret and top
secret intelligence that was designated "NOFORN," meaning it
was not to be seen by any foreign national.
A senior official said yesterday that North's "free-lance"
Intelligence-sharing, designed to win the release of American
hostages being held in Lebanon and build credibility with
Iranians, may turn out to be a "nightmare," demonstrating that
the administration was operating at cross-purposes.
Scientists locate Alzheimer's gene
WASHINGTON — Researchers yesterday reported several critical
findings about Alzheimer's diseast that experts believe could help
lead to the discovery of its cause.
In scientific journal articles published this week, different
groups of researchers said they have found the location of a gene
that causes one form of the disease.
At the same time, they reported that they have isolated a genetic
substance that causes some of the brain damage which is charac
teristic of Alzheimer's disease.
The findings are considered among the most important in the
recent history of Alzheimer's research because they significantly
narrow the huge genetic field scientists have been combing in
search of a trigger for the disease. Experts stressed that it could
take some time, possibly years, to actually find the cause.
Previous studies have shown that one of the identifying
signatures"of tJile di&gase is a defective protein called amyloid.
Amyloids are like clumps of debris which form and cause damage
to brain cells characteristic of Alzheimer's.
In another finding reported yesterday, researchers said they
now have isolated the gene that directs the manufacture of the
suspect protein.
Panel attacks treaty policy
WASHINGTON — Senate Foreign Relations Committee delibera
tions on arms control got a wobbly start yesterday as the panel's
new Democratic chairman issued a scathing Indictment of
"disarray" in President Reagan's conduct of foreign policy and
called on Democrats to take the lead In restoring order.
Frustrated by weeks of inconclusive negotiations with the White
House, the committee voted to clear the way for Senate action on
two long-pending nuclear test-ban treaties. It also attached
verification requirements requested by the White House and
opposed by some Democrats.
The treaties are the Threshold Test Ban Treaty of 1974 and the
Peaceful Nuclear Explosions Treaty of 1976. which would limit
U.S. and Soviet underground nuclear tests to no more than 150
kilotons. the equivalent of 150,000 tons of TNT.
Beirut quiets after 180 killed
BEIRUT, Lebanon — Scattered but persistent combat and a fer
vent call to arms by Shlite leader Nabih Berrl to counter a Druze
leftist alliance yesterday weakened prospects that a shaky Syrian
backed truce to end the week-long battle for control of Moslem
west Beirut would last.
The four days of street fighting — the most intense here in four
years — has left 180 people dead and more than 350 wounded, ac
cording to police.
The intensity of combat subsided as a joint security unit of 200
Syrian special forces. 200 Lebanese Army soldiers and policemen
and a 100-man Shiite-Druze militia set up disengagement points
in contested neighborhoods shortly after midnight. But edgy gun
men still held positions on the ravaged streets.
Druze and Lebanese Communist Party fighters, joined by the
remnants of a Sunnl Moslem fighting force, continued to nibble at
Shlite Amal strongholds hours after Syrian military intelligence
chief Brig. Ghazi Kanaan asked combatants to withdraw from the
streets.
The main fighting yesterday was in the Abu Chaker quarter, a
poor Moslem square linking the strategic Corniche Mazraa avenue
to the Arab University, near the Palestinian refugee camps of
