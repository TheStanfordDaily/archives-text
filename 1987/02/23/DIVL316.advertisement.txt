THEY SAVE LIVES.
YOU SAVE FACE.
Let's face it: AIDS is a killer. Unless you abstain completely,
sex can be just plain dangerous. There is hope for the sex
ually active, however. The Surgeon General has stated that
the proper use of condoms greatly reduces your risk. It's the
only method of birth control that does.
Unfortunately, it can be very embarrassing to purchase con
doms in over-the-counter situations. So embarrassing, in
fact, that many people find themselves unable to make
public purchases. Fortunately, there is an alternative.
Safe Sets offers innovative Mentor Condoms with Safety-Seal.
Feeling? In a test conducted by a major men's health maga
zine, Mentor rated best:"lt's so thin...it's almost un
noticeable. Feels almost as good as nothing at all."
Sure, Mentors cost a bit more. Sometimes frugality is not
worth the risk. Stores sell 3 Mentors for $8 and 6 for $15.
Safe Sets sells 3 for $6 + $1 tax/shp. and 6 for $10 + $1.65.
Take advantage of the convenience, savings and privacy of
discreet mail delivery. You save not only time and money,
you also save face. So if you're sexually active, use con
doms. Don't be foolish. Don't be intimidated out of buying
something you want and need. Don't die of embarrassment.
