# Ferruolo asks for answers
## 
### MARK LAWRENCE Senior staff writer 
History Asst. Prof. Stephen Fer
ruolo, who last week lost a second
bid for tenure, has requested a
written explanation of the History
Department's decision from Act
ing University Provost Robert
Street.
Ferruolo said he will wait for
Street's letter before deciding
whether to continue a grievance
he filed last May in protest of the
department's first decision.
Ferruolo called the History De
partment's more recent decision,
a vote of the tenured members of
the department, "extremely ir
responsible" and "outrageous,"
but he said he is unsure on what
grounds he would base a con
tinuation of the grievance.
"I have not firmly decided to do
so," Ferruolo said. "But it is likely
I will continue with my grievance,
and I will pursue my grievance
within the University all the way
up to the level of president."
Ferruolo said one possibility
would be to continue the griev
ance on the grounds that the
second vote was "not a fair recon
sideration" because it was
"prejudiced" by the first denial.
The provost's memorandum
may provide information that will
help Ferruolo decide how to
pursue the grievance, he said.
When Street receives a
memorandum from History De
partment Chairman James
Sheehan detailing the reasons for
the department's decision. Street
will write the letter to Ferruolo,
giving a general summary of the
reasons for the denial, according
to Noel Kolak. assistant provost
for faculty affairs. Sheehan was
out of town this weekend and un
available for comment.
Street's letter will be written as a
summary rather than a detailed
account of the department's
deliberations in order to protect
the confidentiality of statements
made by history professors in con
sidering Ferruolo's candidacy,
Kolak said. She said Ferruolo
should receive Street's memoran
dum within two weeks.
A request for such an ex
planatory memorandum is a stan
dard option, outlined in the Fac
ulty Handbook, for professors who
have been denied tenure.
Although such a request is not
part of the formal grievance
process, Kolak said Ferruolo's
move is a "logical first action" if he
wants to continue his grievance.
Ferruolo said, however, that he
does not expect Street's memoran
dum to provide much insight into
the History Department's deci
sion.
"It will give me something, but
- if it's consistent with the kind
of memo I got last year — not very
much," Ferruolo said. "What it
simply does is take sentences out
of the letter (from Sheehan) out of
context and piles them one on top
of the other."
Ferruolo said department fac
ulty members provided him with a
fairly detailed account of the

reasons for his denial last year.
But because of the legal case of
former visiting History Prof. Nor
man Davies, who sued 31 mem
bers of the department after he
was denied a tenured position last
year, professors will not discuss
tenure decisions at all. Ferruolo
said.
After he lost the first vote. Fer
ruolo lodged a grievance and won
a new hearing because a grievance
officer. Emeritus Political Science
Prof. Gabriel Almond, found that
new criteria forjudging the schol
arship of a tenure candidate had
been improperly applied when the
department evaluated Ferruolo.
