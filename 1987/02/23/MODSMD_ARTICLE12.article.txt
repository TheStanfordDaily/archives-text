### 
A recent student-Initiated plan to provide
rides for students too drunk to drive is an
idea whose time is long overdue.
Organized by a group of Sigma Chi frater
nity members, the service will make volun
teer drivers available to students who are not
sober enough to drive home from campus
parties or local drinking establishments.
The ride program, scheduled to begin on a
trial basis next quarter, addresses the
growing problem of drunk driving on the
Stanford campus. According to figures pro
vided by Stanford Police Chief Marvin Her
rington. campus arrests for drunk driving
over the last five years have averaged 105 per
year— compared to less than 50 in any one
year before 1982.
Because of Stanford's somewhat isolated
location, students who want to visit bars and
other off-campus nightspots have virtually
no choice but to drive — and it is un
avoidable that some of them drive drunk.
Although it will be limited initially to three
nights a week and a five-mile radius around
campus, the planned ride program clearly
has the potential to save lives.
The key to the program's effectiveness,

however, will be the willingness of students
to use it. Hopefully, the option of a free and
convenient campus ride service will induce
students not to run the deadly risk of driving
drunk.
Not only do drunk drivers endanger their
own lives, they also threaten the lives of inno
cent motorists and pedestrians. Getting
caught behind the wheel while intoxicated
can also mean up to six months in prison, a
fine of up to $500 and a revoked license.
The Sigma Chis should be commended for
initiating this much needed service. It is also
encouraging that the Office of Student Af
fairs, the Stanford police and the Interfrater
nity Council have stepped forward to fund
the program through the end of spring quar
ter.
Unfortunately, if the ride service is to
survive into next year, more permanent fin
ancial support is needed.
Organizers plan to place a fee assessment
on the spring ASSU election ballot. For the
welfare of the community, as well as their
own safety, Stanford students should vote
the Sigma Chi ride program whatever fund
ing it requires.
