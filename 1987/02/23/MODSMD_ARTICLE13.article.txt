# No more 55 mph speed limit
## 
### 
The 100 th Congress has an opportunity to
pass a bill that would be the greatest ac
complishment since the repeal of prohibition.
The 99th Congress came close, but failed to
agree on the details. Before the national mood
changes, let's hope our lawmakers move
quickly to repeal the 55 mph national speed
limit â€” a burdensome remnant of the Carter
and Nixon administrations. The federally
mandated 55 mph limit is oppressive, un
necessary and inappropriate. It should be
repealed and individual states should decide
whether or not to raise their speed limits.

Congress passed the Emergency Highway
Energy Conservation Act in 1973, following
the Arab oil embargo, as a temporary fuel con
servation measure. It set the national speed
limit at 55 mph. The effort was more symbolic
than effective, since the amount of fuel saved
by lowering the speed limit on a few roads is
negligible. Often, when a corporation wants to
cut costs, it starts with office supplies and
Xerox expenses, which have a minimal effect
but inconvenience everybody. The result of
passing this act was the same. It made almost
as much sense as wearing WIN (Whip Inflation
Now) buttons.
Unfortunately, amendments in 1974 made
this temporary emergency legislation perman
ent and the American people have been stuck
with an unreasonable, unenforceable speed
limit ever since. Even when civil disobedience
and lawlessness on the highways reached
mammoth proportions, the government
refused to relent. In fact, the 1981 Omnibus
Budget Reconciliation Act established a man
datory compliance criteria of 50 percent. Fail
ure to meet the prescribed standard results in
loss of federal funds. Arizona and Vermont
have already been targeted. There is some
thing fundamentally wrong with a law where
the desired compliance standard is only 50
percent. Fortunately, the standards for rape
and murder are a bit lower.
Americans are not unreasonable people. If a
law makes sense, they generally obey it. A Na

tional Academy of Sciences (NAS) study con
cluded that 75.4 percent of the drivers on rural
interstates exceed the speed limit. Rates of 85
percent were recorded in at least eight states.
With this high percentage of scofflaws, en
forcement is sporadic at best. You have to ask
yourself, "Do I feel lucky today? They can't
catch us all." This attitude often results in vio
lations of other traffic laws as well. Some offi
cers will grant five to 10 mph over the limit.
Others will not. Nobody knows what the stan
dard really is. It is best to get behind a truck
and take your chances.
Some states have rebelled. Montana has
lowered the fine for exceeding the speed limit
by less than 15 mph to *5. Federal crackdown
on lax enforcement, however, has resulted in
disproportionate resources being allocated to
prevent loss of highway funds. The California
Highway Patrol testified that the 55 mph speed
limit costs the state an extra *3 million per
year to enforce. Furthermore, many officers
who would ordinarily be watching for drunk
drivers as the bars close are on the freeways at
10 a.m. ticketing speeders.
The arguments for keeping the speed limit at
55 mph are: It saves lives; it conserves energy;
and a 65 mph speed limit will mean people will
drive 75 to 80 mph. Certainly some lives are
saved by lowering the speed limit. If we lower
the speed limit to 30 mph, we will save even
more lives. There is a point where this logic
becomes ridiculous. Unfortunately, we are
already there.
Many lives have been saved on the highways
over the past decade. While some may be at
tributed to a reduced speed limit, many lives
were saved by increased use of seat belts, bet
ter cars, stronger guard rails, safer bridge
abutments and the campaign against drunk
driving. Hundreds of miles of interstates are
built each year. This helps by moving traffic
from older single-lane roads to four-lane high
ways where the cars are all moving in the same
direction.
The 55 mph law was emergency legislation
during an energy crisis. While conservation is
still a goal, the crisis is over and the draconian
restrictions should be lifted. The NAS study
also concluded that one billion hours per year
are lost due to additional travel time. Even if
you value everybody's time at the minimum
wage, it comes to an exorbitant sum. If conser
vation is the issue, how about conservation of
people's time?

For those who argue that drivers will travel
75 to 80 mph if the law is changed, history
does not agree. When the speed limit was 70
mph, there was no worry about a 50 percent
compliance rate and 75 percent of the popu
tion was not breaking the law.
The bills before Congress propose allowing
individual states to raise the speed limit to 65
mph on rural interstates. Rural interstates are
defined as being outside urban areas of 50,000
people or more. The measure applies to only 6
percent of the roads where a 55 mph speed
limit is now posted and includes the safest
roads in the nation. Nevertheless, opponents
still exist.
The interstate highways were designed for
70 mph and are safe at that speed. Many high
way engineers use the "85th percentile rule" to
define a reasonable speed limit for a road. This
is the speed at or below which 85 percent of the
vehicles should travel. At this speed, driver
comfort is enhanced, speed variance is
reduced and traffic safety is improved. Thirty
seven states reported the 85th percentile at or
greater than 65 mph for their rural interstates.
Federal laws should address issues where
conditions are uniform throughout the
country. Highways are not in this category.
The crowded, pothole-infested roads of New
York or New Jersey are vastly different than the
sparsely traveled roads of New Mexico or
Kansas. Weather, topography, level of mainte
nance. traffic congestion, quality of roads and
local attitudes vary greatly around the country
Anyone who has driven across the Mojave des
ert knows the futility of a 55 mph speed limit.
The states showed a great deal of innovation
and common sense when they were respon
sible for their own speed limits. Some states
had lower speed limits at night than in
daylight. No state was irresponsible. If individ
ual states can decide critical highway safety is
sues such as motorcycle helmet laws, they
should also be allowed to choose their own
speed limits.
President Reagan supports relaxing the
speed limit and giving the authority back to
the states. Hopefully, the new Congress will
agree on a measure that is reasonable and en
forceable. The crisis that precipitated this law
has passed and the 55 mph speed limit should
have been repealed a long time ago.
