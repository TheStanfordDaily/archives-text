Killing can be
justifiable
There are moral reasons for
opposing capital punishment,
but Lowell Ungar does not artic
ulate them in his recent view
point (Daily, Feb. 10). Ungar's
central thesis — that the killing
of any human being by another is
always wrong — should be ques
tioned.
Do we really condemn — and
condemn with equal vehemence
— the Arab terrorists who killed
innocent bystanders in the Rome
and Vienna airports in December
1985 and the Israeli security
guards who killed some of the
terrorists? Is there no moral dif
ference between killing for
publicity (or pleasure or economic
gain) and killing in self-defense?
For Ungar. there is no differ
ence. For him. the right to life is
guaranteed to an individual
regardless of his pain.
In the movie "Aliens." a woman
who is about to die in a most
excruciating way pleads with her
rescuer to kill her. Do we really
want to condemn this woman, or
her killer? I think not. Ungar's

argument, however, compels us
to refrain from killing even when
killing is the most humane action
conceivable. Ironically, not killing
a person who is suffering in such
a situation could be considered a
form of cruelty.
The death penalty may need to
be abolished because of the prac
tical difficulties of administering
it fairly, but not because all kil
ling is wrong. In some circum
stances killing is both justifiable
and just.

Dean of Humanities and

recently made this statement:
"Stanford could be the best uni
versity in the world — but it's
not. And won't be until the
humanities are stronger." The
Daily opened the discussion
about the status of the
humanities at Stanford in a
recent article (Daily. Feb. 13).
Although it has several distin

guished departments in the
humanities. Stanford is usually
identified with science and engi
neering. Due to its proximity to
Silicon Valley, which it helped to
create, this image has become a
stereotype.
University President Donald
Kennedy and his administration
were well aware of this fact when
they made a strong commitment
to foster and strengthen the
humanities at Stanford. There
were indeed some spectacular
developments: the creation of the
Humanities Center; the in
auguration of Jewish Studies,
with the acquisition of the Taube-
Baron Collection; and major ap
pointments In Italian. French and
Slavic languages, among others.
But the outlook is not all that
bright. One has to register the
loss of the eminent historian
Peter Paret to Princeton's In
stitute of Advanced Study, to
gether with the retirement of
historians Gordon Craig and
Gordon Wright. Assoc. Profs, of
German Studies David Wellbery
and Russell Berman took on as
signments in Comparative
Literature and Modern Thought.

respectively. This will weaken a
traditionally strong department.
Peace studies has been carried on
for some years only by the engage
ment of some faculty members,
and is still lacking major support.
Plans are underway to close the
Vienna program; Florence is in
doubt. And the library, the
"laboratory for the humanities."
faces cuts year after year.
Acknowledging how dangerous
a purely technocratic and
materialistic view has become,
the philosopher Odo Marquard
recently stated. "The more
modern the modern world
becomes, the more necessary the
humanities will become." Stan
ford should spearhead develop
ment of the humanities in the
same innovative spirit it has
shown in the sciences. Major
appointments in traditional and
new fields of the humanities will
be necessary, as well as contin
uous strengthening of the hold
ings of the library.
The Centennial then will see. if
not "the best university in the
world." certainly one of the best.
