# Disclose truth
## 
### 
I don't claim to be a big fan of
History Prof. Stephen Ferruolo. Al
though I've heard some positive
comments about him, I don't
know him well enough to make
any judgment on his teaching
skills and scholarship. I just want
to know why he was denied ten
ure, for the tenure decision
seemed to come out of nowhere.
Personally, I just can't accept an
argument like the one presented
in a recent editorial (Daily, Feb.
17). It stated that the
"confidentiality of the tenure
review process, frustrating as it
may be, is more important than
the career of any single professor."
Really? If that single professor
demonstrates enthusiasm for
teaching and has the potential to
make a major contribution to his
or her field of study, is the con
fidentiality of the tenure review
process more important than the
loss of the able scholar?

The editorial also added:
"Ferruolo's own colleagues are bet
ter judges of his qualifications for
a tenured position than anyone
else." What about his students?
Ferruolo's colleagues might know
more about his quality of scholar
ship than anyone else, but
wouldn't his students know more
about his teaching skills than his
colleagues? After all. his students
face the professor on a day-to-day
basis. If the students can't be
given a voice in the tenure review
process, shouldn't they have the
right to know about his qualifica
tions and the reasons behind the
tenure decision at the very least?
Furthermore, I just can't under
stand why tenured professors
would be unwilling to open up the
review process in the first place. If
they are true scholars, shouldn't
they be able to state their opinions
and take full responsibility for
their views? Why would they be
unwilling to let their views be
known to the public?
For instance, in the case involv
ing Norman Davies, a former visit
ing professor of history, why did
History Prof. Hal Kahn resort to a
privacy request and deny Davies
access to Kahn's statements
during the tenure review proceed

ings? What was Kahn afraid of?
As for the Ferruolo case, was
there any good reason for denying
him tenure? According to The
Daily, "his teaching was hailed as
'fantastic, above question' " and
"the committee reviewing Fer
ruolo's case unanimously recom
mended that he be granted ten
ure." Did Ferruolo's colleagues feel
he did not deserve all those ac
claims? Or did some kind of
"entrenched gerontocracy" in the
History Department just decide to
spoil the career of a young scholar
because it couldn't stomach the
notion of a young professor get
ting tenure?
Although the editorial argued
that the review process remains
"valid and fair," the confiden
tiality of the tenure review process
only seems to breed guesses and
rumors, and raises doubts about
the fairness of the decision itself.
I, for one, would rather deal with
harsh truths than silence. If there
were indeed some valid criticisms
directed against Ferruolo and
Davies, let them know what their
shortcomings were, so that they
can improve their scholarship and
become truly great scholars. On
the other hand, if they were
denied tenure on
grounds, the tenure review
process must be reformed. Above
all, whatever went on during the
proceedings must be revealed. If
scholars can't defend their views
and instead try to hide them from
the public, is the difference be
tween a scholar and a backstabber
really a difference in kind?
In a certain sense, it is espe
cially tragic that the clamor sur
rounding the two confidential ten
ure decisions has taken place in
the History Department — for his
torians are supposed to be search
ers for truth. They are the ones
who would be victimized most if
historical documents remained
classified, closed to the public. If
historians can't have access to
cold facts and figures, they must
resort to guesswork and construct
a theory solely based on conjecture
and rumor. Confidentiality, then,
is perhaps the greatest enemy to
historians.
Isn't it absurd that historians —
of all people — are denying their
colleagues access to the truth?
