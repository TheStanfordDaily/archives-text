Painted frenzy
Cardinal fans cheer the basketball team on to an 88-80 victory over Cal yesterday in Maples Pavilion.
"You can't minimize the effect of the crowd in a close game," said Stanford Coach Mike Montgomery.
"Psychologically, for the kids, it really helps." The win raised Stanford's record to 7-9 in the Pacific
10 Conference and 13-12 overall, while Cal dropped to 9-7 and 16-12. See story, page 7.
