## Big Upset for Cardinal 
### SUSAN SLUSSER Editorial staff 
With an entire 17:45 left in the
first half against the California
men's basketball team, before a
sellout crowd of 7,500 at Maples
Pavilion last night, Stanford for
ward Todd Llchtt stepped in front
of Cal's Chris Washington to pick
off a pass from point guard Kevin
Johnson. Lichti's resounding
slam at the other end put the
Cardinal up 6-4, brought the
Stanford fans to life and signaled
the start of an incredible first half
that saw the Cardinal outscore the
Bears 53-20.
California turned around and
outscored Stanford 60-35 in the
second half, but could not quite
make up the 33-point difference,
falling 88-80 in the end. The Bears
dropped to 16-12 on the season
and 9-7 in the Pacific 10 Confer
ence. but remain in the fourth
spot in the league standings.
Stanford, still in seventh place in
the Pac-10, improved its overall
mark to 13-12, and its conference
record to 7-9.
"Todd definitely threw the ball
down hard," Stanford Coach Mike
Montgomery said. "He was emo
tionally ready to play. It was obvi
ously a big game for Lichti."
Lichti's slam accounted for two
of his team-high 26 points. The 6-
4 sophomore was 9 of 12 from the
floor, including one three-point
shot, and 7 of 8 from the line.
Lichti also added eight rebounds,
as the Cardinal outrebounded

rival Cal 37-23. Berkeley's 23
boards were the fewest by a Stan
ford opponent since Columbia's
21 in early December.
"Nine-for-12 shooting — a cen
ter should be shooting like that,"
said Stanford forward Eric
Reveno, who led both teams with a
career-high 14 rebounds. "Games
like that are really going to help
us."
"Todd Lichti played a great
game for them," California Coach
Lou Campanelli said. "He took
complete control of the game in
the first half. He's really tough."
High scoring honors for the
game, however, went to Cal's
Johnson, who scored 29 points
last night. Johnson totaled 31
points the last time the two teams
faced each other (an 87-72 Cal win
at Harmon Gym). The All-Pac-10
senior had only seven points in
the first half, however, and scored
15 of his points on three-pointers
as the Bears struggled to catch up.
"Our key was not letting Kevin
Johnson destroy us," Montgomery
said. "I thought we did an excel
lent job on him in the first half."
"We knew we had to give Kevin a
little extra attention," Lichti said.
"And we did, the first half — and
some of their other guys weren't
hitting, so we built up a big lead."
The lead that Stanford built up
was phenomenal. After Lichti's
slam, the Bears went up briefly —
very briefly — on baskets by
Hartmut Ortmann and Jon
Wheeler, but the 8-6 score was to
be the last in Berkeley's favor. In

the next 7:15, the Cardinal out
scored Cal by an amazing 20-3, to
go up 31-11.
Minutes later, with the score 33-
17, Stanford rattled off another 13
unanswered points in the span of
4:02 — on two Terry Taylor three
pointers and two baskets and a
pair of free throws by Lichti — to
take a 46-17 lead.
"It was a lot of fun: I didn't want
to stop and think about it,"
Reveno said. "I did have to sub
tract 17 from 46 twice just to
make sure, though."
Things went Stanford's way
right up until the first-half buzzer
— and even after, as Taylor, who
finished with a career-high 21
points on 5-of-10 shooting (4 of 7
from three-point range) and 7 of 8
free throws, sank a three-pointer
with 30 seconds left and Cal's
Dave Butler fouled Novian Whit
sitt at the buzzer. Whitsitt hit
both free throws with no time left
and both teams off the court to up
Stanford's lead to 53-20.
Not only did the Cardinal out
rebound Berkeley 21-9 in the
opening period, Stanford also
shot 61 percent to Cal's 33 per
cent. "It's really disappointing we
didn't come out and play a better
20 minutes." Campanelli said,
"but credit Stanford with shoot
ing the lights out. When you shoot
33 percent, it'll put you in an aw
ful hole. That was the finest 20
minutes Mike's team has played
all year."
The second half was not as easy
for the Cardinal, as a fired-up Cal

ifornia team came out of the
locker room clearly bent on inflict
ing some damage — both physi
cally and on the scoreboard. The
Bears had 19 personal fouls in the
second half (and 29 for the game,
compared to 18 for Stanford) and
Cardinal free throw shooters were
gJven 42 attempts from the line,
making 37. Cal, on the other
hand, was 17 of 22 from the line
— a difference of 20 points in free
throws alone.
Still, the Bears outscored Stan
ford by 25 points in the second
period, cutting a 57-22 deficit to
just eight points in the final mo
ments of the game. In a 6:39
stretch from the 18:09 mark. Cal
totaled 15 points to two for the
Cardinal, as Johnson added eight
of his 22 second-half points to cut
Stanford's lead to 59-35. The
Bears then ran off another short
streak with 10:30 left, scoring 12
points to another two for the
Cardinal and narrowing things to
66-51 with 8:14 to go.
With less than 30 seconds left,
desperation three-pointers by
Johnson and Washington, who
tallied all 20 of his points in the
second half, made the score 86-
76. With 13 seconds remaining,
Lichti fouled out and left the game
to a thunderous ovation. Wash
ington sank the subsequent free
throws, and suddenly the score
was 86-78. Taylor responded with
two free throws of his own.

Rebounding has been a problem for Stanford — until yesterday.
Against California, Cardinal Forward Eric Reveno led all rebounders
with a career-high 14.
Johnson, and Johnson's layup
with five seconds remaining was
not enough.
You saw two different ball
games out there today," Cam
panelll said. "They destroyed us in
the first half, and we scored 60
points In the second half. Our
players weren't quitting, but we
were not getting a lot accom
plished. It was an exercise in
futility."
"A lot of teams 32 points down
would pack It in,"he contin
ued,"but these kids gave It a run
for their money. We're not here for
moral victories, though. With so
much at stake, I'm disappointed
we didn't have a better 20
minutes."
"Cal Is an excellent basketball
team," Montgomery said. "I feel we
accomplished a goal when we beat
them today. They have great
shooters, as you saw in the latter
stages of the game. I feel good
about beating a team of this
caliber."

With 17:45 left in the first half, sophomore Todd Lichti unleashed a
monstrous dunk. Though it only counted for two points, the shot
meant much more, as the Cardinal picked up Lichti's intensity and
marched to a 33-point first half lead.
