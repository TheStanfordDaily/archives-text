# Tennis splits Arizona trip
## 
### KEN STEVENS Editorial staff 
For years, highly ranked Stanford women's tennis
teams have gone into Arizona and narrowly escaped
with victories againts the pesky Sun Devils and
Wildcats.
But Saturday, the "graveyard," as Stanford Coach
Frank Brennan calls Arizona, finally claimed the
Cardinal as a victim. After sweeping I3th-ranked
Arizona State 9-0 Friday, top-ranked Stanford fell 5-
4 Saturday to No. 19 Arizona. The Cardinal is now 5-
1 in dual matches this season.
Friday's match was anything but indicative of
what was to come. Stanford dropped just one set in
rolling past the Sun Devils.
Saturday, however, the Cardinal — which had won
all 30 singles matches in its five previous dual
matches — lost four of six singles matches to put it
self in a hole. All of the losses came in three sets,
which left Brennan thinking that his players might
have been too complacent.
"Losing four out of four three-setters in singles,
everybody might have felt that somebody else was
going to pull it out," he said.
Still, Brennan said that it was the superlative play
of the Arizona players that was the most important
factor. "They played very well," he said. "They played
some great matches. They're tough and they keep
coming at you."
As tough as the Wildcats were on the Cardinal,
they were not able to blemish Stanford standout
Patty Fendlck's perfect singles record. Fendick —
who Thursday had taken fourth-seeded Helena
Sukova to three sets before losing 3-6, 6-0, 7-5 in the
third round of the Virginia Slims tournament in
Boca Raton. Fla. — defeated Arizona's Susan Russo
7-5, 6-3 Saturday in the No. 1 singles match. Fen
dick is now 4-0 in dual matches (15-0 overall this
season) and has won 32 straight collegiate matches.

Playing in the No. 3 position against Arizona, the Cardinal's Kay Tittle fell to the
Wildcats' Betsy Somerville, who "played the best game of her life," according to Stan
ford Coach Frank Brennan.
In the No. 2 singles match.
Cardinal senior Stephanie
Savldes won the first set handily
against the Wildcats' Crls Selffert
by a 6-4 score, but then dropped
the next two by the same 6-3 mar
gin.
Playing its first pressure
doubles matches of the season,
Stanford started quickly. In the
No. 3 match, Valerie Wilson and
Cari Hagey won 6-3, 6-4 over
Karln Buchholz and Jackie
Ranger. Kay Tittle and Lisa Green
rallied for a 3-6. 6-4. 6-2 victory
against Selffert and Harrlette
Knols In the No. 2 match.
The score was tied 4-4 at this
point, but at the same moment
that the Tittle-Green match
ended. Fendick and Savides were
trailing 4-1 In the third set of the
No. 1 match against Arizona's
Russo and Betsy Somervllle. The
Wildcat tandem finished off the
Stanford pair 4-6. 6-4, 6-1 to give
Arizona the upset.
Despite losing for the first time
since last April 4 and probably
losing the No. 1 national ranking,
Brennan was not overly disap
pointed. "I really feel quite posi
tive," he said. "We didn't play
badly. I thought we played quite
well."
