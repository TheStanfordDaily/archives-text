# Cal basketball gets revenge on Stanford
## 
### CHRIS CRADER Staff writer 
BERKELEY - The young
Stanford women's basketball
team learned another lesson
over the weekend: Never anger
a team and then try to play
them on the road. The Cardinal
ended an eight-game losing
streak to California in January,
but the Bears got their revenge
with a 84-68 win at Harmon
Gym Friday night.
Stanford fell to 12-12, while
the Bears moved to 15-9.
The Cardinal came out slowly
in the first half, falling behind
early, and was unable to come
back against a fired-up Cal
squad.
"They were up and they came
ready to play," Stanford Coach
Tara VanDerveer said. "1 think
we just dug ourselves a big
hole."
The Cardinal was trailing by
only six with three minutes left
in the first half, but Cal scored
10 unanswered points to ex
tend its lead to 42-26 at inter
mission.
Stanford was able to creep to
within 12, but would get no
closer. A 12-4 spurt by the
Bears midway through the
second half gave them a 20-
point lead and they never
looked back.
"We did not allow them to do
what they did [at Stanford],"

Cal Coach Gooch Foster said.
"When we play our game the
way we like to. we can beat
anyone."
The Bears were led by fresh
man Seija Leino's 20 points
and nine rebounds. Close be
hind were freshman Anja Hell
man and senior Jennifer Ben
nett with 18 points apiece,
Bennett had a game-high 11
boards.
Despite her 18, the Cardinal
did a good job on Bennett, who
had scored 25 and 44 in her
last two outings. But the Cal
center still produced, dishing
out many great passes to beat
double- and triple-teaming.
Foster also felt her Finnish
freshmen played well. "Anja
Hellman came in and gave us a
big lift on offense," she said.
"Seija Leino had a great
game. She did everything well,
and she held (Kami Anderson]
to way below her average."
Anderson, the Cardinal's
leading scorer on the season,
finished with eight points, well
under her 14.9 average, and
was only able to get off seven
shots.
Sophomore Jill Yanke led the
way for Stanford with 14
points, with classmate Evon
Asforis and freshman Jennifer
Azzi each adding 12.
The Cardinal is now tied for
sixth in the Pac-10 with Cal at
6-8.
