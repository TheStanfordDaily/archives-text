# Junior sets new collegiate record

Though It's never too early
to break a record, this one
came quite unexpectedly.
Competing In Saturday's
Peabody Coal Invitational in
Flagstaff, Ariz., Cardinal
junior Lisa Bernhagen set a
U.S. women's college record
in the high jump with a leap
of 6-foot-5 and one-half
Inch, a two and one-half
inch Improvement over her
former personal best.
The meet was the first In
door competition of the year
for Bernhagen and only her
second attempt at actually
clearing a bar — including
practice. Bernhagen and
Stanford Asst. Coach Dave
Wollman had been concentrating
on training for the upcoming out
door season.
So Bernhagen's record-setting
mark came as somewhat of a
shock, albeit a pleasant one. "It
was a nice surprise." Wollman
said. "We hadn't really planned on
doing anything Indoors."
Now Bernhagen will have at
least one more meet indoors, as
Saturday's jump qualifies her for
the NCAA Indoor Championships,
to be held March 14.
