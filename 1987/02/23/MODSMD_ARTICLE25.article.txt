# Baseball goes 1-2 in Santa Barbara
## 
### TOM SENF Editorial staff 
Like the Stanford basketball
team, the Cardinal baseball team
jumped out to an early lead yester
day, extended it, then tried to hold
on in the late going as its laugher
got less and less funny.
Unlike the hoopsters, however,
the Stanford nine saw its game get
downright gloomy, as UC-Santa
Barbara scored five runs in the
bottom of the ninth to pull out a
10-9 win at Campus Diamond in
Santa Barbara.
The Improbable comeback gave
the No. 15 Gauchos a 2-1 advan
tage in the three-game series. The
Cardinal had pulled out an equally
thrilling 8-6 11-inning decision
the previous day after UCSB had
opened the series with a 10-2
blowout Friday.
Stanford was on the verge of a
very impressive weekend when it
took a 9-5 lead into the bottom of
the ninth, Brian Keyser had
pitched three solid innings in
relief of starter Jack McDowell,
surrendering only one run. He
was the only Cardinal right
hander all weekend to have con
sistent success against the
predominantly left-handed
Gaucho lineup.
But then the Cardinal flat-out
gave it away.

Keyser began the Inning by
walking Joe Kemp and Erik
Johnson. After getting Greg Vella
on a liner to second. Keyser got
ahead of designated hitter Tom
Logan 0-2 before walking him to
load the bases.
The tying run was now at the
plate, but Stanford still seemed to
be in good shape when Tim
McKercher grounded to first. Russ
Ballati kept the Gauchos alive
with a hooking line drive that just
eluded shortstop David Esquer's
grasp and went for a two-run
single.
The score was now 9-8, and Lee
Plemel came on in relief of Keyser.
Vance Pasqua grounded a 3-2
pitch up the middle that Esquer
was able to flag down, but his
throw to first pulled Ron Witmeyer
off the bag. and the Gauchos were
still breathing.
They breathed harder when
Plemel uncorked a wild pitch to
move the runners to second and
third and then knocked the wind
out of the Cardinal when
leftfielder Quinn Mack blasted a
shot over Toi Cook's head in cen
ter to drive in the game-winners.
Stanford Jumped out to a 5-0
lead in the first on four hits, two
walks, a sacrifice fly and a steal of
home by Ed Sprague. Sprague

and insured the Cardinal's 8-6 extra-inning victory over Santa Barbara.
