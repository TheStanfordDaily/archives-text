# Baseball goes 1-2 in Santa Barbara
## 
### TOM SENF Editorial staff 
Like the Stanford basketball
team, the Cardinal baseball team
jumped out to an early lead yester
day, extended it, then tried to hold
on in the late going as its laugher
got less and less funny.
Unlike the hoopsters, however,
the Stanford nine saw its game get
downright gloomy, as UC-Santa
Barbara scored five runs in the
bottom of the ninth to pull out a
10-9 win at Campus Diamond in
Santa Barbara.
The Improbable comeback gave
the No. 15 Gauchos a 2-1 advan
tage in the three-game series. The
Cardinal had pulled out an equally
thrilling 8-6 11-inning decision
the previous day after UCSB had
opened the series with a 10-2
blowout Friday.
Stanford was on the verge of a
very impressive weekend when it
took a 9-5 lead into the bottom of
the ninth, Brian Keyser had
pitched three solid innings in
relief of starter Jack McDowell,
surrendering only one run. He
was the only Cardinal right
hander all weekend to have con
sistent success against the
predominantly left-handed
Gaucho lineup.
But then the Cardinal flat-out
gave it away.

Keyser began the Inning by
walking Joe Kemp and Erik
Johnson. After getting Greg Vella
on a liner to second. Keyser got
ahead of designated hitter Tom
Logan 0-2 before walking him to
load the bases.
The tying run was now at the
plate, but Stanford still seemed to
be in good shape when Tim
McKercher grounded to first. Russ
Ballati kept the Gauchos alive
with a hooking line drive that just
eluded shortstop David Esquer's
grasp and went for a two-run
single.
The score was now 9-8, and Lee
Plemel came on in relief of Keyser.
Vance Pasqua grounded a 3-2
pitch up the middle that Esquer
was able to flag down, but his
throw to first pulled Ron Witmeyer
off the bag. and the Gauchos were
still breathing.
They breathed harder when
Plemel uncorked a wild pitch to
move the runners to second and
third and then knocked the wind
out of the Cardinal when
leftfielder Quinn Mack blasted a
shot over Toi Cook's head in cen
ter to drive in the game-winners.
Stanford Jumped out to a 5-0
lead in the first on four hits, two
walks, a sacrifice fly and a steal of
home by Ed Sprague. Sprague

Saturday afternoon in the top of the 11th inning, sophomore Frank Carey got a base hit that drove in a run
and insured the Cardinal's 8-6 extra-inning victory over Santa Barbara.
drilled a two-run triple in the
second to put the Cardinal up 7-1.
and two Stanford runs in the
third made it 9-4,
McDowell overcame some early
control problems to shut UCSB
down during his final three in
nings before turning the ball over
to Keyser. "I thought Jack threw
well after his first couple innings,"
Stanford Coach Mark Marquess
said.
One of the primary reasons the
Cardinal Is ranked No. 4 right now
is its impressive collection of
young talent, but Saturday's game
belonged to three Stanford seniors
â€” A 1 Osuna. Ruben Amaro and
Cook.
The left-handed Osuna took
over for Steve Chitren In the third
and held the Gauchos to two runs
and six hits while striking out
nine over the last 8 1/3 innings.
With Stanford trailing 6-5 enter
ing the top of the ninth, Amaro
lashed a one-out single to right,
stole second and later, with two
outs, stole third. On an 0-2 pitch,
Cook grounded one down the
third-base line and beat the throw
of Johnson at third for an infield
hit while Amaro scored the tying
run.
"He's on his own there,"
Marquess said of Amaro's second

theft, which put him In position
to tie It up. "To me. that's the play
of the game."
In the 11th, Amaro singled
again and came around on a
double by Cook. Cook then pro
vided an Insurance run on a two
out bunt single by Frank Carey.
Osuna set the Gauchos down In
order, and Stanford had a well
deserved win.
Friday's game was not In doubt
for too long, as the Gauchos
pounded the Stanford pitching
staff early and often en route to a
10-2 win. After Stanford took a 2-
0 lead, UCSB got to Plemel for
three In the first and two In the
third. Vella tagged Jim Price for a
homer in the fifth to make it 6-2,
and four more runs of the sopho
more right-hander in the sixth
pretty much settled the issue.
Stanford will be back In action
today when it meets Santa Clara
at 2 p.m. in a makeup of an earlier
rainout at Sunken Diamond.
Card notes
After shortstop Troy Paulsen
twisted his knee In the top of the 11th
Saturday, Stanford had just one posi
tion player available, catcher Eric Cox,
so the Cardinal shortstop In the bot
tom of the Inning was none other than
McDowell, who played the position In
high school. "1 didn't want to use
(Gary) Migdol out there." Marquess
joked, referring to the less-than-sure
handed but highly efficient Stanford
asst. sports information director. "We
weren't that hard up."
