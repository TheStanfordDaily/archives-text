## Kostoff wins four, Card coasts by Cal 
### EVAN TUCHINSKY Staff writer 
The seniors on the Stanford
men's swimming team are cer
tainly going out In style. Saturday,
the Cardinal soundly defeated Cal
ifornia, 81-61, in Its last dual
meet of the season. The win caps a
9-1 regular season record, ends
the seniors' dual meet careers
with a 54-1 record and places
Stanford first In the Pacific 10
Conference.
Senior Jeff Kostoff led the Card
inal effort at Berkeley, winning
the 1.650-yard freestyle in a pool
record 14:58.10, the 500 free in
4:25.28 and the 400 individual
medley in 3:52.84. His IM time
ranks him No. 1 in the nation.
"Jeff swam In three great races,"
teammate Pablo Morales said. The
competition marked the fourth
consecutive year that Kostoff has
defeated the Bears in these three
events.
Morales had a great meet as
well. The senior finished first in
both the 100 butterfly and 200 IM,
with times of 48.52 and 1:51.29,
respectively.
Stanford swimmers also

dominated the backstroke events.
Junior Sean Murphy won the 200-
yard race in 1:50.15 and finished
second in the 100 with a time of
51.86, right behind teammate Jay
Mortenson's 50.80 mark.
Though the Bears were far from
dormant, they did not put up an
overwhelming fight. "At this point
in the season, Berkeley is not at
the peak level of performance,"
Morales said.
"They were swimming a little
tired, so they didn't swim as well
as they could," he added.
Nonetheless, six pool records fell
Saturday as the Cardinal
managed to win 10 events and
earn its sixth consecutive dual
meet victory over California. With
the victory Stanford secured the
top spot in the Pac-10 and main
tained its No. 2 national ranking.
Despite Stanford's dominance,
the day was hardly disasterous for
Cal. Senior Matt Blondi, the
leader nationally In the 50 and
100 freestyles, decreased his
times to 20.22 and 44.12, while
his teammate Lee Concepcion
took the 100 breaststroke in
56.50 and the 200 breast in
2:02.56.
