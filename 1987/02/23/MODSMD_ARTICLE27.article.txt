### FAITH PERRY Staff writer 
Forfeited matches have plagued
the Stanford wrestling team all
season, and Saturday's meet in
San Jose proved to be no excep
tion as the Cardinal lost a
heartbreaker to the San Jose
State Titans, 27-23.
Stanford's forfeit in the 118-
pound weight class came as no
surprise to anyone, since the
Cardinal hasn't had anyone to
wrestle at that weight all season.
What did come as a suprise, espe
cially to Stanford Coach Chris
Horpel, was a forfeit at 142 by
Cardinal freshman Geoff Baum.
Baum hurt his back during
practice last week, but wanted to
win the dual meet against the
Titans so badly that he didn't tell
Horpel about the injury. However,
Baum was in great pain when
warming up, and a concerned
teammate informed the coach.
Horpel immediately took Baum
out of the lineup.
Baum later found out that he
had suffered a slipped vertebrae

and stress fractures. Baum said
he should be back in time to
wrestle in the Pacific 10 Confer
ence tournament in March.
The Cardinal lost at 126 and
134, both by technical falls in the
third period. After the forfeit at
142, however. Stanford began to
score some points.
In the 150-pound division,
Stanford senior Scott Wiggen took
a 4-2 victory. But, Shane Baum
came back for the Titans with a
victory over F,ric Harber.
Stanford freshman Ron Perry
then won a 15-2 decision over
Scott Benson. According to Hor
pel, "Perry had his best match of
the year Saturday night. He
wrestled like a buzz saw."
The injured Baum reiterated his
coach's praise for Perry's perfor
mance. "Ron's match was prob
ably the best of any Stanford
wrestler this year." Baum said.
Stanford junior Terry Mclntyre
(190 pounds) completely domin
ated opponent Vince Wallace, and
won by a technical fall In the third
period. Cardinal co-captain Kurt
Kassulke won the last match of
the evening by forfeit.
