The word to describe the Stan
ford men's volleyball team's recent
trip to Southern California is
"struggle," according to Stanford
Coach Fred Sturm.
The Cardinal lost Friday at Long
Beach State. 14-16, 13-15. 15-6,
17-15. 16-14, and again Saturday
at USC. 15-10, 15-6. 15-7.
"It was a frustrating road trip."
Sturm said. "We struggled as a
team." Friday's match against No.
8 Long Beach was characterized
by Stanford's 61 hitting errors;
the 49ers made only 32 in a
relatively short five-game match of
only two hours and 20 minutes.
The first game against Long
Beach, now 3-3 in the Westerr In
tercollegiate Volleyball Association
(WIVA). typified Friday's match.
The Cardinal took control at the
start, winning a long string of
points, but then failed to main
tain its lead due to service and hit
ting errors and an Inability to
side-out, all of which helped allow
the 49ers to catch up.
Both teams scored in stretches,

alternating back and forth on the
scoreboard, in a match in which
neither team could establish a
pattern of consistent passing.
"The match seemed to be a race
to 15 with very few side-outs."
Sturm said. "It was not the brand
of volleyball we usually play. "
However, the Cardinal was able
to put up a more characteristic
fight on Saturday against the con
sistent Trojans, who now have a 4-
1 WIVA conference record. Playing
a new lineup that included fresh
men Dan Hanan and Kent Steffes.
the Cardinal was more competi
tive.
"We had a different look out
there. It was definitely the best of
the three matches." Asst. Coach
Ruben Nieves said. "But it wasn t
good enough. We were able to stay
with them for parts of the game,
siding-out well, but then we made
mistakes."
This week, with two non
conference matches, will be a
"back-to-t he-drawing-board
week." according to Nieves. In
practice, the Cardinal will work on
consistency, siding-out and team
unitv.
