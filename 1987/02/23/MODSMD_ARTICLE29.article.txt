# Weekend split for women
## Gymnastics takes Invite, falls to Bears 
### EVAN TUCHINSKY Staff writer 
This weekend the Stanford
women's gymnastics team remade
the classic western "The Good,
The Bad and The Ugly" by winning
the Hobee's Invitational Friday in
Maples Pavilion but then losing to
California Saturday in a competi
tion marred by injury and illness.

The Cardinal narrowly defeated
Oregon State at the Invitational,
winning with a score of 179.95 to
the Beavers 179.90. Cal State-
Northridge was a distant third
with its 166.10 finish.
"It was a close one. maybe too
good and close," Stanford Coach
Homer Sardina said. "The scoring
was a little low today. We didn't get
the score we needed."

"I would like to see the girls hit
all their routines in a meet." Stan
ford Asst. Coach Gary Smith said.
"It's a shame that they couldn't do
this. They are such a fantastic
workout team but not a great com
petition team."
Leading the Cardinal to victory,
as she has on several other occa
sions, was freshman Dina
Amoroso. Along with a win on the
floor exercise with a 9.30 and a
victory on the balance beam with a
9.45, Amoroso captured the meet
all-around title with her 37.15
mark.
Falls definitely plagued the
Cardinal in the meet at Cal. The
squad, missing four regular
performers due to illness, re
corded nine falls, but performed
well enough to earn a 171.25.
The Golden Bears won the meet
with a score of 177.95, but at the
cost of their top two gymnasts.
Sophomore Karin Iyemura injured
her right ankle on her dismount
from the uneven parallel bars —
though she still managed to win
the event with a 9.35. If that
didn't hurt the team enough,
senior Polly Rodgers, who was
named Pacific 10 Conference
Gymnast of the Week for last
week, twisted her knee in the
middle of her floor exercise.
Amoroso provided the brightest
light in the Stanford lineup, win
ning the vault with an impressive
9.55.

Freshman Dina Amoroso has been one of the Cardinal's top
performers all year — and that didn't change last weekend. In Friday's
Hobee's Invitational, Amoroso won the floor excercise, the balance
