# Hoover head rebuts attacks

### A. J. THOMAS Staff writer 
Hoover Institution Director W.
Glenn Campbell said his recent
statement about a "Reagan con
nection" at Stanford was a
"statement of fact and did not con
stitute a partisan endorsement of
the president's policies."
Campbell, in a press release
issued late Friday, rebutted the
Faculty Senate's unanimous deci
sion to criticize him for making a
partisan political statement while
acting in the capacity of a Univer
sity official.
In the forward to Hoover's 1986
annual report, Campbell said that
with the Stanford Board of Trus
tees' acceptance of the Ronald
Reagan Presidential Library, the
University could "boast" of a
"Reagan connection."
"Rather than accept a statement
of pride about the University's
connection with the presidency,
the senate has chosen to pass a
resolution against it," Campbell
said.
"Denigrating public service.

partisan sniping at the President
of the United States, and attempts
to deny freedom of expression are
not the hallmarks of a great uni
versity," he added.
Kenneth Arrow, chair of the
senate, welcomed Campbell's
clarification, but defended the
senate's resolution.
"I applaud Dr. Campbell's
clarification that his statement
was not intended as an endorse
ment or a rejection of the present
president or his administration."
Arrow said.
Arrow said the senate's resolu
tion "contained no partisan
sniping of the president, as is
manifest in the text."
"The statements of Dr.
Campbell were certainly widely
understood as implying special
endorsement, and I am glad that
he agrees with the senate in
repudiating that interpretation."
Arrow added.
Campbell said his remarks were
"no more a partisan endorsement"
than a 1960 statement by Harvard
