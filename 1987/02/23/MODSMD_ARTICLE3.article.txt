# Hoover head rebuts attacks

### A. J. THOMAS Staff writer 
Hoover Institution Director W.
Glenn Campbell said his recent
statement about a "Reagan con
nection" at Stanford was a
"statement of fact and did not con
stitute a partisan endorsement of
the president's policies."
Campbell, in a press release
issued late Friday, rebutted the
Faculty Senate's unanimous deci
sion to criticize him for making a
partisan political statement while
acting in the capacity of a Univer
sity official.
In the forward to Hoover's 1986
annual report, Campbell said that
with the Stanford Board of Trus
tees' acceptance of the Ronald
Reagan Presidential Library, the
University could "boast" of a
"Reagan connection."
"Rather than accept a statement
of pride about the University's
connection with the presidency,
the senate has chosen to pass a
resolution against it," Campbell
said.
"Denigrating public service.

partisan sniping at the President
of the United States, and attempts
to deny freedom of expression are
not the hallmarks of a great uni
versity," he added.
Kenneth Arrow, chair of the
senate, welcomed Campbell's
clarification, but defended the
senate's resolution.
"I applaud Dr. Campbell's
clarification that his statement
was not intended as an endorse
ment or a rejection of the present
president or his administration."
Arrow said.
Arrow said the senate's resolu
tion "contained no partisan
sniping of the president, as is
manifest in the text."
"The statements of Dr.
Campbell were certainly widely
understood as implying special
endorsement, and I am glad that
he agrees with the senate in
repudiating that interpretation."
Arrow added.
Campbell said his remarks were
"no more a partisan endorsement"
than a 1960 statement by Harvard
President Nathan Pusey boasting
of the election of a member of Har
vard's board of overseers — John
F. Kennedy — as president or a
1985 observation by Harvard Pres
ident Derek Bok that Reagan had
named more than twice as many
Harvard faculty as presidential ap
pointments than Kennedy had.
English Prof. John Bender, a
member of the senate's steering
committee, which drafted the sen
ate resolution, echoed Arrow's
sentiments. "Certainly I, in voting
for the resolution, did not intend
to denigrate public service, nor do
I believe the other members of the
senate did. I do not believe that is
the Issue here, and I do not think
comments about Harvard are rele
vant to the situation at Stanford."
Campbell noted that Reagan's

association with Stanford dates
back to 1975, when University
President Richard Lyman and the
board of trustees approved his ap
pointment as an honorary fellow
at the Hoover Institution.
"I have always believed that gov
ernment service should be held in
high esteem and that a connec
tion with the highest elected office
in the land should be a source of
pride to all citizens," Campbell
said.
"Apparently, this view is not
shared by certain faculty mem
bers," he said, noting that such
actions "do not set a good example
for our students."
Campbell declined yesterday to
comment further on his state
ment.
Political Science Prof. .John
Manley said that focusing atten
tion on Campbell's remarks
ignores the larger problems of
Stanford's relationship with
Hoover.
