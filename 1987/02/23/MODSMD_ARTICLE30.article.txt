# Weekend losses damage tennis' NCAA aspirations
## 
### JON WEISMAN Staff writer 
Injuries to Patrick McEnroe and Mark Jacobsen
may have had no greater and far-reaching Impact on
the Stanford men s tennis team than this weekend at
the National Team Indoors at Louisville, Ky.
The Cardinal lost all three matches It played, all to
top-20 teams, and greatly harmed Its chances of re
turning to Georgia In May to defend Its NCAA title.
Stanford Coach Dick Gould must have wondered
what difference the Injured pair might have made.
"I'm disappointed we lost, but I think we learned a
lot, Gould added. "A lot of guys got a lot of experi
ence. We didn't really have any bad matches all week.
I'm actually pretty encouraged — with our full
lineup, I don't see that there are any teams we cannot
beat."
What is Implied in that final sentence is the trou
ble Stanford will have in getting one of the few NCAA
tournament berths, which in the past has only taken
16 teams. By losing to Texas Christian 5-3 Friday
and Kentucky 5-4 Saturday, Stanford's relative
standing to those teams dropped, hurting its
chances of getting an at-large berth.

That leaves the Cardinal vying for a berth as
regional champion, and Stanford only has to look to
see top-ranked USC's 5-1 win over Clemson in the
tournament final to see the inherent block in that
road.
"If we can get to it (the NCAA tournament) I think
we'll be a factor," Gould said. "We've dug a pretty big
hole now. Those are two losses that will really haunt
us."
Like the loss to California Thursday. Saturday's
Kentucky match went down to the final set of the
final doubles match. Curtis Dunn and Barry Ric
hards, two of the five rookies (out of six) on doubles,
lost to the Wildcats' Adam Malik and Keith Cook, 4-6,
6-4, 6-4.
However, Richards and Dunn won five of their six
singles matches over the weekend, with Jeff Cathrall
and Jeff Tarango each winning two of three.
The most notable statistics of the weekend may
have been the Cardinal's 0-6 record on second and
third singles and its 2-6 record on doubles. The pres
ence of a healthy McEnroe and Jacobsen would have
allowt'l good players like Geordie McKee, Scott
Moody and Tarango to play lower on the singles and
doubles ledgers.
