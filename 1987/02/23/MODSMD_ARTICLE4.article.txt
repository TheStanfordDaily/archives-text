# Waning interest slows campus protest
## 
### KRISTIN BARENDSEN Staff writer 
Last year, police arrested nearly 50 Stan
ford students in sit-ins protesting Univer
sity investments in companies doing busi
ness in South Africa. Cardboard shan
tytowns challenged students daily to face
the issue of apartheid.
This year, however, has been free of stu
dent sit-ins and arrests, and the main
centers of attention in White Plaza are once
again its jewelry vendors. Where is the voice
of student activism at Stanford?
"People are tired of the (apartheid) issue,"
said junior Stacey Leyton, a member of
Stanford Out of South Africa (SOSA), which
has organized anti-apartheid protests since
it was formed in April 1985. "The protests

don't seem to do much. . . . Students don't
see the point of getting involved when they
don't seem to be getting anywhere."
"The energy ran out," said junior Mark
Lemley, president of California Statewide
College Democrats. "It happens in any
movement — there is a lot more energy
when an issue is new than when it is old."
SOSA's active membership has fallen to
"about 10" from last year's 25, Leyton said,
citing a lack of time and the graduation of
several members as possible reasons for the
decline. "We have fewer people, but they
work harder," she said, adding that SOSA's
decreased membership was not a factor in
the decision to change the focus of the
group.
"Compared to when it started, SOSA has
grown," Leyton said. "It dropped off after

the big upsurge last year."
Part of the decline in interest appears to
be a result of the Board of Trustees holding
fast to its policy of selective divestment. The
University has divested about $4.8 million
in stock in companies that do business in
South Africa, retaining more than $189
million in 66 other companies.
Referring to a dialogue between SOSA
members and three members of the board
on Feb. 9, Leyton said, "The trustees are
pretty entrenched in their stance. They're
not saying anything different than they did
two years ago. If anything, they're more
conservative."
Lemley said the goal of many moderate
people in the anti-apartheid movement was
to bring the issue to public attention.
"Some activists were not necessarily (in fa

vor of] total divestment. A lot of people
dropped out when their goals were met,"
Lemley said.
The increased censorship of news from
South Africa is another factor that has ad
versely affected student interest, according
to SOSA member Bill Minyard, a sopho
more.
"It's hard even for people inside the move
ment to know what's going on," Minyard
said, noting that "when it's on TV every day,
it's much more immediate."
Minyard said that censorship has
prompted SOSA to rhange its focus away
from overt demonstration toward educa
tion. "We need to raise the level of student
consciousness," he said.
As part of the education
processs, SOSA Is planning
several dorm presentations by
native South African speakers.
Tentative plans exist for a forum
with trustees to be held In Bran
ner in early spring.
Leyton said the group may or
ganize pro-divestment rallies and
sit-ins in early spring. "The com
bination of good weather and
lighter class loads increases activ
ism," said SOSA member Ed Gil
llland.
Both Leyton and Gilllland are
past members of Sanctuary, a
group that formed in the fall of
1985 for the purpose of providing
safe housing for Central American
refugees.
Columbae House declared Itself
a sanctuary in April 1986 and
housed a refugee until the sum
mer, and members of several other
University residences expressed
Interest in following Columbae's
example.
This year, however, the group Is
"semi-nonexistent." due to a prob
lem with ASSU funding and a
"falling out in terms of what we
wanted to do," according to senior
Don Gagllardi, a past Sanctuary
member. Gagllardi said that while
some members wanted to expand

the group's efforts to a broader
level that encompassed more
Central American concerns, other
members urged a focus on the
microcosm, through teaching En
glish to hlspanic students.
The glory was over. We didn't
know what the next step should
be." Gagllardi said. He also cited
poor communication within the
network, the lack of an umbrella
organization and a large bureau
cracy as reasons why the group
"fizzled out."
Leyton and Gilllland agreed
with Gagliardl's assessment of
Sanctuary's decline. "The issue
wasn't really new anymore."
Leyton added.
Referring to funding problems,
Gilllland said that "finances are a
problem for social action groups.
It's not their number one
priority."
The sanctuary movement now
consists of Individual efforts
around campus. A "Sanctuary
Week" is planned for the first week
of March. Gagllardi said.
Senior Hoover Fellow Seymour
Martin Llpset said that the decline
In student activism at Stanford
reflects a "U.S. passivity" that
goes against the "growing Interna
tional wave" of campus protests.
Other campus activist groups
have grown in the past year. In
cluding MEChA, the chicano stu
dent movement.

The sanctuary movement now
consists of Individual efforts
around campus. A "Sanctuary
Week" is planned for the first week
of March. Gagllardi said.
Senior Hoover Fellow Seymour
Martin Llpset said that the decline
In student activism at Stanford
reflects a "U.S. passivity" that
goes against the "growing Interna
tional wave" of campus protests.
Other campus activist groups
have grown in the past year. In
cluding MEChA, the chicano stu
dent movement.
Last year, police arrested nearly 50 Stan
ford students in sit-ins protesting Univer
sity investments in companies doing busi
ness in South Africa. Cardboard shan
tytowns challenged students daily to face
the issue of apartheid.
This year, however, has been free of stu
dent sit-ins and arrests, and the main
centers of attention in White Plaza are once
again its jewelry vendors. Where is the voice
of student activism at Stanford?
"People are tired of the (apartheid) issue,"
said junior Stacey Leyton, a member of
Stanford Out of South Africa (SOSA), which
has organized anti-apartheid protests since
it was formed in April 1985. "The protests

don't seem to do much. . . . Students don't
see the point of getting involved when they
don't seem to be getting anywhere."
"The energy ran out," said junior Mark
Lemley, president of California Statewide
College Democrats. "It happens in any
movement — there is a lot more energy
when an issue is new than when it is old."
SOSA's active membership has fallen to
"about 10" from last year's 25, Leyton said,
citing a lack of time and the graduation of
several members as possible reasons for the
decline. "We have fewer people, but they
work harder," she said, adding that SOSA's
decreased membership was not a factor in
the decision to change the focus of the
group.
"Compared to when it started, SOSA has
grown," Leyton said. "It dropped off after

the big upsurge last year."
Part of the decline in interest appears to
be a result of the Board of Trustees holding
fast to its policy of selective divestment. The
University has divested about $4.8 million
in stock in companies that do business in
South Africa, retaining more than $189
million in 66 other companies.
Referring to a dialogue between SOSA
members and three members of the board
on Feb. 9, Leyton said, "The trustees are
pretty entrenched in their stance. They're
not saying anything different than they did
two years ago. If anything, they're more
conservative."
Lemley said the goal of many moderate
people in the anti-apartheid movement was
to bring the issue to public attention.
"Some activists were not necessarily (in fa

vor of] total divestment. A lot of people
dropped out when their goals were met,"
Lemley said.
The increased censorship of news from
South Africa is another factor that has ad
versely affected student interest, according
to SOSA member Bill Minyard, a sopho
more.
"It's hard even for people inside the move
ment to know what's going on," Minyard
said, noting that "when it's on TV every day,
it's much more immediate."
Minyard said that censorship has
prompted SOSA to rhange its focus away
from overt demonstration toward educa
tion. "We need to raise the level of student
consciousness," he said.
As part of the education
processs, SOSA Is planning
several dorm presentations by
native South African speakers.
Tentative plans exist for a forum
with trustees to be held In Bran
ner in early spring.
Leyton said the group may or
ganize pro-divestment rallies and
sit-ins in early spring. "The com
bination of good weather and
lighter class loads increases activ
ism," said SOSA member Ed Gil
llland.
Both Leyton and Gilllland are
past members of Sanctuary, a
group that formed in the fall of
1985 for the purpose of providing
safe housing for Central American
refugees.
Columbae House declared Itself
a sanctuary in April 1986 and
housed a refugee until the sum
mer, and members of several other
University residences expressed
Interest in following Columbae's
example.
This year, however, the group Is
"semi-nonexistent." due to a prob
lem with ASSU funding and a
"falling out in terms of what we
wanted to do," according to senior
Don Gagllardi, a past Sanctuary
member. Gagllardi said that while
some members wanted to expand

the group's efforts to a broader
level that encompassed more
Central American concerns, other
members urged a focus on the
microcosm, through teaching En
glish to hlspanic students.
The glory was over. We didn't
know what the next step should
be." Gagllardi said. He also cited
poor communication within the
network, the lack of an umbrella
organization and a large bureau
cracy as reasons why the group
"fizzled out."
Leyton and Gilllland agreed
with Gagliardl's assessment of
Sanctuary's decline. "The issue
wasn't really new anymore."
Leyton added.
Referring to funding problems,
Gilllland said that "finances are a
problem for social action groups.
It's not their number one
priority."
The sanctuary movement now
consists of Individual efforts
around campus. A "Sanctuary
Week" is planned for the first week
of March. Gagllardi said.
