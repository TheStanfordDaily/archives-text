Equality law, Intended to allow
women the same opportunities as
men. has instead given men the
few benefits that women have
been historically permitted and
actually expresses male
dominance in law, charged lawyer
Catharine MacKinnon, a visiting
scholar at Stanford's Institute for
Research on Women and Gender.
"Almost every sex discrimina
tion case that has been won at the

Supreme Court level has been
brought by a man," MacKinnon
said Friday at the final session of a
two-day conference sponsored by
the institute and titled
"Theoretical Perspectives on
Sexual Difference."
Speaking to a predominantly
female audience of approximately
80 people in room 190 of the Stan
ford Law School, MacKinnon cited
the law of custody and divorce,
transformed by the rule of gender
neutrality to give men an equal
chance at custody and alimony, as

one example of how men have
benefited from gender neutrality.
Deborah Rhode, the institute
director and a Stanford law pro
fessor, also spoke, criticizing the
law for being too concerned with
gender difference and not enough
with gender disadvantage. The
stakes in reformulating the legal
alternatives "are not simply
equality between the sexes, but
the quality of life for both of
them." she said.
Under gender neutrality, the
societal advantages men enjoy and

the disadvantages women experi
ence are not taken into account,
because that would mean taking
gender into account. MacKinnon
said.
Thus it has given men the few
benefits that women have been
allowed, but it has failed to give
women the benefits to which men
have had access, MacKinnon said.
"IWomen] still have not gotten
equal pay or equal work, we get far
less equal pay for equal work, and
we are close to losing separate
enclaves like women's schools

through this approach," MacKin
non said.
Equality law also fails to address
adequately so-called "female prob
lems" such as pregnancy leaves
and the whole spectrum of vio
lence against women, including
pornography, prostitution, rape
and wife-beating.
"These experiences have been
silenced out . . . largely because
they happen almost exclusively to
women. Understand: For this rea
