# New Varsity to shut down
## Was fixture on University Ave. for 13 years 
### MONIQUE SCHEER Senior staff writer 
When the credits roll at the end of "Otello" tomor
row night at the New Varsity, it will mark the final
film showing at the 13-year-old Palo Alto theater and
nightclub.
The New Varsity is closing "because our expenses
are far greater than our income," according to Hilary
Hart, the theater's manager.
The Landmark Theater Corporation has pur
chased the building, which will become a "first-run
art house" showing mainly art and foreign films
similar to the type now featured at the Bijou and
Aquarius theaters, which are also owned by the Los
Angeles-based company.
While the interior will likely remain unchanged,
the theater will probably be turned into four smaller
cinemas. Hart said.
The New Varsity's restaurant was not bought by
the new owners of the theater, but in the future
"somebody might restart it. she said.
The theater was forced to close primarily due to
shrinking attendance at performances. Hart said.
While Stanford student support has remained
relatively steady, there has been a "gradual decline"
in patronage since it peaked during the summer of
1983, according to senior Tom Barkett, a part-time

bartender at the New Varsity.
One reason for the diminishing clientele is compe
tition from restaurants and movie theaters in the
area. Hart said. "There are a lot more movie theaters
now than when we opened (in April 1974)," she said.
"New places are kind of trendy," Barkett said,
noting that the "yuppie crowd" does not frequent the
New Varsity as much as it did three years ago. But
now that the New Varsity has new owners, "maybe it
will come back."
The cost of running a theater the size of the New
Varsity is high, but costs were "cut to the bone"
when the former owners began experiencing finan
cial difficulty. Hart said.
"We did everything we could but there was no way
of turning it around," she said.
Hart said she did not know what will happen to the
employees of the New Varsity.
Barkett noted that fewer workers are employed
during the winter, so fewer people will lose their jobs
now than if the closing had taken place during the
summer. "But (the managers] are going to have to
find something else," he speculated.
The New Varsity will throw its final closing party
Wednesday night, featuring Tuck and Patti. Admis
sion is free, but a *5 donation will be requested.
