boast on their radio show.

explains Montague. "Beats and
rhymes have been around for a

The group had Its origins
several years ago. when Montague
and classmate Louis Carr began
working as disc jockeys at parties
around campus. They gradually
Introduced more and more rap
songs Into their format, and dis

covering that people "really liked

"We kept getting requests for
more," says Carr, a recent Stan

mostly rap music, making "The
Drum" the first radio show of its

San Jose, Berkeley, Oakland. . . .
We even heard that people were

telling them to listen to our show.
When we realized how popular rap

'Wouldn't it be great to get to
gether our own demo?' So we put
one out, and things took off from
there."
The first indication of success
came with an invitation by KSTS
to appear on its "Magic Video
Number" show. Soon after, Mon
tague and Carr along with fellow
classmate Rich Dwyer (now a law
student), produced an album that
was distributed in New York and

In the Bay Area. Things looked
promising until the distribution
company folded.
"We learned a lesson from that
one." says Montague. "Never trust
anyone in the record business."

other rap groups."
