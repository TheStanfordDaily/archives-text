Pact attempts to stabilize dollar
PARIS — Six leading Industrial nations agreed yesterday on a
firm pact aimed both at preventing a further decline in the U.S.
dollar and at reducing the U.S. trade deficit.
But the accord was tarnished when Italy, angry over being ex
cluded from earlier negotiations, walked out at the beginning of
the formal closed session and threatened to cancel the seven
nation economic summit scheduled for Venice In June.
Under the agreement. West Germany and Japan promised to
take additional steps to stimulate their weakening economies.
The United States for months had urged such measures in the
hope that, by boosting West German and Japanese demand for
U.S. goods, the yawning U.S. trade gap could be narrowed.
In return, the Reagan administration bowed to pleas from U.S.
trading partners to prevent the dollar from falling further in rela
tion to other currencies. The trading partners had complained
that the sagging dollar, by effectively increasing the price of
foreign goods sold in the United States, had sliced deeply Into the
sales of their major exporting companies.
Reagan sent shipments in advance
WASHINGTON — Behind conflicting testimony over whether
President Reagan gave advance approval for a shipment of U.S.
arms by Israel to Iran in September 1985 is evidence suggesting
that Reagan agreed in advance to two subsequent planned ship
ments In late 1985, long before he signed a presidential authoriza
tion required by law, according to congressional investigators and
former administration officials.
Former national security adviser Robert McFarlane has insisted
in testimony to Congress and the Tower commission, which is In
vestigating the Iran affair, that Reagan privately approved an Is
raeli plan in late summer 1985 to ship U.S. weapons to Iran as
part of an effort to free American hostages held in Lebanon.
Reagan initially gave the Tower commission a similar account.
But the president changed his story in a second meeting with the
commission on Feb. 11 and insisted that he had been unaware of
the Israeli arms shipment in early September. That version
coincided with the sworn Capitol Hill testimony of White House
chief of staff Donald Regan.
However, the Reagan-Regan account involves only one of two
arms shipments by Israel to Iran in September 1985. While the ex
tent of the president's prior knowledge of the first of these is es
sentially a matter of his word against McFarlane's, there is some
evidence that Reagan likely knew ahead of time about the second
shipment.
Universities fight sharp criticism
WASHINGTON — College and university administrators, jolted
by sharp criticism over rising costs and a series of defeats last year
on Capitol Hill, are in the midst of an unusually aggressive public
relations and lobbying effort to reverse what they say is a disturb
ing shift in public attitudes toward higher education.
Long accustomed to a certain public veneration for their insti
tutions, college presidents admit they were surprised by a number
of recent events, including last year's debate on tax overhaul and
mandatory retirement, hinting at a new congressional sentiment
that higher education should be treated like other interest
groups. That came on top of well-publicized criticism of intercol
legiate athletics, rising college costs and stagnant educational
quality.
In response, administrators have begun scrambling to get out
their side of the story. University President Donald Kennedy, for
example, recently held an all-day news conference to detail the
finances of his institution, including the need for a * 1.1 billion
fund-raising drive, then flew to New York the next day to deliver
the pitch to a handful of reporters over lunch.
While Kennedy was presenting his message in New York,
Georgetown University President Timothy Healy and four other
college presidents were meeting with reporters in Washington,
carefully outlining their reasons for raising tuition.
Explosion in Jerusalem injures 17
JERUSALEM — Twelve Israeli border policemen and five Arab
passers-by were wounded by an explosion outside Jerusalem's
walled Old City yesterday in what appears to have been part of an
accelerating trend of Palestinian attacks on Israeli security forces
there.
"At this time it's not clear to us yet if we're talking about a hand
grenade explosion or a bomb blast," Police Chief David Kraus told
reporters soon after the incident. The device was apparently
thrown from a passing car.
Jerusalem police commander Yosef Yehudai added that the at
tack was clearly directed at the border police unit, occurring just
at the time many were on hand for the changing of the guard
around the main Damascus Gate into the Old City's Moslem Quar
ter.
Most of the wounded were hit by shrapnel, and none was re
ported to be critically hurt. Nine border policemen remained
hospitalized last night.
Security forces sealed off the area immediately after the explo
sion. and about 70 Arabs who were in the vicinity were detained
for questioning. The attack took place yesterday afternoon, a nor
mal work day both for Jews and Arabs.
Cuomo reflects on decision
NEW YORK - With supporters and pundits all telling him he had
a plausible shot at his party's 1988 presidential nomination, New
York Gov. Mario Cuomo nevertheless decided not to run.
Why? The Empire State Democrat said in an interview Friday he
had never gotten particularly close to becoming a candidate. "I
started with a presumption against it. That was the initial posi
tion. That was the ultimate position. My experience only con
firmed what was my instinct from the start."
He said he had been troubled all along by the logistics of trying
to juggle two massive jobs simultanously — running for president
and governing a complex state. No sitting governor since Franklin
Roosevelt has campaigned successfully for president, and he did
so long before the proliferation of primaries and events trans
formed the process into a multi-year marathon.
"They tell me you need to spend 40 or 50 days in lowa." Cuomo
said. "You can't go there and say. Hello, I'm Mario Cuomo from
New York and I'm only here for a little while because I got Warren
Anderson (the Republican leader of the New York state Senate)
back at home beating me up. . . . Doing it right means being in
their living rooms and their communities, speaking to them per
son to person. That would have been very hard."
French police capture terrorists
PARIS — Special French police raided an isolated farm house
near Orleans this weekend and captured four of France's most
wanted terrorist suspects without firing a shot in a dramatic turn
in France's battle against urban guerrillas.
The Saturday night capture, announced by police yesterday,
netted the leaders of the terrorist organization Direct Action. Two
of the four are women suspected of gunning down and killing
Georges Besse, the president of the Renault auto company, on a
Paris street three months ago.
French government officials were delighted by the successful
raid. President Francois Mitterrand sent a message to Premier
Jacques Chirac congratulating all police officers involved. Mitter
rand called It "a precious encouragement for intensifying the
struggle that the state must wage without fail to dispose of the
threat of terrorists."
