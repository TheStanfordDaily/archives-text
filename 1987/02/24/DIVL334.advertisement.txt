Austrian Visitor in Spring Quarter
Professor Karlheinz Rossbacher will be the distinguished visiting
professor from Austria during the spring quarter. He will teach an
undergraduate course in English which should be of particular
interest to students who have been at the Stanford Center in
Vienna: Austrian Literature of the Fln-de-siecle; which will
deal with Austrian literature around 1900, viewed in connection
with philosophy, art, politics, and social developments. (German
Studies 171 A). Rossbacher will also teach a graduate seminar,
Osterreichische Romane nach 1945 (German Studies 349Q).
Professor Rossbacher studied at the Universities of Vienna,
Innsbruck and Salzburg. He has been a professor of German
literature at the University of Salzburg since 1976. He spent a year
at the University of Kansas as a Fulbright scholar, another year in
the U.S. as a fellow of the American Council of Learned Societies,
and he taught at Emory University in 1983.
