# Condoms might be dispensed in dorms

Residential Education is likely
to give approval to a trial installa
tion of condom dispensers in se
lected student residences and li
brary bathrooms around campus,
according to junior Shirley Wang,
a member of the student task
force lobbying for the action.
Pending approval by Norm Rob
inson, associate dean of Student
Affairs, the dispensers will be in
stalled in dorms and libraries by
National Sanitary Labs. The com
pany will assume responsibility
for the cost of maintenance and
installation, according to Wang.
The company is prepared to
begin installation in men's and
women's bathrooms immediately
and can have the dispensers
available to serve the student body
in a week's time. The machines
will dispense condoms for 50
cents each. Wang said. The Con
traceptive Information Center, lo
cated at Cowell Student Health
Center, charges students 10 cents
per condom.
The possible addition of the
machines to restroom facilities
results from extremely positive
responses to a survey conducted
last week. A task force, composed
of five students currently enrolled
in a human biology course, asked
for student opinion on condom
use, sexual activity and sexually
transmitted diseases. Approxi
mately 500 students from a num
ber of student residences were
polled and a random cross section
of students was questioned in
White Plaza and Meyer Library.
The survey showed students
strongly in favor of condom dis
pensers.
The five students responsible
for the campaign are enrolled in
Human Biology 150 A, "Biosocial
Aspects of Birth Control," and are
conducting the survey to fulfill a
class requirement. The project is
intended to "educate students
about sexual responsibilities and
make the imprint of'safe sex' on
the minds of students and the
public," said Wang.
The task force approached Uni
versity authorities approximately
three weeks ago with the survey
and plans for installation. Dean of
Student Affairs James Lyons "had
no objections, but Res Ed will
have the last word." said senior
Jennifer Yu. a member of the task
force. The decision is expected to
come from Robinson Wednesday.
The task force encountered very
little negative response in its sur
vey. "Most people are happy with
the plan and they realize that this
is something for the good of soci
ety, that condom use is a medi
cally proven way of having safe
sex," said Wang. "The most com-
mon complaint was that the pres
ence of condom dispensers would
increase promiscuity on campus
and peer pressure to have sex.
Statistics show that this is not
true." she said.
David Bao, treasurer of the
AIDS Education Project, com
mended "anything that makes
condoms easier to purchase." He
said it will be "a long process to
make people aware that this is not
just birth control but an as
surance of protection from AIDS."

Wang st r essed the importance
of other forms of birth control.
Condoms are not a foolproof
means of contraception but are in
tended to provide protection
against sexually transmitted
diseases. Wang said.
Third-year medical student
Jedd Monson said the machines
have been "a long time in coming.
"Contraceptive services are too
out of reach, and with AIDS
around this has become a life-and
death issue rather than just birth
control." Monson said. "I hope
they will be available in every
restrooom in America."
But opposition has been voiced
by some members of the Stanford

community. Dave Moore, a mem
ber of Campus Crusade, said the
condom dispensers were reflective
of "societal remedies to symptoms
rather than root issues." Moore
went on to say that the presence of
the machines was an "un
comfortable thing in the sense
that it sanctions an immoral life
style by making the condoms
more accessible."
Depending on the success of the
trial Installation, dispensers will
be put into all student residences
and libraries as well as at other
locations around campus such as
Tresidder Union. Follow-up sur
veys and monitoring of the pro
gram will continue.
