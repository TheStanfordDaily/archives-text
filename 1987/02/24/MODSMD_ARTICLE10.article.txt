# 14 plates stolen

### FRANK QUARATIELLO Staff Writer 
Fourteen out-of-state license
plates have been reported stolen
from cars on campus In the past
two weeks and Stanford police
believe the perpetrators may be
participants in a campus sca
venger hunt.
"It appears as though it's a
scavenger hunt." said Stanford
Police Capt. Raoul Niemeyer, who
is handling the investigation.
None of the 14 stolen plates are
from California, Niemeyer said,
adding that each missing license
plate is from a different state.
"The thefts seem random."
Niemeyer said. "The license plates
have been stolen from areas all
over the campus."
"It's probably the fraternities
. . . unless it's a major criminal
who is putting these license plates
on stolen cars and shipping them
around the country, but, in this
district. I don't think so,"
Niemeyer said.
Last summer, when officials in
spected fraternity houses, several
stolen license plates were found,
he said.
"We have no hard and fast
suspects yet, but we would
welcome any information,"

Nlemeyer said, adding that if the
license plates are returned
anonymously no questions will be
asked and the plates will be
returned to their owners.
Similar thefts take place every
few years. Niemeyer said.
A number of on-campus license
plate thefts have gone unreported.
Sophomore William Lipa said he
had his California license plates
stolen last Tuesday but did not
report the theft to the police.
Possession of stolen license
plates is a felony. While it can be
reduced to a misdemeanor, the
penalty still may involve heavy
fines, probation and the possibil
ity of a jail sentence, depending on
the number of stolen license
plates and the mood of the Judge
involved. Niemeyer said. It is con
sidered petty theft for someone
caught in the act of stealing
license plates and the penalty is
less severe, he added.
Stanford police have distributed
lists of the stolen plates' numbers
to all officers and the department
is Increasing plainclothes de
tective work in an effort to find the
thief, Niemeyer said. The police
have also contacted Row officials,
asking them to be on the lookout
for the stolen license plates, he
added.
