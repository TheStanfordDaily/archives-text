## THE 						STANFORD DAILY An Independent Newspaper Is this a cover-up?

If Robert McFarlane's testimony to the
Tower Commission holds up, the president
could be guilty of violating U.S. arms export
laws and his top advisers would be guilty of
manufacturing a cover-up.
The former National Security Adviser
reportedly told the commission last week
that he helped falsify documents when the
scandal broke in November to hide the presi
dent's role in the initiation of arms ship
ments to Iran. McFarlane said he responded
to a Nov. 18 call from his successor at the Na
tional Security Council, John Poindexter, to
help him and NSC aide Oliver North invent a
chronology to be used by the president to
shield himself in a news conference the next
day.
The plan was to give Reagan a way to deny
that he approved the first arms shipment.
The question is important legally; if the ship
ments were illegal and the president ordered
them, he would be directly responsible.
McFarlane says Reagan's approval came in
July 1985, before the first shipment. Chief of
Staff Donald Regan says Reagan didn't grant
approval until afterward, in August 1985.
Reagan has said both.
On Jan. 26 the president twice told the

Tower Commission he had orally approved
the shipments. On Feb. 11 he said he was
mistaken — that after conferring with Regan
he decided he had not approved them. The
commission was dumbfounded at Reagan's
turnaround.
What the president did may depend upon
the definition of "approval." He may have
OK'd the the shipments withoutformally ap
proving them. But shouldn't the president be
held responsible whether his approval was
implicit or not? Or should presidents be
allowed to break laws by structuring the
violation to place blame elsewhere?
This was exactly the point from the begin
ning, according to McFarlane. The entire
arms deal was constructed so that the ques
tion of the Watergate era — "How much did
the president know and when did he know
it?" — could not be answered.
The Tower report will be released
Thursday. It is expected to be highly critical
of Reagan even though he appointed the
commission, and undoubtedly will raise
more questions about his role in the Iran
contra affair which will have to be answered
— regardless of whether his aides have
prepared a way out for him.
