SDI is no mere
j pipe dream
I feel compelled to respond to
• Kelvin Fincher's recent column
\ on the impossibility of strategic
• defense (Daily, Feb. 19). His arti
cle is nothing but a statement of
misinformation riddled with
internal contradictions. After
reading his point of view, I began
; to wonder whether he has gone
beyond the acknowledgments of
the "authorities" of The New
Republic whom he avidlv cites.
The Strategic Defense Initiative
(SDI) is not some mere fantasy or
futuristic vision. It is already a
reality. The Soviets have been
working on a defense since the
United States signed the ABM
Treaty with them in 1972.
I'm glad Fincher has so much
faith in arms-control negotia
tions. I don't. After SALT I and
SALT II we have more missiles
than treaties! As Rep. Jack Kemp
of New York has noted, "Those
who would sell out SDI deploy
ment to secure an agreement
with the Soviets suffer from se
vere amnesia about the sorry
record of arms-control agree
ments over the past 20 years."
A few simple questions demon
strate Fincher's contradictions. If
SDI is an impossibility, why do
we need a treaty limiting its
deployment? Why don't the
Soviets sit back and laugh as we
spend billions on a technological
boondoggle?
Fincher himself calls SDI "a
blurred vision" on which we are
spending "billions of dollars."
Somehow he comes to the conclu
sion that we should, nonetheless,
not scrap it, just delay deploy
ment for 10 years; that would be
OK. This is exactly what the
Soviets want.

According to Robert Jastrow,
professor of earth science at
Dartmouth and founder and
former director of the Goddard
Institute for Space Studies, we
have "only four or five years"
before the Soviets have superior
ity in both offense and defense.
This is why Gorbachev went to
Iceland. A 10-year delay would
suit him fine.
What about the American
public? According to the Feb. 16
issue of Newsweek, "Opinion polls
show overwhelming support for
the system." Oops, I forgot,
Americans don't understand
strategic defense, because accord
ing to Fincher, "The whole nation
is blindly following [Reagan's lead)
in dizzying circles."
That's right, that's how the
liberals claim Reagan got elected
in the first place; people are just
ignorant. Too bad we can't all
achieve the high level of thinking
liberals possess.
Has Fincher taken the initiative
to look into the errors espoused
by the Union of Concerned Scien
tists? Or did he accept them on
blind faith? As Jastrow has
pointed out, the UCS overes
timated the number of satellites
needed for an effective defense by
more than 2,300. And how about
this: They overestimated the
weight of a linear accelerator, a
key component for the future of
the neutral particle beam, by a
factor of 1,600! Oops!
One final note in response to
Fincher's question, "Mr. Presi
dent, can you spell naive?" I'd be
willing to bet that President
Reagan can spell naive, and he
might even point out Fincher as a
vivid example. At least Reagan is
not content with the concept of
willfully allowing U.S. citizens to
be defenseless.

After recent surveys showed
that Stanford graduates were
dissatisfied with advising, the
University finally reacted and
made some structural changes
within the advising system. Yet,
the heart of advising, the advice
itself, still remains to be changed.
The advice many academic or
career advisers give on choosing a
major or career is certainly well
meant. Nevertheless, their advice
often proves to be useless or even
harmful because the special sit
uation of the advisee is all too
often neglected.
Many advisers stress the impor
tance of taking a wide variety of
courses and insist that courses
need neither pertain to a particu
lar major nor be useful for a spe
cific career. As reasonable as this
advice appears at first, there is a
catch to it. Many advisers dish
out this particular advice like
cafeteria food — without regard
to the individual. The special
talents, unique backgrounds and
particular needs of the advisees
are rarely taken into account.
Of course, we students must
also contribute our share. We
must be patient in assessing our
strengths and weaknesses. We
must resist the temptation of
making decisions regarding a
major or a career too early.
Furthermore, we must be active
in building a personal relation
ship with our adviser, so we can
obtain the kind of personalized
advice that will help us to make
better choices. And when we do
get this advice, we must still
scrutinize and question it.

This is why Gorbachev went to
Iceland. A 10-year delay would
suit him fine.
What about the American
public? According to the Feb. 16
issue of Newsweek, "Opinion polls
show overwhelming support for
the system." Oops, I forgot,
Americans don't understand
strategic defense, because accord
ing to Fincher, "The whole nation
is blindly following [Reagan's lead)
in dizzying circles."
That's right, that's how the
liberals claim Reagan got elected
in the first place; people are just
ignorant. Too bad we can't all
achieve the high level of thinking
liberals possess.
Has Fincher taken the initiative
to look into the errors espoused
by the Union of Concerned Scien
tists? Or did he accept them on
blind faith? As Jastrow has
pointed out, the UCS overes
timated the number of satellites
needed for an effective defense by
more than 2,300. And how about
this: They overestimated the
weight of a linear accelerator, a
key component for the future of
the neutral particle beam, by a
factor of 1,600! Oops!
One final note in response to
Fincher's question, "Mr. Presi
dent, can you spell naive?" I'd be
willing to bet that President
Reagan can spell naive, and he
might even point out Fincher as a
vivid example. At least Reagan is
not content with the concept of
willfully allowing U.S. citizens to
be defenseless.

Individualize
academic help
After recent surveys showed
that Stanford graduates were
dissatisfied with advising, the
University finally reacted and
made some structural changes
within the advising system. Yet,
the heart of advising, the advice
itself, still remains to be changed.
The advice many academic or
career advisers give on choosing a
major or career is certainly well
meant. Nevertheless, their advice
often proves to be useless or even
harmful because the special sit
uation of the advisee is all too
often neglected.
Many advisers stress the impor
tance of taking a wide variety of
courses and insist that courses
need neither pertain to a particu
lar major nor be useful for a spe
cific career. As reasonable as this
advice appears at first, there is a
catch to it. Many advisers dish
out this particular advice like
cafeteria food — without regard
to the individual. The special
talents, unique backgrounds and
particular needs of the advisees
are rarely taken into account.
Of course, we students must
also contribute our share. We
must be patient in assessing our
strengths and weaknesses. We
must resist the temptation of
making decisions regarding a
major or a career too early.
Furthermore, we must be active
in building a personal relation
ship with our adviser, so we can
obtain the kind of personalized
advice that will help us to make
better choices. And when we do
get this advice, we must still
scrutinize and question it.
