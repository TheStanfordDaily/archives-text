# Oxford's problems not so great

### 
As Stanford students who attended the Ox
ford overseas campus, we believe that Jona
than Mann overlooked substantial gains made
by Stanford-in-Oxford in his recent viewpoint
(Daily, Feb. 20). He did, however, introduce
weaknesses in the program for one- and two
quarter students which we believe can be im
proved.

Because Mann expects Oxford institutions
to treat him as Stanford treats him. he does
not see the strengths of the administration
there. In England, students, not an adult ad
ministration. Initiate most student activities.
The director does not serve as a Resident Fel
low. It is not a Stanford dormitory. The stu
dents shape events, and the director responds
to their needs.
Last spring, the students worked with direc
tor Geoffrey Tyack to get speakers including an
architectural historian, a member of Parlia
ment and a professional harpist. Also, the Ox
ford administration has set up affiliations
with the student union and colleges, enabling
students to attend Oxford formal debates and
participate in sports and clubs.
Additionally. Mann criticizes the academic
structures, and shows that he is oblivious to
gains made. Tyack has worked hard to gain en
trance for students into a rigid system. Stu
dents who really need the resources of the
world-renowned Bodelian Library can now use

it. As students who did use the Bodelian, once
we understood the system, we had few prob
lems with research or study. The hours are
limited because of overcrowding, not simply
English elitism. The Bodelian Library will
never be like Green. For students who do not
get access, there is a steadily expanding Stan
ford library. Also, the administration has for
malized and expanded the rigorous Oxford
tutorial system in the past year, and Overseas
Studies encourages students to take such one
on-one classes.
Despite overlooking steady administrative
improvements, he does mention some prob
lems that Overseas Studies should address.
Now that Mann has presented the problems,
some practical and less emotional responses
are necessary. First. Overseas Studies should
present the physical aspects of the complex to
prospective attendees more realistically before
they submit their applications. An on-campus
forum discussing student expectations and
realities is another possibility. Whether we like
to admit it or not. many of us picture ourselves
as Rhodes Scholars living with English stu
dents. totally integrated after one, two or three
quarters. Yet. integration takes time that most
one-quarter and some two-quarter students
don't have.
Overseas Studies can also try to change the
social situation for one-quarter students. The
English class system, the prevalence of
Americans In Oxford and a general misun
derstanding by English people of why
Americans go overseas to study cause most Ox
fordlans to distance themselves from Ameri
can students at first. When 25 new students
venture into the Magdalen College dining hall,
they can't really expect Oxford students to

treat them as their privileged guests. Neither
can Stanford expect its students there to break
into cliques of English students and introduce
themselves, though some will try and can be
successful.
An alternative social network can be set up
for those who don't have the time to make the
gradual entrance into the English social scene.
Many students establish contacts with English
people interested in talking to Americans,
which deteriorate once they leave. Perhaps a
network of support families can be estab
lished. as is done in Tours. This would not
need to be as formalized as it is in Tours, but
would serve as a chance for students to talk
face-to-face with English people who have an
interest in them.
Beyond a system of volunteer families for
those students who wish to meet them, the Ox
ford staff can construct a list of students and
community members who would like to sup
port students — if Stanford students want
such individual interaction, which can be
hard to achieve in certain colleges.
The Stanford administration has worked
hard to make formal entrances into Oxford,
and has been quite successful. But. if Stanford
continues to send students for one quarter (as
they do now in the fall and spring), Overseas
Studies should make students more aware of
the physical resources of the campus, and en
courage alternatives because Stanford stu
dents cannot easily glide into the Oxford sys
tem. This is not to say that Stanford should
baby students, but it should provide the
groundwork to help students educate them
selves through others.
