# Getting star treatment
## 
### 
Last October my friend Felicia needed victims for
her movie and, of course, I jumped at the chance. I
left a note on her door saying I wanted to be a star.
But what I really wanted to do was direct, as the
saying goes. I had lots of ideas. A Dracula movie. Our
dorm, Toyon, has iron chandeliers swinging from
chains, which is very Transylvanian. Or we could do
a disaster flick. Maybe Aaron would let us use his
Godzilla.

Felicia came by to tell me that if I wanted to be a
star, it would have to be at 8 o'clock in the morning.
Saturday morning. Victimized!
And face it, anything filmed at eight in the morn
ing could be neither melodramatic nor campy nor
noir. As it turned out, it wasn't even "Blue Vel
veteen." Velure maybe. There was no script, no
sound and no acting required. All Felicia wanted was
moving bodies for her two-minute Comm. 114 as
signment.
"You have to admit." she said, "at least it's in
color."
I wanted to know the story line.
"Well." she said, "it's like this. You come into my
room and steal a computer disk, 1.e., you're
supposed to be a thief."
"Got it," I said.
Felicia continued. "Then my friend Paul, the other
victim, catches you red-handed. There's a fight
scene. The two of you struggle. Then you jump out
the window."
Felicia lives on the third floor.
"I'll explain later." she said.
"Is that the end?" I asked, understandably.
"No," she explained, "then there's a bike chase
from Toyon to Meyer to the Quad. You escape at the
end."
"Hmm," I said, "this involves exercise?"
"You're lucky." Felicia said,"l was going to end it
with a bike crash."
There are hazards to being in friends' movies.
Felicia told me about a scene filmed two years ago,
when two guys ran along Toyon's rooftops in a chase
sequence. Then — on the rooftops — they struggled
over a pink flamingo. Felicia tells me that jumping
from the third-floor balcony won't be half so bad. She
promises.
Now it's Saturday morning. I'm in my thief
costume. Since Paul hasn't turned up yet, we start
filming mv scenes.
Felicia is the director and all-around "auteur,"
maybe even the key grip. She sets up the tripod by
the window and tells me to look criminal.
I try really hard not to smile as I walk to her desk
and pick the disk out of the case. Not exactly into the

role, I keep looking sideways at the camera. Despite
the lack of sound, I'm Improvising lines. In the film,
whenever my lips are moving, that's me asking
Felicia what to do next.
"Can 1 stop now?" 1 ask.
"Keep going!" Felicia says."Keep going 'til you're
out of frame!"
So I walk right past the camera until my nose
touches the wall.
"Cut!"
The whole film Industry must be like this. It took
about four hours of work to produce Felicia's two
minutes. Of course, we had to ride our bikes around,
packing up the camera each time. But you know
what I mean. So you can see why it takes millions of
dollars and about a year to make a movie. That's if
you're working within the Hollywood system. It's that
much harder If you're an independent filmmaker, be
cause then you have no time and no money.
Now we're back in Felicia's room for the fight
scene. It's unconvincing because I can't act scared.
Paul's not Dennis Hopper. I keep falling down when
I'm not supposed to. and Felicia keeps looking at her
watch.
The next scene is the best. This is where I jump
from the balcony.
But first, a brief digression. I know a couple of
people, Felicia among them, who are planning to go
to film school. I think this is great. Since they're my
friends, I don't even care if they produce trash. I also
read somewhere about a Stanford graduate who
produces pornographic films and is highly respected
in his field. This is great, too. It proves what they tell
you at career fairs — that a Stanford degree can take
you anywhere.
So anyway, I'm perched on the balcony looking
down at Felicia, who's about 30 feet below. I've
climbed out as far as I plan to and she's still filming.
Does she really expect me to ... ?
If you've ever been on the Universal Studios tour,
you know that there are all kinds of tricks you can do
with the camera. Also, there's one part of the tour
where you go in this car over a bridge which starts to
collapse under you. Then when you look back, the
bridge is putting Itself back together. It's a trick,
see? About a week after I went on this tour, I was
home watching "The Bionic Woman" and Lindsay
Wagner drove over the same collapsing bridge. For
me, that was when all the magic went out of the
movies.
Well, we finish the scene out on the sidewalk.
Felicia has me sit down. When she starts the camera,
I spring up. like I've just landed. Actually, it looks like
I materialize out of thin air. For the finale, I hop on
my little ten-year-old collapsible bike and out-pedal
Paul on his ten-speed. If you believe the chase scene,
you'll believe the jump.
Seems like the magic has gone out of this column
as well. There's no real cliffhanger, you see. Life Is
like that. Things dwindle away. But keep watching
this space. In two weeks, I'll be bringing you
"Brushes with Fame."
