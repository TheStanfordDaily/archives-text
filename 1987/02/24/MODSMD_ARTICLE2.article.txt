# Rendering of Reagan Lib. ignites new controversy
## 
### JOHN POLLACK Senior staff writer 
An artist's rendering of the Reagan Library
released last month by its architect has kindled new
debate concerning the library's physical relationship
to the rest of campus. But a Hoover Institution offi
cial said yesterday that recent modifications in the li
brary's design will probably resolve the remaining of
ficial design dispute concerning the presidential ar
chive.
New modifications include the scaling down of a
large auditorium originally proposed and the elimi
nation of a conference room.
The controversial rendering depicts the libraiy as
commanding a prominent position on a ridge west of

Junipero Serra Boulevard. This depiction conflicts
with profile restrictions established by the Board of
Trustees requiring that the library be located in a
small valley behind the ridge.
The rendering also substitutes a single-level
parking lot for the two-level parking deck planned for
the site.
Acting University President James Rosse criticized
the rendering at a Faculty Senate meeting on Feb. 5
for distorting the size and prominence of the library
in relation to the rest of campus. He said he objected
to the use of such drawings for presentation and
fund raising on behalf of the library.
These concerns had been voiced earlier by the

Board oi Trustees, which last
June stipulated that "fund raising
by the (Ronald Reagan Presiden
tial) Foundation not involve repre
sentations" as to the library's
design or size until the lease be
tween Stanford, the Foundation
and the U.S. government had
been negotiated.
"Is it proper for any representa
tions for fund-raising purposes to
go out?" asked David Abernethy,
political science professor and
member of the University's
Reagan Library Committee. Aber
nethy said yesterday he thought
the rendering was inappropriate.
But Charles Palm, head ar
chivist at Hoover, said the contro
versial rendering is out of date. As

a result, the recent debate has
focused on "a design not approved
by Stanford or the foundation"
and is thus irrelevant, Palm said.
He added that the complaints
were the result of "an unfortunate
series of events" in which the
press focused on a rendering in
tended only to show the evolution
of the library's design.
Palm said that the rendering is
not being used for fund-raising
purposes.
The revised plans for the library,
currently being evaluated by the
University, substitute a "multi
purpose" room of 3,000 square
feet for a 4.800-square-foot
auditorium with 350 seats as pro
posed earlier. The trustees had ob
jected to the auditorium on the
grounds that it would not serve
Stanford's academic needs.
Unlike the auditorium, the
multi-purpose room would not

have fixed seating. It would be
used for a variety of functions, in
cluding meetings, round-table
discussions and conferences
planned by various University de
partments, according to Palm.
"We have resolved the last issue
concerning design." said Palm, re
ferring to the reduction in size
and conversion of the large
auditorium.
In addition to this conversion,
the revised plans also eliminate a
1,700- square-foot conference
room proposed earlier.
But while reducing the size of
the large auditorium, the plans
also propose an enlargement of a
smaller, fixed-seat auditorium
from 90 to 150 seats. According to
Palm, this auditorium would be
used for more formal lecture pre
sentations, motion pictures and
videotapes concerning the Reagan
administration.
