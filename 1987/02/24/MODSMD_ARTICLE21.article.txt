"There are as many sides to
modern dance as there are indi
viduals," according to Tony
Kramer, a Stanford dance division
instructor and one of the organi
zers of Dance Week '87.
It Is only fitting, then, that
"modern dance as an aspect of the
American cultural heritage that
most people know little about"
should be the subject of the fifth
annual Dance Week at Stanford.
All this week, "Modern Dance: The
Path to the Present" will be ex
plored from a variety of unusual
perspectives.
The week's scheduled events
concentrate on placing dance in
an historical as well as an aes
thetic context by combining
lectures on the development of
modern dance with performances
by students and faculty.
Co-sponsored by the Feminist
Studies Program, Dance Week

also addresses contemporary is
sues in dance — ranging from the
sociological to the commercial
aspects of the art form — in what
promises to be a lively and
thought-provoking setting.
Dance Week began last weekend
with two concerts featuring the
works of the division's three per
forming ensembles: the Stanford
Contemporary Dance Ensemble,
the Ballet Folklorico de Stanford
and the Dunai International Folk
Ensemble.
Spanning the range of dance
performance opportunities at
Stanford, these groups rehearse
throughout the school year and
perform frequently on campus
and throughout the community.
The concert also Included
original works performed by
dance division instructors and
musicians.
One of the goals of Dance Week
is to expose students to modern
dance as a medium through

which to grow as a creative per
son. As dance instructor Lisa
Arkin explained, "I know a
graduate adviser in mechanical
engineering who encourages
(taking) modern dance classes for
his students because it frees up
thinking beyond (normal) bound
aries. It is valuable for the person
who least expects it."
This year's featured guest,
noted dance writer Roger
Copeland, will give two lectures
during the upcoming week.
Copeland is a contributing editor
to The New York Times and is the
co-author of the widely known text
"What is Dance?" He is an associ
ate professor at Oberlin College in
Ohio and has been awarded a Na
tional Endowment for the
Humanities fellowship for his up
coming book on post-modernist
choreographer Merce Cunning
ham.
Copeland's first lecture.
"Founding Mothers — Pioneers of
Modern Dance," to be given to
morrow at 4:15 p.m. in Skilling
Auditorium, will provide an over
view of the era that first saw
women become a significant force
in the traditionally male-dom
inated arena of choreography. He

will contrast the contributions of
dancer/choreographers such as
Isadora Duncan, Doris Hum
phrey, Ruth St. Denis and Martha
Graham in shaping modern dance
with the post-modern period
domination of the field by male
choreographers.
Copeland will also discuss how
the evolution from emotional
psycho-drama In the early half of
the century to the purely abstract
in dance suggests changing cul
tural stereotypes of gender differ
ences and not just artistic trends.
His second lecture, entitled "A
Curmudgeonly View of the Ameri
can Dance Boom," to be held on
Friday at 4:15 p.m. in Skilling,
will analyze the recent pheno
menal increase of interest in
dance in its varied forms.
Copeland will discuss how
popularization of dance in movies
such as "The Turning Point" and
"Flashdance" all tend toward a
consumerism that arguably
trivializes serious dance.
This lecture will be followed by a
panel discussion with Brenda Way
from the Oberlin Dance Collective
and Helgi Tomassen, director of
the San Francisco Ballet.
