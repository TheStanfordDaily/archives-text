# Bug looks for the TV eye in the sky

Dear Bug Me:
The other day, some oj my
friends and I were sitting
around, inhaling helium Jrom
balloons and singing old Mi
chael Jackson songs when
two questions occurred to us:
First, what is it about helium
that makes your voice go so
high, and, second, can too
much helium cause you to per
manently sound like a
castrated choir boy?
- Aluin the Chipmunk
The director of the under
graduate chemistry labs, Dr.
Kirk Roberts, explains that
helium's very low density and
high viscosity reduces the
resistance of the vocal chords,
which makes them vibrate
faster, resulting in that falsetto
Slim Whitman voice. Don't try
this at home, kids, but you
would get a completely opposite
pitch (the Chipmunks at 16
RPM instead of 78) by inhaling
sulphur hexaflouride, because
of its very high density.
Since helium goes down so
smoothly, it is sometimes used
as therapy for people with
chronic obstructive lung dis
ease, explains Dr. LaPierre of
the Pulmonary Disease Depart
ment of the Medical Center.
This is done by replacing regu
lar air's mix of 80 percent
nitrogen (and 20 percent
oxygen) with 80 percent helium
(and the same 20 percent
oxygen). And as some of you
scuba divers know, this special
helium-oxygen air is often used
for deep-sea diving by merit of
its easier breathability (and to
avoid nitrogen poisoning).
Rest assured, your perman
ent pitch status is safe. Helium
is both safe and inert. As Dr.
Mary Maxwell of the Med Cen
ter's Anesthesiology Depart

ment says, the problems come
more from the lack of oxygen
than the harm of helium.
Picture, if you will, your red
blood cells filled with pure
helium instead of the usual
oxygen. Not a good scene. But

don't worry. In less than five
minutes you will pass out â€”
before your body will let you
harm it permanently.
Dear Bug Me:
Why do local TV news shows
have helicopter traffic reports?
Most people don't have televi
sions in their offices, and if
you're home to watch the
news, the information is
already useless.
- Captain Video
"I agree." says Deborah
Curiel of KRON's news depart
ment. But she does go on to say
that the evening traffic report
segment is a pretty popular
one.
"I think it's aimed at three
groups: those who haven't left
work yet, and do have televi
sions in their offices; those who
want to know if their loved ones
are going to be on time; and
those who are generally
curious."
"A lot of people like to watch
just to see the reporter, Bob,
and to get a neat view of the
city."
