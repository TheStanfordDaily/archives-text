## Tournament a good idea — if USC loses 
### 
Things are winding to a close in the Pacific
10 Conference men's basketball season, and
eyes are starting to turn toward the Pac-10
Post-Season Tournament at Pauley Pavilion
March 5 through 8 — the first year ever that
the conference has had such an event.

The Pac-10 has made a good move in intro
ducing a post-season tournament, and al
though some people feel that not all 10 teams
should be invited — 4-13 USC, for example — I
like the idea. Inviting all 10 teams adds a cer
tain element of chance; granted, USC is not
likely to wind up winning the tournament, but
anything is possible — and sometimes it's nice
to see one of the bottom teams in a league pull
off a big upset and win the conference tourna
ment. It's interesting, it's exciting and it's a
slap in the face to those uppity teams who have
been on top all season long.
Of course, it's not so great if you happen to be
one of those top teams that gets unexpectedly
knocked off by a lowly USC or Washington
State after a year of hard work and achieve
ment. But the top teams will most likely receive
invitations to the NCAA Tournament anyway,
so what's the harm in an Arizona State win
ning the tournament once in a while?

The only real harm that could
come of such an occurence is that
the Pac-10 Is trying to achieve
some national recognition with
the addition of a post-season
tournament. UCLA is really the
only Pac-10 team to earn national
respect, but the days of UCLA bas
ketball dominance and glory
ended well before the inception of
the Pac-10 in 1978, and the league
has been fighting to gain the
reputation of being a good basket
ball conference.
The post-season tournament Is
supposed to help the Pac-10 in
this respect; a USC or ASU win
ning the post-season event and
then getting clobbered In the
opening round of the NCAAs by
someone like Michigan — the
sixth place team in the Big Ten —
is not going to enhance the
reputation of the Pac-10 much.
What the Pac-10 really needs to
perk up its image in the basketball
world is for its strongest teams to
make the NCAA Tournament —
and to win. Or at least beat some
top squads, some nationally
ranked powers. Pac-10 represen
tatives have to stop annually
losing in the first round for the
league to get some respect. The
Pac-10 league winners have been
unable to do this; perhaps an

upstart USC or ASU, playing with
out any real pressure to win. could
pull off a few upsets.
The point is. the post-season
tournament Is the Pac-10 Tourna
ment — and as such, should in
volve all 10 teams. If the confer
ence really wants to avoid a
weaker team winning the event
and getting an automatic NCAA
bid. then perhaps the league
should follow Arizona guard Steve
Kerr's suggestion: Give the NCAA
berth to the winner of regular
season conference play and not
the winner of the po:>t-season
tournament. Then the tourney
winner has a good shot of getting
an additional NCAA bid. but it is
not absolute certainty.
For a second-half finisher like
USC, ASU or even Stanford, win
ning the Pac-10 Tournament in
an upset would be a great ending
for a less than perfect season —
even if that team did not receive
an NCAA invitation. Going Into
post-season play, such teams
aren't realistically looking for
NCAA berths anyway. It's great if
they win the tournament — every
one loves an underdog, and all
that — but the chances of weaker,
often younger teams accomplish
ing much in the NCAAs is
unlikely. Give the NCAA bids to
the squads that have earned them
throughout the long haul of the
season.
