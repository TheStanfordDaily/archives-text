## Tournament a good idea — if USC loses 
### 
Things are winding to a close in the Pacific
10 Conference men's basketball season, and
eyes are starting to turn toward the Pac-10
Post-Season Tournament at Pauley Pavilion
March 5 through 8 — the first year ever that
the conference has had such an event.

The Pac-10 has made a good move in intro
ducing a post-season tournament, and al
though some people feel that not all 10 teams
should be invited — 4-13 USC, for example — I
like the idea. Inviting all 10 teams adds a cer
tain element of chance; granted, USC is not
likely to wind up winning the tournament, but
anything is possible — and sometimes it's nice
to see one of the bottom teams in a league pull
off a big upset and win the conference tourna
ment. It's interesting, it's exciting and it's a
slap in the face to those uppity teams who have
been on top all season long.
Of course, it's not so great if you happen to be
one of those top teams that gets unexpectedly
knocked off by a lowly USC or Washington
State after a year of hard work and achieve
ment. But the top teams will most likely receive
invitations to the NCAA Tournament anyway,
so what's the harm in an Arizona State win
ning the tournament once in a while?
