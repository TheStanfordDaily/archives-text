# Darkness holds off long enough for 10-6 Stanford win over SCU
## 
### ROBERT PORTNOY Staff writer 
After a rough weekend at hellish
Campus Diamond against 13th
ranked UC-Santa Barbara, a
return to Sunken Diamond to face
Santa Clara was all that No. 7
Stanford could have hoped for.
The Cardinal pounded out 10
hits, five for extra bases, in yester
day's 10-6 win over the Broncos.
The game was officially called be
cause of darkness with a runner
on third and one out in the Santa
Clara ninth.
Cardinal starter Rob Wassenaar
went 6 2/3 innings, giving up
three runs on five hits to help
Stanford raise its record to 10-6
on the season. The senior right
hander notched his first win of
the season against no losses.
Catcher Doug Robbins led the
Cardinal with three RBIs, two of
them coming on his double to left
center in the bottom of the first to
get Stanford even at 2-2. The
other RBI was a sacrifice fly in the
third that preceeded the key hit of
the game for the Cardinal.
Third baseman Ed Sprague
lined a 1-2 double to the opposite
field to drive in two runs and give
Stanford a 5-2 lead it would never
relinquish.

part of the game. He got a break

ing ball up In the strike zone and
knocked It down the line to give us
a three-run lead," Stanford Coach
Mark Marquess said.
Cardinal rlghtflelder Paul Carey
also had three RBIs for Stanford,
two on an opposite-field homer In
the fifth and the third on a double
In the eighth, also to the opposite
field.
"He's making more contact now.
He was striking out a lot earlier,
but not so much recently. He can
go the other way real well, and If
you get It in on him he can jerk it
down the line with power, too.
He's a tough out, real dangerous,"
Marquess commented.
After a throwing error by
shortstop David Esquer to start
the game, Stanford settled down

to produce one of Its finest defen
sive efforts of the young season.
Sprague came up with two
shining defensive plays, the first a
nice stab of a ground ball In the
hole. Sprague Jumped up to nail
Santa Clara's Troy Buckley and
get Wassenaar out of a rocky first
Inning In which he allowed a two
run homer by Bronco cleanup
man Gary Maasberg.
Sprague's other big moment
came In the third with one out.
when he fielded a ball to his left
and fired to the plate to nail SCU
rlghtflelder Bruce Powers trying to
score.
Also producing a fine defensive
play was second baseman Frank
Carey. On a ground ball up the
middle in the seventh with a run
ner on second, Carey fired in time
to get shortstop Matt Toole at
first. Carey's play saved a run as
Santa Clara's Steve Koontz fol
lowed with a one-run double.

"Sprague made a nice play to get
that guy at the plate and grab the
one in the hole. We're a lot more
solid defensively this season. On
the whole, I've been quite pleased
with that part of our game."
Marquess said.
This victory, coupled with a win
in tomorrow's 2 p.m. contest at
Sunken Diamond against Pacific,
will be a lift for the Cardinal after
losing two of three at UCSB this
weekend.
"Psychologically, Santa Barbara
wasn't so great. The bus ride
home was tough. It's good to get
right back on the horse the next
day. It was a credit to our team to
come back after a tough loss and
swing the bat well. It will pick us
up mentally for the big weekend
with UCLA." leftfielder Ruben
Amaro said.
"We know that we're a better
team than our record shows right
now. We have a young team and

that's always a factor. We're confi
dent that we can be successful In
the Pac-10. The pitching is not
what it should be right now, and if
we can get both hitting and pltch
lng going a couple times in a row,
that'll build our confidence."
Amaro went 3 for 4. with two runs
scored and an RBI.
"Ruben has played real well for
us. He, (center fielder Toi) Cook
and Robbins have been getting
hits and stealing bases and doing
the things they need to do to pro
vide leadership. They are our older
players, and they've been playing
that way," Marquess said.
Card notes
While Robbins and speedsters
Frank Carey and Amaro were all
thrown out attempting to steal, first
baseman Ron Witmeyer, affec
tionately called "Boomer" by his
teammates, and slugger Paul Carey
each had a theft yesterday.

After a throwing error by
shortstop David Esquer to start
the game, Stanford settled down

to produce one of Its finest defen
sive efforts of the young season.
Sprague came up with two
shining defensive plays, the first a
nice stab of a ground ball In the
hole. Sprague Jumped up to nail
Santa Clara's Troy Buckley and
get Wassenaar out of a rocky first
Inning In which he allowed a two
run homer by Bronco cleanup
man Gary Maasberg.
Sprague's other big moment
came In the third with one out.
when he fielded a ball to his left
and fired to the plate to nail SCU
rlghtflelder Bruce Powers trying to
score.
Also producing a fine defensive
play was second baseman Frank
Carey. On a ground ball up the
middle in the seventh with a run
ner on second, Carey fired in time
to get shortstop Matt Toole at
first. Carey's play saved a run as
Santa Clara's Steve Koontz fol
lowed with a one-run double.

"Sprague made a nice play to get
that guy at the plate and grab the
one in the hole. We're a lot more
solid defensively this season. On
the whole, I've been quite pleased
with that part of our game."
Marquess said.
This victory, coupled with a win
in tomorrow's 2 p.m. contest at
Sunken Diamond against Pacific,
will be a lift for the Cardinal after
losing two of three at UCSB this
weekend.
"Psychologically, Santa Barbara
wasn't so great. The bus ride
home was tough. It's good to get
right back on the horse the next
day. It was a credit to our team to
come back after a tough loss and
swing the bat well. It will pick us
up mentally for the big weekend
with UCLA." leftfielder Ruben
Amaro said.
"We know that we're a better
team than our record shows right
now. We have a young team and

that's always a factor. We're confi
dent that we can be successful In
the Pac-10. The pitching is not
what it should be right now, and if
we can get both hitting and pltch
lng going a couple times in a row,
that'll build our confidence."
Amaro went 3 for 4. with two runs
scored and an RBI.
"Ruben has played real well for
us. He, (center fielder Toi) Cook
and Robbins have been getting
hits and stealing bases and doing
the things they need to do to pro
vide leadership. They are our older
players, and they've been playing
that way," Marquess said.
Card notes
While Robbins and speedsters
Frank Carey and Amaro were all
thrown out attempting to steal, first
baseman Ron Witmeyer, affec
tionately called "Boomer" by his
teammates, and slugger Paul Carey
each had a theft yesterday.

After a rough weekend at hellish
Campus Diamond against 13th
ranked UC-Santa Barbara, a
return to Sunken Diamond to face
Santa Clara was all that No. 7
Stanford could have hoped for.
The Cardinal pounded out 10
hits, five for extra bases, in yester
day's 10-6 win over the Broncos.
The game was officially called be
cause of darkness with a runner
on third and one out in the Santa
Clara ninth.
Cardinal starter Rob Wassenaar
went 6 2/3 innings, giving up
three runs on five hits to help
Stanford raise its record to 10-6
on the season. The senior right
hander notched his first win of
the season against no losses.
Catcher Doug Robbins led the
Cardinal with three RBIs, two of
them coming on his double to left
center in the bottom of the first to
get Stanford even at 2-2. The
other RBI was a sacrifice fly in the
third that preceeded the key hit of
the game for the Cardinal.
Third baseman Ed Sprague
lined a 1-2 double to the opposite
field to drive in two runs and give
Stanford a 5-2 lead it would never
relinquish.
"Ed got a big hit for us at that
part of the game. He got a break

ing ball up In the strike zone and
knocked It down the line to give us
a three-run lead," Stanford Coach
Mark Marquess said.
Cardinal rlghtflelder Paul Carey
also had three RBIs for Stanford,
two on an opposite-field homer In
the fifth and the third on a double
In the eighth, also to the opposite
field.
"He's making more contact now.
He was striking out a lot earlier,
but not so much recently. He can
go the other way real well, and If
you get It in on him he can jerk it
down the line with power, too.
He's a tough out, real dangerous,"
Marquess commented.
