# Darkness holds off long enough for 10-6 Stanford win over SCU

### ROBERT PORTNOY Staff writer 
After a rough weekend at hellish
Campus Diamond against 13th
ranked UC-Santa Barbara, a
return to Sunken Diamond to face
Santa Clara was all that No. 7
Stanford could have hoped for.
The Cardinal pounded out 10
hits, five for extra bases, in yester
day's 10-6 win over the Broncos.
The game was officially called be
cause of darkness with a runner
on third and one out in the Santa
Clara ninth.
Cardinal starter Rob Wassenaar
went 6 2/3 innings, giving up
three runs on five hits to help
Stanford raise its record to 10-6
on the season. The senior right
hander notched his first win of
the season against no losses.
Catcher Doug Robbins led the
Cardinal with three RBIs, two of
them coming on his double to left
center in the bottom of the first to
get Stanford even at 2-2. The
other RBI was a sacrifice fly in the
third that preceeded the key hit of
the game for the Cardinal.
Third baseman Ed Sprague
lined a 1-2 double to the opposite
field to drive in two runs and give
Stanford a 5-2 lead it would never
relinquish.
"Ed got a big hit for us at that
part of the game. He got a break
