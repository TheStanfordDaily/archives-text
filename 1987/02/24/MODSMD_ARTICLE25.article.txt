### JON WEISMAN Staff writer 
Some relief arrives for the Stanford
men's tennis team today.
First, the Cardinal, 3-4 after losing
three straight matches in the National
Team Indoors in Louisville, Ky., last
weekend, enters an easier stretch of its
schedule beginning with today's match
against UC-San Diego at Stanford Tennis

Stadium at 1:30 p.m.
Second, Stanford got some encourag
ing news about two of its injured players,
Patrick McEnroe and Mark Jacobson.
McEnroe received the results of a bone
scan and found he does not have a stress
fracture in his foot, which had been
feared. However, McEnroe will sit out for
at least four weeks to let a strained patel
lar tendon and bruises on the balls of his
feet heal.

"He can't go full blast on his feet or he
could hurt himself more," Stanford Coach
Dick Gould said. "He's a pretty tough kid
â€” if he's hurting, he's hurting."
McEnroe will do light practicing, such
as serving and hitting against the ball
machine. Gould noted that with the Card
inal now facing three unranked teams,
along with playing in the Pacific Coast
Doubles Tournament before an 18-day
layoff, there could not be a better four
weeks for McEnroe to rest.
On the other hand, Jacobson will be re
turning to action for the first time since
Jan. 23 after a successful recovery from
elbow surgery.
"It's feeling really good," Jacobson said.
"I've been playing for a week and a half
now. I've been practicing and playing
really well."
"Before (the elbow operation) I was
really having trouble serving," Jacobson
said. "I was just pushing my serve. It was
hurting for the most part for five
months. . . . (Now) I'm excited to get out
and play.
Jacobson returns at No. 4 singles
today. Jeff Tarango and Scott Moody
remain at one and two, with Jeff Cathrall
moving up to third. Barry Richards and
Eric Peus (replacing Curtis Dunn, who is
nursing a slightly sprained ankle) round
out the lineup.
On doubles, Jacobson will play with
Tarango, Cathrall with McKee, and Moody
with Peus. as Gould makes his 12th, 13th
and 14th doubles combinations of the
season.

what sleepless weekend at Louisville. In

Stanford lost three tough matches, the
second beginning 12 hours after the first
ended, and the third match begining at 5
a.m. PST.
"Today's was a hard practice," Gould
said, regarding the time change. "I
thought we had a great workout today."
"We almost did really well (in Louis
ville)." Gould added. "I've gotten to have a
lot of confidence in this team."
