# Gymnasts look to NCAAs despite loss at Fullerton
## 
### MARK SMOYER Staff writer 
With only five meets left in its season
until the NCAAs, the Stanford men's
gymnastics team is quickly making up
for lost time and hoping that a strong
finish will mean a trip to UCLA at the
end of April for a shot at the national
championship.
Because most team members have
missed at least one meet this season
due to injury, and because one
projected performer, freshman Adam
Forman, has been unable to compete at
all, the Cardinal Is just now at the stage
at which last winter's squad started the
season, according to captain Mike Mat
zek. The team finished No. 3 In the na
tion last year and spent some weeks
ranked No. 1.
"We're sort of condensing the season
into four days," Matzek said, not com
pletely in jest.

Sunday afternoon, Stanford visited
No. 3 Fullerton State. The Titans won
easily. 281-272. This Friday, Fullerton
will be the guest for the second meet of
a doubleheader. While the Cardinal
gymnasts did not expect to win Sun
day. Scott Schaffer said the team
believes it will be in the running to up
set the Titans Friday.
According to Matzek. Sunday's meet
was experimental. "We did pretty well.
It looks like all we need to do is work on
our consistency." Matzek said. "We
added a lot of difficulty for this meet."
Highlighting the competition were
the performances of Fullerton's Eli
Rodriguez and Li Xiao Ping. Rodriguez
won the all-around competition with a
score of 56.4. Xiao Ping, a member of
China's 1984 Olympic Team and a
former world champion on the pommel
horse, scored 9.8 on two events and 9.7
on two others. Due to ankle prob
lems, Xiao Ping has been unable
to compete in six events this win
ter.
Leading Stanford were juniors
Chuck Gerardo and Matzek.
Gerardo, who recorded a 55.7 ear
lier In the season, scored 55.3
Sunday despite a minor wrist in
jury. Matzek went 55.2 to finish
behind Gerardo in fourth place
overall. Bill Barham's 55.8 gave
him second place.
Stanford's top team score came
on the floor where it scored a
season-best 46.45. Gerardo's 9.65
on the pommel horse and Mat
zek's 9.65 on the floor were Stan
ford's top Individual event
routines.
Matzek believes that the Card
inal still has a chance at an NCAA
berth, which seemed fairly defi
nite at the season's outset. The
team's performance at the Pacific
10 Conference championships
will be especially important. The
Pac-10 includes No. 1 UCLA, as
well as defending national cham
pion Arizona State and California,
which is now ranked among the
nation's top 10. Stanford will host
the three-day championships
early in April.
