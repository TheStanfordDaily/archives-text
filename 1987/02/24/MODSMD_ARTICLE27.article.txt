### CHRIS CRADER Staff writer 
BERKELEY â€” The Stanford men's fen
cing team has had many problems this
season, but timing is apparently not one
of them. The men's foil team finally came
together in its last match of the season to
help defeat host California 19-8 on Satur
day, while the women continued to roll,
winning 9-7.
The Cardinal men are 8-8, while the
women are now 12-3.
The men's foil team lost 8-1 to Cal in
November, but won six of nine bouts in
its most productive outing of the season.
"The most exhilarating performance was
from the men's foil team." said Coach
Buzz Hurst. "Today it all seemed to come
together for them."
John Chang. Jeff Marshall and Craig
Ring are all in their first year of competi

lion, but each came through with 2-1
records. Even more impressive, consider
ing their inexperience, is the fact that five
bouts came to the last touch, but the
Stanford fencers pulled out all five.
The men's sabre team put in its usual
stellar performance, winning 9-0 to run
its win streak to 1 1 straight matches. A
pleasant surprise was the fencing of
David Russ. "He was in the (fencing
physical education) classes last year,"
said Hurst, "and he went 3-0 against this
team."
Steve Levitan and Mike Cramer also
were 3-0 and are 45-5 and 38-12. res
pectively, on the season.
The only sour note was the 5-4 defeat of
the Cardinal's epee team. Larry Murk was
3-0 but Hurst was "a little disappointed
with epee."
