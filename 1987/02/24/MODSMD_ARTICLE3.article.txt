### BISHAKHA DATTA Senior staff writer 
Former Florence Moore Food
Service Manager Margery
Copeland has been transferred to
another position due to a series of
disputes and conflicts with United
Stanford Workers (USW) mem
bers. University and union offi
cials said yesterday.
James Keeton, University food
service manager, said he made the
decision to transfer Copeland to
Stern Hall Food Service about two
weeks ago. "There is no demotion
involved." Keeton said.
According to USW Field Repre
sentative Rodney Barnett, the
University finally decided to trans
fer Copeland after workers had
complained for almost two years.
Barnett claimed Copeland
harassed union employees and
treated them disrespectfully.
Keeton said Copeland's treat
ment of workers was an issue in
labor-management disputes at
Florence Moore but disagreed with
Barnett's claim that she was to
blame.
Keeton said "workers were in
volved whose performance was in
question."
He likened the conflict to a bad
marriage, and the resolution to a
divorce.
USW Chief Steward Linda
Crouse said this is the first time
the University has transferred a
manager and not a worker as the
result of disputes. "It's the first
time workers weren't forced to pay
the price for the problem, whether
it was their fault or not." She
called the University's decision
"good management."
Keeton said he didn't know if
this is the first time a manager,
rather than a worker, has been
transferred. Keeton, who has been
University Food Service Manager

for 18 months, said no manager
has been transferred while he has
been here.
Keeton said he had discussed
the transfer with Copeland and
decided it "was the best resolution
to the issues." She wanted to go to
Stern, he said.
At Stern, Copeland will be in
charge of food production, at
which she is "very talented," ac
cording to Keeton.
Both Crouse and Keeton said
the atmosphere at Florence Moore
Food Service had improved since
Copeland's departure.
"People are much more relaxed
now that the tension has gone."
Crouse said. "Everyone was under
a lot of pressure" when Copeland
was at Florence Moore, she added.
Keeton agreed. He said the ten
sion that existed last month has
disappeared. "The conflict has
ended," he added.
Rafael Verbera, head chef and
union representative at Florence
Moore, concurred.
"It's 100 percent better already,"
he said.
Right now. Acting Manager
Joline McQuillan is running the
food service. "1 think she's going
to be a good manager," said Ver
bera of McQuillan.
"She seems to know how to deal
with people. People are going to
give better service."
Verbera said Copeland had a
"vicious way of dealing with
people." He claimed Copeland
played workers off against one an
other, encouraged favoritism and
"built up a group of anti
unionists."
He said one worker who couldn't
stand the pressure quit three
years ago: another opted for early
retirement.
Barnett said Copeland had
