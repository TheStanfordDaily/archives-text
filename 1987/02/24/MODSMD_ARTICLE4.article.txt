# Duke, Stanford act on gift restrictions
## 
### FELICIA PAIK Editorial staff 
While Duke University officials consider
whether to accept a $20 million gift with
specific stipulations, officials in the Stan
ford Office of Development said Stanford
limits prospective donors on the strings
they may attach to their gifts to the Univer
sity.
In December 1986. Duke University Trus
tee Disque Deane pledged a $20 million gift
to Duke. But now university officials are
debating whether to accept the gift because
of conditions Deane has attached, accord
ing to a Feb. 15 article in The New York
Times.
Here at Stanford, the Office of Develop
ment is faced with restrictions on gifts and
donations "fairly routinely," said Vice-
President of Development Henry Riggs.
"However, we like to discuss those poten
tial strings early on. so we won't disappoint
a donor," Riggs said.

In return for his donation to the North
Carolina university, Deane wants to sit on
an executive committee that would review
potential faculty for a proposed institute.
But officials and students at Duke are un
certain whether "the university should ac
cept a gift with strings attached." said
Therese Maher, university editor of the
Chronicle, the campus newspaper at Duke.
Officials at Duke are concerned that
Deane's stipulation might interfere with
academic freedom at that university. Maher
said.
Deane's gift would be the largest contri
bution to the university since James Duke's
endowment of $40 million in 1924, which
enabled what used to be Trinity College to
become a major university, according to
The New York Times.
The Stanford Office of Development must
deal regularly with donors who wish to
place restrictions on their gifts, Riggs said.
"Our policies are clearly defined from the
outset so we can deflect donor prospects.

We are also consistent with the applications
of our policies and are quite rigid." he said.
"We do not accept gifts of a donor who
wants to retain the right to appoint faculty
members or to have a say in the admission
of a student." Riggs explained.
"They (the donors) do not have the right
to pass judgment on who receives a scholar
ship or endowed chair," he added.
The Office of Development does accept
discussion from donors about candidates
for faculty positions or prospective stu
dents, but the University always retains the
final say. according to Riggs.
"Donors are allowed to state their
preferences; in fact, we encourage it," Riggs
said. "For example, a donor may request
what specific field of study in the History
Department his gift will benefit."
Riggs said the acceptance of a gi jy the
Office of Development does not depend on
the amount of money offered.
"Our policies are very clear We are just as

likely to turn down a gift of $10,000 or $1
million or even $10 million (if the restric
tions are unacceptable)," Riggs said.
According to Riggs, there are two other
reasons that gifts are sometimes refused.
"Sometimes a donor wants to give us a
certain amount of money for a new program
or facility, but this new program or facility
is not a high priority for the University,"
Riggs said. "The University does not have
the resources to foster the new program or
facility, and the donor is only giving a start
ing grant, so we usually say No. thank you'
to those kinds of gifts."
"Once in awhile a person will want to
donate a piece of property or a partnership,
but we tend to turn down those kinds of as
sets as well because the University may later
be faced with obligations or extra worries,"
he said.
"For example, the proposed piece of land
may not be marketable later or we may have
to pay taxes." he said.
