Raymond Carver, fiction writer and
poet, read two short stories last night.
Reading in a low, quiet voice. Carver
read "Cathedral." from the collection of
short stories of the same name, and
"Elephant."
Carver's stories often had the audi
ence, packed into Kresge Auditorium,
laughing out loud.
Though Carver is known for writing
about the lonely, desperate lives of ordi
nary people, the two stories he read were
a reminder that his simple, clear prose
is rich with humor and sometimes a
glimmer of hope and discovery.
"Cathedral." one of his most famous
works, describes a husband meeting his
wife's blind friend for the first time. At
the outset the protagonist is prejudiced
and wary of a blind man: "My idea of
blindness came from the movies. In the
movies, the blind moved slowly and
never laughed. ... A blind man in my

house was not something I looked for
ward to."
As the night wears on, the husband
feels left out of the conversation between
his wife and the blind man, who have
corresponded through tapes over the
years. The husband finds himself alone
with the blind man. They turn on a TV
program about cathedrals, and the hus
band struggles to describe to the blind
man what a cathedral looks like. He
gives up. concluding it is impossible to
convey what he sees to the blind man.
At the blind man's suggestion the
husband draws a cathedral and the
blind man holds his hand as he draws.
The blind man tells the husband to close
his eyes as he draws: "His fingers rode
my fingers as my hand went over the
paper. It was like nothing else in my life
up to now."
When the husband has finished
drawing, the blind man asks him what
it looks like. But the husband keeps his
eyes closed, and feels himself somehow
transformed, transcendent. With his
eyes still closed, he answers his blind

friend's inquiry about the drawing "It's
really something."
English Prof. Nancy Packer, a creative
writing instructor, introduced Carver as
a writer who has "brought about a re
naissance" of the short story form. She
described his writing as "taut, imagis
tic, referential."
The central character of "Elephant"
lends money to his relatives. But they
don't pay it back. He sends money to his
mother, brother, daughter, ex-wife and
to his son. He works hard to support his
"payroll." and in comic desperation he
threatens to escape to Australia.
Each family member provides him
with his or her own unique justification
why he or she absolutely needs more
money. His son. graduating from col
lege. claims he cannot bear to live in
"materialistic" America, so he asks his
father to send him more money in order
to travel.
In the end. the protagonist finds

unpaid-for car."
Carver, who held a Wallace Steg
ner Creative Writing Fellowship at
Stanford in 1972-73, has pub
lished six volumes of fiction, in
cluding "Cathedral, "What We

Talk When We Talk About Love."
and "Will You Please Be Quiet
Please."
The reading was part of the
Jean and Bill Lane Lecture Series,
which is sponsored by the Crea
tive Writing Program.
