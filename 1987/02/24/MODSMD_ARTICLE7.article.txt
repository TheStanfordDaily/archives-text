65-mph limit gathers momentum
WASHINGTON — The federal 55-mph speed limit, ignored by
motorists and scorned by many lawmakers, is facing its toughest
test in Congress since it was adopted 13 years ago.
A proposal to let states raise the limit to 65 mph on rural inter
state highways is picking up momentum and even the most ar
dent supporters of the 55-mph limit say they may not be able to
put on the brakes.
Supporters of Increasing the speed limit include President
Reagan, the American Automobile Association, California Gov.
George Deukmejian and many other politicians from the West.
While fuel conservation was the reason for imposing the 55-
mph speed limit, safety is now the main argument for keeping it.
Opponents of the 65 mph proposal. Including insurance com
panies. doctors and trucking companies, warn that setting the
higher limit on rural interstates would cost between 600 and
1,000 lives a year nationally.
Reagan seeks governors' support
WASHINGTON — President Reagan asked the nation's gover
nors yesterday to support a welfare reform package that he will
send to Congress this morning but still faced opposition on some
key issues.
Reagan, addressing members of the National Governors Associ
ation in the East Room of the White House, said that "dozens of
you have shown an eagerness to pursue new strategies." The pres
ident, noting that he was once a governor himself, said states and
cities "are in the best position to find solutions to welfare depen
dence."
The governors, however, have drafted a competing welfare
reform plan, and some said they would lobby members of the
House Ways and Means Committee on it before leaving Washing
ton this week. Their proposal calls for *1 billion to *2 billion in
new spending to combat unemployment, about 90 percent of
which would be financed by the federal government.
Nakasone planning trip to U.S.
TOKYO — Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone was reported
today to be preparing to visit Washington in late April to assure
President Reagan and Congress that Japan will take forceful steps
to stimulate economic growth at home and increase Japan's im
ports.
The report, in the newspaper Yomiuri, came as the Tokyo
Foreign Exchange Market gave a vote of confidence to a weekend
agreement in Paris to stabilize the world's leading currencies near
their present levels. There was no substantial change in the rela
tive value of the dollar, which closed at 153.55 yen against
Friday's 153.77.
Yomiuri said Nakasone. with the trip to Washington in mind,
has already instructed his Economic Planning Agency to draw up
forceful measures to stimulate growth. It said the prime minister
hoped to address a joint meeting of Congress to declare his inten
tion of fulfilling "Japan's responsibility" as a nation with trade
surpluses.
Demjanjuk: 'Ivan the Terrible'?
JERUSALEM — Pinchas Epstein, who at the age of 17 was
forced to remove corpses from the gas chambers of Trebllnka, a
World War II Nazi extermination camp in Poland, pointed across a
courtroom here yesterday and identified John Demjanjuk as the
sadistic camp guard known as "Ivan the Terrible."
Under cross-examination. Epstein, a retired crane operator,
conceded that there were inconsistencies between his testimony
here and statements he made earlier about his experience in
Trebllnka. Demjanjuk's attorney. Mark O'Connor, said his cross
examination was meant to challenge not Epstein's sincerity but
the accuracy of his memory.
The confrontation came in the fifth and by far the most dra
matic day yet of the war crimes trial of Demjanjuk. the Ukrainian
born former auto worker who emigrated to the United States in
1952 and settled in suburban Cleveland. In 1981 he was stripped
of his U.S. citizenship and last year was extradited to Israel to
stand trial. He contends that he is a victim of mistaken identity
and that he was never at Trebllnka.

direction of Iraq's second-largest city.

Shalamcheh-Basra road after killing or wounding 2.500 Iraqi sol
diers In a surprise overnight blitz and foiling a subsequent Iraqi
counterattack.

tanks and air force. "Thousands of Iranian bodies are littering the
battlefield," said a communique issued in Baghdad.
Iraq reported a total of 309 fighter-bomber and helicopter battle
missions. Iran said one Iraqi jet was shot down.

so-called "war of cities" that had claimed several thousand civilian
casualties in recent weeks.
Iraq said that Iran had violated the truce by mounting the at
tack and firing at least 66 shells on residential areas in Basra. Iran

65-mph limit gathers momentum
WASHINGTON — The federal 55-mph speed limit, ignored by
motorists and scorned by many lawmakers, is facing its toughest
test in Congress since it was adopted 13 years ago.
A proposal to let states raise the limit to 65 mph on rural inter
state highways is picking up momentum and even the most ar
dent supporters of the 55-mph limit say they may not be able to
put on the brakes.
Supporters of Increasing the speed limit include President
Reagan, the American Automobile Association, California Gov.
George Deukmejian and many other politicians from the West.
While fuel conservation was the reason for imposing the 55-
mph speed limit, safety is now the main argument for keeping it.
Opponents of the 65 mph proposal. Including insurance com
panies. doctors and trucking companies, warn that setting the
higher limit on rural interstates would cost between 600 and
1,000 lives a year nationally.

you have shown an eagerness to pursue new strategies." The pres

dence."

reform plan, and some said they would lobby members of the
House Ways and Means Committee on it before leaving Washing
ton this week. Their proposal calls for *1 billion to *2 billion in
new spending to combat unemployment, about 90 percent of
which would be financed by the federal government.

surpluses.
Demjanjuk: 'Ivan the Terrible'?
JERUSALEM — Pinchas Epstein, who at the age of 17 was
forced to remove corpses from the gas chambers of Trebllnka, a
World War II Nazi extermination camp in Poland, pointed across a
courtroom here yesterday and identified John Demjanjuk as the
sadistic camp guard known as "Ivan the Terrible."
Under cross-examination. Epstein, a retired crane operator,
conceded that there were inconsistencies between his testimony
here and statements he made earlier about his experience in
Trebllnka. Demjanjuk's attorney. Mark O'Connor, said his cross
examination was meant to challenge not Epstein's sincerity but
the accuracy of his memory.
The confrontation came in the fifth and by far the most dra
matic day yet of the war crimes trial of Demjanjuk. the Ukrainian
born former auto worker who emigrated to the United States in
1952 and settled in suburban Cleveland. In 1981 he was stripped
of his U.S. citizenship and last year was extradited to Israel to
stand trial. He contends that he is a victim of mistaken identity
and that he was never at Trebllnka.
