# Court to rule on juvenile killers
## 
### 
WASHINGTON - The Supreme
Court agreed yesterday to decide
whether the Constitution's ban on
"cruel and unusual punishment"
prevents states from executing
juvenile killers.
In two other actions, the court
agreed to review the constitu
tionality of Virginia's law banning
display of sexually explicit ma
terial to children and rejected the
first constitutional challenge to a
mandatory seat belt law to reach
the Supreme Court.
The death penalty case, from
Oklahoma, will be heard by the
court next term. It involves
William Wayne Thompson, who
was 15 years old when he and
three adults murdered Thomp
son's former brother-in-law in
1983.
Thirty-seven of the approxi
mately 1,800 death row inmates
nationwide have been sentenced
to die for crimes committed before
the age of 18.
Seven of the 38 states with
death penalties set 18 as a mini
mum age; nine states have no
minimum age; and others, such
as Indiana, allow executions for
killers as young as 10 years old.

The case, Thompson vs. Okla
homa, returns the Justices to what
many of them feel is the most emo
tionally draining question they
have to face — and one that has
bitterly divided them for years.
The court had agreed in 1981 to
decide whether the Eighth
Amendment's ban on "cruel and
unusual punishment" barred ex
ecution of a youth who was 16 at
the time of the crime. Th° court
resolved that case without reach
ing the issue.
Since 1982 there have been
three executions of individuals for
murders committed before they
were 18 years old.
Thompson's lawyer, Harry Tep
ker, argued that "evolving stand
ards of decency" counseled
against such executions, and that
"the death penalty for a crime
committed by a child of 15 is
punishment that offends Ameri
can traditions of justice."
In addition, he said in his ap
peal, "the actual execution of such
juveniles is so rare as to be
freakish and irrational."
Oklahoma prosecutors coun
tered that "nothing in the Eighth
Amendment," which bans cruel

and unusual punishment, re
quires a minimum age for execu
tions.
In tills case "the jury found . . .
that the murder was especially
heinous, atrocious or cruel," the
prosecutors argued, detailing how
the victim had been stabbed, shot
and eventually thrown into a river
with a concrete block chained to
his body.
The seat belt case the court
acted on yesterday began when
Elizabeth Kohrig was issued a
traffic citation and *25 fine in
Marion County. Illinois, for violat
ing the state's 1984 statute re
quiring the use of seat belts. She
challenged the law. saying it
exceeded police powers and vio
lated her right to privacy under
the Constitution's due process
clause, but was rebuffed last Octo
ber by the Illinois Supreme Court.
Mandatory seat belt laws have
been enacted in half the states
and in the District of Columbia.
But until yesterday, none of the
challenges to the laws had reached
the Supreme Court.
The justices rejected Kohrig's
appeal, ruling without comment
that it presented no "substantial

federal question.'' Seat belt
proponents said they hoped yes
terday's ruling in Kohrig vs. Illi
nois would sweep aside similar ob
jections based on constitutional
rights to privacy.
Virginia's anti-obscenity law
was in force barely two months
when Alexandria U.S. District
Court Judge Richard Williams
struck It down as unconstitu
tional In September 1985.
The law. banning the display of
material that might be deemed
"harmful to juveniles." even If it
was not obscene, was too broad,
the judge said, and violated the
First Amendment guarantee of a
free press.
The "level of discourse reaching
commercial bookshelves cannot
be limited to what might be appro
priate for an elementary school li
brary." Williams said.
The law was supposed to force
newsstands and bookstores to
hide from view the covers of
sexually explicit magazines such
as Playboy, Penthouse and
Hustler.
