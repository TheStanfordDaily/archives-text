# Traffic circle for cycle safety tested
## 
### JEFF SEINFELD Staff writer 
Campus bicyclists will en
counter a new turn today. Traffic
at Engineering Corner will be
regulated by a traffic circle, con
structed as an experiment by the
Bicycle Safety Committee.
Project coordinator Tom Rich
man of the Planning Office des
cribed the structure as a firehose
filled with water and laid on the
ground in a circle, "like a speed
bump." Several "Keep Right"
signs will indicate the direction
of travel.
The circle will remain for
several days but will be removed
by Friday, Rlchman said.
Throughout this period, the
committee will observe the reac
tions of cyclists at peak times -
"If people go around It, If they
drive over It, or whatever hap
pens," Rlchman said.
A peak time, according to
Rlchman, Is 11:50 a.m. until
noon, or "anytime during class
breaks."
The intersection at Engineer

ing Corner was chosen. Rich
man said, because "everybody
has identified it as being danger
ous," Including committee mem
bers, campus police and Sigma
Chi fraternity members who di
rected traffic there one day, ap
parently as a joke in light of the
problem. According to Rlchman,
It is Impossible to say how many
accidents occur at this site or
whether or not the number Is in
creasing because few accidents
are actually reported, and the
Police Department does not keep
sufficient records.
Although the design belongs to
the committee, members did not
create the circle Independently,
but adapted a design from UC-
Davls Prof. Robert Summer.
Summer, who has studied the
traffic on the Davis campus, said
the original plan came from
DeLeuw Cather, a San Francisco
architecture-engineering firm.
Summer called the Davis pro
ject "very successful." The
original model Is now one of five
on campus. In a formerly
"disasterous" intersection, the

traffic circle does not change the
speed of traffic during non-peak
hours, but traffic has markedly
improved during rush hours.
Summer said.
At Davis, cyclists consistently
"just fell right into (the circle],"
Summer said. "It's interesting
(how it works)," he observed.
"The circular format just picks
people up and carries them
around."
The traffic-control circles.

Summer believes, are the only of
their kind in the United States,
and Davis may be the only college
in the world with such struc
tures. So far. he said, Stanford is
the only other university to ex
periment with this traffic rem
edy.
But the circle at Engineering
Corner is only temporary. Rich
man said. "If it works, we will in
vestigate permanently installing
something there," he said.


A traffic circle will be set up between the Engineering Corner and
the Clock Tower for the remainder of this week in an effort to
reduce the hazards created by this intersection.
