# ASSU sets fee requests
## 
### MONIQUE SCHEER Senior staff writer 
The ASSU Senate voted last night to place
♦677,871 In special fee requests by student groups
on the spring election ballot and held its quarterly
meeting with acting University President James
Rosse.
For the spring election ballot, the senate decided to
split the KZSU special fee requests into two parts,
not to recommend funding for a trip by the Band
early next fall to Colorado and to place a community
service organization on the ballot for the first time.
Special fees are funds students contribute to stu
dent groups. Assessments for the special fees are
decided each year by the results of the ASSU Spring
Election.
According to Senator Jeff Sloan, the main reason
for dividing KZSU's budget into two parts was to
highlight questionable purchases made with stu
dent money, especially since "most of the listening
audience is not here on campus."
The first part of the budget includes expenses seen
as "absolutely necessary" by the appropriations com
mittee, while the second part contains items the
committee deemed non-essential.
"Students need to be able to look at this (new
equipment) and decide for themselves if they are
worth funding," Senator Lisa Hulber added.
Despite KZSU representative John Forster's claim
that "all these items are to provide better service to
the students," a motion to reunify the budget failed
by a nine to eight vote.
In considering the Band's special fee request, the
Senate supported the appropriation committee's
decision not to recommend the Band's trip to a foot
ball game against University of Colorado-Boulder the
week before orientation. A representative of the Band
claimed the trip would "unify the Band" early in the
year.
According to Senator Angela Wood, a member of
the appropriations committee, "we don't feel we can
justify *20,000 for the Band to go party in Colorado
for a week" when other groups' requests for funding
for retreats are frequently not approved.
The Senate decided to include in the special fee
budgets for the first time a public service organiza
tion, Chicanos in Public Service (ChIPS), with a
neutral recommendation. "We're not sure if we ap-
prove or disapprove (of including
public service groups on the bal
lot)," Wood said. The committee
decided instead to let the students
decide if they wanted to fund it,
she said.
The appropriations committee
initially proposed not to recom
mend The Stanford Daily fee
assessment, citing a "really un
comfortably high amount of
salaries" as a primary reason.
Senator Jake Madden pointed
out that "salaries by the hour are
not as great as they seem," and

the Senate decided to recommend
The Daily feeassessmentby a vote
of 9-7.
Student groups can still get on
the ballot by submitting a petition
with signatures from 20 percent
of the student body.
During a question and answer
session, Rosse responded to
criticisms concerning the Univer
sity's planned tuition increase.
"It's not a Stanford problem, it's a
higher education problem," he
said. Rosse attributed the costs of
education partly to increased fac
ulty salaries and partly to costs
such as insurance, environmental
safety measures and new under
graduate majors such as com
puter science.
