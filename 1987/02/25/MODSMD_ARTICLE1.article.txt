# ASSU sets fee requests

The ASSU Senate voted last night to place
â™¦677,871 In special fee requests by student groups
on the spring election ballot and held its quarterly
meeting with acting University President James
Rosse.
For the spring election ballot, the senate decided to
split the KZSU special fee requests into two parts,
not to recommend funding for a trip by the Band
early next fall to Colorado and to place a community
service organization on the ballot for the first time.
Special fees are funds students contribute to stu

committee deemed non-essential.
"Students need to be able to look at this (new
equipment) and decide for themselves if they are
worth funding," Senator Lisa Hulber added.

that "all these items are to provide better service to
the students," a motion to reunify the budget failed
by a nine to eight vote.
In considering the Band's special fee request, the
Senate supported the appropriation committee's
decision not to recommend the Band's trip to a foot
ball game against University of Colorado-Boulder the
week before orientation. A representative of the Band
claimed the trip would "unify the Band" early in the
year.
According to Senator Angela Wood, a member of
the appropriations committee, "we don't feel we can
justify *20,000 for the Band to go party in Colorado
for a week" when other groups' requests for funding
for retreats are frequently not approved.
The Senate decided to include in the special fee
budgets for the first time a public service organiza

neutral recommendation. "We're not sure if we ap-
