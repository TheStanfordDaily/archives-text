# Governors support welfare reform
## 
### 
WASHINGTON - With only one
dissenting voice, the nation's
governors yesterday endorsed a
major overhaul of the welfare sys
tem, emphasizing Job training
and work requirements for those
now receiving aid.
Their newly approved policy
won quick applause from House
Speaker Jim Wright, D-Texas.
who said he hoped to see House
action on the issue this spring.
Wright also indicated Congress
was likely to approve the federal
government paying most of the es
timated additional >1 billion a

year in spending the governors
seek to finance the training, child
care and medical services for
welfare recipients attempting to
move into Jobs.
The resolution was approved by
every state executive at the Na
tional Governors Association
meeting except freshman Republi
can Gov. Tommy Thompson of
Wisconsin. A Republican amend
ment, specifying that higher fu
ture benefits envisaged in the plan
would be financed from the
savings resulting from lower
welfare rolls, brought all of the

other conservatives In the group
behind the policy.
At a White House meeting Mon
day, President Reagan enthusias
tically endorsed the concept of a
contract binding most adult
welfare recipients to seek job
training and employment, but
reiterated his long-held opposi
tion to any form of national mini
mum payment. Gov. John
Sununu, R-N.H., said, however,
that the bipartisan governors'
plan has "significant support
from the administration in most
areas and an invitation (has been

extended) to resolve the small dif
ferences that remain."
On a more cautious note, Vir
ginia Gov. Gerald L. Bailies, a
Democrat, said the agreement
related to "a concept," not a
finished program and warned that
serious disputes on financing and
federal-state responsibilities still
remained to be resolved.
Nonetheless, governors of both
parties hailed the resolution as a
major step toward an emerging
"national consensus" on an over
haul of the welfare system.
