# Reagan ‘forgot’ Iran deal details

### 
WASHINGTON — President Reagan, res
ponding to questions about his changing
recollections of key events related to the Iran
contras affair, declared yesterday, "It's possible
to forget."
Reagan was asked by a reporter whether he
was upset about a report in the New York
Times that he could not remember whether he
approved in advance the initial Israeli ship
ment of U.S.-made arms to Iran in 1985.
"I'd like to ask one question of everybody,"
Reagan responded. "Everybody who can re
member what they were doing on Aug. 8,
1985, raise your hand."
He posed the question during a photography
session at the start of a meeting with educa
tional, religious and community leaders In the
Council for a Black Economic Agenda. He

looked about and said: "I think it's possible to
forget. Nobody's raised any hands."
Reagan's memory of events 18 months ago
became an issue when the Los Angeles Times
reported last week that, in two closed-door ap
pearances before the commission Investigat
ing the Iran-contras affair, he gave conflicting
statements about whether he authorized Is
rael's shipment of arms to Iran in August
1985.
In his first meeting with the commission,
Reagan reportedly said that he had approved
the shipment, a statement that conflicted with
the congressional testimony of his embattled
chief of staff, Donald Regan. In his second
meeting with the commission almost three
weeks later, the president said that he had not

authorized the shipment.
House Speaker Jim Wright, D-Texas, after a
White House meeting Tuesday, said he found
it "appalling" that the president could have for
gotten whether he had taken so important a
step as approving the Israeli arms shipment to
Iran. But he added: "I find it believable that
someone might have forgotten, and if the pres
ident has a lot on his mind, maybe he did for
get."
The commission, chaired by former Sen.
John Tower, R-Texas Is scheduled to deliver its
report to Reagan tomorrow, and whether
Reagan approved the Initial Israeli arms ship
ment to Iran will be a central Issue addressed
by the report.
