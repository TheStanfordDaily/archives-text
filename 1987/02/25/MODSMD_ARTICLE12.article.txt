# Doctor urges international cooperation

Political and economic differ
ences between countries must not
interfere with the handling of nu
clear accidents such as the one at
Chernobyl last April, according to
an American doctor who led a
team of U.S. medical experts to
the Soviet Union shortly after the
Chernobyl disaster.
Robert Gale, a bone marrow
transplant specialist and an asso
ciate professor of medicine at
UCLA, last night showed slides
and told more than 300 people at
Branner Hall about the lessons
that can be learned from disasters
such as Chernobyl.
"A nuclear accident is an inter
national event. It is not the prob
lem of the Soviet Union. It is our
problem as much as it is their
problem." Gale said, noting that
the treatment of victims of such
an accident requires international
cooperation.
"The medical response to such
an accident needs to be interna
tional," Gale said, stressing that
nuclear power is an "international
technology" and a global phenom
enon.
Gale warned, however, that
medical advances are not enough

to deal with future nuclear dis
asters.
"What we (doctors) can do is
limited so the most important
thing we can do is prevent nuclear
accidents," he said.
Preventing such accidents does
not mean discarding the use of
nuclear power. Gale said, noting
that "every form of energy has its
price and it's not a simple matter
of choosing one form over an
other."
"We live in a nuclear age and
therefore we have to learn to deal
with nuclear energy," said Gale,
who is president of the Armand
Hammer Center of Advanced
Studies in Nuclear Energy and
Health.
Despite the accident, the Soviet
Union is committed to using nu
clear energy and has already
reopened two of the three remain
ing reactors at the site of the acci
dent. Gale said. The Soviets have
"tremendous faith in technology
and its infallibility." he added.
The Chernobyl disaster, which
took place at a nuclear power
plant in Priyat, forced the evacua
tion of 135,000 Soviet citizens
within a 35-kilometer radius of
the plant. Thirty-one people died
immediately following the massive
explosion, which was caused by a

combination of errors on the part
of the plant's operators and design
weaknesses. Gale said.
While the disaster may lead to
an additional 350 cases of cancer

among the people who were
evacuated, more than 40,000
cases of cancer throughout the
world could result from the acci
dent, Gale said.
