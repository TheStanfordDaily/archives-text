Stanford is one university where there is
an energetic, ambitious student body, beau
tiful weather year-round and some of the
finest athletic teams in the United States.
Therefore, it is a inexcusable that Stanford's
athletic facilities remain woefully inadequate
for the average student. While varsity ath
letes play on some of the finest surfaces in
the NCAA, the average "weekend jock" is of
ten hard pressed to find an uncrowded or
easily accessible weight room, a swimming
pool not being used constantly for varsity
practices or a lighted tennis court for a
nighttime game.
Stanford has the richest tennis tradition of
any university in the country. Both varsity
teams won national championships last
year, and the varsity courts feature superb
surfaces. Nevertheless, come nightfall, ten
nis has to stop.
Currently, a student who wishes to play
tennis at night must drive across El Camino
to Palo Alto High School. While the school is
not very far from campus, the wait to play of
ten is quite long; it seems as though many
Palo Alto residents also have the urge to play
tennis at night, and the delay to get on a
court can be interminable
Stanford needs lighted courts. They could
be allotted just as they are during the day, on
a sign-up (usually three days in advance)
basis. As spring quarter approaches and the
weather gets even nicer, many students will

crave an athletic outlet after nightfall. Add
ing lights to Enclna or Roble courts should
be done as soon as possible.
Similarly, the current situation at
deGuerre Pool is a travesty for the casual
swimmer. Varsity practices run for almost
the entire afternoon, forcing those who want
to swim laps or just take a dip to either swim
during their lunchtime or come back around
5:30 p.m.
Nowhere is the problem of "tough hours,
facilities lacking" more glaring than in the
weight room, where an obvious lack of equip
ment and short hours force everyone into the
same sorry space at the same time. This
leads to long waits for those who want to lift
and a situation where a decision to lift
depends not on a desire to participate, but
on a calculation of required waiting time.
Without question, Stanford boasts one of
the finest athletic reputations of any school
in the country. Yet, at times, the University's
commitment to casual, non-varsity athletes
is suspect. Stanford should be more
responsive to student input on the issue of
athletic facilities. Let's work to give the
average student/athlete the same high
quality accessibility that varsity athletes now
enjoy. Lighted tennis courts, more recrea
tional pool hours and a new or more heavily
stocked weight room would go a long way in
this direction.
