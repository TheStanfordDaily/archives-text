Condoms do
not stop AIDS
In the spirit of Condom Aware
ness Week, I would like to point
out that condoms cannot be ex
pected to be more effective as
prophylactics than they are as
contraceptives. As contraceptives,
condoms are reported to have a
9.6 percent failure rate (Family
Planning Perspectives, Vol. 14,
p. 2, 1982). That is, women whose
partners use condoms as contra
ceptives become pregnant within
one year. Thus, using condoms
as prophylactics against AIDS is
like playing Russian Roulette
with a 10-chamber revolver.
Condom roulette, if generally
practiced, will slow the spread of
AIDS through the heterosexual
community, which is a desirable
goal. But it will not stop the
spread, and it does not provide
safe sex for individuals. People
who use condoms as prophylac
tics are performing a public ser
vice, but they are not assuring
their own personal safety.
The question which responsible
and selfish people will have to ask
themselves is, "How much risk
am I willing to take?" Despite the
transient risk of false negative
results, it is reasonable for pro
spective and regular sexual
partners to provide and require
presentation of recent proof of
negative HTLV-111 antibody
status. There are free clinics
locally where people can obtain
HTLV-111 antibody test results
rapidly. In addition, the Stanford
University Hospital Blood Bank
has recently adopted a confiden-

tial procedure for releasing AIDS
test results to its blood donors,
upon written request, after a
legally mandated 60-day waiting
period. I am the first person to
obtain AIDS test results by this
new procedure.
For people who acquire new
sexual partners weekly, or whose
regular sexual partner does, the
blood bank procedure will not
provide a fast enough response
time for reliable information. For
people who acquire new sexual
partners no more often than
several times a year, however, the
bank procedure provides a con
venient way to obtain proof of
AIDS antibody status.
To reduce your own personal
risk, therefore, whether or not
you use condoms, be a regular
blood donor, request your AIDS
test results and insist that your
prospective and regular sexual
partners do the same. Then,
when an attractive person asks.
"How are you?" you can honestly
answer, "Negative. How are you?"

to the refusal of members of the
