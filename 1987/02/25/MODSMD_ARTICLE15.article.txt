# Death penalty has public utility
## 
### 
Although I'm certain that Lowell Ungar's mo
tivations for writing the viewpoint (Dally. Feb.
11) are sincere and honorable, 1 found it ill
conceived, confusing and naive. The order of
his priorities leaves me astounded. He appears
more concerned with the murderer's rights of
freedom of speech and religion than he Is with
the heinous crime. Yes, a murderer does
deserve all of the above rights, and certainly he
deserves due process of law — how else are we
to determine his guilt or innocence? He does
not. however, deserve to continue to be a bur
den on society.

By wantonly taking the life of another, a
human being exhibits a lack of value for
human life. That person no longer possesses a
piece of (he "dignity we all share." The life of
the murderer ceases to have any "worth" to so
ciety from that point on. On the contrary, he
becomes an emotional burden on the family
and friends of the victim and a financial bur
den on all of society.
Ungar's strongest argument is that the
death penalty does not serve as a deterrent. 1
agree with him wholeheartedly. The type of
person who would kill, under death penalty
considerations. Is not deterred by anything.
He must, therefore, be prevented from ever
having the opportunity to kill again. Given a
choice between supporting a murderer in
solitary confinement for the rest of his life, to
ensure he doesn't kill In prison as well, or ex
ecution, I would vote for the latter — as obvi
ously most of our society does.

One of the functions of the state is to
preserve society according to laws and modes
of behavior implicitly recognized, if not ob
served by all members. It is therefore within its
scope to minimize any potential threats to its
Individual members. Ungar talks of the "cruel
psychological pain of waiting for execution and
the terrible physical pain of all methods of kill
ing." First, there is no need for executions to
be painful. An injection suffices very ade
quately. Second, Ungar's compassion is
grotesquely misplaced. He might consider
redirecting it to the suffering of an innocent
victim or to the suffering of those he or she left
behind. How can he possibly place the anguish
of a murderer ahead of that of his victims?

The type of person who
would kill, under death
penalty considerations, is
not deterred by anything.

The subject becomes extremely muddled by
Ungar's Introduction of social ills, such as
class struggle and racism. Surely these are is
sues that require much attention and reform.
Discrimination In meting out death penalties
is abhorrent and must be stopped. It must not.
however, detract from the issue of the propri
ety of capital punishment. Ungar introduces
lovers' quarrels and drug abuse as being re
sponsible for "most" murders. He failed to
mention, however, that these are not the cases
which end up on death row. He points out that

only 5 percent of all murders result in capital
punishment and he asserts that this is a dis
criminatory practice. The fact that so few are
actually executed attests to the diligence and
reluctance with which these cases are han
dled.
Bringing in the gun control issue further
discredits Ungar's analysis. Once again he
confuses the issue by referring to lovers' quar
rels, drug abuse and other social Ills.
Criminals have never had a problem obtaining
weapons, legal or not. The debate over gun
control, although interesting, is Irrelevant to
the issue at hand. Perhaps he has attempted to
squeeze too many of his pet peeves into a
single diatribe.
If there were no pervasive social ills perhaps
the homicide rate would decline. Social ills,
however, seem to be very much entrenched in
man's development. Man has been killing his
fellow man as far back as the beginning of re
corded history and continues to do so through
out the world. We don't kill people who kill
people to show that killing is wrong. We kill
people to keep them from killing us. I believe
that most of us. if not all. would kill under cer
tain circumstances. A mother would kill to
protect her child and Ungar would probably
kill to protect his own life. The question then
becomes not if to kill, but rather, when to kill.
If it were not in man's nature to kill, then
surely some positive signs would have emerged
by now. It seems, on the contrary, that the in
cidence of violent crime and of killing is on the
rise, along with social ills. The death penalty Is
not a perfect solution but, then again. It
applies to a very imperfect society.
