# Ideas for the Draw?
## 
### 
Spring quarter of my freshman year, I created a
god. I was about to face the Draw for the first time,
and I felt that I could use all the supernatural help I
could get. So I created the Draw Deity. To the un
initiated, the Draw Deity appeared as a glass mug
with a laughing face etched on one side and a
weeping face on the other. Indeed, the Draw Deity
began its life as a humble receptacle for Mai Tais in
the Polynesian Village of Disney World. But after its
apotheosis, the Draw Deity became a fearsome thing.
I made sacrifices to it; I prayed to it; I begged it for
mercy. Yet the Draw Deity scorned my supplications
and cursed me with astronomical draw numbers for
the next two years. Then last year, the Draw Deity
met its end when it literally exploded all over my
room. The exact circumstances of its demise are bet
ter left unsaid, but I knew an omen when 1 saw it; I
was to be screwed again.

Now, at last, the thought of the Draw lurking In
the sun-drenched days of spring quarter no longer
holds any terror. I may never draw again, and if I do I
will be drawing without hope as an unguaranteed
coterm. The Draw Deity has chewed me up and spat
me out. But, gentle reader, this does not have to hap
pen to you. Some changes, however, will have to be
made.
First, Stanford obviously needs to build more
housing. It is embarassing that such a great univer
sity cannot house all of its students. Harvard, Yale
and Princeton manage to house all of their students,
and anything that they can do we should be able to
do better. Only a school like Berkeley should ask its
students to scrounge for a place to live. But each year
about one-fourth of the undergraduate population
here faces the meat-grinder process of the un
guaranteed Draw. At worst, they end up off campus.
At best, they are separated from their friends and
given random, usually substandard housing. My
own tale is informative: I spent last quarter sharing a
room in Kingscote Gardens about the size of a walk
in closet. Our furniture consisted of a few dozen milk
crates, a loft and the passenger seat from my
roommate's car. All this for only a little over >500 per
month. The room 1 had planned on living in this
quarter was even more interesting. At least it had a
bed, a table and some chairs. It also had an engine,
transmission and four wheels: I was planning on

living in my van in the parking lot of ZAP. Happily,
the Draw Deity smiled upon me at last, and I walked
on. Still, a new dorm or two would solve a lot of prob
lems.
But, given that there is a housing shortage and
that it is likely to continue for some time, we have to
make the distribution of existing housing more equi
table. Probably the best way to do this is to eliminate
the returning-residency priority. The theory behind
returning residency is to preserve the character of
the residences from year to year. In practice,
however, returning residency preserves the charac
ter of only the most desirable houses, while the rest
of us find it that much harder to get a good spot. And
for those of us who drew poorly freshman year, re
turning residency is particularly loathsome. I, for ex
ample, had returning-residence priority to Burbank.
This was quite worthless since it was not possible for
me to do much worse.
Of course, the act of drawing is in itself an awful
process. It is a terrible thing to be filled with hope
one minute and bitter despair the next. On the other
hand, it must be really nice to have your hopes ful
filled, but then I wouldn't know about that. I suggest
a few modest modifications that would make the ac
tual drawing a bit more exciting.
□ Keep the Draw the way it is, except that after the
very last number has been drawn, flip a coin to see
whether low numbers or high numbers are better.
With this method, you wouldn't have to suffer watch
ing the group in front of you leap for joy while you
ponder another year in Stern.
□ Base the Draw on something other than random
chance. Unlock the doors to every campus residence
at 9 a.m. on the first day of registration autumn
quarter. Whoever is left (standing) in a room by 5
p.m. gets to keep it for the year. The strong and the
clever live in Roble; the weak and the stupid live off
campus — very Darwinian.
□ Try to compensate those who draw poorly. For
example, your draw number could be deducted from
your tuition. Or better yet, use personal checks from
Don Kennedy as draw cards. This does not make the
draw any more fair, but I would be more than
* 11,000 richer, so I would not complain.
A more practical — or at least cheaper — solution
is to use a bid system where each student is given a
fixed number of points starting his or her freshman
year. This would allow students a chance to decide
for themselves whether they wanted three years of
awesome housing or four years in the dungeons of
Stern. If nothing else, such a system would eliminate
the need to rely on the temperament of a Mai Tai mug
for a place to live.
