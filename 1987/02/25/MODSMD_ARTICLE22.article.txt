## Stanford jobs are often steppingstones 
### MORTY POSNER Editorial staff 
This Is the third article In a se
ries about careers at Stanford.
Stanford's employees enjoy job
security, generous benefits pro
grams and a stimulating work en
vironment. However, working at
the University is often only a step
plngstone to other jobs, and a un
ion worker claims that "as an em
ployee. it's one of the most anti
worker places I've worked in."
Linda Crouse is chief steward of
the United Stanford Workers
(USW) union, which represents
the University's technical, mainte
nance and service workers.
Crouse Is concerned that Stanford
Is using an increasing number of
outside contractors, notably food
service employees at Tresidder
Memorial Union hired by the
SAGA Corporation and mainte
nance personnel at the Stanford
Linear Accelerator Center, to pro
vide non-union labor.
"Stanford is getting the benefits
of their labor, but is washing its
hands of any social responsibility"
by providing pay and benefits that
are not comparable to those union
members are receiving, Crouse
charged.
"They are taking work away
from the people that are here,"
said steam-fitter Mike Mayo.
Meanwhile, Employee Relations
Manager Felix Barthelemy
defended the University's policy of
hiring outside labor if there is an
increase in demand on the Univer
sity's manpower or equipment.
"The University has always used
outside contractors," Barthelemy
said.
Stanford's professional workers
agree that the University operates
in a much different manner than
private industry, and oppor
tunites for advancement are dif
ferent as well.
Many at Stanford complain that
decisions are made on a consen
sual basis, making the process
slower and more cumbersome.
"There is often an avoidance of
conflict in interactions with other
staff members," said Residential
Education Program Coordinator
Robin Hensley. "Contradictory

feelings and various views don't
surface."
Mary Fasching. who now heads
a personnel consulting firm in
Cupertino, left a position as com
pensation analyst at Stanford to
work at Amdahl, a computer man
ufacturer. She believes that
"decisions are made faster in In
dustry" and that "opportunities
for advancement are somewhat in
creased in industry."
While Fasching said that "there
are limited opportunities for
growth at Stanford," she felt that
working at the University "is a
good training ground" for working
as a professional in the corporate
world.

This opinion was echoed by
Mayo who also believes non
professional employees don't stay
at the University if they can ad
vance more quickly elsewhere.
"A lot of people use Stanford as a
steppingstone. If they don't quit,
they go on to better jobs," Mayo
said.
Compensation Manager Paul
Fearer recognizes the need to
prevent employee turnover.
"We need to be able to keep key
people for long periods," Fearer
said. "That needs to be on the
basis of a solid program of salaries
and benefits." Fearer described
salaries at Stanford as "mid
market overall."
"If you go beyond the local area
we're in a very strong position"
with respect to compensation,
said Fearer. This, however, has
not always been the case.
"In the early '70s, Stanford
salaries tended to lag below the
market" by 5 percent or more, ac
cording to Fearer.
"At about the time Silicon Valley

was at its high growth was about
the time we caught up with the
market," Fearer said.
With respect to compensation in
the union's bargaining unit,
Crouse noted that the salaries of
many union workers are substan
tially below market value and that
this inequity cuts across all job
classifications.
"There's still a lag" in salary,
Crouse said.
At present, the University's pro
fessional staff receives raises
based on a merit system, the sup
port staff (which includes clerical
workers who are not part of the
bargaining unit) through a sys
tem of merit and a step system

and the bargaining unit through a
step system, negotiated at the end
of union contracts.
What Stanford may lack in com
pensation may be made up for in
what are regarded by some as
liberal benefits plans. The Univer
sity currently provides benefits to
over 10,000 individuals that in
clude a choice of several health
plans, a tuition grant program
and a pension plan.
Benefits Manager John Working
said that insurance companies
and medical providers like to do
business with Stanford because of
its "prestige" and "mass buying
power."
"When you sell to Stanford, you
sell the likelihood of larger num
bers buying into the master plan,"
Working said.
The tuition plan, available to
the children of all employees after
five years of service, provides half
tuition to Stanford, or its dollar
equivalent at another institution,
for up to 12 quarters. According to
Working, taking advantage of the

tuition plan makes it "highly ad
vantageous to be here" as opposed
to the private sector.
The pension plan, which differs
for professional and non
professional employees, is a
source of some consternation for
the union, however.
Professionals who take part in a
contributory plan put up 5 per
cent of their salary, which is
matched by the University. They
then have their choice of several
funds in which the moneys are in
vested.
Members of the union's bar
gaining unit have a non
contributory plan which pays 2
percent of an employee's wages for
each year of service upon retire
ment. The rate of return on this
plan is constant, and there is no
element of risk as with the invest
ments in the contributory plan.
The moneys for the non
contributory plan come from the
University's general fund. Mayo,
chair of the union's pension com
mittee, said he believes that "the
return that (Stanford) is getting
on our money doesn't get to us."
Working countered that an em
ployee with 20 years of service gets
40 percent of his or her career pay.
"It's quite a liberal plan. Two
percent of pay is a good target to
supplement Social Security,"
Working said.
Job security at Stanford may be
the best benefit of all in that
layoffs occur at the University
with far less frequency than in the
private sector. However, layoffs
have been known to occur.
"Job security is very good at
Stanford," Barthelemy said. He
said, however, that layoffs are "a
fairly common occurrence" due to
budget reductions or the non
renewal of a grant.
Affecting mainly workers at the
Stanford University Medical Cen
ter, "the number of layoffs we have
in any year is a negligible number
of staff," Barthelemy said.
Mayo agreed that job security at
Stanford and the existence of em
ployment throughout the year
make working here attractive.
"The significant thing is the
year-round employment and no
threat of layoffs," Mayo said.

many union workers are substan
tially below market value and that
this inequity cuts across all job
classifications.
"There's still a lag" in salary,
Crouse said.
At present, the University's pro
fessional staff receives raises
based on a merit system, the sup
port staff (which includes clerical
workers who are not part of the
bargaining unit) through a sys
tem of merit and a step system

and the bargaining unit through a
step system, negotiated at the end
of union contracts.
What Stanford may lack in com
pensation may be made up for in
what are regarded by some as
liberal benefits plans. The Univer
sity currently provides benefits to
over 10,000 individuals that in
clude a choice of several health
plans, a tuition grant program
and a pension plan.
Benefits Manager John Working
said that insurance companies
and medical providers like to do
business with Stanford because of
its "prestige" and "mass buying
power."
"When you sell to Stanford, you
sell the likelihood of larger num
bers buying into the master plan,"
Working said.
The tuition plan, available to
the children of all employees after
five years of service, provides half
tuition to Stanford, or its dollar
equivalent at another institution,
for up to 12 quarters. According to
Working, taking advantage of the

tuition plan makes it "highly ad
vantageous to be here" as opposed
to the private sector.
The pension plan, which differs
for professional and non
professional employees, is a
source of some consternation for
the union, however.
Professionals who take part in a
contributory plan put up 5 per
cent of their salary, which is
matched by the University. They
then have their choice of several
funds in which the moneys are in
vested.
Members of the union's bar
gaining unit have a non
contributory plan which pays 2
percent of an employee's wages for
each year of service upon retire
ment. The rate of return on this
plan is constant, and there is no
element of risk as with the invest
ments in the contributory plan.
The moneys for the non
contributory plan come from the
University's general fund. Mayo,
chair of the union's pension com
mittee, said he believes that "the
return that (Stanford) is getting
on our money doesn't get to us."
Working countered that an em
ployee with 20 years of service gets
40 percent of his or her career pay.
"It's quite a liberal plan. Two
percent of pay is a good target to
supplement Social Security,"
Working said.
Job security at Stanford may be
the best benefit of all in that
layoffs occur at the University
with far less frequency than in the
private sector. However, layoffs
have been known to occur.
"Job security is very good at
Stanford," Barthelemy said. He
said, however, that layoffs are "a
fairly common occurrence" due to
budget reductions or the non
renewal of a grant.
Affecting mainly workers at the
Stanford University Medical Cen
ter, "the number of layoffs we have
in any year is a negligible number
of staff," Barthelemy said.
Mayo agreed that job security at
Stanford and the existence of em
ployment throughout the year
make working here attractive.
"The significant thing is the
year-round employment and no
threat of layoffs," Mayo said.

ries about careers at Stanford.
Stanford's employees enjoy job
security, generous benefits pro
grams and a stimulating work en
vironment. However, working at
the University is often only a step
plngstone to other jobs, and a un
ion worker claims that "as an em
ployee. it's one of the most anti
worker places I've worked in."
Linda Crouse is chief steward of
the United Stanford Workers
(USW) union, which represents
the University's technical, mainte
nance and service workers.
Crouse Is concerned that Stanford
Is using an increasing number of
outside contractors, notably food
service employees at Tresidder
Memorial Union hired by the
SAGA Corporation and mainte
nance personnel at the Stanford
Linear Accelerator Center, to pro
vide non-union labor.
"Stanford is getting the benefits
of their labor, but is washing its
hands of any social responsibility"
by providing pay and benefits that
are not comparable to those union
members are receiving, Crouse
charged.
"They are taking work away
from the people that are here,"
said steam-fitter Mike Mayo.
Meanwhile, Employee Relations
Manager Felix Barthelemy
defended the University's policy of
hiring outside labor if there is an
increase in demand on the Univer
sity's manpower or equipment.
"The University has always used
outside contractors," Barthelemy
said.
Stanford's professional workers
agree that the University operates
in a much different manner than
private industry, and oppor
tunites for advancement are dif
ferent as well.
Many at Stanford complain that
decisions are made on a consen
sual basis, making the process
slower and more cumbersome.
"There is often an avoidance of
conflict in interactions with other
staff members," said Residential
Education Program Coordinator
Robin Hensley. "Contradictory

feelings and various views don't
surface."
Mary Fasching. who now heads
a personnel consulting firm in
Cupertino, left a position as com
pensation analyst at Stanford to
work at Amdahl, a computer man
ufacturer. She believes that
"decisions are made faster in In
dustry" and that "opportunities
for advancement are somewhat in
creased in industry."
While Fasching said that "there
are limited opportunities for
growth at Stanford," she felt that
working at the University "is a
good training ground" for working
as a professional in the corporate
world.

This opinion was echoed by
Mayo who also believes non
professional employees don't stay
at the University if they can ad
vance more quickly elsewhere.
"A lot of people use Stanford as a
steppingstone. If they don't quit,
they go on to better jobs," Mayo
said.
Compensation Manager Paul
Fearer recognizes the need to
prevent employee turnover.
"We need to be able to keep key
people for long periods," Fearer
said. "That needs to be on the
basis of a solid program of salaries
and benefits." Fearer described
salaries at Stanford as "mid
market overall."
"If you go beyond the local area
we're in a very strong position"
with respect to compensation,
said Fearer. This, however, has
not always been the case.
"In the early '70s, Stanford
salaries tended to lag below the
market" by 5 percent or more, ac
cording to Fearer.
"At about the time Silicon Valley

was at its high growth was about
the time we caught up with the
market," Fearer said.
