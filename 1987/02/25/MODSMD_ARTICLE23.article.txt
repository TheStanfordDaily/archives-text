# Recruiting at CPPC is not a mystery
## 
### BRUCE ELVIN 
While recruiters give more
than 8,000 Interviews each
academic year at the Career
Planning and Placement Center
(CPPC), the entire recruiting
process often seems to be a
mystery to many students.
While a firm's name may be
familiar, the actual recruiter
and his role in the company are
often overlooked.
Most of the people who inter
view students on campus are
not Just recruiters. In fact,
recruiting comprises a small
fraction of their duties.
Recruiters usually come from
specific departments in a firm.
Often they are only looking for
applicants who can fill the
vacated spots in their depart
ment.
Ken Rose, Northern Califor
nia sales director for the phar
maceutical manufacturer Up
john, said he "only recruits at
two or three schools a year" for
people who are interested in
careers in sales. Rose said the
majority of his time is spent
"actually directing sales at Up
john."
If Upjohn needs to fill other
positions, Rose is not involved
in the hiring process.
Similarly, Dennis Lowe, a
senior engineer at Pacific Gas
and Electric (PG&E), said he
also only recruits "maybe twice
a year." The rest of the time, he
does technical work. At PG&E,
he said, "the people who actu
ally do the interviewing are all
technical people, including
myself."
John Malecki is a software
manager for Silicon Compilers,
a small, high-tech computer
company. Malecki said he
spends "about two days a year
recruiting and most of the time
doing actual engineering
work." He came to Stanford to
fill two openings In his depart

ment, although he did do some
Interviewing for other depart
ments with which he was
familiar.
The amount of Influence the
recruiters have In the decision
to pursue students who inter
view varies. Rose and Lowe
both have a great deal of Influ
ence in such decisions, as they
are senior members of their de
partments. Lowe said he
decides which applicants he
sees will be pursued.
"Only about 50 percent of the
applicants get past the initial
Interview," Lowe concluded.
Rose also decides who will be
contacted later on.
The recruiters all have a good
idea of the personal qualities
they want to find In future
employees.
Rose said he "looks for people
with integrity, intelligence and
mental acuity. They must also
be goal- and people-oriented.
To be a good salesman, you
can't be shy either."
Lowe said his interviews are
"very personal." Grade point
average and the classes taken
are very important. He prefers
to see most classes taken for a
grade.
"I try to search for a students'
motivation," Lowe continued.
"I also look for accomplish
ments and challenges that they
have overcome or have solved."
Employees must also be "team
players," he said.
During interviews, Lowe
likes to ask basic, technical
questions. For instance, he ex
pects the electrical engineers
he Interviews to know "why
electrical systems are
grounded." They should also be
able to "explain the difference
between power and energy, and
know the definition of a volt."
Interviewing students, the
recruiters all agree, is a pleas
ant change from their usual
duties.
