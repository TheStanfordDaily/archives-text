## A 						powerful Nigerian ‘Rage' 
### JULIET JOHNSON 
Traditional music and dance,
elaborate costumes, impressive
acting and a powerful story make
up "Farewell to a Cannibal Rage,"
by Nigerian playwright Femi
Osofisan . Presented by the Stan
ford Department of Drama and
the Committee on Black Perform
ing Arts, this adaptation of the
"Romeo and Juliet" tragedy
represents a joint effort by profes
sionals and students alike to
bring the humorous, yet critical,
production to Stanford.
The play recounts the tale of
Akambi and Olabisi, two lovers
who return from the city to their
native village only to find their
families involved in a blood feud.
They are ordered to separate, but
cannot bring themselves to do so.
While talking with her mother,
Olabisi discovers that a Western
speculator desiring their lands for
a mechanized farming project
spread the rumors that initiated
the current blood feud. Thus, two

themes run throughout the play.
In the first, the lovers symbolize
the need to break away from the
violent traditions of the past. "We
belong not to the blood of the
past," declares Olabisi, "but to the
world of the present."
The second, more sobering
theme is that of the Western
takeover of Nigeria. Playwright
Osofisan demonstrates this prob
lem most dramatically in a story
the village priest Baba Soye (Keith
Archuleta) tells Olabisi to con
vince her of the dangers of marry
ing Akambi. In the story. Simbi
(Bevanne Bean) is bewitched by a
handsome European (Christian
Hull). The man strings her along
until they arrive at a graveyard.
There she sees him as he really is
— a money-laden crocodile who
cares only for what she can pro
vide him. Simbi represents the
Nigerian people, tricked into
losing their self-government by
the promises of bounty from the
West.
The play is performed in

Memorial Auditorium, which has
been converted into a theater-in
the-round especially for the occa
sion. John Wilson's set design is
as simple as his costumes are
elaborate. The costumes play an
important role in the play, for the
actors in the principle parts
switch characters often. Since
most of the natives wear similar
costumes, this causes little confu
sion. Only the European charac
ters are distinctively dressed,
which emphasizes that they don't
belong in the village.
The musicians in the back
ground are very impressive. They
play several kinds of drums, a
wooden xylophone and various
small instruments extremely well.
This, combined with the extensive
singing and dancing of the entire
cast, creates the feeling that the
audience is actually In the
Nigerian rain forest, seeing a
legend recounted.

Jawanza Osayimwese and Allison Johnson are featured in Nigerian playwright Femi Osofisan's "Farewell
to a Cannibal Rage," running this week in Memorial Auditorium.
Osmare is a bit repetitive, but this
is a characteristic of African
dance. More important is the
vitality and pure enjoyment of life
communicated through the dan
cers and the music. Several of the
dancers are excellent, and an ob
vious amount of time and care has

gone into their performances.
The acting itself is solid as a
whole, with a few outstanding per
formances sticking out. In partic
ular, watch for the second Olabisi
(Allison Johnson) and her mother
(Kimberly Mitchell). Both are con
vincing in their roles and together
they create a close, realistic
mother-daughter rapport. John
son projects the enthusiastic
pride and stubbornness of her
Juliet-like character, while

Mitchell brings out the conflicting
emotions of love, sorrow and ven
geance in her complex character.
Sandra Richards provides pro
fessional direction for the play,
which flows smoothly from one
scene to the next and has little of
the awkward positioning of char
acters typical of many amateur
productions. Since Richards
worked with the playwright at the
University of Benin, it's a safe as
sumption that her interpretation

of the play is consistent with that
of Osofisan. In any case, the sym
bolism and power of "Farewell to a
Cannibal Rage" comes through to
the audience.
The play, which on the surface
seems like an uninhibited party
on the stage, will remain in your
thoughts long after the last shouts
of the dancers fade away.
"Farewell To a Cannibal Rage"
runs tonight through Saturday at
8 p.m. in Memorial Auditorium.
