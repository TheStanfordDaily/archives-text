# Lou Gramm goes solo
## 
### DAVID KANG 
Although his name may be
relatively unknown, Lou
Gramm's voice is easily recog
nizable from his work with For
eigner, one of the most success
ful hard- rock groups to date.
Gramm's throaty lead vocals
are an integral part of the For
eigner sound, bringing a
needed sense of directness and
urgency to guitarist/songwriter
Mick Jones' arrangements.
Gramm's debut solo album
"Ready or Not" offers a counter
point to Jones' increasingly
structured songwriting,
presenting a leaner sound
which is somewhat reminis
cent of early Foreigner. The al
bum is a solid, though un
surprising, package of album
oriented rock that should
satisfy most hard- rock and
Top-40 listeners.
Gramm's record differs from
Foreigner's albums in both lyri
cal and musical content. For
eigner's music tends to be very
serious, with lyrics that are oc
casionally distinguished by
misogynistic overtones. On his
new album, Gramm ap
proaches songs from more of a
"dirty white boy" perspective,
leaning toward full-tilt bursts
of adolescent fury.
Musically, this solo project is
aided most notably by guitarist
Nils Lofgren, whose concise,
fusion-influenced leads are
backed by the solid drum work
of Lou's brother, Ben Gram
matico. Significantly, the
record doesn't rely on the use of
heavy keyboard textures or
lush production values; the
result is a complete but
economical sound.
"Ready or Not" should yield
several hit singles, including
"Midnight Blue," which is
already receiving considerable
local airplay. Other notable

cuts include the pulsing title
track, the haunting ballad "If I
Don't Have You" and the
straightforward rocker "Arrow
Through Your Heart." The
record's greatest strength by
far is Lou Gramm's voice, one
of the most distinctive and
powerful in rock today.
Gramm's direct delivery
insures that he won't be
grouped with the many face
less, squeaky-clean solo artists
who have recently dominated
the Top 40. Just as he does
with Foreigner, Gramm brings
to this record a strong sense of
candor and conviction. His
voice and attitude come
through loud and clear,
making this a very respectable
solo debut.

Meanwhile, Mick Jones has
assembled the Foreigner crew
in New York City, and they, in
cluding Gramm, are reportedly
midway through the produc
tion of their next album,
which, in Gramm's words, will
be "very hard, very guitar
oriented." Expect it sometime
this fall, although a potential
Gramm solo tour could push
that date back. Until then.
"Ready or Not" should keep For
eigner fans happy, as well as
provide some needed recogni
tion for Gramm's superlative
vocal ability. It's well worth a
listen.
