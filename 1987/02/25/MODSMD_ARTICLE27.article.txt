# Iron Maiden’s heavy metal extravagance
## 
### LIZ GOODMAN 
The Oakland Coliseum may
seem an unlikely site for a space
launch, but for heavy metal band
Iron Maiden, there's nothing un
usual about that location.
In their typically theatrical style,
these British hard rockers
brought their current tour here
last Saturday night, this time
with a slightly futuristic edge.
Beginning the concert with the
song "Caught Somewhere in
Time," inflatable shuttles took off
from each side of the stage, pass
ing only feet above the audience,
while an astronaut descended
from the ceiling.
Lead singer Bruce Dickenson
then appeared wearing a "ready
for-star-travel" vest covered with
flashing light bulbs. Amid a flurry
of explosions and flashing lights,
the rest of the band then joined
Dickenson. Although such extrav
agance may sound a bit on the
corny side, neither the band nor
the fans seemed to think so.
Consistently sold-out concerts
on this "Somewhere on Tour" tour
and a capacity crowd showed that
Iron Maiden, without the help of
radio airplay, is quite popular
among a certain segment of the
population. What's most striking
about the Iron Maiden following,
however, is its seriousness.
Several fights broke out before
the concert, as fans tried to climb
closer to the stage and there was a
general sense of turmoil in the
crowd. But Dickenson was not
about to let a potentially violent
situation get out of hand. After
the first song, he stopped the
show and advised the crowd
against fighting and throwing
things, encouraging everyone to
just "have a good time."
Once the music began again,
fans on the floor tamed their
pushing and shoving as they
settled into the usual head
banging and fist-waving.
For the untrained ear, it might

be difficult to distinguish between
the various numbers in the Iron
Maiden repertoire because the
group plays a stripped-down form
of hard rock, devoid of any of the
gimmicks of catchy (and often
shallow) pop songs. Iron Maiden
instead goes for longer, more
musically explorative and lyrically
complex (yes folks, you heard it
here first) pieces.
Bassist Steve Harris is the most
notable musician in the band, and
he rightfully took the center of at
tention Saturday night along with
Dickenson. Guitarists Dave Mur
ray and Adrian Smith, and drum
mer Nicko Mcßrain each had a
turn in the spotlight, however.
Many of the songs performed
were from their latest album,
"Somewhere in Time." including
"Wasted Years" and "Heaven Can
Wait." During "Stranger in a
Strange Land," members of the
road crew joined the band on
stage to sing the chorus.
At one point in the show, the
Iron Maiden mascot, "Eddie,"
made an appearance. Sporting a
high-tech design and looking
much more like the "Terminator"
than in past tours, the 13-foot
creature and Dickenson at times
exchanged laser fire.
A large portion of the 90
minute-plus show was also com
prised of earlier Maiden favorites.
A few songs were from the
"Powerslave" album, but others
included "The Number of the
Beast" and the final song before
the three encores, "Iron Maiden,"
during which huge inflatable
hands rose to support small plat
forms, lifting Dickinson and Har
ris above the stage.
Accordingly, a show that began
with elaborate props ended the
same way. In all, it takes seven 45-
foot trucks and five buses to
transport such equipment
around. But to Iron Maiden, who
rely primarily on touring for expo
sure, such extravagance seems to
have paid off.
Having been the first major

Western rock act to play behind
the Iron Curtain. Iron Maiden's
stage presence led to the schedul
ing of return performances in
Yugoslavia, Czechoslovakia, Hun
gary and Poland for the second
time on this tour. For the first
time, the group was invited to play

Gdansk, home of the Solidarity
movement.
This current tour, which began
in September, will continue well
into May. and if you missed the
Oakland show (for shame!). Iron
Maiden will be coming to the
Shoreline Amphitheater May 4.

Is it an ME project gone amok? No, it's Eddie, the "mascot" of British
hard-rock band Iron Maiden. Eddie strutted his stuff at the Oakland
Coliseum last Saturday night.
