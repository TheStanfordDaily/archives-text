# ‘Over the Top’:$12 million worth of Stallone
## 
### KAI KEASEY 
I went to "Over the Top" expecting a Sylvester
Stallone movie. You know the feeling: You expect ac
tion, minimal plot, Stallone getting down and then
coming from behind to win and then trying to justify
it with a patriotic speech. Unfortunately, I got just
what I expected, with a few changes that I imagine
are obligatory so that Stallone's movies aren't all the
same.
The minimal plot was definitely there. Stallone,
playing a truck driver named Lincoln Hawk, picks up
his son (David Mendenhall) at a military school
graduation after not seeing him for 12 years.
Stallone tries to get to know his son in the ensuing
truck drive to California, and there tries to regain
custody of him after the boy's grandfather (Robert
Loggia) forces Stallone to give up custody. To ac
complish this feat, and I kid you not. Stallone must
win a world arm-wrestling championship.
The differences that separate this from other
Stallone movies are small. Instead of impressing or
saving a girl, Stallone impresses his son. and instead
of a boxing match it's an arm-wrestling match. The
similarities, however, are great: Stallone scorned by
everyone. Stallone flexing his muscles, Stallone
driving fast. Stallone confident until right before the
big match. Then, as usual, he gets a boost in confi
dence from that Important person. There's even a
death midway through the film, a la "Rocky III" and
"IV."
The writers (whose work was re-written by
Stallone) and director Menachem Golan do try to
develop the plot more than is usual in a Stallone film,
but each try falls Just a little short. They touch upon
the reason why Stallone's character left his wife and
son, but It's never fully explained. They also rush the
scene where Stallone signs over custody of his boy.
He doesn't have to do what he does, but the scene
isn't explained at all. There's also a small kidnapping
attempt on the boy that's never fully explained
either: Its only purpose is to give Stallone a reason to
drive fast.
As I expected, all of the characters, with one excep

tion, were one-dimensional — either good or bad.
Stallone, of course, is good. His wife, seen for all of
five minutes, is good. Her father, the main villain,
and all his flunkies are bad. All the arm-wrestlers are
bad. The only person who shows any depth of char
acter is Stallone's son, Michael. He starts out very an
tagonistic toward his father, even complaining to be
sick at one point so that he can run away. He
changes enough to begin enjoying and accepting his
father, reverts back to antagonism after the death of
his mother and then finally accepts and longs for his
father at the end. The film makers try to deepen the
plot with this wavering between good and bad in the
boy. but they fall by rushing each change in his char

acter. The changes Just aren't convincing and aren't
developed enough for my taste. The dialogue between
Stallone and his son Is forced, and although It had
some good moments. Just wasn't riveting.
So I didn't expect much plot or meaningful charac
ters, but I did expect some action. There was some,
and I freely admit that 1 enjoyed the arm-wrestling
tournament, but overall there wasn't enough action
for a movie selling only Stallone's body and action.
I'm not complaining about what action there was: it
was definitely the best part of the movie (and better
than the action in "Cobra"). It just didn't fill the void
created by the failed plot.

The acting, as it seems to be in all Stallone movies,
is functional. Each actor plays his part in a one
dimensional mold, with nothing added to fill out the
role or to give any sense of feeling. Robert Loggia is as
mean and tough and conniving as his part calls for
and nothing more. 1 liked him better in "Jagged
Edge." Stallone remains stationary in his acting ex
pertise, moving neither backward nor forward. The
best job was probably done by Mendenhall as the boy
who. although not good himself, is better than
anyone else in the movie.
"Over the Top" doesn't have a great line to save it
like "Go ahead, I don't shop here" from "Cobra"
(delivered when a criminal is about to blow up a
shopping mall), but it does have some good parts.
Stallone's clip-on tie is a nice touch, and the antics of
the arm-wrestling competitors are original and
funny: one competitor drinks motor oil to psych out
Stallone (he's later seen taking Alka-Seltzer).
But these small bits don't make up for the movie's
overall shoddiness. It's the type of movie that with a
little work could have been acceptable. For one thing,
it's less than 90 minutes long, so everything in it
seems rushed. If another 10 to 15 minutes had been
added to flesh out and explain the promising plot
twists already mentioned, and if the dialogue were
polished up a bit more, it would have been much bet
ter. Expanding on the plot twists would have made
the movie less predictable. As it is, a friend and I
predicted everything that happened.
Stallone was paid *12 million for eight weeks' work
making the film. I decided to do a little calculation to
see just how astronomical this was. He made *39 a
second if he worked 12 hours per day, seven days a
week. At thai rate, he made • 100 in two and one-half
seconds and could pay for a year at Stanford after
6.72 minutes. Wow!
In closing, if you like Stallone, you'll like this movie
and should see it. If you don'i like Stallone, but just
failed two midterms and have a research report due
in a week, you should go see it. And if you don't like
Stallone, don't see it, and only think of renting it
when it comes out on video if you want to see arm
wrestling action.

tional video for "Over the Top," for which Hagar sings the theme song. Take careful note of Stallone's
biceps: They're worth *12 million.
