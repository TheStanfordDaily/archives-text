## Questions in search of answers 
### 
Just some random questions in search of
answers:
Why did a representative from the National Invi
tational Tournament call Stanford Sports Infor
mation Director Steve Raczynski asking for infor
mation on the Cardinal? Are they really interested
in a 13-12 team, or do they get some kind of
warped enjoyment out of taunting a team like
that?

Does anyone really think UCLA will not win the
Pacific 10 Conference tournament at Pauley
Pavilion?
Will this be the year a Pac-10 team wins an
NCAA tournament game?
Why does the Stanford Band sit at the end of
Maples Pavilion nearest the Stanford bench?
Wouldn't it make more sense to have them next to
the visitor's bench, blasting away while Stanford
opponents plot strategy during timeouts?
Why doesn't women's basketball have a 10-
second count in the backcourt? And why don't
they change from a 30-second to a 45-second shot
clock?
When is the last time the Axe Committee did
something original and humorous? Could we
recruit some students from Duke to take its
place?
Why put condom dispensers in libraries? Do
people really use them there? Or is that what
those little rooms in Green Library are for?
