# Hotel complex faces obstacles

A proposed 300 to 350 room hotel and con
ference center near Sand Hill Road and High
way 280 still must overcome bureaucratic
hurdles and protests by residents, according
to University officials and local residents.
Two weeks ago, the University Board of
Trustees voted to negotiate a proposal with
Westin Hotel Co. of Seattle. Westin was one of
the five hotel chains that agreed last July to
submit development proposals to the Univer
sity.
The Westin proposal includes plans for the
hotel and conference center to be located on a
21-acre tract of Stanford land near the inter
section of Sand Hill Road and Highway 280,
according to University Director of Housing
and Development Niel Davidson. He cautioned,
however, that final plans for the hotel are still
being negotiated between the University and
Westin. "First we have to reach an agreement,"
he said.

According to Davidson, Westin would like to
start developing the land, which lies immedi
ately to the east of Highway 280, but the com
pany realizes that "nothing ever happens
quickly."
According to Menlo Park Councilwoman Jan
Lafetra, "Menlo Park has not officially been
notified (of the hotel proposal)." The Menlo
Park City Council must approve the hotel
plans before construction can commence.
"This is the first serious proposal (for use of
the land)," said Lafetra, adding that the Menlo
Park City Council is "staying open to
ideas. . . . Menlo Park is in no hurry."
Carol Tinsley, chairwoman of the Sharon
Heights Homeowners Association, said a
major problem with the proposed hotel and
conference center is that it may increase traffic
on Sand Hill Road and Willow Road, which in
turn may filter into the Sharon Heights resi
dential area.
Citing information contained in an environ
mental impact report on the hotel which was
recently filed by the Menlo Park Planning

Council, Tinsley said hotel developers "would
have to widen the road (Sand Hill) all the way
down" to Alameda Street.
According to Tinsley. the traffic problem
where Sand Hill Road narrows to two lanes
near the intersection with Alameda is already
acute, and the new hotel would worsen the
problem.
"Just a little bit more traffic will extend the
peak hour and make more delays," said Paul
Wilson, a member of the United Menlo Park
Homeowners Group.
Tinsley said she is appointing a committee
of the Sharon Heights Homeowners Associa
tion to keep residents living near the proposed
hotel site aware of plans for the hotel as they
develop.
Although Tinsley said her group's purpose is
mainly to keep residents informed, she added
that the large size of the homeowners associa
tion may give the group bargaining power
when the issue reaches the Menlo
Park Planning Commission in a
few months.
According to Lafetra, the hotel
proposal must go through several
bureaucratic channels before

ground can be broken. First, the
University must approve the plan.
Next, the proposed site must be
re-zoned and a final environmen
tal impact report has to be filed.
"People would have to be con
vinced that it is the best use for
the land and that the traffic would
be mitigated," Lafetra said.
