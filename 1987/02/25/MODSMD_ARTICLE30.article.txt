# Amaro's hitting, Price's pitching help Card cruise through Pacific
## 
### ROBERT PORTNOY Staff writer 
After Monday's 10-6 win over Santa
Clara, Stanford needed a victory yesterday
to stay hot for this weekend's conference
opening series at UCLA. What it got was a
rout.
Led by the second straight three-hit per
formance from left fielder Ruben Amaro,
No. 14 Stanford pounded Pacific 10-2 at
Sunken Diamond to move to 11-6 on the
season. Amaro, who scored two runs and
knocked in one Monday against Santa
Clara, hurt Pacific with three RBl's on two
doubles and a single.
"Amaro's been playing real well, hitting
the ball hard and doing the things we ex
pect of him. He's very capable of knocking
people in when he gets the chance. He'll get
four or five homers in a season, and he can
hit the ball a long way. He'll surprise you,"
Stanford Coach Mark Marquess said.
Amaro, the Cardinal lead-off hitter, is
counted on primarily to get on base and
score runs.
"I don't know why I don't hit in the three
hole," Amaro said jokingly.
"They want to keep me off base and I have
such great hitters behind me, they throw
me fastballs. I've been able to hit them with
some juice with runners in scoring posi
tion. They don't want to walk me when (Toi)
Cook, (Doug) Robbins and (Ed) Sprague are
going to drive them in anyway. They'll take
their chances with me."
Cardinal starter Jim Price tamed the
Tiger bats, allowing just two runs on five
hits in six innings of work. Price fanned
eight and walked two in moving his record
to 2-0. Mark Carper threw the last three in
nings for Stanford, giving up no runs on
three hits while striking out three.
"Price can pitch better than that, but
overall It was a pretty good outing. He
finished strong. He was having trouble get

ting the breaking ball over to go with his
fastball. After the third or fourth inning, he
started to get it over," Marquess said.
Indeed, it was the breaking ball that got
Price in trouble early. With one out in the
first, a curve that bounced in the dirt per
mitted Pacific's shortstop Beau Hill, who
had doubled, to advance to third. Hill
scored on a groundout to first by first
baseman David Atterbery to give Pacific a
shortlived 1-0 lead.
In the second, another wild pitch and a
passed ball put Tigers Vince Brigman and
Derek Gross at second and third with one
out. Price struck out Perry Manley and Den
nis Kula to end the inning. The other run
Price allowed came on a leadoff homer by
clean-up man Joe Ortiz in the sixth.
Stanford put to rest any hopes of a Tiger
upset in the four-run second and the three
run third. First baseman Sprague doubled
with one out in the second and designated
hitter Scott Delucchi tripled him home.
After a Frank Carey groundout, Paul Carey
hit a two-strike nubber down the third-base
line that was mishandled and went for a
base hit and an RBI. Third baseman Brian
Johnson walked, setting the table for
Amaro's two-run double.
Center fielder Cook led off the third with a
single. Robbins, the catcher, follwed with a
fly ball to left that was dropped on the run
by Jeff Jones for an error. Sprague, with
the runners going on a 1-1 pitch, grounded
to short, advancing them to second and
third. After Delucchi struck out, second
baseman Frank Carey stroked a single up
the middle to score two. Paul Carey then
chopped one at second baseman Manley,
whose throw to first was mishandled by
pitcher Renny Thompson for an error.
Three runs, all unearned.
"I started the season with Frank in the
top of the order, and since I've moved him
