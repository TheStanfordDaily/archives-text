# Injury-plagued netters fall to USD
## 
### JON WEISMAN Staff writer 
Asking a coach about his team's injuries after a
loss is like asking an undergraduate about his or her
draw number after getting placed in Florence Moore
Hall. Even though It's out of his control. It's just
something he doesn't want to mention.
But just as bad luck in the draw can place you in a
mediocre residence, so can bad luck with Injuries
hurt your team. That's what happened to the injury
riddled Stanford men's tennis team as it lost its
fourth in a row yesterday, 6-3, to the University of
San Diego.
Patrick McEnroe (knee and feet), Geordie McKee
(elbow and feet) and Curtis Dunn (ankle) all missed
yesterday's match, while Mark Jacobson made his
first appearance in a month for the Cardinal, which
fell to 3-5.
Stanford Coach Dick Gould, as any coach would,
dismissed the injuries as "part of the game." When
pressed, however, he did concede their impact.
"When you catch some injuries like we have, it
slows you down," Gould said. "On a team that's a
little short on experience, that hurts."
Despite trailing 3-1, the Cardinal was not beaten
yet. as Eric Peus led in the third set of his match and
Jeff Cathrall led in the second set of his.
Peus. a freshman playing his first singles match
for Stanford, won the last two games of the match 4-
3, the last on a double fault, to beat San Diego's Don
Mattera, 6-2, 3-6, 6-3.
"I was a little nervous and tight at the end of the
match because 1 wanted to keep it going for us into
doubles," Peus said, "but I wasn't really thinking
that this is my first match for Stanford."
Meanwhile, in a second set tiebreaker, USD's Scott
Patridge tied Cathrall after being down 5-1, only to
lose the next two points and the set.
In the third set. Patridge broke Cathrall's serve at
5-4 despite the Stanford freshman's second ace of
the set. Patridge then took the next two games to win
the two-and-a-half hour match, 7-5, 6-7, 7-5, and
give the Toreros a 4-2 lead heading into doubles.
"It's hard to change your game," said Gould, refer
ring to Cathrall's transition from a baseline to serve
and-volley game. "He's making a sincere effort. He's
taking his lumps, but he'll be a better player for It."
Mattera and Chris Smith then beat Stanford's
Scott Moody and Barry Richards, 6-2, 6-3, to clinch
the match for San Diego. Jeff Tarango and Jacobson
lost to Patridge and David Stewart, 4-6. 6-3, 6-1,

Scott Moody dropped his singles match yesterday against David Stewart, 6-4, 6-3.
while Cathrall and Peus came
back to defeat Jim McNamee and
J R. Edwards, 3-6, 7-6, 6-1 in the
other doubles matches.
"Eric Peus and Jeff Cathrall
continue to show some progress
on doubles," Gould said.
Stanford got off to an early 1-0
lead yesterday when Tarango
disposed of McNamee. 6-2. 6-3.
Tarango is now 12-1 in 1987, 7-1
in dual matches.
"Tarango beat a good player
pretty badly," Gould said.
"McNamee has given us trouble in
the past. I think Jeff deserves a lot
of credit; he has done a superb
job."
The next three results for the
Cardinal were losses, however.
Richards, himself making a
transition from a two-handed to a
one-handed backhand, lost to Ed
wards, 6-2, 6-2.
Moody lost to Stewart, 6-4, 6-3,
and Jacobson, after having had el
bow surgery only three weeks ago,
played strongly in losing to Smith.
6-4, 6-4.
San Diego was fresh off a match
yesterday against California in
which the Toreros lost all six
singles matches played. Gould
characterized them as a "good,
not great team."
