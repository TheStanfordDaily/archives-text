# Card looks to recover against Cal club team
## 
### ALICIA KENT Staff writer 
It's Big Game night for the
Stanford men's volleyball team,
although the traditional rivalry
between the Cardinal and the
California Golden Bears will
not be the emphasis of
tonight's match at 7:30 at
Maples Pavilion.
After a frustrating Southern
California road trip with losses
to UCLA, USC and Long Beach
State, Stanford, now 3-4 in the
Western Intercollegiate Volley
ball Association, is hoping to
gain confidence in this non
conference match against Cal.
"Traditionally, we've done very
well against Berkeley," Stan
ford Asst. Coach Ruben Nieves
said.
Cal plays in the Northern Cal
ifornia Collegiate Volleyball
League, in which it has a win
ning record of 4-3 and an over
all record of 9-9. In a pre-season
scrimmage, the Cardinal beat
the Bears, playing and winning
five games Instead of playing
the standard best-of-five. "Cal
is a pretty good club team,"
Nieves said. "Our scrimmage
was very competitive, with very
close games. We hope to show
we've come a iong way since
then."
Both teams have also played
Chico State â€” Stanford won in
three games. Cal lost in four.
Tonight's emphasis for the
Cardinal will be on trying to
find the best lineup and serving
order, and on reducing hitting
errors. "This will be the perfect
opportunity to take a look at a
new lineup," Nieves said. The

starting lineup has been an on
going focus for the Cardinal be
cause of the influx of four fresh
men and two transfers to com
pete with six veterans for start
ing positions.
Freshman setter Parker
Blackman will start with junior
Scott Fortune and freshman
Dan Hanan as middle blockers,
and senior Stephen Blue and
freshman Kent Steffes in the
outside hitting positions.
Freshman Craig Forsyth,
Blackman's teammate in junior
competition, will play opposite
Blackman, blocking and hit
ting in the Cardinal's experi
mental lineup.
The second experiment in
tonight's match will be in Stan
ford's serving order. Hanan and
Fortune will switch positions,
allowing Fortune to be in the
front row two times alongside
the setter, instead of only once.
"We're hoping the lineup will go
out and take charge of the
match," Nieves said.
Yesterday, after a two-day
respite from practice, Stanford
Coach Fred Sturm held a team
meeting to outline the improve
ments the team has to make in
order to avoid a recurrence of
last week's losing streak.
Currently, the team has an
average hitting error of 22 per
cent, which Sturm feels is
much too high to be competi
tive against the powerful teams
in the WIVA, such as No. 5 Pep
perdine. The Cardinal would
like to be at 15 percent, both on
the team and individual level,
by next weekend when when it
plays Pepperdine and Loyola-
Marymount.
