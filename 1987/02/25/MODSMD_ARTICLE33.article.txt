Men's rugby
Last Saturday, the Cardinal
traveled to a pock-marked field at
Sacramento State to face the Hor
nets. Stanford dominated
backline play and scrums, posting
a 43-6 victory.
Scrum half Xavier Briggs
started the onslaught by blocking
a kick that flanker Will Wall fell on
for a try. Sac State made good on a
kick to pull within 4-3, but center
Dave Lowe followed with a score,
and the Cardinal defense set up
wing Ted "Sweetness" Laymen for
several long scoring jaunts to put
the match out of reach.
Stanford hosts British Colum
