# Sullivan Principles cited
## CIR questions H-P's policies 
### MARCUS MABRY Senior staff writer 
Citing deficiencies in the efforts
of Hewlett-Packard and John
Deere & Co. to promote racial
equality in South Africa and the
disappointing representation of
blacks in the companies' work
forces, the Committee on Invest
ment Responsibility (CIR) issued a
report Monday advising the Uni
versity to "communicate" its con
cern to the two companies.
According to the CIR report,
Hewlett-Packard has made
reactive rather than active efforts
to dismantle apartheid in South
Africa.
Currently, Hewlett-Packard has
a rank of II ("making progress") on
the Sullivan Principles and a
"disappointing" racial composi
tion in its South African work
force â€” only 12 blacks and 36
Asians and colored in a work force
of 261, according to the report.
The Sullivan Principles are a set
of guidelines aimed at promoting

racial equality for companies oper
ating in South Africa.
CIR Chairman Frederick Hillier
said he hoped University commu
nication with Hewlett-Packard
and John Deere will further the
University's aim of encouraging
corporations to either dlsinvest
from South Africa or produce pro
gressive results, such as adher
ence to the Sullivan Principles.
"We are aware of Stanford's con
cerns as we are aware of all our
stockholders' concerns," said
Hewlett-Packard Spokesman Gene
Endicott. "We are very aware of
their concern about the nature of
our activities down there, so we
try to show them how our contin
ued presence is justified. We feel
we should stay," he said.
"Any decision regarding invest
ment in our company is up to the
individual shareholders," En
dicott added.
Endicott said he was not sure
what effect, if any, the CIR recom
mendations will have on Hewlett-
Packard's relationship to Stan
ford.
Hewlett-Packard has historically
maintained a close relationship
with the University. Stanford
owns approximately $35 million
worth of stock in the company,
said University Treasurer Rodney
Adams.
Regarding Deere, the CIR report
recommended that the University
"encourage a stronger effort in
working against apartheid, in
cluding striving to improve Its
performance rating on the Sul
livan Principles to the top cate
gory." The CIR gave Deere a
ranking of II for 1986.
The report charged Deere with
behind" other American
companies in bringing about
change in South Africa and of per
petuating the system of isolation
of blacks In the "homelands."
According to the CIR report, the

representation of blacks in Deere's
work force is "disappointing." As
of mid-1985, the company had no
blacks in managerial positions
and no programs to train blacks
for such positions, the report
noted.
The CIR released its recommen
dations after reviewing proposed
shareholder resolutions by both
Hewlett-Packard and Deere calling
on the two companies to withdraw
from South Africa. Yesterday.
Hewlett-Packard stockholders
voted against a resolution to
withdraw from South Africa by an
eight to one margin.
The CIR issued no recommen
dation concerning how the Uni
versity should vote on the resolu
tion to withdraw. Hillier said. He
added that Stanford did not cast
its shares in yesterday's Hewlett-
Packard vote.
The ClR's recommendations will
be considered by the Trustees'
Special Committee on Investment
Responsibility at its March 9
meeting.
