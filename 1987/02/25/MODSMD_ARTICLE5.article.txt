# Grad stipends will increase

Graduate students will receive
more financial support beginning
this fall through University in
creases in funding for fellowships
and teaching assistants, Univer
sity officials have announced.
The increases will average 8.5
percent for teaching assistants,
course assistants and teaching
fellows, and 14.4 percent for Uni
versity fellowships, according to
acting Provost Robert Street.
Vice Provost Elizabeth Traugott,
dean of Graduate Studies, noted
that the increase was made in
consideration of the Tax Reform
Act of 1986, which will tax all
graduate student stipends (aid
geared toward living expenses).
Since the new tax law will tend to
increase student dependence on
loans, Stanford plans to support
the Association of American Uni
versities in its effort to eliminate
the tax on tuition for teaching and
research assistants, Traugott
said.
Speaking at last Thursday's
Faculty Senate meeting. Street
said University fellowships are
currently * 1,000 less than the es
timated cost for rent, food, books
and other expenses. Fellowship
stipends of *7,000, an increase of

â™¦880 from this year, will be recom
mended to the University Board of
Trustees for the 1987-88 aca
demic year, Street said.
Funding for the stipend in
creases, which exceed those
budgeted for current research
proposals and awards, will come
from a transition fund of
*650,000 to *1 million which has
been established by the Univer
sity, according to Street. Other
proposed increases include an
*810 increase to course assis
tants, a *675 increase for teach
ing assistants and a *700 in
crease for teaching fellows.
"I definitely don't have enough
money to live on," said Kathy
O'Shaughnessy of the Graduate
Students Association. A masters
student in environmental engi
neering, O'Shaughnessy said "a
lot of other majors are funded by
corporations, but not many corpo
rations want to fund the environ
ment." Many fellowships awarded
by the University are also based on
the likelihood that the student will
continue on to earn a doctorate,
she said.
"Usually masters students tend
not to be funded. There is a defi
nite money shortage and the tax
law is really cutting into things."
O'Shaughnessy said.
