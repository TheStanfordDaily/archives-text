# Ferruolo: Tenure standard too high
## 
### MARK LAWRENCE Senior staff writer 
The History Department's
standards for granting tenure are
so high that no Medieval his
torian — no matter how qualified
— could gain tenure in the de
partment, according to History
Asst. Prof. Stephen Ferruolo.
Ferruolo, who two weeks ago
was denied tenure for a second
time, said in an interview Friday
that his more recent bid was also
frustrated by some history fac
ulty who resent his commitment
to undergraduate teaching.
The resentment of those fac
ulty members, combined with
"excessively high" criteria for
gaining tenure In the depart
ment, not only resulted in his

second defeat, but more funda
mentally, represents a trend that
could damage the History Depart
ment, Ferruolo said.
"There are not perfect his
torians out there waiting to des
cend upon Stanford," Ferruolo
said. "But what happens is that
you are evaluated against this
ideal, and nobody can stand up
to that."
In the long run, this predica
ment means that the department
will be paralyzed by its quest for
perfection, since it will find no
young professors who meet the
criteria, Ferruolo said.
"I think the History Depart
ment has a complex about where
It stands nationally — a terrible
complex," Ferruolo said. "It has
lost to retirement many of the

people who made this depart
ment a nationally ranked one.
and it's not replacing them."
Other history professors
downplay Ferruolo's charges,
saying that all professors who are
denied tenure make similar argu
ments. Proof that the department
is not aiming too high, they say.


Stephen Ferruolo
Bid for tenure denied
is the fact that several history pro
fessors have been granted tenure
in recent years.
"His are the usual arguments of
anyone who's turned down for
tenure," said History Prof. Carl
Degler. "The History Department's
standards are high, but not
impossible."
History Department Chairman
James Sheehan said there is no
evidence to support Ferruolo's
charges. He said Ferruolo's can
didacy was considered "with great
care and honesty."
Ferruolo was originally denied
tenure last April, but he filed a
grievance and won a rehearing
after a grievance officer found that
new criteria for evaluating a ten

ure candidate had been Inconsis
tently applied in Ferruolo's case.
Ferruolo said he hopes to have a
better idea of the reasons for the
department's decision after he
receives a memorandum from Act
ing Provost Robert Street, who is
compiling information supplied
by Sheehan Into a general expla
nation.
Ferruolo said he will decide
whether to pursue the grievance
that won him the second hearing
after he receives Streets
memorandum.
For now. Ferruolo said, he
suspects a combination of five fac
tors led to the denial:
□ Some members of the History
Department faculty think that
they have to "get tough" because
"a number of mistakes" have been
made in tenure decisions over the
last few years, Ferruolo said. "I
think that they feel the Adminis

tratlon is looking at them to get
tough, and I would say that being
a white male in an expendable
field that I become a convenient
victim."
□ The history faculty is in an In
tense battle with other top univer
sities for a high national ranking.
Ferruolo said. Harvard, he said,
recently turned down a top Ameri
can historian, and Stanford —
wanting to maintain standards as
high as Harvard's — turned Fer
ruolo down to show that It too can
turn down leading scholars.
"This is kind of a strange way of
turning down someone who's as
good as I am," Ferruolo said.
□ The department is more reluc
tant to promote faculty from
within the department than to
make appointments from the
outside, he said. Faculty know
that they have found the best pos
sible candidate when they bring a

new member in from the outside,
he said. But when they consider
promoting a member from within
the department, they are always
conscious that there may be a bet
ter candidate outside the Univer
sity.
□ American historians and
modern historians — who com
prise the overwhelming majority
of the department — have diffi
culty evaluating ancient and
Medieval historians, whose schol
arship is fundamentally different.
Ferruolo said. "Medieval and an
cient history are matters of inter
preting sources that have been
looked at before." he said. "It's
very hard for people working in
modern fields to understand the
nature of what we do — In what
ways our scholarship is new and
original, and the technical ex
pertise that is involved."
□ Some members of the depart

ment resent his commitments
beyond his scholarship, said Fer
ruolo, winner of the 1982 Dinkel
spiel Award for outstanding un
dergraduate teaching.
"When I came here as an assis
tant professor in 1979, I was told
research comes first, but teaching
Is Important." he said. "The
message now being given to us Is:
Don't waste your time teaching.
The message is crystal clear: Good
teaching is a negative factor in
tenure cases.
"The current mentality is that if
you're a good teacher you're not a
serious scholar, that they're some
how incompatible," he said. "I
think we have the right to expect
that if we make time in addition to
doing our scholarship — that if we
make time to be good teachers,
that if we make time to be there In
support of students in other ways
in and out of the classroom — that

It will not be held against us when
we come up for tenure."
Countering Ferruolo's charge
that modern historians are Inca
pable of judging a Medieval his
torian's work, Sheehan said
modern historians must take spe
cial care in their evaluations of
colleagues in the more traditional
fields. But, he said, the necessity
for special attention does not
mean that a Medieval historian
will not receive a fair hearing.
"One has to be conscious of
these difficulties," Sheehan said.
"I don't believe any of these prob
lems are insurmountable if one Is
aware of them."
Sheehan also discounted the
degree to which the department's
decision in tenure cases is influ
enced by personal factors, such as
grudges against accomplished
teachers.

will not receive a fair hearing.
"One has to be conscious of
these difficulties," Sheehan said.
"I don't believe any of these prob
lems are insurmountable if one Is
aware of them."
Sheehan also discounted the
degree to which the department's
decision in tenure cases is influ
enced by personal factors, such as
grudges against accomplished
teachers.
The History Department's
standards for granting tenure are
so high that no Medieval his
torian — no matter how qualified
— could gain tenure in the de
partment, according to History
Asst. Prof. Stephen Ferruolo.
Ferruolo, who two weeks ago
was denied tenure for a second
time, said in an interview Friday
that his more recent bid was also
frustrated by some history fac
ulty who resent his commitment
to undergraduate teaching.
The resentment of those fac
ulty members, combined with
"excessively high" criteria for
gaining tenure In the depart
ment, not only resulted in his

second defeat, but more funda
mentally, represents a trend that
could damage the History Depart
ment, Ferruolo said.
"There are not perfect his
torians out there waiting to des
cend upon Stanford," Ferruolo
said. "But what happens is that
you are evaluated against this
ideal, and nobody can stand up
to that."
In the long run, this predica
ment means that the department
will be paralyzed by its quest for
perfection, since it will find no
young professors who meet the
criteria, Ferruolo said.
"I think the History Depart
ment has a complex about where
It stands nationally — a terrible
complex," Ferruolo said. "It has
lost to retirement many of the

people who made this depart
ment a nationally ranked one.
and it's not replacing them."
Other history professors
downplay Ferruolo's charges,
saying that all professors who are
denied tenure make similar argu
ments. Proof that the department
is not aiming too high, they say.


Stephen Ferruolo
Bid for tenure denied
is the fact that several history pro
fessors have been granted tenure
in recent years.
"His are the usual arguments of
anyone who's turned down for
tenure," said History Prof. Carl
Degler. "The History Department's
standards are high, but not
impossible."
History Department Chairman
James Sheehan said there is no
evidence to support Ferruolo's
charges. He said Ferruolo's can
didacy was considered "with great
care and honesty."
Ferruolo was originally denied
tenure last April, but he filed a
grievance and won a rehearing
after a grievance officer found that
new criteria for evaluating a ten

ure candidate had been Inconsis
tently applied in Ferruolo's case.
Ferruolo said he hopes to have a
better idea of the reasons for the
department's decision after he
receives a memorandum from Act
ing Provost Robert Street, who is
compiling information supplied
by Sheehan Into a general expla
nation.
Ferruolo said he will decide
whether to pursue the grievance
that won him the second hearing
after he receives Streets
memorandum.
For now. Ferruolo said, he
suspects a combination of five fac
tors led to the denial:
□ Some members of the History
Department faculty think that
they have to "get tough" because
"a number of mistakes" have been
made in tenure decisions over the
last few years, Ferruolo said. "I
think that they feel the Adminis

tratlon is looking at them to get
tough, and I would say that being
a white male in an expendable
field that I become a convenient
victim."
□ The history faculty is in an In
tense battle with other top univer
sities for a high national ranking.
Ferruolo said. Harvard, he said,
recently turned down a top Ameri
can historian, and Stanford —
wanting to maintain standards as
high as Harvard's — turned Fer
ruolo down to show that It too can
turn down leading scholars.
"This is kind of a strange way of
turning down someone who's as
good as I am," Ferruolo said.
□ The department is more reluc
tant to promote faculty from
within the department than to
make appointments from the
outside, he said. Faculty know
that they have found the best pos
sible candidate when they bring a

new member in from the outside,
he said. But when they consider
promoting a member from within
the department, they are always
conscious that there may be a bet
ter candidate outside the Univer
sity.
□ American historians and
modern historians — who com
prise the overwhelming majority
of the department — have diffi
culty evaluating ancient and
Medieval historians, whose schol
arship is fundamentally different.
Ferruolo said. "Medieval and an
cient history are matters of inter
preting sources that have been
looked at before." he said. "It's
very hard for people working in
modern fields to understand the
nature of what we do — In what
ways our scholarship is new and
original, and the technical ex
pertise that is involved."
□ Some members of the depart

ment resent his commitments
beyond his scholarship, said Fer
ruolo, winner of the 1982 Dinkel
spiel Award for outstanding un
dergraduate teaching.
"When I came here as an assis
tant professor in 1979, I was told
research comes first, but teaching
Is Important." he said. "The
message now being given to us Is:
Don't waste your time teaching.
The message is crystal clear: Good
teaching is a negative factor in
tenure cases.
"The current mentality is that if
you're a good teacher you're not a
serious scholar, that they're some
how incompatible," he said. "I
think we have the right to expect
that if we make time in addition to
doing our scholarship — that if we
make time to be good teachers,
that if we make time to be there In
support of students in other ways
in and out of the classroom — that

It will not be held against us when
we come up for tenure."
Countering Ferruolo's charge
that modern historians are Inca
pable of judging a Medieval his
torian's work, Sheehan said
modern historians must take spe
cial care in their evaluations of
colleagues in the more traditional
fields. But, he said, the necessity
for special attention does not
mean that a Medieval historian
will not receive a fair hearing.
"One has to be conscious of
these difficulties," Sheehan said.
"I don't believe any of these prob
lems are insurmountable if one Is
aware of them."
