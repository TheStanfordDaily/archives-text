# Ferruolo: Tenure standard too high
## 
### MARK LAWRENCE Senior staff writer 
The History Department's
standards for granting tenure are
so high that no Medieval his
torian — no matter how qualified
— could gain tenure in the de
partment, according to History
Asst. Prof. Stephen Ferruolo.
Ferruolo, who two weeks ago
was denied tenure for a second
time, said in an interview Friday
that his more recent bid was also
frustrated by some history fac
ulty who resent his commitment
to undergraduate teaching.
The resentment of those fac
ulty members, combined with
"excessively high" criteria for
gaining tenure In the depart
ment, not only resulted in his

second defeat, but more funda
mentally, represents a trend that
could damage the History Depart
ment, Ferruolo said.
"There are not perfect his
torians out there waiting to des
cend upon Stanford," Ferruolo
said. "But what happens is that
you are evaluated against this
ideal, and nobody can stand up
to that."
In the long run, this predica
ment means that the department
will be paralyzed by its quest for
perfection, since it will find no
young professors who meet the
criteria, Ferruolo said.
"I think the History Depart
ment has a complex about where
It stands nationally — a terrible
complex," Ferruolo said. "It has
lost to retirement many of the

people who made this depart
ment a nationally ranked one.
and it's not replacing them."
Other history professors
downplay Ferruolo's charges,
saying that all professors who are
denied tenure make similar argu
ments. Proof that the department
is not aiming too high, they say.
