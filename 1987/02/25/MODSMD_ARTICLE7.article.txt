# Prof. may change careers
## After tenure denial, Ferruolo is frustrated and bitter 
### MARK LAWRENCE Senior staff writer 
When Stephen Ferruolo came
to Stanford eight years ago, he
was a sure thing.
But for Ferruolo, that was
nothing new. His college and
graduate school days were dotted
with success after success: a
magna cum laude degree from
Wesleyan, a Rhodes scholarship
for study at Oxford, a Danforth
Graduate Fellowship, two years
of teaching at Bennington Col
lege. a Princeton doctoral thesis
that would be revised into a
major book.
Over his first seven years at
Stanford, there was only more
success. By all accounts. Fer
ruolo. 37. is today one of the top
three or four Medieval scholars of

his generation in the world.
An award-winning teacher and

lifelong appointment. The Fer

Now. after a second failure to
gain tenure. Ferruolo faces an
uncertain future.
Soured on higher education,
frustrated by a system that can
ruin a career behind closed
doors, bitter at the way his col

of a second tenure rejection two
weeks ago, Ferruolo may be
headed out of academics.
"I think my colleagues in the
History Department have done me
in in a way that probably means
the end of my academic career,"
Ferruolo said. "I think the way in
which they have handled the sit

— it's outrageous.
"I think to a scholar of my
caliber and — more important —
to a teacher with my record, it's a
terrible disservice to me and my
profession, and I think that they
ought to be held accountable for
it."
History professors insist that
they considered Ferruolo's can
