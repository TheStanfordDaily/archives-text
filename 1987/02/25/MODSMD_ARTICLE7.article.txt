# Prof. may change careers
## After tenure denial, Ferruolo is frustrated and bitter 
### MARK LAWRENCE Senior staff writer 
When Stephen Ferruolo came
to Stanford eight years ago, he
was a sure thing.
But for Ferruolo, that was
nothing new. His college and
graduate school days were dotted
with success after success: a
magna cum laude degree from
Wesleyan, a Rhodes scholarship
for study at Oxford, a Danforth
Graduate Fellowship, two years
of teaching at Bennington Col
lege. a Princeton doctoral thesis
that would be revised into a
major book.
Over his first seven years at
Stanford, there was only more
success. By all accounts. Fer
ruolo. 37. is today one of the top
three or four Medieval scholars of

his generation in the world.
An award-winning teacher and
a popular resident fellow. Fer
ruolo had everything going for
him when he came up for a ten
ure vote last April.
That was when things started
going sour.
Despite a unanimous recom
mendation from a search com
mittee, tenured members of the
History Department voted
against granting Ferruolo a
lifelong appointment. The Fer
ruolo express was derailed.
Now. after a second failure to
gain tenure. Ferruolo faces an
uncertain future.
Soured on higher education,
frustrated by a system that can
ruin a career behind closed
doors, bitter at the way his col
leagues treated him in the wake

of a second tenure rejection two
weeks ago, Ferruolo may be
headed out of academics.
"I think my colleagues in the
History Department have done me
in in a way that probably means
the end of my academic career,"
Ferruolo said. "I think the way in
which they have handled the sit
uation Is extremely irresponsible
— it's outrageous.
"I think to a scholar of my
caliber and — more important —
to a teacher with my record, it's a
terrible disservice to me and my
profession, and I think that they
ought to be held accountable for
it."
History professors insist that
they considered Ferruolo's can
didacy with great care. There is no
evidence, they say, to support his
complaints, which are typical of
someone who has been turned
down for tenure.
Ferruolo said he will probably
continue the grievance he filed
last May after the first decision.
Noel Kolak, assistant provost for
faculty affairs, said she could not
recall a professor ever receiving a
second rehearing through the
grievance process.
Regardless of the grievance,
however, Ferruolo said he will look
elsewhere — to law, business, col
lege administration positions and
perhaps a tenure-track position at
another university if an offer
comes along.
Ferruolo said a career in labor
law is most appealing, particularly
after his recent experiences at
Stanford.
"I'm very concerned about the
lack of rights that faculty mem
bers at private institutions have,"
Ferruolo said. "I would never
resort to the law courts, but It
seems to me that that is some
thing every worker in this country
ought to have a right to."

Ideally, Ferruolo said, he would
take a sabbatical from Stanford
next year to finish two books he is
writing, and begin law school In
the fall of 1988. His appointment
at Stanford expires in June 1988.
Another possibility is a career in
college administration, Ferruolo
said.
"If I felt that there was some
place that was really committed to
undergraduate education and the
liberal arts where I could go in an
administrative position and con
tribute to that, then I would take
It," Ferruolo said. "It would have
to be with a sense that I could con
tinue teaching, I could continue
some scholarship, and that I was
involved in a place that was really
trying to make changes to improve
its undergraduate offerings."
Ferruolo said he might also con
sider a tenure-track postlon at an
other university, despite his disil
lusionment with contemporary
education. It is possible, he said,
for a professor who has turned
down for tenure at one university
to move on and win it at another,
Ferruolo said.
"The problem is when you've
been turned down on the
departmental level and people

refuse to explain why that's hap
pened, it raises all kinds of
suspicions," he said. "I do know
that I certainly have enough sup
port internationally in my profes
sion and support among the mem
bers of my department — particu
larly the emeriti — and my senior
colleagues out of the History De
partment to know that they will do
their damnedest to put the full
brunt of this error on the History
Department itseli."
But for Ferruolo, the attraction
to academics is gone, and the
prospect of moving to another
university to begin the whole
process again Is not appealing. In
fact, Ferruolo would nor recom
mend that anyone go into
academics now.

Intense pressure on faculty to
publish, uncertainty about fair
ness in the tenure process and
disregard for the liberal arts by
college administrations simply
outweigh the rewards of a career
in academics, Ferruolo said.
"One hopes that the writing is
on the wall and that something
will be done," Ferruolo said, "but I
would not recommend that
anyone go into higher education
right now.
"Despite all the talk we've heard
from the Administration about an
increased commitment to under
graduate education, there has
been a diminished commitment to
undergraduate education," Fer
ruolo said. "Let them try to deny it
— they are lying."

to move on and win it at another,
Ferruolo said.
"The problem is when you've
been turned down on the
departmental level and people

refuse to explain why that's hap
pened, it raises all kinds of
suspicions," he said. "I do know
that I certainly have enough sup
port internationally in my profes
sion and support among the mem
bers of my department — particu
larly the emeriti — and my senior
colleagues out of the History De
partment to know that they will do
their damnedest to put the full
brunt of this error on the History
Department itseli."
But for Ferruolo, the attraction
to academics is gone, and the
prospect of moving to another
university to begin the whole
process again Is not appealing. In
fact, Ferruolo would nor recom
mend that anyone go into
academics now.

Intense pressure on faculty to
publish, uncertainty about fair
ness in the tenure process and
disregard for the liberal arts by
college administrations simply
outweigh the rewards of a career
in academics, Ferruolo said.
"One hopes that the writing is
on the wall and that something
will be done," Ferruolo said, "but I
would not recommend that
anyone go into higher education
right now.
"Despite all the talk we've heard
from the Administration about an
increased commitment to under
graduate education, there has
been a diminished commitment to
undergraduate education," Fer
ruolo said. "Let them try to deny it
— they are lying."
When Stephen Ferruolo came
to Stanford eight years ago, he
was a sure thing.
But for Ferruolo, that was
nothing new. His college and
graduate school days were dotted
with success after success: a
magna cum laude degree from
Wesleyan, a Rhodes scholarship
for study at Oxford, a Danforth
Graduate Fellowship, two years
of teaching at Bennington Col
lege. a Princeton doctoral thesis
that would be revised into a
major book.
Over his first seven years at
Stanford, there was only more
success. By all accounts. Fer
ruolo. 37. is today one of the top
three or four Medieval scholars of

his generation in the world.
An award-winning teacher and
a popular resident fellow. Fer
ruolo had everything going for
him when he came up for a ten
ure vote last April.
That was when things started
going sour.
Despite a unanimous recom
mendation from a search com
mittee, tenured members of the
History Department voted
against granting Ferruolo a
lifelong appointment. The Fer
ruolo express was derailed.
Now. after a second failure to
gain tenure. Ferruolo faces an
uncertain future.
Soured on higher education,
frustrated by a system that can
ruin a career behind closed
doors, bitter at the way his col
leagues treated him in the wake

of a second tenure rejection two
weeks ago, Ferruolo may be
headed out of academics.
"I think my colleagues in the
History Department have done me
in in a way that probably means
the end of my academic career,"
Ferruolo said. "I think the way in
which they have handled the sit
uation Is extremely irresponsible
— it's outrageous.
"I think to a scholar of my
caliber and — more important —
to a teacher with my record, it's a
terrible disservice to me and my
profession, and I think that they
ought to be held accountable for
it."
History professors insist that
they considered Ferruolo's can
didacy with great care. There is no
evidence, they say, to support his
complaints, which are typical of
someone who has been turned
down for tenure.
Ferruolo said he will probably
continue the grievance he filed
last May after the first decision.
Noel Kolak, assistant provost for
faculty affairs, said she could not
recall a professor ever receiving a
second rehearing through the
grievance process.
Regardless of the grievance,
however, Ferruolo said he will look
elsewhere — to law, business, col
lege administration positions and
perhaps a tenure-track position at
another university if an offer
comes along.
Ferruolo said a career in labor
law is most appealing, particularly
after his recent experiences at
Stanford.
"I'm very concerned about the
lack of rights that faculty mem
bers at private institutions have,"
Ferruolo said. "I would never
resort to the law courts, but It
seems to me that that is some
thing every worker in this country
ought to have a right to."

Ideally, Ferruolo said, he would
take a sabbatical from Stanford
next year to finish two books he is
writing, and begin law school In
the fall of 1988. His appointment
at Stanford expires in June 1988.
Another possibility is a career in
college administration, Ferruolo
said.
"If I felt that there was some
place that was really committed to
undergraduate education and the
liberal arts where I could go in an
administrative position and con
tribute to that, then I would take
It," Ferruolo said. "It would have
to be with a sense that I could con
tinue teaching, I could continue
some scholarship, and that I was
involved in a place that was really
trying to make changes to improve
its undergraduate offerings."
Ferruolo said he might also con
sider a tenure-track postlon at an
other university, despite his disil
lusionment with contemporary
education. It is possible, he said,
for a professor who has turned
down for tenure at one university
to move on and win it at another,
Ferruolo said.
"The problem is when you've
been turned down on the
departmental level and people

refuse to explain why that's hap
pened, it raises all kinds of
suspicions," he said. "I do know
that I certainly have enough sup
port internationally in my profes
