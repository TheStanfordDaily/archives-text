Soviets: Preserve ABM Treaty
GENEVA — The Soviet delegation to the nuclear arms talks here
warned yesterday that the Reagan administration's new "broad
interpretation" of the 1972 Antl-Balllstlc Missile Treaty "Is effec
tively blocking a solution to the issue of radical reductions in nu
clear arms."
The chief Soviet negotiator on space weapons, Aleksei Obukhov,
told a news conference that "if the arms race goes into space, re
duction in nuclear weapons will be impossible."
The Soviets called the news conference as the senior U.S. arms
control adviser In the Department of State. Paul Nitze, prepared to
head for Europe to brief Western allies on the new ABM interpreta
tion, which Is designed to furnish legal clearance for testing com
ponents for a space-based anti-ballistic missile system as part of
President Reagan's Strategic Defense Initiative — the "Star Wars"
program.
Washington's allies in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization
are aware that, whatever they have to say, the Reagan administra
tion is likely to proceed with its interpretation, or reinterpreta
tlon, of the ABM treaty. Nevertheless, they are expected to tell
Nitze and Rowney that abandoning ABM treaty restraints is likely
to kill a last chance for any nuclear arms agreement in the final
two years of the Reagan government.
Obukhov clearly had Washington's NATO allies in mind when
he told the press: "Preservation and strengthening of the ABM
treaty is only technically a bilateral issue between the Soviet Un
ion and the United States. Its significance goes far beyond the
Soviet-U.S. relationship. Therefore every country and every states
man who cherishes the ideals of International peace and security
must speak up and display a sense of responsibility in this
regard."
Illegal evidence now admissible
WASHINGTON — The Supreme Court, further whittling away at
the exclusionary rule, decided yesterday that evidence seized im
properly as a result of "honest mistakes" by police may be used at
trial.
The 6-to-3 ruling reinstated the conviction and 15-year prison
term of Baltimore drug dealer Harold Garrison even though police
searched his third-floor apartment without a warrant.
The court has in recent years increasingly allowed exceptions to
the controversial exclusionary rule. In 1984, it allowed a limited
"good faith" exception to the rule for situations similar to Tues
day's.
In another ruling, the court split 5 to 4 in ruling that defen
dants accused of sexually abusing children do not have a constitu
tional right to examine state child protection agency records in
search of information helpful to their defense.
The majority, in an opinion by Justice Lewis Powell, Jr., said
that such information should be submitted to a judge, who can
then determine what, if any, information should be turned over to
a defendant.
The Maryland Court of Appeals had overturned Garrison's con
viction in 1985, ruling that the exclusionary rule — which gener
ally bars use of Illegally seized evidence in a trial — required that
the drugs found in Garrison's apartment could not be used
against him. The Maiyland court said the warrant was insuffi
ciently specific, in violation of the Fourth Amendment's require
ment that warrants "particularly describe" the place to be
searched.
The Supreme Court disagreed. "The validity of the search of
(Garrison's) apartment," Justice John Paul Stevens wrote for the
majority Tuesday in Maryland vs. Garrison, "depends on whether
the officers' failure to realize (there were two apartments) was . . .
understandable and reasonable. Here it unquestionably was,"
Stevens said.
Middle East leaders summiting
AMMAN, Jordan — Middle East leaders this week grasped for
new initiatives that might bring respite from the building cycle of
violence In the region.
In a burst of political and military action, Syria sent an occupa
tion army into west Beirut while Israel's Foreign Minister Shimon
Peres headed for a second high-level summit in Egypt.
In the Persian Gulf war between Iran and Iraq, a temporary
cease-fire was shattered as Iran renewed its shelling of the south
ern Iraqi city of Basra and launched new probing attacks against
Iraqi lines in the six-year-old war's most important offensive.
Still unresolved, however, was the plight of American and other
Western hostages still being held by extremist groups in Lebanon.
A U.S. Navy battle group remained offshore in the eastern Mediter
ranean.
For all of the activity generated by the continuing crises in
Lebanon, the Persian Gulf and the peace process between Israel
and Its neighbors, Arab and western diplomats saw little prospect
for dramatic movement in solving the region's most Intractable
conflicts.
As one Western official in Jordan put it, "The king (Hussein)
has gone skiing in Austria. Maybe that's an indication of what's
going on."
On his first trip to Egypt since he traveled there as prime mini
ster last September to meet with Egyptian President Hosni
Mubarak, Peres, now foreign minister under a power-sharing
agreement, appeared to be headed for disappointment.
Among Peres' goals on this trip is to push forward on a contro
versial proposal to reinvlgorate the Middle East peace process by
holding an international conference to be chaired jointly by the
United States and the Soviet Union.
Hearings probe insider trading
WASHINGTON — Expressing outrage and dismay at the ex
panding Insider trading scandal, representatives of four top se
curities firms told Congress yesterday that Wall Street needs gov
ernment help to police a problem they said threatens the future
credibility of financial markets.
The executives also warned that the global expansion of capital
markets had so complicated the securities industry that they have
been unable to frame a comprehensive working definition of in
sider trading, even for the guidance of their own employees.
The four testified at the first of a series of hearings by the Sen
ate Banking subcommittee on securities into the need for ex
panded regulation of the industry by the Securities and Exchange
Commission, which has taken the lead In investigating financial
market abuses but is accused by some Democrats of insufficient
regulatory zeal.
Committee Chairman Donald Riegle, D-Mich., supported by
other committee Democrats, including William Proxmire of Wis
consin. Jim Sasser of Tennessee and Richard Shelby of Alabama,
spoke in favor of new regulation.
"The insidious effect of Insider trading abuses," said Paine Web
ber Chairman Donald Marron, "is that they begin to erode
(market) confidence by causing ordinary investors to believe that
the markets are not fair and that the values they read in the
papers may not reflect the true values of the securities they are
holding or want to buy or sell."
He urged Congress to enhance the SEC's ability to oversee
markets, to clarify the definition of Insider trading abuses and to
tighten and streamline rules governing mergers and takeovers so
that essential trading information reaches the public domain as
quickly as possible.
