ITS NOT TOO EARLY
TO START THINKING ABOUT
BEING AN RA NEXT YEAR. . .
• Asian American
• Black
• Chicano/ Mexican American
and
• American Indian
students are encouraged to consider applying for
residence staff positions for 1987-88.
The greater the diversity of the RA staff, the greater the
likelihood that issues of race, ethnicity, and cross-cultural
interaction will be discussed in the residences. Asian American,
Black, Chicano, and American Indian RAs help influence
residents and the whole staff to assume responsibility for
addressing issues of race and class in our society. If you wish to
discuss RA responsibilities, compensation, or the time
commitment, call Alice Supton or Robin Hensley at 725-2800.
Interested applicants need to attend a general information
meeting on
MONDAY, MARCH 2
TUESDAY, MARCH 3 or
WEDNESDAY, MARCH 4
from 6:00-7:00PM
in the ELLIOTT PROGRAM CENTER
followed by a small group discussion with current RAs on RA
expectations from 7:15-8:15 p.m.
The Office of Residential Education is committed to appointing
a culturally diverse residence staff and to encouraging a program
which promotes cross-cultural interaction.
