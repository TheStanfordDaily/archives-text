Six student volunteers, Including a member of the
ASSU Council of Presidents, the coordinator of the
Rape Education Project and an Olympic swimmer,
are the winter quarter recipients of the Dean's
Awards for Service, according to Dean of Student Af
fairs James Lyons.
Graduate student Lorna Catford, Council of Presi
dents member Kim Crawford, senior Judith David,
fund-raising volunteer Tanya Lynn Novak, Olympic
swimmer Pablo Morales, and B'nai B'rith Hillel vol
unteer Steve Simon will be recognized for their ser
vice to Stanford and the surrounding community at
a ceremony and dinner March 3.
Associate Dean of the School of Education Larry
Cuban nominated Catford for "recognizing the need
for support services among her fellow students in the
School of Education and taking the initiative to es
tablish programs to address those needs," including
starting a peer counseling group and a series of bag
lunches to discuss academic and student issues.
"There was a notion that graduate students at the
School of Education are expected to take care of
themselves," Cuban said. "Lorna saw a need for sup
port services and filled the gap."
Crawford, a co-terminal student in industrial engi
neering, was cited for the "easy grace with which she
moves from the high profile political settings of the
COP and the BSU to the quiet counseling role of RA
in Potter House," by History Prof. Stephen Ferruolo,
Potter's Resident Fellow.
David rejuvenated the Rape Education Project in
1984 and has also been an "extraordinarily devoted"
RA, according to Otero Resident Fellow Dennis
Matthies, who joined with Asst. Dean of Residential
Education Alice Supton to nominate David.
David took over as coordinator of the Rape Educa
tion Project at a time when it was "pretty much
defunct," Matthies said. She is currently organizing
a spring conference entitled "Women and Men:
Voices for Change."
David is serving her second year as a resident as
sistant and delivered the welcoming address at RA
orientation this fall.
An economics and communications major, Novak
put her academic skills to work as a volunteer for the
Office of Development.
Her creative energy, organization and hard work
