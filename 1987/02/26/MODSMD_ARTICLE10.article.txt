# Critic covers women's dance
## 
### NANNETTE THOMPSON Staff writer 
Modern and post-modern dance are among the
few art forms that have not been historically
dominated by men, said dance critic and author
Roger Copeland in the first of two speeches he is
giving at Stanford.
Copeland, a contributing writer for The New
York 1 imes and associate professor of theatre and
dance at Oberlin College in Ohio, delivered a
lecture entitled. "Founding Mothers: Pioneers of
Modern Dance." The talk was part of Dance Week
'81. a series of events co-sponsored by the
Feminist Studies Department and the Dance De
partment. and focused on the key contributions of
women in breaking through sexual barriers in
dance.
Copeland described the post-modern, stylized
choreography of the 1960s as "a form of western
theatrical dance." This genre of movement, he
said, was pioneered by college-educated women
who were tired of the stereotype that females
"spoke the language only of the body and not of
the mind."
Consequently, these women tried to break
through the traditional barriers of choreography.
For instance, unlike ballet where men were often
"demoted to the status of hydraulic lifts," in early
post-modern pieces a reversal in the usual roles
occurred — the men were lifted by the women.
An additional break with ballet is the
"prominence of the spoken language' in post
modern and modern dance, Copeland said. Em
phasizing language was a way oi featuring a dan

cer's mind as well as body, he told the audience.
Copeland spoke about other differences be
tween modern and post-modern dance as
compared to ballet. Ballet has historically been
choreographed by men. whereas women have
dominated the modern dance scene. He attributes
this fact to traditional sexual stereotypes.
He said while women were the flowers in ballet,
men were the gardeners. The male choreographer,
in not dancing in the piece himself, "stands apart
from his creation," Copeland told the audience.
In contrast, female post-modern dancers
choreographed numbers in which they partici
pated. Their stylized movements tried to capture
the new ireedom for women eaused by the sexual
revolution, he said.
Isadora Duncan, a choreographer of the Vic
torian age and pioneer of modern dance, was one
ol the first to rebel against the confines of ballet,
Copeland said.
This revolutionary dancer said that the
structured five-position movements of ballet
twisted and distorted young girls' legs. Duncan
also objected to the the tight corset worn by girls
at the turn of the century, Copeland said, because
it restricted movement and made breathing diffi
cult. Duncan favored a loose Greek tunic for danc
ing.
Another pioneering force in dance that
Copeland noted was Martha Graham, whose
choreography caused controversy in the 19405.
Her works were "unabashedly pagan," said the
dance critic. In blocking her dances she tended to
focus on mythological elements such as the
Dionysian ritual.
