In 1985, 50,000 Americans died in auto
accidents. Half of those lives could have been
3aved if seat belts were used. Mandatory seat
belt laws are a logical and effective step
toward preventing pointless carnage on
American roads. Legal challenges to seat belt
laws which claim they invade a constitu
tional right to privacy are unfounded.
The Supreme Court this week dismissed a
challenge to an Illinois law requiring all
front-seat occupants of motor vehicles to
wear seat belts. The decision indicated, the
Court generally agreed with the Illinois Su
preme Court's ruling that such laws do not
violate privacy rights protected by the Con
stitution.
Since New York Gov. Mario Cuomo
pioneered the first mandatory seat belt law
two years ago, statistics show that seat belt
laws work. Under such laws more drivers and
passengers wear seat belts, and fewer
fatalities and serious injuries occur. After
New York passed its law in 1985, 165 fewer
deaths occurred and 12,000 fewer serious in

juries were reported in that state.
Requiring the simple act of buckling up
hardly constitutes an infringement of civil
liberties. It is a reasonable safety precaution
that people, out of sheer laziness or forgetful
ness, often fail to use. These laws are more of
a friendly reminder than an invasion of
privacy.
Something in the American psyche,
though, is bothered by seat belt laws. They
seem to threaten our sense of rugged in
dividualism represented in the great freedom
the auto provides. But why should a car be
any different than other vehicles for which
the law requires certain safety measures?
Passengers in planes have to wear seat belts,
motorcyclists often have to wear helmets â€”
are they somehow rendered less free? The
decision to wear a seat belt is not a sacred
private act.
A >20 fine, like the one imposed by Califor
nia law on first offenders, is hardly a high
price to pay when it comes to saving 25,000
lives a year.
