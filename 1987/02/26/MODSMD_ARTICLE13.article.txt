Just nonsense
Hey everybody! Guess what?
Otero has a LaserWriter! And
guess what? Unless you're one of
the "lucky 90" you can't use it.
That's right. Our illustrious Uni
versity has installed a
LaserWriter, 10 or so Macintosh
Plus computers, and several Im
agewriter printers in Otero. This
was news to me last night, when
a friend of mine was trying to find
a place to print his applications
to graduate school. Because he
isn't a member of this exclusive
Otero clique, he was denied
access to the LaserWriter by a
person who was probably just
doing his job. So he went to
Lagunita. We're talking two
LaserWriters there, folks, in case
you've been kept in the dark like I
have. He was denied at Lag, too.
We're talking about >4,000 per
LaserWriter (Stanford gets this
great deal because it's non-profit
— they'd cost you and me >6,000
a pop). Plus * 1,500 or so per Mac
Plus. Say >300 per Imagewriter.
By my rather faulty arithmetic
that's about >20,500. That's
>225 per Otero resident.
Now take me and my friend. We
live with more than 250 other
students in the residences of the
Cowell Cluster. No freshmen here.
Also no Macs, no LaserWriter. We
also don't have a connection to
LOTS or access to SUNet. Yeah,
we've tried.
Now it seems to me that there's
a problem here. I lived in Rin
conada freshman year, and my
friend lived at Otero his freshman
year. We didn't have LaserWriters.
We didn't need them. Apparently
this new breed of freshman needs
to laser-write Freshman English
papers and Western Culture take
home midterms. Apparently
Meyer Library is too far away from
Otero to write papers there.
So, OK, It's a big waste of
money. The big question is: Why
can't the rest of us use it? We pay
the University the exact same
extravagantly overprlced-but-let's
raise-it-another-six-percent-next-
year tuition. Even if we have to
trek over to use it. It should be
our privilege. But no. People
living at ZAP. ATO, Alpha Sig,
Terra and Whitman have to go
clear to Terman and pay a mini
mum of >6 for a card to get a
resume printed, or go off campus
where it costs more than 50 cents
per copy.
Yes. the LaserWriter is a luxury.
For the number of times I need to
use one. the bike ride to Terman
or Copy Mat. plus the minimal
monetary expenditure, along with
the time wasted, are no big deal.
But 250 people (in the Cowell
Cluster alone) are not getting
their >225 worth. (That's
>56,250 to you and me, Rusty).
It also seems to me that a
LaserWriter situated among up
perclassmen would receive more
practical use; while not trying to
sound like a prick. I think
seniors, especially, could benefit.
Job applications, resumes and
cover letters are better candidates
for laser-quality printing than a
paper on Dante. But all seniors
and Juniors are forbidden to use
said LaserWriter, as are all but a
handful of sophomores.
I applaud Res Ed's policy of
putting computers and other
academic aids in student
residences. But until tools like
the LaserWriter are available in
every dorm, all students should

have access to University com
puters and printers around
campus.
For $ 17,000 per year, I could
get my own LaserWriter and Mac
Plus. Or I could draw into
Lagunita. But I can't print a
graduate school application on a
LaserWriter in Otero. Will some
body please tell me what logic lies
behind this nonsense? Or at least
gimme my 225 bucks.

Boycott grapes
Have you ever tried Captan on
your grapes? You probably
wouldn't want to, since Captan is
the major fungicide in wallpaper
pastes and in oil-based paints. It
is used in the treatment of vinyl
coated textiles such as mattress
covers, mats and curtains. It does
not cause immediate and obvious
harm, but it is a carcinogen,
causing birth defects and
changes in genetic material;
however, the grape growers of
California have decided that you
will have Captan with your
grapes.
Twenty-eight million pounds of
Captan are estimated to be used
annually in the world, one-third
of it in the United States alone. In
1983, about one million pounds
were used in agriculture in Cali
fornia, the largest use being on
grapes. Virtually nothing is
known of the long-term effects of
the pesticide residues for consu
mers. Most pesticides cannot be
The United Farm Workers
(UFW) experience with pesticides
is much more direct. The Califor
nia grape pickers have been con
stantly subjected to the misuse of
pesticides in the fields where they
work. In terms of deaths and
injuries, farm work is the third
most dangerous U.S. occupation.
The misuse of pesticides and the
carelessness that the owners
exercise in using chemicals have
caused a cancer rate in the
agricultural San Joaquin Valley
which is four times higher than
the expected rate.
Captan is responsible for the
birth of a child without arms and
legs. His mother worked during
the first three months of her
pregnancy picking grapes. It later
became known that the field had
been sprayed with teratogenic
pesticides.
Farm workers are forced to
treat produce with deadly pes
ticides without protective equip
ment — exposing themselves to
high risks of blindness and, un
fortunately, even higher risks of
death. No safety precautions are
taken in an effort to protect the
farm worker. Instead workers are
misinformed or not informed at
all about the dangers to which
they are exposed.
Grape boycotts were an effective
means of protest used by the farm
workers in the 1960s. Boycotts of
the previous decades won farm
workers the right for representa
tion in a union, the UFW. The
farm workers have pleaded to no
avail with their employers in
regard to the pesticide issue.
They now turn to the consumer
for help, help that can be given by
boycotting grapes and removing
them from the Stanford campus.
As a result of resolutions made
in the November statewide
MEChA conference, Stanford
MEChA has moved to aid the
farm worker. Although initial

pleas to food service have been
ignored, we believe that with
student support, our reiterated
requests will have more effect. We
will ensure that the boycott will
be publicized in order that it may
be an example to other campuses.
In this way, with your help, we
can eliminate the deadly risks of
pesticides for you, the consumer,
the farm worker and the commu
nity at large.

Censure won't
solve problem
I am not used to writing letters
in defense of Hoover Institution
Director W. Glenn Campbell, but
the recent unanimous vote of the
Faculty Senate criticizing his
comments about the "Reagan
connection" with Stanford raises
questions of academic freedom
that should be discussed.
The Hoover director spoke the
truth when he said the accep
tance of the Reagan Library by
University President Donald Ken
nedy and the Board of Trustees
honors Ronald Reagan. This is
how the Reagan Library, if it is
built on Stanford land, will be
perceived by the public, and no
disclaimers can alter this fact.
Accepting the Reagan Library
obviously does not represent a
University endorsement of all
Reagan policies, but Stanford
cannot credibly insist that in
receiving the Reagan Library all
we are doing is acquiring a schol
arly asset. Such claims will be
shown for what they are when
and if the tour buses start un
loading visitors at the "library."
When the senate debated the
Campbell resolution, acting Uni
versity President James Rosse
and others stated that W. Glenn
Campbell is an officer of Stan
ford. and that the Hoover Institu
tion is an institutional compo
nent of Stanford. This was the
apparent rationale behind the
conclusion that Campbell is in
some sense a University official,
and thus censurable for his offi
cial remarks.
In fact, the Hoover Institution
is at best an anomalous part of
Stanford. It is a highly autono
mous institution "within the
frame" of the University operating
under agreements that protect its
independence. An outside agency
has a decisive role in appointing
the director. Campbell revealed
an important and disturbing
truth when he said in the 1986
Hoover Annual Report that War
ren Christopher, President of the
Board of Trustees, had reaffirmed
the trustees' intention to abide
fully by the governance arrange
ments ensuring Hoover's contin
ued autonomy.
The problem of the Hoover
Institution at Stanford is not
what W. Glenn Campbell says.
but what Hoover does. If he or
another director stops saying it,
the problem will still be here.
Until the senate and the Stanford
Administration openly acknowl
edge this — and demonstrate the
courage to do something about it
— the Stanford community can
take only false pride in mis
directed reprisals at outspoken
individuals.
