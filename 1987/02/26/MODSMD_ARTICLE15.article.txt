# Not just maple leaves
## 
### 
One of the first things I noticed when I came to
Stanford was that each Daily columnist seemed to
have his or her own pet subject. Just for the record,
let me relieve some of your worries, and tell you what
I will not be writing about.
I have no invisible friends (however, I have some I
wish were inaudible).
I have several gay friends, none of whom seem any
more sinful than my heterosexual friends.
I find the idea of a Ronald Reagan Library so
ridiculous that it's hard for me to take seriously. Of
course, I find Ronald Reagan so ridiculous that he's
hard for me to take seriously.
I have never committed, nor been the victim of,
date rape.

I don't trust SDI, for the same reason 1 don't trust
my word processor. But then again, I'm uncomfort
able with any technology more advanced than a pen
cil sharpener.
I think AIDS, apartheid and murder are bad
things.
At this point, you're probably thinking,
"Wonderful. So why has The Daily got an opinion col
umnist who has no opinions?" Well, that was just
the good news. The bad news is that I have an obses
sion all my own. It's only fair to warn you about it. All
I can say in my defense is that it's probably not a
point of vfew you've heard before . . . unless, of
course, you have the bad fortune to be one of my
visible, audible friends.
You see, I am a Canadian. That's Canadian, with
a capital 'C.' Let me make clear that I wasn't a profes
sional Canadian until I moved to California. Six
months ago, I was just your average mild-mannered
citizen of Edmonton, Alberta. (That's Ed-mon-ton
[pop. 625,000), Al-ber-ta [pop. 2.5 million). Go to
Montana and drive straight north. For about a day.
Yes, the snow does melt in the summer. But
sometimes the mosquitos carry off small children. Be
warned.)
As I say. I never much thought about a Canadian
identity until I got down here. And then I realized
that I had to develop one, and quickly. I knew this as
soon as I started to answer questions from my first
few Americans.
"Oh, Alberta!" one said. "That's the one that bor
ders on Utah, right?"
A common response: "Heck, we just think of
Canada as the 51st state!" (We don't.)
"Really? Canada goes that far west? I always
thought it stopped at Vermont!" (I wanted to ask this
lady what she thought held Alaska up, but I
refrained. My mother always says, "You're a guest in
another country. Now be polite.")

Sorry, Mom. Sometimes it's tough. Like when
Northwestern University asked me to take the
TOEFL — the Test of English as a Foreign Language.
Don't be smug, Stanford. Several people here have
complimented me on my English.
At first, I thought I was hypersensitive. So what if
no one at Stanford knew that Edmonton had the
world's biggest shopping center or the world's
greatest hockey team? So what if no one here knew
that Canada, the true north strong and free, had
great literature, art and music, or outstanding
health care and social programs? Just enjoy the
weather, I told myself.
But I soon realized that I wasn't the only Super-
Canadian on campus. I met my neighbors Dave and
Leo. Dave and Leo decorate their trailer with
Canadian flags. They have a little gold maple leaf
hanging from the chandelier. They have an inflatable
Canadian Pacific airplane hanging from the ceiling.
They send out party invitations reading, "Americans
Welcome."
I met my classmate Eileen, another Albertan. who
hangs her room with posters of mounted police and
Rocky Mountains. She's training her American
fiance to call a garbage disposal a "garborator."
I bumped into my freshman friend Cam, who plans
to teach an undergraduate course in parliamentary
debate. I met another Edmontonian, Katy, who
taught Stanford's first course in Canadian
literature.
I realized that there were lots of Canadian students
at Stanford. Most of them seem to be almost as ob
noxiously Canadian as me. (I am probably more ob
noxious — period — but that's another story.)
It's odd to remember that back in Canada, many
people are concerned with cultural assimilation.
After all, there really aren't too many obvious differ
ences between Americans and Canadians, at least
not at first glance. But when I return home in June, I
think I'll have learned almost as much about Canada
as I have about the United States. This time in
America has given me a new perspective on my
country and a new appreciation of its strengths and
weaknesses. Most of all. it has made me feel that I
really am a Canadian. Wherever I might travel or live
there is something special about my national iden
tity that makes me different from an American, an
Australian or a Briton.
The funny thing is that I've ranted and raved about
Canada for so long that several of my classmates are
planning to visit this summer. This strikes me as a
fine idea. I know Canadians would fee) less resentful
toward Americans if Americans knew a bit more
about us. And it Is really a lovely country to see.
So, make a Canadian friend (there are hundreds of
us here) and come up to visit the second-largest
country in the world, America's biggest trading
partner and the only thing separating the United
States from the Soviet Union. There is more to the
Great White North than beer and back bacon.
In the words of Dave and Leo, "Americans
Welcome." Blenvenue, even.
