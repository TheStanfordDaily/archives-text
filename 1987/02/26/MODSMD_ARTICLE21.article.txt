## Resting and relaxing in Napa inns 
### ROB REID ELIZABETH HENDRICKS 
If you arid a friend are anxious
to escape for a weekend, the lovely
town of St. Helena, in the heart of
Napa Valley, could be the place for
you.
The picturesque rural town is
home to some of California's finest
wineries and is minutes south of
the famous hot springs of Calis
toga. The town's special charm
and relaxed pace are embodied in
the tradition of the bed and break
fast inn. The Wine Country Inn
and the Shady Oaks Country Inn
are two excellent examples of this
tradition.
The Wine Country Inn is the
larger of the two and offers more
extensive facilities, including a
swimming pool and a jacuzzi. The
much smaller Shady Oaks
Country Inn is able to offer more
individualized, personal service. It
also has the unusual benefit of
providing a full breakfast every
morning.
The Wine Country Inn is one of
Napa Valley's oldest inns. Us 26
spacious units all feature either a
private patio or balcony, and most
have fireplaces. All have private
baths and are individually deco
rated with country antiques. A

suite is also available which offers
a queen-size bed, sitting room and
wet bar, as well as a spectacular
view. None of the rooms has a tele
phone or a television, which con
tributes to the inn's feeling of
separation from the hectic "real"
world.
Jim Smith, the innkeeper, has
made this secluded, relaxed at
mosphere one of his top priorities.
In addition to the absence of
phones and televisions, he has
made it policy to keep morning
newspapers out of the breakfast
room unless they are specifically
requested by guests. This, he
says, makes breakfast a more so
cial environment in which guests
can get to know one another bet
ter.
Smith has worked with the Inn
since its opening 12 years ago,
when it was Napa Valley's only
large inn. Since then he has
resisted the growing trends of
commercialism in the area, and
has avoided opening a pricey gift
shop to sell personalized sweat
shirts and the like. Smith said
that this commercialism is the
only negative result of the Napa
region's growing popularity.
"The valley has changed for the
good. The tourist and wine
economies have made it possible

for native sons to stay here," he
said.
The inn offers a generous, self
service continental breakfast in
the morning. The homemade
granola cereal is not to be missed.
After breakfast, the staff is
available to help guests plan the
day's sightseeing and wine tast
ing, and to make appointments at
wineries if necessary. The staff is
one of the inn's greatest assets —
all of the employees are helpful,

friendly and knowledgeable, and
most grew up in the Napa Valley
area. Rooms start at $70 during
the week, and ®88 on the week
ends.
Compared to the Wine Country
Inn, the Shady Oaks Country Inn
is a small operation. It has to be,
because it is entirely run by only
two people. It is a love affair in the
truest sense. John and Lisa Rum

and service.
mell with their nine-year-old
daughter Brooke live on the
premises and do everything them
selves.
Although the buildings date
back to the 19205, the inn is best
described as brand new. It has
been completely renovated in the
past year. John and Lisa moved in
last February and opened for busi
ness a few weeks later.
The inn has four units. There
are two beautifully decorated old
fashioned rooms in the main
house as well as two larger rooms

in an adjacent building. Its
downstairs room is especially
romantic, and is often chosen by
honeymooners because of its
stone walls and king-size bed,
which has an ornate brass and
ivory headboard. All rooms have
private baths. Room rates range
from *75 to *90, with reduced
mid-week off-season rates avail
able.
The Rummells were successful
executives in restaurant manage
ment but burned out on the cor
porate world.
"One day we kind of looked
around and said there's got to be
more to life than the 'yuppie
dream,' so to speak." Lisa said.
