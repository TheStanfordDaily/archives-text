# Mexican: Change from burger, fries

La Fortuna

La Fortuna Is definitely not a
restaurant for a business lunch
or an important first date, but
if you have a slim budget and
you're with good lriends. La
Fortuna offers an excellent al
ternative to the standard
burger and fries.
The pale-green walls, shel
lacked wood tables and trophy
case set the casual mood. The
clatter of the open kitchen
echoes through the small
dining room, and conversation
of patrons is necessarily loud.
The red lanterns and Christ
mas lights cast a colorful glow
on the establishment. Even the
tlower lady, who circulates with
dyed blue carnations, adds to
the friendly atmosphere of La
Fortuna.
The menu is not particularly
original or extensive, but it
does contain the standard
Mexican fare: burritos, tacos,
enchiladas and tostadas.
I selected a house special, ta
quitos (flautas). These deep
fried tortillas were filled with
shredded beef and topped with
guacamole and sour cream.
The dish was mild and pleas
ant, but not outstanding. To
those diners unaccustomed to
the spice that usually domi
nates most Mexican dishes,
this would be an excellent
choice.
My friend chose the authen
tic red Mexican enchiladas. The
enchiladas were sauteed in a
red sauce of spices and herbs
and filled with fresh Mexican
cheese and topped with avo
cado slices. The milder of the
two enchiladas offered, the red

Mexican enchiladas were a bit
spicy and fairly good.
Along with our meal we also
sampled the La Fortuna Mar
garita de Vino. This tasty drink
was good, but not exceptional.
Sangria and a nice selection of
Mexican beers were also of
fered.
To end the meal, we enjoyed
burruelos; deep-fried batter
with sugar and cinnamon on
the top. For 50<T, this was
definitely worth the money.
La Fortuna was certainly an
experience in dining, and prob
ably one worth repeating. The
food was good and the price
was right â€” a perfect combina
tion for a college student's
budget.

Those who've only tried Com
padres for drinks should learn
it's much more than Mar
garitaville. This California-style
Mexican food restaraunt has
much to offer.
The atmosphere fits perfectly
the restaurant's young, yuppie
crowd. Inside, the Mexican
style tile and clay pottery ac
cents. combined with the
wicker and bamboo furniture,
spark images of tourist stops in
Mexican cities.
Appetizers are sure hits in
this place, with nachos and
guacamole that are definite
winners. For a change of pace,
my guest and I tried the
Tijuana won ton, a plate of
tasty flour tortilla rolls contain
ing chicken in a spicy cheese
sauce surrounded by fresh
lettuce, tomatoes, guacamole and
sour cream.
Main course selections included
the customary variety of Cal-Mex
dishes, from which 1 selected a
meal appropriately titled
"Maximo." My guest chose car
nitas.
The Maximo was served with
only a salad, since nothing else
was necessary to feed all but the
most hungry Cub Scout troop.

The salad came with a salsa dress
ing, bland but unusual. The Max
imo itself was a huge flour tortilla
hiding chunks of chicken mixed
with cheese. beans, rice,
guacamole and sour cream. Cover
ing the feast was a generous
amount of salsa and cheese sauce.
The carnitas entree was large
chunks of pork with sides of
beans, cheese, rice, salad and
flour tortillas. The pork was
slightly dry and too large to enjoy
struggling with once it was
wrapped inside the tortillas.
The staff is courteous and effi
cient, making a meal at this es
tablishment, if not a culinary
delight, at least quite pleasant.
