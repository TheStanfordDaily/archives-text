The Defiant Muse: Feminist Poems
From the Middle Ages to the Present
New York: The Feminist Press, 1986

"The Defiant Muse: Feminist Poems From
the Middle Ages to the Present" is not only a
welcome addition to anyone's bookshelf, but
also a candidate for inclusion in Western Cul
ture reading lists. This series of four bilingual
anthologies of French. German. Italian and
Hispanic poetry would form an excellent coun
terpoint to the predominantly masculinist
literature currently assigned.
What is a feminist poem? While the pub
lisher Insists that these anthologies are
"specifically of feminist poetry," specifying
what that means is left to the individual
editors. Although the refusal of feminist
criticism to fossilize into a single approach to
literature is one of its great strengths, the
editors' failure to agree on a definition of
poetry is distracting.
In her introduction to the Italian anthology,
Beverly Allen, an assistant professor of French
and Italian here, declares, "That the poems
were written at all may Itself be viewed as a
feminist act." The act of writing may be
feminist, but the absence of a critique of the
tradition in which the early poets write is dis
turbing. It may be true, for example, that the
life of Isabella di Morra (16th century) is a
prime example of the oppression of women
writers (as the excellent notes on the back at
test), but her poem employs the misogynist
conventions of the poetry of her male contem
poraries.
Nonetheless, powered by Muriel Kittel's

translations, the Italian anthology Is the most
consistently powerful of the four. Each poem is
a temptation to fill a suitcase with poetry by
women about women, retreat to the nearest
piazza, and simply read. Franca Maria Catri
voices the central Impulse of the defiant muse
in "Sister Mother": "I want to sing so strongly /
that the song could break my heart / and go on

living / without me."
Even in the early anonymous poems of the
Hispanic anthology we find blunt descriptions
of a culture that subjected its daughter to in
cest ("Delgadina") and virtual imprisonment
in convents ("My Parents as if Enemies"). The
poets repeatedly return to the burden of this
tradition, exploring Catholicism, motherhood
and domesticity and poisoned sexual rela
tions. The Hispanic anthology also expands
the scope of the series beyond Western Europe.
The Latin American poets relate their struggle
to racism (Nancy Morejon) and class oppres
sion (Giaconda Belli). Angela Figuera-
Aymerich's evocations of the continuing
feminization of poverty in"The Market
Women" and "Mothers" are particularly
moving.
Although Prof. Donna Stanton of the Univer
sity of Michigan provides a brilliant, indeed
defiant, introduction to the French anthology,

the collection Is disappointing. Many of the se
lections are pedantic and too long. Not until we
reach the early 20th-century lesbian poems of
Natalie Clifford Barney, Renee Vivien and
Laurie Delarue-Mardus do we find an emo
tional heart to this volume. Barney's love
poems ("Woman," "Couplets") are particularly
stunning, but suffer from strangely Imprecise
translations. The contemporary poems that
follow are often angry, cerebral, unconven
tional and stark. An exploration of French
Caribbean and African poetry would have
opened up the volume beyond what seems the
closed world of French feminism.
In contrast. Susan Cocalis, an associate pro
fessor of German at the University of Massa
chusetts at Amherst, packs the German an
thology with richly revisionist poetry. In the
13th century, Mechthild von Magdeburg
stretches the limits of courtly love poetry. Con
temporary poets (Angelika Mechtel. Sigrid
Weigel and others) provide savage, sarcastic,
even sympathetic renderings of middle-class
domesticity. In "Letter to Medea," Helga Novak
calls Euripides "the hack writer . . . / who
pinned infanticide on you." Susanna
Elisabeth Zeidler (17th century) speaks for
most, if not all, of the poets in this series when
she insists that "It's not poetic talents, it's the
time for them we lack."
These poems — celebrations of the female
body, diatribes against misogyny, testaments
to the communities of women and the con
tinuum of feminist writing — seem but the
beginning. Each of these poets deserves a biog
raphy, every poem demands serious critical at
tention and the body of work from which these
anthologies have been compiled deserves care
ful thought and thorough exploration.
