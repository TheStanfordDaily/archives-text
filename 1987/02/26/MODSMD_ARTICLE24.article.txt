# Radio Days': Woody Allen strikes again
## 
### MARK TOMPKINS Editorial staff 
The annual release of a new Woody Allen movie Is
an occasion for us film critics to grapple with our
thesauruses. as we eagerly hunker down and search
for new superlatives to describe Woody s work. And
with good reason, too — Woody Is the preeminent
American filmmaker. (This Isn't the sweeping state
ment It sounds like at first, admittedly. I mean, who
else is there?)
Woody has just unveiled his latest, "Radio Days,"
and yes, it's good. Wonderfully so. in fact. Ideas, tal
ent — by all accounts these are dirty words in Holly
wood nowadays, yet Woody's movies are overflowing
with them. Most artists tackle a wide variety of
themes early in their careers, and then focus on a
single unyielding obsession; Woody has done exactly
the opposite. His work was once stereotyped as being
solely concerned with his own neuroses and sexual
relationships (the two were inextricably Inter
twined). but now, with each movie, his canvas gets
broader and broader.

The release of a new Woody
Allen movie is an occasion
for us film critics to grapple
with our thesauruses, as we
eagerly hunker down and
search for new superlatives
to describe Woody's work.

But while Woody has opened up his work to deal
with strapping, expansive themes, he still makes
movies that are relatively tidy. Neatly understated,
they never fuss, never strain to make a point. And
they're never a minute too long, although he
reportedly cuts out tons of material from his original
scripts. For instance, "Annie Hall" was to have con
tained a scene where Allen and Diane Keaton's char
acters took an elevator trip to hell; in my mental
screening room I often try to imagine what such a
scene could be like.
Obviously, Woody has something that none of the
"Toys 'R' Us" school of directors has, something that
no amount of million-dollar special effects can beat: a
point of view.
The upshot of all this is that Woody is, in my book,
unimpeachable. His mastery of my favorite art form,

the one-liner, alone would make him worthy of
celebration; If he's a brilliant writer and director, so
much the better. My one gripe with the Wood-man is
that he occasionally turns Into a cultural commissar;
throughout the otherwise impeccable "Hannah and
Her Sisters" he wags his finger at the audience, tel
ling us that things like punk rock are evil, that they
are worthless. Indeed, the whole movie drips with al
lusions to high culture. Sometimes it seems like his
solutions to all our problems would be to lock every
one in a room with a collection of Heinrich 801 l short
stories.
"Radio Days" has nothing to do with high culture;
it lowers its sights to the level of popular culture, spe
cifically the golden age of radio. Set in New York
during World War 11, "Radio Days" looks at how radio
affected peoples' lives through an anecdotal style of
loosely related vignettes. The movie centers around a
lower-class Jewish family in Rockaway — hardly
ground-breaking territory for Allen. Drawing from
his own youth, it's a milieu he's portrayed in "Annie

Hall" and various other films, and it had seemed like
the play "The Floating Light Bulb" was the last gasp
he could possibly draw from the subject. But here he
makes the setting fresh and funny again, creating a
touching family of comic oddities. They each derive
something special from radio: the maiden Aunt Bea
(Dianne Wiest) finds a romantic promise in the
smooth, crooning love songs of the day, while the
young boy Joe (Seth Green, Allen's stand-in) listens
to the pulpy, Nazi-busting exploits of heroes with
names like Biff Baxter and The Masked Adventurer.
In contrast to this low-rent family and its underlit
three-story house is the milieu of the radio stars,
silky Noel Coward-types who inhabit a world of pala
tial skyscrapers and glittering art deco. Desperate to
break into that world and radio performing is Sally
White (Mia Farrow), a squeaky-voiced cigarette girl.
"Radio Days" doesn't have a standard plot, but it
doesn't need one. The vignette style lets Woody run
all over the place, and many of the scenes he comes
up with are real winners. A romantic moment is

spoiled by Orson Welles' 1938 broadcast of a Martian
invasion. The Masked Adventurer warns kids to be
on the lookout for Nazi subs along the coast, so Joe
and his friends take to the rooftops with binoculars,
only to spy their schoolteacher dancing naked in a
window. Sally White s first on-the-air reading is in
terrupted by the broadcast of the Pearl Harbor at
tack, and she asks, "Who's Pearl Harbor?
All the levity and good spirits come to a halt in a
surprisingly affecting scene where a news reporter
broadcasts updates on an attempt to rescue a little
girl trapped in a tunnel. All work ceases as everyone
is riveted by the drama; the working-class family,
people in bars, news vendors and posh members of
drawing-room society all sit paralyzed by their
radios, waiting for details. When the rescue attempt
ends in tragedy, rich and poor alike are devastated.
Because this is a Woody Allen movie, there aren't
any bad or even mediocre performances, and good
actors turn up everywhere, even in the most minute
parts. Wallace Shaun, Danny Aiello, Jeff Daniels and
(be still, my heart) Diane Keaton have cameo roles,
Keaton's being particularly lovely, as she sings a Cole
Porter number at a New Year's celebration. Special
mention must be made of Seth Green as Joe; a
charming waif, he looks exactly like Woody Allen.
(Where do they come from, these little Woody-alikes?
He must keep a private stock of them somewhere.)
A delightful surprise is how sharp-looking this
movie is. It's boring to say a movie is 'beautifully
photgraphed' or whatever nowadays — all new
movies seem to have a certain degree of slickness —
but here Woody is hot stuff when it comes to compos
ing his shots. He can really direct, without Directing,
if my meaning is understood. He's arty, but his
camera never trips up his story.
Like "Broadway Danny Rose," "The Purple Rose of
Cairo," "Hannah," et al, "Radio Days" nimbly jumps
from humor to poignancy throughout. It's un
abashedly sentimental without being mawkish. And
it's never stuffy; Allen's sense of humor and life's un
derlying absurdity balance his pretensions, so that
"Radio Days," like the above films, never has the air
of rarified solemnity that distinguishes so many
other Critically Acclaimed Motion Pictures. Allen's
exuberant lower-class grotesqueries would be way
out of place in a Merchant-Ivory film.
At the opening of "Annie Hail, woody quotes
Groucho Marx and says,"I would never want to
belong to any club that would have me as a member."
He's describing his relations with women, but I
think that telling line also describes his position vis
a-vis intellectuals. In "Radio Days" he looks at
popular art's effects on the lives of ordinary people,
realizing, as Vladimir Nabokov put it, "There is noth
ing so invigorating as Philistine vulgarity." Way to
go, Woody.

are worthless. Indeed, the whole movie drips with al
lusions to high culture. Sometimes it seems like his
solutions to all our problems would be to lock every
one in a room with a collection of Heinrich 801 l short
stories.
"Radio Days" has nothing to do with high culture;
it lowers its sights to the level of popular culture, spe
cifically the golden age of radio. Set in New York
during World War 11, "Radio Days" looks at how radio
affected peoples' lives through an anecdotal style of
loosely related vignettes. The movie centers around a
lower-class Jewish family in Rockaway — hardly
ground-breaking territory for Allen. Drawing from
his own youth, it's a milieu he's portrayed in "Annie

Hall" and various other films, and it had seemed like
the play "The Floating Light Bulb" was the last gasp
he could possibly draw from the subject. But here he
makes the setting fresh and funny again, creating a
touching family of comic oddities. They each derive
something special from radio: the maiden Aunt Bea
(Dianne Wiest) finds a romantic promise in the
smooth, crooning love songs of the day, while the
young boy Joe (Seth Green, Allen's stand-in) listens
to the pulpy, Nazi-busting exploits of heroes with
names like Biff Baxter and The Masked Adventurer.
In contrast to this low-rent family and its underlit
three-story house is the milieu of the radio stars,
silky Noel Coward-types who inhabit a world of pala
tial skyscrapers and glittering art deco. Desperate to
break into that world and radio performing is Sally
White (Mia Farrow), a squeaky-voiced cigarette girl.
"Radio Days" doesn't have a standard plot, but it
doesn't need one. The vignette style lets Woody run
all over the place, and many of the scenes he comes
up with are real winners. A romantic moment is

spoiled by Orson Welles' 1938 broadcast of a Martian
invasion. The Masked Adventurer warns kids to be
on the lookout for Nazi subs along the coast, so Joe
and his friends take to the rooftops with binoculars,
only to spy their schoolteacher dancing naked in a
window. Sally White s first on-the-air reading is in
terrupted by the broadcast of the Pearl Harbor at
tack, and she asks, "Who's Pearl Harbor?
All the levity and good spirits come to a halt in a
surprisingly affecting scene where a news reporter
broadcasts updates on an attempt to rescue a little
girl trapped in a tunnel. All work ceases as everyone
is riveted by the drama; the working-class family,
people in bars, news vendors and posh members of
drawing-room society all sit paralyzed by their
radios, waiting for details. When the rescue attempt
ends in tragedy, rich and poor alike are devastated.
Because this is a Woody Allen movie, there aren't
any bad or even mediocre performances, and good
actors turn up everywhere, even in the most minute
parts. Wallace Shaun, Danny Aiello, Jeff Daniels and
(be still, my heart) Diane Keaton have cameo roles,
Keaton's being particularly lovely, as she sings a Cole
Porter number at a New Year's celebration. Special
mention must be made of Seth Green as Joe; a
charming waif, he looks exactly like Woody Allen.
(Where do they come from, these little Woody-alikes?
He must keep a private stock of them somewhere.)
A delightful surprise is how sharp-looking this
movie is. It's boring to say a movie is 'beautifully
photgraphed' or whatever nowadays — all new
movies seem to have a certain degree of slickness —
but here Woody is hot stuff when it comes to compos
ing his shots. He can really direct, without Directing,
if my meaning is understood. He's arty, but his
camera never trips up his story.
Like "Broadway Danny Rose," "The Purple Rose of
Cairo," "Hannah," et al, "Radio Days" nimbly jumps
from humor to poignancy throughout. It's un
abashedly sentimental without being mawkish. And
it's never stuffy; Allen's sense of humor and life's un
derlying absurdity balance his pretensions, so that
"Radio Days," like the above films, never has the air
of rarified solemnity that distinguishes so many
other Critically Acclaimed Motion Pictures. Allen's
exuberant lower-class grotesqueries would be way
out of place in a Merchant-Ivory film.
At the opening of "Annie Hail, woody quotes
Groucho Marx and says,"I would never want to
belong to any club that would have me as a member."
He's describing his relations with women, but I
think that telling line also describes his position vis
a-vis intellectuals. In "Radio Days" he looks at
popular art's effects on the lives of ordinary people,
realizing, as Vladimir Nabokov put it, "There is noth
ing so invigorating as Philistine vulgarity." Way to
go, Woody.

Diane Keaton returns to the Woody Allen fold with a cameo appearance in "Radio Days." Like other
Woody Allen movies, this one is overflowing with talent and ideas, and well-known performers like Keaton
turn up in even the most minute parts.
The annual release of a new Woody Allen movie Is
an occasion for us film critics to grapple with our
thesauruses. as we eagerly hunker down and search
for new superlatives to describe Woody s work. And
with good reason, too — Woody Is the preeminent
American filmmaker. (This Isn't the sweeping state
ment It sounds like at first, admittedly. I mean, who
else is there?)
Woody has just unveiled his latest, "Radio Days,"
and yes, it's good. Wonderfully so. in fact. Ideas, tal
ent — by all accounts these are dirty words in Holly
wood nowadays, yet Woody's movies are overflowing
with them. Most artists tackle a wide variety of
themes early in their careers, and then focus on a
single unyielding obsession; Woody has done exactly
the opposite. His work was once stereotyped as being
solely concerned with his own neuroses and sexual
relationships (the two were inextricably Inter
twined). but now, with each movie, his canvas gets
broader and broader.

The release of a new Woody
Allen movie is an occasion
for us film critics to grapple
with our thesauruses, as we
eagerly hunker down and
search for new superlatives
to describe Woody's work.

But while Woody has opened up his work to deal
with strapping, expansive themes, he still makes
movies that are relatively tidy. Neatly understated,
they never fuss, never strain to make a point. And
they're never a minute too long, although he
reportedly cuts out tons of material from his original
scripts. For instance, "Annie Hall" was to have con
tained a scene where Allen and Diane Keaton's char
acters took an elevator trip to hell; in my mental
screening room I often try to imagine what such a
scene could be like.
Obviously, Woody has something that none of the
"Toys 'R' Us" school of directors has, something that
no amount of million-dollar special effects can beat: a
point of view.
The upshot of all this is that Woody is, in my book,
unimpeachable. His mastery of my favorite art form,

the one-liner, alone would make him worthy of
celebration; If he's a brilliant writer and director, so
much the better. My one gripe with the Wood-man is
that he occasionally turns Into a cultural commissar;
throughout the otherwise impeccable "Hannah and
Her Sisters" he wags his finger at the audience, tel
ling us that things like punk rock are evil, that they
are worthless. Indeed, the whole movie drips with al
lusions to high culture. Sometimes it seems like his
