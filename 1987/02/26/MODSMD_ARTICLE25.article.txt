## More than usual at stake as Stanford battles 'Cats 
### SUSAN SLUSSER Editorial staff 
In order to finish in sixth place in the
Pacific 10 Conference — and thus
receive a bye in the first round of the
Pac-10 Post-Season Tournament — the
Stanford men's basketball team must
win its final two regular season games at
home this weekend.
There's one problem, however.
Tonight's game (7:30, KCBS 740 AM.
KZSU 90.1 FM) is against Arizona.
Arizona Is In second place in the Pac
-10. and could repeat as league cham
pion if UCLA loses to USC tonight at
Pauley Pavilion and the Wildcats defeat
both Stanford and California this
weekend. As if that weren't enough in
centive for the 'Cats, who are 12-4 in the
conference and 17-9 overall, there are al
ways the memories of Stanford's 62-56
upset win over Arizona last year at
Maples Pavilion — one of only four
Wildcat league losses.
The Wildcats have won four straight
after consecutive losses to lowa and
UCLA. Stanford won its most recent
game at home against California, but
has won only three of its last 10 and Is
now 7-9 in the Pac-10 and 13-12 overall.
Earlier this season, Arizona defeated
the Cardinal 77-70 in Tucson as sopho
more forward Sean Elliot scored a
career-high 35 points and added 13
rebounds.
The 6-foot-8 Elliot was named Pac-10
Player of the Week for the past week after
scoring 17 points in a home win over
USC last Tuesday, 13 points in a home
win over Washington State last
Thursday and 22 points along with a
career-high nine assists, seven

rebounds and two blocked shots in a
win over Washington at Tucson.
"He's a very good basketball player,"
Stanford Coach Mike Montgomery said.
"You have to locate Elliot, you have to
flatten him, and you've got to keep him
off the boards. He had a lot of points in
the first half (of Arizona's win earlier
this season) against the zone off the
boards and we can't let that happen
again.
"We're going to have to locate him a
little better," Montgomery added. "He's a
guy that can have that kind of night.
Hopefully he won't have that kind of
night again. We just have to do a better
job of defending him."
"We have to play him straight-up
defensively," Stanford forward Todd
Lichti agreed, "and locate him a little bit
quicker. We have to be more aware of
where he is. Last time he had some nice
open shots. We can't give him those."
Lichti and Elliot match up extremely
well, and the battle between the two
sophomore stars should be the most in
teresting confrontation in tonight's
game. Apart from the difference in
height (Lichti is four inches shorter at 6-
4), the similarities between the two are
uncanny:
□ Lichti was named to the All-Pac-10
team last year as a freshman. Elliot was
named Freshman of the Year along with
UCLA's Pooh Richardson, although nei
ther was named to the All-Pac-10 Team
with Lichti, who strangely enough, was
not one of the Freshmen of the Year.
□ Lichti finished fourth in the Pac-10 in
scoring last year after averaging 17.2
points per game. Elliot was seventh with
15.6 points per game.
□ This season, both forwards are again

leading their squads in scoring. Elliot is
averaging 18.6 points per game, seventh
in the conference, while Lichti is right
behind in eighth with 17.7 points per
game.
□ Lichti is shooting .515 from the floor.
Elliot is shooting .514.
□ Lichti is averaging 6.0 rebounds per
game, Elliot 5.8.
□ Both are about to become 1,000 point
scorers as sophomores — Elliot has
totalled 982 in 58 games with the
Wildcats, while Lichti has amassed 958
in 55 games for Stanford. Elliot may
pass the 1,000 point barrier this even
ing, while Lichti only needs to average
14 points per game in his final three
contests to reach the same plateau.
Only two players from Pac-10 schools
have scored 1,000 points as sophomores
— Arizona's Bob Elliot (no relation to
Sean) and Steve Puidokas of Washing
ton State. Oddly enough, both acheived
the feat in the same season (1975-7t).
□ Lichti has scored in double figures in
52 of 55 games in his Stanford career.
Elliot has had double figures in 53 of 58
games as a Wildcat.
□ Lichti also had a good week last week,
collecting 26 points in Stanford's 88-80
win over Cal, and was nominated for
Pac-10 Player of the Week.
Though all eyes might be turned to the
Lichti-Elliot showdown, Arizona
features several other noteworthy
players, including three others in double
figures: center Tom Tolbert (14.4 points
and 6.7 rebounds per game), guard
Craig McMillan (13 points and 3.5
rebounds per game) and forward An
thony Cook (10.1 points and a team
high 7.3 rebounds per game).

□ Lichti finished fourth in the Pac-10 in
scoring last year after averaging 17.2
points per game. Elliot was seventh with
15.6 points per game.
□ This season, both forwards are again

leading their squads in scoring. Elliot is
averaging 18.6 points per game, seventh
in the conference, while Lichti is right
behind in eighth with 17.7 points per
game.
□ Lichti is shooting .515 from the floor.
Elliot is shooting .514.
□ Lichti is averaging 6.0 rebounds per
game, Elliot 5.8.
□ Both are about to become 1,000 point
scorers as sophomores — Elliot has
totalled 982 in 58 games with the
Wildcats, while Lichti has amassed 958
in 55 games for Stanford. Elliot may
pass the 1,000 point barrier this even
ing, while Lichti only needs to average
14 points per game in his final three
contests to reach the same plateau.
Only two players from Pac-10 schools
have scored 1,000 points as sophomores
— Arizona's Bob Elliot (no relation to
Sean) and Steve Puidokas of Washing
ton State. Oddly enough, both acheived
the feat in the same season (1975-7t).
□ Lichti has scored in double figures in
52 of 55 games in his Stanford career.
Elliot has had double figures in 53 of 58
games as a Wildcat.
□ Lichti also had a good week last week,
collecting 26 points in Stanford's 88-80
win over Cal, and was nominated for
Pac-10 Player of the Week.
Though all eyes might be turned to the
Lichti-Elliot showdown, Arizona
features several other noteworthy
players, including three others in double
figures: center Tom Tolbert (14.4 points
and 6.7 rebounds per game), guard
Craig McMillan (13 points and 3.5
rebounds per game) and forward An
thony Cook (10.1 points and a team
high 7.3 rebounds per game).

Last Sunday, Stanford was able to roll past California, but tonight's game against
Arizona should be more of a nail-biter for Scott Meinert and his Cardinal teammates.
The Wildcats are in second place in the Pac-10.
In order to finish in sixth place in the
Pacific 10 Conference — and thus
receive a bye in the first round of the
Pac-10 Post-Season Tournament — the
Stanford men's basketball team must
win its final two regular season games at
home this weekend.
There's one problem, however.
Tonight's game (7:30, KCBS 740 AM.
KZSU 90.1 FM) is against Arizona.
Arizona Is In second place in the Pac
-10. and could repeat as league cham
pion if UCLA loses to USC tonight at
Pauley Pavilion and the Wildcats defeat
both Stanford and California this
weekend. As if that weren't enough in
centive for the 'Cats, who are 12-4 in the
conference and 17-9 overall, there are al
ways the memories of Stanford's 62-56
upset win over Arizona last year at
Maples Pavilion — one of only four
Wildcat league losses.
The Wildcats have won four straight
after consecutive losses to lowa and
UCLA. Stanford won its most recent
game at home against California, but
has won only three of its last 10 and Is
now 7-9 in the Pac-10 and 13-12 overall.
Earlier this season, Arizona defeated
the Cardinal 77-70 in Tucson as sopho
more forward Sean Elliot scored a
career-high 35 points and added 13
rebounds.
The 6-foot-8 Elliot was named Pac-10
Player of the Week for the past week after
scoring 17 points in a home win over
USC last Tuesday, 13 points in a home
win over Washington State last
Thursday and 22 points along with a
career-high nine assists, seven

rebounds and two blocked shots in a
win over Washington at Tucson.
"He's a very good basketball player,"
Stanford Coach Mike Montgomery said.
"You have to locate Elliot, you have to
flatten him, and you've got to keep him
off the boards. He had a lot of points in
the first half (of Arizona's win earlier
this season) against the zone off the
boards and we can't let that happen
again.
"We're going to have to locate him a
little better," Montgomery added. "He's a
guy that can have that kind of night.
Hopefully he won't have that kind of
night again. We just have to do a better
job of defending him."
"We have to play him straight-up
defensively," Stanford forward Todd
Lichti agreed, "and locate him a little bit
quicker. We have to be more aware of
where he is. Last time he had some nice
open shots. We can't give him those."
Lichti and Elliot match up extremely
well, and the battle between the two
sophomore stars should be the most in
teresting confrontation in tonight's
game. Apart from the difference in
height (Lichti is four inches shorter at 6-
4), the similarities between the two are
uncanny:
□ Lichti was named to the All-Pac-10
team last year as a freshman. Elliot was
named Freshman of the Year along with
UCLA's Pooh Richardson, although nei
ther was named to the All-Pac-10 Team
with Lichti, who strangely enough, was
not one of the Freshmen of the Year.
□ Lichti finished fourth in the Pac-10 in
scoring last year after averaging 17.2
points per game. Elliot was seventh with
15.6 points per game.
□ This season, both forwards are again

leading their squads in scoring. Elliot is
averaging 18.6 points per game, seventh
in the conference, while Lichti is right
behind in eighth with 17.7 points per
game.
□ Lichti is shooting .515 from the floor.
Elliot is shooting .514.
□ Lichti is averaging 6.0 rebounds per
game, Elliot 5.8.
□ Both are about to become 1,000 point
scorers as sophomores — Elliot has
totalled 982 in 58 games with the
Wildcats, while Lichti has amassed 958
in 55 games for Stanford. Elliot may
pass the 1,000 point barrier this even
