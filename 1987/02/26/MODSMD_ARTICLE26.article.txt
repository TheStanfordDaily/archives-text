# Spikers pushed, but still beat Cal

### ALICIA KENT Staff writer 
In a surprise effort by California last night at
Maples Pavilion, the club team won a game off Stan
ford, although the Bears eventually lost the non
conference match 15-6, 15-9, 13-15, 15-5.
Stanford, No. 7 in the Western Intercollegiate Vol
leyball Association, is now 13-7 overall, while Cal is
12-9.
"Berkeley played a full match," said David
Johnson, who started as an outside hitter in the
second and third games. "We had a great time out
there."
Because the Cardinal did not expect tough compe

tition from the Bears, who are a club team in the
Northern California Collegiate Volleyball League,
Stanford was able to experiment with a new lineup
and work on mental strategy. However, as was evi
dent in the third game, the players lost their concen
tration and allowed both hitting and mental errors to
take over.
"We lost our concentration a little bit," Stanford
Asst. Coach Ruben Nieves said. "We have not mas
tered the idea of playing all out in all circumstances.
We still have a ways to go in that respect."
In the first game, the new lineup made its debut,
although not in full force. Junior Scott Fortune, who
leads the team with 10 service aces and 30 block as
sists, was out with a sore ankle. Senior John McDer

mott started the match instead with senior Stephen
Blue and the four freshmen, setter Parker Blackman,
Dan Hanan, Craig Forsyth and Kent Steffes.
Although it took this formation the first 12 points
to establish itself, at 6-6 Stanford went on a powerful
winning streak, not losing a point for the rest of the
game.
In games two and three. Stanford Coach Fred
Sturm opted to bring in four new players. Senior set
ter Steve Modory led Forsyth, Hanan, Dave Johnson,
Brad Nelson and Steffes to a clear-cut win in game
two. "Modory set pretty darn well. He was mixing up
the offense which kept Cal off balance," Nieves said.
The third game came as a shock to the Cardinal,
which was not able to take the lead throughout the
entire game. "Stanford looked a little flat out there,"
Cal Coach David Nichols said. "I was pleased with
our effort. It was a real good accomplishment for our
team."
"The Weenies had a career effort on defense
tonight," Stanford Manager Chris Crader said.
Able to re-establish itself for the fourth and final
game, Stanford took over in the beginning of the
game to win the match. Blue, who currently leads the
team with 105 kills and 72 digs In conference games,
re-entered the match at the start of the game to help
the struggling Cardinal.
The power hitters in last night's match were
Hanan with a .577 hitting percentage and Steffes
with a .576 percentage. "Both had very good
matches, especially hitting," Nieves said.
In addition to leading the Cardinal in digs with 14
each and in block assists with three each, Steffes
and Hanan dominated the match offensively with 22
and 18 kills, respectively.
"Hanan and Steffes were hitting well," said
Modory. who played in three out of the four games,
although he has not started a match since a Jan. 29
loss to UC-Santa Barbara. "I definitely see a lot of im
provement there."
"Modory played really well. He was setting everyone
pretty evenly," Johnson said.
In addition to Modory's reappearance, back court
specialists Johnson and Nelson played last night.
"Tonight was a chance for improvement. The experi
ence of playing has got to help them become better
players," Nieves said.
"It was interesting to play with a different group of
guys," Modory said. "I think our win shows we have a
lot of depth. It felt good to be out there."
