# Card women face Arizona
## 
### PABLO MORALES Staff writer 
Tonight in Tucson. Ariz., the Stanford women's
basketball team begins the final stretch of its
1986-87 season a few strides shy, perhaps, of any
postseason invitation. But the Cardinal still could
salvage a very successful year with a strong finish
ing kick.
Despite six Pacific 10 Conference losses in its
last seven games, the Cardinal has been able to
grasp hold of sixth place in the league, with the
fifth spot still within reach.
Lately, a streaking California squad has signifi
cantly loosened Stanford's hold on sixth place by
winning four games in a row. The rejuvenated
Bears now share sixth place with the 6-8 Card
inal, and both teams are just one game away from
the fifth-place Oregon State Beavers.
The 12-12 Cardinal can keep pace with Cal and
keep pressure on the Beavers with a couple of
strong performances in Arizona, starting tonight
with the 3-12 Wildcats.
Arizona experienced a string of bad luck last
week, losing starting guard Miroslava 'Lava'
Acosta — who was involved in an auto accident —
for three games and starter Yolanda Turner —
who contracted chicken pox — for two games.
On top of these mishaps, the Wildcats earned a
bit of distinction in the Pac-10 last Thursday
when they became the first team to lose to Wash
ington State this season. The Wildcats (10-16
overall) are tied for eighth place in the conference
with Arizona State.
Despite their recent tribulations, Arizona, al
ways tough at home, may still pose a bit of diffi
culty for the Cardinal, which has not won in Tuc
son since the 1980-81 season. Unfortunate, too,
for Stanford will be the return of Cardinal-killer
Acosta and Turner to the Wildcat lineup.
Junior Kami Anderson continues to lead the
Cardinal in scoring at a clip of 14.6 points per
game. She needs just 10 points to become the
seventh player in Stanford history to score 1,000
career points.
