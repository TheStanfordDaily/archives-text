# Rapp's future hinges on her sore knees

Susan Rapp should have been
on top of the world after the 1984
Olympics. She had won a silver
medal In the 200-meter breast
stroke that summer and was re
turning to the Farm after helping
the Cardinal to a second-place
NCAA finish with an outstanding
freshman swimming season.
However, things weren't as rosy
as they seemed. After all the hype,
the Olympics had not met Rapp s
admittedly lofty expectations,
and, worse, her knees were both
ering her due to a painful
deterioration in their sinovial
linings.
"During the Olympics my knees
were pretty bad," said Rapp, who
is now a senior. "The Olympics
wasn't what I was expecting it to
be. I started thinking what's the
point of going fast if you get to the
meet and it's not as fun as you
want it to be.
"Major questions were coming
to my mind. It was really bother
ing me. I went back to school, and
they (the knees) just kept getting
worse."
A ray of hope appeared in No
vember in the form of arthro

scopic surgery on both knees,
Rapp said the inside of her knees
looked like "cotton candy," and
the surgeon could do little more
than remove the frayed bits of the
sinovial linings.
Still, Rapp's knees continued to
deteriorate. Despite rest and the
surgery, "I'd be sitting In class and
get shooting pains in my knees,"
she said.
While Rapp was undergoing the
physical trauma of her injuries,
she was also undergoing a mental
upheaval as a new influence
moved into her life. During fall
quarter she had begun accompa
nying some friends to Bible
studies and doing some Scripture
reading on her own.
"I'm a pretty cynical person,"
she said. "I was reading the Bible
a lot. I felt like a pretty good, moral
person, but there was something
pinching at me. I didn't see how
the pieces fit together."
She began reading the works of
Christian scholar C.S. Lewis, "His
book, 'Mere Christianity,' helped
me put the puzzle together," she
said. "I'd believe at night, and
then in the morning I'd go and
say, 'Forget it â€” no way.' " After
a week of soul-searching, Rapp

said, "God brought me to Him and
said. 'This is the meaning of life.'
(Now) Jesus is the most important
thing in my life. My relationship
pervades every aspect of my life."
Still, her knees failed to im
prove. and what would have been
her sophomore season turned into
a medical redshirt year.
"I would pray that God would
heal my knees, but they didn't get
better, and I couldn't figure out
why," Rapp said. "It was like,
'You've got to heal my knees, be
cause I have to swim.' I couldn't
give it up until fall quarter."
Finally Rapp's knees began to
come around. It wasn't until the
last dual meet of the season last
year, though, that she was able to
swim the breaststroke com
petitively. Nonetheless, she fin
ished second at the NCAAs in the
200 breaststroke and this year
has regained her spot as
America's best in the event.
She has also assumed a leader
ship role as co-captain of a young
Stanford team. Rapp is the only
senior on the team, which is
looking to break Texas' string of
three straight NCAA titles.

Though she swims in constant pain due to deterioration in both knees, Stanford's Susan Rapp is still the
team leader. She is also "the most underrated national swimmer in the country," according to Stanford
Coach George Haines.
