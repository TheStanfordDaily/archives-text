# Rapp's future hinges on her sore knees
## 
### BRENDAN HEALEY Senior staff writer 
Susan Rapp should have been
on top of the world after the 1984
Olympics. She had won a silver
medal In the 200-meter breast
stroke that summer and was re
turning to the Farm after helping
the Cardinal to a second-place
NCAA finish with an outstanding
freshman swimming season.
However, things weren't as rosy
as they seemed. After all the hype,
the Olympics had not met Rapp s
admittedly lofty expectations,
and, worse, her knees were both
ering her due to a painful
deterioration in their sinovial
linings.
"During the Olympics my knees
were pretty bad," said Rapp, who
is now a senior. "The Olympics
wasn't what I was expecting it to
be. I started thinking what's the
point of going fast if you get to the
meet and it's not as fun as you
want it to be.
"Major questions were coming
to my mind. It was really bother
ing me. I went back to school, and
they (the knees) just kept getting
worse."
A ray of hope appeared in No
vember in the form of arthro

scopic surgery on both knees,
Rapp said the inside of her knees
looked like "cotton candy," and
the surgeon could do little more
than remove the frayed bits of the
sinovial linings.
Still, Rapp's knees continued to
deteriorate. Despite rest and the
surgery, "I'd be sitting In class and
get shooting pains in my knees,"
she said.
While Rapp was undergoing the
physical trauma of her injuries,
she was also undergoing a mental
upheaval as a new influence
moved into her life. During fall
quarter she had begun accompa
nying some friends to Bible
studies and doing some Scripture
reading on her own.
"I'm a pretty cynical person,"
she said. "I was reading the Bible
a lot. I felt like a pretty good, moral
person, but there was something
pinching at me. I didn't see how
the pieces fit together."
She began reading the works of
Christian scholar C.S. Lewis, "His
book, 'Mere Christianity,' helped
me put the puzzle together," she
said. "I'd believe at night, and
then in the morning I'd go and
say, 'Forget it — no way.' " After
a week of soul-searching, Rapp

said, "God brought me to Him and
said. 'This is the meaning of life.'
(Now) Jesus is the most important
thing in my life. My relationship
pervades every aspect of my life."
Still, her knees failed to im
prove. and what would have been
her sophomore season turned into
a medical redshirt year.
"I would pray that God would
heal my knees, but they didn't get
better, and I couldn't figure out
why," Rapp said. "It was like,
'You've got to heal my knees, be
cause I have to swim.' I couldn't
give it up until fall quarter."
Finally Rapp's knees began to
come around. It wasn't until the
last dual meet of the season last
year, though, that she was able to
swim the breaststroke com
petitively. Nonetheless, she fin
ished second at the NCAAs in the
200 breaststroke and this year
has regained her spot as
America's best in the event.
She has also assumed a leader
ship role as co-captain of a young
Stanford team. Rapp is the only
senior on the team, which is
looking to break Texas' string of
three straight NCAA titles.
"She's a great leader," Stanford

Though she swims in constant pain due to deterioration in both knees, Stanford's Susan Rapp is still the
team leader. She is also "the most underrated national swimmer in the country," according to Stanford
Coach George Haines.
Coach George Haines said of
Rapp. "She's able to get people
around her to do things. They
don't want to let her down. She
swims in pain every day. People
see that."
According to Rapp. "Our team is
really important to me this year.
[It's] the closest team I've ever been
on. That's the strength of our
team. To see this (togetherness)
continue to grow is a big con
cern."
In addition to being one of Stan
ford's big guns. Rapp is "the most
underrated national swimmer in
the country." according to Haines.
Rapp also played a part in the
recruitment of freshman phenom
enon Michelle Griglione. Both are
from Alexandria, Va.. and Grig

lione had met Rapp years ago
through Rapp's younger sister
Chris.
"I would have killed her If she
hadn't gone here," said Rapp, who
hosted Griglione on her visit and
called her several times.
Griglione credited Rapp with
playing "the greatest role of
anybody on the team besides
George" with her recruitment.
"Just the fact that knowing people
like Susan were on the team made
me want to come here."
Rapp was also drawn to Stan
ford by someone on the team.
"My sister Jenny was here as a
sophomore, and all she talked
about was Stanford this, Stanford
that."
Rapp came to the Farm as a
highly touted recruit having
already been a member of the
1980 Olympic team, but her
swimming career had started
rather inauspiciously.

An "army brat" — her father Is a
colonel In the Corps of Engineers
— Rapp competed In her first race
at West Point as a six-year-old and
"ended up hating swimming."
After moving to Alexandria,
Rapp decided to follow in her older
sister's wake and began swim
ming with the Starlit Aquatic
Club. She progressed rapidly and
made her first senior national
meet at the age of 14 and the
Olympic team the next year.
Some argue that breaststrokers
are born, not made, and Rapp ad
mitted, "I guess I am born for the
event."
According to Griglione, Rapp
has a "feel for the water."
"She has great rhythm," Haines
added.
The Cardinal will be looking for
Rapp to lead It to the champion
ship in the inaugural Pacific 10
Conference meet beginning to
morrow. She will also be counted

on to help wrest the NCAA cham
pionship from Texas In March
(she compiled the sixth-highest
point total with 52 at last year's
meet), but beyond that Rapp's fu
ture is undecided.
She has a year of eligibility
remaining from her redshirt
season and Is planning on going
co-term in human biology, but
those plans, as well as her Olym
pic hopes for 1988, are contingent
upon her knees staying relatively
pain-free.
Rapp said she already ices her
knees every day and is unable to
ride a bike. "1 kind of have said
that if my knees get bad enough to
take anti-inflammatory [medi
cine). I'll quit."
Haines, meanwhile, is hoping
Rapp will come back for her final
year.
"It would be nice to have about a
dozen Susan Rapps," he said.
"She's just a great girl."

Finally Rapp's knees began to
come around. It wasn't until the
last dual meet of the season last
year, though, that she was able to
swim the breaststroke com
petitively. Nonetheless, she fin
ished second at the NCAAs in the
200 breaststroke and this year
has regained her spot as
America's best in the event.
She has also assumed a leader
ship role as co-captain of a young
Stanford team. Rapp is the only
senior on the team, which is
looking to break Texas' string of
three straight NCAA titles.
"She's a great leader," Stanford

Though she swims in constant pain due to deterioration in both knees, Stanford's Susan Rapp is still the
team leader. She is also "the most underrated national swimmer in the country," according to Stanford
Coach George Haines.
Coach George Haines said of
Rapp. "She's able to get people
around her to do things. They
don't want to let her down. She
swims in pain every day. People
see that."
According to Rapp. "Our team is
really important to me this year.
[It's] the closest team I've ever been
on. That's the strength of our
team. To see this (togetherness)
continue to grow is a big con
cern."
In addition to being one of Stan
ford's big guns. Rapp is "the most
underrated national swimmer in
the country." according to Haines.
Rapp also played a part in the
recruitment of freshman phenom
enon Michelle Griglione. Both are
from Alexandria, Va.. and Grig

lione had met Rapp years ago
through Rapp's younger sister
Chris.
"I would have killed her If she
hadn't gone here," said Rapp, who
hosted Griglione on her visit and
called her several times.
Griglione credited Rapp with
playing "the greatest role of
anybody on the team besides
George" with her recruitment.
"Just the fact that knowing people
like Susan were on the team made
me want to come here."
Rapp was also drawn to Stan
ford by someone on the team.
"My sister Jenny was here as a
sophomore, and all she talked
about was Stanford this, Stanford
that."
Rapp came to the Farm as a
highly touted recruit having
already been a member of the
1980 Olympic team, but her
swimming career had started
rather inauspiciously.

An "army brat" — her father Is a
colonel In the Corps of Engineers
— Rapp competed In her first race
at West Point as a six-year-old and
"ended up hating swimming."
After moving to Alexandria,
Rapp decided to follow in her older
sister's wake and began swim
ming with the Starlit Aquatic
Club. She progressed rapidly and
made her first senior national
meet at the age of 14 and the
Olympic team the next year.
Some argue that breaststrokers
are born, not made, and Rapp ad
mitted, "I guess I am born for the
event."
According to Griglione, Rapp
has a "feel for the water."
"She has great rhythm," Haines
added.
The Cardinal will be looking for
Rapp to lead It to the champion
ship in the inaugural Pacific 10
Conference meet beginning to
morrow. She will also be counted

on to help wrest the NCAA cham
pionship from Texas In March
(she compiled the sixth-highest
point total with 52 at last year's
meet), but beyond that Rapp's fu
ture is undecided.
She has a year of eligibility
remaining from her redshirt
season and Is planning on going
co-term in human biology, but
those plans, as well as her Olym
pic hopes for 1988, are contingent
upon her knees staying relatively
pain-free.
Rapp said she already ices her
knees every day and is unable to
ride a bike. "1 kind of have said
that if my knees get bad enough to
take anti-inflammatory [medi
cine). I'll quit."
Haines, meanwhile, is hoping
Rapp will come back for her final
year.
"It would be nice to have about a
dozen Susan Rapps," he said.
"She's just a great girl."
Susan Rapp should have been
on top of the world after the 1984
Olympics. She had won a silver
medal In the 200-meter breast
stroke that summer and was re
turning to the Farm after helping
the Cardinal to a second-place
NCAA finish with an outstanding
freshman swimming season.
However, things weren't as rosy
as they seemed. After all the hype,
the Olympics had not met Rapp s
admittedly lofty expectations,
and, worse, her knees were both
ering her due to a painful
deterioration in their sinovial
linings.
"During the Olympics my knees
were pretty bad," said Rapp, who
is now a senior. "The Olympics
wasn't what I was expecting it to
be. I started thinking what's the
point of going fast if you get to the
meet and it's not as fun as you
want it to be.
"Major questions were coming
to my mind. It was really bother
ing me. I went back to school, and
they (the knees) just kept getting
worse."
A ray of hope appeared in No
vember in the form of arthro

scopic surgery on both knees,
Rapp said the inside of her knees
looked like "cotton candy," and
the surgeon could do little more
than remove the frayed bits of the
sinovial linings.
Still, Rapp's knees continued to
deteriorate. Despite rest and the
surgery, "I'd be sitting In class and
get shooting pains in my knees,"
she said.
While Rapp was undergoing the
physical trauma of her injuries,
she was also undergoing a mental
upheaval as a new influence
moved into her life. During fall
quarter she had begun accompa
nying some friends to Bible
studies and doing some Scripture
reading on her own.
"I'm a pretty cynical person,"
she said. "I was reading the Bible
a lot. I felt like a pretty good, moral
person, but there was something
pinching at me. I didn't see how
the pieces fit together."
She began reading the works of
Christian scholar C.S. Lewis, "His
book, 'Mere Christianity,' helped
me put the puzzle together," she
said. "I'd believe at night, and
then in the morning I'd go and
say, 'Forget it — no way.' " After
a week of soul-searching, Rapp

said, "God brought me to Him and
said. 'This is the meaning of life.'
(Now) Jesus is the most important
thing in my life. My relationship
pervades every aspect of my life."
Still, her knees failed to im
prove. and what would have been
her sophomore season turned into
a medical redshirt year.
"I would pray that God would
heal my knees, but they didn't get
better, and I couldn't figure out
why," Rapp said. "It was like,
'You've got to heal my knees, be
cause I have to swim.' I couldn't
give it up until fall quarter."
Finally Rapp's knees began to
come around. It wasn't until the
last dual meet of the season last
year, though, that she was able to
