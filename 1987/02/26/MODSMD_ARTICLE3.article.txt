# Tutors reach out to help children

This is the first in a three-part series of arti
cles describing the problems facing East Palo
Alto, and how Stanford volunteers are trying
to help.
In the corner of a classroom at the Marva
Collins Complex in East Palo Alto, a Stanford
student puts his arm around one of two boys
as the boy reads a column of words on a card.
"Do you have any homework?" the Stanford
student asks them.
One boy shows the tutor his homework. "It's
bad," he says.
"Why do you say it's bad?" the tutor
responds.
The Marva Collins Complex is just one
school where some of the most educationally
privileged students in the country meet regu
larly with So.ne of the least privileged students.
Currently about 150 Stanford students meet
weekly for an after-school tutorial lab with stu
dents at five schools in the Ravenswood school

district, located in East Palo Alto and eastern
Menlo Park.
And, despite minimal recruiting efforts, in
terest among Stanford students is growing, ac
cording to Magdelena Fittoria, coordinator of
Stanford Tutoring Programs.
Fittoria described the tutoring programs as
a "supporting activity" to the Ravenswood stu
dents' classes and said that the main purpose
of the programs is to "get kids excited, so that
they see that learning can be fun."
The tutoring focuses mainly on reading, Fit
toria said, but tutors also work on math and
measurement skills, mostly through games.
Fittoria said that tutors do not need special
training. "What we're asking students to do
doesn't take a lot. It takes understanding," she
said.
Perhaps the best thing the Stanford tutors
can offer the Ravenswood students is one-on
one attention, which few receive from either
teachers or parents, according to Fittoria.
Emily Hamamoto, a teacher at the Marva

Collins Complex, agreed. "Some don't even
need the tutoring but like the special atten
tion," attention which they need if they are
going to get into college, she said.
"It's amazing that they (the Ravenswood stu
dents) remember week to week," she added.
Indeed, among the grade school children,
the response to the tutoring is almost univer
sally enthusiastic. And according to Fittoria,
Ravenswood students have come back for
tutoring even after getting out of school early
or not going to school at ail.
This enthusiasm for tutoring exists despite
serious problems that continue to plague the
schools of East Palo Alto. The schools face fin
ancial difficulties, high faculty turnover, test
scores in the lowest percentiles of statewide
skills tests and a high school dropout rate of
75 percent.
Fittoria said she sees the educational prob
lems of the East Palo Alto area as historical.
