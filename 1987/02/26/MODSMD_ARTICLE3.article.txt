# Tutors reach out to help children
## 
### JULIE WIDMAN 
This is the first in a three-part series of arti
cles describing the problems facing East Palo
Alto, and how Stanford volunteers are trying
to help.
In the corner of a classroom at the Marva
Collins Complex in East Palo Alto, a Stanford
student puts his arm around one of two boys
as the boy reads a column of words on a card.
"Do you have any homework?" the Stanford
student asks them.
One boy shows the tutor his homework. "It's
bad," he says.
"Why do you say it's bad?" the tutor
responds.
The Marva Collins Complex is just one
school where some of the most educationally
privileged students in the country meet regu
larly with So.ne of the least privileged students.
Currently about 150 Stanford students meet
weekly for an after-school tutorial lab with stu
dents at five schools in the Ravenswood school

district, located in East Palo Alto and eastern
Menlo Park.
And, despite minimal recruiting efforts, in
terest among Stanford students is growing, ac
cording to Magdelena Fittoria, coordinator of
Stanford Tutoring Programs.
Fittoria described the tutoring programs as
a "supporting activity" to the Ravenswood stu
dents' classes and said that the main purpose
of the programs is to "get kids excited, so that
they see that learning can be fun."
The tutoring focuses mainly on reading, Fit
toria said, but tutors also work on math and
measurement skills, mostly through games.
Fittoria said that tutors do not need special
training. "What we're asking students to do
doesn't take a lot. It takes understanding," she
said.
Perhaps the best thing the Stanford tutors
can offer the Ravenswood students is one-on
one attention, which few receive from either
teachers or parents, according to Fittoria.
Emily Hamamoto, a teacher at the Marva

Collins Complex, agreed. "Some don't even
need the tutoring but like the special atten
tion," attention which they need if they are
going to get into college, she said.
"It's amazing that they (the Ravenswood stu
dents) remember week to week," she added.
Indeed, among the grade school children,
the response to the tutoring is almost univer
sally enthusiastic. And according to Fittoria,
Ravenswood students have come back for
tutoring even after getting out of school early
or not going to school at ail.
This enthusiasm for tutoring exists despite
serious problems that continue to plague the
schools of East Palo Alto. The schools face fin
ancial difficulties, high faculty turnover, test
scores in the lowest percentiles of statewide
skills tests and a high school dropout rate of
75 percent.
Fittoria said she sees the educational prob
lems of the East Palo Alto area as historical.
"School board members haven't
been people who hold kids as a
priority. Teachers didn't care
either," she stated.
She also said that the problems
of the Ravenswood school district
are not uncommon for minority
communities.
"In the U.S. we talk a lot about
equality of opportunity in educa
tion, but we haven't done enough.
Minority communities really don't
get a fair deal; they become more
and more segregated," she said.
"In 1987, (many people) still
believe minorities are inferior in
their learning capability. Re
search shows that teachers have
lower expectations of minority
kids," she added.
But Fittoria said she believes
things are changing for Ra
venswood. "In the last few years,
the community finally said
'stop.' " she said. Among other
changes, a standard curriculum
was Introduced and a literature
series through the classrooms was
started.
The current superintendent,
Charlie Mae Knight, has also
rallied community support, ac
cording to Fittoria. Knight, who
began her term in 1985, was the
tenth superintendent in 10 years.
Fittoria addded that she feels it
is important for Stanford stu
dents to know that "there are
people who care and who are
trying to improve the schools. I
don't want students to think that
they're helping because the teach
ers can't help."

It is important for the tutoring
programs to grow slowly and to try
to meet the needs of the Ra
venswood schools "as they define
them," said Fittoria.
In the past. Stanford students
had not always been successful
tutors. They would start research
projects that they wouldn't finish,
and their first priorities were
themselves, according to Fittoria.
Continuity was also impossible to
establish because the students
running the programs would grad
uate.
But the Public Service Center
(PSC) decided this year to hire a
staff member to supervise the
various tutoring programs, from
Barrio Assistance for Hispanic
children to the Garden Oaks bas
ketball program, which combines
tutoring with athletics.
PSC officials hired Fittoria, a
Stanford graduate with degrees in
anthropology and education. Fit
toria has also had an extensive
background in public service, in
cluding work at a battered
women's shelter and the Palo Alto
Ecumenical Hunger Project.
Fittoria stresses that her re
sponsibility is to the Ravenswood
schools as well as to Stanford. She
helps train the tutors and
matches up tutors with tutees.
A definite improvement has oc
curred in Stanford's efforts to help
the Ravenswood schools, accord
ing to Fittoria. "Before, here was
Stanford â€” one of the highest in
stitutions of higher learning, and
just down the road were kids with
some of the lowest test scores."
The Stanford students involved
in tutoring do it for several
reasons. "Some are interested in

education, and some think it is
easy and fun to work with kids,
Fittoria said.
"Students who do it have
weighed out their priorities," she
said. "Being at Stanford means
being a very lucky person educa
tionally. There is a sense of giving
back."
Anne Maloney. a senior and stu
dent coordinator of the Marva Col
lins Complex program, said that
her interest in education mo
tivated her to become involved in
tutoring.
"I'm having to deal with people
from an entirely different back
ground, and somehow we're com
ing together to enjoy learning to
gether. Activities that they get
excited about are what I love the
most," she said.
The tutoring "has given me a
good chance to see firsthand a
school in a depressed school dis
trict," said Doris Patton, a senior
who is tutoring at Castano
Elementary School.
"I'm encouraged by their inter
est," said Patton. She mentioned
in particular the boy she tutors
who says "I'm cool" whenever he
gets an answer right.
The program is not without
problems, however, as both Pat
ton and Maloney admit. Most
tutors have to work simultane
ously with two children who are
often not at the same level, and
time is limited.
"It is difficult to preserve the
fine line between 'play time' and
real learning," Maloney said.
"To a lot of people (tutoring) is
frustrating. You can't necessarily
see the difference. You have to be
satisfied that the extra attention

is helping them," Patton said.
Fittoria cautioned against un
realistic expectations. "Tutors are
only tutors. The most important
thing is a change of pace," she
said.
But some do see a difference.
"Each week, you see definite,
subtle changes from the way they
(the students) greet you to in
creased confidence in reading in
front of you," Maloney asserted.
Meanwhile, Fittoria has plans to
expand the tutoring programs to
all six Ravenswood schools,

One boy shows the tutor his homework. "It's
bad," he says.
"Why do you say it's bad?" the tutor
responds.
The Marva Collins Complex is just one
school where some of the most educationally
privileged students in the country meet regu
larly with So.ne of the least privileged students.
Currently about 150 Stanford students meet
weekly for an after-school tutorial lab with stu
dents at five schools in the Ravenswood school

district, located in East Palo Alto and eastern
Menlo Park.
And, despite minimal recruiting efforts, in
terest among Stanford students is growing, ac
cording to Magdelena Fittoria, coordinator of
Stanford Tutoring Programs.
Fittoria described the tutoring programs as
a "supporting activity" to the Ravenswood stu
dents' classes and said that the main purpose
of the programs is to "get kids excited, so that
they see that learning can be fun."
The tutoring focuses mainly on reading, Fit
toria said, but tutors also work on math and
measurement skills, mostly through games.
Fittoria said that tutors do not need special
training. "What we're asking students to do
doesn't take a lot. It takes understanding," she
said.
Perhaps the best thing the Stanford tutors
can offer the Ravenswood students is one-on
one attention, which few receive from either
teachers or parents, according to Fittoria.
Emily Hamamoto, a teacher at the Marva

Collins Complex, agreed. "Some don't even
need the tutoring but like the special atten
tion," attention which they need if they are
going to get into college, she said.
"It's amazing that they (the Ravenswood stu
dents) remember week to week," she added.
Indeed, among the grade school children,
the response to the tutoring is almost univer
sally enthusiastic. And according to Fittoria,
Ravenswood students have come back for
tutoring even after getting out of school early
or not going to school at ail.
This enthusiasm for tutoring exists despite
serious problems that continue to plague the
schools of East Palo Alto. The schools face fin
ancial difficulties, high faculty turnover, test
scores in the lowest percentiles of statewide
skills tests and a high school dropout rate of
75 percent.
Fittoria said she sees the educational prob
lems of the East Palo Alto area as historical.
"School board members haven't
been people who hold kids as a
priority. Teachers didn't care
either," she stated.
She also said that the problems
of the Ravenswood school district
are not uncommon for minority
communities.
"In the U.S. we talk a lot about
equality of opportunity in educa
tion, but we haven't done enough.
Minority communities really don't
get a fair deal; they become more
and more segregated," she said.
"In 1987, (many people) still
believe minorities are inferior in
their learning capability. Re
search shows that teachers have
lower expectations of minority
kids," she added.
But Fittoria said she believes
things are changing for Ra
venswood. "In the last few years,
the community finally said
'stop.' " she said. Among other
changes, a standard curriculum
was Introduced and a literature
series through the classrooms was
started.
The current superintendent,
Charlie Mae Knight, has also
rallied community support, ac
cording to Fittoria. Knight, who
began her term in 1985, was the
tenth superintendent in 10 years.
Fittoria addded that she feels it
is important for Stanford stu
dents to know that "there are
people who care and who are
trying to improve the schools. I
don't want students to think that
they're helping because the teach
ers can't help."

It is important for the tutoring
programs to grow slowly and to try
to meet the needs of the Ra
venswood schools "as they define
them," said Fittoria.
In the past. Stanford students
had not always been successful
tutors. They would start research
projects that they wouldn't finish,
and their first priorities were
themselves, according to Fittoria.
Continuity was also impossible to
establish because the students
running the programs would grad
uate.
But the Public Service Center
(PSC) decided this year to hire a
staff member to supervise the
various tutoring programs, from
Barrio Assistance for Hispanic
children to the Garden Oaks bas
ketball program, which combines
tutoring with athletics.
PSC officials hired Fittoria, a
Stanford graduate with degrees in
anthropology and education. Fit
toria has also had an extensive
background in public service, in
cluding work at a battered
women's shelter and the Palo Alto
Ecumenical Hunger Project.
Fittoria stresses that her re
sponsibility is to the Ravenswood
schools as well as to Stanford. She
helps train the tutors and
matches up tutors with tutees.
A definite improvement has oc
curred in Stanford's efforts to help
the Ravenswood schools, accord
ing to Fittoria. "Before, here was
Stanford â€” one of the highest in
stitutions of higher learning, and
just down the road were kids with
some of the lowest test scores."
The Stanford students involved
in tutoring do it for several
reasons. "Some are interested in

education, and some think it is
easy and fun to work with kids,
Fittoria said.
"Students who do it have
weighed out their priorities," she
said. "Being at Stanford means
being a very lucky person educa
tionally. There is a sense of giving
back."
Anne Maloney. a senior and stu
dent coordinator of the Marva Col
lins Complex program, said that
her interest in education mo
tivated her to become involved in
tutoring.
"I'm having to deal with people
from an entirely different back
ground, and somehow we're com
ing together to enjoy learning to
gether. Activities that they get
excited about are what I love the
most," she said.
The tutoring "has given me a
good chance to see firsthand a
school in a depressed school dis
trict," said Doris Patton, a senior
who is tutoring at Castano
Elementary School.
"I'm encouraged by their inter
est," said Patton. She mentioned
in particular the boy she tutors
who says "I'm cool" whenever he
gets an answer right.
The program is not without
problems, however, as both Pat
ton and Maloney admit. Most
tutors have to work simultane
ously with two children who are
often not at the same level, and
time is limited.
"It is difficult to preserve the
fine line between 'play time' and
real learning," Maloney said.
"To a lot of people (tutoring) is
frustrating. You can't necessarily
see the difference. You have to be
satisfied that the extra attention

is helping them," Patton said.
Fittoria cautioned against un
realistic expectations. "Tutors are
only tutors. The most important
thing is a change of pace," she
said.
But some do see a difference.
"Each week, you see definite,
subtle changes from the way they
(the students) greet you to in
creased confidence in reading in
front of you," Maloney asserted.
Meanwhile, Fittoria has plans to
expand the tutoring programs to
all six Ravenswood schools,
