# Court decides on arbitration
## 
### LORI SILVER Staff writer 
Both the University and the
United Stanford Workers (USW)
have claimed victory in a federal
district court ruling that stated
that a dispute between the Univer
sity Administration and the USW
must be immediately arbitrated.
The conflict arose from the Uni
versity's insistence that griev
ances from 1984 be arbitrated
before grievances from 1985, ac
cording to USW Staff Counsel
Mary Ann Tenuto.
The USW filed suit in August to
force immediate arbitration of
that conflict. The court initially
ruled on the case in January, but
a federal judge clarified the ruling
earlier this week.
"When we completed negotia
tion of our last contract in Novem
ber 1985, a whole new group of
grievances started to be filed. We
were surprised when the Univer
sity refused to arbitrate the new
grievances in the order filed under
the new contract," Tenuto said.
Tenuto said that the University
informed the USW by letter that
grievances filed in 1984 under the
old contract had to be arbitrated

before grievances filed under the
new 1985 contract.
"The 1984 grievances deal with
minor discipline problems," said
USW attorney Jim Eggleston, add
ing that termination grievances
are dealt with immediately. "We
want to get on with important
1985 grievances."
The University is in favor of ar
bitrating the dispute, said Staff
Counsel Priscilla Wheeler.
"We said that we wouldn't put
this issue before all other things.
If we were in disagreement with
the arbitration dispute we could
have gone further in court. We
thought this issue shouldn't have
gone to court at all," she said.
Wheeler said she was puzzled as
to why the USW would charac
terize the court's ruling as a vic
tory. "The court said exactly what
we wanted it to say," she said.
The USW has delayed its suit by
adding another level of arbitra
tion, Wheeler said.
However. USW leaders disputed
Wheeler's statements.
"The bottom-line fact is that the
union wanted to obtain immedi
ate arbitration of this dispute,
and it did," said Eggleston.
He said that the University
opposed arbitration of the dispute
and would have scheduled the ar
bitration to occur after the cur
rent contract expires in 1988.
