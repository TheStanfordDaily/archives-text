## Speaks during celebration of Filipino independence 
### JOHN POLLACK Senior staff writer 
"I have been greatly inspired by the Filipino
people's courageous struggle for justice,
democracy and human rights," said Coretta Scott
King at a celebration of Philippines Freedom Day
last night in Memorial Church.
King, widow of slain civil rights leader Martin
Luther King Jr.. was here to receive an award
from the Ninoy Aquino Movement (NAM), a group
that helped lead the non-violent revolution that
ousted former Philippines President Ferdinand
Marcos.
Yesterday marked the first anniversary of
Marcos' flight from the Philippines and the as
sumption of power by the current president,
Corazon "Cory'' Aquino.
King said that the Filipinos' non-violent over
throw of Marcos reaffirmed the viability of non
violence as a method for bringing about real politi
cal and social change.
The Filipinos' "People Power" revolution was
"the third major victory for non-violence," King

said, noting that India's struggle for indepen
dence and the U.S. civil rights movement in the
1960s were the first two.
"There is a better way to fight dictators than by
adopting the violence of the oppressor," she said.
King drew a parallel between the non-violent
revolution in the Philippines and the U.S. civil
rights movement of the 19605; both had martyrs.
In the Philippines, it was opposition leader
Benigno "Ninoy" Aquino, and in the United
States, it was Martin Luther King Jr.
Ninoy Aquino was assassinated on Aug. 23,
1983 — allegedly by Marcos agents — as he
returned from self-imposed exile in the United
States. The Ninoy Aquino Movement bears his
name. After his assassination, his wife Corazon
assumed leadership of the opposition movement
and was later elected president.
Referring to the assassinations. King said. "You
can slay the dreamer, but you can't slay the
dream."
King praised Aquino, the recipient of the 1986
