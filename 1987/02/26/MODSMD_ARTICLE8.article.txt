Three groups supplied contras
WASHINGTON — Three distinct and competing groups
supplied millions of dollars in weapons to the Nicaraguan contras
after Congress banned the U.S. government in October 1984 from
providing arms directly, according to documents, contra officials
and brokers involved in the transactions.
Two of the groups providing arms had direct ties to Lt. Col.
Oliver North, the National Security Council staff aide fired Nov. 25
for his role in the Iran-contra affair. One rebel source described
North's intervention as critical in making certain that the weap
ons reached the contras after they were shipped from Europe.
Retired Army Maj. Gen. John Singlaub was the principal figure
in one of the three channels through which arms flowed to the
contras. While he was publicly raising money to clothe and feed
the contras, he was trying to arrange arms shipments to them be
hind the scenes. In an interview. Singlaub said he completed one
•5 million shipment in 1985 — which has not been previously dis
closed — before he was shoved aside by a competing group that
portrayed itself as having an inside track with the contras.
A second channel included retired Air Force Maj. Gen. Richard
Secord, who has been identified by Senate investigators as one of
North's key lieutenants in keeping the contras alive during the
congressional ban and in facilitating the arms shipments to Iran.
Singlaub said he talked with Secord about their efforts to arm the
contras. and they even compared prices.
The third group providing arms — the group that Singlaub said
outmaneuvered him — was headed by Ronald Martin, a Miami
arms broker whose long involvement in supplying arms to Central
American countries is documented in court records. Martin's
group had its own contacts in the Reagan administration that
helped it establish a foothold in Honduras, where the contras
received their weapons, according to two knowledgeable sources.
Washington defeats Byrne
CHICAGO — Black incumbent Mayor Harold Washington crept
to a narrow victory over white challenger Jane Byrne Tuesday in a
racially divisive Democratic primary battle marred by massive
confusion at the polls and a landslide of fraud charges.
Only minutes before midnight, Byrne spoke to disappointed fol
lowers at her campaign headquarters and conceded defeat. "The
people have spoken; we didn't make it," she said.
Voters went to the polls in near-record numbers in unusually
"warm" 30- and 40-degree temperatures. Shortly after the polling
places closed, all three network-owned television stations in
Chicago said their surveys of voters leaving the polling places indi
cated Washington would win the nomination.
With 90 percent of the vote counted, Washington was pulling
away, leading Byrne by a 52 percent to 48 percent margin. At that
point, precincts remaining to be counted were largely from his
strongholds.
Prospects good for Afghan peace
GENEVA — Prospects for a settlement in Afghanistan appeared
to have improved yesterday as the Afghan and Pakistani foreign
ministers both proposed new timetables for withdrawing Soviet
troops. .4
The proposals were put forth as peace talks were resumed under
U.N. mediator Diego Cordovez.
Afghanistan has been caught up in civil war for the past seven
years. Soviet troops, now estimated to number 115,000, are fight
ing alongside troops loyal to the Communist government. Pakis
tan is involved because millions of Afghans have fled across the
border to refugee camps in Pakistan.
Cordovez told reporters yesterday that "there is only one blank
space" in a four-part document that has been agreed to in every
respect except how long the Soviets will take to withdraw their
troops.
Britain reassured on Star Wars
LONDON — On the first stop of a six-nation trip to consult with
European allies, two U.S. arms control experts told Prime Minister
Margaret Thatcher Wednesday that the Reagan administration is
not considering early deployment of a space defense system.
British officials said that Paul Nitze, the State Department's
senior arms control adviser, and Assistant Secretary of Defense
Richard Perle reaffirmed an administration position taken two
years a£o that no space defense system would be deployed until
after negotiations with the Soviet Union.
However, in an apparent attempt to avoid possible discord.
British officials declined to comment on a move under review by
the Reagan administration to broaden the traditional interpreta
tion of the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile treaty in a way that would
permit testing of space defense components.
B-ls plagued by problems
WASHINGTON — Government investigators said Wednesday
that as many as half of the new B-l bombers at a Texas air base
have been grounded in recent weeks because of nagging technical
problems and that the aircraft's shortcomings may persist well
into the next decade, contrary to public statements by the Air
Force.
During hearings before subcommittees of the House Armed
Services Committee, Chairman Les Aspin. D-Wis., said the
bomber's heart — its defensive electronics system — not only fails
to jam enemy radar signals but actually serves as a beacon illumi
nating the B-l as a target.
General Accounting Office officials, who have been investigat
ing the aircraft for six months, testified that the problems with
the *28.3 billion bomber program, especially the critical defensive
electronic countermeasures (ECM), are far more serious than Air
Force officials have acknowledged. GAO officials also predicted
that the Air Force will have to ask Congress for substantially more
money in coming years to repair and upgrade the bomber.
Deng: Follow Polish example
PEKING — Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping has advised Commu
nist Party officials that China should shun American-style
democracy and follow Poland's example in suppressing its politi
cal opposition, according to a ranking party official and party doc
uments.
Confidential documents also reveal that Deng has advised other
Chinese leaders not to worry about foreigners who say that China
is damaging its external image by cracking down on intellectual
dissent.
A ranking Communist Party cadre this week read three key
party documents in their entirety to three reporters from the
United States. France and Japan.
Such documents, or directives, are supposed to provide guid
ance from the party's leadership to its cadres.
The aim of these documents, the first three issued In 1987, is to
advise cadres on how they should view recent student demonstra
tions in several Chinese cities and the ouster of Communist Pat ty
chief Hu Yaobang in the wake of those demonstrations. The docu
ments also explain how cadres should conduct the current battle
against Western political ideas, or "bourgeois liberalism."

The third group providing arms — the group that Singlaub said
outmaneuvered him — was headed by Ronald Martin, a Miami
arms broker whose long involvement in supplying arms to Central
American countries is documented in court records. Martin's
group had its own contacts in the Reagan administration that
helped it establish a foothold in Honduras, where the contras
received their weapons, according to two knowledgeable sources.
Washington defeats Byrne
CHICAGO — Black incumbent Mayor Harold Washington crept
to a narrow victory over white challenger Jane Byrne Tuesday in a
racially divisive Democratic primary battle marred by massive
confusion at the polls and a landslide of fraud charges.
Only minutes before midnight, Byrne spoke to disappointed fol
lowers at her campaign headquarters and conceded defeat. "The
people have spoken; we didn't make it," she said.
Voters went to the polls in near-record numbers in unusually
"warm" 30- and 40-degree temperatures. Shortly after the polling
places closed, all three network-owned television stations in
Chicago said their surveys of voters leaving the polling places indi
cated Washington would win the nomination.
With 90 percent of the vote counted, Washington was pulling
away, leading Byrne by a 52 percent to 48 percent margin. At that
point, precincts remaining to be counted were largely from his
strongholds.
Prospects good for Afghan peace
GENEVA — Prospects for a settlement in Afghanistan appeared
to have improved yesterday as the Afghan and Pakistani foreign
ministers both proposed new timetables for withdrawing Soviet
troops. .4
The proposals were put forth as peace talks were resumed under
U.N. mediator Diego Cordovez.
Afghanistan has been caught up in civil war for the past seven
years. Soviet troops, now estimated to number 115,000, are fight
ing alongside troops loyal to the Communist government. Pakis
tan is involved because millions of Afghans have fled across the
border to refugee camps in Pakistan.
Cordovez told reporters yesterday that "there is only one blank
space" in a four-part document that has been agreed to in every
respect except how long the Soviets will take to withdraw their
troops.
Britain reassured on Star Wars
LONDON — On the first stop of a six-nation trip to consult with
European allies, two U.S. arms control experts told Prime Minister
Margaret Thatcher Wednesday that the Reagan administration is
not considering early deployment of a space defense system.
British officials said that Paul Nitze, the State Department's
senior arms control adviser, and Assistant Secretary of Defense
Richard Perle reaffirmed an administration position taken two
years a£o that no space defense system would be deployed until
after negotiations with the Soviet Union.
However, in an apparent attempt to avoid possible discord.
British officials declined to comment on a move under review by
the Reagan administration to broaden the traditional interpreta
tion of the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile treaty in a way that would
permit testing of space defense components.
B-ls plagued by problems
WASHINGTON — Government investigators said Wednesday
that as many as half of the new B-l bombers at a Texas air base
have been grounded in recent weeks because of nagging technical
problems and that the aircraft's shortcomings may persist well
into the next decade, contrary to public statements by the Air
Force.
During hearings before subcommittees of the House Armed
Services Committee, Chairman Les Aspin. D-Wis., said the
bomber's heart — its defensive electronics system — not only fails
to jam enemy radar signals but actually serves as a beacon illumi
nating the B-l as a target.
General Accounting Office officials, who have been investigat
ing the aircraft for six months, testified that the problems with
the *28.3 billion bomber program, especially the critical defensive
electronic countermeasures (ECM), are far more serious than Air
Force officials have acknowledged. GAO officials also predicted
that the Air Force will have to ask Congress for substantially more
money in coming years to repair and upgrade the bomber.
Deng: Follow Polish example
PEKING — Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping has advised Commu
nist Party officials that China should shun American-style
democracy and follow Poland's example in suppressing its politi
cal opposition, according to a ranking party official and party doc
uments.
Confidential documents also reveal that Deng has advised other
Chinese leaders not to worry about foreigners who say that China
is damaging its external image by cracking down on intellectual
dissent.
A ranking Communist Party cadre this week read three key
party documents in their entirety to three reporters from the
United States. France and Japan.
Such documents, or directives, are supposed to provide guid
ance from the party's leadership to its cadres.
The aim of these documents, the first three issued In 1987, is to
advise cadres on how they should view recent student demonstra
tions in several Chinese cities and the ouster of Communist Pat ty
chief Hu Yaobang in the wake of those demonstrations. The docu
ments also explain how cadres should conduct the current battle
against Western political ideas, or "bourgeois liberalism."

Three groups supplied contras
WASHINGTON — Three distinct and competing groups
supplied millions of dollars in weapons to the Nicaraguan contras
after Congress banned the U.S. government in October 1984 from
providing arms directly, according to documents, contra officials
and brokers involved in the transactions.
Two of the groups providing arms had direct ties to Lt. Col.
Oliver North, the National Security Council staff aide fired Nov. 25
for his role in the Iran-contra affair. One rebel source described
North's intervention as critical in making certain that the weap
ons reached the contras after they were shipped from Europe.
Retired Army Maj. Gen. John Singlaub was the principal figure
in one of the three channels through which arms flowed to the
contras. While he was publicly raising money to clothe and feed
the contras, he was trying to arrange arms shipments to them be
hind the scenes. In an interview. Singlaub said he completed one
•5 million shipment in 1985 — which has not been previously dis
closed — before he was shoved aside by a competing group that
portrayed itself as having an inside track with the contras.
A second channel included retired Air Force Maj. Gen. Richard
Secord, who has been identified by Senate investigators as one of
North's key lieutenants in keeping the contras alive during the
congressional ban and in facilitating the arms shipments to Iran.
Singlaub said he talked with Secord about their efforts to arm the
contras. and they even compared prices.
The third group providing arms — the group that Singlaub said
outmaneuvered him — was headed by Ronald Martin, a Miami
arms broker whose long involvement in supplying arms to Central
American countries is documented in court records. Martin's
group had its own contacts in the Reagan administration that
helped it establish a foothold in Honduras, where the contras
