# Court supports affirmative action

### 
WASHINGTON - The Supreme
Court, rejecting efforts by the
Reagan administration to limit af
firmative action programs, ruled
for the first time yesterday that
judges may order strict racial
promotion quotas to overcome
"long-term, open and pervasive
discrimination."
The 5-to-4 ruling, with Justice
William Brennan Jr. writing the
main opinion, upheld a judge's
temporary order in 1983 that re
quired Alabama to promote one
black state trooper for every white
promoted. The order followed a
finding that, 12 years after a judge
ordered the state police dese
gregated, only four of 200 officers
were black and none of the blacks
was above the rank of corporal.
The decision, the third in the
past two years to uphold racial
quotas, underscored the Reagan
administration's failure after six
years to make significant headway
in winning Supreme Court sup

port for its civil rights arguments.
The administration had called
the quota "excessive" and
"profoundly Illegal," maintaining
that any promotion quotas must
be "narrowly tailored" to reflect
the percentage of blacks applying
for state police jobs. In Alabama's
case, that would be about one
black for every three whites.
But Brennan, joined by three
justices, disagreed, sanctioning
the use of the "speed-up" promo
tion plan. "The one-for-one re
quirement," Brennan said, was
imposed after the judge "properly
determined that strong measures
were required in light of the
(state's) long and shameful record
of delay and resistance." Brennan
emphasized that the strict quota
was used only once and sus
pended as soon as the state imple
mented a non-discriminatory
hiring plan.
The administration also had
argued that the one-for-one quota
"unnecessarily and severely bur

dens innocent" white troopers.
Brennan replied that "because the
one-for-one requirement is so lim
ited in scope and duration, it only
postpones the promotions of
qualified whites."
"Denial of a future employment
opportunity is not as intrusive as
loss of an existing job, Brennan
said, adding that the quota In this
case did not "disproportionately
harm the interests, or unneces
sarily trammel the rights, of inno
cent individuals."
Justices Thurgood Marshall,
Harry Blackmun and Lewis Powell
Jr., joined Brennan's opinion.
Justice John Paul Stevens agreed
that the quota should be upheld
but disagreed with the majority's
reasons. Justice Sandra Day
O'Connor, Chief Justice William
Rehnquist and Justices Antonin
Scalia and Byron White dissented.
O'Connor said there was "no
evidence in the record that such
an extreme quota was necessary."
The Court generally has ap

proved affirmative action at the
hiring level, whether voluntary or
court-ordered. At the same time it
has virtually ruled out any plan
that might result in layoffs of
white workers, saying that would
unduly harm innocent people.
Last term, the Court in one case
approved a consent agreement
calling for numerical hiring and
promotional goals and, in another
case, said a judge could order a
union to hire a certain number of
minorities to meet a specific
hiring quota.
Yesterday's ruling was the first
time the justices have said Judges
could force employers to use a
strict numerical quota in promo
tions.
The ruling resolves longstand
ing questions over the general
power of judges to order affirma
tive action once an employer has
been found guilty of discrimina
tion.
