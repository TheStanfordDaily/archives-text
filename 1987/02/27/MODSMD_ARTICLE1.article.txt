# Stanford will send students to USSR
## 
### DIANE BISGEIER Senior staff writer 
Stanford and nine other Ameri
can univeristies next year will
send approximately 15 students
each to the Soviet Union for a two
week visit as part of a U.S./Soviet
student exchange program, ac
cording to Dennis Matthies, Otero
resident fellow and the organizer
of the the student steering com
mittee that will plan and raise
funds for the exchange.
The exchange program will be
facilitated by the Citizen's Ex
change Council (CEC), a non
profit private organization that
helps American groups visit the
Soviet Union.
Stanford students who go to
Russia will be diverse in "gender
and ethnicity" and will come from
various residences, Matthies said.
He added that Stanford stu
dents will not be required to speak
Russian, but the Soviets have re
quested that one-fourth have
some knowledge of the language
to facilitate travel.
It is still undetermined what So
viet university Stanford will be
paired with. "The Soviets seem to
be interested in pairing us with
Novosibirsk (in Siberia). Stanford
faculty members are probably
more interested in Leningrad,"
Matthies said. He added that the
Soviets will ultimately make the
decision and they may or may not
take Stanford's preferences into
account.
The group will have to pay at
least part of the cost of the pro
gram, Matthies said, although the
Soviets will pay all expenses
within the Soviet Union.
Matthies said he expects ap
proximately 15 Soviet students to
come to Stanford, although the
exact number has not been set.
The activities of the Stanford
students in the Soviet Union will
be determined by their Soviet
hosts. Matthies said. He added
that a large part of the time of So
viet students at Stanford will
probably be spent discussing
politics, student life and culture
with Stanford students. Some of
the time will be used to travel.
According to Matthies, Soviet
students visiting Stanford will
most likely stay in the proposed
Russian and Eastern European
theme house.
Matthies said the acceptance of
so many American students is
"definitely part of a new opening
on the part of the Soviet Union. Its

only within the last week they've
decided that for next year they
want 10 universities and 150 stu
dents," he said.
Yale and Williams have also
been selected to participate in the
exchange program. The seven
other schools have yet to be selec
ted.
Matthies attributed the choice
of Stanford, at least in part, to its
location. "Stanford is a very good
school and is also a West Coast
school. It is a nationwide, and not
just a New England, exchange," he
said.
Yale students who participated
in a more limited program last
year took a course the fall before
their departure giving them an
overview of the Soviet Union. "The
course consisted of small semi
nars, lectures and films,"
Matthies said.
He said Stanford participants
will take a similar course before
they visit the Soviet Union.
A meeting for interested stu
dents was held last Friday and
Matthies estimated the turnout at
150 to 175 students. "It's impor
tant that we have all grades
represented," he said. "One of
Yale's problems last year was that
it was very heavy in upper class
men."
Matthies said that applications
for positions on the steering com
mittee are due next Friday and
can be turned in to the Wilbur Hall
office.
Matthies added that he would
like to have the decision as to
what students will participate
made by the spring. A committee
of faculty and staff members will
be set up to make the final choices
of participants.
