### MAURICE LEE 
President John F. Kennedy's
handling of the 1962 Cuban
missile crisis took the world to the
brink of nuclear holocaust. His
tory Prof. Barton Bernstein said
last night.
Bernstein and Political Science
Prof. Alexander George, in a
debate at Branner Hall, analyzed
the prudence of Kennedy's hand
ling of the crisis with the aim of
"making live what is usually only
read on paper." Bernstein said.
A main point of conflict
throughout the debate centered
on Kennedy's decision to deal with
the crisis publicly, foregoing any
private negotiations. Bernstein
maintained that Kennedy acted
rashly by forcing Soviet leader
Nikita Khrushchev into a choice
between "humiliation or escala
tion," and that Kennedy was lucky
in ending the crisis peacefully.
George disagreed and said the
necessity for quick action warran
ted going public and that Kennedy
"acted with restraint" by choosing
only to quarantine Cuba and not
call for an air strike or immediate
invasion, as many of his advisers
recommended.
This led to a discussion of Ken
nedy's personality and its effect on
his decision-making. Bernstein

portrayed Kennedy as an aggres
sive man who "liked conflict,
wanted triumph . . . and took
(politics] personally."
George rejected this portrayal of
the president saying that, "any
machismo that [Kennedy] had was
used up in bed." and that Ken
nedy's seeminly rash choice was

actually a safer course.
A final point of disagreement
was the actual military threat of
the 42 medium range ballistic
missiles in Cuba — only two
minutes away from U.S. targets.
Bernstein said the 42 missiles,
added to 40 missiles in the USSR,
posed little risk to the United
States because the United States

had over 170 missiles at home and
over 100 in Europe.
George said the USSR could
have continued to ship missiles
into Cuba and that the two
minute warning time from Cuba
was a significant difference from
the 15-minute warning time of
missiles launched from the Soviet
Union.
