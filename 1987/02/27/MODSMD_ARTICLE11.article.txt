In less than two decades, Stanford has
rocketed from provincial obscurity into the
top ranks of American higher education. To
a large extent, the driving force behind this
transformation has been the University's
remarkable success in the sciences.
Stanford's non-technical departments, al
though excellent by nearly any standard,
clearly play second fiddle to scientific re
search, particularily in the hard sciences.
University Vice Provost for Academic Plan
ning William Chace admits that "we have not
gained equivalent stature in the humanities
as we have in some of the sciences."
If Stanford is to maintain its place as one
of the best universities in the nation, it must
take decisive steps to insure that its
humanities and social sciences do not
become overshadowed by its growing techni
cal prominence.
Predictably, as Stanford's scientific stature
has grown, its student population has also
become markedly more science-oriented.
In 1969, 13.9 percent of undergraduates
chose engineering as a major. Last year, en
gineering accounted for a whopping 21.4
percent of all undergraduate majors, and
somewhat more than half of all graduating

seniors majored in scientific fields. Noting
that "science and engineering are more
central here than at many of the Eastern
schools," Dean of Undergraduate Studies
Carolyn Lougee points out that Stanford "is a
hard place — in some ways — to be a
humanist."
Over the next five years, Stanford's Cen
tennial campaign expects to collect $1.1 bil
lion in donations, the largest sum ever collec
ted by any University fund-raising effort.
This unprecedented financial boon offers
University leaders a golden opportunity to
address Stanford's lingering academic im
balance.
As allocation plans for the Centennial
funds stand now, the sciences are slated to
get a lion's share of this incoming gift
money. In particular, the large-scale over
haul of scientific buildings and facilities in
the Near West campus has been designated a
major target of Centennial money.
Perhaps a larger proportion of these gift
funds ought to be devoted to the humanities
and social sciences. Although technical re
search necessarily tends to cost more than
research in the humanities, it is in this area,
not the already flourishing sciences, that an
extra boost is most needed.
