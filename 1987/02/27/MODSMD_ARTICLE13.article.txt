# Recent events ignore gays
## 
### 
In recent weeks, a series of public events on
campus has entirely ignored both the exis
tence of lesbian and gay people and the oppres
sion that colors and embattles our lives. These
events include:
□ The Rev. Jessie Jackson's speech and the
program that proceeded it;
□ The "Families in Transition" conference;
□ The University's decision to allow "legal dis
crimination" on the basis of sexual orienta
tion.
We do not ascribe malicious intent to any of
the individuals or institutions mentioned in
this letter, but beyond a certain point ignor
ance becomes not merely irresponsible and in
sensitive, but willful. We feel these examples
are well beyond that point.

GLAS, ET AL.

Many lesbian women and gay men attended
Jackson's speech in honor of Martin Luther
King Jr. The image of a rainbow coalition has
tremendous appeal to us — regardless of our
personal political convictions. At the 1984
Democratic convention, on national television,
Jackson named lesbians and gay men as an
oppressed segment of the U.S. population. It
was an important first for all of us.
Yet. by last month. Jackson's vision of the
rainbow had lost the shade of lavender. Our
existence and suffering, our contributions and
our struggle, were sunk again in silence as
Jackson avoided any mention of the words
"gay," "lesbian" or even "AIDS." His speech
lasted over an hour and detailed a vast list of
social injustices. Our conspicuous exclusion,
after prior inclusion, was demoralizing and
painful.
In addition, no representative of GLAS was
invited to join the student presenters who
preceded Jackson (there were also no repre
sentatives from the Women's Center, Jewish
community or disabled student groups). One
by one, student presenters from black, native
American, African, Asian-American and

"progressive" campus organizations gave
moving speeches about justice, human
freedom and how the roots of many forms of
oppression are inextricably intertwined. Yet,
as each of these speakers failed to recognize us
as oppressed people, as allies or potential
allies, we were shrouded deeper in silence and
invisibility.
The lesbians and gay men of color walked
away from the event deeply denied and
banished. The lesbian and gay blacks,
Chicanos, Asians and native Americans heard
again that while there may be no home in the
white world, there is also little safety in their
respective communities of color. Amid calls for
coalition which ignored our existence, the
irony was bitter in our knowledge that GLAS
may well be the most truly multi-racial organi
zation on this campus.
On Jan. 31, the Public Service Center spon
sored a conference on "Families in Transition;
Meeting the Challenges." An impressive spec
trum of workshops was presented, but there
was not a single speaker, let alone panel, on
lesbian and gay family issues.
The delusions of the U.S. Supreme Court
notwithstanding, homosexuality has a great
deal to do with families. Contrary to popular
belief, lesbians and gay men are not hatched,
and most of us come from families. Some of
our families respect, accept and affirm us.
Some of us have left our families, but. more of
ten, our families have left us. Many of us only
have families because we lie to our parents,
sisters and brothers. Some of us lie to our
spouses and children. It is entirely possible
that you are the loved one someone is lying to.
Members of your family may be strangers to
you, and while you may not know a thing
about it. they live, we live, missing you deeply.
Lesbians and gay men also create our own
family structures. We are excluded from the so
cial and legal institution of marriage and we
have complex parenting and custody concerns.
The Lesbian Rights Project, the Bay Area
Lawyers for Individual Freedoms and the Gay
and Lesbian Family Issues Committee are or
ganizations located in San Francisco. It is dif

ficult to believe that a phone call would not
have produced a speaker.
Last but not least, Dean of Student Affairs
Jim Lyons recently informed GLAS that the
University does not intend to bar employers
who "legally discriminate" on the basis of
sexual orientation from using Career Planning
and Placement Center office services or from
interviewing students on campus. It is clear to
us that this decision violates the University
policy adopted last summer which prohibits
discrimination on the basis of sexual orienta
tion. Basically, the civil and human rights of
over 10 percent of the student body are expen
dable when Stanford is confronted with the
risk of offending an extremely homophobic
military, CIA and FBI. We find the contention
that the federal government would actually
withdraw research funds if Stanford barred
discriminatory agencies far-fetched in the ex
treme.
We iopk to Starlford for protection of our civil,
rights, not a restatement of the laws that per
mit them to be violated. Thorough enforce
ment of the University's non-discrimination
policy is all the more imperative for us because
we have little or no law to protect our rights.
The business and law schools have both
barred government (and all other) employers
who admittedly discriminate on the basis of
sexual orientation from recruiting on campus.
We see no reason why the University should
not implement its own policy with equal in
tegrity.
It has been a painful and difficult month for
us, but the days when we will be complicit in
our own erasure are long past. We expect the
heterosexual members of ihis community to
recognize that they and their norms are not
the only socio-sexual culture in existence here
or elsewhere.
