# The 						Democratic nominee is...
## 
### 
On Monday, Democratic Rep.
Richard Gephardt of Missouri
took a deep breath, stepped up to
the podium and belted the first
political pitch of the new presiden
tial campaign season out of the
park.
Still reeling from the decision of
New York Gov. Mario Cuomo to
withdraw his organization from
the campaign, presidential hope
fuls are hurriedly limbering up
their campaign staffs, testing out
up-and-coming strategies and
scouting the opposition.

With only a year and a half left in
which to campaign for president
of the United States, Oval Office
hopefuls are quickly realizing elec
tion time is approaching faster
than a Dwight Gooden fastball.
The preseason is a time for
guess work, hopes and. most im
portantly. prognostications. So.
without futher ado. here are the
first annual Daily Democratic
presidential nomination predic
tions. listed In order of projected
finish. (Look for the Republican
forecasts in an upcoming col
umn.) If some candidates listed
decline to enter, be sure to cross
them out on your scorecard and
re-evaluate as necessarv.

DEMOCRATS
Eastern Division
1. Sam Nunn, Georgia
2. Bill Bradley, New Jersey
3. Joseph Biden, Delaware
4. Jesse Jackson, Illinois
5 Michael Dukakis. Massachusetts
OK, so maybe it is doubtful that
Nunn will to declare himself a can
didate. However, as a southern
conservative, he could out-belly
buck the big boys on the March 8.
1988 Super Tuesday showdown.
He is also a respected expert on
defense issues, and word has it
that the military will be hot stuff
in '88. So come on, Sam. toss
those doubts out the window of
vulnerability and declare.
Bill Bradley will not run. He is
not now a candidate, never has
been considered one and will not
be an '88 candidate anytime in the
future. However, he played for the
Knicks, won a Rhodes scholar
ship. is a pragmatic guy and, best
of all. he is from New Jersey. Too
bad he's not running.
Everyone seems to be pushing
for a Biden presidential bid. and
chances are the senator from
Deleware will declare. Biden is ar
ticulate. but questions remain as
to whether he has enough hair to
win a general presidential elec
tion. If Nunn and Bradley don't
run, look for Biden to win.
Jackson has the ability to turn
some heads, but he has lost the
novelty he held in the 1984 cam
paign and his base is still too nar

row to win the nomination.
With the elimination of Cuomo,
Dukakis is being presented as the
liberal alternative. He will fail,
however. As Andrew Patzman, as
fine a redhead as any to emerge
from the Sunflower State in recent
years, put it, "Northeastern eth
nics won't wash in Kansas."
Western Division
1. Gary Hart, Ottawa, Kansas
2. Bruce Babbitt, Arizona
3. Richard Gephardt, Missouri
4. Donald Kennedy, Stanford
5. Dale Bumpers, Arkansas
Hart has visibility and some
degree of stature. As a published
spy novelist, the former senator
should have little trouble fitting in
with the boys at the NSC. FBI and
CIA.
A pragmatic and popular former
governor. Babbitt could give Hart
a run for his money. According to
Andrew, "A president named Bab
bitt â€” it's about time. Especially if
he beats a guy named du Pont." If
Hart falters, look for the former
governor to fill in the void.
Gephardt is the first of the lot of
major Democrats to declare.
Therefore, he will lose.
Our own beloved University
president has no presidential
ambitions. In fact, he has consis
tently denied he will run for any
elected office. However. I needed
one more person to fill out the
Western Division slate. Intimate
sources speculate that Kennedy
may have taken a sabbatical this
quarter to wrestle with the pros

and cons of throwing his hat into
the presidential ring. The presi
dent might not run. but "from the
Hoover House to the White House"
certainly has a nice ring to it.
Bumpers, who has what Chris
Fialko called "the silliest name in
politics." could do well on Super
Tuesday. Unfortunately for
Bumpers, however, he will prob
ably receive little more than
chuckles at introductions outside
of the South.
All this leaves a nomination bat
tle between Hart and Nunn (or
Biden. seeing as Bradley definitely
isn't going to run.) Most people
would pick Hart as the favorite. I.
however, am not most people.
Hart is like a supernova. He will
collapse in upon himself under
the immense pull of his own in
consistencies. Hart will shine
brightly early in the race as he
releases large quantities of politi
cal energy before fizzling into a
black hole. Look for the Demo
cratic Eastern Division champ,
therefore, to capture the nomina
tion and take on the Republican
challanger.
I had planned on doing the
Republicans this week as well, but
given the current controversy con
cerning Reagan's memory. I
decided to wait for a few weeks in
order to find out whether Vice
President George Bush will run as
a hopeful or as an incumbent.
Look for the Republican predic
tions in one of my upcoming
columns.
