Alumni unite
As an alumnus of Stanford, I
would like to raise my voice in
objection to the Stan
ford/Hoover/Reagan connection
and suggest to other alumni a
course of action that would com
municate our concern to the
University Administration in a
meaningful way.
The acquisition of presidential
papers is an obvious asset to any
university — but we need to
seriously question the price we
are willing to pay for them. Ap
parently, the price — or condition
— that the Reagan administra
tion has demanded of the Univer
sity is two-fold. First, we are
being asked to allow our campus
to be used as a tribute to the
Reagan administration, despite
our concerns about the environ
mental impact.
Second, we are being asked to
accept both the use of Stanford's
name to validate the policies of
the Reagan administration by
association and to allow the
Hoover Institution control over
the University's administrative
decisions. That is, Hoover's abil
ity to manifest the association of
a prestigious university with a
particular political ideology.
We need to let the University
Administration know that what
has been acceptable to them is
not acceptable to us. Our contin
ued support of the University
through our alumni contribu
tions should not be uncondi
tional. I would like to see us
either withhold our contributions
or place our contributions into a
special fund or escrow account
pending the Administration's
acknowledgement of the Reagan
connection and action on its part
to break that connection. Mini
mally, a break would be evidenced
by a major reduction in the scale
of the project (to one that is more

appropriate to the importance of
the papers to Stanford — i.e., as
one more resource for academic
research). If a reduction in scale
is unacceptable to Reagan and
Hoover, the Administration could
invite the Reagan Library Foun
dation to move its project to an
other, perhaps more appreciative,
prestigious university.

Condoms will
be optional
I am writing to clarify some
questions that may have arisen
from the recent article on condom
dispensers (Daily. Feb. 24). A
crucial point not mentioned in
the story is that the installation
of a dispenser hinges upon ap
proval by the student residence in
question. The task force does not
intend to push the dispensers on
students.
Student response, whether
positive, negative or apathetic, is
our top priority. Throughout our
research, we have been sensitive
to students' feelings toward the
proposed dispensers because we
believe our project poses issues
that affect the whole campus
community and extend beyond
the requirements of our course.
The efficacy of condom dis
pensers. in fact, depends upon
students' collective articulation
and discussion of their concerns.
And it is with such serious con
siderations that, we hope, con
dom dispensers will spur not
promiscuity but heightened
awareness for making informed
decisions to minimize unwanted
pregnancies and STDs.
