## Pubs, performers, music featured Oxford Ball to bring Old World charm to Stanford 
### JAMES DICKEY Editorial staff 
This year, the Stanford commu
nity may see the beginning of an
exciting new institution.
The new addition to the Farm's
cultural scene will have more than
a tinge of Old World flavor. Based
on an English tradition, the Ox
ford Ball, In its inaugural May 1
appearance in the Inner Quad. Is
the result of the "Oxford Experi
ence" as seen through the eyes of
senior Leslie Svalstad.
"The Ball is something com
pletely new and different that the
majority of Stanford students
have never experienced," ex
plained Svalstad, chair of the Ox
ford Ball Committee. "I learned
about it while at the Stanford pro
gram in Oxford last year and

decided it was something worth
sharing."
The idea that Svalstad brought
back from merry old England
blossomed a short time after her
return to Stanford,
"I discussed my thoughts about
starting a ball here with a few
friends who had been in Oxford
some time during last year,"
Svalstad said. "Everybody seemed
interested, so we started meeting
to get organized and make plans."
Starting with a group of five stu
dents who had been at Oxford, the
Oxford Ball Committee was
formed and began making plans
for May 1. Each of the committee
members recruited friends for the
organization, which has since
swelled to 45 students and 30 fac
ulty members.

All this manpower will be neces
sary, for different from other,
more traditional balls or dances,
"walking into the Oxford Ball
should be like walking into a
drama from a different time," ac
cording to senior Will Oscherwitz,
the Ball's refreshment chair.
Noting that the theme of the
Ball will vary each year, Svalstad
said that this year's theme will be

the Renaissance. Since the pur
pose of the theme only is to tie to
gether the Ball's various events.
Svalstad explained that the occa
sion would not simply be a Renais
sance faire.
"The Ball will actually consist of
a varied mix of times and themes,"
she said. "There will be everything
from roaming performers to a pub
and a movie room."

The entire experience will take
place in a completely changed In
ner Quad. "We're making it (the
Inner Quad) into an English
quad," Svalstad said.
Guest participation will be en
couraged for the occasion, and in
tune with the theme, guests will
have the option of wearing black
tie or Renaissance clothing. In or
der to make things as easy as pos
sible for those adventurous
enough to wear a costume, the
committee is preparing a list of
typical outfits and nearby
costume shops.
Although unwilling to reveal the
exact details of the events that will
be featured at the Ball. Svalstad
said there will be at least one
band, acting troupes, refresh
ments and drinks in addition to
the pub and movie house.

The committee is reluctant to
reveal the details of the event in
the hope of preserving the Ball's
spontaneity and authenticity.
Authenticity is certainly one
thing that the committee is deter
mined to provide. "More than any
thing." said Svalstad, "we want
this to be a unique experience —
not just 'a taste of England.' "
The ball will be preceded by an
"English Week," which will in
clude, among other things, a
cricket demonstration, an Oxford
style debate, performances of old
English songs and a British movie
night. English Week will cul
minate with the Ball.
In the words of senior Wil
James, security chairman, "It's
gonna be a party."
Tickets go on sale Monday. April
