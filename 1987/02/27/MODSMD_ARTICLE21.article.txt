# Winter quarter blues getting you down? Escape to Pfeiffer-Big Sur State Park
## 
### NANNETTE THOMPSON Staff writer 
No matter how students feel about campus
life, most like to get away from the Peninsula at
times. A relaxing, affordable weekend near the
ocean and California redwoods is just slightly
over two hours away. Pfeiffer-Big Sur State
Park, located 26 miles south of Carmel on
scenic Highway 1, offers a nice chance for a
weekend retreat.
The state park is a 700-acre expanse of red
wood forests and winding streams. The Cali
fornia Parks and Recreation Department ac
quired the area in 1934 from the family of Mi
chael Pfeiffer, a California homesteader.
Over time the department converted the area
into a resort with campgrounds, cabins, a
lodge, grocery stores and a restaurant.
Today, in addition to a picnic area for day
users, the park has over 200 campsites, which
are available at a cost of *6 each per night.
Each has a barbecue pit and picnic table. Hot
showers, bathrooms and running water are
nearby.
Eight people are allowed per campground,
although two group campsites are available
and can accommodate up to 50 people.
The park is known for its easy to moderate

hiking trails, which range from a few hundred
yards to 4 miles in length. A popular, yet
serene, hiking path is Pfeiffer Falls Trail, a
half-hour trip through tall, shady redwoods.
The trail ends at the base of 60-foot waterfalls.
Valley View Trail, winding its way through
an oak and grassland habitat, leads from the
falls back toward the starting point.
Other activities are available for the camper.
A baseball field is located in the middle of the
park for those who want to bring along their
Aerobie or baseball mitt. Numerous streams
tantalize fishermen with the promise of a fine
catch.
The Big Sur River, which runs alongside the
campsites, is ice-cold in the winter, but with
the arrival of spring, people can swim or raft
the gentle rapids.
Since the Big Sur Lodge is adjacent to the
campgrounds, the niceties of civilization are
readily at hand. There are two
grocery/convenience stores. Prices tend to run
a little higher than larger Bay Area grocery
stores, but they are convenient for those who
forget lighter fluid or need more firewood.
There is also a continental restaurant open
for breakfast, lunch and dinner. The lunch
menu varies with the day. Dinner ranges from

$8 for spaghetti to • 12.95 for top sirloin.
The gift shop next door is stocked with
souvenirs ranging from suede moccasins to
earrings.
Only a few yards from these symbols of
civilization, wildlife inhabits the forest. Brave
ground squirrels have been known to snatch
food from picnic tables, but there is good news
for campers who fear bears. The largest
animals in the park are gray foxes and deer.
Another plus for Big Sur is that it is close to
other attractions. Hearst San Simeon State
Historical Monument, often referred to as the
Hearst Castle, is 65 miles south on Highway 1.
In the opposite direction along the coast is
the Monterey State Historical Park — a site
preserved as representative of early Spanish-
Mexican history — which is located in down
town Monterey.
Nearby Carmel offers quaint antique shops
and numerous art galleries. It is known for its
fine dining and its famous mayor, actor Clint
Eastwood.
Reservations for camping at Pfeiffer-Big Sur
State Park are recommended and may be ob
tained through Mistix ticket agency. The
closest outlet is in The North Face, located at
383 University Ave. in Palo Alto.
