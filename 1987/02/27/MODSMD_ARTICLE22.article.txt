## Wright's buzzer-beater skins Wildcats 
### SUSAN SLUSSER Editorial staff 
The last time Howard Wright took a
game-deciding shot at the buzzer was last
year against Seton Hall. He missed. Stan
ford lost 76-75 In overtime.
Wright more than made up for that
miss last night against Arizona, hitting a
14-footer with one second left to lift Stan
ford to a 75-73 win over the second-place
Wildcats, after the Cardinal had erased a
12-polnt halftime deficit.
"I heard the crowd counting and I knew
I had to shoot or pass," said Stanford
guard Novlan Whitsitt, who had the ball
with time running out. "At the last
second I saw Howard open and I knew he
had a better shot than I did. ... 1 didn't
have a good shot. There were two people
on me — one considerably taller.
"1 was able to see the clock before I
jumped, and I knew I had a couple of
seconds left," he continued. "Howard was
just standing there with his hands open."
"I kind of want to go watch it on tape —
it's unbelievable," said Wright, who
finished with 14 points. "It felt good com
ing off. I didn't have time to think about
the consequences. It was a matter of
inches — it could have gone either way.
I'm still a little bit in awe."
The victory keeps Stanford's hopes alive
for a coveted (believe it or not) sixth-place
finish in the Pacific 10 Conference — a
position that would give Stanford a bye in
the first round of the Pac-10 Post-Season
Tournament. The Cardinal is now 14-12
on the season and 8-9 in the conference,
tied for sixth who Oregon, who lost 81-74
to Washington in overtime last night.
If Stanford defeats Arizona State tomor
row (3 p.m., KCBS 740 AM. KZSU 90.1
FM and KPIX, TV 5) and the Ducks lose to
Washington State, then the Cardinal will
end up alone in sixth.
Arizona's chance at a second straight
Pac-10 championship ended with the loss
to Stanford coupled with UCLA's 82-76
win over USC last night. UCLA clinched
the league title with a 14-4 mark. The

Wildcats are assured of a second-place
finish, with a 12-5 conference record and
a 17-10 overall record.
Before 5,249 fans at Maples Pavilion,
the Wildcats charged ahead in the first
half after an early Stanford lead, going up
15-13 on a Craig McMillan three-point
shot. Arizona slowly built the lead to
seven, then nine, and finally 14, following
a string of seven straight points near the
end of the half which put the 'Cats up 4 1-
27.
Stanford's first half problems were
clear. The Arizona defense was collapsing
on leading Cardinal scorer Todd Lichti,
who was surrounded every time he
touched the ball and held to just two
points in the half. In addition, point
guard Terry Taylor, who averaged 17.3
points per game in his previous three out
ings, was also limited to two points. The
Wildcats shot 59 percent from the field;
Stanford shot 42 percent.
"We were definitely flat the first half,"
said Whitsitt, who finished tied with Eric
Reveno for team-high scoring honors
with 17 points.
"Arizona was much more aggressive in
the first half," Stanford Coach Mike
Montgomery said. "We had some good
shots, but they just would not go down. I
told our kids that they had to play better
defensively in the second half, and they
responded well."
Stanford responded well enough to
more than turn the second half shooting
percentages completeley around — the
Cardinal hit 69 percent in the closing per
iod to 40 percent for Arizona. The real key
to Stanford's comeback, however, was the
clutch play of the entire team, especially
Reveno, who had 13 rebounds — includ
ing seven offensive boards — to go along
with his 17 points.
Whitsitt was another catalyst for the
Cardinal, especially early In the second
half, when Stanford trailed 45-31. Whit
sitt hit a three-pointer from the right side
to cut the difference to 11, and then mo
ments later slammed home a fast-break
feed from Lichti to make the score 47-36.
With Arizona ahead 53-40, the Cardinal

got four straight scores on two Lichti
jumpers, a Whitsitt free throw and a
Reveno hook to clip the Wildcat lead to
six. The teams traded baskets until the
9:53 mark, when, with Arizona up 59-51,
Whitsitt hit another three-point shot and
followed with a fast break layin on a long
pass from Reveno to cut the score to 59-
56.
Stanford finally tied things up at 64 on
an 18-footer by Scott Meinert from the top
of the key, and charged ahead 70-66 as
Lichti broke free with six straight points
— a drive layln on which he was fouled
and hit the free throw, a 17-foot jumper
and another free throw.
The Wildcats went back up 71-70 after
two Tom Tolbert free throws and a Sean
Elliot bank shot. Elliot, who totaled a
game-high 23 points, was fouled by Lichti
on the play and canned the free throw.
Taylor then came off the bench for the
Cardinal to hit a clutch three-pointer
from the right side to put Stanford on top
73-71 with 1:10 left. The Cardinal played
excellent defense against Arizona in the
last minute, highlighted by a Reveno
block of an Elliot shot — one of four
blocks on the night for the junior forward.
With 29 seconds left, however. Taylor was
whistled for a disputed foul on McMillan,
and McMillan sank both ends of the one
and-one to tie things at 73.
Stanford then played for the last shot.
With time running out. it was Whitsitt
with the ball outside on the left side.
"It was kind of scary," Whitsitt said. "It
was more out of desperation than any
thing. I was hesitant — I didn't know
whether to call a time out or not. ... I got
the ball, there was no play designed, it
just worked out."
"I thought he was going to miss,"
Reveno said. "I just went to the boards as
hard as I could. . . . That was the greatest
feeling I've had in basketball to date. I felt
like jumping around and making a fool of
myself and not worrying about it.
"It would be nice to say it's no big deal,
but I was really excited. I guess I'm not
that cool. I wanted to give Howard a big
hug. It was just fantastic."
