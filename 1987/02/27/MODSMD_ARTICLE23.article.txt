# Stanford faces UCLA in Six-Pac season opener
## Card picked to edge Bruins in tight race 
### TOM SENF Editorial staff 
Trying to foresee what Is going to happen in the
Pacific 10 Southern Division can be a dangerous
business, as my illustrious predecessor, Rob
Graham, discovered last year. Graham ticketed Stan
ford for fourth place, a choice that was less than
popular and, as it turned out. less than accurate.
The Cardinal came in second. In fact, for much of the
season Graham's picks and the league standings
were almost perfectly inverted.
Hoping to avoid Graham's fate, 1 decided to consult
some of the experts, the Six-Pac coaches. UCLA's
Gary Adams wasn't much help.
"I think anybody can win it," Adams said. "Polls,

Mark Marquess said. "I strongly believe that the fa
vorite should be the team with the most experience,
and UCLA is head and shoulders above everybody
else."
Conference play began last weekend with UCLA
taking two of three from Arizona at home. Stanford
opens its Six-Pac season in Los Angeles with a three
game series against the Bruins, while California
plays at Arizona and USC hosts Arizona State.
"We'll really know where we stand after this
weekend," Stanford centerfielder Toi Cook said.
Here's where they'll stand at the end of the season:

"1 think it'll be Stanford and UCLA, probably in
that order," said Jerry Kindall, coach of defending
national champion Arizona.

The defending Six-Pac champs began the season
ranked second in the nation, but got off to a slow

start and are now at No. 9. UCLA was just 5-5 before
meeting Arizona and is now 9-6.
The Bruins are led by All-America pitcher Alex
Sanchez and an offense that uses the intimate

Catcher Doug Robbins was not quite able to steal home on this play, but Stanford is hoping to snare the
Pacific 10 Southern Division title away from UCLA this year. The Cardinal begins Six-Pac play today
against the Bruins in Los Angeles.
