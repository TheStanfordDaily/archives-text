# Stanford faces UCLA in Six-Pac season opener
## Card picked to edge Bruins in tight race 
### TOM SENF Editorial staff 
Trying to foresee what Is going to happen in the
Pacific 10 Southern Division can be a dangerous
business, as my illustrious predecessor, Rob
Graham, discovered last year. Graham ticketed Stan
ford for fourth place, a choice that was less than
popular and, as it turned out. less than accurate.
The Cardinal came in second. In fact, for much of the
season Graham's picks and the league standings
were almost perfectly inverted.
Hoping to avoid Graham's fate, 1 decided to consult
some of the experts, the Six-Pac coaches. UCLA's
Gary Adams wasn't much help.
"I think anybody can win it," Adams said. "Polls,
schmolls. Any ballclub in our league is capable of
beating anyone anytime."
Some, however, are more capable than others. "I
think UCLA Is by far the strongest," Stanford Coach
Mark Marquess said. "I strongly believe that the fa
vorite should be the team with the most experience,
and UCLA is head and shoulders above everybody
else."
Conference play began last weekend with UCLA
taking two of three from Arizona at home. Stanford
opens its Six-Pac season in Los Angeles with a three
game series against the Bruins, while California
plays at Arizona and USC hosts Arizona State.
"We'll really know where we stand after this
weekend," Stanford centerfielder Toi Cook said.
Here's where they'll stand at the end of the season:
1. Stanford
"1 think it'll be Stanford and UCLA, probably in
that order," said Jerry Kindall, coach of defending
national champion Arizona.
So do I.

Pac, see the adjacent article.
2. UCLA
The defending Six-Pac champs began the season
ranked second in the nation, but got off to a slow

start and are now at No. 9. UCLA was just 5-5 before
meeting Arizona and is now 9-6.
The Bruins are led by All-America pitcher Alex
Sanchez and an offense that uses the intimate

against the Bruins in Los Angeles.
confines of Jackie Robinson
Stadium to good advantage. "I was
quite impressed with UCLA, espe
cially in their ballpark," Klndall
said after UCLA scored over 30
runs last weekend, including 18
in the series finale.
To show that Its 18-run out
burst against Arizona was no
fluke, the Bruins pounded UC-
Santa Barbara for 17 in Just 4 in
nings last week. "The bats are
starting to wake up," Adams said.
One bat that rarely sleeps for the
Bruins belongs to senior second
baseman Torey Lovullo. After a 16-
homer, 65-RBI season last year,
Lovullo already has six longballs
and 20 RBIs this season. He and
Sanchez were the Six-Pac's co-
MVPs in 1986.

Other potent Bruins include
sophomore catcher Billy Has
leman, who is hitting .410. and
third baseman Scott Cline (.325
with four homers). Steve Hisey is
struggling at .222 now, but the All
Six-Pac leftfielder (.342, 17
homers. 59 RBIs last year) is a
threat to bust loose at any time.
After Sanchez (16-3, 4.06 ERA a
year ago), the Bruins' pitching is
somewhat suspect, although
right-hander Randy Hennis has
impressed Marquess and lefty
Steve Stowell (3-1, 4.43) is off to a
solid start.
The Bruins may have an added
incentive this year beyond defend
ing their title. "I'm sure they're
hungry," Cook said. "They had
their own regional last year and
got knocked out in two games.
That's embarrassing."
UCLA may be doing some em
barrassing of its own this season.

3. Arizona
The Wildcats' 1986 season
showed just how tough the Six-
Pac is. Arizona finished third with
an 18-12 record (Stanford was
also 18-12 but took four of six be
tween the teams), received an at
large bid to NCAA tournament,
then rolled through the Central
Regional at Texas and the College
World Series on an 8-1 rampage
that gave Kindall his third na
tional title.
Kindall believes his 11-5, 10th
ranked Wildcats are a step below
the top two teams, and he may be
right. "We're a darkhorse, that's
all I can say," he said. "We've been
inconsistent."
Many of the last year's top
names are gone, but Arizona
returns two outstanding players
in pitcher Gilbert Heredia and
catcher Steve Strong. Heredia
finished with a 16-3 record in
1986, including a 3-0 mark in

postseason play, while Strong
made the All Six-Pac team as a
designated hitter by batting .396,
second in the league.
Arizona is young and unsettled
at many positions, but a generally
outstanding level of talent —
shown by players such as fresh
man shortstop Greg Fowble (.350,
19 RBls so far this season from
the No. 9 spot in the order) —
should keep the Wildcats in the
upper half of the standings.
4. USC
The preseason outlook was not
too bright for the Trojans, coming
off a 12-18 Six-Pac season. 26-29
overall. USC lost five players to the
professional ranks, including All
Six-Pac pitcher Brad Brink. The
Trojans would also be without
Coach Rod Dedeaux, who retired
after 45 years and a collegiate
record 1,332 wins.
But new Coach Mike Gillespie

has USC off to a 10-4 start. The
Trojans have beaten No. 6 Pep
perdine. No. 13 UCSB and No. 26
Hawaii.
The key to the Trojans' surpris
ing success has been a stingy
pitching staff led by sophomore
transfer Darrin Beer and reliever
Brian Nichols.
5. Arizona State
ASU, 8-7, is the Six-Pac's ver
sion of the San Diego Chargers. In
recent years the Sun Devils have
scored runs in bunches but have
allowed them in even bigger
bunches.
This season, however, things
are different. Coach Jim Brock
hired a new pitching coach, Dub
Kllgo, and the Sun Devils' ERA is
at 4.03, far better than last year's
horrendous 6.61.
ASU has also played good
defense, which in Tempe occurs
about as often as a blizzard, turn

ing 26 double plays In 15 games.
But some things will not change
too much, like the Sun Devils'
record. Only designated hitter
Tony Mattla (7 HRs. 21 RBls) Is
putting up typical ASU offensive
numbers.
6. California
The bad news for the Bears is
that they lost All Six-Pac
performers Kevin Maas (.326. 18
HRs. 66 RBIs), Jerry Goff (.352,
18. 52) and four-time All Slx-Pac
selection Lance Blankenship
(.340, 46 stolen bases). The worse
news Is that even with this for
midable trio. Cal finished last In
the conference with a 10-20
league mark.
And don't look for experienced
pitching to bail the Bears out. Cal
will begin the season with two
freshmen and a sophomore In its
starting rotation.

schmolls. Any ballclub in our league is capable of
beating anyone anytime."
Some, however, are more capable than others. "I
think UCLA Is by far the strongest," Stanford Coach
Mark Marquess said. "I strongly believe that the fa
vorite should be the team with the most experience,
and UCLA is head and shoulders above everybody
else."
Conference play began last weekend with UCLA
taking two of three from Arizona at home. Stanford
opens its Six-Pac season in Los Angeles with a three
game series against the Bruins, while California
plays at Arizona and USC hosts Arizona State.
"We'll really know where we stand after this
weekend," Stanford centerfielder Toi Cook said.
Here's where they'll stand at the end of the season:
1. Stanford
"1 think it'll be Stanford and UCLA, probably in
that order," said Jerry Kindall, coach of defending
national champion Arizona.
So do I.

If you want to know why Stanford will win (he Six-
Pac, see the adjacent article.
2. UCLA
The defending Six-Pac champs began the season
ranked second in the nation, but got off to a slow

start and are now at No. 9. UCLA was just 5-5 before
meeting Arizona and is now 9-6.
The Bruins are led by All-America pitcher Alex
Sanchez and an offense that uses the intimate

Catcher Doug Robbins was not quite able to steal home on this play, but Stanford is hoping to snare the
Pacific 10 Southern Division title away from UCLA this year. The Cardinal begins Six-Pac play today
against the Bruins in Los Angeles.
confines of Jackie Robinson
Stadium to good advantage. "I was
quite impressed with UCLA, espe
cially in their ballpark," Klndall
said after UCLA scored over 30
runs last weekend, including 18
in the series finale.
To show that Its 18-run out
burst against Arizona was no
fluke, the Bruins pounded UC-
Santa Barbara for 17 in Just 4 in
nings last week. "The bats are
starting to wake up," Adams said.
One bat that rarely sleeps for the
Bruins belongs to senior second
baseman Torey Lovullo. After a 16-
homer, 65-RBI season last year,
Lovullo already has six longballs
and 20 RBIs this season. He and
Sanchez were the Six-Pac's co-
MVPs in 1986.

Other potent Bruins include
sophomore catcher Billy Has
leman, who is hitting .410. and
third baseman Scott Cline (.325
with four homers). Steve Hisey is
struggling at .222 now, but the All
Six-Pac leftfielder (.342, 17
homers. 59 RBIs last year) is a
threat to bust loose at any time.
After Sanchez (16-3, 4.06 ERA a
year ago), the Bruins' pitching is
somewhat suspect, although
right-hander Randy Hennis has
impressed Marquess and lefty
Steve Stowell (3-1, 4.43) is off to a
solid start.
The Bruins may have an added
incentive this year beyond defend
ing their title. "I'm sure they're
hungry," Cook said. "They had
their own regional last year and
got knocked out in two games.
That's embarrassing."
UCLA may be doing some em
barrassing of its own this season.

3. Arizona
The Wildcats' 1986 season
showed just how tough the Six-
Pac is. Arizona finished third with
an 18-12 record (Stanford was
also 18-12 but took four of six be
tween the teams), received an at
large bid to NCAA tournament,
then rolled through the Central
Regional at Texas and the College
World Series on an 8-1 rampage
that gave Kindall his third na
tional title.
Kindall believes his 11-5, 10th
ranked Wildcats are a step below
the top two teams, and he may be
right. "We're a darkhorse, that's
all I can say," he said. "We've been
inconsistent."
Many of the last year's top
names are gone, but Arizona
returns two outstanding players
in pitcher Gilbert Heredia and
catcher Steve Strong. Heredia
finished with a 16-3 record in
1986, including a 3-0 mark in

postseason play, while Strong
made the All Six-Pac team as a
designated hitter by batting .396,
second in the league.
Arizona is young and unsettled
at many positions, but a generally
outstanding level of talent —
shown by players such as fresh
man shortstop Greg Fowble (.350,
19 RBls so far this season from
the No. 9 spot in the order) —
should keep the Wildcats in the
upper half of the standings.
4. USC
The preseason outlook was not
too bright for the Trojans, coming
off a 12-18 Six-Pac season. 26-29
overall. USC lost five players to the
professional ranks, including All
Six-Pac pitcher Brad Brink. The
Trojans would also be without
Coach Rod Dedeaux, who retired
after 45 years and a collegiate
record 1,332 wins.
But new Coach Mike Gillespie

has USC off to a 10-4 start. The
Trojans have beaten No. 6 Pep
perdine. No. 13 UCSB and No. 26
Hawaii.
The key to the Trojans' surpris
ing success has been a stingy
pitching staff led by sophomore
transfer Darrin Beer and reliever
Brian Nichols.
5. Arizona State
ASU, 8-7, is the Six-Pac's ver
sion of the San Diego Chargers. In
recent years the Sun Devils have
scored runs in bunches but have
allowed them in even bigger
bunches.
This season, however, things
are different. Coach Jim Brock
hired a new pitching coach, Dub
Kllgo, and the Sun Devils' ERA is
at 4.03, far better than last year's
horrendous 6.61.
ASU has also played good
defense, which in Tempe occurs
about as often as a blizzard, turn

ing 26 double plays In 15 games.
But some things will not change
too much, like the Sun Devils'
record. Only designated hitter
Tony Mattla (7 HRs. 21 RBls) Is
putting up typical ASU offensive
numbers.
6. California
The bad news for the Bears is
that they lost All Six-Pac
performers Kevin Maas (.326. 18
HRs. 66 RBIs), Jerry Goff (.352,
18. 52) and four-time All Slx-Pac
selection Lance Blankenship
(.340, 46 stolen bases). The worse
news Is that even with this for
midable trio. Cal finished last In
the conference with a 10-20
league mark.
And don't look for experienced
pitching to bail the Bears out. Cal
will begin the season with two
freshmen and a sophomore In its
starting rotation.
Trying to foresee what Is going to happen in the
Pacific 10 Southern Division can be a dangerous
business, as my illustrious predecessor, Rob
Graham, discovered last year. Graham ticketed Stan
ford for fourth place, a choice that was less than
popular and, as it turned out. less than accurate.
The Cardinal came in second. In fact, for much of the
season Graham's picks and the league standings
were almost perfectly inverted.
Hoping to avoid Graham's fate, 1 decided to consult
some of the experts, the Six-Pac coaches. UCLA's
Gary Adams wasn't much help.
"I think anybody can win it," Adams said. "Polls,
schmolls. Any ballclub in our league is capable of
beating anyone anytime."
