# Why Cardinal will take conference title
## 
### TOM SENF Editorial staff 
Twenty wins (in 30 games) should be good enough
to win the Pacific 10 Southern Division crown this
year, and there are nine reasons why I think Stan
ford will be the team to get them.
One: The first reason is more of a confession than
a reason. I admit it â€” I'm a homer.
Two: Expert testimony. In a preseason poll, four of
the six conference coaches picked the Cardinal. The
other two chose UCLA.
Three: Jack McDowell. With all due respect to Alex
Sanchez (UCLA) and Gilbert Heredia (Arizona).
McDowell is the most dominant pitcher in the league
when he's healthy. The junior right-hander went 11-
4 last year with a 2.51 ERA, but what was most im
pressive about his season was his 2.98 ERA in league
games, a truly amazing figure in the high-scoring
Six-Pac.
McDowell has only pitched three times since May
because of a sore shoulder and a pulled groin, but he
should be back in top form soon. "It's a matter of get
ting stronger, getting crispness on my pitches," he
said. "I think I should get better every time out."
Four: Pitching. Offense usually rules in the Six-
Pac. but it's hard not to like the team with the best
pitching. Even without McDowell, Stanford is just
plain loaded. Junior right-hander Lee Plemel came
into his own last year, going 7-4 with a 3.36 ERA.
Sophomore Steve Chitren (2-0, 3.75 (his year) will
be the No. 3 starter, but should he falter, senior Rob
Wassenaar, sophomore Jim Price or sophomore
Brian Keyser will be ready to step in. Whoever doesn't
start will join senior southpaw A 1 Osuna (2-1, 2.86)
in the bullpen.
