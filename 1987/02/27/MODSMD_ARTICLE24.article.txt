# Why Cardinal will take conference title
## 
### TOM SENF Editorial staff 
Twenty wins (in 30 games) should be good enough
to win the Pacific 10 Southern Division crown this
year, and there are nine reasons why I think Stan
ford will be the team to get them.
One: The first reason is more of a confession than
a reason. I admit it — I'm a homer.
Two: Expert testimony. In a preseason poll, four of
the six conference coaches picked the Cardinal. The
other two chose UCLA.
Three: Jack McDowell. With all due respect to Alex
Sanchez (UCLA) and Gilbert Heredia (Arizona).
McDowell is the most dominant pitcher in the league
when he's healthy. The junior right-hander went 11-
4 last year with a 2.51 ERA, but what was most im
pressive about his season was his 2.98 ERA in league
games, a truly amazing figure in the high-scoring
Six-Pac.
McDowell has only pitched three times since May
because of a sore shoulder and a pulled groin, but he
should be back in top form soon. "It's a matter of get
ting stronger, getting crispness on my pitches," he
said. "I think I should get better every time out."
Four: Pitching. Offense usually rules in the Six-
Pac. but it's hard not to like the team with the best
pitching. Even without McDowell, Stanford is just
plain loaded. Junior right-hander Lee Plemel came
into his own last year, going 7-4 with a 3.36 ERA.
Sophomore Steve Chitren (2-0, 3.75 (his year) will
be the No. 3 starter, but should he falter, senior Rob
Wassenaar, sophomore Jim Price or sophomore
Brian Keyser will be ready to step in. Whoever doesn't
start will join senior southpaw A 1 Osuna (2-1, 2.86)
in the bullpen.
Stanford's pitching has not
been consistent —"We're walking
way too many people," McDowell
said — but the Cardinal has more
talented arms than anyone in the
conference, and if just four of five
throw to their ability. Stanford
will be tough to beat.
"I don't know if we'll face
anybody with pitching as good as
Stanford's." UCLA Coach Gary
Adams said.
Five: Toi Cook and Ruben
Amaro. Stanford's regular lineup
is long on talent but short on ex
perience, so the Cardinal veterans
must provide leadership and pro
duction at the top of the batting
order. Amaro has done everything
a leadoff man should, batting .369
with 17 walks, 19 runs and nine
stolen bases in 17 games.
Because of football. Cook
usually starts slowly, but he had
his best preseason ever this year.

hitting .317. The senior
centerfielder led the Cardinal in
RBls last year with 50 and hit .402
in Six-Pac play. He was especially
tough in clutch situations.
"The key for us is basically how
me and Ruben go." Cook said. "It
we get on base, we'll score runs.
It's up to us to push things."
Six: Young power. Staniord hit
just 36 homers last year. UCLA hit
103. If the Cardinal'is to dethrone
the defending Six-Pac champs, it
will have to narrow that gap. Stan
ford has 14 dingers so far this
year, five each from sophomore
third baseman Ed Sprague and
freshman rightfielder Paul Carey.
Sprague has a .317 average and
leads the team with 20 RBIs. Al
though Carey has had strikeout
problems (15 in 57 at-bats). he is
still hitting .298 with 17 RBls.
And. of course, he can reach the
seats. "How many freshmen can
say they've got five or six
homers?" Amaro said.
Seven: Stanford suffered a steep
dropoff in the middle last year
with the departure of John Ver

ducci and Pete Stanicek, but
should improve this season now
that senior shortstop David
Esquer and sophomore second
baseman Frank Carey have a year
of playing experience. The Card
inal's middle infield situation will
also be helped by the arrival of
Troy Paulsen, who leads the team
with a .379 average.
Eight: Expected to finish toward
the bottom of the league, UCLA
was able to surprise people last
year. Not any more. "We're not
gonna catch anybody napping."
Adams said.
Nine: Reason No. 9 is No. 9 him
self. Marquess. Some of his teams
have had power, some have had
speed and some have had pitch
ing. but all have had one thing in
common — success. In Marquess'
10 years at the helm. Stanford has
not had a losing season.
Marquess' teams are aggressive
and smart. They also win a lot,
taking at least a share of the Six-
Pac title three of the past four
years. This year, they should
make it four out of five.

Sophomore Steve Chitren (2-0, 3.75 (his year) will
be the No. 3 starter, but should he falter, senior Rob
Wassenaar, sophomore Jim Price or sophomore
Brian Keyser will be ready to step in. Whoever doesn't
start will join senior southpaw A 1 Osuna (2-1, 2.86)
in the bullpen.
Stanford's pitching has not
been consistent —"We're walking
way too many people," McDowell
said — but the Cardinal has more
talented arms than anyone in the
conference, and if just four of five
throw to their ability. Stanford
will be tough to beat.
"I don't know if we'll face
anybody with pitching as good as
Stanford's." UCLA Coach Gary
Adams said.
Five: Toi Cook and Ruben
Amaro. Stanford's regular lineup
is long on talent but short on ex
perience, so the Cardinal veterans
must provide leadership and pro
duction at the top of the batting
order. Amaro has done everything
a leadoff man should, batting .369
with 17 walks, 19 runs and nine
stolen bases in 17 games.
Because of football. Cook
usually starts slowly, but he had
his best preseason ever this year.

hitting .317. The senior
centerfielder led the Cardinal in
RBls last year with 50 and hit .402
in Six-Pac play. He was especially
tough in clutch situations.
"The key for us is basically how
me and Ruben go." Cook said. "It
we get on base, we'll score runs.
It's up to us to push things."
Six: Young power. Staniord hit
just 36 homers last year. UCLA hit
103. If the Cardinal'is to dethrone
the defending Six-Pac champs, it
will have to narrow that gap. Stan
ford has 14 dingers so far this
year, five each from sophomore
third baseman Ed Sprague and
freshman rightfielder Paul Carey.
Sprague has a .317 average and
leads the team with 20 RBIs. Al
though Carey has had strikeout
problems (15 in 57 at-bats). he is
still hitting .298 with 17 RBls.
And. of course, he can reach the
seats. "How many freshmen can
say they've got five or six
homers?" Amaro said.
Seven: Stanford suffered a steep
dropoff in the middle last year
with the departure of John Ver

ducci and Pete Stanicek, but
should improve this season now
that senior shortstop David
Esquer and sophomore second
baseman Frank Carey have a year
of playing experience. The Card
inal's middle infield situation will
also be helped by the arrival of
Troy Paulsen, who leads the team
with a .379 average.
Eight: Expected to finish toward
the bottom of the league, UCLA
was able to surprise people last
year. Not any more. "We're not
gonna catch anybody napping."
Adams said.
Nine: Reason No. 9 is No. 9 him
self. Marquess. Some of his teams
have had power, some have had
speed and some have had pitch
ing. but all have had one thing in
common — success. In Marquess'
10 years at the helm. Stanford has
not had a losing season.
Marquess' teams are aggressive
and smart. They also win a lot,
taking at least a share of the Six-
Pac title three of the past four
years. This year, they should
make it four out of five.
