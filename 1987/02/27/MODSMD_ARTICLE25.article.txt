# Card gets back on track with victory at Arizona
## 
### 
Guard Erica Mueser and forward Katy Steding
both broke out of February slumps last night,
scoring 12 points apiece to lead Stanford to a 62-
57 victory over Arizona in McKale Center in Tuc
son. Ariz.
"The game really wasn't that close," Cardinal
Coach Tara VanDerveer said. "If we had made our
laylns — and we missed too many — the game
would've gotten out of hand. The outcome was
never really in doubt. Even while we were missing
layln after layin. I never worried about not win
ning
With the win, Stanford improves its record to
13-12 overall. 7-8 In the Pacific 10 Conference,
and stays in a sixth place tie with California.
Arizona falls to 10-17. 3-13.
Mueser also had four assists last night to lead
the Cardinal, and she held Arizona guard Miros
lava Acosta to 15 points.
"The defense really came through." VanDerveer
said. "Erica really did a great Job against someone
who has really killed us In the past."
Steding. a freshman, improved her chances to
make the Pac-10 All-Newcomer team by turning in

her sixth double-double of the season, pacing
Stanford with 11 rebounds.
Center Jill Yanke and guard Jennifer Azzi
added 1 1 points apiece for Stanford. Azzi,
however, had only two assists in the game, bring
ing her season total to 143. Azzi now has three
games remaining to break the Stanford single
season record of 151. set by Angie Paccione in the
1982-83 season.
The Cardinal opened a 32-26 halftime edge,
then led by as many as 17 in the second half. "It
was a very good team effort," VanDerveer said,
"even when we lost momentum. It was fun to see
people making a second effort. They showed they
really wanted to win in the second half."
Forward Kami Anderson failed in her bid to
become the seventh Stanford woman to score
1.000 points in her career. Anderson finished
with eight points on miserable 3-for-14 shooting,
leaving her career total at 998.
She will likely break the barrier Saturday night
at Arizona State, as the Cardinal goes for a four
game sweep of the Arizona schools in a 6:30 p.m.
PST start.
