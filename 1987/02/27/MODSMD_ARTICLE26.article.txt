### KEN STEVENS Editorial staff 
For the sixth time in seven dual
matches this season, the Stanford
women's tennis team won all six
singles matches en route to
clinching the team victory. The
victim yesterday was UC-Santa
Barbara, which was able to pull
out one doubles match as the
Cardinal breezed to an 8-1 win at
the Stanford Tennis Stadium
Stanford raised its record to 6-
1, while the Gauchos fell to 6-4.
This afternoon at 1:30 the Card
inal hosts San Diego State.
"I thought today's match was a
good warrnup," Stanford Coach
Frank Brennan said of yesterday's
victory over UCSB. "It got us back
on the winning track."
One player who has been on the
winning track for the better part
of the last year is Patty Fendick.
The Cardinal's top performer ex

tended her collegiate singles win
ning streak to 33 matches and put
Stanford up 1-0 yesterday with a
6-2, 6-2 sweep of UCSB's Lori
Jonas in the No. 1 match.
Fendick had the crowd buzzing
as she jumped out to a 5-0 lead In
the first set. The defending NCAA
champion overwhelmed her op
ponent with a powerful array of
forehands and backhands, and a
soft touch at the net. Fendick
returned to mere mortal form in
the second set, but she still had
too much talent for Jonas.
Down at the other end of the
ladder, Stanford freshman Valerie
Wilson was taking care of the
Gauchos' Hemel Meghan! 6-0, 6-2
in the No. 6 singles match to give
the Cardinal a 2-0 lead. "I thought
overall Valerie played the best
match of anybody." ftrennan said.
Junior Kay Tittle, who last Sat

ing UCSB's Liz Costa 6-2, 6-2 in
the No. 3 singles match.
Cari Hagey made it 4-0 Stanford
as she upended the Gauchos' Jill
Thomson in the No. 5 match. 6-3,
6-3. "Carl was aggressive and
coming in (to the net) a lot," Bren
nan said.
Playing at No. 2. senior Stepha
nie Savides clinched the victory
with a 7-5, 6-4 win over Mette
Frank. Savides trailed 5-4 in the
first set but rallied Impressively to
win the next three games.
"I thought Stephanie handled
herself pretty well." Brennan said.
"She kept control and slowed it
(the pace) up. She's starting to
show some senior poise."
Lisa Green had to give a little ex
tra effort in the No. 4 singles
match in order to improve her
1987 dual-match mark to 7-0. The
Cardinal freshman was extended
to three sets by Julie Sanford but
was able to pull out a 4-6, 6-2, 6-1
win.
"Lisa was a little bit erratic."
Brennan said. "She was a little
frustrated today."
Stanford appeared headed for a
shutout as the Nos. 1 and 3

doubles teams won in straight
sets, but the Gauchos were able to
get on the scoreboard when Frank
and Meghani knocked off Tittle
and Green 7-6. 3-6, 6-2 in the No.
2 match.
This afternoon, the Cardinal
will be hard-pressed to repeat its
8-1 victory. SDSU was ranked
eighth in the preseason poll.
"They can be dangerous, because
they can be either hot or cold,"
Brennan said. "It should be an In
teresting match."
