# Swimmers favored at Pac-10s
## 
### BRENDAN HEALEY Senior staff writer 
While they may not lay down the law in L.A.,
the Stanford women do have a chance to make
history in the first-ever Pacific 10 Conference
women's swimming meet beginning today
with 11 a.m. preliminaries at the East Los An
geles Junior College pool in East Los Angeles.
The No. 2 Cardinal is the odds-on favorite to
win the first league crown over a loaded field
that includes four of the nation's top seven
teams and five of the top 10.
"I feel that Stanford is the favorite, and that
it should be a real close battle for second," USC
Coach Don LaMont said. "They're strong in
everything overall. Their strength is that they
have more depth."
Stanford was not challenged in compiling a
5-0 conference record and easily dismissed No.
5 UCLA 189-78 and No. 6 USC 97-43, which
will likely be its closest contenders, in earlier
deGuerre Pool matchups.
As UCLA Coach Tom Jahn said, "A team bat
tle for first would be more exciting, but realisti
cally that won't happen."
The fight for second should be between the
Bruins, Trojans, seventh-ranked California
and No. 10 Arizona State.
Stanford Coach George Haines sees the meet
as just another steppingstone on the way to
the NCAAs in late March.
"We still have a few people that have to make
(NCAA) cutoffs, that's what we're shooting

for." he said. "We're just going to rest up a little
this week. We need to get people qualified, and
this is the opportunity to do it. It's important
that we swim real well."
Several Stanford swimmers are within a
hairsbreadth of qualifying and will be looking
to add to the squad's total of 37 qualifying cuts
in preparation for an all-out assault on Texas
at the NCAAs. Those who have already hit all
their qualifying times began their NCAA train
ing tapers this week, while roughly eight
swimmers still looking for cuts went into a full
taper and have shaved for the competition.
Stanford freshman Susannah Miller noted
another advantage of the meet, which follows
the NCAA format of three days of morning
preliminaries and evening finals.
"It's sort of a dress rehearsal for NCAAs," she
said. "We're approaching it with a real positive
outlook. I don't know if our competition is so
much team-wise, but there are some good indi
viduals."
Perhaps the best individual race will be the
100-yard butterfly, where Stanford's Jenna
Johnson is expected to continue her rivalry
with California's Mary T. Meagher. Although
Johnson triumphed at last year's NCAAs with
an American record time, Meagher won the
pair's last meeting with a blazing final 25
yards that allowed her to edge Johnson and set
a record at Cal's Spieker Pool.
Stacy Shupe and the rest of the Cardinal's
distance freestyle corps will be challenged by

UCLA's Missy Herndon and USC's Kathy
Hettche and Leslie Daland. Hettche and
Daland both copped gold medals at last sum
mer's Goodwill Games, and Herndon easily
won the 1,000 freestyle when the Bruins
visited the Farm.
USC's Lisa Dorman in the sprint freestyles
and Anne Ottenbrite in the breaststroke will
also contend, while ASU's Beda Liervag will be
a factor in the individual medleys.
A controversy of sorts may be brewing this
weekend over a recent decision by the confer
ence to limit each team to 20 official swimmers
and four unofficial competitors for the meet.
While the ruling has little effect on Stanford,
which normally travels with 20 swimmers
anyway, LaMont is angry that he won't be able
to bring his full USC squad of 36.
"Twelve people will just be staying home." he
said. "All of the sudden with no time left, the
rug's just pulled out from underneath them.
To change the rules two weeks before (the
meet) and leave people out. 1 think is an in
justice. I'm very upset."
Nonetheless, LaMont said that he, like
Haines and Jahn, is happier to be in the Pac
-10, instead of the Pac-West Conference which
Stanford, USC and UCLA previously competed
in.
Oregon, which does not have a women's
swimming team, will be the only member of
the traditional men's Pac-10 that will go un
represented in East Los Angeles.
