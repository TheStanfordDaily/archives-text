## 
### EVAN TUCHINSKY Staff writer 
Tonight's meet in sunny
Arizona could be the light at the
end of an increasingly darkening
tunnel for the Stanford women's
gymnastics team. The Cardinal
will meet Arizona and Washing
ton. hoping to improve its perfor
mance and garner a much-needed
high team score.
The meet marks the first
meeting this year between the
19th-ranked Cardinal and the No.
4 Wildcats, who have posted a
high score this season of 185.15.
The Huskies, ranked No. 16. have
faced Stanford twice, earning

their season high 184.85 in the
teams' last confrontation.
"This weekend's going to be one
heck of a meet," Stanford Coach
Homer Sardina said. "We're going
against a team that's right now
the fourth- or third-best team in
the nation. If we're on our game,
we should be very competitive."
Along with the strong team
competition, the race for the
meet's individual all-around title
will be tight, as each team sports
high-scoring performers. Ariz
ona's Mary Kay Place, with a
season high of 38.00, will be a
tough competitor, as will team
mate Caroline Wood, who boasts a
37.70.

Washington has equally power
ful artillery in Yumi Mordre and
Wendy Gangwer. Mordre, an Ail-
American, leads the Huskies with
a 37.80, with Gangwer close be
hind at 37.70.
Stanford, however, should not
be discounted. Freshman Dina
Amoroso broke 37 for the first
time in her college career last
weekend, garnering a 37.15 at the
Hobee's Invitational. Senior Nanci
Goldsmith is second on the team
with a 36.65 season high and
sophomore Jinny Rhee is moving
steadily up into the 37 range as
well.
"Jinny's sneaking up there,"
Sardina said, adding that

Amoroso is "doing wonderfully."
as well.
Choreographer Nancy Roach's
input this week could prove to be
the needed ingredient for the
Cardinal. "Nancy was down here
working with us on beam and
floor," Sardina said. "This should
improve our presentation, and
hopefully we won't have any more
falls."
Falls coupled with illness were
the team's downfall last weekend
at California, and with Goldsmith,
Rhee and team captains Alison
McGann and Cheryl Doo all
recovering from colds, the Stan
ford gymnasts have a challenging
road ahead of them.
