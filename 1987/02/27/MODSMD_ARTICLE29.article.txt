# Cardinal skiers head for national championships
## 
### 
You can take home a final, but
how often will a final take you
home?
For senior Liz Atkinson, a
native of Colorado, the 1987
U.S. Collegiate Ski Champion
ships wil do just that.
The three-time All-America
will represent Stanford In
Crested Butte, along with the
Cardinal men's ski team March
2-5.
Getting there wasn't easy.
First, the Stanford men's 'A'
team, comprised of four fast
frosh, Bill Derwin, Chris Smith,
Robb Johnson and Scott Hall,
and two sophmores, Chip Haz
ard and Brad Swett. had to win
the Northern California league
title over California, Chico
State, UC-Davis, Fresno State.

Sacramento State and Sierra
College. Last weekend they
clinched It.
Atkinson, however, will be
racing as an Individual. (Last
year, the Cardinal women
earned a team berth at nation
als.) As the fastest woman in the
league, she earned a special invi
tation to the championships,
making this her fourth con
secutive appearance there.
This year's nationals may be
the end of Atkinson's collegiate
ski racing career, but for the six
Stanford men. it is just a begin
ning.
With no one graduating until
1989, men on the team an
ticipate at least two more trips
to the championships.
Their success this season

wasn't merely a product of youth
and raw talent. Cohesion has
been key. and in individual
sports, it sometimes comes
slowly.
In team racing, "You have to
suck up your pride and just
finish. You realize going to na
tionals (as a team) is more im
portant than winning a race (as
an individual)," Derwin said.
Hazard added that in the end.
"It's definitely been a team year.
When people have fallen, others
picked up the slack."
In Colorado, Hazard just
wants the team to "prove to the
country that we can do well com
ing from California and show
them that we do have a ski team
at Stanford."
