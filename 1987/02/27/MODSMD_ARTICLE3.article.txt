# New Davies suit will be tried soon

### CHRIS MYERS Editorial staff 
The amended suit filed Jan. 15 by former
visiting History Prof. Norman Davies against
the University and 37 other defendants will
likely come to trial in mid-March, according to
Pete McCloskey, Davies' attorney.
Davies, a tenured history professor at the
University of London, originally filed suit last
April 28 against Assoc. Histoiy Prof. Harold
Kahn and 30 unnamed defendants. That suit
claimed that Kahn and others in the History
Department had "conspired" to defame Davies
and deny him a permanent appointment to the
McDonnell Chair in East European History.
That suit was dismissed on a demurrer —
the court ruled that Kahn's remarks about
Davies' scholarship did not constitute slander.
The amended suit reiterates the claim of
defamation by Kahn and others in the History
Department, but also accuses the University of
"misrepresentation and fraud," "breach of
written contract" and discrimination "on the
basis of the plaintiffs creed."
"It's an entirely different issue," McCloskey

said of the new suit. "The question now is,
Has Stanford as an institution been fair to
Davies?' "
In January 1986, the History Department
voted against recommending Davies for the
endowed chair, which has been vacant since
1978. The vote, which was 12-11 with one
abstention, went against a unanimous recom
mendation of Davies by a departmental search
committee assigned the ta«.k of filling the
McDonnell chair.
The new suit, which asks for $9 million in
damages, names the University as a defen
dant, along with history professors Peter
Stansky, Paul Robinson and Alexander Dallin,
then-Provost and current acting President
James Rosse, University Vice President and
General Counsel John Schwartz. Staff Counsel
Iris Brest, graduate student Jon Adelstein and
29 unnamed defendants.
The University has until March 6 to submit a
written answer to the claims issued by Davies.
Schwartz, who is representing all the defen
dants in the case, "couldn't say" yesterday
whether the University would request another
demurrer on parts or all of the new suit. He

said, however, that the court would probably
rule no cause of action again on those parts of
the amended suit which overlap the original
claim.
The bulk of the new suit, however, differs
from the original claim. The emphasis in the
new suit is that Davies was discriminated
against because of his political and religious
beliefs. In a letter sent to Davies last March ex
plaining 1a"!u "jection. Rosse said that mem
bers of the department, in discussing Davies
book "God's Playground: A History of Poland,"
found the book's treatment of Jews in Poland
as "not only insensitive, but unacceptably de
fensive of the behavior of the Poles."
According to Paul Robinson, who was then
chairman of the History Department, "no one
suggested that [Davies] or ["God's Playground")
was anti-Semitic," but that the chapter of
"God's Playground" that dealt with Jews "was
considered emblematic of a general concern
about lack of objectivity" in Davies' scholar
ship, Rosse stated in the letter.
Davies, however, claims in the amended suit
that Kahn, Stansky and other his
tory professors "concealed their
political bias against |Davies]" and
"made false and derogatory state
ments" that "carried the in
nuendo that the plaintiff and his
teachings were anti-Semitic."
In the amended suit, Davies also
quotes various history professors
who, he alleges, called the state
ments by Kahn and others "a
'political' attack on" Davies, an
"organized conspiracy against"
Davies and "factually wrong or
misguided."
Davies also claims in the
amended suit that the University
violated terms of the written con
tract, entered into in April 1985,
under which he agreed to come to
Stanford as a visiting professor
during the 1985-1986 school year.

Last August, a Santa Clara
County Superior Court judge
ruled that Davies had no cause for
action In the suit against Kahn
and the other defendants. The
judge ruled that the "alleged
defamatory statement" was a
statement of opinion, and thus
could not serve as the basis for a
defamation claim. The ruling,
however, granted Davies the right
to take a limited deposition from
Kahn, and left Davies the chance
to amend his suit.
Kahn appealed the deposition
ruling, and on Jan. 9, a California
appellate court unanimously up
held Kahn's right to privacy. The
court wrote that "the right of a fac
ulty member to discuss with his
colleagues the candidate's
qualifications thoroughly and
candidly, in confidence and with
out fear of compelled disclosure, is
of such paramount value that It
ought not to be impaired."

who, he alleges, called the state
ments by Kahn and others "a
'political' attack on" Davies, an
"organized conspiracy against"
Davies and "factually wrong or
misguided."
Davies also claims in the
amended suit that the University
violated terms of the written con
tract, entered into in April 1985,
under which he agreed to come to
Stanford as a visiting professor
during the 1985-1986 school year.

Last August, a Santa Clara
County Superior Court judge
ruled that Davies had no cause for
action In the suit against Kahn
and the other defendants. The
judge ruled that the "alleged
defamatory statement" was a
statement of opinion, and thus
could not serve as the basis for a
defamation claim. The ruling,
however, granted Davies the right
to take a limited deposition from
Kahn, and left Davies the chance
to amend his suit.
Kahn appealed the deposition
ruling, and on Jan. 9, a California
appellate court unanimously up
held Kahn's right to privacy. The
court wrote that "the right of a fac
ulty member to discuss with his
colleagues the candidate's
qualifications thoroughly and
candidly, in confidence and with
out fear of compelled disclosure, is
of such paramount value that It
ought not to be impaired."
