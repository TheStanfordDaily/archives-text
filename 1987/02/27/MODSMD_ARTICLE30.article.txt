# Fencers host regional
## Stanford women look for fourth straight title 
### CHRIS CRADER Staff writer 
The Stanford women's fencing team has spent the
entire year demonstrating that it is the best team in
the West, but it now has to start all over again. The
Western Regional Championships are being held all
day tomorrow and Sunday at Roble Gym and Stan
ford now must prove itself when it matters most.
The team competition will go from 9 a.m. tomor
row to about 7 p.m., while the individual honors will
be determined Sunday between 9 a.m. and 3 p.m.
The Cardinal, which finished its regular season at
12-3, must be considered the favorite on the basis of
past experience alone. Stanford has won the regional
title three years in a row and has also finished in the
top 10 nationally in each of those years.
Stanford is again loaded with talent this year, and
has already defeated its two top rivals, UC-Santa
Cruz and Air Force. The Banana Slugs fell 10-6 In
November and again three weeks ago, 9-7. The Card
inal beat the Falcons last month by the same 9-7
margin.
Also competing are Fullerton State (which lost to
Stanford, 13-3, in January), Long Beach State and
UC-San Diego (neither of which the Cardinal has

faced this year).
According to Stanford Coach Buzz Hurst."We have
seen and competed against the significant teams in
the West and ... we beat the best."
The top two teams will advance to NCAA cham
pionships March 19-21 at Notre Dame.
Stanford looks to do just as well in the individual
tournament. The favorite would have to be Stanford
senior Holly Taylor, who Is 55-5 on the year. Taylor
has not lost In her last 27 bouts, and is 16-0 against
the schools that will be competing in the regional.
Taylor isn't the only Cardinal fencer with a chance
to qualify for the nationals, though. Senior Alyson
Yarus has posted a 40-19 record this season, and is
13-3 in the region.
"Alyson Yarus has been a surprise this year," said
Hurst. "I see her as having an excellent chance at
making the final eight in the regionals."
Also expected to compete for the Cardinal will be
junior Tracy Schmidt, who is 20-13 this season. She
missed Stanford's most recent outing, a 9-7 win at
California, due to an injured ankle, but she said she
doesn't think it will stop her.
Rounding out the lineup for the team competition
will be either freshman Elisabeth Spilman (19-20) or
senior Alexandra Rankin (16-23).
