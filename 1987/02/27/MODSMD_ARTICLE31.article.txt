### JON WEISMAN Staff writer 
This weekend at the 98th an
nual Pacific Coast Men's
Doubles Tennis Championships
in La Jolla, the Stanford men's
tennis team will get to work on a
team weakness, doubles play, in
a competitive situation, without
the pressure of it counting in
the standings.
The Pacific Coast Doubles is
one of the longest-running ten
nis tournaments in the world. It
is an open tournament — top
collegiate and independent
teams will be represented.

tournament." Stanford Coach
Dick Gould said. "It's just a good
chance to work on doubles,
which we need."
The Cardinal. 3-5 overall in
cluding a four-match losing
streak, has a record of 13-17 in
doubles this season. Gould will
use the tournament to continue
to experiment with different
combinations.
