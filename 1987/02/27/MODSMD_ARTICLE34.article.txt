# Gymnasts face Fullerton

### MARK SMOYER Staff writer 
"Whoever comes to this meet
will see the top gymnastics com
petition in the world."
It's quiz time. Daily readers.
The above quote applies to
which gymnastics meet taking
place tonight?
A) The Chinese National Cham
pionships in Beijing
B) The USA-USSR competition
in Duluth, Minnesota
C) The Santa Clara County High
School Championships at Palo
Alto
D) none of the above.
The answer is 'D,' and the
man quoted is Stanford Coach
Sadao Hamada, who was refer
ring to this evening's men's
gymnastics competition at 7:30
on the floor of Maples Pavilion
between the Cardinal and Cal
State-Fullerton. Hamada was

not saying that the meet will be
of a caliber no other competition
could match, he simply meant
that many of the routines per
formed tonight will be
demonstrating the highest level
gymnastics anyone could see
anywhere.
This level will be most often
demonstrated by Fullerton's
standout Li Xiao Ping. Xiao Ping
was a member of China's 1984
Olympic team and is averaging
9.85 on the pommel horse, an
event in which he is a former
world champion. When these
same two teams met last Sun
day. Xiao Ping averaged 9.75 on
the four events in which he com
peted.
In that meet, at Fullerton,
both teams performed well, but
with the No. 3 Titans on a hot
streak and with No. 18 Stanford
still recovering from a variety of
setbacks, Fullerton won 281.5
to 271.75. This week, with the

Cardinal almost completely
healthy and the inspiration of
the national championships
only five meets away, Hamada
expects the race to be closer.
"If we want to go to the
NCAAs. we have to score high in
the remaining meets," Hamada
said. "The guys realize this and
they are a lot more psyched for
this meet. Plus we've had a real
good week of training, so we'll
see what happens."
Another factor, of course, is
that Stanford will be at home
this week. For the Cardinal, it is
only the second home meet of
the season. Maples will be the
site of only one meet after this,
but it is a big, or, rather, the big
meet for Stanford this winter. It
is the Pacific 10 Conference
Championships, at which the
Cardinal must be in top form in
order to gain a third consecutive
NCAA berth.
