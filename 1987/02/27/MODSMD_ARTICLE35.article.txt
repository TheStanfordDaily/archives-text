They won't keep score and it won't affect any
standings. Nonetheless, this weekend's third annual
San Jose State Relays, the first outdoor competition
for most Northern California track teams, promises
to be exciting.
Opening their season along with the Cardinal will
be 10 other regional teams, as well as two interna
tional ones, as squads from West Germany and
Japan are expected to take part in the all-day event.
For Stanford, the meet will be the first opportunity
of the season to run outdoors. With the team's
season opener still two weeks away, the coaching
staff won't be taking any chances, preferring instead
to rest the team's injured athletes and to run most of
the healthy ones in just one event.
"It's similar to the basketball team playing the
Australian national team in a non-counting game,"
Stanford Asst. Coach Scott Chisam said. "We prob
ably won't look like we're setting the world on fire,
but I'd rather place well at NCAAs than the San Jose
State Relays."
Led by shot-putters Patty Purpur, a recent
qualifier for the NCAA indoor championships, and
Andy Papathanassiou. field events competitors will
make up the brunt of the Cardinal contingent. In ad
dition to the shot, Stanford will have entries in the
long, triple and high jumps, the discus, the hammer.

the javelin and the pole vault.
In the running events, key performers for the
women will be distance runners Carol Gray and
Brenda Steenhof In the 3000 meter race. For the
men. the sprint relay of Brian Small, James Browne,
Danny Vigil and Gus Envela should be one to watch.
According to Chisam, this year's group ol sprinters
may be the Cardinal's best since the relay team
James Lofton led to a school record.
The Cardinal, however, will be without the services
of senior Brian Connoly and Head Coach Brooks
Johnson. Connoly, along with coterminal student
Pam Dukes — who has used up her outdoor
eligibility — will be competing in tonights lAC In
door Championships in New York's Madison Square
Garden.
Connoly will race in the 800, while Dukes will take
part in her speciality, the shot put.
The indoor meet's top two finishers in each event
will qualify for the World Indoor Championships to
be held in Poland. For Dukes especially, the chances
look good as the graduate student is currently
ranked second In the country, behind national
record-holder Ramona Pagel.
Also missing this weekend for Stanford will be
junior Lisa Bernhagen, who last week in Arizona set
a national college record in the high jump with a
mark of 6-foot-5 and 1/2. After such a remarkable
preseason performance, Bernhagen has the option of
choosing her meets carefully-
