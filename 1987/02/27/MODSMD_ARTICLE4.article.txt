# Stanford grape boycott draws criticism of state
## 
### CHRIS MARIO 
Campus Chicano organizations are cur
rently organizing a boycott of California
grapes, which they claim are contaminated
with pesticides, but which state officials
say are not a potential health hazard to
grape pickers or consumers.
The Stanford chapter of MEChA, a Cali
fornia Mexican American student advocacy
group, announced the boycott in a letter to
The Daily Wednesday as part of a
nationwide boycott of California grapes led
by Cesar Chavez of the United Farm
Workers (UFW) union. The UFW claims that
pesticides commonly used by grape growers
cause cancer, birth defects and death
among California grape pickers, the
majority of whom are Mexican Americans,
according to freshman Rebecca Flores, an
organizer of the campus boycott effort.
But according to Julio Calderon of the
state's Pesticide Management Division in
Sacramento, boycott efforts against Califor
nia produce are misguided.
"California consumers and farm workers
are the safest and most protected in the
world," Calderon said. "California has the
most stringent regulations dealing with the
registration of pesticides and the methods
of their use of any state or country. Not even
the federal government matches our
regulatory process. And in terms of pes
ticide residue on the produce, our regula
tions are so tough that we turn away
produce from other states at our borders.
The two pesticides Flores wants banned

are Captan and Dinosab. "These pesticides
are a risk to everyone, including consu
mers. because the pesticides cannot be
washed off, and also get into the ground
water and the food chain when used at the
farms. This pesticide stuff is rampant."
Calderon said, however, that Dinosab has
already been banned in California, as well
as in every other state in the country. He
added that Captan is a fumigant applied di
rectly to the soil before the growing season,
and it never comes in contact with farm
workers and does not enter the plants or
the grapes. Charges of harm caused by Cap
tan are currently under investigation, Cal
deron said.
"The UFW has its own interests to
promote, and the best way to get public at
tention is to attack people's sense of fear of
being poisoned by their food."
Yet the UFW claims in its publications
that agribusiness interests close to Gov.
George Deukmejian have effectively
thwarted state government efforts to regu
late pesticide use.
The Kairos co-op has already joined the
boycott on campus, and MEChA hopes to
garner further campus support at the
eating clubs and University Food Service
through a letter-writing campaign. It has
been endorsed by the Stanford Student
Labor Support Committee, El Centro
Chicano and the Zapata Boycott Commit
tee, which is based in the Casa Zapata dor
mitory in Stern Hall. The boycott effort will
continue. Flores said, until "some change"
in farm policy occurs.
