# Medical Center cleared in suit
## 
### TRACIE THOMPSON Staff writer 
A San Jose Superior Court jury
determined yesterday that doctors
at Stanford University Medical
Center were not responsible for
the untimely death of a man with
a brain tumor, despite an ad
mitted administrative error in the
hospital's treatment of the pa
tient.
The malpractice lawsuit was
filed by the family of Walter Cle
ments, a Belmont flight engineer
who died Dec. 5, 1983 of an
astrocytoma in the left frontal lobe
of his brain. The attorney re
presenting the Clements family
asked for #350,000 in damages,
arguing that a number of Stan
ford doctors had failed to diagnose
and treat the patient's "lemon
sized" tumor.
But the jury was not convinced
that Stanford Hospital was to
blame for Clements' death, and
granted no damages to the family.
According to Socrates Man
oukian, the attorney representing
Stanford's insurance carriers,
"the jury felt that the care at Stan
ford was very good."
According to Manoukian, the
Clements family could appeal the
jury's decision to a higher court.
The Clements family attorney,
Bruce Bailey, could not be reached
for comment.
Manoukian said he had ac
knowledged early on in the trial
that the hospital had been
negligent in allowing a six-week
delay in notifying Clements that
his CT-scan had indicated a brain
tumor. A CT-scan is a X-ray proce
dure that produces a three
dimensional image of any internal
organ, such as the brain.
The jury was convinced that no
damage had been caused by the
delay, Manoukian said, because
the type of tumor Clements had is
always fatal.
Manoukian said that the sur
geon who operated on Clements at
Sequoia Hospital in San Jose also
testified that the tumor his pa
tient had was incurable. People
who have this type of tumor,
Manoukian added, "have an
average life expectancy of 40
weeks after surgery."
The jury was particularly im
pressed, Manoukian said, by the
testimony of Stanford's Dr. Dieter

Enzmann. Manoukian described
the physician as a "world-class
radiologist."
The family had turned down a
*60,000 settlement offer from
Stanford prior to the start of the
10-day trial, Manoukian said.
Having lost the lawsuit, the fam
ily will now be responsible for
court costs that Manoukian esti
mated would run around *3,000.
They will not have to pay for the
cost of Stanford's legal representa
tion.
Clements first saw doctors at
Stanford on April 15, 1982, his at
torney Bruce Bailey said last week.
He had suffered a seizure a month
earlier in Saudi Arabia, where he
was working for the Federal Avia
tion Administration (FAA).
After a Saudi Arabian CT-scan
failed to show any abnormalities
in Clement's brain, FAA officials
advised him to get a follow-up
diagnosis at the Mayo Clinic in
Rochester, Minn, or at Stanford,
Bailey said.
The Stanford neurology resi
dent who first saw Clements
stated in his report that the cause
of the seizure could not be
diagnosed, according to Bailey, al
though he did note a brain tumor
as a possibility.
One month later, while in
France, Clements suffered an
other seizure. Doctors at the Uni
versity of Lille, who reviewed the
Saudi Arabian X-rays after the
second seizure, told Clements that
an abnormality in his brain was
evident and suggested that he
return to Stanford for further ex
amination, Bailey said.
Clements went to Stanford
Hospital a second time on July 8,
1982. He had a second CT-scan,
which was processed five days
later and showed a large brain
tumor.
Stanford did not notify Cle
ments of the test results until Au
gust 26, 1982. Manoukian blamed
the follow-up failure on an admin
istrative error, caused by the
departure from Stanford of the
resident who treated Clements
during his second visit.
A few weeks later, after switch
ing doctors, Clements was ad
mitted to Sequoia Hospital in San
Jose, where "most of the left part
of his brain" was removed in an
operation, Bailey said.
