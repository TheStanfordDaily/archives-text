on the streets of Moscow," said Rabbi Ari Cartun of

Jewry.
In front of the Claw on the steps leading to Old Un
ion, several students read lists of persecuted Jews
and spoke against Soviet oppression of refusniks.
Dressed in black ana white striped jail costumes,
students paraded signs reading "Stop Soviet cultural
genocide," "I am my brother's keeper" and "Let my
people go."
Sponsored by the Stanford Hillel Jewry Commit
tee, the rally was intended to bring about greater
awareness of the plight of Soviet Jews. The commit
tee has adopted two college-age refusniks in the
USSR to whom they send cards and letters. Junior

refuseniks. noting that it "may save their lives."
Schechter co-chaired the committee with Judith
Eisenberg and Josh Lipp.
Cartun. who visited the Soviet Union in the sum
mer of 1985, defined a refusnik as "someone who
has applied for an exit visa and is refused." He said
that currently 400,000 of about 2 million Jews are
waiting for visas. During his trip to Odessa,
Leningrad, Kharkov. Kiev and Moscow, Cartun met
with the wives and children of many imprisoned
Jews.
Several such Jews have been sentenced to years in
