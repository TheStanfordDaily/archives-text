Tower commission releases report
WASHINGTON — The Tower commission. In a searing indict
ment of President Reagan's conduct of national security affairs,
criticized the president and some of his top aides yesterday for
making serious mistakes in selling arms to Iran and diverting
profits to the Nicaraguan contras.
The commission, which Reagan himself appointed last Novem
ber. concentrated Its lire on the president's top aides, accusing
several of them of concealing evidence from Investigators.
The 287-page report faulted White House chief of staff Donald
Regan. Secretary of State George Shultz, Secretary of Defense
Caspar Weinberger and former CIA Director William Casey for
failing to keep (he president fully informed of the potential conse
quences of his controversial policy of selling arms to Iran.
"I believe that the president was poorly advised and poorly
served.'' former Sen. John Tower, the commission's chairman,
told a press conference after delivering the report to Reagan.
But Tower did not exonerate the president. "I think that he
should have followed up more and monitored this operation more
closely." he said. "I think he was not aware of a lot of the things
that were going on and the way the operation was structured and
who was involved in 11. He very clearly didn't understand all that."
Reagan himself, the commission concluded, "did not intend to
mislead the American public or cover up unlawful conduct," al
though he made a number of inaccurate public statements about
the scandal that has rocked his administration.
Despite the president's insistence that the Iran arms sales were
designed to gain favor with moderate Iranian political leaders, the
commission Insisted the real purpose was to buy freedom for
American hostages held by Iran-backed terrorists in Lebanon.
The president refrained from issuing any immediate comment
on the report.
Appearing ill-at-ease and stumbling over the words he read In a
statement at the start of a news conference held by the three com
mission members, Reagan said: "I want to make it clear that I con
sider their work far too important for instant analysis. I intend to
read and digest it first, think carefully about its findings, and
promptly act on its recommendations."
Reagan was given the report in a meeting with the three com
mission members: Tower. Edmund Muskie, a former Democratic
senator from Maine and secretary of state during the final year of
the Jimmy Carter administration, and retired Air Force Lt. Gen.
Brent Scowcroft. President Gerald Ford's assistant for national se
curity affairs.
Although the commission made no startling new disclosures, it
added rich detail to what was already known about the Reagan ad
ministration's most serious crisis:
I ] The president himself, the commission disclosed, actively aided
the effort to raise money for the contras when Congress had
barred military aid.
□ The point man for that effort. Lt. Col. Oliver North, who was
fired from the White House National Security Council staff last No
vember. directed a cloak-and-dagger effort that consumed mil
lions of dollars.
I I When the Iran arms sales became public last November. North
and his boss, former presidential national security adviser John
Polndexter, stage-managed an effort to cover up what had hap
pened.
Although Tower told reporters that the episode was woefully
short of heroes, the commission found no cause to blame Vice
President George Bush. And It said chief of staff Regan remained
largely ignorant of many of the operations conducted by North.
On the crucial question of whether Reagan orally approved the
tirst shipment of arms to Iran by Israel in August 1985, the com
mission said that on balance. "It Is plausible to believe that he did
approve them in advance."
The Issue Is Important because it involves possible illegalities
and conflicting statements to the commission by the president.
The president first told the commission that he had approved the
shipment, but later, after conferring with Regan, concluded that
he had not.
As recently as Feb. 20, the report disclosed, Reagan wrote a
poignant letter to the commission saying that he had let himself
"be influenced by others' recollections, not my own." and"the
simple truth is, I don't remember — period."
Reagan's aides also disagreed. Robert McFarlane, who was
Reagan's national security adviser at the time, told the commis
sion that Reagan had approved the sale. But Regan testified that
he had not.
Even if the president orally approved the sale, the commission
reported, "a serious question of law remains" because several
statutes require written approval.
Congress reacts to Tower report
WASHINGTON — Release of the Tower commission report yes
terday brought demands from both parties in Congress that Presi
dent Reagan change the hands-off approach to governing that has
been the hallmark of his presidency.
Although there was no indication that Reagan broke the law.
"colossal blunders were made," Senate Republican Leader Bob
Dole. R-Kan., said, lie added that "we need to tighten things up at
the While House. . . . Maybe the president isn't concerned
enough" about the details of establishing his policies. "He's more
of a conceptual leader."
Sen. Edward Kennedy, D-Mass., was more blunt, declaring:
"For too long, on too many vital Issues in foreign policy and na
tional defense, we seem to have had a commander-in-chief who
has been AWOL."
Lawmakers also laid blame on White I louse chief of staff I )onald
Regan, who has exercised control over almost every facet of White
House operations, and many said It was time he resigned.
"Mr. Regan should make It easier, if you will, on the presi
dent . . . II I were in Mr. Regan's shoes. I would tender my resig
nation." Rep. Dick Cheney, R-Wyo., said. In fact, Cheney, who
now Is the top-ranking Republican on the House panel Investigat
ing the Iran-contra affair, has been in those shoes, having served
as White House chief of staff under former President Ford.
Cheney also warned that if the president failed to heed the
recommendations of the commission to provide more effective
leadership for his stall on important issues, "there is every reason
to expect the last two years of the administration will be very un
productive and very frustrating, not only for the president, but for
those of us who support him."
Soviets resume nuclear testing
MOSCOW The Soviet Union, announcing its resumption of
nuclear tests after a 19-month moratorium, said yesterday that
the explosion was not the first In a series and was not aimed at
perfecting a new nuclear weapon.
A Defense Ministry spokesman. Maj. Gen. Gely Batenin. said,
"Only a minimum number of tests will be conducted with the pur
pose of developing munitions for maintaining strategic parity
with the United States in nuclear armaments."
The underground blast occurred at the Semlpalatlnsk test
range In Soviet Central Asia at 8 a.m. yesterday. Moscow time,
with a yield of less than 20 kllotons, the official news agency lass
said
Alter the unilateral moratorium, which the Kremlin declared In
a futile attempt to stop U.S. nuclear testing, the Soviet Union was
forced to resume testing to preserve military parity In view ol con
tinued American nuclear tests. Batenin said at a press briefing.
"An historic chance lor ending nuclear tests once and for all has
been missed at tills stage." the general said
"The situation makes It necessary for us to do what we don't
want to do." Batenin continued.

and conflicting statements to the commission by the president.
The president first told the commission that he had approved the
shipment, but later, after conferring with Regan, concluded that
he had not.
As recently as Feb. 20, the report disclosed, Reagan wrote a
poignant letter to the commission saying that he had let himself
"be influenced by others' recollections, not my own." and"the
simple truth is, I don't remember — period."
Reagan's aides also disagreed. Robert McFarlane, who was
Reagan's national security adviser at the time, told the commis
sion that Reagan had approved the sale. But Regan testified that
he had not.
Even if the president orally approved the sale, the commission
reported, "a serious question of law remains" because several
statutes require written approval.
Congress reacts to Tower report
WASHINGTON — Release of the Tower commission report yes
terday brought demands from both parties in Congress that Presi
dent Reagan change the hands-off approach to governing that has
been the hallmark of his presidency.
Although there was no indication that Reagan broke the law.
"colossal blunders were made," Senate Republican Leader Bob
Dole. R-Kan., said, lie added that "we need to tighten things up at
the While House. . . . Maybe the president isn't concerned
enough" about the details of establishing his policies. "He's more
of a conceptual leader."
Sen. Edward Kennedy, D-Mass., was more blunt, declaring:
"For too long, on too many vital Issues in foreign policy and na
tional defense, we seem to have had a commander-in-chief who
has been AWOL."
Lawmakers also laid blame on White I louse chief of staff I )onald
Regan, who has exercised control over almost every facet of White
House operations, and many said It was time he resigned.
"Mr. Regan should make It easier, if you will, on the presi
dent . . . II I were in Mr. Regan's shoes. I would tender my resig
nation." Rep. Dick Cheney, R-Wyo., said. In fact, Cheney, who
now Is the top-ranking Republican on the House panel Investigat
ing the Iran-contra affair, has been in those shoes, having served
as White House chief of staff under former President Ford.
Cheney also warned that if the president failed to heed the
recommendations of the commission to provide more effective
leadership for his stall on important issues, "there is every reason
to expect the last two years of the administration will be very un
productive and very frustrating, not only for the president, but for
those of us who support him."

range In Soviet Central Asia at 8 a.m. yesterday. Moscow time,
with a yield of less than 20 kllotons, the official news agency lass

a futile attempt to stop U.S. nuclear testing, the Soviet Union was
forced to resume testing to preserve military parity In view ol con
tinued American nuclear tests. Batenin said at a press briefing.
"An historic chance lor ending nuclear tests once and for all has
been missed at tills stage." the general said
"The situation makes It necessary for us to do what we don't
want to do." Batenin continued.

Tower commission releases report
WASHINGTON — The Tower commission. In a searing indict
ment of President Reagan's conduct of national security affairs,
criticized the president and some of his top aides yesterday for
making serious mistakes in selling arms to Iran and diverting
profits to the Nicaraguan contras.
The commission, which Reagan himself appointed last Novem
ber. concentrated Its lire on the president's top aides, accusing
several of them of concealing evidence from Investigators.
The 287-page report faulted White House chief of staff Donald
Regan. Secretary of State George Shultz, Secretary of Defense
Caspar Weinberger and former CIA Director William Casey for
failing to keep (he president fully informed of the potential conse
quences of his controversial policy of selling arms to Iran.
"I believe that the president was poorly advised and poorly
served.'' former Sen. John Tower, the commission's chairman,
told a press conference after delivering the report to Reagan.
But Tower did not exonerate the president. "I think that he
should have followed up more and monitored this operation more
closely." he said. "I think he was not aware of a lot of the things
that were going on and the way the operation was structured and
who was involved in 11. He very clearly didn't understand all that."
Reagan himself, the commission concluded, "did not intend to
mislead the American public or cover up unlawful conduct," al
though he made a number of inaccurate public statements about
the scandal that has rocked his administration.
Despite the president's insistence that the Iran arms sales were
designed to gain favor with moderate Iranian political leaders, the
commission Insisted the real purpose was to buy freedom for
American hostages held by Iran-backed terrorists in Lebanon.
The president refrained from issuing any immediate comment
on the report.
Appearing ill-at-ease and stumbling over the words he read In a
statement at the start of a news conference held by the three com
mission members, Reagan said: "I want to make it clear that I con
sider their work far too important for instant analysis. I intend to
read and digest it first, think carefully about its findings, and
promptly act on its recommendations."
Reagan was given the report in a meeting with the three com
mission members: Tower. Edmund Muskie, a former Democratic
senator from Maine and secretary of state during the final year of
the Jimmy Carter administration, and retired Air Force Lt. Gen.
Brent Scowcroft. President Gerald Ford's assistant for national se
curity affairs.
Although the commission made no startling new disclosures, it
added rich detail to what was already known about the Reagan ad
ministration's most serious crisis:
I ] The president himself, the commission disclosed, actively aided
the effort to raise money for the contras when Congress had
barred military aid.
□ The point man for that effort. Lt. Col. Oliver North, who was
fired from the White House National Security Council staff last No
vember. directed a cloak-and-dagger effort that consumed mil
lions of dollars.
I I When the Iran arms sales became public last November. North
and his boss, former presidential national security adviser John
Polndexter, stage-managed an effort to cover up what had hap
pened.
Although Tower told reporters that the episode was woefully
short of heroes, the commission found no cause to blame Vice
President George Bush. And It said chief of staff Regan remained
largely ignorant of many of the operations conducted by North.
On the crucial question of whether Reagan orally approved the
tirst shipment of arms to Iran by Israel in August 1985, the com
mission said that on balance. "It Is plausible to believe that he did
approve them in advance."
