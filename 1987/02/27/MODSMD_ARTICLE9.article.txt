### SUHA JHAVERI 
Cardinal Sin. a student-run pub. reopened
permanently last week after solving man
agerial and organizational problems, accord
ing to pub representatives.
The pub. located at Eucina Station, opened
on a trial basis during fall quarter. Positive
public response encouraged the Graduate Stu
dent Association (GSA), the organization re
sponsible for establishing Cardinal Sin, to
keep the pub open, according to GSA president
Michael Green.
The main delay in reopening the pub was the
need for a new manager. Green said. Sparky
Campanella, a student at I lie Graduate School
ol Business, volunteered to manage the pub
until the end of the quarter.
Green said the GSA will do what it can to
support the pub. "We'll be helping out by hold

ing GSA events there, as well as doing
publicity. We need to support it to get il ac
cepted on campus." he added.
Reopening was also hampered by numerous
organizational technicalities. "We had it or
ganized for a six-day period, so to be perman
cut we had to make some changes." Green
said.
"Operational procedures were not too good
the first time around. Now that we have
worked out the glitches, it will be even more
successful than during the (rial period." added
Nanci Howe, assistant director of Tresidder
Union, who serves as a Tresidder liaison to the
pub.
Other delays included determining the pub's
financial situation, hiring employees and
buying new equipment. Also, the GSA needed
time to react to student complaints voiced in
trial period surveys.

"The main complaint indicated by the sur
veys was Eucina Station itsell. said Vip lolat.

we had to learn how to get around that.
