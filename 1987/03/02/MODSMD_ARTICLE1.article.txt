Academic placement of Stanford
students receiving doctorates In
creased dramatically last year
from figures for the previous de
cade, according to a new study by
the Graduate Studies office.
Almost nine out of 10 students
receiving doctorates in 1985-86 —
88 percent — are working in fields
related to their specialty, the
study shows. This figure includes
those working In temporary jobs
(non-tenure track) and expected
permanent positions (tenure
track) at universities, as well as
those in jobs outside of academia
in other organizations closely tied
to their field of study, according to
Elizabeth Traugott, vice provost
and dean of Graduate Studies.
The 1985-86 figure, compiled
from Graduate Studies data, is up
from the 80 percent recorded by a
similar survey measuring place
ments in the academic field be
tween 1974 and 1984.
The new study also shows that
only nine of last year's 535 doc
toral recipients have left their
fields of study. Nine others —
three percent of those surveyed —
reported themselves as un
employed, half the figure from the
past 10 years.
"The problem of unemployment
is very minor," Traugott said.
"Obviously, this looks very good
for Stanford."
Both the hi'manities and social
sciences posted gains in the
proportion of those receiving doc
torates who are working in aca
demic jobs. Between 1974 and
1984, 66 percent of those earning
doctorates in the humanities con
tinued on to a university position
In their field. Last year that num
ber rose to 71 percent.
