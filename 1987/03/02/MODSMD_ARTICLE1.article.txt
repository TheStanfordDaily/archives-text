Academic placement of Stanford
students receiving doctorates In
creased dramatically last year
from figures for the previous de
cade, according to a new study by
the Graduate Studies office.
Almost nine out of 10 students
receiving doctorates in 1985-86 —
88 percent — are working in fields
related to their specialty, the
study shows. This figure includes
those working In temporary jobs
(non-tenure track) and expected
permanent positions (tenure
track) at universities, as well as
those in jobs outside of academia
in other organizations closely tied
to their field of study, according to
Elizabeth Traugott, vice provost
and dean of Graduate Studies.
The 1985-86 figure, compiled
from Graduate Studies data, is up
from the 80 percent recorded by a
similar survey measuring place
ments in the academic field be
tween 1974 and 1984.
The new study also shows that
only nine of last year's 535 doc
toral recipients have left their
fields of study. Nine others —
three percent of those surveyed —
reported themselves as un
employed, half the figure from the
past 10 years.
"The problem of unemployment
is very minor," Traugott said.
"Obviously, this looks very good
for Stanford."
Both the hi'manities and social
sciences posted gains in the
proportion of those receiving doc
torates who are working in aca
demic jobs. Between 1974 and
1984, 66 percent of those earning
doctorates in the humanities con
tinued on to a university position
In their field. Last year that num
ber rose to 71 percent.
For those receiving doctorates
in the social sciences, the number
jumped from 54 to 61 percent, ac
cording to the study.
Similar increases result when
Including those receiving doc
torates who are working in non
academic positions within their
field of study, according to the
study. Compared with the past 10
years, the number of those in aca
demic jobs — plus those In other
jobs related to their field of
graduate study — rose from 76 to
83 percent. Figures for the social
sciences increased from 79 to 96
percent.
"The humanities have really im
proved enormously," Traugott
said. She did note, however, that
comparing these figures with
those of other universities' doc
toral programs is difficult since
national surveys do not include
the figures for related jobs.
In the sciences, however, 12
percent of those receiving doc
torates in 1985-86 are in either
tenure track or non-track posi
tions, the study shows. For the
previous decade, that figure was
36 percent.
Traugott attributed the
decrease to the lucrative job mar
ket outside the realm of academia.
"There are some very exciting re
search possibilities outside
academia, as well as some high
paying jobs," she said.
Including both those who work
in their fields of specialty and
those in academic positions, the
number of students receiving doc

torates in the sciences ballooned
up to 84 percent, according to the
study. Between 1974 and 1984
the figure was 82 percent.
While it is difficult to compare
Stanford's results with those of
other universities, Traugott said
she was very enthusiastic about
the results.
"Stanford is doing extremely
well. We have some of the best stu
dents in the country," she said.
"Stanford's doctoral students con
tinue to make national and inter
national contributions in the
fields in which they were trained."
Traugott cited an improved pool
of students and a better Job mar
ket as two reasons for the increase
in academic placement of Stan
ford students receiving doc
torates.
"Over the last few years, we've
been getting better graduate stu
dents in many areas." she said.
Traugott said she hopes the
study's optimistic news will at
tract more graduate students to
Stanford's program and
"academia in general."
In addition, changes in manda
tory retirement laws that went
into effect several years ago are
now opening up more positions
for those receiving doctorates
today. Traugott said.
"By 1991. the job market is
going to be much more open," she
said.
The new study will be very use
ful to the Graduate Studies office,
Traugott said. "We are very inter
ested in keeping track of our stu
dents to find out where they go,"
she said.
Traugott said she expects the
lack of interest in graduate school
by undergraduates to change.

study. Between 1974 and 1984
the figure was 82 percent.
While it is difficult to compare
Stanford's results with those of
other universities, Traugott said
she was very enthusiastic about
the results.
"Stanford is doing extremely
well. We have some of the best stu
dents in the country," she said.
"Stanford's doctoral students con
tinue to make national and inter
national contributions in the
fields in which they were trained."
Traugott cited an improved pool
of students and a better Job mar
ket as two reasons for the increase
in academic placement of Stan
ford students receiving doc
torates.
"Over the last few years, we've
been getting better graduate stu
dents in many areas." she said.
Traugott said she hopes the
study's optimistic news will at
tract more graduate students to
Stanford's program and
"academia in general."
In addition, changes in manda
tory retirement laws that went
into effect several years ago are
now opening up more positions
for those receiving doctorates
today. Traugott said.
"By 1991. the job market is
going to be much more open," she
said.
The new study will be very use
ful to the Graduate Studies office,
Traugott said. "We are very inter
ested in keeping track of our stu
dents to find out where they go,"
she said.
Traugott said she expects the
lack of interest in graduate school
by undergraduates to change.
