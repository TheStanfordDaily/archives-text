## 
### MARK LEMLEY Staff writer 
Award-winning physician
Charlie Clements will kick off
Sanctuary Week at Stanford
tonight when he discusses the
current political situation in El
Salvador.
Clements' speech, scheduled
for 7:30 p.m. In Kresge
Auditorium, will be followed by
a screening of his film "Witness
to War," which won a 1986
Academy Award for best short
documentary. The film
describes the year Clements
spent In El Salvador giving
medical assistance to civilians
injured by the war there.
The presentation is spon
sored by the Palo Alto/Stanford
Medical Aid Committee
(PASMAC), a group that pro
vides medical assistance to
both sides in Central American
conflicts. The group hopes the
event will draw attention to
current conditions in El Sal
vador, according to Max Peltz, a
PASMAC member.
The group plans to conclude
the week with a benefit concert
featuring Jackson Browne at
the San Jose Civic Center. The
concert is co-sponsored by PAS

MAC and the South Bay Sanc
tuary Covenant.
Seventy percent of the money
raised at the concert will go to
PASMAC, Peltz said, noting
that the money will be used to
help fund a hospital in
Nicaragua and a cooperative in
El Salvador. Neither venture is
supported by the governments
of the respective countries.
In addition to the Clements
and Browne events, the week
will include a symposium on
the legal aspects of the sanctu
ary movement. Don Gagliardi,
a law student responsible for
organizing the symposium,
said it would focus on a hypo
thetical legal case involving a
Salvadoran woman seeking ref
uge from the turmoil in her
country.
Gagliardi said that while the
idea for the forum came from
his involvement with Sanctu
ary at Stanford last year, the
program would not be biased.
"The important thing is to
present both sides of the issue,
and let people make up their
own minds," he said.
Gagliardi also said he hopes
this week's activities will help
stir student involvement in
Central American issues.
