# Psychedelic drug use up on Farm
## 
### CLAY CALVERT Staff writer 
While the use of most drugs
— Including alcohol — by Stan
ford students has remained
steady over the past three
years, a noticeable increase in
the use of psychedelic drugs,
including new synthetic drugs
such as ecstasy, has some Uni
versity officials concerned.
Of those students who
responded to a 1986 survey
compiled by the Cowell Student
Health Center, nine percent re
ported having tried psychedel
ics. That figure is nearly double
the five percent who reported
trying psychedelics just three
years earlier in a similar sur
vey.
Psychedelics are mind
altering drugs including mush
rooms, LSD and ecstasy, ac
cording to Alejandro Martinez,
a staff psychologist at Cowell.
Six percent of those students
responding to the 1986 Cowell
survey — the first year use of
ecstasy was measured — re
ported having tried or used the
drug, according to Vince
D'Andrea, associate director of
student health services.
Ecstasy, formally known as.
MDMA and frequently cat
egorized along with other syn
thetic compounds as a
"designer drug," can lead to a
state of euphoria that "is rather
prolonged, up to six or eight
hours," D'Andrea said. If a stu
dent is hassled or angry at the

time of use, the effects of the
drug may change, he added.
The side effects of ecstasy in
clude involuntary grinding of
the teeth, trouble urinating
and the possibility of perman
ent brain damage, D'Andrea
said. While studies showing the
drug's potential damage to the
brain have been conducted on
animals, evidence is not yet
clear about the exact effects on
the human brain, he said.
D'Andrea said animal research
is "cautionary" against use of
the drug.
Another problem with the
drug is that students may not
be using ecstasy when they
think they are.
"You really don't ever know
what you're getting," D'Andrea
said.
Those getting and using the
drug at Stanford are not fre
quent users, Martinez said,
noting that respondents to the
1986 survey who said they have
used the drug do so less than
once or twice a week. "Much of
the use seems to be very infre
quent," he said, pointing out
that infrequent ranges from
use once or twice a month to a
few times a year.
The increasing use of psyche
delics has gotten the attention
of the Stanford Police Depart
ment and officials in the Stu
dent Affairs Office.
"I get more rumors of in
creased usage of these designer
drugs," said Stanford Police
Chief Marvin Herrington.
