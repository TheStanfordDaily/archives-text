Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev's policy of
glasnost, or "openness," has been alternately
ridiculed as a propaganda stunt and hailed
as a significant democratization of the Soviet
Union. It should, instead, be seen for what it
is: a policy of undertaking reforms designed
to modernize Soviet society and to consoli
date Gorbachev's power. These reforms — by
their very nature — have a positive
propaganda value for the Soviet Union.
The western left sees Gorbachev as the
hope for freedom in Soviet Union, as the man
who will bring democracy to that country.
But actions such as changing party leader
ship, freeing dissidents and publishing a
novel do not constitute fundamental change
in the Soviet system. Arguments that the
Soviets have adopted western ideals of
freedom and democracy are unfounded.
On the other hand, a dangerously one
dimensional view of the Soviets, bordering
on jingoism, is readily evident in American

popular culture — witness the recent televi
sion miniseries "Amerika." The right's ac
cusation that Gorbachev's reforms are meant
merely to create a more positive world image
for Russia is itself evidence of this attitude.
While last week's "party for peace" in Moscow
clearly was a propaganda move, not all of
Gorbachev's actions can be written off as
posturing for the cameras. Indeed, Moscow's
recent arms control proposal has all the
makings of an honest attempt at nuclear
arms reduction in Europe.
Gorbachev's reforms are being undertaken
in order to overcome the economic stagna
tion of the late Brezhnev years. Glasnost is a
program designed to encourage efficiency
and foster industrial progress. Of course, ac
hieving these goals will increase Soviet power
vis-a-vis the United States. Americans
should try to understand glasnost with this
realistic view of Soviet motives, rather than
jump on a rhetoric bandwagon.
