Thanks for all
the support
We want to express our feelings
about a couple of issues that were
omitted from an otherwise fine
article about the transfer of a
Food Service manager (Daily, Feb.
25).
First, we — as workers and
United Stanford Workers (USW)
stewards — want to thank the
community and the Student
Labor Support Committee for
their support, especially about
the right of all of us to speak a
second language among our
selves.
Second, our strongest feeling

now is to put all that happened at
Flo Mo behind us, to make sure it
never happens again and to look
forward positively to the future.

Condom tests
just too much
Having lived and worked at
Stanford for more than three
decades, I have learned to admire
the physical vigor, stamina and
energy level of Stanford students.
Nevertheless, I believe we
jeopardized the health of students
when we expected them to test

and rate eight condoms in a per
iod of 72 hours.
I'm sure the Consumers Union
would agree that ratings are less
valid when products are not
tested in the manner for which
they were designed to be used —
a formidable undertaking in this
case. Indeed, even a less socially
demanding but clearly inferior
alternative method of testing
would require a level of autoerotic
behavior substantially exceeding
the norm among college males.
I pray that the authorities will
reconsider this hasty action and,
in the future, mercifully extend
the deadline — at least through a
weekend!
