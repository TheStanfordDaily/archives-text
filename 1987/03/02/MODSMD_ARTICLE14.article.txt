# Don't respect decision
## 
### 
Well, it's now official. In June, Stanford will lose
one of its most valuable assets. Asst. History Prof.
Stephen Ferruolo, denied tenure for the second time,
will, as noted in a recent editorial (Daily, Feb. 17),
"have to take his considerable talents as a scholar
and as a teacher elsewhere."
That such a dynamic professor with a strong com
mitment to undergraduate education will not be
allowed to continue his career at Stanford is both
tragic and inexplicable. That The Daily should argue
that we students must "respect" the decision of the
tenure committee is ludicrous. The rejection of Fer
ruolo's appeal is illustrative of a fundamentally un
sound philosophy that has gained ascendency in
some ranks of the Administration and the faculty —
the notion that undergraduate education is expen
dable if it conflicts with the goal of making Stanford
the country's premier research institution.

As The Daily admits, the denial of tenure in Fer
ruolo's case is difficult to fathom. Ferruolo's creden
tials as an educator have never been in question. A
recipient of the prestigious Dinkelspiel Award for
outstanding teaching ability, Ferruolo has routinely
been ranked by students as one of Stanford's most
popular professors.
He is one of those few instructors who genuinely
appears to love his teaching, approaching each
lecture as a new opportunity to share his consider
able enthusiasm for and knowledge of medieval his
tory. As proof of his passion for undergraduate edu
cation, Ferruolo — although in effect fired from the
University — volunteered to serve as coordinator and
lecturer for the history track of the Western Culture
Program, a class with a large freshman enrollment.
Why. we might ask. was there nobody else out of a
large history faculty who was willing to serve in this
capacity? Because the History Department, like
many departments here, has a shortage of motivated
faculty members who care enough about undergrad
uate education to take on such a role.
Ferruolo's published work also appears to have
been impressive for a professor of his age. The Daily
reports that in his first tenure review "the quality of
his scholarship was called very considerable.' " Un
fortunately. Dean of Humanities and Sciences Nor
man Wessells appears to have recently changed the
rules concerning the criteria for tenure appoint
ments. An individual will now be granted tenure only
if he ranks with the best in his field — no matter
what age — or if he has changed the way in which
scholars look upon his discipline.
Presumably, Ferruolo "failed" on these grounds. As
others have pointed out, Wessell s goals are unrealis
tic criteria upon which to judge a scholar who is only
in his late 30s. The notion that each candidate
should be compared to those who have had an extra
generation of experience in the discipline implies
that one can learn nothing in 30 years of scholar
ship. Given the emphasis Stanford professors place
upon research, this seems indeed an ironic assump
tion.
However, concentrating merely upon the reasons
Ferruolo did not live up to the new standards of
scholarship misses an even more fundamental issue
about the way in which tenure is determined: Why
are professors' tenure decisions weighted so heavily
on publication and so little on quality of teaching?
This situation seems out of step with the ostensible
purpose of a university.

Ferruolo, as a historian, would be able to discuss
this at length — the institution of the university had
its origins in medieval Europe. At that time, the
demand on the part of students for quality instruc
tion could not be met by the existing schools and
monasteries. Groups of students and groups of pro
fessors banded together to protect their own inter
ests. and the university formed as compromise be
tween the two sets of groups. The professors could
charge fees, set standards of admission and control
entrance into their profession. In return for their
fees, students were to receive a quality education.
Unfortunately, it appears that at a modern re
search university such as Stanford we students are
simply not getting our money's worth. In regulating
entrance into its departments, Stanford's faculty
and Administration often seem more concerned with
the reputation of the scholars they can attract than
with the ability of those scholars to teach; these
scholars can be a lucrative source of government and
foundation grants. Unfortunately, the nearly #4.000
we students spend on tuition each quarter thus sup
ports many professors who put little significant time
into undergraduate education.
The tenure process itself, by rewarding published
work rather than fine teaching ability (is it worth
even 10 percent?), institutionalizes Stanford's re
search orientation. With oppressive tenure stand
ards looming ahead, the junior faculty member finds
him or herself racing to "publish or perish." In fact,
the feeling among several faculty members I've
spoken to is that if one's teaching has been
recognized as superior, one's published work needs
to be that much better for tenure.
The denial of tenure in Ferruolo's case should be a
formative lesson for younger faculty at Stanford:
This institution does not care about the quality of
undergraduate instruction. Somewhere along the
line, the original purpose of the university — to edu
cate its students — seems to have been subverted.
Instead of passionate lectures by enthusiastic profes
sors, one often finds graduate students struggling to
fill their shoes.
Paradoxically, Ferruolo's plight occurs at a time
when the University is preparing itself to embark
into a brave new world as the "unchallenged leader"
of the next century. The Centennial Campaign is
already well on its way to achieving its audacious
goal of *1.1 billion in gifts. We hear a great deal these
days about the drive to "get to the top and stay
there."
I believe that the new tenure criteria represent a
desire to enhance the reputation of Stanford as the
leading educational institution in (his country. This
is in many ways a laudable goal; a university should
continually strive to improve. But I wonder if. after
the drive to get to the top. we will find that all those
promised endowed chairs in the Humanities and
Sciences are filled with professors who don't give a
damn about teaching undergraduates.
The notion that Stanford students must "respect"
a tenure decision that they find unacceptable implies
that they must relinquish their ideas about the
quality of instruction they should receive. If any
thing. students at Stanford have been too passive re
garding this aspect of their educational experience.
Given their financial importance to the University,
they are at least entitled to call for what English Prof.
Ronald Rebholz has suggested — a yearly review of
each professor's teaching ability. The Daily's
proclamation that "this case is closed" is true only
for those who do not mind seeing the same events
repeated.
