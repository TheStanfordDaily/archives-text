# Diatribes not useful
## 
### 
The Democrats have stumbled upon a very viable
theme for the upcoming elections: gloom and doom.
Now that everyone has written Ronald Reagan's
obituary, it's open season on American happiness,
and the left has got some big guns — or should I say
some loud guns. The competition is fierce, but after
carefully weighing the evidence, I have selected An
thony Lewis, stand-up bore for The New York Times,
as the best shot around.
Those of you who make it to the San Francisco
Chronicle's "Daily Punch" section in the morning
undoubtedly have to use ear plugs and mountain
boots to get through one of Lewis' diatribes. A typical
title for a Lewis column would be "Power loss in
Washington" or "Is this life in America?" Allow me to
recall some of that lucid Lewis prose.

"Ronald Reagan is the least competent occupant of
the White House since Warren Gamaliel Har
ding. . . . Oh, Reagan can talk persuasively. And he
has ideas: about four of them. Government is bad,
except for military spending. The only goal of foreign
policy is to fight communism. Rays in the sky will
protect us from everything and do away with nuclear
weapons. Cutting taxes will make us rich and end
deficits."
I personally recommend "Husher" ear plugs,
available at The Store for a little over two bucks. To
begin with, George McGovern and Walter Mondale,
after offering their brainy selves to the republic,
picked up one state each. And as Jeanne Kirkpatrick
has said, "maintaining the view of Reagan's incom
petence requires denying some very compelling facts,
for Reagan has enjoyed a long and extraordinarily
successful political career that stretches through two
terms as governor of the largest state and two terms
as president."
Concerning the idea that "government is bad, ex
cept for military spending." call me a radical, but I
tend to want as little government interference in my
life as possible, and unless Lewis wants to hand the
country over to Gorbachev, it might behoove us to
consider some military spending now and then. And
about the idea that the "only goal of foreign policy is
to fight communism" — if Lewis shows me a
postcard from Gorby saying the Soviet Union has
reconsidered and decided to turn all its guns into
scrap metal, then I'll nominate Lewis for secretary of
state, or whatever.
"Rays in the sky" obviously refers to the Strategic
Defense Initiative (SDI). Depending on which scien
tist you talk to. there are some pretty smart cookies
out there who think SDI is a little more than just
"rays in the sky." As to Reagan's last idea, "cutting
taxes . . . end deficits": In 1982, Lewis' buddy Tip
O'Neill prevented from reaching the floor of the

House a constitutional amendment that would have
denied Congress the right to overspend — after a
Republican-controlled Senate passed the amend
ment. (Our leader with only four ideas happened to
support that one.)
Now, you could easily say, these points are
arguable and, just between you and me, Scott, I
never was a real big fan of the Gipper. That's fine.
But Lewis inevitably reveals himself to be nothing
but a hollow bore at the end of his columns. At the
end of his famous "Power Loss in Washington"
column, he says:"The fundamental need is plain. It
is to elect presidents of character and ability, who
will respect the Constitution we have."
Stop the presses! Get Milo Deßloom on the wire!
Constructive criticism at its finest.
Anybody can hack away at government. It's easy.
All one has to do is say something like "Reagan's a
fascist!" or "Make love, not war." But what have you
accomplished? You're certainly no help to those of us
who are honestly trying to improve the situation and
deal with complex issues. And you generally put
eveiyone else to sleep.
Now Lewis is certainly not alone in this mindless
protest. Tom Wicker, Henry Fairlie and, on the politi
cal scene. Joe Biden come to mind. But I think we're
on to something much bigger than just a few bad
columns or some lousy speeches. I think the Demo
crats believe they can literally scare the votes out of
people, and the results look promising.
For the past six years the country has been com
pletely baffled by the tremendous success of Presi
dent Reagan. It was, as Michael Kinsley of The New
Republic said, too good to be true. America's intel
ligentsia wracked its collective brain as it watched 49
states say yes to another four years of the ex-actor in
1984. The guy could do no wrong.
But now, you see, that's all over. The "movie's over"
and it's time to get back to business as usual —
crime, deficits, the arms race and STDs. "Ha! We told
you so!" say the Democrats, and they're going to keep
telling you what sorry shape this country is in. all the
way up until that second Tuesday in November.
It really is a fascinating phenomenon. After a slow
but steady loss of faith in the American presidency —
climaxing in the complete frustration of the public
with President Carter's inability to deal with the
Iranian hostage crisis — the people were about to
give up. Then along came a savior who took us all for
a six-year joy ride, during which most of us rarely
bothered to glance at a headline. Democracy could
take care of itself. There was even talk of repealing
the 22nd amendment. Wow!
But the Iran-contra affair broke the spell and
restored us to our senses. I can just hear the next
speech from Joe Biden. "America has been asleep for
too long! We must all wake up and face the cold
reality that our nation is in a no-win scenario unless
we elect tough leaders who are willing to make tough
decisions!" (That's Biden with a 'B.' ladies and
gentlemen.)
The strategy is ingenius. Convince the people
they're sick and then convince them you've got the
cure. It's witch doctor time.
