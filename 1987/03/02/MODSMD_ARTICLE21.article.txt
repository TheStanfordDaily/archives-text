## Reveno leads resurgent Card past ASU 
### SUSAN SLUSSER Editorial staff 
Early in the second half of the Stan
ford men's basketball team's 97-92
overtime win against Arizona State Sat
urday at Maples Pavilion, ASU guard
Steve Beck approached Stanford for
ward Eric Reveno, who by that point held
collected 17 points.
"He said to me. 'You're throwing every
thing in.' said Reveno. who was, at the
time, standing at the free-throw line
after being fouled by Sun Devil guard
Bobby Thompson while sinking a 15-
foot jumper from the left side.
"I said Don't tell me that,' and he said
'No, you just can't miss,' " Reveno
added. "I said, 'You should know about
that.' It was kind of a little foreshadow
ing."
It was indeed a foreshadowing — for
both men. Beck, who had 13 points
when he made his remarks to Reveno,
went on to total a game-high 33 points
on 1 l-of-24 shooting from the floor —
including an amazing nine of 11 from
three-point range — and two free
throws. The nine three-pointers were
two more than had been scored by one
player in any single game in the Pacific
10 Conference this season, and five
more than Beck had ever made.
Reveno collected a career-high 28
points and. as Beck noted, did not miss
much, hitting nine of 13 from the field
and 10 of 13 from the line. He also pulled
down a game-high 13 rebounds, includ
ing five offensive boards, and added two
blocked shots and three steals. In the
last two games, Reveno has tallied 45
points, 26 rebounds, seven steals, six
blocks and four assists — and has been
nominated for Pac-10 Player of the Week
for his performance.
The win over ASU gave the Cardinal a
bye in the opening round of (he Pac-10
Post-Season Tournament, which gets
under way Thursday at Pauley Pavilion
in Los Angeles. The bottom four teams
in the Pac-10 play in the opening round
of the tournament Thursday night.

while the top six teams do not play until
Friday night.
ASU, 10-16 overall and 6-12 in the
Pac-10 after the loss, is the eighth-place
team in the Pac-10 and will play Wash
ington State Thursday.
Stanford, which will play Washington
Friday at 7 p.m.. avoided the dreaded
opening round as a result of Oregon's
79-65 loss Saturday to Washington
State. The Ducks dropped to 8-10 In the
league and seventh in the standings,
while Stanford finished the regular
season in sixth place with a 15-12 over
all record and a 9-9 conference mark. It
marked the first time Stanford has not
had a losing season in league play since
1972-73, when the recently renamed
Cardinal team wound up 7-7 in the Pac
8.
"It feels better when you're 9-9," said
Stanford forward Todd Lichti, who
scored 21 points against the Sun Devils,
and is now just nine points away from
becoming the first sophomore in Stan
ford history to score 1,000 points. "It's
the difference between a .500 season
and a losing season. I don't think any of
us want to be losers."
The Sun Devils clearly did not want to
be losers either, however. Despite con
sistently being outshot — Stanford shot
64 percent from the field, while ASU
shot 45 percent — and outrebounded
37-30, ASU tenaciously kept pace with
the Cardinal throughout the game by
virtue of — what else? — the three-point
shot.
In the first half. Beck was fairly quiet,
tallying a mere 10 points and just two
three-pointers. And an instant replay
later showed one of the three-pointers, a
shot with four seconds left in the half
that cut Stanford's lead to 34-33, to ac
tually be from two-point range.
The man who really kept the Sun
Devils in the game in the opening period
was 5-foot-9 guard Arthur Thomas, who
came off the bench to score 13 of his 25
points in the first half. In one seven
minute stretch, the junior scored 11
straight points for ASU, cutting a five
point Cardinal lead to 27-25, then put

ting the Devils up 28-27 with a pair of
three-point shots before a Brian
McSweeney free throw and a Reveno
basket put Stanford on top again.
"It's frustrating when you go up like
that, and then they can always keep in
the game with three-pointers." Stanford
guard Novlan Whitsitt said.
The Cardinal jumped out quickly in
the final period on two Lichti layups and
a pair of Reveno free throws, but Beck
responded with the first of his second
half three-pointers to make the score 40-
36. Stanford went up by eight, its larg
est lead of the day. on Reveno's 15-foot
jumper and subsequent free throw after
Thompson's foul, but then Beck began
his barrage in earnest, hitting from the
right side to clip the Cardinal lead to 58-
53.
With the Cardinal up 64-61, it was
Beck again, this time from the left cor
ner to tie the score. The 6-3 senior put
the Sun Devils on top 71-68 minutes
later on a 23-foot jumper from the right
side, and ASU suddenly took a 76-70
lead with four minutes to play.
Lichti scored two straight, was fouled
on the second and made the free throw
to trim the Devils' lead to one. After two
Thomas free throws, a Howard Wright
slam off a Lichti feed (one of three dunks
on the day for Wright, who compiled 17
points and eight rebounds) made the
score 78-77 and brought the Cardinal to
life.
Stanford regained the lead 83-79 on
clutch free-throw shooting by Whitsitt
and Terry Taylor, who finished in double
figures with 14 points (two three-point
goals and eight of eight from the line)
and added eight assists. A four-point
lead with 35 seconds left, however, is
not safe with Steve Beck on the court.
Beck's fifth three-pointer of the second
half made it 83-82.
Two more Taylor free throws with 18
seconds remaining seemed to ice the
game for Stanford, putting the Cardinal
ahead 85-82. But there was Beck again,
under heavy pressure, taking the shot

This slam dunk Saturday helped Stanford senior Novian Whitsitt celebrate his final
game at Maples Pavilion. The Cardinal's 97-92 overtime victory against ASU gave the
squad a first-round bye in this week's Pac-10 tournament.
from 20 feet out with 13 seconds
left. Good. Lichti's last-second at
tempt from the left corner at the
other end was no good, and the
game went into overtime.
The Cardinal took charge in the
five-minute period, scoring first
and scoring three straight on a
Wright dunk, two Reveno free
throws and a Lichti layup to take a

91-85 lead that proved insur
mountable, especially as Beck was
held to just one three-point shot
in overtime. Fittingly enough, it
was Reveno's free throws with two
seconds left that concluded the
97-92 victory for the Cardinal.
"Reveno gave us absolute fits,"
ASU Coach Steve Patterson said.
"We tried all kinds of defenses, but
he got the job done. Eric gives
them an added dimension in
shooting and rebounding. We
tried to get our inside men to out
muscle him, but it was like gnats

on an elephant."
"He has played well down the
stretch," Stanford Coach Mike
Montgomery said. "The last three
games, he's been an All-Pac-10
player."
Beck, an honorable-mention All-
Pac-10 player himself last season,
has always played well against
Stanford, averaging 22 points per
game against the Cardinal in his
four years at ASU. Coming into
Saturday's game, however. Beck
had been in the worst shooting
slump of his career, hitting only

35 percent of his attempts in the
last month.
"He has been in a little bit of a
slump," Patterson said, "but he
had his rhythm today.
Don't tell Montgomery that Beck
was in a slump, though. "He's un
believable; he shot the lights out,"
Montgomery said. "How many
points did he end up with? Were
any layups? Maybe a layup for
Beck is from 35 feet. He was just
letting it fly. I didn't think our
defense was that bad. That's
tough to counter."
