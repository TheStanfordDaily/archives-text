# Women hoopsters fall to Sun Devils
## 
### PABLO MORALES Staff writer 
Saturday night's game
against the Arizona State
women's basketball team was
truly a microcosm of Stanford's
entire 1986-87 season.
Indicative of its yearlong
struggle, this contest pitted
Cardinal youth against an ex
perienced opponent.
Final score: Experience by
10.81-71.
An emotionally charged Sun
Devil squad, fielding five
seniors starting in their final
home game, exploded to an
early first-half lead and then
thwarted an inspired Cardinal
rally in the second half for the
victory. Stanford dropped to
13-13 overall and 7-9 in the
Pacific 10 Conference.
"They had senior pride on the
line." Stanford Coach Tara
VanDerveer said. "It was a com
pliment to them on how well
they responded in their very
last game."
A perfect ending to their Sun
Devil careers, the game saw all
five seniors, led by forward
Sherry Poole's 19 points,
scoring in double figures.
"Those kids are just great
shooters." VanDerveer said.
"We went to a zone for just two
minutes and they just killed it.

They have some long-range
bombers."
ASU's explosive attack
caught the relatively inexperi
enced Cardinal sleeping in the
first half en route to a 44-27
halftime advantage.
"They played emotionally and
we were a step too slow in the
first half," VanDerveer said.
"They disrupted our offense by
denying the ball inside and by
pressing out on our people. We
weren't sharp and we didn't
sprint back."
Early foul trouble also hin
dered Stanford's cause in the
first half and for most of the
game. The Sun Devils, a great
free-throw shooting team, took
full advantage of the situation
by hitting 27 of 32 shots from
the foul line.
Arizona State extended its
lead to 20 points early in the
second half before Stanford
made an impressive comeback
led by a senior of its own. Sue
Sebolt, who ignited the Card
inal rally with some fine pass
ing and aggressive defense.
Freshmen Jennifer Azzi and
Katy Steding and sophomore
Jill Yanke followed Sebolt's lead
by shredding the net in the
second half.
Azzi rebounded from five
turnovers in the first half by hit
ting six of eight shots from the
field in the second half. She
dished out eight assists to go
along with her 17 points. Steding
added 16 points and 16 rebounds,
and Yanke finished with 18 points
to lead the Cardinal.
With four minutes remaining,
Stanford had cut the lead to 68-

64, but this was as close as the
Cardinal would come. ASU's well
rounded offensive attack proved
too difficult to contain.
"They (ASU) had five people
scoring in double figures, so we
couldn't just key on any one per
son," VanDerveer said. "We really
made a great effort in the second
half, but we just dug a hole that
we couldn't get out of. They (the
five seniors) made it their night,
but we helped them in the first
half."
