# Card salvages finale at UCLA
## 
### TOM SENF Editorial staff 
LOS ANGELES - Jack
McDowell has been back in the
Stanford rotation for about three
weeks now, but the real Jack
McDowell — the All-Pacific 10
Southern Division selection and
second-team Ail-American — did
not return until yesterday, and for
the Cardinal it was not a moment
too soon.
With a sweep at the hands of
hot-hitting UCLA staring it right
in the face, Stanford turned to its
ace, and he responded, striking
out nine in seven tough innings to
lead t he Cardinal to a 13-5 victory.
The win allowed Stanford to
salvage the final game of the three
game series after being pounded
the previous two days. 14-5 on
Saturday and 17-9 on Friday.
Stanford is now 1-2 in the Six-
Pac. UCLA is at 4-2, tied atop the
conference with Arizona, which
swept three from California in
Tucson this weekend.
It is hard to call the third game
of a 30-game season crucial, but
had the Cardinal lost yesterday, it
would have already trailed the
Bruins, generally considered to be
its primary Six-Pac competition,
by 3 and 1/2 games. "I knew it was
a huge game." McDowell, now 2-1,
said. "We had to have this game.
That was our season."
McDowell's numbers (five runs
in seven innings) were not spec
tacular. but he was able to keep
the Bruins from exploding as they
had the previous two days. "The

key was to keep them out of the
big inning," he said.
Leading 2-1 in the third, Stan
ford extended its advantage to five
on RBI singles by Ed Sprague and
Doug Robbins and a two-run
groundball double into the
left field corner by third baseman
Mark Machtolf.
UCLA had fallen behind in the
previous two games only to storm
back, and the Bruins threatened
to do so again. Second baseman
Torey Lovullo hit a solo homer in
the third, and Scott Cline followed
suit in the fourth. Later in that in
ning. Lovullo came to the plate
with two on and two out, but
McDowell blew a high fastball by
him to keep Stanford ahead 6-3.
In the fifth, with UCLA right
hander Jeff Conine on in relief of
southpaw starter Steve Stowell,
Stanford Coach Mark Marquess
decided to replace right-handed
hitters Scott Delucchi, Machtolf
and Brian Johnson with lefties
Paul Carey, Ron Witmeyer and Jeff
Saenger.
The results were mixed at first,
as Carey singled and Witmeyer
popped up, but after Frank Carey
walked. Marquess looked like a
genius when Saenger touched off
a three-run homer to right, his
first at Stanford.
After McDowell struck out the
side in the fifth, UCLA Coach Gary
Adams tried to play the lefty-righty
percentages by bringing in lefty
Keith Shibata to face Paul Carey
with one man on. The strategy

Stanford ace Jack McDowell came through under pressure yesterday
striking out nine in seven innings to help the Cardinal avoid a league
opening sweep at the hands of UCLA.
backfired, however, as Carey
crushed Shibata's first pitch well
over the 365-foot sign in right
center to stake Stanford to a 12-3
lead.
"Our biggest problem has been
just scoring in one or two in
nings," Carey said. "We need to do
more than that. UCLA had been
doing it in the first two games,
and today we did it." Stanford
scored in five different innings
yesterday.
McDowell began to tire in the
sixth, surrendering two runs, but
managed to get through the
seventh before handing the ball
over to Jim Price. Price worked
two scoreless innings, but only
after fanning Bruin sluggers Billy
Haselman and Steve Hisey with
the bases loaded in the eighth.
"We showed a little character
today," leftfielder Ruben Amaro
said. "In the first couple (games)
we seemed a little tentative. We

didn't come out with fire in our
eyes. Plus, it was really nice
having Jack out there."
Things began on a sour note on
Saturday, as the UCLA organist's
rendition of the national anthem
did anything but "honor
America," but the Stanford pitch
ing staff was also off-key. The
Cardinal was tagged for 13 hits
and three homers in the Bruins'
14-5 win.
After UCLA starter Randy Hen
nis walked the bases loaded in the
second, Toi Cook unloaded them
with a howling double into the
leftfield corner. Cook later scored
on a Robbins single, and Stanford
had a 4-0 lead.
Bruin rightfielder Jeff Osborn
cut the lead in half with a homer
in the bottom of the inning, but
Witmeyer's solo blast in the third
put Stanford ahead 5-2.
That was it for Stanford,
however, as Hennis and Bill Wen
rick blanked the Cardinal on two
hits the rest of the way. Mean
while, UCLA scored two in the
fourth, took the lead and chased

Stanford starter Steve Chitren (2-
1) in the fifth and scored two more
in the sixth.
Osborn and Lovullo put Stan
ford away with two-run homers as
part of the Bruins' six-run
seventh. For the weekend, Lovullo
went 7 for 16 with three homers
and seven RBIs.
Lovullo, last year's Six-Pac Co-
Player of the Year (with teammate
Alex Sanchez), did much of his
damage later in the count as he
waited for the fastball. "If a guy's
ready to throw three good
breakers, I'll tip my hat to him,"
he said. "My theory is to hit the
fastball, unless you have to hit the
breaking ball."
On Friday, Stanford once again
took a substantial early lead,
wiping out a 4-0 deficit in the
fourth with an eight-run uprising
against Sanchez.
After four walks and a Paul
Carey single left the bases loaded
and a run in, David Esquer drilled
a two-run single up the middle.
Amaro reloaded the bases with a
single, then Cook lashed a two
run double to right-center that

ended Sanchez' afternoon.
Mike Magnante took over for
UCLA, but allowed three more
runs before the inning ended.
UCLA knocked out Lee Plemel
with a three-run fourth, then took
the lead on a long two-run homer
to left-center by Hisey off reliever
Al Osuna (2-2).
Witmeyer tied it at nine with a
homer in the seventh, but the
Bruins erupted for eight unearned
runs in the bottom of the eighth.
Three walks (two intentional), two
singles and three errors made the
score 13-9, then Haselman ended
any remaining doubt with a grand
slam to left.
For the weekend, UCLA scored
in 15 of the 25 innings in which it
batted. "We caught them when
they were hot with the bat,"
Marquess said. "That's why
today's win was so big."
UCLA was hot, but Stanford
fanned the flames in the first two
games with walks, hit batsmen
and by falling behind in the count.
"If you let them sit on the fastball,
they're going to hit it," McDowell
said.
