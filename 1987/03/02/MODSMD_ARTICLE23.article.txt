# Card salvages finale at UCLA
## 
### TOM SENF Editorial staff 
LOS ANGELES - Jack
McDowell has been back in the
Stanford rotation for about three
weeks now, but the real Jack
McDowell — the All-Pacific 10
Southern Division selection and
second-team Ail-American — did
not return until yesterday, and for
the Cardinal it was not a moment
too soon.
With a sweep at the hands of
hot-hitting UCLA staring it right
in the face, Stanford turned to its
ace, and he responded, striking
out nine in seven tough innings to
lead t he Cardinal to a 13-5 victory.
The win allowed Stanford to
salvage the final game of the three
game series after being pounded
the previous two days. 14-5 on
Saturday and 17-9 on Friday.
Stanford is now 1-2 in the Six-
Pac. UCLA is at 4-2, tied atop the
conference with Arizona, which
swept three from California in
Tucson this weekend.
It is hard to call the third game
of a 30-game season crucial, but
had the Cardinal lost yesterday, it
would have already trailed the
Bruins, generally considered to be
its primary Six-Pac competition,
by 3 and 1/2 games. "I knew it was
a huge game." McDowell, now 2-1,
said. "We had to have this game.
That was our season."
McDowell's numbers (five runs
in seven innings) were not spec
tacular. but he was able to keep
the Bruins from exploding as they
had the previous two days. "The

key was to keep them out of the
big inning," he said.
Leading 2-1 in the third, Stan
ford extended its advantage to five
on RBI singles by Ed Sprague and
Doug Robbins and a two-run
groundball double into the
left field corner by third baseman
Mark Machtolf.
UCLA had fallen behind in the
previous two games only to storm
back, and the Bruins threatened
to do so again. Second baseman
Torey Lovullo hit a solo homer in
the third, and Scott Cline followed
suit in the fourth. Later in that in
ning. Lovullo came to the plate
with two on and two out, but
McDowell blew a high fastball by
him to keep Stanford ahead 6-3.
In the fifth, with UCLA right
hander Jeff Conine on in relief of
southpaw starter Steve Stowell,
Stanford Coach Mark Marquess
decided to replace right-handed
hitters Scott Delucchi, Machtolf
and Brian Johnson with lefties
Paul Carey, Ron Witmeyer and Jeff
Saenger.
The results were mixed at first,
as Carey singled and Witmeyer
popped up, but after Frank Carey
walked. Marquess looked like a
genius when Saenger touched off
a three-run homer to right, his
first at Stanford.
After McDowell struck out the
side in the fifth, UCLA Coach Gary
Adams tried to play the lefty-righty
percentages by bringing in lefty
Keith Shibata to face Paul Carey
with one man on. The strategy

Stanford ace Jack McDowell came through under pressure yesterday
striking out nine in seven innings to help the Cardinal avoid a league
opening sweep at the hands of UCLA.
