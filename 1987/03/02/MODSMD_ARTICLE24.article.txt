# Stanford women swim away with Pac-10 title
## 
### BRENDAN HEALEY Senior staff writer 
LOS ANGELES — "Air Stanford" took
off here this weekend, and Stanlord
Coach George Haines is hoping it won't
come down until after the NCAA meet.
Haines' Air Jordan-clad women's swim
mers ran roughshod over the competition
at the Inaugural Pacific 10 Conference
meet, compiling 1.452 points to win by
1 12 and 1/2 over second-place USC and
take 14 out of 18 swimming events. The
coach, sporting a pair of new Air Jordans
himself, liked what he saw at the East Los
Angeles College Pool.
"I'm really happy." said Haines, after
collecting the championship trophy. "As
far as we're concerned, we're standing
really good (before the NCAAs). Aimcc Ber
zins had a great meet. Dana Anderson
swam great. Our breaststrokers, our
backstrokers . . . unbelievable. What else
could 1 say? Now all 1 have to do is get
everybody healthy."
The Cardinal established its dominance
at the outset during the Friday
preliminaries as it qualified at least three
swimmers for the top 24 in each event.

The only cloud on an otherwise bright
morning session came when Stanford's
Laurie McLean missed the 200-yard indi
vidual medley due to illness, although she
came back to hit the NCAA qualifying
time Saturday night in a supplementary
time trial.
Stanford wasn't the only team bedeviled
by poor health. USC received a blow when
Kathy Hcttche failed to make the finals in
the 500 freestyle. Hettche, who was ex
pected to contend for the title, was just
coming off a bout with strep throat, and
USC Coach Don LaMont said. "She gave it
100 percent. She just couldn't go any
faster."
Even a healthy Hettche might not have
been able to break up the Cardinal dis
tance juggernaut. Stanford's Anderson
came out of nowhere she wasn't among
the top five seeds — to post the morning's
fastest qualifying time and nip teammate
Lisa Gillespie in the finals lor the champi
onship The Cardinal's Stacy Shupe. also
fighting the effects of illness, copped
sixth.
Anderson came back later that night to
swim a blazing third leg on the 800
freestyle relay, catching California's
Kvrsten Burr and giving Stanford anchor

Jenna Johnson a large margin to work
with.
"It really helped my confidence a lot,"
Anderson said of her 500 win. "I was
really happv. especially with my swim
ming tonight."
Anderson wasn't the only Stanford star
on a night when the Cardinal swept the
championships in all five swimming
finals. Michelle Griglione. called "the heir
apparent to (American record-holder)
Tracy Caulkins" by the meet announcer,
bounced back from nearly missing the
200 IM finals after a relatively slow morn
ing swim.
"It has been a while since I've swum a
shorter IM." Griglione said of her
prelimary effort. "I just spun my wheels. I
wasn't grabbing any water."
An afternoon strategy session with
Haines straightened Griglione out.
though, and she edged the pre-meet fa
vorite and fastest qualifier. Beda Leirvaag
ot Arizona State, for the win. The next
riight she added the championship in the
400 IM.
Haines entered a whopping 1 1 swim
mers in the 200 IM. and the move paid off
as Stanford placed six in the top 24 and
qualified two more athletes, Monica

Nielebeck and Susannah Miller, for the
NCAAs.
Johnson, another member of Stan
ford's "walking wounded," shook off the
effects of the antibiotics she was taking
for a cold and streaked to victory in the 50
freestyle, while swimming legs on the
champion 200 medley. 800 freestyle. 400
medley and 400 freestyle relays over the
weekend.
One very formidable opponent stood in
Johnson's path to a butterfly victory,
though, as she resumed her rivalry with
Cal's Mary T. Meagher In the 100 Satur
day night. The race was a virtual carbon
copy of the pair's meeting in Berkeley two
weeks ago as Johnson went out fast only
to be overtaken by Meagher at the end.
"It's the typical Jenna-Mary T. race,
where she's out a little ahead of me and
I've got to run her down at the end," Meag
her said.
Meagher trained lightly in the fall and Is
leery of Johnson's potential. "I'm the one
that's quaking in my boots," said Meag
her. who later won the 200. "She has been
working out hard all year. She should ex
pect big time drops. I don't know if I'll
have the big time drops."

One swimmer who wasn't waiting for
the NCAAs for her time to drop was Stan
ford's Berzins. She entered the meet still
needing to qualify in the 200 freestyle and
ended up slashing her season best and
winning the event. Gillespie. Anderson
and Shupe followed in third through fifth
as the Cardinal dominated the race.
Stanford had also been expected to bury
the field in the 100 backstroke with the
top four times entering the meet.
However, when McLean was unable to
swim and Jenny Shannon was disquali
fied for failing to touch the wall on the
third turn in the preliminaries, only Jen
nifer Pokluda and Michelle Donahue
remained.
Donahue went to war with ASU's Steph
anie Lister and prevailed by .13 of a
second, while Pokluda copped third.
"1 knew Stephanie Lister would go out
fast." said Donahue, whose head was bob
bing up and down as she visibly strained
in the stretch dual. "I figured if I was with
her at the turn, I had a good chance of
beating her. The last 12 and a half yards
were pretty hard. I Just wanted to finish."
The expected Stanford back
stroke romp did materialize the
next night in the 200. The Card
inal placed five swimmers in the
championship heat, leading one
spectator to note, "It looks like
Stanford practice." Donahue won
again with a sparkling 1:59.33
that lowered her season best by
more than two seconds, and was
followed by teammates in second,
third, seventh and eighth.
Joining Berzins, Donahue and
the Cardinal's other Saturday
night champions was Susan Rapp
in the 100 breaststroke. Rapp
flashed home barely ahead of
ASU's Terri Baxter and was fol
lowed closely by teammate Jill
Johnson, who hit her cut with a
third-place finish. The trio dupli
cated this order of finish last
night also when a determined
Baxter was once again edged by
Rapp, this time in the 200
breaststroke.

Anderson opened Sunday's ac
tion by posting the morning's fast
est time in the 1,650 freestyle and
carving a whopping 37 seconds off
her season best, in an event in
which no preliminaries were con
tested.
Only two swimmers in the even
ing championship heat could bet
ter that time as USC's Leslie
Daland swamped the field and
Shupe finished comfortably in
second.
Perhaps the upset of the even
ing came in the 100 freestyle,
when Berzins surprised teammate
Jenna Johnson. The two were
neck-and-neck throughout and
held off a hard-charging Jenny
Susser of UCLA at the wall.
Berzins and Johnson formed a
devastating team in the meet's
concluding event, joining Miller
and McLean in the 400 freestyle
relay, and the Cardinal won going
away.
Meanwhile, down at the Univer
sity of Arizona, Stanford's Katie
Connors nabbed second in three
meter diving and a third off the
one-meter board.

off here this weekend, and Stanlord
Coach George Haines is hoping it won't
come down until after the NCAA meet.
Haines' Air Jordan-clad women's swim
mers ran roughshod over the competition
at the Inaugural Pacific 10 Conference
meet, compiling 1.452 points to win by
1 12 and 1/2 over second-place USC and
take 14 out of 18 swimming events. The
coach, sporting a pair of new Air Jordans
himself, liked what he saw at the East Los
Angeles College Pool.
"I'm really happy." said Haines, after
collecting the championship trophy. "As
far as we're concerned, we're standing
really good (before the NCAAs). Aimcc Ber
zins had a great meet. Dana Anderson
swam great. Our breaststrokers, our
backstrokers . . . unbelievable. What else
could 1 say? Now all 1 have to do is get
everybody healthy."
The Cardinal established its dominance
at the outset during the Friday
preliminaries as it qualified at least three
swimmers for the top 24 in each event.

The only cloud on an otherwise bright
morning session came when Stanford's
Laurie McLean missed the 200-yard indi
vidual medley due to illness, although she
came back to hit the NCAA qualifying
time Saturday night in a supplementary
time trial.
Stanford wasn't the only team bedeviled
by poor health. USC received a blow when
Kathy Hcttche failed to make the finals in
the 500 freestyle. Hettche, who was ex
pected to contend for the title, was just
coming off a bout with strep throat, and
USC Coach Don LaMont said. "She gave it
100 percent. She just couldn't go any
faster."
Even a healthy Hettche might not have
been able to break up the Cardinal dis
tance juggernaut. Stanford's Anderson
came out of nowhere she wasn't among
the top five seeds — to post the morning's
fastest qualifying time and nip teammate
Lisa Gillespie in the finals lor the champi
onship The Cardinal's Stacy Shupe. also
fighting the effects of illness, copped
sixth.
Anderson came back later that night to
swim a blazing third leg on the 800
freestyle relay, catching California's
Kvrsten Burr and giving Stanford anchor

Jenna Johnson a large margin to work
with.
"It really helped my confidence a lot,"
Anderson said of her 500 win. "I was
really happv. especially with my swim
ming tonight."
Anderson wasn't the only Stanford star
on a night when the Cardinal swept the
championships in all five swimming
finals. Michelle Griglione. called "the heir
apparent to (American record-holder)
Tracy Caulkins" by the meet announcer,
bounced back from nearly missing the
200 IM finals after a relatively slow morn
ing swim.
"It has been a while since I've swum a
shorter IM." Griglione said of her
prelimary effort. "I just spun my wheels. I
wasn't grabbing any water."
An afternoon strategy session with
Haines straightened Griglione out.
though, and she edged the pre-meet fa
vorite and fastest qualifier. Beda Leirvaag
ot Arizona State, for the win. The next
riight she added the championship in the
400 IM.
Haines entered a whopping 1 1 swim
mers in the 200 IM. and the move paid off
as Stanford placed six in the top 24 and
qualified two more athletes, Monica

Nielebeck and Susannah Miller, for the
NCAAs.
Johnson, another member of Stan
ford's "walking wounded," shook off the
effects of the antibiotics she was taking
for a cold and streaked to victory in the 50
freestyle, while swimming legs on the
champion 200 medley. 800 freestyle. 400
medley and 400 freestyle relays over the
weekend.
One very formidable opponent stood in
Johnson's path to a butterfly victory,
though, as she resumed her rivalry with
Cal's Mary T. Meagher In the 100 Satur
day night. The race was a virtual carbon
copy of the pair's meeting in Berkeley two
weeks ago as Johnson went out fast only
to be overtaken by Meagher at the end.
"It's the typical Jenna-Mary T. race,
where she's out a little ahead of me and
I've got to run her down at the end," Meag
her said.
Meagher trained lightly in the fall and Is
leery of Johnson's potential. "I'm the one
that's quaking in my boots," said Meag
her. who later won the 200. "She has been
working out hard all year. She should ex
pect big time drops. I don't know if I'll
have the big time drops."

One swimmer who wasn't waiting for
the NCAAs for her time to drop was Stan
ford's Berzins. She entered the meet still
needing to qualify in the 200 freestyle and
ended up slashing her season best and
winning the event. Gillespie. Anderson
and Shupe followed in third through fifth
as the Cardinal dominated the race.
Stanford had also been expected to bury
the field in the 100 backstroke with the
top four times entering the meet.
However, when McLean was unable to
swim and Jenny Shannon was disquali
fied for failing to touch the wall on the
third turn in the preliminaries, only Jen
nifer Pokluda and Michelle Donahue
remained.
Donahue went to war with ASU's Steph
anie Lister and prevailed by .13 of a
second, while Pokluda copped third.
"1 knew Stephanie Lister would go out
fast." said Donahue, whose head was bob
bing up and down as she visibly strained
in the stretch dual. "I figured if I was with
her at the turn, I had a good chance of
beating her. The last 12 and a half yards
were pretty hard. I Just wanted to finish."
The expected Stanford back
stroke romp did materialize the
next night in the 200. The Card
inal placed five swimmers in the
championship heat, leading one
spectator to note, "It looks like
Stanford practice." Donahue won
again with a sparkling 1:59.33
that lowered her season best by
more than two seconds, and was
followed by teammates in second,
third, seventh and eighth.
Joining Berzins, Donahue and
the Cardinal's other Saturday
night champions was Susan Rapp
in the 100 breaststroke. Rapp
flashed home barely ahead of
ASU's Terri Baxter and was fol
lowed closely by teammate Jill
Johnson, who hit her cut with a
third-place finish. The trio dupli
cated this order of finish last
night also when a determined
Baxter was once again edged by
Rapp, this time in the 200
breaststroke.

Anderson opened Sunday's ac
tion by posting the morning's fast
est time in the 1,650 freestyle and
carving a whopping 37 seconds off
her season best, in an event in
which no preliminaries were con
tested.
Only two swimmers in the even
ing championship heat could bet
ter that time as USC's Leslie
Daland swamped the field and
Shupe finished comfortably in
second.
Perhaps the upset of the even
ing came in the 100 freestyle,
when Berzins surprised teammate
Jenna Johnson. The two were
neck-and-neck throughout and
held off a hard-charging Jenny
Susser of UCLA at the wall.
Berzins and Johnson formed a
devastating team in the meet's
concluding event, joining Miller
and McLean in the 400 freestyle
relay, and the Cardinal won going
away.
Meanwhile, down at the Univer
sity of Arizona, Stanford's Katie
Connors nabbed second in three
meter diving and a third off the
one-meter board.
