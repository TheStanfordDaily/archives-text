# Women netters pound SDSU

Freshman Valerie Wilson not only
plays at the bottom of the lineup, but
she is also the smallest player on the
Stanford women's tennis team. So it's
not surprising that the results of her
matches are overlooked at times.
Friday afternoon, however, with the
other five singles matches completed
and top-ranked Stanford holding a 4-1
edge over eighth-ranked San Diego State
at the Stanford Tennis Stadium, all eyes
focused on Wilson's No. 6 singles match
against the Aztecs' Sandra Mitchell.
The freshman responded, displaying
pressure tennis at its best, to clinch the
team win. Stanford, now 7-1 overall,
went on to win two of the three doubles
matches for a 7-2 victory.
Stanford Coach Frank Brennan said
that the importance of Wilson's win
could not be overemphasized. "Strange
things can happen in doubles," he said,
"especially when you expected to win in
singles."
After winning the first set 6-0, Wilson
lost the second by a 6-3 score and trailed
5-4 in the third set. She then fell behind
3-1 on her serve and faced triple match
point.
But the dynamic Wilson cooly won the
next three points and then broke
Mitchell's serve to take a 6-5 lead. The
match looked as though it might go to a
final-set tiebreaker when Mitchell went
up 3-2 on Wilson's serve, but Wilson
responded again, taking the next two
points to seal the victory.
"Valerie, I thought, played very well,"

Brennan said. "It was nice to see her
hang in there and play aggressively. It
makes everyone take notice."
Almost an hour earlier. Stanford
senior Stephanie Savides had polished
off SDSU's Anne Moeller 6-2, 6-3 in the
No. 2 singles match to put the Cardinal
on the scoreboard first. Savides'
forehand was lethal Friday as she
pounded winner after winner past the
frustrated Moeller.
"1 thought that was really nice for
Stephanie because she struggled in
Arizona," Brennan said.
Cardinal freshman Lisa Green contin
ued her impressive early-season play as
she rolled past the Aztecs' Michelle Apra
6-2, 6-2 in the No. 4 match. Green im
proved her dual-match singles record to
8-0 as she gave Stanford a 2-0 lead.
The Aztecs recorded their only singles
victory in the No. 3 match as Dana Bleic
her knocked off the Cardinal's Kay Tittle
6-4, 6-0. The loss was Tittle's second in
her past three outings, and it marked
the first time this season that a Stanford
player had been swept in a singles
match.
Patty Fendick was on the other end of
a sweep Friday, defeating SDSU's
Monique Javer 7-5, 6-2 to Increase the
Cardinal's lead to 3-1. The Stanford
senior has not lost a set in her last 13
collegiate singles matches and has won
34 in a row.
Javer was ranked No. 1 in the
preseason singles poll, but Fendick
(ranked fourth in the same poll) was
clearly the better player Friday. With the
score tied 5-5 in the first set, Fendick
won a 3-all point on her serve and then

broke Javer to take the set.
Fendlck's backhand was off-and-on
against Javer, but her forehand was as
powerful as usual, and she walked away
with the second set.
Stanford junior Cari Hagey was also a
winner in straight sets, but her 7-6, 6-2
victory at No. 5 singles took longer than
the score indicated. Hagey and SDSU's
Kristin Hill battled it out from the
baseline for nearly two hours before
Hagey prevailed.
Wilson carried the momentum she
had gained at the end of her singles
match into the No. 3 doubles match.
There, she teamed with Hagey to topple
Javer and Apra by a 6-1. 6-4 score. The
Stanford pair is now 8-0 on the season.
The Cardinal received another strong
effort from Fendick and Savides in the
No. 1 match. The seniors combined for a
6-2, 3-6, 6-3 win over Moeller and Jes
sica Buss.
Tittle and Green, however, stumbled
again at No. 2, losing 7-6 (10-8), 7-5 to
Hill and Mitchell to make the final team
score 7-2. The loss was the second
straight and third of the season for
Tittle and Green.
The Cardinal opens perhaps its tough
est week of the season Wednesday as
California visits the Stanford Tennis
Stadium for a 1:30 p.m. match. The
Bears were ranked fifth in the preseason
poll.
Saturday and Sunday, No. 6 Texas
and No. 4 Trinity will be in town for a
pair of matches. The Longhorns, who
have never played at Stanford, will play
at 1 p.m. Saturday, and the Trinity
match is scheduled for Sunday at noon.

Playing in the same lineup as defending NCAA champion Patty Fendick, Valerie Wilson
(above) may be a relative unknown, but the Cardinal freshman won a key singles match
Friday to clinch the Stanford women's tennis team's 7-2 victory over San Diego State.
