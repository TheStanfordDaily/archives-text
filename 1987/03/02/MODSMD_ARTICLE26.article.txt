## 
### EVAN TUCHINSKY Staff writer 
For the Stanford men's gymnastics team,
there seems to be an inverse proportion be
tween the amount of time remaining in its
season and how well the squad performs.
The Cardinal improved seven points in
seven days to earn a 277.85 Friday night in
Maples Pavilion against fourth-ranked
Fullerton State, keeping Stanford's NCAA
championship hopes alive.
Though the Titans, led by former Chinese
Olympian and world pommel horse cham
pion Li Xiao Ping, won the meet with an im
pressive 280.95, the competition marked a
victory for the struggling Stanford squad,
which had lost to the Titans one week ear
lier by a 10-point margin, 281.50 to 271.75.
"Even though it was a loss, it was like a
win to us," said junior Chuck Gerardo, who
finished second in the individual all-around
with a score of 56.60. "We won because we
went 277."
"Definitely I'm pleased," Stanford Coach
Sadao Hamada said. "I was looking for a
275 or so, and we scored three points
higher.
"It was a great team effort. I'm finally

seeing, as I predicted at the beginning of
the season, the team coming together," he
added.
The meet was marked by stellar perfor
mances by every gymnast on the team.
Junior captain Mike Matzek finished just
behind Gerardo at 55.65, and if not for a
poor showing on pommel horse could have
broken the Stanford all-around record.
"I low-lighted on side horse," Matzek said,
laughing. However, the rest of the meet
went smoothly in Matzek's estimation, not
only for him but for the rest of the team.
"I think each person realized their poten
tial." he said. "Things are going up. Obvi
ously we can improve. We fell off high bar a
lot. but we almost went 278."
In addition to Matzek, three other gym
nasts had "career meets." Sophomore Andy
Ropp and freshmen Charles Loop and Con
rad Voorsanger all had career-high scores
in the competition, earning 54.60, 54.25
and 55.05, respectively.
"Andy had an awesome meet." Matzek
said. "I can't think of anything he did poorly
on. He has been working hard, so he
deserved it."
"Basically, everyone performed their per

sonal best for this season," Hamada added.
Fullerton also had a fine competition, and
not just due to Li Xiao Ping. Though Ll
scored a 9.9 on pommel horse. 9.8 on paral
lel bars and 9.75 on high bar, teammate Eli
Rodriguez proved to be a strong weapon as
well, winning the all-around with a 56.90.

"Fullerton looked good in almost all of the
events," Gerardo said.
Nonetheless, Stanford clearly has reaped
the benefits of this clash with the Titans.
"We're stoked," Voorsanger said. "We hit.
and that's what we had to do and have to do
in the next five meets."
