"It was a rough weekend for the
old Cardinal," Stanford Women's
Gymnastics Coach Homer Sar
dina said, describing the Card
inal's loss at Arizona to the
Wildcats and the Washington
"Huskies. Stanford finished the
meet third with a 179.65 team
score, behind Arizona at 188.6
and Washington at 184.25.
Wildcat Mary Kay Brown won
the all-around with a 38.05, an
average of over 9.5 on each event.
The meet was bleak for Stanford
from the very start. The team
began the competition on bars,
and a series of falls put the team at
43.25 after the first rotation. The
remainder of the meet was spent
trying to catch up and garner a re
spectable finish.
As was the case last week, ill
ness struck the Cardinal squad,
this time hitting three of the top
five gymnasts on the team. "We're
not using illness as an excuse, but
we were damn sick," Sardina said.
