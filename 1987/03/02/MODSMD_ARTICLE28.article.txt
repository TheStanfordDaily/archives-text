# Gash vaults 17 feet in outdoor opener

### ERIK STEN Editorial staff 
As he boarded the team bus re
turning from San Jose State this
weekend, Stanford Asst. Track
Coach Scott Chisam was probably
smiling.
After coming to Stanford from
UCLA this year, Chisam did not
know quite what to expect from
this year's edition of Cardinal
track. The San Jose State Relays
being the first outdoor meet of the
season for Stanford and most of
the other Northern California
schools, Saturday was the coach's
first chance to see exactly what he
had.
Needless to say, Chisam came
home pleased.
Team results were not kept in
San Jose, so it was hard to tell ex
actly how Stanford stacked up
against Its neighboring schools.
One thing that wasn't hard to
diagnose, however, was the per
formance of three individuals:
John Gash, Erica Wheeler and
Henry Green.
That trio had Chisam excited.
The reasons: Gash set a new
school record in the pole vault
with a mark of 17 feet. Wheeler,
the national high school record
holder in the javelin, returned
from a 14-month shoulder injury
to win her specialty with a toss of
167-5. And redshirt sophomore
Green, who sat out last year to
concentrate on his wide receiver
position in football, placed second
in the longjump at 24-11 and 1/2.
Wheeler and Green are now "two
new cards" in the hands of the
coaches, Chisam said. As for
Gash, "He was just incredible."

Gash's jump eclipsed a 20-year
old mark set by Jim Eshelman at
16-11 and 1/4 In 1967. As the
meet began, though, a record did
not seem likely. After the junior's
first two jumps, Stanford Asst.
Coach Dorothy Doolittle was not
pleased.
But then something clicked and
the junior "started going higher
and higher," Doolittle said. Now
she thinks that Gash has the po
tential to go higher still. "Just a
few things yet to iron out and he
can get 17-6," she said.
Green also is looking forward to
improvement. After missing his
best high-school mark by an Inch
this weekend, the sophomore was
more than optimistic about his
season outlook.
"I've got some major changes to
make in my technique," Green
said. "If It works out, I could im
prove by two feet." With the NCAA
qualifying standard only seven
inches away from his current
mark, a jump of that caliber would
make Green a threat to place at
nationals.
For Wheeler, the main battle will
be with her shoulder. Saturday's
meet was the freshman's first shot
at actually throwing in 14
months. She won, but the real
results will come in the next week
as she assesses the competition's
effect on her shoulder.
"If she can come out of the meet
okay, she'll be in good shape,"
Stanford Asst. Coach Dave Wol
lman said. "It's just real good to
have her throw."
The meet's only disappointment
for Stanford was the men's sprint
relay team. The sprinters ran well,
finishing fourth in 42.1, but the

effort was marred by bad handoffs
that cost the group a chance at
finishing higher.
Gus Envela, a member of the
relay, was not too worried. The
freshman chalked the mistakes
up to the group's relative inexperi
ence running together.
Other notable performances for
the Cardinal came from Glenn
Schneider. David Pickett and
Vanessa Henlon. Henlon finished
second in the triple jump at 38-2,
a jump that bettered her personal
record by five inches, and was
second in the long jump as well
with a leap of 18-2 and 1/2.

Schneider was third in the dis
cus at IR9-10, and Pickett un
leashed a good early-season javelin
toss of 199-10. Also third for the
Cardinal was the distance medley
team of Envela, Dave Ratliff, Mi
chael Lauer and Steve Schadler,
which finished in 13:28.
Overall, Chisam was satisfied
with how the team looked. Com
paring the actual results to what
he had anticipated, Chisam said,
"I think we looked a little better
than we (the coaches) expected.
"It's a good start. Now we have a
couple of weeks to relax and get
ready for our opener," he added.

After taking time off last season to concentrate on football, Stanford
sophomore Henry Green has returned to the long jump with a ven
geance this year, soaring a personal-best 24-11 and 1/2 Saturday at
the San Jose State Relays.
