### ROBERT PORTNOY Staff writer 
"We had a terrific tourna
ment on a very tough golf
course with a real strong field.
We played with some maturity
this weekend and got more con
sistent with each round. 1 felt
after the Arizona Intercollegiate
we'd play well the rest of the
year, and this tournament is a
good indication of that," Stan
ford Women's Golf Coach Tim
Baldwin said following yester
day's final round of the Patty
Sheehan Intercollegiate in Fort
Ord.
The No. 14 Cardinal shot 926
to finish fourth in a field that
Baldwin estimated had 12 of
the top 17 teams in the
country. Host San Jose State
won the event with a three-day
total of 910, defeating USC by
five shots and Furman by 11.
"At this stage of the season,
with the ranked teams that
finished around us, I was really
pleased. That's the level we're
capable of playing at. It should
be a real confidence-booster for
our team, and I'm looking for a
strong finish this year,"
Baldwin said.
On the 6,100-yard, par-72
Bayonet Course, which
Baldwin called "the toughest
golf course we play all year," the
Cardinal found itself in third
place after shooting an
opening-round 307, just four
shots behind leader USC and
two behind second-place UCLA.
The Bayonet layout, which

has a frightening 75.7 rating,
was unusually tame in Satur
day's second round. The Card
inal kept up its pace, firing a
308, but the tournament pace
left it behind, as SJSU surged
in front with a 605 total. USC
sat in second at 607, with Fur
man at 609 and Oklahoma
State tied with Stanford at 615.
"We did slide a little in the
second round, and just a little
today, but we held onto fourth
place. If we would've played ex
tremely well today, we would've
challenged SJSU and finished
ahead of USC, but we didn't.
We did beat ASU and Oklahoma
State, two teams we love to
beat." Baldwin said,
ASU finished fifth, two
strokes behind Stanford and
one ahead of Oklahoma State.
Cardinal senior Kathleen
McCarthy shot 227 to tie with
three other players for fifth
place in the individual competi
tion. U.S. International Univer
sity senior Laurette Maritz, a
three-year first-team All-
American and, in Baldwin's
words, "a certain All-American
for the fourth year in a row,"
won the individual title with a
221, two better than SJSU's
Dana Lofland. Dottie Mochrie
of Furman and Anne Jones of
San Jose shot 226.
Juniors Kay Cornelius and
Trish McGonigle each shot 234
for the Cardinal, sophomore
Clare Dolan posted a 236 and
senior Adrienne Gilmartin
came in at 242.
