# Alpha Delt house reforming
## 
### CLAY CALVERT Staff writer 
Last spring, with its future as a
housed fraternity jeopardized by a his
tory of in-house drug use and dealing.
Alpha Delta Phi became the focus of Uni
versity attention about student drug
use. Less than a year later, the frater
nity's reputation as a drug house appar
ently is disappearing, due in part to a
unique compact with the University and
a large influx of new residents.
That compact, the first of its kind at
the University, required returning resi
dents and Alpha Delt pledges to sign an

agreement that essentially establishes a
drug-free house. Members of the frater
nity not only are pledged to refrain from
in-house drug use, but also to turn in
other house members using drugs.
According to University officials, the
agreement seems to be working, and the
problems that once plagued the frater
nity appear to have been reduced.
"I think that house has really done a
turnaround since last year," said Norm
Robinson, associate dean of student af
fairs for Residential Education.
"The dramatic nature of what they're
doing has indicated that it's not going to

be a drug house anymore," Robinson
said.
Fraternal Affairs Adviser Joe Pisano
agreed with Robinson's assessment of
the fraternity this year, noting "a real
turnaround" in the house.
A real turnaround in the residential
structure of the house at 375 Campus
Drive, from that of a fraternity to a
residence filled through the Draw, could
have taken place had fraternity mem
bers not agreed to sign the agreement
and abide by it.
"It was that (sign the agreement) or
lose the house." said Diana Con
klin, assistant dean of Student Af
fairs and director of the Row. The
compact was offered to the frater
nity last spring.
According to Steve Cox. Alpha
Delt resident assistant, the agree
ment "seems to be working very
well."
Cox said that he has not seen
drugs used in the house this year.
A large influx of new residents
has also helped the fraternity
change its 'mage, according to
Cox and Smith, Alpha Delt
president.
The Initiation of 29 new Alpha
Delts this year has given the
house "a very different crowd than
that that had been in the house
the past few years," Cox said.
Smith, a junior who lived in the
house last year, noted that the fra
ternity "rushed a much wider vari
ety of people" last spring.
According to Eric Jacobsen,
past president of the Kappa Alpha
fraternity — neighbors to the Al
pha Delts — the picture at the Al
pha Delts has changed since last
year.
"As far as I know it's working,"
Jacobsen said, adding that several
of his friends at the Alpha Delts
have told him about positive
changes in the house.
