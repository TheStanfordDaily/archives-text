# Profs, call Iran report misleading

The Tower commission report released Thursday
only begins to put the pieces together in the puzzle
behind the Iran-contra affair, according to several
Stanford professors.
"I think more information will come out." said His
tory Prof. Barton Bernstein, referring to memos
mentioned only briefly in the report that indicate the
president had knowledge of the affair "early on."
Such memos could be "explosive." according to Po
litical Science Prof. John Manley.
"The jury is still out on this." Manley said, noting
that the basic problem of the report is that "it blames
everything on his (Reagan's) assistants."
Bernstein agreed, stating that the report gives the
president a "second life," shifting blame for the
covert arms deal away from the president to his ad
visers. Because the Tower commission was ap
pointed by the president, "it predictably assailed his
staff. It allows the press to focus on staff changes (in
the administration) but that requires the belief that
the staff didn't fully inform the president," he said.
Manley said the report "has so far been supportive
of the president," noting that "it has been seen as a
report that establishes that Reagan didn't know
what was going on and displays his ignorance, and
invites people to conclude that he's not responsible.
So to that extent, the report is exonerating him."
According to Hubert Marshall, professor emeritus
of political science, "The report clearly undermines
the public confidence in the president, but only
slightly more than it already has been.
"The Tower report has focused the charges against
Ronald Reagan in terms of bad management, that
Chief of Staff Donald Regan didn't keep him well
enough informed, and you get a picture of bumbling
and incompetence and that is partly misleading."
Marshall said.
It is that picture of incompetence that "offered the
president a form of institutional repentance,"
Bernstein said, explaining that the report was
"literally predictable" in partially absolving the presi
dent of responsibility.
"I think there is a certain amount of incompetence
but another way of looking at it is that any president
sets a tone for his administration and there's no way
that even the most competent, president can keep
