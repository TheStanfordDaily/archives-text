A changing of the guard took place over the
weekend as the Band selected new Dollies and
debuted the new Tree at Saturday's men's basketball
game.
Ending a nearly monthlong selection process, the
Band chose sophomore Dee Cohen and freshmen
Patty Flam, Anne Chun, Shelly Gin and Ashley
McLain as the new Dollies. Last Wednesday, the
Band also selected junior Brendan Kelly as the new
Tree.
The five Dollies were picked from an original group
of 33. Kelly was chosen from a pool of 26 applicants.
"I'm looking forward to next year." Cohen said.
"It's a nice feeling having it all in front of us."
The original 33 were narrowed to 18 candidates by
former Dollies, some of whom last danced on the
Farm in the 1 950 sand '60s.
"They're very interested in how the group is going
to be in the future." said John Manion. assistant
manager of the Band.
The 18 then auditioned for the Band Saturday
morning, when 10 were selected to be interviewed.
From those 10. five were chosen.
"I just feel really lucky (to have been selected)," Gin
said. "The last 10 girls were really great dancers and
they were really nice."
The new Dollies will learn the five traditional Dollie
routines and will each choreograph their portion of
35 other routines.
"The personality of the group is reflected in the
routine," explained Flam. "We'll sort of have a differ
ent look and a different style (than last year's
Dollies)."
The position of Dollie might be considered some
what controversial, the women agreed, as some
people perceive the Dollies merely as sex symbols.
"That's not the reason we're doing it," said Cohen.
According to McLain, "It (the controversy) makes it
that much more rewarding because you question
why you are doing something. We can t be ignorant
of the fact that people may have opinions like that,
but it may not be our main concern. . . . The contro
versy makes you more secure about your own deci
sion."
"There are enough people that appreciate [the

Dollies) for the quality of their per
formance," Flam explained.
"Whatever you're doing,
whatever position you're in, there
will always be some kind of con
flict. . . . You just have to go with
it. You just have to go on." Chun
added.
The group is not superfluous
either. Chun said. "I hope that by
the end of the year more people
will realize we are an important
part of the Band."
Kelly, the new Tree, is a civil en
gineering major. He was notified
of his new position when the Band
came to his room at 1 a.m.
Thursday to serenade him.
"1 was blown away." he said. "It
was one of my greater moments at
Stanford when the Band showed
up at my front door."
Kelly said he plans to make the
Tree thicker, taller, "more belliger
ent. more male, a little sexist." He
described his tree as a combina
tion of "Pee Wee Herman and the
San Diego Chicken."
"If I could make a few people
laugh and if I could make a few
people dance to the music then
that would be my great success."
he added. "Rarely have I been this
excited about something while
here on the Farm."
