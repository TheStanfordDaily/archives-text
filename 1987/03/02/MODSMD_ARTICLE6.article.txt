Despite the fact that its only
car is still an empty chassis,
the Stanford Solar Car Project
is rolling along nicely.
The students participating in
the project are under the direc
tion of project adviser John
Reuyl, the resident fellow of
Schiff House. The group
recently submitted a proposal
to the California Energy Com
mission seekin a major grant
to enable it to design and
manufacture a state-of-the-art
hybrid automobile as part of an

integrated transportation and
solar residence system.
The hybrid car would utilize
both a small internal combus
tion gasoline engine and
electric power in a system de
signed for maximum fuel effi
ciency without sacrificing over
all power or driving range. Ac
cording to the proposal, the gas
engine would provide the
relatively low horsepower needs
of constant speed cruising,
while the electric motors — one
placed at each wheel — would
provide extra power on deiaand
