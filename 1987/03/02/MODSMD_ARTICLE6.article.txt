# Solar car project is speeding along
## FEATURES 
### BOBBY ARNSDORF 
Despite the fact that its only
car is still an empty chassis,
the Stanford Solar Car Project
is rolling along nicely.
The students participating in
the project are under the direc
tion of project adviser John
Reuyl, the resident fellow of
Schiff House. The group
recently submitted a proposal
to the California Energy Com
mission seekin a major grant
to enable it to design and
manufacture a state-of-the-art
hybrid automobile as part of an

integrated transportation and
solar residence system.
The hybrid car would utilize
both a small internal combus
tion gasoline engine and
electric power in a system de
signed for maximum fuel effi
ciency without sacrificing over
all power or driving range. Ac
cording to the proposal, the gas
engine would provide the
relatively low horsepower needs
of constant speed cruising,
while the electric motors — one
placed at each wheel — would
provide extra power on deiaand
for rapid acceleration or hill climbing.
According to Junior Charlie Moore, a member of
the project group, building the car is a challenge.
"It's really exciting in that it puts this group of stu
dents on the same level as the big research compan
ies and actual car manufacturers." he said. "We're
doing the same things they are in researching new
technologies."
Though hybrid vehicles have been built before,
this proposed system — which the group hopes to
start building next fall quarter — will combine
several recent technological advances that put the
Solar Car Project on the cutting edge of this field.
Included among these advances are regenerative
braking, sodium-sulphur batteries and the four
wheel independent electric drive system. These in
novations would make for an exceedingly energy
efficient vehicle that would double as a fine driving
car.
In a regenerative braking system, the energy lost
by the wheels as the brakes slow their rotation is par
tially recaptured by an electric generator and used to
recharge the batteries for future use instead of allow
ing all the energy to dissipate as heat.
Sodium-sulphur batteries have just come into
commercial production and have the advantage of
being able to store the same amount of electricity in a
battery weighing one third as much as conventional
lead-acid car batteries. This reduced weight also con
tributes to fuel efficiency.
Excellent handling due to the application of wheel
torque exactly where needed would be a major bene
fit of having a small electric motor at each wheel. A
central computer would channel the driver's inputs
from the steering wheel and accelerator into individ
ual control of each motor.
Eventually the prototype would be used in con

junction with a solar house, where photovoltaic cells
atop the residence would collect solar energy not only
for the house but for recharging the hybrid car's bat
teries as well.
Reuyl noted that since transportation and dwell
ings are responsible for half of California's energy
usage, such a system — if widely utilized — could
well serve as a practical means of dealing with the
impending depletion of the fossil fuels that currently
provide most of California's energy.
Other plans for the future were discussed in Janu
ary as members of the Solar Car Project met with ap
proximately 30 members of the Electric Automobile
Association (EAA) to discuss ways in which the two
organizations can work to "promote the electric vehi
cle as a viable means of transportation in today's
world."
In support of this goal, the Stanford group will
host a major rally of electric vehicles (EVs) on
campus in May in conjunction with the University's
centennial celebration. The University community
and the general public will have an opportunity to
view and travel in EVs belonging to EAA members.
One of the showpieces of the rally will be a 1980
Chevette that the students are currently converting
from internal combustion to electric power. This
conversion Is funded by National Semiconductor and
the EAA.
One design problem facing the Chevette conver
sion team concerns battery placement. Rather than
placing the 13 six-volt drive batteries in the back
seat, the students hope to squeeze them into the
trunk area and under the hood.
According to EAA member and technical adviser
Clarence Ellers, to improve the public image of
electric cars the group needs "a car that'll carry some
people."
Converting the Chevette to electric power without
sacrificing passenger space will hopefully enable the

Solar Car Project members to show the public the
current technical and functional feasibility of electric
autos. Although with only an eight-horsepower
motor the car will be best suited for local driving, it
could hit 55 mph for short bursts, according to
Reuyl.
The converted car will have a range of about 50
miles between battery charges, and will have a very
smooth ride due to the small electric motor, he
added.
And the most appealing aspect of this project is
that the car will travel down the road producing no
environmentally deleterious exhaust fumes, Reuyl
pointed out.
Electric vehicles are "a means of transportation to
be used in a certain way," according to EAA member
Leonard Byers, and the student-converted electric
Chevette will be no different.
But proponents of electric cars, such as those
working on the Solar Car Project and members of the

the EAA, have a difficult task awaiting them in sel
ling the American public on their concept. Despite
the fact that no major technical limitations curtail
the widespread introduction and use of EVs, public
acceptance of them here has been slow.
In Germany, however, Volkswagen does produce a
battery-powered version of some models for sale to
the public, according to Dr. Gary Schweitzer, a visit
ing professor in mechanical engineering from the
University of Zurich. Schweitzer is advising the stu
dents on the project.
Though more expensive than their gasoline or die
sel competitors, the cars have achieved popularity in
Europe, Schweitzer said.
And though the initial expenditure is at present
greater for an EV than for a comparable internal
combustion vehicle, the long-term usage and main
tenance costs are substantially less, Schweitzer
added.
