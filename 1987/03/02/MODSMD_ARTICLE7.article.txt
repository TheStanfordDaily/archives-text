American condom makers
barely outdistanced their
Japanese competitors in Stan
ford's first condom rating contest
held Feb. 17 to 20 by the Stanford
AIDS Education Project.
The project announced last
Thursday that the Gold Circle con
dom, manufactured by the Circle
Rubber Company of Newark, N.J.,
was voted as the best overall con
dom and as the easiest to use.
Fuji Latex, a Japanese condom
maker, captured the most awards.
Fuji's Yamabuki No. 1 came out
on top for best feel, best taste and
smell and best-looking, while the
company's "Blacky" won most ver

satile â€” formal wear to swim
wear.
The titles were awarded accord
ing to votes cast on ballots in
cluded in a condom packet dis
tributed to students Feb. 17 and
18 in White Plaza. The packet in
cluded seven different condoms,
information sheets and an official
ballot.
A total of 6,300 condorns were
distributed in two hours. The
original 500 packets intended to
be used for the two-day promotion
were gone within the first hour of
distribution on Feb. 17. An addi
tional 400 packets were as
sembled that night and handed
out at noon the next day.
According to senior Meg Rich
man. one of the packet dis
tributors and a member of the
project, "The response was great.
At 12:10 our sign was down and
still hundreds of students came by
asking, 'Where are the condoms?
Where are the condoms? Are they
gone already?' "
Some criticism arose from stu
dents who said the three-day
deadline for inspection, testing
and return of the surveys was too
short. According to senior Ken
Ruebush, coordinator of the proj
ect and the condom giveaway, one
student complained about the fact
that he had "seven condoms to try
in three days. Around here that is
a year's supply."
Daniel Bao, another distribu
tion organizer and member of the
project, said the impression that
participants were supposed to test
the condom samples in sexual ac
tivity was unintentional. "We
didn't mean for participants to
have to actually 'field test' them,
but test them in more creative
ways.
"We wanted people to use their
imaginations, to try them on cer
tain vegetables, bananas, small
cucumbers. Use them as water
balloons. Be creative," Bao said
