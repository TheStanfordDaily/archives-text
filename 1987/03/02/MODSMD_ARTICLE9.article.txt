Gales to withdraw as CIA nominee
WASHINGTON — Robert Gates will withdraw as President
Reagan's nominee as director of central intelligence this week, ac
cording to well-informed administration and congressional
sources.
One of these sources said Gates had arrived at the decision
"without much prodding" in the wake of warnings from Republi
can congressional leaders that his nomination was likely to be
rejected by the Senate.
The Republican leaders, four of whom met with Reagan on
Friday, said the fight over Gates' confirmation on the Senate floor
would focus additional attention on the Iran-contra affair at the
same time that the administration is trying to make a fresh start
with a new White House team headed by former Sen. Howard
Baker, R-Tenn.
"Quickly, it must be done quickly," said one well-placed source.
"Gates is a negative symbol and the situation at the CIA is critical
and has to be transformed into a positive symbol."
Reagan disturbed by Tower report
WASHINGTON — Presidential counselor David Abshire said yes
terday that President Reagan was "deeply disturbed by the impli
cations" of the Tower commission report and that the panel's find
ings are having "a very constructive effect" on him.
Abshire, who was present when the Tower board presented its
report to Reagan last week, said in an interview that the president
was "shaken by some of the findings" and predicted that he would
deal directly and personally with the issue when he addresses the
nation on television Wednesday night.
One of Reagan's closest friends, former Sen. Paul Laxalt, R-Nev.,
publicly urged him yesterday to 'get his head and gut squarely
into this operation and stay on top of it"in an effort to rebuild his
presidency.
Meanwhile, the chairman of the Tower commission and one of
its members said there was no evidence that a key memorandum
in the case ever reached the president.
The undated and unsigned memo was written by Lt. Col. Oliver
North, the fired National Security Council aide, to Vice Adm. John
Poindexter, Reagan's former national security adviser. In the
memo, North outlined plans for the sale of arms to Iran in ex
change for the release of American hostages in Lebanon and said
that #12 million in "residual funds" from the sale would be used to
aid the Nicaraguan contra rebels.
Baker plans to rebuild credibility
WASHINGTON — An advance party for former Senate majority
leader Howard Baker began moving into the White House Satur
day, as Baker laid plans for a staff meeting this morning to begin
rebuilding morale and credibility shattered by the Iran-contra
scandal.
Baker aides Thomas Griscom and James Cannon spent several
hours with members of the president's staff at the executive man
sion, laying the groundwork for the former Tennessee Senator to
assume his duties as Ronald Reagan's top lieutenant.
Cannon told reporters Saturday afternoon the discussions
during the day had been"the beginning of learning about how the
White House works and how to serve the president."
The immediate goal, he said, was to find "how to improve the
process of information getting to the president."
His remark alluded to a theme that wound its way throughout
the devastating Tower commission report on the Iran-contra
scandal — that under resigned Chief of Staff Donald Regan, the
White House and national security staffs had failed to inform the
president of the perils of the ill-fated arms-for-hostage deal.
Europe welcomes Soviet proposal
BONN, West Germany — Several Western European govern
ments yesterday welcomed a new Soviet proposal to negotiate a
separate arms control agreement for medium-range missiles
despite misgivings that such a pact could create military and poli
tical dilemmas for the European allies.
The West German, Belgian and Danish governments, and NATO
Secretary General Lord Carrington, praised Saturday's Soviet of
fer as a significant breakthrough. They said that it opened the
way for a pact embodying the so-called "zero option," providing for
the removal of all U.S. and Soviet medium-range, nuclear missiles
from Europe.
Britain. Italy and the Netherlands said that they still were study
ing the proposal. A British official said privately, however, that the
offer was "encouraging" because it suggested that Moscow was
willing to bargain seriously.
The French government, and officials in several other countries,
emphasized that any agreement on medium-range missiles must
take into account Western European desires for limits on shorter
range missiles.
NATO's commander, U.S. Gen. Bernard Rogers, echoed such
doubts, saying that the allies would be "mad" to give up medium
range missiles without reductions in short-range missiles and
conventional forces, in which the Soviets retain an edge.
Hungary faces economic problems
BUDAPEST, Hungary — There are growing signs that the vet
eran communist leadership of Janos Kadar, gripped by uncer
tainty in the face of a deteriorating economic situation, has en
tered a decline that could threaten Hungary's widely watched
reforms of socialism and shake its political stability.
Only six months ago. Kadar. 74. basked in international atten
tion as Hungary marked the 30th anniversary of the anticom
munist uprising and subsequent Soviet invasion that brought
him to power.
From the perspective of three decades. Kadar could boast of
leading Hungary from an era of brutal repression to economic and
political reforms that have made it one of the freest and most
prosperous of communist-ruled nations.
Nevertheless. Kadar's successes, and modest popularity among
Hungary's 10 million people, have been threatened by several
years of economic stagnation and the resulting social unrest.
As the problems have worsened, the communist leader's cau
tious. consensus-oriented style of leadership has seemed unable
to cope with the political and economic dilemmas the economic
reform and accompanying stagnation have raised.
Uncertainty awaits freed prisoners
MOSCOW — As freed political prisoners trickle out of camps
and prisons, they come home to an uncertain role in Mikhail Gor
bachev's Soviet Union.
The old human rights movement of the 1970s was broken up by
waves of arrests. Now waves of releases are putting those same
people back in place, but in a new context.
For some of the returning prisoners, the era of democratization
and openness proclaimed by Gorbachev is intriguing, even Invit
ing. The question remains whether authorities are now prepared
to tolerate the views for which these prisoners were convicted a
few years ago.
"If Andrei Sakharov. Sergei Grigorvants. and others have the
possibility to talk about their ideas in the kind of openness Gorba
chev is calling for. then the development of this society will be on
the right path." said Lev Timofeyev, released last month from a
labor camp after serving two years of a six-year sentence.

One of these sources said Gates had arrived at the decision
"without much prodding" in the wake of warnings from Republi
can congressional leaders that his nomination was likely to be
rejected by the Senate.
The Republican leaders, four of whom met with Reagan on
Friday, said the fight over Gates' confirmation on the Senate floor
would focus additional attention on the Iran-contra affair at the
same time that the administration is trying to make a fresh start
with a new White House team headed by former Sen. Howard
Baker, R-Tenn.
"Quickly, it must be done quickly," said one well-placed source.
"Gates is a negative symbol and the situation at the CIA is critical
and has to be transformed into a positive symbol."
Reagan disturbed by Tower report
WASHINGTON — Presidential counselor David Abshire said yes
terday that President Reagan was "deeply disturbed by the impli
cations" of the Tower commission report and that the panel's find
ings are having "a very constructive effect" on him.
Abshire, who was present when the Tower board presented its
report to Reagan last week, said in an interview that the president
was "shaken by some of the findings" and predicted that he would
deal directly and personally with the issue when he addresses the
nation on television Wednesday night.
One of Reagan's closest friends, former Sen. Paul Laxalt, R-Nev.,
publicly urged him yesterday to 'get his head and gut squarely
into this operation and stay on top of it"in an effort to rebuild his
presidency.
Meanwhile, the chairman of the Tower commission and one of
its members said there was no evidence that a key memorandum
in the case ever reached the president.
The undated and unsigned memo was written by Lt. Col. Oliver
North, the fired National Security Council aide, to Vice Adm. John
Poindexter, Reagan's former national security adviser. In the
memo, North outlined plans for the sale of arms to Iran in ex
change for the release of American hostages in Lebanon and said
that #12 million in "residual funds" from the sale would be used to
aid the Nicaraguan contra rebels.
Baker plans to rebuild credibility
WASHINGTON — An advance party for former Senate majority
leader Howard Baker began moving into the White House Satur
day, as Baker laid plans for a staff meeting this morning to begin
rebuilding morale and credibility shattered by the Iran-contra
scandal.
Baker aides Thomas Griscom and James Cannon spent several
hours with members of the president's staff at the executive man
sion, laying the groundwork for the former Tennessee Senator to
assume his duties as Ronald Reagan's top lieutenant.
Cannon told reporters Saturday afternoon the discussions
during the day had been"the beginning of learning about how the
White House works and how to serve the president."
The immediate goal, he said, was to find "how to improve the
process of information getting to the president."
His remark alluded to a theme that wound its way throughout
the devastating Tower commission report on the Iran-contra
scandal — that under resigned Chief of Staff Donald Regan, the
White House and national security staffs had failed to inform the
president of the perils of the ill-fated arms-for-hostage deal.
Europe welcomes Soviet proposal
BONN, West Germany — Several Western European govern
ments yesterday welcomed a new Soviet proposal to negotiate a
separate arms control agreement for medium-range missiles
despite misgivings that such a pact could create military and poli
tical dilemmas for the European allies.
The West German, Belgian and Danish governments, and NATO
Secretary General Lord Carrington, praised Saturday's Soviet of
fer as a significant breakthrough. They said that it opened the
way for a pact embodying the so-called "zero option," providing for
the removal of all U.S. and Soviet medium-range, nuclear missiles
from Europe.
Britain. Italy and the Netherlands said that they still were study
ing the proposal. A British official said privately, however, that the
offer was "encouraging" because it suggested that Moscow was
willing to bargain seriously.
The French government, and officials in several other countries,
emphasized that any agreement on medium-range missiles must
take into account Western European desires for limits on shorter
range missiles.
NATO's commander, U.S. Gen. Bernard Rogers, echoed such
doubts, saying that the allies would be "mad" to give up medium
range missiles without reductions in short-range missiles and
conventional forces, in which the Soviets retain an edge.
Hungary faces economic problems
BUDAPEST, Hungary — There are growing signs that the vet
eran communist leadership of Janos Kadar, gripped by uncer
tainty in the face of a deteriorating economic situation, has en
tered a decline that could threaten Hungary's widely watched
reforms of socialism and shake its political stability.
Only six months ago. Kadar. 74. basked in international atten
tion as Hungary marked the 30th anniversary of the anticom
munist uprising and subsequent Soviet invasion that brought
him to power.
From the perspective of three decades. Kadar could boast of
leading Hungary from an era of brutal repression to economic and
political reforms that have made it one of the freest and most
prosperous of communist-ruled nations.
Nevertheless. Kadar's successes, and modest popularity among
Hungary's 10 million people, have been threatened by several
years of economic stagnation and the resulting social unrest.
As the problems have worsened, the communist leader's cau
tious. consensus-oriented style of leadership has seemed unable
to cope with the political and economic dilemmas the economic
reform and accompanying stagnation have raised.
Uncertainty awaits freed prisoners
MOSCOW — As freed political prisoners trickle out of camps
and prisons, they come home to an uncertain role in Mikhail Gor
bachev's Soviet Union.
The old human rights movement of the 1970s was broken up by
waves of arrests. Now waves of releases are putting those same
people back in place, but in a new context.
For some of the returning prisoners, the era of democratization
and openness proclaimed by Gorbachev is intriguing, even Invit
ing. The question remains whether authorities are now prepared
to tolerate the views for which these prisoners were convicted a
few years ago.
"If Andrei Sakharov. Sergei Grigorvants. and others have the
possibility to talk about their ideas in the kind of openness Gorba
chev is calling for. then the development of this society will be on
the right path." said Lev Timofeyev, released last month from a
labor camp after serving two years of a six-year sentence.

Gales to withdraw as CIA nominee
WASHINGTON — Robert Gates will withdraw as President
Reagan's nominee as director of central intelligence this week, ac
cording to well-informed administration and congressional
