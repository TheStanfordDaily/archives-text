# Rosse questions Campbell

### TODD PIERCE Staff writer 
Acting University President
James Rosse has written a letter
to Hoover Institution Director W.
Glenn Campbell, who is also direc
tor of the Reagan Presidential
Foundation, asking Campbell to
inform him of the foundation's
plans for the location of the pro
posed Ronald Reagan Public Af
fairs Center, the policy arm of the
Reagan Library.
The library's public affairs cen
ter was originally slated to be part
of the Reagan Library complex in
the foothills west of campus.
However, University President
Donald Kennedy decided in 1983
that the independent and possibly
partisan public affairs center
should not be located on Univer
sity land.
Rosse wrote the letter to
Campbell late last week in order to
find out where the foundation
plans to put the public affairs cen
ter. He mentioned that "there had
been questions about its location
in the Faculty Senate."
"We haven't heard what the
plans are for the public policy cen
ter," said Rosse. "I asked would he
be willing to inform me what the
foundation's plan for the policy
center is. Members of the Faculty
Senate asked if it is known where
it's going to be."
Campbell declined to comment.
In 1983, the University initially
agreed to allow both the Reagan
Library and the affiliated policy
center on campus under the con
dition that the University retain
ultimate authority over both insti
tutions. The Reagan Library
Foundation, however, announced
jurisdiction.
"The University offered a loca
tion for both the library and
public affairs center but only if the
public affairs center," became a
part of University government,
Rosse said.
Charles Palm, liaison between
the foundation and Stanford, and
head librarian and archivist at
Hoover, said that plans for the
policy center have "hardly
developed at all" but "we are
raising some money."
Rosse said that a Feb. 19 Fac
ulty Senate resolution criticizing
Campbell for comments he made
in a forward to the Hoover Institu
tion's 1986 Annual Report did not
affect his decision to write the let
ter.
In the foreword, Campbell wrote
that "not only Hoover but the
entire University can now boast of
a Reagan connection."
