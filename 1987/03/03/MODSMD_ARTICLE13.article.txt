The Tower commission report hit the
Reagan White House with the force of a tided
wave, and the damage it left is only begin
ning to be repaired by the administration.
President Reagan shored up his administra
tion considerably with the appointment of
former Senate Majority Leader Howard Baker
as chief of staff, and he can further steer the
country — and the world — toward more
placid waters by acting now to slow the arms
race in Europe.
Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev said Sat
urday that the Soviet Union would accept an
agreement to eliminate all medium-range
nuclear missiles in Europe within five years.
The administration should move quickly to
reach an agreement on this proposal. The of
fer represents a heartening thaw in
U.S./Soviet relations and presents a real op
portunity for a meaningful reduction of the
nuclear arsenal in Europe.
The proposal has three basic elements:
□ The elimination of all medium-range
missiles from Europe.
□ The creation of separate limits for shorter
range European missiles.
□ The establishment of an upper limit of 100
warheads on medium-range Soviet missiles
in Asia.
Although some problems still remain —
such as the question of exactly how many

short-range missiles each country would be
able to deploy in Europe — both U.S. and So
viet diplomats agree they are minor points.
Agreement that the proposal is a good one
is nearly universal. Members of the adminis
tration have expressed hope that the United
States and the Soviet Union would move
quickly to reach an accord, saying that the
offer presents Reagan with a much-needed
chance to act decisively on foreign policy and
keeps open the possibility of future arms
control agreements.
In Europe, officials have welcomed the So
viet offer. NATO Secretary General Lord Car
rington praised the proposed pact as a signif
icant breakthrough, and the West German,
Belgian and Danish governments also have
voiced support for the offer. Britain, Italy and
the Netherlands have not officially com
mented on the proposal, but one British
diplomat called the proposal "encouraging."
Any reservations about the proposal's con
tent or timing are needless. Even if the
United States had no missiles in Western
Europe, it could attack targets in Eastern
Europe and the Soviet Union with long-range
ballistic missiles, bombers and sea-launched
cruise missiles. And to charge that the offer
is an effort by Gorbachev to "upstage"
Reagan at a vulnerable point in his
presidency is not to treat the proposal with
the seriousness it deserves.
