Campbell told
it like it is
Two cheers for Hoover Institu
tion Director W. Glenn Campbell.
He finally let the cat out of the
bag by proclaiming that Stanford
should "boast" of its "Reagan
connection," both through the
Hoover Institution and the pro
posed Reagan Presidential Li
brary. Rather than censuring
Campbell for this slip, the Faculty
Senate should applaud him for
his candor.
The real issue is not whether
Campbell improperly made a
public statement that links Stan
ford to a partisan viewpoint, but
whether the Hoover Institution
and the Reagan Library con-

stitute partisan links inappropri
ate for an institution of higher
education. My own limited experi
ence suggests that the problem
lies more with the Hoover Institu
tion than with its director.
Consider, for example, the
"op-ed" program which Campbell
boasts of. This program feeds
opinion articles by Hoover
"scholars" to newspapers across
the country. From my limited
sampling these writings seem
more like right-wing propaganda
than "scholarship." What should
we expect from an institution
which is chartered for the pur
pose of exposing the evils of com
munism?
I would like to thank W. Glenn
Campbell for exposing the truth
that Stanford would rather avoid:
the Hoover Institution is little

more than a propaganda mill.

In their recent editorial "Good
Move, Court" (Daily, Feb. 26), The
Daily editors applaud the Su
preme Court for upholding man
datory seat belt laws. I disagree.
Though this law saves lives, and
is only a minor inconvenience to
those who prefer not to wear a
seat belt, it is a blow to the princi
ple that free adults should be
allowed to make their own deci
sions (even if others think their
decisions are stupid.) The govern
ment, by taking the responsibility
for decisions out of individuals'

hands, is treating us like a nation
of children.
Consider the consequences if
the government legislates on the
principle, "If some people make
decisions with bad outcomes in
some area, we (the government)
can take such decisions out of the
hands of all people." Well, people
go sky diving and die; should sky
diving be illegal? People make
bad, and even foolish decisions
about careers and marriages;
should the government have the
final say about these decisions?
Of course not.
The Daily wrote. "The decision
to wear a seat belt is not a sacred
private act"; it damn well is! It's
an insignicant little private act
that is rightfully ours as a nation
of adults.
