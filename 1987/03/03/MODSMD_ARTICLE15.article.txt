# Saga revisited; SOS praised
## 
### 
When my first column — on Food Service —
appeared six weeks ago, I got a variety of reac
tions. I received calls from irate Food Service
managers who told me that my figures were
"confused" and "overlnflated," while law
school students would nab me on my way
through White Plaza to tell me that they actu
ally paid more than my column stated for their
Food Service. Other people claimed that I
wanted to slash the salaries of underpaid
workers and plop evil Saga into Food Service's
stead. Ah, the power of the press. Well, here are
some clarifications and further thoughts.

□First of all, let's dispel any confusion that
there may have been over the figures I quoted.
Here's what you pay for the various meal plans
straight from the mouth of Central Food Ser
vice (for the 75 days of winter quarter):
5 meals/wk: >412 total or an average of
about *7.50 per meal
7 meal plan: *544 total or an average of
*7.26 per meal
10 meal plan: *723 total or an average of
*6.75 per meal
14 meal plan: *765 total or an average of
around *5.10/ meal
19 meal plan: *814 total or an average of
around *4.00/ meal
The first three plans are only available to a
lucky few. like grad students, off-campusers.
people who live in certain Row houses or
dorms that don't have University Food Service.
Remember, too, that these figures don't take
into account meals that you miss. If you miss a
meal, you end up paying even more per meal.
Using the above numbers rather than those
that Food Service provided me with for my first
column, however, doesn't change my point —
we're paying restaurant prices, as you can see
above, without getting restaurant-quality
food.
□Second, If you eat Food Service food and still
think It's always high-, restaurant-quality
food, try working at Food Service as I did. I saw
sandwiches made with meat that was leftover
from days before only to sit on a shelf in the
refrigerator for several more days. I saw cakes
and bagels that were stale put out day after
day. I saw countless trays of food run out a
long time before the cafeteria was to close. Ad
mittedly. these are the worst things that hap
pen at Food Service and they may not happen
every day. But if they occurred in a restaurant,
you probably wouldn't eat there too often un

less you were a masochist. Here, some of us
have no choice. . . .
□Which brings me to my last point. Food Ser
vice has a monopoly. They have us dorm stu
dents in a Hulk Hogan stranglehold. If you live
in a dorm that has University Food Service,
you are required to get a meal plan there.

Now, despite these problems I'm not in favor
of suggesting that we slash the salaries of half
starved workers or overworked managers in or
der to cheapen our burger prices, as one rebut
tal claimed. Seriously, the Food Service
managers and employees I've known have been
decent, hard-working people who take pride in
their jobs.
Neither am I saying that we should start
eating low-quality, soybean-derivative food nor
that we urge the University to contract out to
Saga.
□We should be taking a good, hard look at
Food Service. There's got to be some room for
Improvement in an organzation where grad
students can end up paying seven bucks for
breakfast and a soda at Sterling Quad sets you
back *1.05.
□We should be demanding more choice.
People should be allowed not to get Food Ser
vice even if they live in a dorm.
□We should be making our opinions on the
quality of Food Service food known to the
managers. In most cases they're more than
willing to do what they can. Much of the fault
here lies with us students. We should be let
ting the managers know that the bagels are
stale, that we're sick of the food running out or
even that the salad bar is missing cherry
tomatoes.
So much for beating a dead horse (I can
already see an animal rights rebuttal.) On to
the next topic.

Speaking of Saga - whatever their past
crimes at other universities, they're not doing
such a bad Job here, though students could
probably do it as well. I was at the Saga-run
Coffee House for the recent Senior Pub Nite,
and it was a very happening place. They even
had a guy dressed up in a life-sized Spuds
MacKenzie costume.
Also, the Saga-run Patio Grill has amazing
barbecued chicken sandwiches. Best damned
things I've seen in White Plaza since free con
doms.

In the same column that I've criticized one
University branch. I'd like to commend an
other. Namely Student Organizational
Services, or 5.0.5., for short.
S.O.S. came into being three years ago. It's
an organization that has many purposes. It

provides invaluable materials for student event
promotion: poster material, mimeograph
machines, information on where and how to
advertise on campus. It also clues student
groups in on where to plan an event, how to
fund it, as well as how to navigate the many
dos and don'ts of University policy.
S.O.S. also does great wonders with organiz
ing student groups into a coherent union.
They publish a list of student groups and con
tacts, and keep various group constitutions on
file. They also help put together that invaluable
resource, the Stanford Student Directory.
All this advice, info and material is abso
lutely free.
If you're a new student group, or an old one
that hasn't been to S.O.S. on the second floor
of Tresidder, or even if you never got your copy
of the Student Directory, make an effort to
stop by there. It's a great place and it could well
save you trouble and money.
Incidentally, the amazing thing to me about
S.O.S. is that it is completely University
funded. So you see. the Farm does care.

While I'm beating dead horses, I may as well
finish the job. I've composed a little poem
about another of the Concert Network's up
coming events.
'Twas the night be/ore Dead Week
and all through the campus
Not a student group was stirring
Except, of course, the Concert Networkus
All the students were at Meyer,
glued to desk and chair
But the Concert Network was putting on an
other comedy show
Hoping Palo Altans would be there.
• * *
Never let it be said, though, that the Concert
Network hasn't done anything for the stu
dents. If you read may last column, you'll recall
that I ragged on the organization for being
unable to put on free dance shows. Sure
enough, this past week the Concert Network
announced that it would be putting on a noon
dance concert in White Plaza on Thursday.
March 5. The concert will feature famed
Enigma recording artists Wednesday Week,
coming here straight from L.A. to play
whatever kind of music they play best. Some
may believe that the only enigma here
Thursday will be the question of why the
musicians in the group are recording artists.
Others will see this as a last-ditch attempt to
win student approval before the spring fee
assessment vote. As an impartial Journalist,
however, I'll wait to hear them before I decide.
