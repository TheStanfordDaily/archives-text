# Oxford lauded

We were both alarmed and ir
ritated by the content of Jonathon
Mann's recent viewpoint (Daily,
Feb. 20); although personal reac
tions are completely admissible in
such a circumstance, we found
his conclusions to be both biased
and illogical. Having attended
Stanford-in-Oxford with Mann
during fall quarter, we shared the
same experiences, but differ ex
tremely in our interpretations.
Students considering the
Stanford-in-Oxford program
should know why 90 percent of
those they encounter will not echo
Mann's views.

The first point of clarification is
that one applies to Stanford-in-
Oxford, not Oxford University. It
is made clear to every student
seeking application who reads the
provided literature that the pro
gram is taught by Stanford profes
sors in Stanford-run facilities.
The international experience
comes from the surrounding
foreign culture. If one wants a
more intense experience abroad
than is offered, one may apply di
rectly to Oxford University for a
yearlong program (as some Stan
ford students have done). Be
forewarned — read the provided
literature!
Mann feels that the attitude on
campus is "if you don't like it
(Oxford), it's probably because you
didn't try hard enough." The truth
is, it is not a matter of trying hard
enough, but rather of trying at all.
When a student chooses to live en
tirely within the walls of the Stan
ford center, one can only expect
the ensuing Oxford experience to
be lacking. Sadly, a few students
did not participate in any of the
many available opportunities that
provided interaction with Oxford
students. It is a pity indeed to
forsake such activities as rowing
on a club level, tending an Oxford
college bar or adapting to the En
glish style of journalism by writing
for the Oxford newspaper — all of
which were taken on by numerous
Stanfordites last quarter.

Mann's comments regarding
the Bodleian Library summarize
his apparent lack of understand
ing concerning the attitudes and
traditions of Oxford and England.
Only one year ago students not
matriculated at Oxford were
prohibited from mere entrance to
the library. The present situation,
admittedly not ideal, is a consider
able privilege from a British per
spective. Even a nobel laureate
unassociated with Oxford Univer
sity would be denied entrance at
any hour of the day. Students
should be aware of the years that
were spent by Stanford adminis
trators, both in Oxford and in Cal
ifornia, to achieve such consider
able acceptance. The use of the
Bodleian Library is a privilege —
not a right. Mann's statement that
after two years at Oxford all such
problems should be "worked out"
exemplifies the stereotypical
American desire to have every
thing right now! One cannot rea
sonably expect the difficulties en
countered in challenging the pat
tern of 700-year-old tradition to be
resolved within a decade, much
less two years.
On a more serious note, Mann's
conclusions about the adminis
trative staff were both uncalled for
and misguided. To mention some
one's name unfavorably in print
without provocation is incon
siderate: moreover, it is unaccep
table for a student to call for the
elimination of a hard-working
man based on a personal bias.
Geoffrey Tyack may not be a good
cheerleader, but he has not been
hired in such a capacity. He is, in
fact, an effective and worthy ad
ministrator whose labor, to a large
extent, has made the Stanford-in-
Oxford program a success. It has
been our experience that the
entire staff is refreshingly con
siderate and efficient. As students
who made the most of our time
abroad, we found the Stanford-in-
Oxford program to be one of the
most rewarding experiences of our
college careers and sincerely hope
that Jonathon Mann's article will
not cause anyone to throw away
this opportunity.
