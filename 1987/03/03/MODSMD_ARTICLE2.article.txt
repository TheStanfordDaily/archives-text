# Protesters rally against SDI
## 
### FRANK QUARATIELLO Staff writer 
Members of Stanford Action for Nu
clear Disarmament (STAND) and two
guest speakers urged University re
searchers to refuse funding for Strategic
Defense Initiative (SDI) research at a
rally in White Plaza yesterday.
The noon rally concluded STAND'S
monthlong effort to Increase campus
awareness about President Reagan's
Strategic Defense Initiative, commonly
known as "Star Wars."
The rally, attended by about 60
people, featured two guest speakers. As

soc. Computer Science Prof. Terry
Winograd and SLAC Head of Operations
John Harris. The speakers argued
against University involvement in SDI
research, citing feasibility problems and
military dangers of the program as
reasons for refusing research funds.
"The computer system that would be
needed for Star Wars starts off with four
strikes against it," said Winograd, who
is also a member of Computer Profes
sionals for Social Responsibility.
These four "strikes" are that a SDI
computer system would have to operate
quickly, be very large, would have a dedi
cated enemy working against it and

could not be tested in any realistic way,
he said.
"It is pretty much agreed upon by
people who do programming, who un
derstand computer systems, that it's
going to go up there and when some
body tries to use it, there's going to be a
few bugs. But, of course, in this case, we
don't get a second chance. There's no
way to go back up, patch it up and try
again after we're all incinerated,"
Winograd said.
By accepting SDI research funds, sci
entists are giving the SDI program a

false credibility, according to
Wlnograd.
"They (proponents of Star Wars)
are using the universities. They
are using the credibility that they
get from all of these researchers to
help persuade Congress to keep
funding the thing (SDI)."
Winograd said.
Both Winograd and Harris con
tended that Stanford researchers,
in particular, are being used in
this way.
Winograd said scientists could
put a halt to SDI. "(Proponents of
SDI) do need the research. . . .
Without the work, the minds, the
hands of people here, people at
places like this, they're going to
bog down, they're not going to get
very far, and they're going to have

to give it (SDI) up." Winograd said.
"We need to do what we can to
see that those resources get used
in better ways, in ways that aren't
going to end up destroying the
world, but doing something posi
tive." Winograd said.
SDI researchers are "politically
naive," said civil engineering
graduate student Scott Bohning,
a founding member of STAND. He
and the other speakers urged
Stanford researchers to join
thousands of other scientists in a
nationwide movement to refuse
SDI funding.
At Stanford. SDI research is
concentrated into three fields:
missile- and satellite-tracking
techniques, reliable and fast
electronics and modifications of
the free electron laser, which was
invented here at Stanford and
may serve as the main weapon in
SDI. according to Bohning.
