Members of Stanford Action for Nu
clear Disarmament (STAND) and two
guest speakers urged University re
searchers to refuse funding for Strategic
Defense Initiative (SDI) research at a
rally in White Plaza yesterday.
The noon rally concluded STAND'S
monthlong effort to Increase campus
awareness about President Reagan's
Strategic Defense Initiative, commonly
known as "Star Wars."
The rally, attended by about 60
people, featured two guest speakers. As

soc. Computer Science Prof. Terry
Winograd and SLAC Head of Operations
John Harris. The speakers argued
against University involvement in SDI
research, citing feasibility problems and
military dangers of the program as
reasons for refusing research funds.
"The computer system that would be
needed for Star Wars starts off with four
strikes against it," said Winograd, who
is also a member of Computer Profes
sionals for Social Responsibility.
These four "strikes" are that a SDI
computer system would have to operate
quickly, be very large, would have a dedi
cated enemy working against it and

could not be tested in any realistic way,
he said.
"It is pretty much agreed upon by
people who do programming, who un
derstand computer systems, that it's
going to go up there and when some
body tries to use it, there's going to be a
few bugs. But, of course, in this case, we
don't get a second chance. There's no
way to go back up, patch it up and try
again after we're all incinerated,"
Winograd said.
