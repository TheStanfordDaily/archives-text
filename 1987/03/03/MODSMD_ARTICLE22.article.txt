## Bug mounts Meyer fifth floor 
### KATHRYN VER PLOEG Staff writer 
Dear Bug Me.
On my acceptance letter, Jean
Fetter signed, "Angela, great" in
the lower left hand corner. Does
she do that for everyone, or am I
Just special?
-Angela, oj course.
Angela, surely you are special,
but she does do that for everyone
— all 2,500 of the accepted
everyones — bringing the signing
time per letter up to 30 seconds. A
grueling 20 hours and 50 minutes
total.
Fetter, dean of Undergraduate
Admissions, took time out from
her seasonal 16-hour-a-day appli
cation reading crunch to elaborate
on the question.
"I've got about a half a dozen dif
ferent ones and try to add a new
one each year," Fetter said. In an
Informal poll, "great" came out as

the rnost-recelved adjec
tive/Interjection, with "terrific"
and "super" lagging behind for
second and third.
A major concern, other than two
roommates with the same adjec
tive, is the difficulty of finding
expressions with equal rank on
what she calls the "hierarchy of
enthusiasm." Imagine how
quickly your Initial pleasure with
"nice, Sally" would turn to disap
pointment when you find out that
your next-door neighbor got
"amazing, Helen."
Dear Bug Me.
One hung-over Sunday morn
ing. I stumbled Into Meyer Li
brary and chose to take the
elevator Instead of attempting the
stairs. I discovered that both
elevators list a fifth floor as a po
tential destination. One elevator
has a real button, but the other
elevator's button is fake. In addi

tlon. there is a light for when fifth
floor Is reached, but no number.
Is there a fifth floor?
-Curious George
There Is no fifth floor. There
never has been, and chances are
there never will be.
According to Kathy Ferhn,
Meyer Library's Office Manager,
the fake buttons are nothing more
than a "funny touch left by the ar
chitects and builders." However,
the roof is Indeed constructed so
that a fifth-floor addition could be
added relatively easily, in case the
library's stacks ever became too
bulging at the seams.
But since Meyer's collection gets
weeded out whenever It exceeds
160,000 volumes, the library is
not likely to start bulging soon.
Even more important, the addi
tion would be "outrageously ex
pensive," Ferhn said. "There are
999 other things we'd do first. If
we had the money."
