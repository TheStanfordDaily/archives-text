# Card nine return home to face USF
## 
### TOM SENF Editorial staff 
Entering this season, there
were a couple of question marks
concerning the Stanford baseball
team, which hosts the University
of San Francisco today at 2 p.m. at
Sunken Diamond.
Could the Cardinal, which hit
just 36 homers In 61 games in
1986, muster enough power to
challenge explosive defending
champion UCLA in the Pacific 10
Southern Division?
Could the Stanford freshmen,
named the best recruiting class in
America by Collegiate Baseball,
come in and contribute right away
at the Division I level?
So far, the answer to both ques
tions has been yes. The Cardinal,
12-8 overall, has already hit 18
homers in its 20 games, including
six by freshman rightflelder Paul
Carey and five by sophomore third
baseman Ed Sprague. Stanford Is
averaging 7.25 runs per game,
slightly above last year's average of
just under seven.
In addition to his homers, Carey
is hitting .304 and his 19 RBIs
trail only Sprague (with 21) In the
team RBI race. Freshman infielder
Troy Paulsen is hitting .379 with
10 RBIs in his 29 at-bats, and
pitcher Mark Carper has allowed
just three earned runs in his 10
innings of work.
Another newcomer, junior
transfer Jeff Saenger, is hitting a
quiet .250 but made a loud contri
bution to Stanford's 13-5 win over

UCLA on Sunday, with a three
run pinch-hit homer.
Instead of a question mark, the
Stanford pitching was supposed
to be an exclamation point. The
Cardinal came into the season
boasting a staff loaded with talent
and experience, and after Lee
Plemel shut out Fresno State on
Feb. 14, Stanford's team ERA
stood at 1.89.
But since then, the Cardinal
has surrendered 78 runs in its
last eight games against top-flight
competition (Fresno State, UC-
Santa Barbara and UCLA). Its
ERA is now 4.50.
Stanford gave up 27 earned
runs in three games to UCLA over
the weekend, including nine in
Friday's 17-9 loss and 13 in Satur
day's 14-5 setback. "It was a rough
weekend, no question about it,"
Stanford Coach Mark Marquess
said.
The Cardinal was facing a Bruin
team that had scored 57 runs in
its last five games, but Marquess
believed that the Stanford pitch
ing had something to do with
UCLA's productive weekend. "It
was a little bit of a combination,"
he said. "We weren't really sharp.
We haven't been pitching well, and
we know that."
One bright spot for the Cardinal
staff was the seven-inning, nine
strikeout performance of Jack
McDowell on Sunday. McDowell
had good stuff on his fastball and
was able to throw his off-speed
pitches for strikes — two bad

Sophomore pitcher Steve Chitren is among many Stanford pitchers who had difficul
ties with UCLA last weekend. Chitren was the starting — and losing — pitcher in Satur
day's 14-5 loss to the Bruins.
