# Women's fencing wins regional
## 
### CHRIS CRADER Staff writer 
The Stanford women's fencing team concluded the
home part of its storybook season over the weeekend,
and like all good stories, it had a great ending. At the
Western Regional Championships, the Cardinal took
home the team title and seniors Holly Taylor and
Alyson Yarus finished first and third, respectively, in
the individual competition.
The team competition on Saturday began well,
with Stanford winning Its first three matches by 13-
*3 scores. Then the Cardinal went up against Air
Force, a perennial power. Stanford was up 7-6 with
three bouts remaining but couldn't put the Falcons
away.
After two Air Force victories, Stanford senior
Alexandra Rankin took the strip to try to knot the
score at eight.
"It went right down to the wire," said Stanford
Coach Buzz Hurst. "I was getting very concerned."
Indicators favored Stanford in the case of a tie, and
after Rankin won her bout 5-0, the overall victory
went to the Cardinal. Barely.
The last match of the day was for the champion
ship. Stanford and UC-Santa Cruz were both 4-0 on
the day, but the Banana Slugs had earlier handed Air
Force a 13-3 loss, so the Cardinal knew it was going
to be a battle.
The match was tight all the way and again it came

down to the last bout. With Stanford up 8-7, but be
hind in the tiebreaking procedure. Taylor squared
off against UCSC's top fencer, Suzanne Lahara.
Taylor was down 1-3 and 3-4, but then got the
equalizer, reducing the entire championship to "the
last touch of the last bout between the two best fen
cers In the region," according to Hurst.
"I just kind of went into overdrive" and ended the
team competition with one last touch, Taylor said.
"I can't say enough about Holly," said Hurst.
"Santa Cruz really technically has a better team."
But, he added, the Cardinal has beaten UCSC three
times this year because of "courage and character."
Everyone helped out for the Cardinal, as all four
fencers had winning records. Taylor posted the day's
top mark of 19-1 and Yarus had the fifth-best win
total and a 14-6 record. Junior Tracy Schmidt went
12-8 and Rankin was 11-9.
The individual contest was also a Cardinal
bonanza. Freshman Elisabeth Spilman fenced tough
but did not get past the first round, finishing 1-4
and 21st out of 29 fencers. Schmidt fared somewhat
better, tallying four wins to only one defeat in the
first round, but she was eliminated in the second,
and wound up 18th.
Rankin made the final 16, and was one touch away
from the top 12. She finished 4-7 and in 14th place.
The biggest stories, however, were Yarus and Taylor.
