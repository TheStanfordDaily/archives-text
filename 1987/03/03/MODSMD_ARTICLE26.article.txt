# Women's fencing wins regional
## 
### CHRIS CRADER Staff writer 
The Stanford women's fencing team concluded the
home part of its storybook season over the weeekend,
and like all good stories, it had a great ending. At the
Western Regional Championships, the Cardinal took
home the team title and seniors Holly Taylor and
Alyson Yarus finished first and third, respectively, in
the individual competition.
The team competition on Saturday began well,
with Stanford winning Its first three matches by 13-
*3 scores. Then the Cardinal went up against Air
Force, a perennial power. Stanford was up 7-6 with
three bouts remaining but couldn't put the Falcons
away.
After two Air Force victories, Stanford senior
Alexandra Rankin took the strip to try to knot the
score at eight.
"It went right down to the wire," said Stanford
Coach Buzz Hurst. "I was getting very concerned."
Indicators favored Stanford in the case of a tie, and
after Rankin won her bout 5-0, the overall victory
went to the Cardinal. Barely.
The last match of the day was for the champion
ship. Stanford and UC-Santa Cruz were both 4-0 on
the day, but the Banana Slugs had earlier handed Air
Force a 13-3 loss, so the Cardinal knew it was going
to be a battle.
The match was tight all the way and again it came

down to the last bout. With Stanford up 8-7, but be
hind in the tiebreaking procedure. Taylor squared
off against UCSC's top fencer, Suzanne Lahara.
Taylor was down 1-3 and 3-4, but then got the
equalizer, reducing the entire championship to "the
last touch of the last bout between the two best fen
cers In the region," according to Hurst.
"I just kind of went into overdrive" and ended the
team competition with one last touch, Taylor said.
"I can't say enough about Holly," said Hurst.
"Santa Cruz really technically has a better team."
But, he added, the Cardinal has beaten UCSC three
times this year because of "courage and character."
Everyone helped out for the Cardinal, as all four
fencers had winning records. Taylor posted the day's
top mark of 19-1 and Yarus had the fifth-best win
total and a 14-6 record. Junior Tracy Schmidt went
12-8 and Rankin was 11-9.
The individual contest was also a Cardinal
bonanza. Freshman Elisabeth Spilman fenced tough
but did not get past the first round, finishing 1-4
and 21st out of 29 fencers. Schmidt fared somewhat
better, tallying four wins to only one defeat in the
first round, but she was eliminated in the second,
and wound up 18th.
Rankin made the final 16, and was one touch away
from the top 12. She finished 4-7 and in 14th place.
The biggest stories, however, were Yarus and Taylor.

Stanford senior Holly Taylor and UC-Santa Cruz's Suzanne Lahara squared off in the final match of the
Western Regionals at Stanford last weekend. Taylor won the bout 5-4.
Yarus. who had been sick all
weekend, started slowly but won
four of her last five — the only loss
coming at the hands of Taylor —
to finish third. "My goal was to get
into the top eight." she admitted.
Hurst was proud of her perfor
mance. "I thought Alyson's taking
third place was a remarkable
achievement." he said.
Taylor simply dominated all
weekend, and especially proved it
on Sunday. She was 13-0 on the
day, and her last two bouts were

her best. In the semifinal she
reeled off seven consecutive points
en route to beating Yarus 8-1,
then entered the final against
Lahara.
Lahara jumped out to an early
lead, and was able to extend It to
6-3 (scoring In the final round Is
to eight). Unfortunately, that was
against Taylor's plan.
"I wanted to be ahead at the
beginning," she said. "(At 3-6) I
knew 1 had to do something differ
ent. 1 just changed my game."
The new Holly Taylor was ex
tremely aggressive and was able to
catch up quickly. "I Just tried to
attack," she said after running off
five straight points to win the

championship.
Based upon their top four
finishes. Laurel Wilson of UCSC.

recommended to be selected for
NCAAs. as were Stanford and
UCSC for the team competition.

Dame on March 19-21. In addi
tion. Lahara was named the out
standing fencer for the weekend.
Hurst was impressed with the
performance of this season's
team, his fourth to win the
regional title in as many years. He
summed up the squad's effort by
saying that of all the teams he has
coached "this team probably has
the most character."
