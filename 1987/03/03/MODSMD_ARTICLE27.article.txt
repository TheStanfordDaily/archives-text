## 
### JON WEISMAN Staff writer 
Hoping to build on the improvement exhibited last
weekend at the 98th annual Pacific Coast Men's
Doubles Tennis Championships in La Jolla, the
Stanford men's tennis team takes on Hayward State
in a 1:30 p.m. match today at Stanford Tennis
Stadium.
Stanford "had makeshift teams, basically," at the
Pacific Coast Doubles, according to Stanford Coach
Dick Gould, but the three pairs had some solid per
formances and also extracted a bit of revenge as well.
Freshmen Jeff Cathrall and Eric Peus improved
their record to 6-3 with two wins over the weekend.
They first defeated Omar Encarnacion and Chris
Henderson of Grossmont Junior College, 6-1, 6-1,
then posted their second three-set victory in less
than a week, over the University of San Diego's Jim
McNamee and J.R. Edwards. 4-6. 6-4, 6-2.
Cathrall and Peus were eliminated by a brothers
team of Dartmouth graduates, John and Bruce
Steele. 6-3, 4-6, 6-3.
"Cathrall and Peus looked pretty good," Gould
said. "They look better every time they play,"
Mark Jacobson and Scott Moody split two
matches, defeating Rob Hogreff and Martin Quiroz,
one of several unaffiliated teams in the tournament,
7-5, 6-2, before losing to Long Beach State's William
Maravec and Drew Denny, 7-6, 6-1.

The most Interesting result for Stanford was in the
match between Stanford's Curtis Dunn and Jon
Kahn and USD's Dave Stewart and Scott Patridge.
Stewart and Patridge defeated Jacobson and Jeff
Tarango last Tuesday, 4-6, 6-3, 6-1 on the way to the
Toreros 6-3 win over the Cardinal.
However, Dunn and Kahn, neither of whom played
against San Diego, knocked off the USD pair 7-5, 6-
4. Arizona's John Schmidt and lan Aler then
defeated Dunn and Kahn, 6-4, 6-0.

Cathrall and Peus
looked pretty good. They
look better every time .

"It was nice to see Curtis and Jon beat (the USD
team)," Gould said.
Geordie McKee remains questionable for today's
match against Hayw?,rd. His presence or absence af
fects the lineup on both singles and doubles as Stan
ford, 3-5 this season, continues to be at the mercy of
the injury bug.
Gould said that the Pioneers are a good, experi
enced Division II team, and that they are strong
throughout their lineup.
