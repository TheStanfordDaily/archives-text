# Top freshmen spikers find starting roles
## 
### ALICIA KENT Staff writer 
Named as the country's No. 1
recruits last year, freshmen
Parker Blackman. Craig Forsyth.
Dan Hanan and Kent Steffes
promised to add talent to the

Stanford men's volleyball team at
the beginning of the season, but it
was hard to say to what extent
this freshman connection would
help the spikers.
After two straight winning
seasons and two consecutive ap
pearances In the NCAA Western

Reglonals, Stanford lost several
key players to graduation, includ
ing two All-Americans, Jon Root
and Chris Braun. This year's in
flux of new talent was exactly what
the Cardinal needed. "It was a very
timely addition to the team,"
Stanford Coach Fred Sturm noted
in the early part of the season.
Labeling this season as one of
improvement, Sturm was unsure
of how his inexperienced volleyball
team would match up with the
other powers of the Western Inter
collegiate Volleyball Association.
But a quarter of the way into the
season, the Cardinal has been
able to use its blend of six veterans
and six newcomers to form a com
petitive team.
For many freshmen in varsity
team sports, a few cameo appear
ances in minor games is all that
can be hoped for, but for all four of
these freshmen, starting in league
matches has become fact. "It's in
credible — I never thought I'd be
starting," said Forsyth, who was
first tested as a setter, but is now
playing as a hitter and adding
blocking strength.
In the first match of the season,
against Westmont College, it was
the veteran experience of setter
Steve Modory and hitters Stephen
Blue, Scott Fortune and John
McDermott that lead the Cardinal
to its first victory. However, new
comer Steffes played the entire
match, opening the door for the
possibility of freshman starters.
At this early point in the season,
Sturm began ' > experiment with
the lineup, playing Blackman as
setter and allowing Forsyth and
Hanan to show their strength as
hitters.
In the next match, against UC-
Santa Barbara, the first confer
ence match, Blackman entered in
the third game and has been the
spikers' starting setter since,
helping the team to three con
secutive conference wins. Forsyth
earned his spot as a starter, too.
Blackman and Forsyth make a

strong pair, as the two freshmen
have been best friends and played
volleyball together since seventh
grade. "I usually know what
Parker is going to do on the
court," said Forsyth, who is. along
with Blackman, from Santa
Monica.
Playing college volleyball is
much more challenging for the
four than high school and Junior
Olympic play. "The competition is
so intense and the jump to college
is so big. It isn't physical, it's men
tal. I've tried to start over, start
fresh," said Blackman, who was
named Player of the Year in 1985
and 1986 at Loyola High School
and won all-tournament status at
the Palisades Invitational in 1985-
86.
Not only is the competition
much harder, playing against six
top players rather than the usual
one or two of a high school team,
but the techniques and level of
play are more difficult. "It is a lot
different. The level of play is
faster, a lot harder. I have to con
centrate a lot harder because a
three-game college match is ex
hausting. An average play isn't
going to get the job done," said
Forsyth, who had an outstanding
high school career and was named
first team All-CIF and second team
high school Ail-American.
The experience of the veteran
upperclassmen and the close knit
feeling of a team have helped make
this transition easier for the fresh
men. "The team is really close.
That's one of the main things I
like about it," said Hanan, who
began playing with the other three
freshmen at the beginning of the
summer.
Sturm has noticed this close
team feeling among the players,
which he feels has made the differ
ence between a group of 12 indi
vidual players and a unit of 12
great team members. "This group
is a more closely knit group. It is
some sort of chemistry, some
thing intangible that makes a

group into a team. These guys
have a desire to succeed together.
I think that is a pretty mature atti
tude." Sturm said.
Although there is a feeling of
competition for the starting posi
tions, Sturm feels it is a healthy
competition that can only add to
the level of play. "I go out and work
hard every day at practice, hoping
I'll start. But I want what's best for
the team. If I'm not playing well, I
shouldn't be the starter." said
Blackman, who has replaced
senior Modory at setter. "Steve
has been great to me. he couldn't
be nicer. I'm capable of screwing
up at any point in the match.
Steve could come in and take
over."
Sturm agrees with this asses
ment, saying that Modory has
made it hard for Parker by keeping
the pressure on and not giving up.
"Steve's a first class person, and
he's not throwing the towel in,"he
said.
Hanan's competition is senior
Robert Peterson, who started
every match until Saturday's
match against USC, when Hanan
made his entrance as a powerful
hitter. "Peterson is the guy in
front of me. There are some things
I do better and some things he
does better. It just depends on
who is playing better," said
Hanan, who is from Huntington
Beach, where he was named Or
ange County MVP and CIF South
ern Section MVP in 1986.
Over winter break, Steffes
injured his ankle and missed a
week of practice. When he
returned he developed tendonitis
in his shoulder. Although Steffes
started in the alumni tournament
and Westmont match, the first
two competitions of the the
season, he was not able to play
much in the first conference
matches. This lack of play was
frustrating for Steffes after an out
standing high school career, in
cluding accomplishments such as
Los Angeles City Player of the

Year, MVP of the Junior National
team and first team high school
Ail-American as a junior.
However, Steffes made an ap
pearance on Feb. 11 against
Hawaii at the end of the match,
making two key digs, a kill and a
block assist. After this strong per
formance. Steffes played in the
UCLA and Long Beach matches
and started in the USC contest
last weekend. "The bright spot of
the weekend was Kent and Dan.
We're going to have to set them
more balls because they proved to
be really good hitters," Stanford
Asst. Coach Ruben Nieves said
after the road trip down south.
In addition to making the typi
cal freshman adjustments of be
coming used to dorm life, meeting
people and learning how to handle
a more challenging study load,
these four spikers have had to
make room for six hours of volley
ball in their daily schedules in ad
dition to travel time for away
matches. "I didn't realize how
much more time I would have to
put in for volleyball. It's a challeng
ing adjustment that I hope I can
make well." said Blackman, who
was finishing his first college re
search paper before leaving for
last week's road trip to Southern
California.
In addition to three hours of
practice a day.the players spend
two hours in the training room
and one hour in the weight room,
plus an additional individual pro
gram consisting of sprints and
conditioning. "It feels like the
entire day. plus you have to put in
time for studying, classes, dorm
life, friends and meeting people,"
Steffes said.
Has the sacrifice of playing a
varsity sport been worth it for
these freshmen? In addition to
noticing improvement in their vol
leyball technique and strength,
the four are glad to be at Stanford.
"It's a sacrifice in a way, but one
that I'm ready and willing to
make," Blackman said.

be really good hitters," Stanford
Asst. Coach Ruben Nieves said
after the road trip down south.
In addition to making the typi
cal freshman adjustments of be
coming used to dorm life, meeting
people and learning how to handle
a more challenging study load,
these four spikers have had to
make room for six hours of volley
ball in their daily schedules in ad
dition to travel time for away
matches. "I didn't realize how
much more time I would have to
put in for volleyball. It's a challeng
ing adjustment that I hope I can
make well." said Blackman, who
was finishing his first college re
search paper before leaving for
last week's road trip to Southern
California.
In addition to three hours of
practice a day.the players spend
two hours in the training room
and one hour in the weight room,
plus an additional individual pro
gram consisting of sprints and
conditioning. "It feels like the
entire day. plus you have to put in
time for studying, classes, dorm
life, friends and meeting people,"
Steffes said.

Freshman Parker Blackman (31) and junior transfer Jason McFarland
(9) are among six newcomers are making contributions to the Stan
ford men's volleyball team this season.
Named as the country's No. 1
recruits last year, freshmen
Parker Blackman. Craig Forsyth.
Dan Hanan and Kent Steffes
promised to add talent to the

Stanford men's volleyball team at
the beginning of the season, but it
was hard to say to what extent
this freshman connection would
help the spikers.
After two straight winning
seasons and two consecutive ap
pearances In the NCAA Western

Reglonals, Stanford lost several
key players to graduation, includ
ing two All-Americans, Jon Root
and Chris Braun. This year's in
flux of new talent was exactly what
the Cardinal needed. "It was a very
timely addition to the team,"
Stanford Coach Fred Sturm noted
in the early part of the season.
Labeling this season as one of
improvement, Sturm was unsure
of how his inexperienced volleyball
team would match up with the
other powers of the Western Inter
collegiate Volleyball Association.
But a quarter of the way into the
season, the Cardinal has been
able to use its blend of six veterans
and six newcomers to form a com
petitive team.
For many freshmen in varsity
team sports, a few cameo appear
ances in minor games is all that
can be hoped for, but for all four of
these freshmen, starting in league
matches has become fact. "It's in
credible — I never thought I'd be
starting," said Forsyth, who was
first tested as a setter, but is now
playing as a hitter and adding
blocking strength.
In the first match of the season,
against Westmont College, it was
the veteran experience of setter
Steve Modory and hitters Stephen
Blue, Scott Fortune and John
McDermott that lead the Cardinal
to its first victory. However, new
comer Steffes played the entire
match, opening the door for the
possibility of freshman starters.
At this early point in the season,
Sturm began ' > experiment with
the lineup, playing Blackman as
setter and allowing Forsyth and
Hanan to show their strength as
hitters.
In the next match, against UC-
Santa Barbara, the first confer
ence match, Blackman entered in
the third game and has been the
spikers' starting setter since,
helping the team to three con
secutive conference wins. Forsyth
earned his spot as a starter, too.
Blackman and Forsyth make a

strong pair, as the two freshmen
have been best friends and played
volleyball together since seventh
grade. "I usually know what
Parker is going to do on the
court," said Forsyth, who is. along
with Blackman, from Santa
Monica.
Playing college volleyball is
much more challenging for the
four than high school and Junior
Olympic play. "The competition is
so intense and the jump to college
is so big. It isn't physical, it's men
tal. I've tried to start over, start
fresh," said Blackman, who was
named Player of the Year in 1985
and 1986 at Loyola High School
and won all-tournament status at
the Palisades Invitational in 1985-
86.
Not only is the competition
much harder, playing against six
top players rather than the usual
one or two of a high school team,
but the techniques and level of
play are more difficult. "It is a lot
different. The level of play is
faster, a lot harder. I have to con
centrate a lot harder because a
three-game college match is ex
hausting. An average play isn't
going to get the job done," said
Forsyth, who had an outstanding
high school career and was named
first team All-CIF and second team
high school Ail-American.
The experience of the veteran
upperclassmen and the close knit
feeling of a team have helped make
this transition easier for the fresh
men. "The team is really close.
That's one of the main things I
like about it," said Hanan, who
began playing with the other three
freshmen at the beginning of the
summer.
Sturm has noticed this close
team feeling among the players,
which he feels has made the differ
ence between a group of 12 indi
vidual players and a unit of 12
great team members. "This group
is a more closely knit group. It is
some sort of chemistry, some
thing intangible that makes a

group into a team. These guys
have a desire to succeed together.
I think that is a pretty mature atti
tude." Sturm said.
Although there is a feeling of
competition for the starting posi
tions, Sturm feels it is a healthy
competition that can only add to
the level of play. "I go out and work
hard every day at practice, hoping
I'll start. But I want what's best for
the team. If I'm not playing well, I
shouldn't be the starter." said
Blackman, who has replaced
senior Modory at setter. "Steve
has been great to me. he couldn't
be nicer. I'm capable of screwing
up at any point in the match.
Steve could come in and take
over."
Sturm agrees with this asses
ment, saying that Modory has
made it hard for Parker by keeping
the pressure on and not giving up.
"Steve's a first class person, and
he's not throwing the towel in,"he
said.
Hanan's competition is senior
Robert Peterson, who started
every match until Saturday's
match against USC, when Hanan
made his entrance as a powerful
hitter. "Peterson is the guy in
front of me. There are some things
I do better and some things he
does better. It just depends on
who is playing better," said
Hanan, who is from Huntington
Beach, where he was named Or
ange County MVP and CIF South
ern Section MVP in 1986.
Over winter break, Steffes
injured his ankle and missed a
week of practice. When he
returned he developed tendonitis
in his shoulder. Although Steffes
started in the alumni tournament
and Westmont match, the first
two competitions of the the
season, he was not able to play
much in the first conference
matches. This lack of play was
frustrating for Steffes after an out
standing high school career, in
cluding accomplishments such as
Los Angeles City Player of the

Year, MVP of the Junior National
team and first team high school
Ail-American as a junior.
However, Steffes made an ap
pearance on Feb. 11 against
Hawaii at the end of the match,
making two key digs, a kill and a
block assist. After this strong per
formance. Steffes played in the
UCLA and Long Beach matches
and started in the USC contest
last weekend. "The bright spot of
the weekend was Kent and Dan.
We're going to have to set them
more balls because they proved to
be really good hitters," Stanford
Asst. Coach Ruben Nieves said
after the road trip down south.
In addition to making the typi
cal freshman adjustments of be
coming used to dorm life, meeting
