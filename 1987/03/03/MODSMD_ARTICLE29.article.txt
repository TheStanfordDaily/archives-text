# Bowman: Star Wars won't work

### ERIN MARTIN 
"There isn't the slightest chance that the
Star Wars program could provide an effective
defense for the people of the United States,"
Dr. Robert Bowman, a former lieutenant
colonel in the U.S. Air Force, told an audience
last night in Dinkelspiel Auditorium.
Bowman based much of his critique of the
Reagan administration's Strategic Defense Ini
tiative (SDI), or "Star Wars" program, on tech
nical and design impossibilities. The source of
his information is his personal experience
with the military in defense planning, he said.
Bowman began his talk with slides and ex
planations of general technical approaches to
SDI, and went on to describe and criticize the
early anti-ballistic missile program.
Bowman said that "given time and money,
engineering challenges can be overcome," but
that, in any case, SDI will never protect U.S.
citizens from nuclear attack. He said SDI re

search will continue relentlessly until its oppo
nents apply enough pressure to bring it to a
halt.
Bowman proceeded to analyze motivational
factors behind SDI. saying that Star Wars is
really intended as an aggressive action "to
destroy satellites and seize control of space."
and is not a defensive move. "Star Wars has
nothing to do with defense. It is an attempt to
gain control vnder the guise of defense."
Bowman said Soviet competition to main
tain a more strategic military position indi
cates Soviet fear of U.S. aggression. According
to Bowman's figures, even after a first strike by
Soviet forces, the United States would have
enough missile power to destroy the Soviet Un
ion 20 times over.
"The important thing is. the Russians think
that is deterrence enough. And believe me,
they do. They are not about to attack the
United States under these circumstances," he
said.

"President Reagan has the opportunity to
become the greatest peacemaker In history,"
said Bowman, adding that any action on arms
control must be initiated by "a new way of
thinking."
Calling for an international "common secur
ity," Bowman said there is a need for a reor
ganization of priorities, working toward pro
gressive global cooperation.
Bowman, a Vietnam veteran, advised indi
viduals concerned about SDI to vote against all
defense spending in order to cut off the neces
sary financial resources for research. He also
suggested writing to senators and congress
man.
Bowman was asked to speak at Stanford by a
number of groups including Stanford Action
for Nuclear Disarmament (STAND), the ASSU,
Physicians for Social Responsibility, Com
puter Professionals for Social Responsibility.
SWOPSI, Humanities Special Programs and
Student Organization Services.
