### MONIQUE SCHEER Senior staff writer 
Increases in financial aid, and faculty and staff
salaries are among the most significant new expen
ditures proposed by Acting Provost Robert Street in
his guidelines for next year's *320 million balanced
operating budget. The figure represents a 7.4 per
cent increase over last year's budget.
Street's budget proposals will be discussed at the
Faculty Senate's Thursday meeting and will be acted
on by the Board of Trustees March 10.
The proposed budget provides for a *530,000 in
crease in graduate financial aid in order to "bring fel
lowships and teaching assistantships up to the level
of the competition and to respond to problems
related to changes in the tax law," according to the
guidelines.
Under the new federal tax code, fellowships and
teaching assistantships for graduate students are
taxable. If Street's proposal is accepted, part of the
budget increase for graduate students "will be used
in the first year of a two-year process to respond to
the situation."
In addition, the University plans a *400,000 in
crease in undergraduate financial aid to counteract
the government's *400,000 cut in Pell Grants and
Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grants to
undergraduates.
Undergraduate studies are slated to receive an al
most *700,000 increase in funding. The computer
science department and new educational programs
in the School of Humanities and Sciences are among
the planned recipients of the funds.
Street has set a basic allocation of 4.7 percent
merit increases for faculty. Some salary increases
will be modified, particularly in the Medical School
and the Graduate School of Business, where salary
allocations must respond to competitive pressures.
The guidelines note that "tuition . . . provides
nearly half of the income to the operating budget."
The University expects tuition and fee income to in
crease by 6.9 percent over the 1986-87 budget.
The University's endowment is also expected to in
crease over the coming year. The recent climb in
stock prices resulting from lower inflation "has
helped boost the value of the endowment," according
to the budget guidelines.
In general, the proposed guidelines reflect
