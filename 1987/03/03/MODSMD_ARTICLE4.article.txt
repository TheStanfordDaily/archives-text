Scholars and arms control experts here
welcomed the recent Soviet proposal to
eliminate medium-range nuclear missiles
from Europe.
"It represents a very important move by
(Soviet Premier Mikhail) Gorbachev," said
Sidney Drell, co-director of the University
Center for International Security and Arms
Control. "It would seem to be a major ac
commodation of the Western view. "
The Soviet offer, announced Saturday,
ends Soviet insistence that any arms pack
age dealing with intermediate nuclear
forces (INFs) be linked to cutbacks In
longer-range missiles and the Strategic
Defense Initiative (SDI).

Under the terms of the Kremlin proposal,
the Soviet Union its SS-20 medium-range
missiles and the United States would
remove its Pershing II and cruise missiles
from Europe. Each side would be permitted
to retain 100 warheads for intermediate
range missiles, but would have to deploy
them outside of Europe.
Political Science Prof. David Holloway
noted that the new Soviet proposal is essen
tially the same position to which President
Reagan and Gorbachev tentatively agreed
during their November summit in Reyk
javik, Iceland — except that in Iceland, Gor
bachev Insisted on linking the reductions
to restrictions on SDI.
The Soviet offer also substantially
resembles the so-called "zero option" plan

proposed by President Reagan early in his
first term.
History Prof. Alexander Dallin termed the
Soviet proposal "a concession in the sense
that it's a decoupling from the strategic
defense issue."
According to Holloway, "the Soviet Union
has backed down on all the main objections
they had to the zero option," including the
issues of military aircraft and the status of
French and British missiles.
The Soviet offer came only two days after
the Tower commission released its report
criticizing the Reagan Administration in
the Iran-contra affair. While Holloway noted
the Soviets "perhaps judge Reagan more
amenable" to arms control now, he called
the proposal "genuine."

"The main factor in the timing is that
they realize they aren't going to get a strate
gic agreement," Holloway said of the
Soviets.
Dallin said the timing of the offer "may
well reflect a greater sophistication" in So
viet attention to American domestic
politics. The offer comes at a "propitious
moment from our perspective," Dallin said.
"If that was the Soviets' intent, they were
very clever."
Both Reagan and Gorbachev "may well
need an arms agreement politically," Dallin
observed. Regarding Gorbachev, Dallin said
"in general, his policies have been quite cre
ative, but there are not many major suc
cesses on the foreign policy scene that he
can point to at home."
