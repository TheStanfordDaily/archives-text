### SUHA JHAVERI Staff writer 
Dr. Charles Clements, subject of
the Academy Award-winning doc
umentary "Witness to War," spoke
last night in Kresge Auditorium
on problems plaguing Central
American relations with the
United States.
"Witness to War," shown prior
to Clements' speech, is based on
his best-selling book of the same
name and deals with his yearlong
stay in El Salvador working as the
sole physician for 10,000
civilians.
Clements, who also served with
the U.S. Air Force in Vietnam,
began with an update on the cur
rent situation in El Salvador. As
in Vietnam, he said, the American
public is being deceived into
thinking that war is drawing to a
close in Central America.
"After two billion dollars of U.S.

aid, there is still very little light at
the end of the tunnel," Clements
said. "The war continues. We are
seeking a military solution to
what is profoundly a socioeco
nomic problem, while El Salvador,
on both sides, is bleeding as a
result."
Clements noted that the U.S.
Embassy claimed in 1985 that it
had pacified certain territories in
Central America, but said that
this peace was merely "the peace
of the dead."
"It is important to understand
that (Salvadoran) President
Duarte has lost the confidence of
his people. ... He has been
unable to carry out the promises
he made," Clements said.
He added that human rights
still go unprotected in El Salvador
and that the special Interest

War," reviews the current situation in El Salvador last night
groups that helped Duarte get
elected remain unsatisfied.
"I think that there will be no so
lution in El Salvador until the
people can participate safely In
their government," Clements
declared.
Clements said there is a need to
redefine the political terms used
in governing public policy.
"Forty-five cents of every tax dol
lar is used for weapons we pray we
won't use," he said. "We don't
have much of a social choice."
He added that "patriots are
those who comprehend and can
replace violence with wisdom and
compassion . . . and we send the
poor of this country to fight the
poor of Central America."
Clements also addressed the

Issue of non-violence. He related
to the audience an incident that
occurred when he was In El Sal
vador. While talking with a civil
ian on the debate between vio
lence and non-violence, the civil
ian said, "How can you know non
violence versus violence unless
you understand the violence of the
soul when you see your own
children die of malnutrition?"
Clements commented, "They
believe that their suffering is not
God's will, but the result of a few
men's greed."
When asked how the Individual
can help in the plight of Central
America, Clements said Ameri
cans should be aware of "how and
why you have been deceived." He
urged citizens to "overcome the
knee-jerk fear of communism. We
can coexist."
Clements concluded with a
statement of faith in the American

system of money. "We are on a self
correcting course and there is
great reason for hope. . . . Educa
tion is a slow process."
