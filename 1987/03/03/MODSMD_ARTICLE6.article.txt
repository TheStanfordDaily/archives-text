# Scuba studies: Open Water 1
## 
### JULIANA HORSEMAN Staff writer 
If you're glancing through the spring quarter Time
Schedule looking for a class, Open Water 1 will be
sure to catch your eye. Scuba diving for recreational
divers in Monterey Bay can't be too rough.
"It's casual, friendly and you learn about some
thing that genuinely interests you," said one stu
dent. Diver Jose Fernandez enjoyed the class so
much he has made arrangements to dive with
friends he met in the class.
The course operates under a "buddy system" and
students switch buddies throughout the quarter.
Underwater, students are responsible for keeping in
contact with their buddies and helping them if ne
cessary. Why this system?
"It's like that expression â€” diving is like sex. you
can do it alone, but it's much more fun with another
person," joked instructor Sharon Donovan.
Although students in the class agree it is an
"awesome, fun experience," there is also work to be
done, exams to be taken and a paper to be written.
Indeed, one-fifth of the scheduled class time is
consumed in the classroom learning how to read dive
charts, discussing the reading or reviewing skills
learned in the water.
