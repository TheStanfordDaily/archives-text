# Scuba studies: Open Water 1
## 
### JULIANA HORSEMAN Staff writer 
If you're glancing through the spring quarter Time
Schedule looking for a class, Open Water 1 will be
sure to catch your eye. Scuba diving for recreational
divers in Monterey Bay can't be too rough.
"It's casual, friendly and you learn about some
thing that genuinely interests you," said one stu
dent. Diver Jose Fernandez enjoyed the class so
much he has made arrangements to dive with
friends he met in the class.
The course operates under a "buddy system" and
students switch buddies throughout the quarter.
Underwater, students are responsible for keeping in
contact with their buddies and helping them if ne
cessary. Why this system?
"It's like that expression — diving is like sex. you
can do it alone, but it's much more fun with another
person," joked instructor Sharon Donovan.
Although students in the class agree it is an
"awesome, fun experience," there is also work to be
done, exams to be taken and a paper to be written.
Indeed, one-fifth of the scheduled class time is
consumed in the classroom learning how to read dive
charts, discussing the reading or reviewing skills
learned in the water.
Donovan devotes her early
lectures to what she calls "diver at
titude." Such lectures stress the
importance of safety measures, re
sponsibility. proper commitment
and communication underwater.
"Students must realize that there
Is an important diving theory and
crucial safety considerations.
They must know the theory; the
sport can be dangerous," Donovan
said.
One handout given to the stu
dents in class offered advice In the
event of a shark attack: "If it
moves in. hit it with an object on
the snout using your fist as a last
resort, since the rough hide will
cut the skin." Has the class ever
had to worry with such advice?
Students in the class have "not
directly" had to use the shark at
tack advice, Donovan said. "Shark
attacks are very rare, and sharks
are easily put off by a group of
divers."
The beginners' class last fall
came closest to such a danger.
After arriving at Monterey Beach
for their first dive, the divers saw a
man who had obviously been at
tacked by a shark being pulled to
the shore at the other end of the
beach. Two students dialed 911
and the emergency vehicle took
the victim to the hospital where he
received 500 stitches.
"It was so incredibly unreal and
out of the blue. It was the first at
tack ever at that beach," Donovan
said. Needless to say, the class
moved to a different beach, where
it took an early lunch break.
"Any real dangers come from
just not paying attention,"
Donovan said, noting that two
students burst their ear drums
after failing to equalize their pres
sure. "Most students, however,
take all aspects of the course
seriously and results are
forthcoming. It's sure worth it
when I see their faces after they've
been at the bottom of the pool for
the first time. They're absolutely
jubilant," Donovan said.
Donovan has been interested in
scuba diving ever since she
watched "Sea Hunt" for the first
time. She took her first scuba
class during her senior year at the

University of Wisconsin and loved
It — "even in the boring lakes."
After three years of experience of
diving In the midwest and Florida,
Donovan moved to California and
began teaching.
After earning her master's
degree in physical education at
San Francisco State, Donovan
came to Stanford in 1980 as a full
time instructor of aquatic classes.
All the students agreed the in
structor is excellent. "She's very
thorough, extremely knowl
edgeable and you can tell how
much she loves it," said one
diver."But although she makes
the class fun, she keeps it serious
at the same time, which is impor
tant because it's serious business
underwater. You can't screw up."
The three-unit academic course
encompasses a wide range of top
ics relating to diving, including
applied physics (Did you know
that refracted light makes objects
underwater appear 25 percent
larger?), oceanography, marine
biology, scuba physiology, under
water sign language, and of
course, first aid. The underwater
instruction takes place at
deGuerre Pool, and there are three
ocean dives at Monterey, where
the dramatic topography, clear
water and huge variety of marine
life make it an ideal spot for
divers.
"For those students who are
willing to read and listen, an "A"
in the course Is not hard to get,"
Donovan said. Those who score

more than 80 percent on the final
exam, show perfect attendance
and demonstrate proficiency in
personal watermanship and safe
diving knowledge receive the Na
tional Association of Underwater
Instructors (NAUI) Certificate.
This is just one of several diving
associations that subscribes to
the national standards. The certif
icate is necessary if students wish
to go diving alone and rent equip
ment.
Others may profit from the
course If they wish to take sum
mer courses at the Hopkins
Marine Station In Monterey Bay.
One such student, Tricia Lowe,
hopes to take marine biology
courses there this summer; a
prerequisite is possession of the
diving certificate.
Student divers who do not earn
the certificate can still pride them
selves on knowing how to better
plan and complete a safe, enjoy
able and successful dive. All are
invited to the class party at the
end of the term where a Stanford
alumnus and marine biologist,
who has done extensive travelling,
shows slides.
Drawbacks? Students enrolled
in the course may pay up to *400
on equipment, ocean rental, ad
ministration costs and reading
materials. "But It's worth the
money in the long run since you
get to keep most of the equip
ment," one student said.

forthcoming. It's sure worth it
when I see their faces after they've
been at the bottom of the pool for
the first time. They're absolutely
jubilant," Donovan said.
Donovan has been interested in
scuba diving ever since she
watched "Sea Hunt" for the first
time. She took her first scuba
class during her senior year at the

University of Wisconsin and loved
It — "even in the boring lakes."
After three years of experience of
diving In the midwest and Florida,
Donovan moved to California and
began teaching.
After earning her master's
degree in physical education at
San Francisco State, Donovan
came to Stanford in 1980 as a full
time instructor of aquatic classes.
All the students agreed the in
structor is excellent. "She's very
thorough, extremely knowl
edgeable and you can tell how
much she loves it," said one
diver."But although she makes
the class fun, she keeps it serious
at the same time, which is impor
tant because it's serious business
underwater. You can't screw up."
The three-unit academic course
encompasses a wide range of top
ics relating to diving, including
applied physics (Did you know
that refracted light makes objects
underwater appear 25 percent
larger?), oceanography, marine
biology, scuba physiology, under
water sign language, and of
course, first aid. The underwater
instruction takes place at
deGuerre Pool, and there are three
ocean dives at Monterey, where
the dramatic topography, clear
water and huge variety of marine
life make it an ideal spot for
divers.
"For those students who are
willing to read and listen, an "A"
in the course Is not hard to get,"
Donovan said. Those who score

more than 80 percent on the final
exam, show perfect attendance
and demonstrate proficiency in
personal watermanship and safe
diving knowledge receive the Na
tional Association of Underwater
Instructors (NAUI) Certificate.
This is just one of several diving
associations that subscribes to
the national standards. The certif
icate is necessary if students wish
to go diving alone and rent equip
ment.
Others may profit from the
course If they wish to take sum
mer courses at the Hopkins
Marine Station In Monterey Bay.
One such student, Tricia Lowe,
hopes to take marine biology
courses there this summer; a
prerequisite is possession of the
diving certificate.
Student divers who do not earn
the certificate can still pride them
selves on knowing how to better
plan and complete a safe, enjoy
able and successful dive. All are
invited to the class party at the
end of the term where a Stanford
alumnus and marine biologist,
who has done extensive travelling,
shows slides.
Drawbacks? Students enrolled
in the course may pay up to *400
on equipment, ocean rental, ad
ministration costs and reading
materials. "But It's worth the
money in the long run since you
get to keep most of the equip
ment," one student said.

If you're glancing through the spring quarter Time
Schedule looking for a class, Open Water 1 will be
sure to catch your eye. Scuba diving for recreational
divers in Monterey Bay can't be too rough.
"It's casual, friendly and you learn about some
thing that genuinely interests you," said one stu
dent. Diver Jose Fernandez enjoyed the class so
much he has made arrangements to dive with
friends he met in the class.
The course operates under a "buddy system" and
students switch buddies throughout the quarter.
Underwater, students are responsible for keeping in
contact with their buddies and helping them if ne
cessary. Why this system?
"It's like that expression — diving is like sex. you
can do it alone, but it's much more fun with another
person," joked instructor Sharon Donovan.
Although students in the class agree it is an
"awesome, fun experience," there is also work to be
done, exams to be taken and a paper to be written.
Indeed, one-fifth of the scheduled class time is
consumed in the classroom learning how to read dive
charts, discussing the reading or reviewing skills
learned in the water.
Donovan devotes her early
lectures to what she calls "diver at
titude." Such lectures stress the
importance of safety measures, re
sponsibility. proper commitment
and communication underwater.
"Students must realize that there
Is an important diving theory and
crucial safety considerations.
They must know the theory; the
sport can be dangerous," Donovan
said.
One handout given to the stu
dents in class offered advice In the
event of a shark attack: "If it
moves in. hit it with an object on
the snout using your fist as a last
resort, since the rough hide will
cut the skin." Has the class ever
had to worry with such advice?
Students in the class have "not
directly" had to use the shark at
tack advice, Donovan said. "Shark
attacks are very rare, and sharks
are easily put off by a group of
divers."
The beginners' class last fall
came closest to such a danger.
After arriving at Monterey Beach
for their first dive, the divers saw a
man who had obviously been at
tacked by a shark being pulled to
the shore at the other end of the
beach. Two students dialed 911
and the emergency vehicle took
the victim to the hospital where he
received 500 stitches.
"It was so incredibly unreal and
out of the blue. It was the first at
tack ever at that beach," Donovan
said. Needless to say, the class
moved to a different beach, where
it took an early lunch break.
"Any real dangers come from
just not paying attention,"
Donovan said, noting that two
students burst their ear drums
after failing to equalize their pres
sure. "Most students, however,
take all aspects of the course
seriously and results are
forthcoming. It's sure worth it
when I see their faces after they've
been at the bottom of the pool for
the first time. They're absolutely
jubilant," Donovan said.
