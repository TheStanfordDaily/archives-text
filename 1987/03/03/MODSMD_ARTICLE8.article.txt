Reagan withdraws nomination
WASHINGTON — Bowing to congressional opposition, Presi
dent Reagan withdrew the nomination of Robert Gates as director
of central Intelligence yesterday, and sources said former Sen.
John Tower, R-Texas, who chaired the special review board on the
Iran-contra scandal, has turned down the job.
White House Chief of Staff Howard Baker told reporters that
"certain contacts" on a new director are "still under way," but "we
do not yet have an acceptance." Informed Republican sources said
Brent Scowcroft, former national security adviser to President
Gerald Ford and a member of the Tower board, was one of several
candidates. Scowcroft was out of the country and could not be
reached for comment yesterday.
Sources said Tower had been the first choice of Baker, who
pushed hard for him, but that Tower turned down an offer from
the White House.
Reagan said Gates, currently acting director, requested that his
name be withdrawn. In a letter to the president, Gates cited
"strong sentiment in the Senate" to hold up his confirmation un
til after the Senate select committee on the Iran affair completes
its investigation. Gates said "a prolonged period of uncertainty
would be harmful" to the Central Intelligence Agency.
Reagan met with Gates yesterday and said he asked Gates to
continue as deputy director. "I have been Impressed with the class
he has shown under the enormous pressures of recent weeks,"
Reagan said In a statement. "At any other time, I am certain that
he would easily have been confirmed without delay."
Baker begins role as chief of staff
WASHINGTON — Former Sen. Howard Baker, making his first
appearance in the White House briefing room as President
Reagan's chief of staff, demonstrated yesterday that he takes his
new job more seriously than he takes himself.
Displaying the comfort of an accomplished political performer
who knows that he is following an unpopular act, Baker assured
reporters that he has no intention of becoming "prime minister,"
the unofficial title bestowed on and accepted by his fallen
predecessor, Donald Regan.
"I am acutely aware of the fact that Ronald Reagan is president
and I am not. and that my role and responsibility is to serve as his
chief of staff, to carry out his programs and proposals and to serve
him in whatever capacity I can in that role," Baker said.
The contrast with Regan could not have been more stark. In the
infrequent public appearances of his last months, Regan invari
ably was surrounded by a retinue of aides. He also used the im
perial "we" when referring to himself and the president.
Baker arrived yesterday with a single aide and without pomp
and circumstance. He said he intended to brief reporters regularly
and. In the relaxed manner of a man who does not mind new chal
lenges. he confessed that the job is more challenging than he had
anticipated.
Walsh criticizes North's lawsuit
WASHINGTON — Independent counsel Lawrence Walsh charged
yesterday that Lt. Col. Oliver North's lawsuit challenging the con
stitutionality of Walsh's appointment Is "a considered attempt to
disrupt" the Iran-contra investigation before anyone can be in
dicted.
Walsh said he was especially worried that Congress might grant
Immunity from prosecution to witnesses such as North while
Walsh's probe is tied up ir the courts. He said his inquiry could
grind to a halt as long as North's lawsuit is pending.
Saying that the litigation could "irreparably Injure" the probe,
Walsh filed a 45-page legal memo seeking dismissal of North's
complaint and asked a federal judge to act on it as soon as possi
ble.
A former National Security Council staff member at the center of
both the administration's secret arms sales to Iran and the contra
war against Nicaragua, North filed suit last week, challenging the
constitutionality of Walsh's appointment by a three-judge federal
court and asking for a restraining order to stop the investigation.
It was his first public action since December when he invoked his
Fifth Amendment privilege against testifying before Congress.
In a related development yesterday, sources said that the
Justice Department would probably finesse the constitutionality
issue by seeking dismissal of North's lawsuit strictly on
procedural grounds. U.S. Attorney Joseph diGenova told
reporters that the government would file a motion to dismiss, but
he told reporters that "we have not decided what the grounds for
the motion to dismiss will be. They could be procedural. They
could be substantive."
IRS simplifies W4 tax form
WASHINGTON — The Internal Revenue Service unveiled a
simplified version of its W-4 Income tax withholding form yester
day and announced it will not impose penalties for underwith
holding on any taxpayer who fills out either new form by June 1.
The simpler two-page W-4A form, issued by the IRS In response
to a storm of protest over the complexity of the earlier four-page
version, is expected to be available by mid-April.
In a heavily attended news conference, IRS Commissioner
Lawrence Glbbs defended the longer version as more accurate,
but acknowledged the new form is expected to be more useful for
many taxpayers.
The new worksheet is much easier to follow and It eliminates
the intimidating full-page table designed for families in which
both spouses work.
Taxpayers can choose either withholding form, since the earlier
form will still be made available for those seeking maximum ac
curacy.
The original W-4 form issued by the IRS for the first year of the
new tax law is more advantageous chiefly for taxpayers with sub
stantial income from non-wage sources such as rents or capital
gains and those who take advantage of various business-related
tax credits. It also allows high-income families with two wage
earners to reduce excessive withholding and come closer to
matching their actual tax liability.
Amal mutiny continues in Beirut
BEIRUT, Lebanon — Followers of a former official in the Shia
Moslem militia Amal continued their revolt yesterday against the
current Amal leadership in southern Lebanon as Amal leader
Nabih Berri returned to Beirut after four months in Damascus.
Witnesses said that armed Amal militiamen, followers of the
former president of the executive committee of Amal. Hassan Has
hem. remained near a key intersection linking the southern cities
of Nabatiyeh and Tyre to the coastal highway.
The armed revolt reportedly was launched Sunday afternoon
when Hashem's backers took over Amal's southern headquarters
in the village of Zifta, about 40 miles south of Beirut, and blocked
traffic at the intersection.
Sources close to Hashem said that the revolt took place as Amal
leaders and military figures were preparing to head south amid
the strict controls set up by Syrian forces to prevent any political
and military activity in West Beirut.

Reagan said Gates, currently acting director, requested that his
name be withdrawn. In a letter to the president, Gates cited
"strong sentiment in the Senate" to hold up his confirmation un
til after the Senate select committee on the Iran affair completes
its investigation. Gates said "a prolonged period of uncertainty
would be harmful" to the Central Intelligence Agency.
Reagan met with Gates yesterday and said he asked Gates to
continue as deputy director. "I have been Impressed with the class
he has shown under the enormous pressures of recent weeks,"
Reagan said In a statement. "At any other time, I am certain that
he would easily have been confirmed without delay."
Baker begins role as chief of staff
WASHINGTON — Former Sen. Howard Baker, making his first
appearance in the White House briefing room as President
Reagan's chief of staff, demonstrated yesterday that he takes his
new job more seriously than he takes himself.
Displaying the comfort of an accomplished political performer
who knows that he is following an unpopular act, Baker assured
reporters that he has no intention of becoming "prime minister,"
the unofficial title bestowed on and accepted by his fallen
predecessor, Donald Regan.
"I am acutely aware of the fact that Ronald Reagan is president
and I am not. and that my role and responsibility is to serve as his
chief of staff, to carry out his programs and proposals and to serve
him in whatever capacity I can in that role," Baker said.
The contrast with Regan could not have been more stark. In the
infrequent public appearances of his last months, Regan invari
ably was surrounded by a retinue of aides. He also used the im
perial "we" when referring to himself and the president.
Baker arrived yesterday with a single aide and without pomp
and circumstance. He said he intended to brief reporters regularly
and. In the relaxed manner of a man who does not mind new chal
lenges. he confessed that the job is more challenging than he had
anticipated.
Walsh criticizes North's lawsuit
WASHINGTON — Independent counsel Lawrence Walsh charged
yesterday that Lt. Col. Oliver North's lawsuit challenging the con
stitutionality of Walsh's appointment Is "a considered attempt to
disrupt" the Iran-contra investigation before anyone can be in
dicted.
Walsh said he was especially worried that Congress might grant
Immunity from prosecution to witnesses such as North while
Walsh's probe is tied up ir the courts. He said his inquiry could
grind to a halt as long as North's lawsuit is pending.
Saying that the litigation could "irreparably Injure" the probe,
Walsh filed a 45-page legal memo seeking dismissal of North's
complaint and asked a federal judge to act on it as soon as possi
ble.
A former National Security Council staff member at the center of
both the administration's secret arms sales to Iran and the contra
war against Nicaragua, North filed suit last week, challenging the
constitutionality of Walsh's appointment by a three-judge federal
court and asking for a restraining order to stop the investigation.
It was his first public action since December when he invoked his
Fifth Amendment privilege against testifying before Congress.
In a related development yesterday, sources said that the
Justice Department would probably finesse the constitutionality
issue by seeking dismissal of North's lawsuit strictly on
procedural grounds. U.S. Attorney Joseph diGenova told
reporters that the government would file a motion to dismiss, but
he told reporters that "we have not decided what the grounds for
the motion to dismiss will be. They could be procedural. They
could be substantive."
IRS simplifies W4 tax form
WASHINGTON — The Internal Revenue Service unveiled a
simplified version of its W-4 Income tax withholding form yester
day and announced it will not impose penalties for underwith
holding on any taxpayer who fills out either new form by June 1.
The simpler two-page W-4A form, issued by the IRS In response
to a storm of protest over the complexity of the earlier four-page
version, is expected to be available by mid-April.
In a heavily attended news conference, IRS Commissioner
Lawrence Glbbs defended the longer version as more accurate,
but acknowledged the new form is expected to be more useful for
many taxpayers.
The new worksheet is much easier to follow and It eliminates
the intimidating full-page table designed for families in which
both spouses work.
Taxpayers can choose either withholding form, since the earlier
form will still be made available for those seeking maximum ac
curacy.
The original W-4 form issued by the IRS for the first year of the
new tax law is more advantageous chiefly for taxpayers with sub
stantial income from non-wage sources such as rents or capital
gains and those who take advantage of various business-related
tax credits. It also allows high-income families with two wage
earners to reduce excessive withholding and come closer to
matching their actual tax liability.
Amal mutiny continues in Beirut
BEIRUT, Lebanon — Followers of a former official in the Shia
Moslem militia Amal continued their revolt yesterday against the
current Amal leadership in southern Lebanon as Amal leader
Nabih Berri returned to Beirut after four months in Damascus.
Witnesses said that armed Amal militiamen, followers of the
former president of the executive committee of Amal. Hassan Has
hem. remained near a key intersection linking the southern cities
of Nabatiyeh and Tyre to the coastal highway.
The armed revolt reportedly was launched Sunday afternoon
when Hashem's backers took over Amal's southern headquarters
in the village of Zifta, about 40 miles south of Beirut, and blocked
traffic at the intersection.
Sources close to Hashem said that the revolt took place as Amal
leaders and military figures were preparing to head south amid
the strict controls set up by Syrian forces to prevent any political
and military activity in West Beirut.

Reagan withdraws nomination
WASHINGTON — Bowing to congressional opposition, Presi
dent Reagan withdrew the nomination of Robert Gates as director
of central Intelligence yesterday, and sources said former Sen.
John Tower, R-Texas, who chaired the special review board on the
Iran-contra scandal, has turned down the job.
White House Chief of Staff Howard Baker told reporters that
"certain contacts" on a new director are "still under way," but "we
do not yet have an acceptance." Informed Republican sources said
Brent Scowcroft, former national security adviser to President
Gerald Ford and a member of the Tower board, was one of several
candidates. Scowcroft was out of the country and could not be
reached for comment yesterday.
Sources said Tower had been the first choice of Baker, who
pushed hard for him, but that Tower turned down an offer from
the White House.
Reagan said Gates, currently acting director, requested that his
name be withdrawn. In a letter to the president, Gates cited
"strong sentiment in the Senate" to hold up his confirmation un
til after the Senate select committee on the Iran affair completes
