# Soviets offer arms reductions

GENEVA — Soviet negotiators
yesterday formally put on the bar
gaining table here a proposal to
eliminate U.S. and Soviet
medium-range missiles in Europe
but did not specifically address
American concerns about remov
ing shorter-range missiles as well
and about verifying removal of
missiles.
A visiting bipartisan U.S. Sen
ate delegation said after talks with
both Soviet and U.S. negotiators
that it was optimistic that the two
sides could agree on those out
standing questions in the next
few months.
"I think that both of these prob
lems are obviously soluble. 1 think
they will be (solved), and I think
we're talking in terms of a very few
months, or even a period of
weeks," said Sen. Claiborne Pell,
D-R.1., at a news conference given
by the seven senators.
Pell, chairman of the Senate
Foreign Relations Committee and
co-chairman of the Senate obser
vers' group, said chances were
"excellent" that the United States
and the Soviet Union would ap

prove a treaty on medium-range
missiles before the end of the
Reagan administration.
Speaking at a press conference
in Moscow yesterday, Soviet offi
cials said they thought an agree
ment on medium-range weapons
could be concluded within six
months, and they hinted that
such an agreement could form the
basis for a third summit meeting
between Soviet leader Gorbachev
and President Reagan.
Gorbachev, meeting Monday
with Iceland's prime minster, said
the decision to move toward a sep
arate medium-range arms accord
could lead to "a serious shift"
toward disarmament, according
to the official Soviet news agency
Tass.
Gorbachev told Steingrimur
Hermannsson that the Soviet Un
ion hopes an agreement on
medium-range missiles will
"stimulate" talks on strategic
weapons reductions and halt the
withdrawal from the Anti-ballistic
Missile (ABM) Treaty.
U.S. and Soviet negotiators in
this Swiss capital agreed to extend

the current round of talks on
medium-range missiles beyond
the previously scheduled adjourn
ment date of Wednesday. U.S.
spokesman Terry Schroeder said.
The two sides agreed to the ex
tension over the weekend, follow
ing Gorbachev's announcement of
the new proposal Saturday,
Schroeder said. The U.S. delega
tion plans "shortly" to present its
own draft treaty on medium-range
missiles embodying the current
U.S. position, he said.
The surprise announcement by
Gorbachev to drop his previous in
sistence that any deal on medium
range missiles be contingent on
an overall pact affecting strategic
long-range missiles and setting
limits on space-based defenses
has removed at least one major
barrier standing in the way of a
possible agreement.
The other two sets of talks here
— on long-range missiles and on
space weapons — probably will ad
journ on Wednesday as planned
and resume in mid-April,
Schroeder said. Those talks are at
a stalemate principally because of

differences over the U.S space
based anti-missile project known
as the Strategic Defense Initiative
(SDI).
Both U.S. and Soviet officials
have said for months that
prospects were best for an accord
on medium-range missiles, be
cause the two countries were
closest on terms of a pact to
reduce them.
But negotiations in this field
had been stymied since the sum
mit meeting between Gorbachev
and Reagan in Iceland in October.
The Soviets insisted that an ac
cord reached there on medium
range missiles was acceptable only
if there were progress on restrict
ing research on SDI; the United
States rejected that condition.
The Soviets "delinked" the
medium-range missile issue from
SDI in their proposal yesterday,
Soviet spokesman Alexander
Monakhov said. But the Soviet
proposal consisted only of a
restatement of the position an
nounced by Gorbachev on Satur
day, he said.
