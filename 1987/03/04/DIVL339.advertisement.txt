How to go corporate without culture shock.
You've thought about leaving the ivy halls for corporate corridors
but big business means bureaucracy, right? Wrong. At Triton
Biosciences, a vigorous, young enterprise engaged in the R&D of
cancer diagnostics and therapeutics, you'll find an interactive,
open-minded atmosphere. A work-place that is -- dare we say it -
quite collegial. You see, we're too busy looking for breakthroughs
to bother with bureaucracy. In fact, the only features here likely to
trigger culture shock are competitive salaries and broader
opportunities. And that's not too hard to live with, is it?
