THOSE BASTARDS
ARE AT IT AGAIN
The Senate was hard a work the past couple of weeks, deciding the fate of several
Stanford groups. Angela Wood went through a four hour filibuster trying to kill
the KZSU bill. She died on the Senate floor.
This list tells you how each Senator voted on the following bills. A plus sign means
the Senator was present at the meeting, a minus means he was absent or sleeping.
February 10
I. A bill to amend the ASSU Renovation Bill. This would have diverted the money
($87,000) to student groups. It was defeated 4-16. Too bad. Sponsor: Bob Griffin.
II. To pass the Renovation Bill. (You can read about this wacky and wonderful bill
elsewhere on this page.) Passed 16-4. Hey. Look! 16-4. And the bill above was 4-
16. Funny how that works. Sponsor: Carey White.
February 24
III. This bill put the bulk of the Special Fees on the ballot. Everybody said "YES" to
this one. 15-love.
IV. A bill to put KZSU's divided fee back together. KZSU is great. Where else can
you hear the Neighborhoods, the Lyres, the Replacements, and the Jam? Not on
"Live 105." But apparently the Senate thought it wise to keep the fee divided.
Defeated 8-9. It was a hard battle. Six senators wounded. Jake Madden had to be
pried from Vivian Wu's neck. But he's always like that. Sponsor: John van Loben
Sels
V. To keep LSJUMB II recommendation at "NO." Passed 11-6.
VI. To change the Chapparal recommendation to "YES." Defeated 7-8. The re
commendation is "NEUTRAL." But what does the Senate know, anyway?
Chaparral Lampoon March 6 — so I hear.
VII. This bill allows groups of Senators to run on one platform. What a great idea.
Just imagine. We can have a group of Pi Phi's run against a group of DG's. Or a
group of Kappas run against the Sigma Chi's. Yuck. Passed 13-4. God help us.
