RADIOACTIVE WASTE CHANGES
NORMAL STANFORD GROUPS INTO
MONEY-HUNGRY HAIRLESS FIENDS
You will see this list again in the Spring. When you vote. These are the (\
groups asking for Special Fees, which range from $7,000 to $75,000. \
(Notice how small the ASSU News fee is. We're so damn efficient.) This
money comes from your pocket, so think about which groups deserve
money and which ones don't. But remember one thing. If it weren't for
the ASSU News, you wouldn't even be reading this list.
