# ASSU votes to postpone election date
## 
### MONIQUE SCHEER Senior staff writer 
In Its final meeting of the quarter, the ASSU Sen
ate last night voted to move the dates of the spring
elections from April 14-15 to April 28-29 In order to
avoid conflicts with Passover and Easter.
The senate also amended the spring ballot, approv
ing the placement of a general fee for community ser
vice and adding changes to special fee requests for
the Band and the Concert Network.
In the open forum, Steve Baer, a candidate for the
Council of Presidents (COP) in the upcoming elec
tion, asked the senate to consider moving the elec
tion dates because they conflicted with Passover, a
Jewish holiday.
Since Passover starts April 13 and lasts about a
week, he said Jewish students who go home for that
holiday would miss one of the election days and that
the three Jewish candidates on his slate would miss
important campaign days.
Scheduling the elections for the following week
would place them immediately after Easter, causing
inconveniences for Christian students and candi
dates who choose to go home for that holiday.
But some senators argued that elections two weeks
into the quarter would inconvenience the newly
elected senate, perhaps forcing it to meet several
times a week at the end of the quarter.
The fact that an extraordinarily high number of
COP slates will be running in the spring election was
a major source of concern for the senators opposing
the election date change. The large number of slates
will probably force the election into a runoff, further
delaying the final consolidation of the ASSU.
One of the authors of the bill to change the election
date, Senator David Fallek, said that changing the
dates of the election would cause only "minor incon
venience to the (newly elected) senate."
Senator Danny Berns denied the importance of
such an inconvenience, saying the issue was one of
principle. "If we respect religion at all, we should
move the date," he said.
The senate voted 14-1 to move the election dates
