WASHINGTON — President Reagan told the
revamped National Security Council staff yes
terday not to skirt the laws of the nation or
take shortcuts past other government agencies
in developing foreign policy options for him.
In a rare and private visit with the
beleaguered staff, Reagan endorsed the recom
mendations last week of the presidential com
mission headed by former Sen. John Tower, R-
Texas, on reigning in the staffs ambitious
foreign policy activities, according to White
House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater.
Conducting a daylong overture leading up to
his speech tonight on the Iran-contra scandal.
Reagan also paid a hastily announced visit to
the White House briefing room to promote an
arms-control effort disclosed a day earlier by
an administration official. It was Reagan's first

appearance in the press room since Nov. 25.
the day that details of the Iran-contra connec
tion were first brought to light.
Reagan's activities behind the scenes and in
front of television cameras, in addition to his
appointment of former Sen. Howard Baker. R-
Tenn., as his new chief of staff, appear to have
been carefully orchestrated to counter the
image offered by the Tower panel of a hands-off
president who failed to adequately preside over
his own White House.
Moreover, they set the scene for the nation
ally broadcast address — Reagan's first lengthy
discussion of the Iran affair and the issues it
has raised since his most recent news confer
ence more than three months ago.
White House officials indicated that Reagan
would use the speech to address concerns

about the depth of his involvement in White
House operations in general and national se
curity issues in particular.
"With everything on the line, he'll do every
thing he needs to do. He will explain his
reasoning for trying to do what he did and at
least seek understanding, and express his
views — Including his anger — on some of the
things going on around him," said a Republi
can source close to officials preparing the
speech.
The Tower commission's criticism was
much harsher than presidential assistants
had anticipated, confronting them with a
strong, immediate challenge to show that the
administration will be able to take charge of
the issues in its final 23 months.
