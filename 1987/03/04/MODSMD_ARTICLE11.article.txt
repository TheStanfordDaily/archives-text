# Veteran recounts espionage work

Geology Prof. Marco Einaudi had to look
up Vietnam on a map when he was ordered
to go there. Twenty-five years later, he
recalled that "It was strange to go to a
country I virtually knew nothing about. 1 felt
like an Individual who had been dropped
into a place totally foreign and without any
preparation." Einaudi spoke before a crowd
of about 50 people in Alondra Monday night.
He recounted his experiences as an Army
intelligence officer in South Vietnam in
1962-63. After being trained in "all the kinds
of things you learn about when you go to a
James Bond movie," such as picking locks,
writing in secret code and taking
photographs at night, he was assigned to
recruit Vietnamese for future U.S. intelli
gence use.
He called his "cover" as an Italian geologist
"a natural one. I didn't have the backing of

the U.S. Army for a cover. I carried one piece
of identification: a membership to the Italian
Alpine Club."
In his experience, the Viet Cong guerrillas
were "a lot more effective" than the United
States and South Vietnam at propaganda
and social reform.
"At the first sign of progress, the South
Vietnamese would try to stop it,"he said.
"The war was beneficial to the leaders and
generals, who built lavish villas along the
coast. It was clear that there was a major ad
vantage to those in power to keep lings
going. So my activities in Saigon were cur
tailed, and I really doubt if what we were
doing was effective."
Einaudi added that much of the United
States' assistance in the early 1960s was in
effective. Much of the *1 million of daily aid
"never made it down to the villages. It prob
ably disappeared into the pockets of the
colonels."

Food donated by the American public was
often of the wrong sort. Instead of rice or
fish, Americans sent cans of cheddar cheese,
and the profits from the sale of such items
went to the South Vietnamese leaders.
"The strength of the Viet Cong was in
creasing, despite what was being reported in
this country," said Einaudi, who upon his
return wrote that the South Vietnamese
leader. Ngo Diem, "wasn't aware of what was
happening. His advisers didn't tell him the
truth, which sounds strangely familiar.'"
Einaudi wrote down his feelings "out of
frustration" when he wasn't debriefed upon
his return to the United States or given the
chance to voice "things that the military
should have been interested in.
"The presidential administrations were
relatively honest in terms of what they
thought was happening. The main problem
was not being able to grasp where ihe situa
tion might lead." said Einaudi.
