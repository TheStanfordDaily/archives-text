# Corrections

### 
A story in yesterday's Daily
incorrectly stated the require
ments for summer courses at
the Hopkins Marine Station. A
diving certificate is not a neces

sary prerequisite for classes
there.
The caption to a photo of
"West Side Story" cast mem
bers was also incorrect. Group
tickets for the play go on sale
tomorrow; individual tickets go
on sale Monday.
