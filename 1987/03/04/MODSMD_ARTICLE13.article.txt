Last week, the University again refused to
vote in a shareholder resolution regarding
Hewlett-Packard's operations in South
Africa. The failure to vote has brought into
serious question the credibility of University
policy toward companies with business in
South Africa.
In February 1986 the University abstained
from voting on a shareholder resolution that
would have forced H-P to stop selling com
puters to the South African government. At
the time, the chairman of the University's
Committee on Investment Responsibility
(CIR) said the abstention did not represent a
departure from the goal of using sharehold
ings to push for change. One year later, Stan
ford failed to vote in a resolution calling for
H-P's withdrawal from South Africa.
In rejecting total divestment, administra
tors argued that the University could support
sanctions in Congress, pursue a case-by-case
policy of selective divestment from compan
ies that were not aiding progress and influ
ence companies' policies through share
holder resolutions. University President
Donald Kennedy actively supported the sanc
tions and the University has pursued a
selective divestment policy. While the divest
ment policy may be so selective it hardly is a
divestment policy at all, the University has
definitely fallen short on promoting progress
through participation in shareholder resolu
tions. The University should decide how it is
going to vote on shareholder resolutions and
exercise its right to vote. In short, the Univer
sity should practice what it preaches.
The CIR has recommended to the Board of
Trustees that it vote for divestment from
companies with a Sullivan Principles rating

of II unless a company's record or "level of
commitment" leads the CIR to believe that
the company is an "unusually progressive
force."
H-P has a rank of 11, due in part to the
deplorable racial composition of its South
African work force: 12 blacks and 36 Asians
and colored among 261 employees. H-P
should be hard-pressed to defend its pres
ence there as a benefit to black South
Africans. The CIR has advised the University
to communicate to H-P its concern with H-P's
substandard efforts to promote racial
equality in South Africa, but this recommen
dation is damaged by Stanford's refusal to
vote in resolutions.
The University owns more than 850,000
shares of H-P stock worth about $35 million.
No one needs to be told how close the rela
tionship between H-P and Stanford is. The
University should consider the H-P case
fairly, with minimal hand-holding, and be
willing to blast the company if it does not
soon improve.
Stanford will have the opportunity to vote
on at least 50 withdrawal resolutions this
year. The University should take advantage
of these assessments of shareholder opinion
by participating in the votes. Stanford may
decide to vote against some resolutions, but
the University should at least vote one way or
the other. Pressure for total divestment
began at Stanford more than 10 years ago.
The University has been dragging its feet for
too long, and should improve its somewhat
feeble attempts to promote progress in South
Africa. It is time the University put its mouth
where its money is.
