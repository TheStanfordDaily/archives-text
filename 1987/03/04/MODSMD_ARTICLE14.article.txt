# Concert Network is OK

### 
I was surprised by Jim Durkin's attitude toward
the Concert Network (Daily, Feb. 17). Certainly, a
student unfamiliar with the problems unique to
concert-producing at Stanford has the right to ques
tion the purpose of the Concert Network. But I would
have expected Durkin to be more responsible and ac
curate in his analysis of the "facts." If anyone should
know the facts, Jim Durkin should — he was promo
tions director for the Concert Network last year, one
fact he neglected to mention in his column. To clarify
some of the "problems" mentioned:

LINDA CHRISTIE

□ It Is true that Bill Graham Presents does not need
Stanford as a venue for concerts. However, to
describe the Concert Network's relationship with
BGP as "deteriorated" is misleading. During the
summer of 1985, while Durkin was promotions di
rector, the Concert Network and Bill Graham
Presents agreed to a series of six shows to be
produced at Stanford over the course of the summer
and fall. Bill Graham Presents pulled out of this
agreement. A Grateful Dead show scheduled for that
summer was canceled due to miscommunication,
and the Concert Network took steps to rectify the sit
uation by hiring a new director. The Grateful Dead
returned last May for two sold-out shows produced
by the Concert Network and Bill Graham Presents.
□ It is true that the Concert Network did not and
does not have the funds to produce a large concert
without a producer like Bill Graham. However, the
original net fee asessment from the ASSU was not
$50,000 or >60,000, as Durkin claims, but only
<36,750. And a show with Tom Petty and the
Heartbreakers in Frost would cost about twice as
much as Durkin figures — *50,000 to *60,000.
□ It is true that staff members' salaries total a few
thousand a year and the salary of the Concert Net
work adviser is *12,000. I can't seem to recall Jim
complaining that he was getting paid too much
when he picked up his checks last year. Concert Net
work staff salaries are on par with ASSU project
manager salaries. The concert adviser is a profes
sional who came to Stanford with four years of
concert-producing experience at Texas A&M, where
concerts of the magnitude Durkin mentioned —
such as Billy Idol and Madonna — are produced.
This "innovation" of the new charter provides
valuable staff support so that another *100,000
mistake — which caused the two-year moratorium
on concerts — is not made. The present reserve is
still around *30,000, as Durkin mentions — suc
cesses and failures combined. What this means is
that the network has been self-supporting for three
years. The resources have not been drained, as
Durkin claims; rather, for the most part, they've
been maintained.
I find it interesting that Durkin would complain
about the network bringing jazz and comedy to Stan
ford. He claims the Concert Network "was more con
cerned with keeping the organization afloat than
with fulfilling student entertainment needs" when it
scheduled these events. Last spring. Promotions Di
rector Durkin conducted a survey to find out what

Stanford students would like to see the Concert Net
work bring to Stanford. His findings showed that
jazz and comedy were high on students' lists.
The comedy talent brought to campus this year is
provided by Bob Fisher, the owner of the Holy City
Zoo in San Francisco, where Robin Williams and
many other fine comedians began their careers. Con
cert Network produces top-billed comedy shows;
STARTS presents lesser-known comedians. Durkin
complains the price for Concert Network comedy is
on the high side. The price for an evening of top-bill
comic entertainment in San Francisco would not
only cost more for the ticket, but you'd need to figure
in the cost of gas and parking, as well as driving
time.
And what about those concerts during Dead Week,
the impossibility of small-name rock bands on Wil
bur Field and the use of Frost? After being involved
with the Red Hot Chili Peppers concert last year,
which took place on a Friday night of a three-day
weekend, Durkin shouldn't have to ask these ques
tions. He knows as well as anyone else involved with
concert-producing at Stanford that booking facilities
on campus just isn't easy. There are few facilities
that can accommodate concerts at Stanford, and
those that can already have holds placed on them
from organizations with priority on the space.
Memorial Auditorium is claimed by the Drama De
partment, Ram's Head and Lively Arts. Dinkelspiel is
claimed by the Music Department and Lively Arts.
Wilbur Field has a noise tolerance level that must be
respected for surrounding neighborhoods. Maples
Pavilion needs to have a structural study completed
and analyzed — at a cost of nearly *20,000 — before
any talk of concerts can begin. Frost can only be used
during certain months of the year, and then Univer
sity functions and ceremonies take precedence.
1 don't think the Concert Network has what
Durkin terms "the wrong philosophy." It's true that
the Concert Network cannot afford to lose money,
but that's just good business sense. The network has
been self-supporting for the past three years, build
ing on a base of smaller concerts and gaining experi
ence in producing smaller events. To attain the next
level of concert production, to bring the kind of con
certs Durkin and most Stanford students — includ
ing the staff at the Concert Network — would like to
see, will take money. But to "break the mold of the
Concert Network," as Durkin suggests, is ridiculous.
Stanford is not like other universities. Why throw
away the experience gained over the past three years
and the relationships developed with organizations
vital to the continuation of concerts at Stanford such
as University Events and Services, the Stanford
Police Department and the Public Affairs Office? The
problems unique to Stanford are not going to go
away with the creation of yet another Concert Net
work. It is going to take money to produce major con
certs. The Concert Network needs student support in
the upcoming fee assessment election if a higher
level of concert production is going to happen at
Stanford. Such an important issue deserves better
than one person's irresponsibility in presenting the
"facts."

and fall. Bill Graham Presents pulled out of this
agreement. A Grateful Dead show scheduled for that
summer was canceled due to miscommunication,
and the Concert Network took steps to rectify the sit
uation by hiring a new director. The Grateful Dead
returned last May for two sold-out shows produced
by the Concert Network and Bill Graham Presents.
□ It is true that the Concert Network did not and
does not have the funds to produce a large concert
without a producer like Bill Graham. However, the
original net fee asessment from the ASSU was not
$50,000 or >60,000, as Durkin claims, but only
<36,750. And a show with Tom Petty and the
Heartbreakers in Frost would cost about twice as
much as Durkin figures — *50,000 to *60,000.
□ It is true that staff members' salaries total a few
thousand a year and the salary of the Concert Net
work adviser is *12,000. I can't seem to recall Jim
complaining that he was getting paid too much
when he picked up his checks last year. Concert Net
work staff salaries are on par with ASSU project
manager salaries. The concert adviser is a profes
sional who came to Stanford with four years of
concert-producing experience at Texas A&M, where
concerts of the magnitude Durkin mentioned —
such as Billy Idol and Madonna — are produced.
This "innovation" of the new charter provides
valuable staff support so that another *100,000
mistake — which caused the two-year moratorium
on concerts — is not made. The present reserve is
still around *30,000, as Durkin mentions — suc
cesses and failures combined. What this means is
that the network has been self-supporting for three
years. The resources have not been drained, as
Durkin claims; rather, for the most part, they've
been maintained.
I find it interesting that Durkin would complain
about the network bringing jazz and comedy to Stan
ford. He claims the Concert Network "was more con
cerned with keeping the organization afloat than
with fulfilling student entertainment needs" when it
scheduled these events. Last spring. Promotions Di
rector Durkin conducted a survey to find out what

Stanford students would like to see the Concert Net
work bring to Stanford. His findings showed that
jazz and comedy were high on students' lists.
The comedy talent brought to campus this year is
provided by Bob Fisher, the owner of the Holy City
Zoo in San Francisco, where Robin Williams and
many other fine comedians began their careers. Con
cert Network produces top-billed comedy shows;
STARTS presents lesser-known comedians. Durkin
complains the price for Concert Network comedy is
on the high side. The price for an evening of top-bill
comic entertainment in San Francisco would not
only cost more for the ticket, but you'd need to figure
in the cost of gas and parking, as well as driving
time.
And what about those concerts during Dead Week,
the impossibility of small-name rock bands on Wil
bur Field and the use of Frost? After being involved
with the Red Hot Chili Peppers concert last year,
which took place on a Friday night of a three-day
weekend, Durkin shouldn't have to ask these ques
tions. He knows as well as anyone else involved with
concert-producing at Stanford that booking facilities
on campus just isn't easy. There are few facilities
that can accommodate concerts at Stanford, and
those that can already have holds placed on them
from organizations with priority on the space.
Memorial Auditorium is claimed by the Drama De
partment, Ram's Head and Lively Arts. Dinkelspiel is
claimed by the Music Department and Lively Arts.
Wilbur Field has a noise tolerance level that must be
respected for surrounding neighborhoods. Maples
Pavilion needs to have a structural study completed
and analyzed — at a cost of nearly *20,000 — before
any talk of concerts can begin. Frost can only be used
during certain months of the year, and then Univer
sity functions and ceremonies take precedence.
1 don't think the Concert Network has what
Durkin terms "the wrong philosophy." It's true that
the Concert Network cannot afford to lose money,
but that's just good business sense. The network has
been self-supporting for the past three years, build
ing on a base of smaller concerts and gaining experi
ence in producing smaller events. To attain the next
level of concert production, to bring the kind of con
certs Durkin and most Stanford students — includ
ing the staff at the Concert Network — would like to
see, will take money. But to "break the mold of the
Concert Network," as Durkin suggests, is ridiculous.
Stanford is not like other universities. Why throw
away the experience gained over the past three years
and the relationships developed with organizations
vital to the continuation of concerts at Stanford such
as University Events and Services, the Stanford
Police Department and the Public Affairs Office? The
problems unique to Stanford are not going to go
away with the creation of yet another Concert Net
work. It is going to take money to produce major con
certs. The Concert Network needs student support in
the upcoming fee assessment election if a higher
level of concert production is going to happen at
Stanford. Such an important issue deserves better
than one person's irresponsibility in presenting the
"facts."

I was surprised by Jim Durkin's attitude toward
the Concert Network (Daily, Feb. 17). Certainly, a
student unfamiliar with the problems unique to
concert-producing at Stanford has the right to ques
tion the purpose of the Concert Network. But I would
have expected Durkin to be more responsible and ac
curate in his analysis of the "facts." If anyone should
know the facts, Jim Durkin should — he was promo
tions director for the Concert Network last year, one
fact he neglected to mention in his column. To clarify
some of the "problems" mentioned:

□ It Is true that Bill Graham Presents does not need
Stanford as a venue for concerts. However, to
describe the Concert Network's relationship with
BGP as "deteriorated" is misleading. During the
summer of 1985, while Durkin was promotions di
rector, the Concert Network and Bill Graham
Presents agreed to a series of six shows to be
produced at Stanford over the course of the summer
and fall. Bill Graham Presents pulled out of this
