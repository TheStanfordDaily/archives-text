Film portrays
women poorly
The film "Salvador" exposed
and delineated the Immoral role
of the United States in Central
America. It summarized well the
plight of the powerless against
the ravages of power-hungry

factions with Images of irrational
and merciless slaughter.
However, there existed an al
most hypocritical aspect to the
film. The hero. Richard Boyle,
who admirably traveled the moral
high road of politics, confined
idealism to his work. His personal
attitudes — and apparent pride
in them — were quite incompat
ible with compassionate respect
for people's rights and dignity. In

this. I am referring to his treat
ment of women.
His stereotyping of whores, the
girl next door, naive beauties and
ambitious career women left little
room for respectable female char
acters. Women were nothing but
faceless forms and tantalizing
seductions.
These chauvinistic violations
were made more possible by the

shallow characterizations of the
women. I was greatly disturbed by
this rigid and ancient method of
shutting women Into boxes. It did
nothing but Inject a little bit of
Indiana Jones Into Richard Boyle,
and was completely Inappropriate
for a serious study of the crimes
of human nature.
