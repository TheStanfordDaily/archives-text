# Mac Death at Stanford
## 
### 
People die by the thousands every year here at
Stanford — and nobody knows about it. It's all a big
secret. Go ahead — ask Dean Jean about all the
deaths and she'll say, "Deaths? What deaths?" I can
smell a cover-up for miles.
A certain number of students are Macintoshed to
death. This hideous method is suffered by students
who fail to return their library disks after two hours.
There is a grace period for these sinners, but if too
much time goes by. the librarians press a small red
button on the loan desk which immediately turns

the student into a bat. (You wondered where all the
bats came from in Meyer. Well, now you know.) A
similar fate is suffered by those who use the library's
Macs without checking out software. The bats are
killed with a batacide. Librarians are tired of being
quiet, and they're not going to take it anymore.
I lost a dear friend to a Macintosh, but it occurred
in a different manner. He was copying files from one
disk to another when something went terribly
wrong. Instead of inserting one of his disks, he in
serted himself. His struggling was to no avail. 1 tried
to save him. but the machine told me the operation
could not be undone. I saved him as someone else
and tried to print him out. but it was too late. I un
derstand this happens rather often — when I went to
Terman to use the LaserWriter. I clicked "Page Set-
Up" and noticed there was a picture of another
trapped man. How sad.
Occasionally, students die in the Physics Tank.
This only happens, however, if you sit in the high al
titude section in the back of the room and try to pay
attention. There's just not enough air up there to
contemplate science. The best defense against this
sort of death is sleep. The body needs less oxygen
when it is dreaming.
Several people in my house are candidates for
death by soda. I wore red and white yesterday, and
three people tried to drink me. They claimed I looked
like a Diet Coke. One girl had withdrawal symptoms
after 20 minutes without a NutraSweet fix. There are
a few warning signs to this demise: an inability to
swallow water, illegible handwriting caused by grip
ping cans too tightly, a desire to fizz instead of
breathe and an intense fear of being shaken up.
When these people are found lying about the house,
we recycle them.
Most deaths occur by bicycle. I see people die every
day while I'm riding around campus. Kamikaze
bikers barrel through crowds of pedestrians without
blinking. Cars on Campus Drive swerve to force
bikers off the road. Bollards materialize out of thin
air. Just looking at a bike is dangerous. My bike is a
finely tuned machine. It has 10 gears and only works
in fifth. The front brakes aren't connected, but the

back brakes have a tendency to contract all by them
selves — usually when I'm going downhill very
rapidly. I shouldn't complain since this attribute did
once save my life. I was hurtling toward a large sta
tionary object (namely, the Chemistry Building)
when the brakes grabbed and I plunged headfirst
onto the ground. After skidding for several hundred
yards, I used my nose as a brake. But I missed the
building. However, the incident almost caused the
death by laughing of a passer-by. and then he nar
rowly escaped death by pummeling.
Death by stupidity is often Involved in death by
bicycle. I was turning to the right around our brand
new traffic circle when I was hit from the left. My col
lision partner maintained that he didn't know about
the traffic circle — even though he had just run over
it. Death by pummeling reared Its ugly head here too,
but maintenance workers pulled me off him. What
good is a traffic circle if no one pays attention to It?
There is death by sex, but then again, this is Stan-

Death by iron pot is a rare but nasty demise. This
only occurs in houses that have open kitchens.
Whenever a pot or pan is used but not washed, the
offender is beaten with it — burnt-on eggs and all. It
is rather like a stoning — a cleansing experience for
everyone involved. Death by cheddar cheese is the
punishment for those who make nachos and don't
wash their plates. The hardened cheese is chiseled
off and used in sadistic and horrible ways.
Death by deadline usually occurs around 5 p.m.
Pedaling furiously toward the professor's office,
people simply blip out of existence. Their time runs
out. (At this moment, I can see death approaching as
it gets later and later and this column gets sillier and
sillier.)
Surprisingly, the myth of all campus deaths is
death by boredom. It has never been documented
that people have actually been bored to death,
though the rumor is constantly circulating. Sorry,
folks, it's just not a legitimate way to go.

back brakes have a tendency to contract all by them
selves — usually when I'm going downhill very
rapidly. I shouldn't complain since this attribute did
once save my life. I was hurtling toward a large sta
tionary object (namely, the Chemistry Building)
when the brakes grabbed and I plunged headfirst
onto the ground. After skidding for several hundred
yards, I used my nose as a brake. But I missed the
building. However, the incident almost caused the
death by laughing of a passer-by. and then he nar

Death by stupidity is often Involved in death by
bicycle. I was turning to the right around our brand
new traffic circle when I was hit from the left. My col
lision partner maintained that he didn't know about

wash their plates. The hardened cheese is chiseled
off and used in sadistic and horrible ways.
Death by deadline usually occurs around 5 p.m.
Pedaling furiously toward the professor's office,
people simply blip out of existence. Their time runs
out. (At this moment, I can see death approaching as
it gets later and later and this column gets sillier and
sillier.)
Surprisingly, the myth of all campus deaths is
death by boredom. It has never been documented
that people have actually been bored to death,
though the rumor is constantly circulating. Sorry,
folks, it's just not a legitimate way to go.
