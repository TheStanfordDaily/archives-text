# ASSU MUTANT NEWS
## "THAT SILLY, INCOMPREHENSIBLE PAGE" PROBABLY THE MOST IMPORTANT THING YOU'LL READ IN YOUR MISERABLE LIFE 
### 
For those of you who just tuned in, let me introduce you to the
ASSU NEWS. Volume 2, Number 9. This is the newsletter of
your friendly student government. The NEWS lets you know
what the ASSU is doing. Or what they're not doing. Actually,
you might find that we're quite mena to the ASSU, especially
when it fucks up. Through the ASSU NEWS, you can find out
how every Senator voted, what jobs are available, what
committees you can be on, how to french kiss, and what
"Cooper's ligaments" are. Why put it in the Daily? Because
people read the Daily, and they wouldn't read a separate
newspaper if we put one out. And it's probably the only page in
the Daily that the word "poophead" would appear on. Hey. It's
paid for.
We want to know what you think of the ASSU. Or the COP. Or
the USA. Damn it, tell us what you think about your roommate.
The ASSU NEWS wants to hear from you. Remember what they
said: You can make a difference. Or at least cause a big stink.
Send all letters, editorials, opinions, condoms, and ideas to the
following address:

Don't forget the stamp. Try to use cool stamps, if you can.
