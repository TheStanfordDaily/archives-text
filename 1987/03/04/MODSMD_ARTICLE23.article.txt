MUTATIONS IN PROGRESS
Did you see Poltergeist, where the big pulsating orange throat in the
wall sucked everything in the house up into it? Big long orange tongue
that snatched the girl and dragged her to hell? Well look out, baby,
because it's coming to visit you. Well, maybe not yon, unless you come
down to ASSU. We decided to blow out our space and rebuild it to
make it work (well, to make it work better, anyway. The only way it's
going to really work is if they give us the deck to build more room on).
So lots of stuff (everything) is going to change and some stuff is going
to be hard to use while all the walls are flying around. Like there
wasn't enough weird shit at ASSU already.
ASSU is about to undergo a massive renovation project, starting
tomorrow — Thursday, March sth — and running to next month
sometime. If you ever have to deal with us, here's what you should
know:
Lecture Notes goes right into a new space on Thursday. You can
keept getting notes this quarter, right up until the end of Finals,
in that new location.
T-Shirts jumps around — first to White Plaza, then to an office
facing the Tresidder second-floor back deck — before landing at
their new space, which will be on the second-floor front walkway
of Tresidder.
Legal Counseling stays in the COP for a while on the hamock.
Then they go back to their regular space.
***The Business Office — yes, the checks, payroll, and cash —
squeezes into a corner in their old space for a while. Use the
Business Office may have to shut down for a few days over
Spring Break. Beware!***
All our other projects with offices — Speakers Bureau, Elections
Commission, and many othersd — will operate on different
schedules depending on ;which they are. We'll work something
out.
One important fact: the front doors of ASSU will usually be locked during
construction and will always be locked at night during construction. It's
dangerous in there. Big dudes running around cutting out walls with
chainsaws.
This stuff will be over sometime in April. While it's on it'll be dusty
and crowded inside in the Business Office, but hey, it'll be okay. Really!
