# GENERALISSIMO FEESISCO (FORMERLY GENERAL FEES)
## 
### 
A vote of the students either raises, leaves unchanged, or
lowers the amount of each General Fee. The key word here is
general. This fee is all-encompassing. In May, after the election
results are in, the Senate, that happy group of men and women
who meet at the Law School every Tuesday night while you go
out for Fro Yo ro Beer Yo, well, the Senate allocates the money
for the upcoming year. Most of it disappears right away in the
Annual Funding cycle. The rest of it is stashed away for the six
Discretionary Funding cycles that occur throughout the year.
And, of course, some of it used for drugs and beer. You don't ex
pect us to sit around and vote on things all bloody day, do you?
Shut up.
There will be three General Fees this year.
1) Program Board General Fee: Students will vote to raise,
lower, or keep this fee at a total of $143,800. (The 86-87 level).
Then six students get together as the Program Board and inter
rogate groups and make recommendations to the Senate. This is
the largest fee and any group other than publications can dig into
this fund. We use it regularly under the auspices of the Stanford
Tsing Garanjas Club. Our charter says that Tsing Garanjas is a
martial art. Actually, Tsing Garanjas just means "big tits," and we
use the money to finance any prostitute who runs for political of
fice. Kind of like a subgroup of Stanford in Government.
2) Publications Board General Fee: Yup. The money of this
fee ($40,200 unless you raise or lower it) is allocated to publica
tions groups. Publication leaders and Senators meet as the Pub
Board to make recs to the Senate. But those silly kids down at
Cardinal Sin thought this board was set up especially for them.
It was a confusing meeting, when the managerr of the new stu
dent pub came rushing in to the COP office:
CARDINAL SIN DUDE: Like, forty thousand bucks! We can
get Coors and Coors Light now!! Pub board!! What a great idea!! I
just had to come and say thank you.
COP CAREY WHITE: Well, actually...
CS: Seriously, this is great, man. We can pay our staff and
everything now.
COP: It's the Pub board. Pub, as in Publications, not as in beer.
CS: Oh. That's different then. Fuck off.
3) COMMUNITY SERVICE GENERAL FEE: This fee is new,
and therefore must go through a special process. Two-thirds of
those students voting have to approve it first, and then (on the
ballot) they vote to raise or lower the base rate (still to be
| set). This service projects, (i.e., tutoring programs, community
\ .health programs, and other volunteer efforts).
