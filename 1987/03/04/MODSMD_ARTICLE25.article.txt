# FALLOUT ON CLOTHES?

### 
rcememDer tne asked you on our flyer in January
whether you liked drycleaning or video better? Well, the
drycleaning racked up in phone calls back to us. And we got
some good prices on drycleaning. So we may do that as a
new project soon.
Also, it looks like we'd have to be seriously mentally defi
cient to go into video when you can rent the damn things
from a vending machine at Payless. Probably gives better
service than we could, too. Certainly holds hours more
consistently.
There may be a serious drycleaning service here in ASSU
or elsewhere in Tresidder soon (this geological epoch).
Thank you, thank you for calling the Council of Presidents!
In fact, you cal call the COP at 723-1465 ANYTIME. Tell
them anything. Tell them your midterm grades. Tell them
what type condom you prefer. Tell them where to go.
That's why they bought the machine.
