## Bill Hewlett retires after a life of achievement 
### CAROLYNE ZINKO 
Once upon a time, two young
men graduated from college. They
set up shop In a garage with *538
and tinkered a lot, building com
plicated electronic machines.
Then they started selling their
machines to big companies for a
lot of money. They also hired
many employees who worked hap
pily under a special management
plan the young men devised.
After many years, the two men
became the world's largest pro
ducers of the special electronic
machines and made more than *7
billion a year In profits — all with
out ever having to lay off a single
employee.

Finally, one of the two men
decided he had worked long and
hard enough and retired.
Last Tuesday, William Hewlett
officially stepped out of both the
fairy tale and his position as vice
chairman of the board at Hewlett-
Packard, the corporation he and
Stanford classmate David Packard
started in 1939.
During his 48-year career,
Hewlett achieved success most

only dream of. Often called one of
the founders of Silicon Valley and
a pioneer of the electronics and
computer Industry, Hewlett shies
away from such titles. He won't
take credit for the birth of Silicon
Valley, but has joked that he has
contributed "confusion and traffic
congestion" to the Peninsula.
Hewlett modestly calls his retire
ment a "non-event."
William Hewlett and David Pack
ard formed a partnership several
years after their graduation from
Stanford in 1934.
"We did anything that would
bring in a nickel. We had a
bowling lane foul line Indicator.
We had a thing that would make a
urinal flush automatically as soon
as a guy came In front of It. We
had a shock machine to make
people lose weight. Here we were
with about *500 and if some guy
came in and thought you could
handle it, you'd do it," Hewlett
recently told the Associated Press.
The first successful H-P product
was an audio-oscillator, a device
Hewlett designed for his master's
thesis at Stanford. Eight were
used by Walt Disney for special
sound design in the making of the
film "Fantasia."
Other successful products in
clude the H-P 35, the world's first
hand-held scientific calculator,
and the world's first "desk-top
mainframe" — a computer small
enough to fit on a desk top, but as
powerful as room-sized computers
of the 19605.
H-P has grown from a two-man,
garage-based enterprise to a
multi-billion-dollar corporation
employing more than 84,000
people worldwide. Ranking 12th
on Fortune magazine's list of the
top U.S. industrial exporters, H-P
was voted the second-most
admired corporation, judged on
eight attributes of reputation
which Included quality of manage
ment, quality of product and in

novativeness. In 1982, Black En
terprise magazine put H-P on Its
list of the 10 best corporations for
which to work.
Last year H-P earned *7.1 bil
lion dollars In net revenue, a far
cry from the initial *538 invest
ment.
Enviable achievements, most
would argue. But Hewlett has
been quoted as saying it is the
company's management style of
which he is most proud.
From the beginning, H-P's man
agement style was based on two
techniques, known as MBO and
MBWA — "management by ob
jective" and "management by wan
dering around."
In MBO, employees are given
clearly stated, overall objectives
and free reign to work toward
those objectives in the way they
feel they can best accomplish their
work.
MBWA is self-explanatory.
According to "The H-P Way," a
company pamphlet given to all
employees, managers must be
aware of what happens in their
areas.
The best way to achieve this is
to walk around among the
employees and talk with them on
an individual basis about what
they're working on. Hewlett and
Packard promoted the open-door
policy and kept away from fancy
furniture and big offices.
"In fact," said H-P spokesman
Vernon Andrews, "our offices have
no doors at all."
Also important to the H-P man
agement style is the human ap
proach. No tight, military-type or
ganizations are found here, nor
are foreboding hierarchies.
William Hewlett and David Pack
ard were known, and still are, as
Bill and Dave to company
employees.
Perhaps the most important
point in the development of H-P's
style was Hewlett's realization that

"people wanted to do a good job."
H-P employees echo the senti
ment that Hewlett and Packard
held a great respect for each em
ployee's capabilities. MBWA works
because "people at all levels want
to belong. . . . They want to be
recognized and to feel that some
one gives a damn," said one H-P
manager.
Alan Bagley, a recently retired
H-P employee and a Stanford
graduate, began working at H-P as
an engineer in 1949. He attributes
much of the company's success to
Hewlett and Packard's ability to
instill great spirit into their
employees.
"Every individual had the op
portunity to show his capability

and was rewarded for what hap
pened," he said. "It was
divisionalized early (along product
lines) to keep the original
entrepreneurial attitude — so it
was a very motivated place."
"People visiting from other com
panies," Bagley said, "noticed the
difference."
It was the entrepreneurial spirit
that made H-P attractive to Bagley
in the first place. "I heard about
their crazy products — like a
lettuce picker," he said, "and I
decided I wanted to work there."
"(William Hewlett) is a gutsy per
son — never shying from a chal
lenge," Bagley said. "He loved a
challenge and took some wild ones
. . . nothing daunted him."

What makes H-P even more dis
tinctive in the business world is
its commitment to no layoffs. In
46 years, the company has never
had to lay off an employee.
Retraining, transfers and con
tinuing education for employees
keep the work force flexible.
Employees sometimes agree to
cuts in pay or voluntary early re
tirement.
Hewlett, 73, has officially
retired, but will retain an
honorary chair on the board. He
has nominated his son Walter, 42,
to serve in his place on the 17-
member board.
Hewlett, said Andrews, will
spend his free time with his family
and pursuing his hobbies, which
include most outdoor sports.

Hewlett-Packard, the two men, both Stanford alumni, have often been called the founders of Silicon Valley
and pioneers of the computer industry.
