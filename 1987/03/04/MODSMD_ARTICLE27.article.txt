## The 						'divine trash' of film maker John Waters 
### MARK TOMPKINS Editorial staff 
It was Toulouse Lautrec who
said words to the effect that, "One
should admire the work of art
alone, and never meet the artist,
for one is bound to be disap
pointed." Such was not the case in
Cubberley Auditorium last Wed
nesday night.
The ASSU Speakers Bureau
brought film maker and writer
John Waters to the stage, and
Waters showed himself to be a
polished speaker, witty, and above
all a real personality. His tie alone
had more character than most
people have in their entire bodies.
"I've had one goal in life, and
that is to make the trashiest
movies I can possibly make. When
I say trash. I certainly don't mean
that negatively." began Waters,
making sure that no one had
confused him with Sydney Pol
lack. His very appearance seemed
in line with the splendid trash
aesthetic of his films, a sort of ele
gant seediness. A natty, waspish
figure, his vaguely debauched
features ever willing to break into
a grin. Waters proceeded to
delight his audience with an ac
count of his 20-year mission to
epater le bourgeois in movie
theaters all across America.
"I love traveling with my films
like this because it's the closest I
can come to the intellectual bur
lesque circuit," he said. Burlesque
shows, he explained, have been a
big influence on his work. Strip
pers are some of his favorite
people.
Also cited as major influences
were sexploitation pioneer Russ
Meyer and Herschell Gordon
Lewis, maker of the first "splatter"
or "gore" horror films, a man who
won Waters' undying admiration
by handing out vomit bags in
theaters.
Meyer and Lewis are unknown

to most movie-goers; they made
films with titles like "Door-to-Door
Maniac" and "Kitten With a
Whip." When it comes to the lurid,
the sleazy, the unspeakable, John
Waters is a connoisseur. He
confessed to going to drive-in
movies almost every night as a
child.
Other important figures for
Waters were the late Andy Warhol
and Liberace. "Liberace was the
personification of everything I
believe in."he said. Of Warhol, he
stated, "I'm certainly going to
miss him being around. He influ
enced. like it or not, most of my
generation very much."
If there is a key to Waters'
peculiar vision, it came when he
said, "I try not to use the word 'art'
except when I'm referring to Mr.
Linkletter. I used to sneak into art
films the way today businessmen
will sneak into a film like. . He
then proceeded to name a rather
preposterously titled X-rated
movie. "The reason why I like In
gmar Bergman films so much is
because he includes a vomit scene
In every one of his movies. I've
tried to include that in every one
of my films in homage to him."
After hearing this, you either got
what Waters was saying or you
didn't; he stands for the demoli
tion of pretensions about art,
taking time-honored values and
standing them upside-down on
their heads. Thus Bergman films
are admired not for their intellec
tual or arty aspects but for their
vomit scenes. John Waters, Dada
dandy.
"If the cliche is true that your
films are your children, then mine
are my juvenile delinquents," he
said, launching into the case his
tories of each of his films. His first
was a 16-millimeter effort titled
"Eat Your Make-Up," in which
Divine (the 300-pound trans
vestite who stars in all of Waters'
films) played Jackie Kennedy. The

film re-enacted the Kennedy as
sassination, but, as Waters ex
plained, "people didn't think it
was very funny because it was a
year after it happened."
"Notoriety is always good for get
ting started in show business." he
said, moving on to "Multiple
Maniacs," made because he
"wanted to make a film that would
offend the 'Love Generation' and
glorify violence ridiculously. I've
made a career out of offending
liberals, basically, because they're
the only ones that come to my
movies and they're the easiest
people to offend."

Next came the most notorious
film of Waters' distinguished
career, "Pink Flamingos," about a
battle between two groups of
people over who could be the fil
thiest person alive. For a climax.
Waters had his star(let) Divine —
how to say this? — eat dog dung,
if you'll pardon the ungainly eu
phemism. "We had *10,000 to
make that movie. You have to do
something to get people's atten
tion. And I knew, that when
people left that movie, even if they
hated it, they'd have to tell some
body about it. It worked beyond
my wildest imaginings."
Not surprisingly, the film has
wound up in lots of trouble, and
went to court in Arizona just last
year. "My films look really bad in a
courtroom," said Waters. (How
many other directors are qualified

to say that?) "The jury can't laugh,
since they're afraid they'll be ar
rested."
"Female Trouble" dealt with a
woman who wants to be famous
so badly she commits murder so
she can get the electric chair,
"which to her is like the Oscar in
her chosen profession," said
Waters. "It's not so far-fetched,
though," he said, telling how he
once interviewed a death-row kil
ler very similar to his character.
He expanded on the subject,
talking about "criminals who are
conscious of the deadline for the
[television news], the whole

reverse thing of glamour and
crime, which, in America today, is
the easiest way to become famous.
If you become a criminal, over
night you'll be in the papers."
Waters' most recent film,
"Polyester," depicted "the worst
possible things that could happen
to a suburban family. Sort of like
'Leave it to Beaver Goes Berserk.'
It was not made to be a 'midnight
movie.' I wanted to spread my can
cer to a wider group of people this
time."
"Polyester" was filmed in
Odorama, a process wherein
viewers were given "scratch 'n'
sniff" cards that they duly
scratched and sniffed at appropri
ate moments during the film,
usually with gagging results. The
best part of making the film, said

Waters, was that he was allowed to
spend >50,000 on the ugliest
furniture he could find for the set.
"It was like going shopping In
reverse."
Waters explained how casting is
very important to his movies.
"Divine is a 300-pound man who
usually plays a homicidal woman
in my films. I met Divine when I
was about 16. My father used to
take me to school, and we'd see
Divine waiting for the bus at the
corner, and he'd have a different
color of hair every day. My father
would go, 'Oh my God,' and I'd
think. Boy, if someone can make
my father nervous waiting for a
bus, imagine what he could do in
a movie!' " He then talked about
how he would like to get Pia
Zadora, Sonny Bono and Amy
Carter to star in his upcoming
film "Hair Spray."
Waters also recounted various
weird incidents he has witnessed,
told of how he goes to murder tri
als "to relax" and said that he also
teaches in prison, rehabilitating
criminals by showing them his
films and helping the inmates
make their own videos.
He expressed a do-it-yourself
ethic, telling how he drove around
with his early films in the trunk of
his car, showing them in
churches if necessary and passing
out fliers on street corners. "I
learned it the hard way, from
doing it all these years. In film
school they don't teach you that
stuff — they think of'business' as
a dirty word."
Having gone over his past
glories, Waters then talked about
his plans for the future. "I think
the 'Golden Age of Trash' is unfor
tunately coming to an end.
There's almost nothing left to use
for exploitation that people
haven't already seen. Even I have
to make films that are funny
rather than shocking. There's
nothing that's left that's shocking

except sacrilege, and I ve already
done that."
Of his work, he said:
"Everything's pushed, too far. And
that's what fascinates me, why
something can be so horrible in
real life, and you put it up on the
movie screen, that distance
changes the whole way everybody
feels about it."
A reception for "The Prince oi
Puke" (as he is affectionately
known in his native Baltimore)
proved to be almost as interesting
as his speech. The man is a mag
net for oddities of all kinds, and
was asked, "just for fun," who he
thought the next celebrity death
would be, a question that took
him slightly aback. Did his par
ents go to see his films? "Why
make them go see a movie they
hate? They don't make me see
'The Sound of Music.' " What did
he think of pornography? "I don't
like watching it. It's like watching
an operation. I like the idea of it."
Waters told how he was invited
to the White House by an official
who shall remain nameless. "I was
invited to the White House by an
administration that would pay to
burn my films. ... It was so
ironic. I got Ronald Reagan cuff
links."
Finally, this writer asked Waters
about good and bad taste. Good
bad taste, he said, has wit and
irony, like Liberace and"The
Other Side of Midnight," while
bad bad taste is just stupid, like
Hustler magazine or "Porky's." His
movies, he said, "have to be for an
audience that knows what they're
getting. My films don't work on
52nd Street. They work as ex
ploitation for art houses."
And, having explained the ul
timate, exquisite irony of his
work, the Prince of Puke made his
exit, presumably setting off to
plumb further the depths of trash,
looking for the high in the low. the
low in the high.

Cubberley Auditorium last Wed
nesday night.
The ASSU Speakers Bureau
brought film maker and writer
John Waters to the stage, and
Waters showed himself to be a
polished speaker, witty, and above
all a real personality. His tie alone
had more character than most
people have in their entire bodies.
"I've had one goal in life, and
that is to make the trashiest
movies I can possibly make. When
I say trash. I certainly don't mean
that negatively." began Waters,
making sure that no one had
confused him with Sydney Pol
lack. His very appearance seemed
in line with the splendid trash
aesthetic of his films, a sort of ele
gant seediness. A natty, waspish
figure, his vaguely debauched
features ever willing to break into
a grin. Waters proceeded to
delight his audience with an ac
count of his 20-year mission to
epater le bourgeois in movie
theaters all across America.
"I love traveling with my films
like this because it's the closest I
can come to the intellectual bur
lesque circuit," he said. Burlesque
shows, he explained, have been a
big influence on his work. Strip
pers are some of his favorite
people.
Also cited as major influences
were sexploitation pioneer Russ
Meyer and Herschell Gordon
Lewis, maker of the first "splatter"
or "gore" horror films, a man who
won Waters' undying admiration
by handing out vomit bags in
theaters.
Meyer and Lewis are unknown

to most movie-goers; they made
films with titles like "Door-to-Door
Maniac" and "Kitten With a
Whip." When it comes to the lurid,
the sleazy, the unspeakable, John
Waters is a connoisseur. He
confessed to going to drive-in
movies almost every night as a
child.
Other important figures for
Waters were the late Andy Warhol
and Liberace. "Liberace was the
personification of everything I
believe in."he said. Of Warhol, he
stated, "I'm certainly going to
miss him being around. He influ
enced. like it or not, most of my
generation very much."
If there is a key to Waters'
peculiar vision, it came when he
said, "I try not to use the word 'art'
except when I'm referring to Mr.
Linkletter. I used to sneak into art
films the way today businessmen
will sneak into a film like. . He
then proceeded to name a rather
preposterously titled X-rated
movie. "The reason why I like In
gmar Bergman films so much is
because he includes a vomit scene
In every one of his movies. I've
tried to include that in every one
of my films in homage to him."
After hearing this, you either got
what Waters was saying or you
didn't; he stands for the demoli
tion of pretensions about art,
taking time-honored values and
standing them upside-down on
their heads. Thus Bergman films
are admired not for their intellec
tual or arty aspects but for their
vomit scenes. John Waters, Dada
dandy.
"If the cliche is true that your
films are your children, then mine
are my juvenile delinquents," he
said, launching into the case his
tories of each of his films. His first
was a 16-millimeter effort titled
"Eat Your Make-Up," in which
Divine (the 300-pound trans
vestite who stars in all of Waters'
films) played Jackie Kennedy. The

film re-enacted the Kennedy as
sassination, but, as Waters ex
plained, "people didn't think it
was very funny because it was a
year after it happened."
"Notoriety is always good for get
ting started in show business." he
said, moving on to "Multiple
Maniacs," made because he
"wanted to make a film that would
offend the 'Love Generation' and
glorify violence ridiculously. I've
made a career out of offending
liberals, basically, because they're
the only ones that come to my
movies and they're the easiest
people to offend."

Next came the most notorious
film of Waters' distinguished
career, "Pink Flamingos," about a
battle between two groups of
people over who could be the fil
thiest person alive. For a climax.
Waters had his star(let) Divine —
how to say this? — eat dog dung,
if you'll pardon the ungainly eu
phemism. "We had *10,000 to
make that movie. You have to do
something to get people's atten
tion. And I knew, that when
people left that movie, even if they
hated it, they'd have to tell some
body about it. It worked beyond
my wildest imaginings."
Not surprisingly, the film has
wound up in lots of trouble, and
went to court in Arizona just last
year. "My films look really bad in a
courtroom," said Waters. (How
many other directors are qualified

to say that?) "The jury can't laugh,
since they're afraid they'll be ar
rested."
"Female Trouble" dealt with a
woman who wants to be famous
so badly she commits murder so
she can get the electric chair,
"which to her is like the Oscar in
her chosen profession," said
Waters. "It's not so far-fetched,
though," he said, telling how he
once interviewed a death-row kil
ler very similar to his character.
He expanded on the subject,
talking about "criminals who are
conscious of the deadline for the
[television news], the whole

reverse thing of glamour and
crime, which, in America today, is
the easiest way to become famous.
If you become a criminal, over
night you'll be in the papers."
Waters' most recent film,
"Polyester," depicted "the worst
possible things that could happen
to a suburban family. Sort of like
'Leave it to Beaver Goes Berserk.'
It was not made to be a 'midnight
movie.' I wanted to spread my can
cer to a wider group of people this
time."
"Polyester" was filmed in
Odorama, a process wherein
viewers were given "scratch 'n'
sniff" cards that they duly
scratched and sniffed at appropri
ate moments during the film,
usually with gagging results. The
best part of making the film, said

Waters, was that he was allowed to
spend >50,000 on the ugliest
furniture he could find for the set.
"It was like going shopping In
reverse."
Waters explained how casting is
very important to his movies.
"Divine is a 300-pound man who
usually plays a homicidal woman
in my films. I met Divine when I
was about 16. My father used to
take me to school, and we'd see
Divine waiting for the bus at the
corner, and he'd have a different
color of hair every day. My father
would go, 'Oh my God,' and I'd
think. Boy, if someone can make
my father nervous waiting for a
bus, imagine what he could do in
a movie!' " He then talked about
how he would like to get Pia
Zadora, Sonny Bono and Amy
Carter to star in his upcoming
film "Hair Spray."
Waters also recounted various
weird incidents he has witnessed,
told of how he goes to murder tri
als "to relax" and said that he also
teaches in prison, rehabilitating
criminals by showing them his
films and helping the inmates
make their own videos.
He expressed a do-it-yourself
ethic, telling how he drove around
with his early films in the trunk of
his car, showing them in
churches if necessary and passing
out fliers on street corners. "I
learned it the hard way, from
doing it all these years. In film
school they don't teach you that
stuff — they think of'business' as
a dirty word."
Having gone over his past
glories, Waters then talked about
his plans for the future. "I think
the 'Golden Age of Trash' is unfor
tunately coming to an end.
There's almost nothing left to use
for exploitation that people
haven't already seen. Even I have
to make films that are funny
rather than shocking. There's
nothing that's left that's shocking

except sacrilege, and I ve already
done that."
Of his work, he said:
"Everything's pushed, too far. And
that's what fascinates me, why
something can be so horrible in
real life, and you put it up on the
movie screen, that distance
changes the whole way everybody
feels about it."
A reception for "The Prince oi
Puke" (as he is affectionately
known in his native Baltimore)
proved to be almost as interesting
as his speech. The man is a mag
net for oddities of all kinds, and
was asked, "just for fun," who he
thought the next celebrity death
would be, a question that took
him slightly aback. Did his par
ents go to see his films? "Why
make them go see a movie they
hate? They don't make me see
'The Sound of Music.' " What did
he think of pornography? "I don't
like watching it. It's like watching
an operation. I like the idea of it."
Waters told how he was invited
to the White House by an official
who shall remain nameless. "I was
invited to the White House by an
administration that would pay to
burn my films. ... It was so
ironic. I got Ronald Reagan cuff
links."
Finally, this writer asked Waters
about good and bad taste. Good
bad taste, he said, has wit and
irony, like Liberace and"The
Other Side of Midnight," while
bad bad taste is just stupid, like
Hustler magazine or "Porky's." His
movies, he said, "have to be for an
audience that knows what they're
getting. My films don't work on
52nd Street. They work as ex
ploitation for art houses."
And, having explained the ul
timate, exquisite irony of his
work, the Prince of Puke made his
exit, presumably setting off to
plumb further the depths of trash,
looking for the high in the low. the
low in the high.

It was Toulouse Lautrec who
said words to the effect that, "One
should admire the work of art
alone, and never meet the artist,
for one is bound to be disap
pointed." Such was not the case in
Cubberley Auditorium last Wed
nesday night.

had more character than most
people have in their entire bodies.
"I've had one goal in life, and
that is to make the trashiest
movies I can possibly make. When
I say trash. I certainly don't mean
that negatively." began Waters,
making sure that no one had
confused him with Sydney Pol
lack. His very appearance seemed
in line with the splendid trash
aesthetic of his films, a sort of ele
gant seediness. A natty, waspish
figure, his vaguely debauched
features ever willing to break into
a grin. Waters proceeded to
delight his audience with an ac
count of his 20-year mission to
epater le bourgeois in movie
theaters all across America.
"I love traveling with my films
like this because it's the closest I
can come to the intellectual bur
lesque circuit," he said. Burlesque
shows, he explained, have been a
big influence on his work. Strip
pers are some of his favorite
people.
Also cited as major influences
were sexploitation pioneer Russ
Meyer and Herschell Gordon
Lewis, maker of the first "splatter"
or "gore" horror films, a man who
won Waters' undying admiration
by handing out vomit bags in
theaters.
Meyer and Lewis are unknown

to most movie-goers; they made
films with titles like "Door-to-Door
Maniac" and "Kitten With a
Whip." When it comes to the lurid,
the sleazy, the unspeakable, John
Waters is a connoisseur. He
confessed to going to drive-in
movies almost every night as a
child.
Other important figures for
Waters were the late Andy Warhol
and Liberace. "Liberace was the
personification of everything I
believe in."he said. Of Warhol, he
stated, "I'm certainly going to
miss him being around. He influ
enced. like it or not, most of my
generation very much."
If there is a key to Waters'
peculiar vision, it came when he
said, "I try not to use the word 'art'
except when I'm referring to Mr.
Linkletter. I used to sneak into art
films the way today businessmen
will sneak into a film like. . He
then proceeded to name a rather
preposterously titled X-rated
movie. "The reason why I like In
gmar Bergman films so much is
because he includes a vomit scene
In every one of his movies. I've
tried to include that in every one
of my films in homage to him."
After hearing this, you either got
what Waters was saying or you
didn't; he stands for the demoli
tion of pretensions about art,
taking time-honored values and
standing them upside-down on
their heads. Thus Bergman films
are admired not for their intellec
tual or arty aspects but for their
vomit scenes. John Waters, Dada
dandy.
"If the cliche is true that your
films are your children, then mine
are my juvenile delinquents," he
said, launching into the case his
tories of each of his films. His first
was a 16-millimeter effort titled
"Eat Your Make-Up," in which
Divine (the 300-pound trans
vestite who stars in all of Waters'
films) played Jackie Kennedy. The

film re-enacted the Kennedy as
sassination, but, as Waters ex
plained, "people didn't think it
was very funny because it was a
year after it happened."
"Notoriety is always good for get
ting started in show business." he
said, moving on to "Multiple
Maniacs," made because he
"wanted to make a film that would
offend the 'Love Generation' and
glorify violence ridiculously. I've
made a career out of offending
liberals, basically, because they're
the only ones that come to my
movies and they're the easiest
people to offend."

Next came the most notorious
film of Waters' distinguished
career, "Pink Flamingos," about a
battle between two groups of
people over who could be the fil
thiest person alive. For a climax.
Waters had his star(let) Divine —
how to say this? — eat dog dung,
if you'll pardon the ungainly eu
phemism. "We had *10,000 to
make that movie. You have to do
something to get people's atten
tion. And I knew, that when
people left that movie, even if they
hated it, they'd have to tell some
body about it. It worked beyond
my wildest imaginings."
Not surprisingly, the film has
wound up in lots of trouble, and
went to court in Arizona just last
year. "My films look really bad in a
courtroom," said Waters. (How
many other directors are qualified

to say that?) "The jury can't laugh,
since they're afraid they'll be ar
rested."
"Female Trouble" dealt with a
woman who wants to be famous
so badly she commits murder so
she can get the electric chair,
"which to her is like the Oscar in
her chosen profession," said
Waters. "It's not so far-fetched,
though," he said, telling how he
once interviewed a death-row kil
ler very similar to his character.
He expanded on the subject,
talking about "criminals who are
conscious of the deadline for the
[television news], the whole

reverse thing of glamour and
crime, which, in America today, is
the easiest way to become famous.
If you become a criminal, over
night you'll be in the papers."
Waters' most recent film,
"Polyester," depicted "the worst
possible things that could happen
to a suburban family. Sort of like
'Leave it to Beaver Goes Berserk.'
It was not made to be a 'midnight
movie.' I wanted to spread my can
cer to a wider group of people this
time."
"Polyester" was filmed in
Odorama, a process wherein
viewers were given "scratch 'n'
sniff" cards that they duly
scratched and sniffed at appropri
ate moments during the film,
usually with gagging results. The
best part of making the film, said

Waters, was that he was allowed to
spend >50,000 on the ugliest
furniture he could find for the set.
"It was like going shopping In
reverse."
Waters explained how casting is
very important to his movies.
"Divine is a 300-pound man who
usually plays a homicidal woman
in my films. I met Divine when I
was about 16. My father used to
take me to school, and we'd see
Divine waiting for the bus at the
corner, and he'd have a different
color of hair every day. My father
would go, 'Oh my God,' and I'd
think. Boy, if someone can make
my father nervous waiting for a
bus, imagine what he could do in
a movie!' " He then talked about
how he would like to get Pia
Zadora, Sonny Bono and Amy
Carter to star in his upcoming
film "Hair Spray."
Waters also recounted various
weird incidents he has witnessed,
told of how he goes to murder tri
als "to relax" and said that he also
teaches in prison, rehabilitating
criminals by showing them his
films and helping the inmates
make their own videos.
He expressed a do-it-yourself
ethic, telling how he drove around
with his early films in the trunk of
his car, showing them in
churches if necessary and passing
out fliers on street corners. "I
learned it the hard way, from
doing it all these years. In film
school they don't teach you that
stuff — they think of'business' as
a dirty word."
Having gone over his past
glories, Waters then talked about
his plans for the future. "I think
the 'Golden Age of Trash' is unfor
tunately coming to an end.
There's almost nothing left to use
for exploitation that people
haven't already seen. Even I have
to make films that are funny
rather than shocking. There's
nothing that's left that's shocking

except sacrilege, and I ve already
done that."
Of his work, he said:
"Everything's pushed, too far. And
that's what fascinates me, why
something can be so horrible in
real life, and you put it up on the
movie screen, that distance
changes the whole way everybody
feels about it."
A reception for "The Prince oi
Puke" (as he is affectionately
known in his native Baltimore)
proved to be almost as interesting
as his speech. The man is a mag
net for oddities of all kinds, and
was asked, "just for fun," who he
thought the next celebrity death
would be, a question that took
him slightly aback. Did his par
ents go to see his films? "Why
make them go see a movie they
hate? They don't make me see
'The Sound of Music.' " What did
he think of pornography? "I don't
like watching it. It's like watching
an operation. I like the idea of it."
Waters told how he was invited
to the White House by an official
who shall remain nameless. "I was
invited to the White House by an
administration that would pay to
burn my films. ... It was so
ironic. I got Ronald Reagan cuff
links."
Finally, this writer asked Waters
about good and bad taste. Good
bad taste, he said, has wit and
irony, like Liberace and"The
Other Side of Midnight," while
bad bad taste is just stupid, like
Hustler magazine or "Porky's." His
movies, he said, "have to be for an
audience that knows what they're
getting. My films don't work on
52nd Street. They work as ex
ploitation for art houses."
And, having explained the ul
timate, exquisite irony of his
work, the Prince of Puke made his
exit, presumably setting off to
plumb further the depths of trash,
looking for the high in the low. the
low in the high.
