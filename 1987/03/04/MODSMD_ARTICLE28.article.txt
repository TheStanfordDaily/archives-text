## Cardinal pitching blanks USF, 7-0 
### JOHN LIS Editorial staff 
There's nothing like a shutout to pick up
a baseball team that has just given up 36
runs in three games. Your pitchers don't
have to ice their necks down after watching
balls fly out of the ballpark, and your coach
can smile in the dugout after the game.
Senior right-hander Rob Wassenaar
pitched five innings of three-hit ball to pick
up his second win of the season, and left
fielder Ruben Amaro raised his average to
.358 as Stanford blanked San Francisco 7-0
yesterday in a non-conference game at
Sunken Diamond.
"I'm very pleased," Cardinal Coach Mark
Marquess said after his team's first outing
after a weekend series at UCLA that saw the
Stanford staff shelled in 17-9 and 14-5
losses Friday and Saturday. "Wassenaar
gave us five real good innings, and we got
some work for Plemel and Chitren."
Wassenaar retired the first seven Dons he
faced before left fielder Arnie Sambel poked
a one-out single to right-center in the third.
Wassenaar's only trouble came in the
fourth, when right fielder Joe Williams and
shortstop Steve Berriatua led off the inning
with a pair of high choppers to Stanford
third baseman Ed Sprague, neither of
which came down in time for Sprague to
make the play.
A sacrifice moved both runners into

scoring position, but Williams broke to the
plate on a sharp hit by designated hitter
Dan Barbara that was nicely fielded by Was
senaar on one hop. and Wassenaar threw to
catcher Doug Robbins for the out.
The Cardinal by that time had already
staked Wassenaar to a 2-0 lead. Center
fielder Toi Cook, given new life when first
baseman Chris Gaggero dropped his pop
foul, hit his second home run of the year
over the left field fence in the first.
Stanford's second run came when Amaro
slapped a one-out single to left, stole
second, moved to third on a bunt by Cook
and scored on a double to center by
Sprague.
The Cardinal chased USF starter and
loser Paul Bartke in the fifth by hitting him
up for two more runs. Shortstop David
Esquer led off with a single to right, took
second on a wild pitch and scored on a
double down the right field line by Amaro.
Cook's fly ball to center moved Amaro to
third, and Sprague greeted reliever Wayne
Richelle with an RBI single to left to give
Stanford a 4-0 lead.
Marquess pulled Wassenaar after he
retired the Dons in order in the fifth, send
ing in junior right-hander Lee Plemel, who
had been rocked for seven runs on 10 hits
in 3 1/3 innings in his last appearance
Friday at UCLA.

fourth inning yesterday. Stanford catcher Doug Robbins made the tag.
