## Cardinal pitching blanks USF, 7-0 
### JOHN LIS Editorial staff 
There's nothing like a shutout to pick up
a baseball team that has just given up 36
runs in three games. Your pitchers don't
have to ice their necks down after watching
balls fly out of the ballpark, and your coach
can smile in the dugout after the game.
Senior right-hander Rob Wassenaar
pitched five innings of three-hit ball to pick
up his second win of the season, and left
fielder Ruben Amaro raised his average to
.358 as Stanford blanked San Francisco 7-0
yesterday in a non-conference game at
Sunken Diamond.
"I'm very pleased," Cardinal Coach Mark
Marquess said after his team's first outing
after a weekend series at UCLA that saw the
Stanford staff shelled in 17-9 and 14-5
losses Friday and Saturday. "Wassenaar
gave us five real good innings, and we got
some work for Plemel and Chitren."
Wassenaar retired the first seven Dons he
faced before left fielder Arnie Sambel poked
a one-out single to right-center in the third.
Wassenaar's only trouble came in the
fourth, when right fielder Joe Williams and
shortstop Steve Berriatua led off the inning
with a pair of high choppers to Stanford
third baseman Ed Sprague, neither of
which came down in time for Sprague to
make the play.
A sacrifice moved both runners into

scoring position, but Williams broke to the
plate on a sharp hit by designated hitter
Dan Barbara that was nicely fielded by Was
senaar on one hop. and Wassenaar threw to
catcher Doug Robbins for the out.
The Cardinal by that time had already
staked Wassenaar to a 2-0 lead. Center
fielder Toi Cook, given new life when first
baseman Chris Gaggero dropped his pop
foul, hit his second home run of the year
over the left field fence in the first.
Stanford's second run came when Amaro
slapped a one-out single to left, stole
second, moved to third on a bunt by Cook
and scored on a double to center by
Sprague.
The Cardinal chased USF starter and
loser Paul Bartke in the fifth by hitting him
up for two more runs. Shortstop David
Esquer led off with a single to right, took
second on a wild pitch and scored on a
double down the right field line by Amaro.
Cook's fly ball to center moved Amaro to
third, and Sprague greeted reliever Wayne
Richelle with an RBI single to left to give
Stanford a 4-0 lead.
Marquess pulled Wassenaar after he
retired the Dons in order in the fifth, send
ing in junior right-hander Lee Plemel, who
had been rocked for seven runs on 10 hits
in 3 1/3 innings in his last appearance
Friday at UCLA.

USF right fielder Joe Williams unsuccessfully retreats to third after having tried to score on an infield grounder in the
fourth inning yesterday. Stanford catcher Doug Robbins made the tag.
"We probably won't use him (Wassenaar)
Friday," Marquess said, "but by Saturday
and Sunday he'll be ready to go. Plemel and
(Steve) Chitren were going to throw
anyway. The extra work helps, especially
when they haven't been throwing real well."
Plemel came on to throw three innings of
no-hit ball, and Chitren finished up the
ninth, giving up a single to Berriatua and a
double to pinch hitter Ron Herbert, but al
lowing no runs.
Marquess' rotation for the Pacific 10
Southern Division season is currently
Plemel. Chitren and Jack McDowell, but
Wassenaar was the No. 3 man two years ago
on the Cardinal staff that won the Six-Pac
pennant.
"He could (start)," Marquess said of Was
senaar. "He's very capable, experienced,
and he knows how to pitch. He certainly
didn't hurt his chances out there today."
Stanford's final three runs came courtesy
of the bottom of the lineup and some un
conventionally daring baserunning. No. 8
hitter Frank Carey drew a two-out walk
from Richellc in the sixth, went to second
on a single by Esquer. then stole third,
which proved necessary when Amaro beat

out an infield hit to bring him home.
Esquer then scored on a delayed double
steal after Amaro drew the throw from USF
catcher Eric Enos and Berriatua's throw to
the plate went all the way to the backstop.
"If they think they can take It. then we'll
do that," Marquess said of having Carey
steal third with two outs. "Obviously, with
two outs, you've got to be kind of sure about
It."
Carey singled to center to start off the
eighth, went to third on a single to right by
Esquer and scored on a sacrifice fly by
Amaro.
The offensive output from Carey and
Esquer was especially encouraged in light
of the news that freshman shortstop Troy
Paulsen. Stanford's leading hitter in the
early going, may need surgery to repair car
tilage damage to his knee. Paulsen may be
lost for the season. Marquess said Paulsen
was undergoing tests, and a final decision
should be made within a week.
While one doesn't normally depend on of
fensive production from the bottom of the
order, the top of Stanford's lineup has been
more than dependable. Leadoff hitter
Amaro was 3-for-4 with three RBIs and two
runs scored. Cook's homer proved the
game-winning RBI, and Sprague was 2-for
-5 with two RBIs, giving him a team-leading
23 RBIs on the year.

steal after Amaro drew the throw from USF
catcher Eric Enos and Berriatua's throw to
the plate went all the way to the backstop.
"If they think they can take It. then we'll
do that," Marquess said of having Carey
steal third with two outs. "Obviously, with
two outs, you've got to be kind of sure about
It."
Carey singled to center to start off the
eighth, went to third on a single to right by
Esquer and scored on a sacrifice fly by
Amaro.
The offensive output from Carey and
Esquer was especially encouraged in light
of the news that freshman shortstop Troy
Paulsen. Stanford's leading hitter in the
early going, may need surgery to repair car
tilage damage to his knee. Paulsen may be
lost for the season. Marquess said Paulsen
was undergoing tests, and a final decision
should be made within a week.
While one doesn't normally depend on of
fensive production from the bottom of the
order, the top of Stanford's lineup has been
more than dependable. Leadoff hitter
Amaro was 3-for-4 with three RBIs and two
runs scored. Cook's homer proved the
game-winning RBI, and Sprague was 2-for
-5 with two RBIs, giving him a team-leading
23 RBIs on the year.
There's nothing like a shutout to pick up
a baseball team that has just given up 36
runs in three games. Your pitchers don't
have to ice their necks down after watching
balls fly out of the ballpark, and your coach
can smile in the dugout after the game.
Senior right-hander Rob Wassenaar
pitched five innings of three-hit ball to pick
up his second win of the season, and left
fielder Ruben Amaro raised his average to
.358 as Stanford blanked San Francisco 7-0
yesterday in a non-conference game at
Sunken Diamond.
"I'm very pleased," Cardinal Coach Mark
Marquess said after his team's first outing
after a weekend series at UCLA that saw the
Stanford staff shelled in 17-9 and 14-5
losses Friday and Saturday. "Wassenaar
gave us five real good innings, and we got
some work for Plemel and Chitren."
Wassenaar retired the first seven Dons he
faced before left fielder Arnie Sambel poked
a one-out single to right-center in the third.
Wassenaar's only trouble came in the
fourth, when right fielder Joe Williams and
shortstop Steve Berriatua led off the inning
with a pair of high choppers to Stanford
third baseman Ed Sprague, neither of
which came down in time for Sprague to
make the play.
A sacrifice moved both runners into

scoring position, but Williams broke to the
plate on a sharp hit by designated hitter
Dan Barbara that was nicely fielded by Was
senaar on one hop. and Wassenaar threw to
catcher Doug Robbins for the out.
The Cardinal by that time had already
staked Wassenaar to a 2-0 lead. Center
fielder Toi Cook, given new life when first
baseman Chris Gaggero dropped his pop
foul, hit his second home run of the year
over the left field fence in the first.
Stanford's second run came when Amaro
slapped a one-out single to left, stole
second, moved to third on a bunt by Cook
and scored on a double to center by
Sprague.
The Cardinal chased USF starter and
loser Paul Bartke in the fifth by hitting him
up for two more runs. Shortstop David
Esquer led off with a single to right, took
second on a wild pitch and scored on a
double down the right field line by Amaro.
Cook's fly ball to center moved Amaro to
third, and Sprague greeted reliever Wayne
Richelle with an RBI single to left to give
Stanford a 4-0 lead.
Marquess pulled Wassenaar after he
retired the Dons in order in the fifth, send
ing in junior right-hander Lee Plemel, who
had been rocked for seven runs on 10 hits
in 3 1/3 innings in his last appearance
Friday at UCLA.

USF right fielder Joe Williams unsuccessfully retreats to third after having tried to score on an infield grounder in the
fourth inning yesterday. Stanford catcher Doug Robbins made the tag.
"We probably won't use him (Wassenaar)
Friday," Marquess said, "but by Saturday
and Sunday he'll be ready to go. Plemel and
(Steve) Chitren were going to throw
anyway. The extra work helps, especially
when they haven't been throwing real well."
Plemel came on to throw three innings of
no-hit ball, and Chitren finished up the
ninth, giving up a single to Berriatua and a
double to pinch hitter Ron Herbert, but al
lowing no runs.
Marquess' rotation for the Pacific 10
Southern Division season is currently
Plemel. Chitren and Jack McDowell, but
Wassenaar was the No. 3 man two years ago
on the Cardinal staff that won the Six-Pac
pennant.
"He could (start)," Marquess said of Was
senaar. "He's very capable, experienced,
and he knows how to pitch. He certainly
didn't hurt his chances out there today."
Stanford's final three runs came courtesy
of the bottom of the lineup and some un
conventionally daring baserunning. No. 8
hitter Frank Carey drew a two-out walk
from Richellc in the sixth, went to second
on a single by Esquer. then stole third,
which proved necessary when Amaro beat

out an infield hit to bring him home.
Esquer then scored on a delayed double
steal after Amaro drew the throw from USF
catcher Eric Enos and Berriatua's throw to
the plate went all the way to the backstop.
"If they think they can take It. then we'll
do that," Marquess said of having Carey
steal third with two outs. "Obviously, with
two outs, you've got to be kind of sure about
It."
Carey singled to center to start off the
eighth, went to third on a single to right by
Esquer and scored on a sacrifice fly by
Amaro.
The offensive output from Carey and
Esquer was especially encouraged in light
of the news that freshman shortstop Troy
Paulsen. Stanford's leading hitter in the
early going, may need surgery to repair car
tilage damage to his knee. Paulsen may be
lost for the season. Marquess said Paulsen
was undergoing tests, and a final decision
should be made within a week.
