# Cal netters gunning for Card women

### KEN STEVENS Editorial staff 
Never mind that the Stanford women's ten
nis team has won three of the last five NCAA
championships, while California has never
taken the national title.
Never mind that Cal has never beaten Stan
ford in a dual match.
When the two teams meet today at 1:30 p.m.
at the Stanford Tennis Stadium, the visiting
Golden Bears will not be Intimidated. "Our
team already knows that we are one of the best
teams in the country," Cal Coach Jan Brogan
said. "We don't look at Stanford as being any
better than us. That changed about three years
ago."
Three years ago, Stanford would routinely
roll past the Bears, but in the past two seasons
the Cardinal has been severely tested by its
rival from across the Bay. In 1985 at Cal, Stan
ford had to pull out a three-set doubles match
to win 5-4.
Last season, the Cardinal won by seemingly
comfortable 5-2 and 7-2 margins, but on both
occasions the Bears could well have split the
singles and headed into the doubles at 3-3 in
stead of trailing 4-2.
"It's kind of scary," Stanford Coach Frank
Brennan said of playing Cal. "Ever since I've
been here, we've played them twice every year
and beaten them. But they're getting closer.
The odds are against you after awhile."
