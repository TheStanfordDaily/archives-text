# Cal netters gunning for Card women
## 
### KEN STEVENS Editorial staff 
Never mind that the Stanford women's ten
nis team has won three of the last five NCAA
championships, while California has never
taken the national title.
Never mind that Cal has never beaten Stan
ford in a dual match.
When the two teams meet today at 1:30 p.m.
at the Stanford Tennis Stadium, the visiting
Golden Bears will not be Intimidated. "Our
team already knows that we are one of the best
teams in the country," Cal Coach Jan Brogan
said. "We don't look at Stanford as being any
better than us. That changed about three years
ago."
Three years ago, Stanford would routinely
roll past the Bears, but in the past two seasons
the Cardinal has been severely tested by its
rival from across the Bay. In 1985 at Cal, Stan
ford had to pull out a three-set doubles match
to win 5-4.
Last season, the Cardinal won by seemingly
comfortable 5-2 and 7-2 margins, but on both
occasions the Bears could well have split the
singles and headed into the doubles at 3-3 in
stead of trailing 4-2.
"It's kind of scary," Stanford Coach Frank
Brennan said of playing Cal. "Ever since I've
been here, we've played them twice every year
and beaten them. But they're getting closer.
The odds are against you after awhile."
The odds of beating Cal so far this season have
been zero. The Bears, ranked No. 5 in the preseason
poll, are 8-0, with impressive wins at Arizona (6-3)
and Arizona State (7-2). and an eye-opening 8-1
home win Sunday against No. 8 San Diego State.
Cal is led by Karen Shin, a Junior Federation Cup
member who is 18-7 overall this season. The Bears
are particularly strong in the second, third and
fourth positions, where Linda Oechsle, Alissa Finer
man and Sharon Fletcher return from the 1986
squad. "They're just real solid," Brennan said. "They
have a lot of depth."
One of the reasons for the Bears' perfect record has
been improved doubles play. Last season, Cal's lack
luster doubles performance was its Achilles' heel in
both matches against Stanford. Today could be a dif
ferent story, however.
"I think we're stronger in doubles play than we
have been in my nine years here," Brogan said.
Also in Cal's favor today is the fact that the Card
inal, despite its No. 1 national ranking, is not as
strong as in the past. Senior Leigh Anne Eldredge
and sophomore Eleni Rossides are out with stress
fracture injuries, and the team has already dropped a
match this season, losing 5-4 at Arizona.
"We played well against both Arizonas, and I guess
Stanford had a problem with Arizona," Brogan said.
Still, Stanford is 7-1 and, except for the narrow

loss to the Wildcats, has shown no sign of willingly
surrendering its national championship. Senior
Patty Fendick has been so dominant this year (17-0
overall, and 13 straight matches without losing a set)
that she is the closest thing to a sure bet to win all of
her singles matches.
In addition. Fendick will be matched today against
Shin, whom she demolished 6-0, 6-0 last May en
route to winning the NCAA singles championhip.
Also boding well for the Cardinal is the recent play
of senior Stephanie Savldes at No. 2 singles. Savides
played probably her best match of the season last
Friday in defeating SDSU's Anne Moeller 6-2. 6-3.
Cal has also been hindered by an injury to a key
performer. Jennifer Prah. who played No. 3 last
season for the Bears, had knee surgery and will not
return until later this season.
Nevertheless, the Bears are primed for an upset.
"We're really, really prepared." Brogan said. "We're
more prepared than we ever have been at this time in
the season. We match up pretty evenly, considering
Leigh Anne is still out for them, and Jennifer Prah is
still out for us."
Brogan added that Cal does not consider Stanford
to be the best team in collegiate tennis this year.
"From what I'm hearing, there are teams that sound
like they are tougher."
She did say, however, that "Stanford is playing
well," and that to beat the Cardinal "would be a his
torical event."
All that remains to be seen is whether today's con
frontation marks a historical event, or whether his
tory merely repeats itself.
