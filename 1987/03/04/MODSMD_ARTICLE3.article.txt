# Med Center faces heart shortage
## 
### NANNETTE THOMPSON Staff writer 
A sudden decline in heart donations to the
Stanford Medical Center has lengthened the
waiting list of potential transplant patients
from eight to 15 over the last few months, ac
cording to Marguerite Brown, donor coordina
tor for Stanford's transplant program.
Usually the medical center receives four to
five hearts a month, but in February only two
hearts were donated.
Only six heart transplants have been per
formed so far this year, putting the medical
center far behind last year's total of 71
transplant operations. Four potential
transplant patients have died since the begin
ning of the year, equalling the death total for
all of 1986.
Until 1980, Stanford was the only medical
center in the West to perform heart

transplants. Now, however, Stanford is only
one of six centers to which Barbara Schulman,
director of the Regional Organ Procurement
Agency, sends donations. The others include
hospitals in Southern California and Arizona.
However, the shortage of hearts at Stanford
should not be attributed to competition be
tween hospitals, according to Schulman. Be
cause a heart can only function outside the
body for four hours, transplants must be done
very quickly. The time limit often requires that
hospitals "serve local needs first," Schulman
said.
Brown said the shortage of heart donors is
an ongoing problem. "We've never had enough
hearts for the number (of people) on the list,"
she said.
Part of the reason for the current backup of
potential heart recipients at Stanford is that
with the increasing success of transplant
operations, more heart patients are being

referred to the medical center. "Transplants
are now a viable alternative to people who have
exhausted other therapies," Brown said.
Also, since more insurance companies offer
coverage for the operation, and because the
age criteria for donors has been raised to 50 or
60, more people hope to be organ recipients,
said Brown.
In part, she said, the decrease in heart
donors is due to the time of year. Organ dona
tions go up in the summer months, when
travel accidents are more common.
Brown also said that most of the patients are
aware that the odds of finding a heart donor
are not in their favor. Not only does a donor
have to contribute, but the blood type must be
matched and the size must be correct.
Schulman explained that before a donor
heart can be accepted, the surgeon must take
blood samples from both hearts and cross
match them to test for adverse reactions.
