# Netters ease by Hayward

### JON WEISMAN Staff writer 
Despite the cloudy weather, yes
terday was a beautiful day for the
Stanford men's tennis team.
The Cardinal ended a four
match losing streak with a solid 8-
1 win over Hayward State at Stan
ford Tennis Stadium. Stanford
upped its record to 4-5, while the
Pioneers fell to 3-2.
"The win's important," Stanford
Coach Dick Gould said. "I was
pleased the way we got it. Hayward
State actually has a very good
team â€” they're one of the top five
teams in Division 11, and if you
don't show up ready to play, it can
be a real good match."
The match saw Stanford sweep
all three doubles matches for the
first time this season. Scott
Moody and Mark Jacobson capped
the day with a 4-6, 6-2, 6-3 win
over Hayward's Kim Sohl and
Manoj Kashyap.
Prior to that match, the teams
of Jon Kahn and Curtis Dunn and
Jeff Cathrall and Eric Peus each
posted two-set victories. The Jon-
Dunn match was one worthy of
the poet of that name as they beat
Tom Edwards and Tom Bogar, 6-
3, 6-4.
Peus and Cathrall dominated
the first set of their match against
Mauricio Achondo and Bill Peters,
high-fiving after every point like
the "Wonder Twins" activating
their powers.
In the second set, the Stanford

Barry Richards was the only Stanford player to lose yesterday, dropping a 4-6, 6-2, 7-5
decision to Hayward State's Tom Bogar. Richards had a 5-4 lead in the third set before
falling behind 6-5, then fought off two match points to tie the l'2th game at 3-3 before
succumbing. Stanford raised its record to 4-5 with an 8-1 victory over Hayward. The
Cardinal's next match is Friday at home against San Jose State, after which Stanford
will take two weeks off for Dead Week and finals.
freshmen were closing in on a 6-1
win when, on an overhead which
they both called to hit, Cathrall
grabbed Peus' racket to take the
shot himself but hit the ball into
the net.
As Cathrall and Peus prevailed
6-1, 6-4, the incident proved to
mean little more than some post
game ribbing between the pair,
which is continuing to develop
into a strong combination.
"Every time we go out we play
better and better," Peus said. "Our
games sort of go together on the
doubles court well."
"We both try to do the same
things," Cathrall said. "We both
like to play really aggressively and
move all the time. I can move
pretty much at will when he gets
his first serve in."
From the last half of his singles
match through most of his
doubles match, Cathrall was on a
streak where he won 23 of 27
games. Cathrall, who hadn't

played singles in a week, has been
working on a serve-and-volley
game but relied on his old standby
baseline game to come back to
beat Kashyap. 3-6, 6-2, 6-1.
"I got a rhythm in the singles,"
Cathrall said. "When I serve and
volley, I have a tough time when
the person hits it really easy, for
some reason. I tend to hit it out in
front, take a swing Instead of just
blocking it. When it comes hard, I
don't have so much time to think.
"1 played baseline for years, so I
love playing baseline." he added.
"But 1 need to go forward. I've got
ten a lot better at it. Once I got a
little rhythm, I came in more. I
think, overall, it's really good for
my game."
Some might have missed the
end of Cathrall's match as Dunn's
6-4, 6-2 win over Ed Clark ended
at precisely the same moment.
The two victories gave Stanford a
4-0 lead.
"I've got to keep giving credit to
Curtis Dunn," Gould said. "He
keeps on winning."
Jeff Tarango and Achondo met
for the first time since Tarango's
thrilling 6-3, 4-6, 7-5 win in the
NorCal Intercollegiate quarter

finals last month. This time,
Tarango disposed of Achondo 6-4,
6-1.
Mark Jacobson beat Tom Ed
wards at No. 4 singles. 6-3, 6-4.
Scott Moody clinched the team
victory for Stanford with a 6-2, 3-
6, 6-3 defeat of Sohl. Moody had a
grunting Sohl moving all over the
court on the last two points.
"I thought Scott Moody did a
real good job," Gould said. "The
guy played a couple of real loose
games on him; Scott was able to
capitalize on that.
"Oftentimes in Scott's matches,
it's just the opposite," Gould
noted. "He has played pretty well,
but he has had one or two loose
games, and the other opponents
capitalize on that. Today, it was
about the reverse, which was good
to see."
Barry Richards came very close
to making it a perfect day for the
Cardinal. After leading 5-4 in the
third set over Bogar, Richards fell
behind 6-5 and was facing triple
match point. Richards fought off
two match points, including two
overhead smashes on the second
one, before succumbing, 4-6, 6-2,
7-5.
