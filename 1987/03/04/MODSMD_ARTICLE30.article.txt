The Cardinal ended a four

upped its record to 4-5, while the
Pioneers fell to 3-2.

pleased the way we got it. Hayward
State actually has a very good
team â€” they're one of the top five
teams in Division 11, and if you
don't show up ready to play, it can

The match saw Stanford sweep
all three doubles matches for the
first time this season. Scott
Moody and Mark Jacobson capped
the day with a 4-6, 6-2, 6-3 win
over Hayward's Kim Sohl and
Manoj Kashyap.

Dunn match was one worthy of

Tom Edwards and Tom Bogar, 6-
3, 6-4.

succumbing. Stanford raised its record to 4-5 with an 8-1 victory over Hayward. The
Cardinal's next match is Friday at home against San Jose State, after which Stanford
will take two weeks off for Dead Week and finals.
