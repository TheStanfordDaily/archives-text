# New line makes it exciting for ASU
## 
### 
It's hard to put into words
how happy I was about Stan
ford's 97-92 overtime win
over Arizona State. It wasn't
the fact that the Cardinal
had its first .500 conference
record In 14 years that had
me feeling so good; it was
the fact that the three-point

line, one of my favorite in
novations in college basket
ball, had been so thoroughly
vindicated.
Arizona State's Steve Beck
was unconscious from
three-point range, hitting
nine of 11 from behind the
line painted 19 feet, 9 inches
from the basket. He finished
with 33 points. Without the
line, he only has 24 points.
