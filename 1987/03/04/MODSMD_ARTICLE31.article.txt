# New line makes it exciting for ASU
## 
### 
It's hard to put into words
how happy I was about Stan
ford's 97-92 overtime win
over Arizona State. It wasn't
the fact that the Cardinal
had its first .500 conference
record In 14 years that had
me feeling so good; it was
the fact that the three-point

line, one of my favorite in
novations in college basket
ball, had been so thoroughly
vindicated.
Arizona State's Steve Beck
was unconscious from
three-point range, hitting
nine of 11 from behind the
line painted 19 feet, 9 inches
from the basket. He finished
with 33 points. Without the
line, he only has 24 points.

The strongest argument for the line Is
that it gives teams that are trailing a chance
to catch up. It worked perfectly for ASU.
Stanford led 83-79 with 35 seconds to play
in regulation. Under the old rules. Arizona
State has to score, then either come up with
a steal or hope a Stanford player chokes at
the line, so ASU can get the ball back to try
to tie.
But not anymore. Giving a team a chance
to ice a game by hitting a couple free throws
was unfair, allowing an advantage to teams
that led late in the game. So now, here's
what you do to overcome a four-point defi
cit. First, have Beck hit a three-pointer to
make it 83-82 (83-81, Old Style). Then, foul
Terry Taylor, Stanford's best foul shooter,
and let him make both shots to make It 85-
82 (85-81, 0.5.). Finally, have Beck hit one
more three-pointer to tie the game 85-85
(85-83, 0.5.).
Instead of a foregone conclusion, you've
got overtime. There's nothing Stanford can
do about it, because Taylor can only make
two free throws, and Beck can make a
three-pointer to overcome that. Sure it's not
fair, but television advertisers will take ex
citing over fair anytime.

Another thing I like about the three-point
rule is the added role the officials play in a
game. Right before halftime. Beck hit a shot
from two feet inside the line. But the offi
cials gave him three. Granted, basketball
isn't quite as good as gymnastics, where the
officials have total responsibility over the
score, but this is a step in the right direc
tion.
I look forward to the day when after every
basket in an Olympic game, players will
wait for the judges to decide how many
points to award. "Well. AJ, the American
judge gave Beck three points, but the Soviet
has only awarded him a 2.35."
To further allow losing teams a chance to
catch up, I propose two more changes.
First, draw a four-point line at about 30
feet. This would also raise Reggie Miller's
scoring average against Stanford over 40
points per game. Second, if a team hits a
shot from midcourt or beyond in the last
five seconds, the game would automatically
go into overtime and the player would win a
Macintosh.
By instituting the three-point line, the
NCAA has ensured itself more exciting,
close games that will go down to the buzzer,
and it gives its officials more input into the
game. The only cost has been fairness. It's
about time that romantic ideals that result
in boring games went by the wayside.
