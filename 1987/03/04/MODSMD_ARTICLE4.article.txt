Education is the only way to stop the
drug problem in athletic circles and in the
United States, according to panelists who
took part in a discussion of NCAA drug test
ing policies in Serra lounge last night.
"Catching someone (via a test) does not
solve the problem. A drug test perse will not
deter people from using drugs. We need
education and then counseling instead."
said Brian Morris, a fullback on Stanford's
football team.
Current NCAA (National Collegiate Athle
tic Association) policy says that prior to the
start of the season, an athlete must sign a
form stating that he will consent to a drug
test. Such drug tests are only administered
at the NCAA championships of each sport.
Slmone LeVant, captain of the Stanford
women's diving team, has filed a lawsuit
that charges these tests are an invasion of
privacy. Her hearing is set for March 11.
Morris was joined in the panel discussion
by George Haines, head coach of the Stan
ford women's swimming team; Kenneth
Melmon. professor of clinical pharmacology
at Stanford Medical School; and Lee

Thompson, associate staff counsel at the
Office of the Vice President and General
Counsel.
"We have to educate our athletes about
the dangers of drug use. We only live once
and have only one body. One does not poke
his eye and say it's OK because he has an
other one. And drug testing is the place to
start," Haines said.
Melmon, however, said that "the NCAA
policy does not seem to show any clearly
defined steps toward education. [NCAA offi
cials] seem only to be interested in the edu
cation of the detection of drugs."
"Also, if you are willing to have drug tests,
you have to be prepared to help the person
whose drug tests prove positive. I don't
think the NCAA has taken any steps toward
education or rehabilitation," he said.
Thompson addressed the legal aspects of
the drug testing policy.
"According to the NCAA, playing college
sports is a privilege and not a right, so the
athletes have to follow the rules of the
NCAA. In this way. drug testing cannot be a
constitutionally protected right,"
Thompson said.
