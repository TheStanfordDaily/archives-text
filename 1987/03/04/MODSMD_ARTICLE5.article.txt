# Concert Network shake-up begins
## Officials resign; salaries cut 
### BAIE NETZER Senior staff writer 
A Concert Network shake-up
began last week when students
lobbying for ASSU support of an
upcoming special fee request pres
sured certain members of this
year's staff to resign.
Concert Network Business
Manager Tim Self resigned last
week after the shake-up began,
and Director Patrick O'Hara is ex
pected to resign after the Grateful
Dead's spring concert, according
to ASSU Senator Galia Tylman.
"The staff is basically inept,"
ASSU Senator Jeff Sloan said.
"We've been paying huge amounts
of money for no concerts."
In response to the Concert Net
work's dwindling reserves and its
frustrated attempts to stage rock
concerts on campus, the ASSU
Appropriations Committee
refused to recommend a Concert
Network request for special fees.
Students involved in formulating
the budget request, which is
scheduled to appear on the ASSU
spring election ballot, then ham

mered out a new proposal and in
stigated changes in the organiza
tion in order to win senate sup
port for the proposed budget.
"They said there was a lot of
mismanagement and they put a
lot of pressure on the director and
the business manager to resign,"
Tylman said.
O'Hara will stay on as director of
the Concert Network until after
the Grateful Dead concert planned
for spring quarter because "they
need somebody in there to run
things until then," Tylman said.
A month ago, the Concert Net
work's original budget request for
$36,500 was "nixed immediately,
and we put a lot of restrictions on
it," Tylman said.
"The original thought was 'Let's
cripple the network,' so we
planned to separate student
salaries from the funds for the
network," she said. "That way
you'd have the money for the net
work but we wouldn't have anyone
to run it."
"Our main objection was the
faculty adviser to the Concert Net
work, who does nothing." Tylman
said. The salary of the Concert
Network faculty adviser is
• 13.000.
Because the Concert Network
suffered a year of disastrous losses
during the 19705, the University
insisted on staff supervision for
the Concert Network when the or
ganization requested its special
fee in 1984, according to Tylman.
But despite a faculty adviser,
Tylman says Concert Network
reserves have "been going down,
down, down" with little in the way
of successfully staged perfor
mances to show in return.
According to Linda Christie,
business manager of the network
last year, the adviser is "a profes

sional with four years of experi
ence at Texas A&M," where large
concerts are common.
Christie also noted that Concert
Network salaries are "on par with
other ASSU project manager
salaries." [See letter, page 4.)
After the assurance of a change
in staff and reduced salaries for
those In the Concert Network, the
senate unanimously approved the
first part of the Concert Network's
revised budget request at its
meeting last night. This part
budgets >33,333 for student
salaries and operating costs.
According to Tylman, the senate
approved the allocation of
*25,000 in special fees but speci
fied that the money should be
used solely for staging rock con
certs on campus during the aca
demic year.
"We want real concerts with
people you've heard of," Tylman
said. The budget allocates $5,000

for five rock concerts, which, ac
cording to Tylman, "should give
them incentive to go out and bar
gain for artists."
"We're giving them a subsidy
and expecting them to lose at least
• 5,000 on each rock concert,"
Sloan said. "Now they will be able
to compete with big-time people
like Bill Graham, and students are
guaranteed five rock shows next
year."
The proposed special fee request
also reduces the salary of the di
rector and business manager from
• 3,000 to *1,200 with a
percentage of concert profits.
The second part of the budget,
which allocates • 13,280 for the
faculty adviser's salary and
worker's compensation, failed to
gain senate approval at last
night's meeting. But according to
Tylman, students responsible for
creating the budget intentionally
left funds for a faculty adviser as a

separate budget item to be voted
on by students in the spring elec
tion.
"We don't think the faculty advi
ser's salary should be tagged on to
special fees paid by the students
and we believe this part will prob
ably fail." Tylman said.
Students voted overwhelmingly
in favor of a *49,000 special fee re
quest for the Concert Network in
1984, according to Tylman. At the
time, Concert Network supporters
claimed the fee request was a one
time only request and that the or
ganization would not be seeking
more funds in the future.
Last year, the Concert Network
planned to request another spe
cial fee but withdrew its request
just before the election. The ASSU
did not have time to reprint bal
lots and students again showed
overwhelming support for the
Concert Network.

week after the shake-up began,
and Director Patrick O'Hara is ex
pected to resign after the Grateful
Dead's spring concert, according
to ASSU Senator Galia Tylman.
"The staff is basically inept,"
ASSU Senator Jeff Sloan said.
"We've been paying huge amounts
of money for no concerts."
In response to the Concert Net
work's dwindling reserves and its
frustrated attempts to stage rock
concerts on campus, the ASSU
Appropriations Committee
refused to recommend a Concert
Network request for special fees.
Students involved in formulating
the budget request, which is
scheduled to appear on the ASSU
spring election ballot, then ham

mered out a new proposal and in
stigated changes in the organiza
tion in order to win senate sup
port for the proposed budget.
"They said there was a lot of
mismanagement and they put a
lot of pressure on the director and
the business manager to resign,"
Tylman said.
O'Hara will stay on as director of
the Concert Network until after
the Grateful Dead concert planned
for spring quarter because "they
need somebody in there to run
things until then," Tylman said.
A month ago, the Concert Net
work's original budget request for
$36,500 was "nixed immediately,
and we put a lot of restrictions on
it," Tylman said.
"The original thought was 'Let's
cripple the network,' so we
planned to separate student
salaries from the funds for the
network," she said. "That way
you'd have the money for the net
work but we wouldn't have anyone
to run it."
"Our main objection was the
faculty adviser to the Concert Net
work, who does nothing." Tylman
said. The salary of the Concert
Network faculty adviser is
• 13.000.
Because the Concert Network
suffered a year of disastrous losses
during the 19705, the University
insisted on staff supervision for
the Concert Network when the or
ganization requested its special
fee in 1984, according to Tylman.
But despite a faculty adviser,
Tylman says Concert Network
reserves have "been going down,
down, down" with little in the way
of successfully staged perfor
mances to show in return.
According to Linda Christie,
business manager of the network
last year, the adviser is "a profes

sional with four years of experi
ence at Texas A&M," where large
concerts are common.
Christie also noted that Concert
Network salaries are "on par with
other ASSU project manager
salaries." [See letter, page 4.)
After the assurance of a change
in staff and reduced salaries for
those In the Concert Network, the
senate unanimously approved the
first part of the Concert Network's
revised budget request at its
meeting last night. This part
budgets >33,333 for student
salaries and operating costs.
According to Tylman, the senate
approved the allocation of
*25,000 in special fees but speci
fied that the money should be
used solely for staging rock con
certs on campus during the aca
demic year.
"We want real concerts with
people you've heard of," Tylman
said. The budget allocates $5,000

for five rock concerts, which, ac
cording to Tylman, "should give
them incentive to go out and bar
gain for artists."
"We're giving them a subsidy
and expecting them to lose at least
• 5,000 on each rock concert,"
Sloan said. "Now they will be able
to compete with big-time people
like Bill Graham, and students are
guaranteed five rock shows next
year."
The proposed special fee request
also reduces the salary of the di
rector and business manager from
• 3,000 to *1,200 with a
percentage of concert profits.
The second part of the budget,
which allocates • 13,280 for the
faculty adviser's salary and
worker's compensation, failed to
gain senate approval at last
night's meeting. But according to
Tylman, students responsible for
creating the budget intentionally
left funds for a faculty adviser as a

separate budget item to be voted
on by students in the spring elec
tion.
"We don't think the faculty advi
ser's salary should be tagged on to
special fees paid by the students
and we believe this part will prob
ably fail." Tylman said.
Students voted overwhelmingly
in favor of a *49,000 special fee re
quest for the Concert Network in
1984, according to Tylman. At the
time, Concert Network supporters
claimed the fee request was a one
time only request and that the or
ganization would not be seeking
more funds in the future.
Last year, the Concert Network
planned to request another spe
cial fee but withdrew its request
just before the election. The ASSU
did not have time to reprint bal
lots and students again showed
overwhelming support for the
Concert Network.
