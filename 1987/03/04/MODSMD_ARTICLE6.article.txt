# Campbell refuses to disclose site
## 
### JOHN POLLACK Senior staff writer 
Hoover Institution Director W.
Glenn Campbell will not reveal po
tential sites for the Ronald Reagan
Public Affairs Center until land for
the center has been purchased,
desptte a trrtttrn request to do so
by acting University President
James Rosse.
Campbell, who is also president
of the Ronald Reagan Library
Foundation, said Monday in an
interview with the San Jose Mer
cury News that "there's no way" he
will disclose potential sites for the
center before land is actually pur
chased. He said such action could
cause the site's price to go up.
"The quickest way of putting
the price of land up would be for
the Ronald Reagan Presidential
Foundation to announce the No. 1
choice." Campbell told the Mer
cury News. He added, however,
that he hoped the center would be
located somewhere in the area.
Originally, the Reagan Library
and the affiliated Public Affairs
Center were to be built on the
same on-campus site. But the
University's early insistence on

controlling the center's program
ming was unacceptable to the
Reagan Foundation, and the foun
dation decided to build the center
off campus to avoid University
control.
Rosse, who as of yesterday had
not xeceived an official response
from the Reagan Foundation re
garding his request for site dis
closure, declined to comment on
Campbell's latest remarks.
Campbell could not be reached
for comment yesterday.
Campbell's comments Monday
were an indirect response to a
statement made by Rosse at a Fac
ulty Senate meeting Feb. 19. At
that meeting, Rosse told the sen
ate he was going to write a letter to
Campbell requesting a disclosure
of the center's planned site.
According to the Mercury News,
the letter was sent to Campbell
last Friday, but Campbell had not
received it as of Monday.
Anthony Siegman, professor of
electrical engineering and mem
ber of the Faculty Senate, said yes
terday he thought it "odd" that
