# Panofsky urges testing ban

### MORTY POSNER Editorial staff 
In the wake of the Soviet Union's underground nu
clear test last Thursday, arms control expert
Wolfgang Panofsky told an audience in Terman
Auditorium last night that the detonation of nuclear
explosives is "the most violent act man can do in
peacetime."
The Soviet test, conducted in Kazakhstan, ended
the Soviet Union's 18-month moratorium on nuclear
testing. The Soviets have proposed resumption of
regular testing unless the United States joins them
in a moratorium.
In reaction to the test, the State Department
issued a statement saying that "when the Soviets
choose to resume nuclear testing is their decision."
The United States had conducted nuclear tests
during the Soviet moratorium.
Panofsky, director emeritus of the Stanford Linear
Accelerator Center, noted that there are two stum
bling blocks that make it unlikely that the United
States would join the Soviets in a bilateral
moratorium.
"If you have a reciprocal moratorium, there is no
agreed method of verification,'' said Panofsky. In ad
dition, critics of a moratorium claim that the United
States needs the tests to maintain its security.

Arms control expert Wolfgang Panofsky tells an audience in
Terman Auditorium last night that a bilateral nuclear test ban is
not likely soon.
"The current status in nuclear
testing is very discouraging,"
Panofsky said.
Panofsky called for the negotia
tion of a comprehensive test ban
treaty (CTBT) as a means of elim
inating nuclear tests and slowing
nuclear proliferation.
Although the United States
joined the Soviet Union and the
United Kingdom in 1963 in sign
ing the Limited Test Ban Treaty
(LTBT), which prevents nuclear
tests under water, in outer space
and in the atmosphere. President
Kennedy had to pursue an aggres
sive program of underground nu
clear tests in order to gain Senate
approval of the treaty.
"Note that when the LTBT was
enacted, testing in the atmos
phere ceased, but total nuclear
testing increased," Panofsky said.
He argued that a CTBT would be
the most effective measure be
cause it would prohibit all tests.
"Only a comprehensive treaty
would have a great deal of

leverage." Panofsky said. "The
world really considers progress
towards a CTBT as a symbolic
means to get control of destructive
technology."
Panofsky charged that "the U.S.
position is basically destructive to
gaining a CTBT" in that the
Reagan administration's policy is
that it will not negotiate such a
treaty with the Soviet Union until
nuclear weapons are no longer a
part of the Soviet arsenal.
Panofsky assailed proposals for
a "phased approach" to reaching a
comprehensive test ban as "not a
very helpful thing."
Proponents of a "phased ap
proach" call for a combination of a
threshold test ban of less than the
150 kiloton level of the unratified
Threshold Test Ban Treaty signed
in 1974, and a quota test ban that
would limit nuclear explosions to
only a few per year.
Anything less than a compre
hensive ban would not prevent
nuclear proliferation, Panofsky
argued, because if nations with
out a nuclear capability could con
duct a few tests a year, those na
tions "could join the nuclear
club."
