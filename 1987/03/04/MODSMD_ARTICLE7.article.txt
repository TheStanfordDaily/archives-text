In the wake of the Soviet Union's underground nu
clear test last Thursday, arms control expert
Wolfgang Panofsky told an audience in Terman
Auditorium last night that the detonation of nuclear
explosives is "the most violent act man can do in
peacetime."
The Soviet test, conducted in Kazakhstan, ended
the Soviet Union's 18-month moratorium on nuclear
testing. The Soviets have proposed resumption of
regular testing unless the United States joins them
in a moratorium.
In reaction to the test, the State Department
issued a statement saying that "when the Soviets
choose to resume nuclear testing is their decision."
The United States had conducted nuclear tests
during the Soviet moratorium.
Panofsky, director emeritus of the Stanford Linear
Accelerator Center, noted that there are two stum
bling blocks that make it unlikely that the United
States would join the Soviets in a bilateral
moratorium.
"If you have a reciprocal moratorium, there is no
agreed method of verification,'' said Panofsky. In ad
dition, critics of a moratorium claim that the United
States needs the tests to maintain its security.
