Reagan names new CIA director
WASHINGTON — President Reagan yesterday named FBI Direc
tor William Webster as his director of central intelligence in an ac
tion that White House officials said was part of a swift-moving ef
fort to repair some of the damage caused by the Iran-contra affair.
The 62-year-old Webster, who has headed the Federal Bureau of
Investigation for the past nine years, was selected a day after act
ing Central Intelligence Agency director Robert Gates withdrew
his name from nomination rather than risk a Senate battle over
his nomination. In a statement the president said "Bill Webster
will bring remarkable depth and breadth of experience, as well as
an outstanding record of achievement to this position."
White House sources said that Reagan had planned to an
nounce the appointment himself, as part of a campaign to demon
strate that he is acting rapidly to rebuild his administration and
restore his credibility. But Webster, who was offered the job by
Reagan in a 10:20 a.m. telephone call, did not call back to accept It
until 6:04 p.m., prompting a hasty announcement in the White
House briefing room by spokesman Marlin Fitzwater in time for
the evening network news broadcasts.
House Speaker challenges Reagan
WASHINGTON — House Speaker Jim Wright, D-Texas, accused
the Reagan administration yesterday of violating the law in its
arms sales to Iran and called on President Reagan to acknowledge
"the fundamental errors inherent" in the arms-sale policy when
he speaks to the nation tonight.
Democratic sources said Wright's toughly worded statement
was part of an overall strategy in which House Democrats plan to
challenge Reagan to demonstrate he has reasserted control over
administration policy by dealing with Congress on a number of
difficult issues, beginning with the budget deficit.
"The president has an opportunity to show he's really engaged
by engaging on the budget," said House Majority Whip Tony
Coelho, D-Calif. "The future is the budget. That is our next crisis
and the president doesn't understand that."
In his statement, Wright said the administration had "flouted
the clear legal requirements" of three laws in failing to notify
Congress of the arms sales to Iran. He also joined others, includ
ing some Republicans, in insisting that Reagan acknowledge in
his nationally televised speech that the arms-sale policy, not just
its implementation, was deeply flawed.
Court extends law to AIDS victims
WASHINGTON — The Supreme Court, rebuffing the Reagan ad
ministration, yesterday extended the protection of a key federal
anti-discrimination law to AIDS victims.
The 7-2 decision said the 1973 law banning discrimination
against the handicapped by employers, schools, and others receiv
ing federal funds does not exclude persons from its coverage
simply because their disease is contagious.
The long-awaited ruling, in a case involving a Florida teacher
fired because she had tuberculosis, came amid growing contro
versy over discrimination against people with AIDS in employ
ment, housing, insurance and education.
The court explicitly rejected the Justice Department's view that
employers may legally fire AIDS victims because of a "fear of con
tagion whether reasonable or not."
The "basic purpose" of the law, Justice William Brennan wrote
for the majority, "was to ensure that handicapped individuals are
not denied jobs or other benefits because of the prejudiced atti
tudes or the ignorance or others."
Congress, he said, sought to prevent "discrimination on the
basis of mythology. . . . The act is carefully structured to replace
such reflexive reactions to actual or perceived handicaps with ac
tions based on reasoned and medically sound judgments," Bren
nan said. Chief Justice William Rehnquist and Justice Antonin
Scalia dissented.
Nancy Reagan takes active role
WASHINGTON — As President Reagan's popularity has plunged
during the Iran-contra scandal, Nancy Reagan has emerged not
only as her husband's staunchest defender but also as a political
strategist with influence far exceeding that of most presidential
wives.
Donald Regan is only the latest victim of her mounting effort to
repair the president's image and preserve his place in history.
Regan's resignation last week followed a public display of un
seemly feuding with the first lady, including public disclosure
that the two had hung up on each other in the midst of telephone
conversations.
Now. as the effort to rescue and rebuild the Reagan presidency
becomes a top priority at the White House, sources close to Nancy
Reagan expect her to become still more active in propelling the
president into activities that might deflect attention from the
Iran-contra scandal.
Presidential campaigns starting
WASHINGTON — Two 1988 presidential contenders, Republi
can Senate leader Bob Dole of Kansas and Democratic Sen.
Joseph Biden of Delaware, announced the formation yesterday of
exploratory committees that will lay the groundwork for their ex
pected campaigns for the White House.
The committee for Dole, whom polls show to be the chief chal
lenger to Vice President George Bush for his party's nomination,
will be headed by Robert Ellsworth, a former Kansas congressman
and longtime friend of Dole who was involved in the 1968 Richard
Nixon campaign and later served in the Nixon administration as
ambassador to NATO.
"I think the Republican race is wide open," Ellsworth said.
China's crackdown: Not tyranny
BEIJING - Secretary of State George Shultz said yesterday that
he has been assured by China's top leaders that Beijing's current
crackdown on Western influences will not lead to the sort of
tyranny that marked the Cultural Revolution of the 1960s and
19705.
Speaking at a press conference after two days of meetings with
Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping and his top aides. Shultz said he
believed that the Chinese leaders were sincere in their promise
not to allow recent political turmoil to affect China's foreign policy
or to scuttle a decade of political and economic reform.
"The current developments should not be regarded as a return
to the restrictions and repressions of the not-too-distant past,"
Shultz said. "I heard a statement to the friends of China, of which
I am one. and the Chinese themselves who are abroad, not to
equate what is happening today to particular practices of persecu
tions or movements of the recent past."
He was clearly referring to the rampant human rights abuses
that marked Mao Tse-tung's Cultural Revolution and other
Chinese upheavals like the anti-rightist campaign of the 19505.
After several years of political relaxation and economic reform,
China has begun what is officially called a campaign against
"bourgeois liberalism." the regime's code term for Western influ
ences and American-style democracy.
