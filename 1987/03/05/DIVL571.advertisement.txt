H As a Product Manager at M icrosoft, you have a head start over the rest. H
First you work closely with a brilliant software development team. Then you handle every H
aspect of a product from inception to distribution. And you have a tradition of winners: H
from MS-DOS, to QuickBASIC, to the powerful Microsoft Excel spreadsheet. You also H
have a name that is known by personal computer users throughout the world. H
HU But there's a challenge, too. You must bring important advances in software
technology within the understanding of the business world. You'll determine the strategy H

by step. You'll guide the software of the future to its place as a practical part of the business H
as usual.

■ equally at home with software concepts and marketing plans. H

MBA as well as experience in software marketing or product management, we want to taik H|
|H with you. We're looking for thebest — leaders and visionaries—those who have
Hj demonstrated technical/marketing ability and a record of achievement.
■ Our location in the Pacific Northwest, near Seattle, is one of the most diverse in the H
country--an area where quality of life is high and exciting. Mountains for skiing, hiking, H
IV and climbing are close enough for day-tripping. Three spectacular national parks are H:
■ within easy reach. The beautiful San Juan Islands are yours to explore by sailboat or ferry, H
H car or bike. Fishing? Only if you like salmon and steelhead. |H

we'll take care of you with generous benefits and relocation packages. H
