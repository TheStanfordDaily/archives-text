# Pollard sentenced to life for spying

WASHINGTON â€” Confessed spy Jonathan
Jay Pollard, who seriously damaged national
security by passing thousands of pages of U.S.
defense secrets to Israeli intelligence agents,
was sentenced to life imprisonment yesterday,
and his wife received two five-year sentences.
Pollard, 32, a former civilian intelligence
analyst for the U.S. Navy, stood passively as
Chief U.S. District Judge Aubrey Robinson Jr.
imposed the sentences. But his wife, Anne
Henderson-Pollard. 26, screamed, "No, no,
no!" and collapsed into the arms of Pollard and
her attorney, James Hibey.
Pollard could be eligible for parole in 10
years, but U.S. Attorney Joseph diGenova,
who directed the prosecution, said he believes
that Pollard never will be paroled because of
the gravity of his crime. Anne Pollard, who had
pleaded guilty to lesser charges, will be eligible
for parole after serving 46 months in prison,
authorities said.
Before sentencing, the Pollards expressed
remorse for their actions and made emotional

pleas to the judge to show leniency toward
each other. They said they had sought only to
help Israel and believed that no harm had
come to the United States.
But Robinson said he was convinced that
their actions had seriously damaged U.S. na
tional security, as reflected in a classified
statement from Secretary of Defense Caspar
Weinberger that prosecutors gave the court.
Assistant U.S. Attorney Charles Leeper said
that Pollard's spying caused "exceptionally
grave damage" to national security and that
the documents passed to Israel amounted to "a
volume of classified information, 10 feet by 6
feet by 6 feet."
The documents included satellite photos,
data on Soviet weaponry and the location of
U.S. ships and training exercises, according to
government officials. Leeper discounted
claims by the Pollards that no harm could
befall the United States by sharing such data
with an ally like Israel, saying that no other
country can be counted upon to "give the same

measure of protection" to U.S. intelligence.
The sentencing of the Pollards, combined
with the indictment only a day earlier of a
senior Israeli Air Force officer in connection
with the case, is certain to add further tension
to U.S./Israeli relations, which have been sig
nificantly strained by disputes over the extent
of Israel's role in the Iran-contra affair.
A federal grand jury in Washington Tuesday
indicted Israeli Brig. Gen. Aviem "Avi" Sella on
charges that he recruited Pollard in 1984 and,
together with lower-ranking officials, received
documents from him over an 18-month per
iod.
Sella is the first official of a U.S. ally ever to
be charged with espionage against the United
States. However, authorities said he may never
be tried because the U.S./Israeli extradition
treaty does not cover espionage.
Pollard, addressing the court, said he had
begun spying without pay, attributing his ac
tions to his affection for Israel.
