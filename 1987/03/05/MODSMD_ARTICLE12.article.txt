# New traffic circle to be tested
## 
### JEFF SEINFELD Staff writer 
The experimental bicycle traffic circle constructed
between of the Clock Tower and Engineering Corner
Feb. 24 was a success, the Bicycle Safety Committee
decided Tuesday, but the committee wants to
redesign and rebuild the circle over spring break.
Temporary committee member Bob Segar of the
Planning Office said that, in comparison with previ
ous observations, "traffic moved more smoothly"
throughout the three and a half days that the circle
was used. The committee observed, however, that
only about half the bicyclists compiled with the
circle's "right only" signs.
The circle consisted of a water-filled fire hose
situated In the middle of the Intersection, sur
rounded by a series of directional signs and warn
ings.
According to Segar, the committee "would like to
do another circle" that would make directions "a lot
clearer" to bicyclists. The new circle would differ
from the old "in the way it's marked," said Segar. It
would Include taped markers on the ground and
"some kind of cone that wouldn't hurt people If they
ran into it."
Segar said the final decision on redesign and
reconstruction will be made by architect Tom Rich
man of the Planning Office, who will return next
week from vacation. The committee's consensus
without Richman, Segar said, Is that it would like to
"use the opportunity over spring break to install a
better circle."
The committee hopes the second circle will work
better than the first because it will be better designed
and up for a longer period of time so bicyclists can
become accustomed to it. Segar said.

Bicycle Safety Committee Coordinator Margaret
Wang felt less strongly about the success of the first
experiment. "It didn't work as well as we wanted it
to," Wand said, largely because of "problems of
people turning to the left" against the indicated di
rection. !
More specifically, Segar said, cyclists traveling
from White Plaza to the language corner often simply
cut the corner, rather than going around the circle. I
Wang said Stanford "doesn't have the same kind of
intersection" as the prototype traffic circles at UC-
Davis, and so "maybe a circle isn't the best thing."
Davis has heavier volume, but its traffic circles con
trol regular four-way intersections, in contrast to the
wide, multi-proportioned intersection at Engineer
ing Corner.
Freshman Clifford Yee, a member of the commit'
tee, felt more satisfied with the project. "Traffic ran
more smoothly," he said.
One problem is the slope of the hill, he said, which
inclines toward Tresidder Union. This, combined
with the circle itself, does not appeal to people who
do not want to turn the full circle when making a left
turn. The solution, Yee concluded, will be "more edu
cation" through a better design and a prolonged test
period.
Student reactions were mixed, Yee added. Yee said
some students commended him and the committee,
but some did not understand the need for the circle.
Freshman Scott Aitken understood the purpose of
the circle, but expressed pessimism toward the proj
ect. "I thought it was an interesting idea," Aitken
said. "But I don't think the general student popula
tion will ever go along with it."
Although he said the circle had "not much effect"
on pedestrian travel, Yee added that bicyclists fared
well. "When it's more slow it's more safe," he said.
