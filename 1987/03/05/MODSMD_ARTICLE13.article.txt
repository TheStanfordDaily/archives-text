Tired of having to bike across campus at 2
a.m. to see the love of your life, despite
having conned your parents into buying you
that used car for your birthday?
Upset about being forced to walk from the
Cowell Cluster to Sterling Quad to return a
Poli Sci 35 textbook to a friend, even though
you've paid your *22 to the University for the
privilege of parking your car on campus?
The University should charge students for
parking stickers, but one price should allow
the purchaser to park in any dormitory lot on
campus.
It is time to end the era of Dormitory East,
Dormitory West, Governor's Corner, Row and
Cowell Cluster parking permits.
Students who pay to park on campus
should not be prevented from using their
cars by the threat of a parking ticket.
Officials at the University say that allowing

students to park anywhere on campus may
result in residents not being able to find a
place in their own dorm parking lot. This
logic is specious. For every non-resident
visiting a friend at Roble, for example, there
may be a corresponding Roble resident visit
ing a friend elsewhere. The total demand for
parking spaces at Roble most likely would
remain constant.
Unlike many of the irritating and unfor
tunate policies of University bureaucracies,
this annoyance can be solved with a mini
mum of effort. By printing only one sticker
and issuing it to all dorm residents, time and
money will be conserved.
There is no logical reason to preserve the
status quo. The Committee on Parking and
Transportation should consider this issue at
its next meeting, and the policy should be
changed.
