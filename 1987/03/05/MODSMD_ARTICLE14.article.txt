# The 						educated vs. the pro-fros

### 
I saw one of those guys on campus the other
day — the ones who take pictures for the books
they mail to the neophytes waiting to come to
Stanford. I think my year (we are wild, we are
free, we're the Class of '83), it was called
"Approaching Stanford." Anyway, one can al
ways distinguish these particular photogra
phers by the type of camera they use: the kind
that is focused by viewing straight down into
the unit, as opposed to those which are held in
front of the face while squinting. And they al
ways have their tripod established in an ob
vious aesthetically strategic location. Well, the
point of all this being, I began to wonder in
what significant respect is the person who has
been at Stanford a few years different from the
one who charges the mailbox every day in an
ticipation of her/his "Approaching Stanford."
In other words, I felt it was finally time to sit
down and attempt to formulate an in
formative, cogent response to that perennial
question within the familial Thanksgiving
context: "What are they teaching you out there
at Stanford?"

COLE THOMPSON

After winnowing the really far-out possible
responses, I decided that, perhaps, the most
practical difference between the "approaching"
and.the "a few years at Stanford" persons is a
remarkably increased ability to use an exten
sive number and wide variety of polysyllabic
entities, or denotative utterances. And a large,
bottomless well of obscure, esoteric words that
one may freely draw from, even if only in ran

dom blurtations, is no insignificant thing.
Sure, it will transmute a grade of "Charlie
dash" to a plain "Bravo" on your papers by
some ineffable force that teachers cannot help
but succumb to.
Except maybe within the English Depart
ment. The word on the street is that it teaches
one to never use "utilize" when "use" can be
used. But these are the same people that com
mented in red ink, "turnip squeezer," on my
paper in which I argued that the old man in
"The Old Man and the Sea" was actually fight
ing a primordial instinct, symbolized by the
fish, to return to the consciousness of a male
gamete. I think I received a grade of "Donald
dash" on that one. So, obviously, what do they
know about words in the English Department,
anyway? The real academic muscle-flexing is
to be found elsewhere.
To resume the thread then, not only can a
fecund vocabulary be beneficial in the aca
demic sphere, but it can prove itself invaluable
in the real world of everyday situations. And
being of a pragmatic slant, it is within this sort
of context, I believe, that a "Stanford educa
tion" should be defined so as to demonstrate
its true significance. For instance, consider
the following vignette and two subsequent
responses:
It's 6:45 a.m. on Saturday when an an irate
parent storms into your room and awakens
you from inanimate slumber. You stare up.
half-consciously, trying to find some familiar
reference point in the flux of sense data. But
last night's heated game of malt liquor quar
ters makes this task somewhat formidable.
Eventually, you notice a moving, round object
like a Pac-man. Then you discern, because it is
increasing in size, that it is not moving across

your screen, but is coming toward you. A nasty
jerk on the arm brings about a semblance of
orientation which is sufficient to inform you
that you are now located in the garage, where
the parent pulls back a sheet, uncovering a
chalk-delineated thing in the trunk of the car.
The parent demands to know. "What hap
pened?"
Verbal reply number one — the "Ap
proaching Stanford" reply: "Well, I guess I blew
beats in the trunk of the Mercedes. I'm sorry."
"You guess what?" the parent asks in disbelief.
And once again, you give it your best, "I guess I
blew. . ." and so on. Quite obviously, it's 40
days in the cooler and no prom for this pitiful
comrade.
Verbal reply number two — the "a few years
at Stanford" reply: "Hmm, it's clearly some sort
of atavistic phenomenon. You know how much
grandpa drank. Or then again, maybe it's only
illusory. Perhaps we, qua percipients, are
deluded about it actual existence. Let's go dis
cuss it over a half-gallon of water. I mean,
surely you're not insinuating that I'm in any
way culpable here. Such a thing would con
stitute a veritable fissure in the tapestry of
justice. Don't you see that?" Now, five times
out of six our Stanford-educated protagonist is
going to escape with some sort of reduced sen
tence, simply by virtue of the absurd
denotative utterances which she/he was able
to utilize.
Thus, as this real-life scenario suggests, the
capacity to draw from a well of "biggies," when
the situation calls for it, is a significant differ
ence between the "approaching" and "a few
years at" Stanford persons.

responses, I decided that, perhaps, the most
practical difference between the "approaching"
and.the "a few years at Stanford" persons is a
remarkably increased ability to use an exten
sive number and wide variety of polysyllabic
entities, or denotative utterances. And a large,
bottomless well of obscure, esoteric words that
one may freely draw from, even if only in ran

dom blurtations, is no insignificant thing.
Sure, it will transmute a grade of "Charlie
dash" to a plain "Bravo" on your papers by
some ineffable force that teachers cannot help
but succumb to.
Except maybe within the English Depart
ment. The word on the street is that it teaches
one to never use "utilize" when "use" can be
used. But these are the same people that com
mented in red ink, "turnip squeezer," on my
paper in which I argued that the old man in
"The Old Man and the Sea" was actually fight
ing a primordial instinct, symbolized by the
fish, to return to the consciousness of a male
gamete. I think I received a grade of "Donald
dash" on that one. So, obviously, what do they
know about words in the English Department,
anyway? The real academic muscle-flexing is
to be found elsewhere.
To resume the thread then, not only can a
fecund vocabulary be beneficial in the aca
demic sphere, but it can prove itself invaluable
in the real world of everyday situations. And
being of a pragmatic slant, it is within this sort
of context, I believe, that a "Stanford educa
tion" should be defined so as to demonstrate
its true significance. For instance, consider
the following vignette and two subsequent
responses:
It's 6:45 a.m. on Saturday when an an irate
parent storms into your room and awakens
you from inanimate slumber. You stare up.
half-consciously, trying to find some familiar
reference point in the flux of sense data. But
last night's heated game of malt liquor quar
ters makes this task somewhat formidable.
Eventually, you notice a moving, round object
like a Pac-man. Then you discern, because it is
increasing in size, that it is not moving across

your screen, but is coming toward you. A nasty
jerk on the arm brings about a semblance of
orientation which is sufficient to inform you
that you are now located in the garage, where
the parent pulls back a sheet, uncovering a
chalk-delineated thing in the trunk of the car.
The parent demands to know. "What hap
pened?"
Verbal reply number one — the "Ap
proaching Stanford" reply: "Well, I guess I blew
beats in the trunk of the Mercedes. I'm sorry."
"You guess what?" the parent asks in disbelief.
And once again, you give it your best, "I guess I
blew. . ." and so on. Quite obviously, it's 40
days in the cooler and no prom for this pitiful
comrade.
Verbal reply number two — the "a few years
at Stanford" reply: "Hmm, it's clearly some sort
of atavistic phenomenon. You know how much
grandpa drank. Or then again, maybe it's only
illusory. Perhaps we, qua percipients, are
deluded about it actual existence. Let's go dis
cuss it over a half-gallon of water. I mean,
surely you're not insinuating that I'm in any
way culpable here. Such a thing would con
stitute a veritable fissure in the tapestry of
justice. Don't you see that?" Now, five times
out of six our Stanford-educated protagonist is
going to escape with some sort of reduced sen
tence, simply by virtue of the absurd
denotative utterances which she/he was able
to utilize.
Thus, as this real-life scenario suggests, the
capacity to draw from a well of "biggies," when
the situation calls for it, is a significant differ
ence between the "approaching" and "a few
years at" Stanford persons.
