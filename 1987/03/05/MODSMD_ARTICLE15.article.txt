Responsibility
and Reagan
;I-tearly in the Iran-contra scan
<l€(lvwhen the Reagan administra
tion was still claiming that arms
sales to Iran were in pursuit of
Important national interests
Father than hostages, administra
tion spokesmen tried to justify
skirting the Congress. President
Roosevelt's illegal aid to Britain in
-(he early days of World War II was
.es4led upon as a precedent for
pursuing dire national interests
against the will of Congress.
While this was just a cover story
(of the egregious Iran dealings, it
>s clearly the heartfelt opinion of
Reagan and many in his adminis
tration concerning aid to the
epntras.
. Now that some of the details are
out. we can see how the Reagan
administration's defiance of
Qongress measures up to
Roosevelt's. Roosevelt took every
pain to be as informed as he
could be about the illegal dealings
with the British. He commun
icated directly with Churchill and
he had William Stephenson.
William Donovan and other key
•Operatives report directly to him.
. In the Reagan administration,
by.contrast, it seems that every
one from Reagan on down was
Xyjng to preserve their
deniabillty. even though it meant
.abdication of oversight. Think of
;what that means: Every one of
•CHjPQe people chose to put their
!ov*h personal Interest — their
personal deniablllty — above the
-public interest in a sane policy.

constitute taking responsl

bility, though Reagan is loathe to
do even that, shamelessly wel
coming instead every report of
how little he knew.
The corruption at the top
seems to have pervaded the entire
policy-making apparatus. Robert
Gates, number two man at the
CIA, admitted in his Senate con
firmation hearings for the CIA
directorship that he did not
pursue knowledge of the Iran
contra dealings because he didn't
want to know.
Was there one man or woman
in the Reagan administration
who wanted to scrutinize the
policy, who tried to step in and
make sure the policy was sound?
Couldn't Secretary of State
George Shultz have said to Regan
"I'll let you make the decisions,
but I want to know everything
that's going on?" Did not one of
them see how to love the public
interest above their own?

No Splendor
on the Grass
this year?
I would like to address an open
letter to the campus community
to explain why it seems unlikely
at this moment that "Splendor on
the Grass" will be held at Man
zanita Park this year, unlike the
previous 15 years (roughly).
"Splendor" costs about *7,000
to put on each year, most coming
from a commercial sponsor
(Bud/Miller), but >2.000 of which
is allocated from Manzanita's
activities fund. Most of the people
attending are undergrads from
other dorms (about 2,000 people
came last year over the course of
the day. while we have only 350
residents).
As an aside. I should point out
the irony that the biggest (and
best-funded) party on campus
was organized entirely by
graduates last year — the ones to
whom letters about social brain

death are periodically addressed
in The Daily. (We were even dis
couraged from seeking Graduate
Student Association sponsorship
in case having the grad logo on
the fliers would reduce atten
dance!) It was saddening that thle
funds contributed by all under
grad dorms last year did not pay
for the cost of having ASSU dis
tribute publicity to those
residences.
This year the response to our
fund raising so far has been bet
ter than last year (thanks!), but
may not be enough to prevent a
repeat of last year's deficit, which
was covered personally by a sum
mer RA. Our costs are essentially
fixed — once the stages and
sound are set up, putting a band
on them costs relatively little —
which leads to a depressing con
clusion.
In a sense this letter is an ap
peal: We can, and will, run
"Splendor" this year, if there is
more than a minimal commit
ment from the rest of campus.
Within two weeks we'll have to
decide whether or not there will
be any music emanating from
Manzanita on May 16. It depends
on your house meetings over the
next week.

Properly used
condoms will
reduce risks
In response to Lyn Bowman's
letter (Daily. Feb. 25), I would
first like to point out that the 9.6
percent failure rate for the con
dom which he cites is that of the
typical user. In other words, out
of 100 couples who start the year
using condoms as their stated
method of contraception, but who
do not use them consistently (1.e.,
every time they have intercourse)
and correctly. 9.6 pregnancies
will result. However, the theoreti
cal failure rate is only 2 percent.

This means that out of 100
women who use this method
consistently and correctly over
the course of a year, only two
become pregnant. Informed
couples can, and do, use the
condom in this effective manner.
For maximum effectiveness of
the condom, correct use means:
□ Storing the condom in a cool,
dry place (like fine wine!).
□ Putting the condom on before
any penile-vaginal and/or penile
anal contact occurs.
□ Leaving a 1/2 inch tip on the
end of the condom if none is
provided.
□ Checking for air bubbles while
the condom is on.
□ Holding the condom onto the
base of the still erect penis when
withdrawing.
The failure rate can be reduced
even further by using spermicides
in conjunction with the condom.
I would also like to respond to
Bowman's "Russian roulette"
metaphor. It is true that, besides
abstinence, no method of contra
ception or sexually transmitted
disease (STD) risk reduction is
100 percent effective. I suppose it
is this fact that prompted Bow
man to make the analogy. I would
have to agree that health
educators and practitioners need
to be careful in their statements
about condoms. Condoms will
drastically help reduce the risks
of STDs and unwanted preg
nancy. but will not completely
eliminate them. However. I would
hardly compare condom use to
Russian roulette. These sorts of
comparisons can only lead to
hysteria and feelings of helpless
ness at a time when sensitivity is
crucial.
Condoms can have a substan
tial preventative effect — which is
certainly better than nothing at
all. In the end. though, it is each
individual's choice as to how
much risk she/he is willing to
take. In my opinion, using con
doms is an important and
worthwhile choice to help reduce
these risks.

No Splendor
on the Grass
this year?
I would like to address an open
letter to the campus community
to explain why it seems unlikely
at this moment that "Splendor on
the Grass" will be held at Man
zanita Park this year, unlike the
previous 15 years (roughly).
"Splendor" costs about *7,000
to put on each year, most coming
from a commercial sponsor
(Bud/Miller), but >2.000 of which
is allocated from Manzanita's
activities fund. Most of the people
attending are undergrads from
other dorms (about 2,000 people
came last year over the course of
the day. while we have only 350
residents).
As an aside. I should point out
the irony that the biggest (and
best-funded) party on campus
was organized entirely by
graduates last year — the ones to
whom letters about social brain

death are periodically addressed
in The Daily. (We were even dis
couraged from seeking Graduate
Student Association sponsorship
in case having the grad logo on
the fliers would reduce atten
dance!) It was saddening that thle
funds contributed by all under
grad dorms last year did not pay
for the cost of having ASSU dis
tribute publicity to those
residences.
This year the response to our
fund raising so far has been bet
ter than last year (thanks!), but
may not be enough to prevent a
repeat of last year's deficit, which
was covered personally by a sum
mer RA. Our costs are essentially
fixed — once the stages and
sound are set up, putting a band
on them costs relatively little —
which leads to a depressing con
clusion.
In a sense this letter is an ap
peal: We can, and will, run
"Splendor" this year, if there is
more than a minimal commit
ment from the rest of campus.
Within two weeks we'll have to
decide whether or not there will
be any music emanating from
Manzanita on May 16. It depends
on your house meetings over the
next week.

Properly used
condoms will
reduce risks
In response to Lyn Bowman's
letter (Daily. Feb. 25), I would
first like to point out that the 9.6
percent failure rate for the con
dom which he cites is that of the
typical user. In other words, out
of 100 couples who start the year
using condoms as their stated
method of contraception, but who
do not use them consistently (1.e.,
every time they have intercourse)
and correctly. 9.6 pregnancies
will result. However, the theoreti
cal failure rate is only 2 percent.

This means that out of 100
women who use this method
consistently and correctly over
the course of a year, only two
become pregnant. Informed
couples can, and do, use the
condom in this effective manner.
For maximum effectiveness of
the condom, correct use means:
□ Storing the condom in a cool,
dry place (like fine wine!).
□ Putting the condom on before
any penile-vaginal and/or penile
anal contact occurs.
□ Leaving a 1/2 inch tip on the
end of the condom if none is
provided.
□ Checking for air bubbles while
the condom is on.
□ Holding the condom onto the
base of the still erect penis when
withdrawing.
The failure rate can be reduced
even further by using spermicides
in conjunction with the condom.
I would also like to respond to
Bowman's "Russian roulette"
metaphor. It is true that, besides
abstinence, no method of contra
ception or sexually transmitted
disease (STD) risk reduction is
100 percent effective. I suppose it
is this fact that prompted Bow
man to make the analogy. I would
have to agree that health
educators and practitioners need
to be careful in their statements
about condoms. Condoms will
drastically help reduce the risks
of STDs and unwanted preg
nancy. but will not completely
eliminate them. However. I would
hardly compare condom use to
Russian roulette. These sorts of
comparisons can only lead to
hysteria and feelings of helpless
ness at a time when sensitivity is
crucial.
Condoms can have a substan
tial preventative effect — which is
certainly better than nothing at
all. In the end. though, it is each
individual's choice as to how
much risk she/he is willing to
take. In my opinion, using con
doms is an important and
worthwhile choice to help reduce
these risks.
