# TV mimics life
## 
### 
It is perhaps axiomatic that tele
vision — purveyor of popular and
political culture — grossly mis
represents reality. It is, we are
keen to say, a poor imitation of life
as it is and as we know it.
Much of what we see on TV
today is "common denominator"
television: shows that appeal to
the broadcast audience. This way,
the stories and newscasts aren't
too dull or too complicated to be
understood and appreciated by,
say, the janitor in Peoria or the
President of the United States.

So we are given doses of reality
in 30-minute, one-hour, and two
hour shots. But somewhere in the
backs or our minds — or perhaps
closer to the front — there is the
lingering suspicion that what we
see on television is, in the end,
simply a performance. As we
watch the lights flicker from the
set, the images parade across the
screen, we clearly see that televi
sion is merely a stage on which ac
tors pursue their craft.
This awareness further dis
tances television from reality. In
fact, the most believable thing
about television is that it's so un
believable. Most of us find most of
it boring, a collective yawn, and,
worse, superficial. Right?
A rumble. A stir. The explosion
of popular myth. The fact is: What
we see on the tube is not wholly
different from our ways of being
and perceiving in "real life."
How's that again? Life imitates
— huh? — television. To an extent
greater than we thought possible
or desirable, unconsciously or
not, I think it is true that we
spend much of our lives convinc
ing others, playing different roles
and wearing different hats as the
occasions demand.
I am of course not saying that
everybody is superficial. It goes far
beyond superficial people doing
and saying superficial things. We
all rely on huge reserves of drama
and histrionics, affectation, pos
turing, even superficiality.
In a recent interview, David
Lynch, director of the controver

sial movie "Blue Velvet." described
one of the movie's themes that
grew out of his own observations.
He asked his interviewer to look
around the fashionable restau
rant where they were seated and
note the calm, pancaked faces, the
complacent exteriors.
Mr. Lynch said, in effect, that it
was impossible to really know
these people, know their true
feelings and underlying motives,
to know what dark secrets and
mysteries, anxieties and uncer
tainties lurk beneath those calm
surfaces.
Each one of us, individually, is
the only one aware of his true
feelings; his inner life. It is the
things we do and the things we
say that flesh out our personali
ties. That's how other people learn
about us — discover who we are
and discover who they think we
are.
There is, therefore, an assumed
level of trust in every human inter
action. Whether or not we are con
scious of it, this trust allows us to
make external judgments based
on our perceptions. We are con
stantly judging others, sizing
them up, figuring them out.
You furrow your eyebrows, I
think you are pensive. You laugh,
I think you appreciate my jokes.
But as I think about it, I realize
there is really no way for me to
know if you are, in fact, deep in
thought. And can I ever know if
you really think my jokes are
funny or do you just plaster a
smile on your face while inside
you mock me?
How can we trust the words, "I
love you" or "I really liked your last
column" if we know that we will
never truly connect to the inner
thoughts, the inner lives of the
persons whose mouths are saying
these words. Hmmm. Something
to think about.
So, what can we conclude from
all this? Either I am radically in
coherent, or television, the
therapeutic agent of the modern
era. does after all reveal insights
into the human condition.
Tonight's a good TV night, a
"Cheers" night. And during the
commercials, I'll wonder out loud
what the "Cheers" family will be
like when Shelley Long departs.
And no, this column wasn't
written in 40 minutes flat.
