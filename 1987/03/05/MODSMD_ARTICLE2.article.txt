# Lyons may depart from frat report
## 
### MARCUS MABRY Senior staff writer 
Dean of Student Affairs James Lyons an
nounced at a meeting of the Committee on Un
dergraduate Studies (C-US) last week that he
may depart substantially from the task force
recommendations made in the Report on Fra
ternities and Sororities at Stanford, according
to senior Damion Carmichael, member of C
bs.
Lyons said that he would recommend that
existing fraternities retain University housing,
but that no new fraternities, including those
that have lost housing privileges, be housed.
Initial recommendations from the Task
Force to Study Fraternities and Sororities at
Stanford were released in June 1984. They in

eluded suggestions that self-selective groups
such as fraternities be denied housing
privileges and that the University support
fraternal organizations and work more closely
with them.
Lyons said that he expects to have the final
draft of the report "in (his) hands" around
April 1. He said he will consider its contents
before making any decisions.
The final report has been delayed for three
years, largely because of disagreements be
tween Chairman Oscar Serbein, a business
school professor, and members of the task
force.
Carmichael said that he has the impression,
based on Lyons' comments and other informa
tion, that "the housed fraternities will, in all
likelihood, remain housed, but will most likely

dwindle in number with the possibility of
reaching zero at some date down the line."
The C-US invited Lyons to speak on the sub
ject of fraternities because it is considering
whether it should become actively involved
with current dialogue on the issue.
C-US Chairman Marsh McCall, professor of
classics, said that there is "very high interest"
among committee members.
"Virtually all the members believe quite
strongly, with a lot of differences of opinion
amongst them, that housed fraternities at
Stanford have a lot to do with the purposes
and goals of undergraduate education here,"
McCall said.
He said that the C-US only will get more in-
