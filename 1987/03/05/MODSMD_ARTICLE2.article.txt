# Lyons may depart from frat report
## 
### MARCUS MABRY Senior staff writer 
Dean of Student Affairs James Lyons an
nounced at a meeting of the Committee on Un
dergraduate Studies (C-US) last week that he
may depart substantially from the task force
recommendations made in the Report on Fra
ternities and Sororities at Stanford, according
to senior Damion Carmichael, member of C
bs.
Lyons said that he would recommend that
existing fraternities retain University housing,
but that no new fraternities, including those
that have lost housing privileges, be housed.
Initial recommendations from the Task
Force to Study Fraternities and Sororities at
Stanford were released in June 1984. They in

eluded suggestions that self-selective groups
such as fraternities be denied housing
privileges and that the University support
fraternal organizations and work more closely
with them.
Lyons said that he expects to have the final
draft of the report "in (his) hands" around
April 1. He said he will consider its contents
before making any decisions.
The final report has been delayed for three
years, largely because of disagreements be
tween Chairman Oscar Serbein, a business
school professor, and members of the task
force.
Carmichael said that he has the impression,
based on Lyons' comments and other informa
tion, that "the housed fraternities will, in all
likelihood, remain housed, but will most likely

dwindle in number with the possibility of
reaching zero at some date down the line."
The C-US invited Lyons to speak on the sub
ject of fraternities because it is considering
whether it should become actively involved
with current dialogue on the issue.
C-US Chairman Marsh McCall, professor of
classics, said that there is "very high interest"
among committee members.
"Virtually all the members believe quite
strongly, with a lot of differences of opinion
amongst them, that housed fraternities at
Stanford have a lot to do with the purposes
and goals of undergraduate education here,"
McCall said.
He said that the C-US only will get more in-
volved with the issue if the com
mittee decides that the status of
fraternities and sororities is truly
related to matters of academic
policy.
Lyons' attendence at the C-US
meeting, though it was by invita
tion, was part of a preparation
campaign for the soon-to-be
released report. Lyons said that he
is "beginning to alert different
groups that the report is near and
trying out ideas on them." He is
also detailing the review process
that the finished report will go
through.

In addition to describing the
review process, Lyons outlined the
history of sororities and fraterni
ties at Stanford, the history of the
task force, the complexities of its
report and the current status of
sororities and fraternities here.
Lyons cited figures demonstrat-
"substantial increase" in the
number of undergraduates par
ticipating in fraternities —
"roughly one out of every five" over
the last 10 years — and explained
that the dominant pattern of
fraternal membership at Stanford
today is no longer residential.
Currently, there are 11 residential
fraternities and 16 non
residential fraternities and
sororities at Stanford.
Based on these figures, Lyons

concluded that there "obviously is
a need" that fraternal organiza
tions fulfill.
"They (non-residential fraterni
ties and sororities) offer students
the best of a whole lot of different
worlds." Lyons said, noting that
students can keep their friends
and a variety of housing options.
Lyons said that once he has the
final draft he will send it to frater
nities, sororities and University
organizations. He will then dis
cuss the report's findings with
committees and groups through
out the University.
"By year's end I hope to have at
least a first draft of the Univer
sity's policy toward fraternities,"
Lyons said.
