Adventurous dining
at Gypsy Cellar
Gypsy Cellar
932 Middlefield Rd.
Redwood City
From the outside, the Gypsy Cellar
looks like little more than a renovated
Pizza Hut, but it is not lacking in style or
originality.
A generously stocked bar, a crowded
dining area and the evening's entertain
ment are the first things to confront the
adventurous diner. The bartender is
courteous and amiable, as is the rest of
the help. The violinist — who also hap
pens to own the restaurant — and his ac
companying pianist offer traditional
favorites from all over the world. He has
performed in Czechoslovakia, New
Zealand and San Francisco, finally com
ing to rest in Redwood City. His dinner
performances are a treat in themselves.
The decorative tapestry ceiling, red
candles, lanterns and Hungarian dolls
mix with the painted floral designs on the
beams and windows to ensure each
diner's emotional preparation for the
Czechoslovakian and Hungarian delights
to come.
The menu is not exceptionally varied,
but there should be no problem finding
something to please even the most picky
eater.
Since soup or salad is provided with the
meal, I skipped appetizers and selected
stuffed grape leaves for my friend and the
chicken thieves' special for myself.
My friend chose the cream of broccoli
soup and was rewarded with a delicious,
creamy but slightly bland blend. I had a
generous portion of leafy green salad with
the house dressing, which was slightly
too oily and bland.

The chicken thieves' special is served
with minted peas, flour dumplings and a
paprika and cream sauce. The partially
deboned chicken is tender and juicy and
the sauce brings the flavor out quite well.
Also served with minted peas, the
stuffed grape leaves are accompanied by a
wonderful wild rice. The three grape
leaves are rolled, hiding the ground beef
blend inside, and covered with a small
amount of sour cream. The leaves and the
cream battle for dominance over the
palate, and the struggle results in an in
teresting flavor experience indeed.
To cap off the pleasing experience, my
friend chose the chocolate torte from the
pastry plate and I selected strawberry
filled crepes. The torte was not overly
heavy and was incredibly smooth. The
crepes were delightfully fluffy without
being overly filling.
The atmosphere is interesting and ap
pealing without being overbearing. The
Gypsy Cellar is well worth the drive and
the ♦ 10 to * 16 cost for entrees.

Enjoy a celebration
of gluttony in S.J.
El Maghreb
145 W. Santa Clara Rd.
San Jose
Tired of conventions? Want a change?
Have you the urge to abandon all estab
lished forms of Western etiquette Just for
one night? Then throw down your sil
verware, get down on the floor and get
ready to enjoy an evening at El Maghreb.
Located in San Jose at the corner of
Santa Clara and Market, this authentic
Moroccan restaurant is 35 minutes away
from the Stanford campus. The drive,
however, is a small inconvenience to
endure in order to enjoy a celebration in
gluttony.
Upon entering this establishment, one
cannot help but be struck by the colorful
decor. The room is enveloped in an atmos
phere reminiscent of a cool tent in a hot
desert. The brass lanterns cast a dim glow
on the knee-high tables scattered about.
After absorbing the decor, we let the decor
absorb us as we sank into the inviting
cushions and prepared for a three-hour,
seven-course extravaganza.
We selected our meal from one of three
pre-established menus, ranging in price
from *16 to *18. Though fairly expensive,
this meal offers more than enough food
for even the largest of appetites. The
waiter prepares each diner for the meal by
first bathing the patron's hands in warm
water at the table. He then supplies each
guest with a napkin the size of a beach

towel, which will come in handy more
than once.
Our first course was harira, otherwise
known as lentil soup. This delightfully
spicy soup is sipped from the bowl and is
an excellent beginner. A Moroccan salad
follows, comprised of pickled tomatoes,
carrots and eggplant. This is spooned to
the mouth with freshly baked, piping-hot
bread.
The third course of the evening may be
the best on the menu. Bastela, literally
translated as "an appetizer," is a flaky
pastry filled with the unlikely combina
tion of boneless chicken, eggs and al
monds. This dish is dusted on top with
powdered sugar and cinnammon. The
end result is surprisingly good, and very
hard to follow.
From here, the three separate menus
deviate with the table's selection of a main
course. Our fourth course was a moist
cornish hen, basted with an olive sauce
and topped with preserved lemon. The
hen was cooked to perfection, but the
sauce was rather uneventful. The braised
lamb with honey sauce and almonds fol
lowed.
The rabbit braised with paprika sauce
is an alternative to the lamb. For those
who enjoy this spice, the gamey animal is
successfully complemented by the power
ful sauce. If you have more delicate taste
buds, however, you might find the domi
nant taste of paprika masks the rabbit.
The sixth course of the evening was the
traditional Moroccan favorite, conscous.
This dish consists of grains of semolina
steamed with raisins, onions and chick
peas. I am not personally a fan of con
scous, but my guest assured me that the
dish was excellently prepared.
The entire meal was accompanied by a
bottle of wine recommended by our con
genial and informative waiter. We were
brave and tried the "Sidi Mustapha's
Private Reserve." To our surprise and
delight, this Moroccan wine proved to be
mellow, smooth and dry, a good comple
ment to the vast variety of dishes served.
Finally, our waiter returned with the
water tureen and again washed our
hands. We were then sprayed with
scented water to remove any lingering
odors from the meal. Stuffed to the hilt
and content, we relaxed with a glass of
hot mint tea and a plate of chilled fruit
and nuts. It was in this truly decadent po
sition that we watched the belly dancer,
who performs nightly.
Obviously, El Maghreb serves as a
unique substitute for dining in the Palo
Alto area, but what may not be so evident
is that this nightlong experience can
quite successfully replace other tradi
tional forms of entertainment on the
Farm.
