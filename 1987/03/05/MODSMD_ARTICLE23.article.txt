# The 						Eastern karma

### 
Gaylord Restaurant
Stanford Shopping Center
Yes, Gaylord is in the Stanford Shop
ping Center. Between Cocolat and
Caravansary, across from Neiman's but
not contaminated by any of these,
Gaylord's Eastern karma remains intact.
Gaylord is a soothing place, uncluttered
and simple, but very elegant nonetheless.
An attentive staff greeted us at the door,
led us past the stylish bar and Tandoorl
ovens to the non-smoking section. Once
seated in a plush, forest-green booth un
der pale sand walls, we absorbed winding,
exotic sitar music. We studied the exten
sive wine list and the separate special
cocktail menu, and ordered beer. One of
the two Indian brews offered, Kingfisher
is a fine hops lager beer with a distinctive
gingery spiced flavor. It was a good pre
cursor and backdrop to the full-flavor
meal that followed.
We started with vegetable samosas,
which we dipped in a raisin and a mint
yogurt chuiney. These flaky dough tri
angles were filled with spiced potato and
pea. Next came mulligatawny soup — len
til, rice and chicken with a hefty wedge of
lemon. We found this to be Campbellized
— with all due respect — in its too-yellow
buttery cream. Not as spicy as it should
have been, it was all thickness and no
drama.
The soup was the first course of the
"Maharani Dinner," a queen-size combi
nation of three curries, pillau rice and
onion kulcha (a thin carbonic Tandoori
baked bread). Sag Gosht is a traditional
lamb curry with creamed spinach. Pack
ing a full, formal flavor, chunks of tender

seasoned lamb come covered in spicy
green. Chicken Masala was our second
spicy curry, tomato-based and also very
good. Navratan Korma is vegetable curry
with cubes of farmer's cheese, ground
nuts and a very wet, overly sweet cream
sauce. The pillau absorbs each curry
sauce, mellowing and fulfilling its taste.
From the Tandoori Kitchen, we ordered
the Tandoori "mixed grill," a copious se
lection of barbecued meats. Each meat is
marinated in spiced sauces for at least 24
hours berfore it is fired. Not overdone or
dry. each piece of chicken, lamb, fish and
shrimp had its own distinctly intense
flavor. Our only complaint here was with
the shish kebab, underdone and slightly
steak-tartesque. The Tandoori meats are
complemented with sauteed onions, and
we recommend, in addition, a squirt of
lemon to lighten the meatiness. A basket
of nan nicely accompanies both curry and
Tandoori kitchens, and is freshly baked
in Gaylord's Tandoori ovens.
Feeling pleasantly hot and quite full,
the prospects of cool sweet kulfi inspired
us. Chewy, rich and creamy, this frozen
dessert is wonderful with hot, strong cof
fee.
Gaylord offers an impressive array of
curries, barbecue and rice dishes, repre
sentative of the full range and diversity of
Indian cuisine. The prices are on the
steep side, entrees ranging from *12 to
*17. But you get what you pay for: The
service is up to the highest Indian stand
ards of graciousness, skill and hos
pitality. Overall, the evening was a sen
sually gratifying success.
