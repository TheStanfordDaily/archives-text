"The Moronic Inferno and Other
Visits to America"
By Martin Amis
New York: Viking Press, 1987

Who Is Martin Amis, and what
gives him the right to release a
book called "The Moronic Inferno
and Other Visits to America"?
Who the hell does he think he is?
Well, for everyone whose idea of a
talented young writer was Bret
Easton Ellis, welcome to Martin
Amis.
A few words about Amis:
Reading his biography, it strikes
you that his life seems so written.
No other young writer seems so
much like a literary conceit him
self. Known as "Britain's Brat of
Letters,"he is widely respected,
envied, gossiped about and
despised in British literary circles.
Gore Vidal calls him "that cute
little thing." Norman Mailer calls
him "that little shit." (Get crack
ing, creative writing majors! Some
day you too could be insulted by
Norman Mailer!)
Why all the attention? For one
thing, young Amis is the son of
Kingsley Amis (an eminent British
novelist, as you doubtless knew);
for another, he is the author of
five highly impressive novels him
self. I suppose I should mention
here that Martin Amis is my favor
ite novelist. There are five good
reasons for this.
Amis' first novel, "The Rachel
Papers" (1974), published when
he was just 24 years old, chron
icles the sexual misadventures of
a pimply literature student at Ox
ford — a character, it seems,
much like Martin Amis in his
formative years. Leaving aside the
queasy problem of reader identifi
cation, it must be said that "The
Rachel Papers" is a screamingly
funny look at the teenage mind,
with all its pretensions, evasions
and deceptions. And for all its
wistful moments, it's the only
Amis novel which can be thought
of as light-hearted. From then on,
the humor takes a sickening turn.
In Amis' next four books,
bruises lie throbbing under the
skin of each narrative. Lurking
beneath a bawdy, sarcastic
surface tone are the dark and ugly
undercurrents of modern life.
These come exploding to the fore
at the end of some novels, or, as in
the case of "Other People: A Mys
tery Story," they are left haunt
ingly unexplained. His unreliable
narrators seduce and betray their

audiences— this is what makes
the books so memorable. Amis'
voices are by turns, snide, witty,
vulgar, eloquent and even tragic
in a weird, eerie sort of way. Above
all else, though, his books are
savagely funny, or failing that,
just plain savage.
I mention all this because a
knowledge of Amis' already for
midable literary reputation is
helpful when reading "The
Moronic Inferno." "Inferno" is a
collection of essays dealing with
America, but the real meat of the
book lies in Amis' portraits of
American authors. He's not inter
ested in his own generation,
thank you — he goes after the

biggies, the grizzled old lions of
American letters."The Moronic
Inferno" should've been subtitled
"British Literary Punk Takes On
American Giants." Truman
Capote, Gore Vidal, Norman
Mailer, Kurt Vonnegut, Saul Bel
low, Philip Roth, John Updike —
the whole rogues' gallery is collec
ted here, all of them subjected to
the cold scalpel of Martin Amis'
wit.
The key to Amis' critical style is
that, rather than tackling or con
fronting the work of his subjects
head on. he instead whittles away
at their reputations. He takes off a

little here, a little there, and before
you know it, the oeuvre of an
entire lifetime has been reduced to
kindling. The only exception Is
Saul Bellow; with him, Amis
comes as close to being reverent as
he ever gets. As for the rest,
though, watch out. He picks them
off without breathing hard.
These essays aren't entirely ex
cerclses in literary criticism,
however. They're also character
studies, for Amis meets and inter
views each of the big names he
dispenses with so easily. These
encounters are some of "The
Moronic Inferno's" most interest
ing moments. We find poor Kurt
Vonnegut a poignant, almost for
lorn figure, forever doomed to car
rying the burden of "Slaughter-

House Five" on his back. Gore
Vidal is smirkingly complicit in
the Interview process — he "gives
good quote," and seems to leer off
the page. Mailer, by comparison.
Is a weary colossus who shrugs
his shoulders when confronted
with Amis. (We learn that he later
goes on British TV and denounces
Amis as a "little wimp." Attaboy.
Norman.)
Thus the central pieces In"The
Moronic Inferno" pose a problem. I
enjoyed them as well-written at
tempts to capture the various per
sonalities involved (and they're all
interesting personalities, regard
less of what you think of their
writings), but since I'm not
(ahem) entirely familiar with the
works of Mailen Vldal, et. al., I
wasn't quite sure what to make of
Amis' reductionist approach. A
Mailer partisan of my acquaint
ance described Amis' views on the
subject of "Stormin' Norman" as

being "monumentally clueless." so
take heed.
Amis does look at America
outside of its recent literature, to
be sure. Claus Von Bulow, Steven
Spielberg, Jerry Falwell and Gloria
Steinem — the whole range of cul
ture — they're all here. Amis is
wittily dismissive of Gay Talese
and Albert Goldman's biography
of Elvis Presley. He gets In some
good points at unexpected mo
ments. When discussing the films
of Brian De Palma ("Dressed to
Kill," "Scarface"), he writes, "Style
will always convince cinematic
purists that the surfaces they
admire contain depth, and that
clear shortcomings are really
subtle virtues in disguise." That
observation applies not only to De
Palma but to directors like Alfred
Hitchcock and Michael Mann as
well.
But he also offers tired revela
tions. He demolishes the institu

tion of Playboy not through any
shrill moralizing about pornogra
phy, but by letting the sheer
stupidity of the thing speak for it
yelf. But did anyone really think

Amis the es
sayist could
become as im
portant as Amis
the novelist.

that Hugh Hefner had anything to
say? Even more pointless is Amis'
trip to Palm Beach. Like every
thing else in the book, it's cleverly
written but here the cleverness
never amounts to much.
Moreover, as the book's title

implies, "Famous Amis" too often
lapses into an easy, tiresome sort
of America-bashing. A lot of the
qualities of the United States that
he looks down on with such prissy
disdain are strengths, not draw
backs. Granted, America may be
the most vulgar society on earth,
but it's also the most energetic,
certainly a relief from the self
destructing state of affairs In
Amis' native theme park.
Compared to America, England is
embalmed. Thus, the biggest sin
of "The Moronic Inferno" may be
one of omission. In picking
America as the sole object of its
critical focus, it (inadvertently)
suggests that other countries are
inherently better off, more sane,
more at ease with the world.
Only in his essay on AIDS does
Amis retain some of the urgency of
his novels. At last a note of con
cern can be heard in his perfectly
modulated voice. He presents the

expected statistics, research and
predictions, but what sets this es
say way above the usual paranoia
and hysteria surrounding AIDS is
that Amis makes the big step
which so few people are willing or
able to make, and comes to an un
derstanding of homosexuality.
"Homosexuality isn't a version of
heterosexuality. It is something
else again." This empathy is ne
cessary if AIDS is to be effectively
prevented, he argues. "AIDS vic
tims are in the forefront, at the
very pinnacle of human suffering.
Broadly speaking, they can do you
no harm unless you elect to go to
bed with them. We are in this to
gether now. An opportunity
presents itself. There is no good
reason — only a lot of bad ones —
why we shouldn't take it." These
lines suggest that Martin Amis the
essayist could become at least as
interesting and important a voice
as Martin Amis the novelist.
