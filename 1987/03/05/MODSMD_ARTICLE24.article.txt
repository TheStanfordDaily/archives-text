"The Moronic Inferno and Other
Visits to America"
By Martin Amis
New York: Viking Press, 1987

Who Is Martin Amis, and what
gives him the right to release a
book called "The Moronic Inferno
and Other Visits to America"?
Who the hell does he think he is?
Well, for everyone whose idea of a
talented young writer was Bret
Easton Ellis, welcome to Martin
Amis.
A few words about Amis:
Reading his biography, it strikes
you that his life seems so written.
No other young writer seems so
much like a literary conceit him
self. Known as "Britain's Brat of
Letters,"he is widely respected,
envied, gossiped about and
despised in British literary circles.
Gore Vidal calls him "that cute
little thing." Norman Mailer calls
him "that little shit." (Get crack
ing, creative writing majors! Some
day you too could be insulted by
Norman Mailer!)
Why all the attention? For one
thing, young Amis is the son of
Kingsley Amis (an eminent British
novelist, as you doubtless knew);
for another, he is the author of
five highly impressive novels him
self. I suppose I should mention
here that Martin Amis is my favor
ite novelist. There are five good
reasons for this.
Amis' first novel, "The Rachel
Papers" (1974), published when
he was just 24 years old, chron
icles the sexual misadventures of
a pimply literature student at Ox
ford — a character, it seems,
much like Martin Amis in his
formative years. Leaving aside the
queasy problem of reader identifi
cation, it must be said that "The
Rachel Papers" is a screamingly
funny look at the teenage mind,
with all its pretensions, evasions
and deceptions. And for all its
wistful moments, it's the only
Amis novel which can be thought
of as light-hearted. From then on,
the humor takes a sickening turn.
In Amis' next four books,
bruises lie throbbing under the
skin of each narrative. Lurking
beneath a bawdy, sarcastic
surface tone are the dark and ugly
undercurrents of modern life.
These come exploding to the fore
at the end of some novels, or, as in
the case of "Other People: A Mys
tery Story," they are left haunt
ingly unexplained. His unreliable
narrators seduce and betray their

audiences— this is what makes
the books so memorable. Amis'
voices are by turns, snide, witty,
vulgar, eloquent and even tragic
in a weird, eerie sort of way. Above
all else, though, his books are
savagely funny, or failing that,
just plain savage.
I mention all this because a
knowledge of Amis' already for
midable literary reputation is
helpful when reading "The
Moronic Inferno." "Inferno" is a
collection of essays dealing with
America, but the real meat of the
book lies in Amis' portraits of
American authors. He's not inter
ested in his own generation,
thank you — he goes after the

biggies, the grizzled old lions of
American letters."The Moronic
Inferno" should've been subtitled
"British Literary Punk Takes On
American Giants." Truman
Capote, Gore Vidal, Norman
Mailer, Kurt Vonnegut, Saul Bel
low, Philip Roth, John Updike —
the whole rogues' gallery is collec
ted here, all of them subjected to
the cold scalpel of Martin Amis'
wit.
The key to Amis' critical style is
that, rather than tackling or con
fronting the work of his subjects
head on. he instead whittles away
at their reputations. He takes off a
