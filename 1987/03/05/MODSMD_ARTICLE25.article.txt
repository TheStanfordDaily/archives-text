# Explosive Vietnam drama
## 
### JAMES DICKEY Editorial staff 
An explosion, a scream. Everything goes dark.
Slowly lights brighten to reveal the anguished
faces of the soldiers. Hearts race. The movement
and the shocks never stop. "Casualties" has
begun. Pandemonium and chaos reign.
The pace of Johnathan Greenberg's new play,
"Casualties," is as explosive as the machine-gun
fire of the soldiers he creates.
The work is a collage, a myriad display of emo
tions and actions. In keeping with its pace and
style, the play is set in both Vietnam and a U.S.
military courtroom at the same time.
The changes in action in the play occur without
any corresponding set changes. The only clues are
in the actions and dress of the characters as they
enter or simply make their presence known again.
The movement is non-stop, with few breaks as
obvious as a fade-out. Yet the cast does an excel
lent job of involving the audience in an un
pleasant subject at an unpleasant pace.
Shining in their performances of the Privates
"Haze" Van Hoesen and "Manchu" Johnson are
Bruce Burns and Michael McFall, respectively.
Burns is delightful as Haze, the drugged-out
private who escapes reality through faded
memories and the music of Jimi Hendrix. Burke's
appearance, movement and voice bring the part to
life remarkably well. McFali. on the other hand, is
assertive, challenging and threatening in the role
of Manchu, the young black soldier. He is brashly
captivating, the essence of a generation of angry
young men forced to waste their lives in a fight for
equality as well as freedom.
Manchu is the channel for most of Greenberg's

thoughts on the realities of racism and American
society. The rest of the thought-provoking ideas
are presented through Billy (Brian Crawley) and
Lt. James Willoughby (Marc Vlncenti).
Billy, as shown in the flashbacks, is the embodi
ment of innocence and youth. Greenberg uses
him to show the folly and danger inherent in expo
sure of innocent Americans to the harsh realities
of the world. On the other end of the scale is Wil
loughby. His character is hardened by time and
the burden of having the power of life and death
over so many people. Through him the playwright
shows the danger in having too much intelli
gence, and the corresponding ability to rationalize
any situation.
Vincenti, as the lieutenant, is frighteningly ef
fective in winning the sympathy of the audience,
drawing away from the reality of his actions.
Anthony Haney is quite believable in his role as
Lt. Colonel Robert Walker, a black career soldier.
Walker has rejoiced in the minute victories
against racism since he entered the army.
Through Manchu's conversations with him, the
audience is made to wonder how wise Walker is.
Yet, Walker is still the character that Greenberg
uses to remind the viewer of the few characteris
tics of humanity that differentiate humans from
animals.
The work in its entirety is a challenging piece,
both for the actors and the audience. The cast
does an admirable job of posing disturbing ques
tions, dimly cloaked.
Performed in the Burgess Theatre in Menlo
Park, "Casualties" is an excellent example of com
munity theatre, making wise use of minimal light
ing and set changes. The play will be performed
Friday and Saturday at 8 p.m.
