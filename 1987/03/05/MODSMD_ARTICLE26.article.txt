### JOSE BOWEN ADAM GROSSMAN 
This week's column has four sugges
tions that help demonstrate the range of
what most of us consider classical music.
These selections are part of the basic rep
ertoire and are easily accessible.

"The Planets"
Gustav Hoist, Sir Alexander Gibson and
the Scottish National Orchestra
The theme of this piece is based on
Hoist's Interest In astrology, as each
movement is named after a different
planet. This is exciting music â€” loaded
with dynamics and a great way to put
your compact disc player in gear. The
relentless marcato rhythm and prom
inent brass section in the first movement
may remind you of "Star Wars." Yet, "The
Planets" was written nearly three quar
ters of a century earlier. This piece serves
as a great introduction to varied or
chestral color and dynamic contrast.
Due to its popularity and spectacular
special effects, "The Planets" was one of
the first pieces to appear in several CD
versions (there are at least 24 recordings
of it. making it second only to Elgar's
"Enigma Variations" as the most re
corded piece of British music). "The

Planets" does show off the digital medium
at its best, but many of the early releases
were either analog recordings turned into
digital discs or poorly recorded digital at
tempts. Even more frustrating are some
of the new digital recordings with great
sound and mediocre performances, like
Andrew Davis' new recording for EMI with
the Toronto Symphony. We're a little dis
appointed with most of the recordings
we've heard, but new entries are unlikely
since the market is already flooded.
Though hotly debated, the von Karajan
version is a very satisfying and interest
ing performance. It is crisp and assertive.
Von Karajan is the conductor who ach

ieves the most velvetly texture and soft
ness of sound. Unfortunately, the record
ing emphasizes some of the potential
problems with this kind of reading; at
times the treble gets very harsh. In addi
tion, there are several glaring intonation
problems (the first horn entrance in
"Mars" is a disaster). For these reasons we
recommend Sir Alexander Gibson's per
formance with the Scottish National Or
chestra. Even though this is one of their
earlier digital recordings, it is still excel
lent. While a more traditional reading
than the von Karajan, it is still exciting
and well played. It will cost you $2 more,
but it is the safest bet. (All the recordings
of "The Planets" are about 50 minutes
long.)
"Rhapsody in Blue"
George Gershwin, Michael Tilson
Thomas and the Los Angeles Philhar
monic
Paul Whitman commissioned George

Gershwin to write a large-scale piece for
his Feb. 12, 1924 concert in New York
City's Aeolian Hall entitled "An Experi
ment in Modern Music." Gerswhin
originally intended the piece for Whit-
