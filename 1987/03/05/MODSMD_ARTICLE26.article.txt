### JOSE BOWEN ADAM GROSSMAN 
This week's column has four sugges
tions that help demonstrate the range of
what most of us consider classical music.
These selections are part of the basic rep
ertoire and are easily accessible.

"The Planets"
Gustav Hoist, Sir Alexander Gibson and
the Scottish National Orchestra
The theme of this piece is based on
Hoist's Interest In astrology, as each
movement is named after a different
planet. This is exciting music â€” loaded
with dynamics and a great way to put
your compact disc player in gear. The
relentless marcato rhythm and prom
inent brass section in the first movement
may remind you of "Star Wars." Yet, "The
Planets" was written nearly three quar
ters of a century earlier. This piece serves
as a great introduction to varied or
chestral color and dynamic contrast.
Due to its popularity and spectacular
special effects, "The Planets" was one of
the first pieces to appear in several CD
versions (there are at least 24 recordings
of it. making it second only to Elgar's
"Enigma Variations" as the most re
corded piece of British music). "The

Planets" does show off the digital medium
at its best, but many of the early releases
were either analog recordings turned into
digital discs or poorly recorded digital at
tempts. Even more frustrating are some
of the new digital recordings with great
sound and mediocre performances, like
Andrew Davis' new recording for EMI with
the Toronto Symphony. We're a little dis
appointed with most of the recordings
we've heard, but new entries are unlikely
since the market is already flooded.
Though hotly debated, the von Karajan
version is a very satisfying and interest
ing performance. It is crisp and assertive.
Von Karajan is the conductor who ach

ieves the most velvetly texture and soft
ness of sound. Unfortunately, the record
ing emphasizes some of the potential
problems with this kind of reading; at
times the treble gets very harsh. In addi
tion, there are several glaring intonation
problems (the first horn entrance in
"Mars" is a disaster). For these reasons we
recommend Sir Alexander Gibson's per
formance with the Scottish National Or
chestra. Even though this is one of their
earlier digital recordings, it is still excel
lent. While a more traditional reading
than the von Karajan, it is still exciting
and well played. It will cost you $2 more,
but it is the safest bet. (All the recordings
of "The Planets" are about 50 minutes
long.)
"Rhapsody in Blue"
George Gershwin, Michael Tilson
Thomas and the Los Angeles Philhar
monic
Paul Whitman commissioned George

Gershwin to write a large-scale piece for
his Feb. 12, 1924 concert in New York
City's Aeolian Hall entitled "An Experi
ment in Modern Music." Gerswhin
originally intended the piece for Whit-


man's Jazz band and piano but It
was Ferde Grofe who did the ac
tual orchestration from
Gershwin's two-piano score for
the premiere. As its popularity
grew, Grofe reorchestrated the
piece two more times. It Is his
third version for full orchestra
that we hear most often today.
Michael Tilson Thomas Is the
first to rerecord the original ver
sion, and it Is by far the recording
of choice. Both the playing and re
cording are superb and the
original version has a freshness
that is missing In the others.
There is also lots of other interest
ing Gershwin on this disc (54
minutes total), including the
"Preludes for Piano" and "Second
Rhapsody." (If you really want the
full orchestral version, then we
suggest the Andre Previn record
ing with the Pittsburgh Sym
phony Orchestra. It is acceptable
in terms of recording and perfor
mance and has, in addition to the
"Rhapsody," the "Piano Concerto
in F" and "An American in Paris"
[64 minutes total].)
"String Quartets
OP. 76 NOS. 4 & 6"
Franz Joseph Haydn, The Or
lando Quartet
Franz Joseph Haydn was the
father of the classical string quar
tet, and is therefore a logical place
to start a chamber music collec
tion. The opus 76 quartets were
written in 1797, during the last
part of Haydn's life. The opus 76
No. 4 is called the "Sunrise" quar
tet because the tonal affect in the
beginning depicts a peaceful
sunrise.
This is the sort of music that
people think of when they say that
classical music is relaxing; It pro
vides a striking contrast to "The
Planets." Listen closely to the
beginning of each movement; that
is where the theme is presented.
Although there are several good
recordings of the "Sunrise" quar

tet. this one is very well recorded
and played and also Includes the
opus 76 NO. 6. The Orlando Quar
tet plays with enthusiasm and elo
quence.
"Jascha Heifitz: Beethoven
Violin Concerto in D"
Charles Munch and the Boston
Symphony Orchestra
"Brahms Violin Concerto in D"
Fritz Reiner and the Chicago
Symphony Orchestra

This CD is easy to recommend.
Heifitz is certainly one of the
greatest vituoso violinists ever.
After first hearing Heifitz perform,
Toscanini said. "I nearly lost my
mind." A recording of this
violinist playing either the Beetho
ven or the Brahms "Violin Con
certos" would be a worthwhile in
vestment; but having both con
certos on one CD makes it an ex
ceptional bargain. Heifitz' faster
tempos make it possible to fit both
works on one CD, but even still, it
is quite lengthy (72 minutes).
Only a master such as Heifitz
could play these concertos this
fast with enough facility and im
agination to bring out every detail.
RCA has done a great job of
transferring these recordings to
CD. Although Heifitz still sounds
a little close to the microphone,
the digital versions are much bet
ter than the old records. Despite
the fact that they are not digital
masters, the sonics are very good
and a pleasure to listen to. A great
way to hear a great violinist.
