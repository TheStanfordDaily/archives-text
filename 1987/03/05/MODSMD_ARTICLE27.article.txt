# Three O'Clock: Alive and ticking
## 
### ROB REID 
Michael Quercio was only 17
years old and still In high school
when his first single was
released. Now, five years and five
albums later, he's a seasoned,
confident and somewhat cynical
performer. He and his band, the
Three O'Clock, played for a
packed house at Wolfgang's two
weeks ago in their first Bay Area
appearance since the January
release of their new album "Ever
After."
Although many people are just
discovering it now. the Three
O'Clock has been a widely fol
lowed band in the Los Angeles
area for years. It was one of the
leading bands in the city's
"Paisley Underground" three
years ago. a movement that
produced bands like the Bangles
and the Dream Syndicate. When
asked about the Paisley Under
ground today, singer/bassist
Quercio said: "I don't know, it
just keeps going further and fur
ther underground. I can't even
find it anymore."
The group's general attitude
seems to be that it's fun and ex
citing to be local cult heroes with
garage-band ethics, but after a
while it's either time to move on
in life or make a little money.
Drummer Danny Benair said it
best: "Being a 'college-oriented'
band is nice, but it's not the end
all: you can't make very much
money. The day we started I
wanted to go to a higher level.
"I'm only a human being. I
want to be able to have a nice
house with a white picket fence
and be happy. It's difficult if you
play gigs and you put out more
for your crew, your accountants,
your management and your
agents, and when you get done,
that's all very important, but you
haven't made anything. But if
you elevate to a different level,
you're making some money and
everybody's happy."

The band was clearly happy
with the San Francisco crowd at
Its recent Wolfgang's perfor
mance. Keyboard player Mike
Mariano called San Francisco
"our second home" after Los An
geles. Quercio added that he
sometimes likes playing in San
Francisco even more than L.A.
The group played a set that was
well-balanced between their
older and newer songs, drawing
almost equally from all of their
albums.
The Three O'Clock is re
emerging onto the music scene;
"Ever After" is their first album
in over a year and a half. Record
company delays and the replace

ment of their guitarist ac
counted for the long wait. The
band's last extended tour was a
six-week stint with R.E.M. in the
summer of 1985. Their future
plans are still not solid, but
manager John Silva said there's
a good chance the band will tour
with Squeeze this spring.
The long hiatus between al
bums has resulted in some
changes in the band's style and
attitude. "Ever After" is their
most polished and mainstream
album yet, and will probably
prove to be their most commer
cially successful. The more ac
cessible new sound may be due
in part to the album's produc

tion team: It was engineered by
lan Taylor, who has worked with
the Cars and Echo and the Bun
nymen.
The album's upbeat pop sound
isn't so dramatically different
from the group's earlier work
that it will alienate its older fans.
If anything, it's a more mature
and professional approach to the
band's basic style. The first
single. "Suzie's on the Ball Now,"
is already receiving heavy airplay
on college and progressive radio
stations.
All of the band members are
satisfied with the new album
and Quercio thinks it's their best
work.
