## A 						tennis first: Cal beats Card women 
### KEN STEVENS Editorial staff 
For the first time ever, the Bears of Cali
fornia were Indeed golden while playing the
Stanford women's tennis team.
After splitting the six singles matches,
Cal captured two of three doubles matches
to break an agonizing losing streak by a 5-4
score yesterday at the Stanford Tennis
Stadium. The Bears are now 9-0 overall and
3-0 in the Pacific 10 Conference. The Card
inal dropped to 7-2 and 2-2.
Cal's golden effort left Stanford feeling
about as dreary as the weather, which con
sisted of light rain that forced two short
stoppages in action and generally overcast
skies that threatened to make the courts
too dark to play on.
The forecast was gloomy for the Cardinal
even before the match started. Junior Kay
Tittle, Stanford's No. 3 singles player and a
member of the No. 2 doubles team, came
down with the flu Tuesday and was forced
to join Injured teammates Leigh Anne
Eldredge and Eleni Rossides as a spectator.
Stanford Coach Frank Brennan said that

Tittle's absence dealt a blow to the Cardinal
that it could not recover from. "1 think we
were a little he said. "In ten
nis. it (losing a player) is critical, because
everybody moves up a notch."
Brennan praised the Bears for seizing the
opportunity. "My hat's off to them. Cal
comes in saying, 'We're in the ballpark,' and
they are," he said. "Cal played well. 1 don't
want to sound like we would have won if
Kay was in there."
On a day when one long winning streak
was broken, another remained intact as
Patty Fendick annihilated Karen Shin 6-0,
6-1 in No. 1 singles to extend her string to
35 consecutive college victories.
Shin's forehand was as cold as the air yes
terday. Unable to find any rhythm, she
resorted to topspin shots, which Fendick
repeatedly pounded for winners. Shin's
only reprieve came in the second set, when
the match was delayed by rain. Ten
minutes later, however, play resumed and
Fendick quickly put an end to the mis
match.


With just Cari Hagey's match remaining in yesterday's singles play against California, the Cardinal was leading 3-2. Hagey
fell to Alissa Finerman 6-3, 3-6, 7-5 to tie the team score at 3-3. The Bears then took two out of three doubles matches and
beat Stanford 5-4.
Stanford freshman Lisa Green
added to a mini-streak of her own
yesterday, winning for the ninth
time In as many matches this
season. Green was pitted in the
No. 3 singles against Cal's Sharon
Fletcher, who was content to sit at
the baseline for most of the
match.
The strategy was successful for
part of the first set as Green's ag
gressive style led to some errant
shots. But as soon as Green
started clicking. Fletcher was
forced to watch shots fly past her.
The result was a 6-4, 6-4 Green
victoiy that gave the Cardinal a 2-
0 lead.
Caroline Scherman got Cal on
the scoreboard with a 6-4, 6-4 vic
tory of her own over Stanford

freshman Valerie Wilson In the
No. 5 singles match. "Valerie
didn't really play up to snuff,"
Brennan said. "She was a little
confused on how to play the girl.
I've seen Valerie play better."
The Bears tied the score at 2-2
with the first of their two three-set
victories as Mary Margaret Torres
knocked off sophomore Cindy
Buchsbaum 6-3, 3-6, 6-2 In the
No. 6 singles. Buchsbaum was
playing In place of Tittle.
Moments later, the Cardinal
regained the lead as senior Steph
anie Savides finished off Cal's
Linda Oechsle 6-1. 7-5 in the No. 2
singles match.
The remaining singles match
between Stanford's Cari Hagey
and Cal's Alissa Finerman became
critical. A Hagey win would give
the Cardinal an almost Insur
mountable 4-2 lead, but a Finer
man victory would even the
match.

As the spectators drifted over to
the No. 4 court. Flnerman had the
ujper hand, leading 4-1 in the
third set. Hagey then won the next
two games to edge within 4-3. but
Flnerman responded by breaking
Hagey's serve to go up 5-3.
Hagey did not back off. though,
as she continued to hit topspin
shots from the backcourt until
she had the opportunity to attack
short balls and come to the net.
Hagey broke Finerman's serve and
then won a love game on her own
serve to tie the score at 5-5.
Flnerman turned the tables,
however, holding her serve and
then going up 3-1 on Hagey's
serve. Hagey used a couple of big
serves to win the next two points,
but on the all-important 3-all
point, Flnerman put away a volley
to take the match 6-3, 3-6, 7-5.
"Carl played well," Brennan
said. "She feels bad and feels like
she lost it (the team match). She

shouldn't feel that way."
In fact, Stanford lost the match
in the doubles. Or more ac
curately, Cal won it in doubles.
Fendick and Savides gave the
Cardinal its final lead of the day.

For the first time ever, the Bears of Cali
fornia were Indeed golden while playing the
Stanford women's tennis team.
After splitting the six singles matches,
Cal captured two of three doubles matches
to break an agonizing losing streak by a 5-4
score yesterday at the Stanford Tennis
Stadium. The Bears are now 9-0 overall and
3-0 in the Pacific 10 Conference. The Card
inal dropped to 7-2 and 2-2.
Cal's golden effort left Stanford feeling
about as dreary as the weather, which con
sisted of light rain that forced two short
stoppages in action and generally overcast
skies that threatened to make the courts
too dark to play on.
The forecast was gloomy for the Cardinal
even before the match started. Junior Kay
Tittle, Stanford's No. 3 singles player and a
member of the No. 2 doubles team, came
down with the flu Tuesday and was forced
to join Injured teammates Leigh Anne
Eldredge and Eleni Rossides as a spectator.
Stanford Coach Frank Brennan said that

Tittle's absence dealt a blow to the Cardinal
that it could not recover from. "1 think we
were a little he said. "In ten
nis. it (losing a player) is critical, because
everybody moves up a notch."
Brennan praised the Bears for seizing the
opportunity. "My hat's off to them. Cal
comes in saying, 'We're in the ballpark,' and
they are," he said. "Cal played well. 1 don't
want to sound like we would have won if
Kay was in there."
On a day when one long winning streak
was broken, another remained intact as
Patty Fendick annihilated Karen Shin 6-0,
6-1 in No. 1 singles to extend her string to
35 consecutive college victories.
Shin's forehand was as cold as the air yes
terday. Unable to find any rhythm, she
resorted to topspin shots, which Fendick
repeatedly pounded for winners. Shin's
only reprieve came in the second set, when
the match was delayed by rain. Ten
minutes later, however, play resumed and
Fendick quickly put an end to the mis
match.

beat Stanford 5-4.

added to a mini-streak of her own
yesterday, winning for the ninth

Fletcher, who was content to sit at
the baseline for most of the
match.

part of the first set as Green's ag
gressive style led to some errant
shots. But as soon as Green

forced to watch shots fly past her.

victoiy that gave the Cardinal a 2-
0 lead.

the scoreboard with a 6-4, 6-4 vic
tory of her own over Stanford

freshman Valerie Wilson In the
No. 5 singles match. "Valerie
didn't really play up to snuff,"

confused on how to play the girl.
I've seen Valerie play better."

with the first of their two three-set
victories as Mary Margaret Torres

between Stanford's Cari Hagey
and Cal's Alissa Finerman became

mountable 4-2 lead, but a Finer
man victory would even the
match.

As the spectators drifted over to
the No. 4 court. Flnerman had the
ujper hand, leading 4-1 in the
third set. Hagey then won the next
two games to edge within 4-3. but

then won a love game on her own
serve to tie the score at 5-5.

serve. Hagey used a couple of big
serves to win the next two points,
but on the all-important 3-all
point, Flnerman put away a volley
to take the match 6-3, 3-6, 7-5.

said. "She feels bad and feels like
she lost it (the team match). She

shouldn't feel that way."
