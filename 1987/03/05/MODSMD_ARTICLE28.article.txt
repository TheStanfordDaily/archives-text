						tennis first: Cal beats Card women 
### KEN STEVENS Editorial staff 
For the first time ever, the Bears of Cali
fornia were Indeed golden while playing the
Stanford women's tennis team.
After splitting the six singles matches,
Cal captured two of three doubles matches
to break an agonizing losing streak by a 5-4
score yesterday at the Stanford Tennis
Stadium. The Bears are now 9-0 overall and
3-0 in the Pacific 10 Conference. The Card
inal dropped to 7-2 and 2-2.
Cal's golden effort left Stanford feeling
about as dreary as the weather, which con
sisted of light rain that forced two short
stoppages in action and generally overcast
skies that threatened to make the courts
too dark to play on.
The forecast was gloomy for the Cardinal
even before the match started. Junior Kay
Tittle, Stanford's No. 3 singles player and a
member of the No. 2 doubles team, came
down with the flu Tuesday and was forced
to join Injured teammates Leigh Anne
Eldredge and Eleni Rossides as a spectator.
Stanford Coach Frank Brennan said that

Tittle's absence dealt a blow to the Cardinal
that it could not recover from. "1 think we
were a little he said. "In ten
nis. it (losing a player) is critical, because
everybody moves up a notch."
Brennan praised the Bears for seizing the
opportunity. "My hat's off to them. Cal
comes in saying, 'We're in the ballpark,' and
they are," he said. "Cal played well. 1 don't
want to sound like we would have won if
Kay was in there."
On a day when one long winning streak
was broken, another remained intact as
Patty Fendick annihilated Karen Shin 6-0,
6-1 in No. 1 singles to extend her string to
35 consecutive college victories.
Shin's forehand was as cold as the air yes
terday. Unable to find any rhythm, she
resorted to topspin shots, which Fendick
repeatedly pounded for winners. Shin's
only reprieve came in the second set, when
the match was delayed by rain. Ten
minutes later, however, play resumed and
Fendick quickly put an end to the mis
match.


With just Cari Hagey's match remaining in yesterday's singles play against California, the Cardinal was leading 3-2. Hagey
fell to Alissa Finerman 6-3, 3-6, 7-5 to tie the team score at 3-3. The Bears then took two out of three doubles matches and
beat Stanford 5-4.
