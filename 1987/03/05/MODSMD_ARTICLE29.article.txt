# Women hope to upset Ducks
## 
### EVAN TUCHINSKY Staff writer 
Though history tends to
repeat itself, the Stanford
women's basketball team will
enter its game against Oregon at
7:30 p.m. in Maples Pavilion
with upset on its mind.
The Cardinal, seventh in the
Pacific 10 Conference, comes off
of a split this past weekend in
Arizona to face Oregon, which is
tied for for first in the Pac-10
with Washington and (JSC. In
the teams' last meeting in
Eugene, Ore., the Ducks
prevailed by a 14 point margin,
65-51.
"I think they're an excellent

team," Stanford Coach Tara
VanDerveer said. "They've won
10 games in a row and they're
playing very well."
Tonight's matchup, however,
will hardly be a rout. "We played
them pretty even up there for
the first 35 minutes," VanDer
veer recalled. "We got in bad foul
trouble . . . and missed a lot on
the break."
"It's going to take outstanding
team effort," she added.
Leading the Cardinal attack
will be Pac-10 All-Newcomer
team members Jennifer Azzi
and Katy Steding. Steding. a for
ward, is fifth on the list of Stan
ford single-season rebounding
leaders with 223 and third in

rebounding average at 8.6 per
game.
Azzi, however, is the big story.
The guard is currently tied for
the Stanford single season as
sist record at 151, a standard
she will certainly shatter
tonight.
Junior forward Kami Ander
son, named as an honorable
mention on the All-Conference
team, should also prove to be a
potent weapon in the Duck
hunt.
The Cardinal will have to
muster a lot of artillery, because
"with a front line of 6-3, 6-5 and
6-7, they (Oregon) take up a lot
of space and force you outside,"
VanDerveer concluded.
