# Hewlett grant to fund population studies
## 
### DAVID LIPPEATT Editorial staff 
The University's new Institute
for Population and Resource
Studies has received a two-year,
>150,000 grant from the William
and Flora Hewlett Foundation, ac
cording to Marcus Feldman, the
institute's director.
Biology Prof. Feldman said the
money will be used to aid foreign
graduate students who wish to
study in the field at Stanford and
to organize workshops on fertility
control and the relationship be

tween population growth and en
vironmental deterioration.
"We're particularly interested In
foreign students," Feldman said.
Future policy-makers in Third
World countries will need both a
broad perspective and specific
technical skills in order to deal ef
fectively with the massive popula
tion problems they will face,
Feldman said, adding that the in
stitute will attempt to provide
some of these answers.
The grant is the Institute's first
non-University funding since its

formation last September, Feld
man said.
The Hewlett Foundation has
long been interested in Issues of
population and environment and
made the grant "to encourage so
cial science research and training
in the area of population in less
developed countries," Feldman
said. The foundation is also in
terested in promoting "the inte
gration of environmental research
into population policy research,"
Feldman said.
The Stanford Institute focuses
on these kinds of issues, Feldman

explained. "We're not just inter
ested in promoting birth control.
We stress the interaction of eco
nomic, natural resource and pop
ulation policies" in a given region
of the world, he said.
Unlike most population studies
institutes, one of the Stanford in
stitute's main purposes is to bring
together faculty from separate dis
ciplines, Feldman said. The De
partments of Anthropology. Bio
logical Sciences, Economics, Ge
netics, Human Biology, Mathema-
tics and Sociology, and the Food
Research Institute all offer
courses on some aspect of popula
tion studies.
"These different groups should
be talking to one another and
reconciling their goals." Feldman
said.

"We want to integrate these
studies into a much broader
framework," he added. "Nowhere
else in this country is such a wide
spectrum (of disciplines) re
presented" in a population studies
program.
The institute is working to
"raise (public) consciousness of
population and resource issues,"
according demographer Brian Ar
thur, a professor at the Food Re
search Insititute. "It's easy to lose

sight of these issues when faced
with more immediate problems"
such as arms control, Arthur said.
But in the long run, population
problems "are some of the major
issues of our time," he concluded.
Feldman is currently the direc
tor of the institute's executive
committee, which also includes
Arthur, Davis, John, Chemistry
Prof. Carl Djerassi, Biology Prof.
Paul Ehrlich and Anthropology
Prof. William Durham.
