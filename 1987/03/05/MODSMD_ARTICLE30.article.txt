# Stanford sailors find success in San Francisco, San Diego
## 
### HUGH R. BETHELL Editorial staff 
Simultaneous regattas in San Francisco and San
Diego left the Stanford sailing team fighting a two
front battle for West Coast sailing supremacy this
past weekend, but even divided, the Cardinal
managed to emerge victorious.
For the Cardinal squad competing on Lake
Merced, California was the primary enemy. Of the 20
boats racing in the third and fourth matches of the
Northern California Intercollegiate Racing Series, six
came from Cal and only one came from Stanford.
Still, that one Cardinal boat — sailed by senior
Tom Kuhnle and sophomore Rita Snape in the A Di
vision, and by junior Doug Hagen and senior Kari
Skilbred in the B Division — managed to take second
place on Saturday and first place on Sunday, in a
performance that Stanford sailing coach Blake Mid
dleton labeled "very impressive."
Meanwhile, another group of CardinaKsailors was
battling a more varied field of opponents on Mission
Bay, and was meeting with similar success. The var
sity teams of juniors Dan Buckstaff and Kathleen
Mallery, and junior Drew Gashler and senior Kristen
Boyles took first place on Saturday and third place
on Sunday to complete the weekend's achievement.
The sailing team chose to divide itself over the
weekend so that it could compete against both
Northern and Southern California schools before
departing on an East Coast tour. Middleton said.
The East Coast regattas will be crucial in determin
ing the Cardinal's national ranking.
In the north, the overwhelming Cal presence made
for a real challenge to the lone Stanford boat.

"If we could get away from Cal, we could usually
win the race. The trouble was, it was hard to get
away from them all. With the addition of two new
transfers. Cal is a great deal stronger now. They may
be a real force at the district championships in the
spring," Middleton said.
In order to beat Cal. Stanford relied on strong crew
work.
"Both Rita and Kari are relatively new to the team,
but both of them did an exceptional job. Their contri
bution really made the difference," Middleton said.
In San Diego, the Cardinal wasn't plagued by an
other team, but by its own occasional inconsistency.
"Consistency was a real problem for us. In some
races we showed greatness, and in some we showed
ghastliness," Boyles said.
"It was difficult to be consistent both because of
the light winds and because there wasn't much
respect for the rules. All the contact between boats
made it a real 'Cap'n Crunch' regatta." Buckstaff
said.
In the Junior Varisty Division of the Southern se
ries, Cardinal freshmen Robert Brown and A 1 Sar
gent, sophomores Karen Holland Amy Baltzer and
junior Jen Brokaw had similar problems with con
sistency, but managed a third-place overall finish
nonetheless.
The next time the Cardinal will meet Southern Cal
ifornia schools will be at the district championships
this spring. At that time. Cardinal sailors say. the
Southern schools will be even weaker without the
home water advantage.
"When they come up north for districts, those
light-wind sailors will fall apart at our feet." Buck
staff said.
