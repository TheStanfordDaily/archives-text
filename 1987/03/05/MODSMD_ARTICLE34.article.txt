# Journalist tells of Afghanistan

### SUHA JHAVERI Staff writer 
Journalist Larry Greenfield said last night that the
United States should provide aid to guerrilla war
riors battling the Soviet army in Afghanistan.
Greenfield, who has spent time in Afghanistan,
spoke In Branner Hall on the state of Afghanistan
since the Soviet invasion in a program called "Inside
Afghanistan: A Soviet Vietnam?"
"It hasn't been a very fair fight," Greenfield said,
noting that the Afghanistan freedom fighters have
neither alrcrafts nor advanced ammunition to battle
the 120,000 well-armed Soviet troops in Afghani
stan.
"The least we (the United States) can do is help fi
nancially with more aid and more technology," said
Greenfield. "They want our help and if we do it we'll
be heroes to them."
Greenfield blamed the American public's ignor
ance about Afghanistan's situation on poor press
coverage. "The freedom fighters have responded
more vigorously than any group since 1917," he
said. "The least we can do is understand their
struggle.
"They are a poor people. . . . They just want their
country back."
Greenfield began the speech with slides he had
compiled during his one-week stay in Afghanistan

and two-week stay in Pakistan. He called Afghani
stan "an important country that we don't know
much about."
He also explored possible reasons for the Soviet in
vasion of Afghanistan.
"First of all, the Soviets worry about the Muslims,"
he said. "They serve as a base for revolt." Greenfield
also cited physical and strategic reasons, such as
warm-water ports and oil fields.
Greenfield stressed the inhumanity of numerous
weapons used by the Soviets, specifically the butter
fly bomb. He explained that this bomb, camouflaged
most typically in the shape of a butterfly, was created
to maim children. Children, thinking the bomb is a
butterfly, pick it up and it instantly explodes.
Although Soviets deny the use of this weapon,
Greenfield managed to smuggle a detonated bomb
out of Afghanistan. He showed the bomb to the audi
ence, as well as pictures of victimized children.
Greenfield compared the Soviet presence in Af
ghanistan to the United States' invasion of Vietnam.
"It would strike me as absurd that after Vietnam we
would keep our mouths shut over human rights." he
said.
If the Afgan rebels win, Greenfield anticipates two
possible outcomes: the creation of a national Islamic
state, like Pakistan, or a fundamentalist Islamic
republic that would "not be too fond of the Western
world."
