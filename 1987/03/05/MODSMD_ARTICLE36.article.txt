My name is Michele; I'm an alcoholic and a
Stanford student. I remind myself daily of this
in the meetings I attend to help keep my disease
in remission. The name of my disease is alco
holism. It can be a fatal disease unless I keep it
' in check by not drinking. It's that simple. It's
that difficult. It is also a disease I will have for life. I will never
not be an alcoholic. The word alcoholic implies many things
about me. Perhaps I can clarify those implications by telling you
about my experience.
My mother is an alcoholic also. She started drinking
heavily when I was seven, and she continued that pattern for three
years. When I was ten, she entered a recovery program, and has
been sober ever since. Some of you may know what it is like to
want to disappear into the walls, or vanish under the dresser.
Some have acquired the ability to change your behavior according
to the state of your mother or father within the first seconds of
interacting with them. These thoughts and behaviors were a part

Michele Mikules
of my everyday life for those three
years.
Children of alcoholics learn to play
different roles. Many times my
father would leave when my mom's
drinking was heavy. I was the
oldest, and I learned to be the
caretaker. I made sure that my
younger brother was fed and got to
school on time, I cleaned the house
and made all necessary excuses. 1
wanted to make sure that no one
knew what was really going on in
my family. I wanted to make sure
that no one knew what was really
going on inside of me.
The range of emotions I felt during
this period is incredible. Sometimes
I wanted to disappear. Sometimes I
needed to be actively involved in the
maintenance of the household.
Sometimes, I would sneak into my
mother's bedroom where she would
be passed out on the bed and I would
listen for her breathing. I thought
she might die and leave me,
although in a way she already had.
Some days of course were better than
other, especially those days when
my mother would promise never to
drink again. This promise was made
and broken more than once, but each
time, I believed it with all the hope
in the world. I understand now that
the nature of the disease is such thai
our greatest efforts and the strongest
"willpower" cannot guarantee
sobriety. I never knew when she'd
be drunk again, so I lived my life
ready to switch into the "don't feel,
just do" mode.
My mom entered a six week
recovery program when I was ten.
This was probably the hardest part
for me, or at least the part I
remember most vividly. I lived with
my grandparents and attended a
strange school in a different state. I
felt alone and afraid, and yet I refused
to acknowledge any of my pain.
She began the recovery process at
that time and has not had a drink
since. I am grateful today that my
mother is an alcoholic because when
it got bad for me, I knew what I had
to do.
"It will never happen to me" is a
phrase that I said many times. But
it did. My drinking career began
when I was twelve. I knew that
alcohol had made my mom feel
different I knew it allowed her to
escape. I wanted to escape. I wanted
to feel anything but what I was
feeling. So, I tried it. I drank a
glass of scotch from the liquor
cabinet. I drank it alone. Although
I didn't like the taste and it made me
ill, something about the effects

intrigued me.
I drank through high school, at
parties and with friends. The friends
I chose liked to drink, and getting
drunk was just part of our social
excursions. The amount I drank was
never questioned and the frequency
was not great enough to attract
attention.

"It will never
happen to
me" is a
phrase that
I said many
times.

When I came to Stanford, like many,
I felt out of place. I didn't feel smart
enough, thin enough, pretty enough,
good enough to be here. I
immediately bought into the
"Stanford myth" that this is a
wonderful place, and if you are
unhappy or uncomfortable, there is
something wrong with you. I
wasn't happy.
Drinking at parties helped to
alleviate some of the uneasy,
unhappy feelings. When I drank, I
was able to interact, to flirt, to be
accepted, or so I thought. I used
alcohol as a "social lubricant" for
almost three years. It was easy to
continue this pattern of heavy
drinking on the weekends because
weekend binging is prevalent and
accepted as part of normal college
life. Stanford is no different in that
regard. I used to say that people at
Stanford work hard so they can play
hard. I needed any excuse to drink
heavily.
Sometimes, my thoughts would
wander back to my mom and her
alcoholism. At some level, I knew
that I drank abnormally. I was able
to justify to myself that T was
different from her, after all, I drank
socially, she drank alone. I know
now that one aspect of the disease
that virtually all acoholics share is
denial. We find ways to hide from
the obvious destruction we are doing
to ourselves in order to continue to
drink.
I think it is important to mention
that I probably didn't act any
differently than other people at
parties. In fact, I prided myself on
my ability to maintain my
composure. The difference between
me and another drinker at a party
were my motives for drinking and

my feelings about it I drank to get
drunk. I drank to feel different, and I
didn't stop after one or two -although
I always wanted to stop.
I was never really held accountable
for the damage the disease was doing
in my life, and so the drinking
continued. My grades didn't slip,
although I lost time from class
and studying due to drinking.
I never blacked out or had
lapses of memory, although many
alcoholics do. I was never arrested
for drunk driving, although many
times I could have been. No one
ever said to me, "Michele, I'm
worried about your drinking" and
who knows what would have
happened if they had. It is very
easy, especially in college (yes, even
at Stanford) to deny that you may
have a problem with alcohol.
People are accepting of drunken
behavior, when perhaps they
shouldn't be. The "Stanford
myth"makes it difficult for people to
accept that they are unhappy about
anything. For me, it took an event
where my drinking had ramifications
to force me to accept that I had a
problem.
It was my friend's twenty-first
birthday. I was pulled over and
given a sobriety test, and somehow I
passed. I was cited for having an
open container and being under age
to possess alcohol. I lost my
license for thirty days. That was it
I had had enough.
I was fortunate enough to live in
Robinson in Sterling Quad, where
Ken Fields and Nora Cain are
Resident Fellows. Ken is a
recovering alcoholic and Nora is a
recovering co-dependent They had
mentioned at the first house meeting
that we could talk to him if we
wanted to know about the disease
any time. I took up their invitation
after the evening I was pulled over,
hoping at some level they would tell
me I had made a big mistake and that
my drinking was normal for a
college student. They didn't tell me
that. Ken invited me to attend a
meeting of his recovery program. I
went - today I am a different person
because of it
My life has changed in the past year.
My perspective about happiness,
about mental health, about Stanford,
about life has been reversed. I've
learned that I play a role in
everything I feel. If I want to live a
happy, sober life, I can with the help
of my recovery program and a
spiritual foundation. It's not a
religious program, but for me,
spirituality is fundamental to the
maintenance of sobriety.

I have learned about myself, about
my mom, and about alcoholism, the
disease we share. I no longer have
the desire to drink, at least not for
today. I don't know about
tomorrow, but for today, I'm sober
and am getting more mentally
healthy through the process of
recovery.

where my drinking had ramifications
to force me to accept that I had a
problem.
It was my friend's twenty-first
birthday. I was pulled over and
given a sobriety test, and somehow I
passed. I was cited for having an
open container and being under age
to possess alcohol. I lost my
license for thirty days. That was it
I had had enough.
I was fortunate enough to live in
Robinson in Sterling Quad, where
Ken Fields and Nora Cain are
Resident Fellows. Ken is a
recovering alcoholic and Nora is a
recovering co-dependent They had
mentioned at the first house meeting
that we could talk to him if we
wanted to know about the disease
any time. I took up their invitation
after the evening I was pulled over,
hoping at some level they would tell
me I had made a big mistake and that
my drinking was normal for a
college student. They didn't tell me
that. Ken invited me to attend a
meeting of his recovery program. I
went - today I am a different person
because of it
My life has changed in the past year.
My perspective about happiness,
about mental health, about Stanford,
about life has been reversed. I've
learned that I play a role in
everything I feel. If I want to live a
happy, sober life, I can with the help
of my recovery program and a
spiritual foundation. It's not a
religious program, but for me,
spirituality is fundamental to the
maintenance of sobriety.

I have learned about myself, about
my mom, and about alcoholism, the
disease we share. I no longer have
the desire to drink, at least not for
today. I don't know about
tomorrow, but for today, I'm sober
and am getting more mentally
healthy through the process of
recovery.

My name is Michele; I'm an alcoholic and a
Stanford student. I remind myself daily of this
in the meetings I attend to help keep my disease
in remission. The name of my disease is alco
holism. It can be a fatal disease unless I keep it
' in check by not drinking. It's that simple. It's
that difficult. It is also a disease I will have for life. I will never
not be an alcoholic. The word alcoholic implies many things
about me. Perhaps I can clarify those implications by telling you
about my experience.
My mother is an alcoholic also. She started drinking
heavily when I was seven, and she continued that pattern for three
years. When I was ten, she entered a recovery program, and has
been sober ever since. Some of you may know what it is like to
want to disappear into the walls, or vanish under the dresser.
Some have acquired the ability to change your behavior according
to the state of your mother or father within the first seconds of
interacting with them. These thoughts and behaviors were a part

Michele Mikules
of my everyday life for those three
years.
Children of alcoholics learn to play
different roles. Many times my
father would leave when my mom's
drinking was heavy. I was the
oldest, and I learned to be the
caretaker. I made sure that my
younger brother was fed and got to
school on time, I cleaned the house
and made all necessary excuses. 1
wanted to make sure that no one
knew what was really going on in
my family. I wanted to make sure
that no one knew what was really
going on inside of me.
The range of emotions I felt during
this period is incredible. Sometimes
I wanted to disappear. Sometimes I
needed to be actively involved in the
maintenance of the household.
Sometimes, I would sneak into my
mother's bedroom where she would
be passed out on the bed and I would
listen for her breathing. I thought
she might die and leave me,
although in a way she already had.
Some days of course were better than
other, especially those days when
my mother would promise never to
drink again. This promise was made
and broken more than once, but each
time, I believed it with all the hope
in the world. I understand now that
the nature of the disease is such thai
our greatest efforts and the strongest
"willpower" cannot guarantee
sobriety. I never knew when she'd
be drunk again, so I lived my life
ready to switch into the "don't feel,
just do" mode.
My mom entered a six week
recovery program when I was ten.
This was probably the hardest part
for me, or at least the part I
remember most vividly. I lived with
my grandparents and attended a
strange school in a different state. I
felt alone and afraid, and yet I refused
to acknowledge any of my pain.
She began the recovery process at
that time and has not had a drink
since. I am grateful today that my
mother is an alcoholic because when
it got bad for me, I knew what I had
to do.
"It will never happen to me" is a
phrase that I said many times. But
it did. My drinking career began
when I was twelve. I knew that
alcohol had made my mom feel
different I knew it allowed her to
escape. I wanted to escape. I wanted
to feel anything but what I was
feeling. So, I tried it. I drank a
glass of scotch from the liquor
cabinet. I drank it alone. Although
I didn't like the taste and it made me
ill, something about the effects

intrigued me.
I drank through high school, at
parties and with friends. The friends
I chose liked to drink, and getting
drunk was just part of our social
excursions. The amount I drank was
never questioned and the frequency
was not great enough to attract
attention.

"It will never
happen to
me" is a
phrase that
I said many
times.

When I came to Stanford, like many,
I felt out of place. I didn't feel smart
enough, thin enough, pretty enough,
good enough to be here. I
immediately bought into the
"Stanford myth" that this is a
wonderful place, and if you are
unhappy or uncomfortable, there is
something wrong with you. I
wasn't happy.
Drinking at parties helped to
alleviate some of the uneasy,
unhappy feelings. When I drank, I
was able to interact, to flirt, to be
accepted, or so I thought. I used
alcohol as a "social lubricant" for
almost three years. It was easy to
continue this pattern of heavy
drinking on the weekends because
weekend binging is prevalent and
accepted as part of normal college
life. Stanford is no different in that
regard. I used to say that people at
Stanford work hard so they can play
hard. I needed any excuse to drink
heavily.
Sometimes, my thoughts would
wander back to my mom and her
alcoholism. At some level, I knew
that I drank abnormally. I was able
to justify to myself that T was
different from her, after all, I drank
socially, she drank alone. I know
now that one aspect of the disease
that virtually all acoholics share is
denial. We find ways to hide from
the obvious destruction we are doing
to ourselves in order to continue to
drink.
I think it is important to mention
that I probably didn't act any
differently than other people at
parties. In fact, I prided myself on
my ability to maintain my
composure. The difference between
me and another drinker at a party
were my motives for drinking and

my feelings about it I drank to get
drunk. I drank to feel different, and I
didn't stop after one or two -although
I always wanted to stop.
I was never really held accountable
for the damage the disease was doing
in my life, and so the drinking
continued. My grades didn't slip,
although I lost time from class
and studying due to drinking.
I never blacked out or had
lapses of memory, although many
alcoholics do. I was never arrested
for drunk driving, although many
times I could have been. No one
ever said to me, "Michele, I'm
worried about your drinking" and
who knows what would have
happened if they had. It is very
easy, especially in college (yes, even
at Stanford) to deny that you may
have a problem with alcohol.
People are accepting of drunken
behavior, when perhaps they
shouldn't be. The "Stanford
myth"makes it difficult for people to
accept that they are unhappy about
anything. For me, it took an event
where my drinking had ramifications
to force me to accept that I had a
problem.
