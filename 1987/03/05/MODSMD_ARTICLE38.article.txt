# WHY THIS ISSUE?
## 
### 
This year has been a banner year for media coverage
of drugs. Concerns about drug testing for athletes and
individuals seeking employment have saturated the
news. Turn on the TV most evenings and see a
celebrity look directly at you and say" Cocaine - the
Big Lie." Beer companies are extolling the virtues of
"have a few, not a few too many." The government
says "Just say no."
What does this mean for Stanford? Is there a drug and
alcohol problem here? Should we be concerned?
Last May, Cowell Student Health Center conducted a
triennial Survey on the Health of Stanford Students.
The last was conducted in 1983. Among many topics,
the Survey inquired about students' substance use
practices. In this Winter Quarter issue of The Student
Body data from the Survey is coupled with
information about various substances of use and abuse.
The issue of substance use by Stanford students is
important, not only because of the patterns of use
identified in the Survey, but also because of com
munity and personal reactions to these patterns.
Historically there has been ambiguity about when
substance abuse is a problem. Even among experts in
the field, it has been difficult to agree on criteria to
resolve these issues. Data therefore cannot answer the
question "Is there a substance abuse problem at
Stanford?," in itself. But the data can stimulate
necessary dialogue.
