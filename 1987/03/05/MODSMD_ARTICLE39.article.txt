## Drug Testing On the Job 
### KATHY CAMPBELL, Counselor at Stanford's Career Planning Placement Center 
Even though media hype has focused
a great deal cm the testing of
professional athletes, 25% of the
FORTUNE 500 corporations now
conduct routine drug screening
urinalysis on employees and job
applicants. This figure is up from
10% in 1981 and is estimated to rise
to 50% by 1988. The Fourth
Amendment to the Constitution, the
basis for numerous lawsuits,
prohibits the government from
conducting unreasonable searches and
seizures. This amendment, however,
in no way prohibits private
companies from requiring employees
to submit to a drug screening
process as a condition of
employment
Proponents of drug screening believe
that the evidence clearly indicates a
negative relationship between drug
use and job performance. The
purpose then of drug testing is to
screen out those whose employment
would have a detrimental impact on
the safety, productivity, and general
level of health of an employer's
work force.
It is the opinion of many
organizations that mass testing
poses far more of a deterrent to drug
use than the rather remote threat of
going to jail. Therefore, if people
know they will have to pass a urine
test in order to obtain or keep a good
job, they are less likely to
experiment with drugs. Estimates
from the U.S. Chamber of
Commerce stating that drug and
alcohol abuse costs employers $60
billion a year seem to substantiate
the very real concerns employers are
expressing.
As with any issue of consequence
there are adamant opponents to the

practice of mass drug screening.
Opposition, including the American
Civil Liberties Union, tends to focus
around two central issues: the
disregard for a person's civil rights
and the unreliability of the screening
instruments. It is the opinion of
many opponents that if drug
screening is to be conducted it
should be restricted to those
employees who are suspected of
using drugs in a way that impairs
job performance. They state that by
searching everyone, the innocent and
guilty alike, to find the few who are
guilty is analogous to employers
presuming applicants and employees
are guilty until proven innocent.
Also questioned is an employer's
right to monitor a prospective or
current employee's conduct off the
job. Screening techniques cannot
measure degree of impairment, level
of job performance, or whether a
person is under the influence of
drugs on the job.
The issue of accuracy of the
screening measures, opponents state,
becomes even more critical when
considering the impact of a falsely
positive result on an individual's
future. Even instruments with 95%
accuracy will elicit results in which
five out of every hundred of those
accused would be innocent.
Accuracy of results can also be
affected by the skill of the individual
administering the tests or the labs
analyzing the results. Manufacturers
of such screening measures stress
that a positive reading on an initial
test should be confirmed with follow
up tests and other measures to verify
results. Action, they caution, is
unwarranted after only one screening;
however, some companies treat
confirmation as a process they need
not go through.
The practice of testing is certain to
continue. Just as certain, will be the
increase in court cases that weigh the
employer's right to know against the
employee's right to privacy.
Students and others embarking on
career paths will need to examine
their own feelings and values as they
relate to drug screening and make
their choices accordingly.
