## Brownmiller expects 'new wave' in movement 
### MAURICE LEE 
Susan Brownmlller, a feminist author and ac
tivist, said last night that because of the nature of so
cial movements, today's feminists "do not have the
fire they did 15 years ago" and that feminists have
lost much of their solidarity.
Brownmlller said, however, that she expects a
"new wave of feminism" before the end of the cen
tury.
In addition to the history and outlook of the
women's movement. Brownmlller addressed the is
sues of rape, abortion and pornography in her
speech at Cubberley Auditorium. Approximately 150
persons attended the event.
Brownmlller said she first became aware of the
need for rape education in the early 1970s through
"consciousness raising" - small group encounters
in which women share their personal feelings and
experiences.
Through these discussions. Brownmlller said she
learned that many women needed to be informed of
the dangers of rape. She also said that she found
that rape "required scholarship . . so [I] decided to

write a history."
Four years later, Brownmlller published her highly
acclaimed book. "Against Our Will — Men, Women
and Rape," one of the first serious discussions of
rape and Its history.
Brownmlller received a chorus of cheers and ap
plause from the crowd when she described Dr. Ruth
Westheimer's views on date rape as "nonsense."
Westhelmer told a Stanford audience last Novem
ber that when a man and woman engage In advanced
foreplay and one of the parties forces Intercourse
without the consent of the other, rape has not oc
curred.
In 1970. Brownmlller orchestrated a rape discus
sion forum in a Manhattan church — a forum she
said "was the first ever In the history of the world."
Brownmlller feels today, as she felt then, that
"women should have control of their own bodies."
Brownmlller said that pornography Is a "powerful
Incitement to violent behavior against women," and
that by degrading women to a sub-human standard
It was easier for men to commit violent crimes
against them.
