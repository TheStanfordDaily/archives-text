# TESTING
## Drug Testing in Varsity Athletics 
### John Dorman, M.D. Associate Director of Medicine 
In January of 1986, the NCAA
enacted legislation requiring
that, as a condition of eligi
bility, all athletes participating
in NCAA competitions
annually sign an agreement
saying that they "consent to
being tested for the use of
drugs prohibited by NCAA
legislation". Any athlete found
to have utilized a substance on
the list of banned drugs "in
preparation for or participation
in an NCAA championship or
certified post-season football
contest... shall not be eligible
for further participation in post
season competition."
What this essentially means is
that the NCAA itself is going
to be testing for an extensive
list of drugs at the time of any
post-season competition. The
intent of such a program is not

entirely clear, since the list
includes both "performance
enhancing" drugs, such as
anabolic steroids and
sympathomimetic (adrenalin
like) medications, as well as
"recreational" drugs, such as
marijuana and cocaine, which
probably interfere with
performance.
Most of the drugs on the
NCAA banned list are the same
ones included on the list used
for the Olympics in 1984. The
list includes
* stimulants like ampheta
mines,
* sympathomimetics like
ephedrine and pseudoephe
drine (sudafed),
* caffeine (in amounts equi
valent to 8-10 cups of coffee at
a sitting),
* anabolic steroids
* diuretics (because of
concern that athletes will use
diuretics to flush other drugs
out of their systems).
* cocaine, heroin, marijuana
and "others".
Many of the drugs, such as
Sudafed or caffeine, can be
purchased over the counter.
Others are prescription items
that have legitimate medical

uses, such as ephedrine for
asthma or diuretics for high
blood pressure. The NCAA
says that "exceptions... may
be made by the Executive
Committee for those student
athletes with a documented
medical history demonstrating
the need for regular use of
such a drug".
At the present time, Stanford is
one of a few schools across the
country and the only one in the
Pac-10 that is not in favor of
such a program. Seven of the
other schools in the Pac-10
conference will randomly test
their athletes during the
season. The legislature in the
State of Washington will not
allow the state universities
there to follow this procedure.
Stanford's concern is
principally that student athletes
should be treated the same as
all other students. There is no
more rationale to test varsity
athletes than band members,
Daily staffers, or English
majors.
Such an attitude should not be
construed as condoning drug
use. Stanford feels that the
focus should be more on
education, and that the
education should be provided
to all students, not just
athletes. However, meetings

have taken place with several
of the teams that compete in the
fall, focusing on education
about drugs and the new
NCAA rules. The general
message has been not to take
street drugs at all, and not to
take any other medications,
over the counter or
prescription, until cleared with
trainers or team physicians.
Voluntary drug testing will be
given to athletes on a
confidential basis through the
team physicians, as well as
counseling and rehabilitation
for those who test positive and
request it
A concern for both athletes and
job seekers alike should be the
accuracy of such tests. No
matter how good a test is, there
will always be false results.
False positives are tests that
come out posititive when the
student has not taken drugs;
the more specific a test (for a
certain drug), the fewer false
positives. False negatives are
tests that come out negative
even when the student has
taken a drug; the more
sensitive a test, the fewer false
negatives. Often the more
sensitive a test is to the
presence of drugs, the less
specific it will be to which
drug is in the system. The less
prevalent the use of a drug is,
the more likely it is that a
positive test will be a false
positive rather than a true
positive result
As an example, let us say that a
test has a specificity of 95
percent for Drug M - meaning
that it is correct 95 percent of
the time. This is quite a good
test. However, in the
population to be tested, only
one out of a hundred students
actually uses Drug M. That
means that out of one hundred
students tested, five will test
6>sitive for Drug M.
owever, only one of these
will be a true positive, and the
other four will be false
posititves.
