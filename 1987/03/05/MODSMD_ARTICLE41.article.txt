# "My Friend has a Problem"
## 
### By: Ana Cupp, C.H.N.P. Lou Shaw, R.N. Doug Daher, Ph.D. Staff at Cowell 
It has often been said that people
with drug and alcohol problems only
hurt themselves - not true. They
also hurt the people around them,
family friends, colleagues,
employers and others. What do you
do if you know or suspect that
someone close to you has an alcohol
or drug problem?

Survey Says:

The more frequently
students drink beer
and hard liquor,
the more they drink
per occasion.

The first step is to educate yourself.
Useful ways to learn about drug and
alcohol problems are:
- reading about drug dependence,
- contacting Counseling and
Psychological Services (723-3785),-
contacting local agencies and
treatment centers that have recovery
programs,
- and perhaps, joining a support
group.
With some knowledge, you can
begin to consider a strategy for
helping. If you are worried about
someone's addictive behavior, don't
be afraid to bring it up. Recognition
of the problem is the first step.
Many addicted individuals attribute
their awareness of the problem to the
active intervention of a friend or
relative. Let it be known that you
are concerned because you care.
Stating your observations directly,
in a non-accusatory manner, is
important. Drug dependent persons
are often defensive and well versed in
denial. They may jump on any
hesitation as a way out of the
discussion.
A discussion may have no positive
effect on your friend's behavior.
Through support and persistence,
you can influence your friend.
Action or behavior changes may not
take place at once. Therefore, along
with patience, remember to:
- remain supportive
-be prepared for some fluctuations
- support non-drinking behavior,
plan activities unrelated to alcohol
and drugs
- rely on your own support system
-know resources

Survey Says:

Undergraduate
males have a
significantly higher
mean number of
drinks per occasion
(3.7) than do grad
uate males (2.3),
undergraduate
females (2.5) or
graduate females
(1.8).

When helping, don't forget to take
care of yourself. Be aware that you
cannot take control of another's life.
At some point your responsibility
ends. If you begin to feel guilty,
then you may be overinvolved. If
you feel too involved, use your own
friends, family or support system to
help you regain objectivity.

Expressing
your
concern
about a
friend's
drinking

1. FIND A SUITABLE TIME.
Someone who is drunk usually
cannot be talked with constructively
about his/her drinking problem.
2. DETERMINE IF YOU HAVE
THE KIND OF RELATIONSHIP
WITH THE PERSON THAT WILL
ENABLE THE PERSON TO HEAR
WHAT YOU HAVE TO SAY.
If the person likes and respects
you, your words will carry more
weight. If you do not have a close
relationship, find a friend who will
be in a better position to effectively
express the concerns.

3. EXPLAIN YOUR REASONS
FOR TALKING WITH THE
PERSON. ("I'm concerned when you
drink so much at parties." "I really
get scared when you lose track of
part of an evening.")
4. BE SPECIFIC AND CLEAR IN
YOUR CONFRONTATION.
Describe the specific behaviors that
have caused your concern, such as
damage or rowdiness. Also specify
what concerns you think may be
related to the student's drinking, such
as personal isolation, anxiety over
parents' divorce, or stress from
academic pressure.
5. SHOW THE PERSON YOU
CARE. Whenever you can,
communicate your interest in the
person. Don't be overly critical.
Try to convey that because you care
for him/her, you are concerned about
the drinking behavior. Also
comment on the person's strengths.
6. MAINTAIN YOUR COURSE.
Don't be diverted to a defensive
position by letting the person shift
the focus to you and the fact that
you may drink. Abuse of alcohol is
the problem, not the use of alcohol
itself.
7. ENCOURAGE THE PERSON
TO SEEK HELP AND REFER TO
APPROPRIATE RESOURCES.

Survey says:

The more students
drink beer, the more
they report that they
drink too much, and
that they drink and
drive.

Counseling and Psychological
Services (723-3785) is a good place
to start See Resources list.
8. BE PREPARED FOR
DENIALS AND DEFENSIVE
REACTIONS.

Alcohol:
"But
Everyone
Does It!"

Harvey Weinstein, M.D.
Psychiatrist, Counseling and
Psychological Services
What drug causes birth defects,
neurological disorder, liver disease,
other body system damage, and such
severe effects on behavior that its
cost to the United States - in lost
work hours, destruction of family
life, accidents and death - is almost
beyond imagining? Were it now to
come up for approval by the
government, clearly this drug would
never pass.
Yet it is a übiquitous part of
growing up, of social gatherings, of
celebrations: much of the leisure
time of Americans is spent in its
use. It is a clear reflection of the
ambivalence of our society towards
this substance that in the current
wave of concern over drugs, there is
actually less emphasis on this - the
most prevalent and life-threatening
of the drugs of abuse. The drug is
alchohol.
To understand why there is so much
resistance to dealing with the alcohol
problem, some statistics may help
to clarify its wide acceptance. It has
been reported that over two-thirds of
American men drink regularly; the
largest proportion of drinkers being
college students. The peak years of
alcohol use are between ages 16 and
25. It has also been noted that
between a quarter and a half of young
men have occasional alcohol-related
problems which may include
fighting, drunk driving arrests, and
time lost from school or work.
Alcohol was cited as the "driver
contributing factor" in 17% of fatal
accidents for drivers age 16 to 20.
We are not talking here about
alcoholics - these are not people who
are addicted to alcohol. It is
important for us to recognize that, in
the United States, the norm is that
drinking is acceptable and enjoyable.
Mark Schuckit, a noted researcher in
the field, describes the course of
alcohol intoxication as follows:
" he tends to have his first alcohol
related experience (...drinking on
his own) between the ages of 12 and
15, his first experience of
drunkenness by the mid-teens, and
especially for males, his first
temporary alcohol-related life
problem at 18-25 ... It is probably
in the late 20's to early 30's tht the

average drinker decreases his
frequency and quantity of intake,
whereas the alchoholic maintains
or even increases his drinking
pattern..."
The term alcohol refers to the active
ingredient in beer, wine, or whiskey -
ethyl alcohol. Beer contains about 4-
6% alcohol by volume, wine 12-
14% , and hard liquor - whiskey,
rum, vodka, or gin - about 40-50%.
The word proof refers to alcohol
content expressed as twice the
percent. Whiskey thus is 80 to 100
proof. Alcohol provides calories to
the body primarily through
carbohydrate content, however,
alcohol has no nutritional value.
Excessive use leads to malnutrition.
How does alcohol affect us? The
initial effect is mild stimulation and
euphoria. Disinhibition is the basic
process which allows individuals to
feel more comfortable and less
concerned with what others think.
Continuing to drink however,
produces the depressive effects of the
drug, since alcohol is primarily a
depressant.
Researchers in the field have
described four distinct stages of
alcohol intoxication.
0 The first or Alcohol State of
Consciousness-1 (ASC-1)
encompasses the early period as the
drug is absorbed. Physical effects
include "talkativeness, laughter,
deteriorating muscle coordination,
and declining performance in mental
and physical health."
0 ASC-2 occurs when the peak
blood level has been reached. Effects
at this point include fatigue and
reticence. Impairment of cognitive
and physical abilities is present but
beginning to improve. It is
apparent that the individual is still
intoxicated.
0 ASC-3 is the state of most
concern. The blood level has
dropped considerably; in fact, the
person feels normal. Although
feeling sober, the drinker still has a
detectable blood level. Physical
impairment is still present but is not
recognized. Consequently, the
drinker at this point wants to act as
if nothing is wrong. "I can drive,"
he or she says. There is a large gap
between performance and
expectation. This is the time of
trouble.
0 ASC-4 is the state that
exists when the blood level has
returned to normal. Even now,
however, abnormal eye movements
may persist for up to 24 to 32 hours
after drinking and performance may
be impaired. It is therefore critical
to recognize that people may be
affected by alcohol even more than
one day following its use.
What we have then is a drug which
is widely used and accepted. It's
recreational use begins at a very
young age, and we know that the
earlier one starts to drink alcohol,
the greater the likelihood of
developing an addiction to the drug.
The problems that arise with its use
are not confined to the alcoholic but,
to a considerable extent, occur in
relation to those who imbibe only
occasionally. We are talking about
friends, roommates and family for
whom alcohol occasionally leads to
major problems.
The drug is powerful and exerts its
effects rapidly; the initial good
feeling dissipates as more is
consumed. Judgment becomes
impaired, leading to poor decision
making. LasUy, the effects of
drinking are long-lasting, and
performance may be affected more
than a day later.
Knowing the facts about alcohol
enables us to make reasonable
choices about its use. The pressures
that college students face with
respect to alcohol are considerable,
especially in light of its widespread
acceptance.

How to Spot
Alcohol Abuse
0 Frequent intoxication (Gets drunk
every weekend, keeps liquor in his or
her room)
0 Mood/personality changes (with
drawn, mood swings from euphoria
to the doldrums) Mood changes can
be observed up to three or four days
after a drinking episode (Saturday
night bash might be followed by
Monday morning blues)
° Skipping classes due to hangover
0 More than one incident of
disruption or damage that is alcohol
related
° Blackouts ( no recollection of a
period of time when he or she was
drinking excessively) It does not
necessarily take a lot of drinking to
trigger a blackout, and a person who
has reached the stage of blacking out
may not necessarily look drunk
0 Drinking at inappropriate times
(early in the morning, before tests)

Mixing Alcohol
With Other
Drugs

Alcohol in combination with
another drug is much more
dangerous than the use of one or the
other. When alcohol is combined
with other central nervous system
depressants, a marked and
exaggerated effect occurs. For
example, when alcohol is mixed
with barbituates (e.g, painkillers,
sleeping pills) one drink plus one
pill may equal the effect of six or
eight pills. In this situation a
person may unwittingly overdose.
Alcohol mixed with stimulants
(e.g., amphetamines, cocaine) is
dangerous because, while the drugs
may provide a false sense of
sobriety, they do not actually
counteract the effects of the alcohol (
such as loss of coordination and
judgment).

What is a
Medical
Emergency?
Get immediate help if the person:
-Cannot be roused.
-Has difficulty breathing.
-Consumed most of a fifth of hard
liquor or its equivalent in 2-3 hours.
-Drank alcohol in combination
with barbiturates.
If any of these conditions exist, call
911 or rush the person to the
Hospital Emergency room. If in
doubt, call Cowell 723-4841.
