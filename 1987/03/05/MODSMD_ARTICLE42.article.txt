## Cocaine 
### Paul A. Walters, Jr., M.D.Director, Cowell Student Health Center 
Cocaine is a stimulant that is short lasting. In its
crystalline (white fluffy powder) form, cocaine is
most often inhaled (snorted) through a tube direcUy
into the nasal passages, passing quickly into the
brain. It can be smoked or injected. However it is
introduced into the body, the drug's immediate
effect is to create a high that is often described as

orgasmic or euphoric.
It creates increased alert
ness, supresses appetite
and temporarily relieves
depression.

Studies indicate that
cocaine's effects on
both body and psyche
are dangerous and some
damage may be irrever
sible. The least harm
ful cffects are the pain
ful nosebleeds and nasal
erosion that results from
irritating the lining of
the nose. More danger
ous are what are known
as the "coke blues" -

which are the intense downs that occur after the
high and often result in the user trying a variety of
other drugs in an attempt to relieve the physical or
emotional discomfort. The user may resort to
taking repeated doses of cocaine, ingesting alcohol
or barbituates between doses, or resorting to
speedballs (cocaine mixed with heroin). This
activity can lead to dependency on several drugs.
There is a strong psychological dependence to
"coke" which slowly accumulates as the individual
builds up tolerance.

Coca, the leaves of the Coca plant have been
chewed by the Andean Indians of Peru, Bolivia,
Equador and Columbia for almost two thousand
years. For these people, it was a mild stimulant, a
source of vitamins and protein. In the late
nineteenth century, the stimulant from the coca
leaves was isolated by the German chemist,
Neiman, and given the name cocaine. For a time,
it was used as a stimulant, a topical anesthetic, a
vaso-constrictor, and at the turn of the century,
was popular in some drinks, noteably Coca Cola.
In 1914, the drug was classified as a narcotic under
the Harris Narcotic Act, and its use was primarily
for medicinal purposes.
In the late 1960'5, along with many other drugs,
cocaine reached the streets. During the next
decade, it was sold as cocaine hydrochloride, a
white crystalline powder which was usually
snorted and occasionally used intravenously. Three
factors seemed to limit its use during this time.
First, the drug was relatively expensive, restricting
its use to the affluent Second, cocaine is a potent
vaso-constrictor which means that relatively small

Survey Says:
At Stanford the use of cocaine
has remained relatively stable
for the last three years. The
current percentage of students
(15%) who report that they use
or have tried cocaine is about
the same as reported in 1983
(14%). More undergraduates
report that they have tried or
use cocaine (17%) compared
to graduate students (12%).

amounts are absorbed through the mucus
membranes of the nose. Third, it has a short
acting euphoric effect If repeated too often, for
most people the intensity of this effect is not
pleasurable.

In the mid 1970'5, a new form of cocaine appeared
An aquaeous solution of cocaine hydrochloride was
alkalinized with ammonia or baking soda, and an
alkaloid precipitate of cocaine was formed. This
form of cocaine, unlike cocaine hydrochloride, was
not destroyed by heating; making it suitable for
smoking. Smoking cocaine prepared in this
manner is called freebasing. Freebase cocaine sold

on tne street may be
called crack because
of the noise it makes
when heated. It is
also called rock
because of its
appearance, or in
South America,
paste which is an
even stronger form
of freebase. Th;
effect of freebrse
cocaine is almost
instantaneous, as
compared with the
two to three minutes
required for the
maximum effect
through snorting.

During the middle and late 1970'5, cocaine was
considered an "in" drug among the affluent and was
mistakenly termed safe. Its use seemed limited
only by availability and expense, and it was
thought that many people could use cocaine safely.
However, a disturbing pattern began to emerge.
Although someone can use cocaine one or two
times a month for a period of time, at some
unpredictable occasion, a craving for cocaine will
be developed. This follows the establishment of a
neural pathway in the central nervous system. The
time and extent of use required to establish this
pathway varies from individual to individual,
depending on factors such as genetic vulnerability.
Once this craving has been established, it leads to
bingeing with cocaine for a two or three day
period, after which, the person is exhausted and
sleeps from 12 hours to a few days. This
experience creates a craving for cocaine and leads to
compulsive use.
When cocaine hydrochloride was the predominant
form of the drug on the street, compulsive use of
cocaine did not occur as frequently as it has within
the past three to five years following the
introduction of crack. Crack is potentially addictive
within a few uses. Crack is also potentially lethal,
causing irreversible cardiac arrhythmias or
convulsions followed by lack of oxygen to the
brain (anoxia).
It is now widely accepted that the basketball
player, Len Bias, died from anoxia following a
crack induced convulsion. It is also accepted that
the football player, Don Rogers, died of a cardiac

arrythmia following crack ingestion. Both of
these athletes were said to have been occasional
users or even first time users. These individual
cases, in the public sphere, only serve to highlight
the dangers of cocaine.
The message now is that cocaine has become a
potentially addictive and lethal drug in any form.
The cocaine hydrochloride now available is less
adulterated than before, and is therefore more
dangerous. In the form of crack, it is an easily
obtained, relatively inexpensive, rapidly addictive
drug that can cause lethal overdosage in the
experienced user and uninitiated user alike.

amounts are absorbed through the mucus
membranes of the nose. Third, it has a short
acting euphoric effect If repeated too often, for
most people the intensity of this effect is not
pleasurable.

In the mid 1970'5, a new form of cocaine appeared
An aquaeous solution of cocaine hydrochloride was
alkalinized with ammonia or baking soda, and an
alkaloid precipitate of cocaine was formed. This
form of cocaine, unlike cocaine hydrochloride, was
not destroyed by heating; making it suitable for
smoking. Smoking cocaine prepared in this
manner is called freebasing. Freebase cocaine sold

on tne street may be
called crack because
of the noise it makes
when heated. It is
also called rock
because of its
appearance, or in
South America,
paste which is an
even stronger form
of freebase. Th;
effect of freebrse
cocaine is almost
instantaneous, as
compared with the
two to three minutes
required for the
maximum effect
through snorting.

During the middle and late 1970'5, cocaine was
considered an "in" drug among the affluent and was
mistakenly termed safe. Its use seemed limited
only by availability and expense, and it was
thought that many people could use cocaine safely.
However, a disturbing pattern began to emerge.
Although someone can use cocaine one or two
times a month for a period of time, at some
unpredictable occasion, a craving for cocaine will
be developed. This follows the establishment of a
neural pathway in the central nervous system. The
time and extent of use required to establish this
pathway varies from individual to individual,
depending on factors such as genetic vulnerability.
Once this craving has been established, it leads to
bingeing with cocaine for a two or three day
period, after which, the person is exhausted and
sleeps from 12 hours to a few days. This
experience creates a craving for cocaine and leads to
compulsive use.
When cocaine hydrochloride was the predominant
form of the drug on the street, compulsive use of
cocaine did not occur as frequently as it has within
the past three to five years following the
introduction of crack. Crack is potentially addictive
within a few uses. Crack is also potentially lethal,
causing irreversible cardiac arrhythmias or
convulsions followed by lack of oxygen to the
brain (anoxia).
It is now widely accepted that the basketball
player, Len Bias, died from anoxia following a
crack induced convulsion. It is also accepted that
the football player, Don Rogers, died of a cardiac

arrythmia following crack ingestion. Both of
these athletes were said to have been occasional
users or even first time users. These individual
cases, in the public sphere, only serve to highlight
the dangers of cocaine.
The message now is that cocaine has become a
potentially addictive and lethal drug in any form.
The cocaine hydrochloride now available is less
adulterated than before, and is therefore more
dangerous. In the form of crack, it is an easily
obtained, relatively inexpensive, rapidly addictive
drug that can cause lethal overdosage in the
experienced user and uninitiated user alike.

The cocaine now available

Cocaine is a stimulant that is short lasting. In its
crystalline (white fluffy powder) form, cocaine is
most often inhaled (snorted) through a tube direcUy
into the nasal passages, passing quickly into the
brain. It can be smoked or injected. However it is
introduced into the body, the drug's immediate
effect is to create a high that is often described as

orgasmic or euphoric.
It creates increased alert
ness, supresses appetite
and temporarily relieves
depression.

Studies indicate that
cocaine's effects on
both body and psyche
are dangerous and some
damage may be irrever
sible. The least harm
ful cffects are the pain
ful nosebleeds and nasal
erosion that results from
irritating the lining of
the nose. More danger
ous are what are known
as the "coke blues" -

which are the intense downs that occur after the
high and often result in the user trying a variety of
other drugs in an attempt to relieve the physical or
emotional discomfort. The user may resort to
taking repeated doses of cocaine, ingesting alcohol
or barbituates between doses, or resorting to
speedballs (cocaine mixed with heroin). This
activity can lead to dependency on several drugs.
There is a strong psychological dependence to
"coke" which slowly accumulates as the individual
builds up tolerance.

Coca, the leaves of the Coca plant have been
chewed by the Andean Indians of Peru, Bolivia,
Equador and Columbia for almost two thousand
years. For these people, it was a mild stimulant, a
source of vitamins and protein. In the late
nineteenth century, the stimulant from the coca
leaves was isolated by the German chemist,
Neiman, and given the name cocaine. For a time,
it was used as a stimulant, a topical anesthetic, a
vaso-constrictor, and at the turn of the century,
was popular in some drinks, noteably Coca Cola.
In 1914, the drug was classified as a narcotic under
the Harris Narcotic Act, and its use was primarily
for medicinal purposes.
In the late 1960'5, along with many other drugs,
cocaine reached the streets. During the next
decade, it was sold as cocaine hydrochloride, a
white crystalline powder which was usually
snorted and occasionally used intravenously. Three
