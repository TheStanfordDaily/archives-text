Marijuana (grass, dope, a joint...) has been around
college campuses for a long time. Its use in
American universities has in fact decreased in the
last ten years but it continues to be a issue. Why
is this? First, marijuana is a drug that is relatively
easily obtained; in the majority of people it
produces a pleasant sense of relaxation and
euphoria that can lead to chronic use. Some
Stanford students do move from social use to
"dependent" use; that is, the drug is used to cope
with examination anxiety, imsomnia, depression,
and even shyness.

Survey Says: ,
After alcohol, marijuana is
the substance most often
used by Stanford students,
with 35% reporting having
tried or used it within the
past year. More under
graduates (41%) than grad
uate students (27%) report
having used or tried it within
the past year.
For some years, there appeared to be some
question as to whether addiction to marijuana
occured in this country. Over the last decade,
however, more potent forms of the drug have
become prevalent and clear withdrawal symptoms
have been reported. These include imsomnia,
depression, restlessness, nausea and other physical
responses. Researchers have reported that
marijuana does appear to act as a so-called gateway
drug opening the user to the possibilities of other
drug use. Based on several studies, they repot
that 93% of all people who have tried cocaine used
marijuana first.
What is marijuana? Marijuana, produced by the
hemp plant, is a drug that is taken to produce a
high or euphoric feeling and a state of relaxation.
The high will last 2-4 hours. Marijuana is
usually smoken or eaten. It is classified as a
hallucinogen. The short term effects of marijuana
include distortion of time perception, increased
heart rate, dilation of blood vessels and loss of
short term memory. Also decreased are visual
perception and psychomotor skill, which have
adverse effects on driving ability. A common bad
reaction to marijuana is the "acute panic anxiety
reaction," or paranoia.
The primary psychoactive ingredient is THC
(tetrahydrocannabinol). The more THC that is
present, the more potent the marijuana. Potency
varies from 1% to 7%, most commonly 3-4%
THC. The type of plant, the weather, the soil, the
time of harvest, and other factors determine the
strength of marijuana. Hashish, or hash, is made
by taking the resin from the leaves and flowers of
the marijuana plant and pressing it into cakes or
slabs. Hash is usually stronger than crude
marijuana and may contain five to ten times as
much THC. Hash oil may contain up to 50
percent THC. Pure THC is almost never
available, except for research. Substances sold as
THC often turn out to be something else, such as
PCP.
The effects of long term use include loss of
motivation, chronic bronchitis, decreased vital
lung capacity and an increased risk of lung cancer.
In men, subtle changes are produced in various of
the hormones. Marijuana use also causes an
increase in abnormal sperm. Although marijuana
use has not conclusively been related to sterility or
permanent hormone abnormalities, most
reproductive endocrinologists advise men who
currently wish to have children to refrain from
marijuana use. Pregnant women should not
smoke marijuana as the effects on the fetus are as
yet unclear.
