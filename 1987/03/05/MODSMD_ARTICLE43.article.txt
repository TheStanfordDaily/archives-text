Marijuana (grass, dope, a joint...) has been around
college campuses for a long time. Its use in
American universities has in fact decreased in the
last ten years but it continues to be a issue. Why
is this? First, marijuana is a drug that is relatively
easily obtained; in the majority of people it
produces a pleasant sense of relaxation and
euphoria that can lead to chronic use. Some
Stanford students do move from social use to
"dependent" use; that is, the drug is used to cope
with examination anxiety, imsomnia, depression,
and even shyness.

Survey Says: ,
After alcohol, marijuana is
the substance most often
used by Stanford students,
with 35% reporting having
tried or used it within the
past year. More under
graduates (41%) than grad
uate students (27%) report
having used or tried it within
the past year.
