# Hallucinogens

### 
Drugs that produce hallucinations or dream-like
perceptions are called hallucinogens. The most
common hallucinogens are LSD (acid), mescaline
(peyote) and psilocybin (mushrooms). These
drugs have an effect that lasts from 8-12 hours to
days, depending on the potency and drug type.
LSD is manufactured from lysergic acid, which is
found in ergot, a fungus that grows on rye and
other grains. It was discovered in 1938 and is one
of the most potent mood changing chemicals.
LSD is odorless, colorless, and tasteless, and is
sold in tablets, capsules, or occasionally in liquid
fern. It is usually taken by mouth but sometimes
is injected. Often it is added to absorbent paper,

Survey Says:
The use of psychedelics
appears to have increased
since 1983. The 1986 rate
stood at 9% of students (11%
of undergraduates and 6% of
graduate students) compared
to 5% in 1983.

such as blotter paper, and divided into small
squares, with each square representing one dose.
The effects of psychedelics are unpredictable. It
depends on the amount taken, the user's
personality, mood, and expectations, and the
surroundings in which the drug is used. Usually,
the user feels the first effects of the drug 30-90
minutes after taking it The physical effects
include dilated pupils, higher body temperature,
increased heart rate and blood pressure, sweating
loss of appetite, sleeplessness, dry mouth and
tremors. Sensations and feelings change too. The
user may feel several different emotions at once or
swing rapidly from one emotion to another.
The person's sense of time and self change.
Sensations may seem to "cross over," giving the
user the feeling of 'hearing" colors and "seeing"
sounds. Sometimes taking a hallucinogen
can unmask mental or emotional issues or
problems that were previously unknown to the
user.
On occasion, panic reactions occur, producing
horrifying perceptions. The scary sensations may
last a few minutes or several hours and may be
mildly frightening or terrifying. The user may
experience panic, confusion, suspiciousness,
anxiety, feelings of helplessness, and loss of
control.
Although there is no physical dependence
associated with these drugs, they are still
considered dangerous because of these paradoxical
effects. Tolerance can develop to the hallucino
gens, and due to the perceptual distortions no one
should drive while using any of these drugs. Since
these drugs cause misperceptions, people using
them can put themselves or others into dangerous,
even life threatening, situations.
Research has shown some changes in the mental
functions of heavy users of LSD, but they are not
present in all cases. Heavy users sometimes
develop signs of organic brain damage, such as
impaired memory and attention span, mental
confusion, and difficulty with abstract thinking. It
is not yet known whether such mental changes are
permanent or if they disappear when heavy use of
LSD is stopped.
