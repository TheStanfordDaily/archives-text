# Ecstasy
## 
### Michael Goff in consultation with Vince D'Andrea, M.D. Director, counseling psychological services 
Ecstasy, also known as MDMA, Adam and the
"hug drug," is a hallucinogenic amphetamine
which intensifies emotional feelings such as self
acceptance, contentment, and rapport with others

Ecstasy is taken in pill or powder form and its side
effects include nausea, muscle tension, loss of
appetite, jaw clenching, eye waggling (nystg
mus), and nervousness or a desire to move about.
Psychological difficulties, including confusion,
depression, sleep problems, drug craving, severe
anxiety and paranoia - during or even weeks after
taking MDMA - have been reported. Ecstasy is
sometimes known as the love drug because it is
supposed to inspire loving feelings among people.
Unlike other psychedelics, it rarely changes visual
perceptions. Although it is a strong stimulant,
chemically related to amphetamine, people who
take it say it calms them and promotes relaxation.
They report a general condition of peacefulness,
and an ability to experience trust with a loss of
psychological barriers. Some users say it makes
them more coordinated, more energetic, and better
at physical activities. The effects last for two to
six hours. The drug has gained a reputation as a
party drug in some circles and is being used in
riskier ways. Combined with alcohol or other
depressants at parties, Ecstasy is more likely to
cause adverse reactions.
According to Dr. Stephen Penitka, a neurological
researcher at Stanford, not much is known about
the long term effects of Ecstasy. It was initially
used by a small number of psychiatrists in therapy
for the 15 years years before it was banned. In
1985, a University of Chicago study on rats
showed that high doses of MDMA killed parts of
the brain terminals for serotonin in some of the
rats. Serotonin is thought to have something to
do with feelings of depression and anxiety and is a
neuro- transmitter. This study led the FDA to
classify the drug as schedule 1 - meaning that there
is no known therapeutic use and that it is
addictive. This is a point of contention with some
of the psychiatrists that had used it with their
patients. The penalties for posession or use of a
schedule 1 drug like Ecstasy or heroin are
extremely high.

Survey says:
At Stanford, 6% of students
report that they use or have
tried ecstasy: more under
graduates (8%) than grad
uate students (2%)

Perutka says that Ecstasy is the fastest growing
drug among undergraduates and he estimates that
20-30 percent of the undergraduate population have
tried it. In the Cowell survey, eight percent of
undergraduates said they had tried or used Ecstasy
in the last year. He is currently involved in a
study to try to determine whether the drug is a
toxin to humans. It is possible that students who
took Ecstasy as undergraduates will have
neurological psychological implications later on.
Perutka says these implications cannot be
determined at this time, but could run the gamut
from negligible to muscular diseases like
Parkinsons. Experiments and observations of users
have begun to determine if the serotonin is in fact
affected in humans. If serotonin in humans is
affected, more studies will have to be done to
determine whether this serotonin comes back when
use of the drug is stopped. The bottom line is that
not much is known about the long term effects of
MDMA in humans. No one is sure if human's
serotonin system is affected like that of rats or if
the serotonin comes back when use of the drug has
ended. Students may be offered a substance that is
held out to be MDMA, which is actually
something else. The effects reported in this article
refer to what is known about the effects of
MDMA.
