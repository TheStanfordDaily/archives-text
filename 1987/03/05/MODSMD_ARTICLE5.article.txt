# S. Africa report urges education
## 
### RUSSELL KOROBKIN Editorial staff 
The Board of Trustees' Special
Committee on Investment Re
sponsibility (SCIR) tomorrow will
consider a task force report that
concludes "educational initiatives
offer greater promise against
apartheid than threats of disin
vestment."
The report, presented to the full
board in February but not
released publicly until this week,
suggests that the University
should "act more decisively in its
position as a world leader in edu
cation through the force of ideas
and through the creation of spe
cific programs to combat the ef
fects of apartheid on education in
southern Africa."
Dartmouth Education Prof.
Theodore Mitchell, the Stanford
trustee who headed the task force,
said the report's purpose is to
create points of discussion about
Stanford's role in"the broad issue
of disinvestment." The report is a
"statement of direction, not of
specific policy." he added.
Mitchell said approval of the
report by the committee would be
tantamount to asking the Univer
sity to do more in the educational
realm to improve the situation in
South Africa.
The report states: "It is in its
role as an educational institution
that Stanford can make a clear
and positive impact on affairs in
southern Africa."
The report concludes that the
recent South African withdrawals
of several major U.S. corporations,
including IBM, General Motors

and Coca-Cola, have had "no net
positive effect on the pace of
reform In Pretoria." The report
states that these withdrawals
have resulted In "a tightening of
resolve by the Botha government"
and will probably hurt black
workers, at least In the short run.
"It should not, therefore, be
Stanford's policy to encourage dis
investment in any way that could
be construed as support for such
Immediate withdrawals," the
report states.
Mitchell said that an organized
withdrawal of American firms
from South Africa and total Isola
tion of that country might have an
effect on apartheid, but piecemeal
disinvestment has resulted in "no
measureable change," adding that
"haphazard withdrawals" are
unlikely to produce positive
results.
The report did suggest that the
board should encourage compan
ies in which the University has
holdings to "take positive and ac
tive roles in combating apart
heid."
Mitchell said he hopes the Uni
versity will "make partnerships"
with companies in its portfolio,
discussing South African Issues
with them and encouraging them
to consult campus experts on dif
ficult policy decisions.
The University should "not be in
the business of demanding that
companies withdraw from South
Africa," but it should promote the
discussion of all possible means of
ending apartheid, the report
states.
