# Brown protesters face punishment
## 
### MARK LEMLEY Staff writer 
Twenty Brown Univeristy stu
dents who disrupted a meeting of
that university's trustees to
demand divestment might be ex
pelled for violating the university's
conduct standards, according to
one of the students involved.
A hearing will be held today at 6
p.m. EST to determine whether
the students violated the stand
ards and what the punishment
should be.
The students are being
prosecuted on charges of
"behavior which interferes with
the rights of others in an unaccep
table manner" and taking actions
that "could cause physical harm
or which flagrantly disrupt the
business of the University."
These clauses are similar to the
wording of the Stanford Univer
sity Policy on Campus Disruption,

which prohibits "preventing or
disrupting the effective carrying
out of a University function or ap
proved activity."
Stanford Judicial Affairs Officer
Sally Cole has said in the past that
Stanford political protesters who
are arrested for campus disrup
tion could be prosecuted under
the Fundamental Standard. She
could not be reached for comment
last night.
According to Brown senior
Rebecca Zeigler, one of the stu
dents involved in the protest, the
events at Brown began Feb. 13,
when approximately 40 students
entered a meeting of the Brown
Corporation (the equivalent of the
Stanford Board of Trustees) to
protest the Brown's involvement
with firms doing business in
South Africa. One student began
to read a statement demanding
that the board members put the
issue of divestment on the
agenda.
Brown University President
Howard Swearer Immediately ad
journed the meeting and called in
security guards to remove the
protesters, Zeigler said.
Brown Dean of Student Life
John Robinson then allegedly
brought in a list and asked stu
dents who wished to acknowledge
responsibility for their actions to

sign the list. Zeigler claimed that
only those students who signed
the list are being prosecuted.
Robinson, who is prosecuting
the students, had no comment on
the trial or the issues it raises,
saying "we'll talk about [the case]
when it's over."
The Brown University Council
of Student Affairs, a stu
dent/faculty judicial board, will
hear the case. The trial is closed to
press and public, in spite of the
students' requests that it be open.
The students are not permitted
to bring legal counsel to the
hearing, but may have an admin

istratlon official speak in their
defense. Rev. Charles Baldwin,
the dean of the Brown chapel, will
represent the defendants.
Students are also concerned
that new rules prohibit the use of
expert testimony. The protesters
had hoped to introduce testimony
about conditions in South Africa
in order to justify their actions.
The tactic is one that Stanford
students tried unsuccessfully last
year in the trials of protesters who
had performed a sit-in at Old Un
ion in October, 1985. Judge
Franklin Ella ruled on April 15 of
last year that evidence concerning
South Africa was Irrelevant to the
question of guilt or innocence and
therefore could not be admitted.
All the Stanford protesters, who
were never tried by the University,
received minor sentences.
