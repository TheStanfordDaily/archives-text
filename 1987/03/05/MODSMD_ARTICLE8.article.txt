Contra leader testifies in U.S.
WASHINGTON — Nicaraguan rebel leader Adolfo Calero testified
yesterday for the second time before a federal grand jury inves
tigating the Iran-contra affair and its labyrinthine financing.
Calero, who turned over sheafs of bank records involving his
rebel army, the Nicaraguan Democratic Force (FDN), told
reporters that they show "absolutely no diversion of funds from
anywhere to anywhere." He said he did not want to comment fur
ther until later in the week, after independent counsel Lawrence
Walsh and his prosecutors had completed their questioning.
The investigation began last Nov. 25 when Attorney General Ed
win Meese disclosed that millions of dollars from the administra
tion's secret arms sales to Iran may have been diverted to the con
tra cause. The money trail has proved elusive, however, partly be
cause it winds through Swiss bank accounts to which Walsh is
still seeking access.
Calero first testified before the grand jury Feb. 20. He showed
up at the U.S. courthouse here again yesterday morning with his
attorney, Joseph Portuondo of Miami. The contra leader told
reporters that he has not been granted immunity "and I didn't
take the Fifth (Amendment) either." Calero has said that he has
no knowledge of Iran arms sale funds going to the contras.
Walsh visited the grand jury room in early afternoon, then went
to the Justice Department for a brief meeting with Meese. They
discussed the lawsuit Lt. Col. Oliver North has filed challenging
the constitutionality of Walsh's appointment by a three-judge
federal panel. Beyond that neither Meese nor Walsh had any com
ment.
Syrian security plan continues
AMMAN, Jordan — Lebanese army troops deployed on the coas
tal highway south of Beirut yesterday in the second phase of a
Syrian-backed security plan for the strife-torn country.
Reports from Beirut said about 600 soldiers from the Lebanese
army's 12th brigade, a predominantly Sunni Moslem detach
ment, along with Syrian army officers, took up positions along the
coastal highway running from Beirut to the southern port of
Sidon.
Positions along the 25-mile stretch of road were handed over by
troops belonging to Walid Jumblatt's Druse militia, the Progres
sive Socialist Party, who withdrew peacefully into the Chouf
Mountains above Beirut.
The troop deployment was the second phase of a security plan
that began a week ago with the arrival of 7,000 Syrian troops in
West Beirut following heavy fighting between the Druse and the
Shia Moslem militia Amal.
After initial opposition from the Moslem fundamentalist group
Hezbollah, that they dealt with forcefully, the Syrians have not
met any serious resistance in Beirut.
The deployment along the coastal highway was designed to keep
militiamen from interfering with traffic along the road. The
Syrians also have closed militia offices in West Beirut as part of
the drive to halt the anarchy in the city.
The military moves coincided with efforts to reach a political so
lution to Lebanon's 12 years of factional fighting stemming from
the 1975-76 civil war. President Amin Gemayel, who is Christian,
announced that he was sending a team of advisers to Damascus to
consult with Syrian leaders about a package of proposed political
reforms.
Moslem leaders of Lebanon's sharply divided government, led by
Premier Rashid Karami, agreed on the proposals Sunday, but so
far Gemayel has neither approved nor rejected them. According to
newspaper reports, the sweeping political reforms are designed to
give the Moslems increased power in the government, reflecting
their greater numbers.
Congressmen criticize oil plan
WASHINGTON — A majority of California's congressional
delegation yesterday accused Secretary of the Interior Donald
Model of failing to give adequate attention to broad environmental
concerns in a revised five-year plan for offshore oil and gas drilling
that would open large new areas to development along the Califor
nia coast.
In a sharply worded letter to Hodel. the predominantly Demo
cratic group said the latest version of the Department of the Inte
rior s offshore leasing plan for California failed to meet legislative
requirements for "good-faith" negotiations with Congress on envi
ronmental issues and would only serve to "repolarize" the contro
versy, which has simmered since 1981.
The letter was signed by 26 of the state's 45 House members, in
cluding three of 18 Republicans. Senator Alan Cranston, a Demo
crat, and Sen. Pete Wilson, a Republican, also signed the seven
page letter.
On Feb. 2, the Interior Department unveiled new revisions to its
proposal for a long-term drilling plan that offered for the first time
to exclude parts of the Southern California coastline from oil and
gas drilling.
At the same time, however, the new plan called for opening up
13 percent of offshore areas — 6.45 million acres — previously ex
empted from development under a congressional moratorium that
expired in 1985.
Under federal law. Hodel must formally submit a final version of
the leasing plan to Congress by April. Congress then will have 60
days to approve the plan, negotiate further changes or reject it.
Schlesinger to survey embassy
WASHINGTON — The controversy surrounding the unfinished
new U.S. Embassy in Moscow has taken a new turn with the ap
pointment last week of former Secretary of Defense James
Schlesinger to make a recommendation to the State Department
on whether the Soviet-built main chancery building can be
salvaged.
In taking on the assignment, Schlesinger is stepping into heavy
cross-fire between the State Department and Congress over who is
at fault for an enterprise that has resulted in major security flaws,
a five-year delay In completion and a cost overrun that a congres
sional study estimated at *100 million.
The choice of Schlesinger, who served as secretary of defense
and later as secretary of energy in the Carter administration, and
who also served briefly as CIA director under Nixon, seems to con
firm that security is the major concern of those deciding the build
ing's fate. U.S. inspectors discovered two years ago that the Soviet
contractor that built the chancery planted "bugs" in the floors and
walls.
Seven of the eight buildings comprising the embassy complex
are finished and occupied. But all work on the main, eight-story
chancery building stopped abruptly Aug. 17. 1985. when Soviet
workers were locked out of the site because of what a State Depart
ment report calls a combination of "security concerns, congres
sional pressure (and) Soviet construction delays."
Schlesinger's assignment, according to State Department
spokeswoman Phyllis Oakley, Is to conduct a comprehensive
review and then "develop and evaluate options for ensuring the se
cure operating environment for our mission In Moscow."

Contra leader testifies in U.S.
WASHINGTON — Nicaraguan rebel leader Adolfo Calero testified
yesterday for the second time before a federal grand jury inves
tigating the Iran-contra affair and its labyrinthine financing.
Calero, who turned over sheafs of bank records involving his
rebel army, the Nicaraguan Democratic Force (FDN), told
reporters that they show "absolutely no diversion of funds from
anywhere to anywhere." He said he did not want to comment fur
ther until later in the week, after independent counsel Lawrence
Walsh and his prosecutors had completed their questioning.
The investigation began last Nov. 25 when Attorney General Ed
win Meese disclosed that millions of dollars from the administra
tion's secret arms sales to Iran may have been diverted to the con
tra cause. The money trail has proved elusive, however, partly be
cause it winds through Swiss bank accounts to which Walsh is
still seeking access.
Calero first testified before the grand jury Feb. 20. He showed
up at the U.S. courthouse here again yesterday morning with his
attorney, Joseph Portuondo of Miami. The contra leader told
reporters that he has not been granted immunity "and I didn't
take the Fifth (Amendment) either." Calero has said that he has
no knowledge of Iran arms sale funds going to the contras.
Walsh visited the grand jury room in early afternoon, then went
to the Justice Department for a brief meeting with Meese. They
discussed the lawsuit Lt. Col. Oliver North has filed challenging
the constitutionality of Walsh's appointment by a three-judge
federal panel. Beyond that neither Meese nor Walsh had any com
ment.
Syrian security plan continues
AMMAN, Jordan — Lebanese army troops deployed on the coas
tal highway south of Beirut yesterday in the second phase of a
Syrian-backed security plan for the strife-torn country.
Reports from Beirut said about 600 soldiers from the Lebanese
army's 12th brigade, a predominantly Sunni Moslem detach
ment, along with Syrian army officers, took up positions along the
coastal highway running from Beirut to the southern port of
Sidon.
Positions along the 25-mile stretch of road were handed over by
troops belonging to Walid Jumblatt's Druse militia, the Progres
sive Socialist Party, who withdrew peacefully into the Chouf
Mountains above Beirut.
The troop deployment was the second phase of a security plan
that began a week ago with the arrival of 7,000 Syrian troops in
West Beirut following heavy fighting between the Druse and the
Shia Moslem militia Amal.
After initial opposition from the Moslem fundamentalist group
Hezbollah, that they dealt with forcefully, the Syrians have not
met any serious resistance in Beirut.
The deployment along the coastal highway was designed to keep
militiamen from interfering with traffic along the road. The
Syrians also have closed militia offices in West Beirut as part of
the drive to halt the anarchy in the city.
The military moves coincided with efforts to reach a political so
lution to Lebanon's 12 years of factional fighting stemming from
the 1975-76 civil war. President Amin Gemayel, who is Christian,
announced that he was sending a team of advisers to Damascus to
consult with Syrian leaders about a package of proposed political
reforms.
Moslem leaders of Lebanon's sharply divided government, led by
Premier Rashid Karami, agreed on the proposals Sunday, but so
far Gemayel has neither approved nor rejected them. According to
newspaper reports, the sweeping political reforms are designed to
give the Moslems increased power in the government, reflecting
their greater numbers.
Congressmen criticize oil plan
WASHINGTON — A majority of California's congressional
delegation yesterday accused Secretary of the Interior Donald
Model of failing to give adequate attention to broad environmental
concerns in a revised five-year plan for offshore oil and gas drilling
that would open large new areas to development along the Califor
nia coast.
In a sharply worded letter to Hodel. the predominantly Demo
cratic group said the latest version of the Department of the Inte
rior s offshore leasing plan for California failed to meet legislative
requirements for "good-faith" negotiations with Congress on envi
ronmental issues and would only serve to "repolarize" the contro
versy, which has simmered since 1981.
The letter was signed by 26 of the state's 45 House members, in
cluding three of 18 Republicans. Senator Alan Cranston, a Demo
crat, and Sen. Pete Wilson, a Republican, also signed the seven
page letter.
On Feb. 2, the Interior Department unveiled new revisions to its
proposal for a long-term drilling plan that offered for the first time
to exclude parts of the Southern California coastline from oil and
gas drilling.
At the same time, however, the new plan called for opening up
13 percent of offshore areas — 6.45 million acres — previously ex
empted from development under a congressional moratorium that
expired in 1985.
Under federal law. Hodel must formally submit a final version of
the leasing plan to Congress by April. Congress then will have 60
days to approve the plan, negotiate further changes or reject it.
Schlesinger to survey embassy
WASHINGTON — The controversy surrounding the unfinished
new U.S. Embassy in Moscow has taken a new turn with the ap
pointment last week of former Secretary of Defense James
Schlesinger to make a recommendation to the State Department
on whether the Soviet-built main chancery building can be
salvaged.
In taking on the assignment, Schlesinger is stepping into heavy
cross-fire between the State Department and Congress over who is
at fault for an enterprise that has resulted in major security flaws,
a five-year delay In completion and a cost overrun that a congres
sional study estimated at *100 million.
The choice of Schlesinger, who served as secretary of defense
and later as secretary of energy in the Carter administration, and
who also served briefly as CIA director under Nixon, seems to con
firm that security is the major concern of those deciding the build
ing's fate. U.S. inspectors discovered two years ago that the Soviet
contractor that built the chancery planted "bugs" in the floors and
walls.
Seven of the eight buildings comprising the embassy complex
are finished and occupied. But all work on the main, eight-story
chancery building stopped abruptly Aug. 17. 1985. when Soviet
workers were locked out of the site because of what a State Depart
ment report calls a combination of "security concerns, congres
sional pressure (and) Soviet construction delays."
Schlesinger's assignment, according to State Department
spokeswoman Phyllis Oakley, Is to conduct a comprehensive
review and then "develop and evaluate options for ensuring the se
cure operating environment for our mission In Moscow."
