# Reagan reacts to Tower findings
## 
### 
WASHINGTON - President
Reagan admitted for the first time
yesterday that "it was a mistake"
to sell arms to Iran in return for
the freedom of American hostages
in Lebanon.
Delivering what may have been
the most critical speech of his long
political career, the president said
that what he had intended as an
overture to new Iranian leaders
"deteriorated in its implementa
tion into trading arms for
hostages."
Future national policy, Reagan
pledged, will reflect "the will of the
Congress as well as the White
House" and be "as justifiable and
understandable in public as it was
in secret."
At the same time, in an 11-
minute nationally televised speech
from the Oval Office, Reagan
sought to shift the focus of na
tional attention to the future and

lift his presidency from the politi
cal morass created by the Iran
contra scandal.
"What should happen when you
make a mistake is this: You take
your knocks, you learn your les
sons and then you move on." the
president said. "That's the health
iest way to deal with a problem.
"This in no way diminishes the
importance of the other continu
ing investigations, but the busi
ness of our country and our people
must proceed."
Reagan devoted a bare five sen
tences to the most controversial
aspect of the Iran-contra affair —
the effort to divert profits from the
Iranian arms sales to the contra
rebels fighting the Marxist regime
in Nicaragua.
"I didn't know about any diver
sion of funds to the contras," he
said. "But as president. I cannot
escape responsibility."

And Reagan delivered a fourth
explanation of his role in the ini
tial shipment of Israeli arms to
Iran in August 1985. He had told
the Tower commission, which he
appointed to investigate the con
duct of the Iran-contra affair, first
that he had approved the ship
ment, then that he had not and fi
nally that he could not remember.
In yesterday's speech, he
declared: "I did approve it; I just
can't say specifically when." He at
tributed his uncertainty to the
fact that "no one kept proper
records of meetings or decisions."
The somber address
represented the president's third
lengthy explanation of the Iran
contra affair, and the first since
the Tower commission last week
made public its harsh critique of
the president's management style.
The panel, chaired by former
Sen. John Tower, R-Texas.

accused presidential aides of con
cealing evidence from inves
tigators and faulted former CIA
Director William Casey, former
National Security Adviser John
Poindexter and Lt. Col. Oliver
North, a Poindexter aide, for not
telling the president about the di
version of funds to the contras.
"I take full responsibility for my
own actions and for those of my
administration," declared the
president. "As angry as I may be
about activities undertaken with
out my knowledge. I am still ac
countable for those activities.
"As disappointed as I may be in
some who served me. I am still the
one who must answer to the
American people for this behavior.
And as personally distasteful as I
find secret bank accounts and
diverted funds, as the Navy would
say. this happened on my watch."
