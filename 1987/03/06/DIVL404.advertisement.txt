LOOKING FOR A NIFTY SPRING QUARTER JOB?
LIKE WORKING WITH KIDS?
We are looking for someone to match wits with our two-year old
daughter in our on-campus home for two hours each weekday
afternoon (times are somewhat flexible).
You may not expect a salary, but we will pay $5.00/ hour. A car will
be very helpful, since Jennifer doesn't have one.
Please call Debbie Duncan, 725-4264 (mornings) or 327-6811
(afternoons and evenings, before 9 p.m., please!).
