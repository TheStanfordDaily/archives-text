# Lougee will resign
## 
### RUSSELL KOROBKIN Editorial Staff 
Carolyn Lougee, dean of Under
graduate Studies for the last five
years, will resign from her posi
tion at the end of the academic
year.
Acting Provost Robert Street
made the official announcement
to the Faculty Senate yesterday.
"It's time to go back to research
and teaching," said Lougee, who
is also an associate professor of
history. She added that she will go
on sabbatical next year in order to
finish a book she is writing.
"I really loved this job," she said,
explaining it is "just time to move
on to something else."
Lougee was appointed for a
three-year term as dean in Sep
tember 1982, and reappointed for
another three years in 1985. She
said she made her decision to
resign three or four months ago.
She will also resign as associate
dean of Humanities and Sciences,
a post that has allowed Lougee to
participate in decisions concern
ing budgets, salaries and tenure
issues. The dean of Undergradu
ate Studies Is automatically ap
pointed associate dean of
Humanities and Sciences.
Lougee said her accomplish
ments as dean include reorganiz
ing the Center for Teaching and
Learning, Innovative Academic
Courses and Undergraduate Re
search Opportunities. The pro
grams are "very vigorously serving
undergraduates and undergradu
ate education," she said. Lougee
also started the "writing
intensive" courses, of which there
are now about 50, and initiated a
program in which all Humanities
anclSclences departments will cri
tique their own teaching pro
grams.
Dean of Humanities and Sci
ences Norman Wessells praised
Lougee's "style," "sensitivity" and
"appreciation of what a research
university faculty can do best for
undergraduates." He said he
hopes that her successor will do as
good a job as she has, "so under
graduates will get what they
deserve."
Lougee said her replacement
will face a "continuing challenge
to develop the programs we need
for a changing student body.
"Somebody has got to be watch
ing carefully to see that under
graduate education gets its fair
share of attention." she said.
Among the ongoing projects of
her office, Lougee mentioned the
University's new orientations
toward undergraduate research
and non-Western studies, and a
restructuring of the Overseas
Studies Office.
Wessells will head a three
member committee to search for
Lougee's replacement. He said the
committee will submit a list of
candidates to the provost by "the
first of May at the latest." and by

"the middle of April with some
luck."
The provost and Wessells will
then choose Lougee's successor.
Wessells said that the new dean
must be a tenured professor at
Stanford and "ought to be an ex
cellent teacher" in order to serve
as a role model. He added that
qualifications for the position in
clude the "capacity to manage an
immense amount of work."
Wessells said he views the posi
tion as a "national leadership role,
not just a local role," as people
around the country are interested
in the opinions and judgments of
Stanford's Dean of Undergraduate
Studies.
