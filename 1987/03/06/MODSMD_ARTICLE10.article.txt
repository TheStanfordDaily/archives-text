# Law project helps East Palo Alto
## 
### MARTHA MOODY Staff writer 
This Is the second In a three-part series of
articles describing the problems facing East
Palo Alto and how Stanford volunteers are
trying to help.
Three years ago, the newly Incorporated city
of East Palo Alto had about one resident lawyer
for every 1,200 citizens, and the Stanford Law
School had only one course that enabled stu
dents to actually work with clients.
The Stanford Community Law Project
changed both of these shortcomings for the
better.
The project, conceived and initiated by a
group of Stanford law students, now provides
valuable legal services to residents of East Palo
Alto and hands-on experience to Stanford law
students.
Law students counsel East Palo Alto resi
dents in cases involving landlord/tenant
disputes and government benefits, as well as
other legal problems. They also run an Immi
gration clinic, a youth justice program and a
domestic violence program, which obtains
temporary restraining orders.
Services are available on a sliding fee scale
and about 95 percent are performed free of
charge, according to Susan Balllet, the proj
ect's former executive director.
The project was conceived in 1981 by a
group of second-year law students. One of
them, Jim Steyer, had taught In East Palo Alto
with Barbara Mouton, who Is now the city's
mayor, and other community leaders. Steyer is

a lecturer In the Political Science Department
this year.
According to Steyer, who Is also an attorney
with the NAACP. the community leaders en
couraged him to bring lawyers Into their com
munity and he decided to do so. After three
years of fund raising, Steyer and his friends
opened the East Palo Alto Community Project
In March 1984.
Mouton said the project Is "excellent," be
cause It "provides professional services ... to
people of limited or no means."
Mouton, who serves on the project's board of
directors, said the board needs to concentrate
on Informing the community about the project
through "classes, seminars, newsletters and
churches." Although over 2,400 clients have
been served since the project opened, "most
people [In East Palo Alto) probably don't know
about It," Mouton said.
Community education Is a top priority for
the project, according to Law Prof. Bill Hane,
who has been the temporary executive director
of the project since Balllet resigned last Decem
ber. Hane said the project Is "committed not
only to legal services, but to doing community
outreach and education." In addition, the proj
ect seek to use "both vehicles — community
education and legal service delivery — to teach
students to do both."
Between one-third and one-half of the Stan
ford law students are involved in the project,
according to Peggy Russell, a law school
graduate who helped start the project and now
serves on Its board of directors. Some students
provide legal services or community education,
while others help govern and manage the pro
ject.

Work at the project is now part of the regu
larly assigned coursework In several law
classes. Since it is not necessary to be an attor
ney in order to represent a client at an admin
istrative hearing, many students can handle
these cases independently.
Under California law. a student who has
taken certain classes, including Civil Proce
dures and Evidence, can represent a client at a
hearing or trial, provided an attorney Is pres
ent to supervise, according to Balllet. There
are currently six lawyers at the project, four of
whom are employed by the project and two of
whom are affiliated with the Immigration Le
gal Resources Center.
The Stanford Law School was not officially
Involved with the student-run project until the
fall of 1985, when the school voted to make it
an official program. In the fall of 1986, Law
School Dean John Hart Ely committed
• 150,000 a year to the project, or one-half of
the project's annual budget.
The law school will solicit donations for the
project from foundations and individuals,
some of whom will be suggested by the Univer
sity Development Office, according to Hane.
Hane said that the law school development
staff has told the development office that the
project is its top fundraising priority.
Any of the ♦ 150,000 that the law school does
not secure through fund-raising efforts will
come out of its own budget, Hane said.
Despite this financial support from the law
school, the project has "maintained its status
as an independent non-profit" corporation, ac
cording to Steyer, because its "first commit
ment" is not to the law school, but to the resi
dents of East Palo Alto.
