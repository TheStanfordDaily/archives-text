Two weeks ago, things were not looking
very good for the Stanford men's basketball
team. After back-to-back losses on the road
in Washington, the Cardinal seemed headed
for another season below .500. Then the
team came home and something special hap
pened.
First, the team stunned the hated Califor
nia Bears, with the home crowd standing
throughout the game to cheer them on. Then
Arizona came to town planning on an easy
victory, but Howard Wright's last-second
jumper changed those plans. The Cardinal
came away with another win. This time the
crowd stormed the court to congratulate the
team. Stanford students on the basketball
court? Where did they think they were?
Duke? Notre Dame?
The fans came out one more time to watch
Eric Reveno and company defeat Arizona
State in an overtime thriller. The win meant
a .500 conference record and a bye in the
first round of the Pacific 10 Conference
Postseason Tournament that begins tonight
in Los Angeles. The hometown fans might

not be there, but don't count Stanford out
just yet. There are four more players to com
plement Reveno — surely the most Improved
player in the conference this year. Sopho
more Todd Lichti excels at every facet of the
game and seems to get better each time out.
So does sophomore Teriy Taylor, an excellent
ballhandler whose ability to shoot three
pointers adds another dimension to the
Stanford attack.
There is also Wright, who is playing with
renewed intensity and sparking the crowd
with his slam dunks. Rounding out the
starters is senior Novian Whitsitt, who has
gotten a few dunks of his own lately and
helped to hold the young team together at
crunch time.
If Stanford defeats Washington tonight
and wins again on Saturday, it just might
face UCLA in the finals. A couple of upsets,
especially one over the Bruins at Pauley Pavil
lion, would give the team a berth in the NCAA
tournament, and a place in the big time.
Good luck to the Cardinal.
