# Really a melting pot?

### 
University President Donald Kennedy and Dean of
, Admissions Jean Fetter always pride themselves on
' the fact that Stanford's diverse student body mirrors
, our society. The University purposely devotes a con
siderable amount of resources to bring about this di
• versity because the Administration feels that it is im
' _portant for Stanford students to confront the diver
sity of their own national generation and to learn to
live with it. Ideally, this diversity provides many op
portunities for everyone to explore other cultures
' and to learn about each others' unique backgrounds
' and experiences. But how much do we really partake
* of that diversity in our daily lives? How much do we
| actually interact with each other outside of classes?
■ When we do interact, how much do we really share
! our true selves?

From my personal experience, I think most stu
• dents tend to socialize only with others of similar
J background, and they tend to form groups with a
» fairly homogeneous membership. A fair example of
| this is the fraternal system, in which like-minded in
, dlvlduals are housed together and possibly separated
>. from he others in the community. Moreover, there is
' the BSU for blacks, MEChA for Hispanics, the AASA
| for Asian-Americans and so on.
Even though some of them try to reach out and
, share their heritage with the rest of the community,
rarely do others take advantage of this opportunity.
The net result seems to be that each group is isolated
, from the others. This separation can also be ob
• served in dining halls: Tables are often occupied by
homogeneous groups, in which there are only males
or females, or whites or members of an ethnic group.
The lack of interest in learning about other ethnic
groups is reflected in the unpopularity of ethnic
theme houses, as indicated by the low priority for
■ these houses on students' Draw cards. Furthermore,
, not everyone assigned to a theme house enjoys the
experience, and at times whites feel alienated be
cause residents are so closely tied to their own ethnic
, community. To a certain extent, I feel that our
diverse student body is not really a melting pot of
people, but a collection of groups.
The underlying problem, I believe, is the
" troublesome human tendency for like to associate
only with like and the human prejudice to value only
one's own culture. As a result there Is a lack of inter
est and appreciation for other ethnic cultures.
Therefore, simply bringing students of different eth
nic backgrounds to Stanford does not achieve its in

tended purpose because students will most likely
separate Into groups along racial and ethnic lines,
just as oil and water will naturally separate when
they are put together. Something needs to be done in
order to achieve a good mix — in order to get stu
dents to savor Stanford's diversity. This missing in
gredient is an appreciation for diversity.
Stanford's success in shaping this attitude in its
students will have profound implications for racial
relations in our society. Various demographic
studies indicate that by 2012, whites will no longer
be the majority in California and Hispanics will
become the largest ethnic minority group. If existing
attitudes persist, I am afraid that racial tensions will
rise as the state's demographics change.
I realize that efforts in reaching out and sharing
activities with someone of another ethnic group may
feel uncomfortable at first, but I can assure you that
the awkwardness will soon disappear. Being an
Asian-American living in CroMem last year, I often
felt isolated from people outside of my discipline
(electrical engineering) and ethnic group. But I
resisted the temptation to associate only with people
of similar background and persisted in reaching out
to other people in classrooms and dining halls.
I know how uncomfortable it can be to keep intro
ducing yourself to strangers who may be unreceptive
to your friendliness. But having done this for over a
year, I have gotten to know a good cross section of
Stanford's diverse community. This experience has
made me a more sensitive, empathetic person, open
to friendships with people of other backgrounds.
I find that I benefited most from these friendships
when I talked about things that truly matter to me
and shared my concerns and anxieties with closer
friends. In the process, it has made me more confi
dent of who I am and firmer in my appreciation of my
own heritage as well as that of others. Even though I
have invested a lot of effort to overcome the initial
awkwardness, I now truly feel I am a part of the Stan
ford community. Reflecting on my experience here, I
think it is one of the most worthwhile and important
things I have done.
I invite you to join me in a similar adventure — to
reach out and savor Stanford's diversity. Donald
Kennedy once said: "Overcome the limitations of
your own background, whatever that may be, and
eagerly confront other views, other convictions,
other ways of doing things. ... I am urging upon
you something beyond tolerance: active exploration,
risk-taking exposure, a yearning to understand and
a willingness to change. To tolerate diversity is not
what we aim for. We aim to celebrate it." I agree
wholeheartedly.
