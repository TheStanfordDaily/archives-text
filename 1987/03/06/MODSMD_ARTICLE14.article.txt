Israeli justice
. is as atrocious
as Holocaust
John Demjanjuk, or "Ivan the
Terrible" as the press Is fond of
referring to him. stands accused
of committing crimes against the
Jewish people, crimes against
humanity, war crimes and crimes
against persecuted persons. He Is
supposed to have gouged out
eyes, cut off women's breasts,
lopped off ears and participated
In the gassing of approximately
850.000 Jews between 1942 and
1943.
There Is no question that the
Nazis committed many heinous
deeds before and during World
War 11. Some may argue that I am
wrong In comparing the two. but
I feel that America Is committing
a similar atrocity by allowing
John Demjanjuk to be tried In
Israel. While the horrific acts of
the Nazis touched the lives of
millions and were unquestionably
more graphic in nature, they are
on the same philosophical plane
as our passivity during Demjan-
Juk's trial (I hesitate even to use
the word trial to describe the
circus-like proceedings — the
verdict, for all effective purposes,

has already been rendered).
As a people, the Israelis have a
chip on their shoulder and the
taste of blood in their mouth. The
way in which they are trying
Demjanjuk is as bigoted and
cruelly unfair as the Nazis' treat
ment of the Jews. Our permitting
it is equally atrocious. By allow
ing them to try Demjanjuk, we
are contradicting all tenets of our
judicial code.
The Israelis are billing the spec
tacle as a "showcase trial." one
that is supposed to teach Israeli
youth about the Holocaust. Yeah.
I bet. Currently proceedings are
being held in a movie theater
filled with hyperemotlonal Jews
who alternate between cheering
and crying. Demjanjuk has been
forced to sit on a wooden stage
throughout the "kangaroo court"
proceedings. The entire grotesque
extravaganza of blind revenge
reeks of the same Idiocy that
motivated the Salem witch trials.
Guilt or Innocence in such
cases should be determined by
the objective courts of non
partisan countries — that Is.
those who have the best interests
of humanity in mind but whose
view of the situation is not
jaundiced by direct involvement.
If It is impossible to find a
country that fits the above bill, a
global committee, similar in com
position to the World Court (but

designed for the trial of individ
uals rather than nations) could,
and most certainly should, be
formed to insure that justice be
served.

I wonder if it would make any
sense to ask the Stanford faculty
and the Stanford Administration
when they appear in public to
tinkle a warning bell and mur
mur, "Unclean, unclean," because
they seem to harbor a Democratic
Party "connection?"
Would I be Justified in asking
for so drastic a display of con
science because the notables who
seem to have a monopoly on Stan
ford's sacred occasions are Demo
crats; specifically. Governor
Cuomo of New York, former
Speaker of the House Tip O'Neill
of Massachusetts and President
Jimmy Carter?
I'm only asking.

The only thing useful about
Scott Lyon's recent column
(Daily, March 2) was the title —
"Diatribes not useful." Unfortun
ately. he proved this point by
following with an absolutely use
less diatribe. The mix of poor
logic, inexplicable argumentation
and rabid conservatism defies
rational response. Mr. Lyon's
column is inflammatory and
emotional, and thus will fail to
generate constructive discussion
about complex issues.
The editorial staff of The Stan
