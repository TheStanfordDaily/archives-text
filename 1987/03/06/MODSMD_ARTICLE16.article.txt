The most recent controversies involving the
Ronald Reagan Presidential Library point to what
should have been recognized by the University long
ago. The decision to welcome the library at Stanford
is a huge victory for the Hoover Institution and has
proved, is proving and will continue to prove to be a
great and dangerous embarrassment to the Univer
sity.
Many facets of the acceptance by Stanford of the
Reagan Library are distasteful to the academic inde
pendence of the University. A partisan foundation
led by Hoover officials is running around raising
money for the library and its public affairs center. It
can be reasonably assumed that many of the funds
for the project will come from individuals wishing to
honor President Reagan, not from individuals who
care about adding another academic resource to
Stanford University.

It is particularly distressing that the University
has rolled over and played dead for the Hoover Insti
tution and the Ronald Reagan Presidential Founda
tion. The University should have taken a more active
role in the project, instead of letting Hoover run the
show. Stanford has put itself in the position of being
at the mercy of the foundation, which is being run by
W. Glenn Campbell, the director of Hoover. From the
beginning, it has been the efforts of the Hoover Insti
tution that brought the Reagan Library to Stanford.
Reagan approves of having his papers kept here be
cause the Hoover Institution is here. The only rele
vant action of the University was Its mistake in ac
cepting the proposal. Whether or not Stanford
declares it is inappropriate for the University to
boast of a Reagan connection, Campbell, Hoover and
the foundation seem to be perfectly willing to do so
on the University's behalf.
Last week, the acting president of the University,
James Rosse, wrote a letter to Campbell asking for
information regarding the foundation's plans for the
location of the Ronald Reagan Public Affairs Center.
A few years ago. when the University demanded ul
timate control over the public affairs center if it was
to be located on campus, the foundation refused and
decided to locate the center off campus. Now,
Campbell will not divulge plans regarding the contro
versial center. The University is on the sidelines
looking very foolish, as the Reagan project remains a
Hoover production. The project is clearly not in the
hands of the University, and it should be. Now we
have Rosse worrying about how big the Hoover
Tower is depicted in an architectural rendering of
the library used for fund-raising purposes. Someone
should make a surrealistic movie out of the Univer
sity Administration's thoughts and actions during
this whole debacle.

Furthermore, whether or not the University is will
ing to boast of a Reagan connection is a moot point.
The decision to accept the library and the public af
fairs center, despite its unknown off-campus loca
tion, represents a tacit, but very strong, endorse
ment of the Reagan presidency. In Washington,
D.C., I have told conservative people that I attend
Stanford University, and they have given me a slap of
approval and told me how lucky I am to be at a school
where the Hoover Institution is located and where
the Reagan Library will be located. Their praise has
nothing to do with the scholarly attributes of the
Hoover and the library; it has much to do with the
political bent with which they associate Stanford.
When I tell liberal people in Washington where I go to
school, they often frown and say: "That's such a con
servative place, isn't it?" When I ask what they mean,
they say, "Well, the Hoover Institution is at Stanford
and the Reagan Library is going to be there." The
point is that no matter what the University does —
from changing the seating capacity of a conference
room at the library to refusing to allow an indepen
dent public affairs center on campus — the public
image of a Stanford/Hoover/Reagan link is fortified.
The Hoover Institution is already irrevocably tied to
Reagan's presidency, library and public affairs cen
ter; Stanford has long been Irrevocably tied to the
Hoover Institution. Despite the fact that the Univer
sity has refused to let the library display hard hats
worn by Reagan on campaign stops and has refused
the public afffairs center, a public perception is per
petuated that Stanford has been captured by well
financed partisan interests.
In addition, the weak role played by the University
in the development of the library project allows an ex
panded role for Hoover in the administration of Stan
ford affairs, which is completely unacceptable. Uni
versity officials have denied that Hoover's role is ex
panding. yet it is the Hoover that brought us the
Reagan library and it is Hoover officials that run the
foundation bringing us the library and center. The
University should be more interested in distancing
itself from the Hoover and reasserting the indepen
dence between the two institutions, instead of
taking up the Reagan Library project, which is pro
viding a solid link between them.
I am not doubting in the least that the University's
greatest intention in welcoming the Reagan Library
was to gain the excellent academic resource of all the
documentation from a very important eight-year
presidency. This is the one facet of the acceptance
that is favorable; the library is an academic asset.
The question is, at what price?
The presence of the Hoover Institution at Stanford
has already damaged the University's reputation for
academic independence and integrity; the mire of
the Reagan Library is a greater soiling of Stanford's
reputation. As even the recent petty controversies
have demonstrated, the soiling will continue to
damage the University.
