## The
						most sought-after job on campus 
### BRYAN COOPERRIDER 
As a prospective freshman, one
may have admired their vast
knowledge of the Stanford cam
pus. They can be seen walking
around with a group of people fol
lowing them. They have the most
sought-after job on campus: Stan
ford tour guides.
The tour guide services started
in 1941 with the opening of
Hoover Tower. The program ex
panded from small tours of Hoover
Tower, the Medical Center and the
Stanford Museum to the many
services offered today.
With 85,000 visitors serviced a
year, the Tour Guide and Visitors
Service offers dally tours that start
In fornt of the Quad at 11 a.m.
and 2:15 p.m. The service also
runs the Information booth there
and the reception area at Hoover
Tower.
Since it is one of the most
wanted jobs on campus, it is not
easy to become a tour guide. This
quarter, there were three
openings: 45 students applied.
Fall quarter, when it is easiest to
get a job, has perhaps eight or
nine openings.
It may be tough to get a job, but
nevertheless "we encourage people
to apply again because it is diffi
cult to chose so few students from
the many applications we receive,"

said Olga Valencla-Pardo. the stu
dent program coordinator for the
tour service.
"Many of the guides working
now were not hired the first time
they applied," she added.
"We're mainly looking for en
thusiasm," said Valencla-Pardo.
"But we also want a diverse group
of students — students with dif
ferent majors, for example."
Tour guides work part time.
Most students put in approxi
mately six hours per week. There
are currently 38 guides, 31 of
whom are regular workers, the
rest being substitutes. Hours are
assigned every quarter by a lottery
system.
After they are hired, the new
guides are given an information
packet and a sample tour. In addi
tion, new employees have to tag
along on two regular tours with
more experienced guides.
Senior Mike Cole, who has been
a tour guide for four years, ex
plained why he thought so many
people want to become guides:
"You get to meet a lot of exciting
people, and It's certainly more fun
than hashing."
"Tours are a lot of fun and It's
really neat to learn about Stanford
and Its history," said Damon Ras
kin, who began giving tours this
quarter.
"You've got to like Stanford

enough to tell other people how
great it is. We want to give visitors
a positive image," said Valencla-
Pardo.
Senior Scott Gable, one of the
most experienced of the campus
guides, emphasized that, for most
people, "the tour guide service
may be the only contact they have
with the University. It's important
that we be accurate."
A tour guide has to be versatile
and creative in order to capture
his or her audience's attention.
The structure of the tour
"depends on what the group is
like," said Christ! Almquist, a
junior. "I think little kids are the
best; they always ask ridiculous

questions," she added with a
laugh.
Cole agreed with Almquist.
"Little kids are a lot of fun. They
ask entertaining questions like:
You mean you don't have to go to
class if you don't want to?' or 'Why
is that ugly building there?' It
makes you think — why is that
ugly building there?"
"I had a little kid once who was
convinced that missiles were
stored in Hoover Tower," Gable
said.
Anybody can attend the daily
tours, but often arrangements are
made for special tours. Sometimes
certain groups want to emphasize
a particular area. A group of

librarians, for example, may want
to see more of the libraries. Pro
spective freshmen might want to
see the dormitories.
"Just recently I gave a tour to a
group of deaf people through an
Interpreter." Gable said.
"Once I gave a tour to a bunch of
little kids from Japan who came
with movie cameras." said
Valencia-Pardo. "It turns out they
were in a contest to see who could
send the best message to E.T.
They went up to the Dish after the
tour."
However, "tour guiding doesn't
always mean giving tours,"
Almquist pointed out. The guides
also work the Information booth
in front of the Quad as well as
various positions in Hoover
Tower.
"It adds quite a bit of diversity,"
Gable said. But on the other hand.
"It can get kind of boring just sit
ting In the info booth handing out
maps for two hours," Cole added.
Many of the guides use stories of
student life to enhance their
tours. "People love the story about
kissing In the Quad during a full
moon," Gable said.
Tour guides have to be sensitive
to their audience. "Pro fros want
to hear about student life, but
senior citizens would rather hear
about history," Valencia-Pardo
said.

Every tour Is different. "We re
quire the guides to give three spe
cial (pre-arranged group) tours a
quarter so It keeps them from fall
ing Into one routine," Valencla-
Pardo added.
During spring quarter, a special
tour will be added every day from
April 10 to April 30 for students
who have been admitted to the
class of 1991.
All the tour guides agree that
the most often asked questions
concern admissions. "You'd be
amazed at the rumors that get
spread around this country about
Stanford," said Cole. "Some
people think that you have to have
a 4.0 (GPA) to get in or be the child
of alumni."
Most people just ask what It
takes to get in to Stanford or how
their child can get In. "People
don't realize that we have nothing
to do with admissions," said
Valencla-Pardo.
There's always a variety of ques
tions. "People always ask me
about walking backwards (while
giving the tour)," said Gable. "I've
tripped over a dog, and once I
backed in to a chair and fell right
into it."
Questions range from the types
of trees in the Quad to the number
of volumes in the library. But
nevertheless, it's all in the line of
duty of a tour guide.
