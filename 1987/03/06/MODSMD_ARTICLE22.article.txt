## Card takes on Huskies in tourney; Lichti unanimous All-Pac-10 pick 
### SUSAN SLUSSER Editorial staff 
Even before stepping on to the court at
Pauley Pavilion for the second round of play in
the Pacific 10 Conference Post-Season Tourna
ment, the Stanford men's basketball team
received good news: Sophomore forward Todd
Lichti was named a unanimous selecion to the
Pac-10 All-Conference team yesterday.
Oregon State center Jose Ortiz, who
averaged 22.3 and 8.7 rebounds per game for
the Beavers, was named the league's Player of
the Year. Other unanimous selections to the
team were Reggie Miller of UCLA, Chris Welp of
Washington, Derrick Dowell of USC and Cali
fornia's Kevin Johnson.
UCLA's Jerome "Pooh" Richardson. Steve
Beck of Arizona State. Anthony Taylor of
Oregon and Washington's Phil Zevenbergen
rounded out the all-conference selections.
Meanwhile, the Pac-10 tournament got un
der way in Los Angeles last night as Arizona
State beat Washington State, 76-60. and
Oregon defeated USC, 51-49. to advance to
second-round action.
Stanford, which bypassed the opening
round by virtue of a sixth-place finish in the
conference (15-12 overall. 9-9 in the Pac-10).
will meet the Washington Huskies tonight at 7
p.m. (KCBS 740 AM, KZSU 90.1 FM). Wash
ington (16-13, 10-8) finished up in a three-way
tie for third with Cal and Oregon State, but
earned the third seed in the tournament after
a regular-season sweep of first-place UCLA.
The Cardinal, which won Its final three
games of the season against Cal, Arizona and
Arizona State, was picked by six of 10 confer

ence coaches as the "darkhorse" of the tourna
ment.
"It's nice." said Lichti, who is just nine
points away from becoming the first player in
Stanford history to score 1,000 points as a
sophomore. "It shows we've gained a little
respect. But I think we have to go out and play
hard and not let up; we have to do the same
things we've been doing and not worry about
what people are saying."
"They're certainly not picking us as the
favorites or anything," Stanford Coach Mike
Montgomery said. "I never knew what
darkhorse' meant — I guess it means we're not
horrible. It's not completely outside the realm
of possibility that we could win this thing."
In order for Stanford to win "this thing," the
Cardinal will first have to get by the Huskies —
a tall order, literally. Washington center Welp,
last season's Pac-10 Player of the Year, stands
seven feet tall. Forward Zevenbergen, who
scored 24 points against Stanford the last time
the two teams met, is 6-foot-11.
The two seniors combine for most of the
Huskies' offense, as Welp averages 21 points
per game, and Zevenbergen adds 16. The pair
also account for most of the rebounding; Welp
pulls down 9.1 boards a game, while Zevenber
gen totals 8.7 rebounds per game.
"I think it's going to be a tough battle."
Lichti said. "They've got the two big guys; we
have to stop them inside, keep them off the
boards and play good defense."
The last time the two teams squared off, a
70-65 Husky win Feb. 14 at Washington, the
Cardinal held Welp to just 13 points and three
rebounds. The West German spent much of
the game on the bench with foul trouble,
playing just 22 minutes.

"That was kind of coincidental," Washington
Coach Andy Russo said. "He hasn't really been
in foul trouble much. Chris has a tendency to
try and defend before they catch the ball; that's
not the way to defend inside, especially as
physical as those kids (Stanford) are."
Physical will be the key word for tonight's
contest, if the previous two games between the
squads are any indication. "Inside it was
pretty doggone tough," Montgomery said.
"Intitially (at Washington) the officials decided
to let things go, and from then on it was bar
ricade the door in there."
"1 think you're looking at the two most physi
cal teams in the league." Russo said. "I would
characterize our two earlier games as being
that way — physical, tough, hard-fought. They
have real good size, we have good size. Prob
ably the game will be decided by how the other
players play."
The other players for Washington include
forward Kevin Vidato (4.6 points per game)
and guards Greg Hill (11.1 points per game)
and Eldridge Recasner (8.0 points per game).
Stanford, although not nearly as big inside
as the Huskies, will nonetheless be relying
primarily on its front line — particularly 6-8
forward Eric Reveno, who finished the regular
season on a tear, scoring 17 points against
Arizona and a career-high 28 points against
Arizona State in the last week of the regular
season.
"He's a very good player," Russo said. "He's
hurt us . . . both times we've played Stanford.
He's playing with a lot of confidence and a lot of
intensity. We'll have to stop him and Todd
Lichti if we want to entertain thoughts of
going any further."
