# Women's hoops falls to Oregon at home
## 
### CHRIS CRADER Staff writer 
Very few people fear ducks. If
fact, most people think ducks are
rather funny creatures. But after
tonight's game, the Stanford
women's basketball team knows
better. The Oregon Ducks were In
control almost the whole game en
route to a 63-54 win.
Stanford Is now 13-14 overall
and 7-10 In the Pacific 10 Confer
ence, while Oregon (22-5, 14-3) is
in first place in conference.
Things began well for the Card
inal, as the team opened a 12-4
lead, but Oregon came back from
the inside and outside. Inside
were 6-foot-7 Stephanie Kasperski
and 6-5 Gabi Neumann, while
bombing away from the outside
were Carol Drouet and Pac-10
Player of the Year Laurl Lander
holm.
Stanford got into foul trouble in
the first half, and Oregon went
ahead 16-14, maintaining a four
or six-point lead the rest of the
half. At intermission, the
scoreboard read Oregon 32, Stan
ford 26.
"We got into foul trouble, which
hurt us a lot," Stanford Coach
Tara VanDerveer said, adding that
"some shots just weren't falling."
The second half was more of the
same. Stanford would score a few,
then the Ducks would come back
with a basket or two of their own.
With just under 10 minutes left,
however, the Cardinal began an
eight-point spurt to tie the game
at 53.
The Ducks didn't give in
though, as they then went on a
10-1 tear of their own to produce
the final margin.
A telling statistic was Stanford's
.381 field-goal percentage, well
below Its .441 average, "We just
need to score better against a 2-3

zone," VanDerveer said. "They
take up a lot of space inside, (and)
we weren't able to score against
their zone from the outside."
The biggest part of the Card
inal's woes was caused by an un
friendly basket, as the squad's top
four scorers on the year shot 14
for 42 from the field, a .333 clip.
An additional problem was the
slow tempo of the game.
"It was a half-court game," Van-
Derveer said. "We weren't able to
get into the full-court game. (And)
we weren't able to get second
shots."
The high point for the Cardinal,
in addition to playing the league
leaders close, belonged to fresh
man point guard Jennifer Azzi.
She broke the Stanford season as
sist record of 151 by recording 10
last night, raising her total to 161.
It was also her fourth game with
10 assists or more, another
record.
Azzl now needs only seven more
assists to move into fifth on the
Stanford all-time list.
Landerholm and Drouet led four
Ducks in double digits with 16
and 12 points, respectively. Soph
omore center Jill Yanke led Stan
ford with 13 points, followed by
senior Kim Mercer and freshman
Katy Steding with 10 each. Yanke
and Steding also had 10 rebounds
apiece, with Steding recording her
double-double in only 18 minutes
due to foul trouble and a minor
ankle injury.
The Cardinal will have quite a
different test on Its hands tomor
row night when the team takes on
the Oregon State Beavers.
"They're a totally different team,"
VanDerveer said. "They're very
quick and aggressive."
The Beavers are also much
smaller, with their tallest starter
standing 6-1. They are led by for

ward Monica Raspberry and guard
Chelle Flamoe. who between them
are averaging over 32 points per
game.
The Cardinal will have revenge
on its mind in its last contest of
the season as well. Stanford lost
70-53 at Corvallis in January.
Stanford will also be going for its
first .500 season since 1982-83.
The contest should be a close

one, as Stanford. California and
OSU are fighting for fifth to
seventh spots in the conference
standings. "I think it'll be a real
challenge." said VanDerveer. At
the game, to be held at Maples
Pavilion beginning at 7:30 p.m..
the NCAA champion men's water
polo team and the women's volley
ball team, which reached the na
tional semifinals, will be honored.

zone," VanDerveer said. "They
take up a lot of space inside, (and)
we weren't able to score against
their zone from the outside."
The biggest part of the Card
inal's woes was caused by an un
friendly basket, as the squad's top
four scorers on the year shot 14
for 42 from the field, a .333 clip.
An additional problem was the
slow tempo of the game.
"It was a half-court game," Van-
Derveer said. "We weren't able to
get into the full-court game. (And)
we weren't able to get second
shots."
The high point for the Cardinal,
in addition to playing the league
leaders close, belonged to fresh
man point guard Jennifer Azzi.
She broke the Stanford season as
sist record of 151 by recording 10
last night, raising her total to 161.
It was also her fourth game with
10 assists or more, another
record.
Azzl now needs only seven more
assists to move into fifth on the
Stanford all-time list.
Landerholm and Drouet led four
Ducks in double digits with 16
and 12 points, respectively. Soph
omore center Jill Yanke led Stan
ford with 13 points, followed by
senior Kim Mercer and freshman
Katy Steding with 10 each. Yanke
and Steding also had 10 rebounds
apiece, with Steding recording her
double-double in only 18 minutes
due to foul trouble and a minor
ankle injury.
The Cardinal will have quite a
different test on Its hands tomor
row night when the team takes on
the Oregon State Beavers.
"They're a totally different team,"
VanDerveer said. "They're very
quick and aggressive."
The Beavers are also much
smaller, with their tallest starter
standing 6-1. They are led by for

ward Monica Raspberry and guard
Chelle Flamoe. who between them
are averaging over 32 points per
game.
The Cardinal will have revenge
on its mind in its last contest of
the season as well. Stanford lost
70-53 at Corvallis in January.
Stanford will also be going for its
first .500 season since 1982-83.
The contest should be a close

one, as Stanford. California and
OSU are fighting for fifth to
seventh spots in the conference
standings. "I think it'll be a real
challenge." said VanDerveer. At
the game, to be held at Maples
Pavilion beginning at 7:30 p.m..
the NCAA champion men's water
polo team and the women's volley
ball team, which reached the na
tional semifinals, will be honored.
