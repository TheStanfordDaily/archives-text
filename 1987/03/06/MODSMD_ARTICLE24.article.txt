# Next up for baseball: Defending champion Arizona, Heredia
## 
### JOHN LIS Editorial staff 
Submitted for your approval:
a theory on how the Stanford
baseball schedule took on its
present form. Blame Fred Har
gadon.
The scenario works like this:
Frustrated high school student
is rejected from Stanford by
Hargadon. Years later, above
mentioned Individual becomes
schedule-maker for the Pacific
10 Southern Division. Mo
tivated by vengeance, he gives
Stanford an early-season Six-
Pac slate not for the faint of
heart.
The above is only a hypothe
sis. But consider that the Card
inal opened the Six-Pac season
with three games at preseason
favorite UCLA. This week, the
Cardinal hosts defending NCAA
champion Arizona. Random
chance? We think not.
The second-place Wildcats
enter Sunken Diamond for
today's 2 p.m. game ranked
ninth in the nation by Baseball
America, a half-game behind
UCLA for the Six-Pac lead with
a 4-2 record. 14-5 overall. The
teams will also meet tomorrow
and Sunday at 1 p.m. (All
games will be broadcast on
KZSU 90.1 FM.)
The Cardinal managed to
pull out a win last Sunday at
UCLA after watching its
heralded pitching staff sur
render 31 runs in two losses.
Stanford, ranked No. 1 1 by
Baseball America, is in fourth
place in the Six-Pac with a 1-2
mark, two games behind UCLA.

Stanford Is 12-8 overall.
The Cardinal staff got back
on the right track Tuesday,
though, as Rob Wassenaar, Lee
Plemel and Steve Chltren
combined for a five-hit, 7-0
shutout of the University of
San Francisco.
Plemel will get the start today
after his three innings of no-hit
ball Tuesday. Jack McDowell,
the ace of the Stanford staff,
has been hampered by injuries
but will throw tomorrow. On
sunday, "we'll see whoever's
left," according to Stanford
Asst. Coach Dean Stotz.
"We're going to throw every
one we need to on Friday to get
the win, except McDowell,"
Stotz said. "Arizona has so
many new faces, it's hard to tell
who we'll throw Sunday. It
depends on who scares us the
Chltren was in the rotation
at UCLA, but surrendered five
hits, five walks and five earned
runs in 4 2/3 innings of work
in the 14-5 loss Saturday and
gave up two hits In an inning of
work against USF. Against the
Dons, Wassenaar lowered his
team-leading ERA to 1.33,
which "didn't hurt his chances
any," according to Coach Mark
Marquess. A 1 Osuna — the
team's only left-hander — and
Jim Price are also possible
starters.
Plemel will face Arizona's Gil
bert Heredia today, whom Stotz
called "the most consistent
pitcher in the conference."
Heredia is 4-0 this year with a
