LONG BEACH - After the Stan
ford men's swimming team blis
tered the Pacific 10 Conference
championships with 11 NCAA
standard swims, qualifying six
more swimmers for the March
final. Stanford Coach Skip Ken
ney made his declaration.
"This was the best first day
we've ever had," he said.
Given that the Cardinal has won
the last five Pac-10 champion
ships. Kenney's words were rather
special.
But then, so were his team's
times. Competing in"the weakest
day"in terms of projected point to
tals, Stanford clawed back from a
41 -point deficit from last week's
diving results to take the first-day
lead after four events.
California followed closely Stan
ford's 237 points with 210. UCLA.

USC and Arizona State followed at
a distant third, fourth and fifth.
Asked if he was surprised by the
strong performance, Kenney said,
"with this team I've learned to
think big. This (performance)
doesn't exceed my expectations."
Stanford made its first big
waves in the opening 500-yard
freestyle, an event that boasted
the likes of Olympian Jeff Kostoff
of Stanford, and NCAA record
holder Mike O'Brien and fresh
man long-course sensation Dan
Jorgenson. both of USC.
Positioned in the unfamiliar
eighth lane, an unshaved Kostoff
grabbed the early lead and staved
off a persistent O'Brien for the top
finish.
"I came in not feeling all that
well. Tonight. I decided to have a
couple cups of coffee and Just see
what happens." he said.
Kostoff had other "coffee ach
ievers" on his side, namely John

Witchel. Lunn Lestina and Dave
Louden. With their swims. Le
stina and Louden joined Witchel
and Kostoff as NCAA qualifiers.
Louden, who had a disappointing
preliminary swim, bounced back
to record his NCAA standard in
the preconsolation finals.
Then the Cardinal stage was set
for the Matt Nance show. A year of
"wasted time" due to mono
nucleosis well in the past, a more
relaxed Nance swam a superb 200
individual medley race, earning
first place and a trip to the NCAAs.
The race was "faster than any
thing I thought I would go. After
last year, this (the victory) was
super-gratifying."
While the Cardinal celebrated
the efforts of Nance and fellow in
dividual medley cohort Byron Bur
son. who also turned in a fine
NCAA-qualifying swim, freshman

Freshman Lunn Lustina hit his NCAA qualifying time in the 500 freestyle last night in the Pacific 10 Con
ference swimming championships with a 4:23.42 mark. The qualifying standard is 4:23.65.
Doug Llllydahl quietly started to
prepare his surprise to the team
In the 50 freestyle.
Indeed, with most of the atten
tion focused on Cal's Matt Biondl,
Llllydahl stunned onlookers by
pressing Biondl to the finish,
losing by only one hundredth a
second.
"My thrill this year was
supposed to be swimming next to
Matt Biondl, not pushing him in
the Pac-10 championships," Lll
lydahl said. "I'm happy that I have
three weeks before the NCAAs so I
can convince myself that this hap
pened."
The 400 medley relay cul
minated the Cardinal day in fine
fashion. Both the Stanford men's
A and B medley relay teams
qualified for NCAAs. Kirk
Kroesche added the final touch by
touching home one last NCAA
qualifying time In his backstroke
leg.
