# Women netters face Texas and Trinity
## 
### KEN STEVENS Editorial staff 
With just over a month of the
season completed, the defending
national champion Stanford
women's tennis team has already
lost more dual matches than it did
in the entire 1986 season.
And the immediate future won't
be any easier for the Cardinal, as
traditional powers Texas and
Trinity visit the Stanford Tennis
Stadium this weekend.
Texas, ranked No. 6 in the
preseason poll, will bring a perfect
5-0 record to tomorrow's 1 p.m.
match. The Longhorns, who have
never played at Stanford, are led
by a potent one-two combination
at the top of the singles ladder.
Beverly Bowes, one of the top
baseline players in college tennis,
plays at No. 1 for Texas and has a
9-1 overall record in 1987. Bowes,
ranked third in the preseason
singles poll, advanced to the NCAA
semifinals last year in Austin
before losing to Stanford's Patty
Fendick 6-2, 6-4. Fendick went on
to win the title.
In tomorrow's match, Bowes
will get another shot at Fendick,
who, according to Stanford Coach
Frank Brennan, will be ready as
usual. "Patty's up for every
match," he said. "At No. 1, you al
ways play somebody tough. Patty's
had good luck with Bowes. She

hasn't lost to her."
The return of Anne Grousbeck
to the Texas lineup has been the
most Instrumental factor In the
Longhorns' return to the top 10
after a one-year hiatus. Grousbeck
was Injured for most of the 1986
season, but her performance In
the NCAA singles draw demon
strated her ability, as she almost
upset Trinity's top-seeded
Gretchen Rush. Playing at No. 2
this season, Grousbeck is 13-2
overall.
Both Bowes and Grousbeck
have been banged up recently, ac
cording to Brennan. However,
"they're probably going to play,"
he said.
Trinity was fourth — ahead of
Texas — in the preseason
rankings, but the graduation of
Rush and a demanding schedule
have resulted in a mediocre 5-4
start. Stanford will be Trinity's
ninth top-25 opponent. The
Tigers most recently lost on March
2 by a 5-4 score to 12th-ranked
Florida.
Either Ann Hulbert or Jane
Holdren will be at No. 1 singles for
Trinity in Sunday's match, which
is scheduled to start at noon. Hul
bert and Holdren have taken turns
occupying the top two spots, with
Hulbert recording a 2-4 mark so
far this season and Holdren
notching a 6-3 record. The Tigers'
top performer lately has been El

vyn Barrable, who has won five
consecutive matches playing most
frequently at No. 3 singles.
Stanford's record has also fallen
off from last year, but the Card
inal's two losses have resulted in
part from injuries and illnesses.
Senior Leigh Anne Eldredge and
sophomore Eleni Rossides have
missed all nine dual matches be
cause of stress fractures, and
junior Kay Tittle came down with
the flu and did not play in the 5-4
loss Wednesday to California.
After the Cal match, Brennan

told his players not to panic. "I
said to the team, 'If we're playing
with a full lineup and we lose to
Cal or Arizona, then we should say
'Wow,' " Brennan said.
As of yesterday, Tittle was still
not 100 percent, and Brennan
listed her as questionable. The
news on Eldredge and Rossides
was more positive, however. Both
have been hitting, and Brennan
said that he is now optimistic that
both will return in April.
The Cardinal has not only been
playing without a full lineup, but,

much to the chagrin of Brennan,
it has also been performing in
front of grandstands that have
been nowhere near full. In fact,
the lack of crowd support for Stan
ford in big matches has been more
disappointing to Brennan than
the two losses.
Wednesday, Cal had more vocal
support at the Stanford Tennis
Stadium than the Cardinal did. "I
think what disappoints me most
is that Cal had more people out
here than we did," Brennan said.
