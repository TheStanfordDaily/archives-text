## 
### ALICIA KENT Staff writer 
Back-to-back home matches are the next
challenge for the Stanford men's volleyball
team as it tries to tame the Loyola-
Marymount Lions tonight at 7:30 and catch
the No. 3 Pepperdine Waves tomorrow at 3
p.m. Both games will take place at Maples
Pavilion.
After losing three straight games to
UCLA. Long Beach State and USC two
weeks ago - dropping Stanford to the No. 7
position in the Western Intercollegiate Vol
leyball Association with a 3-4 record — the
Cardinal needs to win both matches this
weekend. "We have to win. We want to do
well in both matches." said outside hitter
Stephen Blue, who leads the team with 105
kills and 72 digs.
The Cardinal Is placing strong emphasis
on its performance tonight against the

Lions, who are 0-7 in the WIVA. "This is a
really important match for us." Stanford
Coach Fred Sturm said. "Loyola-
Marymount is not a team to be taken
lightly."
Still juggling his starting lineup, Sturm
plans on starting Steve Modory as setter.
"Steve will just have to step in and take con
trol. I think he can do the job," Blue said.
With seniors Blue, Modory and John
McDermott, junior Scott Fortune and fresh
men Dan Hanan and Kent Steffes, Stanford
will try to establish a lineup that will control
the Lions with passing and serving.
However, Stanford knows little about
Loyola-Marymount. "(tonight] will be a bit
different. Loyola-Marymount Is the only
team we haven't seen play," Sturm said.

dominating tonight's match.
"With this lineup we can play spe
cific hitters against specific block
ers." Modory said. "I think it well
make us a lot more versatile this
weekend."
Versatility in serving, blocking
and hitting will be a necessary ele
ment for tomorrow's match.
Ranked No. 2 in the WIVA with a
4-1 conference record, the Waves
are a definite threat to Stanford.
Pepperdine, last year's national
champions, has started another
powerful season with its only loss
coming in four games to UCLA.
The Waves' All-Americas —Matt
Riggs, who leads the WIVA in kills
with a 6.33 kill/attempt ratio, Rob
Scott and Troy Tanner—are three
of the top players in the nation.
However, the Cardinal has

already confronted Pepperdine at
the UCLA/Reebok Collegiate,
where Stanford overcame the
Waves, winning 15-6, 15-6. "(They
were] the two best consecutive
games we've played so far" this
season. Sturm said. "The differ
ence was that we never let up. We
got off to a good start and had a
strong finish."
The Cardinal's victory puts Pep
perdine in a catch-up position.
"We have a revenge factor." Pep
perdine Coach Rod Wilde said.
"We'll have to prove ourselves."
Just as the Cardinal plans to
improve passing, Wilde hopes to
focus on passing and moving the
ball better on the Waves' side of
the net, too. "Stanford was able to
pass much better." Wilde said
about the match against the Card
inal.
Tomorrow's match should be a
very exciting one, according to
both coaches and the Cardinal
players.
