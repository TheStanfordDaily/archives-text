# Men's fencing goes to regional
## 
### CHRIS CRADER Staff writer 
One of the worst things about growing up is
having an older brother or sister who is the high
school academic, athletic and social star. You can
spend your whole life trying to get out of his or her
shadow. The Stanford men's fencing team Is now
in that position.
The Cardinal will be competing in the Western
Regionals this weekend at Fullerton State, trying
to follow up on the performance of the women's
team, which last weekend won the team and indi
vidual titles at its regional.
The men expect to have their hands full. For one
thing, five of their top nine fencers are in their
first year of varsity competition â€” hardly a plus in
a sport in which experience plays a big role.
Another factor is be the tough competition.
Heading the opposition will be Air Force, which
beat the Cardinal 18-9 in January; UC-Santa
Cruz, which has beaten Stanford twice this year,
17-10 and 18-9; and Cal State-Long Beach, con
sidered the favorite. Also competing is Fullerton

State, which Stanford beat 18-9, and UC-San
Diego.
The format will be a team competition, but only
Individuals will qualify for the NCAA champion
ships, which will be held at Notre Dame during
finals week. The region's top four sabre and the
top three foil and epee fencers, based on the entire
season, will be selected.
Stanford's best chance for nationals is probably
senior Larry Murk, who has posted a 43-9 record
on the year in epee. "Murk has the talent to be No.
1 (in the region)," Hurst said.
Other strong contenders for the Cardinal will be
senior Steve Levitan and junior Mike Cramer,
both of whom fence sabre.
"If he gets a few breaks," Levitan could be in the
same position as Murk, Hurst said. "(And) Mike
definitely has the potential to be in the medal
race."
The Cardinal coach is hoping for his seventh
straight top-three finish at regionals, but isn't
making any predictions. "It's going to be a real
horse race," he said.
