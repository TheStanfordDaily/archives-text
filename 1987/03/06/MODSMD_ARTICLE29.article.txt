# Wrestlers head for Pac-10s
## 
### FAITH PERRY Staff writer 
While most students will endure
the pains of Dead Week starting
next Monday, the Cardinal
wrestlers will be getting a head
start. After wrestling a grueling
schedule this Sunday at the
Pacific 10 Championships in Cor
vallis. Ore., a few of the Stanford
team members will probably feel
as though Dead Week was named
in their honor.
Competition for the Cardinal
this weekend will include
wrestlers from Utah State,
Arizona State, Oregon State. Cal
Poly-San Luis Obispo and Fresno
State. Although the tournament is
called the Pac-lOs, It's actually
more of an NCAA qualifying tourn
ament for West Coast schools. In
order to be guaranteed a spot at
NCAAs, a wrestler must place in
the top three of his weight class.

Eight of the fourth-place finishers
will also be chosen to go to the na
tional tournament.
How the Stanford wrestlers will
match up this weekend is
anybody's guess, as the entire
tournament seems to be some
what of a mystery â€” even to the
Cardinal team members. The
wrestlers will not know how they
have been seeded until late
tonight. In addition to the uncer
tainty of the seeding order, Geoff
Baum (142 pounds) explains,
"The conference is new, so we
really don't know how we'll do."
Terry Mclntyre (190 pounds)
also thought it would be difficult
to predict how the Cardinal would
do Sunday. "You never know what
will happen In a big tournament
like this. You just go in and do
your best, and hope that's good
enough," Mclntyre said.
Mclntyre, however, was fairly
optimistic about the team's per
formance at this point in the

season. "Everybody (has) im
proved a lot. Kurt Kassulke and
Scott Wlggen have been great
team leaders, and the freshmen
are looking much better than at
the beginning of the season,"
Mclntyre said. "You can end any
match with a pin, and since every
one on the team is capable of a
pin, everyone has a chance at win
ning," he added.
Mclntyre also commented that
the Cardinal generally does better
in tournaments than in dual
meets."We have a lot of guys (who)
can place and score in a tourna
ment [who] sometimes don't score
in dual meets," Mclntyre said.
Stanford Coach Chris Horpel
said last week that Mclntyre, Ron
Perry (177 pounds), Kurt Kas
sulke (heavyweight), Scott Wiggen
(150 pounds), Steve Yarbrough
(158 pounds) and possibly Eric
Harber (167 pounds) all had a
good shot at qualifying for NCAAs.
