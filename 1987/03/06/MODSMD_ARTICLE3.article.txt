# Elections will be moved again
## 
### RUSSELL KOROBKIN Editorial staff 
The ASSU Senate will hold a special meeting this
afternoon to change the dates of the spring elections
for the second time.
The elections — currently scheduled for April 28-
29, the fifth week of spring quarter — violate the
ASSU Constitution, which specifically requires that
the elections be held during the quarter's second,
third or fourth week.
The senate voted Tuesday to move the election
from April 14-15 to avoid conflicting with Passover,
which begins April 13. The following week was not
considered because of a conflict with Easter, which
falls on April 19 this year.
Senate Chair Jeff Soukup said he was forced by
the constitution to "invalidate" the change in elec
tion dates. Two-thirds of the senate must agree on

new dates today to prevent the election from revert
ing back to April 14-15.
According to Council of Presidents member Carey
White, "everybody neglected to check the detail in the
constitution" when the date change was discussed
by the senate.
White said that when the constitution was written
about 18 years ago. its framers wanted the elections
to be held before the fifth week of the quarter to avoid
conflicting with midterm exams. The result of that
decision is that the ASSU has "little flexibility." he
added.
White said that rescheduling the elections is diffi
cult because the ASSU wants to give candidates who
plan to go home for either of the holidays a chance to
campaign the week before the elections.
Logistical demands, such as sending ballots to s*.u-
dents who are studying overseas,
generally precludes the elections
from taking place before the
Thursday and Friday of the quar
ter's second week (April 9 or 10

this year), White said.
White predicted, however, that
the senate would move the elec
tion to those dates. "Given the in
formation we have now, [April 9-
10) would make sense," he said,
noting that "anything in the third
or fourth week will Inconvenience
people of the Jewish faith or the
Christian faith."

Soukup said the senate "seems
a little divided" between the
choices of the end of the second
week of the quarter and the end of
the fourth week. He said that elec
tions during the end of the fourth
week would cause campaigning to
conflict with Easter, but would
give the candidates more time to
prepare for the campaign.

The new dates will "really
depend on who's there (at the
meeting) to argue for what,"
Soukup said.
Soukup also said the senate will
probably appropriate money to
morrow to publicize the elections.
No other business will be on the
agenda.
