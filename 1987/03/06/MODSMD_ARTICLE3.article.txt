# Elections will be moved again

### RUSSELL KOROBKIN Editorial staff 
The ASSU Senate will hold a special meeting this
afternoon to change the dates of the spring elections
for the second time.
The elections — currently scheduled for April 28-
29, the fifth week of spring quarter — violate the
ASSU Constitution, which specifically requires that
the elections be held during the quarter's second,
third or fourth week.
The senate voted Tuesday to move the election
from April 14-15 to avoid conflicting with Passover,
which begins April 13. The following week was not
considered because of a conflict with Easter, which
falls on April 19 this year.
Senate Chair Jeff Soukup said he was forced by
the constitution to "invalidate" the change in elec
tion dates. Two-thirds of the senate must agree on

new dates today to prevent the election from revert
ing back to April 14-15.
According to Council of Presidents member Carey
White, "everybody neglected to check the detail in the
constitution" when the date change was discussed
by the senate.
White said that when the constitution was written
about 18 years ago. its framers wanted the elections
to be held before the fifth week of the quarter to avoid
conflicting with midterm exams. The result of that
decision is that the ASSU has "little flexibility." he
added.
White said that rescheduling the elections is diffi
cult because the ASSU wants to give candidates who
plan to go home for either of the holidays a chance to
campaign the week before the elections.
