# Men's tennis plays Spartans
## 
### JON WEISMAN Staff writer 
Not often does a men's tennis team find a match
against Stanford a relief. But for San Jose State,
today's 1:30 p.m. match against the Cardinal at
Stanford Tennis Stadium cannot be any worse
than its match last Tuesday.
The 5-4 Spartans, who lost to UC-Santa Bar
bara by a score of 6-3 last Wednesday, also are
coming off a 9-0 loss to UCLA on Tuesday in which
they did not win a set. Today, however, they face a
4-5 Stanford team that has fallen from sixth to a
tie for 20th in the national rankings.
"I think Stanford is obviously a very young
team." SJSU Coach John Hubbell said. "UCLA
isn't much older, but every starter is at least a
sophomore; every starter has at least a year's ex
perience. Stanford is young but that usually
means they will improve a lot."
Stanford continues to play without junior
Patrick McEnroe, who is still ranked 19th among

individuals, despite having played
in only three singles matches in
1987. McEnroe, ranked third in
the pre-season. will remain
sidelined for at least two more
weeks.

"If McEnroe is playing, they're
definitely a whole different level
team." Hubbell said.
Also. Geordle McKee has been
out for two weeks with various in
juries and is doubtful for today's
match.
"We'll have basically the same
lineup we had against Hayward
State (Tuesday)," Stanford Coach
Dick Gould said. "Geordie's doing
a lot better but he's not ready to

play yet."
On the positive side. Jeff
Tarango is 7-1 In dual matches
since moving up to No. 1 singles
in place of McEnroe. The fresh
man from Manhattan Beach is 13-
1 overall in 1987. and is currently
ranked 17th.
Other Stanford players listed in
this weeks rankings include the
doubles teams of Eric Peus and
Jeff Cathrall, who are 27th. and

McEnroe and Scott Moody, who
are 31st. Moody will team with
Mark Jacobson. who has just
recently returned from elbow sur
gery.
Stanford did rout Hayward
State 8-1 Tuesday, and also beat
the Spartans 8-1 at San Jose Feb.
10. with McKee but without
McEnroe. So. SJSU is not looking
at today's match as much of a
respite.
