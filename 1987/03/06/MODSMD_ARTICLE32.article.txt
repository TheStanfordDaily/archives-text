# Men's golf travels to Florida So. tourney

### ROBERT PORTNOY Staff writer 
In golf, playing on your home
course can be a huge advantage.
This weekend, however, the Stan
ford men's golf team may be happy
to leave the Farm. If it sticks
around here, it almost certainly
won't get to play.
Regardless of the rain at home,
the Cardinal sorely needs to fare
well in the Florida Southern/Im
perial Lakes Classic, which gets
under way today in Lakeland, Fla.
The three-day event, hosted by
Florida Southern College, is a
chance for the struggling Stanford
team to gain some confidence it
can carry into its crucial spring
schedule.
Stanford is coming off a tough
tournament in Waikiki. At the
John Burns Invitational, a strong
finishing Cardinal was just able to
tie for 18th. It may not seem like
that was much of an accomplish
ment, but finishing in the top 18
was the first tangible goal Stan
ford has had to shoot for all
season. By tying UC-Santa Bar
bara for 18th, the Cardinal gained

an Invitation to return to Walklkl
next season.
"Playing to get back to the
tournament next year was some
thing to shoot for, and the guys
went out and got It," Stanford
Coach Tim Schaaf said.
Indeed, many encouraging
things can be derived from the
team's final round in Waikiki after
dismal showings in the opening
two rounds. Stanford shot a 294
in what Schaff described as a
"torrential downpour, an absolute
deluge." Stanford fired a 298 and
296 the first two days in much
better weather. The 294 was in
the top eight team scores for the
final day of the tournament.
Just as encouraging was the
play of John Mahon. Mahon
posted a 69 In the second round
and a 71 in the rain to finish the
strongest of any Cardinal.
"There are two things with op
timism: We're becoming quite a
ball-striking team and we're
gradually gaining confidence in
those abilities. We need some
things to give us the feeling that ,
we're competitive," Schaaf said.
A strong showing in Florida may
be just what the doctor ordered.
