# Women swimmers at Cal, then home; hoping to qualify

With a pair of impressive-sounding meets like the
Golden Bear Invitational and Cardinal Invitational
on Its weekend schedule, the Stanford women's
swimming team must be gearing up for some great
competition. Right?
Wrong. Actually, both meets are little more than
glorified time trials designed for individuals still
looking for one more chance at hitting their NCAA
qualifying times.
In fact, the Golden Bear Invitational, which kicks
off at 2 p.m. today at California's Spleker Pool, and
tomorrow's 10:30 a.m. deGuerre Pool Cardinal Invi
tational are so low-key that Stanford Coach George
Haines may miss them due to a recruiting trip.
Apparently, invitations to these "invitationals" are
hard to come by, as Haines said he expects only a few
swimmers from Santa Clara to join the Cal and Stan
ford women.
Neither meet Is likely to feature a full program,
and, according to Haines, "Just those people who
haven't made an event" will swim for Stanford. The
Cardinal has already qualified the maximum of 17
swimmers for the NCAA meet and is simply looking
to bring each swimmer as close as possible to her
personal limit of three Individual events.
Stacy Shupe has already qualified in the 1.650 and
500-yard freestyles and will attempt to add the 200
freestyle cut she missed by less then two-tenths of a

second at last weekend's Pacific 10 Conference meet.
Stanford's Susan Rapp may join Shupe In the race in
order to give her teammate some competition.
Michelle Donahue is also within a half-second of
adding a cut in the 200 individual medley to her 100
and 200 backstroke qualifications.
In addition, Lisa Gillespie and Bethanne Lambert

will be aiming for cuts In the 1,650 freestyle and 100
breaststroke, respectively.
Meanwhile, with its eyes turning toward In
dianapolis, Ind. and the NCAA meet, March 19-21,
the rest of the squad is continuing to taper its train
ing as it works to overcome the spate of illnesses that
afflicted it at the Pac-lOs.

Senior Susan Rapp probably will not see much action this weekend in Stanford's two meets, the Golden
Bear Invitational and the Stanford Invitiational, as the Stanford has already qualified the maximum num
ber of swimmers (17) for the NCAA Championships. Rapp may swim in the 200 freestyle.
