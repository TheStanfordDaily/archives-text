### MARK SMOYER Staff writer 
It will be easy, but it will also be hard.
Tonight, the Stanford men's gymnastics team
travels to San Jose State for a sure win. However,
the No. 14 Cardinal cannot afford to relax.
Regardless of the competition, the team needs to
equal or better its season best in each of its
remaining four meets in order to receive a bid for
the NCAA championships.
Gymnastics teams are ranked according to the
average of their top five team scores. The top 10
teams at season's end will make nationals. While
Stanford's average places the squad at No. 14. its
top score would place the team about fifth in the
nation. Simply maintaining a level close to this
score, however, will not do the trick: As the Card
inal improves, so does the competition.
Stanford's recent improvement, though, has
been more drastic than that of other elite pro
grams. The squad's 277.85 performance last
weekend included season-best individual scores
in five of six events and season-best team scores
in four. All five Cardinal gymnasts who performed
in the all-around competition recorded their per
sonal best for the winter.
Juniors Chuck Gerardo and Mike Matzek
scored 56.6 and 55.65. respectively. Matzek's total
included a miss on the pommel horse, where his
7.3 was 2.35 points worse than his 1987 best.
It will be easy, but it will also be hard.
