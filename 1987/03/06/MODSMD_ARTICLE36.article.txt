## 
### EVAN TUCHINSKY Staff writer 
Although winter is far from
over, Sunday evening will mark
the unofficial opening of Cougar
season on the Farm, as the Stan
ford women's gymnastics team,
coming off a disappointing and
illness-plagued road trip, goes
hunting for a victory against
Washington State in Maples
Pavilion.
Last weekend in Arizona, the
Cardinal fell to Washington and
Arizona, two teams ranked in the
top 10 nationally and in the top
four of the Pacific 10 Conference.
Stanford should feel less pressure
against Washington State, whose
season-high score of 177.50 is al
most five points below Stanford's
181.
"I'm going to look for a good
meet." Stanford Coach Homer
Sardina said. "They're averaging
just under what we're averaging.

Washington State has some good
athletes."
Cathy Bovaird is one of those
athletes. Bovaird leads the
Cougars with an all-around score
of 37.25, a vaulting score of 9.35,
a 9.45 on bars and a 9.55 on
beam. Lisa Hunter, a former Stan
ford recruit, holds the a team
season-high 9.25 on beam.
In the Cardinal corner, the
season standards are held by two
gymnasts, freshman Dina Amo
roso and sophomore Jinny Rhee.
Rhee leads the team on uneven
bars, the squad's most challeng
ing event, with a 9.40 mark.
Amoroso holds the rest, with a
37.15 all-around. 9.45 beam, 9.45
bars and Stanford record 9.65
vault.
With gymnasts of this caliber on
both teams, the meet should be
exciting, according to Sardina. "I
think we'll do really well on bars,"
he said. "We have a little different
lineup on vault and bars.
