### JOHN POLLACK Senior staff writer 
The University budget, the proposed use of
University general funds to meet the Athletic
Department's current deficit and a report on
the Stanford Medical School were among the
topics discussed in the Faculty Senate yester
day.
In other business, acting Provost Robert
Street announced that Carolyn Lougee, dean
of Undergraduate Studies, will step down from
that position at the end of the academic year
(see related article).
Street presented the 1987-88 budget, and it
Included — among other items — salary in
creases for faculty and staff, an increase in fin
ancial aid and more support for library ac
quisitions.
"A record year of fund raising in the last year
has helped us in what could have been a diffi-

The consolidated budget presented by Street
was the culmination of a process that began
last April and involved the president, the
provost, the vice president for business and
finance, deans of various schools and many
others.
Balanced at $847,572,000, the consolidated
budget is the largest budget in Stanford his
tory. When combined with capital expendi
tures and the Stanford University Hospital
budget, the total exceeds $1 billion.
Acting University President James Rosse
discussed the possibility of using University
general funds to help meet the Athletic Depart
ment's current budget deficit.
"What's being contemplated now is the pos
sibility of a flow (to the Department of Ath
letics) on the order of #300,000 — at least for a
year or two," Rosse said.
Rosse compared this proposed outlay to the

*1 million to $3 million general fund alloca
tions currently made by Ivy League schools for
their sports programs. He noted that Stanford
has been fortunate in that its sports programs
have been self-supporting for so long.
In addition to widespread student participa
tion in the University's 29 varsity sports pro
grams, Rossc cited the national success of
several Stanford teams and athletes as justify
ing the outlay.
Also at the meeting, David Korn, dean of the
School of Medicine, presented a report on that
school.
The medical school comprises 22 academic
departments in both basic and clinical
sciences, and has teaching, research and pa
tient care duties, Korn said.
Korn noted that in 1985, the Stanford
School of Medicine ranked first in the nation
in the amount of sponsored re
search expense per faculty mem
ber and in the number of women
and underrepresented minority
students as a percentage of the
total student body. The rankings
were determined by the Associa
tion of American Medical Colleges.
But Korn acknowledged that the
school "has not done as well in
terms of the number of women
and minorities on the faculty.
Women currently make up 11 per
cent of the faculty and minorities
only 7 percent, according to Korn.
While expressing reservations
about the amount of privately
sponsored research conducted at
the school, Korn said the school
has "achieved some outstanding
success" in clinical medicine and
research.
On a related matter, the senate
adopted a resolution Increasing —
from 20 to 25 percent — the
allowed percentage of professors
not on the tenure track on the
School of Medicine's faculty.
