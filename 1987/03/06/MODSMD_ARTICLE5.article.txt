# Two new theme houses chosen
## 
### MARCUS MABRY Senior staff writer 
Lathrop and Hurlburt Houses
will become the American Indian
and the Russian and East
European theme houses,
respectively, beginning in the fall
of 1988, Norm Robinson, associ
ate dean of Student Affairs for
Residential Education announced
yesterday.
A configuration panel in charge
of reviewing theme house
proposals recommended that the
new theme houses be established
in the fall of 1987. Robinson,
however, substituted a proposal
that next year be a "transition
year."
The transition year will preserve
the returning resident priority of
current Lathrop and Hurlburt res
idents, but those students who
draw into the houses for the 1987-
88 academic year will not be able
to retain that priority. During
the transition year, a small "core
group" of students interested in
the themes will live in Lathrop and
Hurlburt and prepare the houses
for their theme programs, Robin
son said.
The panel is composed of fac
ulty, students and staff. Its recom
mendations, along with Robin
son's amendment calling for the
transition year, were approved at

Tuesday's meeting of the Subcom
mittee on Residential Education
and Advising.
The news was not released until
yesterday afternoon, however, in
order to give Residential Educa
tion time to notify the current oc
cupants of the two houses, and
the six groups who submitted
theme house proposals earlier this
quarter, of the final decisions,
Robinson said.
Robinson said there are cur
rently only enough funds in the
existing Res Ed budget to create a
Resident Fellow (RF) apartment
within one of the houses. Neither
Row house currently has an RF.
However, by fall of 1988, both
Hurlburt and Lathrop will be so
equipped.
Both houses were approved as
sites for the new theme programs
because they best fulfill the living
and programming space require
ments of the programs, Robinson
said.
The panel used the criteria set
forth in Res Ed's Guidelines for
the Creation, Organization and
Review of Theme Houses at Stan
ford University in the evaluation
process. These criteria included:
â–¡ A well-defined, strong pro
gram.
