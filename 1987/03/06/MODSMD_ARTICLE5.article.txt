# Two new theme houses chosen

### MARCUS MABRY Senior staff writer 
Lathrop and Hurlburt Houses
will become the American Indian
and the Russian and East
European theme houses,
respectively, beginning in the fall
of 1988, Norm Robinson, associ
ate dean of Student Affairs for
Residential Education announced
yesterday.
A configuration panel in charge
of reviewing theme house
proposals recommended that the
new theme houses be established
in the fall of 1987. Robinson,
however, substituted a proposal
that next year be a "transition
year."
The transition year will preserve
the returning resident priority of
current Lathrop and Hurlburt res
idents, but those students who
draw into the houses for the 1987-
88 academic year will not be able
to retain that priority. During
the transition year, a small "core
group" of students interested in
the themes will live in Lathrop and
Hurlburt and prepare the houses
for their theme programs, Robin
son said.
The panel is composed of fac
ulty, students and staff. Its recom
mendations, along with Robin
son's amendment calling for the
transition year, were approved at

Tuesday's meeting of the Subcom
mittee on Residential Education
and Advising.
The news was not released until
yesterday afternoon, however, in
order to give Residential Educa
tion time to notify the current oc
cupants of the two houses, and
the six groups who submitted
theme house proposals earlier this
quarter, of the final decisions,
Robinson said.
Robinson said there are cur
rently only enough funds in the
existing Res Ed budget to create a
Resident Fellow (RF) apartment
within one of the houses. Neither
Row house currently has an RF.
However, by fall of 1988, both
Hurlburt and Lathrop will be so
equipped.
Both houses were approved as
sites for the new theme programs
because they best fulfill the living
and programming space require
ments of the programs, Robinson
said.
The panel used the criteria set
forth in Res Ed's Guidelines for
the Creation, Organization and
Review of Theme Houses at Stan
ford University in the evaluation
process. These criteria included:
□ A well-defined, strong pro
gram.
□ Demonstrated broad student
Interest.
□ The effect the proposals on
the whole of current residential
programs, and whether the pro
posed program would create
"opportunities unique to the resi
dential setting or just offer things
already offered on campus."
According to the panel's report,
the proposals for the American In
dian and the Russian and East
European theme houses demon
strated "particular programmatic
strength,"
The panel members also lauded
the Russian and East European
house proposal for its high degree
of student and faculty interest, its
unique program and its already
strong foundation as an organiza
tion.
Robinson said the panel recom
mended that "if only one program
can be housed next year, It should
be the Russian and East Eur
opean house."
The panel called the proposed
American Indian house "sig
nificantly different from ther
usual ethnic theme house pro
posal," citing the "small popula
tion" of native Americans at Stan
ford.
The panel recommended that

the proposals for an Ibero-
American and an international
studies theme house not be ap
proved at this time, citing both
proposals' lack of "programmatic
strength." The panel, however,
stated that both might be submit
ted for consideration In the fu
ture.
The panel questioned the effect
that the proposed arts and com
munity service theme houses
could have on the rest of the
campus. Refering to the service
project house, Robinson said
there is a danger of "taking the
pressure off other residences and
other students (to participate in
that area)."
