# Residence evaluation:
## Students happier with dorm life 
### BAIE NETZER Senior staff writer 
In comparison to recent years,
students are more satisfied with
residential education programs in
undergraduate houses, according
to results of a survey released yes
terday.
Over 5,000 students were asked
to fill out residence evaluations
sent to undergraduate residences
in January. Approximately 67 per
cent returned evaluations, and
more students this year rated
their residences # highly for
meeting specific goals of residen
tial education, according to Carol
Muller, project coordinator for
Residential Education.
But according to Muller, the
overwhelming support for res
idences may be partly due to this
year's higher response rate and a
tendency for those most satisfied
to fill out the evaluations.
"It would be nice to say we're
just doing much better," Muller
said. "But I suspect that the
results are partly due to the fact
that we got such a high response
rate."

Approximately 50 percent of
students surveyed last year
returned evaluations.
But while 31 percent of those
polled last year rated their
residences highly for encouraging
"intellectual exchange and discus
sion," that percentage climbed to
42 percent this year.
The percentage of students who
said their residence did "well" at
creating "a supportive and
friendly community" rose five
points this year to 71 percent.
Of the goals considered,
residences received the lowest
ratings in providing opportunities
for students to meet faculty. Only
21 percent said their residence
did "well" at meeting this goal.
Responses to the open-ended
questions on the evaluations were
returned to resident fellows, and
Muller said she intends to release
a summary report of the survey
results in a few weeks. In the sum
mary, Muller will compare results
for different residences and will
also examine patterns in
responses.
