# Panel discusses sanctuary
## 
### JENNIFER SCHMID 
Sanctuary Week continued last
night with a symposium on the
problem of Salvadoran refugees
featuring Rev. John Fife, a leader
of the sanctuary movement.
Six other speakers offered dif
fering views of the sanctuary
movement, a nationwide effort to
provide money and resources to
Central American refugees facing
deportation.
Fife said the United States bears
a large share of the blame for the
atrocities now taking place In El
Salvador because the United
States is aiding a government that
uses torture and violence to main
tain order.
Speaking In Kresge Auditorium.
Fife stated that the American
people "have the responsibility to
save as many lives as possible, un
til such time as our government
returns to obedience to interna
tional law."
Fife said the atrocities com

mitted by the Salvodoran govern
ment are well-documented. They
constitute a "gross violation of
human rights," he added.
According to Fife, the govern
ment In El Salvador uses violence
to keep order. The government
tries first to find organizations
supporting guerrilla movements
and then persecutes those organi
zations, he said. Since peasant
villages have been known to har
bor guerrillas, the Salvadoran
rural population lives in fear of
army attacks, he said.
Fife added that "peasants are
being directly persecuted as a
result of this policy." and thus
should be granted refugee status
in the United States.
"A person should not have to
live In an atmosphere of fear." Fife
said.
Responding to claims that Sal
vadoran peasants are able to find
refuge in "displaced persons"
camps. Fife said such camps are
not safe havens. He said the Amer

ican sanctuary movement at
tempts to harbor peasant refugees
to this country and to provide
them shelter.
Visiting Law Prof. Bill Hing,
moderator of the symposium,
asked Fife if he thought he was
breaking the law by sheltering il
legal aliens.
Fife denied breaking the law. He
defended his actions by arguing
that "whether a refugee is deserv
ing or not of political asylum Is not
the question. The issue is, should
a refugee be sent back to gross
human violations. Every refugee
has the right not to be deported
back to such conditions."
U.S. Attorney Joe Russonlello
said moral Imperatives, while ad
mirable, do not excuse breaking
the law. He said the "sanctuary
movement thinks It knows better
than the legal apparatus."
Russonlello noted that Fife's
presentation, while forceful, was

not convincing enough to change
current U.S. refugee laws.
According to Russonlello, "the
peasants of El Salvador live in a
war zone. They just can't expect to
enjoy the same degree of safety
that we do."

Wolchok said refugees, under'
U.S. law. are persons persecuted
because of race, relegion,
nationality, political opinion or*
social group.

have a hard time getting political*
asylum under such a definition
because the typical refugee is.
