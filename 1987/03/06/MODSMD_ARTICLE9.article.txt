Panel was asked to keep quiet
WASHINGTON — The White House asked the Tower commis
sion not to disclose that President Reagan gave It two conflicting
versions of when he first approved Israel's 1985 shipments of
American arms to Iran, according to Informed sources.
Instead, sources said, White House Counsel Peter Wallison sug
gested to the panel during the final week of Its deliberations that
since Reagan gave two different accounts In his two personal In
terviews with the board. It should report only that the president
could not remember when he had given his approval, sources
said.
Commission members, however, refused to delete details of
Reagan's different stories from their report because they thought
his change of mind between his first and second appearance was
"a clear case of presidential manipulation" by his senior aides, ac
cording to a source familiar with the commission's views, whose
account was confirmed by others.
Commission members believed that at his first appearance
before them on Jan. 26. Reagan embraced the view previously of
fered by former National Security Adviser Robert McFarlane that
the president approved the Israeli shipment in August 1985,
before the first arms were sent to Iran. At the president's second
appearance before the Tower panel on Feb. 11, he embraced the
version previously offered by his then-chief of staff. Donald Regan,
that the president couldn't remember giving advance authoriza
tion, so concluded he must have approved it after the fact.
Israel reacts to Pollard verdict
JERUSALEM — Israelis reacted yesterday with regrets and
recriminations over the Pollard spy affair, which officials
conceded has harmed Israeli-American relations, while two elder
statesmen called for the government to take further steps to
ensure that the embarrassing incident never recurs.
The government Issued no official statement on Wednesday's
sentencing in Washington of Jonathan Jay Pollard and his wife
Anne Henderson-Pollard for spying for Isreal. He received a life
term and she was given two concurrent five-year terms. A number
of politicians said Israel had a moral obligation to seek their early
release because their spying activities were intended to benefit the
state.
Foreign Minister Shimon Peres told reporters, "A man was sen
tenced, not a nation. Even before the trial, Israel saw the whole af
fair as a mistake and I hope it won't happen again."
Peres added, "There is no doubt that this situation has created
a problem in relations between Israel and the United States. It was
not done on purpose and now we have to make every effort to
overcome this. There is no point in throwing oil on the fire."
Reagan optimistic about talks
WASHINGTON — President Reagan yesterday hailed the prog
ress In the intermediate-range arms talks with the Soviet Union
as a "great breakthrough" toward an agreement to eliminate those
missiles from Europe and limit each side to 100 warheads else
where.
Although verification still looms as the major obstacle to suc
cess, Reagan said the administration's policies of "preparedness,
patience and firmness" had produced the change In the Soviet po
sition last weekend that puts an agreement within reach.
"I've never felt more optimistic about the prospects for success
in this area than I do today," he told a meeting of the National
Newspaper Association here. However, he singled out shorter
range missiles and verification as key remaining difficulties.
"We need to agree on equitable constraints on shorter-range INF
(intermediate nuclear force) missiles because the Soviets must
not be able to circumvent an agreement on the longer-range
missiles through a build-up on the short-range ones. And, to be
sure that the Soviets keep their word, we must continue to insist
that all agreements will be effectively verifiable," he said.
Experts react to textbook ban
WASHINGTON — Legal experts across the political spectrum,
using words like "breathtaking," "bizarre," and "far out," yester
day criticized a federal judge's ruling in Alabama banning "secular
humanist" public school textbooks and said they believed the
decision would be overturned.
As school staff began removing the banned books from class
room shelves, attorneys and constitutional scholars said the deci
sion was wrong both In its attempt to define secular humanism as
a religion and in its interpretation of First Amendment
church/state principles.
"The consequences of the Alabama decision are absolutely
breathtaking," said Bruce Fein, a visiting constitutional scholar
at the conservative Heritage Foundation. Fein attacked the notion
that secular humanism is a religion being promoted by public
school textbooks and said that "If one was to accept the notion
that regular public school curriculum teaches religion, one would
have to revamp every public school curriculum in the country."
University of Chicago law professor Philip Kurland called the
ruling "an extraordinary opinion," saying "I don't see where in any
of the precedents of constitutional texts he could find a basis for
his ruling."
In his opinion issued Wednesday, U.S. District Court Judge W.
Brevard Hand prohibited the use of more than 40 social studies,
history and home economics texts in Alabama's public school
classrooms because he said, in promoting secular humanism,
they violated the constitutional prohibition against goverment es
tablishment of a religion.

Inquiry into the circumstances leading to the artist's death. On
Wednesday. New York Hospital disclosed that it had first
suspended and then barred the private-duty nurse who had been
assigned to Warhol.
"The hospital's review of the medical records raised questions
concerning the overall performance of Mr. Warhol's private duty
nurse." said Myrna Manners, one of New York Hospital's public af
fairs officers. "Therefore, on Monday February 23, the hospital in
formed the private-duty nurses registry that pending further
hospital investigation It would not call upon her to care for
patients at the New York Hospital. The hospital has completed its
investigation and It does not intend to have the nurse work at the
hospital again."
Manners declined yesterday to disclose the name of the nurse or
what the hospital's review of its medical records had found.
Peter Slocum, a spokesman for the state health department,
said state investigators had begun to review Warhol's charts and
records and had started to interview physicians and other person
nel at the hospital.
"They don't have a report or full picture yet... or a conclusion."
Slocum said. "We will follow what seem to be some pretty obvious
leads. . . . We will Interview the nurse."

Inquiry into the circumstances leading to the artist's death. On
Wednesday. New York Hospital disclosed that it had first
suspended and then barred the private-duty nurse who had been
assigned to Warhol.
"The hospital's review of the medical records raised questions
concerning the overall performance of Mr. Warhol's private duty
nurse." said Myrna Manners, one of New York Hospital's public af
fairs officers. "Therefore, on Monday February 23, the hospital in
formed the private-duty nurses registry that pending further
hospital investigation It would not call upon her to care for

Panel was asked to keep quiet
WASHINGTON — The White House asked the Tower commis
sion not to disclose that President Reagan gave It two conflicting
versions of when he first approved Israel's 1985 shipments of
American arms to Iran, according to Informed sources.
Instead, sources said, White House Counsel Peter Wallison sug
gested to the panel during the final week of Its deliberations that
since Reagan gave two different accounts In his two personal In
terviews with the board. It should report only that the president
could not remember when he had given his approval, sources
said.
Commission members, however, refused to delete details of
Reagan's different stories from their report because they thought
his change of mind between his first and second appearance was
"a clear case of presidential manipulation" by his senior aides, ac
cording to a source familiar with the commission's views, whose
account was confirmed by others.
Commission members believed that at his first appearance
before them on Jan. 26. Reagan embraced the view previously of
fered by former National Security Adviser Robert McFarlane that
the president approved the Israeli shipment in August 1985,
before the first arms were sent to Iran. At the president's second
appearance before the Tower panel on Feb. 11, he embraced the
version previously offered by his then-chief of staff. Donald Regan,
that the president couldn't remember giving advance authoriza
tion, so concluded he must have approved it after the fact.
Israel reacts to Pollard verdict
JERUSALEM — Israelis reacted yesterday with regrets and
recriminations over the Pollard spy affair, which officials
conceded has harmed Israeli-American relations, while two elder
statesmen called for the government to take further steps to
ensure that the embarrassing incident never recurs.
The government Issued no official statement on Wednesday's
sentencing in Washington of Jonathan Jay Pollard and his wife
Anne Henderson-Pollard for spying for Isreal. He received a life
term and she was given two concurrent five-year terms. A number
of politicians said Israel had a moral obligation to seek their early
release because their spying activities were intended to benefit the
state.
Foreign Minister Shimon Peres told reporters, "A man was sen
tenced, not a nation. Even before the trial, Israel saw the whole af
fair as a mistake and I hope it won't happen again."
Peres added, "There is no doubt that this situation has created
a problem in relations between Israel and the United States. It was
not done on purpose and now we have to make every effort to
overcome this. There is no point in throwing oil on the fire."
Reagan optimistic about talks
WASHINGTON — President Reagan yesterday hailed the prog
ress In the intermediate-range arms talks with the Soviet Union
as a "great breakthrough" toward an agreement to eliminate those
missiles from Europe and limit each side to 100 warheads else
where.
Although verification still looms as the major obstacle to suc
cess, Reagan said the administration's policies of "preparedness,
patience and firmness" had produced the change In the Soviet po
sition last weekend that puts an agreement within reach.
"I've never felt more optimistic about the prospects for success
in this area than I do today," he told a meeting of the National
Newspaper Association here. However, he singled out shorter
range missiles and verification as key remaining difficulties.
"We need to agree on equitable constraints on shorter-range INF
(intermediate nuclear force) missiles because the Soviets must
not be able to circumvent an agreement on the longer-range
missiles through a build-up on the short-range ones. And, to be
sure that the Soviets keep their word, we must continue to insist
that all agreements will be effectively verifiable," he said.
Experts react to textbook ban
WASHINGTON — Legal experts across the political spectrum,
using words like "breathtaking," "bizarre," and "far out," yester
day criticized a federal judge's ruling in Alabama banning "secular
humanist" public school textbooks and said they believed the
decision would be overturned.
As school staff began removing the banned books from class
room shelves, attorneys and constitutional scholars said the deci
sion was wrong both In its attempt to define secular humanism as
a religion and in its interpretation of First Amendment
church/state principles.
"The consequences of the Alabama decision are absolutely
breathtaking," said Bruce Fein, a visiting constitutional scholar
at the conservative Heritage Foundation. Fein attacked the notion
that secular humanism is a religion being promoted by public
school textbooks and said that "If one was to accept the notion
that regular public school curriculum teaches religion, one would
have to revamp every public school curriculum in the country."
University of Chicago law professor Philip Kurland called the
ruling "an extraordinary opinion," saying "I don't see where in any
of the precedents of constitutional texts he could find a basis for
his ruling."
In his opinion issued Wednesday, U.S. District Court Judge W.
Brevard Hand prohibited the use of more than 40 social studies,
history and home economics texts in Alabama's public school
classrooms because he said, in promoting secular humanism,
they violated the constitutional prohibition against goverment es
tablishment of a religion.
