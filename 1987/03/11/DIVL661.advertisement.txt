Mountain Lion Massacre
The Department of Fish & Game is gearing up to allow trophy-hunting of
one of nature's most magnificient creatures, the California Mountain Lion.
The animal's current status is unknown. Mountain lions have been
protected from such perversity in recent years, but in 1985 the Governor
caved in to trophy-hunting interests, vetoing a bill which would have
extended protection for the big cats. Lion predation on livestock is not a
serious problem in this state, and current law is adequate to remedy such
incidents.
Unless the public speaks out against this outrage, mountain lions will be
tracked down by packs of hounds and ignominiously shot out of trees.
Concerned citizeas are urged to contact the Governor, their legislators, and
the Fish and Game Commission NOW, lest the lion go the way of the wolf,
the jaguar and the grizzly bear. Assembly Bill 467, by Tom Bates
(D-Berkeley), would give specially protected status to the lions. Send
letters of support to: Assemblyman Tom Bates, State Capitol, Sacramento,CA
95814.
Two more public hearings are scheduled; the public is urged to attend:
March 6 - Redding (9 a.m., City Council Chambers, 1313 California
Street)
April 10 -Sacramento (9 a.m., Office Building 9, 744 P Street,
Auditorium, Room 102)
If you cannot attend, but would like your views considered, write and/or
call:
Governor George Deukmejian California Fish and Game Commission
State Capitol 1416 9th Street
Sacramento, CA 95814 Sacramento, CA 95814
