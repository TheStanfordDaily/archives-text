country's conscience and have a responsibility to sell

Carter made his remarks to an audience that in

two former Carter administration officials who have
opposed divestment by Stanford.
Christopher, who served as deputy secretary of
state under Carter, negotiated the release of the

adding that after graduation "your freedom dis
