## 
### MORTY POSNER Editorial staff 
Former President Jimmy Carter, speaking last
night in Kresge Auditorium, said universities are the
country's conscience and have a responsibility to sell
the South Africa-related stocks they own.
Carter made his remarks to an audience that in
cluded Board of Trustees President Warren Christo
pher and University President Donald Kennedy —
two former Carter administration officials who have
opposed divestment by Stanford.
Christopher, who served as deputy secretary of
state under Carter, negotiated the release of the
American hostages in Iran. Kennedy served as Food
and Drug Administration commissioner from 1977
to 1979.
Carter prefaced his answer to a question on how
universities should deal with the divestment issue by
saying "mine might be a lonely voice here.
"Universities are the conscience of the nation,"
Carter added.
"I personally favor . . . divestment if the South
African government remains recalcitrant on the
apartheid issue," Carter said.
"I particuarly think that universities have a spe
cific responsibility on this issue," said Carter, who
during an afternoon question-and-answer session
with students said that "universities have a greater
responsibility than do other economic entities."

Speaking on the occasion of his acceptance of the
Jackson H. Ralston prize in international law. Carter
encouraged private citizens, particularly students, to
speak out on policy issues.
"If students or professors or whoever don't like
policy . . , where are the voices, where is the
strength, where is the sacrifice, where is the willing
ness to learn?" Carter asked.
"I don't want to encourage student activism, I have
enough of that in my own family," Carter joked, re
ferring to his daughter Amy's activism at Brown Uni
versity. However, he noted that "our nation's policies
were transformed by students. They changed the
consciousness of a nation.
"There is a phase in life that opens up the opportu
nity for enlightened activism," Carter pointed out,
adding that after graduation "your freedom dis
sipates."
The first question Carter faced at Stanford, asked
during an afternoon press conference, regarded alle
gations by a CIA official that more than half of all ac
tive "findings" — written presidential authorizations
for covert activities — were signed during the Carter
years.
The charges, made by an anonymous CIA source,
were reported yesterday by the Los Angeles Times.
"We had a few, but not many," Carter responded,
saying that except for a few operations in Afghani-

human rights."
stan the remainder "were not init
iated by me."
I<i such cases, Carter said that
he.always had the attorney general
"certify that (the covert opera
tions) were legal and proper" and
he' consulted with other adminis
tration officials and leaders of
Congress.
Speaking about the Reagan ad
ministration and the Iran-contra
crisis at the press conference.
Carter said, "I think President
Reagan is in control when he
wants to be in control.
"President Reagan has a psy
chological motivation not to admit
error. ... We tend to rationalize
things — President Reagan is not
unique in that respect," Carter
said.
Carter emphatically denied that
such an arms-for-hostages deal
could have occurred during his
administration.
"I'm sure It wouldn't have hap
pened during my administration.
That would have been incon
ceivable to me. Nothing of this
magnitude could have gone on
without my knowledge. . . . That
would have been a notable event
in my life.
"I never misled the American

people or the press. I never told a
He." said Carter, who said he
believes a president's duty Is to
"protect the honor. Integrity and
Interests of our country."
"(Reagan) deals In gener
alities. ... I don't know if he will
be any more attentive to his
duties," said Carter, commenting
on how his management style dif
fers from that of Reagan.
Carter said that some issues,
like the negotiation of the Camp
David accords or the Panama
Canal Treaty, were "things that I
felt only I could deal with. . . .
Those things were my responsibil
ity." Those were issues "I tried to
master," Carter said.
Asked how he would deal with
administration officials like Oliver
North and John Poindexter, who
have Invoked their Fifth Amend
ment rights to avoid giving details
of the arms sale. Carter said he
would have called them Into his of
fice and demanded "a full account
ing of this episode."
"In the long run the facts are
going to come out. It would be bet
ter to extract the facts and bring
them out quite early," Carter said.
Carter said he has more faith In
the Reagan administration at
present because the new National
Security Adviser and the nominee
to head the Central Intelligence
Agency were in the Carter admin
istration. He also said that
Howard Baker, the new White
House chief of staff, is a personal
friend.
Asked about the achievements
of the Reagan administration.
Carter observed "so far as I know
he didn't have any international
achievements . . . unless you call
Grenada an achievement, and I

don't believe that."
During his lecture, titled
"Principles of Negotiation." Carter
said he believed it was "a constant
duty" of the United States to act as
both a primary and intermediary
negotiator in the world.
There should be a "constant
presence of eager and intimate in
volvement of the United States."
Carter said.
"Our nation has an obligation
as the greatest nation on earth to
defend human rights . . . and our
silence reverberates around the
world.
