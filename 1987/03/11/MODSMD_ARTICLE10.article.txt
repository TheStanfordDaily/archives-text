# Rooney looks at some tough issues
## 
### MORTY POSNER Editorial staff 
Humorist Andy Rooney said he
Is embarrassed by the fame that
necessitated his speaking engage
ment at Stanford Monday. "I don't
even like to speak," Rooney said.
But the embarrassment wasn't
enough to keep silent his rapid
fire delivery that touched on top
ics ranging from homosexuality to
television news.
Despite Rooney's irreverence, he
took a hard line on homosexuality
and AIDS.
"I'm [as] ambivalent about AIDS
as I am about homosexuality,"
Rooney said. Homosexuals are
"hard to reason with. . . . They
tend to have their own mindset."
Rooney said he felt sorry for
people who were homosexual if
homosexuality Is caused by some
genetic disorder but that "if it is a
matter of preference I am more
unsympathetic to them. I consider
AIDS basically a homosexual
disease."
The constant laughter through
out Rooney's speech subsided
briefly, and Rooney added, "I al
ways get into trouble with an au
dience like this."
Rooney, often parodied as a cur
mudgeonly complainer, said he
believes America is in decline. He
took aim first at the population
explosion that he believes could
mean the "diminution of the
human race."
"At some point we're going to
have to choose who gets sup
ported (by the world)," Rooney
said, lamenting that men and
women graduating from college
have but a few children, those who
don't graduate from college have a
few more and those with no
schooling have "the most children
of all."
"I'm assuming that those of you
who go to college are smarter than
those who don't," Rooney added,
drawing laughter from the audi
ence.
But don't worry, said Rooney,

because scientific discoveries
abound.
"If they can isolate the genes
that make manic depressives,
they'll isolate the genes that make
men look like Robert Redford and
women like Fawn Hall."
Rooney then warned that the
earth's atmosphere is being
ruined. Noting that some spec
ulate that the earth's wastes will
someday all be shot into space, he
said: "We could end up shipping
this whole earth away. We'd be a
big man-made black hole."
Rooney said that what really
gets his goat is the "great prefer
ence Americans have for not
facing the truth.
"I was in a hotel on the 19th
floor — actually the 18th floor;
there was no 13th. Is this a grown
up hotel?" Rooney asked.
To Rooney, America's desire not
to face the truth is why cars can go
120 mph but no state will let you
do it.and why cookbooks and diet

books are simultaneous best sel
lers.
Television news, a subject of
some passion for Rooney, then
came up.
"People don't want to hear it
(the news) even if it's the truth. If
the American people had their
way, Richard Nixon wouldn't have
resigned and Spiro Agnew would
be the president."
Rooney said he didn't think "the
public knows how lucky it is" that
journalistic standards in televi
sion have been so high. "It's in
credible that the networks would
have done this.
"Journalists . . . are the most
honest people In America." This is
so because, Rooney argued, "with
journalists, honesty is a hobby."
The problems of TV news,
Rooney said, are "all in execution,
not in intent."
But "big business" has altered
television forever. Rooney
charges.

"The money changers are in our
temple now. Things will never be
the same again."
Rooney, a best-selling author as
well as a television personality,
was asked about his writing. This
was difficult for Rooney, who con
siders trying to describe the crea
tive process like "analyzing flight
by studying the entrails of a bird. "
Rooney said he didn't feel televi
sion discourages people from
reading because "more books are
being printed than ever before."
Turning to liberalism, Rooney
defined liberals as having been
"exposed to the most ideas in the
world. . . . It's hard to be an ultra
conservative and read."
Asked about who Rooney speaks
of when he hints on "60 Minutes"
that he has only hated one presi
dent, he responded that it was
Richard Nixon. He later added
that "I believe I like Richard Nixon
better than I like professional
wrestling."

journalists, honesty is a hobby."
The problems of TV news,
Rooney said, are "all in execution,
not in intent."
But "big business" has altered
television forever. Rooney
charges.

"The money changers are in our
temple now. Things will never be
the same again."
Rooney, a best-selling author as
well as a television personality,
was asked about his writing. This
was difficult for Rooney, who con
siders trying to describe the crea
tive process like "analyzing flight
by studying the entrails of a bird. "
Rooney said he didn't feel televi
sion discourages people from
reading because "more books are
being printed than ever before."
Turning to liberalism, Rooney
defined liberals as having been
"exposed to the most ideas in the
world. . . . It's hard to be an ultra
conservative and read."
Asked about who Rooney speaks
of when he hints on "60 Minutes"
that he has only hated one presi
dent, he responded that it was
Richard Nixon. He later added
that "I believe I like Richard Nixon
better than I like professional
wrestling."
