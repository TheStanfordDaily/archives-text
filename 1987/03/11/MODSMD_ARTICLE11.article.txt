# Succeeds Cox as Earth Sciences head
## Thompson named dean 
### MARTHA MOODY Staff writer 
George Thompson, Miller Pro
fessor of Geophysics and profes
sor of geology, has been ap
pointed dean of the School of
Earth Sciences, according to an
announcement made yesterday
by acting Vice President and
Provost Robert Street.
Thompson succeeds Dean Al
lan Cox. who died Jan. 27. Cox
had resigned the post of dean at
the beginning of winter quarter
to serve as vice provost and dean
of research and academic sys
tems during University Presi
dent Donald Kennedy's sabbati
cal. Street said.
Thompson, who was chair
man of the geophysics depart
ment from 1967 until 1986, said
he does not want to assume the
position on a permanent basis
because it will take too much
time away from his students
and his research.
Street said the University is
very pleased that Thompson is

willing to serve as dean until a
permanent dean can be hired.
Thompson said the Geophysics
Department is "anxious to get a
search under way." but since a
search committee has not been
formed, he does not expect a re
placement before 1988.
Thompson said the search for a
new dean will have an
"international scope."
His main area of research is
the geophysics of the earth's
crust. He is on the board of
directors of the drilling consor
tium that is overseeing the drill
ing of a 3-mile-deep hole near
the San Andreas fault at Cajun
Pass.
Thompson expects to be busy
during his time as dean. He said
he wants to "forge ahead" in de
veloping a more "experimental
and quantitative" curriculum
and in recruiting new young fac
ulty. Specifically, the depart
ment wants to recruit a profes
sor who specializes in earth
quake seismology and a
hydrogeologist. Thompson said.

"What we're really interested
in," Thompson said, "are basic
scientific problems." He said the
geophysicists at Stanford want
to understand basic forces of na
ture, like climate and sea level,
in a way that mankind can use
in its interaction with the envi
ronment.
