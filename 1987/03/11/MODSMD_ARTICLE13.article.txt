### MARY K. McDEVITT Senior staff writer 
"Children of Poverty." a documentary film writ
ten and produced in part by political science lec
turer Jim Steyer, will air Saturday night on San
Francisco's KGO-TV. channel 7.
Shot In East Palo Alto, Oakland and San Fran
cisco, the documentary links the deprivation ex
perienced by children with how they grow up to
become criminals, according to Steyer.
The show, to be broadcast at 7 p.m.. steps into
the lives of four children. Dominick, "a 9-year-old
with the stature of a 6-year-old," lives out of a
truck with his brother, sister and father In Mar
tinez, Calif., Steyer said. Dominick changes
schools three times a year.
He and the program's three other children tell
what it's like to eat in soup kitchens and to sleep
without beds.
Dominick Is "a cute kid." Steyer said. "He's also
going to end up in crime."
"Poverty Is the root cause of most crime," said
Steyer, an NAACP civil rights lawyer and a former
prosecutor in Oakland.
Steyer became interested in the documentary
last year after seeing a controversial documentary
on poverty, teen pregnancy and race hosted by Bill
Moyers. "Although it was a true story and a
moving documentary," Steyer said, "it played into
a lot of old stereotypes and myths — that poverty
is a black problem and that irresponsible teen

agers are having kids."
"Children of Poverty" argues that poverty is
color blind and not restricted to one race. It also
addresses the issue of the "new poor," the increas
ing number of broken families due to spouse
abuse, families which are homeless and people
who have lost their jobs.
ABC may air the program nationally or synd
icate it to other affiliates if the show, Steyer's first
documentary, captures enough interest. But
Steyer is not worried about its success. It's excit
ing, Steyer said, that commercial, and not just
public, television, is taking the time to look at
poverty issues. "We're trying to get mass viewers
as opposed to PBS (Public Broadcasting Service)
viewers," he said.
Steyer hopes the documentary will inspire Stan
ford students and other Bay Area viewers to ad
dress problems of poverty, problems that can af
fect all of us.
"We as young people will pay the price if we don't
recognize the necessity of acting now in order to
make people of poverty benefits and contributors,
as opposed to burdens, of society.'" he said.
"It's in all of our self-interests. This is not dog
matic. It's cost-benefit analysis." he said.
Steyer teaches Civil Rights and Civil Liberties in
the United States, a political science lecture class
offered spring quarter. Last month, he debated
Asst. Attorney General William Bradford Reynolds
about the Reagan administration's civil rights
policies.
