## 
### DIANE BISGEIER Senior staff writer 
The Public Service Center Friday sent letters to
seniors David Moguel. Lome Needle and Meg Rich
man naming them Stanford's 1987 Gardner Fellows.
Each year three students from Stanford and three
from UC-Berkeley are awarded * 12,000 Gardner Fel
lowships to work with experts in the field of public
service for one year after graduation.
The fellowships are awarded annually to students
who have been actively involved in public service
during their undergraduate years.
"It's going to let me work with someone who is
probably going to be a leader in the field." said
Moguel. a political science major with a concentra
tion in public policy. "Public policy is a lot of govern
ment studies and economic analysts, and studying
political institutions and how they run things. This
is a way to get into the government other than the
law school route," he said.
"It's just a realy great opportunity to go out and try
something in public service," said Needle, who is
majoring In public policy. "It's tough to find a public
service job." said Needle, who explained that public
service organizations rarely recruit on campus and a
long time is usually spent volunteering for them
before a job is offered.
"This is a good chance to make money at the same
time. The Gardners attempt to fix you up with some
one prominent," Needle explained.

"After we get picked is when we start working with
the Public Service Center (PSC) to find a mentor, or
someone we work under," Moguel explained. "The
PSC is probably looking to send us out of state, hope
fully with people pretty high up.
Needle set up and ran a summer school for two
months last summer for East Palo Alto middle school
students. "In the future I'd like to work on something
in public service, dealing with community develop
ment and poverty, two issues that are important,"
said Needle, who also works for the Volunteer Net
work.
Richinan said she hopes to spend her year as a
Gardner fellow "working in some area related to sex
education."
A medical microbiology and economics double
major, Richman has been active in campus sex edu
cation efforts. She has assisted in the preparation of
pamphlets, workshops and advertisments about
sexually transmitted diseases, and was coordinator
of a campus AIDS symposium last spring.
Richman, who is also director of the Speakers
Bureau and a resident assistant in Toyon, said she
hoped "ideally" to work with the surgeon general or a
member of congress on sexual education matters.
Jeannie Halleck, director of the program, said that
an alternate was also named and would accept the
award if one of the three named recipients chose not
to accept the fellowship within two weeks. Moguel,
Needle and Richman, however, said that they
definitely plan to accept their Gardner offers.
