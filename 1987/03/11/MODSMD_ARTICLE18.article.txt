## THE
						STANFORD DAILY An Independent Newspaper Report is rhetoric 
### 
A Board of Trustees' task force has con
cluded that educational initiatives against
South African apartheid offer greater prom
ise than disinvestment. The highly
publicized report by the task force is long on
lofty rhetoric and short on concrete in
itiatives. The University seems to think it
can teach one way but invest another.
It appears the hope is to create a smoke
screen to divert attention from the divest
ment issue by refocusing discussion on edu
cational programs. It's easy to overlook
Hewlett-Packard's poor record in South
Africa when you have a noble education
policy to hide behind. There is no reason why
educational policies must exclude or over
shadow selective divestment efforts.
Since last quarter, when University Presi
dent Donald Kennedy announced Stanford's
new emphasis on an educational role in
South Africa, trustees and administrators
have been pushing and praising this notion
as Stanford's more effective route. Their
reasoning is specious. They ignore the role
Stanford plays as a presitigious institution,
as a leader of public policy and values. Stan
ford's actions as an investor cannot be so far
removed from its educational goals. When

Stanford acts, people listen.
Though undertaking educational efforts
involving South Africa is both laudable and
long overdue, the proponents of this policy
have exaggerated its potential impact on con
ditions in South Africa. The criticisms Ken
nedy and the trustees had for divestment,
never truly applicable in that case, are more
valid with respect to this educational policy:
that the value is purely symbolic and has no
effect on the Pretoria government.
Amid all the talk, where are the specific
programs and how will they be imple
mented? Ambitious vocabulary and good ap
pearances are not enough. Bringing three
mid-career South African blacks to Stanford,
which acting President James Rosse an
nounced last month, cannot serve as suffici
ent evidence that the University is commit
ting serious resources.
If the University acts on educational in
itiatives with vigor, it must pursue its
selective divestment policy with equal vigor.
Otherwise, the University will find itself in a
hypocritical position: It will support an edu
cational program for appearances while con
tinuing to profit from companies that are
supporting the system of apartheid.
