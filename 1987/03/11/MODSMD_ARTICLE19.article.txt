# ASSU incompetent

Every ASSU election brings criticisms of
the student senate: It is an inefficient bu
reaucracy, it performs few truly useful stu
dent functions and it gets little accom
plished. This year, reaching new, towering
heights of absurdity, the ASSU cannot even
decide when to hold its spring elections.
A simple chronology of the difficulty in set
ting the election dates reveals the astound
ing ability of the senate to go round and
round in circles, expending much time and
effort, but leaving things exactly as they were
found.
□ At its final meeting of this quarter, last
Wednesday, the ASSU voted to move the elec
tions from the scheduled dates of April 14-15
to April 28-29 in order to avoid conflicts with
Passover and Easter. Steve Baer, a COP can
didate, asked the ASSU to move the election
dates because they conflicted with the
Jewish holiday of Passover, which begins
April 13.
□ Unknown to the senators, however, the
new election dates were in direct violation of
the organization's very own constitution.
The ASSU Constitution mandates that the
elections take place during the second, third
or fourth week of spring quarter. Unfortun
ately, no one at the senate meeting had a
calandar or a constitution. April 28-29 falls

in the fifth week of the quarter. Therefore, a
special ASSU meeting was held Friday to cor
rect the initial snafu. The assembled
senators voted to move the election dates to
April 23-24 — the Thursday and Friday fol
lowing Easter.
□ Again, a mild uproar ensued. In addition
to conflicting with the Christian holiday, it
seems these dates were also unacceptable be
cause any runoff election would have to take
place in the dreaded fifth week. Members of
the ASSU, therefore, had to meet again on
Monday to resolve the issue. The senators
then decided to move the election to, of all
dates, April 14-15 — right where they
started.
In one week the senate managed to meet
three times, moving the voting dates at each
meeting before finally deciding to hold the
elections on the originally scheduled days.
While it is a good idea not to have the elec
tions interfere with religious holidays,
having to move the elections three times is
high folly. The ASSU's lack of foresight on
the voting dates is ridiculous. The Jewish
and Christian holidays were set long before
the ASSU schedulers sat down to deliberate.
Perhaps the senators should invest in
some additional copies of 1987 calendars,
not to mention ASSU Constitutions.
