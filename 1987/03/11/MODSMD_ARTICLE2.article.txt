# Trustees OK new parking
## 
### CLINT HIGHFILL Senior staff writer 
Construction will begin this
summer on a 750-car, five
story parking structure that
was approved yesterday by the
University Board of Trustees.
The structure will be located
across from the Roble tennis
courts, behind Forsythe Hall.
The eight Roble tennis
courts, to be used for parking
during construction, will be
replaced by eight new courts
being built across from Gover
nor's Corner on Campus Drive.
The new courts should be
open for play by mid-July, ac
cording to Michael McKnight,
manager of General Plant Im
provements.
Construction on the parking
structure, the University's
second, will begin in June or
July, with completion expected
in 12-15 months. When

finished, the structure will
have timed parking as well as
spaces for cars with 'A' and C'
parking permits.
The University now has
about 9,500 spaces for such
parking, according to Dennis
Perkinson, associate director of
Transportation Programs.
Parking Structure I, now under
construction Just east of the
Stanford Medical Center, and
the second structure will add
1,450 spaces, Perkinson said.
Perkinson said his office
projects a need for 2,500 more
parking spaces by the year
2000, and that more parking
structures may be built to meet
that need.
But before planning for the
next major increment of
parking, Perkinson's office is
evaluating the functionality,
aesthetics and costs of possible
solutions.
The trustees will consider a
long-range parking plan at either
their May or June meeting,
Perklnson said.
"Structures are expensive, but
they save land." Perklnson said.
"Our land is valuable."
"It's really a matter of developing
some mechanism to pay for it
(more structures)," he said.
The trustees also approved a
1987-88 operating budget that
was first unveiled at last week's
Faculty Senate meeting.
Among the budget increases in
undergraduate studies are:
□ In the School of Engineering, a

•242,000 increase to help fund
the new computer science major.
□ Allocations totaling *372,000
to the School of Humanities and
Sciences, including •150.000 for
Interdisciplinary Programs in the
School of Humanities and
Sciences and *222,000 to fund a
number of improvements in un
dergraduate education and to en
hance enhance academic advis
ing.
□ A *70,000 increase to support
the Public Service Center.
For graduate studies, the 1987-
88 operating budget contains an
increase of *530,000 to bring fel
lowships and stipends to the level
of those at competing institutions
and to counter the effects of the
new tax laws.
