# Trustees OK new parking
## 
### CLINT HIGHFILL Senior staff writer 
Construction will begin this
summer on a 750-car, five
story parking structure that
was approved yesterday by the
University Board of Trustees.
The structure will be located
across from the Roble tennis
courts, behind Forsythe Hall.
The eight Roble tennis
courts, to be used for parking
during construction, will be
replaced by eight new courts
being built across from Gover
nor's Corner on Campus Drive.
The new courts should be
open for play by mid-July, ac
cording to Michael McKnight,
manager of General Plant Im
provements.
Construction on the parking
structure, the University's
second, will begin in June or
July, with completion expected
in 12-15 months. When

finished, the structure will
have timed parking as well as
spaces for cars with 'A' and C'
parking permits.
The University now has
about 9,500 spaces for such
parking, according to Dennis
Perkinson, associate director of
Transportation Programs.
Parking Structure I, now under
construction Just east of the
Stanford Medical Center, and
the second structure will add
1,450 spaces, Perkinson said.
Perkinson said his office
projects a need for 2,500 more
parking spaces by the year
2000, and that more parking
structures may be built to meet
that need.
But before planning for the
next major increment of
parking, Perkinson's office is
evaluating the functionality,
aesthetics and costs of possible
solutions.
