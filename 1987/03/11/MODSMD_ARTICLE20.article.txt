Waste of time
I am writing to the Bicycle
Safety Committee regarding the
proposed traffic circle at Engi
neering Corner. I would like to
thank committee members for
their hard work and effort in this
endeavor. You came, you tested
and you now realize that redirect
ing Stanford students is a great
waste of time. Please don't build
anything and leave Engineering
Corner alone.

I was one of those people who
ignored the signs and hoses last
week and I honestly felt all warm
inside cruising through the ugli
ness on my way to class. I am also
one of thousands that ignore
those traffic lines in White Plaza
every day.
Biking includes a certain
degree of risk. Those who can't
handle Engineering Corner at
noon (and I haven't met them yet)
should try the 637 other ways to
get across campus.
The designed, unbroken space

stretching from History Corner to
the Claw also genuinely adds life
to this University. Your traffic
circle — which is intended for two
percent of all minutes in a day —
would ruin that. The thinking
that brought Highway 101 to
White Plaza is the same thinking
that would bring a wart to a cor
ner of the Quad.
Your intentions are good but
some things can just be dealt
with.
