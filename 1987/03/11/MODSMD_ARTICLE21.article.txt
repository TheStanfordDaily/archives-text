# ASSU killing Concert Network
## 
### 
Resume packers plumb new depths! This
could just as well have been the title of the arti
cle concerning the so-called shake-up at the
Concert Network (Daily. March 4). With in
furiating and almost comical bad taste, ASSU
Senators Jeff Sloan and Galia Tylman are evi
dently following Washington vogue by bringing
political conspiracy and scapegoating to Stan
ford.

Folks, this is one Daily scoop that is
definitely worth another look. You don't even
have to read between the lines. It's a drama
complete with nameless shadow figures who
"pressure certain members of this year's staff
to resign"; tall tales (otherwise known as lies):
"We've been paying huge amounts of money for
no concertsand cynical admissions: "The
original thought was "Let's cripple the Concert
Network.' "
It is hard to know where to begin in setting
straight so many errors of commission and
omission, but let's begin with the shadow fig
ures. Who are they? The Concert Network Ad
visory Board. What do they do? Hire the Con
cert Network's director, business manager and
faculty adviser, fire (or force to resign) the
same people, pander to the ASSU and slander
their present and former employees. They are
currently seeking students to fill the positions
of those they have alienated. Not surprisingly. I
don't recommend taking them up on the offer.
What they did to others they could do to you.
Next, sit back and listen to the ease with
which irresponsible lies, exaggerations and

just plain ignorance flow from the mouths of
those ASSU lackeys. Senators Jeff Sloan and
Galla Tylman. (Perhaps they are disciples of
Laßouche. After all. politics does make for
strange bedfellows). "The staff is basically in
ept," says Sloan. "We've been paying huge
amounts of money for no concerts." The Con
cert Network reserves have "been going down,
down, down." Tylman chimes in.
I beg to differ. As Linda Christie pointed out
in her recent letter (Daily. March 4). the truth
is that students in 1984 paid a net fee assess
ment of *36,750 and have not contributed
money since then except through ticket sales.
Currently. Concert Network reserves amount
to roughly *30,000. These are anything but
"huge" losses for a three-year period — espe
cially in comparison to the *25.000 annual
losses that Sloan. Tylman and the Concert Net
work Advisory Board find acceptable for the
Concert Network of the future.

In addition, there is this strange claim that
the Concert Network has given us "no con
certs." Must they be reminded that we had four
Grateful Dead shows and two Windham Hill
shows in the past two years, three comedy
shows this year and other shows as well?
Keeping these statements in mind, who ap

pears to be "inept"? Is it those who are being
forced to resign or those who are forcing their
resignations? Furthermore, who has the com
munity's interests at heart? On one side we
have people who have worked hard and against
significant odds to bring music and comedy to
Stanford. On the other side we have those who
brazenly admit that their "original thought"
(quite original. I admit) was "Let's cripple the
network."
Tim Self, the Concert Network business
manager, has already submitted his resigna
tion and others will surely follow. But the rest
of us must not be resigned to the future that
the Concert Network Advisory Board and their
ASSU lackeys have in mind for us. They will
undoubtedly attempt to use the same strong
arm tactics with concert promoter Bill Graham
and University officials here at Stanford — two
powers that the current staff has recognized
must be our allies and not our adversaries.

This approach will only make matters worse by
destroying the gains made through an ap
proach characterized by financial responsibil
ity and the development of trust between the
University, the Concert Network and Bill
Graham.
