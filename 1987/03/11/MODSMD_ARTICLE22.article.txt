# Donate safe blood

### 
In recent letter (Daily, Feb. 25). Lyn Bowman sug
gested that each reader "be a regular blood donor, re
quest AIDS test results and insist that prospective
and regular sexual partners do the same." Bowman
indicated that the Stanford Blood Center had
"recently adopted a confidential procedure for releas
ing AIDS test results to its blood donors," and he was
"the first person to obtain AIDS test results by this
new procedure."

SVOBODA & ENGELMAN

Although the blood center will provide test results
to its donors, there is a better alternative for secur
ing such information. Blood centers are not a con
venient resource for determining or demonstrating
proof of AIDS antibody status.
In early 1985, the State of California became the
first state to mandate HTLV-111 antibody screening of
all blood donors. Recognizing that persons at high
risk for being infected or infectious might choose to
donate for the purpose of discovering their antibody
status, legislation also:
□ prohibited blood centers from notifying donors of
their antibody status for at least 60 days and
□ provided alternative test sites where free,
anonymous and more timely tests results could be
obtained.
Other states now require similar testing. However,
some have not required delays in reporting test
results and/or alternate free test sites. They are now
attempting to remedy their errors in an effort to
assure a safer blood supply.
A number of facts should also discourage donors
from using the blood center as a source of obtaining

a meaningful AIDS antibody test result.
□ Since the reporting of test results is delayed at
least 60 days, one cannot "guarantee" his or her test
status is the same as it was at the time of donation.
□ If the antibody test is positive, blood centers are re
quired by law to place the name of the donor on a
confidential Deferred Donor Register, which is circ
ulated to all blood-drawing institutions in the state.
□ The test is not perfect. The test utilized by blood
centers detects the presence of antibody produced in
response to the AIDS virus. There is an important lag
period between infection with the virus and antibody
production. Therefore, some individuals infected
with the virus may not be detected by this test.
□ If potentially high-risk individuals use blood
centers to discover their antibody status, there is the
slight possibility that screening may not detect i
potentially infectious blood. This is the primary rea* -
son we utilize additional precautions.
We urge people to donate blood because there is aK
ways someone who needs It, whether it be a loved onfe
or total stranger. The motive for donating blood
should continue to be an altruistic, patient-oriented
motive.
Frankly, if an individual feels she/he has had even
a slight chance of being exposed to infection, and is
curious about their antibody status, we don't want
her/him as a blood donor. Our primary responsibly
ity is to assure a safe blood supply.
If individuals want to provide assurance of their
health status, there are alternative testing sites
where free, confidential and more timely results can
be obtained.
