# Stanford should obey the law
## 
### 
Is Stanford University above the law? Should
this elite institution respect the decisions of
the federal courts? Should a university receiv
ing a large portion of federal money have the
right to ban certain branches of the federal
government from the campus? Some groups
on this campus answer yes to all of the above
questions.
Last week, many gay organizations on
campus (more than I knew existed) combined
forces to submit a letter to The Daily citing the
injustice and prejudice that accompanies their
sexual orientation. They objected to being left
out of Jesse Jackson's speech at Stanford and
ignored at the Public Service Center's
"Families in Transition" Conference. They
were slighted by the Administration's refusal
to bar the military, CIA and FBI from campus
because these federal agencies refuse to hire
homosexuals. Admittedly, gays have yet to
receive the protection under the law afforded
all other minorities in this country. There are

no gay hiring quotas, no gay scholarships and
no Gay History Weeks. Unfortunately the
struggle for equality will be protracted and ar
duous. Gays must realize that the majority of
the country outside several urban areas does
not approve of their lifestyle, and that national
attitudes will take a long time to change. As
such, their expectations for immediate prog
ress should be realistic. Perhaps, Jesse and
the Public Service Center should have included
gays in their presentations but to rationally ex
pect Stanford University to ban the military,
the CIA and the FBI from campus is prepos
terous.
The federal courts have ruled that the mili
tary, CIA and the FBI can legally exclude
homosexuals. Whether the University per
sonally supports the contention that gays
might pose a security risk, that these organi

zations have special missions involving public
trust or that the close living conditions of
group members makes homosexuality prejudi
cial to good order and discipline is irrelevant.
The University should and does respect the
law. The University has a stated policy that dis
approves of discriminatory hiring based on
sexual preference. The Career Planning and
Placement Center (CPPC) will deny its facilities
to those who unlawfully discriminate on the
basis of sexual preference. The University also
realizes that it does not have the right to pick
and choose which court decisions it wishes to
accept.
A more practical concern is the possible loss
of federal funding. Daniel Bao, a GLAS spokes
man, stated the Pentagon would not cut off
Stanford research funds because of the impor
tance of Stanford research. The Gay and Les
bian Alliance letter to The Daily called the
withdrawal of funds "far-fetched in the ex
treme." These assumptions are parochial and
naive. The federal government would be totally
justified in withdrawing support if certain
federal agencies were banned from campus.
Fortunately, nobody paid much attention
when the law school and the business school
barred government employers who dis
criminate against gays. The result might be
different if the entire University adopted this
policy.
Imagine the following scenario. Stanford an
nounces that any federal organization that dis
criminates against homosexuals will be barred
from recruiting on campus. The military,
which by the end of the decade will have to
recruit about one-third of all eligible 18-year
old males to maintain its current strength
level, is outraged. It withdraws all federal
funds and disenrolls all military officers cur
rently studying at Stanford. The military looks
to Congress for support. Congress, which is
currently debating whether a year of national
service or reinstatement of the draft is the bet
ter post baby-boom alternative, sides with the
military. Articles appear in Time and
Newsweek. Conservative senators wearing red
neckties and looking to capitalize on an issue
that will be popular with the folks back home
argue on cable television that Stanford should
be sanctioned. Congress overwhelmingly

agrees that banning one part of the federal gov
ernment is equivalent to banning all parts of
the federal government. They vote to withdraw
all federal support to Stanford pending a
ehange in policy. Generous alumni who have a
higher regard for the military and the legal sys
tem than for the practice of homosexuality also
stop sending money. Stanford is embarrassed,
retracts the policy, and fires those who
originally suggested it. This picture is cer
tainly no less far-fetched than suggesting a
government would trade arms with terrorists
and use the profits to help overthrow a Central
American government.
The military, CIA and FBI are all respected
service organizations that offer stable,
honorable career options for the majority of
Stanford students. It would be unfair to deny
students the opportunity to conveniently in
terview for these positions. A university should
be a forum for open debate and academic
freedom. By barring government organiza
tions, the University would be making a value
judgment for the entire student body. It would
be a form of censorship. Stanford students are
hopefully smart enough to decide for them
selves what is right.
A boycott or ban is not an effective way of
ending discrimination. The agencies in ques
tion will not change their policies without a
court order or government directive. Those
who wish to change the policy should work
through the courts or the legislature where
change is possible. Finally, I question how
many of the gays and lesbians who co-signed
the letter to The Daily would seek employment
with the military, FBI or CIA if given the oppor
tunity.
The University and the CPPC have reached a
wise and delicate compromise between maxi
mizing student opportunity for employment
and not permitting unlawful discrimination.
The University is discouraging discrimination
of any form but is still respecting the legal sys
tem. Most importantly, it is leaving the choice
of employment with the student, where it
rightfully and properly belongs.

Is Stanford University above the law? Should
this elite institution respect the decisions of
the federal courts? Should a university receiv
ing a large portion of federal money have the
right to ban certain branches of the federal
government from the campus? Some groups
on this campus answer yes to all of the above
questions.
Last week, many gay organizations on
campus (more than I knew existed) combined
forces to submit a letter to The Daily citing the
injustice and prejudice that accompanies their
sexual orientation. They objected to being left
out of Jesse Jackson's speech at Stanford and
ignored at the Public Service Center's
"Families in Transition" Conference. They
were slighted by the Administration's refusal
to bar the military, CIA and FBI from campus
because these federal agencies refuse to hire
homosexuals. Admittedly, gays have yet to
receive the protection under the law afforded
all other minorities in this country. There are

no gay hiring quotas, no gay scholarships and
no Gay History Weeks. Unfortunately the
struggle for equality will be protracted and ar
duous. Gays must realize that the majority of
the country outside several urban areas does
not approve of their lifestyle, and that national
attitudes will take a long time to change. As
such, their expectations for immediate prog
ress should be realistic. Perhaps, Jesse and
the Public Service Center should have included
gays in their presentations but to rationally ex
pect Stanford University to ban the military,
the CIA and the FBI from campus is prepos
terous.
The federal courts have ruled that the mili
tary, CIA and the FBI can legally exclude
homosexuals. Whether the University per
sonally supports the contention that gays
might pose a security risk, that these organi

zations have special missions involving public
trust or that the close living conditions of
group members makes homosexuality prejudi
cial to good order and discipline is irrelevant.
The University should and does respect the
law. The University has a stated policy that dis
approves of discriminatory hiring based on
sexual preference. The Career Planning and
Placement Center (CPPC) will deny its facilities
to those who unlawfully discriminate on the
basis of sexual preference. The University also
realizes that it does not have the right to pick
and choose which court decisions it wishes to
accept.
A more practical concern is the possible loss
of federal funding. Daniel Bao, a GLAS spokes
man, stated the Pentagon would not cut off
Stanford research funds because of the impor
tance of Stanford research. The Gay and Les
bian Alliance letter to The Daily called the
withdrawal of funds "far-fetched in the ex
treme." These assumptions are parochial and
naive. The federal government would be totally
justified in withdrawing support if certain
federal agencies were banned from campus.
Fortunately, nobody paid much attention
when the law school and the business school
barred government employers who dis
criminate against gays. The result might be
different if the entire University adopted this
policy.
Imagine the following scenario. Stanford an
nounces that any federal organization that dis
criminates against homosexuals will be barred
from recruiting on campus. The military,
which by the end of the decade will have to
recruit about one-third of all eligible 18-year
old males to maintain its current strength
level, is outraged. It withdraws all federal
funds and disenrolls all military officers cur
rently studying at Stanford. The military looks
to Congress for support. Congress, which is
currently debating whether a year of national
service or reinstatement of the draft is the bet
ter post baby-boom alternative, sides with the
military. Articles appear in Time and
Newsweek. Conservative senators wearing red
neckties and looking to capitalize on an issue
that will be popular with the folks back home
argue on cable television that Stanford should
be sanctioned. Congress overwhelmingly

agrees that banning one part of the federal gov
ernment is equivalent to banning all parts of
the federal government. They vote to withdraw
all federal support to Stanford pending a
ehange in policy. Generous alumni who have a
higher regard for the military and the legal sys
tem than for the practice of homosexuality also
stop sending money. Stanford is embarrassed,
retracts the policy, and fires those who
originally suggested it. This picture is cer
tainly no less far-fetched than suggesting a
government would trade arms with terrorists
and use the profits to help overthrow a Central
American government.
The military, CIA and FBI are all respected
service organizations that offer stable,
honorable career options for the majority of
Stanford students. It would be unfair to deny
students the opportunity to conveniently in
terview for these positions. A university should
be a forum for open debate and academic
freedom. By barring government organiza
tions, the University would be making a value
judgment for the entire student body. It would
be a form of censorship. Stanford students are
hopefully smart enough to decide for them
selves what is right.
