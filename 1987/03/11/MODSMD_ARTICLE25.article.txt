Not a rip-off
This is submitted in response
to two recent columns written by
Jim Durkin on University Food
Service and Sterling Quad pricing
(Daily. Feb. 3 and March 3). While
they sparked a good deal of stu
dent interest, they did so with a
significant amount of misin
formation.
In Durkin's first column, the
meal he described as purchasing
on his meal card (which he really
does not have) totals, at current
prices, to *5.70 — not >7.05.
Next, a can of soda costs a meal
card holder 35 cents. A "cash"
customer would pay 60 cents —
not * 1.05 — and a case would
total $14 (just like the real world)
and not *24.
The prices quoted for breakfast,
lunch and dinner were nearly
accurate. Actually, we charge
more for lunch: *5.30, not *4.30.
These happen to be the guest
meal rates — not student board
plan rates. To factor in the cost of
"missed meals" simply does not
apply in this case.
Comparing board plan prices
between institutions like Stan
ford and Harvard is like compar
ing the proverbial apples and
oranges. There are many ways of
dissecting the price of a board
plan. Every university places
different expectations for the food
service contribution to the uni
versity overhead expenses. The
service levels vary from place to
place along with demands of
students.
When you factor in the cost of
the meals you miss the cost does
go up. That is true of every college

food service operation that offers
a prepaid board plan. Only when
you pay cash for every item you
buy will the "missed meal" factor
disappear. With that kind of ar
rangement. the customer pays
extra for any seconds.
Other errors that appeared in
Durkin's first column referred to
the wages of employees. Those
inaccuracies were corrected in a
rebuttal by Stacey Leyton. Bill
Minyard and John Inda (Daily.
Feb. 12). We appreciate their
support. Stanford, to,its credit,
pays its employees well. Our
employees are no exception and
there will be no apologies. They
work hard to provide the best
quality and service possible.
Insuring that good-quality food
is served is a responsibility that
management, full-time employees
and hashers share. Durkin was a
hasher and should remember the
guiding policy: "If the quality of
an item being served is in ques
tion. don't serve it."
One final comment is directed
to Durkin: As one of our former
University Food Service
employees, we would have appre
ciated the courtesy of your asking
us and getting correct informa
tion. You made the point that
students have to make their
opinions known to food service
managers. We appreciate that,
and wish that you had taken the
time to do the same. The
manager made several calls to set
up a meeting with you. As a re
sponsible journalist, it would
seem that this would have been a
terrific opportunity for you to get
all the facts and answers to your
many questions.
