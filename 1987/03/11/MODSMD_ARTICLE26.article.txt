You know who Mother Theresa is, don't you? That's right,
she's that nice old lady who helps others who can't help them
selves. And did you know that Mother Theresa won a Noble
Peace Prize? You betcha. If you would like to be the Mother
Theresa of Stanford, then vote for the Community Service
General Fee in the Spring election. What is it? Let me tell you,
oh, curious one.
Your positive vote on the Community Service General Fee
will establish a fund for the community service programs
developed by voluntary student organizaitions of Stanford.
$80,00 gross dollars — money that has been left outside far too
long — will go to community service. That's for stuff like the
Charity Carnival for the kids of East Palo Alto, tutoring programs,
educational conferences, and many other things. Right now,
these sorts of activities get relatively nothing from ASSU (even
Mother Theresa gets something).
But if at least 2/3 of the people voting decide to vote YES on the
Community Service General Fee, then there will be serious
manna for these groups. And who knows, the Noble Prize Selec
tion Committee may be watching you on election day. Probably
not, but what the hell.


Senator "stepping out" to meet constituents.
