# A 						Request from The ASSU Sunday Flicks:
## 
### 
The level of paper and, more importantly, alcohol, at
certain Flicks this quarter has been too high. Paper creates
a fire hazzard, and alcohol is illegal, leazds to damage of
Memorial Auditorium, and encourages too much
rowdiness.
The Flicks asks you to refrain from brings so much paper
into Mem Aud; paper airplanes are one thing, but
backpacks full of shredded computer paper is another.
We also urge you to stop bringing alcohol into the
Auditorium. Previously, our policy has been to confiscate
drinks. Henceforth, the University has told us to evict
anybody caught drinking.
The Flicks Management appreciates your cooperation.
Sincerely,
Stephen Sinclair
ASSU Flicks Manager
