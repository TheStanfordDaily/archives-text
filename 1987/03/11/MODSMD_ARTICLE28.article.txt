Yes, we will PAY YOU MONEY for these jobs. We're talking
funds. We're talking cut you a check right now, by God. You
know you're mercenary, we know you're mercenary. Let's talk
deal.
MANIPULATIVE CLERK OF THE SENATE
Whoever puts together the Senate legislation, knows all the
Senators, and writes the agenda runs the senate, right? And
that's the Senate Chair, right? Not if you get this job. The Clerk
of the Senate is paid big money to learn how the organization
runs and then handle the details the Senate Chair isn't smooth
enough to deal with. Contact Jeff Soukup, 328-4808.
AMUSING ASSISTANT ADMIN STRATI VE
MANAGER
This is a tough, but well-paid, job unless you keep your sense of
humor. You have to watch over and help out many or all of the
ASSU's eight (nine? ten? they keep coming) service projects,
many of whom are (hopefully) run by skilled people who know
more than you do (but not for long!) Learn from them and
learn to manage them. Contact jack Ottoway, 329-1809.
KIND AND SINCERE PROGRAM BOARD
BUDGET COUNSELOR
The Program Board's job is to give people shit (we don't pay
them to do it because giving shit is fun). Someone has to be nice
to groups to keep the suicide rate down. The Budget Counselor
advises groups on how to get money from the ASSU, which
he/she knows becuase he/she work here and gets paid to know.
Meet a million groups and help them out! Contact Robin Miller,
328-3512.
POWER-HUNGRY NOMINATIONS
COMMISSION MEMBERS
Deep donw inside, you want control over other people's
destinies. This is it right here. Nominations Commission
members select other students to sit on decision-making
Univerisity committees that rule your life. Learn how to
interview; learn how the University really works; meet scores of
the most aggressive studetns on campuse and earn favors from
them. Contact Christina Felton, 329-8935.
HOMELESS BOATHOUSE FACILITES
MANAGER
We give free housing to people who work at the Boathouse
(guess where! Hint: it's near a lot of water). We need someone
who likes to build things with tools and repair things to keep
them standing. In return, you save real big money on housing
for a whole year, get a great place to live, and have a big bay
window to make out in front of. Contact Lori Albert, 325-0724.

We put a new Special Fee for the Concert Network on the ballot
last Tuesday. Why? Because the one we had on before didn't fix
the problems.
Problems with the Concert Network
They can't do shows. This is a key weakness.
• The CN would need about $100,000 in reserves against possi
ble loss in order to do very big shows (people big enough to fill,
fill, fill 9,000-seat Frost).
• Small shows, or non-rock shows, are relatively worthless.
Small hows and jazz, comedy, etc. are what they do now, and
baby, that ain't concerts.
• Medium-sized shows (John Cougar, the Tubes, Greg Kihn,
Eddie & the Tide) have a probability of loss they can't now ac
cept: the CN can't budget losses on every show now because
they have to support themselves.
They have vast fixed costs.
• The University requires them to have an advisor and requires
them to pay big-people money. This advisor costs $13,000 a
year for one-third time.
• The Director and other staff work somewhat on incentives
but have large base salaries. This costs many thousands — like
a good $8,000 — even if no shows are produced.
They need some incentives to perform.
The staff is currently paid a pretty comfortable amount
whether shows are done or not. If the staff does do great
shows, by far the largest part of the profits goes into reserves
rather than to further incentives.
Here are some possible solutions:
• First, lets admit the Network needs a yearly subsidy to do
serious programming, just as every other student group on
campus (except us! We make our money off holding groups'
money! And we sell you Flicks passes and notes). Now there
will be a Special Fee on ballot to provide $25,000 in subsidies
for five rock shows on campus. We ought to restrict use of this
Fee for those ]non-jazz, non-comedy, non-summer, non-
Dead[ shows and let the CN throw free Frost parties with any
excess.
I.i t u *
• Second, there's got to be a better way to pay for the advisor.
Like the University.
• Third, someone should put in place a serious incentive sys
tem to truly reward putting on shows. Pay them big bucks.
Seriously. Pay them whatever it takes to get them to do shows.
Who even cares if we have to pay them every bit of the profits,
and we can all pack up and go home and pass our damn
classes.
If you're up for concerts on campus, vote for this fee when it
gets out there at election (wheneven the hell that is). Maybe
we'll get it working finally.
IT'S EITHER SCREW THE JEWS OR
SCREW THE CHRISTIANS.
OR BOTH.
The dates of the election have been moved back to
the 14th & 15th.
Random Senator: Didn't we have this debate already?
Senate Chair: Yes, but we made a slight error.
Random Senator: Jeff, we are the Senate. We don't make errors.
Senate Chair: I'm sorry, but we can't hold the election the 28th &• 29th.
Random Senator: What?
Senate Chair: Look, many years ago some stupid fool wrote the weeks
the election must fall in into the Constitution. We can't have it the
28th &• 29th; we'll to pick a date and a campaign period that conflicts
with Passover or Easter. Or both.
Random Senator: Look, Jeff — does anyone have a copy of the
Constitution but us?
Senate Chair: What? Well, probably not.
Random Senator: See? Really, what's this religious holiday stuff
anyway? God can deal with it if you have to campaign on a holiday.
How did God get to be God anyway unless he did a hell of a lot of
knocking on doors? Think about it.

Whoever puts together the Senate legislation, knows all the
Senators, and writes the agenda runs the senate, right? And
that's the Senate Chair, right? Not if you get this job. The Clerk
of the Senate is paid big money to learn how the organization
runs and then handle the details the Senate Chair isn't smooth
enough to deal with. Contact Jeff Soukup, 328-4808.
AMUSING ASSISTANT ADMIN STRATI VE
MANAGER
This is a tough, but well-paid, job unless you keep your sense of
humor. You have to watch over and help out many or all of the
ASSU's eight (nine? ten? they keep coming) service projects,
many of whom are (hopefully) run by skilled people who know
more than you do (but not for long!) Learn from them and
learn to manage them. Contact jack Ottoway, 329-1809.
KIND AND SINCERE PROGRAM BOARD
BUDGET COUNSELOR
The Program Board's job is to give people shit (we don't pay
them to do it because giving shit is fun). Someone has to be nice
to groups to keep the suicide rate down. The Budget Counselor
advises groups on how to get money from the ASSU, which
he/she knows becuase he/she work here and gets paid to know.
Meet a million groups and help them out! Contact Robin Miller,
328-3512.
POWER-HUNGRY NOMINATIONS
COMMISSION MEMBERS

destinies. This is it right here. Nominations Commission
members select other students to sit on decision-making
Univerisity committees that rule your life. Learn how to
interview; learn how the University really works; meet scores of
the most aggressive studetns on campuse and earn favors from
them. Contact Christina Felton, 329-8935.
HOMELESS BOATHOUSE FACILITES
MANAGER
We give free housing to people who work at the Boathouse
(guess where! Hint: it's near a lot of water). We need someone
who likes to build things with tools and repair things to keep
them standing. In return, you save real big money on housing
for a whole year, get a great place to live, and have a big bay
window to make out in front of. Contact Lori Albert, 325-0724.

We put a new Special Fee for the Concert Network on the ballot
last Tuesday. Why? Because the one we had on before didn't fix
the problems.
Problems with the Concert Network
They can't do shows. This is a key weakness.
• The CN would need about $100,000 in reserves against possi
ble loss in order to do very big shows (people big enough to fill,
fill, fill 9,000-seat Frost).
• Small shows, or non-rock shows, are relatively worthless.
Small hows and jazz, comedy, etc. are what they do now, and
baby, that ain't concerts.
• Medium-sized shows (John Cougar, the Tubes, Greg Kihn,
Eddie & the Tide) have a probability of loss they can't now ac
cept: the CN can't budget losses on every show now because
they have to support themselves.
They have vast fixed costs.
• The University requires them to have an advisor and requires
them to pay big-people money. This advisor costs $13,000 a
year for one-third time.
• The Director and other staff work somewhat on incentives
but have large base salaries. This costs many thousands — like
a good $8,000 — even if no shows are produced.
They need some incentives to perform.
The staff is currently paid a pretty comfortable amount
whether shows are done or not. If the staff does do great
shows, by far the largest part of the profits goes into reserves
rather than to further incentives.
Here are some possible solutions:
• First, lets admit the Network needs a yearly subsidy to do
serious programming, just as every other student group on
campus (except us! We make our money off holding groups'
money! And we sell you Flicks passes and notes). Now there
will be a Special Fee on ballot to provide $25,000 in subsidies
for five rock shows on campus. We ought to restrict use of this
Fee for those ]non-jazz, non-comedy, non-summer, non-
Dead[ shows and let the CN throw free Frost parties with any
excess.
I.i t u *
• Second, there's got to be a better way to pay for the advisor.
Like the University.
• Third, someone should put in place a serious incentive sys
tem to truly reward putting on shows. Pay them big bucks.
Seriously. Pay them whatever it takes to get them to do shows.
Who even cares if we have to pay them every bit of the profits,
and we can all pack up and go home and pass our damn
classes.
If you're up for concerts on campus, vote for this fee when it
gets out there at election (wheneven the hell that is). Maybe
we'll get it working finally.
IT'S EITHER SCREW THE JEWS OR
SCREW THE CHRISTIANS.
OR BOTH.
The dates of the election have been moved back to
the 14th & 15th.
Random Senator: Didn't we have this debate already?
Senate Chair: Yes, but we made a slight error.
Random Senator: Jeff, we are the Senate. We don't make errors.
Senate Chair: I'm sorry, but we can't hold the election the 28th &• 29th.
Random Senator: What?
Senate Chair: Look, many years ago some stupid fool wrote the weeks
the election must fall in into the Constitution. We can't have it the
28th &• 29th; we'll to pick a date and a campaign period that conflicts
with Passover or Easter. Or both.
Random Senator: Look, Jeff — does anyone have a copy of the
Constitution but us?
Senate Chair: What? Well, probably not.
Random Senator: See? Really, what's this religious holiday stuff
anyway? God can deal with it if you have to campaign on a holiday.
How did God get to be God anyway unless he did a hell of a lot of
knocking on doors? Think about it.
Yes, we will PAY YOU MONEY for these jobs. We're talking
funds. We're talking cut you a check right now, by God. You
know you're mercenary, we know you're mercenary. Let's talk
deal.
