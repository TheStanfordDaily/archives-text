## Good deals offered for student loyalty 
### ELAYNE WELLS 
As college students, being per
ceived as "the elite of tomorrow"
certainly has its advantages.
Among these advantages are
that publishers offer magazines
and newspapers to students for
pennies apiece, in exchange for
their prestigious loyalty.
"Students are the future," ex
plains Richard Burch, director of
the education division at News
week. "Studies show that reader
ship loyalty developed fairly early
will continue into adulthood. We
hope that by offering the lowest
possible price to students now,
this kind of readership will be en
couraged."
This practice of reduced sub
scription rates for students is be
coming increasingly common, but
is by no means new.
According to John Stevens, the
local Education Service Bureau
representative for The Wall Street
Journal, that paper has been of
fering special rates for college stu
dents since 1947.
"We began giving reduced rates
as a special service for professor
initiated instructional programs
forty years ago," Stevens says. "We

still do it mainly as a matter of ser
vice to the students and their pro
fessors, and not for financial
return."
The question of immediate cost
effectiveness seems to be a
relatively unimportant one for
most publishers. Like The Wall
Street Journal, most publications
count on "reimbursement" when
the masses of students renew
their subscriptions after gradua
tion.
"There's no question offering
students a low price is beneficial,"
says Stevens. "Long-range accep
tance is what we're looking for as
the student population leaves col
lege and becomes more affluent."
This kind of potential Fortune
500 audience is what most
serious news magazines hope to
cultivate.
As Burch states, "Stanford stu
dents are obviously one of the
most desirable groups we target
because most will become profes
sionals and managers. We're
trying to establish an upscale au
dience for the future."
Also, the majority of the immed
iate revenue for a publication does
not come from customer subscrip
tions. but from advertisers. Thus

the amount lost in "half-price"
deals is negligible.
"By catering to the student
budget now," says a customer ser
vice representative from Time
magazine, "both parties win —
the students save money, and we
gain . . . advertisers who want to
reach that kind of large, young au
dience."
Michael Maas, marketing re
search analyst for American Edu
cational Services, agrees. "These
are the kind of demographics ad
vertisers are looking for. The more
college students there are in the
customer base, the easier it is for
magazines to attract advertisers.
"In the end, low rates for the
students translates into more rev
enue for the publications," he

says.
Part of this revenue goes to ser
vice bureaus in the form of com
mission. The National Association
of College Stores (NACS), one such
bureau, provides the bulletin an
nouncements tacked to kiosks all
over college campuses which offer
cut-rate subscriptions. The Stan
ford Bookstore, a member of the
NACS, also receives a commission
for including the subcription
cards with all purchases.
"It's a good program in which
the publishers can reach students
— it provides a unique opportu
nity for them to keep up with cur
rent events — and we're interested
in helping students," according to
Rosie Sims, operation manager of
the Bookstore.
