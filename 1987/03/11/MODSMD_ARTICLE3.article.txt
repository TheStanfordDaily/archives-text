# Loctite ban lifted
## 
### 
The Board of Trustees yester
day lifted a five-month ban on
the purchase of Loctite Corp.
stock.
In the most recent Sullivan
Principles evaluation. Loctite
achieved the highest rating
possible for its compliance with
the affirmative-action employ
ment principles.
The trustees imposed the
ban in October following a re
commendation by the 12-
member Commission on In
vestment Responsibility (CIR),
an advisory group of students,
faculty, staff and alumni. The
CIR had cited Loctite's

"inadequate" attitude toward
the Sullivan Principles and the
company's "passive" member
ship in the American Chamber
of Commerce.
Loctite, based in Newington,
Conn., sells industrial and con
sumer adhesives and sealants
through Loctite (South Africa)
Party, Ltd.
The trustees also approved a
CIR plan for voting on the many
stockholder resolutions that
Stanford will consider in the
next three months.
Each company in Stanford's
portfolio of South Africa-related
stocks faces a stockholder
sponsored resolution calling for
the company to withdraw from
South Africa. Company share
holders receive one vote for every
share of stock owned.
According to the plan approved
by the trustees, Stanford will vote
for withdrawal if the company in
question appears unwilling or
unable to commit significant re
sources and energy to combat the
effects of apartheid.
