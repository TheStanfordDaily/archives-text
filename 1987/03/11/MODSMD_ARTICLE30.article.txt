# Students reach out in E. Palo Alto

Freeze tag. Blob tag. Steal the bacon.
Squash the fruit. When was the last time you
played any of these games? Most of you prob
ably don't remember the rules anymore. Stu
dents from Toyon, Roble, Otero and Lagunlta,
however, have recently had a refresher course.
Every week about 100 energetic Stanford stu
dents venture out to elementary schools In
East Palo Alto to teach these games.
The program was organized through the
Public Service Center and Is run entirely by
student volunteers. Megan Swezey, project co
ordinator at Owen House, received a request
from the school superintendent for a physical
education program. California state law re
quires that such a program be included in the
elementary school curriculum, but local
schools have not developed one yet.
Senior Chris Braun came to Owen House

with an interest in linking his interest in
sports with a desire to get involved in East Palo
Alto. The two were brought together, and
Team '87 was born.The idea was to connect
each of the four dorms with an elementary
school. From then on, it has been the students'
job to plan a program that combines nutrition
awareness, organized sports, aerobic exercise
and recreational games.
"Bugs on bagels" is the name of this week's
healthy snack. Roble's team is using cream
cheese and raisins to create a fun food that's
nutritious too. Each dorm is free to plan its
own activities. This generates a team atmos
phere between students. Team '87 is more
than a one-time action project.
"it's the largest commitment to public ser
vice that I have seen in the dorm." says Braun,
a resident assistant in Toyon.
Everyone involved is certain that the pro
gram will continue through spring quarter.

There is even talk of expansion. Right now the
class is taught to fourth- through sixth-grade
students.
Swezey says,"The first- through third
graders are getting jealous." Current volun
teers are counting on next year's RAs to carry
on the project. The dorm/school relationship
may become a tradition.
Team '87 has generated enthusiasm in
everyone involved.
"They (the children) are quite a wild bunch."
says Kim Gross, a volunteer from Toyon.
"They're really excited and eager to please us."
"The kids surprise the hell out of you. You
think they won't know anything; they end up
teaching you the rules," admits Paul Hagen,
the Roble coordinator for the project.
Joe Davis, the principal at Costano Elemen
tary School, comments: "The kids are excited
about the program. It's the best thing that has
happened to them."
