# Matching wits in the East and West

### FELICIA PAIK Editorial staff 
The Stanford Chaparral was
established in 1890, and the
Harvard Lampoon's first issue
was published in 1876, but the
country's two oldest college
humor magazines have not
produced a joint issue — until
now.
Josh Weinstein, editor in
chief of the Chaparral, and Bill
Oakley, editor in chief of the
Lampoon, were best friends in
high school, where they es
talished a humor magazine.
The idea for a joint issue of the
two magazines was born when
Weinstein visited Oakley in
Cambridge this past summer.
"Harvard and Stanford are
considered the two top colleges
in the nation, and there is al
ways debate over which one is
number one, so we thought the
humor magazines should
square off as well," Oakley said.
"It is a meeting of the minds, so
to speak."
"People have asked which
university comes out looking
better. Neither of them do. The
magazine wins and comes out
looking the best," Weinstein
said.
The groundwork on the spe
cial issue began in November,
but real production began early
winter quarter. The staffs of
both magazines relied on the
telephone, telegrams and Fed
eral Express for communica
tion, according to Weinstein.
"At first, we were worried
about the logistics of the whole
project, but everything worked
out fine," he said.
The issue is 80 pages, and
neither magazine has a front
cover, according to Jim Suhre,
the business manager of the
Chaparral. The Stanford
Chaparral runs for forty pages.
The reader then can turn the
issue upside down and read the
Harvard Lampoon.
"We like to say we have an 80-
page magazine, and the Lam

poon took out a 40-page ad,"
Weinstein joked.
For the centerfold of the mag
azine, the staffs of the two
magazines invited the deans of
students affairs of each univer
sity to submit a guest column
or article. Dean of Student Af
fairs James Lyons and Har
vard's Dean of Students Archie
Epps both had humorous sub
missions, according to Wein
stein.
The Chaparral side of the
issue includes a parody of the
Harvard Crimson, a tour of
Stanford and some surprises.
"We're printing 10,000
copies, so we have been saying
we are producing 800,000
pages of jokes," Weinstein said.
This joint issue has brought
the Chaparral into the main
stream of Stanford life, accord
ing to Suhre.
"Alumnae call up the office,
students have dropped by ask
ing questions and even some of
my professors have asked
about this issue," Suhre said.
"It's definitely the talk of the
town, and no one will be disap
pointed," Weinstein added.
Weinstein said he hopes this
issue will help to spark stu
dents on other college cam
puses to revive their humor
magazines or to start their
own.
"We hope that this may start
a new renaissance of humor
magazines. During the 1950s
there were some 200 college
humor magazines." he said.
"Berkeley and the University
of Washington are restarting
their magazines, and we're
helping to organize." he said.
