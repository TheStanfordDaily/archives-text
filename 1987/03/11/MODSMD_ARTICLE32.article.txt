### JULIANA HORSEMAN 
If you happened to walk past the funeral held at the
Oval last Friday, you might have thought someone
died. Want to know who? Tune In next quarter to the
third episode of "General Dormitory." playing on a
SUNet television near you.
The new soap opera project, written, produced, di
rected and performed by Stanford students, is well
off the ground, with two episodes already edited and
four more to go.
"It's the most complete and well-organized student
channel I know." director Jon Louis said.
Headed by Louis and three other directors. Herby
Niles. Dave Ritscher and Natalie Beauchene. the 10-
member cast has been having a blast getting the first
couple of episodes completed.
"Everyone throws in their ideas, and the improvis
ing is great." said Louis, a Stanford senior.
"We get to break all kinds of rules, because this is
our project. If we make a mistake that will make
people laugh, we won't cut it. General Dormitory' is
certainly not for the generic viewer." he said.
The crew has enjoyed adding its special touches to

the episodes, including special effects for dreams
and even their own lyrics, which Louis may dare to
sing. Retakes are necessary, as the crew has only one
camera to work with, but the cast seemed Impressed
at the premiere showing of the first episode. "Back
from Break." last week.
Louis admitted that the lighting is weak in parts
but added that improvements are happening all the
time, especially in the sphere of acting.
"This soap is for actors who have watched a soap
on television and have felt that they could have done
a much better job. And they do. The chemistry be
tween all the characters Is fantastic." Louis said.
Louis and the crew plan to show six half-hour
episodes of "General Dormitory" next quarter, every
two weeks on Wednesday at 6:30 p.m. Only those
dorms on campus that receive SUNet Cable will be
able to see their schoolmates on film. That's the new
student channel 10. XTV.
The first episode Is scheduled to air April 8.
"If you have time to watch a soap, watch General
Dormitory.' " Louis said, noting that the program is
rated "S.O. â€” students only."
