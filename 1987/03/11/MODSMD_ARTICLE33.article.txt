# Menlo Park shelter helps homeless families
## 
### MONICA SIMMS 
At the end of Van Buren. a dead
end street in Menlo Park. 14
families live in an old, one-story
motel that was converted into a
shelter for homeless families two
years ago.
"People on the street look at you
walk by, and they know you're
going here because beyond a cer
tain point there's nowhere else
you could be going." said Wendi
Ward, one of the shelter's tenants.
"They look at you like you're
crazy, like you don't want to do
anything except have babies and
live off the taxpayers' money,"
Ward said.
"We're here because we've had a
streak of bad luck. That's all," she
added. "I'll always have compas
sion for the homeless once I get
through this with my family. And I
will get through this."
Ward. 25, lives with her hus
band, Terence, 26, and their six
year-old son Joseph at the Mid-
Peninsula Family Living Center,
the city's only shelter for homeless
families.
The center, a non-profit organi
zation partially supported by
federal Community Development
Block Grant funds, provides emer
gency housing for homeless

families for up to 28 days for a
minimal fee.
Barbara Whatley. the shelter's
coordinator and a former home
less person herself, said a com
mon assumption is that homeless
victims are single and are drug or
alcohol addicts.
According to sources at the Cali
fornia Department of Housing and
Community Development, many
are indeed drug or alcohol addicts,
as well as former mental institu
tion patients and veterans.
However. Whatley said the
families at the center are examples
of a new form of homelessness.
"They're not drug or alcohol ad
dicts. They're members of families
with children. And they're really
trying to get their lives together,"
she said.
"Sixty-five percent of this area's
homeless are members of home
less families that have fallen off
the track," she added. "Our ob
jective here is to put them back on
track."
In addition to offering families
temporary housing, the center
provides job and housing listings,
and weekly workshops on housing
and labor laws, interviewing skills
and other subjects that might
help them towards self-suffic
iency, Whatley said.

A major factor that contributes
to homelessness in this area is the
high cost of housing, according to
a study of California's homeless
conducted by the Department of
Housing.
"You'd think you were going out
of the country when you leave this
area because the rent is so high
here." Whatley said. "I tell families
that come here that if they have no
roots in this county they should
go to other areas like Sonoma or
Merced, where the rent isn't as
high."

Another factor that state
housing officials say may be
linked to homelessness here is the
effect of unemployment, particu
larly in computer-related fields.
San Mateo enjoys a relatively low
rate of unemployment at 4 per
cent, compared to the national
average of 7.3 percent, according
to the California Employment De
velopment Department and the
U.S. Department of Labor.
However, the recent decline in the
area's computer industry, and the
resulting job layoffs, may add to

the problem of homelessness here,
according to city officials.
Stephanie Orweller, another
tenant at the center, said: "I was
making *750 a week at my last job
as an electronics technician. With
Silicon Valley going down, and the
rent staying up. my family wound
up with nowhere to go. Also, my
husband is in construction, and
his back went out. So he couldn't
work, which didn't help."
Orweller, 26, said she applied to
companies in her field all around
the Bay Area without luck before
coming to the center. "I put appli
cations in every company from
here to San Jose. I must have a
stack of rejections this big! And
it's not that I don't have experi
ence. It's that the companies'
business has been going down,
and they're not hiring."
"Now I'm looking for (an apart
ment] and a job in Merced. Even if
I don't find a job right away, at
least I'll be able to live off of welfare
down there since the rent is
lower," she said.
In 1982, Whatley herself was
homeless. She had three children
at the time, and her husband had
quit his job. Waiting for welfare
funds to come through, the family
had no money and had to live out
of a U-Haul trailer for three weeks.

Eventually, they were taken in
by the Emergency Housing Con
sortium shelter in Santa Clara,
where Whatley later did volunteer
work leading to her present job.
"If they hadn't taken us in,"
Whatley said, "1 would have gone
nuts. I just couldn't take it any
more. I couldn't cook for my fam
ily, couldn't bathe, couldn't afford
gas for the car. I thought I was
going to lose my children.
"It was the worst time in my
life," she said "But it taught my a
lot. I vowed I would never be home
less again. Even if I have to live
from paycheck to paycheck, I'll al
ways pay my rent first. I'll never be
homeless again."
Looking ahead, Whatley said
she hopes the center will someday
be closed because homelessness
will no longer be a problem in this
area.
"I often dream that someday I'll
lose my job because there won't be
any more homeless people and I
won't be needed. I don't know how
likely that is to happen, but you
have to have a dream. Having no
dreams is like driving down a tun
nel with no light at the end. It may
never happen. But I'll stay here
until it does," she said.

victims are single and are drug or
alcohol addicts.
According to sources at the Cali
fornia Department of Housing and
Community Development, many
are indeed drug or alcohol addicts,
as well as former mental institu
tion patients and veterans.
However. Whatley said the
families at the center are examples
of a new form of homelessness.
"They're not drug or alcohol ad
dicts. They're members of families
with children. And they're really
trying to get their lives together,"
she said.
"Sixty-five percent of this area's
homeless are members of home
less families that have fallen off
the track," she added. "Our ob
jective here is to put them back on
track."
In addition to offering families
temporary housing, the center
provides job and housing listings,
and weekly workshops on housing
and labor laws, interviewing skills
and other subjects that might
help them towards self-suffic
iency, Whatley said.

A major factor that contributes
to homelessness in this area is the
high cost of housing, according to
a study of California's homeless
conducted by the Department of
Housing.
"You'd think you were going out
of the country when you leave this
area because the rent is so high
here." Whatley said. "I tell families
that come here that if they have no
roots in this county they should
go to other areas like Sonoma or
Merced, where the rent isn't as
high."

Another factor that state
housing officials say may be
linked to homelessness here is the
effect of unemployment, particu
larly in computer-related fields.
San Mateo enjoys a relatively low
rate of unemployment at 4 per
cent, compared to the national
average of 7.3 percent, according
to the California Employment De
velopment Department and the
U.S. Department of Labor.
However, the recent decline in the
area's computer industry, and the
resulting job layoffs, may add to

the problem of homelessness here,
according to city officials.
Stephanie Orweller, another
tenant at the center, said: "I was
making *750 a week at my last job
as an electronics technician. With
Silicon Valley going down, and the
rent staying up. my family wound
up with nowhere to go. Also, my
husband is in construction, and
his back went out. So he couldn't
work, which didn't help."
Orweller, 26, said she applied to
companies in her field all around
the Bay Area without luck before
coming to the center. "I put appli
cations in every company from
here to San Jose. I must have a
stack of rejections this big! And
it's not that I don't have experi
ence. It's that the companies'
business has been going down,
and they're not hiring."
"Now I'm looking for (an apart
ment] and a job in Merced. Even if
I don't find a job right away, at
least I'll be able to live off of welfare
down there since the rent is
lower," she said.
In 1982, Whatley herself was
homeless. She had three children
at the time, and her husband had
quit his job. Waiting for welfare
funds to come through, the family
had no money and had to live out
of a U-Haul trailer for three weeks.

Eventually, they were taken in
by the Emergency Housing Con
sortium shelter in Santa Clara,
where Whatley later did volunteer
work leading to her present job.
"If they hadn't taken us in,"
Whatley said, "1 would have gone
nuts. I just couldn't take it any
more. I couldn't cook for my fam
ily, couldn't bathe, couldn't afford
gas for the car. I thought I was
going to lose my children.
"It was the worst time in my
life," she said "But it taught my a
lot. I vowed I would never be home
less again. Even if I have to live
from paycheck to paycheck, I'll al
ways pay my rent first. I'll never be
homeless again."
Looking ahead, Whatley said
she hopes the center will someday
be closed because homelessness
will no longer be a problem in this
area.
"I often dream that someday I'll
lose my job because there won't be
any more homeless people and I
won't be needed. I don't know how
likely that is to happen, but you
have to have a dream. Having no
dreams is like driving down a tun
nel with no light at the end. It may
never happen. But I'll stay here
until it does," she said.

At the end of Van Buren. a dead
end street in Menlo Park. 14
families live in an old, one-story
motel that was converted into a
shelter for homeless families two
years ago.
"People on the street look at you
walk by, and they know you're
going here because beyond a cer
tain point there's nowhere else
you could be going." said Wendi
Ward, one of the shelter's tenants.
"They look at you like you're
crazy, like you don't want to do
anything except have babies and
live off the taxpayers' money,"
Ward said.
"We're here because we've had a
streak of bad luck. That's all," she
added. "I'll always have compas
sion for the homeless once I get
through this with my family. And I
will get through this."
Ward. 25, lives with her hus
band, Terence, 26, and their six
year-old son Joseph at the Mid-
Peninsula Family Living Center,
the city's only shelter for homeless
families.
The center, a non-profit organi
zation partially supported by
federal Community Development
Block Grant funds, provides emer
gency housing for homeless

families for up to 28 days for a
minimal fee.
Barbara Whatley. the shelter's
coordinator and a former home
less person herself, said a com
mon assumption is that homeless
victims are single and are drug or
alcohol addicts.
