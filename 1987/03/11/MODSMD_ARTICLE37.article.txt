# Study simulates comparable worth

A team of four Stanford economists claims
that the adverse effects a federal comparable
worth policy would have on the nation's eco
nomy are much smaller than most other ex
perts have predicted.
These findings were released recently follow
ing a two-year study using a model designed to
simulate the impact of a nationwide compara
ble worth employment policy on employment,
output, wages and economic efficiency.
The Stanford study was prepared by Eco
nomics Profs. Douglas Bernheim, Victor Fuchs
and John Shoven and graduate student Perry
Beider.
In recent years, feminist groups and labor
unions have advocated the idea of equal pay for
work of comparable worth as a way of helping
women economically. "The argument for com
parable worth has been that certain job op
tions have been traditionally difficult for

women to get into because of discrimination."
Bernheim said.
To remedy resulting disparities between
male and female salaries, a comparable worth
policy evaluates jobs by objective standards,
such as educational requirements and the
degree of responsibility, and sets wages ac
cording to those standards.
The study concludes that the economic
redistributive effects of comparable worth are
likely to be substantial. "Those who oppose
comparable worth because they expect it to
have adverse effects on aggregate economic
well-being will find some support in these
results, but those who favor comparable worth
because of its redistributive effects will also
find support," the report says.
"The greatest effect (of comparable worth) on
employment is an enormous increase in the
employment of married women. Married
women will crowd out single women in the
labor force. Single women will therefore be

working less hours, yet their Increase In wages
will make up that difference," Bernhelm said.
"If we only institute comparable worth in the
government and manufacturing sectors of the
economy, then the salaries of women in those
areas will be much higher than in the service
sector. Then a woman will be better off if she is
lucky enough to get a job in the covered areas,
while other women may be hurt because they
are unlucky." Bernheim said.
Although the study shows that single
women have the most to gain from comparable
worth and single men have the most to lose,
Bernheim said that "the most important
results from the study were the effects of the
comparable worth policy on GNP, employment
and overall economic well-being."
Beider, an engineering-economic systems
graduate student, agreed. "We were interested
in doing a descriptive study and we leave to our
readers the task of deciding whether compara
ble worth is a good thing," he said.
