## Men's swimming destroys records and league foes 
### ERIK ESELIUS Senior staff writer 
LONG BEACH — Splish, splash,
over. In lightning-like fashion, the
Stanford men's swimming team
steamrolled through the Pacific 10
Conference championships last
weekend, recording its sixth con
secutive Pac-10 title.
The No. 1-ranked Cardinal
jumped to an early first-day lead at
the Cerritos Olympic Swim Center
near Long Beach and continued
the charge in the meet's final two
days.
All told, Stanford scored a
record-setting 750.5 points.
Before this weekend, no team had
ever topped 600 points. California
finished second with 571.5, fol
lowed by Arizona State, (440),
USC (402.5), UCLA (359.5),
Arizona (295) and Washington
(128).
But that's not all — the fun with
numbers continues. Out of a
combined 17 individual and relay
events, the Cardinal racked up
eight victories. 10 second places
and four third places.
Coupled with the substantial
victory was the additional need for
airline tickets to Austin, Tex. En
tering the meet with five NCAA
qualifiers. Stanford added 10
more to the list. The NCAAs will be
held April 2 to 4 in Austin.
Surprisingly enough. Stanford
Coach Skip Kenney was rather
pleased. "Best Pac-10 meet ever,"
he said, referring to his team's

performance. "Basically, this is a
springboard for the NCAAs."
In a meet where most NCAA
qualifiers swam unshaved, the op
portunity arose for the Stanford
team depth to surface to the top.
The occasion went unwasted, es
pecially for sophomore Jay Mor
tenson.
An All-American last season.
Mortenson won both the 100-yard
backstroke and butterfly while
swimming the backstroke leg on
the victorious 400 medley relay
team.
Mortenson drew many gasps
from onlookers with his 400 med
ley lead-off. As his competitors
surfaced for breath after the start
ing dive. Mortenson instead
mimicked a migrating porpoise,
remaining submerged long after
his competition.
"It's literally just as strong as my
stroke." he said, explaining his
underwater exploration. "The
sacrifice is that I can't breathe."
Mortenson's victory in the 100
backstroke led a decisive Cardinal
sweep. An unshaved Sean
Murphy, last year's Pac-10 cham
pion. and Kurt Kroesche finished
behind Mortenson.
Stanford's Matt Nance also had
a superlative meet. On the first
day. Nance captured first in the
200 individual medley, while
freshman Byron Burson finished
third. In the 400 IM, Nance
touched home behind Cal's Jeff
