## Men's swimming destroys records and league foes 
### ERIK ESELIUS Senior staff writer 
LONG BEACH — Splish, splash,
over. In lightning-like fashion, the
Stanford men's swimming team
steamrolled through the Pacific 10
Conference championships last
weekend, recording its sixth con
secutive Pac-10 title.
The No. 1-ranked Cardinal
jumped to an early first-day lead at
the Cerritos Olympic Swim Center
near Long Beach and continued
the charge in the meet's final two
days.
All told, Stanford scored a
record-setting 750.5 points.
Before this weekend, no team had
ever topped 600 points. California
finished second with 571.5, fol
lowed by Arizona State, (440),
USC (402.5), UCLA (359.5),
Arizona (295) and Washington
(128).
But that's not all — the fun with
numbers continues. Out of a
combined 17 individual and relay
events, the Cardinal racked up
eight victories. 10 second places
and four third places.
Coupled with the substantial
victory was the additional need for
airline tickets to Austin, Tex. En
tering the meet with five NCAA
qualifiers. Stanford added 10
more to the list. The NCAAs will be
held April 2 to 4 in Austin.
Surprisingly enough. Stanford
Coach Skip Kenney was rather
pleased. "Best Pac-10 meet ever,"
he said, referring to his team's

performance. "Basically, this is a
springboard for the NCAAs."
In a meet where most NCAA
qualifiers swam unshaved, the op
portunity arose for the Stanford
team depth to surface to the top.
The occasion went unwasted, es
pecially for sophomore Jay Mor
tenson.
An All-American last season.
Mortenson won both the 100-yard
backstroke and butterfly while
swimming the backstroke leg on
the victorious 400 medley relay
team.
Mortenson drew many gasps
from onlookers with his 400 med
ley lead-off. As his competitors
surfaced for breath after the start
ing dive. Mortenson instead
mimicked a migrating porpoise,
remaining submerged long after
his competition.
"It's literally just as strong as my
stroke." he said, explaining his
underwater exploration. "The
sacrifice is that I can't breathe."
Mortenson's victory in the 100
backstroke led a decisive Cardinal
sweep. An unshaved Sean
Murphy, last year's Pac-10 cham
pion. and Kurt Kroesche finished
behind Mortenson.
Stanford's Matt Nance also had
a superlative meet. On the first
day. Nance captured first in the
200 individual medley, while
freshman Byron Burson finished
third. In the 400 IM, Nance
touched home behind Cal's Jeff
Prior and Ahead of Stanford's Jeff
Kostoff and Burson. who earned
third and fourth, respectively.
Nance added another second in
the 200 backstroke behind
teammate Murphy.
The Cardinal perhaps got its
biggest lift of the meet from a pre
viously unheralded source — the
50 freestyle, the event of freshman
Doug Lillydahl.
Swimming against Cal's Matt
Biondi, Lillydahl was just edged at
out the end and lost by one
hundredth of a second.
"Lillydahl was a complete
shock." Kenney said. "He's a com
pletely different swimmer when
rested and shaved. His swim really
motivated the team." Lillydahl led
a Stanford trio in the 100
freestyle, claiming fourth while
Burson and Hodge followed in
fifth and sixth.
The Cardinal also got an unex
pected boost from senior
breaststroker Sam McAdam.
McAdam, who qualified in the 100
breaststroke a day earlier before
screaming teammates, secured
second in the 200 breaststroke.
Of course, the championship
did not go by without a little noise
from some of Stanford's Olym
pians. Begin with Anthony
Mosses fine orchestration of the
200 butterfly. Coming home at
1.44.63, Mosse not only captured
first but also the Pac-10 record.
"I decided to give it a go and see
what happens," said Mosse, a

native of New Zealand. "I wanted
to swim well and get myself up for
the NCAAs."
Fellow Olympian Kostoff did his
own little song and swim as well.
Leading virtually from the onset,
Kostoff won the grueling 1,650 in
a solid 14:57.74, just three
seconds off the Pac-10 record.
Stanford's third Olympian,
Pablo Morales, who has won the
NCAA title in the 100 and 200 but
terfly the past three seasons and
the 200 1M in the past two, swam
unshaved and very unrested and
will no doubt benefit from the
week's rest before NCAAs. Morales
placed third in the 100 butterfly.
The Stanford NCAA qualifiers.
Murphy. Mosse, Morales and Kos
toff, will shave for the NCAAs,
saving their peak swims for this
meet.
"When you get the studs going
fast, it just gets everyone else
going faster," said Hodge, who in
addition to his 50 freestyle
placing, finished second in the
200 freestyle.
While individuals shone, so did
the Cardinal relays. The 400 med
ley quartet of Mortenson,
Schwartz, Morales and Burson re
corded a season-best time of
3:16.19 en route to victory. The
400 and 800 freestyle relay teams
came in second both times to Cal,
a perennially top-caliber freestyle
squad.
With the Pac-lOs behind, Stan
ford must shift gears and begin
preparing for the ensuing NCAA
championships, which the Card
inal has won the last two years.
