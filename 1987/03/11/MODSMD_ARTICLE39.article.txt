LOS ANGELES — As Stanford reserve guard Charles
Schwager put It, unless you win the whole thing, you've got
to end the season with a loss.
The Stanford men's basketball season ended with a loss
Friday night in the second round of the Pacific 10 Confer
ence Post-Season Tournament, as the Cardinal fell 86-71 to
the Washington. Stanford finished 15-13 overall and 9-9 in
the Pac-10 with the loss to the Huskies.
Washington, which followed up the win over Stanford
with a victory over Oregon on Saturday, lost 76-64 to league
champion UCLA (24-6 overall) in the tournament final Sun
day to wind up 18-4 overall and 10-8 In league play.
Washington, by virtue of its third-place finish in the Pac
-10, was invited to the National Invitational Tournament
Sunday night, along with California and Oregon State,
both of which tied the Huskies for third in the final stand
ings. UCLA and Arizona, the No. 1 and 2 teams in the Pac
-10, were both invited to the NCAA Tournament.
It was Schwager. a former member of the Gray Squad,
who had the shot of the game for the Cardinal — the high
light of a contest in which little went Stanford's way. The
senior's 10-foot toss, which went went about 20 feet up
ward before glancing the backboard on the way back down
and hurtling through the net with nine seconds left in the
game, came after a wild scramble for a rebound in the lane.
The last basket of Stanford's season gave the 6-foot guard
six points for his varsity career.
"1 worked on it in practice all last week,'' Schwager said.
"When 1 went in everybody said, Shoot it up, shoot it
up.' . . . That's the first time I've scored on the road — it's
kind of a fabled way to end it. I'm very happy. Of course. I'm
sad we lost, though."
There were few other bright points for the Cardinal,
which trailed most of the way — all but the first three
minutes, in fact. With 17:51 left in the first half. Stanford
tied the game. 6-6. on a Howard Wright free throw. But
Husky forward Phil Zevenbergen hit a 16-footer from the
