LOS ANGELES — As Stanford reserve guard Charles
Schwager put It, unless you win the whole thing, you've got
to end the season with a loss.
The Stanford men's basketball season ended with a loss
Friday night in the second round of the Pacific 10 Confer
ence Post-Season Tournament, as the Cardinal fell 86-71 to
the Washington. Stanford finished 15-13 overall and 9-9 in
the Pac-10 with the loss to the Huskies.
Washington, which followed up the win over Stanford
with a victory over Oregon on Saturday, lost 76-64 to league
champion UCLA (24-6 overall) in the tournament final Sun
day to wind up 18-4 overall and 10-8 In league play.
Washington, by virtue of its third-place finish in the Pac
-10, was invited to the National Invitational Tournament
Sunday night, along with California and Oregon State,
both of which tied the Huskies for third in the final stand
ings. UCLA and Arizona, the No. 1 and 2 teams in the Pac
-10, were both invited to the NCAA Tournament.
It was Schwager. a former member of the Gray Squad,
who had the shot of the game for the Cardinal — the high
light of a contest in which little went Stanford's way. The
senior's 10-foot toss, which went went about 20 feet up
ward before glancing the backboard on the way back down
and hurtling through the net with nine seconds left in the
game, came after a wild scramble for a rebound in the lane.
The last basket of Stanford's season gave the 6-foot guard
six points for his varsity career.
"1 worked on it in practice all last week,'' Schwager said.
"When 1 went in everybody said, Shoot it up, shoot it
up.' . . . That's the first time I've scored on the road — it's
kind of a fabled way to end it. I'm very happy. Of course. I'm
sad we lost, though."
There were few other bright points for the Cardinal,
which trailed most of the way — all but the first three
minutes, in fact. With 17:51 left in the first half. Stanford
tied the game. 6-6. on a Howard Wright free throw. But

foul line to put Washington up 8-
6, and it was downhill for the
Cardinal from then on.
Zevenbergen, In fact, do
minated the first half, scoring 16
points on 8-for-9 shooting and
single-handedly outrebounding
the entire Stanford squad, nine
boards to eight. Washington as a
team outrebounded the Cardinal
19-8 in the half.
"In the first half, I was hot," said
Zevenbergen, who finished with
20 points on the night. "I felt I
couldn't miss, so I just kept shoot
ing. As a team. I thought we
rebounded and executed very
well."
Washington executed extremely
well, shooting a torrid 73 percent
(19 for 26) from the floor in the
opening half. Stanford, on the
other hand, hit 46 percent — 12
for 26 — and worse, shot just 59
percent from the line, making only
10 of 27 free throws. The Cardinal
trailed 44-35 by the end of the
opening period.
"We got some good shots," Stan
ford Coach Mike Montgomery
said. "And If some more went
down, we could have made a game
of it. By halftime, we'd been out
rebounded by quite a bit and were
shooting 47 percent to their 73.
We were only down by nine, but we

didn't have much going for us."
"I had some open shots early in
the game, but I wasn't hitting a lot
of them," said Stanford forward
Todd Lichti, who contributed 10
of his 18 points in the first half. "I
was concerned during warmups
because I didn't like the way the
ball was coming out of my hands.
We had some good shots, but they
didn't all go, and then we forced it
a couple of times."
Despite missing a number of
shots (Lichti was 3-for-9 in the
opening half, 5-of-13 for the
game), the All-Pac-10 forward
became the first player in Stan
ford history to score 1,000 points
as a sophomore, and Just the
fourth player in Pac-10 history to
achieve that feat. Lichti scored his
I,oooth point with 6:17 to go in
the first half, hitting two free
throws after being fouled by Wash
ington's A 1 Moscatel. He now has
1,009 career points, moving up
four spots to become the Card
inal's No. 15 all-time leading
scorer.
Novian Whitsltt's 6-for-8 shoot
ing, Including a three-pointer and
a pair of free throws, kept the
Cardinal in the game during the
first half, and the senior guard
finished with a team-high 19
points. The deficit was just too
great, however, and Stanford
could not mount a comeback in
the second half, falling behind by
as much as 24 late in the game.

LOS ANGELES — As Stanford reserve guard Charles
Schwager put It, unless you win the whole thing, you've got
to end the season with a loss.
The Stanford men's basketball season ended with a loss
Friday night in the second round of the Pacific 10 Confer
ence Post-Season Tournament, as the Cardinal fell 86-71 to
the Washington. Stanford finished 15-13 overall and 9-9 in
the Pac-10 with the loss to the Huskies.
Washington, which followed up the win over Stanford
with a victory over Oregon on Saturday, lost 76-64 to league
champion UCLA (24-6 overall) in the tournament final Sun
day to wind up 18-4 overall and 10-8 In league play.
Washington, by virtue of its third-place finish in the Pac
-10, was invited to the National Invitational Tournament
Sunday night, along with California and Oregon State,
both of which tied the Huskies for third in the final stand
ings. UCLA and Arizona, the No. 1 and 2 teams in the Pac
-10, were both invited to the NCAA Tournament.
It was Schwager. a former member of the Gray Squad,
who had the shot of the game for the Cardinal — the high
light of a contest in which little went Stanford's way. The
senior's 10-foot toss, which went went about 20 feet up
ward before glancing the backboard on the way back down
and hurtling through the net with nine seconds left in the
game, came after a wild scramble for a rebound in the lane.
The last basket of Stanford's season gave the 6-foot guard
six points for his varsity career.
"1 worked on it in practice all last week,'' Schwager said.
"When 1 went in everybody said, Shoot it up, shoot it
up.' . . . That's the first time I've scored on the road — it's
kind of a fabled way to end it. I'm very happy. Of course. I'm
sad we lost, though."
There were few other bright points for the Cardinal,
which trailed most of the way — all but the first three
minutes, in fact. With 17:51 left in the first half. Stanford
tied the game. 6-6. on a Howard Wright free throw. But

6, and it was downhill for the
Cardinal from then on.
Zevenbergen, In fact, do
minated the first half, scoring 16
points on 8-for-9 shooting and
single-handedly outrebounding
the entire Stanford squad, nine
boards to eight. Washington as a
team outrebounded the Cardinal
19-8 in the half.
"In the first half, I was hot," said
Zevenbergen, who finished with
20 points on the night. "I felt I
couldn't miss, so I just kept shoot
ing. As a team. I thought we
rebounded and executed very
well."
Washington executed extremely
well, shooting a torrid 73 percent
(19 for 26) from the floor in the
opening half. Stanford, on the
other hand, hit 46 percent — 12
for 26 — and worse, shot just 59
percent from the line, making only
10 of 27 free throws. The Cardinal
trailed 44-35 by the end of the
opening period.
"We got some good shots," Stan
ford Coach Mike Montgomery
said. "And If some more went
down, we could have made a game
of it. By halftime, we'd been out
rebounded by quite a bit and were
shooting 47 percent to their 73.
We were only down by nine, but we

didn't have much going for us."
"I had some open shots early in
the game, but I wasn't hitting a lot
of them," said Stanford forward
Todd Lichti, who contributed 10
of his 18 points in the first half. "I
was concerned during warmups
