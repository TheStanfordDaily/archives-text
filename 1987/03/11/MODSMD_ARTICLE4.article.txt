# Students to help in Salvador
## 
### DAVID LIPPEATT Editorial staff 
El Salvador Is a small country with big
problems.
Over the past six years, thousands of
people, many of them civilians, have
been killed in this Central American na
tion's brutal civil war. Thousands more
peasants — one-fourth of the total popu
lation — have been driven off of their
land and into makeshift refugee camps.
Crops, roads and dwellings are routinely
damaged or destroyed In the course of
the fighting. Electrical power is often
cut in large areas of the country. Since
the war began, per capita income has

dropped by one-fourth, and official un
employment has risen from less than 10
percent to a staggering 40 percent.
And 14 Stanford students will be
spending their spring break there.
Between March 20 and 30, the stu
dents and two advisers, under the aus
pices of the Stanford Student El Sal
vador Aid Project (SSELAP). will spend
their days helping students, faculty, and
staff at the National University of San
Salvador in El Salvador rebuild class
rooms and other facilities destroyed by a
disastrous earthquake in October 1986.
The project is being sponsored by the
Ecumenical Ministries at Stanford.
Memorial Church, the Public Service

Center and SWOPSI (Student
Workshops on Political and Social Is
sues).
The trip has three main goals, accord
ing to Rev. Herb Schmidt, Stanford Lu
theran Campus Pastor and one of the or
ganizers of the project:
□ Donating both labor (from the Stan
ford students) and money (>4,000
raised from Stanford faculty members)
to the National University for use in
facilities restoration.
□ Giving the Stanford students a
firsthand look at some of the devasta
tion the civil war has caused and
deepening their understanding of
the political situation in El Sal
vador.
□ Allowing the students in the
group to share what they learn
with other members of the Stan
ford and South Bay communities.
While in the country, besides
donating their labor (which will be
of limited help In a 10-day period),
the students want to meet people,
hear stories and communicate,
senior Patrick Jean-Pierre ex
plained.
"We're going to spend about
four to five hours each day
working to rebuild the univer
sity." he said. "The rest of our
time will be spent meeting with
representatives of human rights
organizations, labor unions and
the Catholic church."
"We will also visit the U.S. em
bassy. and we may take a field trip
to a refugee camp,"he added.
"It will be a learning experi
ence," said junior Steven Bryan,
another student making the trip.
"The U.S. has a large presence in
Central America, but people don't
know much about the region. . . .
We want to come back and inform
people." he said.
"We're going down there to
bring the problem home to Stan
ford students ... to Americans,"
said senior Laurie Larson, an
other project participant.

The students also stressed the
importance they place on building
relationships with the Sal
vadorans they meet in order to
"promote communication and an
understanding for the future," ac
cording to Jean-Pierre.
"I want to let those people know
how much we want to help," he
added.
SSELAP had its beginnings last
quarter, when students in a
SWOPSI sanctuary class taught by
Schmidt began exploring the idea
of developing a sister relationship
between Stanford and a university
in El Salvador.
When Schmidt and Tom
Ambrogi, acting Dean of the
Chapel for Memorial Church, were
In El Salvador in November for a
peace conference, they took the
idea one step further. While visit
ing the National University of San
Salvador, they saw students
working to rebuild classrooms
that had been destroyed in the
earthquake a month before.
"I thought, 'Wouldn't it be fan
tastic to have Stanford students
down here working side by side
with the Salvadorans?' " Ambrogi
said.
Thus inspired, Ambrogi and
Schmidt then met with the Na
tional University's rector, student
leaders and the president of the
university assembly. Out of these
meetings came an invitation from

university officials to bring a
Stanford delegation to San Sal
vador.
Once they had returned to Stan
ford, Schmidt and Ambrogi
worked to obtain sponsor support
for the project, and arranged aca
demic credit for the students in
volved.
The trip represents a substan
tial academic challenge for the
students, according to Schmidt.
Each participant will receive three
units of SWOPSI credit for the trip
and subsequent associated activi
ties, he said. Each student will be
responsible for writing a personal
paper, presenting a slide show
and planning and participating in
at least two educational forums
about the trip. The group as a
whole will also write a common
paper.
Schmidt feels that the experi
ence will be a very valuable one for
the students. "It has always both
ered me that every year at spring
break students spend hundreds
or thousands of dollars going to
Hawaii, the Caribbean or the
beaches of Mexico. . . . We're
trying to give them an opportunity
to instead enhance their educa
tion and provide important volun
teer service." he said.
The students have been given
the financial responsibility of

raising $1,000 each for the proj
ect. This will cover costs of travel,
room, board and materials for the
reconstruction of the National
University, Jean-Pierre explained.
The project also received sup
port from a Jackson Browne bene

fit concert held last Sunday at the
San Jose Performing Arts Center.
SSELAP received some of the con
cert's proceeds, along with the
Palo Alto-Stanford Medical Aid
Committee for Central America
and the South Bay Sanctuary Cov
enant. Senior Lise Grande, who
will go on the trip, is director of
the covenant.
At the concert, which was
"absolutely stunning," according
to Schmidt, SSELAP members

chauffeured band members and
sold T-shirts.
The project group also met last
weekend for a retreat and orienta
tion. This "went really well," Jean-
Pierre said. "We all learned a lot
about the situation in El Salvador,
and we got to know each other bet
ter."
During the orientation.
Ambrogi advised the students to
"look into the eyes" of the people
they meet in El Salvador and see

what they have been through.
The Stanford students will be
strongly affected, he warned.
Besides Jean-Pierre, Bryan, Lar
son and Grande, the student
group includes seniors Thomas
Lee and Scott Shaeffer; juniors
John Gundfarr, Mark Gilchrist,
Kirsten Jones and Karen Marangi;
sophomores Gayatri Tahiliani and
Nannette Thompson; and fresh
men Kristin Jordahl and Scott
Pedersen.

peace conference, they took the
idea one step further. While visit
ing the National University of San
Salvador, they saw students
working to rebuild classrooms
that had been destroyed in the
earthquake a month before.
"I thought, 'Wouldn't it be fan
tastic to have Stanford students
down here working side by side
with the Salvadorans?' " Ambrogi
said.
Thus inspired, Ambrogi and
Schmidt then met with the Na
tional University's rector, student
leaders and the president of the
university assembly. Out of these
meetings came an invitation from

university officials to bring a
Stanford delegation to San Sal
vador.
Once they had returned to Stan
ford, Schmidt and Ambrogi
worked to obtain sponsor support
for the project, and arranged aca
demic credit for the students in
volved.
The trip represents a substan
tial academic challenge for the
students, according to Schmidt.
Each participant will receive three
units of SWOPSI credit for the trip
and subsequent associated activi
ties, he said. Each student will be
responsible for writing a personal
paper, presenting a slide show
and planning and participating in
at least two educational forums
about the trip. The group as a
whole will also write a common
paper.
Schmidt feels that the experi
ence will be a very valuable one for
the students. "It has always both
ered me that every year at spring
break students spend hundreds
or thousands of dollars going to
Hawaii, the Caribbean or the
beaches of Mexico. . . . We're
trying to give them an opportunity
to instead enhance their educa
tion and provide important volun
teer service." he said.
The students have been given

raising $1,000 each for the proj
ect. This will cover costs of travel,
room, board and materials for the
reconstruction of the National
University, Jean-Pierre explained.
The project also received sup
port from a Jackson Browne bene

fit concert held last Sunday at the
San Jose Performing Arts Center.
SSELAP received some of the con
cert's proceeds, along with the
Palo Alto-Stanford Medical Aid
Committee for Central America
and the South Bay Sanctuary Cov
enant. Senior Lise Grande, who
will go on the trip, is director of
the covenant.
At the concert, which was
"absolutely stunning," according
to Schmidt, SSELAP members

chauffeured band members and
sold T-shirts.
The project group also met last
weekend for a retreat and orienta
tion. This "went really well," Jean-
Pierre said. "We all learned a lot
about the situation in El Salvador,
and we got to know each other bet
ter."
During the orientation.
Ambrogi advised the students to
"look into the eyes" of the people
they meet in El Salvador and see

what they have been through.
The Stanford students will be
strongly affected, he warned.
Besides Jean-Pierre, Bryan, Lar
son and Grande, the student
group includes seniors Thomas
Lee and Scott Shaeffer; juniors
John Gundfarr, Mark Gilchrist,

sophomores Gayatri Tahiliani and

El Salvador Is a small country with big
problems.
Over the past six years, thousands of
people, many of them civilians, have
been killed in this Central American na
tion's brutal civil war. Thousands more
peasants — one-fourth of the total popu
lation — have been driven off of their
land and into makeshift refugee camps.
Crops, roads and dwellings are routinely
damaged or destroyed In the course of
the fighting. Electrical power is often
cut in large areas of the country. Since
the war began, per capita income has

dropped by one-fourth, and official un
employment has risen from less than 10
percent to a staggering 40 percent.
And 14 Stanford students will be
spending their spring break there.
Between March 20 and 30, the stu
dents and two advisers, under the aus
pices of the Stanford Student El Sal
vador Aid Project (SSELAP). will spend
their days helping students, faculty, and
staff at the National University of San
Salvador in El Salvador rebuild class
rooms and other facilities destroyed by a
disastrous earthquake in October 1986.
The project is being sponsored by the
Ecumenical Ministries at Stanford.
Memorial Church, the Public Service

Center and SWOPSI (Student
Workshops on Political and Social Is
sues).
The trip has three main goals, accord
ing to Rev. Herb Schmidt, Stanford Lu
theran Campus Pastor and one of the or
ganizers of the project:
□ Donating both labor (from the Stan
ford students) and money (>4,000
raised from Stanford faculty members)
to the National University for use in
facilities restoration.
□ Giving the Stanford students a
firsthand look at some of the devasta
tion the civil war has caused and
deepening their understanding of
the political situation in El Sal
vador.
□ Allowing the students in the
group to share what they learn
with other members of the Stan
ford and South Bay communities.
While in the country, besides
donating their labor (which will be
of limited help In a 10-day period),
the students want to meet people,
hear stories and communicate,
senior Patrick Jean-Pierre ex
plained.
"We're going to spend about
four to five hours each day
working to rebuild the univer
sity." he said. "The rest of our
time will be spent meeting with
representatives of human rights
organizations, labor unions and
the Catholic church."
"We will also visit the U.S. em
bassy. and we may take a field trip
to a refugee camp,"he added.
"It will be a learning experi
ence," said junior Steven Bryan,
another student making the trip.
"The U.S. has a large presence in
Central America, but people don't
know much about the region. . . .
We want to come back and inform
people." he said.
"We're going down there to
bring the problem home to Stan
ford students ... to Americans,"
said senior Laurie Larson, an
other project participant.

The students also stressed the
importance they place on building
relationships with the Sal
vadorans they meet in order to
"promote communication and an
understanding for the future," ac
cording to Jean-Pierre.
"I want to let those people know
how much we want to help," he
added.
SSELAP had its beginnings last
quarter, when students in a
SWOPSI sanctuary class taught by
Schmidt began exploring the idea
of developing a sister relationship
between Stanford and a university
in El Salvador.
