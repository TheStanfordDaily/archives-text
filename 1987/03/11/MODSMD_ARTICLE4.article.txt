# Students to help in Salvador
## 
### DAVID LIPPEATT Editorial staff 
El Salvador Is a small country with big
problems.
Over the past six years, thousands of
people, many of them civilians, have
been killed in this Central American na
tion's brutal civil war. Thousands more
peasants — one-fourth of the total popu
lation — have been driven off of their
land and into makeshift refugee camps.
Crops, roads and dwellings are routinely
damaged or destroyed In the course of
the fighting. Electrical power is often
cut in large areas of the country. Since
the war began, per capita income has

dropped by one-fourth, and official un
employment has risen from less than 10
percent to a staggering 40 percent.
And 14 Stanford students will be
spending their spring break there.
Between March 20 and 30, the stu
dents and two advisers, under the aus
pices of the Stanford Student El Sal
vador Aid Project (SSELAP). will spend
their days helping students, faculty, and
staff at the National University of San
Salvador in El Salvador rebuild class
rooms and other facilities destroyed by a
disastrous earthquake in October 1986.
The project is being sponsored by the
Ecumenical Ministries at Stanford.
Memorial Church, the Public Service

Center and SWOPSI (Student
Workshops on Political and Social Is

ganizers of the project:
□ Donating both labor (from the Stan
ford students) and money (>4,000
raised from Stanford faculty members)
to the National University for use in
facilities restoration.
□ Giving the Stanford students a
firsthand look at some of the devasta
tion the civil war has caused and
