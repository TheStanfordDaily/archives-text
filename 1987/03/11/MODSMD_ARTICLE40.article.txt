# Baseball sweeps error-prone Arizona
## 
### TOM SENF Editorial staff 
The scorebook In last weekend s series
between Stanford and Arizona was littered
with E's, but the only letters that mattered
to the Cardinal were the three W's that went
into its record, as it swept three games from
the defending national champion Wildcats
at Sunken Diamond.
After falling behind 5-1. Stanford
stormed back to win 8-6 on Sunday. The
Cardinal took a 10-6 decision the previous
day after blowing the Wildcats out 14-4 on
Friday.
The sweep put Stanford into third place
in the Pacific 10 Southern Division at 4-2.
just a game behind conference-leading USC
(5-1) and a half-game in back of UCLA (6-3).
Arizona fell to 4-5 In the Six-Pac. The Card
inal is now 15-8 overall; the Wildcats are 14-
8.
Next to an Arizona win. the rarest things
this weekend were a routine groundball and
an earned run. Of the 48 runs scored in the
three games. 27 were unearned — the
result of 19 errors.
As one might expect, the sweepees were
more generous than the sweepers. Arizona
committed 11 errors, leading to 16 un
earned runs. "We've got to repair the
fences." Arizona Coach Jerry Kindall said.
"We're making too many errors, too many
physical mistakes at crucial times."
"It was an exciting series," Stanford
catcher Doug Robbins said. "There were a
lot of things you don't usually see — a lot of
sloppy defense and clutch hits."
Robbins provided a lot of hits, clutch and

otherwise, going 7-for-13 to raise his
average to .354, while scoring seven runs
and knocking in four more. Other offensive
stars for Stanford were freshman right
fielder Paul Carey, who went 6-for-10 with
four RBls, and seniors Ruben Amaro and
Toi Cook, who scored six runs apiece.
Three errors and a maddening series of
cheap hits staked Arizona to a 5-1 lead in
the third on Sunday, but Robbins then
stopped the Wildcats in their tracks —
literally.
With runners at the corners and one out,
Alan Zinter broke for home on Glenn Bax
ley's chopper to Ed Sprague at third.
Sprague's throw to Robbins at the plate
arrived well ahead of the runner, and when
Zinter declined to slow down or slide, Rob
bins sent him sprawling toward first base
with a two-handed tag.
"The runner was coming in standing up,"
Robbins said. "I've been in that place before
when I've gotten crunched, and it's not too
pleasant. He kind of let up at the last min
ute, and 1 became the aggressor."
"Doug has played real well for us,
(Sunday) especially." Stanford Coach Mark
Marquess said. "He got us going offensively,
and he got us pumped up with that play at
home plate. It couldn't have come at a better
time for us."
Stanford evened the score at five in the
bottom of the inning, scoring four un
earned runs with the help of two Arizona er
rors. Robbins contributed an RBI single to
the rally.
The game remained tied until the bottom

of the sixth, but Robbins then
untied it with a leadoff homer — a
gravity-defying line drive that
crashed Into the trees beyond the
left-field fence. "I was guessing
fastball and I got it,"he said.
After Stanford extended its lead
to 8-5 in the seventh. Arizona
nicked winning pitcher Steve
Chitren (3-1) for a run in the
eighth, but could get no closer.
Chitren and starter Jim Price
stranded 12 Wildcats on the day.
Those 12 men left on base
represented an improvement for

Arizona, which had stranded 13
the previous day. The Wildcats
could squeeze only six runs out of
11 hits, seven walks and two Stan
ford errors.
Robbins tied the game at two
with an RBI single in the second,
then with runners at second and
third, shortstop Greg Fowble
threw Carey's infield single into
the Stanford dugout for two more
runs. Jeff Saenger's subsequent
RBI single to left put the Cardinal
ahead 5-2.
Stanford added a run to its lead
in the sixth, but in the seventh it
was the Cardinal's turn to play
give-away. Starter Jack McDowell
should have had a 1-2-3 inning,
but Frank Carey's error on Bax

ley's leadoff grounder gave the
Wildcats an extra out, and they
took advantage of it, scoring four
runs on two doubles, an error by
Cook and a J.T. Snow single that
chased a tiring McDowell.
The Wildcats could not stand
prosperity, however. In the bot
tom of the inning, two more
Fowble throwing errors led to the
game's final four runs. The key
hits were Saenger's two-out RBI
single and Frank Carey's run
scoring double inside first base.
Arizona figured to have an ad
vantage in Friday's game, with ace
Gilbert Heredia going against Lee
Plemel. Heredia, 16-3 a year ago,
came into the game with a 4-0
record and a 3.04 ERA. Plemel,

meanwhile, came In at 2-4 and
had been pounded in his previous
two starts by UC-Santa Barbara
and UCLA.
Plemel pitched brilliantly,
however, allowing just six hits and
no earned runs In a complete
game performance, while Heredla
failed to escape the second inning.
The Cardinal clobbered the All
Six-Pac peformer for six runs and
nine hits in just 1 2/3 innings.
Amaro led the onslaught with a
pair of doubles and later added a
triple off reliever Wayne Helm. For
the game, Amaro was 3-for-5 and
scored four runs — not a bad day
for a leadoff man, or anyone else.
"These guys have been driving
me in, and everybody's swinging

the bat well," Amaro said after the
Cardinal's 13-hit onslaught.
A Stanford error prolonged the
Arizona third long enough for
Chip Hale to hit a three-run
homer that brought the Wildcats
closer at 6-4, but a two-run triple
in the fifth by Frank Carey gave
the Cardinal more breathing
room. Then, in the sixth, the
Wildcats flat-out embarrassed
themselves.
A play-by-play description of the
Inning would be complicated (not
to mention nauseating), but the
statistics should tell the story:
Four runs, no hits, four errors,
three walks, one wild pitch and
one question — is this really the
team that won the College World

Wrestling is a sport that many people don't really
understand. However, one need not be a master to
realize that the Stanford team, which qualified two
wrestlers for NCAAs this past weekend at the Pacific
10 Conference championships, has had a respect
able season.
Senior Scott Wiggen and junior Terry Mclntyre,
who compete at 150 and 190 pounds respectively,
won the right to compete in the NCAA finals March
19 to 21. Though the team will probably not fare very
well with only two competitors in the meet (the NCAA
championship team is determined by compiling the
finishes of each squad's members, rather than by
direct competition), the berths are valuable nonethe
less.
"On paper, it doesn't look like we did well, but even
in matches we did lose, we did better than we did
before," Stanford Coach Chris Horpel said. "For the
most part, I feel pretty good."
Mclntyre was seeded fourth and finished fourth in
the competition. "Terry did exactly what he was
supposed to do," Horpel said.
Wiggen, a 1985 Ail-American, managed a third
place finish despite a sprained ankle that had him on
crutches the Friday before the tournament. The
senior entered the meet as the top seed and ranked
No. 6 nationally.
"Scott put in the gutsiest performance I've ever
seen." Horpel said.
"My one frustration is that Kurt Kassulke didn't
qualify." Horpel said. The senior has come close to
qualifying each year, and "one lateral drop cost him
his first NCAA trip."

Series last year?
Plemel, who extended his mas
tery (4-0 lifetime) of the Wildcats
with a six-hitter, went back to his
strengths — breaking pitches and
changing speeds — to shake his
recent slump.
Another rocky outing could
have cost the junior right-hander
his spot In the rotation. "It was
getting down to that," he said.
"Tuesday (three hltless innings
against USF) was big for me to get
back on track."

then with runners at second and
third, shortstop Greg Fowble
threw Carey's infield single into
the Stanford dugout for two more
runs. Jeff Saenger's subsequent
RBI single to left put the Cardinal
ahead 5-2.
Stanford added a run to its lead
in the sixth, but in the seventh it
was the Cardinal's turn to play
give-away. Starter Jack McDowell
should have had a 1-2-3 inning,
but Frank Carey's error on Bax

ley's leadoff grounder gave the
Wildcats an extra out, and they
took advantage of it, scoring four
runs on two doubles, an error by
Cook and a J.T. Snow single that
chased a tiring McDowell.
The Wildcats could not stand
prosperity, however. In the bot
tom of the inning, two more
Fowble throwing errors led to the
game's final four runs. The key
hits were Saenger's two-out RBI
single and Frank Carey's run
scoring double inside first base.
Arizona figured to have an ad
vantage in Friday's game, with ace
Gilbert Heredia going against Lee
Plemel. Heredia, 16-3 a year ago,
came into the game with a 4-0
record and a 3.04 ERA. Plemel,

meanwhile, came In at 2-4 and
had been pounded in his previous
two starts by UC-Santa Barbara
and UCLA.
Plemel pitched brilliantly,
however, allowing just six hits and
no earned runs In a complete
game performance, while Heredla
failed to escape the second inning.
The Cardinal clobbered the All
Six-Pac peformer for six runs and
nine hits in just 1 2/3 innings.
Amaro led the onslaught with a
pair of doubles and later added a
triple off reliever Wayne Helm. For
the game, Amaro was 3-for-5 and
scored four runs — not a bad day
for a leadoff man, or anyone else.
"These guys have been driving
me in, and everybody's swinging

the bat well," Amaro said after the
Cardinal's 13-hit onslaught.
A Stanford error prolonged the
Arizona third long enough for
Chip Hale to hit a three-run
homer that brought the Wildcats
closer at 6-4, but a two-run triple
in the fifth by Frank Carey gave
the Cardinal more breathing
room. Then, in the sixth, the
Wildcats flat-out embarrassed
themselves.
A play-by-play description of the
Inning would be complicated (not
to mention nauseating), but the
statistics should tell the story:
Four runs, no hits, four errors,
three walks, one wild pitch and
one question — is this really the
team that won the College World

Wrestling is a sport that many people don't really
understand. However, one need not be a master to
realize that the Stanford team, which qualified two
wrestlers for NCAAs this past weekend at the Pacific
10 Conference championships, has had a respect
able season.
Senior Scott Wiggen and junior Terry Mclntyre,
who compete at 150 and 190 pounds respectively,
won the right to compete in the NCAA finals March
19 to 21. Though the team will probably not fare very
well with only two competitors in the meet (the NCAA
championship team is determined by compiling the
finishes of each squad's members, rather than by
direct competition), the berths are valuable nonethe
less.
"On paper, it doesn't look like we did well, but even
in matches we did lose, we did better than we did
before," Stanford Coach Chris Horpel said. "For the
most part, I feel pretty good."
Mclntyre was seeded fourth and finished fourth in
the competition. "Terry did exactly what he was
supposed to do," Horpel said.
Wiggen, a 1985 Ail-American, managed a third
place finish despite a sprained ankle that had him on
crutches the Friday before the tournament. The
senior entered the meet as the top seed and ranked
No. 6 nationally.
"Scott put in the gutsiest performance I've ever
seen." Horpel said.
"My one frustration is that Kurt Kassulke didn't
qualify." Horpel said. The senior has come close to
qualifying each year, and "one lateral drop cost him
his first NCAA trip."

Series last year?
Plemel, who extended his mas
tery (4-0 lifetime) of the Wildcats
with a six-hitter, went back to his
strengths — breaking pitches and
changing speeds — to shake his
recent slump.
Another rocky outing could
have cost the junior right-hander
his spot In the rotation. "It was
getting down to that," he said.
"Tuesday (three hltless innings
against USF) was big for me to get
back on track."
Card notes
In other Six-Pac action last
weekend. USC won two of three from
California (1-5) at Evans Diamond In
Berkeley, while UCLA did the same to
Arizona State (1-5) In Tempe.
The scorebook In last weekend s series
between Stanford and Arizona was littered
with E's, but the only letters that mattered
to the Cardinal were the three W's that went
into its record, as it swept three games from
the defending national champion Wildcats
at Sunken Diamond.
After falling behind 5-1. Stanford
stormed back to win 8-6 on Sunday. The
Cardinal took a 10-6 decision the previous
day after blowing the Wildcats out 14-4 on
Friday.
The sweep put Stanford into third place
in the Pacific 10 Southern Division at 4-2.
just a game behind conference-leading USC
(5-1) and a half-game in back of UCLA (6-3).
Arizona fell to 4-5 In the Six-Pac. The Card
inal is now 15-8 overall; the Wildcats are 14-
8.
Next to an Arizona win. the rarest things
this weekend were a routine groundball and
an earned run. Of the 48 runs scored in the
three games. 27 were unearned — the
result of 19 errors.
As one might expect, the sweepees were
more generous than the sweepers. Arizona
committed 11 errors, leading to 16 un
earned runs. "We've got to repair the
fences." Arizona Coach Jerry Kindall said.
"We're making too many errors, too many
physical mistakes at crucial times."
"It was an exciting series," Stanford
catcher Doug Robbins said. "There were a
lot of things you don't usually see — a lot of
sloppy defense and clutch hits."
Robbins provided a lot of hits, clutch and

otherwise, going 7-for-13 to raise his
average to .354, while scoring seven runs
and knocking in four more. Other offensive
stars for Stanford were freshman right
fielder Paul Carey, who went 6-for-10 with
four RBls, and seniors Ruben Amaro and
Toi Cook, who scored six runs apiece.
Three errors and a maddening series of
cheap hits staked Arizona to a 5-1 lead in
the third on Sunday, but Robbins then
stopped the Wildcats in their tracks —
literally.
With runners at the corners and one out,
Alan Zinter broke for home on Glenn Bax
ley's chopper to Ed Sprague at third.
Sprague's throw to Robbins at the plate
arrived well ahead of the runner, and when
Zinter declined to slow down or slide, Rob
bins sent him sprawling toward first base
with a two-handed tag.
"The runner was coming in standing up,"
Robbins said. "I've been in that place before
when I've gotten crunched, and it's not too
pleasant. He kind of let up at the last min
ute, and 1 became the aggressor."
"Doug has played real well for us,
(Sunday) especially." Stanford Coach Mark
Marquess said. "He got us going offensively,
and he got us pumped up with that play at
home plate. It couldn't have come at a better
time for us."
Stanford evened the score at five in the
bottom of the inning, scoring four un
earned runs with the help of two Arizona er
rors. Robbins contributed an RBI single to
the rally.
The game remained tied until the bottom

of the sixth, but Robbins then
untied it with a leadoff homer — a
gravity-defying line drive that
crashed Into the trees beyond the
left-field fence. "I was guessing
fastball and I got it,"he said.
After Stanford extended its lead
to 8-5 in the seventh. Arizona
nicked winning pitcher Steve
Chitren (3-1) for a run in the
eighth, but could get no closer.
Chitren and starter Jim Price
stranded 12 Wildcats on the day.
