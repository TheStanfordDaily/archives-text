# Baseball sweeps error-prone Arizona

### TOM SENF Editorial staff 
The scorebook In last weekend s series
between Stanford and Arizona was littered
with E's, but the only letters that mattered
to the Cardinal were the three W's that went
into its record, as it swept three games from
the defending national champion Wildcats
at Sunken Diamond.
After falling behind 5-1. Stanford
stormed back to win 8-6 on Sunday. The
Cardinal took a 10-6 decision the previous
day after blowing the Wildcats out 14-4 on
Friday.
The sweep put Stanford into third place
in the Pacific 10 Southern Division at 4-2.
just a game behind conference-leading USC
(5-1) and a half-game in back of UCLA (6-3).
Arizona fell to 4-5 In the Six-Pac. The Card
inal is now 15-8 overall; the Wildcats are 14-
8.
Next to an Arizona win. the rarest things
this weekend were a routine groundball and
an earned run. Of the 48 runs scored in the
three games. 27 were unearned — the
result of 19 errors.
As one might expect, the sweepees were
more generous than the sweepers. Arizona
committed 11 errors, leading to 16 un
earned runs. "We've got to repair the
fences." Arizona Coach Jerry Kindall said.
"We're making too many errors, too many
physical mistakes at crucial times."
"It was an exciting series," Stanford
catcher Doug Robbins said. "There were a
lot of things you don't usually see — a lot of
sloppy defense and clutch hits."
Robbins provided a lot of hits, clutch and

otherwise, going 7-for-13 to raise his
average to .354, while scoring seven runs
and knocking in four more. Other offensive
stars for Stanford were freshman right
fielder Paul Carey, who went 6-for-10 with
four RBls, and seniors Ruben Amaro and
Toi Cook, who scored six runs apiece.
Three errors and a maddening series of
cheap hits staked Arizona to a 5-1 lead in
the third on Sunday, but Robbins then
stopped the Wildcats in their tracks —
literally.
With runners at the corners and one out,
Alan Zinter broke for home on Glenn Bax
ley's chopper to Ed Sprague at third.
Sprague's throw to Robbins at the plate
arrived well ahead of the runner, and when
Zinter declined to slow down or slide, Rob
bins sent him sprawling toward first base
with a two-handed tag.
"The runner was coming in standing up,"
Robbins said. "I've been in that place before
when I've gotten crunched, and it's not too
pleasant. He kind of let up at the last min
ute, and 1 became the aggressor."
"Doug has played real well for us,
(Sunday) especially." Stanford Coach Mark
Marquess said. "He got us going offensively,
and he got us pumped up with that play at
home plate. It couldn't have come at a better
time for us."
Stanford evened the score at five in the
bottom of the inning, scoring four un
earned runs with the help of two Arizona er
rors. Robbins contributed an RBI single to
the rally.
The game remained tied until the bottom
