was certain to give the Stanford
women's tennis team a tough
match this weekend, while Trinity
figured to be a less difficult op

The Longhorn and Tiger teams
that showed up at the Stanford
Tennis Stadium, however, defied
the expectations of the Cardinal.

raise its record to 9-2.

Trinity's Jane Holdren 7-5. 6-3 in
