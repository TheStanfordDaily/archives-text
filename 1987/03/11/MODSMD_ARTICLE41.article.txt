# Women's netters sneak by Trinity
## 
### KEN STEVENS Editorial staff 
Judging by their records. Texas
was certain to give the Stanford
women's tennis team a tough
match this weekend, while Trinity
figured to be a less difficult op
ponent.
The Longhorn and Tiger teams
that showed up at the Stanford
Tennis Stadium, however, defied
the expectations of the Cardinal.
Nevertheless. Stanford recorded a
pair of confidence-building vic
tories. defeating Texas 8-1 Satur
day and Trinity 5-4 Sunday to
raise its record to 9-2.
Trinity was ranked fourth in the
NCAA preseason poll, but the
Tigers crawled Into California
with a 5-4 record. Saturday,
though, they knocked off the pre
viously undefeated California
Bears 5-4 at Berkeley, and Sunday
they almost upset the Cardinal.
After freshman Valerie Wilson
had put Stanford up 1-0 with a 6-
4, 6-1 victory over Katrina Craw
ford in the No. 6 singles. Trinity
recorded two three-set wins to
take a 2-1 lead.
Tiger junior Ann Hulbert rallied
to upend Stephanie Savldes 5-7.

6-4. 6-3 in the No. 2 singles, and
senior Jana Klcpac knocked off
the Cardinal's Carl Hagey 6-4. 2-6.
7-5 In the No. 4 match. Hagey had
come back from a 5-2 deficit in the
third set to even the score, but
Klcpac responded by taking the
next two games.
Stanford started quickly in the
second half of the singles. Junior
Kay Tittle, still not 100 percent
healthy after a bout with the flu,
showed no signs of her illness
Sunday as she swept Dabney Lan
ghorne 6-2. 7-5 in the No. 5
singles match. Tittle trailed 5-3 in
the second set before winning the
next four games.
On court one. Patty Fendick
won for the 20th time in as many
matches this season, defeating
Trinity's Jane Holdren 7-5. 6-3 in
the No. 1 singles. The Cardinal
received a scare in the second set
when Fendick came up hobbling
after a point. She twisted a muscle
in her upper right leg. but after
having it wrapped by team trainer
Dakc Walden. the defending NC AA
champion was able to complete
the match.
With Stanford leading 3-2 in the
match, freshman Lisa Green at
tempted to give the Cardinal a
comfortable lead heading into
doubles, while keeping her perfect
singles record intact. But the
steady baseline play of Trinity's El
vyn Barrable was too much for
Green, and Barrable walked off
the court with a 6-4, 7-5 victory in
the No. 3 singles.
"It (the loss) takes some of the
pressure off Lisa," Stanford Coach
Frank Brennan said after the
match. "She was undefeated. She
could have been a little more ag
gressive, which is unusual for
Lisa. Against that girl, you've got
to come in (to the net)."
The doubles play was almost as
close as the singles had been ear
lier. In the No. 2 match, Barrable
and Klepac took the first set
against Hagey and Wilson by a 6-2
score. Seconds later. Tittle and
Green scored a 6-4 victory in the
first set of the No. 3 match against
Mary Graber and Kilmeny Water
man.
The critical action was taking
place on court one, where Fendick
and Savides were in trouble in
their match with Holdren and
Hulbert. Trailing 5-4, Fendick
went down 3-0 on her serve, but
the Cardinal tandem amazingly
saved four set points to even the
score at 5-5. They then won the
next two games to take the set.
Trinity went up 4-3 in the team
score as Barrable and Klepac
finished off Hagey and Wilson 6-2,
6-1. But the Cardinal knotted the

match as Fendick and Savides
breezed past Holdren and Hulbert
6-0 in the second set.
"They perservered that first
set," Brennan said of his No. 1
doubles team. "And then boom,
boom, boom. I kept looking over
my shoulder and it was 1-0, 3-0, 5-
0."
Tittle and Green closed out the
match moments later with a 6-4,
6-4 win on court three.
Saturday's match was gratifying
for the Cardinal as it not only got
back on the winning track after
losing to Cal Wednesday, but It
also discovered that there is at
least one other team in the
country that Is as banged up as it
self.
Texas' top two players missed
the match — Beverly Bowes with a
torn forearm muscle and Anne
Grousbeck with a sprained left
wrist — and two other Longhorns
played with injuries. Texas was
only able to field five athletes.
Thus, the Longhorns were forced
to forfeit one singles and one
doubles match.
Texas freshman Diana Merrett
was playing in the No. 4 match
with a shoulder injury that forced
her to serve underhand. She took
Hagey to three sets before losing 2-
6, 6-4, 6-2.
Later in the day.the Longhorns
had to default in the first set of the
No. 2 doubles match when Kim
Monnin came up with a back in
jury.
In the six matches that were
played, Stanford won five
relatively easily, and Savides lost a
close 7-6 (7-5), 7-5 match in the
No. 2 singles to freshman Lanae
Renschler.
