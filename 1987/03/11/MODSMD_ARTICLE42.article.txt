# Cardinal swimmers seek revenge against No. 1 Texas at nationals
## 
### BRENDAN HEALEY Senior staff writer 
The stage has been set for a
towering clash between Texas
and Stanford at the NCAA
women's swim meet.
Not only are the teams
ranked No. 1 and No. 2 in the
country, respectively, but each
school also boasts a tower as its
campus landmark. At Stan
ford, of course. Hoover dom
inates the campus skyline,
while Longhorn fans look
toward the Main Building
Tower, also known as the Vic
tory Tower.
And just as many at Stanford
would like to rid the Farm of
Hoover, so too will the Cardinal
look to snuff out the Victory
Tower.
The Victory Tower is lighted
in the form of a number one
when a Texas team wins a na
tional or Southwest Conference
championship, and the Long
horn women have hit the
switch after the last three
NCAA meets.
This year, though, there may
be some dark nights in Austin.

Stanford Coach George Haines
has assembled his strongest
team in the last few years and
will take a full contingent of 17
swimmers to Indianapolis for
the meet that runs March 19 to
21.
"I think it's going to be a
really good meet." Stanford's
Aimee Berzins said. "We have a
lot more depth than last year
and will be able to stand up to
them. It's just going to come
down to who's going to be able
to stand up and race."
Nonetheless, a Stanford win
over the Longhorns would be
considered an upset. When the
two squads met in early
February, the Longhorns made
Texas toast out of the Cardinal,
winning 92-48. The
Longhorns' numbers speak for
themselves.
Texas has more Olympians
(seven) than many small
countries and more individual
NCAA champions (six) than
most college conferences. Texas

Michelle Griglione is the favorite in the 400 IM and will chal
lenge in the 200 IM and 200 butterfly at the NCAA champion
ships in Indianapolis next week.
22 of his swimmers qualify for the
NCAAs, five more than the maxi
mum, 16 of whom have hit their
cuts in the individual limit of
three events apiece.
The meet opens with the 200
medley relay, an event in which
Stanford set an American record
at last year's meet, and it will be

critical for the Cardinal to estab
lish itself early.
The second event is the 500
freestyle, and it should give a good
indication of how the distance
freestyles will turn out. The 500
and 1,650 freestyles boast two of
the strongest fields of the meet.
Pitted against this field will be
Stanford's distance trio of Dana
Anderson, Lisa Gillespie and
Stacy Shupe. Shupe's eighth place
rank in the 1,650 is the team's
best in either race, though.

In the backstroke, Haines has
mined a mother lode of talent,
while Quick basically relies on his
24-carat superstar, Betsy Mitch
ell, as well as Tori Trees and
Andrea Hayes.
While two victories for Mitchell
are virtually a given, she will not
go unchallenged. Stanford's Mi
chelle Donahue has the second
best time in the 200, the highest
individual ranking for any mem
ber of the Cardinal, and is at the
top of her form after taking both

backstrokes at the recent Pacific
10 Conference meet.
Donahue will be ably supported
by teammates Jenny Shannon,
Laurie McLean, Jennifer Pokluda
and Susannah Miller, all of whom
are capable of making the final
eight.
Susan Rapp of Stanford is per
haps the pre-eminent American
woman in the 200 breaststroke
and will also contend in the 100.
Jill Johnson. Susan Lenth and
Bethanne Lambert fill out a Card

inal breaststroke crew that's deep
and fast.
In the sprint freestyles, the
Cardinal will rely more on quality
than quantity. Jenna Johnson is
the defending champion in the 50
and 100 freestyles, and she will
again be favored-
Berzins may be the key to Card
inal hopes in the sprints. She won
the 100 and 200 freestyles at the
Pac-lOs and will form a powerful
one-two punch with Johnson.
One huge advantage Texas will

enjoy as it goes hunting for the
title has nothing to do with swim
ming. While the Stanford swim
mers will be either taking their
finals early or completing them on
the road, the Longhorns will be in
the midst of spring break.
"It's a factor," Haines said. "I'd
like to swim it (the NCAA meet)
some time when we're not in
finals. (Nonetheless), I think we're
going to do a good job. Everybody
on the team has to swim their
lifetime best."

Michelle Griglione is the favorite in the 400 IM and will chal
lenge in the 200 IM and 200 butterfly at the NCAA champion
ships in Indianapolis next week.
22 of his swimmers qualify for the
NCAAs, five more than the maxi
mum, 16 of whom have hit their
cuts in the individual limit of
three events apiece.
The meet opens with the 200
medley relay, an event in which
Stanford set an American record
at last year's meet, and it will be

critical for the Cardinal to estab
lish itself early.
The second event is the 500
freestyle, and it should give a good
indication of how the distance
freestyles will turn out. The 500
and 1,650 freestyles boast two of
the strongest fields of the meet.
Pitted against this field will be
Stanford's distance trio of Dana
Anderson, Lisa Gillespie and
Stacy Shupe. Shupe's eighth place
rank in the 1,650 is the team's
best in either race, though.

In the backstroke, Haines has
mined a mother lode of talent,
while Quick basically relies on his
24-carat superstar, Betsy Mitch
ell, as well as Tori Trees and
Andrea Hayes.
While two victories for Mitchell
are virtually a given, she will not
go unchallenged. Stanford's Mi
chelle Donahue has the second
best time in the 200, the highest
individual ranking for any mem
ber of the Cardinal, and is at the
top of her form after taking both

backstrokes at the recent Pacific
10 Conference meet.
Donahue will be ably supported
by teammates Jenny Shannon,
Laurie McLean, Jennifer Pokluda
and Susannah Miller, all of whom
are capable of making the final
eight.
Susan Rapp of Stanford is per
haps the pre-eminent American
woman in the 200 breaststroke
and will also contend in the 100.
Jill Johnson. Susan Lenth and
Bethanne Lambert fill out a Card

inal breaststroke crew that's deep
and fast.
In the sprint freestyles, the
Cardinal will rely more on quality
than quantity. Jenna Johnson is
the defending champion in the 50
and 100 freestyles, and she will
again be favored-
Berzins may be the key to Card
inal hopes in the sprints. She won
the 100 and 200 freestyles at the
Pac-lOs and will form a powerful
one-two punch with Johnson.
One huge advantage Texas will

enjoy as it goes hunting for the
title has nothing to do with swim
ming. While the Stanford swim
mers will be either taking their
finals early or completing them on
the road, the Longhorns will be in
the midst of spring break.
"It's a factor," Haines said. "I'd
like to swim it (the NCAA meet)
some time when we're not in
finals. (Nonetheless), I think we're
going to do a good job. Everybody
on the team has to swim their
lifetime best."
