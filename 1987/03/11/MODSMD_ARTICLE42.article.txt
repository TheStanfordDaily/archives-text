# Cardinal swimmers seek revenge against No. 1 Texas at nationals
## 
### BRENDAN HEALEY Senior staff writer 
The stage has been set for a
towering clash between Texas
and Stanford at the NCAA
women's swim meet.
Not only are the teams
ranked No. 1 and No. 2 in the
country, respectively, but each
school also boasts a tower as its
campus landmark. At Stan
ford, of course. Hoover dom
inates the campus skyline,
while Longhorn fans look
toward the Main Building
Tower, also known as the Vic
tory Tower.
And just as many at Stanford
would like to rid the Farm of
Hoover, so too will the Cardinal
look to snuff out the Victory
Tower.
The Victory Tower is lighted
in the form of a number one
when a Texas team wins a na
tional or Southwest Conference
championship, and the Long
horn women have hit the
switch after the last three
NCAA meets.
This year, though, there may
be some dark nights in Austin.

Stanford Coach George Haines
has assembled his strongest
team in the last few years and
will take a full contingent of 17
swimmers to Indianapolis for
the meet that runs March 19 to
21.
"I think it's going to be a
really good meet." Stanford's
Aimee Berzins said. "We have a
lot more depth than last year
and will be able to stand up to
them. It's just going to come
down to who's going to be able
to stand up and race."
Nonetheless, a Stanford win
over the Longhorns would be
considered an upset. When the
two squads met in early
February, the Longhorns made
Texas toast out of the Cardinal,
winning 92-48. The
Longhorns' numbers speak for
themselves.
Texas has more Olympians
(seven) than many small
countries and more individual
NCAA champions (six) than
most college conferences. Texas
