## 
### EVAN TUCHINSKY Staff writer 
Sunday afternoon at Maples
Pavilion, the 697 fans in atten
dance were half expecting to
see Steve Winwood step out
from behind the bleachers and
sing "Back in the High Life," as
the Stanford women's gymnas
tics team broke five school
records, including high team
score, en route to its 185.50 to
181.65 win over Washington
State.
Along with team score, the
Cardinal gymnasts broke event
records on floor exercise and
vault. The squad garnered a
46.95 on floor, bettering the
46.40 earned in 1984, and
bested the record set earlier
this year on vault by five one
hundredths, posting a 46.70.
Coinciding with the team ex
cellence was a career-best per
formance by freshman Dina
Amoroso, who broke the indi
vidual record on floor with an
impressive 9.7 and the all
around with a 37.60. Previ
ously this season. Amoroso
bested the vault record with a
9.65.
"I thought it was a great
meet," Amoroso said. "I'm
happy that I did well, but I'm

really happy that the team did
well. It really boosted our
spirits."
"What can you say, we beat
five records." Stanford Coach
Homer Sardina said. Sardina
and Stanford Asst. Coach Sam
Shaw "believed all along" that
the team would do well.
"It was well overdue, that's
what it was." Shaw said.
The Cougars also had a great
meet, finishing with a season
high score and a third-place
finish in the all-around by
Kathy Bovaird. However, the
initiative clearly belonged to
the Cardinal.
In a season plagued by disap
pointing showings, the 185.50
was a welcome and needed
score. Stanford is now assured
a berth in the West Regional,
the qualifying meet for the na
tionals.
"I think we finally got our act
together," senior Cindy Boyd
said. "It was a meet we
definitely needed for encour
agement and to give us confi
dence."
"I feel a lot more confident
now," Amoroso observed,
"because I know that if we hit
well, we can score well, as well
as any other team."
