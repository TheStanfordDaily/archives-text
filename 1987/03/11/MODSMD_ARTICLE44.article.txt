# Fencers place fourth
## Murk, Levitan, Cramer qualify for NCAAs 
### CHRIS CRADER Staff writer 
For a change, the expected hap
pened. That describes the results
the Stanford men's fencing team
produced at the Western
Regionals. held at Fullerton State
Saturday and Sunday.
Up to this point in the season,
the team's lack of experience has
led to wildly varying perfor
mances, but the team came in as
the fourth seed and came away
with fourth place, with Stanford
winning the sabre team title.
Co-captains Larry Murk and
Steve Levitan. both seniors, and
junior Mike Cramer also lived up
to their potential in qualifying for
NCAAs in epee, sabre and sabre,
respectively.
Knowing his team came in with
five of nine starters in their first
year of varsity competition, Stan
ford Coach Buzz Hurst wasn't dis
appointed with his team's first fall
out of the top three in seven years.
"You have certain goals . . . that
you hope you can reach," he said.
"The best I could hope for is three
qualifiers to the NCAA and the
sabre team trophy, and we got
that."
Stanford knew it would have a
tough time against the competi
tion. and that's the way it was. Air
Force won the regional with a
strong all-around performance,
followed by Cal State-Long Beach,

UC-Santa Cruz. Stanford. Fuller
ton State and UC-San Diego.
The format for the regionals was
purely team-based, but the NCAAs
consist of only Individual competi
tion. with the top three in epee
and foil and the top four In sabre
advancing. Murk's 14-3 record on
the weekend gave him the bronze
In epee. while Cramer and Levitan
were both 15-2 In sabre. Cramer
won the tie-breaking procedure
and took second, with Levitan
taking third.
Since the NCAA selection is
based on the fencer's record for
the whole season, the Cardinal
fencers' high placings were no
guarantee of a nationals berth,
but all have good records for the
year. Murk is now 57-12, Levitan
is 60-7, and Cramer is 53-14. The
records are even more impressive
when one considers the records
include a trip to the Midwest,
where Stanford faced many na
tional powers.
The three men will not be the
only Cardinal fencers competing
at the nationals. Immediately after
the men's NCAAs, from March 16
to 18, are the women's nationals.
Stanford qualified for the team
competition, and seniors Holly
Taylor and Alyson Yarns (Ist and
3rd respectively at the regionals)
will be fencing in the individual
NCAAs. March 19 to 21. Both na
tional championships will be held
at Notre Dame.
