# Golfers hack way to last place finish

"We were just so many shots
back after the first round, we
couldn't make up any places. It
was our worst and our best, but
the worst was just a lot worse,"
Cardinal sophomore John
Mahon said after this
weekend's Florida South
ern/Imperial Lakes Classic.
In Sunday's final round, the
Stanford men's golf team
posted Its best score of the
season, but it was so far back
after Friday's dismal opening
round, a last-place finish could
not be avoided.
"The wheels came off for
everybody on the team the first
day. Usually In college golf, at
least one or two guys will shoot
pretty well, but we all fell apart.
Nobody broke 80 in the first
round," Mahon said.
The Cardinal did have a bit of
a handicap the first day: the
weather. Rain Saturday can
celed the second round, and
the conditions Friday were ab

solutely abysmal. Stanford was
at a disadvantage relative to
nearly half the field, Mahon es
timated.
"There was a consistent 25
miles per hour breeze the first
day. gustlng to 45 miles per
hour, which, for golf, is ter
rible. We teed off in the last
group and got the brunt of the
storm. Georgia Southern,
which led after the first day,
teed off in the middle of the
day. That's not to make an
excuse for shooting 326. That
is not a score becoming of any
Division I school. It was just
our worst round of the year,"
Mahon said.
The 326 — a whopping 38
over par — was followed by
Sunday's 10-over 298, the
Cardinal's best round against
par all season. The 624 two-day
total, however, placed Stanford
22nd out of 22 teams. Wake
Forest won the tournament at
585, three strokes better than
Georgia Southern, Florida
State and Georgia Tech.
