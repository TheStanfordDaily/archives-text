# Card's season high too much for SJSU
## 
### MARK SMOYER Staff writer 
With each meet a do-or-die sit
uation, the Stanford men's gym
nastics team continues to do.
Having performed well in the
first two of five crucial competi
tions, the Cardinal must maintain
Its excellence to make the NCAA
championships. Two tough away
meets and the Stanford-hosted
Pacific 10 Conference champion
ships lie ahead.
Last Friday night, Stanford
found itself in a meet at San Jose
State. Although the Spartans did
compete, the Cardinal knew that
it didn't have to be concerned with
SJSU well before the contest was
under way. The difficulty would be
in maintaining an intensity level
high enough to produce the neces
sary scores.
Stanford overcame this diffi
culty and cruised through the
events, letting down only on the
last apparatus, the high bar. The
team recorded a season-high
278.75, including scores of 47.15
on the pommel horse and 46.45
on the rings, both 1987 bests. The
individual highlight was Chuck

Gerardo's 9.9 on the horse, the
first such score of his career.
After scoring almost a point un
der their best in the parallel bars,
the Cardinal gymnasts disap
pointed themselves further with a
45.45 on the high bar. After the
meet, they attributed the score to
both mental and physical errors,
but said the fact that the team
could have scored over 280 left
hope for the future.
The future holds tougher Judges
and, in meets at Santa Barbara
and Berkeley, less friendly gym
nasiums. The San Jose meet in
cluded a junior high school band
(given four-star ratings by most of
the Cardinal gymnasts) as pre
meet entertainment.
As always, Gerardo and Mike
Matzek led the way Individually. It
was the sophomores who really
shined, however, Friday night.
Andy Ropp recorded a 55.3 six
event score, almost a point better
than his previous career best.
Scott Schaffer, unable to go all
around due to injury, averaged
over 9.35 in his four events, which
adds up to better than 56 points
all-around.
