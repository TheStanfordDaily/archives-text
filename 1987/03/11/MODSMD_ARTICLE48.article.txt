### JON WEISMAN Staff writer 
Now that the Stanford men's tennis
team is off for the rest of winter quar
ter, the players must be hoping they do
as well on their final exams as they did
in their final match of the quarter
Friday.
The Cardinal romped over San Jose
State, 8-1, for the second time this
season, squaring its record at 5-5. The
match was the team's final tuneup
before opening the spring season
aganist Oregon March 24.
Playing at No. 6 singles, sophomore
Curtis Dunn put the Cardinal on the
scoreboard first with an easy 6-1, 6-1
win over Mike Scadden.
"I played this guy before," said
Dunn, now 7-1 and undefeated in dual
matches. "He's an OK player, but I was
pretty confident."
Scott Moody, the senior from
Larchmont, N.Y., continues to play

evened his 1987 singles record at 7-7
by disposing of Spartan Tom Sheehan
6-3, 6-0.

"Today I was able to sustain concen

Soon after, Stanford's Mark Jacob
son hit a volley past Risto Moilanen to
score a 6-3, 6-2 win and give the Card
inal a 3-0 lead in the match.
"My arm's feeling 100 percent now,"
Jacobson said. "But my serve's not
back to normal. I still have to improve
my serve a little bit.
"I'm feeling really comfortable
playing," he added. "I've just got to play
a lot of matches to feel like I'm playing
totally back to normal again. But, I'm
playing fairly good â€” no complaints."
Jeff Cathrall, who defeated Hayward
State's Manoj Kashyap March 3 with
mostly a baseline game, went to more
of a serve-and-volley game to knock off
SJSU's Paul Carbone 6-4, 6-1. The
Lakewood, Co. freshman now has a 9-4
singles record this season, virtually all
at the No. 3 slot.
"I thought Jeff Cathrall did a nice job
in his match of using his serve-and
volley and his first serve also," Stan
ford Coach Dick Gould said. "He played
