# Cagers end by beating OSU
## 
### CHRIS CRADER Staff writer 
Life is not often compared to the eating
habits of small children, but sometimes
that comparison can be Informative. If
you have ever watched a kid eat an Oreo
cookie, you know she always eats the
middle part first, then goes after the
cookie. The Stanford women's basketball
team showed the same logic in its victory
over Oregon State, saving its best for the
last game of the season.
The 58-56 win gave Stanford its first
.500 season in four years, at 14-14. Stan
ford finished 8-10 in the Pacific 10 Con
ference, tied for sixth with the Beavers.
"We saved the best for last," Stanford
Coach Tara VanDerveer said. "The game
had a real good feeling to it."
The game marked the end of four
seniors' careers, with Erica Mueser,
Karen Goedewaagen, Kim Mercer and Sue
Sebolt all starting their last game after a
presentation recognizing their contribu
tions.
"I thought it was a good way to end the
season," said sophomore center Jill
Yanke. "It was really special for them (the
seniors)."
The game began in a very sloppy man
ner, with five turnovers before the first
shot was taken. OSU then jumped quickly
out to an 18-9 lead behind eight points
from Debbie Dalluge and six from Chelle
Flamoe. Right before intermission,

however, Stanford went on a 12-4 run to
make it 26-26 at the half.
The second half started with a basket
by freshman Pam Simms and a three
point play by junior Kami Anderson to
give Stanford a five-point cushion. "I
thought Pam had a really good game."
VanDerveer said. "She made a key basket
for us and played good defense."
Oregon State scored four to tighten the
game, and for most of the second half the
spread was within two points. With 4:04
left, however, Mueser hit a 15-footer to
put the Cardinal ahead for good.
Yanke scored on two buckets and a free
throw, and Mueser, Mercer and Jennifer
Azzi all added free throws to keep the
Stanford lead near four.
The Beavers made one last two-pointer
at the buzzer, but It wasn't enough. "I was
really impressed with the way they
(Stanford) played." VanDerveer said. "We
were down, we came back. It was a deter
mined effort for 40 minutes."
Monica Raspberry scored 12 second
half points to keep the Beavers In the
game, and finished with a game-high 18.
Yanke led Stanford with 14 (10 in the last
11 minutes of the game) on 55 percent
shooting, while Azzi and Anderson added
10 and nine, respectively. Anderson
finished the year with 374 points and a
13.4 average to lead the Cardinal, and the
junior now has 1013 career points, tied
for sixth all-time at Stanford.
Freshman Katy Steding had a game

high 10 rebounds, giving her 243 for the
year. Her 8.7 average Is the third best ever
on the Farm. Also in the record books is
Azzi's Cardinal season-record total of 165
assists, which also puts her sixth on the
all-time list.
There were many differences between
Saturday's game and Stanford's 70-53
loss at Corvallis five weeks ago. "They're
very quick." said VanDerveer. "They really
put a lot of pressure on people." On Satur
day. the Cardinal was "working to do the
things that needed to be done." she said.
Yanke added: "We were ready for it (the
pressure) this time. We were at home with
our crowd and a band, and that really
helped."
Yanke started most of the season, but
has been coming off the bench lately, as
Goedewaagen has started six of the last
seven games. In those games, though.
Goedewaagen has averaged 3.7 points,
double her seasonal average, and Yanke
has produced 15.7 points and 5.5
rebounds per game, both well above her
average.
"If I came off the bench, I think I was
more motivated to play well," she said. "I
think it did help."
Another advantage for Yanke and the
rest of the Cardinal was the Beavers lack
of height. On Thursday, the 6-foot-5
Yanke went against 6-7 Stephanie
Kasperski of Oregon, but Saturday night
she faced an OSU team with no one taller
than 6-1.

Goedewaagen has started six of the last
seven games. In those games, though.
Goedewaagen has averaged 3.7 points,

has produced 15.7 points and 5.5

average.
"If I came off the bench, I think I was
more motivated to play well," she said. "I

Another advantage for Yanke and the
rest of the Cardinal was the Beavers lack
of height. On Thursday, the 6-foot-5
Yanke went against 6-7 Stephanie
Kasperski of Oregon, but Saturday night
she faced an OSU team with no one taller
than 6-1.
