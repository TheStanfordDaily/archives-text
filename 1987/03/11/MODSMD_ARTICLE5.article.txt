# Ruling imminent in NCAA suit
## 
### JAY FRY Staff writer 
A Superior Court judge in San Jose is ex
pected to decide today or tomorrow whether
Stanford diver Simone LeVant must take a
urine test before next week's NCAA Diving
Championships.
Following a 9 a.m. preliminary hearing, the
judge will determine whether to issue a prelim
inary injunction barring the National Col
legiate Athletics Association from requiring a
urinalysis of LeVant.
Both LeVant and her attorney said they ex
pect the judge's decision "fairly quickly" —
possibly even later today or tomorrow.
In October, LeVant, captain of the Stanford
women's diving team, refused to sign a waiver
form agreeing to submit to a urine test re

quired by the NCAA. The NCAA ruled her in
eligible to dive, but in January, a Santa Clara
Superior Court judge issued a temporary
restraining order allowing LeVant to compete
until today's preliminary hearing.
Since then LeVant has been diving in com
petition, with an eye on the NCAA Champion
ships that begin a week from tomorrow in In
dianapolis.
If, after hearing the two hours of argument
by counsel, the judge rules in favor of the
NCAA, LeVant would have to take the drug test
in order to compete.
"She'd have to decide if she would want to go
to the national championships" and submit to
the drug test anyway, said Susan Harriman.
LeVant's attorney.
The injunction would be a stopgap measure
that will be in effect until the case goes to trial.

Harriman expects a trial before next fall, but
said everything depends on the outcome of
today's hearing.
"Sometimes parties agree that the prelimi
nary injunction will be the final injunction,"
said Harriman. She said further action, in
cluding a possible trial, will have to wait until
after the decision, when "we (the attorneys for
both sides) start talking to each other."
Even if LeVant wins the temporary injunc
tion and is exempted from the drug test, Har
riman said that it is hard to say what will hap
pen to the NCAA's drug testing program.
"Simone is the only person in front of him (the
judge). His ruling only applies to her. The ef
• fects beyond Simone are unsure," she said.
Harriman said that whether the case can be
extended to other athletes in other
states will depend on whether the
judge uses "broad language" in
his ruling, as well as the NCAA's
interpretation of the decision.
"Even the NCAA is asking. 'What
happens if we (LeVant and Har
rirnan) win?' " Harriman said.
Doug Johnson, director of
legislative services in the NCAA's
central office in Mission, Kan.,
declined to speculate on the athle
tic association's possible courses
of act ion given the variety of possi

ble outcomes of today's hearing.
"It's impossible to speculate
with such a wide spectrum
available, with so many avenues
open," Johnson said. The NCAA
will "determine from the exact lan
guage of the ruling what course of
action to take."
LeVant's case calls the NCAA's
drug testing program "unwar
ranted and unconstitutional," ar
guing that the urine tests violate
an athlete's right to privacy and
that students participating in in
tercollegiate athletics do not have
to give up these rights. The case
also contends that the drug test
ing program was implemented
without consideration of less in

trusive available alternatives.
"1 felt it was an invasion of my
privacy," said LeVant.
Also, the urine tests cannot dis
tinguish between therapeutic and
performance-enhancing drugs,
according to a memorandum for
LeVant's case on file at the Santa
Clara Superior Court.
Stanford is "sympathetic with
her (LeVant's) case," said Stanford
Athletic Director Andy Geiger.
Geiger said the NCAA is deter
mined to defend its drug testing
program, which Stanford has al
ways opposed. The University
voted against the program when it
was proposed, but has complied
with its guidelines since it has

been in effect, Geiger said.
The University opposes the pro
gram, according to Geiger, be
cause of the lack of full confiden
tiality, the singling out of athletes
from the student body and the
lack of concentration on drug edu
cation.
"There was no basic drug educa
tion program prior to the testing.
We believe it's up to the individual
institutions, instead of it being
cops and robbers," Geiger said.
LcVant said the University has
been very supportive of her efforts.
Under the current program, the
NCAA may disqualify athletes who
test positive for any of these non
performance-enhancing drugs. In

the case, LeVant argues that there
is no evidence that any of these
over-the-counter medications en
hance performance or pose health
risks to athletes in the first place
— especially in the sport of diving.
NCAA officials deem the drug
testing program necessary to stop
the spread of drug use in college
athletics and to crack down on
athletes using drugs to improve
their performance.
An NCAA memorandum pre
pared for LeVant's case quotes
NCAA President Walter Byers as
saying he believes "the drug test
ing program sends a clear and im
portant message all the way down
the line."

inary injunction barring the National Col
legiate Athletics Association from requiring a
urinalysis of LeVant.
Both LeVant and her attorney said they ex
pect the judge's decision "fairly quickly" —
possibly even later today or tomorrow.
In October, LeVant, captain of the Stanford
women's diving team, refused to sign a waiver
form agreeing to submit to a urine test re

quired by the NCAA. The NCAA ruled her in
eligible to dive, but in January, a Santa Clara
Superior Court judge issued a temporary
restraining order allowing LeVant to compete
until today's preliminary hearing.
Since then LeVant has been diving in com
petition, with an eye on the NCAA Champion
ships that begin a week from tomorrow in In
dianapolis.
If, after hearing the two hours of argument
by counsel, the judge rules in favor of the
NCAA, LeVant would have to take the drug test
in order to compete.
"She'd have to decide if she would want to go
to the national championships" and submit to
the drug test anyway, said Susan Harriman.
LeVant's attorney.
The injunction would be a stopgap measure
that will be in effect until the case goes to trial.

Harriman expects a trial before next fall, but
said everything depends on the outcome of
today's hearing.
"Sometimes parties agree that the prelimi
nary injunction will be the final injunction,"
said Harriman. She said further action, in
cluding a possible trial, will have to wait until
after the decision, when "we (the attorneys for
both sides) start talking to each other."
Even if LeVant wins the temporary injunc
tion and is exempted from the drug test, Har
riman said that it is hard to say what will hap
pen to the NCAA's drug testing program.
"Simone is the only person in front of him (the
judge). His ruling only applies to her. The ef
• fects beyond Simone are unsure," she said.
Harriman said that whether the case can be
extended to other athletes in other
states will depend on whether the
judge uses "broad language" in
his ruling, as well as the NCAA's
interpretation of the decision.
"Even the NCAA is asking. 'What
happens if we (LeVant and Har
rirnan) win?' " Harriman said.
Doug Johnson, director of
legislative services in the NCAA's
central office in Mission, Kan.,
declined to speculate on the athle
tic association's possible courses
of act ion given the variety of possi

ble outcomes of today's hearing.
"It's impossible to speculate
with such a wide spectrum
available, with so many avenues
open," Johnson said. The NCAA
will "determine from the exact lan
guage of the ruling what course of
action to take."
LeVant's case calls the NCAA's
drug testing program "unwar
ranted and unconstitutional," ar
guing that the urine tests violate
an athlete's right to privacy and
that students participating in in
tercollegiate athletics do not have
to give up these rights. The case
also contends that the drug test
ing program was implemented
without consideration of less in

trusive available alternatives.
"1 felt it was an invasion of my
privacy," said LeVant.
Also, the urine tests cannot dis
tinguish between therapeutic and
performance-enhancing drugs,
according to a memorandum for
LeVant's case on file at the Santa
Clara Superior Court.
Stanford is "sympathetic with
her (LeVant's) case," said Stanford
Athletic Director Andy Geiger.
Geiger said the NCAA is deter
mined to defend its drug testing
program, which Stanford has al
ways opposed. The University
voted against the program when it
was proposed, but has complied
with its guidelines since it has

been in effect, Geiger said.
The University opposes the pro
gram, according to Geiger, be
cause of the lack of full confiden
tiality, the singling out of athletes
from the student body and the
lack of concentration on drug edu
cation.
"There was no basic drug educa
tion program prior to the testing.
We believe it's up to the individual
institutions, instead of it being
cops and robbers," Geiger said.
LcVant said the University has
been very supportive of her efforts.
Under the current program, the
NCAA may disqualify athletes who
test positive for any of these non
performance-enhancing drugs. In

the case, LeVant argues that there
is no evidence that any of these
over-the-counter medications en
hance performance or pose health
risks to athletes in the first place
— especially in the sport of diving.
NCAA officials deem the drug
testing program necessary to stop
the spread of drug use in college
athletics and to crack down on
athletes using drugs to improve
their performance.
An NCAA memorandum pre
pared for LeVant's case quotes
NCAA President Walter Byers as
saying he believes "the drug test
ing program sends a clear and im
portant message all the way down
the line."
