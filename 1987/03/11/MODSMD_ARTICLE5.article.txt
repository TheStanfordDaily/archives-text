# Ruling imminent in NCAA suit
## 
### JAY FRY Staff writer 
A Superior Court judge in San Jose is ex
pected to decide today or tomorrow whether
Stanford diver Simone LeVant must take a
urine test before next week's NCAA Diving
Championships.
Following a 9 a.m. preliminary hearing, the
judge will determine whether to issue a prelim
inary injunction barring the National Col
legiate Athletics Association from requiring a
urinalysis of LeVant.
Both LeVant and her attorney said they ex
pect the judge's decision "fairly quickly" —
possibly even later today or tomorrow.
In October, LeVant, captain of the Stanford
women's diving team, refused to sign a waiver
form agreeing to submit to a urine test re

quired by the NCAA. The NCAA ruled her in
eligible to dive, but in January, a Santa Clara
Superior Court judge issued a temporary
restraining order allowing LeVant to compete
until today's preliminary hearing.
Since then LeVant has been diving in com
petition, with an eye on the NCAA Champion
ships that begin a week from tomorrow in In
dianapolis.
If, after hearing the two hours of argument
by counsel, the judge rules in favor of the
NCAA, LeVant would have to take the drug test
in order to compete.
"She'd have to decide if she would want to go
to the national championships" and submit to
the drug test anyway, said Susan Harriman.
LeVant's attorney.
The injunction would be a stopgap measure
that will be in effect until the case goes to trial.

Harriman expects a trial before next fall, but
said everything depends on the outcome of
today's hearing.
"Sometimes parties agree that the prelimi
nary injunction will be the final injunction,"
said Harriman. She said further action, in
cluding a possible trial, will have to wait until
after the decision, when "we (the attorneys for
both sides) start talking to each other."
Even if LeVant wins the temporary injunc
tion and is exempted from the drug test, Har
riman said that it is hard to say what will hap
pen to the NCAA's drug testing program.
"Simone is the only person in front of him (the
judge). His ruling only applies to her. The ef

Harriman said that whether the case can be
