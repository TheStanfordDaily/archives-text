### ALICIA KENT Staff writer 
"Don't hit harder, hit smarter" Is grad
ually becoming the motto for the Stanford
men's volleyball team. The Cardinal proved
the validity of this strategy Friday night at
Maples Pavilion when it hunted down the
Loyola-Marymount Lions, 15-10, 15-7, 15-
8.
However, on Saturday night, again at
Maples, Stanford seemed to forget this
motto, allowing the Pepperdine Waves to
wash over them, 15-12, 15-11, 15-7.
Halfway through the season and having
faced all Western Intercollegiate Volleyball
Association teams except Cal State-
Northridge, the Cardinal has established a
4-5 record. Loyola-Marymount, with its 0-8
WIVA record, was an expected win for Stan
ford, whereas third-ranked Pepperdine, the

two-time defending national champion,
was expected to be a much more difficult
challenge.
Friday's match provided a needed win for
the Cardinal, which is battling with Long
Beach State for fifth place in the WIVA and a
ticket to the NCAAs May 1 to 2. "Right now
we're in the middle of the pack in the league
race," Stanford Asst. Coach Ruben Nieves
said after Friday's win. "A win like this is a
step in that direction, toward the NCAAs."
Knowing that It needed a victory against
the Lions. Stanford jumped right into the
match and never looked back. In the begin
ning of the first game, Stanford immedi
ately built a 6-1 lead with kills by freshmen
Dan Hanan and Kent Steffes, who led the
match with 15 and 16 kills, respectively.
Each had an outstanding hitting
percentage of .444.
Defensively, both outside hitters provided

a powerful force; Steffes' 12 digs led the
match and Hanan posted two solo blocks,
again the match high.
Hanan went on in the first game to serve
the winning point and in the third game to
block for match point, while Steffes hit to
win the second game for the Cardinal. "If
Dan and Kent keep that up, we're going to
be tough to beat," Nieves said.
The difference in Friday's match for Stan
ford was its ability to play a well-rounded
volleyball match. Senior Stephen Blue pro
vided consistency in the defense with 11
digs, four block assists and one solo block.
Leading both teams with five block assists
was junior middle blocker Scott Fortune,
who also leads the Cardinal with 38 block
assists and 11 solo blocks this season.
Much of the team's versatility came from
setter Steve Modory, who recorded 10 digs
and one kill. "Our versatility was pretty

good. Steve mixed up the sets a lot and kept
them guessing," Hanan said.
"We played pretty good, but [Stanford]
played really good," said Loyola-Marymount
Coach Rich Rosales, whose team averaged
only a .098 hitting percentage in compari
son to Stanford's .241. "I'd give all the
credit to Stanford for playing a good volley
ball match," he said.
The Cardinal entered the match against
Loyola-Marymount coming off its two best
practices of the season, and was able to
carry over this momentum into the match,
according to Nieves. "We played like we
practiced, in our desire to win, our inten
sity and our concentration," he said.
However. Saturday's match was a night of
frustration and broken concentration for
Stanford. "1 was disappointed because 1
