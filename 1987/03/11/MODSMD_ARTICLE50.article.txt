# Spikers split pair with Waves, LMU

### ALICIA KENT Staff writer 
"Don't hit harder, hit smarter" Is grad
ually becoming the motto for the Stanford
men's volleyball team. The Cardinal proved
the validity of this strategy Friday night at
Maples Pavilion when it hunted down the
Loyola-Marymount Lions, 15-10, 15-7, 15-
8.
However, on Saturday night, again at
Maples, Stanford seemed to forget this
motto, allowing the Pepperdine Waves to
wash over them, 15-12, 15-11, 15-7.
Halfway through the season and having
faced all Western Intercollegiate Volleyball
Association teams except Cal State-
Northridge, the Cardinal has established a
4-5 record. Loyola-Marymount, with its 0-8
WIVA record, was an expected win for Stan
ford, whereas third-ranked Pepperdine, the

two-time defending national champion,
was expected to be a much more difficult
challenge.
Friday's match provided a needed win for
the Cardinal, which is battling with Long
Beach State for fifth place in the WIVA and a
ticket to the NCAAs May 1 to 2. "Right now
we're in the middle of the pack in the league
race," Stanford Asst. Coach Ruben Nieves
said after Friday's win. "A win like this is a
step in that direction, toward the NCAAs."
Knowing that It needed a victory against
the Lions. Stanford jumped right into the
match and never looked back. In the begin
ning of the first game, Stanford immedi
ately built a 6-1 lead with kills by freshmen
Dan Hanan and Kent Steffes, who led the
match with 15 and 16 kills, respectively.
Each had an outstanding hitting
percentage of .444.
Defensively, both outside hitters provided

a powerful force; Steffes' 12 digs led the
match and Hanan posted two solo blocks,
again the match high.
Hanan went on in the first game to serve
the winning point and in the third game to
block for match point, while Steffes hit to
win the second game for the Cardinal. "If
Dan and Kent keep that up, we're going to
be tough to beat," Nieves said.
The difference in Friday's match for Stan
ford was its ability to play a well-rounded
volleyball match. Senior Stephen Blue pro
vided consistency in the defense with 11
digs, four block assists and one solo block.
Leading both teams with five block assists
was junior middle blocker Scott Fortune,
who also leads the Cardinal with 38 block
assists and 11 solo blocks this season.
Much of the team's versatility came from
setter Steve Modory, who recorded 10 digs
and one kill. "Our versatility was pretty

good. Steve mixed up the sets a lot and kept
them guessing," Hanan said.
"We played pretty good, but [Stanford]
played really good," said Loyola-Marymount
Coach Rich Rosales, whose team averaged
only a .098 hitting percentage in compari
son to Stanford's .241. "I'd give all the
credit to Stanford for playing a good volley
ball match," he said.
The Cardinal entered the match against
Loyola-Marymount coming off its two best
practices of the season, and was able to
carry over this momentum into the match,
according to Nieves. "We played like we
practiced, in our desire to win, our inten
sity and our concentration," he said.
However. Saturday's match was a night of
frustration and broken concentration for
Stanford. "1 was disappointed because 1
thought we could have won," said
Fortune, who proved to be the
power hitter of the match, leading
both teams with 19 kills to post an
unusually high .407 hitting
percentage. "We were there the
whole time, but we just didn't
have enough to put it away."
In both the first and second
games, Stanford fought hard,
siding out and tielng Pepperdine
on the scoreboard until the final

points of each game. In the first
game, the teams were tied at one,
two and four. After Stanford
jumped ahead 9-5, Pepperdine
caught up at 9-9, and the teams
were tied again at 10 and 12.
The final two points went to the
Waves on two controversial calls,
which began the Cardinal's streak
of frustration. The second game
continued In much the same man
ner. with the scoreboard at 1-1, 2-
2, 7-7 and 9-9. The Cardinal then
began making hitting errors,
which led to Its 15-11 loss.
"We got a little bit frustrated
and it showed In our plays,"
Nieves said. "What generated the

frustration were two things: Pep
perdine's good steady play and our
errors that we made on our own."
Stanford made 31 hitting errors
over the course of the match, in
contrast to the Waves' 18.
The third game evidenced this
frustration when, at 6-6, the
Cardinal fell apart and fell behind
13-7. "Stanford just wasn't doing
it out there," said Pepperdine's
senior outside hitter Troy Tanner,
who was an All-Amerlcan in 1986
and played for the U.S. National
team last summer. "If you're not
up, you're going to lose."
Averaging a .244 hitting
percentage in the first game and a

.214 in the second, the Cardinal
seemed to be hitting, blocking and
serving well, but, as Modory
noticed, Stanford couldn't seem to
overcome the blocking and hitting
of Tanner and fellow 1986 All-
Americas Matt Rigg and Rob
Scott.
The spikers now have a two
week break from volleyball with
Dead Week and finals to face. "It
will be a welcome break," said
Jason McFarland, who hopes to
play In the next half of the season
after being out due to a stress
fracture in his shin. "We need to
catch some second-half fire."
