If this weekend's track meet, the
first this year at home, comes off
as the Stanford coaching staff is
hoping, track fans may find the
confines of Stanford Stadium as
appealing as Sunken Diamond on
a sunny day.
Spearheaded by new assistant
coach Scott Chisam, the track
staff has been working to increase
community and alumni Interest
in the team through a series of
new promotions, many of which
will be unveiled Saturday. Chief
among the innovations will be a
newly formed booster club featur
ing special stadium seats, a new
message board to display results
and contests to spark fan partici
pation In the meet.
"We'd just like to give people a
chance to be part of it all," Chisam
said. "We'd like to make this thing
as enjoyable as possible."
Part of the enjoyment should
also come from the meet itself.
Saturday, the Cardinal will race
against Cal State-Bakersfield and

San Francisco State, two teams it
probably should beat. Field events
will begin at 11 a.m., followed by
the first races at 1:30 p.m.
Junior team captain Marc
Olesen is viewing the meet as
primarily a chance for the team to
compete together and assess
where it's at. "We've got more
people and they're looking better.
This meet is pretty low-key, but
it'll be good to see where we are,"
Olesen said.
Each team's entries for the meet
were not yet available yesterday.
Past experience, however, indi
cates that the men's sprint relay
could be a key event to watch, as
an improving Cardinal relay will
open Saturday's running events
against a Bakersfield team that Is
historically tough in the sprints.
To help promote that matchup,
Chisam is making this week's
contest guessing the time of Stan
ford's relay.
On Feb. 28 at the San Jose
Relays, the relay ran 42.1, but was
hampered by poor hand-offs. Also
missing in San Jose was the third
leg of the relay, sophomore Chris
Barlow, who will return this week.
