## Jackson Browne: Rock's new political conscience 
### KAI KEASEY 
Let me tell you right off that I'm really
not acquainted with Jackson Browne's
music. Sure, I know his popular songs
like "Lawyers in Love," "Running on
Empty" and the more recent "America,"
but I had never really heard the meat of
his repertoire, so to speak. Therefore,
Browne amazed me with his diversity and
ability throughout his Sunday night
show at the San Jose Center for the Per
forming Arts, making the concert enjoy
able and worthwhile. The two and one
half hour show consisted of two parts. In
the first part, Browne played alone on
guitar and synthesizer on older, slower
songs like "Rosy" and "Linda Paloma"
(which sounded better without the
closing Mexican accompaniment of the al
bum version). Both songs pleased the
longtime Browne fans and — after being
beaten to death by heavy metal mega
chords — wowed me, as he consistently
produced rich harmonious rhythms that I
forgot could be made from a guitar.
His band joined him for the second half
and they performed faster and more
politically conscious songs. The highlight
of this set occured when Browne brought
out a Chilean pipe player to accompany
him on a meaningful, heartfelt rendition
of "Lives in the Balance." Although his
original lyrics conveyed Browne's tone
and caring, he chose to craftily reiterate
his point by projecting haunting scenes of
children as soldiers and devastated cities
and civilians on a huge screen behind the
band. The screen, which consisted of 15
smaller screens, was utilized for lighter
songs as well, including a massive slide
show celebrating American people during
"America."

Browne emphasized his political aware
ness at the end of the set when he
thanked the crowd for coming and in ef
fect supporting medical help in El Sal
vador; all the concert's profits will go to
the Palo Alto-Stanford Medical Aid Cove
nant and the South Bay Sanctuary Cove
nant. He also mentioned the fact that the
Christie Commission is suing the CIA for
covering up information from El Sal
vador, and that the ensuing trial should
bring out the truth. Browne urged the au
dience to write their congressmen and
senators to support the Christie Commis
sion.
Throughout the show, Browne exhib
ited his ability as an established enter
tainer, telling humorous vignettes in be
tween songs and sensing the crowd's
needs and playing to them. The crowd it
self was obviously not the typical rock au
dience — the majority of fans were
middle-class adults between 25 and 40,
with an intelligence that showed through
out the concert.
In the middle of the concert. I would
have described the crowd as responsive,
but not overly enthusiastic. That started
to change as I noticed more and more
head swaying and feet tapping as the
show progressed. My initial assessment
was completely reversed at the end of the
concert, as the capacity crowd responded
with three standing ovations that were as
loud as I've ever heard. Browne also
responded with four encore songs and
kept the audience on its feet clapping and
dancing throughout the last two.
Overall, I enjoyed both segments of the
concert, although I liked the older songs
better, probably because of the beautifully
consonant chords and rhythms of the
guitar and piano/synthesizer parts, and

for the simple fact that I could hear the in
sightful lyrics better.
A couple of times, I thought the lyrics
didn't really fit on the faster songs. For in
stance, Browne was just ending a verse

about world hunger as his guitarist broke
into a raucous solo. That is my only small
complaint; on the whole 1 must say that
Browne made a fan out of me. Instead of
wasting his money on drugs or

materialistic abundances like the
majority of today's rock stars, Browne is
entertaining and informing the public for
its own good. I only wish more performers
would aspire to his example.


Sunday night, Jackson Browne gave a well-received concert at
San Jose's Center for the Performing Arts to benefit the Palo
