# 'Heart' to figure out
## 
### JAMES LUJAN Editorial staff 
Director Alan Parker ("Midnight
Express." "Pink Floyd: The Wall."
"Birdy") has come up with some
strange films in the past, but
nothing he's done so far surpasses
the strangeness and pretentions
of his current release. "Angel
Heart."
Set in 1955, "Angel Heart" stars
Mickey Rourke as Harry Angel, a
down-and-out private eye who is
hired by the sinister and Imposing
Louis Cyphre (Robert De Nlro) to
track down a former big band
singer who has disappeared. An
gel's search leads him from New
York to New Orleans, where he
becomes entangled In a web of
murder, the occult, chickens and
a good deal of heavy-handed sym
bolism.
The film is based on William
HJortsberg's novel. "Falling An
gel." Parker says he was attracted
to the material because of its
"fusion of the two genres: the clas
sic Chandleresque detective novel
and the supernatural." Unfortun
ately, the two genres don't fuse
very well. After seeing the film. I
couldn't understand what it was

supposed to mean. Even harder to
understand Is why Parker made
this film In the first place.
If the movie had been a little
more entertaining, these ques
tions might not have mattered,
but the narrative moves at a
snail's pace and only occasionally
is its lingering dullness inter
rupted by moments of violence
and gore. The thing that might
have saved the film and made it
more involving would have been
the presence of an interesting,
sympathetic character, but there
are none on hand here.
Mickey Rourke is fast becoming
my least favorite actor. With such
overmannered. unlikable perfor
mances in "Year of the Dragon''
and "9 1/2 Weeks." Rourke is
more successful at conveying ob
noxiousness rather than pathos.
Harry Angel is a typical Rourke in
carnation — brooding and sleazy.
Since there is no reason to care for
his character, it becomes even
harder to care for the movie.

After "Year of the Dragon" and "9 1/2 Weeks," Mickey Rourke would
dearly love to get a part in a good movie. "Angel Heart" isn't the movie
he's been looking for; looks like he'll have to keep running a while
more.
proving that she can't act. She
says her lines like she's saying
lines and she tries to be Inno

barrassing than anything else.

rious, overweight Cypher. This is
definitely the weirdest role De Niro
has ever had. We're so used to
seeing De Nlro playing intro
spective, real-person types that he
seems totally out of place here
playing a larger-than-life charac
ter. However, despite the fact that
he tries to camp up his perfor
mance by injecting all sorts of
little mannerisms — like preoc
cupying himself with his
manicured fingernails — he still
has enough presence to make his
appearance interesting and funny
to watch.
Lisa Bonet makes her feature
film debut as Epiphany Proudfoot,
one of the people with whom Angel
hooks up during his Investiga
tion. Talk about weird roles: If
Bonet was trying to prove that she
could break out of her "Cosby
Show" image by dousing her
writhing body with chicken blood
and appearing in nude sex scenes,
she's done a good job. Unfortun
ately, she's also done a good job

The movie has recently aroused
a great deal of controversy because
of a love scene between Rourke
and Bonet. The Movie Producers
Association of America slapped
the movie with a dreaded 'X'
rating because it felt the scene
was too violent. Parker, hoping to
preserve his artistic Integrity, ap
pealed the rating twice, but to no

avail. He eventually ended up
chopping 10 seconds of Mickey
Rourke's backside to appease the
ratings board. What difference 10
seconds is supposed to make we'll
never know; the scene is bloody
and violent enough, anyway.

Talk about weird roles. If Bonet
was trying to change her 'Cosby
Show' image by dousing her writh
ing body in chicken blood and
appearing in nude sex scenes, then
she's done a good job.

The whole movie isn't a total
loss, though. Michael Seresin's
dark, color-saturated cinematog
raphy helps to create a noir-like
atmosphere and the movie has
enough thrills and chills for a
good Saturday night date. Other
than that, its a muddled, preten
tious exercise that aims high and
comes out shooting blanks.

Cover your eyes! The love scenes in "Angel Heart" originally earned the movie an 'X' rating, until 10
seconds were cut out Romping around above are Mickey Rourke, playing a detective, and yes, Lisa Bonet,
playing the daughter of a voodoo priestess.
