# 'Heart' to figure out

### JAMES LUJAN Editorial staff 
Director Alan Parker ("Midnight
Express." "Pink Floyd: The Wall."
"Birdy") has come up with some
strange films in the past, but
nothing he's done so far surpasses
the strangeness and pretentions
of his current release. "Angel
Heart."
Set in 1955, "Angel Heart" stars
Mickey Rourke as Harry Angel, a
down-and-out private eye who is
hired by the sinister and Imposing
Louis Cyphre (Robert De Nlro) to
track down a former big band
singer who has disappeared. An
gel's search leads him from New
York to New Orleans, where he
becomes entangled In a web of
murder, the occult, chickens and
a good deal of heavy-handed sym
bolism.
The film is based on William
HJortsberg's novel. "Falling An
gel." Parker says he was attracted
to the material because of its
"fusion of the two genres: the clas
sic Chandleresque detective novel
and the supernatural." Unfortun
ately, the two genres don't fuse
very well. After seeing the film. I
couldn't understand what it was

supposed to mean. Even harder to
understand Is why Parker made
this film In the first place.
If the movie had been a little
more entertaining, these ques
tions might not have mattered,
but the narrative moves at a
snail's pace and only occasionally
is its lingering dullness inter
rupted by moments of violence
and gore. The thing that might
have saved the film and made it
more involving would have been
the presence of an interesting,
sympathetic character, but there
are none on hand here.
Mickey Rourke is fast becoming
my least favorite actor. With such
overmannered. unlikable perfor
mances in "Year of the Dragon''
and "9 1/2 Weeks." Rourke is
more successful at conveying ob
noxiousness rather than pathos.
Harry Angel is a typical Rourke in
carnation â€” brooding and sleazy.
Since there is no reason to care for
his character, it becomes even
harder to care for the movie.
Robert De Nlro looks hilariously
awful with his mane of long hair,
long nails and scruffy beard in his
"special appearance" as the myste-

After "Year of the Dragon" and "9 1/2 Weeks," Mickey Rourke would
dearly love to get a part in a good movie. "Angel Heart" isn't the movie
he's been looking for; looks like he'll have to keep running a while
more.
