The Beatles
"Please Please Me"

man, Larry "Bud" Melman
Unless you live at the bottom of
a very dark hole, you know that
two weeks ago. the first four
Beatles albums were released on
compact disc. Unless you don't
read the papers, you know that
CDs are the latest and greatest
way to listen to music. They're
these little shiny plates, see, and
the music is digitally packed in
there. I have no idea how they do
this, but if you have an expen
sive machine, you can get these
numbers out and it sounds like
music. Amazing. No tick, hiss or
buzz. And they tell me it lasts
forever. Your parents use em to
listen to Bach. Your broker lis
tens to Windham Hill on 'em.
The jerk down the hall has Iron
Maiden's live double album on
disc. You've been waiting, and
now you can have the Fab Four.
Oh, and unless you have been
brain dead for some time now,
you know that Beatles have had
the most significant impact on
Western civilization since St.
Augustine and his pears. Yeah,
when they revise Western Cul
ture, they better put some Len
non/McCartney and Harrison in
there, or there's gonna be some
serious heck going down.
Anyway, the point is that I just
got "Please Please Me" (the
Beatles' first album) on disc for
my birthday. I don't have a CD
player. See. I figure that you
can't really appreciate having CD
technology until you get some
discs and savor them for a long,
long time. If you get the player
first, all you're going to do is go
to a record store (note that
they're still called "record"
stores) and stand there in the CD
section trying to figure out what
to get. and you'll end up panick
ing because you have to get
something to play and so you'll
buy some stuff you don't really
want and since they're your only
discs, you'll play them all the
time and your roommate will
hate you and you'll hate your CD
player and all of technology and
then you'll go live in a cave and
chew rocks. It happens all the
time. I didn't want it to happen
to me. So I'm savoring my discs.
To review it. I marveled at the
shininess of the disc, read the
liner notes, played with the plas
tic cover and played the record
and tried to imagine what it
would sound like without that
annoying click in the middle of
"Love Me Do" or that irritating
series of pops between "Misery"
and "Anna (Go to Him)" and

having to turn it over and so on.
Man, I love this CD. It's great.
And I could skip all the songs I
don't like. All those dumb non-
Lennon/McCartney composi
tions like "Anna" and "Boys" and
"Chains" that the liner notes say
they put in because they're con
cert favorites but which I say the
record company made 'em put on
'cause they thought they
wouldn't sell otherwise. That's
the only problem with "PPM."
Other than that, it's a terrific al
bum.

Y'know, there are three types
of people in the world. People
who say they hate the Beatles
just to be trendy and cool and
different, people who say they
like the later weird and political
stuff like on the "White Album"
or "Abbey Road." and people who
like it all but have a special soft
spot for the love and melody stuff
found on early (like this one) and
middle (like "Rubber Soul")
releases. That's me. and it
should be you. too. After all,
"Please Please Me" has '80s
dance faves like "I Saw Her
Standing There" and "Twist and
Shout," and still-classics like
"Do You Want to Know a Secret"
and "There's a Place" and the
title cut and oh-so-much more.
If you don't have any Beatles
records, and you have/are plan
ning to get a CD player, why not
start your collection now? Yeah,
you can get "Plear Please Me"
and pretend it's new. A couple
weeks later, you get "With the
Beatles" and enjoy that. And so
on. Pretty soon, you've relived
the '60s — only with crisper
sound, less time wasted and you
didn't have to go to war. Prob
ably.
Firehose
"Ragin' Full-on"
John Lis. John Lis, John Lis,
John Lis
"Oh God, it's another KZSU
Picks review of an incredibly
obscure record. 1 bet that poor

dweeb reviewing this thing
knows the shoe size, hair color
and favorite cereal of every band
member." Hold it. Now stop that;
you're getting cynical on us
again. Actually, I'll let you in on a
secret. In all likelihood, you and I
know the same amount about
Firehose. Nada. Nothin. El
Zippo. (Wait, no, it couldn't be. A
review without preconceptions,
without a "gee. they were so good
before everybody else started to
like them" attitude?)
Almost. Actually. I do know

that Firehose is the descendant
of a band called the Minutemen,
a band oft-mentioned when
people started talking about
"new American music." Firehose
was formed in the wake of a
tragic auto accident that claimed
the life of the lead singer for the
Minutemen, D. Boon. The other
members of the band, George
Hurley and Mike Watt, decided to
start a new band and chose one
Ed Fromohio to do the singing.
There, that's all I know.
Now. what about this record?
Like what little Minutemen I've
been exposed to. it's clearly not
for everybody. Those of you
looking for dance pop will be
bored and confused. Those lis
tening for artificial instruments
of any kind will hear one drum
set, one bass and one electric or
acoustic guitar, along with Ed
Fromohio doing his best to ac
quire the accent his birth
place/namesake deprived him of.
Not the stuff Howard Jones is
made of. The emphasis is on
short songs (there are 14 in all)
with simple, almost jazzy
melodies, active, musical bass,
and. well, Ed and his voice —
which, lest you get the wrong im
pression, is quite enjoyable.
There's not a hit single in sight,
although some of the songs are
reminiscent of early Talking
Heads.
This is a very strong album.
The sounds the band makes are
original and In refreshing con
trast to the usual three minutes

and 15 seconds of pop fluff you
get on your clock radio. However,
originality does have its draw
backs. This is not the easiest al
bum in the world to get ac
quainted with, but patience has
its rewards. Take my word for it;
after all, two days ago I hadn't
even given this band a listen.
Now I'll probably buy the album.

Billy Bragg
"Talking to the Taxman about
Poetry"

Fawn Hall, Fawn Hall. Fawn Hall
Fawn Hall

Billy Bragg, that brittle basher
from Britain, has bowled us an
other bag of biting bourgeoisie
baiting. First reactions to "There
is Power in a Union" and "Help
Save the Youth of America,"and
lyrics like "The Union forever
defending our rights/Down with
the blackleg, all workers unite"
are predictable. Half the people
raise their fists in the air and
stomp a lot. The other half
revoke Bragg's visitor's visa for a
tour and complain about "the
damn commie." Admittedly, the
lyrics are at times part of a
laughable "angry young man"
act, but only in his anthem for
unions. Beyond that, Bragg is a
pop folk singer with a voice and
scathing lyrics that rank with
The Clash and a catchy song
writer with a rockabilly flavor
here and a Who flavor there
(Kenny Jones did produce the al
bum).
"Talking to the Taxman about
Poetry" is the album that should
earn Billy Bragg his due. It has
smart, accessible music that
pushes his folk style a bit fur
ther. adding a bass in most
songs and a piano, violin and
even percussion in some. His
voice is young, thick and
working-class British. Listeners
won't drown in his political
message, either. Bragg thank
fully mixes in songs about people
we might even know in such
songs as "Greetings to the New
Brunette," (which has the line,
"And if you haven't noticed
yet/I'm more impressionable
when my cement is wet"), "Levi
Stubbs' Tears" and"The Pas
sion."
Don't miss his politics,
though, because when he's sing
ing his folksy socialism, he's at
his best. "Help Save the Youth of
America" is both clever and
remarkably insightful, as he
sings about the "suntanned sur
fer boys and the California girls"
who are "having fun. fun,
fun/Till Daddy takes the gun
away," and gives his plea: "But
you can fight for democracy at
home/And not in some foreign
land." Now. let's see if he can
manage to come back to the
United States again and tour.
