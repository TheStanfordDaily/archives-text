# 'Iron & Silk' goes through the back door

### HEATHER MILLAR 
Iron & Silk
By Mark Salzman
New York: Random House, 1987

A book like "Iron & Silk" couldn't have been writ
ten before the 1980s. The People's Republic of China
was too closed, the United States too hostile to allow
the sort of dally contact between Chinese and for
eigners which Salzman was lucky enough to enjoy
and upon which he bases this, his first book.
The small volume marks the first account of an
outsider's encounter with China in which the author
takes us away from official reception rooms and
hotels and air-conditioned buses, bringing us, as in
the Chinese Idiom, "through the back door" for a
closer look.
There are dozens of scholarly treatises on China
and scores of journalistic overviews written from the
safety Beijing's diplomatic compunds. But anyone
looking for an immediate, human book about China
and the Chinese would find one dry and the other
distant. This is why the the appearance of this down
to-earth book and Its witty author Is cause for what a
Mandarin storyteller would call "double happiness."
Salzman graduated from Yale in 1982, where he
had learned about all things Chinese. Though he
writes he "never liked traveling much," he needed a
job. He took a job with the Yale-China Association,
travelling to Changsha, the capital of Hunan (famous
for its hot foods), to teach at the Hunan Medical Col
lege.
People from other parts of China love to say that in
Changsha, there is "nothing to do, nothing to buy,

the people have no manners, the food is terrible and
the dialect sounds awful." Suffice to say, Chinese
who live in the country are extremely provincial and
Changsha is just an ordinary provincial town: poor,
dirty, crowded. The strength of "Iron & Silk" lies
precisely In the fact that It does take place in
Changsha instead of Beijing or Shanghai. It deals
with ordinary people facing extraordinary dilemmas
and with extraordinary people in ordinary settings.
Salzman's treatment deserves special admiration
since it would appear to be so very easy for a for
eigner posted to a small Chinese city to isolate him
self in groups of 10 or 12, banding against the over
one million Chinese who have no interest in foreign
ers other than their age and salary, and their atti
tudes toward home and Chinese food. Salzman — by
virtue of his fluent Chinese, his interest in martial
arts and his winning personality — manages to
break that barrier of initial pleasantries.
The first chapters relate poignant anecdotes that
could only happen in China today. In a creative turn
around, the book opens with a description of
Salzman's departure. "Playing their favorite game,
'Make a Regulation,' " customs officials decided that
it would be impossible for him to take his collection
of wushu swords out of the country. There was a
"regulation." In order to cajole the officials into let
ting him through, Salzman gave a martial arts dem
onstration. But "somewhere in midair, my
(Salzman's) pants split wide open from the base of
the zipper to the belt line in back. A crowd of giggling
old ladies rushed forward with needle and thread at
the ready." Few others have so faithfully related the
arbitrariness and good-natured helpfulness which
coexist in China.

Soon after his arrival, Salzman met Pan Xing-fu.
one of the nation's leading wushu experts. The
American vowed that he could "eat bitterness" by
suffering the pain and indignities which are a requi
site of martial arts training. Pan took him as his only
private pupil; Salzman learned to hit iron until his
knuckles become encrusted with scabs and
practiced the same klck-and-thrust motions until he
collapsed exhausted. Thus Salzman confronted the
"Iron" in Chinese society — the "hard school" aimed
at honing discipline, but springing from the same
part of the Chinese psyche that condones brutality in
pursuit of a goal.
If anyone could recognize the two sides of the
evasive Chinese character — quick, swift iron and
shimmering, evasive silk — the Chinese puzzle
would be understood. Salzman. thankfully, does not
presume to know the answer. At times, this leaves
the reader wishing he would at least take a stab at it.
and delve into the political ramifications of what he
saw. But it is exactly his refusal to do so that will
maintain the book's freshness decades hence.
Things have changed since 1984, when Salzman
left China. Even now, the work could not be said to
be "the latest word" on China. Yet this doesn't really
matter, since this is not a journalistic or political
book. It is a book about the enduring foibles of
people, as much about Salzman as about any
Chinese.
At best, the simple prose and the"I was there" ap
proach refrains from getting in the way of the
Chinese characters who should be the focus. At
worst, it is a little too egocentric. The book could
have done with fewer first person singular phrases.
To be just, this is not a book about China as a

whole, but rather about China through the eyes of
one person; this necessarily includes a lot about the
person seeing, as well as about what is being seen.
Salzman's approach — China as related to his inter
ests, his frustrations, his triumphs — could be the
only honest way to write about something as com
plex and contradictory as Chinese society.
In the hands of a lesser writer, the book could have
come off completely self-centered and boring. But
"Iron & Silk" is ultimately successful, partly because
of its wry humor and in part because the person
writing it is so interesting.
