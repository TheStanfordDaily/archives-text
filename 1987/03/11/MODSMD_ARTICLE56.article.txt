### RICHARD SERENO 
Blood, Bread and Poetry:
Selected Prose 1979-85
Your Native Land, Your Life
By Adrienne Rich
New York: Norton, 1986

"Blood, Bread and Poetry: Selected
Prose 1979-85" and "Your Native Land,
Your Life," like most of Adrienne Rich's
work of the last 20 years, invites, even
demands, renewed exploration of her
entire body of work. Rich's faithful
readers will be challenged and delighted
by these two new works.
For the newcomer, the essays of "Blood,
Bread and Poetry" and the poems of "Your
Native Land, Your Life" are excellent in
troductions to Rich's work and contempo
rary feminist studies. The reader can
shuttle between the prose and poetry,
which were written concurrently, to con
struct a deeper understanding of Rich's

concerns, demands and observations.
Rich maintains the strength of her work
by continuing to deny the universality of
her voice — or, for that matter, any voice.
Her work remains intensely personal,
even as it reaches out to make contact
with other voices in similar struggles.
Continuously infusing her prose with
her poetry, her present with her past,
Rich draws on a metaphor she used as
early as 1955 ("At the Jewish New Year")
to explore her Jewish background in
"Split at the Root: An Essay on Jewish
Identity." She continues this exploration
in the long poem "Sources," carefully
revising and refining the self-description
accumulated over 36 years of publication.
In her essay, Rich writes, "I have to
claim my father" and"I have to break his
silence." But in "Sources," she claims
only part of him: "the suffering of the
Jew" that he made "invisible" to her. She
rejects him as "the face of patriarchy,"

preferring to examine the silence he
masked.
Rich returns to an examination of her
present, female-centered world in
"Contradictions: Tracking Poems." In the
27th of these poems, Rich, stunning in
her consistency and complexity, re
nounces her father anew, turning from
him to others who are dispossessed: Afro-
American slaves and Ding Ling (a brilliant
Chinese woman writer imprisoned
during the Cultural Revolution). Whereas
her father taught her to "hold reading and
writing sacred," Rich insists in this poem
that "Reading and writing/aren't sacred
yet people have been killed/as if they
were."
Rich elaborates on this point in the title
essay of "Blood, Bread and Poetry,"
denying that the "song is higher than the
struggle." She insists that poetry not be
transcendent, supernaturally inspired or
universal, but must concern itself with
the "artist's relation to bread and blood."

Rich questions not only North Ameri
can (a geographic/cultural distinction
upon which she insists) society's attitude
toward poetry, but also the central tenets
of that society. Much as she explored
motherhood in "Of Woman Born" (1977),
Rich explores another institution not
commonly perceived as such in the essay
"Compulsory Heterosexuality and Les
bian Existence." She does not write off
heterosexuals as merely brainwashed,
but examines the economic and psycho
logical pressures, not to mention brute
violence, that have been and continue to
be employed to maintain the "natural" in
clination to heterosexuality.
For a poet whose politics are so per
sonal and personal life so political, it is
unusual for Rich's politics to overwhelm
her poetry, but it occasionally happens. In
the fourth of the "Tracking Poems," Rich
assumes the voice of a physically abused
woman coached to answer back by
"Women's Lib." Although the poem sug

gests Rich's complex reaction to this
coaching, the inauthentic voice of the
persona smothers the message. Rich bet
ter brings in the lives of other women
when she explicitly connects them to her
own.
Rich maintains an outsider's point of
view, but doesn't pretend to be a disin
terested observer. In the essay
"Disobedience and Women's Studies,"
she calls on "feminist scholars and teach
ers and students" not merely to endure,
but to "address the racism, misogyny, ho
mophobia of the university and of the cor
porate and militarist society in which it is
embedded." Rich's essays and poems
are suffused with a passionate, witty and
unnervingly honest outsider's gaze. And.
if nothing else, Adrienne Rich is a shame
less name-dropper. In her poems and
generous footnotes she gives us names
that have been overlooked, excluded or
deleted by mainstream scholars, names
that should be added to our reading lists
