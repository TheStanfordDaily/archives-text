# Hughes' latest really is 'Some Kind of Wonderful'
## 
### MARY SUNGAILA 
In the opening scene of "Some
Kind of Wonderful," Keith (Eric
Stoltz) tempts fate by calmly
walking In front of an oncoming
train and dodging It at the last
minute. At times you wish
writer/producer John Hughes and
director Howard Deutch had
taken a cue from their leading
man and displayed equal verve
and audacity in their film
making.
Instead, they stick to their
proven smash box office formula
of "The Breakfast Club," "Sixteen
Candles" and "Pretty In Pink." Al
though It's predictable, this for
mula works once again. "Some
Kind of Wonderful" makes the au

dience feel good; the pace Is fast,
the dialogue clever, the hero and
heroine charming, and the villain,
of course, Is easy to hate.
This time around. Eric Stoltz is
Keith, a shy, artistic loner from
the poor side of the tracks. His
best friend Is a girl, the punky,
spunky, drum-playing tomboy
Watts (Mary Stuart Masterson).
The cute, popular girl who's
caught Keith's eye is Amanda
Jones (Lea Thompson). But sadly
for the pining Keith. Amanda has
a rich, possessive boyfriend.
Hardy (Craig Sheffer), who consid
ers Amanda his sole property and
other girls as his equally rightful
potential conquests. When A
manda realizes the truth of
Hardy's lying and cheating ways,

Keith blindly steps in at the right
moment. Amanda agrees to date
him to get back at Hardy.
There's more. Watts, mean
while, quietly pines away over
Keith. Less than thrilled to see
him going after another girl and
keenly aware that Amanda is just
using him, Watts sticks around to
help Keith get what he wants and
maybe to help him realize what
this might exactly be.
Perhaps the weakest part of this
movie, with all its teen-aged
Sturm und Drang, is the plot. The
contrast between rich and poor is
overdone. Was your entire high
school ever concerned about tne
disruption of its social hierarchy
because of one date? The plot is
also highly reminiscent, to say the
least, of last year's "Pretty in
Pink." It's as if writer Hughes Is
trying to satisfy those who found
the poor girl/rich boy pairing of
that movie implausible and is now
pairing the two best friends from
the same side of the tracks.
But then again, plots such as
these are notoriously — almost
necessarily — unrealistic and
should not be analyzed seriously.
Hughes is a romantic. In college,
he spent hundreds of dollars each
month on phone bills to keep in
touch with his high school sweet
heart, whom he eventually
married. Evidently his heart rules
in real life just as it does in his
films; his viewers are encouraged
to give in to the irrational reason
ing of love.
The movie's stars are refresh
ing. For once, Hughes does not
resort to the tried-and-true, close
knit "Brat Pack" to fill his roles.
The originality and freshness
missing from the plot itself are to
be found in the performances of
the three principals. Lea

Thompson is well-cast as the
popular Amanda, with her easy,
likable air and charmingly
dimpled smile. Eric Stoltz, in a bit
less demanding role than his pre
vious one in "Mask," is an appeal
ing cross between Michael J. Fox
and Andrew McCarthy here both
clever and quippy and shy,

motivated by emotion. But Mary
Stuart Masterson Is the best thing
to happen to the film — captivat
ing, delightful and sassy, she

tosses off her witty dialogue with a
tap of a drumstick and an always
appropriate facial expression.
Though "Some Kind of Wonder
ful" has its flaws and noticeable

departures from reality. It's still
entertaining, an escapist's de
light. With a little suspension of
belief. It's fun and provides many
easy laughs. Like love. Its subject
matter, the movie leaves a dell
clous. delightful and lovely some
kind of wonderful feeling after
ward.
