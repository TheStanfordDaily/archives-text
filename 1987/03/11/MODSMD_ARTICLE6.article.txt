# Election date moved again

### MONIQUE SCHEER Senior staff writer 
The ASSU has reversed all previous decisions to
move the date of the spring elections. The elections
will be held as originally scheduled on April 14-15.
A meeting was planned for last Monday, when the
senators would have presumably voted to move the
elections to the second week of the quarter. Before
the meeting could take place, an article In the consti
tution was discovered that stated that the election
must be held during the third or fourth week of
spring quarter.
COP member Carey White said the senate finally
decided to keep the elections during the third week,
since the large number of slates will mean an almost
certain runoff election, which would have to be held
during the fourth week.
No meeting or vote of the senate affirmed the
reinstatement of the original date. Since the previ
ous changes had already been ruled unconstitu
tional, "people just called one another up" to inform
them of the final change, ASSU Election Commis
sioner Brett Jarvis said.
The date came into question initially when several
students running for office ob
jected to holding the election
during Passover, a major Jewish
holiday. In response, the senate
voted to move the election to April
28-29, during the fifth week of
spring quarter.
Some senate members discov
ered subsequently that the new
date was unconstitutional. The
ASSU constitution states In the
article on the legislative branch
that the elections must be held
during the second, third or fourth
week of spring quarter.
The senate then voted to move
the election back one week, but
encountered resistance from
Christian students running for of
fice, who said holding the election
during the fourth week would con
flict with Easter.
"A bunch of COP and senior
class slates came to us and said it
wasn't fair to respect a Jewish
holiday and disrespect a Christian
holiday," Senator Lorl Ebert said.
After discovering the clause In
the constitutional article for the
executive branch that outlawed
elections during the second week,
the senators were left with little
choice.
"There's nothing we can do
now, which Is really unfortunate, I
think." Senator Lisa Hulber said.
