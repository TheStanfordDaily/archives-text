Congress won't aid contras
WASHINGTON — House Minority Leader Robert Michel, R-111.,
conceded yesterday that Democrats have the votes to block aid to
the Nicaraguan contras next year and said he has urged President
Reagan to concentrate on negotiations to end the strife in Central
America.
With Democrats making the issue a test of party allegiance, sup
port for contra aid Is "slipping away" and "we pretty well know
where we are because we don't have the votes," said Michel In af
firming Democratic predictions that Congress will reject Reagan's
• 105 million request for the contras for the fiscal year that starts
October 1.
Michel cited Democratic gains in the House and Senate in last
fall's elections and added, "Let's face It, the Iran thing (the sale of
arms to Iran and diversion of profits to the contras) hasn't helped
us."
Michel's assessment — the gloomiest thus far for the adminis
tration's contra-aid program — came as House Democratic leaders
and the Senate Foreign Relations Committee called for U.S. sup
port of Central American efforts to end the Nicaraguan conflict by
a regional accord.
"The United States which is admired throughout Latin America
is not the United States of gunboat diplomacy and secretly mined
harbors but the United States of the Good Neighbor policy and of
the Alliance for Progress," said House Speaker Jim Wright, D-
Texas, in sketching out a Democratic policy that relies more on
diplomatic and economic efforts than military aid.
As part of their plan. House Democrats will push today for legis
lation to block release of any more funds to the contras, including
a final *40 million installment of aid for this year, until the ad
ministration accounts for funds diverted from arms sales to Iran,
money solicited from private sources and other previous contra
aid.
The measure would give the administration six months to make
such an accounting and require another vote of Congress before
funds are released.
"All they are trying to do is break the commitment that
Congress made last year," said Reagan in a meeting with congres
sional leaders. Presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said
Reagan would veto the legislation and predicted that Congress
cannot muster a two-thirds vote to override.
Support for Reagan remains low
WASHINGTON — President Reagan's shake-up of his White
House staff has helped stem the erosion in his public support, but
most Americans still view his explanation of the Iran-contra affair
with skepticism and believe important questions remain un
answered, a new Washington Post-ABC News Poll shows.
The survey, completed Monday, showed 47 percent of those
polled approve of the way Reagan is handling his job as president,
while 52 percent disapprove. That is slightly below the 50-47 per
cent positive rating he received in a similar poll in mid-January.
But it represents a modest improvement over figures recorded in a
separate ABC News poll taken after the Tower commission issued
its report criticizing Reagan's handling of the Ifan arms sale and
before the president's speech last Wednesday taking responsibility
for the matter.
Several of the survey findings cast doubt on the effectiveness of
the speech, but the evidence strongly suggests that Reagan's ac
tions following the Tower report — particularly the replacement of
White House Chief of Staff Donald Regan with former Sen.
Howard Baker Jr. — has bolstered his standing.
In the poll of 1,511 adults, taken last Thursday through Sun
day, 55 percent said Reagan has made the changes required to
recover from his mistakes in the Iran arms affair.
By an overwhelming 81-8 percent margin, they said Baker was a
good choice for the top staff job.
Babbitt throws hat into ring
MANCHESTER, N.H. — Promising that he will "dare to be differ
ent." former Arizona governor Bruce Babbitt formally began his
longshot quest for the 1988 Democratic presidential nomination
here yesterday with a call to "cast aside the tired orthodoxies that
hold back our leaders."
In a speech to a small group of supporters at a technology educa
tion center here, Babbitt accused President Reagan of conducting
"a government by TelePrompTer" and said the president who
succeeds Reagan "must say and do what other politicians dare not
even think.
"He must risk offending some potential supporters. He must
risk breaching the etiquette of Washington. He must lead."
Babbitt then outlined some of his proposals, which include
taxing of Social Security and other entitlement program benefits
above certain income levels, elimination of the mortgage interest
tax deduction for second homes and a halt to government sub
sidies for large, corporate farms.
S. African paper faces seizure
JOHANNESBURG, South Africa — The police threatened yester
day to seize an entire Issue of the Johannesburg Star, South
Africa's largest dally newspaper, in order to prevent publication of
an advertisement protesting indefinite detentions without trial,
but the paper obtained a court order declaring the ad legal and
prohibiting the police action.
The confrontation, which had angry editors and policemen
facing each other in the Star's pressroom, was one of the most
serious Incidents yet in connection with censorship of the news
media, and the press hailed it as a significant legal victory.
"We were delighted that we were able to prove a point," Harvey
Tyson, the Star's editor in chief, said after the court ruling, "and
the point Is whether we are able to debate the issue of detention
without trial."
A black-bordered, front-page editorial in the Star was far more
blunt.
"Suddenly in our country even the right to question imprison
ment without trial Is now threatened," it said. "How have we
reached this kind of totalitarian action? It Is a scandal, transcend
ing politics, which any citizen ignores at his peril."
Planet bombarded by neutrinos
EARTH — In what one astronomer termed "the most Important
event in astronomy" in two decades, scientists around the world
have confirmed that the recently detected exploding star, or su
pernova. more than 150,000 light years away has bombarded the
Earth with neutrinos, offering strong proof of some of the most
fundamental theories about the evolution of the universe.
Neutrinos, which are subatomic particles so small that they
usually pass through the Earth without hitting anything, were
captured in huge underground detectors in Japan and Ohio at al
most exactly the same time, scientists said yesterday. The reports
confirm what scientists had been hoping for since last week,
when the first report of such neutrinos was made in Italy. Ironi
cally. that report now appears to be wrong.
The detection of the neutrinos, which traveled for 900.000 tril
lion miles to get here, added to the near state of ecstasy in which
many astronomers have found themselves the last two weeks be
cause of the discovery of the supernova in the neighboring galaxy.
The supernova is the closest to the Earth In nearly 400 years,
and it was discovered Just as the star exploded, thus allowing sci
entists to study It during its earliest stages.
