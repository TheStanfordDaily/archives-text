# Contra investigation yields Stanford link
## 
### TRACIE THOMPSON Staff writer 
Congressional committees investigat
ing the Iran-contra affair have requested
information about legal advice given to
White House officials by a presidential ad
visory board whose members include the
director of the Hoover Institution and a
former dean of Stanford Law School.
According to the Tower commission's
report on the Iran-contra matter, the
President's Intelligence Oversight Board
(IOB) gave legal advice to National Secur
ity Council (NSC) officials concerning the
NSC's actions in support of Nicaragua's
contra rebels. W. Glenn Campbell, direc
tor of the Hoover Institution, is chairman
of the 108. Charles Meyers, former dean

of the law school, is also on the three
member advisory board.
The legal advice was requested by the
NSC's Lt. Colonel Oliver North and Vice
Admiral John Polndexter in 1984, after
Congress had voted to prohibit any covert
or overt military assistance to the con
tras.
Congressional Investigators from the
House Select Committee looking into the
Iran-contra affair have questioned the
lOB's general counsel, Bretton Sciaroni,
who .reportedly gave the legal opinion to
the NSC, according to the Times Tribune.
Meyers, who is now in private legal
practice in Denver, said that the Tower
commission and the House and Senate
investigating committees had asked the
108 for information. He said that he could

not discuss the board's actions.
"Until the president declassifies the in
formation we cannot comment," Meyers
said. "1 assume indue course (the infor
mation) will be released."
Meyers was on the faculty of the Stan
ford Law School from 1962 through 1981,
serving the last five years as dean. He said
that he was appointed to the 108 by
Reagan in 1982.
"Glenn Campbell, who is very close to
the president, knew me and persuaded
me to do it," Meyers said, adding that the
Reagan administration was seeking a
lawyer for the position. Both men are also
friends of William Clark, former national
security adviser to Reagan, Meyers added.
The third member of the board is busi
nessman Charles Tyroler. a Democrat

who Myers said is involved with the Com
mittee on the Present Danger, an organi
zation advocating a strong national
defense. Campbell, who was appointed to
the 108 in 1981, declined to answer ques
tions about the board.
Political Science Prof. John Manley des
cribed the connection between the Hoover
Institution and the Iran-contra affair as
"embarrassing to Stanford."
"(University President) Donald Kennedy
was warned (by members of the faculty)
about the political activities of the Hoover
Institution four years ago," Manley said.
"What we were warning about is coming
true."
Manley said that the University should
break ties with the think tank. "This

opens up an opportunity for Kennedy to
do something," he said.
Asked about the Hoover connection to
Reagan's advisory board, Provost James
Rosse stated that many University offi
cials and faculty are active in public policy
agencies. "I assume when faculty play
these roles they play them as individuals,"
he said.
The Tower commission report states
that the 1984 congressional act prohibit
ing aid to the contras was "subject to con
flicting interpretations."
"On the one hand, several of its con
gressional supporters believed that the
legislation covered the activities of the
NSC staff. On the other hand, it
appears that Lt. Col. North and
Vice Admiral Polndexter received
legal advice from President's Intel
ligence Oversight Board that the
restrictions on lethal assistance
did not cover the NSC staff." the
report states.
Congress had voted to prohibit
the Defense Department, the CIA
and any other agency or entity in
volved in intelligence from
"directly or indirectly" supporting
military operations in Nicaragua,

according to the Tower commis
sion report.
The commission also questions
whether it was appropriate for the
108 to give legal advice to the NSC,
in the section entitled "What Was
Wrong."
"Legal advice was apparently ob
tained from the President's Intelli
gence Oversight Board. Without
passing on the quality of that ad
vice, it is an odd source. It would
be one thing for the Intelligence
Oversight Board to review the le
gal advice provided by some other
agency. It is another for the Intelli
gence Oversight Board to be
originating legal advice of its own.
That is a function more appropri

ate for the NSC staffs own legal
counsel."
According to Meyers, the Intelli
gence Oversight Board Is
mandated to receive reports from
the federal intelligence commu
nity. and investigate "when we
have cause to believe there has
been some illegality."
The CIA. FBI and Defense De
partment are the agencies that
must report to the 108, Meyers
said. He also said that it was not
unusual for the board to be in con
tact with the NSC because that
agency "has been the conduit
through which we report to the
president."

Meyers also said that it was
"perfectly obvious that some
agencies won't report to us and
there is nothing we can do about
it." He said it was up to the White
House to determine what action to
take when informed of any ques
tionable activities by intelligence
agencies.
The board members are not
paid for their work, and report to
Reagan "about twice a year."
Meyers said. The 108 was estab
lished by an executive order of
President Ford in the wake of con
troversial FBI activity during the
Nixon administration, he said.
The order was renewed by Presi
dents Carter and Reagan.

and any other agency or entity in
volved in intelligence from
"directly or indirectly" supporting
military operations in Nicaragua,

according to the Tower commis
sion report.
The commission also questions
whether it was appropriate for the
108 to give legal advice to the NSC,
in the section entitled "What Was
Wrong."
"Legal advice was apparently ob
tained from the President's Intelli
gence Oversight Board. Without
passing on the quality of that ad
vice, it is an odd source. It would
be one thing for the Intelligence
Oversight Board to review the le
gal advice provided by some other
agency. It is another for the Intelli
gence Oversight Board to be
originating legal advice of its own.
That is a function more appropri

ate for the NSC staffs own legal
counsel."
According to Meyers, the Intelli
gence Oversight Board Is
mandated to receive reports from
the federal intelligence commu
nity. and investigate "when we
have cause to believe there has
been some illegality."
The CIA. FBI and Defense De
partment are the agencies that
must report to the 108, Meyers
said. He also said that it was not
unusual for the board to be in con
tact with the NSC because that
agency "has been the conduit
through which we report to the
president."

Meyers also said that it was
"perfectly obvious that some
agencies won't report to us and
there is nothing we can do about
it." He said it was up to the White
House to determine what action to
take when informed of any ques
tionable activities by intelligence
agencies.
The board members are not
paid for their work, and report to
Reagan "about twice a year."
Meyers said. The 108 was estab
lished by an executive order of
President Ford in the wake of con
troversial FBI activity during the
Nixon administration, he said.
The order was renewed by Presi
dents Carter and Reagan.
Congressional committees investigat
ing the Iran-contra affair have requested
information about legal advice given to
White House officials by a presidential ad
visory board whose members include the
director of the Hoover Institution and a
former dean of Stanford Law School.
According to the Tower commission's
report on the Iran-contra matter, the
President's Intelligence Oversight Board
(IOB) gave legal advice to National Secur
ity Council (NSC) officials concerning the
NSC's actions in support of Nicaragua's
contra rebels. W. Glenn Campbell, direc
tor of the Hoover Institution, is chairman
of the 108. Charles Meyers, former dean

of the law school, is also on the three
member advisory board.
The legal advice was requested by the
NSC's Lt. Colonel Oliver North and Vice
Admiral John Polndexter in 1984, after
Congress had voted to prohibit any covert
or overt military assistance to the con
tras.
Congressional Investigators from the
House Select Committee looking into the
Iran-contra affair have questioned the
lOB's general counsel, Bretton Sciaroni,
who .reportedly gave the legal opinion to
the NSC, according to the Times Tribune.
Meyers, who is now in private legal
practice in Denver, said that the Tower
commission and the House and Senate
investigating committees had asked the
108 for information. He said that he could

not discuss the board's actions.
"Until the president declassifies the in
formation we cannot comment," Meyers
said. "1 assume indue course (the infor
mation) will be released."
Meyers was on the faculty of the Stan
ford Law School from 1962 through 1981,
serving the last five years as dean. He said
that he was appointed to the 108 by
Reagan in 1982.
"Glenn Campbell, who is very close to
the president, knew me and persuaded
me to do it," Meyers said, adding that the
Reagan administration was seeking a
lawyer for the position. Both men are also
friends of William Clark, former national
security adviser to Reagan, Meyers added.
The third member of the board is busi
nessman Charles Tyroler. a Democrat

who Myers said is involved with the Com
mittee on the Present Danger, an organi
zation advocating a strong national
defense. Campbell, who was appointed to
the 108 in 1981, declined to answer ques
tions about the board.
Political Science Prof. John Manley des
cribed the connection between the Hoover
Institution and the Iran-contra affair as
"embarrassing to Stanford."
"(University President) Donald Kennedy
was warned (by members of the faculty)
about the political activities of the Hoover
Institution four years ago," Manley said.
"What we were warning about is coming
true."
Manley said that the University should
break ties with the think tank. "This

opens up an opportunity for Kennedy to
do something," he said.
Asked about the Hoover connection to
Reagan's advisory board, Provost James
Rosse stated that many University offi
cials and faculty are active in public policy
agencies. "I assume when faculty play
these roles they play them as individuals,"
he said.
The Tower commission report states
that the 1984 congressional act prohibit
ing aid to the contras was "subject to con
flicting interpretations."
"On the one hand, several of its con
gressional supporters believed that the
legislation covered the activities of the
NSC staff. On the other hand, it
appears that Lt. Col. North and
Vice Admiral Polndexter received
legal advice from President's Intel
ligence Oversight Board that the
restrictions on lethal assistance
did not cover the NSC staff." the
report states.
Congress had voted to prohibit
the Defense Department, the CIA
and any other agency or entity in

"directly or indirectly" supporting
