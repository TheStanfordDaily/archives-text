# Koop: No AIDS cure this century
## 
### 
WASHINGTON — Surgeon General Everett
Koop, saying "vaccines take a long time to
develop." predicted yesterday that an AIDS
vaccine will not be available for widespread
public use until the next century.
"It took 19 years to develop the vaccine
against hepatitis B after we knew where the
virus was, (and) this is a much more compli
cated virus than that," he said.
Although scientists attending an Interna
tional conference here last week said an AIDS
vaccine may come earlier, perhaps in the mid
-19905, and that limited tests on humans
would probably begin in the United States
before the end of this year, Koop said he does
not believe that a vaccine "Is in the cards for
this century."
Referring to Dr. Daniel Zagury. a French lm
munologist who recently Injected himself with
an experimental AIDS vaccine, Koop said: "The
mere fact that somebody is testing it on him
self, or you hear that we're doing preliminary
tests, means we're doing the very earliest pre
liminary tests. And before we have a vaccine
available for use Is a long way down the pike."
Speaking on the CBS television program
"Face the Nation," Koop also stressed that the
deadly disease, which has largely been
confined thus far in this country to
homosexual and bisexual men and in
travenous drug users, "has now gone over into
the heterosexual community."

"Although there are only 4 percent of those
who have AIDS now that are heterosexual, that
number Is going to mount," he said. "The way
we say It Is that by 1991, AIDS Itself will In
crease about ninefold, but heterosexual AIDS
will increase about twentyfold."
The surgeon general and other experts em
phasized the importance of educating the
public about how to avoid becoming infected
with the virus that causes AIDS and how to
prevent transmitting it to others. Koop.
however, defended the >80 million in federal
money allocated for AIDS education this year,
while Dr. Harvey Fineberg, dean of the Harvard
School of Public Health, said it was not nearly
enough.
"In my opinion, we're not even close," said
Fineberg, also appearing on the program.
"That amount of money is less money than one
company, Procter & Gamble, spent to market
two new products, liquid Tide and Crest
tartar-control formula."
Koop, on the other hand, said: "We're using
about a quarter of our AIDS budget for educa
tion. and inasmuch as the budget's gone up
every year, I see that as a hopeful sign, and I
think we can make do with the money we
have."
He was asked whether the AIDS education
process would be helped if President Reagan,
who has remained publicly silent on the AIDS
epidemic, would speak to American young
people on the subject.

"I don't know whether young people would
believe the president on a health matter any
more than they believe the surgeon general,"
Koop replied. "1 just think we have to keep
hammering away at it. It's a repetitive
message, but It's life-saving."
Flneberg also defended the Food and Drug
Administration, which has been under attack
recently for not making experimental AIDS
drugs more accessible to AIDS patients. The
FDA. in fact, has placed all AIDS drugs on an
accelerated regulatory pace and last week
licensed the first such drug, AZT, for market
ing.
"I don't believe the FDA is dragging its feet,"
Fineberg said. "The FDA has a strong orienta
tion toward protecting the public, including
patients with AIDS, against bad drugs. We
think of AZT as a success. We forget an earlier
drug called suramin that turned out to be a
terrible and dismal failure."
Tests using suramin on AIDS patients were
discontinued last year after researchers deter
mined that the drug had worsened their condi
tion.
"I do believe that the FDA could move more
effectively in making available drugs in proper
testing situations to apply to patients with
AIDS," Fineberg added. "We need. In other
words, to make the drugs more widely
available, but in a context where we learn
about how effective they are in a scientifically
controlled fashion." Washington Post
