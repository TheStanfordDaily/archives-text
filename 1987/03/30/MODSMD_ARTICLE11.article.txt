# Hotel plan wins preliminary OK

The Menlo Park Planning
Commission voiced tentative
approval last Monday for a pro
posed 350- to 400-room
"garden hotel" on 21 acres of
University land In Menlo Park,
but traffic considerations
remain to be resolved before
construction can begin.
The commission based its
preliminary approval on site
planning and exterior design
drawings prepared by the
hotel's architects, said Nlel
Davidson, University director
of housing and real estate de
velopment. Formal approval,
however, must wait until envi
ronmental impact reports and
a traffic model based on the
hotel's personnel and opera
tions projections are added to
the application.
"From a site planning stand
point, I think they've oriented
the nroject correctly," said
Douglas Bui, chairman of the

planning commission.
"Looking at the architecture, at
the basic concept, I think it's
going to be a first-class job."
However, he said, commission
members "still have reserva
tions about the traffic Impact,"
particularly along Sand Hill
Road, which runs adjacent to
the hotel site.
Davidson agreed that despite
the positive reception of the
proposed design, there are
some "traffic Issues" which
remain unresolved.
The hotel, to be located on
Sand Hill Road near Highway
280 on the northwestern edge
of campus, will consist of eight
buildings varying in height
from one to three stories. The
facility will Include a lobby, a
dining room, a 750-seat ball
room and a number of meeting
rooms, in addition to the guest
rooms. There will also be tennis
courts, a health club and a swim
ming pool.
Westin, a Seattle-based hotel
company, will build and operate
the hotel under a land-leasing
agreement with the University.
According to Davidson, the
hotel will "reflect the architectural

feeling of Menlo Park and the mid
peninsula." The architect's ren
derings of the proposed hotel's ex
terior depict low, sprawling
structures with repeating massed
gables and a number of covered
porches.
"The intent was not to reflect
campus." Davidson said. "There
will be lots of landscaping, and
some ponds and waterfalls. There
won't be any sandstone and red
tile roofs, or at least we don't think

so."
According to Paul Wilson of the
United Menlo Park Homeowners'
Group, construction of the hotel
can occur only if Menlo Park eases
density restrictions at the site.
Wilson and the Menlo Park
Homeowners' Group have
protested any density easement or
re-zoning for the site since the
hotel was first discussed last year.
"Everyone wants the money,
and they like the looks of a pretty

hotel, but someone will have to
take care of the traffic," Wilson
said. "Re-zonlng to twice the den
sity now allowed at the site, which
is what the proposal requires, will
produce a lot more traffic than
Sand Hill Road can adequately
handle."
The Westin company will study
the traffic problem and present
recommendations to the planning
commission within the next three
months.
