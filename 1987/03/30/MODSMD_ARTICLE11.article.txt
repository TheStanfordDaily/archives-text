### CHRIS MARIO 
The Menlo Park Planning
Commission voiced tentative
approval last Monday for a pro
posed 350- to 400-room
"garden hotel" on 21 acres of
University land In Menlo Park,
but traffic considerations
remain to be resolved before
construction can begin.
The commission based its
preliminary approval on site
planning and exterior design
drawings prepared by the
hotel's architects, said Nlel
Davidson, University director
of housing and real estate de
velopment. Formal approval,
however, must wait until envi
ronmental impact reports and
a traffic model based on the
hotel's personnel and opera
tions projections are added to
the application.
"From a site planning stand
point, I think they've oriented
the nroject correctly," said
Douglas Bui, chairman of the

planning commission.
"Looking at the architecture, at
the basic concept, I think it's
going to be a first-class job."
However, he said, commission
members "still have reserva
tions about the traffic Impact,"
particularly along Sand Hill
Road, which runs adjacent to
the hotel site.
Davidson agreed that despite
the positive reception of the
proposed design, there are
some "traffic Issues" which
remain unresolved.
The hotel, to be located on
Sand Hill Road near Highway
280 on the northwestern edge
of campus, will consist of eight
buildings varying in height
from one to three stories. The
facility will Include a lobby, a
dining room, a 750-seat ball
room and a number of meeting
rooms, in addition to the guest
rooms. There will also be tennis
