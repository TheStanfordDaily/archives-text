# NASA task force urges advances
## 
### BOB MICHITARIAN Editorial staff 
A task force headed by a Stan
ford professor will recommend
next week that the National
Aeronautics and Space Adminis
tration (NASA) speed the deploy
ment of orbiting research facilities
and alter the design of its pro
posed space station.
The Space and Earth Sciences
Advisory Committee Task Force
on Scientific Uses of Space Sta
tions — better known as the
Banks Committee after its chair
man, Stanford Electrical Engi
neering Prof. Peter Banks — is the
only NASA committee specifically
responsible for advising NASA on
the needs of research scientists.
After fact-finding meetings held
here Thursday and Friday, Banks
charged that those research needs
are not being met, since orbiting
research facilities will not be
available for at least eight years.
"As far as design of the technical
facilities goes, we're happy,"
Banks said. "The current space
station design, for example, is
very good. But we're unhappy that
everything is coming so late."
Banks said that by the time the
space station is launched, the
United States will be 16 years be

hind the Soviet Union in the study
of the physiological effects of
space flight.
Under current deployment
plans, the space station would not
be manned and no scientific ex
periments would be carried out
until at least 1995. NASA is now
under political pressure to delay
the station an additional two
years, a proposal Banks said
would be "disastrous."
In order to speed the construc
tion of the space station, the com
mittee will urge that NASA ap
prove the development of an un
manned transport rocket, the
Heavy Lifting Launch Vehicle
(HLLV).
"Currently, the space shuttles
would be exclusively responsible
for lifting the space station into
orbit," Banks said. "But with (last
year's) Challenger accident the
number of launches has been
reduced and the demands on the
shuttle program have increased."
While the space shuttle would
take 32 launches to lift the station
into orbit, the HLLV could ac
complish the task in seven
launches — five unmanned with
the HLLV and two manned with
the shuttles, he added.
"So far with the shuttle, the
mean time between accidents is

25 flights. That's not to say we ex
pect another accident, but there
will be glitches that will delay the
space station." Banks said.
In order to utilize the HLLV. the
design of the space station would
have to be modified. "It's a matter
of connecting two or more pieces
so they can be sent up together."
he said.
The task force is therefore
recommending that an alternative
design be drawn up alongside the
original plan, which is nearing
completion in its preliminary
stage. It would be ridiculous to
abandon work done already.
Banks said, because that would
only result in further delay.
Early space station designs have
been approved by Congress, but
none of the funding — approxi
mately *750 million, according to
Banks — has been approved for
release.
NASA official William Riley, who
attended the task force meetings,
said NASA could not go back to
Congress and say. " 'Oh, by the

way, sorry about that, but that's
not the right space station.' Can
you imagine Congress' reaction ?"
But Banks believes his commit
tee carries enough clout with
NASA to force some changes. "Our
relations with NASA are very
good." he said. "We've had tremen
dous success in getting response
to our proposals In the past. The
purpose of the space station is to
conduct research, so when we
talk, it's like E.F. Hutton talking."
The Banks Committee will also
call on NASA to:
□ Purchase intermediate plat
forms for use until the station Is
deployed. The platforms, which
are being developed by private
firms and will be available In the
early 19905, can house scientific
experiments for six months at a
time and could be visited periodi
cally by manned shuttle flights.
□ Develop the Extended Duration
Orbiter, a shuttle that can stay In
orbit 16 days as opposed to the
current shuttles' capacity of seven
