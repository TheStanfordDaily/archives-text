Drell speaks on SDI
Early demonstrations and deployment of
Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI) weapons sys
tems would be misguided,' Stanford Prof. Sid
ney Drell warned Thursday, March 12, in tes
timony prepared for the House Committee on
Foreign Affairs.
Drell called for continued support for the
"traditional" interpretation of the Anti-
Ballistic Missile (ABM) Treaty of 1972. He said

that "thus far. the overall pattern is one of
compliance (with the treaty)" by both the
United States and the the Soviet Union.
He said the "broad interpretation" of the
ABM Treaty that has been advanced to
legitimize tests of space-based weapons "is not
in our national security interest," because it
distorts research priorities with political moti
vations to stage early demonstrations.
L.A. talks attract 700
"Good students attract good faculty" at Stan
ford, Provost James Rosse told nearly 700
people at the Stanford Conference in Los An
geles March 14.
"The challenge and excitement of the very
best students was the thing that kept me at
Stanford during my early years there — that
and the attractiveness of high-quality faculty
similarly drawn to Stanford." said Rosse. who
addressed the conference along with Econom
ics Prof. Michael Boskin and Psychiatry Prof.
Herant Katchadourian.
Boskin, highly respected in Washington
D.C., said federal spending programs should
require more than a majority vote in Congress.
He called for the federal government to move to

a two-year budget cycle and establish a sepa
rate capital budget.
Katchadourlan told the audience that sex
can get better with age. There are real changes
In individual sexual response over time, but
these can be turned to a couple's advantage,
said Katchadourlan. who has taught more
than 10,000 undergraduates in a human
sexuality course.
"Sex for the young is fast and furious. It is
ignited easily and fizzles like fireworks. . . .
Men and women who grow in sexual sophisti
cation along with the years find vast new vistas
of sexual satisfaction in midlife."
Center receives $1.3 mil
Efforts to train a new generation of arms
control experts will be strengthened by a three
year. * 1.3 million grant from the Carnegie Cor
poration of New York to the Center for Interna
tional Security and Arms Control.
The largest segment will annually provide for
advanced training for three especially gifted
mid-career scientists In arms control and In
ternational security issues. The grant also will
support research on the future of U.S./Sovlet
strategic military relations.
