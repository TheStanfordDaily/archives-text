# USW files claim
## 
### AJ. THOMAS Staff writer 
The United Stanford Workers
union (USW) has filed a claim
against the San Mateo County
Narcotics Task Force alleging
that the task force illegally
helped the University prepare
for arbitration in the case of an
employee discharged last sum
mer.
The claim, filed March 10
with the San Mateo County
Board of Supervisors, requests
>100,000 in damages and im
mediate action by the super
visors to halt the allegedly un
lawful cooperation.
Larry Reid, an employee at
the Stanford Linear Accelerator
Center (SLAC), was one of three
workers arrested on minor
theft and drug charges as a
result of an undercover opera
tion by the task force in 1985-
86. Reid was arrested in June
and discharged by the Univer
sity on July 2. According to the
USW's claim, criminal charges
against all three men were later
dropped for lack of evidence.
The USW subsequently re
quested that a panel of three in
dependent arbitrators decide
whether Reid's dismissal was
justified, a common practice in
labor disputes. Reid's arbitra
tion hearing is scheduled for
April 8.
The USW claim accuses the
task force of "knowingly dis

closing confidential criminal
justice information" to the Uni
veristy in an effort to "support
management's position" in the
arbitration. These actions, the
claim contends, violate Califor
nia labor laws, as well as the
University's collective bargain
ing agreement with the union.
Michael Vartain, associate
staff counsel for the University,
downplayed the USW claim.
"This isn't one of the larger
labor issues on campus. " he
said. "We have a lot of arbitra
tions."
Vartain, who will represent
the University in the upcoming
arbitration, said USW had
equal access to all information
obtained from the police. "All
the information we have from
the police we gave to the un
ion," he said.
The USW claim asks the su
pervisors to order the task force
to cease providing information
and assistance to the Univer
sity. The claim also demands
that the task force provide the
USW with the names of all task
force agents and representa
tives interviewed by the Univer
sity, copies of all task force
reports, memoranda and notes
on the Reid case and a tran
script of a Jan. 28, 1986 tele
phone conversation between
Reid and the task force's under
cover informant at SLAC,
James Walker.
