## THE 						STANFORD DAILY An Independent Newspaper Ruling is laudable 
### 
The U.S. Supreme Court last week gave its
solid support to affirmative action after nine
years of waffling on the issue. The court's
move is a strong counter to Reagan adminis
tration efforts to eliminate affirmative action
programs and will protect those implement
ing the programs from reverse discrimina
tion lawsuits.
The case before the court was brought by
Paul E. Johnson, who argued that he was the
victim of reverse discrimination when in
1980 the Santa Clara County Transportation
Agency bypassed him for a promotion in or
der to give the job to Diane Joyce, who scored
slightly lower than he did in interview
evaluations. Joyce was promoted to road
crew dispatcher, a job traditionally held by
men, under the agency's voluntary affirma
tive action program. The court ruled six to
three that employers may give hiring and
promoting preferences provided the intent is
to eliminate "manifest imbalance" in tradi
tionally segregated job categories."
This is the clearest the court has ever been
on this issue. It has made a commitment to
affirmative action a necessary condition to
providing opportunities for women and

minorities to gain employment in areas
dominated by white males. In so doing, the
court has recognized the need to give a slight
advantage to the underrepresented â€” at
least until long standing social and psycho
logical factors barring them from particular
occupations are broken down.
The ruling comes at a particularly impor
tant time. The Justice Department has spent
the last six years arguing in favor of "sex
blind" and "color-blind" laws, and since Pres
ident Reagan appointed conservative An
tonin Scalia to the court and moved William
Rehnquist to Chief Justice, many supporters
of affirmative action have feared the court,
too, would choose to abandon affirmative ac
tion.
But this has not happened. Justice Byron
R. White dissented along with Rehnquist
and Scalia, who wrote a scathing opinion
saying the ruling had made Title VII of the
Civil Rights Act of 1964 "a powerful engine of
racism and sexism." Justice William Bren
nan Jr.'s majority opinion, however, firmly
established that affirmative action is a
needed remedy for the racism and sexism of
our society.
