# Students back Oxford
## 
### 
A number of us who have spent
time at Stanford-in-Oxford were
surprised by Jonathan Mann's
recent viewpoint (Daily, Feb. 20).
We can appreciate the fact that the
Oxford program fell short of
Mann's expectations. Most of the
problems he describes are real. We
encountered many of the same dif
ficulties fall quarter and contin
ued to encounter them in winter
quarter. Where we differ with
Mann is in considering these
problems sufficient grounds for
closing the center in Oxford.
Despite the program's shortcom
ings, we believe that closing it
would be a tragic mistake. The Ox
ford program has meant a great
deal to all of us and offers a range
of experiences that we think most
Stanford students would find sat
isfying, if not positively exhilarat
ing. In our reply to Mann's view
point we wish to convey a sense of
the variety of activities that can be
found here. In doing so, we hope
to contribute to a more complete
picture of what life at Stanford-in-
Oxford is all about.
Lots of drama
opportunities
For those interested in the arts,
Oxford is a gold mine of opportu
nities — both in music and
drama — with shows ranging
from Shakespeare to Sondheim.
With a little luck, I found myself
involved in two productions: a
student-written musical and an
ensemble play. Both were excel
lent theatrical experiences but,
more importantly, they provided a
place inside the Oxford commu
nity from which my memories
were formed and my English
friendships grew. Through the
play, I was able to travel to several
towns throughout England to
perform. These traveling episodes
and all the time spent as a group
made our cast of seven a close
bunch. The musical was a larger,
more spread-out group, but was
connected with the
church/fellowship I had become
involved with and hence created
another opportunity to get to
gether with the people I was
already seeing on Sundays.
The Oxonians I worked with
were very welcoming and encour
aging of my participation. I only
wish I had time to stick around
and do more.

unique travel
My integration into the Oxford
community came unexpectedly. I
did not search out a sports team
but was asked to water polo
practice by a fellow Stanford stu
dent. When my new teammates
realized that I was willing to show
up every Tuesday night, I was
accepted — no questions asked.
We traveled to weekly games,
which showed me much of South
ern England not mentioned in
"Let's Go" and even allowed me to
meet players from that other
school (no. not Berkeley —
Cambridge).

I have made friends — not ac
quaintances — playing on an
Oxford sports team. I have stayed
in their homes and already a
teammate has plans to visit me in
the States. They have helped me
understand the foreignness of
their culture and have provided
an alternative view of my own.
That is something unique and
not easily had back on the Farm.

Instruction is
individualized
I meet with my tutor once a
week, usually for about two
hours. He is a senior research
fellow at St. John's, one of the
Oxford colleges, and is the author
or editor of some 17 books. A
bright fellow, my tutor. I look
forward to my sessions with him
— one-on-one, at his house, over
coffee and "biscuits." Digression
and chit-chat seem very often to
take up the greater part of our
time together. Neither of us
minds, though; this time is more
instructive in many ways than
the time spent discussing formal
subjects.
He "sets" an essay for me every
couple of weeks. I write it out in
longhand, usually in pencil on
legal pad. and then read it to him
at our meeting. He Interrupts me
(always courteously) when he has
something to add or suggest. It is
difficult for me to imagine a more
personal method of instruction.

Learning the
Brits' attitude
At Stanford it becomes easy to
assume that vivacity is as much a
part of life as breathing. This is a
distinct counterpoint to the atti
tude in Britain, where glad
handing is seen as being just a
notch above psychosis. Conse
quently. reserved foreigners have
a double bind confronting them
in Oxford: how to meet the un
meetable.
I haven't solved that problem
yet. but arguably, watching the
self-absorbed TV newscasts,
people-ogling in the teahouse and
contemplating life in the emerald
serenity of Oxfordshire is as
much a part of being overseas as
participating in every conceivable
extracurricular activity. Life is
not measured by how many
people you meet in a couple quar
ters' time.
The glory of being away from
the sunlit bustle of Palo Alto is
that its charm defies rational
explanation. Why not just give in
to the sensation of being halfway
across the world? That, in itself,
is reason enough to keep the
Oxford program afloat.

Orchestrated
participation
Why come 7,000 miles to talk
only to people wearing Stanford
sweatshirts? As a violinist in the

Oxford Philharmonic and in one
of the college orchestras, I made
many English friends, ate meals
with them and went to the
"orchestra pub" after rehearsals. I
did put up with occasional Ameri
can accent jokes. I guess if that
bothers you, that's the price you
pay when you leave the "Stanford
womb."
One of my best opportunities to
interact with English students
came when I joined a string quar
tet. Besides enjoying these new
friends, we were coached by Ox
ford's Allegri Quartet. We were
even invited to play Strauss
waltzes at a college ball.
Any student interested can
participate in musical
ties here. One person in the Stan
ford house plays saxophone in
three groups; another plays
violin. We have all found music a
rewarding part of Oxford. Even if
we did have to show a little effort
and walk out the front door.

Row with the
best of them
Of the many Oxford sports that
Stanford students can and do
participate in — crew, rugby,
cricket, water polo, volleyball and
ice hockey to name the most
popular — I chose to row. To be
sure, I am no Oxford blue, but the
enjoyment is hardly less.
Primarily, rowing has been an
effective vehicle for getting to
know Oxford students. And in a
situation that poses some prob
lems for integration, this advan
tage is anything but negligible.
I'm certain the team camaraderie
has made more enjoyable my time
off the water when I am either
dining in college or socializing
with other rowers.

Getting an
insider's view
by writing
Writing features for Oxford's
student newspaper, "Cherwell."
gave me the perfect opportunity
to experience university life.
Through my assignments I began
to understand how the institu
tion works — not as a tourist but
as an insider.
I simply attended the first con
tributors' meeting and volun
teered for assignments. Through
out winter term I Interviewed the
personalities who instill Oxford
with the energy for which it is
famous. By the end of the quarter
I found myself Interested in and
had developed an understanding
of national issues as well as stu
dent activities.
The staff not only encouraged
me to contribute, they welcomed
me into their world. And al
though my editors' attempts to
convert me to socialism didn't
fully succeed, they became my
close friends. The results of my
attempts to avoid being an
"outsider looking in" surpassed
all of my Initial expectations.
