# Jews, others offended

Who will it be next, Michael Myers? Homosexuals,
Eastern Europeans, Arabs, Catholics? Whom will
you offend next with your convoluted demagoguery,
your ill-concealed attempts to rabble-rouse or other
wise make your noxious presence felt among differ
ent campus organizations and individuals?

Since others have already lambasted Myer's first
attempt at confrontational letter-writing (Daily, Feb.
5), I will concern myself solely with his letter on John
Demjanjuk (Daily, March 6).
Although it is difficult to find coherence or
structure in Myers' argument, I believe that I have
managed to unearth one consistent line of
"reasoning" and a simple conclusion. Myers con
tends that, as a result of the severity of Is
raeli/Jewish passions, it will be impossible for Dem
janjuk to receive a fair trial in Israeli courts. America
should not have extradited the defendant to Israel
but rather established a sort of v/orld court within a
neutral country to try this particular individual.
I do not find fault with the underlying logic of this
idea. American due process has always required that
one's trial should be in a court of peers, in a location
where local bias will not affect its outcome. Whether
in this particular instance any country or organiza
tion other than Israel would step forward and estab
lish an international court of law. and whether the
decision of this court would have any binding effect,
is one obvious question that Myers (not surprisingly)
fails to explore.

Interestingly, my dispute with Myers lies not in
either the thesis or the structure of his argument,
but rather in the application of his rhetoric. While
pseudo-intellectual and left-wing circles find it vogue
to equate modern examples of man's inhumanity to
man with the horrors of the Holocaust, Myers' anal
ogy — between some of the more grotesque crimes of
World War II and the United States' extradition of
Demjanjuk along with his subsequent trial — strikes
me as particularly absurd. How can the trial of one
quite possibly guilty man be compared to the
slaughter of over 10 million Jews, gypsies,
homosexuals and other "undesirables"? Ten million
people! It is a number that keeps one awake at night
— a number that reduces Myers' hideous diatribe to
mere mockery.
Furthermore, statements such as "The Israelis
have a chip on their shoulder and the taste of blood
in their mouth" and phrases like "hyperemotional
Jews who alternate between cheering and crying" do
nothing but upset those unfortunate enough to have
had relatives die in the camps.
While I do not accuse Myers of being an outright
anti-Semite, virulent rhetoric such as his has no
place in a newspaper of the high journalistic stand
ards The Daily purports to maintain.
Myers has every right to express his opinions —
that is a liberty guaranteed by the Constitution and
the rationale behind editorial pages — but I believe
that within the context of a scholarly environment
and a presumably moderate student body, he and we
would be better served if he kept some of his more
outrageous ideas and phrasings to himself.
