Senate is not
incompetent
The recent editorial (Daily,
March 11) labeling the ASSU as
incompetent distressed me. It
mentions that "every ASSU elec
tion brings criticisms of the stu
dent senate . . . that it performs
few truly useful student func
tions." It then continues by using
the recent controversy over ASSU
election dates as an example of
this incompetency.
I am writing to correct your
misunderstanding of this issue.
The debate over ASSU election
dates does not exemplify senate

inadequacy. Rather, it reflects the
high level of sensitivity felt by
many senators toward groups
with special interests. Is it fair
that jusl because Steve Baer and
his colleagues are Jewish, they
should have less time to cam
paign because of Passover? Is it
fair that others who must go
home for Easter have to suffer in
terms of campaigning? Of course
not. So the ASSU has tried its
hardest to reconcile these con
flicts. This debate would not
occur at schools in most other
nations but the United States.
Let's not try to staunch it but
instead to encourage it!
I am also writing to reply to
your editorial comment that the
senate does nothing. That is just

not true. In fact, this senate has
been more active than most. A
senator got change machines put
into Wilbur. Senators are organiz
ing a March for Education on
Sacramento. The senate helped
get additional funding for five
varsity sports that were facing
elimination. The senate gives
students a chance to exercise
leadership.
I would simply end by asking
the Daily editorial board to
postpone its criticism of the sen
ate until after it does its research.
There are a lot of dedicated people
at the ASSU who would be happy
to help the board in this en
deavor.
