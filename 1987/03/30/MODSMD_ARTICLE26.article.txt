## Windham Hill: A Stanford success story 
### ROB REID 
OK, time for "Name That Corporation."
This is a company started back in 1976 by two
Stanford dropouts with *300. It was managed out of
a Palo Alto living room for years, enjoyed exponential
sales growth throughout the early '80s and is now ex
panding at a comfortable rate of 30 to 40 percent a
year.
This company's staff has expanded twentyfold in
the past 10 years, and although it is one of its indus
try's fastest growing and most respected firms, it's
still privately held. Just another Silicon Valley suc
cess story, right? Well, not exactly.
The company is Windham Hill Records, and al
though it is often described as "brilliantly Innova
tive," "ground-breaking," "state-of-the-art" and
"pioneering." it Is far removed from the realm of Ap
ple or Hewlett-Packard.
Windham Hill has ushered in a whole new genre of
music and in the process has spawned a group of im
itators ranging in stature from new garage labels to
industry giants like CBS Records.
The genre is widely known as "New Age," though
company representatives aren't fond of Windham
Hill being pigeon-holed with that label. A growing
number of record stores have set the music off by it
self by devoting sections to Windham Hill along with
their jazz, rock and classical departments.
Virtually all Windham Hill records are instrumen
tal. The earliest releases were acoustic and some
what folksy. Piano and guitar solo albums with a
minimum of technological embellishments were the
norm. But as time passed, the Windham Hill sound
evolved and now includes synthesizer artists, full en
sembles and movie soundtracks.
The label's artists include pianist George Winston
(whose album "December" has sold over a million
copies), guitarist Michael Hedges and the band
Shadowfax.
When Anne Robinson and guitarist William Acker
man left Stanford In 1969, it was not with the inten
tion or expectation of creating all this. Robinson,
who is the company's chief executive officer, said she
left Stanford because "It was a very hard time to be in
college.
"It was very upsetting to most people about the way
the world worked and the politics and the war in
Vietnam," she says.
"And though I never regarded myself as a heavily
political person, It was a point where a lot of people
had a lot of questions, and many people In my class
were in and out of school," she explains. Robinson
returned to Stanford to finish her degree in 1983.
During the six years after Robinson left Stanford,
she worked as a clothing designer, a textile designer
and as a bookstore clerk while Ackerman did con
struction work. In 1976, Ackerman decided to record
an album of his music — and Robinson agreed to
help him. Thus Windham Hill Records was born.
"The sum total of my (original) ambitions con
sisted of selling 300 records, which was the mini
mum order the record pressing plant demanded,"
Ackerman says."I fully envisioned a closet in my

house laden with at least 100 extra records for the
rest of my life."
From there, events seemed to take charge of them
selves. The orders kept coming In. radio stations
picked up on the sound, and soon Robinson and
Ackerman were producing other artists as well. Even
at that point, they didn't expect to be heading toward
big things.
"Initially we would say to people, 'If we make a
record for you, you'll be getting a 12-by-12 calling
card that may make it a bit (more) possible to play
someplace and make some money,' " Robinson re
members. "We didn't look at it as a long-term busi
ness plan."
The turning point came in 1980 with the release of
George Winston's "Autumn." Since that time, the
company has been a rapidly growing, full-time en
deavor for all concerned.
Today, Windham Hill produces over 40 artists and
has four subsidiary labels, including "Open Air," a
vocal label; "Rabbit Ears," a children's label; and
"Magenta," a contemporary jazz label. There is also a
small video division, and the company plans to
launch a book publishing division soon.
As Windham Hill is expanding productions, it is
also broadening its markets. Robinson says that the
bulk of the company's listeners have traditionally
been between 24 and 45 years old, but now "high
school students and grandparents" are listening as
well.
Overseas markets are also being pursued
vigorously. According to Fritz Kasten, vice president
for corporate development, foreign sales already ac
count for 10 percent of all revenues. Japan, West
Germany and Britain are the oldest and largest
markets, but this year distribution is reaching such
remote places as Israel, Brazil, Malaysia and Korea.
Japan is by far the biggest overseas market. Kas
ten attributes much of this success to Japanese cul
tural norms.
"In Japan, there is a great deal of interest In spare
ness and simplicity and clear visual definition, and I
think that has been a major factor," Kasten says.
Windham Hill's unique approach doesn't stop with
its music. One visit to its corporate offices makes it
clear that the company's personal, relaxed approach
to music carries over at least partly to the working
environment.
The inobtrusive entrance in downtown Palo Alto
doesn't even have a sign with the company's name or
emblem on it — a stark contrast to the gaudy enter
tainment nerve centers in Los Angeles.
Robinson is not a distant, autocratic executive,
but is rather a familiar presence around the office,
and appears to be on a comfortable, first-name basis
with all her employees.
"This is by a far margin the best working environ
ment I've ever experienced," Kasten says.
This attitude is expressed by the label's artists as
well. Guitarist Michael Hedges said that he "wouldn't
want to work with anyone else" because "Windham
Hill is like a family, really.

Windham Hill recording artist Michael Hedges, shown here performing at the New Varsity Theater last
month, says he wouldn't want to work with any other company. "Windham Hill is like family, really," he
■'Says.
"I feel like I've grown with Windham Hill. When I
first started with them, they were a two-person oper
ation." he says.
Hedges has developed in many of the same ways as
his label. His first album. "Breakfast in the Field."
was one of guitar solos. In his second album, "Aerial
Boundaries." he added several other instruments, as
well as some sophisticated studio effects.
His latest album. "Watching My Life Go By," is a vo
cal album and contrasts dramatically with his ear
liest work. Hedges says he takes new risks with every
album because "it's the only way I can really keep
having fun."
Hedges is probably best known to Stanford stu
dents for his many local appearances, which have in
cluded shows at the Coffee House, Memorial
Auditorium. Frost Ampitheater and over 300 shows
at the New Varsity theater in Palo Alto, which was
recently sold.
His touring schedule Is formidable, sometimes in
cluding over 100 concerts in a year. He often tours
with other Windham Hill artists. His future projects
include another acoustic album, a live album (parts
of his last New Varsity concert may be used for this
project), and even a straight-out rock album.
Robinson said that Windham Hill's Open Air label
would "absolutely" release a mainstream rock album
if Hedges made one. The company, she says, is con
stantly seeking to increase the breadth of its sound.

Windham Hill has ushered in a whole new genre of
music and in the process has spawned a group of im
itators ranging in stature from new garage labels to
industry giants like CBS Records.
The genre is widely known as "New Age," though
company representatives aren't fond of Windham
Hill being pigeon-holed with that label. A growing
number of record stores have set the music off by it
self by devoting sections to Windham Hill along with
their jazz, rock and classical departments.
Virtually all Windham Hill records are instrumen
tal. The earliest releases were acoustic and some
what folksy. Piano and guitar solo albums with a
minimum of technological embellishments were the
norm. But as time passed, the Windham Hill sound
evolved and now includes synthesizer artists, full en
sembles and movie soundtracks.
The label's artists include pianist George Winston
(whose album "December" has sold over a million
copies), guitarist Michael Hedges and the band
Shadowfax.
When Anne Robinson and guitarist William Acker
man left Stanford In 1969, it was not with the inten
tion or expectation of creating all this. Robinson,
who is the company's chief executive officer, said she
left Stanford because "It was a very hard time to be in
college.
"It was very upsetting to most people about the way
the world worked and the politics and the war in
Vietnam," she says.
"And though I never regarded myself as a heavily
political person, It was a point where a lot of people
had a lot of questions, and many people In my class
were in and out of school," she explains. Robinson
returned to Stanford to finish her degree in 1983.
During the six years after Robinson left Stanford,
she worked as a clothing designer, a textile designer
and as a bookstore clerk while Ackerman did con
struction work. In 1976, Ackerman decided to record
an album of his music — and Robinson agreed to
help him. Thus Windham Hill Records was born.
"The sum total of my (original) ambitions con
sisted of selling 300 records, which was the mini
mum order the record pressing plant demanded,"
Ackerman says."I fully envisioned a closet in my

house laden with at least 100 extra records for the
rest of my life."
From there, events seemed to take charge of them
selves. The orders kept coming In. radio stations
picked up on the sound, and soon Robinson and
Ackerman were producing other artists as well. Even
at that point, they didn't expect to be heading toward
big things.
"Initially we would say to people, 'If we make a
record for you, you'll be getting a 12-by-12 calling
card that may make it a bit (more) possible to play
someplace and make some money,' " Robinson re
members. "We didn't look at it as a long-term busi
ness plan."
The turning point came in 1980 with the release of
George Winston's "Autumn." Since that time, the
company has been a rapidly growing, full-time en
deavor for all concerned.
Today, Windham Hill produces over 40 artists and
has four subsidiary labels, including "Open Air," a
vocal label; "Rabbit Ears," a children's label; and
"Magenta," a contemporary jazz label. There is also a
small video division, and the company plans to
launch a book publishing division soon.
As Windham Hill is expanding productions, it is
also broadening its markets. Robinson says that the
bulk of the company's listeners have traditionally
been between 24 and 45 years old, but now "high
school students and grandparents" are listening as
well.
Overseas markets are also being pursued
vigorously. According to Fritz Kasten, vice president
for corporate development, foreign sales already ac
count for 10 percent of all revenues. Japan, West
Germany and Britain are the oldest and largest
markets, but this year distribution is reaching such
remote places as Israel, Brazil, Malaysia and Korea.
Japan is by far the biggest overseas market. Kas
ten attributes much of this success to Japanese cul
tural norms.
"In Japan, there is a great deal of interest In spare
ness and simplicity and clear visual definition, and I
think that has been a major factor," Kasten says.
Windham Hill's unique approach doesn't stop with
its music. One visit to its corporate offices makes it
clear that the company's personal, relaxed approach
to music carries over at least partly to the working
environment.
The inobtrusive entrance in downtown Palo Alto
doesn't even have a sign with the company's name or
emblem on it — a stark contrast to the gaudy enter
tainment nerve centers in Los Angeles.
Robinson is not a distant, autocratic executive,
but is rather a familiar presence around the office,
and appears to be on a comfortable, first-name basis
with all her employees.
"This is by a far margin the best working environ
ment I've ever experienced," Kasten says.
This attitude is expressed by the label's artists as
well. Guitarist Michael Hedges said that he "wouldn't
want to work with anyone else" because "Windham
Hill is like a family, really.

Windham Hill recording artist Michael Hedges, shown here performing at the New Varsity Theater last
month, says he wouldn't want to work with any other company. "Windham Hill is like family, really," he
■'Says.
"I feel like I've grown with Windham Hill. When I
first started with them, they were a two-person oper
ation." he says.
Hedges has developed in many of the same ways as
his label. His first album. "Breakfast in the Field."
was one of guitar solos. In his second album, "Aerial
Boundaries." he added several other instruments, as
well as some sophisticated studio effects.
His latest album. "Watching My Life Go By," is a vo
cal album and contrasts dramatically with his ear
liest work. Hedges says he takes new risks with every
album because "it's the only way I can really keep
having fun."
Hedges is probably best known to Stanford stu
dents for his many local appearances, which have in
cluded shows at the Coffee House, Memorial
Auditorium. Frost Ampitheater and over 300 shows
at the New Varsity theater in Palo Alto, which was
recently sold.
His touring schedule Is formidable, sometimes in
cluding over 100 concerts in a year. He often tours
with other Windham Hill artists. His future projects
include another acoustic album, a live album (parts
of his last New Varsity concert may be used for this
project), and even a straight-out rock album.
Robinson said that Windham Hill's Open Air label
would "absolutely" release a mainstream rock album
if Hedges made one. The company, she says, is con
stantly seeking to increase the breadth of its sound.

OK, time for "Name That Corporation."
This is a company started back in 1976 by two
Stanford dropouts with *300. It was managed out of
a Palo Alto living room for years, enjoyed exponential
sales growth throughout the early '80s and is now ex

year.
This company's staff has expanded twentyfold in
the past 10 years, and although it is one of its indus
