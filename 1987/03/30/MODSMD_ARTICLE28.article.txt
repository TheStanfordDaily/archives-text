## Streaking Cardinal now 11-0 in March 
### JOHN LIS Editorial staff 
The March to the pennant continues.
The Stanford Cardinal raised its record
in the month of March to a perfect 11-0
and moved into first place in the Pacific
10 Southern Division with a three-game
sweep over Arizona State this weekend at
Sunken Diamond. The Cardinal hasn't
lost since Feb. 28, and the 11-game win
ning streak is the longest since 1983.
Third baseman Ed Sprague hit a pair of
two-run homers to highlight a flve-RBI af
ternoon and power Stanford to a 12-6 vic
tory over ASU yesterday. Stanford won 3-2
Saturday and 10-3 Friday.
"You never know where you're going to
get coming off of finals," Stanford Coach
Mark Marquess said. "Obviously we've
been playing real well since finals." The
Cardinal has won all six games since the
two-week break for Dead Week and finals,
beating California 7-6 March 22, San
Jose State 5-3 March 23 and Hayward
State 14-3 March 24.
With the four wins in Six-Pac games
since finals. Stanford is now 8-2 in the
conference. That gives Stanford an .800
percentage, ahead of UCLA (11-4, .733),
but the Cardinal is a half-game behind
the second-place Bruins, who have played
five more games. Arizona State is in fifth
place at 4-8.
The hitting hero of the weekend was
first baseman Ron Witmeyer, who had
started the month in a woeful slump. Wit
meyer came into the series hitting only
.129, but went 6-for-ll with two home
runs and seven RBIs to raise his average
to .173.
"We've always had a lot of confidence in
Ron," Marquess said. "He was hitting the
ball better than his average shows, hit
ting hard balls that were caught. It was
just a matter of time. He has a good

swing. Over Dead Week and finals week
we got a chance to work on a new stance
with him."
"They stuck with me all the way
through It." Witrneyer said. "I know if I
were a coach, I'm not sure I would've
stuck with me. They always kept their
confidence in me, working with me early
on some things."
Yesterday was a classic display of
Arizona State baseball: A lot of offense,
but a futile search for a pitcher to shut
the door. The Sun Devils took a 5-2 lead
on a grand slam by left fielder Steve
Mariucci in the top of the sixth inning,
but then watched helplessly as four
pitchers could not stop the Cardinal from
scoring seven runs in the bottom of the
inning.
ASU starter Mike Schwabe had settled
down after a shaky first inning that saw
Stanford take a 2-0 lead, retiring 15 of 16
hitters through the fifth. After surrender
ing Sprague's first homer, a line shot over
the soccer bleachers in left field, he left to
make way for David Cassidy.
"It was a slider up." said Sprague, who
leads the Cardinal with nine homers and
36 RBIs. "I wasn't looking slider, but he
hung it up in the zone, and I recognized it
and hit It out."
Cassidy came on to face two hitters:
Doug Robbins, who singled to left, and
Paul Carey, who launched a towering shot
over the wall in right for his seventh
homer of the year to give Stanford a 6-5
lead.
Tony Harris took to the mound for ASU
and induced Jeff Saenger to pop up be
hind the mound, but when Harris backed
off to allow third baseman Bob
Dombrowski to make the catch,
Dombrowski bailed out at the last min
ute, the ball hit Harris in the chest, and
Saenger was at first with a single.
Witmeyer then drilled his homer well

out of the park to right field to make it 8-
5. and Frank Carey followed with a double
to left to chase Harris.
David Esquer greeted Scott Hutson
with a single to score Frank Carey, but
Hutson escaped the inning without fur
ther damage, trailing 9-5.
Stanford struck for three more runs In
the eighth when Sprague followed back
to-back triples by Ruben Amaro, who was
4-for-5 on the day, and Toi Cook with his
second homer of the day over the fence in
left.
Brian Keyser got the win for the Card
inal in relief of Jim Price despite surren
dering Mariucci's grand slam and pitch
ing only two-thirds of an inning. Price
went 5 1/3 innings, striking out eight, in
cluding the first four hitters he faced, but
loaded the bases and yielded to Keyser
with a 5-2 lead.
Steve Chitren came on in the seventh
and pitched three innings to earn his
sixth save. Chitren saved all three games
of the series.
Lee Plemel earned the win in Saturday's
3-2 battle. Witmeyer brought the Cardinal
back from a 2-0 deficit with a two-run
double in the fourth, and an infield chop
per by Robbins scored Esquer with the
winning run in the fifth. Esquer had
reached base after being hit by loser Matt
Shifflet and advanced to third on two
walks by Cassidy.
Friday saw Witmeyer go 3-for-4 with a
homer and three RBIs as Jack McDowell
struck out 13 in 7 2/3 innings to earn the
10-3 victory.
"That was his best game of the year,"
Marquess said of McDowell. "He's getting
better each time out, getting stronger and
throwing more pitches."

Either Rob Wassenaar or Keyser will get
the start today.

first baseman Ron Witmeyer, who had
started the month in a woeful slump. Wit
meyer came into the series hitting only
.129, but went 6-for-ll with two home
runs and seven RBIs to raise his average
to .173.
"We've always had a lot of confidence in
Ron," Marquess said. "He was hitting the
ball better than his average shows, hit
ting hard balls that were caught. It was
just a matter of time. He has a good

swing. Over Dead Week and finals week
we got a chance to work on a new stance
with him."
"They stuck with me all the way
through It." Witrneyer said. "I know if I
were a coach, I'm not sure I would've
stuck with me. They always kept their
confidence in me, working with me early
on some things."
Yesterday was a classic display of
Arizona State baseball: A lot of offense,
but a futile search for a pitcher to shut
the door. The Sun Devils took a 5-2 lead
on a grand slam by left fielder Steve
Mariucci in the top of the sixth inning,
but then watched helplessly as four
pitchers could not stop the Cardinal from
scoring seven runs in the bottom of the
inning.
ASU starter Mike Schwabe had settled
down after a shaky first inning that saw
Stanford take a 2-0 lead, retiring 15 of 16
hitters through the fifth. After surrender
ing Sprague's first homer, a line shot over
the soccer bleachers in left field, he left to
make way for David Cassidy.
"It was a slider up." said Sprague, who
leads the Cardinal with nine homers and
36 RBIs. "I wasn't looking slider, but he
hung it up in the zone, and I recognized it
and hit It out."
Cassidy came on to face two hitters:
Doug Robbins, who singled to left, and
Paul Carey, who launched a towering shot
over the wall in right for his seventh
homer of the year to give Stanford a 6-5
lead.
Tony Harris took to the mound for ASU
and induced Jeff Saenger to pop up be
hind the mound, but when Harris backed
off to allow third baseman Bob
Dombrowski to make the catch,
Dombrowski bailed out at the last min
ute, the ball hit Harris in the chest, and
Saenger was at first with a single.
Witmeyer then drilled his homer well

out of the park to right field to make it 8-
5. and Frank Carey followed with a double
to left to chase Harris.
David Esquer greeted Scott Hutson
with a single to score Frank Carey, but
Hutson escaped the inning without fur
ther damage, trailing 9-5.
Stanford struck for three more runs In
the eighth when Sprague followed back
to-back triples by Ruben Amaro, who was
4-for-5 on the day, and Toi Cook with his
second homer of the day over the fence in
left.
Brian Keyser got the win for the Card
inal in relief of Jim Price despite surren
dering Mariucci's grand slam and pitch
ing only two-thirds of an inning. Price
went 5 1/3 innings, striking out eight, in
cluding the first four hitters he faced, but
loaded the bases and yielded to Keyser
with a 5-2 lead.
Steve Chitren came on in the seventh
and pitched three innings to earn his
sixth save. Chitren saved all three games
of the series.
Lee Plemel earned the win in Saturday's
3-2 battle. Witmeyer brought the Cardinal
back from a 2-0 deficit with a two-run
double in the fourth, and an infield chop
per by Robbins scored Esquer with the
winning run in the fifth. Esquer had
reached base after being hit by loser Matt
Shifflet and advanced to third on two
walks by Cassidy.
Friday saw Witmeyer go 3-for-4 with a
homer and three RBIs as Jack McDowell
struck out 13 in 7 2/3 innings to earn the
10-3 victory.
"That was his best game of the year,"
Marquess said of McDowell. "He's getting
better each time out, getting stronger and
throwing more pitches."
Stanford hosts Nevada-Las Vegas today
at Sunken Diamond in a 2 p.m. start.
Either Rob Wassenaar or Keyser will get
the start today.

Second baseman Ed Sprague helped pace a 12-6 Cardinal triumph over Arizona
State yesterday. The sophomore hit a pair of two-run homers on his way to a five-RBI
performance.
The March to the pennant continues.
The Stanford Cardinal raised its record
in the month of March to a perfect 11-0
and moved into first place in the Pacific
10 Southern Division with a three-game
sweep over Arizona State this weekend at
Sunken Diamond. The Cardinal hasn't
lost since Feb. 28, and the 11-game win
ning streak is the longest since 1983.
Third baseman Ed Sprague hit a pair of
two-run homers to highlight a flve-RBI af
ternoon and power Stanford to a 12-6 vic
tory over ASU yesterday. Stanford won 3-2
Saturday and 10-3 Friday.
"You never know where you're going to
get coming off of finals," Stanford Coach
Mark Marquess said. "Obviously we've
been playing real well since finals." The
Cardinal has won all six games since the
two-week break for Dead Week and finals,
beating California 7-6 March 22, San
Jose State 5-3 March 23 and Hayward
State 14-3 March 24.
With the four wins in Six-Pac games
since finals. Stanford is now 8-2 in the
conference. That gives Stanford an .800
percentage, ahead of UCLA (11-4, .733),
but the Cardinal is a half-game behind
the second-place Bruins, who have played
five more games. Arizona State is in fifth
place at 4-8.
