INDIANAPOLIS - Records fell like
dominos at the NCAA women's swimming
meet, but when the dust from the wreckage
of the American and NCAA record books
had cleared, Texas once again stood tall
over the field.
The Longhorns compiled 648 and 1/2
points en route to their fourth-straight
NCAA title and withstood a comeback by
second-place Stanford, which ended at 631
and 1/2.
"We couldn't have been better," Stanford
Coach George Haines said. "I think they
swam with more desire that last day and a
half than any team I've ever seen."
The Cardinal comeback began with the
400-yard medley relay, the last event of the
second day of competition at the Indiana
University Natatorium. At that point. Stan
ford found itself 47 and 1/2 points down to
a Texas squad that had already won the
Ihree previous relays and had posted the
morning's fastest qualifying time in the 400
medley by nearly three seconds.
With Betsy Mitchell leading off in the
backstroke ahead of breaststroker Tracey
McFarlane, each of whom had set NCAA
records in winning their respective events
earlier that day. Texas appeared un
beatable.
However. Stanford boasted the runners
up to Mitchell and McFarlane in back
stroker Michelle Donahue and
breaststroker Susan Rapp. and the Card
inal found itself a mere length behind when

butterilier Jenna Johnson hit the pool for
the third leg.
Johnson brought the crowd to its feet
with a stunning swim as she made up most
of the deficit in the first 25 yards. By the
time she handed off to teammate Aimee
Berzins, Johnson had passed Texas' Jodi
Eyles.
Berzins found herself in a stroke-for
stroke dual with the Longhorns' lightning
fast Ann Drolson, who had earlier finished
second in the 50 freestyle, but Berzins
pulled away to bring the Cardinal home in
an American record-shattering time of
3:38.17.
"This victory means a lot," said an elated
Berzins of the relay, which turned out to be
one of seven American records and nine
NCAA marks set during the meet. "I heard
the crowd through Ihe water. 1 knew I could
not let them down. After following three of
the best racers in America, I wanted to hold
my own. My adrenaline was just pumping."
The win left Stanford 41 and 1/2 points
down heading into the last day, a slight im
provement over the first day's 42-point defi
cit. but more importantly gave ihe Cardinal
some much-needed momentum.
Stanford built on this throughout the
meet's last session and pulled to within 10
with two swimming events left, although
the gap was really six with the four points
the Cardinal was assured of picking up
from Texas in the yet-to-be-completed
three-meter diving competition.
However. Stanford would gel no closer as

Co-captain Susan Rapp, the "old lady" of the Stanford squad, didn't look old this weekend, as the fourth-year junior won
the 200 breaststroke and finished second in both the 100 breaststroke and individual medley at the NCAA women's swim
ming championships in Indianapolis.
