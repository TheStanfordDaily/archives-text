# Blazing finish powers swimmers to second
## 
### BRENDAN HEALEY Senior staff writer 
INDIANAPOLIS - Records fell like
dominos at the NCAA women's swimming
meet, but when the dust from the wreckage
of the American and NCAA record books
had cleared, Texas once again stood tall
over the field.
The Longhorns compiled 648 and 1/2
points en route to their fourth-straight
NCAA title and withstood a comeback by
second-place Stanford, which ended at 631
and 1/2.
"We couldn't have been better," Stanford
Coach George Haines said. "I think they
swam with more desire that last day and a
half than any team I've ever seen."
The Cardinal comeback began with the
400-yard medley relay, the last event of the
second day of competition at the Indiana
University Natatorium. At that point. Stan
ford found itself 47 and 1/2 points down to
a Texas squad that had already won the
Ihree previous relays and had posted the
morning's fastest qualifying time in the 400
medley by nearly three seconds.
With Betsy Mitchell leading off in the
backstroke ahead of breaststroker Tracey
McFarlane, each of whom had set NCAA
records in winning their respective events
earlier that day. Texas appeared un
beatable.
However. Stanford boasted the runners
up to Mitchell and McFarlane in back
stroker Michelle Donahue and
breaststroker Susan Rapp. and the Card
inal found itself a mere length behind when

butterilier Jenna Johnson hit the pool for
the third leg.
Johnson brought the crowd to its feet
with a stunning swim as she made up most
of the deficit in the first 25 yards. By the
time she handed off to teammate Aimee
Berzins, Johnson had passed Texas' Jodi
Eyles.
Berzins found herself in a stroke-for
stroke dual with the Longhorns' lightning
fast Ann Drolson, who had earlier finished
second in the 50 freestyle, but Berzins
pulled away to bring the Cardinal home in
an American record-shattering time of
3:38.17.
"This victory means a lot," said an elated
Berzins of the relay, which turned out to be
one of seven American records and nine
NCAA marks set during the meet. "I heard
the crowd through Ihe water. 1 knew I could
not let them down. After following three of
the best racers in America, I wanted to hold
my own. My adrenaline was just pumping."
The win left Stanford 41 and 1/2 points
down heading into the last day, a slight im
provement over the first day's 42-point defi
cit. but more importantly gave ihe Cardinal
some much-needed momentum.
Stanford built on this throughout the
meet's last session and pulled to within 10
with two swimming events left, although
the gap was really six with the four points
the Cardinal was assured of picking up
from Texas in the yet-to-be-completed
three-meter diving competition.

Co-captain Susan Rapp, the "old lady" of the Stanford squad, didn't look old this weekend, as the fourth-year junior won
the 200 breaststroke and finished second in both the 100 breaststroke and individual medley at the NCAA women's swim
ming championships in Indianapolis.
Texas fought back with a 2-5-10
finish in the 200 butterfly to vir
tually salt away the win.
The Cardinal's only chance
rested on a Texas disqualification
in the 400 freestyle relay, but the
Longhorns played it safe.
"One coach said to me. 'Hey
Richard, show some guts and go
for it.' " Texas Coach Richard
Quick said. "I said. 'No way,
they're going to shake hands with
each other before they go.' "
Stanford set another American
relay record in the event as an in
creasingly confident Berzlns once
again prevailed in a battle of
anchors, this time with Florida's
Carmen Cowart and Texas'
Mitchell, but it was not enough.
According to Texas Coach Rich

ard Quick. Stanford "showed a lot
of courage coming from that far
back." but Texas' depth, particu
larly in the freestyles. was simply
too much.
Stanford countered with talent
In the sprints as Johnson suc
cessfully defended her titles in
both the 50 and 100 freestyles and
Berzlns grabbed second in the
100.
Johnson also finished second in
the 100 butterfly behind Califor
nia s Mary T. Meagher. The race
resembled the pair's two other
meetings this season as Johnson
dolphined out to an early lead only
to be overtaken by Meagher in the
last 25 yards.
"I'm a little disappointed about
the fly," said Johnson, who
finished second In the race for the
individual high-point award be
hind Swimmer of the Meet
Mitchell. "This has happened so
so many times. I'm not sure why I

died this time. I'm a lot stronger
this year."
Nonetheless, Johnson was
pleased with the way she ended a
season In which she missed weeks
of training due to illness and
during which she "never felt really
zippy."
Rapp was also pleased with her
meet after winning the 200
breaststroke and finishing second
in the 100 breaststroke and 200
individual medley.
As a fourth-year junior, Rapp
has reached a point in her career
at which most other female swim
mers are ready to hang up their
goggles, but like a fine wine, the
Stanford co-captain has improved
with age.
"I did all my best times at this
meet," she said. "It's pretty excit
ing for me to be an old lady and do
that."
Rapp went to war with
McFarlane in the breaststrokes,

and the pair spilt their races.
McFarlane took the 100 In what
would have been an American
record but for the fact that
McFarlane Is a Canadian citizen,
while Rapp prevailed in a see-saw
200.
'I had very strong turns," said
Rapp, who barely missed the 2:10
mark Haines had confidently
predicted for her with an NCAA
record 2:11.93. "I think my stroke
Is a lot longer than most, in the
200 that helps me out."
The first day Rapp led the Card
inal's 200 IM contingent, which
garnered four places in the top
seven and five in the top 11. It was
one of the few Stanford high
lights, along with Johnson's vic
tory in the 50, on a day weighted
toward the freestyle events.
The Cardinal's second-day effort
was marked by near disaster out
of the pool and sore disappoint
ments In the pool, but also by

some strong swims by the Stan
ford breaststroke and backstroke
contingent.
The near-disaster was a scratch
sheet problem that would have
forced several Stanford swimmers
to compete In different events
than planned had it not been
cleared up.
In the pool. Stanford's Michelle
Griglione continued to struggle
through a sub-par meet as she
could only manage third in the
400 IM. an event she was expected
to win.
The Cardinal also failed to put a
swimmer in the finals of the 200
freestyle. It was one of only two
swimming events — the 500
freestyle was the other — in which
Stanford failed to put at least one
competitor in the top eight.
The Cardinal's breaststrokers
and backstrokers offset those dis
appointments. though. Rapp
paced a 2-6-10 finish In the 200

breaststroke. while Donahue
nipped teammate Jennifer Pok
luda for second in the 200 back
stroke, ahead of two other Stan
ford swimmers in the top 10.
This backstroke dominance was
repeated the last day when the
Cardinal swept third through
sixth places In the 100.
In the end, though. Texas'
firepower proved overwhelming. A
measure of the Longhorns'
strength can be found in the fact
that double Olympic gold medalist
Tiffany Cohen and four other
NCAA qualifiers didn't even make
the trip.
Still, many Cardinal faithful
took heart In the presence of seven
seniors on the Texas roster, and
none on Stanford's. As Rapp said:
"I'd love to get an NCAA ring. I
think everyone is going to be
hungry to win (next year), since
we were so close."

predicted for her with an NCAA
record 2:11.93. "I think my stroke
Is a lot longer than most, in the
200 that helps me out."
The first day Rapp led the Card
inal's 200 IM contingent, which
garnered four places in the top
seven and five in the top 11. It was
one of the few Stanford high
lights, along with Johnson's vic
tory in the 50, on a day weighted
toward the freestyle events.
The Cardinal's second-day effort
was marked by near disaster out
of the pool and sore disappoint
ments In the pool, but also by

some strong swims by the Stan
ford breaststroke and backstroke
contingent.
The near-disaster was a scratch
sheet problem that would have
forced several Stanford swimmers
to compete In different events
than planned had it not been
cleared up.
In the pool. Stanford's Michelle
Griglione continued to struggle
through a sub-par meet as she
could only manage third in the
400 IM. an event she was expected
to win.
The Cardinal also failed to put a
swimmer in the finals of the 200
freestyle. It was one of only two
swimming events — the 500
freestyle was the other — in which
Stanford failed to put at least one
competitor in the top eight.
The Cardinal's breaststrokers
and backstrokers offset those dis
appointments. though. Rapp
paced a 2-6-10 finish In the 200

breaststroke. while Donahue
nipped teammate Jennifer Pok
luda for second in the 200 back
stroke, ahead of two other Stan
ford swimmers in the top 10.
This backstroke dominance was
repeated the last day when the
Cardinal swept third through
sixth places In the 100.
In the end, though. Texas'
firepower proved overwhelming. A
measure of the Longhorns'
strength can be found in the fact
that double Olympic gold medalist
Tiffany Cohen and four other
NCAA qualifiers didn't even make
the trip.
Still, many Cardinal faithful
took heart In the presence of seven
seniors on the Texas roster, and
none on Stanford's. As Rapp said:
"I'd love to get an NCAA ring. I
think everyone is going to be
hungry to win (next year), since
we were so close."
INDIANAPOLIS - Records fell like
dominos at the NCAA women's swimming
meet, but when the dust from the wreckage
of the American and NCAA record books
had cleared, Texas once again stood tall
over the field.
The Longhorns compiled 648 and 1/2
points en route to their fourth-straight
NCAA title and withstood a comeback by
second-place Stanford, which ended at 631
and 1/2.
"We couldn't have been better," Stanford
Coach George Haines said. "I think they
swam with more desire that last day and a
half than any team I've ever seen."
The Cardinal comeback began with the
400-yard medley relay, the last event of the
second day of competition at the Indiana
University Natatorium. At that point. Stan
ford found itself 47 and 1/2 points down to
a Texas squad that had already won the
Ihree previous relays and had posted the
morning's fastest qualifying time in the 400
medley by nearly three seconds.
With Betsy Mitchell leading off in the
backstroke ahead of breaststroker Tracey
McFarlane, each of whom had set NCAA
records in winning their respective events
earlier that day. Texas appeared un
beatable.
However. Stanford boasted the runners
up to Mitchell and McFarlane in back
stroker Michelle Donahue and
breaststroker Susan Rapp. and the Card
inal found itself a mere length behind when

butterilier Jenna Johnson hit the pool for
the third leg.
Johnson brought the crowd to its feet
with a stunning swim as she made up most
of the deficit in the first 25 yards. By the
time she handed off to teammate Aimee
Berzins, Johnson had passed Texas' Jodi
Eyles.
Berzins found herself in a stroke-for
stroke dual with the Longhorns' lightning
fast Ann Drolson, who had earlier finished
second in the 50 freestyle, but Berzins
pulled away to bring the Cardinal home in
an American record-shattering time of
3:38.17.
"This victory means a lot," said an elated
Berzins of the relay, which turned out to be
one of seven American records and nine
NCAA marks set during the meet. "I heard
the crowd through Ihe water. 1 knew I could
not let them down. After following three of
the best racers in America, I wanted to hold
my own. My adrenaline was just pumping."
The win left Stanford 41 and 1/2 points
down heading into the last day, a slight im
provement over the first day's 42-point defi
cit. but more importantly gave ihe Cardinal
some much-needed momentum.
Stanford built on this throughout the
meet's last session and pulled to within 10

Co-captain Susan Rapp, the "old lady" of the Stanford squad, didn't look old this weekend, as the fourth-year junior won
the 200 breaststroke and finished second in both the 100 breaststroke and individual medley at the NCAA women's swim
ming championships in Indianapolis.
Texas fought back with a 2-5-10
finish in the 200 butterfly to vir
tually salt away the win.
The Cardinal's only chance
rested on a Texas disqualification
in the 400 freestyle relay, but the
Longhorns played it safe.
"One coach said to me. 'Hey
Richard, show some guts and go
for it.' " Texas Coach Richard
Quick said. "I said. 'No way,
they're going to shake hands with
each other before they go.' "
Stanford set another American
relay record in the event as an in
creasingly confident Berzlns once
again prevailed in a battle of
anchors, this time with Florida's
Carmen Cowart and Texas'
Mitchell, but it was not enough.
According to Texas Coach Rich

ard Quick. Stanford "showed a lot
of courage coming from that far
back." but Texas' depth, particu
larly in the freestyles. was simply
too much.
Stanford countered with talent
In the sprints as Johnson suc
cessfully defended her titles in
both the 50 and 100 freestyles and
Berzlns grabbed second in the
100.
Johnson also finished second in
the 100 butterfly behind Califor
nia s Mary T. Meagher. The race
resembled the pair's two other
meetings this season as Johnson
dolphined out to an early lead only
to be overtaken by Meagher in the
last 25 yards.
"I'm a little disappointed about
the fly," said Johnson, who
finished second In the race for the
individual high-point award be
hind Swimmer of the Meet
Mitchell. "This has happened so
so many times. I'm not sure why I

died this time. I'm a lot stronger
this year."
Nonetheless, Johnson was
pleased with the way she ended a
season In which she missed weeks
of training due to illness and
during which she "never felt really
zippy."
Rapp was also pleased with her
meet after winning the 200
breaststroke and finishing second
in the 100 breaststroke and 200
individual medley.
As a fourth-year junior, Rapp
has reached a point in her career
at which most other female swim
mers are ready to hang up their
goggles, but like a fine wine, the
Stanford co-captain has improved
with age.
"I did all my best times at this
meet," she said. "It's pretty excit
ing for me to be an old lady and do
that."
Rapp went to war with
McFarlane in the breaststrokes,

and the pair spilt their races.
McFarlane took the 100 In what
would have been an American
record but for the fact that
McFarlane Is a Canadian citizen,
while Rapp prevailed in a see-saw
200.
'I had very strong turns," said
Rapp, who barely missed the 2:10
