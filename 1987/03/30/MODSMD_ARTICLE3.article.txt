# Stanford makes electronics find

In the race to find uses for recently
discovered high-temperature supercon
ducting materials, Stanford researchers
have become the first to convert the ma
terial into a thin film and to create a
device called a tunnel junction — both
prerequisites for future electronic appli
cations.
Superconducting materials are ma
terials that offer no electrical resistance
and can create extremely powerful mag
netic fields.
Prof. Malcolm Beasley, chairman of
the Applied Physics Department, des
cribed the Stanford discovery as an
"existence proof," showing other scien
tists that a film can be created. The film

is important because, like a silicon
wafer, it is a form of the material that
can be used in electronics.
Beasley said the film may solve the
electronic "packaging problems" cur
rently plaguing supercomputer re
search. Packaging problems relate to
how "devices and chips are intercon
nected collectively." he said.
IBM recently gave up in its attempts to
build a superconducting supercomputer
using devices called Josephson junc
tions. The thin film produced at Stan
ford is a first step toward making
Josephson junctions with these materi
als, Applied Physics Prof. Theodore
Geballe told University News Service.
The Stanford breakthrough came
amid worldwide competition to find ap
plications for newly discovered super

conducting materials. It is a search that
led 3,000 superconductivity researchers
to attend a conference in New York City
March 18.
Until recently, superconducting ma
terials could only operate in liquid
helium, which has a boiling point of 4.2
degrees Kelvin. However, a new class of
superconducting materials, discovered
by J. Bednorz and A.K. Muller at the IBM
laboratory in Zurich, have supercon
ducting properties at up to 95 degrees
Kelvin and can therefore operate in liq
uid nitrogen.
"Some scientists say (the discovery of
high-temperature superconducting ma
terials) is the most important discovery
in the past 35 years," said Aharon
Kapltulnik, an assistant professor
In Applied Physics.
The higher temperatures allow
scientists to employ current su
perconductor technology more
easily, Beasley said.
Stanford Electrical Engineering
Prof. James Plummer has demon
strated that semiconductor cir
cuits can operate In liquid
nitrogen, Beasley added.
The possibilities of "hybrid
izing" superconductor technology
with semiconductor technology is
an unexplored region, Beasley
said.
Previously, no one had even con

templated combining the two
technologies, he said, but "now
you can ask the question."
Superconductors will provide
dramatic innovations in both
large and small scale technologies,
Kapltulnik said.
On the large scale, supercon
ducting materials could push
electric current over long dis
tances without any loss of power,
and their powerful magnetic prop
erties could result in such
scenarios as trains that levitate
over magnetic fields.
On the smaller scale — the field
In which the team of Stanford re
searchers has made Its greatest
Impact — superconductors will al
low much faster information pro
cessing than anything currently
In existence, Kapltulnik said.
