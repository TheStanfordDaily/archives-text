### CHRIS CRADER Staff writer 
MALIBU — Spring break is a
time for most students to head
south, looking for sun and fun.
The Stanford men's volleyball
team did just that, going south,
but coming up with two key wins
before losing a tough match to No.
2-ranked Pepperdine here Satur
day night.
The Waves took more than two
hours to earn a 12-15. 15-10, 15-
12. 16-14 win to run their record
to 18-5. The previous night Stan
ford beat No. 1 1 San Diego State
easily, 15-5, 16-14, 15-4. and
Wednesday the 7th-ranked Card
inal toppled No. 12 Cal-State
Northridge 13-15, 15-4. 15-10.
10-15. 15-6.
Stanford is now 16-9 on the
season, and 6-6 in Western Inter
collegiate Volleyball Association
play. The Cardinal is alone In fifth
place, and if It can stay there, it
will qualify for post-season play.
The Cardinal came out some
what sluggishly against
Northridge — its first game in 18
days — and fell behind early in
game one. The spikers were
unable to catch the Matadors
going down 15-13.
Game two was another storv. as

Stanford jumped out to a 6-0 lead
and cruised to a 15-4 win.
It was Northridge's turn to be
hot in the third game, as they flew
to a 9-2 advantage, but a 13-1
Stanford run gave the Cardinal a
2-1 lead in the match.
Game four belonged to the
Matadors all the way. setting the
stage for the deciding fifth game.
Stanford came out strong in
this one. though, and the
Matadors could not play with the
Cardinal. Despite CSUN's fircd-up
play — better than expected from
a 2-9 team — Stanford prevailed
by a 15-6 margin.
"I think it was a good win for us
against Northridge." said Stan
ford Head Coach Fred Sturm. "It
shows we need to work on some
things, though." as the CSUN
middle attack was very effective
even with Stanford blockers com
mitting against them.
Senior outside hitter Stephen
Blue led the way with 28 kills and
a .330 hitting percentage, and
freshman Kent Steffes added 25 at
a .275 clip. Defensively, middle
blockers Scott Fortune, a junior,
and freshman Dan Hanan
combined for 25 blocks, and Blue
had nine digs.
Two nights later at San Diego
State, the going was a little easier
for the Cardinal. The Aztecs
simply weren't talented enough,
and were only able to occupy Stan
ford for 67 minutes.
The Cardinal hit its only trouble
at 10-13 In the second game, but
some timely hitting by Blue,
Fortune and Hanan preserved the
shutout. A true indication of the
way the match went is the fact
that Stanford outhlt SDSU .423 to
.191 for the match.
For Stanford, junior John
McDermott had eight kills to go
with a .727 hitting percentage,
followed by Fortune (11 kills,
.471), Hanan (16, .400) and
Steffes (12, .381). Junior Brad
Nelson came off the bench to hit
1.000 on two kills, and California
transfer Jason McFarland played
in his first WIVA match wearing
cardinal and white after recover
ing from a stress fracture.
The Aztecs big gun. Bruk Van
deweghe, was held to 11 kills and
a .192 percentage, and their
second-best hitter, Bill Boul
lianne, was taken out in the
second game while hitting -.200.
"That was a good team effort,"
said Sturm. "Everyone played con
sistently for us, except a little in
the middle (of the match)."
The next night Pepperdine was
a much tougher obstacle. The
Waves are the two-time defending
national champions, and had a
loud home crowd advantage. An
other factor was scheduling. "We
played [Fiday night] in San Diego,"
said Steffes, "and less than 24
hours later, we play(ed) here (four
hours north)."
Pepperdine was without the
services of middle blocker Rob Kel
ler and setter Doug Rigg due to in
juries, but senior All-American
Troy Tanner filled in very capably
for Rigg. Tanner has set the last
three years for the Waves, leading
them to three straight national
finals and two titles. His hitting
was missed on the outside, but
the other Waves covered, putting
his sets down from all over the
court.
Tanner likes setting as well as
hitting, "as long as the passes are
there," he said. "It's fun for the
time being, but I'm looking for
ward to Dougie coming back." The

position switch didn't affect Tan
ner's play, though, as he had a
.563 hitting percentage, mostly off
of dumps, and seven solo blocks,
both match highs.
Ail-American middle blocker
Rob Scott hit through a Stanford
double block almost at will, tally
ing 27 kills and a .381 percentage,
while Matt Rigg and Randy
Bergstedt banged from the
outside, recording 23 and 16 kills,
respectively.
The Cardinal did outblock the
famed "Mallbu roofing company"
26-22, but almost every other
statistic favored the Waves, who
had more digs, more kills, fewer
errors and outhit Stanford .287 to
.142.
Fortune did have 11 blocks, 20
kills and a .289 percentage, all
team highs, but McDermott and
Steffes were the only other Stan
ford players who hit over .075.
The match started well, as the
Cardinal raced to 10-2 and 13-3
leads, but the Waves came roaring
back to 14-12 before a Blue kill
converted Stanford's sixth game
point.
In game two, Pepperdine forged
a 9-4 lead, only to see it shrink to
11-10 behind the setting of Steve
Modory. Modory, a senior, lost his
starting job to freshman Parker
Blackman earlier in the year, but
came off the bench many times
over the weekend to save games
and lead rallies. The Waves toug
hened up, though, holding out for
a 15-10 win.
Game three went back and
forth, with Stanford jumping
ahead at 11-10, but again Pep
perdine came through in the
clutch, scoring five quick points
while giving up only one to earn a
15-12 decision.
In game four, with the score tied
at three, the lights suddenly went
out in Firestone Fieldhouse,
causing a five-minute delay. Stan
ford used the break well, and
when play resumed went ahead 8-
4.
The teams then traded points to
13-11, when Pepperdine scored
three straight points. Stanford
held off two match points, and
managed to tie the score at 14, but
then Tanner and Rigg recorded
consecutive solo blocks to end the
match.
Tanner thought he knew why
the Waves were able to pull out the
tight games. "I think we're a better
team. When it comes down to the
last few points, I think the better

team usually wins."
Pepperdlne Coach Rod Wilde
was happy with his team's play.
"For us to go in and play a good,
steady match (considering the In
juries) . . . shows a lot for our
team heart." he said. "We refused
to let the ball fall."
Sturm agreed. "They out
scrambled us," he said. "They
were a little more aggressive than
we were."
Wilde felt Stanford also played
well. "They dug a lot of balls. There
were some great rallies. All the
games could have been turned

around real easily."
Sturm thought the fact Pep
perdlne has had so much success
lately was an additional factor.
"For Pepperdine at full strength
against us at full strength, Jimmy
the Greek would pick them, be
cause they're ranked higher than
we are and because of their
record. Tonight, Jimmy the Greek
would give the edge to Stanford. I
wondered which team we played,
the guys on the floor (or the
defending national champions).
We may have been trying to do too
much, instead of just trying to

beat the six guys on the floor."
Looking to the future, Steffes
said, "In the NCAAs we're going to
play Pepperdine again (if the
standings remain the same). We
have to get a lot better."
Stanford plays again Friday and
Saturday nights against Long
Beach State and CSUN,
respectively, at 7:30 in Roble Gym.
Two wins would clinch a playoff
berth for Stanford.
The next weekend, the Cardinal
closes its home season against
UCLA and USC, and regionals
begin April 23.
