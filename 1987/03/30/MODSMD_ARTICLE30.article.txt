hours to earn a 12-15. 15-10, 15-
12. 16-14 win to run their record
to 18-5. The previous night Stan
ford beat No. 1 1 San Diego State

Stanford is now 16-9 on the
season, and 6-6 in Western Inter
collegiate Volleyball Association
play. The Cardinal is alone In fifth
place, and if It can stay there, it
will qualify for post-season play.
The Cardinal came out some
what sluggishly against
Northridge — its first game in 18
days — and fell behind early in
game one. The spikers were
unable to catch the Matadors
going down 15-13.
Game two was another storv. as

and cruised to a 15-4 win.

Stanford run gave the Cardinal a
2-1 lead in the match.
Game four belonged to the
Matadors all the way. setting the
stage for the deciding fifth game.
Stanford came out strong in
this one. though, and the
Matadors could not play with the
Cardinal. Despite CSUN's fircd-up
play — better than expected from
a 2-9 team — Stanford prevailed
by a 15-6 margin.
"I think it was a good win for us
against Northridge." said Stan
ford Head Coach Fred Sturm. "It
shows we need to work on some
things, though." as the CSUN
middle attack was very effective
even with Stanford blockers com
mitting against them.
Senior outside hitter Stephen
Blue led the way with 28 kills and
a .330 hitting percentage, and
freshman Kent Steffes added 25 at
a .275 clip. Defensively, middle
blockers Scott Fortune, a junior,
and freshman Dan Hanan
combined for 25 blocks, and Blue
had nine digs.
