# Gash vaults to new school record
## 
### ERIK STEN Editorial staff 
With a field of hundreds —
including the likes of Ben
Plucknett, Brian Oldfield and
Wendy Brown — competing
Friday and Saturday in the
Stanford Holiday Inn Invita
tional. it could have been easy
to lose sight of the Cardinal.
In many events, the high
caliber fields tended to swallow
up the relatively inexperienced
collegiate competitors. A college
shot putter has been compet
ing for maybe eight or nine
years. Oldfield is 41 years old.
Plucknett 33.
With the older world-class
competitors on hand, the spot
light wasn't on Stanford. None
theless. a couple of the Card
inal squad emerged from the
shadows and captured the
crowd s attention.
Jumping in Saturday's open
pole vault. Stanford's John
Gash vaulted to a win and his
second school record of the
season at 17-2 and 1/4. A
month earlier in San Jose.
Gash had set the school record
at 17-0.
For the women's team.
Gash's win was mirrored by
high jumper Lisa Bernhagen.
