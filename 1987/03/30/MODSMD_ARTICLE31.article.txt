## 
### ERIK STEN Editorial staff 
With a field of hundreds —
including the likes of Ben
Plucknett, Brian Oldfield and
Wendy Brown — competing
Friday and Saturday in the
Stanford Holiday Inn Invita
tional. it could have been easy
to lose sight of the Cardinal.
In many events, the high
caliber fields tended to swallow
up the relatively inexperienced
collegiate competitors. A college
shot putter has been compet
ing for maybe eight or nine
years. Oldfield is 41 years old.
Plucknett 33.
With the older world-class
competitors on hand, the spot
light wasn't on Stanford. None
theless. a couple of the Card
inal squad emerged from the
shadows and captured the
crowd s attention.
Jumping in Saturday's open
pole vault. Stanford's John
Gash vaulted to a win and his
second school record of the
season at 17-2 and 1/4. A
month earlier in San Jose.
Gash had set the school record
at 17-0.
For the women's team.
Gash's win was mirrored by

Bernhagen won easily at 6-0 and
1/2. The junior then Just missed
at 6-2 as her heel nicked the bar.
"It was good enough to win," a
satisfied Bernhagen said of her
performance.
Other highlights for the Card
inal came In two almost opposite
events, the sprint and distance
medley relays, as both groups
came in second. Running In the
shorter contest the Cardinal's
team of Brian Small. James
Browne, Chris Barlow and Gus
Envela turned in a season-best
time of 41.18.
If the foursome continues to im
prove as It has so far this season,
Stanford's Image as a poor sprint
ing school may begin to change.
"When Gus took that baton in first
place In that homestretch, we
woke up a lot of people who had
been sleeping," Asst. Coach Scott
Chlsam said. "Sprinting is com
ing back at Stanford."
Distance running has always
been strong at Stanford and the
distance medley team of Bill
Crowley, Envela. Christian Skoog

intact. After taking the baton in
seventh, Skoog ran a half mile
that moved the team into fourth.
With Arizona safely out of reach
in first, Olesen waited on the
shoulder of third-place Kentucky.
He bided his time until the final
back turn, when with 300 yards to
go he exploded past Kentucky and

kick reminiscent of last year's na
tional fourth-place finisher in the
1500 meters for Stanford, Jeff At
