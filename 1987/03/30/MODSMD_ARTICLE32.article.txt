### 
NEW ORLEANS (AP) - On Mon
day night, Hollywood's Hoosiers
go for the Oscars while Indiana's
version reaches for the NCAA bas
ketball championship.
Syracuse is the last hurdle for
Coach Bob Knight's team after In
diana defeated Nevada-Las Vegas
97-93 and the Orangemen
downed Providence 77-63 in Sat
urday's semifinals.
"I think Syracuse is as good a
team as there is in the country."
Knight said. "Considering the
regional they came out of and the
way they've played, they're prob
ably right where they ought to be."
Syracuse was seeded No. 2 in
the East and reached the Final
Four by beating Georgia South
ern, Western Kentucky. Florida
and the region's No. 1 seed. North

Carolina. Indiana carried the No.
1 seed in the Midwest Region and
beat Fairfield. Auburn. Duke and
LSU on the road to New Orleans
and the Final Four.
Syracuse is basically a seven
man team, depending heavily on
their five starters â€” guards Sher
man Douglas and Greg Monroe,
forwards Howard Triche and Der
rick Coleman and center Rony
Seikaly. Orangemen Coach Jim
Boeheim will substitute Stephen
Thompson in the'backcourt and
Derk Brower up front but rarely
goes deeper than that.
Douglas' defensive job on Billy
Donovan was a key element of the
Providence victory and he could
draw the assignment on Indiana
Ail-American Steve Alford. who
scored 33 against UNLV.

Monroe is Syracuse's three
point specialist. He hit three of the
home run shots against Provi
dence and had to be watching
when UNLV's Freddie Banks lit it
up with 10 against Indiana.
Coleman, a 6-foot-9 freshman,
and Seikaly. a 6-10 junior, give
the Orangemen a twin-tower look
underneath. Both have played well
throughout the tournament,
asserting themselves and improv
ing what had been a spotty
rebounding game for Syracuse.
Indiana's bench plays a more
significant role for the Hoosiers
behind starters Alford and Keith
Smart at guard. Rick Calloway
and Daryl Thomas at forward and
Dean Garrett at center. The
Hoosiers got important contribu
tions from reserves Joe Hillman

and Steve Eyl, who hit a combined
6-for-7 from the floor against
UNLV.
Syracuse comes into the title
game at 31-6 with five of their
losses to Big East Conference
rivals, three of them to George
town. Indiana is 29-4, including
two victories over Big Ten rival Mi
chigan, the only non-Big East
team to beat Syracuse.
The Orangemen will be playing
for the national championship for
the first time, although Boeheim
came into the season with a .749
winning percentage, fifth highest
among all active coaches.
Knight previously won NCAA
titles in 1976 and 1981 and has a
career head coaching record of
467-169 for 22 years, 365-119 in
16 years at Indiana.
