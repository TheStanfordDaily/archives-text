# Cardinal fencers finish season in South Bend
## 
### CHRIS CRADER Staff writer 
If "Against All Odds" was
playing on any flights between the
Bay Area and South Bend, Ind.,
lately, nothing could have been
more appropriate. The Stanford
men's and women's fencing teams
sent their qualifiers to the nation
als during finals week, and came
back with some good results.
The three days away wrought
havoc with testing schedules and
finals week probably served as a
big distraction, but all of the Card
inal's five fencers survived the
first round, and the women's team
just missed a top-10 finish.
For the women, senior captain
Holly Taylor finished her career
with a 12th place showing. She
finished 22nd as a sophomore and
21st as a junior and ended up

179-28 for her career at the Farm.
She also won the Western Inter
collegiate title and clinched the
western team title this year, both
with come-from-behind victories
over the region's No. 2 fencer,
Suzanne Lahara of Santa Cruz.
Senior Alyson Yarus competed
at the nationals for her first time
this year, by virtue of her third
place finish at regionals, and
placed 23rd in the 30-person field.
Her performance was more im
pressive than it may seem because
most eastern fencers have high
school fencing experience, but
Yarus came straight out of a
physical education class freshman
year.
Taylor was 55-5 during the reg
ular season this year while Yarus
was 40-19.
On the men's side, Stanford had
three fencers qualify. Senior Larry

Murk finished third at the
regionals in epee and went on to a
17th place finish nationally. He
needed a win from an Air Force
fencer to reach the final 16, but
lost. Murk did show a large im
provement over his 29th place
NCAA showing last year, though.
Murk went 43-9 this year as
Stanford's No. 1 epee fencer, and
ends his career as a Cardinal with
a 150-47 mark.
In sabre, Stanford had two
qualifiers, senior Steve Levitan
and junior Mike Cramer. Cramer
took second and Levitan third at
the regionals, but Levitan placed
ahead of Cramer in the nationals,
taking 13th place to his
teammate's 21st. Long Beach's
Tarik Yassir, regional sabre cham
pion, scored the West's highest
placing with a fourth.

Three members of Stanford's fencing team qualifed for the nationals and all three managed to wind up in
the nation's top 21. Senior Larry Murk finished 17th in epee and Steve Levitan and Mike Cramer finished
13th and 21st in sabre competition.
