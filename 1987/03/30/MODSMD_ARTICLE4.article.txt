# Fac Sen chairmen assail library plans
## 
### CLAY CALVERT Staff writer 
Twelve former chairs of the Faculty Sen
ate last week issued a statement recom
mending that the Board of Trustees con
sider an alternative to the plan now in place
for construction of the Ronald Reagan Pres
idential Library.
The statement, which was circulated to
members of the senate and will likely be dis
cussed in Thursday's senate meeting, calls
for "a significantly smaller and less visible
structure whose primary functions clearly
would be scholarly research and seminar
instruction."
While acknowledging the value of the
Reagan Library as an academic resource,
the statement's signers argue that the
existing plan is "simply too large and the ex
pected level of usage too high" for the pro
posed Junipero Serra site in the foothills
overlooking the University.
If the present plan, approved by the trus
tees in February 1985, is not scaled down to
serve solely as a center for scholarly re
search and teaching, the 12 signers recom
mend that the Reagan Library "be located

farther from the center of the campus and
closer to major roads."
David Abernethy, professor of political
science and one of the statement's signers,
said faculty input on the Reagan Library
has been "very small" and needs to in
crease.
"I think the faculty are an important con
stituent (of the University) since the library
has been justified on academic grounds,"
Abernethy said.
The statement cites "growing faculty un
easiness" over the proposed structure and
calls faculty input "minimal" in the plan
ning process of the Reagan Library.
History Prof. Gordon Craig, who also
signed the statement, said the statement is
important in terms of both its timing and
content.
"This may be the last time the Faculty
Senate is consulted on this," Craig said,
noting that faculty interest in the Reagan
Library seems to be increasing.
"I think this is an issue that has crept up
on a lot of people because they haven't
thought the whole thing
through," Craig said.
Communication Prof. Elie Abel,
another former senate chair who
signed the statement, said "there
is obviously a powerful feeling on
campus that something has gone
wrong with the planning of the
Reagan center."

The senate is scheduled to dis
cuss library plans at Thursday's
meeting.
Kenneth Arrow, chair of the
senate, said the statement would
likely "form a basis of discussion"
on the Reagan Library, although
he noted that "no notice has been
given that a motion will be put for
ward."
Prior notice of a motion,
however, is not needed for discus
sion at the meeting, Arrow said.
The senate, while lacking the

power to stop construction of the
Reagan Library, can make recom
mendations to the trustees.
Charles Palm, liaison for the
Reagan Presidential Foundation
and the head librarian and ar
chivist at the Hoover Institution,
called the proposal "dis
appointing" in that it has the po
tential to delay construction of the
Reagan Library.
"I don't know why it keeps com
ing back after all the approvals
have been made," Palm said,

noting that the proposed site was
approved by the trustees and of
fered to President Reagan in
February 1985.
Palm said the proposed site was
also approved by the University's
Reagan Library Planning Commit
tee, the University Committee on
Land, Buildings and Development
and the Santa Clara County Plan
ning Commission.
"All of the approvals were made
with full knowledge of the pro
gram and the design." Palm said.
