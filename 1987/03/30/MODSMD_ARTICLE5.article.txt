# Diver wins injunction
## 
### MARCUS MABRY Senior staff writer 
Calling the NCAA's mandatory drug test
ing program "relatively unsophisticated
and overbroad," Santa Clara Superior
Court Judge Peter Stone granted a prelimi
nary injunction on March 11 supporting
Stanford diver Simone Levant's refusal to
submit to testing.
"The least physically, emotionally or con
stitutionally intrusive methods to ac
complish the NCAA's laudable goals have
barely been considered, much less proposed
and implemented,'' he said.
LeVant, captain of the Stanford women's
diving team, has been battling the NCAA
since October, when she refused to sign a
consent form agreeing to random drug test
ing at the NCAA championships.
The injunction would have allowed
LeVant to compete in the women's col
legiate diving finals on March 19-21 with
out taking a urine test. However, at a
regional meet held March 12-14 at Arizona

State University, LeVant failed to qualify for
the nationals.
Because LeVant is a graduating senior
who will never again be eligible to compete
in NCAA diving championships, there is a
chance that her case will be declared moot,
according to Law Prof. Jack Friedenthal,
Stanford's faculty athletic representative to
the NCAA and the Pacific 10 Conference.
But because the case sets an important
precedent, and because another athlete,
Stanford soccer player Jennifer Hill, has
joined Levant's suit, this declaration is
unlikely, he said.
The ruling, based on the right to privacy
guaranteed by the California state constitu
tion. will not force the NCAA to abandon its
drug-testing program, Friedenthal said.
"They (the NCAA) are not going to lay
down and die because one trial judge in Cal
ifornia said it isn't right," he said.
NCAA attorney Richard Archer, of the
San Francisco firm of Archer and Hanson,
said after the hearing that this
ruling will not mean an end to
NCAA drug testing.
He pointed out that the decision
was based on the constitution of
California and will not apply to
other states.

But Robert Van Nest of Keker
and Brockett, one of the attorneys
who argued Levant's case, said,
"We hope and believe that today is
the beginning of the end of drug
testing in college sports."
According to Friedenthal, the
next step in the case will probably
be a trial in which the judge will
decide whether the temporary in
junction will become permanent.
By ruling in LeVant's favor at

the preliminary hearing, "(Judge
Stone) said 'I think Simone will
win at the trial,' " he said.
He went on to say, however, that
even if the case goes to full trial,
any final ruling will only affect Cal
ifornia schools. Because the
ruling would be based on rights
guaranteed in the state constitu
tion, the NCAA would be able to
appeal the case on the grounds
that it governs collegiate athletics

throughout the nation, not just in
this state.
"The point is we're a long way
from any resolution," Friedenthal
said.
Stanford has opposed the man
datory drug testing program since
it was first proposed by the NCAA,
but has complied with its
guidelines once the program went
into effect.
