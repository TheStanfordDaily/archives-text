# Johnson to appeal ruling
## 
### JAY FRY Staff writer

Clifford Johnson will be filing a
motion in U.S. District Court
today to appeal the March 18 dis
missal of his suit claiming the
Defense Department's nuclear
defense policy is unconstitutional.
Johnson's motion is the latest
step in his three-year-old suit
claiming that the Pentagon un
constitutionally relegates control
of the United States' launch-on
warning capability (LOWC)
missile defense to "error-prone"
computers.
Johnson, a manager of capacity
planning in the Office of Informa
tion Technology Services, first
filed suit against the Defense De
partment in February 1984.
The latest motion is in response

to U.S. District Judge Spencer
Williams' dismissal of the suit
March 18. Judge Williams said
that the issue raised was political
in nature, and therefore "not a le
gal matter," said Johnson.
"That argument is fallacious.
Constitutionality is a legal ques
tion. A decision would only decide
its (LOWC) legality" and would not
affect political decisions. Johnson
said.
The motion Johnson is filing
today is in reaction to arguments
made on behalf of the Defense De
partment at the March 18
hearing. At the hearing, according
to the motion, the Defense Depart
ment claimed that existing con
gressional appropriations legit
imize the allegedly computer
controlled LOWC.
