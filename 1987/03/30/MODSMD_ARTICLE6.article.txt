# Johnson to appeal ruling
## 
### JAY FRY Staff writer 
Stanford computer scientist
Clifford Johnson will be filing a
motion in U.S. District Court
today to appeal the March 18 dis
missal of his suit claiming the
Defense Department's nuclear
defense policy is unconstitutional.
Johnson's motion is the latest
step in his three-year-old suit
claiming that the Pentagon un
constitutionally relegates control
of the United States' launch-on
warning capability (LOWC)
missile defense to "error-prone"
computers.
Johnson, a manager of capacity
planning in the Office of Informa
tion Technology Services, first
filed suit against the Defense De
partment in February 1984.
The latest motion is in response

to U.S. District Judge Spencer
Williams' dismissal of the suit
March 18. Judge Williams said
that the issue raised was political
in nature, and therefore "not a le
gal matter," said Johnson.
"That argument is fallacious.
Constitutionality is a legal ques
tion. A decision would only decide
its (LOWC) legality" and would not
affect political decisions. Johnson
said.
The motion Johnson is filing
today is in reaction to arguments
made on behalf of the Defense De
partment at the March 18
hearing. At the hearing, according
to the motion, the Defense Depart
ment claimed that existing con
gressional appropriations legit
imize the allegedly computer
controlled LOWC.

Will file appeal
Johnson, however, contends
that the congressional authoriza
tion does not exist, citing sections
of the applicable defense authori
zation bill, the Congressional
Record, the War Powers Act and
the Atomic Energy Act. He claims
that because his case was dis
missed on the assumption that
Congress had authorized LOWC,
his dismissal should be set aside.
Johnson said that while the mo
tion may not be successful when it
Is heard June 3, it will help to
legitimize his next step — an ap
peal to the 9th Circuit Court of Ap
peals.
"It's a genuine motion." said

Johnson. "I believe the arguments
should change the mind of any
reasonable judge. Nevertheless, I
must be realistic. It (the motion)
gives a very good record for ap
peal."
Even though the case has been
dismissed three times, Johnson Is
optimistic about his chances for
winning in the Court of Appeals.
"In the Appeals Court we got a very
good hearing," he said. "If they
stand by what they did before, it
will be a fair deal."
The original suit charged that
the threat of a computer
controlled LOWC violated the con
stitutional powers of Congress to
declare war and the president to
act as commander-in-chief, said
Johnson. The district court dis
missed the suit.
