This is the last article in a
three-part series on East Palo
Alto.

Less than three miles from
Stanford's idyllic campus of
sandstone and Rodin sculpture,
on the other side of U.S. 101.
lies the city of East Palo Alto. It
is a community beset by high
unemployment, deficient state
and federal economic aid. and a
reputation as a marketplace for
illegal drugs.
Despite such difficulties,
however, civic leaders in East
Palo Alto maintain a guarded op
timism about their city's future.
East Palo Alto was incor
porated as a city on July 1.

1983. Before its incorporation,
it was governed by San Mateo
County and identified only as
San Mateo County service dis
trict five. Lacking representa
tion in county government, East
Palo Altans had no say in county
decisions that affected their
community.
Because of this. East Palo Al
tans were unable to stop the
county's transfer of land from
their district to the neighboring
cities of Menlo Park and Palo
Alto. Palo Alto airport, for exam
ple. sits on land that once
belonged to district five.
"Menlo Park and Palo Alto
raped us of a lot of land." said
Barbara Mouton, the mayor of
East Palo Alto."The county was
making decisions without
giving due consideration to the

people who live here (in East
Palo Alto)."
According to Mouton, incor
poration stopped such abuses
and put control of East Palo
Alto's future into the hands of
its residents. Mouton, elected
mayor in 1983, governs East
Palo Alto together with an
elected five-member city council.
But while empowered to gov
ern themselves, the people of
East Palo Alto confront stagger
ing problems. The unemploy
ment rate in East Palo Alto is
12.8 percent, according to
Virgus Streets, the city's direc
tor of economic development. By
comparison, the national unem
ployment rate is lower than 10
percent.
