# E. Palo Alto: Poverty next door
## 
### JOHN POLLACK Senior staff writer 
This is the last article in a
three-part series on East Palo
Alto.

Less than three miles from
Stanford's idyllic campus of
sandstone and Rodin sculpture,
on the other side of U.S. 101.
lies the city of East Palo Alto. It
is a community beset by high
unemployment, deficient state
and federal economic aid. and a
reputation as a marketplace for
illegal drugs.
Despite such difficulties,
however, civic leaders in East
Palo Alto maintain a guarded op
timism about their city's future.
East Palo Alto was incor
porated as a city on July 1.

1983. Before its incorporation,
it was governed by San Mateo
County and identified only as
San Mateo County service dis
trict five. Lacking representa
tion in county government, East
Palo Altans had no say in county
decisions that affected their
community.
Because of this. East Palo Al
tans were unable to stop the
county's transfer of land from
their district to the neighboring
cities of Menlo Park and Palo
Alto. Palo Alto airport, for exam
ple. sits on land that once
belonged to district five.
"Menlo Park and Palo Alto
raped us of a lot of land." said
Barbara Mouton, the mayor of
East Palo Alto."The county was
making decisions without
giving due consideration to the

people who live here (in East
Palo Alto)."
According to Mouton, incor
poration stopped such abuses
and put control of East Palo
Alto's future into the hands of
its residents. Mouton, elected
mayor in 1983, governs East
Palo Alto together with an
elected five-member city council.
But while empowered to gov
ern themselves, the people of
East Palo Alto confront stagger
ing problems. The unemploy
ment rate in East Palo Alto is
12.8 percent, according to
Virgus Streets, the city's direc
tor of economic development. By
comparison, the national unem
ployment rate is lower than 10
percent.
And if the unemployment rate is
calculated to include discouraged
workers, Streets added, the figure
rises to 14.9 percent. Discouraged
workers are those who have been
unemployed for six months or
longer and have consequently
given up trying to find a job.
"We're a pocket of poverty in a
wealthy county," he said.
But Streets said that instead of
benefiting from its location
among relatively wealthy neigh
bors, East Palo Alto is hurt by it.
He explained that the county's
overall wealth throws off the U.S.
census data that is used to deter
mine the city's eligibility for state
and federal aid. As a result, the
data gathered in the 1980 census
"does not reflect East Palo Alto's
true economic distress." Streets
said.
Streets said that East Palo Alto
is currently attempting to prove
its eligibility for economic aid
from both the state and federal
governments.
"We have to diligently conduct
our own surveys" in order to dem
onstrate East Palo Alto's eligibility
for aid, he said.
East Palo Alto, if it can establish
its eligibility for state aid, might
be designated as an enterprise
zone by the State Department of
Commerce. An enterprise zone is
an economically depressed area —
specially designated by the state
— that attracts new businesses by
providing economic incentives
such as low interest loans or tax

breaks in exchange for the busi
ness' locating there and hiring
local labor.
One local industry is already
thriving in East Palo Alto without
government aid — the traffic in il
legal drugs.
"This place became known all
over California as a marketplace"
for illegal drugs, according to East
Palo Alto Police Chief Dan Nelson.
According to Nelson, the drug
trade cuts across most ethnic and
age barriers, noting that specific
drugs are characteristically dealt
by certain ethnic groups. He said
that, in the past, it was not un
common to find 12-year-old
children selling marijuana on
street corners.
But East Palo Alto's reputation
is changing. Nelson said. He cited
recent sting operations and close
cooperation with the San Mateo
County Narcotics Task Force as
factors in this change.
East Palo Alto police are specifi
cally targeting the heroin and
crack trades, according to Nelson.
"The word goes out" about the
crackdown, he said, and the
"buyers stay away."
By curbing or even eliminating
the drug trade. Nelson hopes to
reduce the amount of drug-related
crime, such as burglary, in the
area.
But despite his efforts to cripple
the drug trade. Nelson acknowl
edged that it is an uphill fight. If
the police crack down in one area,
'the problem will resurface" some
where else, Nelson said.
"Where it (drug trade) pops up,
you're going to crack down on it,"
he said, noting that the drug trade
in East Palo Alto will be eliminated
"little by little."

Drug education is another facet
of East Palo Alto's war on drugs.
The police have organized a Police
Activities League (PAL) both to ed
ucate children about the dangers
of drugs and to encourage them to
pursue activities more con
structive than drug dealing.
Community churches have also
been enlisted in the drug educa
tion effort. Nelson said.
In addition to economic develop
ment and law enforcement efforts.
East Palo Alto civic leaders are
working to revitalize their school
system.
Superintendent of Schools
Charlie Mae Knight has brought
vigor and enthusiasm to the
Ravenswood School District,
which has been plagued by years
of poor test scores and low morale.
Encompassing all of East Palo
Alto and the eastern section of
Menlo Park, the Ravenswood
School District educates 3,300
children from kindergarten
through eighth grade. Graduates
of the Ravenswood School District
attend Sequoia High School in
Redwood City.
According to Knight, the
Ravenswood district's 75 percent
middle school graduation rate is
"excellent" when compared to that
of past years.
Knight suggested several
reasons for this improvement."We
require parental involvement" in
the educational process, said
Knight, noting that parents now
attend regular meetings concern
ing their children's educational
progress. In addition, many par
ents participate in formulating
the budget for the Ravenswood
district.
The Tinsley desegregation case

has also had a big impact on the
quality of education available to
children in East Palo Alto, accord
ing to Knight. Under this 1985
California Supreme Court ruling,
parents can send their children to
any of nine different school dis
tricts in San Mateo county. This
allows parents to avoid poor.
se gregated schools that might not
provide their child with an ade
quate education.

'We're a pocket
of poverty in a
wealthy county.'
— Virgus Streets

Before the Tinsley ruling, other
school districts could deny a child
entrance into their system.
By most estimates. Knight's ef
forts in the district and the
Tinsley ruling have significantly
brightened the educational
prospects for children in East Palo
Alto.
Looking to their city's future,
Mayor Mouton and other leaders
maintain a guarded optimism.
Mouton said that among other
things, East Palo Alto's location at
the mouth of Silicon Valley and its
proximity to large centers of trade
and major universities will inevit
ably attract developers to her city.
She also praised her fellow resi
dents. "Our strongest aspect(s)
are our human resources, the
people who live here," she said.
