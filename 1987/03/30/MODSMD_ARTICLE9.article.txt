Thatcher visits the Soviet Union
ZAGORSK, Soviet Union — British Prime Minister Margaret
Thatcher waded into crowds of amazed and curious Soviet
citizens yesterday, mixing with shoppers in a crowded Moscow su
permarket, visiting two families In their homes and lighting a
candle for peace In a Russian Orthodox Church.
The extent of her contact with ordinary citizens was considered
virtually unprecedented for a visiting Western leader and seemed
to underscore the sense of change currently under way in the So
viet Union.
Mrs. Thatcher was on the first full day of a planned five-day visit
to the Soviet Union. She is scheduled to hold private talks with
Kremlin leader Mikhail Gorbachev this morning and expand them
to include other officials from both countries later In the after
noon — talks that are expected to dwell on such major East-West
Issues as arms control.
But yesterday, to the consternation of plainclothes KGB secur
ity men assigned to her trip, Mrs. Thatcher spent much of her
time pressing the flesh in a style more evocative of a Western-style
politician during an election campaign than a visiting dignitary in
a Communist country.
At the entrance to the famous St. Serglus Monastery here. Mrs.
Thatcher momentarily stunned Soviet security guards by sud
denly veering away from the entrance and mingling with a crowd
of onlookers.
As she smiled and shook hands with startled Russians, several
plainclothes security men surfaced from within the crowd to give
her room to move.
Soviet experimental elections
MOSCOW — Elections featuring several candidates and billed
as experimental will be held in select districts throughout the
country on June 21, the Soviet news agency Tass announced yes
terday. The move will give voters a choice of candidates on a wide
scale for the first time In Soviet history.
At certain polling places in 15 Soviet republics and autonomous
regions, voters will have a choice of candidates for posts on local
governing councils and forjudges on district courts, Tass said.
The experiment, if adopted generally, could increase the impor
tance of elections, which until now have been limited to one candi
date. Voting, nevertheless. Is compulsory.
Tass said the legislatures of the republics made the decision to
hold the competitive elections "by way of an experiment."
The Russian-language Tass release, carried on the front page of
the official Communist Party newspaper Pravda, did not Indicate
how many separate contests would be involved. Western
diplomats say that at least 144 different seats will be affected.
Hussein considering visit to U.S.
AMMAN, Jordan — Jordan Is sending two top officials to Wash
ington next week to discuss whether a visit by King Hussein
would succeed in making progress toward an international peace
conference on the Middle East, a senior Jordanian official said
yesterday.
Jordanian Prime Minister Zeid Rlfai and Foreign Minister
Taher Masri will go to Washington April 5, the official said.
Such a visit by Hussein would represent a sharp change in the
Arab leader's attitude. Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak and
Hussein, two of the United States' closest Arab allies, were invited
last December and January, respectively, to visit Washington. But
both turned down the invitations at the time, in large part be
cause of anger over the Reagan administration's sale of arms to
Iran.
Jordan and Egypt, both concerned about Islamic extremism,
are two of Iraq's most active supporters in its war with Iran.
Indicted Israeli officer quits post
JERUSALEM — The Israeli air force officer who was indicted in
the United States last month as a conspirator in the Jonathan Jay
Pollard spy scandal resigned his prestigious command of the
country's second-largest air base here yesterday.
The surprise action came just 30 days after Col. Aviem Sella, a
much-decorated pilot, was put in charge of the Tel Nof base in a
move that angered the Reagan administration and raised doubts
in the United States over Israel's sincerity in apologizing for the
Pollard affair.
Sella said that his decision was "personal and Independently
made" and that it was based on "the deterioration In Israel/U.S.
relations and my concern for the future of ties between the two
countries and for relations with American Jewry."
While his resignation deals with one of the principal irritants af
flicting U.S./Israeli relations as a result of the Pollard affair, it is
not expected to Influence two ongoing Israeli investigations Into
the case.
Rehnquist court: A shift to the left
WASHINGTON — By elevating staunch conservative William
Rehnquist to be chief justice last year, the Reagan administration
hoped to tilt the Supreme Court toward the right.
But instead, the first term of the "Rehnquist court" has seen a
pronounced shift to the left. The court's liberal leader, 80-year-old
William Brennan, has put together a solid majority in a series of
hotly contested cases.
In the view of Harvard University professor Lawrence Tribe, this
is not the Rehnquist court at all. "It is more appropriate," he said,
"to say this is the Brennan court."
Last year. Brennan and the liberal side prevailed in only 20 of
the 69 cases with a libcral-versus-conservative split. So far in this
term, however, Brennan's faction has won 16 of the 26 divided
cases.
And when the issue has been civil rights for blacks, women,
handicapped persons or aliens. Brennan has been on the winning
side every time. That has given him the authority to determine
which justice should write the opinion, and he has frequently cho
sen himself.
Only In criminal law and In cases of relatively little legal signifi
cance has Rehnquist been able to forge a conservative consensus.
Pope drawn into propaganda war
SANTIAGO, Chile — As he begins a new pilgrim's Odyssey to
South America. Pope John Paul II has become a political football,
a white-robed man for all passions, in a gritty propaganda war
here between the government of President Augusto Pinochet and
his opponents.
The Roman Catholic Church In Chile, the most forthright and
credible defender of human rights in a repressive dictatorship,
awaits the pope as a "messenger of life." In a government view,
though, he is the "messenger of peace." Each side reads its own
slogan its own way.
Joined by fellow government foes ranging from the conservative
right to the violent Marxist left, the church portrays John Paul as
a figure whose preoccupation is for human dignity and economic
and social well being, basic rights of life that the opposition says
Pinochet has trampled.
Unable themselves to shake the stiff-necked general's grip or. to
short circuit his preparations to remain in office for another de
cade. opposition forces somewhat forlornly hope the pope will
achieve what they themselves have failed to accomplish during 13
years of dictatorship.

Thatcher visits the Soviet Union
ZAGORSK, Soviet Union — British Prime Minister Margaret
Thatcher waded into crowds of amazed and curious Soviet
citizens yesterday, mixing with shoppers in a crowded Moscow su
permarket, visiting two families In their homes and lighting a
candle for peace In a Russian Orthodox Church.
The extent of her contact with ordinary citizens was considered
virtually unprecedented for a visiting Western leader and seemed
to underscore the sense of change currently under way in the So
viet Union.
Mrs. Thatcher was on the first full day of a planned five-day visit
to the Soviet Union. She is scheduled to hold private talks with
Kremlin leader Mikhail Gorbachev this morning and expand them
to include other officials from both countries later In the after
noon — talks that are expected to dwell on such major East-West
Issues as arms control.
But yesterday, to the consternation of plainclothes KGB secur
ity men assigned to her trip, Mrs. Thatcher spent much of her
time pressing the flesh in a style more evocative of a Western-style
politician during an election campaign than a visiting dignitary in
a Communist country.
At the entrance to the famous St. Serglus Monastery here. Mrs.
Thatcher momentarily stunned Soviet security guards by sud
denly veering away from the entrance and mingling with a crowd
of onlookers.
As she smiled and shook hands with startled Russians, several
plainclothes security men surfaced from within the crowd to give
her room to move.
Soviet experimental elections
MOSCOW — Elections featuring several candidates and billed
as experimental will be held in select districts throughout the
country on June 21, the Soviet news agency Tass announced yes
terday. The move will give voters a choice of candidates on a wide
scale for the first time In Soviet history.
At certain polling places in 15 Soviet republics and autonomous
regions, voters will have a choice of candidates for posts on local
governing councils and forjudges on district courts, Tass said.
The experiment, if adopted generally, could increase the impor
tance of elections, which until now have been limited to one candi
date. Voting, nevertheless. Is compulsory.
Tass said the legislatures of the republics made the decision to
hold the competitive elections "by way of an experiment."
The Russian-language Tass release, carried on the front page of
the official Communist Party newspaper Pravda, did not Indicate
how many separate contests would be involved. Western
diplomats say that at least 144 different seats will be affected.
Hussein considering visit to U.S.
AMMAN, Jordan — Jordan Is sending two top officials to Wash
ington next week to discuss whether a visit by King Hussein
would succeed in making progress toward an international peace
conference on the Middle East, a senior Jordanian official said
yesterday.
Jordanian Prime Minister Zeid Rlfai and Foreign Minister
Taher Masri will go to Washington April 5, the official said.
Such a visit by Hussein would represent a sharp change in the
Arab leader's attitude. Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak and
Hussein, two of the United States' closest Arab allies, were invited
last December and January, respectively, to visit Washington. But
both turned down the invitations at the time, in large part be
cause of anger over the Reagan administration's sale of arms to
Iran.
Jordan and Egypt, both concerned about Islamic extremism,
are two of Iraq's most active supporters in its war with Iran.
Indicted Israeli officer quits post
JERUSALEM — The Israeli air force officer who was indicted in
the United States last month as a conspirator in the Jonathan Jay
Pollard spy scandal resigned his prestigious command of the
country's second-largest air base here yesterday.
The surprise action came just 30 days after Col. Aviem Sella, a
much-decorated pilot, was put in charge of the Tel Nof base in a
move that angered the Reagan administration and raised doubts
in the United States over Israel's sincerity in apologizing for the
Pollard affair.
Sella said that his decision was "personal and Independently
made" and that it was based on "the deterioration In Israel/U.S.
relations and my concern for the future of ties between the two
countries and for relations with American Jewry."
While his resignation deals with one of the principal irritants af
flicting U.S./Israeli relations as a result of the Pollard affair, it is
not expected to Influence two ongoing Israeli investigations Into
the case.
Rehnquist court: A shift to the left
WASHINGTON — By elevating staunch conservative William
Rehnquist to be chief justice last year, the Reagan administration
hoped to tilt the Supreme Court toward the right.
But instead, the first term of the "Rehnquist court" has seen a
pronounced shift to the left. The court's liberal leader, 80-year-old
William Brennan, has put together a solid majority in a series of
hotly contested cases.
In the view of Harvard University professor Lawrence Tribe, this
is not the Rehnquist court at all. "It is more appropriate," he said,
"to say this is the Brennan court."
Last year. Brennan and the liberal side prevailed in only 20 of
the 69 cases with a libcral-versus-conservative split. So far in this
term, however, Brennan's faction has won 16 of the 26 divided
cases.
And when the issue has been civil rights for blacks, women,
handicapped persons or aliens. Brennan has been on the winning
side every time. That has given him the authority to determine
which justice should write the opinion, and he has frequently cho
sen himself.
Only In criminal law and In cases of relatively little legal signifi
cance has Rehnquist been able to forge a conservative consensus.
Pope drawn into propaganda war
SANTIAGO, Chile — As he begins a new pilgrim's Odyssey to
South America. Pope John Paul II has become a political football,
a white-robed man for all passions, in a gritty propaganda war
here between the government of President Augusto Pinochet and
his opponents.
The Roman Catholic Church In Chile, the most forthright and
credible defender of human rights in a repressive dictatorship,
awaits the pope as a "messenger of life." In a government view,
though, he is the "messenger of peace." Each side reads its own
slogan its own way.
Joined by fellow government foes ranging from the conservative
right to the violent Marxist left, the church portrays John Paul as
a figure whose preoccupation is for human dignity and economic
and social well being, basic rights of life that the opposition says
Pinochet has trampled.
Unable themselves to shake the stiff-necked general's grip or. to
short circuit his preparations to remain in office for another de
cade. opposition forces somewhat forlornly hope the pope will
achieve what they themselves have failed to accomplish during 13
years of dictatorship.
