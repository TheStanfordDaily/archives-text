# Kennedy refuses comment on Hoover IOB link
## 
### TRACIE THOMPSON Staff writer 
University President Donald
Kennedy said yesterday that he is
not considering any changes in
Stanford's relationship with the
Hoover Institution in light of in
formation linking the director of
the institution to the Iran-contra
affair.
Kennedy had no comment on
the legal advice reportedly given to
White House officials by the Presi
dent's Intelligence Oversight
Board (IOB). W. Glenn Campbell,
director of the Hoover Institution,
is chairman of the Reagan
appointed advisory board. A
former dean of the Law School,
Charles Meyers, is also a member
of the 108.
Legal advice concerning aid to
Nicaraguan contra rebels was re
quested of the 108 by Lt. Colonel
Oliver North and Vice Admiral
John Poindexter in 1984. At that
time, there was a congressional
prohibition against covert or overt
military assistance to the contras.
The Tower commission report
states that "it appears that Lt. Col.
North and Vice Admiral Poindex
ter received legal advice from Pres
ident's Intelligence Oversight
Board that the restrictions on the
lethal assistance did not cover the
[National Security Council] staff."
Campbell, who was recently
censured by the Faculty Senate for
his written statement that Stan
ford could "boast" of its "Reagan
connection." has again drawn
criticism from Stanford faculty
members.
Political Science Prof. John
Manlev has called the lastest

reports about Campbell's political
connections "an opportunity for
Kennedy to do something" about
the University's relationship with
Hoover.
If there is no change, Manley
said, "Kennedy is going to go
down in Stanford history as the
man who brought us the Reagan
Library and irrevocably linked
Stanford's name to the right wing

of the Republican party."
Political Science Prof. Alexander
George said it is not yet known to
what extent Campbell paticipated
in the formulation of the lOB's ad
vice. He warned that if congres
sional investigations of the Iran-
Contra matter lead to disclosures
of a more explicit connection to
the Hoover director, "it will lead to
further, justifiable criticism of
Campbell."
