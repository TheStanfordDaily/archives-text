Twenty Brown University stu
dents found guilty of disrupting
a university meeting during a
divestment protest have
received sentences of probation
— the lightest possible sentence
— from a university judicial
body, according to Brown
spokespersons.
The case attracted national
media attention because Amy
Carter, daughter of former Pres
ident Carter, was among those
charged.
The protesters faced sen
tences ranging from probation

to suspension or expulsion from
the university, according to
Rebecca Ziegler. one of the
protesters.
The sentence of probation
means that students must "be
on their good behavior" and
must not be implicated in
similar events this year, accord
ing to the Brown University Jud
icial Guidelines.
The case began Feb. 13 when
approximately 50 students en
tered the winter meeting of the
Brown University Corporation,
the equivalent of Stanford's
Board of Trustees.
The students read a statement
demanding that the corporation

place the issue of divestment on
its agenda and divest its stock
holdings from companies doing
business in South Africa. The
corporation immediately ad
journed the meeting and had
university security detain the
protesters.
The university charged the
students with violating the
policy against campus disrup
tion, and brought the students
to trial before an internal disci
plinary body.
The panel, which normally
reaches a verdict in a matter of
hours in such cases, took six
days to reach a decision. The
decision was released March 12.
