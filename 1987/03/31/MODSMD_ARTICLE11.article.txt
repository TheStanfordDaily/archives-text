# Hormone may fight diabetes

The discovery of a new hormone
by scientists at the Stanford Uni
versity School of Medicine and the
Karolinska Institute in Sweden
may lead to a new approach in the
treatment of diabetes and other
metabolic disorders, according to
a Stanford researcher.
Kazuhika Tatemoto, an associ
ate professor of psychiatry and be
havioral sciences at the medical
school, and colleagues at Stanford
and in Sweden first identified the
hormone in pig pancreatic tissue.
The discovery was reported this
month.
The hormone was named
"pancreastatin," because it in
hibits pancreatic cells from secret
ing Insulin, according to

Tatemoto.
Researchers are currently
looking for pancreastatin In
samples of human tissue. They
are also searching to see if the
hormone is present in other
glands such as the pituitary and
the adrenal glands, Tatemoto
said.
"Usually when one hormone is
found in a bovine species, a
similar hormone can be found in
humans." he added.
Pancreastatin may be a possible
cause of diabetes in humans,
Tatemoto said. Diabetes is caused
by a shortage of insulin, a chemi
cal that breaks down glucose and
creates energy from it. It is
believed to afflict as many as 10
million people in the United
States.
Currently, most people who

have diabetes take insulin shots
to treat their disease. If pancreas
tatin functions in humans as re
searchers expect, then the dis
covery may lead to a completely
new approach to the treatment of
diabetes, accroding to Tatemoto.
In the future, a synthetic drug
may be created to block pancreas
tatin and. therefore, increase in
sulin secretion, he said.
The discovery of the new
hormone has raised new ques
tions. According to Tatemoto, its
structure is similar to the
structure of part of a large, myste
rious protein called chromo
granin. Chromogranin's function
has puzzled scientists for over 20
years. Tatemoto said the protein
might break down via an un
known process to form pancreas
tatin and other hormones.
