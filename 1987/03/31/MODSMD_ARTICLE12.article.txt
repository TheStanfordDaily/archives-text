The recent decision of a Santa Clara
County Superior Court judge to grant a pre
liminary injunction supporting Stanford
diver Simone LeVant's refusal to submit to
mandatory drug testing is an exciting first
victory against the NCAA regulation.
However, the significance of this victory
could be obscured or even nullified if
LeVant's case is declared moot or if other stu
dent athletes fail to take up this fight and
insure that a precedent against drug testing
is set.
LeVant has been battling the NCAA's
madatory drug testing program since Octo
ber. Although the Injunction would have
allowed her to compete in NCAA diving
championships without having to take a
urine test, Levant, a graduating senior,
failed to qualify for the championship and
thus her case could be declared moot.
The NCAA rule should not be allowed to go
unchallenged. Mandatory drug testing is an
intrusion, both physically and mentally, into
the constitutionally protected right to
privacy. It is unfair that those students who
wish to use their athletic abilities to compete
should be subjected to this Invasion of
privacy. What is more unfair is that in addi

tion to this invasion of privacy, the tests are
not always accurate. Further, they test in
part for drugs that are not illegal — for exam
ple, caffeine and aspirin. If an athlete tests
positive on either of these substances, he or
she could be temporarily excluded from
competion.
The Stanford Athletic Department, though
complying with regulations, has vocally
opposed the NCAA drug-testing program. In
addition, another Stanford student athlete,
soccer player Jenifer Hill, has joined LeVant
in her suit. Hill's addition to the suit both
reduces the chance that LeVant's case will be
declared moot and ensures that the struggle
against the drug-testing regulations will con
tinue.
But the supportive voice of our Athletic De
partment and just one additional suit by Hill
will not be strong enough to effectively
counter the NCAA regulation; LeVant's vic
tory applies only to the state of California.
Students, athletes and otherwise, here and
at other schools, should be encouraged and
unafraid to join the fight against the ruling.
Only a united and concerted effort will get
the courts to force the NCAA to eliminate its
intrusive program.
