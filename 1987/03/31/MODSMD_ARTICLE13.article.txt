Computer
science shows
SDI can work
A recent article (Dally, March 3)
quotes Computer Science Prof.
Terry Winograd as saying that
people who understand computer
systems agree that the computer
part of the Strategic Defense
Initiative (SDI) can't work. As a
computer scientist, I want to
dissent from that.
Discussing the specific problem
of the SDI computer system Is not
feasible now because definite
proposals haven't been made
about the physics. For example, it
has not been decided whether the
system will be ground-based or
space-based; or whether lasers,
"smart rocks" or a combination of
the two would be used. There also
isn't a clear picture about the
extent to which the system will be
centrally controlled and to what
extent control will be distributed.
For this reason, Winograd's
group, Computer Professionals
for Social Responsibility, and
others have had to resort to gen
eral arguments about the diffi
culty of debugging large systems.

and I will have to resort to general
arguments defending the possi
bility of debugging them.
SDI critics cite examples about
bugs In computer systems con
trolling space vehicles. However,
let's ask to what extent computer
programming difficulties have
contributed to delays in the
schedules, cost overruns and
disasters and what fraction of
project costs have involved com
puter programming.
My impression (and so far as I
know there has been no sys
tematic study of the matter) is
that computer programs have
contributed to a small fraction of
the difficulties, costs and dis
asters of these projects.
For this reason, if computer
programming is critical to the
feasibility of SDI. there is the
possibility of putting much
greater resources into it than has
seemed necessary in previous
projects.
Many large systems have
worked the first time they have
been turned on — including an
enormous program for telephone
switching. Sometimes bugs have
turned up years later.
The SDI system may function
perfectly in case of attack even
though it has some residual
bugs. If the programs are well
tested, the remaining bugs are

unlikely to excited in a single
attack.
Many will say that this won't do
— that perfect safety is required.
Alas, no strategy will get perfect
safety, and SDI looks worth ex
ploring to see what improvements
in our safety it will give us. I hope
that Stanford scientists whose
abilities are relevant will help
with SDI.
Let me finish with an ad
hominem remark. The activists
against SDI are mainly the same
people who have been activists
against every other defense pro
gram. This leads one to the
opinion that there is nothing
special about the computer prob
lems. It is just another thing to
argue about.

Rooney was
not given
proper respect
Higher education evokes the
image of mature and respectable
individuals who are courteous in
both word and deed. Not surpris
ingly, this is an image that

manifests itself daily throughout
every corner of campus. There
are, however, a few disappointing
exceptions to this high ideal.
Some of the reactions to Andy
Rooney's speech March 10 pro
vide insight into these excep
tions. Some members of the audi
ence voiced their objection to
certain statements by means of
the "Stanford hiss." This
"tradition" may be appropriate at
the Flicks, but it is entirely inap
propriate when listening to a
guest speaker.
Andy Rooney is a well-known
author and journalist who made
Stanford the site of one of only a
handful of annual public appear
ances. We, as the Stanford com
munity, invited him to come and
entertain us. He is therefore our
guest, and should be treated with
the respect and courtesy that any
guest deserves.
Nobody is saying that everyone
should agree with what was said,
but comments and arguments
can be voiced in a polite and
respectful manner. I was brought
up to believe that if you didn't
have anything nice to say then
don't say it at all.
