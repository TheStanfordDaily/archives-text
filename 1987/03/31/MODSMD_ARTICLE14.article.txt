# Deaths of the rich & famous

Filmmaker John Waters ("Pink Flamingos,"
"Polyester") came to Stanford at the end of win
ter quarter and at the reception after his
speech, I asked him about my pet topic:
celebrity death. Since the reception was at
Tresldder, not In the limelight, I thought
nobody would ever know about our conversa
tion.

Imagine my pleasure at finding that my
brush with fame had made It Into print — and
In The Dally, which everybody reads! However,
my name was not mentioned, nor was Mr.
Waters' interesting reply to my question. So, In
the Interests of journallslc Integrity and
shameless self-publlclty, here Is the story.
To refresh your memory. The Dally said that
John Waters "Is a magnet for oddities of all
kinds, and was asked, 'just for fun,' who he
thought the next celebrity death would be, a
question that took him slightly aback."
Nobody ever called me an oddity before. I'm
tickled pink. I mean, shocking John Waters Is
some achievement.
I asked Mr. Waters to predict the next
celebrity death, which he very kindly did.
"Salvador Dall." he said, which was quick
witted — but playing it safe since the artist Is
83 years old. Also. Dall and his deathbed are in
Spain. To really count, a celebrity death has to
happen in America.
Of course I had a prediction of my own. Fans
of Woody Allen had better skip this paragraph.
The American phenomenon of celebrity death
has certain requirements, which Woody Allen
would meet remarkably well. There's the pre
dictable shock whenever someone Is cut down
in his prime. A lot of writers could write arti
cles about what films Woody might have made,
if only he had lived. "Hannah and Her Sisters'"
would take all the Oscars (as though it weren't
going to already). And Woody occupies a posi
tion of cultural legitimacy. John Waters thinks
Woody's too boring — The Weekly World News

could make nothing of him — but like I said,
this would legitimize all displays of public
mourning. The major weekly news magazines
could write respectful summaries of Woody's
career and we'd all think what a shame it was
he had to go.
People were so shocked when I suggested
Woody's Impending demise. Which proves my
point. John Waters asked if it was an assas
sination threat. That was when I said it was
just for fun. Really, I'm aiding and abetting
Woody's own hypochondria.
Think about it. Didn't we all see Woody
moan about his brain tumor in "Hannah and
Her Sisters"? Remember "Annie Hall"? When
Woody and Annie break up and she's moving
out, he says that all the books about death are
his. Woody would probably love this Idea of
mine.
It's a curious phenomenon, this cult of
celebrity death. My mind is running along
these morbid tracks because in the last six or
eight weeks, we lost Liberace, Andy Warhol,
James Coco and Danny Kaye. Reading front
page obituaries has been a pleasant diversion
from the latest development In the Iran-contra
scandal. Oh, maybe that's It — our govern
ment is killing famous people to relieve the
media pressure.
I think we can formulate some general state
ments on this phenomenon:
□ You can be dead, or even historical, and still
be a celebrity. Look at Elvis. Marilyn, James
Dean and Rudolf Valentino. These people are
known for being dead. The first-name recogni
tion factor helps. Cher will make a great dead
celebrity. So will Charo. So. I suppose, will
Cybill — but not until she has her twins.
□ Celebrity status is maintained by appearing
in movies, making records (note 1 don't say act
ing or singing), going on talk shows and gener
ally staying in the public eye. Since death puts
a stop to these activities, logically it should
mean the end of celebrity. But actually, It's a
new beginning. If the celebrities in question
hadn't passed on they'd still be eating out.
having their hair done and trying to buy their
way Into the "People" section of Time maga
zine. Death generates celebrity. Your life gets
reviewed and you're guaranteed four stars.
Only rarely do celebrities get this kind of
treatment when they're still alive. I have a

headline from the San Fransico Chronicle that
says, "Liberace in a Coma — Adoring Fans
Gather for the End." Liberace was special. Not
every star can get that kind of press.
In the 1960s, Liberace acted (he does deserve
the word) in a movie called "The Loved One,"
based on the novel by Evelyn Waugh. He plays
a mortician in a cemetery like Hollywood's For
est Lawn, and gets married to a woman who
puts makeup on corpses. Woody Allen's brain
tumor is weak in comparison.
□ Celebrity obituaries are the best reason to
read the front page first.
I'm working on a general hypothesis that will
account for our cult of celebrity death. There
must be sociological reasons for coffin photos
in the National Enquirer. Is it the University of
Kentucky that has a department of Popular
Culture? There's probably a graduate student
there researching the phenomenon right now.
Another thing about celebrity death is that it
allows us to be callous and tasteless about a
serious subject. This is how many people
would like to react to the death of other public
figures — like political and religious leaders —
only they repress it. Then they find themselves
telling Helen Keller jokes.
Now, I'm taking nominations for the next
celebrity death. Be sure to pick someone you
love to hate, because whoever it is, you'll be
reading a lot about them.
So far, the best suggestions I've received are
Lucille Ball and Bill Cosby. There's something
about comedians.
Woody Allen once said, "I'm not afraid to die,
I just don't want to be there when it happens."
Being a celebrity is like not being there when
it happens.
The last strange thing is that you can read
about a celebrity death in five different
magazines but a few months later, if you think
about it, you can't remember if the celebrity is
dead or alive. If they rerun a tape of James
Coco on the "Tonight Show," isn't Coco still a
celebrity? Conversely, if you look at a People
magazine from 1977 you will see pictures of
people who must still be alive, they must be.
They're in celebrity limbo — "The Love Boat"
takes you there.
I'm glad I'm an oddity, not a celebrity.

Lucille Ball and Bill Cosby. There's something
about comedians.
Woody Allen once said, "I'm not afraid to die,
I just don't want to be there when it happens."
Being a celebrity is like not being there when
it happens.
The last strange thing is that you can read
about a celebrity death in five different
magazines but a few months later, if you think
about it, you can't remember if the celebrity is
dead or alive. If they rerun a tape of James
Coco on the "Tonight Show," isn't Coco still a
celebrity? Conversely, if you look at a People
magazine from 1977 you will see pictures of
people who must still be alive, they must be.
They're in celebrity limbo — "The Love Boat"
takes you there.
I'm glad I'm an oddity, not a celebrity.

Filmmaker John Waters ("Pink Flamingos,"
"Polyester") came to Stanford at the end of win
ter quarter and at the reception after his
speech, I asked him about my pet topic:
celebrity death. Since the reception was at
Tresldder, not In the limelight, I thought
nobody would ever know about our conversa
tion.

Imagine my pleasure at finding that my
brush with fame had made It Into print — and
In The Dally, which everybody reads! However,
my name was not mentioned, nor was Mr.
Waters' interesting reply to my question. So, In
the Interests of journallslc Integrity and
shameless self-publlclty, here Is the story.
To refresh your memory. The Dally said that
John Waters "Is a magnet for oddities of all
kinds, and was asked, 'just for fun,' who he
thought the next celebrity death would be, a
question that took him slightly aback."
Nobody ever called me an oddity before. I'm
tickled pink. I mean, shocking John Waters Is
some achievement.
I asked Mr. Waters to predict the next
celebrity death, which he very kindly did.
"Salvador Dall." he said, which was quick
witted — but playing it safe since the artist Is
83 years old. Also. Dall and his deathbed are in
Spain. To really count, a celebrity death has to
happen in America.
Of course I had a prediction of my own. Fans
of Woody Allen had better skip this paragraph.
The American phenomenon of celebrity death
has certain requirements, which Woody Allen
would meet remarkably well. There's the pre
dictable shock whenever someone Is cut down
in his prime. A lot of writers could write arti
cles about what films Woody might have made,
if only he had lived. "Hannah and Her Sisters'"
would take all the Oscars (as though it weren't
going to already). And Woody occupies a posi
tion of cultural legitimacy. John Waters thinks
Woody's too boring — The Weekly World News

could make nothing of him — but like I said,
this would legitimize all displays of public
mourning. The major weekly news magazines
could write respectful summaries of Woody's
career and we'd all think what a shame it was
he had to go.
People were so shocked when I suggested
Woody's Impending demise. Which proves my
point. John Waters asked if it was an assas
sination threat. That was when I said it was
just for fun. Really, I'm aiding and abetting
Woody's own hypochondria.
Think about it. Didn't we all see Woody
moan about his brain tumor in "Hannah and
Her Sisters"? Remember "Annie Hall"? When
Woody and Annie break up and she's moving
out, he says that all the books about death are
his. Woody would probably love this Idea of
mine.
It's a curious phenomenon, this cult of
celebrity death. My mind is running along
these morbid tracks because in the last six or
eight weeks, we lost Liberace, Andy Warhol,
James Coco and Danny Kaye. Reading front
page obituaries has been a pleasant diversion
from the latest development In the Iran-contra
scandal. Oh, maybe that's It — our govern
ment is killing famous people to relieve the
media pressure.
I think we can formulate some general state
ments on this phenomenon:
□ You can be dead, or even historical, and still
be a celebrity. Look at Elvis. Marilyn, James
Dean and Rudolf Valentino. These people are
known for being dead. The first-name recogni
tion factor helps. Cher will make a great dead
celebrity. So will Charo. So. I suppose, will
Cybill — but not until she has her twins.
□ Celebrity status is maintained by appearing
in movies, making records (note 1 don't say act
ing or singing), going on talk shows and gener
ally staying in the public eye. Since death puts
a stop to these activities, logically it should
mean the end of celebrity. But actually, It's a
new beginning. If the celebrities in question
hadn't passed on they'd still be eating out.
having their hair done and trying to buy their
way Into the "People" section of Time maga
zine. Death generates celebrity. Your life gets
reviewed and you're guaranteed four stars.
Only rarely do celebrities get this kind of
treatment when they're still alive. I have a

headline from the San Fransico Chronicle that
says, "Liberace in a Coma — Adoring Fans
Gather for the End." Liberace was special. Not
every star can get that kind of press.
In the 1960s, Liberace acted (he does deserve
the word) in a movie called "The Loved One,"
based on the novel by Evelyn Waugh. He plays
a mortician in a cemetery like Hollywood's For
est Lawn, and gets married to a woman who
puts makeup on corpses. Woody Allen's brain
tumor is weak in comparison.
□ Celebrity obituaries are the best reason to
read the front page first.
I'm working on a general hypothesis that will
account for our cult of celebrity death. There
must be sociological reasons for coffin photos
in the National Enquirer. Is it the University of
Kentucky that has a department of Popular
Culture? There's probably a graduate student
there researching the phenomenon right now.
Another thing about celebrity death is that it
allows us to be callous and tasteless about a
serious subject. This is how many people
would like to react to the death of other public
figures — like political and religious leaders —
only they repress it. Then they find themselves
telling Helen Keller jokes.
Now, I'm taking nominations for the next
celebrity death. Be sure to pick someone you
love to hate, because whoever it is, you'll be
reading a lot about them.
