# Movie is racist
## 
### 
The plot of the movie "Hoosiers"
culminates at the 1952 Indiana
state championship high school
basketball game. The coach,
portrayed by Gene Hackman,
gives his small-town team a fiery
pep talk in the locker room. He
uses the biblical story of David
and Goliath to put things into per
spective for the Cinderella-like
Hickory Huskies. By this point we,
the audience, have endured along
with this team all of the trials and
tribulations it took to get to the
championship. To a limited ex
tent, we identify with the hoopla
of the audiences in the movie that
are present at the games. I say
that we could do this only to a lim
ited extent because the audiences
in the movie blatantly failed to
represent reality: They are nearly
100 percent white.

As a black person from Indiana.
I know that out of hundreds of
people, more than two black
people would have attended the
pre-championship games. Come
on, this is basketball! The lack of
representation was so obvious
that when the first of the two
black people are shown, about
halfway through the film, some
one behind me yelled, "It's about
time!"
As the coach on the screen
delivers his crucial pep talk, I
turned to my friend Tony, who
was sitting next to me. and
whispered, "I bet that the oppos
ing team will be black." Tony
responded, "They wouldn't do
that," implying that the writ
ers/casters would not fail to
portray black people until this
crucial moment, and then portray

them as the opponent. My predic
tion, however, was correct. Al
though all of the members on the
team are not black, at least half
are. Both of the other team's
coaches are black, too. It is not by
chance that the opponent is
predominantly black.
At this point in the movie, we
are supposed to feel allegiance to
this small-town white team and
have aggression toward the op
ponent. What better way to create
aggression than to make the other
team represent the "opposite" of
"small-town whiteness"? Just as
the faithful and pure David con
quered the evil Goliath, It is this
team's duty to defeat its evil
Goliath, and we are supposed to
cheer them on. Hell no! In Holly l
wood, where black actors and
actresses have to be specifically re
quested as such, this juxtaposi
tion did not occur by chance. I am
not about to blind myself to it and
yell, "Go Huskies!"
By playing upon the racist ten
dencies of the American audience,
this part of the film taps Into the
subconscious stream of emotions.
The aggression felt Is not that of a
healthy competitive spirit (if that
exists), but is an aggression that
is tainted with the echos of a his
torically racist America.
I have given some insight as to
what the movie represents to me.
On one hand. I would like to urge
all to see the film in order to get a
feel for the subtle offenses that we
often let slip by unless we are in
formed. On the other hand, It Is
obviously asinine to economically
support such trash. So, as a com
promise, I recommend the film
only to those who would like to be
enlightened as to what subtle rac
ism in the media is like.
