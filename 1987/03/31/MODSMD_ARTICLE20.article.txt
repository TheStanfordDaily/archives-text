## Bug divides up University's assets for students 
### KATHRYN VER PLOEG Staff writer 
Dt'Cir Bug Me,
Out of concern for human
welfare, I'd like to know why
some of the houses on the Row
(like the Delta Kappa Epsilon
and the old Delta Upsilon
houses) have wooden fire
escapes.
- David Byrne
Oddly enough, wooden fire
escapes pose absolutely no prob

lem. In fact, as University Fire
Marshal Ray Gamma said: "It's the
metal ones which are dangerous.
Because they're so slippery, build
ing and fire codes have even
prohibited their use. Wooden fire
escapes, on the other hand, are
both strong and safe."
OK, but what are you supposed
to do if they catch on fire them
selves? As Gamma said, "If they're
burning, you're not going to go
down those steps, you'll go down
another set."
Makes sense.

Dear Bug Me,
So how do you really spell that
tomato sauce stuff anyway? Is it
ketchup or catsup?
- Del Bert Monte
That all depends on nothing
more than which brand you
prefer. As Del Monte's publicity
brochure "Inside the Catsup Fac
tory" says:"The original spelling
is kechap, a Malay word. The first
English spelling was phonetic."
Catsup is the preferred spelling,
according to Webster's Third New
International Dictionary (Un
abridged). Del Monte spells it this
way. But please let it be noted that
Del Monte also spells it as
"ketchup" in both Germany and
Japan.
Heinz, on the other hand.

prefers "ketchup" as the phonetic
spelling of the Malaysian word
"kechap."

Aside from the fact that the
average American consumes three
and one-half pounds (four bottles)
of catsup annually, and that Olga
Korbut puts ketchup on her

pancakes, there's not much to be
said about the stuff.
Dear Bug Me,
Who owns Stanford? If the
powers that be decided to lock
the doors and liquidate all of the
University's assets, who would
get the loot? Since the University
is not owned by a government, is
not a publicly held firm, and is
not affiliated with a religious or
ganization, surely someone has
a legal claim to any and all of the
Unversity's assets. IJ not, then I
volunteer!
- First Claimant
Nice idea. Unfortunately,
though, the founding grant in the
Stanfords' will stipulates that the

University can never be sold; for
the duration, the grant itself and
all holdings would be adminis
tered by the Board of Trustees.
If Stanford ever did hit dire
straits and had to shut down, the
remains of the University would
probably become a ward of the
state.
No one could hazard a guess on
the value of the campus itself, but
all the University's outside hold
ings (stocks, outside real estate,
venture capital, etc.) add up to an
endowment of >1.5 billion. If it
weren't blatantly illegal to try,
each of the 32 trustees could get
>46,875,000 apiece by voting to li
quidate the assets ana pocket the
profit. A student usurpation and
liquidation would yield a tidy
13,019.89 per student.
