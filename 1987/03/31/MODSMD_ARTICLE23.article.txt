## First March loss for Stanford baseball UNLV wins non-conference game 
### JOHN LIS Editorial staff 
And so the streak ends â€” not
with a whimper but a bang.
The University of Nevada-Las
Vegas hitters pounded out 10
runs on 17 hits to end Stanford's
11-game winning streak with an
impressive 10-3 non-conference
victory over the Cardinal yesterday
at Sunken Diamond.
"It was one of those days where
everything was going right for us,"
said UNLV Coach Fred Dallimore,
whose club opened its trip to the
Bay Area by taking two of three
games from San Jose State to earn
a tie for first place in the Pacific
Coast Athletic Association and a
19-12 overall record.
"We always play well against
Stanford. I don't know why. It's a
good opportunity for our team to
play Stanford."
Stanford, now 22-9, was coming

off a three-game sweep of Arizona
State that had moved the Cardinal
Into first place in the Pacific 10
Southern Division, but no one
was expecting a letdown that left
Stanford with its first loss since
Feb. 28.
"I don't expect letdowns." Stan
ford Coach Mark Marquess said.
"They were coming off a three
game series themselves. We
shouldn't have had a letdown."
"We played real well this
weekend, and we expected to play
well today." left fielder Ruben
Amaro said. "You've got to give
those guys some credit. They
swung the bat well and beat us in
every phase of the game."
Swinging the bat best for the
Rebels was left fielder Scott
Childress, who was 4-for-5 with
two home runs and four RBls, in
cluding a three-run shot in the
fifth inning that blew the game
open. That homer followed an RBI

single by catcher Dave Sturdivant
and a sacrifice fly by right fielder
Joe Felix and gave UNLV a 6-0
lead.
A 1 Osuna, who relieved loser
Rob Wassenaar (2-1) prior to Stur
divant's single, surrendered an
other homer to third baseman
Larry Simms before escaping the
inning. Simms had received new
life when Stanford first baseman
Ron Witmeyer dropped his pop
foul for an error. Simms finished
3-for-4 with three RBls.
Meanwhile, the Cardinal bats
were being silenced by UNLV
starter Joe Sawaia. The freshman
right-hander, the fourth man in
the Rebel rotation, took a no
hitter into the fifth inning, but
was pulled with one out after
walking Frank Carey and Amaro.

UNLV's David Baxter didn't fare too well in his pinch running role yesterday. Baxter was caught in a 1-3-6-
3-4 rundown in the seventh inning. Stanford second baseman Frank Carey (3) made the put-out, while
third baseman Ed Sprague (31) backed up the play.
