# Indiana wins final, 74-73
## 
### 
NEW ORLEANS (AP) — It was 30 seconds to vic
tory for Indiana and a half-minute of broken
dreams for Syracuse.
Trailing 73-72, Indiana called time out with 30
seconds to play in the championship game of the
NCAA basketball tournament. Two seconds after
play resumed, Derrick Coleman, the 6-foot-9
Syracuse freshman, was fouled by Keith Smart
and went to the line to shoot 1-and-l.
"There was no emotion," Coleman said. "I just
knew that if I made the free throws, I'd put my
team ahead for good."
The free throw was short, and Smart hit a
baseline jumper at the other end with five seconds
to play, giving Indiana the national title with a 74-
73 victory.
Coleman had stood alone at the free throw line.
Rather than string players along the foul lane,
Syracuse Coach Jim Boeheim opted to pull back
on defense.
"We didn't want them to get a basket on the
transition," Boeheim said. "We had the lead and
we weren't worried about scoring."
Coleman said the coach told the team he didn't
want anyone to foul trying to rebound a missed

free throw, and so four Syraeuse players were sent
back to Indiana's end of the floor.
"I felt confident at the line, but I knew when 1
released it that it was off to the right," said Cole
man. a 69 percent free-throw shooter who missed
two of his four chances Monday night. "1 wasn't
nervous at all. It was like any other free throw."
Syracuse tried to call a timeout after Smart's go
ahead basket, but four seconds ticked off the
clock, leaving only one second for a desperation
attempt. Smart intercepted the inbounds pass at
halfcourt as the final buzzer sounded.
Syracuse guard Greg Monroe said both he and
senior teammate Howard Triche had tried to call
the timeout immediately.
"I saw three seconds left," Monroe said, "I was
near halfcourt and Howard was right near the ref
eree and they didn't see it."
"We tried to call time out, all of us tried, but they
didn't hear us," Coleman said. "I don't think they
could hear us from all the noise."
"It wasn't the foul shot that lost the game,"
Boeheim said. "It came down to the last shot and
they happened to have it. We did
everything we could to win.
"No one has to walk off the court
feeling bad," Boeheim said.
"There's nothing I can say to make
them feel better, but they gave it a
great effort.
"There's only one team better,
and that isn't by much."
Smart, a junior college transfer,
scored 17 of his 21 points in the
second half, as Indiana Coach
Bobby Knight earned his third na
tional basketball title.

Syracuse had a chance to win
but Triche missed the second of
two free throws with 38 seconds
left and then Coleman missed his
1-and-l.
Knight joined the select com
pany of UCLA's John Wooden,
with 10, and Kentucky's Adolph
Rupp, with four, as coaches who
have won more than two NCAA
crowns. Knight, who won titles In
1976 and 1981. saw the fulfill
ment of the recent adjustments he
made. Previously, he was reluc
tant to sign junior college trans
fers and had been opposed to
using zone defenses.
But those changes helped
Knight share the Big Ten title

with Purdue this year and ulti
mately took him to New Orleans.
Steve Alford, Indiana's all-time
leading scorer, added 23 points,
hitting seven of 10 from three
point range. His only other goal
was a layup.
Forward Daryl Thomas added
20 points and Dean Garrett, an
other junior college transfer, had
10 points and 10 rebounds.
Syracuse, which shared the Big
East title with Pittsburgh and
Georgetown, got 20 points from
point guard Sherman Douglas. 18
from center Rony Seikaly and 12
from guard Greg Monroe.
Coleman, a 6-9 freshman,
grabbed 19 rebounds, two short of

the tournament record set by Bill
Spivey in 1951.
Indiana trailed most of the first
half, but two straight three
pointers by Alford put them in the
locker room at halftlme with a 34-
33 lead.
Indiana took a 41-37 lead in the
second half, but Syracuse out
scored the Hoosiers 15-3, with
reserve Derek Brower contribu
ting five points and Seikaly four
points for a 52-44 lead.
The Hoosiers bounced back
with a 10-0 run as reserve Joe Hill
man made two steals and Garrett
blocked shots by Seikaly and Cole
man. Smart's jumper capped the
run for a 54-52 Indiana lead.

Syracuse came back with seven
straight points, the last on
Douglas' 3-pointer.
Indiana came back to tie it at 61
on a basket by Smart. After three
more ties, Seikaly scored with
2:03 remaining. He was fouled on
the play, but missed the free
throw.
Smart tied it at 70 with a quick
move to the basket with 1:20 left.
Trlche then made a goal with 56
seconds remaining for a 72-70
Syracuse lead. Smart, from
nearby Baton Rouge, then missed
a shot with Triche grabbing the
rebound. But Smart came back to
hit the final two baskets.
As Coleman went to the free

throw line with 28 seconds left
after being fouled by Smart, no
Syracuse players joined him along
the lane. When he missed. Indiana
had an easy rebound. Smart,
named the game's most valuable
player, then took over.
Indiana won its fifth title over
all, also winning in 1940 and
1953 under Coach Branch
McCracken.
Syracuse, a poor free-throw

NEW ORLEANS (AP) — It was 30 seconds to vic
tory for Indiana and a half-minute of broken
dreams for Syracuse.
Trailing 73-72, Indiana called time out with 30
seconds to play in the championship game of the
NCAA basketball tournament. Two seconds after
play resumed, Derrick Coleman, the 6-foot-9
Syracuse freshman, was fouled by Keith Smart
and went to the line to shoot 1-and-l.
"There was no emotion," Coleman said. "I just
knew that if I made the free throws, I'd put my
team ahead for good."
The free throw was short, and Smart hit a
baseline jumper at the other end with five seconds
to play, giving Indiana the national title with a 74-
73 victory.
Coleman had stood alone at the free throw line.
Rather than string players along the foul lane,
Syracuse Coach Jim Boeheim opted to pull back
on defense.
"We didn't want them to get a basket on the
transition," Boeheim said. "We had the lead and
we weren't worried about scoring."
Coleman said the coach told the team he didn't
want anyone to foul trying to rebound a missed

free throw, and so four Syraeuse players were sent
back to Indiana's end of the floor.
"I felt confident at the line, but I knew when 1
released it that it was off to the right," said Cole
man. a 69 percent free-throw shooter who missed
two of his four chances Monday night. "1 wasn't
nervous at all. It was like any other free throw."
Syracuse tried to call a timeout after Smart's go
ahead basket, but four seconds ticked off the
clock, leaving only one second for a desperation
attempt. Smart intercepted the inbounds pass at
halfcourt as the final buzzer sounded.
Syracuse guard Greg Monroe said both he and
senior teammate Howard Triche had tried to call
the timeout immediately.
"I saw three seconds left," Monroe said, "I was
near halfcourt and Howard was right near the ref
eree and they didn't see it."
"We tried to call time out, all of us tried, but they
didn't hear us," Coleman said. "I don't think they
could hear us from all the noise."
"It wasn't the foul shot that lost the game,"
Boeheim said. "It came down to the last shot and
they happened to have it. We did
everything we could to win.
"No one has to walk off the court
feeling bad," Boeheim said.
"There's nothing I can say to make
them feel better, but they gave it a
great effort.
"There's only one team better,
and that isn't by much."
Smart, a junior college transfer,
scored 17 of his 21 points in the
second half, as Indiana Coach
Bobby Knight earned his third na
tional basketball title.

Syracuse had a chance to win
but Triche missed the second of
two free throws with 38 seconds
left and then Coleman missed his
1-and-l.
Knight joined the select com
pany of UCLA's John Wooden,
with 10, and Kentucky's Adolph
Rupp, with four, as coaches who
have won more than two NCAA
crowns. Knight, who won titles In
1976 and 1981. saw the fulfill
ment of the recent adjustments he
made. Previously, he was reluc
tant to sign junior college trans
fers and had been opposed to
using zone defenses.
But those changes helped
Knight share the Big Ten title

with Purdue this year and ulti
mately took him to New Orleans.
Steve Alford, Indiana's all-time
leading scorer, added 23 points,
hitting seven of 10 from three
point range. His only other goal
was a layup.
Forward Daryl Thomas added
20 points and Dean Garrett, an
other junior college transfer, had
10 points and 10 rebounds.
Syracuse, which shared the Big
East title with Pittsburgh and
Georgetown, got 20 points from
point guard Sherman Douglas. 18
from center Rony Seikaly and 12
from guard Greg Monroe.
Coleman, a 6-9 freshman,
grabbed 19 rebounds, two short of

the tournament record set by Bill
Spivey in 1951.
Indiana trailed most of the first
half, but two straight three
pointers by Alford put them in the
locker room at halftlme with a 34-
33 lead.
Indiana took a 41-37 lead in the
second half, but Syracuse out
scored the Hoosiers 15-3, with
reserve Derek Brower contribu
ting five points and Seikaly four
points for a 52-44 lead.
The Hoosiers bounced back
with a 10-0 run as reserve Joe Hill
man made two steals and Garrett
blocked shots by Seikaly and Cole
man. Smart's jumper capped the
run for a 54-52 Indiana lead.

Syracuse came back with seven
straight points, the last on
Douglas' 3-pointer.
Indiana came back to tie it at 61
on a basket by Smart. After three
more ties, Seikaly scored with
2:03 remaining. He was fouled on
the play, but missed the free
throw.
Smart tied it at 70 with a quick
move to the basket with 1:20 left.
Trlche then made a goal with 56
seconds remaining for a 72-70
Syracuse lead. Smart, from
nearby Baton Rouge, then missed
a shot with Triche grabbing the
rebound. But Smart came back to
hit the final two baskets.
As Coleman went to the free

throw line with 28 seconds left
after being fouled by Smart, no
Syracuse players joined him along
the lane. When he missed. Indiana
had an easy rebound. Smart,
named the game's most valuable
player, then took over.
Indiana won its fifth title over
all, also winning in 1940 and
1953 under Coach Branch
McCracken.
Syracuse, a poor free-throw
shooting team with a 64 percent
mark this season, made only 11 of
20 Monday night. Both teams
shot 48 percent from the field and
Syracuse outrebounded the
