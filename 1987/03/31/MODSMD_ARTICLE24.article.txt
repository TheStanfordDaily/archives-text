### 
NEW ORLEANS (AP) â€” It was 30 seconds to vic
tory for Indiana and a half-minute of broken
dreams for Syracuse.
Trailing 73-72, Indiana called time out with 30
seconds to play in the championship game of the
NCAA basketball tournament. Two seconds after
play resumed, Derrick Coleman, the 6-foot-9
Syracuse freshman, was fouled by Keith Smart
and went to the line to shoot 1-and-l.
"There was no emotion," Coleman said. "I just
knew that if I made the free throws, I'd put my
team ahead for good."
The free throw was short, and Smart hit a
baseline jumper at the other end with five seconds
to play, giving Indiana the national title with a 74-
73 victory.
Coleman had stood alone at the free throw line.
Rather than string players along the foul lane,
Syracuse Coach Jim Boeheim opted to pull back

"We didn't want them to get a basket on the
transition," Boeheim said. "We had the lead and
we weren't worried about scoring."
Coleman said the coach told the team he didn't
want anyone to foul trying to rebound a missed

free throw, and so four Syraeuse players were sent
back to Indiana's end of the floor.
"I felt confident at the line, but I knew when 1
released it that it was off to the right," said Cole
man. a 69 percent free-throw shooter who missed
two of his four chances Monday night. "1 wasn't
nervous at all. It was like any other free throw."
Syracuse tried to call a timeout after Smart's go
ahead basket, but four seconds ticked off the
clock, leaving only one second for a desperation
attempt. Smart intercepted the inbounds pass at
halfcourt as the final buzzer sounded.
Syracuse guard Greg Monroe said both he and
senior teammate Howard Triche had tried to call
the timeout immediately.
"I saw three seconds left," Monroe said, "I was
near halfcourt and Howard was right near the ref
eree and they didn't see it."
"We tried to call time out, all of us tried, but they
didn't hear us," Coleman said. "I don't think they
could hear us from all the noise."
"It wasn't the foul shot that lost the game,"
Boeheim said. "It came down to the last shot and
