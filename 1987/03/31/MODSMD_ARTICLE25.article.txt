Most students think of spring break as a time to
get away from school and have a good time In the

Oregon State and Long Beach State on Saturday at
Redwood Shores.

race, five seconds faster than any time last year,
while the junior varsity covered the 2.000 meter
course in 7:07. Both are now 2-0 on the year.
The two novice boats also won, with the first boat

things to come."
The boats had only been set for
three days before the competition
and this was the Cardinal's first
regulation-length race of the year,
but already the two top boats are
faster than last year, when the
varsity took second at the Pacific
Coast Championships and the JV
third.
Because of this early success.
Stanford Coach John Davis said
he thinks things can only get bet

Improve greatly." he said. "1 expect
some times to drop off quite a bit
during the season."
The Cardinal hopes to continue
its success this weekend at the
San Diego Crew Classic. Defend
ing national champion Wisconsin
will be competing, as well as
defending Pacific Coast Champs,
and national third-place finisher
Washington. California, whose JV
boat finished second at the Pacific
Coasts last year, will also partici
pate.
"We hope to be at least up there
in the top three again," Farnham
said. "There are some good teams
there but we think we're as close
as we've ever been."

In three weeks, the team wtll
host the Redwood Shores/Stan
ford Classic, with Wisconsin,
Radcliffe, Washington and Prince
ton also competing. Those schools
comprised the top four at last
year's national championships.
Davis expects it to be a
"tremendous regatta. It's going to
be a tremendous opportunity for
our kids." The team will be
looking for a chance to beat the
nation's best, and additionally, for
its first victory over the Huskies.
It will also serve as a preview for
this year's nationals, to be jointly
hosted by Stanford and Cal the
last weekend in May at Redwood
Shores.
