# Men's crew defeats OSU, Long Beach St.
## 
### CHRIS CRADER Staff writer 
With spring quarter here and the lake on the rise (a
little, at least), thoughts of many Stanford students
are turning to water activities such as sailing and
windsurfing. One overlooked activity is rowing, but
the Stanford men's crew team is proving that spring
quarter also means oars and shells. The varsity and
junior varsity teams both won Saturday at Redwood
Shores, and are now both undefeated on the year.
The varsity team took only 5:41 to cover 2,000
meters, leaving both Oregon State and Long Beach
State in its wake, while the JV team recorded a 5:59
time. Both Cardinal sqauds are now 3-0.
The times were faster than any recorded last year,
leaving Stanford Coach Ken Dreyfus looking optimis
tically toward the future. "Both crews have not only
been rowing better than ever before, (but also) the
whole team is becoming winners off the water. It's
becoming the kind of team that
could pull off a major victory." he
said.
The freshman boat went up
against Long Beach State's novice
team (including rowers from all
classes who have no previous ex
perience) and lost by one second,
with a 6:02 time, but again
Dreyfus was pleased, calling the
frosh time "outstanding."
The Cardinal's true novice team
won its race, the No. 2 novice com
petition, with a 6:14 mark, while
the varsity four-man shell and the
third novice boat both lost close
races.

"Last year at this time Long
Beach was the dominant crew."
said JV stroke Craig Bouck. "This
was a big step forward for us."
This weekend the team heads
for the San Diego Crew Classic to
face the likes of Wisconsin. Har
vard. Pennsylvania and Califor
nia. the top four teams at last
year's national championships.
"Next week will tell a lot." Bouck
said. "It's the largest regatta in the
country. Everybody is going to be
there. We're looking forward to
scaring some people."
Dreyfus agreed, predicting it to
be "a very, very strong field."
In three weeks, the team will
host the Redwood Shores/Stan
ford Invitational, where the com
petitions will also be tough, in
preparation for the Pacific Coast

Championships in May.
"They've done everything they've
been expected to do," Dreyfus
said. "Everything up until now
has gone as well as it could have.
We feel we have a definite shot at
not only some Individual titles but
the overall championship as well
(at the Pacific Coasts)."
He also commended the team's
work ethic at practice, saying
"You have to be fast on Wednesday
to be fast on Saturday." and said
that the team's efforts during the
week produced the good times.
"The exciting thing about this
year is we have a fast program,"
Bouck said. "The frosh boat is
fast, the novice boat is fast, the JV
boat is fast and the varsity boat is
fast. Our whole program is
moving up."
