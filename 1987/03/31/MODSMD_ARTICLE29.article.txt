# Women's gymnastics sixth at Pacific-10s
## 
### EVAN TUCHINSKY Staff writer 
It was a classic case of "I've got some good news
and some bad news" this weekend for the Stanford
women's gymnastics team at the Pacific 10 Confer
ence Championships at Pullman, Wash. The bad
news is that the squad only finished sixth out of the
eight teams competing; the good news is the Card
inal's 181.75 team score, its highest away meet score
this season, placed the gymnasts fourth in the
region, giving Stanford an outside shot for an NCAA
finals berth.
"It was one heck of a meet," Stanfprd Coach Homer
Sardina said. "Six of the top 18 teams In the country
were there, and six teams from the Pac-10 have a
chance to make it to (the) nationals. Half of the NCAA
could be Pac-10 teams."
UCLA won the league title with a mark of 188.45.
Arizona was close behind with a 187.65, followed by
Washington at 186.15 and Arizona with a 186.10.
Oregon State finished ahead of the Cardinal with a
score of 185.25, leaving California and Washington
State, 178.65 and 177.95 respectively, to take up the
rear.
"If you could harness the energy In that meet, you
could start a nuclear war." Stanford Asst. Coach
Sam Shaw said. "The sparks were really flying."
Though energy was there for the Cardinal, consis
tency was Its downfall, as the squad only hit 17 of 24
routines. "The bottom line is that we've got to hit
sets," Sardina said, noting that Oregon hit 21
routines and UCLA and Washington each hit 23.
"We had a rough start on bars," Sardina contin
ued. "We did better on beam, then did well on vault
and floor."
Individually, only freshman Dina Amoroso
received any distinction with her 15th place finish In

the all-around, lower than expected for the Card
inal's rising star. "Dina just had an off meet," Sar
dina said. Though her performance was good
enough for a top-20 finish, Sardina said, "She
missed on bars and was shaky on beam, shaky on
vault and shaky on floor.
"Nanci Goldsmith did a terrific Job," he added." I'm
really proud of her."
Team co-captain Alison McGann put in a good ef
fort as well. "Alison put in a pretty steady perfor
mance." Sardina observed. "She was not really on.
but worked through it pretty well."
The "good news, bad news" phenomenon affected
the team's roster as well as its performance. Sopho
more Sheri Evenson, injured in an early meet this
season against California, came off of the injured
reserve list at the Pac-lOs to earn a 9.15 on floor.
Her spot on the bench had not even cooled,
however, when classmate Jinny Rhee was sidelined
with a metatarsal stress fracture. Though Rhee
should still be able to compete on uneven bars, her
loss on the other three events will be felt.
Nonetheless, the Cardinal coaches are confident
about the next few weeks. "The rest of this week
(before this weekend's meet at Albuquerque, New-
Mexico) will only help us," Sardina said. "We look to
do much better.
"We're seeded fourth in the region, the highest
seeding in our lives. We're not going to improve that,
but we can Improve our qualifying score."
The meet in Albuquerque against New Mexico and
Nebraska, Stanford's last regular season competi
tion, should cement the gymnasts' performances in
preparation for regionals. "We have one more meet to
set us up." Sardina said.
Shaw agreed. "We beat Albuquerque-New Mexico
by one-tenth of a point," he said. "They're going to be
ready for us, believe that."
