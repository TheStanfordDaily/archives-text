### MARK LEMLEY Staff writer 
Two Stanford students have been se
lected to study Russian this summer in
a program at Leningrad State Univer
sity.
Karl Hall, a junior in math sciences
and history, and Dave Ritsher, a sopho
more in anthropology, were among 125
students selected nationwide to partici
pate in a program sponsored by the

Council for International Educational
Exchange (CIEE), a non-profit group
that says it attempts to increase mutual
understanding through the exchange of
ideas.
"It makes sense to try to understand
the other great power and the people
who live there," said Ritsher when asked
why he wanted to visit the Soviet Union.
"Studying (that country) from far away
is just not the same."
Students apply to the program

through one of five schools, depending
on where they live. Hall applied through
the University of Washington and Rit
sher applied through Dartmouth Col
lege.
All candidates submit an application,
which includes essays in both English
and Russian, and recommendations.
They must also take a two-hour exam
testing Russian grammar and language
capability. Ritsher described the
exam as grueling, saying,
"everyone failed."
On June 18. the students will fly
to Helsinki, Finland, for an orien
tation. From there, they will travel
to Leningrad to begin coursework
at the university.
Program participants will study
Russian grammar, phonetics.

conversation and literature in
depth for six weeks. They will
return to the United States Au
gust 18.
Students are required to sign an
agreement saying that they will
speak nothing but Russian
everywhere except in their dorm
rooms. Those caught speaking
English may be expelled from the
program and sent home at their
own expense.
Students take classes in the
morning and are left to themselves
in the afternoons. Ritsher specu
lated that the Soviet government
would try to occupy as much of

their time as possible. He said he
"hopes to get out of the (official)
schedule" and see other parts of
Leningrad. "I want to see the side
of Soviet life they don't want us to
see." he added.
The schedule calls for partici
pants to take weekend trips to
cities around Leningrad such as
Novgorod. After completion of the
program, the group will take a
two-week trip across the Russian
countryside. The itinerary in
cludes Moscow. Odessa. Tbilisi
and Riga, it no longer includes
Kiev, a large city near the site of
the Chernobyl accident last year.
