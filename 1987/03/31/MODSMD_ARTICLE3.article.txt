Two Stanford students have been se
lected to study Russian this summer in
a program at Leningrad State Univer
sity.
Karl Hall, a junior in math sciences
and history, and Dave Ritsher, a sopho
more in anthropology, were among 125
students selected nationwide to partici
pate in a program sponsored by the

Council for International Educational
Exchange (CIEE), a non-profit group
that says it attempts to increase mutual
understanding through the exchange of
ideas.
"It makes sense to try to understand
the other great power and the people
who live there," said Ritsher when asked
why he wanted to visit the Soviet Union.
"Studying (that country) from far away
is just not the same."
Students apply to the program

through one of five schools, depending
on where they live. Hall applied through
the University of Washington and Rit
sher applied through Dartmouth Col
lege.
All candidates submit an application,
which includes essays in both English
and Russian, and recommendations.
They must also take a two-hour exam
testing Russian grammar and language
