## 
### WITOLD HENISZ 
The Stanford cycling team has rebounded strongly
from a weak showing at the UC-Irvlne Criterium over
a month and a half ago.
At Irvine, Cal Poly-San Luis Obispo scored a
remarkable 245 points. Stanford, which did not
bring a full team, suffered in the standings.
At the Sonoma State University Criterium three
weekends ago, Stanford outscored rival Cal Poly 216
to 177. Third-place California barely managed to
score half Stanford's total.
In the men's A' race, Stanford dominated the field.
Bob Borchers controlled the pace throughout the
race and was Instrumental in the Stanford victory.
Interspersed in all crlteriums are a number of
"preem" sprints. These sprints keep the pace of the
races high and allow sprinters to bring home
numerous points for their team.
With Borchers' help, Tom Moyer won every preem
but one. The other was taken by Stanford rider Brian
Bauer. Mike Collins and Brad Chen also scored in a
number of the sprints.
At the finish, Moyer's rear wheel skidded out from
under him, leaving him out of contention for the vic
tory. However. Collins came around and outsprinted
the field for the win. Moyer still finished third with
Chen close behind in fifth place.
In the men's 'B' field. Brock La Porte, with the help
of Scott Evans, scored in every preem and never left
the front of the pack.

At the finish, the Stanford team regrouped and
came across the line in mass. Evans. La Porte and
Hank Dart all placed.
The women worked hard and looked strong. Jenni
fer Hubbert took second place. She was closely fol
lowed by Laura Rodman in fourth and Michelle
Stubbs In ninth.
Two weeks ago. the Stanford team traveled to Cal
for a two-day race. On Saturday, the race was on a
17-mile loop in the Berkeley hills.
The Stanford A' team held together in a three-lap
51-mile race of attrition. Moyer won by outsprinting
a Cal Poly rider in the last 200 yards.
The women's race wore down the Stanford squad,
but Cardinal bikers still managed to finish in 10th,
11th and 13th places.
The next day the team rode in the Berkeley
Criterium. The course is a short 0.4-mile loop in the
center of town and boasts a long gradual climb.
Moyer once again led the Stanford team with his
third-place finish. He sprinted for points in all but
one of the preems. In the B' race, La Porte once
again took on the competition and collected the most
points of any individual In the race. He finished in
third place, followed closely by Dart In sixth.
Olsen again took second in the 'C' race, this time
by only inches.
Rodman and Hubbert rode well and collected
eighth and ninth places for the Stanford women's
team.
