# University denies USW allegations
## 
### A.J. THOMAS Staff writer 
Spokesmen for University and the San Mateo
County Narcotics Task Force yesterday denied allega
tions by the United Stanford Workers union(USW)
that the task force illegally assisted Stanford in pre
paring for an upcoming labor arbitration.
On March 10, the USW filed a claim with the San
Mateo County Board of Supervisors alleging that the
task force unlawfully provided confidential criminal
justice information to the University concerning the
investigation of Larry Reid. an employee at the Stan
ford Linear Accelerator Center (SLAC). The claim
seeks $100,000 in damages.
Reid was fired last summer after he had been cited
for the misdemeanor theft of a dictaphone during an
undercover narcotics investigation led by the task
force. The charges against him were later dropped,
and his dismissal will be reviewed in an arbitration
scheduled for April 8.
A USW spokesman charged yesterday that the task
force supplied information to the University in order
to assist it in preparing for that arbitration because
of anti-labor collusion between the two.
That spokesman. Bill DiVita, said he has learned
from a "source I can't name" that the task force pro
vided the University with information concerning
how the Reid investigation was conducted, the pre
liminary questioning of Reid, the type of surveillance
equipment used and the basis for the task force's
decision to withdraw the case against Reid.
But according to Lt. Alan Johnson of the task
force, Stanford is "entitled under California law and
the Freedom of Information Act to have the docu
ments they were provided with because they were the
victims of a crime."
The USW is "confused about the role governmental
entities play" in labor disputes, Johnson said.
It is the task force's policy not to get involved in any
collateral legal proceedings such as labor disputes.
Johnson explained. "We are not concerned with in
ternal affairs" between labor and management, he
said.
