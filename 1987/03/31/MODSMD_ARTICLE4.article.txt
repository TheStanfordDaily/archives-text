# University denies USW allegations
## 
### A.J. THOMAS Staff writer 
Spokesmen for University and the San Mateo
County Narcotics Task Force yesterday denied allega
tions by the United Stanford Workers union(USW)
that the task force illegally assisted Stanford in pre
paring for an upcoming labor arbitration.
On March 10, the USW filed a claim with the San
Mateo County Board of Supervisors alleging that the
task force unlawfully provided confidential criminal
justice information to the University concerning the
investigation of Larry Reid. an employee at the Stan
ford Linear Accelerator Center (SLAC). The claim
seeks $100,000 in damages.
Reid was fired last summer after he had been cited
for the misdemeanor theft of a dictaphone during an
undercover narcotics investigation led by the task
force. The charges against him were later dropped,
and his dismissal will be reviewed in an arbitration
scheduled for April 8.
A USW spokesman charged yesterday that the task
force supplied information to the University in order
to assist it in preparing for that arbitration because
of anti-labor collusion between the two.
That spokesman. Bill DiVita, said he has learned
from a "source I can't name" that the task force pro
vided the University with information concerning
how the Reid investigation was conducted, the pre
liminary questioning of Reid, the type of surveillance
equipment used and the basis for the task force's
decision to withdraw the case against Reid.
But according to Lt. Alan Johnson of the task
force, Stanford is "entitled under California law and
the Freedom of Information Act to have the docu
ments they were provided with because they were the
victims of a crime."
The USW is "confused about the role governmental
entities play" in labor disputes, Johnson said.
It is the task force's policy not to get involved in any
collateral legal proceedings such as labor disputes.
Johnson explained. "We are not concerned with in
ternal affairs" between labor and management, he
said.
In order to investigate the al
leged misconduct, the USW
demanded that the task force give
the union all information and
documentation pertaining to the
Reid case.
But Johnson claimed all task
force documentation was already
available to Reid. "He has had the
opportunity to receive a copy of
every piece of paper involved in his
investigation." Johnson said.
Johnson explained that a copy
of the full police report was fur
nished to Reid's attorney at his ar
raignment. Johnson said that if
Reid had felt the information was
incomplete, he and his attorney
could have reviewed the actual
police file.
Michael Vartain, associate staff
counsel for Stanford, said the Uni

versity provided an additional
copy of the police report to the
USW several months ago upon the
union's request.
According to DiVita, further
evidence that the University and
police illegally collaborated is that
Stanford intends to have Special
Agent Michael Pugliese. the inves
tigating officer when Reid was
cited last summer, testify at the
review of Reid's dismissal. This
suggests that the University has
already spoken with Pugliese in
violation of state labor laws. Divita
said.
University officials are "highly
unlikely to call a witness they
haven't talked to previously," he
charged.
Johnson denied any collabora
tion with Stanford, labeling the
USW's accusations concerning in
terviews as "totally incorrect." The
only reason Pugliese is appearing
at the arbitration is because Stan

fnrH served him with a subpoena,
he said.
"If (the) USW would like our
agents to appear (at the arbitra
tion) or give a deposition they
should serve us with a subpoena,"
Johnson said. "It appears that
we're arbitrating in the
newspapers." he added.
Vartain voiced similar senti
ments. saying the union is at
tempting to "cloud the issue" with
its claim.
"I think the union has been
talking about everything but
whether the employee committed
the misconduct," Vartain said.
"I'm very distressed to learn that
USW is trying to discourage a law
enfocement agency from reporting
information to the victim of a
crime." Vartain continued.
"I don't think they want the
police to come to the arbitration
and fulfill their legal obligation of
testifying about facts they ob
served," he said.
