# Lyons takes medical leave
## 
### MARK LAWRENCE Senior staff writer 
Dean of Student Affairs James
Lyons has taken a three- to four
month leave of absence because of
a heart condition diagnosed in
physical examinations earlier this
month. Norm Robinson, associate
dean of Student Affairs, is serving
as acting dean.
A Student Affairs administra
tive assistant said Lyons' ailment
was not immediately life-threat
ening. The leave of absence was
recommended by a doctor In order
to give Lyons time to relax and to
prevent deterioration of his
health, said the administrator,
Nadine O'Leary.
Although Robinson assumes
the title of dean during Lyons' ab
sence, he will share some of the
dean's duties with Margaret Ann
Fidler, associate dean of Student
Affairs. Fidler will act as deputy
dean.
Robinson said he and Fidler will
try to carry out Lyons' agenda
without any major changes. But,
Robinson said, "Some things
won't get done as thoroughly or as
well."

O'Leary said physicians warned
Lyons about being overweight and
diagnosed a variety of cardiovas
cular problems, including hyper
tension. Lyons was out of town
yesterday and unavailable for
comment.
Robinson said Lyons will return
to his position in August at the
latest. Although Lyons will consult

with Student Affairs officials occa
sionally and continue to carry out
such duties as writing recommen
dations, Lyons' work will be "very,
very minimal," O'Leary said.
Robinson said Lyo"ns will not be
consulted on routine matters.
"We're really going to try to get
him to de-stress," Robinson said.
Robinson and O'Leary said
some matters may be delayed be
cause of Lyons' leave. It is likely,
Robinson said, that completion of
the long-awaited report on the fu
ture of Stanford fraternities will
be further postponed.
But, Robinson and Fidler said,
there should be no major prob
lems in carrying out the dean's
routine spring quarter duties.
"The main difference is that we
won't be able to go In there and
bounce ideas off him." Robinson
said.
Lyons, who is 54 years old, has
served as dean of Student Affairs
since he came to Stanford in
1972. He was dean of students at
Haverford College from 1962 to
1972 and assistant dean of stu
dents at Indiana University from
1959 to 1962.
