# Tresidder renovations are finally under way
## 
### DIANE BISGEIER Senior staff writer 
Changes which are under way in the
ASSU student offices mark the first stage
in major renovations and expansion for
Tresidder Union, according to Tresidder
officials.
In addition to ASSU office renovations.
Tresidder officials plan to:
□ Create an upstairs study area;
□ Expand the Union Crossroads dining
area;
□ Double of the size of the Coffee House
by moving it to the LOTS II location; and.i Construct
□.iConstruct a one-and-one-half story
office area on the Tresidder deck.
"There are a number of things in prog
ress." said acting Tresidder Director Paul
Szczesiul. Currently under way is there

placement of walls, paint and carpeting
for the ASSU offices, which should be
completed within the next two weeks, ac
cording to junior Grant Winfrey, chair
man of the Tresidder Union Board, a Uni
versity committee.
The cost of the renovations for the
ASSU offices should "be just shy of
•90,000," Szczesiul said, adding that
these funds will come from ASSU
reserves.
Next, Tresidder officials plan to
renovate the upstairs lounge for "social
studying where you don't need to be in an
area where something is being sold or
served," Szczesiul said.
The lounge project will cost approxi
mately •80.000 and will be financed from
Tresidder Union reserves, he added.
At the same time, the Union Crossroads

dining area will be expanded with the
removal of two under-used meeting
rooms. The dining area will be cleaned up
and recarpeted.
Szczesiul said he hopes both projects
will be completed by the end of the sum
mer.
Last to be undertaken will be the addi
tion of the structure on the vacant deck
above LOTS 11. This proposal — estimated
to be cost between *2.5 and *4 million —
has been delayed due to difficulty in locat
ing funds. Winfrey said.
According to Winfrey, the addition will
temporarily house LOTS II until new
space is found, probably in the New West
Campus complex, which is due to be com
pleted in 1991. The area will then be used
to provide offices for student organiza
tions.

Under a current arrangement. LOTS II
can only remain on the lower level of Tres-
Idder until August 1988. Its removal
"would allow us to start the renovations of
the new Coffee House, which would move
into that space and be at least double its
current size," Szczesiul said.
Szczesiul said he is uncertain about the
cost of the Coffee House renovation as
well as how it will be funded. "We hope to
get some University general funds, and
possibly some borrowing because the Cof
fee House has the ability to pay It back,"
he said.
"The Computer Science Department
can pick up a significant portion" of the
project's cost, according to Carey White, a
member of the Council of Presidents.
White added that the ASSU lobbied force
fully for the addition.

"Tresidder is 25 years old and, aside
from some renovation done in the early
1980s, this will be the first real expansion
done," White said.
Three years ago, a *500,000 project im
proved the banking area and travel and
meeting rooms.
Plans for the current renovations and
expansions date back to 1982, when the
Tresidder Union Board consulted Spencer
Associates, a Palo Alto architectural firm,
to examine the student union to see how
space could be best used.
"We've been discussing the possibility
of deferred maintenance and construc
tion of this place for some time," said
White. "At some point it's important to
realize that your needs change."
