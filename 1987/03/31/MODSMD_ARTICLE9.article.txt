Embassy guards recalled
WASHINGTON — The State Department yesterday announced
that the entire 28-man Marine guard detachment at the U.S. em
bassy In Moscow has been recalled to the United States as part of
the investigation Into alleged espionage by two guards last year.
"This measure Is precautionary In nature and Is Intended to
facilitate an Investigation of the security program at the U.S. em
bassy." State Department spokesperson Phyllis Oakley said.
"There is no evidence that any of the returning Marines are im
plicated In any wrongdoing." she added.
Oakley said this was the first time In the 39-year history of
Marine security duty at U.S. embassies around the world that an
entire detachment had been recalled. It seemed to underscore the
deep concern among administration officials about what Is
emerging as one of the worst security breaches ever at a U.S. em
bassy.
Meanwhile, U.S. officials said the communications system at
the Moscow embassy has been largely shut down and that every
thing but routine message traffic Is now being carried by mes
senger to Frankfurt, West Germany.
"You have to assume that everything has been compromised,"
said one official. "You Just don't know."
U.S. officials said the Immediate objective was to create "a se
cure environment" at the embassy by April 13 when Secretary of
State George Shultz arrives In Moscow for talks with Soviet
Foreign Minister Eduard Schevardnadze. But they were doubtful
whether this could be accomplished In two weeks.
Thatcher proposes compromise
MOSCOW — British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher pro
posed a compromise in the dispute between the United States and
the Soviet Union over their space defense programs in a meeting
here yesterday with Kremlin leader Mikhail Gorbachev. Under her
proposal, the two countries would pursue an arms control agree
ment without sacrificing research plans for anti-missile systems.
In a dinner speech. Thatcher asked that both sides disclose
timetables for their space defense research while making a com
mitment not to withdraw from the 1972 Antlballlstic Missile
(ABM) Treaty for a specific duration.
It was the only new arms bid made during nearly nine hours of
public and private discussion at the Kremlin between Thatcher
and Gorbachev. Their day of debate was characterized by acute
differences over human rights, the Afghanistan war and the
plausibility of nuclear deterrence.
Thatcher, declaring that "there Is no reason why such
(weapons) reductions should be made to depend on limitations on
the U.S. research program on space defense." suggested that the
two superpowers set aside their bitter division over the Reagan
administration's Strategic Defense Initiative, which has blocked
progress toward an arms agreement.
"I do not think that there will ever be a complete defense against
strategic nuclear weapons," she said. "But we cannot foreclose on
the chance that defenses could make a valuable contribution to a
more stable relationship."
Thatcher then called for "a timetable spelling out the planned
research programs of both parties, supported by a commitment
not to withdraw from the ABM treaty for a fixed period."
A British official indicated yesterday that the United States was
advised that Thatcher would raise the proposal here. Thatcher
discussed the Idea with seniof State Department arms control ad
viser Paul Nitze and Assistant Secretary of Defense Richard Perle
during their trip to London earlier this month, U.S. officials said.
Thatcher also consulted personally with West German Chancel
lor Helmut Kohl and French President Francois Mitterrand last
week In preparation for her meetings with Gorbachev.
World stock prices dip sharply
WASHINGTON — Escalating economic disputes between the
U.S. and Japan battered stock and bond prices around the world
yesterday, giving the Dow Jones Industrial average Its third-worst
licking ever as worried investors cashed in their profits.
Stock prices plunged in Tokyo. London and New York, where a
massive sell-off began when the market opened and drove the Dow
Jones average down as much as 80.5 points within the first hour.
The selling subsided later in the day. but the market remained
strongly on the down side.
The closely watched Dow Jones average closed at 2278.4 1. down
57.39 points.
The stock market as a whole lost *66.7 billion in value, as mea
sured by the Wllshirc Associates' index of 5.000 stocks.
Visions of a trade war with Japan, coupled with the precipitous
drop in the value of the dollar against the Japanese yen. raised
fears that U.S. Interest rates will rise and Inflation will heat up.
The powerful bull market, which has seen stock prices move to
all-time highs, has been fueled by falling interest rates and low in
flation. Thus, suggestions that Interest rates and inflation might
reverse their direction were enough to send Investors Into a selling
panic.
"There is a general feeling that the market was looking for an
excuse to take profits." said Robert H. Stovall of Stovall-21st Ad
visers.
Newton Zlnder. a market analyst for E.F. Mutton, said, "People
get nervous when they have profits, and everybody tried to get
through the door at once." Me said trade and currency problems
were uppermost In investors' minds.
"The only way to stem the decline In the dollar may be to raise
Interest rates, and that Is anathema to the stock market." he said.
The stage for Monday's drop was set on Friday by a 36.79 loss In
the Dow. at the end of a wobbly week. The fall of the dollar and the
U.S. battle against Japanese trade actions on computer chips, set
off heavy selling of U.S. bonds In New York and in overseas
markets.
Televangelist credibility down
LOS ANGELES — The appeal and credibility of television
preachers has been badly damaged In the aftermath of the fall of
PTL chairman Jim Bakker and the resulting controversy, a Los
Angeles Times Poll has found.
The nationwide survey, conducted last weekend, found that
fundamentalists, Pentecostals and other Christians agreed that
they will watch television evangelists less, believe them less and
contribute less money to their ministries.
The results contrast sharply with a similar poll taken eight
months ago. when nearly half those polled said they had watched
television evangelists or sent them money within the previous 30
days. In last weekend's poll, only a third of the respondents an
swered similarly.
According to the new survey, the preachers In the nation's *2
bllllon-a-year television ministries are perceived as being more
greedy than other clergy, more hypocritical, and less religious.
The ratings of Bakker. Oral Roberts and Jimmy Swaggart suf
fered the most, but others, including Pat Robertson, were also ad
versely affected The public esteem of Billy Graham, Jerry Falwell
and Robert Schuller was least affected.
The unfavorable Impressions of Bakker shot up 35 percentage
points since the July poll. During the same period, dislike for
Roberts rose 26 points and for Swaggart 15 points.
Bakker. admitting a sexual liaison with a 20-year-old New York
church secretary In 19H0 and the paying of •265.000 to keep It
quiet, resigned on March 19 and turned over control of his *172
million PTL empire In South Carolina to Falwell. the fundamen

yesterday, giving the Dow Jones Industrial average Its third-worst
licking ever as worried investors cashed in their profits.
Stock prices plunged in Tokyo. London and New York, where a
massive sell-off began when the market opened and drove the Dow
Jones average down as much as 80.5 points within the first hour.
The selling subsided later in the day. but the market remained
strongly on the down side.
The closely watched Dow Jones average closed at 2278.4 1. down
57.39 points.
The stock market as a whole lost *66.7 billion in value, as mea
sured by the Wllshirc Associates' index of 5.000 stocks.
Visions of a trade war with Japan, coupled with the precipitous
drop in the value of the dollar against the Japanese yen. raised
fears that U.S. Interest rates will rise and Inflation will heat up.
The powerful bull market, which has seen stock prices move to
all-time highs, has been fueled by falling interest rates and low in
flation. Thus, suggestions that Interest rates and inflation might
reverse their direction were enough to send Investors Into a selling
panic.
"There is a general feeling that the market was looking for an
excuse to take profits." said Robert H. Stovall of Stovall-21st Ad
visers.
Newton Zlnder. a market analyst for E.F. Mutton, said, "People
get nervous when they have profits, and everybody tried to get
through the door at once." Me said trade and currency problems
were uppermost In investors' minds.
"The only way to stem the decline In the dollar may be to raise
Interest rates, and that Is anathema to the stock market." he said.
The stage for Monday's drop was set on Friday by a 36.79 loss In
the Dow. at the end of a wobbly week. The fall of the dollar and the
U.S. battle against Japanese trade actions on computer chips, set
off heavy selling of U.S. bonds In New York and in overseas
markets.
Televangelist credibility down
LOS ANGELES — The appeal and credibility of television
preachers has been badly damaged In the aftermath of the fall of
PTL chairman Jim Bakker and the resulting controversy, a Los
Angeles Times Poll has found.
The nationwide survey, conducted last weekend, found that
fundamentalists, Pentecostals and other Christians agreed that
they will watch television evangelists less, believe them less and
contribute less money to their ministries.
The results contrast sharply with a similar poll taken eight
months ago. when nearly half those polled said they had watched
television evangelists or sent them money within the previous 30
days. In last weekend's poll, only a third of the respondents an
swered similarly.
According to the new survey, the preachers In the nation's *2
bllllon-a-year television ministries are perceived as being more
greedy than other clergy, more hypocritical, and less religious.
The ratings of Bakker. Oral Roberts and Jimmy Swaggart suf
fered the most, but others, including Pat Robertson, were also ad
versely affected The public esteem of Billy Graham, Jerry Falwell
and Robert Schuller was least affected.
The unfavorable Impressions of Bakker shot up 35 percentage
points since the July poll. During the same period, dislike for
Roberts rose 26 points and for Swaggart 15 points.
Bakker. admitting a sexual liaison with a 20-year-old New York
church secretary In 19H0 and the paying of •265.000 to keep It

Embassy guards recalled
WASHINGTON — The State Department yesterday announced
that the entire 28-man Marine guard detachment at the U.S. em
bassy In Moscow has been recalled to the United States as part of
the investigation Into alleged espionage by two guards last year.
"This measure Is precautionary In nature and Is Intended to
facilitate an Investigation of the security program at the U.S. em
bassy." State Department spokesperson Phyllis Oakley said.
"There is no evidence that any of the returning Marines are im
plicated In any wrongdoing." she added.
Oakley said this was the first time In the 39-year history of
Marine security duty at U.S. embassies around the world that an
entire detachment had been recalled. It seemed to underscore the
deep concern among administration officials about what Is
emerging as one of the worst security breaches ever at a U.S. em
bassy.
Meanwhile, U.S. officials said the communications system at
the Moscow embassy has been largely shut down and that every
thing but routine message traffic Is now being carried by mes
senger to Frankfurt, West Germany.
"You have to assume that everything has been compromised,"
said one official. "You Just don't know."
U.S. officials said the Immediate objective was to create "a se
cure environment" at the embassy by April 13 when Secretary of
State George Shultz arrives In Moscow for talks with Soviet
Foreign Minister Eduard Schevardnadze. But they were doubtful
whether this could be accomplished In two weeks.
Thatcher proposes compromise
MOSCOW — British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher pro
posed a compromise in the dispute between the United States and
the Soviet Union over their space defense programs in a meeting
here yesterday with Kremlin leader Mikhail Gorbachev. Under her
proposal, the two countries would pursue an arms control agree
ment without sacrificing research plans for anti-missile systems.
In a dinner speech. Thatcher asked that both sides disclose
timetables for their space defense research while making a com
mitment not to withdraw from the 1972 Antlballlstic Missile
(ABM) Treaty for a specific duration.
It was the only new arms bid made during nearly nine hours of
public and private discussion at the Kremlin between Thatcher
and Gorbachev. Their day of debate was characterized by acute
differences over human rights, the Afghanistan war and the
plausibility of nuclear deterrence.
Thatcher, declaring that "there Is no reason why such
(weapons) reductions should be made to depend on limitations on
the U.S. research program on space defense." suggested that the
two superpowers set aside their bitter division over the Reagan
administration's Strategic Defense Initiative, which has blocked
progress toward an arms agreement.
"I do not think that there will ever be a complete defense against
strategic nuclear weapons," she said. "But we cannot foreclose on
the chance that defenses could make a valuable contribution to a
more stable relationship."
Thatcher then called for "a timetable spelling out the planned
research programs of both parties, supported by a commitment
not to withdraw from the ABM treaty for a fixed period."
A British official indicated yesterday that the United States was
advised that Thatcher would raise the proposal here. Thatcher
discussed the Idea with seniof State Department arms control ad
viser Paul Nitze and Assistant Secretary of Defense Richard Perle
during their trip to London earlier this month, U.S. officials said.
Thatcher also consulted personally with West German Chancel
lor Helmut Kohl and French President Francois Mitterrand last
week In preparation for her meetings with Gorbachev.
