# Computer crash forces re-registration

### DAN DeLUCE Editorial staff 
Students must re-register tomorrow
due to a major breakdown in the Univer
sity computer system that resulted in the
loss of one-half to three-fourths of all reg
istration information, the Registrar's Of
fice announced yesterday.
Both undergraduates and graduates
must pick up special registration materi
als in Old Union today between 9 a.m. and
5 p.m. The order in which students turn
in their forms will determine when they
register at Maples Pavilion tomorrow,
University Registrar Sally Mahoney said.
The Registrar's Office has set up the fol
lowing procedure:
□ Pick up special registration materials
in Old Union and fill them out. Students

must bring valid Stanford identification.
□ Registration will follow the order in
which the forms are returned. The first to
turn in their forms will register first, etc.
□ Register in Maples Pavilion tomorrow
at assigned time. Last names beginning A
to L enter through East door, M to Z enter
through West door.
□ Sign up for all athletic courses in Roble
Gym.
A special telephone hotline has been set
up for students with questions about this
procedure; for information, call 723-2554
or 723-2635.
"Just when we thought we had con
quered registration problems . . . this
happens," Mahoney said last night. "My
sincere apologies go out to the Stanford
community."
She said, however, that the Registrar's

Office is prepared to deal with the influx
of students. "We're just going to go back
to our old way of doing things and set up
tables in Maples. The biggest inconveni
ence isn't for us, but for the students."
Most students expressed disappoint
ment and even outrage at the inconveni
ence. "It proves the University bureau
cracy is incompetent. This simply
shouldn't happen." said Carey White, a
member of the ASSU Council of Presi
dents.
Junior Mike Pope also said he was irri
tated with the situation. "This whole
thing is just bunk," he said.
But at least one student said she saw
the special registration as an opportu
nity. "Now I can sign up for Psych 1 and
some other classes I wanted," said Ann

Marsh, who recently returned from
Stanford-in-Paris program.
The computer system, installed fall
quarter, was working smoothly until
Monday, when office workers noticed
serious irregularities when retreiving
data.
Specialists from Information Technol
ogy Services (ITS) have been working on
the problem since late yesterday,
Mahoney said. But as of last night,
specialists speculated that the informa
tion may be permanently lost and that the
system won't be working again for several
days."These computers will be down for
quite some time." said Edward Shaw, ITS
director.
The reason for the breakdown is still
unclear, according to ITS experts and the
Registrar's Office.
