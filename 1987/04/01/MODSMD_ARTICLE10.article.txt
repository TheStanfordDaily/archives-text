# Database now lists Stanford investments
## 
### JOHN POLLACK Senior staff writer 
A complete list of the corporations in which
Stanford currently invests — including those
companies that do business in South Africa —
is now available on the University's public
database, according to the University Trea
surer's office.
The list, officially called the Investments File,
also includes companies that are no longer in
Stanford's portfolio but which were at some
point In the past.
The file "provides an avenue for the Stanford
community to view the decision-making
process" concerning the University's invest
ments. according to Gary Malone, an official in
the Treasurer's office involved with the project.
The file — which lists more than 1,000 com
panies — contains specific information re
garding companies in Stanford's portfolio that

do business in South Africa, including their
compliance with the Sullivan Principles. The
Sullivan Principles, named for their author.
Rev. Leon Sullivan, are guidelines for promot
ing racial equality in the workplace in South
Africa.
Malone said the file should serve as an
"educational base" for the Stanford commu
nity, showing "who they (the companies) are
and what they're doing in South Africa."
Stacey Leyton. a member of Stanford Out of
South Africa (SOSA), acknowledged that the
existence of the file "is positive because it's
making the information more available," but
said that a public forum would be more educa
tional for the Stanford community.
"I'm not sure how useful it (the file) is going
to be for students." she said.
The file is located on Forsythe Hall's IBM
mainframe computer. It is administered by the

Investment Responsibility Task Force (IRTF)
in the Treasurer's office.
The IRTF conducts background research for
the Committee on Investment Responsibility
(C-IR), which in turn makes investment
recommendations to the Board of Trustees
concerning investment responsibility.
Malone said the file can be expanded to in
clude information about other issues of public
concern besides Stanford's investments in
companies that do business in South Africa.
Information about the file can be obtained
through the SOCRATES search system. The
file can be accessed through some terminals lo
cated in Meyer and Green Libraries, Sweet Hall
and the Career Planning and Placement Cen
ter. The file can also be accessed via SUnet ter
minals using individual computer accounts
that can be opened free of charge at various
University libraries.
