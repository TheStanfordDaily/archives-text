# Business school to help debtors

The Graduate School of Busi
ness last week became one of the
first business schools in the na

signed to help pay student loan
debts of graduates who go into
low-paying public service jobs.
"We hope that the program will
relieve some of the financial disin

jobs," said GSB Dean Robert
Jaedicke, who announced the pro
gram. "Business school graduates
who are interested in low-salaried
government and non-profit sector
jobs must often balance that with
the reality of paying back a sizable
debt after graduation."
The program will take effect
with the MBA students who

graduate this June and will also
retroactively cover all GSB alumni
who meet the requirements of the
program, according to a press
release from the GSB News Office.
Jaedicke said the program is
not a new idea.
"(The GSB) had a loan forgive
ness feature in the 19705, but it
was not heavily utilized,'' he said.
"That was at a time when several
public sector jobs increased in
salary."
The new program is partially a
response to the fact that "public
service wage levels have tapered
off in recent years," according to
Jaedicke.
"MBAs leave here with a pretty
heavy debt level, and this is an ef
fort to try to make that
