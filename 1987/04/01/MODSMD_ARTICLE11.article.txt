# Business school to help debtors
## 
### CHRIS MYERS Editorial staff 
The Graduate School of Busi
ness last week became one of the
first business schools in the na
tion to establish a program de
signed to help pay student loan
debts of graduates who go into
low-paying public service jobs.
"We hope that the program will
relieve some of the financial disin
centives of taking public service
jobs," said GSB Dean Robert
Jaedicke, who announced the pro
gram. "Business school graduates
who are interested in low-salaried
government and non-profit sector
jobs must often balance that with
the reality of paying back a sizable
debt after graduation."
The program will take effect
with the MBA students who

graduate this June and will also
retroactively cover all GSB alumni
who meet the requirements of the
program, according to a press
release from the GSB News Office.
Jaedicke said the program is
not a new idea.
"(The GSB) had a loan forgive
ness feature in the 19705, but it
was not heavily utilized,'' he said.
"That was at a time when several
public sector jobs increased in
salary."
The new program is partially a
response to the fact that "public
service wage levels have tapered
off in recent years," according to
Jaedicke.
"MBAs leave here with a pretty
heavy debt level, and this is an ef
fort to try to make that
manageable," he said.
As the program is set up, stu
dent loans will be partially for
given on a sliding scale that takes
into account the amount of the
loan and the yearly salary of
graduates in public service jobs.
A graduate who has a large stu
dent loan and a low-paying job will

receive the most assistance from
the GSB.
Under the terms of the program,
a GSB graduate who earns
$17,000 a year or less in a public
service job would have to pay a
maximum of 3 percent of that
salary toward repayment of the
student loans. A graduate with
the maximum allowable salary of
$35,000 a year would have to pay
7 percent of that salary toward
loan repayment.
The program covers all jobs in

the government or with non-profit
organizations, according to Susan
Gould, director of the GSB's
Public Management Program and
one of the developers of the loan
forgiveness program.
The loan forgiveness program
"certainly helps people to consider
career alternatives that they
otherwise wouldn't have because
of financial considerations," she
said.
Last year, half of the graduating
class of roughly 300 MBA students

took jobs with consulting or in
vestment banking firms, where
average starting salaries were,
respectively, $60,000 and
$48,500, according to the GSB
News Office.
Gould said that while the loan
forgiveness program would pro
vide some incentive for entry into
public sector postitions, there are
other changes that probably must
be made before there is a signifi
cant shift in public service entry
patterns.

"The other incentives probably
involve changes in the income
structure and in the perception
structure â€” how people view jobs
in the government and non
profits." she said.
Yale has also set up a loan
forgiveness program. Yale's
School of Management "just
started developing the program,"
according to a member of the
school's admissions staff. Harvard
Business School is also reportedly

working to set up a similar pro
gram.
Many law schools, including
those at Stanford and Harvard,
already have loan forgiveness pro
grams, according to the GSF3
release.
"It (the loan forgiveness pro
gram) may help some people who
are on the edge, who would like to
try something else," Gould said.
"It will encourage them to take
that plunge."
