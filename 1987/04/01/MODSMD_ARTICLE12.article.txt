# Shuttle aims at stopping DUI
## 
### JENNIFER SCHMID Staff writer 
A student-operated shuttle ser
vice set up to give rides to stu
dents who have too much to drink
at area parties or bars will start
this weekend.
According to junior Charlie
Ahern, president and founder of
the Stanford Student Safe Trans
portation Program, the service will
begin this Thursday. The service
will operate from 10 p.m. until
2:30 a.m., offering rides to stu
dents who feel they cannot drive
or walk safely home.
The program will be open
Thursday through Saturday every
week this quarter.
The service is not restricted to
students who have driven off
campus, said Fraternal Affairs Ad
viser Joe Pisano, who helped
Ahern, a Sigma Chi, set up the
program. Students at parties on
campus are welcome to use the
service, as are students who have
arrived at parties with friends but
later realize their friends may not
be able to drive home, said Pisano.
Ahern said the program will be
staffed this weekend by members
of his fraternity. In future weeks,
he said, other fraternities and
sororities will take turns running
the program on different nights.
Ahern said he encourages other
students to volunteer for the pro
gram in order to make it a cam
puswide effort.
During the program's hours,
the service will consist of two

drivers, two riders to help the
drivers get students home safely
and one dispatcher to take calls
and give directions. Volunteers
will work in shifts from either 10
p.m. until midnight or from mid
night until 2:30 a.m.
Ahern said he anticipates the
first months to be slow. But he
said he hopes students will use
the program once they are aware
of it.
He said an instruction session
will be held today at 5 p.m. at the
Sigma Chi house to teach mem
bers basic procedures and first
aid. Ahern said any student may
attefnd the session and join the
program.
Ahern said he organized the
Safe Transportation Program, or
"STOP", because he felt there was
a need for the service on campus.
According to statistics provided
by Stanford Police Chief Marvin
Herrington, there has been an
average of 105 drunk-driving ar
rests a year on campus over the
last five years. There were never
more than 50 in any year before
1982 and only about 15 or 29 a
year in the early 19705, according
to Herrington.
Pisano said that the program
could be a great service, but that
its success depends on the willing
ness of students to use it.
The program will be funded by a
loan from the ASSU this year, and
will be on the ballot for funding
next year. Ahern said.
The phone number for Safe
Transportation is 327-STOP.
