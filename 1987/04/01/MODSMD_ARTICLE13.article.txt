Fourteen Stanford students returned
Monday from a 10-day trip to El Salvador,
where they saw the reality behind newspa
per headlines and learned from human
rights leaders and other Salvadorans the
devastating effect of incessant civil war.
"You see people who look oppressed yet
whose immense conviction for social justice
rides over everything. They really believe in
what they want." said Gayatri Tahiliani. a
junior.
Tahiliani and the rest of the Stanford
group traveled to El Salvador during spring
break partly to help rebuild the National
University in San Salvador, which was
heavily damaged by last October's
earthquake, but more importantly to find
out what is happening behind the rhetoric
of East-West struggle.
"Every group we talked to. except for the
government and the U.S. embassy, defined
the war as a class struggle, not an East-
West struggle." said junior Karen Marangi.
"It is a class struggle of the poor to get social
justice and a true democracy from a very
small oligarchy that has military backing."
During the trip, the students met with a

wide range of people in an effort to form an
objective opinion. In addition to meeting
human rights crusaders and campesinos,
they visited high-ranking officials in the
Salvadoran government and military, and
officers in the U.S. embassy.
Students called their determination to
discover the truth the reason they put up
with the inconveniences of traveling in the
war-torn country, including a 10-hour wait
in the San Salvador airport when they
arrived. Only a phone call from University
President Donald Kennedy to the U.S. em
bassy in San Salvador conveying his reluc
tance to involve Secretary of State George
Shultz resolved the situation.
Patrick Jean-Pierre, a senior, said. "The
(Salvadoran) government did not want us to
enter the country and see what was going
on. They were afraid of us because we are
used to listening. It's easy to discredit
someone carrying a pistol but not open
people."
The students seemed deeply impressed by
the resilience of the Salvadorans despite
daunting odds. Trips to two repopulated
villages and a political prison revealed the
people's rugged determination and fear of

the military, the students said.
"Malnutrition and poor health
are everywhere, but they keep
going," Jean-Pierre said. "I
learned the value of life and com
passion. The people are able to
summon courage within them
selves."
Students were equally amazed
at the ruthlessness of the govern
ment. The U.S. policy of support
ing the regime drew especially
strong criticism from the group.
"Democracy there is a farce â€”
people are forced to vote. The
name of a democracy is a complete
facade. I don't think people know
the extent of the social injustice."
said Tahiliani.
