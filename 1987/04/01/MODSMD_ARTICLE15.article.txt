Judge settles Baby M case
HACKENSACK, N.J. — A state judge awarded full custody of
Baby M to her father yesterday, stripping the surrogate mother of
all legal parental rights in the emotional landmark custody case.
Ruling that the surrogacy contract was "valid and enforceable."
Superior Court Judge Harvey Sorkow arranged for the father's
wife immediately to adopt the healthy one-year-old infant in his
chambers.
The judge's decision is the nation's first on the legality of sur
rogate parenting contracts and will have implications in state
legislatures, courtrooms, churches and bedrooms across the
country. Lawyers for the surrogate mother, Mary Beth Whitehead,
said they would immediately file an appeal.
The ruling makes no provision for Whitehead or her parents,
who also had asked for visitation rights, ever to see the child
again. Sorkow called his 121-page decision "an extraordinary jud
icial remedy" and he took more than three hours to read it to the
tense, packed courtroom.
"Parental rights of defendant Mary Beth Whitehead are ter
minated," Sorkow said, as a slight gasp went up in the court.
Sorkow awarded "sole custody" of the infant to the father,
William Stern, a 41-year-old biochemist from Tenafly, N.J. Stern
and his wife. Elizabeth, a 41-year-old pediatrician, had agreed to
pay Whitehead >10,000 to be artificially inseminated with Stern's
sperm and bear a child.
U.S. adviser killed in attack
SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador — Leftist guerrillas attacked a
major Salvadoran army base before dawn yesterday, killing at
least 43 soldiers and a U.S. military adviser, the first to die in com
bat during the country's seven-year civil war.
Thirty-five soldiers were wounded in the surprise assault on the
army's 4th Infantry Brigade, including the unit's commander,
Col. Gilberto Rubio, who was slightly injured on a hand.
Eight guerrillas of the Farabundo Marti National Liberation
Front were killed in the attack on the garrison at El Paraiso in
Chalatenango province, the military reported. The area, nearly 40
miles north of San Salvador, the capital, is considered a rebel
stronghold.
A guerrilla communique claimed that the army suffered 600
dead and wounded in the assault.
According to the military, an undetermined number of guerril
las attacked behind a barrage of artillery and mortar fire about 2
a.m., and some of them penetrated the camp itself. The American
adviser was killed by a mortar round, spokesmen said.
U.S. Embassy officials confirmed the death of the adviser, who
the Salvadoran military identified as Staff Sgt. Gregory Fronius,
27. of Paynesville, Ohio. Embassy spokesman Pendleton Agnew
said the American was one of 55 U.S. military trainers based at
important military installations throughout El Salvador.
U.S., France settle AIDS feud
WASHINGTON — Resolving a scientific feud that has soured re
lations between the world's leading AIDS researchers. President
Reagan and French Prime Minister Jacques Chirac announced
settlement yesterday of the longstanding dispute over who discov
ered the virus that causes the fatal disease.
The stakes in the international battle have been high because
along with credit for first recognizing the cause of AIDS will come
immense scientific glory, royalties for developing AIDS screening
tests and possibly medicine's most coveted honor, a Nobel prize.
Dr. Robert Gallo of the National Cancer Institute (NCI) and Luc
Montagnier of the Pasteur Institute in Paris, both eminent
virologists, have each laid claim to the discovery for their laborato
ries. The French filed several lawsuits after Gallo's laboratory ap
plied for patent rights.
In the end. Jonas Salk, the developer of the polio vaccine, served
as an informal arbitrator. Last week, Gallo and Montagnier flew to
Frankfurt, where they agreed to the deal.
The agreement assigns credit equally to the two labs for dis
covering the virus and developing the test to detect it.
"The two medical groups will share the patent, and each party
will contribute 80 percent of the royalties received to establish and
support an international AIDS research foundation." Reagan
said, speaking at an appearance with Chirac in the East Room of
the White House.
House overrides highway veto
WASHINGTON — The House voted 350-73 yesterday to override
President Reagan's veto of a >87.5 billion highway and mass tran
sit bill, sending the issue to a decisive showdown in the Senate
that could occur today.
Despite repeated appeals to his fellow Republicans by President
Reagan to kill the bill because of its cost, more than 100
Republicans and virtually the entire House GOP leadership defied
the White House. Rep. Norman Sisisky of Virginia, who said the
bill provided too little in highway funding for his state, was the
only Democrat who voted with the president.
In the Senate, the contest was considered extremely close as
both sides maneuvered furiously to pick up the one or two votes
needed to assure victory. A two-thirds vote — 67 if all senators are
present — is necessary to override a veto. Both houses must vote
to override or the veto is upheld.
The stakes In the showdown went beyond the five-year highway
and mass transit program as both sides portrayed it as a test of
strength between a president who has been weakened by the Iran
contra affair and an increasingly aggressive Democratic
controlled Congress.
Appealing to his colleagues to "stand united even if we lose."
Senate Majority Leader Robert C. Byrd. D-W.Va., was quoted as
telling a Senate Democratic caucus:
"If ever there was a time when Democrats needed to show
they're capable of governing, it is now . . . Any senator who is not
angry about the confrontational attitude of the White House is an
emotional eunuch."
Soviets react to recall of guards
MOSCOW — The chief Soviet foreign-policy spokesman yester
day made light of the withdrawal of the Marine guard contingent
at the U.S. Embassy, saying Washington fears finding "a red un
der every bed. "
"We can only smile at what is said about this story.' said
Foreign Ministry spokesman Gennadi Gerasimov. "It is really
funny that 28 staunch Marines are brought back from the U.S.
Embassy because they allegedly were unable to withstand the
charms of blond spies."
The withdrawal of the Marine contingent, announced Monday
In Washington, coincides with the investigation of three U.S.
Marines formerly posted in Moscow who are suspected of having
sexual affairs with Soviet women. Two have been accused of
giving KGB agents access to the embassy.
Gerasimov struck a light-hearted tone about the situation.
"We are very surprised at the announcement of the withdrawal."
he said, "signifying the defeat of the famous U.S. Marines who
were victorious at Grenada." a reference to the U.S.-led invasion of
the small Caribbean island in 1983.
Recently, we have witnessed a loss of capability to resist the
enemy." Gerasimov added, smiling. "And sometimes we fear that
there is a red under every bed. Now we see that we just have to
change the beds."
