# Alternate Western Culture course begins
## 
### LORI SILVER Staff writer 
After almost a year of student
protests and faculty debate over
its conception, the alternate West
ern Culture course became a
reality yesterday for History Prof.
Clay Carson and 104 students.
Carson opened the first day of
class with a lecture focusing on
the purpose of the course, which
will emphasize the contributions
of women and minorities to West
ern culture. He also discussed the
necessity of developing an alter
nate track and attacked the con
troversy surrounding the course.
Some faculty objected to the
course because they thought
"students would not be getting the
traditional education they should

be getting" and that "this course
was a way of substituting inferior
works for the great works" read in
the other tracks, Carson said.
"We need to rethink the values
that say one work is more valuable
than another work. More valuable
to whom? In whose eyes? There is
no absolute standard for judging
the quality or importance of a
work," Carson said.
He said the class Included a
higher proportion of blacks and
women than most classes, but he
said he hoped students in the pro
gram would not become
predominantly minorities.
"Our goal is not to have a
segregated curriculum," he said.
The class will only be offered
this quarter. A task force examin
ing the Western Culture issue

plans to submit a proposal for a
more permanent solution at the
Faculty Senate meeting next
week.
In his lecture yesterday, Carson
said education should incorporate
both traditional and non
traditional viewpoints, exposing
students to both sides.
"The concept of what is consid
ered education is always chang
ing,'' said Carson, noting that
education needs to prepare stu
dents to live in a multi-cultural
world.
Carson said he reluctantly
became involved in the Western
Culture controversy after talking
to a senior who was curious about
black history. Students have
graduated from Stanford without

reading anything by a black au
thor, he said.
Because most of the authors
read in the tracks are white males.
Western Culture ignores a major
component of the Western world,
Carson said.
Carson said his class received a
"warm reception" from students,
who applauded at the end.
"We're looking upon this course
as an experiment." Carson said.
He stressed the importance of stu
dents using discussion seminars
to criticize the course throughout
the quarter.
Carson's course includes three
lectures a week and two-hour dis
cussion sections led by Loren
Rusk, a doctoral candidate, and
former History Prof. Bing Howell.
