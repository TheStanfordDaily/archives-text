## THE STANFORD DAILY An Independent Newspaper LOTS should move
### 
As the long-awaited renovations of Tresid
der Memorial Union get under way, attention
is easily drawn to the one facility that has
done more to sabotage the improvement of
Tresidder than any other: LOTS 11. It is an
outrage that a Computer Science Depart
ment facility occupies prime space in the stu
dent union, and that there are no plans to
move it in the near future.
A complicated plan to play musical chairs
with the Coffee House, the Corner Pocket
and The Store was thwarted earlier this year
by LOTS 11. which occupies the former
bowling alley to which the Coffee House was
scheduled to move. University officials
claimed there was no other space on campus
to locate the computer facility.
Now, a plan is in the works to enclose the
patio on Tresidder's second floor to create
student office and meeting space. But LOTS
II plans to move into at least some of that
space and probably won't leave until the new
Near West Campus is built in the early
19905.

Here are some suggestions on where the al
batross could be located:
□ The LOTS facility in Sweet Hall is not
crowded and could accommodate more com
puter users.
□ Any facility that now makes its home in
Sweet Hall has just recently vacated another
location, which could be used to house LOTS
11.
□ The Forum Room on the ground floor of
Meyer Library is large and rarely used.
Tresidder is our student union. It is meant
to be the location where students can con
gregate; it offers the only opportunity to
create viable student office and meeting
space. It should not, under any circum
stances, be used as a parking lot for an aca
demic facility that has no home.
A university with Stanford's endowment
and reputation should be able to find a loca
tion for its computer facilities in an aca
demic building, rather than encroaching on
the already woefully inadequate student un
ion.
