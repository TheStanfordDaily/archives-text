Nazi trial is
supposed to
be a reminder
In response to Michael Myers'
recent viewpoint regarding Israeli
justice (Daily, March 6), I agree
with George Veltatzie's letter that
The Daily "should reconsider its
column policy (regarding)
diatribe" (Daily, March 10).
Myers* lack of sensitivity is only
surpassed by his lack of knowl
edge. If his concerns are
legitimacy of proceedings, ex
tradition or venue, I'm certain
that Ivan Demjanjuk's Jewish
attorney would love to hear some
"sound" advice, or perhaps he is
just an "Israeli in sheep's cloth
ing."
The Israelis do Indeed have a
chip on their shoulder — it comes
from "imagining" that they are
surrounded by hostile enemies.
As far as the assertion that Is
raelis have the "taste of blood in
their mouth," that is rhetoric
chillingly reminiscent of
"Proclamations of the Elders of
Zion," but Myers wouldn't know
about that. He also wouldn't
know enough about Israel, nor its
judiciary, to make his insinua-

tions about a "kangaroo court."
Myers' idea of creating an inter
national body to try ex-Nazis is
only slightly preposterous. None
would be alive by the time his
grandiose scheme is imple
mented. In fact, in view of Myers'
proclaimed righteousness, I'm
surprised he doesn't insist on a
trial for Demjanjuk by his peers.
The trial is being conducted
precisely where it should be —
within the society against whom
the crimes were committed —
and in a setting where he can be
confronted by his accusers.
The trial is supposed to teach
Israeli youth about the Holocaust.
It should remind every human
being of what man is capable of
inflicting upon his fellow man. It
should be a refresher course in
remembering "never again."
A trip to Yad Vashem, the Is
raeli Holocaust Memorial, might
provide Myers with a more accu
rate point of reference. That the
Nazi crimes can be compared
with any other crime on the
"same philosophical plane," is
philosophical bullshit. Make no
mistake about it Myers — the
Nazi atrocities stand apart. They
provide a vision of a world gone
mad, of diabolical terror and
brutality.
