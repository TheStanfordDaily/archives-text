# March for education is praised
## 
### 
On April 6, only a week into spring quarter
for Stanford students, history will be made.
Thousands of students, teachers, parents and
community activists from all over the state will
converge in Sacramento on the Capitol to
march for educational rights. This march has
been called by statewide Third World net
works. It is occurring at a critical time in Cali
fornia's history, a time during which no per
son interested in having a quality education
system in California and the United States can
afford to simply watch events unfold from a
distance. Governor Deukmejian has proposed
a budget for this state that, according to Bill
Honig. the state superintendent of public in
struction. is an "outright disaster for the
schools."

MINYARD & STAUFFER

Consider the following facts about Deuk
mejian's proposed budget:
□ In order to save *60 million, it will eliminate
several state programs Including Economic
Impact Aid. Urban Impact Aid. Meade Aid. the
Miller-Unruh Reading Program. Gifted and
Talented Education, and Native American
Education.
□ The proposed increase in funding for grades
K through 12 is 2.4 percent, yet school enroll
ment In California is growing and the current
inflation rate is 3 percent.
□ The proposed increase for higher education
is 4 percent. In order to meet costs, Deuk
mejian also proposes to increase fees at Univer
sity of California schools by * 130 per semester,
increase fees at California State schools by 9
percent and institute fees for the first time ever
at community colleges.
□ The proposed budget will give a 10 percent
increase in funding to the prison system
versus the 4 percent allotment to schools.
If Deukmejian's budget passes, San Fran
cisco and Oakland school boards have already
indicated they would have to layoff over 500
teachers each. Other school systems would un
doubtedly have to follow their lead, yet Califor
nia is already 50th nationally in class size and
cannot afford any layoffs at all.
Deukmejian's budget is even more devastat
ing In the context of the national deprlorltlza
tlon of education under President Ronald
Reagan. Reagan's priorities are well demon
strated In his budget breakdown, where 1.5
percent of federal money goes to education

compared to 29 percent for military spending.
Over his two terms in office, Reagan has cut
federal support for education by 25 percent,
making it harder for students to get grants
and scholarships and thereby locking many
people out of higher education altogether.
Hardest hit by Reagan's and Deukmejian's
policies are minorities, many of whom already
receive inferior educations. Consider the fol
lowing facts:
□ More than one third of all California youth
and up to 80 percent of minority youth in ur
ban areas (such as East Palo Alto) fail to
graduate from high school.
□ 44 percent of black adolescents and 56 per
cent of Latino adolescents in the United States
are functionally illiterate because of an inade
quate public school education.
□ Between 1977 and 1983, black college en
rollment dropped by 20 percent. Between 1982
and 1984, Chicano college enrollment fell by
more than 25,000.
□ Reagan is calling for a <4 billion cut in stu
dent aid funds for the coming year.
□ Deukmejian vetoed the bilingual education
bill earlier this year, a veto that will hurt
thousands of immigrant Latinos and Asians in
California.
Stanford students are not immune from
Reagan and Deukmejian's education policies.
The government's practices of substituting
loan money for grant money means that more
Stanford students are leaving college with
larger debts. Most hard hit are working class
students, of whom a disproportionate number
are minorities. These students often cannot af
ford to risk the high cost of a Stanford educa
tion on getting a good job in an uncertain fu
ture economy. The result is that the much
lauded diversity at Stanford suffers and
working class students are denied their right
to the best possible education of their choice.
The diversity of Stanford's curriculum also
suffers because of our government's policies.
Currently money is being channelled in large
amounts into science and engineering re
search with military applications, at the ex
pense of basic research and at the great ex
pense of ethnic studies and humanities de
partments. This trend has coincided with col
lege administrations focusing on an increas
ingly ethnocentric curriculum within
humanities departments. Here at Stanford,
the Afro-American studies program has been
halved since the '60s and we still have no eth
nic studies programs about Chicano, native
Americans and Asian American cultures, even
though about 9 percent of Stanford students

are Asian American and California has a large
Chicano population.
Yet, we still have a yearlong Western Culture
requirement that pays minimal attention to
the lives and cultural heritage of at least 60
percent of the U.S. population — women and
minorities — and is similar to a program
eliminated at Stanford in 1968 after
widespread and prolonged student activism.
Today, the tight job market and increasing
loan burden forces more and more students at
Stanford to focus on getting a narrow techni
cal education at the expense of educational ex
ploration and experimentation.
On April 6, we will march on Sacramento to
put Deukmejian on notice that we want educa
tion at the top of the state's priorities. We have
many general demands, that include: more
funding for education; reinstatement of fund
ing for bilingual education; strengthening of
community colleges and transfer rights for
students from community colleges to four-year
colleges; equal access, recruitment and reten
tion at the four-year colleges for Third World
students; ethnic studies as a graduation re
quirement for all state-funded schools; and
student and community empowerment and in
put on decision making. These demands make
up a partial list and they will be accompanied
at the march by specific proposals and with
lobbying for specific bills in the legislature.
The issues we see before us this spring make
the march on Sacramento all the more urgent.
We will send a loud message that we intend to
secure for every resident of California the basic
human right to a quality, relevant education.
There we will put forward our vision of what a
fair and equitable education should be. At
Stanford, many people of many different back
grounds have already been preparing to send a
large contingent of people from here, and
buses are already being reserved. For Stanford
students interested in helping us organize the
march during this last week, interested in
going or Just Interested in finding out more,
there will be a general meeting of the Stanford
March on Sacramento Coalition this Wednes
day at noon in El Centro. Old Union, as well as
a table in White Plaza this week from 11 a.m.
to 1 p.m. Also, we have a table set up in the
Public Service Center with information and
sign up sheets on it. So make sure to mark
April 6th on your calendar to come participate
in an historical and critically important event
for the people in California.

larger debts. Most hard hit are working class
students, of whom a disproportionate number
are minorities. These students often cannot af
ford to risk the high cost of a Stanford educa
tion on getting a good job in an uncertain fu
ture economy. The result is that the much
lauded diversity at Stanford suffers and
working class students are denied their right
to the best possible education of their choice.
The diversity of Stanford's curriculum also
suffers because of our government's policies.
Currently money is being channelled in large
amounts into science and engineering re
search with military applications, at the ex
pense of basic research and at the great ex
pense of ethnic studies and humanities de
partments. This trend has coincided with col
lege administrations focusing on an increas
ingly ethnocentric curriculum within
humanities departments. Here at Stanford,
the Afro-American studies program has been
halved since the '60s and we still have no eth
nic studies programs about Chicano, native
Americans and Asian American cultures, even
though about 9 percent of Stanford students

are Asian American and California has a large
Chicano population.
Yet, we still have a yearlong Western Culture
requirement that pays minimal attention to
the lives and cultural heritage of at least 60
percent of the U.S. population — women and
minorities — and is similar to a program
eliminated at Stanford in 1968 after
widespread and prolonged student activism.
Today, the tight job market and increasing
loan burden forces more and more students at
Stanford to focus on getting a narrow techni
cal education at the expense of educational ex
ploration and experimentation.
On April 6, we will march on Sacramento to
put Deukmejian on notice that we want educa
tion at the top of the state's priorities. We have
many general demands, that include: more
funding for education; reinstatement of fund
ing for bilingual education; strengthening of
community colleges and transfer rights for
students from community colleges to four-year
colleges; equal access, recruitment and reten
tion at the four-year colleges for Third World
students; ethnic studies as a graduation re
quirement for all state-funded schools; and
student and community empowerment and in
put on decision making. These demands make
up a partial list and they will be accompanied
at the march by specific proposals and with
lobbying for specific bills in the legislature.
The issues we see before us this spring make
the march on Sacramento all the more urgent.
We will send a loud message that we intend to
secure for every resident of California the basic
human right to a quality, relevant education.
There we will put forward our vision of what a
fair and equitable education should be. At
Stanford, many people of many different back
grounds have already been preparing to send a
large contingent of people from here, and
buses are already being reserved. For Stanford
students interested in helping us organize the
march during this last week, interested in
going or Just Interested in finding out more,
there will be a general meeting of the Stanford
March on Sacramento Coalition this Wednes
day at noon in El Centro. Old Union, as well as
a table in White Plaza this week from 11 a.m.
to 1 p.m. Also, we have a table set up in the
Public Service Center with information and
sign up sheets on it. So make sure to mark
April 6th on your calendar to come participate
in an historical and critically important event
for the people in California.

On April 6, only a week into spring quarter
for Stanford students, history will be made.
Thousands of students, teachers, parents and
community activists from all over the state will
converge in Sacramento on the Capitol to
march for educational rights. This march has
been called by statewide Third World net
works. It is occurring at a critical time in Cali
fornia's history, a time during which no per
son interested in having a quality education
system in California and the United States can
afford to simply watch events unfold from a
distance. Governor Deukmejian has proposed
a budget for this state that, according to Bill
Honig. the state superintendent of public in
struction. is an "outright disaster for the
schools."

MINYARD & STAUFFER

Consider the following facts about Deuk
mejian's proposed budget:
□ In order to save *60 million, it will eliminate
several state programs Including Economic
Impact Aid. Urban Impact Aid. Meade Aid. the
Miller-Unruh Reading Program. Gifted and
Talented Education, and Native American
Education.
□ The proposed increase in funding for grades
K through 12 is 2.4 percent, yet school enroll
ment In California is growing and the current
inflation rate is 3 percent.
□ The proposed increase for higher education
is 4 percent. In order to meet costs, Deuk
mejian also proposes to increase fees at Univer
sity of California schools by * 130 per semester,
increase fees at California State schools by 9
percent and institute fees for the first time ever
at community colleges.
□ The proposed budget will give a 10 percent
increase in funding to the prison system
versus the 4 percent allotment to schools.
If Deukmejian's budget passes, San Fran
cisco and Oakland school boards have already
indicated they would have to layoff over 500
teachers each. Other school systems would un
doubtedly have to follow their lead, yet Califor
nia is already 50th nationally in class size and
cannot afford any layoffs at all.
Deukmejian's budget is even more devastat
ing In the context of the national deprlorltlza
tlon of education under President Ronald
Reagan. Reagan's priorities are well demon
strated In his budget breakdown, where 1.5
percent of federal money goes to education

compared to 29 percent for military spending.
Over his two terms in office, Reagan has cut
federal support for education by 25 percent,
making it harder for students to get grants
and scholarships and thereby locking many
people out of higher education altogether.
Hardest hit by Reagan's and Deukmejian's
policies are minorities, many of whom already
receive inferior educations. Consider the fol
lowing facts:
□ More than one third of all California youth
and up to 80 percent of minority youth in ur
ban areas (such as East Palo Alto) fail to
graduate from high school.
□ 44 percent of black adolescents and 56 per
cent of Latino adolescents in the United States
are functionally illiterate because of an inade
quate public school education.
□ Between 1977 and 1983, black college en
rollment dropped by 20 percent. Between 1982
and 1984, Chicano college enrollment fell by
more than 25,000.
□ Reagan is calling for a <4 billion cut in stu
dent aid funds for the coming year.
□ Deukmejian vetoed the bilingual education
bill earlier this year, a veto that will hurt
thousands of immigrant Latinos and Asians in
California.
Stanford students are not immune from
Reagan and Deukmejian's education policies.
The government's practices of substituting
loan money for grant money means that more
Stanford students are leaving college with
larger debts. Most hard hit are working class
