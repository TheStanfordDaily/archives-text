### MARTHA MOODY Staff writer 
A major sewage leak at the Kappa Alpha frater
nity house will prevent students from enjoying
Lagunita this spring, according to county health
officials.
University Operations and Maintenance offi
cials. alarmed by the amount of sewage in the
lake, called an inspector from the Santa Clara
County Health Department to examine the water
yesterday morning.
"The level of contamination is definitely high,"
said Santa Clara County Environmental Health
Inspector Bert Morris. "The sewage has caused a
major proliferation of protozoa. These organisms

can attach to the human intestine, causing acute
giardia."
Giardia is a severe form of diarrhea that re
quires medical treatment.
As of yesterday afternoon, Lagunita was offi
cially designated a danger to public health. Haz
ard signs will be posted later in the week, making
it illegal to enter the water. "We realize that this
may not be too popular with some people," Morris
said. "But believe me, anyone who gets into that
water will wish they had paid attention to the
warnings. The number of parasitic organisms in
the water make it almost a certainty that swim
mers can't come out of that water alone."
