# Theme houses discriminate
## 
### 
I am writing regarding the recent announce
ment to declare Hurlburt a theme house. Not
only am I opposed to theme houses of any sort,
but I am especially bothered by this particular
case. First of all. theme houses only serve to
ghetto-ize people who come from an array of
different backgrounds. I agree with Wyatt
Leung, who said,"our diverse student body is
not really a melting pot of people, but a collec
tion of groups" (Daily, March 6). I don't see
how theme houses serve to promote the diver
sity that Stanford claims to foster. I don't deny
the importance of group or ethnic identity, but
one would surely see that creating a bunch of
out-groups on campus will not pull people of
different backgrounds together, but apart.
Why must we label houses? So we can list
them on an inventory to prove that our Univer
sity is diverse?

It is terrific that people who share common
interests can live together in a house, even
have some good non-Food Service food, show
foreign films and host guest speakers, etc., but
priorities for these houses should be
abolished. Why should one person have any
more priority than another to live in an atmos
phere which emphasizes certain ideas?
Priorities only exclude others, like an electrical
engineering major, for example, who wishes to
live in the American studies house. Why
should an EE major have to take a class and
bring in a speaker just to live in a nice house?
Different attitudes, races and interests can

coexist here on campus without the useless
labeling of houses. Why this interest to
promote the idea of theme house proposals?
When will it all stop? What's wrong with
having plenty of generic houses that someone
can live in without having to declare a specific
affiliation?
Acting Dean of Student Affairs Norm Robin
son and Director of the Row Diana Conklin say
that all of the recent push for theme houses
has been in response to student needs.

But when asked why the residents of
Hurlburt were not consulted regarding the
choice to convert it into the Russian and East
European Studies house, Robinson and Con
klin replied that the committees "can't just be
consulting the students on everything."
Sounds like a contradiction to me, folks!
Even if you have yet to find validity in my ar
guments against theme houses, then consider
the current plan from an economic stand
point.
A couple of weeks ago, I had dinner with
Lucy Williams and Richard Daniels (Row
Facilities managers). When questioned about
Row house upkeep and repairs, such as paint
ing, plumbing and waste disposal, they were

hasty to announce that with their budget they
could "in no way" afford to paint Hurlburt
House (which needs a few new coats) for an
other 12 years. Nor could this budget afford
new garbage bins even though the current
ones are not large enough to hold the house's
trash.
I'd like to know how this very same budget
will allow for the creation of an RF apartment
in Hurlburt. There aren't even any bathrooms
on the third floor of the house but they're

going to make an RF apartment. According to
the present plan, this would eliminate at least
four student rooms. (I don't call that a commit
ment to housing University students!) The
cost of the remodeling is estimated by Robin
son and Conklin to be >10,000. Add to that the
loss of rent from four students, plus what the
University will pay the RF to live there, plus the
constant losses that will result unless facilities
are upgraded now, and the University will be
incurring a loss of well over >15,000. So why
can't the budget afford to upgrade Hurlburt, or
any other Row house? I don't think we need a
committee to sit and ponder that one!
