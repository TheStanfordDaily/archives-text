## 'Attractive' rates offered Alumni Association to give graduates a lot of credit 
### MORTY POSNER Editorial staff 
Starting this summer, it will be even easier to take
your Stanford education to the bank.
In mid-May, the Stanford Alumni Association will
sponsor an "affinity group" credit card program en
abling association members and current students to
apply for major credit cards. The program, handled
through Citicorp, is one of many being offered by
alumni associations and other groups across the
country as a marketing tool and a way to raise money
while providing a service to alumni.
According to Alumni Association Membership Di
rector Karen Letendre, the Stanford program will of
fer "attractive interest rates with annual fees at
tached."
"We did extensive research," Letendre said, noting
that the aim of the program is to provide "tangible
services that (alumni) can use if they live out of the
(Stanford) area."
Letendre said there would probably be no fee
during the first year of the program, as with many
other schools' programs. After the first year, an an
nual fee, of which the association will get a portion,
would be charged. "A very competitive interest
rate" will be charged, Letendre said, emphasizing
that the association has opted to negotiate an agree
ment with Citicorp, which offers a lower interest rate

but yields a lower rebate to the association.
"Our primary goal was not (set) from a fund
raising perspective," Letendre said. She said that the
association would "rather give people incentive to
use the card" by making the interest rate more at
tractive while still generating revenue for the associ
ation.
Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) in Pittsburgh
has just implemented a similar program with Visa
and Mastercard credit cards that charge a 17 percent
interest rate. Claralyn Goldberg, associate director of

alumni relations for CMU, said this rate is the lowest
of Pittsburgh area banks.
Cynthia Chaillie, marketing and membership di
rector of UCLA's alumni association, said mailings
for their credit card program went out yesterday and
that they are offering a choice of a variable interest
rate pegged to the prime rate or a fixed rate on their
First Interstate Bank cards. Chaillie said their
variable rate is also among the lowest available in
that area.

Unlike Stanford's program, which Is available only
to alumni association members, UCLA will make its
program available to all Its alumni. Chaillle said that
this move "broadens our market," allowing them to
received a percentage of a greater number of credit
card purchases.
In addition to CMU and UCLA, the University of
Pennsylvania, Brown and many University of Califor
nia campuses offer or are in the process of offering
similar programs as well.
Bonnie King, UC-Berkeley's alumni association
membership coordinator, said that Berkeley will em
bark on a credit card program in mid-May (at the
same time as Stanford's) because "the affinity credit
card program is really taking off (at universities). . .
everybody's doing it."
Letendre said that this program will be a way to get
more alumni to join the association. She pointed out
that there is generally a gap of about 20 years in the
activity of alumni members. Most alumni tend to join
within the first five years of graduation or much later
in their lives.
"The first five years are really critical. If we don't
get them then we may not get them at all," Letendre
said. "The graduate students tend not to have such
an affinity (toward Stanford)."
The Stanford credit cards will feature a four-color
photograph of the campus superimposed on the
card, Letendre said.
