## Card atones for loss by pummeling Gaels 
### TOM SENF Editorial staff 
Most of the 627 fans who showed up at Sunken
Diamond on a perfect baseball afternoon to watch
Stanford play St. Mary's yesterday expected an easy
Cardinal win.
They got it.
Behind the eight-hit pitching of Brian Keyser and
Mark Carper and a lightning 12-hit attack that in
cluded 10 singles and six stolen bases, the Cardinal
concluded a very successful March with a 10-0 vic
tory over the Gaels at Sunken Diamond.
The win upped Stanford's overall record to 23-9,
including a 12-1 mark during March. St. Mary's fell
to 12-18. It was the Gaels' fifth straight loss.
The Cardinal was just coming off a three-game
sweep of Arizona State and had not lost in a month
when it was pounded 10-3 on Monday by Nevada-Las
Vegas. "One of the things our team prides itself on is
to try to be mentally prepared every day," first
baseman Hon Witmeyer said. Stanford was not
prepared for the UNLV game, he added.
But any Gael hopes of another Cardinal letdown
were dashed early as Stanford dashed to a 6-0 lead
after two innings.
Ruben Amaro continued his impersonation of the
perfect leadoff hitter, this time with a walk and
stolen base in the first. After David Esquer walked,
Ed Sprague plated Amaro with a single to left. Doug
Robbins moved the runners up with a sacrifice bunt,
and Paul Carey drove in Esquer with a groundout.
Sprague then scored when Gaels' starter Sam
Colarusso uncorked a wild pitch.
In his four plate appearances yesterday, Amaro
reached base twice — about an average day for the
senior leftfielder. For the season. Amaro is hitting
.370 and has a .481 on-base percentage. He also
leads the team in runs scored with 41 and in steals
with 20.
Stanford scored three more times in the second,
with Amaro driving in one run with a fielder's choice
and Esquer knocking in two more with a two-run
single to left.
The early six-run lead was more than enough for
Keyser, who went the first six innings to record his

third win of the season against no defeats. Although
he allowed seven hits, the sophomore right-hander
walked just one while striking out five.
"They were free-swingers. They liked to hit the
fastball on the first pitch," Keyser said. "I was effec
tive when I could dump a first-pitch curveball in
there and they couldn't sit on any one pitch."
The Gaels did manage to put two threats together
against Keyser but could not break through. In the
third, St. Mary's had runners at second and third
with one out, but Keyser fanned Frank Welsh and
Joe Mlllette. In the fifth, the Gaels put runners at
corners with no outs, but two pop-ups and a ground
out later, another goose egg went up on the visitors'
side of the scoreboard.
Carper came on in the seventh and allowed just
one hit the rest of the way to record his second save
of the season.
Offensively, probably the most encouraging aspect
of yesterday's game for Stanford was the continued
resurgence of Witmeyer. After seeing his average dip
as low as . 129, Witmeyer has eight hits in his last 14
at-bats and is now at . 192.
Witmeyer went 2-for-3 yesterday, scoring a run in
the second, driving one in in the third with a
sacrifice fly and setting up another in the fifth with a
line-drive double off the first baseman's glove. Doug
Robbins knocked in the Cardinal's last two runs
with a double in the eighth.
"I hope it'll last for a while," Witmeyer said of his
four-game hot streak. "It (the slump) was a variety of
things. When you start going bad, you start chang
ing things and before you know it your head is a
mess."
Working with the Stanford coaches, Witmeyer
tinkered with his mechanics to find a more comfort
able hitting style, eventually deciding to open his
stance, drop his hands slightly and crouch more at
the plate. "I've got a quick bat again," he said.
"Before, I was jamming myself, even if the pitch
wasn't inside."
Stanford travels to Los Angeles this weekend to
meet USC in a three-game series beginning on
Friday. The Trojans were the early leaders in the
Pacific 10 Southern Division with a 6-1 record, but
have dropped five straight Six-Pac games-

of yesterday's game for Stanford was the continued
resurgence of Witmeyer. After seeing his average dip
as low as . 129, Witmeyer has eight hits in his last 14
at-bats and is now at . 192.
Witmeyer went 2-for-3 yesterday, scoring a run in
the second, driving one in in the third with a
sacrifice fly and setting up another in the fifth with a
line-drive double off the first baseman's glove. Doug
Robbins knocked in the Cardinal's last two runs
with a double in the eighth.
"I hope it'll last for a while," Witmeyer said of his
four-game hot streak. "It (the slump) was a variety of
things. When you start going bad, you start chang
ing things and before you know it your head is a
mess."
Working with the Stanford coaches, Witmeyer
tinkered with his mechanics to find a more comfort
able hitting style, eventually deciding to open his
stance, drop his hands slightly and crouch more at
the plate. "I've got a quick bat again," he said.
"Before, I was jamming myself, even if the pitch
wasn't inside."
Stanford travels to Los Angeles this weekend to
meet USC in a three-game series beginning on
Friday. The Trojans were the early leaders in the
Pacific 10 Southern Division with a 6-1 record, but
have dropped five straight Six-Pac games-
