# Spring break in frigid East for sailors
## 
### HUGH R. BETHELL Editorial staff 
Quite a few Stanford students spent last
week on the water, but not all of them were
having fun In the waves off Palm Beach or Fort
Lauderdale. For seven members of the Stanford
sailing team, vacation meant a trip to the not
so-inviting waterways of the Northeast, where
the 1987 Collegiate Sailing National Cham
pionships will be held later this spring.
As part of a training trip to the East Coast
over spring break, the Cardinal sailors spent
seven days practicing and competing against
some of the country's finest college sailing
teams in order to be better prepared for the up
coming nationals.
A sure sign that Stanford will be ready for the
championships came at the end of the week,
when Cardinal sailors scored several impres
sive performances during the competitive Bos
ton Dinghy Cup Regatta, in which the team
placed eighth.
Because Stanford sailors normally compete
only on the West Coast against West Coast
schools in a West Coast type of boat, they are
usually at a disadvantage when it comes time
to compete against the strong Eastern schools
on unfamiliar waters. Though the Cardinal did
have some difficulty adjusting during the week,
the team hopes to have gained enough experi
ence to be able to come back already warmed up
in May.
"The trip really allowed us to get comfortable
with the boats that we'll be using, and the area
we'll be sailing in during nationals. We took
care of all the little things that can really
hamper a team if they're not used to the area
that a regatta is being held in." Stanford Coach
Blake Middleton said.
"MIT was especially helpful to us during the
trip. Hatch Brown and Stu Nelson, their
coaches, let us use everything from a motor
boat to life jackets so that we could make the
most of our practice time. They helped us last
year, and I hope they'll help us again. They were
just incredibly cooperative and generous," Mid
dleton said.
At the weekend regatta. Stanford faced ex
tremely tough competition. Thirteen of the top
15 schools in the nation sent their best sailors.
"There were 110 marsh mallows. The fleet was
amazingly competitive." Middleton said.
Stanford started strong, holding fifth place
after the first day's racing. On the second day.
problems at the starts slowed the Cardinal
sailors down, and they dropped to a final finish
in eighth place. Other schools had similar
problems, as Boston University dropped from
first to sixth, and Yale went from third to
ninth. The field was strong enough that no
school was very consistent, team members
said. Harvard was just consistent enough to
take first, followed by Tufts and Kings Point.
Stanford did beat Georgia Tech and Yale,
both of which were ranked above the Cardinal
in the last national poll, so Stanford should
move up from its recent 10th place ranking.
"I think we're seriously underrated. By the
time we come back for nationals. I think we'll
be better prepared and more comfortable in the
boats. And that will mean that we'll have a real
shot at taking the national championship this
year." Jonathan Schreiber said
