# Netters prep for Six-Pac with shutout
## 
### JON WEISMAN Staff writer 
More than just the weather is
heating up for the Stanford men's
tennis team.
On a warm, hazy day at Stan
ford Tennis Stadium, the Card
inal raised its record to 9-5 with a
9-0 shutout of Washington. Stan
ford now appears primed for its
two Pacific 10 Southern Division
showdowns in balmy Los Angeles
this weekend, against third
ranked UCLA and No. 1 USC.
"I think we've done everything
we can to prepare for the part of
the season that is coming up,"
Stanford Coach Dick Gould said.
"Number one, our guys are basi
cally healthy. Number two. the
team attitude is very good, and
that's very important this time of
year."
For the second time in eight
days, a Stanford opponent won
only one set the entire day, indica
ting that the Cardinal has the con
centration necessary to pull off an
upset or two this weekend.
"1 thought it was a good learn
ing experience," said Coach Doug
Ruffin of Washington, now 12-10,
"and 1 thought for the most part
we stayed pretty positive. That
was our goal, to really work hard,
to not give in, also, to not play in
timidated, which is hard when
coming here for most schools."
Without wasting much time,
Stanford's top two players, Patrick
McEnroe and Jeff Tarango, were
simultaneously serving for wins at
5-0 in the second set. However,
while McEnroe momentarily
stumbled and lost his serve,
Tarango placed a shot down the
line to knock off the Huskies'
Charlie Short, 6-2. 6-0.
"Jeff Tarango continues to do
an outstanding job for us." Gould
said.
McEnroe, who had won the first
11 games of the match before Jeff
Parrv broke his serve, returned

the favor in the next game to win.
6-0. 6-1.
"I'm feeling fair," said McEnroe,
who has only recently come back
from knee and foot injuries. "I'm
feeling all right: I'm feeling a little
sore every now and then, (but) I'm
feeling pretty good."
Stanford's Jeff Cathrall, leading
5-2 in the second set against lan
Schroeder at No. 4, lost the next
two games and fell behind 2-0 as
he had trouble keeping his shots
from sailing long.
However. Cathrall fired an ace
on his way to four straight points
to take the match, his seventh in a
row, 6-3. 6-4. Soon after. Mark
Jacobson disposed of Washing
ton's Ted Reischling. 6-1, 6-3, at
No. 3 and Stanford led 4-0.
Then, after an easy first set.
Geordie McKee, who had led 3-0
but had fallen behind 6-5 in the
second set to the Huskies' Steve
Hunt, came back to win at No. 6,
6-1, 7-6, giving the Cardinal its
sixth straight victory.
Stanford's Scott Moody then
completed his own comeback at
No. 5 against Mark Onustoek. The
1-6. 6-4, 6-3 victory was the Stan
ford senior's sixth straight win.
The most remarkable thing of
the relatively uneventful doubles
matches was that the scores were
the same in both sets of each
match. Getting a head start while
McKee and Moody finished their
singles matches, McEnroe and
Tarango beat Short and Parry, 6-
2. 6-2, at No. 1.
Cathrall and Eric Peus disposed
of Reischling. 6-1, 6-1. at No. 3,
and Moody, showing no signs of
being tired from his singles
match, teamed up with Jacobson
to defeat Onustoek and
Schroeder, 6-2, 6-2. at No. 2.
"Mark Jacobson played a solid
doubles match today." Gould said.
"I thought overall our doubles
were very solid today. USC has
great doubles and UCLA has good
doubles "
