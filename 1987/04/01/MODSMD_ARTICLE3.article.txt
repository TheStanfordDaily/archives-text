# Branner to go graduate
## 
### CHRIS MYERS Editorial staff 
All good things must come to an
end.
Branner Hall, for many years an
all-freshmen dormitory, will be
converted to graduate student
housing at the end of this school
year. University officials an
nounced yesterday.
The change, according to acting
Dean of Student Affairs Norm
Robinson, is aimed at "narrowing
the discrepancy in quality be
tween graduate and undergradu
ate on-campus housing."
"Let's face it — graduate stu
dents have been treated like
second-class citizens housing
wise for years, having to live in
places like Escondido and Croth
ers." Robinson said. "It was the
University's feeling that it was
about time they were rewarded
with a housing plum like Bran
ner."
In addition, the change will
bring more equality to freshmen
housing, according to Robinson.
"It's no secret that Branner is just
plain nicer than. say. one of the
Stern houses." he explained. "It
doesn't seem fair that 180 stu
dents, purely by the luck of ran
dom assignment, should be in a
better place than all other fresh
men."
That sentiment was echoed by

freshmen living outside Branner.
"I really think this will be a change
for the better," said a Trancos res
ident who asked not to be identi
fied. "The people in Branner get so
in-bred and uppity, they're really a
divisive presence in the freshman
class. And whether we admit it or
not, other students get jealous
and bitter toward Branner. and
that's not good."
Current and former Bran
nerites, however, universally as
sailed the decision.
"I'm quite upset with both the
substance of the decision and the
way in which it was made," said
Kennell Jackson, resident fellow
at Branner. "I fail to see the need
for the change, and I think it's
simply an injustice to deny what
will amount to hundreds of people
the special opportunity and
privilege of being Branner fresh
men."
"This whole thing sucks," cur
rent Branner resident Joe Steven
son said. "In one way, it doesn't
really matter, because I won't be
living here next year anyway, but
the way they just sprang it on
us. ... I think it's a big mistake."
"The University has done some
stupid things while I've been here,
but this definitely takes the cake."
said junior Seth Riley, a former
Branner resident. "Branner was
such a great place to live . . . this
just doesn't make any sense."

"This decision is not altogether
intelligent," said junior Steve
Balint, also a former Branner resi
dent. "If you think about it, Bran
ner's not any nicer than Toyon or
Roble. . . . Why not turn one of
those over to the graduate stu
dents?"
Jackson took particular issue
with the decision-making process.
He said that neither he nor any
Branner residents were consulted
before the decision was an
nounced yesterday."I was very
shocked," he said.
"It was a surprise to all of us,
and not a pleasant one at that,"
said senior Allison Hartwell, a res
ident assistant in Branner.
Robinson defended the manner
in which the decision was made.
"This was not done rashly," he
said. "We discussed it for months,
and considered all options. It may
have the appearance of an admin
istrative fiat, simply because we
didn't consult students, but we
felt that if we did that it would
create pandimonium. It's a very
volatile issue."
Robinson said that the nearly
200 freshmen who would or
dinarily be assigned to Branner
this fall will instead be scattered
throughout Manzanita Park and
Crothers Memorial Hall, both of
which will empty significantly as a
result of the assignment of
graduate students to Branner.
