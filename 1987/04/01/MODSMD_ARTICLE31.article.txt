## A 						second opinion on 'Angel Heart' 
### MARK TOMPKINS Editorial staff 
Lemme tell ya about the movie "Angel
Heart." Yeah. I know it was slammed in
these pages just before break by another
reviewer, but remember, trashy movies
are in the eye of the beholder. There's a lot
about "Angel Heart" that might be consid
ered trashy — the brutal murders, the
much-publicized sex scene and all that
blood — but it's a great movie. It's trash
with flash.
Writer/director Alan Parker, a born
showoff, takes William Hjortsberg's well
regarded novel "Fallen Angel" and creates
a lurid masterpiece. In 1955 New York,
detective Harry Angel (Mickey Rourke) is
hired by a mysterious gent named Louis
Cyphre (Robert De Niro) to track down
one Johnny Favorite, a crooning dance

band smoothie of the '40s who disap
peared after the war. Favorite, it seems,
owes Cyphre something that Cyphre
wants very much. Angel's search for the
vanished singer takes him to Harlem and
then New Orleans, where he meets Epip
hany Proudfoot (Lisa Bonet).
It's a colorful trip: along the way Angel
sees a homegrown messiah in Harlem,
Delta bluesmen, voodoo ceremonies and
several nasty murders. It's in the dust and
sweat of New Orleans, though, that Angel
becomes implicated in the murders, and
the hotter things get for him, the more
chilling the movie becomes. Angel's weird
visions of elevator rides and bleeding
walls culminate In an unnerving revela
tion at the movie's climax. Learning the
truth about yourself, he discovers, can be
a nightmarish experience.
Sure, Alan Parker's symbolism gets

heavy-handed at times — just what do
those whirling ceiling fans represent?
Wait and see — but who cares? It's great
to see a director have so much with his
material, to see him take it to its limits.

With his Fu Manchu manicure and
malefic presence, De Niro effortlessly
pockets the movie.

Parker's eerie foreshadowing is what
gives "Angel Heart" so much of its power.
All the mysterious jump-cuts and flash
backs become even more ominous once
we learn what they're about.
Parker isn't the only one having a good

time here. All the actors make the most of
their parts; Mickey Rourke is better than
he has ever been before. Looking more
and more like an unmade bed as the
movie progresses, he's still a textbook

case of casual chic. But for once he's actu
ally likable (unlike in the unbelievably bad
"Year of the Dragon" or that adolescent
wet dream. "9 1/2 Weeks"), and hits a
high note in the climactic scene.
Lisa Bonet is fine in all her sultry glory,

but the hype about "Angel Heart" has
focused on her, when the real center of
the movie Is Robert De Nlro as the enig
matic Louis Cyphre. (That name Is a pun,
ha ha. Get It?). With his Fu Manchu
manicure and malefic presence, De Nlro
effortlessly pockets the movie. In his first
scenes with Rourke, he's elegantly under
stated: a mere flick of his eyebrow speaks
volumes about his character's condescen
sion toward Angel. When Cyphre dis
penses with masks at the climax, De Niro
lets his hair down, literally, and, like An
gel, we're practically in awe of him.

In short, "Angel Heart" is a wild time at
the movies. People are saying that it's a
weird flick, and there's no denying it. It's
a bizarro script. Nothing makes sense.
Everything makes sense. See "Angel
Heart;" as Louis Cyphre might agree, it's
a hell of a movie.
