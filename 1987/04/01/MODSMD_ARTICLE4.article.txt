# Mausoleum plans detailed
## Reagan seeks campus crypt 
### ANDREW PATZMAN Editorial staff 
President Reagan has requested
a Stanford burial site for himself
and his wife, a Ronald Reagan
Presidential Foundation liaison
disclosed yesterday.
Charles Palm, who is also chief
archivist at the Hoover Institu
tion, said the President's request
was submitted to the University
Board of Trustees Monday.
If approved, the Reagan burial
crypt would be located adjacent to
the Reagan Library. Architectural
plans submitted with the Presi
dent's request call for a marble
structure modeled after the Stan
ford family mausoleum.
According to his letter to the
trustees, Reagan seeks a burial
site at Stanford because "I have a
great many friends there and
would feel very much at home."
Palm noted that the idea of a
campus gravesite was suggested
to the president by Reagan's
longtime friend and political con
fidant, W. Glenn Campbell, direc
tor of the Hoover Institution.
Campbell refused to comment,
other than to say he was "very
pleased" that the president had
decided to "lend corporeal pres
ence" to the University's "Reagan
connection."
University President Donald
Kennedy said he was seriously
studying the proposal, but said he
had not yet formulated a
response. "On the one hand it
would be a great honor to have a
former president buried at Stan
ford," he said. "But then again,
I'm not sure the permanent pres
ence of Ronald Reagan on campus
is the best thing for the Univer
sity's image."
Kennedy said the trustees
would discuss the proposal at
their next meeting.
Plans for the burial structure
call for a two-story, 8,000-square
foot sculpted marble mausoleum
to be located just to the right of
the Reagan Library.
Inside, the crypt will feature
matching sarcophagi for the pres
ident and first lady, Spanish tiling
and an elevated visitors gallery.
Palm said plans for a vaulted dome
"suitable for light shows" may be
added to the design at a later date.

English Prof. Ronald Rebholz
warned that a Reagan mausoleum
on campus would make Stanford
"a shrine for America's reaction
ary element.
"Reagan groupies will be traips
ing through here for decades to
come," he said. "Just look at
Graceland â€” that's what we're in
for."
Graceland is the burial place of
Elvis Presley, a popular singer
who died in 1977.
"I'm surprised the president is
thinking that far ahead," said Po
litical Science Prof. David Aber
nethy. "It doesn't really fit his
management style.
A source in the Hoover Institu
tion, who wished to remain
anonymous, said the president
had initially planned to be buried
at his ranch near Santa Barbara,
but "changed his mind at Nancy's

insistence." According to the
source, Nancy Reagan felt a burial
site at the Reagan ranch would be
too inaccessible for "effective
public viewing."
"She wants him somewhere
where he can be appreciated," the
source added.
Reagan Library architect Hugh
Stubbins said he plans to use
"top-of-the-line marble" for the
Reagan crypt. "The quality will
definitely be superior to the Stan
ford mausoleum," he said. "For all
his money, (Leland) Stanford
really scrimped on his gravesite,"
Stubbins said.
Should Reagan or his wife die
before completion of the presiden
tial crypt, their remains could be
housed temporarily in the Stan
ford family mausoleum. Palm
said. "There's certainly plenty of
room in there," he added.
