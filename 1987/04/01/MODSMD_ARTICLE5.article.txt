The Ronald Reagan Presidential
Foundation hopes to include a
presidential wax museum as part
of the Reagan Library complex, a
foundation liaison announced
yesterday.
Charles Palm, also head ar
chivist at the Hoover Institution,
said the foundation is considering
invoking a clause in its agreement
with the Unviversity that permits
the addition of supplementary
material to aid in the research of
the Reagan administration.
Palm called the museum "a ne
cessary complement to the Reagan
archives. It is not enough to read
the President's documents to com
prehend his message. One must
view Reagan to fully understand
him."
The proposal calls for a museum
composed of wax images of
Reagan and his wife Nancy, as well
as renditions of present and
former cabinet members. White
House aides, political allies and
cinema heroes.
According to Palm, Reagan has
suggested that the museum in
clude wax figures of Reagan from

his most famous movies and a
model of his one-time co-star
Bonzo.
In addition, a collection of
motorized images is planned. At
the entrance to the museum, a
mechanized wax figure of Hoover
Institution Director W. Glenn
Campbell will collect tickets.
Inside, Lt. Col. Oliver North and
his secretary Fawn Hall will shred
secret documents and Nancy
Reagan will fire former White
House Chief of Staff Donald
Regan.
The exhibit will also feature fig
ures of Col. Moammar Khadafi,
Margaret Thatcher, Walter
Mondale, Mikhail Gorbachev and
a collection of Iranian "moderates"
proudly displaying the Bible that
was given to them by Reagan in a
gesture of good will.
Critics of the Reagan Library
were quick to lambast the new ad
dition. "This is just another exam
ple of how those conservatives are
trying to remold Stanford in their
own image," said English Prof.
Ronald Rebholz.
"This is a University, not a
theme park," he added.
