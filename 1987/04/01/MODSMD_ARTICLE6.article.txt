## 
### BOB MICHITARIAN Editorial staff 
Storey House will likely become an investment
banking theme house. Residential Education offi
cials announced yesterday after accepting petitions
in favor of the move.
If the change is approved, those who can show that
their coursework serves as preparation for a career
in investment banking or score high on a banker's
personality profile test will receive priority for Storey
in the upcoming housing draw.
The petitions showed overwhelming student back
ing, according to acting Dean of Student Affairs
Norm Robinson. "It's unlikely that we'll turn down
this request. It's sound and the students will profit
from it,"he said.
Over 2,000 students — just under 15 percent of
the student body — signed the petitions, which were
circulated at the end of last quarter by the Invest
ment Banking Club and the ASSU Senate.

Club members and senators said the theme house
Is needed to bring future business people together In
an environment suitable for on-campus power
breakfasts and for providing Japanese-language dis
cussion tables.
"Networking begins at home," IB Club president
Tiffany Bright said. "We chose Storey because it
reflects the upper-class lifestyle we hope to achieve."
"Of course, even Storey residents will have to meet
rigorous social standards if they want to become
members of the club," she added.
Most Storey residents were suprised to hear of the
proposal, but generally supported It. "No one told
me, but that sounds cool." said Storey resident assis
tant Van Anderson.
Storey resident Ike Boesky also speculated that be
cause Res Ed gave its support so quickly, the IB Club
and the ASSU may have received inside information
on Res Ed's intentions concerning theme houses.
