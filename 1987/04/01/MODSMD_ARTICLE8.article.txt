# Res Ed survey:
## Ethnic houses rated highest 
### RUSSELL KOROBKIN Editorial staff 
Students who live in ethnic theme houses are
more likely than other students to say their houses
have achieved the goals of residential education, ac
cording to a University study.
The study also showed that students across
campus seem to be more satisfied with dorm life
than they were last year.
Authored by Residential Education Project Coord
inator Carol Muller, the report was based on
responses to a questionnaire distributed during the
third week of January. The form asked students to
rate how well their dorms achieved a series of resi
dential goals and answer questions related to life In
the houses. The surveys were completed by two
thirds of students living in University residences.
According to the report, students living in ethnic
theme houses were more likely to say their
residences achieved "well" the goals of creating a
supportive and friendly community, encouraging in
tellectual discussion and stimulating interest in cul
tural activities. Theme house residents also gave
high marks to their houses for providing opportuni
ties to learn from people of different backgrounds,
for students to share their interests with other house
members and programs that respond to the needs
and interests of house members. #
Ethnic students living in ethnic theme houses
were found to be somewhat more likely to feel their
residence achieved goals of residential education.
The study found that whites were "just slightly
more likely" to say their residences created a suppor
tive atmosphere and responded to the needs and in
terests of house members than other ethnic groups.
There were "no significant gender differences in stu
dents' perceptions of their residences' achievement
of the goals of residential education."
The survey results also showed an increased level
of student satisfaction with their residences over last
year's findings. "For each of the goals listed, there
were higher percentages of respondents who said
their house achieved the goal well in 1986-87 than in
1985-86," the report said. The report noted that a
higher percentage of students responded to the sur
vey this year than last, which could account for some
of the increased satisfaction.
In other findings, the report
found freshmen In all-freshman
dorms were marginally more com
plimentary of their residences
than freshmen In four-class
dorms. Upper classmen in four
class dorms rated their residences
slightly lower in some categories
than upper classmen in upper
class dorms. Academic theme
house residents rated their
houses higher than average for
encouraging intellectual and cul
tural exchange.
The report qualified all its find
ings by warning the survey only
asked for perceptions, which are
not "an objective measure of
achievement."
