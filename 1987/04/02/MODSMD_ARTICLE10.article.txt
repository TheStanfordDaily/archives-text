# Senate battling over road bill veto
## 
### 
WASHINGTON - The Senate
voted narrowly yesterday to sus
tain President Reagan's veto of a
♦87.5 billion highway and mass
transit bill, but the final outcome
remained in doubt last night as
Democrats appeared on the verge
of reversing the vote and the White
House scrambled to preserve Its
victory.
After an extraordinary day of
cliff-hanging roll calls, vote
switches and arm-twisting from
both sides of the aisle, the presi
dent's battle for a comeback in
Congress hinged on picking up
just one Republican vote to offset
the change of heart by Sen. Terry
Sanford of North Carolina, the
president's only Democratic sup
porter on the original vote.
When the Senate quit for the
evening. Minority Leader Robert
J. Dole, R-Kan., said the quest for
the elusive vote had been incon
clusive thus far but would con
tinue until the Senate resumes
consideration of the issue today.
As matters stood last night, he

said, the Democrats appeared to
have enough votes to override the
veto.
Sens. Alan Cranston. D-Calif.,
and Daniel P. Moynihan, D-N.Y.,
leaders of the drive to override the
veto, said they were holding onto
Republican as well as Democratic
supporters and predicted the Sen
ate would override today.
Republicans had prevailed by
one vote earlier in the day in
denying Democrats the two-thirds
vote they needed to enact the legis
lation into law over Reagan's veto.
The House had voted Tuesday to
override Reagan's veto by a vote of
350-73.
But Reagan's success rested on
the support of Sanford, the fresh
man who voted to sustain the veto
on grounds that the measure
would shortchange North
Carolina. But he soon changed his
mind, saying he would join his fel
low Democratic senators in voting
to reconsider.
"We have proven the president
is able to lead," said Sanford in ex

plaining to bemused colleagues
why he now felt free to change his
vote.
In the earlier vote. Sanford had
been one of the last senators to an
swer the roll call as he conferred
alternately on the Senate floor
with Democratic leaders and with
assistant Republican leader Alan
K. Simpson of Wyoming over his
clearly critical vote. When Sanford
finally responded to the roll call,
he voted "present." which the Sen
ate parliamentarian later said
would have clinched the vote to
override the veto.
But after a couple of minutes
Sanford changed his vote to no.
Simpson then voted no. appar
ently sustaining the veto on a vote
of 66-34. At this point, Senate
Majority Leader Robert C. Byrd. D-
W.Va., changed his previous vote
for the override, a parliamentary
tactic that permitted him to call
for a reconsideration vote later in
the day. With Byrd's vote, the offi
cial tally was 65-35.
Sanford's later switch under

pressure from Senate Democratic
leaders, House Democrats from
North Carolina and Democratic
state officials appeared to assure
the Democrats the 67 votes
needed to override the veto and to
deny Reagan the victory he
wanted to help recover from the
Iran-contra affair.
As the afternoon wore on,
Reagan, just back from a speaking
engagement in Philadelphia,
made telephone calls to potential
Republican waverers as Vice Presi
dent Bush and Transportation
Secretary Elizabeth Hanford Dole
wooed senators personally in
rooms off the Senate floor.
During brief but often impas
sioned debate on the bill before
any votes were cast, Dole called It a
"very critical vote" for the presi
dent that could "determine the
strength of this presidency for the
next 21 months." while Byrd
warned his colleagues that a vote
to sustain the veto could cost jobs,
"maybe your own."
