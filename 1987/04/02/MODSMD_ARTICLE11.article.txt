# Near West plans outlined

### JEFF SEINFELD Staff writer 
A general construction sequence for the Near
West Campus has been outlined, but major design
and construction plans remain to be developed,
according to a letter released this week by Vice
Provost Raymond Bacchetti, who heads the plan
ning process.
An Advanced Materials Research (AMR) center,
which will be the new home of the researchers
who currently occupy the McCulloch Building,
will be built first under the plan.
Once that project is completed, either a Center
for Integrated Systems expansion or buildings for
the Computer Science Department will be con
structed. The order in which the projects are un
dertaken will depend upon fund-raising success
and the interdependency of the buildings.

Both, however, will precede the fourth phase in
the plan — the renovation of the McCulloch Build
ing for future use by the Physics Department.
Many more decisions concerning the specific
land use are still in the making, the letter said.
But the University is "now poised to go ahead with
planning." Bacchetti noted. We will "put together
a committee to plan the program." he said.
A map sent to faculty members illustrates where
departments will be located in the region and in
cludes approximate square footages. Other speci
fications. such as construction cost estimates,
have not been announced because so many issues
remain to be resolved. Bacchetti said.
The new AMR building and the other projects
are part of a *250 million redevelopment of Stan
ford's science and engineering facilities.
