## THE 						STANFORD DAILY An Independent Newspaper Tariff is foolish 
### 
A trade war has erupted between the
United States and Japan; ironically, it is
President Reagan, an avowed advocate of free
trade, who has fired the first salvo. However,
whatever the allure of retaliatory tariffs, they
are a hindrance to economic well-being and,
in this instance, an impediment to relations
between the two allies.
By doubling the import price on a wide
range of Japanese electronic products last
Friday, Reagan has finally given in to con
gressional protectionist pressure. Reagan's
action could affect up to $300 million worth
of television sets, lap-top computers and
stereo equipment. Reagan increased the
tariff to punish Japan for what the White
House called a Japanese failure to abide by a
semiconductor agreement signed last July.
The accord committed Japan to open its
markets to U.S. semiconductors and to stop
dumping its own chips.
Economically, the tariff is foolish. Accord
ing to government statistics and many exec

utives in the electronics industry, the overall
impact of the tariff will be insignificant.
Tariffs serve as a detriment to overall eco
nomic health. While in the short run the
move may increase profits of firms in the in
dustry, over time protectionist legislation
distorts consumer behavior and marketplace
efficiency.
In addition, Reagan's move has hurt the
political fortunes of Japanese Prime Minister
Nakasone, a strong Reagan ally.
Since the tariff was announced, the
Japanese have shown a willingness to
negotiate. This does not indicate that the
duty has served its purpose; rather, it shows
that negotiation should have initially taken
the place of retaliation. Increasing tariffs is
not a way to achieve free trade; political
reality shows that it is always easier to con
struct than to reduce protection levels.
Reagan and Congress should let the mar
ket rule.
