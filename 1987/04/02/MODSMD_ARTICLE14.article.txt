Arguments
are incorrect
Two defenses of the Stanford-
Hoover-Reagan connection have
recently been offered to the Stan
ford community. Lamentably, one
omits key facts; the other distorts
them.
Sociology Prof. Seymour Martin
Upset says the "only relevant fact
that need concern members of
the University" about the Reagan
Library is that it will be run by
the National Archives (Daily,
March 5).
; Prof. Lipset ignores the fact
that if the Reagan Library comes
here it will be "in affiliation with
the Hoover Institution." Univer
sity administrators have assured
the Faculty Senate that the pro
posed connection is archival, but
this claim is belied by Hoover
Archivist Charles Palm, who has
talked publicly of joint Hoover-
Reagan Library conferences.
A University committee is pro
posed as a consultative body for
the conferences, but if such a
committee includes Hoover repre
sentatives (who. after all, are
raising the funds for the library)
then Hoover, the Reagan Library
and, inevitably, Stanford will be
seen as a center for defending
policies for which Hoover proudly
claims much of the credit.
German Prof. Katharina Mom
msen cites awards received by
distinguished Hoover scholars
and Hoover publications contain
ing work by Marxists to persuade
us not to be concerned about
Hoover's alleged conservative bias
(Campus Report, March 18).
No one has ever claimed that
Hoover lacks the resources to
attract big names. But the Insti
tution's general reputation as a
leading conservative think tank
cannot be dispelled simply be
cause some people connected
with Hoover get awards or hold
leftist views.
Virtually every reporter who has

ever looked at Hoover, regardless
of his or her political persuasion,
has described Hoover as a conser
vative think tank. This impres
sive consensus Is in no way
undermined by Mommsen's argu
ment. For example, she finds six
Nobel laureates affiliated with
Hoover, but fails to tell readers
that at least four are world-class
conservatives: Milton Friedman,
Alexander Solzhenitsyn, Friedrich
A. von Hayek and George Stigler.
The inclusion of a few Marxists in
Hoover publications hardly offsets
such impressive conservative
credentials.
When all of the evidence on
Hoover's political activities is
coupled with the Institution's
formal charge — "to expose the
evils of the doctrines of Karl
Marx" — Hoover's hard-earned
conservative reputation
withstands Mommsen's
revisionist efforts.

Cartoon was
notjunny
What was the point of the
recent Farm Side cartoon that
portrayed three Stanford guys in
an exotic beach setting ogling a
couple of bikini-clad girls (Daily,
March 31)?
I assume it was supposed to be
funny as the normal intent of
cartoons is to humor us.
I guess the implication was that
guys can find slim, nine-tenths
naked girls elsewhere and not on
the Farm. Is that the funny part?
Or is the funny part that we don't
have any pretty girls at Stanford
to lie out nine-tenths naked at
our lake? Who is being made fun
of?
Would the "artist" or anyone
who laughed out loud when they
saw the cartoon explain the joke
to me? I don't get it.
