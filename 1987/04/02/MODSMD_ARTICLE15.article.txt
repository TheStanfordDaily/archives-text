# AIDS test available at Cowell
## 
### 
Since the recent Atlanta conference discuss
ing the increasing incidence of AIDS in the
heterosexual population, Cowell has received
an influx of calls from students wanting to be
tested for the AIDS antibody. This service is
indeed available to students through Cowell.

JOHN DORMAN

The decision to be tested for the AIDS an
tibody is not a simple one. One can argue that
students should use "safe sex" practices if they
are sexually active — whether or not their test
is positive. And since there is no treatment,
would you really want to know if your test were
positive? How would it change your life? What
does a positive test really mean? You are prob
ably contagious, but will you get AIDS? How
soon after exposure to the virus does the test
become positive (two weeks to six months or
more in some people)?
And consider the matter of false positives
and negatives. Although the testing procedure
has been improved, particularly if the screen

ing test (ELISA) is confirmed by the more spe
cific Western blot test, it is still unlikely but
possible to test positive even if you don't have
the antibody — a false positive. It is also
unlikely but possible to have a false negative —
to test negative and yet come down with the
disease.
Confidentiality is another issue. Although it
is possible to obtain the test anonymously at
various clinics in the area, the test at Cowell is
confidential but not anonymous.
The doctor will know who you are; he or she
will write discreet information in your chart;
you will sign a permission form and choose an
identification number. This number is the
only identification that goes on the lab slip.
The report comes back to the doctor directly —
not to the lab — and it is stored in his/her files
— not in the medical chart.
If the test is positive, whether performed
here or elsewhere, it is important for the stu
dent to inform all medical caretakers in order
to continue to obtain good medical care.
For all of the above reasons, neither Cowell
nor any other test site will allow you to just
come in and get the test. We need to think

through some of these issues with you to make
sure you understand them in all their complex
ity.
For this discussion you will need an appoint
ment. Appointments at Cowell are usually
available within a week. Testing at almost any
other clinic at this point in time involves a six
week wait for an appointment. Test results are
sent back to the physician in anywhere from a
few days to three weeks.
If you have given blood here recently, your
blood has already been tested for the AIDS an
tibody. However, the blood bank — by law —
cannot tell you of the test results for two
months. The blood bank does not wish to at
tract at-risk blood donors who are giving blood
merely to find out whether they have a positive
test.
If you have further questions about being
tested for the AIDS antibody, call 723-4841 or
723-0821. For further information about al
ternative, anonymous test sites call the AIDS
Hotline: 800-FOR-AIDS. or the public health
clinics in San Mateo (573-2576) or Santa Clara
(408-299-5913) counties.
