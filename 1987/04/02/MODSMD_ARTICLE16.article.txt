# Boycott coverage was biased
## 
### 
A recent article on the grape
boycott (Daily, Feb. 27) contained
several serious factual errors that
should be corrected.
According to the California Pes
ticide Management Division offi
cial cited in the article, the
pesticide Dinosab has already

MEChA

been banned. While this is techni
cally true, Dinosab continues to
be applied to farm produce as Cali
fornia growers take advantage of
regulatory loopholes that allow
them to use up their reserve
stocks of the pesticide. Both
growers and pesticide manufac
turers, meanwhile, continue to
pressure regulatory agencies to lift
the ban.
The official also stated that Cap

tan, another toxic pesticide, does
not come into contact with either
farm workers or the plants them
selves. This is false. Viewers of the
United Farm Workers (UFW) film
The Wrath of Grapes can see
footage of workers standing
mixing Captan in pails. Every
chemical test of supermarket
grapes which has been conducted
has found traces of Captan pres
ent.
It should be noted that Captan
is chemically very similar in
structure to the prescription drug
thalidomide, which was banned
worldwide in the 1950s for
causing birth defects.
It should also be noted that Cap
tan and Dinosab are only two of
the five chemicals the UFW is
seeking to ban.
More disturbing than the fac
tual errors contained in the
article, however, is its apparent

bias. Statements of the boycott's
supporters are first presented,
and then refuted by the official in
terviewed by The Daily. Yet sup
porters are given no similar
opportunity to refute the official's
statements.
And while the article three times
uses the loaded and slightly
pejorative word "claims" (as in
"the UFW claims") to characterize
statements made by the boycott's
supporters, the official's state
ments are presented as fact.
Most disturbing of all, however,
is the dark implication, contained
in one of the article's quotations,
that the UFW has some kind of ul
terior motive in promoting the
boycott ("The UFW has its own in
terests to promote"). The Daily
should not have printed this
quotation without either asking
the official to clarify what he
meant or attempting to do so on

Its own. To embed such an impli
cation within a news article con
stitutes unfair and misleading
journalism.
It is also incorrect. The UFW has
always stated its goals openly. It
seeks to end child labor, such as
in northern California where over
30 percent of the garlic crop is
harvested by children. It seeks to
end the sexual harassment of
women workers, who frequently
have been fired for resisting the
advances of company foremen
while on the job. It seeks to im
prove wages for farm workers,
who earn, on average, under
$3,000 each year. And it seeks to
end the exposure of farm workers
to toxic chemicals that threaten
their health â€” sometimes even
their lives.
