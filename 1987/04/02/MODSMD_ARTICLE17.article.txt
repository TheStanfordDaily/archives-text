# North of the border for break
## 
### 
By the time you're reading this column,
spring break will be over and we'll all be back to
classes. But as I'm typing away, it's still vaca
tion time, and I'm musing about the weeks I've
spent away from Stanford.
To begin with, it's not spring where I am. I
know. I know. I should have gone to Ft.
Lauderdale and stayed in one of those hotels
that caters to students. (You know — the kind
where they leave condoms in the bathrooms in
the place of shower caps.) But instead. I went
home to Edmonton. Alberta — land of the
noonday darkness.

But it was almost as great a shock to leave
the pleasant insular world of Stanford and
return to the real universe. The issues that
have filled my life for the last months meant
nothing to friends and family in Edmonton.
Nobody cares about bands that irrigate
playing fields, about professors who ride into
trees, about presidents who end their mar
riages or about army recruiters who dis
criminate against homosexuals. Nobody here
is Interested In divestment, theme houses or
the cost of campus meal plans.
OK — people were interested in the Ronald
Reagan Library and the Great Condom
Giveawav. But mostly, my Stanford world and

my home world had few points of reference in
common.
There were other curious shifts. At Stanford.
I have gotten into the (doubtless bad) habit of
posing as an expert on Canada. Now my
Canadian cronies have cast me as a expert on
things American.
Well, if I was underqualified to be an expert
on Canada, I'm a woefully inept expert on the
heart and soul of the American people. Still,
I've done my best to sort out the Doles from the
Dukakises. I've explained special prosecutors,
independent counsels and why Fawn Hall
refused to pose in the nude.
But there's one thing I can't explain. And un
fortunately. it's the single piece of news about
America that has Canada most entranced.
North. Poindexter, et al., don't rate the front
page here. Ya know what's on page one?
Jim and Tammy Bakker. With two K's.
I thought I was doing such a good job con
vincing my friends that Americans were really
clever, charming people. But can you imagine
trying to explain Jim. Tammy. Oral, Jimmy
Swaggart — and their amusement parks — to
foreign observers?
What an American soap opera! Adultery,
blackmail, drug abuse, corporate takeovers,
divine ransoms, presidential power-trips . . .
all brought to you courtesy of the TV preach
ers. "Dallas." "Dynasty" and "Falcon Crest"
cannot compete.
Canadians just don't have scandals on this
grand opera scale. Moral turpitude in the
Great White North Is more likely to involve ran
cid tuna fish than sex. drugs and corporate
roll-overs. No one in this shy. cold country
commits such juicy sins on national television.
So people here watch it all with ghoulish fas

cination. "Why would anyone send Oral
Roberts money?" they ask me. "Why would
anybody ride a born-again roller coaster?"
Mostly, they want to know how anyone can
be taken in by the hypocritical hogwash of the
TV preachers, especially in light of these recent
revelations.
And it's something I can't explain. After six
months' residence in the United States, the
whole thing remains a mystery to me.
Sure there are pat answers. Psychological ex
planations about people with empty lives
search for ultimate solutions. Sociological ex
planations about America's early history as the
city on the hill, the New Jerusalem. Cynical so
lutions that suggest that Americans as a na
tion are gullible and vulnerable to snake-oil
salesmen.
None of those answers seem very satisfac
tory. But I think it is an important question to
ask. Because the same faith that so many
Americans exhibit for the TV preachers they
show for their political leaders. It's a blind
faith, that whatever Jim and Tammy or Ron
and Nancy do must be right.
America's invincible innocence is one of its
most charming characteristics. No matter
what deceptions its leaders — religious and
secular — practice. America's faith endures.
However, that same enduring innocence is
one of the nation's most dangerous weakness
es. It stops a free people from rigorously ques
tioning the actions of their leaders.
It may be all right for Stanford to be a world
of insular innocence. The United States can
less easily afford such a posture.
