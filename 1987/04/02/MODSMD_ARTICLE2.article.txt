Heather Stone, states that "the students

of Stanford" should "recommend that
the Board of Trustees select an alterna
tive and more appropriate site for the
Ronald Reagan Presidential Library, and
that the site selection process should in
clude appropriate and well-publicized
opportunities for significant participa
tion of students, faculty and other Stan
ford community members."

held April 14-15. includes four slates of
candidates running for Council of Presi
dents. 31 undergraduate senate candi
dates and eight graduate senate candi

dates, and fee requests from 22 student
groups, according to ASSU Election
Commissioner Brett Jarvis.

sponsored by Stanford Out of South
Africa which asks that the trustees con
sider "immediate and total divestment"
at their next meeting. White said.

□ The Equalizers. Leoifaid Adler, Maria
Canas, Jim Durkin and Roechelle
Smith.

In addition to the Reagan Li
brary referendum proposal, the
senate will also consider at its
meeting Friday a proposal for a
referendum recommending that
the trustees take steps to protect

the Stanford foothills from devel
opment. and a constitutional
amendment that would make pos
sible the raising of long-term capi
tal fees for student projects.
White said he expects the senate
to approve all three ballot addi
tions, although he said slight
changes may be made in the wor
ding of the measures.
The rest of the entries on the
election ballot were determined by
the submission of student peti
tions at the end of winter quarter.
White said the proposed foot
hills referendum "recommends
that the trustees take action to
preserve the foothills as
undeveloped open space.' "
