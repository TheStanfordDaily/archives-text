## SOAR: More than listening to cows moo 
### KATHY LACHENAUER Staff writer 
For most Stanford students,
getting back to nature this spring
quarter means walking up to the
Dish and listening to the cows
moo.
But the Stanford Outdoor Ad
ventures and Recreation organiza
tion (SOAR) provides students
with a real chance to experience
the great outdoors.
Rock-climbing excursions,
white water rafting trips and
camping at Yosemite National
Park are just some of the pro
grams SOAR will offer this spring.
SOAR is a student club made up
of about 35 nature-loving people.
SOAR began about four years ago
and has especially grown this past
year.
The main reason for the club's

soaring popularity is Mary Duffy,
director of the program. Duffy, a
summer park ranger at Yosemite.
encourages students to come up
with ideas for new SOAR ad
ventures.
"Every weekend we have some
thing going." Duffy said. Winter
activities centered around fun in
the snow. Cross country skiing
was especially popular and clinics
taught by professionals were of
fered.
Each clinic has about 15 parti
cipants. According to Duffy, "their
small size gives people the level of
attention they want and everybody
really gets to know each other."
Spring quarter clinics will in
clude rock climbing, backpacking,
boogie-boarding and surfing. For
the less athletic, other outdoor
clinics are offered.
For example, University Presi

dent Donald Kennedy lead one
SOAR group on a bird-watching
excursion through the Palo Alto
Baylands last quarter.
Last year, sophomore Jenny
Schmitz visited the Monterey
Aquarium and went whale
watching with SOAR. Schmitz
has now become the student as
sistant for the club.
Schmitz said she hopes to come
up with lots of ideas to improve
the program. Last year SOAR sent
out packets to all the resident as
sistants with information on
skiing and rentals. This quarter
Schmitz plans to send out similar
packets for camping and back
packing.
Equipment rental is another
service offered by SOAR and prices
are cheap. According to Schmitz,
"just about any kind of camping
equipment you want we will sell."

SOAR will also help dorm
groups organize trips. "If a dorm
wants to go on a trip we'll do some
consulting and help set them up."
Schmitz said.
Looking to the future, Schmitz
added that SOAR hopes to expand
and open a ski rental shop.
Despite all these services, Stan
ford students know very little
about SOAR. Located in the the
Recreation Center at the back of
Tressider Union, SOAR receives
little visibility.
According to Duffy, graduate
students and staff are the only
ones who take advantage of the
club's programs.
But Schmitz said "this year's
turnout is 100 percent better than
last year's." Both she and Duffy
said they hope SOAR'S popularity
will continue to spread and even
tually reach undergraduates.
