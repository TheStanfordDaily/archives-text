## Passion revealed in poet's letters 
### REID SHERLINE 
Rainier Marie Rilke
Letters To A Young Poet
New York: Harper and Row, 1987

When I was a senior at Stanford, I
told a friend of mine that I was feeling
lonely. I said, "I'm trying to convince
myself that this is all part of the college
experience, but I haven't found many
arguments to support my claim."
As far as I could tell, there was noth
ing in the Stanford curriculum that
embraced or even justified isolation.
On the contrary, the University
seemed to impose a sense of commu
nity on whatever I did. And while
something within me pulled me very
noticeably away from the community
and deeper and deeper into myself, I
began to believe that whatever I was
feeling was self-indulgent at best, and
more than likely just plain unhealthy.
My friend listened sympathetically
to my complaints, then shortly after
ward presented me with a small gift
wrapped volume and said, "Read this."
I unwrapped a paperbound edition of
Rainier Marie Rilke's "Letters To A
Young Poet."
In this book, comprised of 10 letters
written between February 1903 and
December 1908 to then 19-year-old
Franz Xaver Kappus, I found what I
had been looking for, a testimony to
the virtues of isolation. Rilke not only
embraced solitude, he cherished it,
and he did so with such terrifying au
thority that I could not help but suc
cumb to his views. Here, at last, was
the confirmation I needed, the permis
sion to go ahead and be alone and to
view my loneliness and my feelings of
isolation as a gift, rather than a curse.
But the volume that I was given by
my friend had one shortcoming —
though I had not read the original Ger
man, I sensed that the letters had suf
fered in translation. They seemed pon
derous at times, and lacked clarity.
They should have evoked the vitality
and passion of their young writer —
Rilke was only 27 when he began to
write the letters — and the intimacy
one would associate with private cor
respondence. Instead, they gave the
overall impression of something dusty
and academic.
The poet Staphen Mitchell has

translated "Letters to a Young Poet"
anew, and he has breathed new life
Into them. There Is nothing dusty and
academic about the Rllke of Mitchell's
translation. The language Is flowery,
at times almost melodramatic. The
discussion returns to the theme of
solitude repeatedly. But it doesn't give
the impression, as the earlier transla
tion did, that Rilke is a didact who
wants to pound his ideas into young
Kappus' head. Rather, the Rilke of
Mitchell's translation addresses his
themes over and over again because he
himself hasn't quite made up his mind
about them. The gap between the in
tent of the letters and the language
used to convey that Intent has been
narrowed, and the resulting sense of
immediacy makes the letters stand on
their own as a stronger, more pas
sionate treatment.
This is important, because In
Mitchell's volume the letters do indeed
stand alone. Kappus. to whom they
were originally addressed, is omitted
entirely. Admittedly, this is not much
of an omission. Kappus, by his own
hand, figures only barely into the
original published version. In his own
introduction to the letters, not in
cluded in Mitchell's translation, he
says, "Only the 10 letters are Impor
tant . . . important for an understand
ing of the world in which Rainer Maria
Rilke lived and worked. . . . And where
a great and unique man speaks, small
men should keep silence." Mitchell
seems to agree, for he has silenced
Kappus entirely, omitting even the
sentences that express this opinion.
Reading Mitchell's translation with
out Kappus' notes, we begin to think
of the letters as having been written
across time directly from Rilke to us.
We may even resent the intrusion of
Kappus, as if he is some sort of right
ful king having come to reclaim his
throne. But Kappus is important. He
is, after all, part of "the world in which
Rainer Maria Rilke lived and worked,"
at least as far as the letters are con
cerned.
Mitchell makes up for the omission
of Kappus' introduction by supplying
one of his own. In it he relates the
story of how the letters came to be
written. Kappus, a student at a mili
tary academy in Sankt Poelten, was
sitting under a tree reading a collec

tion of Rilke's poems when one of his
professors came up to him, took the
book from his hands, looked at it, and
said, "So our pupil Rene Rilke has
become a poet." As it turned out, Rilke
had been a student at the same mili
tary academy some 15 years earlier, a
period that Rilke was later to describe
as "one long and terrifying damna
tion."
It was this coincidence that inspired
young Kappus to send his attempts at
poetry to Rilke in hopes of receiving
encouragement. He also sent a letter
in which "1 unreservedly laid bare my
heart as never before and never since
to any second human being." Rilke of
ten received correspondence from
young people, but in this case he must
have felt a particularly strong kinship
with the young man who was experi
encing many of the hardships that he
himself had felt 15 years before. This
kinship between Rilke and Kappus lies
at the center of the 10 letters, and it is
why we continue to read them today,
almost a century after they were writ
ten. The letters speak to us. not be
cause they were written across time to
us, but because, in all likelihood, they
were written across time to Rilke him
self.
At the writing of the letters, Rilke
had most of his great works still before
him. In 1903, he was perhaps as rest
less as Kappus himself.
The letters, then, are less dispas
sionate advice from an older and wiser
man than they are an attempt on
Rilke's part to give expression to the
forces that came between him and his
work, and in so doing to come to terms
with them. As he explains at the close
of the eighth letter: "Don't think that
the person who is trying to comfort
you now lives untroubled among the
simple and quiet words that
sometimes give you pleasure. His life
has much trouble and sadness, and
remains far behind yours. If it were
otherwise, he would never have been
able to find those words." It is this
grappling, this coming to understand
his troubles through the very words
that acknowledge them, that is the
most engaging aspect of "Letters to a
Young Poet," and the most important.
And it is precisely the accuracy and
passion that Mitchell's new transla
tion goes a long way toward revealing.

one of his own. In it he relates the
story of how the letters came to be
written. Kappus, a student at a mili
tary academy in Sankt Poelten, was
sitting under a tree reading a collec

tion of Rilke's poems when one of his
professors came up to him, took the
book from his hands, looked at it, and
said, "So our pupil Rene Rilke has
become a poet." As it turned out, Rilke
had been a student at the same mili
tary academy some 15 years earlier, a
period that Rilke was later to describe
as "one long and terrifying damna
tion."
It was this coincidence that inspired
young Kappus to send his attempts at
poetry to Rilke in hopes of receiving
encouragement. He also sent a letter
in which "1 unreservedly laid bare my
heart as never before and never since
to any second human being." Rilke of
ten received correspondence from
young people, but in this case he must
have felt a particularly strong kinship
with the young man who was experi
encing many of the hardships that he
himself had felt 15 years before. This
kinship between Rilke and Kappus lies
at the center of the 10 letters, and it is
why we continue to read them today,
almost a century after they were writ
ten. The letters speak to us. not be
cause they were written across time to
us, but because, in all likelihood, they
were written across time to Rilke him
self.
At the writing of the letters, Rilke
had most of his great works still before
him. In 1903, he was perhaps as rest
less as Kappus himself.
The letters, then, are less dispas
sionate advice from an older and wiser
man than they are an attempt on
Rilke's part to give expression to the
forces that came between him and his
work, and in so doing to come to terms
with them. As he explains at the close
of the eighth letter: "Don't think that
the person who is trying to comfort
you now lives untroubled among the
simple and quiet words that
sometimes give you pleasure. His life
has much trouble and sadness, and
remains far behind yours. If it were
otherwise, he would never have been
able to find those words." It is this
grappling, this coming to understand
his troubles through the very words
that acknowledge them, that is the
most engaging aspect of "Letters to a
Young Poet," and the most important.
And it is precisely the accuracy and
passion that Mitchell's new transla
tion goes a long way toward revealing.
Rainier Marie Rilke
Letters To A Young Poet
New York: Harper and Row, 1987

When I was a senior at Stanford, I
told a friend of mine that I was feeling
lonely. I said, "I'm trying to convince
myself that this is all part of the college
experience, but I haven't found many
arguments to support my claim."
As far as I could tell, there was noth
ing in the Stanford curriculum that
embraced or even justified isolation.
On the contrary, the University
seemed to impose a sense of commu
nity on whatever I did. And while
something within me pulled me very
noticeably away from the community
and deeper and deeper into myself, I
began to believe that whatever I was
feeling was self-indulgent at best, and
more than likely just plain unhealthy.
My friend listened sympathetically
to my complaints, then shortly after
ward presented me with a small gift
wrapped volume and said, "Read this."
I unwrapped a paperbound edition of
Rainier Marie Rilke's "Letters To A
Young Poet."
In this book, comprised of 10 letters
written between February 1903 and
December 1908 to then 19-year-old
Franz Xaver Kappus, I found what I
had been looking for, a testimony to
the virtues of isolation. Rilke not only
embraced solitude, he cherished it,
and he did so with such terrifying au
thority that I could not help but suc
cumb to his views. Here, at last, was
the confirmation I needed, the permis
sion to go ahead and be alone and to
view my loneliness and my feelings of
isolation as a gift, rather than a curse.
But the volume that I was given by
my friend had one shortcoming —
though I had not read the original Ger
man, I sensed that the letters had suf
fered in translation. They seemed pon
derous at times, and lacked clarity.
They should have evoked the vitality
and passion of their young writer —
Rilke was only 27 when he began to
write the letters — and the intimacy
one would associate with private cor
respondence. Instead, they gave the
overall impression of something dusty
and academic.
The poet Staphen Mitchell has

translated "Letters to a Young Poet"
anew, and he has breathed new life
Into them. There Is nothing dusty and
academic about the Rllke of Mitchell's
translation. The language Is flowery,
at times almost melodramatic. The
discussion returns to the theme of
solitude repeatedly. But it doesn't give
the impression, as the earlier transla
tion did, that Rilke is a didact who
wants to pound his ideas into young
Kappus' head. Rather, the Rilke of
Mitchell's translation addresses his
themes over and over again because he
himself hasn't quite made up his mind
about them. The gap between the in
tent of the letters and the language
used to convey that Intent has been
narrowed, and the resulting sense of
immediacy makes the letters stand on
their own as a stronger, more pas
sionate treatment.
This is important, because In
Mitchell's volume the letters do indeed
stand alone. Kappus. to whom they
were originally addressed, is omitted
entirely. Admittedly, this is not much
of an omission. Kappus, by his own
hand, figures only barely into the
original published version. In his own
introduction to the letters, not in
cluded in Mitchell's translation, he
says, "Only the 10 letters are Impor
tant . . . important for an understand
ing of the world in which Rainer Maria
Rilke lived and worked. . . . And where
a great and unique man speaks, small
men should keep silence." Mitchell
seems to agree, for he has silenced
Kappus entirely, omitting even the
sentences that express this opinion.
Reading Mitchell's translation with
out Kappus' notes, we begin to think
of the letters as having been written
across time directly from Rilke to us.
We may even resent the intrusion of
Kappus, as if he is some sort of right
ful king having come to reclaim his
throne. But Kappus is important. He
is, after all, part of "the world in which
Rainer Maria Rilke lived and worked,"
at least as far as the letters are con
cerned.
