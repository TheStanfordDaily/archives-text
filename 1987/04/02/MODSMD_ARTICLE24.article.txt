# 'Lethal Weapon a success
## 
### JAMES LUJAN Editorial staff 
In a review of the movie in The Village
Voice, a female critic was upset by the fact
that not once does Mel Gibson show his
lethal weapon on screen. I think I'd better
set the record straight here: The title is
supposed to imply that Gibson is the lethal
weapon, not that he has one (although
some people would probably disagree).
At any rate, enough is shown of Mel Gib
son in this movie to satisfy even the most
hardcore Gibson fans, but it's his pairing
with Danny Glover and the light-hearted,
fast-paced direction of Richard Donner that
is the secret to this film's success.
The plot of "Lethal Weapon," however, is
predictable and contrived. Gibson plays
Martin Riggs. a highly trained member of a
crack Special Forces unit during the Viet
nam War who is now a cop and registered as
a "lethal weapon" with the Los Angeles
Police Department. He has just lost his wife

of 11 years in a car accident and is unable
to cope with his loss. At night, he sticks a
gun in his mouth ready to pull the trigger
and during the day he recklessly does a
Larry, Moe and Curly routine with some
drug dealers before being taken hostage
and demanding to be killed. The word
around the department is that he's either a
full-fledged psycho or he's a man with a
death wish.
Riggs is transferred from narcotics to
homicide where he's partnered with Roger

Murtaugh (Danny Glover), also a Vietnam
vet and a detective with a solid reputation
and unblemished record who, of course. Is
the opposite of Riggs. Murtaugh Is a
devoted family man who has just turned 50
and wants to live long enough to collect his
pension.

The story focuses on their investigation
of an apparent suicide which turns out to
be connected to an international narcotics
ring being run, naturally, by a group of
Vietnam veterans. But this weak excuse for
a plot is the least interesting aspect of the
movie. What's most interesting here is the
relationship between these two characters
as their uneasy alliance grows into a close
friendship. There is a nice chemistry be
tween the two stars and credit must be
given to them for elevating this material
above what could have been a standard
buddy-buddy movie.
Mel Gibson lends an unexpected sense of
humor to his high-energy performance as
the wild-eyed, suicidal Riggs — it's a
welcome change of pace from his deadpan,
brooding Mad Max incarnations.
Director Richard Donner ("The Omen,"
"Superman — The Movie" and"The
Goonies") keeps things moving at a brisk
pace and many of the action stunts are very
good. The first half of the movie is great fun
to watch as the emphasis is on character
rather than plot.
Overall, however, "Lethal Weapon" is a
good movie, due in large part to the talents
of Gibson and Glover. It's a very entertain
ing way to spend an evening.
