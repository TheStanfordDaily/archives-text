### JOSE BOWEN ADAM GROSSMAN 
Foundations of Modern Jazz
Dunhill Compact Classics (DZSO22)
If you are interested in modern jazz but
haven't heard a lot. this disc is for you. It
samples the wide range of styles that
came out of the '40s and '50s. Some of the
names may be familiar: Quincy Jones,
Milt Jackson, Cannonball Adderley, Thad
Jones, John Coltrane, Wynton Kelly, Paul
Chambers and McCoy Tyner, among
others.
The music ranges from traditional
sounds to hard bop and the experimenta
tion of Charlie Mingus, and includes
some rare moments with players who
went on to become jazz greats. Theses

slons were recorded between 1954 and
1960.
Two of the cuts feature Cannonball Ad
derley with a young John Coltrane.
Hearing these two giants side by side is a
real treat. The first cut, "Jones Bash,"
features six unrelated Joneses: Quincy.
Thad, Reunald, Jimmy. Jo and Eddie.
Other highlights include John Coltrane
in New York with McCoy Tyner and Billy
Higgins.
In short, all 47 minutes of this disc are
loaded with great personnel and an inter
esting selection of tunes. This album
makes a great introduction to modern
jazz for the new listener, and a wonderful
collection of old friends in early settings
for the more experienced jazz enthusiast.
The Phil Woods Quintet: Heaven
Black Hawk (BKH 504-2)
Phil Woods has been acclaimed as the
master of the alto saxophone and he does
indeed represent be-bop in the '80s. His
earlier recordings quickly set him apart
as an artist and innovator and this album
is a great example of the Phil Woods con
cept. What that means is the ability to dis
play unsurpassed sensitivity on a ballad
such as the title track, and then turn
around and swing ferociously on "222."
Wood's roots in Charlie Parker and Can
nonball Adderley are well heard but al
ways translated to a style that could only
be his own.
You really have to hear this recording in
order to understand how finely tuned this
group is. Bill Goodwin (drums) and Steve

Gilmore (bass) have been playing with
Woods for 12 years and it shows: Every
note counts and every rim shot adds to
the final product. Hal Galper's unusual
piano improvisations add a lightness to
the overall sound that provides contrast
as well as support. His solo on "The Duke"
is outstanding. Phil Woods would be a
daunting partner for any other horn
player, but Tom Harrell, a Stanford grad,
holds his own. Hints of Miles Davis and
Freddie Hubbard can be heard; his solo
on his own composition "Occurence"
really burns.
Although originally recorded in analog,
the sound is very good. The instruments
are well balanced and realistic, without
extraneous noise: 43 minutes of artwork.
John Tropea: NY Cats Direct
Digital Music Products (CD-453)
This is an exceptionally well-produced
disc containing some very interesting jazz
fusion. John Tropea is a polished guitar
player and is backed by some of the better
studio musicians in New York. The talent
includes Don Grolick and Richard Tee on
keyboards, Anthony Jackson on bass,
Steve Gadd on drums and Lou Marini on
saxophones, among others. Tropea plays

with a great deal of facility and his solos
are clean and tasteful. From the burning
rhythm in"The Chant" to the relaxed
acoustic sound of "Mr. Music," Tropea
displays both excitement and control. The
other musicians are more than suppor
tive â€” you can't beat Steve Gadd on
drums and Lou Marini does some super
tenor sax work.

Some very interest
ing jazz.

"NY Cats Direct" was recorded direct to
digital (DDD) and displays the exceptional
sonic quality that has come to be expected
from the DMP label. Peculiar to this disc,
however, is that it was recorded direct-to
two-track instead of "mixing down" a
multi-track recording. In other words, the
group did not have the luxury of choosing
the best parts of several takes and com
bining them to produce the final version.
The result is that the music is a little bit
more like a live recording. 63 minutes of
great music and stunning sound.
Jessica Williams:
Nothin' But The Truth
Black Hawk(BKH 51301)
The diversity of styles and moods and
the contrasts between traditional and
modern playing make this a great intro
duction to the format of piano trio. The
typical piano trio consists of a piano, bass

and drums, with the piano taking the
dominant role. Although John Wiitala
(bass) and Bud Spangler (drums) do a
wonderful job of playing with Williams
and not just behind her, Jessica Williams
is the stunning focus of this disc. She
combines clean technique with imagina
tion and a laid-back rhythmic feel that
makes her sound a little like the Dexter
Gordon of the piano. The strongest influ
ence on her playing is clearly Thelonius
Monk, with hints of Oscar Petersen as
well. Yet her bossa nova version of
'"Round Midnight" demonstrates her own
unique style.
The album also includes four originals
by Williams. Her tunes are extremely im
aginative and unique, as are her solos.
The disc was digitally mastered and the
sound of the piano is very realistic: 43
minutes of worthwhile music.
