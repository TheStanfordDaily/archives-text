Top band members; the Good, the

acclaimed favorite. famous
canines — Lassie, Rin Tin Tin and
Benji.
Today, tomorrow and Saturday
in Austin. Texas, the Stanford
men's swimming team will try to
join the slick ranks of three, vying
for its third consecutive NCAA
championship.
The No. 1 ranked Cardinal. 10-1
during the dual-meet season,
enters the postseason tournament
as the overall favorite, with
Florida, Texas and California ex
pected to challenge.
Stanford Coach Skip Kenney,
usually a proponent of guarded
optimism, could not help but leak
out a bit of excited confidence over
his team's weekend potential.
"From a coach's standpoint,
what's a little scary — coming off
our best Pac-10 (championship)
ever — is that I've never had a
team swimming so well at this
point. I mean everybody. If we
swim well, we should win it."
To repeat as champions, Stan
ford will once again need strong

performances out of its depth
swimmers to support the Cardinal
standouts. In the Pac-10 cham
pionships, with Stanford's top
stars unshaved. the less-heralded
members sparkled, leading the
Cardinal to a record-setting 750.5
points.
"In 1985, we won the title be
cause of our top athletes. Last
year, we won with depth." Kenney
said. "This time, we're going to
have to have a combination of our
top athletes doing what they're ca
pable of and our depth coming
through."
During the three-day stanza —
the second fastest swim meet in
the world outside of the U.S.
Olympic time trials, according to
Stanford Asst. Coach Ted "Ted-
Man" Knapp — Kenney will field a
lineup of 15 swimmers and one
diver, sophomore Matt Frawley.
With vast quality and quantity
on its side, the Cardinal must
carry the unenviable burden of
being championship favorites, a
prospect that leaves senior tri
captain Sam McAdam relatively
unfazed, however.
"We just have to worry about
ourselves." he said. "We can't get
caught up with others. If we swim
our best times it is going to be dif
ficult to beat us.

"The bottom line is we have to
put out. There are too many good
teams this year. We need
everybody. Everybody should
score," he added.
The Cardinal's primary' compet
itor will likely be Florida. The
Gators have potential scorers in
every event and will be led by their
highly touted freshman class,
which adds considerable depth to
their freestyle relays. The relays
are a particularly important asset
since they count for twice as many
points as individual events in the
scoring.
Texas, which handed Stanford
its only dual-meet loss earlier in
the season, will also rely heavily
upon a talented freshman corps.
Of the 14 Longhorn swimmers
who qualified, eight are freshmen.
Any nervousness the inexperi
enced Texas team might suffer
will no doubt be alleviated by an
expected sizable home crowd. The
Longhorns claimed their previous
NCAA championship at home in
1981.
The championship will not go
by without some heavy waves from
Cal's Matt Biondi and company.
According to Kenney, the major
part of Cal's potential success
