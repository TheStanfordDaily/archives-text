## Card swimmers favored to win in Texas

Cool things often come in
threes: Kukla, Fran and Ollie; ZZ
Top band members; the Good, the
Bad and the Ugly; and finally the
acclaimed favorite. famous
canines — Lassie, Rin Tin Tin and
Benji.
Today, tomorrow and Saturday
in Austin. Texas, the Stanford
men's swimming team will try to
join the slick ranks of three, vying
for its third consecutive NCAA
championship.
The No. 1 ranked Cardinal. 10-1
during the dual-meet season,
enters the postseason tournament
as the overall favorite, with
Florida, Texas and California ex
pected to challenge.
Stanford Coach Skip Kenney,
usually a proponent of guarded
optimism, could not help but leak
out a bit of excited confidence over
his team's weekend potential.
"From a coach's standpoint,
what's a little scary — coming off
our best Pac-10 (championship)
ever — is that I've never had a
team swimming so well at this
point. I mean everybody. If we
swim well, we should win it."
To repeat as champions, Stan
ford will once again need strong

performances out of its depth
swimmers to support the Cardinal
standouts. In the Pac-10 cham
pionships, with Stanford's top
stars unshaved. the less-heralded
members sparkled, leading the
Cardinal to a record-setting 750.5
points.
"In 1985, we won the title be
cause of our top athletes. Last
year, we won with depth." Kenney
said. "This time, we're going to
have to have a combination of our
top athletes doing what they're ca
pable of and our depth coming
through."
During the three-day stanza —
the second fastest swim meet in
the world outside of the U.S.
Olympic time trials, according to
Stanford Asst. Coach Ted "Ted-
Man" Knapp — Kenney will field a
lineup of 15 swimmers and one
diver, sophomore Matt Frawley.
With vast quality and quantity
on its side, the Cardinal must
carry the unenviable burden of
being championship favorites, a
prospect that leaves senior tri
captain Sam McAdam relatively
unfazed, however.
"We just have to worry about
ourselves." he said. "We can't get
caught up with others. If we swim
our best times it is going to be dif
ficult to beat us.

"The bottom line is we have to
put out. There are too many good
teams this year. We need
everybody. Everybody should
score," he added.
The Cardinal's primary' compet
itor will likely be Florida. The
Gators have potential scorers in
every event and will be led by their
highly touted freshman class,
which adds considerable depth to
their freestyle relays. The relays
are a particularly important asset
since they count for twice as many
points as individual events in the
scoring.
Texas, which handed Stanford
its only dual-meet loss earlier in
the season, will also rely heavily
upon a talented freshman corps.
Of the 14 Longhorn swimmers
who qualified, eight are freshmen.
Any nervousness the inexperi
enced Texas team might suffer
will no doubt be alleviated by an
expected sizable home crowd. The
Longhorns claimed their previous
NCAA championship at home in
1981.
The championship will not go
by without some heavy waves from
Cal's Matt Biondi and company.
According to Kenney, the major
part of Cal's potential success

Stanford Coach Skip Kenney has the men's swimming team in top form as the Cardinal opens defense of
its NCAA title today. Stanford is coming off a record-setting performance at the Pac-10 meet
hinges upon whether Blondi can
shake off his season's worth of
nagging injuries and come
through with his top swims. "As
Biondi goes, so does Cal," Kenney
said.
The eyes of Texas and most any
other pair of nearby retinas will
also fall upon another noted swim
ming superstar — Stanford's
Pablo Morales. Going into his final
NCAA championship, the Card
inal tri-captain has won eight
NCAA individual titles. If Morales
reclaims first in both his butterfly
(100 and 200 yards) events and
the 200-yard Individual medley,
he will surpass the old all-time
mark of 10 career titles set by
USC's John Naber.
"Pablo Is the difference between

us and the rest of the teams." Ken
ney said. "He's so versatile. I think
that by the end of this meet, he'll
be recognized as one of. if not the
greatest collegiate swimmer of all
time."
The first day opens with four
swimming events — the 500
freestyle, the 200 IM, the 50
freestyle and the 400 medley relay.
The one-meter diving will also be
held.
In the 500 freestyle, the Card
inal will be led by another top gun
— senior tri-captain Jeff Kostoff,
who claimed this year's Pac-10
title. Close behind is freshman
John Witchel. who has the distin
guished possibility of becoming
"one of the studs." McAdam said.
Kenney hopes to get points from
senior Dave Louden and freshman
Lunn Lestina as well.
The 200 IM offers similar Stan
ford depth and standouts. Both
Morales and a resurgent Matt

Nance are expected to score big
points, while freshman Byron
Burson and McAdam have strong
chances to rack up additional
beads on the 200 abacus.
For the first time in many years.
Stanford has hopes in the quin
tessential sprint department, the
50 freestyle. Amid Cal's Biondi
and a host of Florida thor
oughbreds, the Cardinal's John
Hodge and a surprising Doug
Lilydahl could well surface tor
valuable scoring marks.
Today's schedule culminates
with perhaps the meet's most ex
citing event — the 400 IM relay.
Currently the Cardinal medley
team owns the second fastest time
in the country behind Michigan.
"We don't have to be leading
after the first day," Kenney said.
"Our strongest events and most of
our swims come in the final two
days."
It could be scary.
