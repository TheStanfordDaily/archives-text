# Knight and Hayes: What it takes to be successful
## 
### 
I was in Columbus. Ohio, the day after Woody
Hayes died.
A friend here had asked me the day before if I
had heard that Hayes had died. 1 hadn't. I thought
it ironic 1 was flying to Columbus that afternoon,
and jokingly thanked him for the news. "I'd feel
like an idiot asking why all the flags were flying at
half-mast," I said.
He laughed. Most people remembered Hayes as
the Ohio State football coach who had punched a
Clemson football player in the Gator Bowl eight
years ago. Prior to that, Hayes' eruptions of
temper had become legendary.

In Columbus, though, the flags were at half
mast. Signs outside of restaurants and hotels
paid tribute to Hayes. A vigil was kept inside of
Ohio Stadium, where some students had put up a
sign reading: "Woody Hayes Memorial Stadium."
And Hayes' obituary took up two-thirds of the
front page of The Columbus Dispatch, which ran
seven stories and two pages of photos.
While many remembered Hayes for the ftery
temper that made him a controversial figure and
cost him his job in the end, his players and peers
spoke of a different man.

"Woody Hayes was truly one of the great col
legiate football coaches," Penn State Coach Joe
Paterno said. "He was not the irascible person he
was often portrayed to be; he was rather a man of
great compassion who was a tremendous, positive
influence on the players he coached.
"I never spoke to a young man who played for
Coach Hayes who didn't have an enormous
amount of admiration for him."
Woody Hayes was Ohio State football. And Ohio
State football was an institution in a state of 10
million people. He took over a program in 1951
that was known as the "Graveyard of Coaches"
and made it a national power and a fixture atop
the Big Ten. His legacy of success — 13 conference
titles in 28 years with two national champion
ships — is such that Earle Bruce, his successor, is
berated for having seven straight three-loss
seasons and having never won a Rose Bowl.
Hayes' death came a day before the Ohio State
basketball team opened play in the NCAA tourna
ment. And while the Buckeyes lost in the second
round, an alumnus of Ohio State led his team to
the national championship Monday night.
Bob Knight is another coach whose temper
overshadows his ability. His work in his team's
final three games — a one-point win over
Louisiana State, a four-point win over Nevada-Las
Vegas and the one-point win over Syracuse for the
title — were clinics in coaching. Yet reference was
continually being made to the chair he had
thrown onto the court two years before in a game
with Purdue and the telephone he had slammed


JOHN LIS
onto the scorer's table during the
LSU game.
But Knight also has the other
side that is not dwelled upon as
much. In a time when college
sports are rocked with scandal,
when some schools and coaches
resort to illegal payments to
players to win games and make
money. Knight is a bastion oi in
tegrity. Since he started at In
diana in 1971, only two players
who played four years for the
Hoosiers did not graduate.
Basketball in Indiana is what
football is in Ohio. There are high
school gyms in Indiana larger
than half the arenas in the Pac-10,
and the only way to get a ticket is
to be written into someone's will.
In Ohio, towns of 5,000 people will
get 6,000 people for a high school
football game, and the large
school state championship game
drew 42,000 fans one year.

In both states, the sport is an
institution. And the coach is
larger than life.
As are rivalries. Hayes never
referred to Michigan by name. It
was "that state up north." The
rivalry goes back to 1835, when
the two states fought a war over
Toledo. Ohio won Toledo, Michi
gan got the Upper Peninsula as
compensation, and Wisconsin got
nothing. It's still strong enough
that at least one Ohio native now
at Stanford refused to apply to Mi
chigan because of its football
team.
Things in California are a bit
mellower. Things are a bit more in
perspective. Football at Stanford
is an excuse for the students to
work on their tans and the alumni
to wear red polyester. An 8-4
season is a cause for rejoicing, not
an excuse to fire the coach.
Big Game has an unrivaled
tradition behind it. But one must
dig deep in the archives to find
when the game was for the Rose
Bowl. Even as Stanford football
has completed its resurgence and
is a contending force in the Pac

10. Cal was 2-9 last year.
A ticket to a Stanford game is
not hard to come by — only
35.000 fans showed for the last
home game of last season. And the
community support is negligible
out of an area of almost 6 million.
While Bay Area fans have per
haps a more balanced view of the
role of sports in life, the sense of
community generated elsewhere
by sports is lacking. While one
exposed to the great cultural offer
ings of San Francisco can write off
Indiana basketball crowds by
saying. "What else is there to do in
Bloomington on a Saturday
night." they overlook perhaps that
there is nothing else that people
across Indiana would want to do
on a Saturday night.
Woody Hayes gave to Ohioans
and Bob Knight has given to
Hoosiers successful sports pro
grams that unite people across
their states as only sports can do.
Perhaps California is too sophisti
cated for that. It is doubtful a flag
will ever fly at half-mast for a Stan
ford coach. And perhaps, in some
way, that is unfortunate.
