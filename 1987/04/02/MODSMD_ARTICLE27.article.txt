# Knight and Hayes: What it takes to be successful
## 
### 
I was in Columbus. Ohio, the day after Woody
Hayes died.
A friend here had asked me the day before if I
had heard that Hayes had died. 1 hadn't. I thought
it ironic 1 was flying to Columbus that afternoon,
and jokingly thanked him for the news. "I'd feel
like an idiot asking why all the flags were flying at
half-mast," I said.
He laughed. Most people remembered Hayes as
the Ohio State football coach who had punched a
Clemson football player in the Gator Bowl eight
years ago. Prior to that, Hayes' eruptions of
temper had become legendary.

In Columbus, though, the flags were at half
mast. Signs outside of restaurants and hotels
paid tribute to Hayes. A vigil was kept inside of
Ohio Stadium, where some students had put up a
sign reading: "Woody Hayes Memorial Stadium."
And Hayes' obituary took up two-thirds of the
front page of The Columbus Dispatch, which ran
seven stories and two pages of photos.
While many remembered Hayes for the ftery
temper that made him a controversial figure and
cost him his job in the end, his players and peers
spoke of a different man.

"Woody Hayes was truly one of the great col
legiate football coaches," Penn State Coach Joe
Paterno said. "He was not the irascible person he
was often portrayed to be; he was rather a man of
great compassion who was a tremendous, positive
influence on the players he coached.
"I never spoke to a young man who played for
Coach Hayes who didn't have an enormous
amount of admiration for him."
Woody Hayes was Ohio State football. And Ohio
State football was an institution in a state of 10
million people. He took over a program in 1951
that was known as the "Graveyard of Coaches"
and made it a national power and a fixture atop
the Big Ten. His legacy of success — 13 conference
titles in 28 years with two national champion
ships — is such that Earle Bruce, his successor, is
berated for having seven straight three-loss
seasons and having never won a Rose Bowl.
Hayes' death came a day before the Ohio State
basketball team opened play in the NCAA tourna
ment. And while the Buckeyes lost in the second
round, an alumnus of Ohio State led his team to
the national championship Monday night.
Bob Knight is another coach whose temper
overshadows his ability. His work in his team's
final three games — a one-point win over
Louisiana State, a four-point win over Nevada-Las
Vegas and the one-point win over Syracuse for the
title — were clinics in coaching. Yet reference was
continually being made to the chair he had
thrown onto the court two years before in a game
with Purdue and the telephone he had slammed
