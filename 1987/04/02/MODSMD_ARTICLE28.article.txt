# Fendick 11th in rankings despite undefeated mark
## 
### KEN STEVENS Senior staff writer 
While the NCAA individual
rankings are notorious for not ac
curately reflecting the current
status of collegiate women's ten
nis, the most recently released
rankings seem to defy logic also.
Stanford senior Patty Fendick,
22-0 in 1987, was certain to move
up to the No. 1 singles spot in the
rankings. Instead, she dropped
from No. 4 to No. 11.
The rankings are computer
generated and take into account

participation in major tourna
ments and competition against
highly ranked players. Fendick
has won both tournaments she
has played in, and has knocked off
several top players, although she
was denied the chance to battle
Texas' Beverly Bowes last month
because Bowes was injured.
"It's bogus," Stanford Coach
Frank Brennan said of the
rankings. "It's way out of whack."
San Diego State's Monique
Javer retained her position atop
the individual standings, despite
the fact that Fendick has defeated

her twice in straight sets this
season. Kentucky's Sonia Hahn is
second, followed by Anne Grous
beck of Texas.
Lisa Green, the Cardinal's fresh
man standout, is ranked 19th.
Other Stanford players in the top
50 include junior Cari Hagey (No.
24). junior Kay Tittle (No. 37) and
senior Stephanie Savides (tie for
39th).
As expected, the Cardinal fell
from its No. 1 preseason position
in the team rankings. After suffer
ing two setbacks in the winter,
Stanford is currently at No. 5.
Florida tops the rankings, fol
lowed by UCLA, California and
Miami.
While the Cardinal might have
been disgruntled with the
rankings, the team's spirit was
lifted over spring break by
developments on the court. Stan
ford traveled south, recording a 6-
1 victor}' over SDSU on March 24
and blanking Pepperdine the next
day 9-0. The Cardinal then
returned home last Friday to shut
out Harvard 9-0, raising its 1987
dual-match record to 12-2.
More important than the vic
tories was the return of senior
Leigh Anne Eldredge to the Stan
ford doubles lineup. Eldredge.
who had been kept out of the
lineup all season by a stress
fracture injury, teamed with
Hagey in each of the three
matches over the break.
"She looked pretty good — a
little rusty but not bad." Brennan
said of Eldredge, who two years
ago won the NCAA doubles title
with Linda Gates. "Her instincts
and her hands are a little like, 'I re
member what to do, why can't I do
it?' "
If Eldredge's comeback pro
gresses as expected, she may be in
the singles lineup within two
weeks. "I'd like to have her for
UCLA and USC down there (April
17-18)," Brennan said. Eldredge
played No. 3 singles on the Card

Freshman Lisa Green — a winner of 13 of 14 singles matches this
season — has moved up to No. 19 in the latest national singles
rankings. Green won all three of her matches over spring break as the
Cardinal upped its 1987 record to 12-2.
