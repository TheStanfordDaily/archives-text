# Gooden to be treated for drug use problem
## 
### 
ST. PETERSBURG. Fla. (AP) -
Dwight Gooden. the talented but
troubled New York Mets pitcher,
agreed yesterday to undergo treat
ment for a "drug use problem"
rather than be suspended by Com
missioner Peter Ueberroth.
The 1985 National League Cy
Young award winner probably
would have started on Tuesday
when the World Series champions
open the season against Pitts
burgh.
Mets General Manager Frank
Cashen said Gooden voluntarily
took a drug test earlier this week
and it gave "some indication of
past usage, but the extent is un
certain."
Edwin Durso, baseball's
secretary-treasurer and executive
vice president, said Cashen called
Ueberroth on Monday and told
him "there was a clear indication
of a drug problem."
"The commissioner made it per
fectly clear to the Mets that, con
sistent with past policy, he was
prepared to take severe discipli
nary action against Dwight
Gooden if the player did not seek
an appropriate remedy," Durso
said.

Ueberroth, in a statement from
Chandler. Ariz., said: "Our policy
Is simple. If a player is willing to
help himself, he gets one chance.
If he is unwilling to cooperate or a
problem occurs a second time,
then we will take the penalty
route."
Gooden agreed to treatment fol
lowing a one-and-a-half-hour
meeting yesterday morning with
Cashen and Joe Mcllvaine, the
club vice president of baseball
operations.
Rumors involving Gooden, 22,
and drugs surfaced last summer
after the pitcher's often brilliant
outings became inconsistent. His
record dropped from 24-4 in his
Cy Young season to 17-6 while his
earned run average rose from 1.53
to 2.84.
Gooden also struggled through
a series of off-the-field incidents.
He missed the Mets' ticker-tape
parade after winning the World
Series and then got into a fight
with Tampa police in December.
The Mets placed Gooden on the
15-day disabled list, and team
spokesman Jay Horwitz said, "We
don't know when he'll be back."
