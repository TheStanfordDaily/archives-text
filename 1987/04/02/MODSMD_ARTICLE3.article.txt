# Res Ed urges gays to be RAs
## 
### MARY YUH Senior staff writer 
The Office of Residential Education,
for the second consecutive year. Is expli
citly encouraging gay and lesbian stu
dents to apply for RA positions in an ef
fort to combat homophobia on campus.
An advertisement In yesterday's Daily
stated: "Gay and lesbian students are
encouraged to consider applying to be
RAs, as are all students who can foster
constructive discussion about sexual
preference."
The resident assistant application,
however, does not ask for the applicant's
sexual preference.
"No one would choose an RA because
of sexual preference. That would be ab
solutely out of line," said Alice Supton,

assistant dean of Residential Education.
The primary focus is not on seeking gay
and lesbian RAs, but rather on seeking
RAs who will promote openness to is
sues of sexuality and sexual preference,
she said.
Having gay and lesbian students on
the residence staff, however, is impor
tant in promoting awareness, she
added.
"There is evidence that homophobia
persists at Stanford," Supton said. "Gay
people on the staff who are at ease with
their sexual preference can help to allevi
ate some of the fear, some of the hostil
ity, by promoting discussions."
Dorm residents "can see people in
their fullness as whole human beings,
with sexual Identity just one part of it,"
she added.

There have been at least one or two
gay RAs each of the past several years,
according to Supton. This year there are
four openly gay RAs — all male — from a
total of 184 RAs, according to Adam
Aronson, an RA at Okada who is gay.
These numbers indicate that there are
proportionally fewer RAs who are openly
gay then there are students who are
openly gay, Aronson said. Studies esti
mate that 10 percent of the general pop
ulation is gay.
"We need gay RAs. We need openly gay
people in every facet of this University
and this society so that stereotypes are
broken and people can realize that we
are incredibly diverse people, just as
diverse as heterosexuals," Aronson said.
