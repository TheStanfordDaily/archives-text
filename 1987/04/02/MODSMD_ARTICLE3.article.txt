# Res Ed urges gays to be RAs
## 
### MARY YUH Senior staff writer 
The Office of Residential Education,
for the second consecutive year. Is expli
citly encouraging gay and lesbian stu
dents to apply for RA positions in an ef
fort to combat homophobia on campus.
An advertisement In yesterday's Daily
stated: "Gay and lesbian students are
encouraged to consider applying to be
RAs, as are all students who can foster
constructive discussion about sexual
preference."
The resident assistant application,
however, does not ask for the applicant's
sexual preference.
"No one would choose an RA because
of sexual preference. That would be ab
solutely out of line," said Alice Supton,

assistant dean of Residential Education.
The primary focus is not on seeking gay
and lesbian RAs, but rather on seeking
RAs who will promote openness to is
sues of sexuality and sexual preference,
she said.
Having gay and lesbian students on
the residence staff, however, is impor
tant in promoting awareness, she
added.
"There is evidence that homophobia
persists at Stanford," Supton said. "Gay
people on the staff who are at ease with
their sexual preference can help to allevi
ate some of the fear, some of the hostil
ity, by promoting discussions."
Dorm residents "can see people in
their fullness as whole human beings,
with sexual Identity just one part of it,"
she added.

There have been at least one or two
gay RAs each of the past several years,
according to Supton. This year there are
four openly gay RAs — all male — from a
total of 184 RAs, according to Adam
Aronson, an RA at Okada who is gay.
These numbers indicate that there are
proportionally fewer RAs who are openly
gay then there are students who are
openly gay, Aronson said. Studies esti
mate that 10 percent of the general pop
ulation is gay.
"We need gay RAs. We need openly gay
people in every facet of this University
and this society so that stereotypes are
broken and people can realize that we
are incredibly diverse people, just as
diverse as heterosexuals," Aronson said.
While Res Ed can encourage gay
students to apply for RA positions,
it will not force resident fellows to
choose them. Supton said.
Some RFs are not open to gay
students and are reluctant to
work with them, according to
Aronson. "It seems pretty clear to
me that in the case of some RFs, it
hurts an applicant to be openly
gay," he said.
"Definitely we do something
about those RFs," Supton said.

noting that Res Ed works with
them to help them understand
and overcome their biases. "All of
us are learning in our lives. It's
our job to help the RFs learn. "
Ken Ruebush, an RAin Donner.
said he was openly gay in his ap
plication because he wanted to ac
knowledge the full range of his ex
perience at Stanford, including
involvement in AIDS education
and gay issues.
"The response was good. I got a
lot of interviews." Ruebush said.
"I can't say it's been easy to be
openly gay as an RA. but it has
been a good experience. I was
open with the residents right from

the beginning and I'm really glad. I
think they have matured."
Burbank Resident Fellow Dave
Larue said he thinks encouraging
gay and lesbian students to apply
to be RAs is good.
"The most important thing an
RA can do is stir up discussion,"
he said. "You have to have some
sort of stimulus, and having
people of different backgrounds
and perspectives is important."
"Stanford's kind of an isolated
place," Soto Resident Fellow John
Perry said. "You've got to have RAs
who prevent people from becom
ing too comfortable with their
point of view."
