### EILEEN MATSUMI 
In anticipation of the bicentennial celebration of
the U.S. Constitution a Federal Appeals Court judge
warned yesterday that the nation should remember
that Its original constitution discriminated against
blacks and women even as It upheld ideals of
freedom for white men.
Judge A. Leon Higglnbotham, a visiting professor
at the Stanford Law School, asked a crowd of over
150 at Kresge Auditorium to imagine themselves as
blacks in 1787 Virginia, and to envision a U.S. Con
stitution that was meaningless except to white
males.
Higgenbotham noted that the law of the late 1700s
permitted the rape of female slaves and the arbitrary
murder of blacks by whites.
He said that amendments which have advanced
civil rights — as well as the original constitution —
deserve attention in celebrations commemorating

the bicentennial since they were crucial to the U.S.
Constitution's "evolutionary process.
"There is much about this country which we can
be proud of, but before we lose ourselves In euphoria
we must be somewhat like physicians and diagnose
the problems of an otherwise healthy society.
Scrutiny is necessary to make America what it
should be.
"Far too many prejudices still exist against race,
sex and religion. We do not need to celebrate our
forefathers without our foremothers," Higgenbot
ham said. "Perhaps the forefathers should have
heeded Abigail Adams, who asked that slaves and
women were not forgotten."
Higglnbotham also criticized W. Cleon Skousen's
book. The Making of America." for its prejudiced
presentation of blacks In the 1700s. The book refers
to black children as "pickaninnies" and suggests
that It would be harder on a slave
owner's sensibilities to sell his
slaves' children than for a slave
mother to part with her children.
The judge criticized the Califor
nia division of the Constitution
Bicentennial Commission for
promoting the book. Stanford His
tory Prof. Jack Kakove is one of
five members of the commission,
and he opposed authorization of
the book.
