# Fac Sen to discuss Reagan Library
## Faculty critics hope to block original plan 
### MONIQUE SCHEER Senior staff writer 
If 12 former Faculty Senate chairmen
who signed a statement last month critical
of plans for the Reagan Library have their
way, a scheduled discussion of plans for the
library at today's Faculty Senate meeting
could result in a resolution calling for a re
duction in the size of the library.
The statement by the former chairmen
calls for "a significantly smaller and less
visible structure whose primary functions
clearly would be scholarly research and
seminar instruction."
"I don't know what will happen (at the
meeting) . . . (but) I assume someone will
move something like that statement," said
English Prof. William Chace, a signer of the
statement. "I hope that that document will
be made into a resolution and passes."
Chace said the statement is only
"something to refer to" and has no power as
it now stands, he said, but indicated that it
is significant because it is the only time all
former chairmen currently on campus have
unanimously signed a statement of that
kind.
The agenda for today's meeting includes
presentations by Political Science Prof.
David Abernethy and Reagan Presidential
Foundation Liaison Charles Palm.
Abernethy, who serves as a faculty mem
ber on the Reagan Library Planning Com
mittee, said he will "probably focus on the
question: Why is it (recent faculty concern
over the Reagan Library) so late?" He said

he also plans to discuss briefly the decision
making process and other background in
formation concerning the library.
Palm, who is also chief archivist at the
Hoover Institution, said he will simply
review the plans for the library. "I'm just
going there to present the information." he
said. He intends to address the controversy
surrounding the library plans only in the
question-and-answer period.
Abernethy said he hopes the presenta
tions will "present information that may in
fluence people's decisions" and lead to a
"thorough discussion" of the plans for the
library.
Ultimately, the discussion could lead to a
final resolutlorf by the Senate to recom
mend that the the Board of Trustees hold
off making the final decision regarding the
library plans, Abernethy said.
He said, however, that he and several
other faculty members have adopted a "let's
wait and see" attitude.
History Prof. Gordon Craig, a former
chairman who signed the statement, said
he hasn't "the slightest idea" what to expect
from the meeting today.
"The general state of faculty opinion has
not been clear at this point." he said. But,
he added. "Now, at a very late date, a great
number of people are focusing (on the
issue)." The question may arise whether it
is indeed too late to make any changes, he
added.
Craig speculated that a resolution would
at least be proposed.
If a resolution is voted upon
today, the strength of the vote will
be important, Craig said. A large
majority in favor of postponing a
final decision and for modification
of the library plans "would make
the trustees uncomfortable," he
said.
Craig added he believed most
faculty members were anxious to
"get this thing (the dispute over
plans for the Reagan Library) all
wrapped up."
