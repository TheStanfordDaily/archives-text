# Linear collider tests will begin this month

Scientists hope a major step toward
simulating the beginning of the universe
will come when the *115-million Stanford
Linear Collider (SLC) begins test collisions
of nuclear particles in mid-April, according
to officials at the Stanford Linear Ac
celerator Center (SLAC).
The collider is scheduled to become fully
operational by early summer.
If successful, SLC will be the first collider
in the world capable of producing large
quantities of Z! (Z-zero) particles. It is a
revolutionary upgrade of the existing two
mile-long linear accelerator here and is the
brainchild of Nobel laureate Burton Rich
ter, director of SLAC.
Breaking from the common trend to build
larger and larger circular colliders, the
linear collider accelerates particles along
the two-mile straight path and then forces
them to arc upward in colliding beams,
SLAC public affairs coordinator Doug
Dupen said.
One-hundred billion electron volts of en
ergy will be produced when the beams, flat
tened by magnetic fields to the width of a
human hair, actually collide. Dupen said
that the Z! particle that is the result of colli
sions at such high energy levels is one of the
only known carriers of the weak force, one

of the four forces of physics. The others are
gravity and the electromagnetic and strong
forces.
Physicists hope eventually to be able to
approximate the first few seconds of the
existence of the universe by creating higher
