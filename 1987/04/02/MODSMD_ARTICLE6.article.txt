# Linear collider tests will begin this month

Scientists hope a major step toward
simulating the beginning of the universe
will come when the *115-million Stanford
Linear Collider (SLC) begins test collisions
of nuclear particles in mid-April, according
to officials at the Stanford Linear Ac
celerator Center (SLAC).
The collider is scheduled to become fully
operational by early summer.
If successful, SLC will be the first collider
in the world capable of producing large
quantities of Z! (Z-zero) particles. It is a
revolutionary upgrade of the existing two
mile-long linear accelerator here and is the
brainchild of Nobel laureate Burton Rich
ter, director of SLAC.
Breaking from the common trend to build
larger and larger circular colliders, the
linear collider accelerates particles along
the two-mile straight path and then forces
them to arc upward in colliding beams,
SLAC public affairs coordinator Doug
Dupen said.
One-hundred billion electron volts of en
ergy will be produced when the beams, flat
tened by magnetic fields to the width of a
human hair, actually collide. Dupen said
that the Z! particle that is the result of colli
sions at such high energy levels is one of the
only known carriers of the weak force, one

of the four forces of physics. The others are
gravity and the electromagnetic and strong
forces.
Physicists hope eventually to be able to
approximate the first few seconds of the
existence of the universe by creating higher

and higher energy levels. "The
goal is understanding the Big
Bang theory and proving its
validity." Dupen said.
SLC was built 30 meters under
ground because of the radiation It
produces and is two miles in cir
cumference. It is located near
SLAC on Sand Hill Road.
Because of the collider's
relatively small size only three
years were required for its con
struction. edging out European
competition. The French and
Swiss are building a round col
lider 20 miles in circumference
which is not expected to be com

pleted until 1990. according to
Dupen.
"It's friendly competition.' he
said. "It's always nice to be first
because it means Nobel prizes."
Dupen said SLC will not become
obsolete when the European col
lider is finished. "People will want
to study Z-zeros for hundreds of
years. We need places in America
and Europe."
However, eventually all
machines become obsolete, ac
cording to William Kirk, assistant
director of SLAC. "The average
life-span of these colliders is 10
years. But they can be upgraded."
he said, noting that SLC is an
upgrade of the original ac
celerator.
Kirk said he did not believe that

if the "supercollider, - ' a proposed
52-mile round collider that would
be built near Davis or Stockton
within 10 years, would affect
SLAC adversely because the su
percollider would accelerate
protons while SLC accelerates
electrons.
However, the supercollider will
"supercede everything that has
been built in the amount of energy
it will create: 20 trillion electron
volts," according to Benjamin
Page, a professor emeritus of geol
ogy who served on the supercol
lider's site committee board.
An unexpectedly low budget for
the fiscal year 1987 delayed the
progress of the linear collider,
which was originally scheduled for
completion in early January.
