# Fuzzy job outlook rosier

Liberal arts majors, tradition
ally viewed as good-for-nothing
academics, have become a hot
commodity in the job market for
recent college graduates, na
tional experts report.
At Stanford, however, the
turnaround has been less dra
matic. Still only about one
fourth of the 400 recruiters who
come to campus each year seek
employees trained in the liberal
arts.
A survey conducted by the Col
lege Placement Council last fall
showed for the first time that
companies nationwide extended
more offers to graduates in ac
counting, business and the

humanities than to graduates in
the engineering and other scien
tific and technical disciplines.
Offers to non-technical
graduates exceeded those ex
tended to technical graduates by
6 percent.
"The analytical skills and
breadth of knowledge that a
liberal arts student learns have
become more and more an ap
preciation in the job market."
said Ruth Schneider, head of
the Career Planning and Place
ment Center (CPPC). "It's won
derful."
But she added that "Stanford
has an outstanding school of en
gineering" and most recruiters
who come to Stanford represent
companies in technical and
highly competitive fields, where

the demand for new workers is
high and the supply low.
CPPC workers try to Interest
non-technical companies in
recruiting on campus and the
CPPC makes a pitch to invest
ment banking, acccounting and
other firms for liberal arts
majors. Schneider said.
"We tell them they'll be miss
ing a tremendous core of stu
dents who can be super
employees" by limiting their in
terviews to a few technical
majors, Schneider said.
Finally, the pitch seems to be
paying off.
More companies are now
saying that while they can train
students in technical skills, they
can't teach them the breadth of
knowledge needed to converse
with clients on any topic,
Schneider said.
"We've been hearing from
recruiters for the last five to eight
years about how valuable liberal
arts majors are to them." said

Carolyn Lougee, associate dean of
Humanities and Sciences.
"They've been saying the right
things for awhile but not acting
on them. Now their practices are
in line with their rhetoric."
Lougee said the survey should
be reassuring to liberal arts
majors whose "intellectual pas
sions" lie in the humanities "but
who have been afraid of negative
results in the job market."
"Institutionally we've been

saying students sLould follow
their interests in college to best
prepare them for life. Now this
just backs that up."
The trend may also be a boost to
many faculty members. "It may
give them more confidence in ad
dressing the more practical inter
ests of their students," Lougee
said.
Stanford's CPPC offers career
advising and job placement assis
tance to all students.
