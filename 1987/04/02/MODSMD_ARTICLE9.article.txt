Reagan advises abstinence
PHILADELPHIA — President Reagan, gingerly entering the na
tional debate about AIDS, yesterday defended his administra
tion's efforts In fighting the fatal disease and said, "We've thrown
everything we have Into It," although his administration's spend
ing requests have been below Congress' appropriations.
"I'm convinced we'll find a cure for AIDS," Reagan told a medical
audience, declaring the disease "public health enemy Number 1."
And, speaking publicly on the subject for the second time in two
days, the president Indicated that he favored emphasizing sexual
abstinence and monogamous relationships to prevent the spread
of AIDS.
"Should you just say no?" the president was asked as he left the
White House to speak to the College of Physicians of Philadelphia.
"That's a pretty good answer." he replied.
The subject of AIDS has been a particularly sensitive subject in
the administration, but in an address to the Philadelphia group, a
200-year-old organization made up of 2,100 elected fellows, the
president spent several minutes outlining his administration's ef
forts and citing "unprecedented progress against a major virus."
But, he said, "All the vaccines and medications in the world
won't change one basic truth — that prevention is better than
cure and that's particularly true of AIDS, for which right now
there is no cure.
"This is where education comes in."he said, citing efforts by the
Public Health Service. "The federal role must be to give educators
accurate information about the disease. How that information is
used must be up to schools and parents, not government.
"But let's be honest with ourselves. AIDS information cannot be
what some call value neutral.' After all. when it comes to prevent
ing AIDS, don't medicine and morality teach the same lessons?"
Pinochet welcomes Pope to Chile
SANTIAGO, Chile — This country's unbending strongman,
President Augusto Pinochet, smarting under papal criticism of
his "dictatorial" regime, welcomed Pope John Paul II to Santiago
Wednesday with a stout defense of his government's harsh
measures to uphold what he called "law and order."
Within less than an hour, scattered street protests against the
military government drew police water cannon and tear gas in the
wake of the visiting pontiff.
Youths outside the Metropolitan Cathedral in the historic Plaz
de Armas in the city's historic center, where John Paul was
meeting with non-Catholic leaders, shouted, "Brother John Paul,
take the tyrant home with you," and police moved in with water
cannon.
Tuesday, at the outset of his current two-week South American
pilgrimage, the pope had pointedly challenged Pinochet by charac
terizing the Chilean military regime as "dictatorial" and by sug
gesting that the church move as it did against Philippine Presi
dent Ferdinand E. Marcos to speed Chile's return to democracy.
But in response to the Chilean general's spirited defense of his
strong measures against what he called "the most extreme
materialistic and atheistic" opponents, the pope was more con
ciliatory than many Chilean human rights advocates expected,
and some expressed disappointment.
However, in an evening blessing addressed to all Chileans from
the floodlighted hilltop statue of the Virgin Mary that is a principal
landmark of Santiago, the pontiff pointedly blessed the victims of
violence in the troubled country, and in a clear reference to Pino
chet followers and supporters called upon those who have "given
in to the forces of evil to repent for the sake of peace."
Soviets may talk with Israelis
JERUSALEM — Senior government officials said here yesterday
that a Soviet delegation is expected to arrive for official talks In Is
rael by mid-April in the latest sign of a potentially major shift in
Moscow's attitude toward the Jewish state.
The visit, to be followed at an unspecified future date by a
similar consular-level Israeli trip to the Soviet Union, would mark
the first such exchange between the two countries since Moscow
broke diplomatic relations with Israel during the Six-Day Arab-
Israeli War of 1967.
While the Israelis hope that these Initial contacts will eventually
lead to renewal of formal relations, officials here emphasized that
the exchange of consular visits represents, at most, a small first
step toward that goal.
They specifically denied a Radio Luxembourg report Wednesday
night that Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev has already invited
Israeli Foreign Minister Shimon Peres to visit Moscow.
In contrast to Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir, Peres has
publicly endorsed the idea of an international Middle East peace
conference at which the Soviets could play a role, provided they
first renew relations with Israel. Normally arch political rivals,
Peres and Shamir are temporarily joined together in a tenuous
"national unity" coalition government here.
Talks about a visit here by a Soviet delegation date back to April
1986, when Moscow first proposed such a trip. The Soviets said
they wanted a consular delegation to spend three months here in
order to survey Russian church property in Israel and the occu
pied West Bank of the Jordan River, to contact a few Soviet pass
port holders who live here and to examine the functioning of that
portion of Finland's embassy in Tel Aviv that handles Soviet Inter
ests in Israel.
House committee OKs tax hike
WASHINGTON — The House Budget Committee, splitting along
partisan lines, approved yesterday a Democratic spending
blueprint that calls for >18 billion in unspecified higher taxes and
a sharp cut in the Pentagon budget as the chief means of narrow
ing the federal deficit by an estimated <38.2 billion next year.
The measure, which is expected to go to the House floor next
week, was approved on a2l -14 vote after bitter wrangling between
Democrats and Republicans.
Meanwhile, the Senate budget panel was also nearing approval
of a roughly similar Democratic package calling for balance be
tween tax hikes and spending cuts.
House Budget Committee Chairman William Gray 111, D-Pa., ac
cusing Republicans of refusing to cooperate in preparing the *1
trillion budget, defended the plan developed by the Democrats in
private meetings for producing "real, permanent, substantial defi
cit reduction."
In contrast to President Reagan's budget, which would increase
defense allocations while reducing domestic programs, the House
Democratic package would cut *8.75 billion from both defense
and non-defense spending.
The House package, like Reagan's spending plan, falls short of
the *108 billion deficit goal set by the Gramm-Rudman deficit
reduction law. By relying on the relatively optimistic economic
projections used by the White House, however, both budget
proposals can at least claim to meet the law's ambitious goals.
In contrast to the White House plan, which relied on an assort
ment of revenue increases achieved through higher user fees, hid
den taxes and asset sales, the House Democratic package expli
citly calls for an additional *18 billion in taxes. But the task of ac
tually determining which taxes to raise was left to other congres
sional committees.
Reagan has threatened to veto any legislation containing a tax
Increase.

a sharp cut in the Pentagon budget as the chief means of narrow
ing the federal deficit by an estimated <38.2 billion next year.
The measure, which is expected to go to the House floor next
week, was approved on a2l -14 vote after bitter wrangling between
Democrats and Republicans.
Meanwhile, the Senate budget panel was also nearing approval
of a roughly similar Democratic package calling for balance be
tween tax hikes and spending cuts.
House Budget Committee Chairman William Gray 111, D-Pa., ac
cusing Republicans of refusing to cooperate in preparing the *1
trillion budget, defended the plan developed by the Democrats in
private meetings for producing "real, permanent, substantial defi
cit reduction."
In contrast to President Reagan's budget, which would increase
defense allocations while reducing domestic programs, the House
Democratic package would cut *8.75 billion from both defense
and non-defense spending.
The House package, like Reagan's spending plan, falls short of
the *108 billion deficit goal set by the Gramm-Rudman deficit
reduction law. By relying on the relatively optimistic economic
projections used by the White House, however, both budget
proposals can at least claim to meet the law's ambitious goals.
In contrast to the White House plan, which relied on an assort
ment of revenue increases achieved through higher user fees, hid
den taxes and asset sales, the House Democratic package expli
citly calls for an additional *18 billion in taxes. But the task of ac
tually determining which taxes to raise was left to other congres
sional committees.
Reagan has threatened to veto any legislation containing a tax
Increase.

Reagan advises abstinence
PHILADELPHIA — President Reagan, gingerly entering the na
tional debate about AIDS, yesterday defended his administra
tion's efforts In fighting the fatal disease and said, "We've thrown
everything we have Into It," although his administration's spend
ing requests have been below Congress' appropriations.
"I'm convinced we'll find a cure for AIDS," Reagan told a medical
audience, declaring the disease "public health enemy Number 1."
And, speaking publicly on the subject for the second time in two
days, the president Indicated that he favored emphasizing sexual
abstinence and monogamous relationships to prevent the spread
of AIDS.
"Should you just say no?" the president was asked as he left the
White House to speak to the College of Physicians of Philadelphia.
"That's a pretty good answer." he replied.
The subject of AIDS has been a particularly sensitive subject in
the administration, but in an address to the Philadelphia group, a
200-year-old organization made up of 2,100 elected fellows, the
president spent several minutes outlining his administration's ef
forts and citing "unprecedented progress against a major virus."
But, he said, "All the vaccines and medications in the world
won't change one basic truth — that prevention is better than
cure and that's particularly true of AIDS, for which right now
there is no cure.
"This is where education comes in."he said, citing efforts by the
Public Health Service. "The federal role must be to give educators
accurate information about the disease. How that information is
used must be up to schools and parents, not government.
"But let's be honest with ourselves. AIDS information cannot be
what some call value neutral.' After all. when it comes to prevent
ing AIDS, don't medicine and morality teach the same lessons?"
Pinochet welcomes Pope to Chile
SANTIAGO, Chile — This country's unbending strongman,
President Augusto Pinochet, smarting under papal criticism of
his "dictatorial" regime, welcomed Pope John Paul II to Santiago
Wednesday with a stout defense of his government's harsh
measures to uphold what he called "law and order."
Within less than an hour, scattered street protests against the
military government drew police water cannon and tear gas in the
wake of the visiting pontiff.
Youths outside the Metropolitan Cathedral in the historic Plaz
de Armas in the city's historic center, where John Paul was
meeting with non-Catholic leaders, shouted, "Brother John Paul,
take the tyrant home with you," and police moved in with water
cannon.
Tuesday, at the outset of his current two-week South American
pilgrimage, the pope had pointedly challenged Pinochet by charac
terizing the Chilean military regime as "dictatorial" and by sug
gesting that the church move as it did against Philippine Presi
dent Ferdinand E. Marcos to speed Chile's return to democracy.
But in response to the Chilean general's spirited defense of his
strong measures against what he called "the most extreme
materialistic and atheistic" opponents, the pope was more con
ciliatory than many Chilean human rights advocates expected,
and some expressed disappointment.
However, in an evening blessing addressed to all Chileans from
the floodlighted hilltop statue of the Virgin Mary that is a principal
landmark of Santiago, the pontiff pointedly blessed the victims of
violence in the troubled country, and in a clear reference to Pino
chet followers and supporters called upon those who have "given
in to the forces of evil to repent for the sake of peace."
Soviets may talk with Israelis
JERUSALEM — Senior government officials said here yesterday
that a Soviet delegation is expected to arrive for official talks In Is
rael by mid-April in the latest sign of a potentially major shift in
Moscow's attitude toward the Jewish state.
The visit, to be followed at an unspecified future date by a
similar consular-level Israeli trip to the Soviet Union, would mark
the first such exchange between the two countries since Moscow
broke diplomatic relations with Israel during the Six-Day Arab-
Israeli War of 1967.
While the Israelis hope that these Initial contacts will eventually
lead to renewal of formal relations, officials here emphasized that
the exchange of consular visits represents, at most, a small first
step toward that goal.
They specifically denied a Radio Luxembourg report Wednesday
night that Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev has already invited
Israeli Foreign Minister Shimon Peres to visit Moscow.
In contrast to Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir, Peres has
publicly endorsed the idea of an international Middle East peace
conference at which the Soviets could play a role, provided they
first renew relations with Israel. Normally arch political rivals,
Peres and Shamir are temporarily joined together in a tenuous
"national unity" coalition government here.
Talks about a visit here by a Soviet delegation date back to April
1986, when Moscow first proposed such a trip. The Soviets said
they wanted a consular delegation to spend three months here in
order to survey Russian church property in Israel and the occu
pied West Bank of the Jordan River, to contact a few Soviet pass
port holders who live here and to examine the functioning of that
portion of Finland's embassy in Tel Aviv that handles Soviet Inter
ests in Israel.
