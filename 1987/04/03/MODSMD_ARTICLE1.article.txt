## 
### SUHA JHAVERI Staff writer 
A statewide alliance of Third
World student organizations has
scheduled a march and demon
stration for educational rights at
the State Capitol in Sacramento
April 6.
The march, which is an
ticipated to be California's largest
demonstration of the decade, is
primarily a response to Gov.
George Deukmejian's proposed
cuts in education funding.
"It is a kickoff event to show
that parents, students and
educators are willing to express
their concern about education,"
said Amanda Kemp, president of
Stanford's Black Student Union.
"We must regard education as a
priority, especially for the poor
and people of color, who tend to
lose out the most in budget cuts."
The demands of the "March on
Sacramento" coalition include the
following: Increased funding for
education; the reinstatement of
funding for bilingual education;
improved community colleges and
transfer rights; equal access,
recruitment and retention at four
year colleges; ethnic studies as a
graduation requirement; and stu
dent/community empowerment.
The march will start at 9:30
a.m. at Southside Park, with in
formational and cultural wel
comes. The assembled groups will
then march about 10 blocks to the
capitol steps where, at noon, the
demonstrators will be addressed
by such speakers as the Rev. Jesse
Jackson, State Sen. Art Torres
and Assemblywoman Maxlne
Waters.
During the demonstration on
the Capitol steps, lobbying teams
will talk to senators about educa
tional issues.
The march has been organized
by the African/Black Student
Statewide Alliance (A/BSSA), the
California Statewide Movimiento
Estudlantil Chicano de Aztlan
(MEChA) and the Asian Pacific
Student Union (APSU). Five to
eight thousand people are ex
pected to participate in the
march, one to two hundred of
whom will be Stanford students.
"It is exciting to see the kind of
strength ordinary people can
show when they unite for some
thing they care about," said
Vivian Wu, a member of the Asian-
American Student Association, an
ASSU senator and a statewide co
ordinator of APSU.
