## THE 						STANFORD DAILY An Independent Newspaper March for schools 
### 
On April 6, there will be a major demon
stration on the steps of the State Capitol
building in Sacramento. Thousands of stu
dents. teachers, parents and elected officials
will come out to demand that every Califor
nian, regardless of background, be given a
chance to get a quality education.
It would seem that with an increasing
dropout rate — already over one-third — an
illiteracy rate of nearly one-half among
minority teenagers and a decreasing enroll
ment of minority students in colleges, the
state would do what is necessary to deal with
these problems. Instead, Gov. George Deuk
mejian is proposing the elimination of many
vital programs and paltry increases in spend
ing for education in general.
Clearly, the governor is not providing a so
lution and is instead exacerbating the prob
lem. The proposed budget allocates a $256
million increase for kindergarten through
12th grade, even though nearly twice that
amount will be needed just to maintain the

current level of services. The budget also calls
for increases in tuition for the University of
California, California State and Community
College system that will serve to shut out
even more minority and economically disad
vantaged students.
The California lottery was supposed to be a
boon for education in California. Instead, it
has become a bane for it. The promise to use
lottery revenue to supplement the education
budget has been replaced by a practice of
using that revenue to keep the budget the
same. Obviously, that is not enough.
The march on Monday will serve to remind
those in Sacramento that people will not take
these cuts lightly. A commitment to educa
tion is vital not only to minorities, but to
everyone concerned with the future welfare
of the state. There are sign-up sheets in the
Public Service Center for buses to take inter
ested members of the Stanford community to
Sacramento. Think seriously about putting
your name on one.
