Lots II doesn't
need to move
In response to a recent editorial
about LOTSII (Daily. April 1) I
must say that it seems to me that
The Daily has very little under
standing of the subject. The Daily
writes that the LOTS II facility is
using space in Tresidder when it
could be moved elsewhere. It
brushes over the fact that Univer
sity officials have stated that
there is no other suitable place
for the facility. While it may seem
that LOTS II could be moved, that
is not the case. There is no other
suitable location.
The Daily suggests that Sweet
Hall is not crowded, and could
accommodate the users of LOTS
11. This is often true, but not
always. Toward the end of each
quarter, Sweet Hall and LOTS II
are both crowded. It always seems
that there are open terminals, but
many of those do not work.
Removing the LOTS II facility
would result in Sweet Hall being
crowded much more often. It
would also result in poorer con
sulting service; as one of those
few who volunteers his time to
help LOTS users with their prob
lems, I know that the consultants
at Sweet are often unable to han
dle questions quickly enough to
prevent long lines of people
waiting for help. This problem
would be compounded if LOTS II
were removed, since there would
be no consultants at LOTS II
(because there would be no LOTS
II) who could be asked for help.
Life would be much more difficult

for both consultants and
confused users.
The Daily also suggests that
LOTS II could be moved to the
previous location of some facility
that has been moved to Sweet
Hall. The LOTS II facility would
require the space of several of
those facilities. This would mean
that LOTS II would have to be
divided into smaller units. These
units could not all be manned by
consultants; there are not enough
LOTS consultants as the situa
tion is now. Problem: There
would then be only one center
where users could go for help,
resulting in an increased barrage
of electronic pleas for help di
rected at the consultants. Again,
everyone's life becomes more
difficult.
The Daily's final suggestion is
that LOTS II be moved to the
Forum Room at Meyer Library.
While the Forum Room is prob
ably big enough for all the termi
nals at LOTS 11, LOTS II is not
made up of terminals alone. The
Computer Science Department
maintains certain offices
(primarily TAs) at LOTS 11, and all
of these would not fit in the
Forum Room. Where can we move
LOTS 11, then? The answer is
simple. LOTS II cannot be moved
from its current position without
seriously detracting from the
service provided by LOTS. While
it is true that Tresidder is not an
appropriate place for LOTS 11, it is
clearly more appropriate than no
place at all.

gearing up Jor
this weekend
On Feb. 22, hundreds of stu
dents from schools all over Cali
fornia met at UC-Santa Barbara
to discuss the formation of a new
California progressive student
network. At that conference, they
discussed possible issues the
network could take up, the na
ture and structure of the network
and its position on various is
sues. The participants left this
conference convinced that a net
work could be formed, and later
set a date and place for the next
conference of April 4 and 5 at
UC-Davis.
At this upcoming conference,
we will be developing the network
formally and using the conference
to exchange ideas and opinions
on a diverse range of progressive
topics including anti-apartheid
activism and anti-nuclear activ
ism, among many others. Espe
cially emphasized at this
conference will be the issue of
educational rights; the confer
ence has been structured to en
courage people's active
participation in the April 6 march
on Sacramento for education.
This spring's events promise to
