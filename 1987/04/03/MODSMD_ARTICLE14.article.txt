# ASSU elections: Who has clout?
## 
### 
"The Daily decides the ASSU elections."
I don't know how many times I've heard that
statement — or one like it — over the past
week. The ASSU elections are soon, and The
Daily editorial board will be interviewing can
didates for Council of Presidents and student
groups requesting fee assessments this
weekend. Endorsements will be published
Friday, and listed again on the dates of the
election.
Whether a Daily endorsement really means
anything, though, is open to question. Elec
tion results from the last five years indicate to
me that a Daily endorsement is not the guar
antee of victory many think it to be.

A Daily endorsement for a senate candidate
is almost worthless. Senate candidates can
engage in self-promotion in so many areas
besides The Daily that our endorsement really
doesn't serve any purpose.
In 1982. The Daily endorsed 12 candidates
for the ASSU Senate. Five won. In '83. we had a
better year; seven of the 10 candidates we en
dorsed were elected. Of the 11 Daily-endorsed
senate candidates in 1984. six won. Only three
of the eight candidates recommended for the
senate by The Daily in 1985 took office. And
last year, six of the 10 candidates we endorsed
were elected.
So. in the last five years. The Daily has en
dorsed 51 candidates for senate, and 27 of
those candidates have gone on to win. That's
hardly domination of the process.
Any attempt to measure The Daily's weight
in recommending a vote on student groups' fee
requests yields similar results. When student
groups ask for money, they usually get it — no
matter what The Daily says.
Each year for the last five, anywhere from 14
to 17 student groups have gone on the ballot

asking for money. In no year have more than
five of those groups been denied funds. What's
more, when a group did lose its funding, more
often than not The Daily had little to do with it.
In 1984, for example. The Daily recom
mended that the ASSU Guest Professorship
Bureau not receive ASSU money. The students
voted to give the bureau funds. The Daily, did,
on the other hand, deem the ASSU Lobby Of
fice project worthy of funding. The voters
didn't. And a group called the Stanford Pro
gressive Alliance won a Daily endorsement for
its fee request in 1984, but lost in its bid for
cash on election day.
The ASSU Senate has more clout when it
comes to whether a group gets its fee request.
Two years back, the senate decided it had the
power to split groups' fee assessments into two
parts. It's done that seven times, and five times
the group has lost the second half of its re
quest: students will give a group one sum of
money, but when they see two requests on the
ballot, they must think the group is being a
little greedy.
The senate's election handbook, distributed
with The Daily and available at all polling
places on election days, is also a powerful piece
of propaganda. Of course, the handbook con
tains the senate's recommendations on all
groups' requests, and even has handy descrip
tions of where the money will go (sometimes
the descriptions are less than accurate — last
year, according to the senate, the second part
of The Daily's fee request was to go to a
"reserve" fund).
The Daily's influence with regards to fee as
sessments. then, is much less than the sen
ate's. The senate can split a request or phrase
the description of it in such a way as to subtly
Influence voter opinion; when students vote,
it's the elections handbook they use to find ex
planations of the items on the ballot, not The
Dally.
But all this is not to say that The Dally wields
no influence. In one crucial area of the ASSU
election. The Daily has a huge impact: the race
for COP.
The '80s have yet to see a slate not endorsed
by The Daily win the election. Arguably, most

years the choice is pretty clear, and The Daily
only serves to give a slate added credibility. But
that wasn't the case in 1985, when The Daily
endorsed the Hammer and Coffin slate, and it
isn't the case this year, when there are several
legitimate contenders for COP.
Why does The Daily have so much influence
in this race? I'm not really sure. Maybe it's be
cause students know senate candidates, and
see names on the ballot, whereas COP slate
names — "The Real Solution," "The Philoso
pher Kings" — are less personal. So students
will likely vote for a person they know, but
when faced with a generic slate will pretty
much follow The Daily's recommendation.
And even if a voter doesn't know a senate
candidate personally, it's easier to familiarize
oneself with a single candidate than with a
group of four candidates. At least this year,
there are so many COP slates that perhaps
voters feel the slates are all the same. Perhaps a
Daily endorsement helps separate a slate from
the pack.
On the other hand, perhaps a Daily endorse
ment needlessly clouds the issues. After all,
isn't the endorsement only the opinion of a few
students? Shouldn't the student body decide
for itself which slates, amendments and fee re
quests it favors?
The answer to both questions is yes. The
Daily editorial board does consist of 11 stu
dents, eight Daily editors and three at-large
members. Students should decide for them
selves how to vote — and hopefully. The Daily
helps them to make an informed decision.
The Daily endorsement was never meant as
an iron-clad statement of fact; it's only an
opinion. But it is a consensus opinion of 11
students who have had a chance to meet and
discuss the Issues with the candidates and
groups involved. Not many students get that
chance.
I've heard a lot of people say that on election
day, students take a ballot, take a Dally and
vote "The Daily line." I don't think that's true. I
hope it's not. I'd like to give Stanford students
a little more credit than that.
Michael Newman is editor of The Daily.
