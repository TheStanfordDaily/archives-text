# 'Hoosiers' is not racist
## 
### 
While reading Lawrence Shorter's viewpoint
criticizing the movie "Hoosiers" as being racist
(Daily, March 31), I was alarmed at the insufficient
amount of research the author did on his subject.
Perhaps he did not realize that this motion picture
was based on an actual small-town high school bas
ketball team that captured the Indiana state title in
1954. During its rise to the championship game, the
team (actually from Milan, Ind.) did defeat a black
team in the semifinals. In fact, it was an all-black
squad from an inner city school. By missing this key
element, Shorter has failed to examine the circum
stances surrounding a real event that the movie
makers have attempted to recreate and adapt to the
silver screen and, therefore, has received a very
clouded view of the purpose behind this film.

STEVEN STRUTHERS

It is the unstated responsibility of directors, writ
ers and even actors to accurately portray any situa
tion that they include in their movies. Whether the
scene, such as the basketball game in this movie,
displays racism or, for that matter, the persecution
of any group, is not the concern of these profession
als. Their job is to stay as close to the truth as is ar
tistically possible. Now, while Shorter — with his
background and experience as a resident of the
Hoosier state — may believe that there would be
more blacks attending the games (because, in his
words. "Come on, this is basketball!"), the writers,
etc. have researched material from that era and have
decided how to cast their crowds for the games.
Please remember that this story takes place in the
'50s and though we would like not to admit it, racism
in the rural areas of Indiana and other states at that
time was quite rampant and I seriously doubt that
many blacks would be attending farm-town high
school basketball games. So. how can someone
legitimately attack the script when it is making an
earnest effort to depict actual events!
To use another example, in the highly acclaimed
drama "Platoon," the black American G.I. is shown
In less than glorifying terms (uneducated, perform

ing ungratifying jobs when he is not fighting on the
front lines of battle, etc.), but there was no outcry of
racism from groups over the portrayal of these char
acters. The primary reason for this lack of protest is
that it is widely known that the typical grunt in Viet
nam had those very characteristics. Director Oliver
Stone (who won an Oscar both for his movie and his
directing) should be commended for his work to
bring the real story behind the Vietnam experience
to the theaters. Likewise, we, as moviegoers, cannot
overlook the accurate representation of moods, ideas
and, yes, even prejudices in a movie such as
"Hoosiers."
Personally, I detest the accusations that Shorter
makes in assuming that the film plays "upon the
racist tendencies of the American audience." As I
have shown, the writers were simply relating the tale
of a tiny high school's bid for a state championship
in which they happened to play a team dominated by
black players. I can only imagine his reaction if the
movie had been even truer to the point and had
pitted the Huskies against a team completely
composed of blacks. Furthermore, is Shorter sug
gesting that because I cheer for the underdog Hick
ory team I am a racist? Well, Shorter has completely
overstepped his bounds as a Journalist? Perhaps, too.
Shorter thinks I am anti-American or a Communist
because I am angered by American actions In Viet
nam as portrayed in "Platoon" or that by cheering for
Rocky in his first three movies I am again racist be
cause Sly Stallone is boxing black fighters. I think
not!
I believe that Shorter's column represents a clear
example of someone grossly misinterpreting a mo
tion picture as an attack on a particular group of
people, which it is not. Unfortunately, people who
are not aware that the movie is based on real history
can be led astray by such an article into believing
that Hollywood as a whole is obsessed with assailing
the black race through the use of films. This is non
sense! Ironically, though, my advice is similar to
Shorter's: Go see "Hoosiers," not "in order to get a
feel for the subtle offenses that we often let slip by,"
but because of the exciting story and excellent act
ing. The basketball isn't too bad either.
