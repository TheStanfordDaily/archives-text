# 10 days in El Salvador: A personal perspective
## 
### 
Daily reporter Nannette Thompson
traveled to El Salvador over spring break
as part of the Stanford Student El Sal
vador Aid Project. What follows are her
reflections on her experiences and the sit
uation in the country.
El Salvador should be the ideal tropical
vacation spot. The weather is hot; the
beaches are beautiful. One of the first
things one sees upon walking through the
airport are the lovely leafy trees and pink
and orange flowers.
The next thing one sees is a soldier
leaning against his machine gun.
El Salvador is a nation at war. a fact that
was made manifest on many occasions
during my spring break vacation in the
Central American country. I went with 13
other Stanford students as part of the Stan
ford Student El Salvador Aid Project, which
was sponsored by several different groups,
including the Public Service Center and
Memorial Church.
Stanford students were invited by the
students and regent of the University of San
Salvador, In part to reconstruct university
buildings damaged In an earthquake last
October. Our bigger task was to try to get a
feel for the political and social situation of
the war-torn country by talking with people
ranging from those In refugee camps to
army personnel.
There are obvious signs of war in El Sal
vador. Military soldiers are everywhere -
on street corners, riding in the backs of

pick-up trucks and poised at dusty
roadblocks in country outskirts.
Many of the soldiers are young. They are
16 and 17 years old, each dressed in khaki
and camouflage uniforms with an M-16 ma
chine gun slung casually over his shoulder.
There are many signs of unrest. Our trip
coincided with the seventh anniversary of
the death of Archbishop Oscar Romero,
who was assassinated in 1980 by right
wing death squads. On Tuesday. March 24.
students, religious, community and labor
union members, and human rights leaders
staged a march for peace in commemora
tion of the archbishop, a man whom for
many had stood as a symbol of hope and as
an advocate of reform.
During this march — in which most of
the Stanford group participated — gun
shots were fired a block-and-a-half behind
us, a reminder to me personally of the
realities of war that the Salvadoreans face
daily.
The grim reminders of the war. including
military helicopters flying overhead and the
nightly blackout in industrial sectors be
tween 9 p.m. and midnight in order to con
serve utilities, are readily apparent. But It
was the human effects of the war that made
the deepest impression on me.
Human rights are repressed in El Sal
vador.
We spoke with a slightly plump, middle
aged woman from Co-Madres, an organiza-
tion of mothers whose family members have
either been Imprisoned by the military or have
disappeared without a trace. These mothers
help family members try to relocate loved ones.
Co-Madres has been awarded the Kennedy
Award for Peace for its attempt to stop human
rights violations in El Salvador. However,
when they were Invited to pick up their prize
and speak in the United States last year, the
U.S. government denied them visas.
Groups that advocate human rights, such as
Co-Madres, are often labeled subversive by the
U.S.-backed Salvadorean government. When
we spoke to the deputy ambassador at the U.S.
Embassy, he called Co-Madres a front group
for leftist guerillas.
The mother from Co-Madres told us what
happened when she spoke out against the dis
appearance of her son. She said she was ab
ducted on the street by government forces on
May 29, 1986. With a mixture of numbness
and pain on her face, she described how she
was stripped of her clothes, blindfolded and in
terrogated repeatedly for a period of 13 days
while being deprived of both food and water. At
the termination of the torture, she was sent to
Ilopongo, a womens' prison, for a period of
eight months. At the time she spoke to us she
had been out of prison one month.
Other political prisoners also spoke of their
torture at the hands of the government. A
human rights worker from the non

government commission on human rights told
us how he was stripped and blindfolded. He
was beaten and also denied bathroom
privileges, food and water while being forced to
do physical exercise for extended periods of
time.

There are obvious signs of war in El Salvador.
Military soldiers are everywhere - on street
corners, riding in the backs of pick-up trucks.

"You get to a point where you are psychologi
cally and physically worn out," he said. "It Is
insufferable. One feels like a ball batted around
in a baseball game. They use your body
sexually In abnormal ways. It makes you feel
inhuman. You have no will — they decide
everything that will happen to you, and you
will do whatever they choose."
A military officer who spoke with us said it
was "logical" to use torture during times of
war.
Despite the repression that they faced for
speaking out for human rights and a just
democracy, I was struck by the deep commit
ment human and social rights leaders have
toward making their country a better place to
live for the majority of the people.

The convictions of the human rights leaders
are grounded in the realities of everyday life
where children are starving, women are raped,
families are displaced from their places of
origin by bombings and a handful of in
dustrialists controls 90 percent of the

country's wealth.
"We fight for justice even if they try to per
secute us." said the male human rights worker
from the non-government human rights com
mittee.
"It's not a matter of fear. Jt's one of convic
tion." said one of the student leaders.
Human and social rights leaders called the
Salvadoran government a democracy in name
only.
"The Salvadoran government is one of ap
pearances. . . . They speak of democracy (but)
how can there be democracy when there's such
persecution of the people for political
reasons?" said the same human rights leader.
It was a sentiment echoed by many of the
groups and leaders to whom we talked.

Daily reporter Nannette Thompson
traveled to El Salvador over spring break
as part of the Stanford Student El Sal
vador Aid Project. What follows are her
reflections on her experiences and the sit
uation in the country.
El Salvador should be the ideal tropical
vacation spot. The weather is hot; the
beaches are beautiful. One of the first
things one sees upon walking through the
airport are the lovely leafy trees and pink
and orange flowers.
The next thing one sees is a soldier
leaning against his machine gun.
El Salvador is a nation at war. a fact that
was made manifest on many occasions
during my spring break vacation in the
Central American country. I went with 13
other Stanford students as part of the Stan
ford Student El Salvador Aid Project, which
was sponsored by several different groups,
including the Public Service Center and
Memorial Church.
Stanford students were invited by the
students and regent of the University of San
Salvador, In part to reconstruct university
buildings damaged In an earthquake last
October. Our bigger task was to try to get a
feel for the political and social situation of
the war-torn country by talking with people
ranging from those In refugee camps to
army personnel.
There are obvious signs of war in El Sal
vador. Military soldiers are everywhere -
on street corners, riding in the backs of

pick-up trucks and poised at dusty
roadblocks in country outskirts.
Many of the soldiers are young. They are
16 and 17 years old, each dressed in khaki
and camouflage uniforms with an M-16 ma
chine gun slung casually over his shoulder.
There are many signs of unrest. Our trip
coincided with the seventh anniversary of
the death of Archbishop Oscar Romero,
who was assassinated in 1980 by right
wing death squads. On Tuesday. March 24.
students, religious, community and labor
union members, and human rights leaders
staged a march for peace in commemora
tion of the archbishop, a man whom for
many had stood as a symbol of hope and as
an advocate of reform.
During this march — in which most of
the Stanford group participated — gun
shots were fired a block-and-a-half behind
us, a reminder to me personally of the
realities of war that the Salvadoreans face
daily.
The grim reminders of the war. including
military helicopters flying overhead and the
nightly blackout in industrial sectors be
tween 9 p.m. and midnight in order to con
serve utilities, are readily apparent. But It
was the human effects of the war that made
the deepest impression on me.
Human rights are repressed in El Sal
vador.
We spoke with a slightly plump, middle
aged woman from Co-Madres, an organiza-
tion of mothers whose family members have
either been Imprisoned by the military or have
disappeared without a trace. These mothers
help family members try to relocate loved ones.
Co-Madres has been awarded the Kennedy
Award for Peace for its attempt to stop human
rights violations in El Salvador. However,
when they were Invited to pick up their prize
and speak in the United States last year, the
U.S. government denied them visas.
Groups that advocate human rights, such as
Co-Madres, are often labeled subversive by the
U.S.-backed Salvadorean government. When
we spoke to the deputy ambassador at the U.S.
Embassy, he called Co-Madres a front group
for leftist guerillas.
The mother from Co-Madres told us what
happened when she spoke out against the dis
appearance of her son. She said she was ab
ducted on the street by government forces on
May 29, 1986. With a mixture of numbness
and pain on her face, she described how she
was stripped of her clothes, blindfolded and in
terrogated repeatedly for a period of 13 days
while being deprived of both food and water. At
the termination of the torture, she was sent to
Ilopongo, a womens' prison, for a period of
eight months. At the time she spoke to us she
had been out of prison one month.
Other political prisoners also spoke of their
torture at the hands of the government. A
human rights worker from the non

government commission on human rights told
us how he was stripped and blindfolded. He
was beaten and also denied bathroom
privileges, food and water while being forced to
do physical exercise for extended periods of
time.

"You get to a point where you are psychologi
cally and physically worn out," he said. "It Is
insufferable. One feels like a ball batted around
in a baseball game. They use your body
sexually In abnormal ways. It makes you feel
inhuman. You have no will — they decide
everything that will happen to you, and you
will do whatever they choose."
A military officer who spoke with us said it
was "logical" to use torture during times of
war.
Despite the repression that they faced for
speaking out for human rights and a just
democracy, I was struck by the deep commit
ment human and social rights leaders have
toward making their country a better place to
live for the majority of the people.

The convictions of the human rights leaders
are grounded in the realities of everyday life
where children are starving, women are raped,
families are displaced from their places of
origin by bombings and a handful of in
dustrialists controls 90 percent of the

country's wealth.
"We fight for justice even if they try to per
secute us." said the male human rights worker
from the non-government human rights com
mittee.
"It's not a matter of fear. Jt's one of convic
tion." said one of the student leaders.
Human and social rights leaders called the
Salvadoran government a democracy in name
only.
"The Salvadoran government is one of ap
pearances. . . . They speak of democracy (but)
how can there be democracy when there's such
persecution of the people for political
reasons?" said the same human rights leader.
It was a sentiment echoed by many of the
groups and leaders to whom we talked.
