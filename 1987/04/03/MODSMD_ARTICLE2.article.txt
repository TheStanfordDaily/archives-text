### 
Daily reporter Nannette Thompson
traveled to El Salvador over spring break
as part of the Stanford Student El Sal
vador Aid Project. What follows are her
reflections on her experiences and the sit
uation in the country.
El Salvador should be the ideal tropical
vacation spot. The weather is hot; the
beaches are beautiful. One of the first
things one sees upon walking through the
airport are the lovely leafy trees and pink
and orange flowers.
The next thing one sees is a soldier
leaning against his machine gun.
El Salvador is a nation at war. a fact that
was made manifest on many occasions
during my spring break vacation in the
Central American country. I went with 13
other Stanford students as part of the Stan
ford Student El Salvador Aid Project, which
was sponsored by several different groups,
including the Public Service Center and
Memorial Church.
Stanford students were invited by the
students and regent of the University of San
Salvador, In part to reconstruct university
buildings damaged In an earthquake last
October. Our bigger task was to try to get a
feel for the political and social situation of
the war-torn country by talking with people
ranging from those In refugee camps to
army personnel.
There are obvious signs of war in El Sal
vador. Military soldiers are everywhere -
on street corners, riding in the backs of

pick-up trucks and poised at dusty
roadblocks in country outskirts.
Many of the soldiers are young. They are
16 and 17 years old, each dressed in khaki
and camouflage uniforms with an M-16 ma
chine gun slung casually over his shoulder.
There are many signs of unrest. Our trip
coincided with the seventh anniversary of
the death of Archbishop Oscar Romero,
who was assassinated in 1980 by right
wing death squads. On Tuesday. March 24.
students, religious, community and labor
union members, and human rights leaders
staged a march for peace in commemora
tion of the archbishop, a man whom for
many had stood as a symbol of hope and as
an advocate of reform.
During this march — in which most of
the Stanford group participated — gun
shots were fired a block-and-a-half behind
us, a reminder to me personally of the
realities of war that the Salvadoreans face
daily.
The grim reminders of the war. including
military helicopters flying overhead and the
nightly blackout in industrial sectors be
tween 9 p.m. and midnight in order to con
serve utilities, are readily apparent. But It
was the human effects of the war that made
the deepest impression on me.
Human rights are repressed in El Sal
vador.
We spoke with a slightly plump, middle
aged woman from Co-Madres, an organiza-
