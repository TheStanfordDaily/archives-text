# The 						people of El Salvador

### 
The student delegation
from Stanford will never
forget the people they
met in El Salvador. Al
though looking into the
eyes of the people did not
offer solutions to the
complexities of the situa
tion in El Salvador, it did
impress upon them the
urgent need to resolve
the intense conflict that
exists in El Salvador.
