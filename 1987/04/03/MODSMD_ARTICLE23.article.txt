## Swimmers in second, set to take NCAAs 
### ERIK ESELIUS Senior staff writer 
AUSTIN, Tex. — Amid a bois
terous atmosphere where sound
waves tap-danced on eardrums,
the Stanford men's swimming
team generated its own sizable
waves on the scoreboard, placing
four points behind USC on the
first day of the NCAA champion
ships here.
Swimming in the neatly gut
tered Texas pool, considered the
fastest in the country, Stanford
stroked out an impressive 99
points, one point shy of Stanford
Coach Skip Kenney's goal.
"We wanted 100 going into
tonight," Kenney said. "I feel like
we're right where we want to be."
Sophomore Matt Nance, who
placed 10th overall in the 200-
yard Individual medley, accen
tuated the point. "If we're near
first after tonight — the meet's
over," he said, adding that Stan
ford was not expected to lead after
the opening stanza. "The next two
days we're far superior to anyone
else — that's what's exciting."
Finishing after USC (103

points) and Stanford (99) was
Florida (80), followed by California
(60). Texas (56), Louisiana State
(51), Michigan (49). UCLA (47).
Without even looking ahead,
sophomore Jay Mortenson was
plenty excited. Leading off the 400
medley relay. Mortenson's 100-
yard backstroke split time not
only staked Stanford to a substan
tial initial lead but it also ex
punged UCLA's Tom Jager from
the record books.
Mortensen's time of 47.94 shat
tered Jager's mark by over a quar
ter of a second, a lot in sprinting
terms.
"It's a very pleasant surprise
that I broke the record," Morten
son said, who attributed his im
proved times to working on his
dolphin kick with teammates
Pablo Morales, Sean Murphy and
Anthony Mosse. "I'm trying to
keep it (the record) in perspective.
What's so much more important is
the team's success."
The medley quartet of Morten
son, Sam Schwartz, Morales and
John Hodge touched home first at
3:12:05, approximately a second
off the American record. The vic-

Tory sliced USC's 25-point lead to
the day-ending four-point margin.
The Trojans grabbed the early
advantage with their 500 freestyle
horses, who completed a 1-2-3
sweep.
Then Morales toed the starting
block. Taking his customary deep
breaths and putting in his full al
lotment of preliminary arm
swings, Morales scorched the
opening butterfly and ensuing
backstroke leg of his 200IM swim.
A fatigued Morales then hung
on to his substantial lead in the
final 100 freestyle yards to com
plete the victory, and perhaps
more importantly, to swing the
momentum back to the Cardinal.
"Pablo's swim epitomizes what
it means to swim at night in the
finals," Kenney said. "In the
morning (time trials) you tried to
place. At night you race to win.
Pablo did exactly what he had to
do. He got the psychological ad
vantage with the big lead and then
put up with the lactic acid at the
end."
Stanford also got a big lift from

The Stanford men's swim team had plenty to cheer about yesterday at the NCAA championships in Aus
tin, Tex. Trailing USC by only four points after the first day, the Cardinal looks to be in perfect striking po
sition going into the weekend.
