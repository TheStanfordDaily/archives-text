### MARK SMOYER Staff writer 
An article filling every inch of space in the entire
sports section could not do justice to the infinite
list of credentials that this weekend's men's gym
nastics Pacific 10 Conference championship
boasts.
The Stanford community is fortunate this year
— the short distance to Maples Pavilion is all that
needs to be covered for a very satisfying dose of
mid-air acrobatics, superman strength and
frightening flexibility. In addition, if you like to
feel relatively tall. Maples is the place to be.
While the term hyperbole may be assigned to
parts of the above paragraphs, the meet — featur

ing two sessions today (4 and 8 p.m.) and two
more tomorrow (1:30 and 7:30 p.m.) — really is
the next best thing to the NCAA championships.
So, who's the big deal? Well, there's Cal State-
Fullerton, the nation's No. 1 team, UCLA, No. 3,
13th-ranked Arizona State — the defending na
tional champions — and three other teams that
rank among the top 15, including No. 15 Stan
ford, the third-place team at last year's NCAAs.
Individually, the meet will include performances
from two 1984 Olympians — Fullerton standout
Li Xiao Ping, from China, and Bruin Tony Pineda,
from Mexico. Curtis Holdsworth, who finished
first overall in last summer's competition for the

Cardinal gymnast Chuck Gerardo will lead his teammates into the Pac-10 team competition tonight
at Maples Pavilion. Gerardo also figures to be in contention for individual honors tomorrow.
U.S. national team, Is just one of
four Bruins on the U.S. squad.
Stanford's Chuck Gerardo and
Mike Matzek. and California's Bob
Sundstrom are among the other
individuals who have a solid
chance at the Pac-10 all-around
title.
More specifically, the routines of
certain elite gymnasts on certain
events will Include maneuvers at
tempted by only a few others
anywhere In the country. While
many of these tricks will over
looked by the spectators, some,
such as Matzek's double layout on
the floor exercise and Pineda's
"Gaylord Two" high bar release are
tough to miss even in comparison
to the otherwise phenomenal feats
that will occur constantly across

the Maples Pavilion floor in a sort
of six-ring circus atmosphere.
Besides Matzek on the floor and
Pineda on the high bar, other
routines that will highlight the
meet are New Mexico's Chad Fox
on the vault (ranked No. 1 nation
ally and defending NCAA cham
pion) and floor (No. 1). ASU's Jerry
Burrell on the floor (No. 2 and
NCAA champ) and Ping on the
pommel horse (No. 1 and former
world champion) and parallel bars
(No. 1).
The normal fan will want to be
present at tonight's 8 p.m. team
competition and at the Individual
championships tomorrow night at
7:30 p.m., which could be consid
ered the all-star meet. Addicts, of
course, are welcome to enjoy the
more than 10 hours of gymnastics
which will take place over the two
days.
Disappointing scores in the
Cardinal's last two meets make Its

outlook for a NCAA berth bleak;
however, the quality of the
squad's performance since
recovering from a variety of injur
ies has been superb. Time may
have run out for Stanford, which,
although it has been raising its
scoring average consistently for
the past four weeks, does not have
any meets on its schedule after the
Pac-lOs.
Barring a charge of divine power
from the gymnastics gods and dis
aster for its competition this
weekend, the Cardinal will prob
ably not have broken into the top
10 by season's end and will have to
wait until next year for another
trip to the national champion
ships. Nevertheless, especially
with the home-floor advantage.
Stanford is a serious threat to up
set Fullerton or UCLA and take the
Pac-10 title.
Tickets are *2 with student
identification.
