# Card nine travels to Troy
## 
### TOM SENF Senior staff writer 
Quick: Name the only Pacific 10
Southern Division team to win
last year s season series against
Stanford?
Six-Pac champion UCLA? Nope.
In the six games between the two
teams, the Cardinal handed the
Bruins four of their nine confer
ence losses.
NCAA champion Arizona?
Wrong again. The Cardinal
opened the Six-Pac season by
taking two of three from the
Wildcats in Tucson, then did it
again two months later at Sunken
Diamond.
The correct answer is USC. Al
though they finished just two
games out of the conference cellar
(at 12-18) last year, the Trojans
went 4-2 against Stanford, includ
ing a three-game sweep at
Dedeaux Field in Los Angeles.
The Cardinal will be looking for
revenge this weekend when it
heads south to meet the Trojans
in a three-game series beginning
tonight at 7 p.m. Tomorrow's
game will also be at 7 p.m., with
the series finale Sunday at 1 p.m.
Stanford's difficulty with USC
last year was a big factor in the
Cardinal's failure to defend its
1985 Six-Pac title. Stanford
finished 18-12, three games be
hind UCLA.
Similar problems with the
Trojans this year could once again
mean a pennant for the Bruins.
Stanford leads the Six-Pac in win
ning percentage with an 8-2
record but actually trails UCLA
(11-4) by half a game. USC Is in
third place at 6-6.
According to Stanford Coach
Mark Marquess, last year's sweep
was not the result of particular

problems caused by the Trojans,
but Instead showed the overall
strength of the Six-Pac.
"It's just indicative of our
league," Marquess said. "It doesn't
really matter if it's the first-place
team against the last-place team
— if you don't play well, you get
beat. We didn't play well, and we
got swept."
So don't expect the Cardinal to
be looking past the Trojans
toward next weekend's showdown
with UCLA at Sunken Diamond.
"There's no way any of our
coaches or players are even think-

ing about UCLA," Marquess said.
"There's no chance of that hap
pening, I guarantee you that."
Momentum will certainly be on
Stanford's side, as the Cardinal
has won eight consecutive Six-Pac
games and 12 of the last 13 overall
to raise its record to 23-9. The
Trojans have dropped five straight
league games, although they did

win the Diamond Club Classic
this week in Mobile, Ala.
"Our young players have been
getting better, but we've had to
overcome some things," Marquess
said. "Troy Paulsen being out for
the year (knee injury) hurt us, and
Jack (McDowell) got off to a slow
start, but we have improved."
With the loss of All Six-Pac
performers Brad Brink, Dan Hen
ley and last year's league batting
champion Scott Sommers, things
didn't look pretty for the Trojans
as the season began. They got
downright ugly when Coach Rod

Dedeaux, the winningest coach in
collegiate baseball history,
decided to retire after 42 years at
the helm.
But Mike Gillespie stepped in
and started winning games like he
was the second coming of. . .well,
Dedeaux — although he's still
about 1,300 victories short.
The new USC mentor led the
Trojans to a 6-1 Slx-Pac start and
a spot In the nation's top 10 using
a blend of stingy pitching and
scrappy offense. "Coach Gil
lespie's done a good Job,"
Marquess said. "They're a differ
ent type of team now. They hit and
run, bunt, steal — they put pres
sure on you."
With their current losing streak,
it would be easy to say that the
Trojans' luck has run out, but
Marquess does not expect them to
collapse. "They may not surprise
as many people, but I still think
they're a solid team because of
their pitching." he said.
Entering this week, USC trailed
only Stanford In Slx-Pac ERA.
3.83 to 3.90. but that was before
the Trojans allowed Just seven
runs In three games while the
Cardinal staff allowed 10 to
Nevada Las-Vegas before shutting
out St. Mary's. USC won the Dia
mond Club tournament without

surrendering a run In Its two
games.
Righthander Darrln Beer, who
Is 5-4 with a 3.71 ERA and Is tied
for the conference strikeout lead
with UCLA's Alex Sanchez at 59,
will start for USC tonight against
McDowell (4-1, 5.06). Tomorrow It
will be John RelUy (4-2. 4.12) for
the Trojans against Lee Plemel (5-
4. 3.39). and on Sunday Randy
Powers (3-1. 3.83) will oppose
Stanford's Jim Price (3-0, 4.10).
KZSU Radio (90.1 FM) will
broadcast all three games.
Card notes
Plemel is fourth among Slx-Pac
strikeout artists with 52, Price is
sixth with 43 and McDowell is ninth
with 37. Of the top 10 in the confer
ence, only Sanchez, Price and
McDowell have fanned one or more per
inning.
Cardinal third baseman Ed Sprague
has a nine-game hitting streak.
During last month's 11-game Card
inal winning streak, the team hit .332
and boasted a .549 slugging
percentage.
In a six-game span during that
streak, Amaro went 14-for-31 (.452) at
the plate, with 11 runs scored and
four runs batted In.
