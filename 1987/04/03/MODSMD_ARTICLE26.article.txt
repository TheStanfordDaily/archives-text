Two teams heading In opposite
directions will visit Stanford today
and tomorrow as the fifth-ranked
Cardinal women's tennis team
looks to extend its five-match win
streak.
UCLA, ranked No. 2 in the na
tion. battles the Cardinal today at
noon at the Stanford Tennis
Stadium. Tomorrow at noon,
seventh-ranked USC will take on
the Cardinal.
For the past six seasons. Stan
ford and USC have taken turns
winning the NCAA team champi
onship. while UCLA has played
second fiddle on the West Coast.
This year, however, the Bruins
seem to have overcome the per
sonality conflicts that have char
acterized their teams the past few
years.
"They've gotten some good
players over the years, but they
naven't really developed them."'
Stanford Coach Frank Brennan
said. "This year, they're playing
up to their potential. They re
going to be a real challenge for
us."
The Bruins' top player is Jane
Thomas, whose considerable tal

ent has frequently been over
shadowed by her behavioral prob
lems on the court. If she doesn't
let her temper get in the way of her
tennis, Thomas could give the
Cardinal's Patty Fendick a tough
match.
"Thomas is a good athlete,"
Brennan said. "She can certainly
play with Patty. She's probably the
best athlete Patty will see all year.
She's never beaten her, but the
matches have always been close."
UCLA has the depth to match
the Cardinal from top to bottom.
Jennifer Fuchs ai?d Joni Urban
have both played No. 1 for the
Bruins at one point in their
careers, and UCLA has several
other players with considerable
experience.
Inexperience and injuries have
led to the relative demise of the
USC team this season. The
Trojans returned four players
from last year's squad, which nar
rowly lost to the Cardinal in the
NCAA final. However. Caroline
Kuhlman, last year's collegiate
standout and the last player to
defeat Fendick in college, has been
beset by sore knees and conse
quently has played very sparingly
this season. Kuhlman is 3-2 over
all and has not played in the
Trojans' last three matches.
"I heard she's through for the
year." Brennan said. "She may be
playing, she may not be playing."
With Kuhlman's availability lim
ited. USC has dropped to 12-5 this
season, including a 6-3 loss at
UCLA. In addition to Kuhlman.
Mary Norwood has also been set
back by injuries. Norwood has
