# Card men visit No. 3 Bruins, No. 1 Trojans
## 
### JON WEISMAN Staff writer 
Last year, the Stanford men's
tennis team traveled to Los An
geles to finish off the Pacific 10
Conference season against UCLA
and USC. The Cardinal, which
was a game behind UCLA in the
standings, was subsequently
trounced in both matches by
identical 7-2 scores, leaving them
tied for second with USC in the
conference.
Today. Stanford journeys south
again, and although it's early in
the Pac-10 season, the matches
are virtually as important. The
Cardinal, which faltered earlier
this season against top-20 oppo
nents, must put up a good
showing against the No. 3 Bruins
and the top-ranked Trojans to
impress the NCAA post-season
tournament selection committee.
"I think we've done everything
we can do to prepare for the part of
the season that's coming up."
Stanford Coach Dick Gould said.
"We have a little momentum going
— we haven't played any USCs or
UCLAs or Long Beach State's, but
we've played some pretty good
teams."
Stanford is 9-5 this season,
having won six matches in a row.
and is 2-0 in Pac-10 competition.
"It's going to be really interest

ing to see what we can do," Gould
said. "It's important that we have
good competitive solid efforts. If
we do, and if our doubles continue
to improve — and we're working
harder and harder on that, espe
cially now that we have some
teams healthy enough to practice
together — I think there's really
not much limit to what we can
do."
The Bruins, as was anticipated
going into the season, have a deep
squad, but have not had anyone
emerge as a strong No. 1 player.
Rather, UCLA Coach Glenn Bas
sett has been interchanging Brent
Greenwood. Buff Farrow. Tim
Triguero, Dan Nahirny and Otis
Smith at the top position.
"We seem to be playing a little
better," Bassett said. "All of our
team seems to be kind of turning
it around. We don't have any out
standing players, but we have a lot
of good players. We're just a really
solid team. We're anticipating a
really exciting, tough match."
UCLA will have a score of their
own to settle with the Cardinal. In
last year's NCAA semifinals, the
Bruins, who at that point owned a
29-1 record, home and away wins
over Stanford, and a No. 2
ranking, were routed 5-1 by the
eventual champion Cardinal
squad.
USC, coming off a sixth-place
finish in the nation in 1986, has
been led to its current No. 1
ranking by two of college tennis'
top-10 players, Rick Leach and
Luke Jensen, the ambidextrous
sophomore.
The Trojans won the ITCA Na
tlonal Team Indoor Champion
ships — a sort of NCAA preview —
in February in Louisville, while
Stanford lost all three of its
matches there.
However. Stanford was without
Patrick McEnroe and Mark Jacob
son. who are currently playing No.
2 and No. 3 singles, and No. 1 and
No. 2 doubles, respectively.
When that duo, along with
Geordie McKee who was injured
later, returned, the Cardinal
began its current winning streak,
which has included wins over No.
14 Arizona State and an Arizona
team that has defeated No. 11 Cal
ifornia.
' Also, Stanford's doubles play is
much improved since the ITCA
tournament.
