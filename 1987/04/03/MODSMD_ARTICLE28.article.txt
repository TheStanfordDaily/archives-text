# Stanford plays rare contests at Roble
## 
### ALICIA KENT Staff writer 
The Stanford men's volleyball team will
face two must-win matches this weekend
when the No. 7 Cardinal squad takes on
Long Beach State tonight at 7:30 and Cal
State-Northridge tomorrow at 7:30 p.m.
Both matches will be played at Roble
Gymnasium because of a gymnastics meet
at Maples Pavilion.
Stanford's four-game loss to the 49ers at
Long Beach (on Feb. 20) puts the Cardinal
in the revenge position. "We can beat them,
hopefully cream them, especially if the
crowd is behind us," said Stephen Blue, a
senior.
The advantage of being on home ground
will give the edge to the Cardinal tonight,
according to Stanford Coach Fred Sturm.
"We are much better prepared than last
time. We play well at home," Sturm said.
The Cardinal, with its 6-6 conference
record, is now on the bubble — the No. 5 po
sition in the Western Intercollegiate Volley
ball Association. If it can maintain this
ranking, Stanford will be assured a spot in
the regional playoffs. However, No. 8 Long
Beach and No. 10 Northridge will try to
prevent the Cardinal from keeping its posi
tion. "This is a big weekend for us," Sturm
said. "And Long Beach is a very important
match for us."
Both Long Beach and Stanford are com
ing off of losses to No. 2 Pepperdine. Now
No. 7 in the WIVA, Long Beach has estab
lished a 5-11 conference record. Northridge
is No. 8 in the WIVA with its 3-10 record.
Due to the Cardinal's last match against

the 49ers, in which the Cardinal made 61
hitting errors over the course of the match,
the team has been focusing on reducing
these errors. "The bottom line is we're
playing a lot better now," Sturm said. "Our
blocking has improved a lot and we're
making fewer hitting errors."
In practice this week, Stanford has been
concentrating on its blocking effort. "We've
been working a lot of different block plays to
confuse the other team," middle blocker
Dan Hanan said. In this season's previous
confrontation with Long Beach, the 49ers
were able to set their offense against the
Cardinal defense, stifling the Cardinal's
ability to mix up its blocking plays. "We
hope to keep them guessing. That should
help us win," said Hanan, who is one of the
three starting freshmen.
The lineup for this weekend's double
header will be freshman Parker Blackman
at setter, Blue and freshman Kent Steffes at
outside hitters, Hanan and junior Scott
Fortune middle blocking and senior John
McDermott opposite Blackman. Sturm has
chosen to stick with these starters, al
though much experimenting with the
lineup has occurred throughout the
season. "That group has been doing a lot for
us," Sturm said.
Stanford's intent on beating Long Beach
has preoccupied its strategy planning and
tomorrow's plan against Northridge is less
fixed. Although the Cardinal beat the
Matadors, 3-2,. on March 25, Stanford
hopes to play a better match than in its last
effort. "We can play well if we get sparked.
We're going to take the match seriously be
cause we have to win," Blue said.
