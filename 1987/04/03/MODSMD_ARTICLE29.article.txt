# Cardinal track teams travel to two relays
## 
### ERIK STEN Editorial staff 
With the team's home
debut set for a week from to
morrow, the Stanford track
and field squad will use this
weekend for one final dress
rehearsal.
Planning on giving as
many athletes as possible a
chance to compete, Stanford
Asst. Coach Scott Chisam
will accompany most of the

team to Fresno, where on
Saturday Stanford will com
pete in the Fresno Relays.
Meanwhile, the rest of the
team will be with Stanford
Coach Brooks Johnson in
Austin, Tex., taking part in
yet another relay meet —
this time the Texas Relays,
one of the nation's top track
and field events.
In Fresno, the emphasis
will be on tuning up the ath
letes for next week's home

meet. In Texas, the same will
be true, but the stakes will
be just a little bit higher, as
the Cardinal will be only one
of 54 collegiate teams In
volved in the prestigious
event.
The Cardinal's best
chance of emerging from the
crowd of athletes In Texas
will most likely come in the
distance medley. Last year in
Austin, Stanford won the

event, and for this year's
foursome of Christian
Skoog, Gus Envela, Steve
Schadler and Marc Oleson,
the goal is the same.
In last weekend's Stanford
Holiday Inn Invitational, the
medley placed second. This
weekend with Schadler, a
new addition to the group,
running the 1,320 leg, the
relay will be stronger and
certainly a threat to win.
The rest of the Cardinal

contingent will be primarily
field events. Freshmen Brian
Boggess and Andy Papath
anasslou and sophomore
Patty Purpur will compete in
the shotput. John Gash will
be In the pole vault, Henry
Green the long jump and
Glenn Schneider the discus.
Stanford's only individual
runner in Texas will be dis
tance runner Charles Alex
ander, who will most likely
run the 5,000 meters.
