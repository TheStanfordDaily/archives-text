# Rush meeting attracts crowd
## 
### MARCUS MABRY Senior staff writer 
A capacity crowd last night attended a pre-Rush
orientation meeting â€” the first event of the frater
nity Rush that begins in earnest Monday.
The meeting, held in Kresge Auditorium, was
the first of several changes, initiated by the Inter
fraternity Council (IFC) and approved by represen
tatives of all fraternities, that will mark this year's
Rush.
IFC President Steve Singleton called the
meeting successful, stating "we had a productive
turnout."
The main purpose of the orientation meeting
was to get information about fraternities and the
Rush process to those interested in rushing,
something not accomplished well in recent years,
according to Singleton.
Attendents at last night's orientation received

Rush cards, which will demonstrate that they
have registered their names and their dorms with
the IFC, and that will enable them to attend Rush
events. No one will be admitted to an event with
out a card.
Prospective rushees also received "A Rushee's
Guide to Stanford Fraternal Organizations," de
scribing this year's schedule of Rush events and
outlining fraternities and terms important to
them, as well as information furnished by the IFC
concerning each house's officers, financial stand
ing and policies.
From surveys filled out by current fraternity
members during fall quarter, the IFC learned that
the majority of rushees were not reading the Rush
Book, the only Rush information source that has
been distributed in previous years. Singleton
said.

Steve Singleton, Interfraternity Council president, describes new IFC Rush guidelines to a full
house of prospective rushees in Kresge Auditorium last night
He emphasized during the
meeting that Rush should be a
thoughtful, as well as a fun and
exciting experience, saying that
"drinking is by far not the most
important thing that occurs
during Rush. There's a lot more to
being in a fraternity than party
ing."
Singleton said that the real suc
cess or failure of the new Rush
policies will not be known until
Rush is under way.
"It's going to be an interesting
quarter. I'm not sure what the
results will be," Singleton ad
mitted.
