## 
### ROBERT PORTNOY Staff writer 
The No. 9 Stanford women's golf team puts its
ranking on the line In this weekend's California In
tercollegiate after a posting a fifth place finish in the
grueling Lady Mustang over spring break.
Stanford will host the first day of the competition
at the Stanford Golf Course on Sunday, and then
travel to San Jose to the Villages Golf Course for the
final 36 holes on Monday.
The Cardinal did something it had never done
before in this year's Lady Mustang; it defeated
Florida and Miami of Florida in the same tourna
ment. Florida's sixth-place finish and Miami's
eighth-place finish dropped them down in the na
tional rankings and made room for two of Stanford's
local foes. USC and San Jose State, to move into the
top five. USC. after its victory in the Lady Mustang, is
now the top team in the country. The Spartans,
losers in the Lady Mustang by one shot, are playing
like they're the No. 2 team, according to Stanford
Coach Tim Baldwin.
"We've got every golf-playing college In the state of
California here for the intercollegiate, except UCLA,
because they have their annual fund-raiser this
weekend. USC and SJSU are the top two teams In
country for my money right now, and Laurette
Maritz of U.S. International University is the top
player in the country. She'll be a first-team Ail-
American for the fourth year in a row, and it looks
like (Stanford senior) Kathleen McCarthy will also be
a first team Ail-American," Baldwin said.
McCarthy may not be available for Sunday's round.
The top five collegiate players In the U.S. were invited
to play in this week's major LPGA championship In
Palm Springs, the Dinah Shore Classic. If she, as
Baldwin expects, makes the Friday cut, she'll be in
the so-called "golf capital of the world" through Sun
day.
The other four Stanford women participating will
be senior Adrienne Gilmartin, juniors Trish
McGonigle and Kay Cornelius, and sophomore Clare
Dolan. If Baldwin is right, the four are ready to pick
up the slack.
"This is the hardest working group of girls we've
had here at Stanford. USC and San Jose are tough
teams and we would have to play at our very best to
beat them. Without Kathleen Sunday, it will be
tough, but the other four are very confident of
playing excellent golf," Baldwin said.
First-round play at the Stanford Golf Course Sun
day commences at 9 a.m.
