## 
### ROBERT PORTNOY Staff writer 
Today and tomorrow will pro
vide the Stanford men's golf team
its best opportunity to turn
around what at this stage has
been a less than scintillating
season.
Coming off a 16th place finish
at the Nor Cal Pepsi Intercollegiate
in Stockton on March 23 and 24,
the Cardinal hosts the Stanford
U.S. Intercollegiate today and to
morrow at the Stanford Golf
Course.
Stanford has two teams entered
in the tournament, and 14 players
in the Individual competition. The
first team will consist of sopho
mores John Mahon and Roger
Miraglia, and freshmen Steve

White, Mark Funseth, Brad
Benbrook and Brad Joondeph.
Benbrook and Joondeph are par
ticipating in the first collegiate
tournaments of their careers. The
second team Is comprised of
junior Rich Marek. sophomores
Brad Geer and Jeff Gilbert, and
freshmen Don Christensen, Mike
Hubly and Josh Zander. Also par
ticipating are sophomore Casey
Pittock and freshman Mike Van
Alstyne.
Only the first team is eligible to
win the team title, but all the
Stanford players participating will
be competing for the individual
crown.
"We've only finished in the top
half of the field once, and we'd like
to do that again. Finishing In the
top third would be a good perfor

mance, and it's something within
reach on our home course. It's our
best chance left to keep alive the
streak of winning at least one
tournament the last four years.
We've won a total of nine in those
four years," Stanford Coach Tim
Schaaf said.
Steve White is the hottest Card
inal of late, posting the low indi
vidual score on the team in the
last two tournaments, the Florida
Southern/Imperial Lakes Classic
and the Nor Cal. In the Nor Cal,
White shot 229 to finish 12
strokes out of the lead and tied for
25th. John Mahon, also playing
well, was just a stroke behind him
at 230. Roger Miraglia carded the
low round of the event for Stan
ford with a 73 in a downpour on
the second day.

Pacific 10 Conference partici
pants in the tournament will in
clude Arizona State. USC, UCLA,
California, Oregon State and
Washington. The Sun Devils sport
the top collegian In the country,
Bill Mayfair.
Despite the team's struggles
this year, Schaaf has reason to
believe that the Cardinal can take
a step in the right direction in its
own backyard this weekend.
"We played poorly the first day at
the Nor Cal, and then in a
downpour the second day. we
were the fourth low score the first
18, and the second 18 we shot 74,
78, 79 and two 84s, one of which
we had to count. If one of those
had been a decent score, we
could've been fourth for the 36
holes," Schaaf said.
