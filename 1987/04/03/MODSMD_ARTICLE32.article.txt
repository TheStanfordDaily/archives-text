### EVAN TUCHINSKY Staff writer 
Cresclt eundo — "It grows as
it goes," — is not only the state
motto of New Mexico, but will
also be the hallmark of the Stan
ford women's gymnastics team
as the Cardinal travels into the
Land of Enchantment this
weekend to face Albuquerque-
New Mexico and seventh-ranked
Nebraska in the Cardinal's last
regular season meet. The Card
inal hopes that its success will
continue to grow as the national
championships approach.
Stanford is ranked 20th in the
nation and seeded fourth in the
upcoming West regionals. The

squad is counting on a good per
formance this weekend to move
up in the rankings and increase
its chances of receiving a berth
at the NCAA tournament.
"Our whole purpose here is to
solidify our position, improve
our chances of qualifying for na
tionals." Stanford Coach Homer
Sardina said. "We're one of prob
ably 12 teams bidding for seven
at-large spots for the NCAA
finals."
The bottom line for the Card
inal is consistent performances.
"We're going to try to hit 24 of 24
routines," Sardina said. "That's
our goal. I think the girls are in
pretty good shape to do this."
Competing in the all-around

for Stanford at the meet will be
co-captains Cheryl Doo and
Alison McGann, senior Nanci
Goldsmith and freshman Dina
Amoroso. Sophomore Jinny
Rhee, who has gone all-around
most of the season, will compete
only on the uneven bars due to a
stress fracture.
"We're going with four all
arounders and two specialists
on each event," Sardina said.
Among these specialists are
senior Cindy Boyd, who will per
form on floor exercise and vault
as well as on her Jorte, the bal
ance beam, and sophomore
Sheri Evenson, who returns
after a knee injury for her
meet in as many months
