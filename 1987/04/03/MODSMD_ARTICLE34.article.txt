# 'Women and Men' conference begins

### GEOFF SANBORN Senior staff writer 
"Women and Men: Voices for
Change." a three-day conference
sponsored by the Rape Education
Project (REP), kicks off tomorrow
with a noon concert in White Plaza
and a keynote address at 7:30
p.m. In Kresge Auditorium.
The evening address features
personal statements on issues of
gender conflict from Susan Grif
fin, author of "Pornography and
Silence," Shepherd Bliss, an ac
tivist in the new Men's Movement,
and Diane Middlebrook, who
heads Stanford's program in
feminist studies.
Other highlights of the week
end's events are a performance of
"This is the House." a two-woman
play on domestic violence sched
uled for Saturday at 8 p.m. in the
Sterling Quad Performance Cen
ter. and a seminar Sunday after
noon on the difficulties of

friendships between men and
women, led by author Lillian
Rubin.
The issues that the conference
will address — violence, media
sexism, the need for cooperation
between men and women — "grew
out of the discussions we had in
dorms last spring." according to
REP coordinator Judith David.
In the discussions following
viewings of the film "Rethinking
Rape." which the REP produced
and circulated around campus
last year, "common themes kept
coming up." David said. "We
decided it would be useful to put
together a conference that dealt
with these issues."
"The whole conference is very
interactive," Davis said. "We have
authors, performers and singers
. . . sharing how in their personal
life they've come to grips with
gender Issues. The basic empha
sis of the conference is on discus
sion."
