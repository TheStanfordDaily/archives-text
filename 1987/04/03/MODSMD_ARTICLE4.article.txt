# Fac Sen asks for new library plan
## 
### JOHN POLLACK Senior staff writer 
Opposition to the Reagan Li
brary's current design and pro
posed location coalesced in the
Faculty Senate yesterday as the
senate adopted a resolution ur
ging the University's Board of
Trustees to "solicit and carefully
examine an alternate architec
tural plan" for the presidential ar
chive.
The resolution calls for "a signif
icantly smaller and less visible
structure whose primary function
would be scholarly research and
seminar instruction," and urges
the board to relocate the library if
the present design is retained.
The adoption of the resolution
followed several hours of debate
concerning the decision-making
processes that produced the li
brary plans, as well as the compat
ibility of the library's current
design with its proposed site in
the foothills above Junipero Serra
Boulevard.
Warren Christopher, the chair
man of the board, addressed the
senate before the resolution was
adopted. "I think there will be
little likelihood that the trustees
will want to reconsider the com
mitments taken since 1983 and
1985. The commitments were
taken really publicly and openly to
the press and the president of the
United States," Christopher said.
"On the question of moving it to
a different site, I think that would
be a very difficult decision for a
great University to take. It would
be a change in commitment made
publicly to the president of ,the
United States," he added.
Christopher's attendance at the
senate meeting was highly unus
ual. According to Kenneth Arrow,

professor of economics and chair
of the senate, Christopher's pres
ence demonstrated the board's in
terest in faculty opinion.
But Christopher's appeal to the
senate did not prevent the passage
of the resolution, which passed by
a vote of 26-4 with five absten
tions. The text of the resolution
was adapted from an open letter to
the senate signed by 12 former
chairs of that body, including Poli
tical Science Prof. David Aber
nethy.
Abernethy, who was the only
faculty member on the Reagan Li
brary Planning Committee, read a
prepared statement about the li
brary's current design and pro
posed site to the senate.
"There is a striking discrepancy
between the justification for
bringing the library to Stanford,
and the planning process to date
that has brought us a specific
building on a specific site. The
justification was academic, and
the process was supposed to be in
clusive." said Abernethy.
Abernethy's statement artic
ulated a common concern ex
pressed by several others in the
senate: That the library, as it is
currently designed — with exten
sive parking, a 150-seat audi
torium and significant exhibit
space — will serve more as a
tourist attraction than an aca
demic resource.
The lack of faculty input on the
library's design and site selection
reinforced this concern, Aber
nethy said. "The faculty were min
imally involved, and the process
was 'owned,' in closely held fash
ion, by the Hoover Institution," he
said.
Abernethy, referring to the
