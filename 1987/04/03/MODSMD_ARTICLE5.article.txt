# Hoover scholar knocks Stanford sex policy

### CHARLIE GOFEN Senior staff writer 
A visiting scholar at the Hoover Institu
tion has denounced the University for its
sex education policies, asserting that admi
nistrators here should encourage students
to practice abstinence rather than "safe
sex."
The scholar, visiting media fellow Tom
Bethell, said he questions "the responsibil
ity, indeed the sanity," of the Stanford Ad
ministration, which has supported activi
ties, such as giving condoms to students,
that he says promote promiscuity among

students. Bethell made his comments in
the April issue of The American Spectator, a
magazine for which he is a Washington cor
respondent.
Bethell said the AIDS threat should be
fought with the most effective weapon
available â€” abstinence. Speaking in an in
terview yesterday, he added that "people in
positions of responsibility should not be
fearful of enunciating Christian morality,
which after all would stop the AIDS
epidemic dead in its track. I haven't heard
administrators here advocating absti
nence."
In his magazine article. Bethell charged

that the media, as well as the University,
has treated AIDS as "a greater threat to the
sexual revolution than to the health of
America.
"In the case of drug addiction, the Media
Message, formerly'controlled use,' has been
toughened up: Say no!' Likewise, millions
of anonymous alcoholics believe that the
freedom of the will is not an outmoded idea.
So do addicted cigarette smokers who try to
quit. Only when it comes to sex is the sug
gested exercise of willpower derogated as an
inappropriate application of moral princi
ple to bodily function."
Stanford administrators, responding to

Bethell's comments, said the University
does tell students that abstinence is the
safest policy, but said Stanford has an obli
gation to inform students of many options
rather than advocate a specific brand of
morality.
"We have a responsibility to educate
people on these issues . . . and not to estab
lish a norm of sexual activity," said Alice
Supton, assistant dean of Residential Edu
cation. "We respect people's upbringing and
mora! values and honor personal decision
making."
