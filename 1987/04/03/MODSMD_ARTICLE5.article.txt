# Hoover scholar knocks Stanford sex policy
## 
### CHARLIE GOFEN Senior staff writer 
A visiting scholar at the Hoover Institu
tion has denounced the University for its
sex education policies, asserting that admi
nistrators here should encourage students
to practice abstinence rather than "safe
sex."
The scholar, visiting media fellow Tom
Bethell, said he questions "the responsibil
ity, indeed the sanity," of the Stanford Ad
ministration, which has supported activi
ties, such as giving condoms to students,
that he says promote promiscuity among

students. Bethell made his comments in
the April issue of The American Spectator, a
magazine for which he is a Washington cor
respondent.
Bethell said the AIDS threat should be
fought with the most effective weapon
available â€” abstinence. Speaking in an in
terview yesterday, he added that "people in
positions of responsibility should not be
fearful of enunciating Christian morality,
which after all would stop the AIDS
epidemic dead in its track. I haven't heard
administrators here advocating absti
nence."
In his magazine article. Bethell charged

that the media, as well as the University,
has treated AIDS as "a greater threat to the
sexual revolution than to the health of
America.
"In the case of drug addiction, the Media
Message, formerly'controlled use,' has been
toughened up: Say no!' Likewise, millions
of anonymous alcoholics believe that the
freedom of the will is not an outmoded idea.
So do addicted cigarette smokers who try to
quit. Only when it comes to sex is the sug
gested exercise of willpower derogated as an
inappropriate application of moral princi
ple to bodily function."
Stanford administrators, responding to

Bethell's comments, said the University
does tell students that abstinence is the
safest policy, but said Stanford has an obli
gation to inform students of many options
rather than advocate a specific brand of
morality.
"We have a responsibility to educate
people on these issues . . . and not to estab
lish a norm of sexual activity," said Alice
Supton, assistant dean of Residential Edu
cation. "We respect people's upbringing and
mora! values and honor personal decision
making."
"We want to give as much edu
cation as possible, to treat stu
dents like adults . . . and high
light a range of choices." said
Doryn Davis-Chervin, director of
the University's Health Promotion
Program.
Bethell noted in his article that
members of the Stanford AIDS
Education Project enclosed a tel
ling brochure with the condoms
they distributed. "We want to help
you develop an erotic sex life that
at the same time displays respon
sible, safe and healthy behavior

between you and your partners."
Bethell quoted from the brochure,
drawing attention to the plural
"partners."
Stanford administrators argue
that giving condoms to students
does not encourage sexual activity
but rather serves to promote
safety for students who are
already Inclined to have sex. Ac
cording to Supton, the distribu
tion of condoms is just another
way to educate.
"To have students know what a
condom is, take it out of a pack
age, see how it works ... is a part
of education in this day and age,"
Supton said.
Acting Dean of the Chapel
Thomas Ambrogi said he supports

the University's efforts to educate
students on issues of sex and
sexuality, asserting that sex edu
cation does not promote promis
cuity or take moral decisions out
of the individual's hands. "The
Administration is encouraging
people to make ethical decisions,"
he said. "I don't see it as the role of
the University to determine the
moral content of those decisions."
Meg Richman, a senior and a
member of the AIDS Education
Project, said her organization
"understands that abstinence is
100 percent effective in prevent
ing the spread of the disease . . .
but just accepts as a ground rule
that abstinence is not an option,
at least not for 99 percent of the

people here."
Bethell emphasized in his arti
cle that abstinence should always
be an option. He accused gays of
being especially prdmiscuous and
charged that they are especially
vulnerable to sexual "addiction"
because they practice "unnatural
forms of sex."
"They have yielded to tempta
tion so many times that the fires
of lust burn within them, making
it indeed difficult for them to con
trol themselves." Bethell wrote.
Daniel Bao, spokesman for the
Gay and Lesbian Alliance at Stan
ford, countered that gay sex is not
unnatural and that heterosexuals
are as likely as homosexuals to
become sexual "addicts."
