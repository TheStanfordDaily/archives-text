Religion and capitalism have played crucial roles
in the success of the American experiment, accord
ing to author Michael Novak, who spoke last night in
Annenberg Auditorium on "The War of Ideas: Reli
gion and Economics."
After "losing faith" in socialism, Novak, who was
assistant professor of humanities at Stanford from
1965 to '68, "fell upon the American idea of libera
tion," which includes liberation from torture and
tyranny, from poverty and from oppression.
Although "it's the role of anyone well-educated in
the humanities to be at the very least anti-capitalist,"
Novak said, he "found it impossible to find a socialist
country on the map that I admired."
In questioning what the American experiment
was. Novak, who has written over 20 books and has
had columns printed in various national publica
tions. decided that he "knew little about the Ameri
can experiment. It's odd that in a system founded on
ideas, we don't know what the ideas are."
Novak realized that "the real revolutionary idea In
the world is the 'American idea,' the new order of the
ages, the new international economic order, that has
lifted up the poor."
In describing this order, or new science. Novak
asserted that through the American system of enter
prise and Industry people could finally expect
prosperity and the preservation of liberty. "In 1987.
the condition of poverty is no longer looked upon as
natural or inevitable," he said. "To say one's nation
is poor is an injustice."
If the public and the government are to succeed.


Michael Novak, author and former Stanford professor, praised the
American belief in economic growth last night in Annenberg
Auditorium.
the founding founders realized,
envy must be eliminated. "It (envy)
was the destruction of the
republics. Economic growth
defeats envy ... (it is) the most in
sidious of the passions."
Novak attributed the long
lasting success of the U.S. Consti
tution to three themes. The first is
its originality in defending the
"dignity of the human person;"
the second is its emphasis on
commerce and the cause of the
wealth of nations.
"The very humble principle be
hind patents and copyrights is the

American belief that human
beings are made in the image of
God." Novak said. "They were
made to be creators and to con
ceive of ideas as material and spir
itual property."
Novak listed the third theme as
the constitutional right of
"securing religious liberty." He
described the constitution's
"theology of liberation." whereby
America, conceived as a "scientific
experiment, extended the domain
of liberty on earth. The new sci
ence republic was to change
forever the way humans think
about liberty."
In assessing the future Ameri
can condition, Novak said he is
"pessimistic in some ways. We are
too affluent and prosperous and

therefore believe in an easy life.
Soldiers don't calculate by cost
overruns. They fight until the
death. We live in a world which
demands a martial readiness, and
I'm not so sure we're up to it."
Novak, who received a master's
degree from Harvard in 1965 in
the history and philosophy of reli
gion. currently holds the George
Frederick Jewett Chair in Religion
and Public Policy at the American
Enterprise Institute in Washing
ton D.C. In 1985. he was ap
pointed to the Presidential Task
Force on Project Economic
Justice, and in 1981 and 1982 he
served as the head of the U.S.
delegation to the United Nations
Human Rights Commission in
Geneva.
