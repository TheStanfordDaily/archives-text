Religion and capitalism have played crucial roles
in the success of the American experiment, accord
ing to author Michael Novak, who spoke last night in
Annenberg Auditorium on "The War of Ideas: Reli
gion and Economics."
After "losing faith" in socialism, Novak, who was
assistant professor of humanities at Stanford from
1965 to '68, "fell upon the American idea of libera
tion," which includes liberation from torture and
tyranny, from poverty and from oppression.
Although "it's the role of anyone well-educated in
the humanities to be at the very least anti-capitalist,"
Novak said, he "found it impossible to find a socialist
country on the map that I admired."
In questioning what the American experiment
was. Novak, who has written over 20 books and has
had columns printed in various national publica
tions. decided that he "knew little about the Ameri
can experiment. It's odd that in a system founded on
ideas, we don't know what the ideas are."
Novak realized that "the real revolutionary idea In
the world is the 'American idea,' the new order of the
ages, the new international economic order, that has
lifted up the poor."
In describing this order, or new science. Novak
asserted that through the American system of enter
prise and Industry people could finally expect
prosperity and the preservation of liberty. "In 1987.
the condition of poverty is no longer looked upon as
natural or inevitable," he said. "To say one's nation
is poor is an injustice."
If the public and the government are to succeed.


Michael Novak, author and former Stanford professor, praised the
American belief in economic growth last night in Annenberg
Auditorium.
