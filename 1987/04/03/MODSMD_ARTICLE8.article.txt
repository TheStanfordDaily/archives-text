Official: No trade war upcoming
WASHINGTON — Hoping to defuse economic tensions with
Japan, U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter said yesterday
(hat Japan is a "great and respected friend" of the United States,
despite the dispute over semiconductors, and insisted that the
two nations are not heading toward a trade war.
Yeutter sought to reassure skeptical members of the Senate
Finance Committee, who want tougher steps to force Japan to buy
more American-made goods, that the Reagan administration is
aggressively defending U.S. workers and businesses against un
fair imports.
One member. Sen. Donald Riegle, D-Mich., asked. "Are we
supposed to let plant after plant close, job after job go overseas?"
Another member, Sen. John Heinz, R-Pa., said in unusually
blunt language. "The Japanese have been getting away with mur
der for years, and now that our country is littered with the bodies
of dead and dying industries, the administration is saying it may
impose capital punishment in the future."
But Yeutter insisted that last week's decision to impose 100 per
cent tariffs on many Japanese products — such as computer com
ponents and color television sets — will send "a signal to our
Japanese friends." The heavy penalties will be imposed April 17 in
retaliation for Japanese firms' "dumping" of semiconductors —
the tiny silicon chips used in computers and many electronic
products — at unfairly low prices.
"I don't know how we can be a whole lot more aggressive than we
have been," Yeutter said of the action, the first U.S. trade sanc
tions against Japan in the post-World War II era.
Mulroney: Reagan preoccupied
OTTAWA — Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney says that
he and other world leaders were very concerned that crucial Amer
ican foreign policy decisions were being overlooked earlier this
year because of President Reagan's preoccupation with the Iran
arms scandal and his health.
"The focus of his administration . . . was on his own domestic
obligations," Mulroney said, referring specifically to the presi
dent's hospitalization in January for prostate surgery and the
crisis over the shipment of arms to Iran. "But life continued for
the rest of us."
The prime minister made his remarks during a two-hour inter
view he gave this week to some American reporters based here as
Canadian officials prepared for the annual Reagan-Mulroney
meeting to be held Sunday and Monday in Ottawa.
As an example of the concern he cited over Reagan's situation,
Mulroney spoke of a meeting he had in Rome with Italian Prime
Minister Bettino Craxi in January: "Craxi and other Italian
leaders, like other prime ministers around the world, were saying
to themselves, 'When are these problems that are important to me
going to get some attention?' "
"They too were preoccupied with relations with the U.S. and
what was going to happen."
Mulroney said his own particular worries dealt with crucial
bilateral issues, particularly efforts to negotiate a free trade agree
ment and obtain greater American cooperation in reducing acid
rain, a form of air pollution that reportedly is endangering large
numbers of Canadian lakes and waterways.
Pope supports free elections
SANTIAGO, Chile — Pope John Paul II instructed bishops yes
terday to support moves toward free elections in Chile, following
private meetings with Gen. Augusto Pinochet and a violence
marred rally marked by impassioned appeals from poor Chileans
for freedom and justice.
In a speech to Chile's conference of 31 Roman Catholic bishops
on his second day in this politically polarized country, the pontiff
affirmed the rights of people everywhere to take part in political
life and elect their leaders. He acknowledged as heartening recent
moves in this direction by Chile's authoritarian government, in
cluding the legalization of some political parties and the opening
of electoral registers.
But he added, "The good of the country requires that these
measures be consolidated, perfected and complemented in such a
way that they become valid instruments in favor of social peace in
a Christian country in which all must recognize themselves as
children of God and brothers of Christ."
The day was filled with jarring juxtapositions of John Paul
traveling between Chile's opposing political forces. He went from a
balcony appearance and chapel prayer with President Pinochet to
a stage in a shanty town to address several hundred thousand of
the city's poor, many of whom fiercely oppose the Chilean leader.
Population growth threatens China
BEIJING — China's population growth is in danger of running
out of control if immediate action is not taken to curb recent
"sharp increases" in births, a Chinese official warned yesterday.
In a front-page article, the English-language China Daily news
paper quoted Zheng Jiaheng, director of the state statistical
bureau, as saying that in rural areas, a growing number of
couples are violating China's "one couple, one child" policy.
In some rural areas. Communist Party cadres and village leaders
are ignoring the birth control policy and having "extra-budget"
babies of their own. China Legal News reported earlier this week.
The newspaper also quoted peasants as saying, "As long as we
don't get punished by being shot, we're going to have more
babies."
Some peasants, the newspaper said, have established close per
sonal relations with village leaders who allow them to go on having
more children. Other peasants have become so wealthy that they
can afford to pay the fines imposed for violations of the one-child
policy, the newspaper said.
Zheng told deputies attending the current session of the Na
tional People's Congress. China's legislature, that the violations
were mainly a result of a relaxation of the country's strict birth
control measures in recent years.
U.S. soldier defects to the East
MOSCOW — An American soldier who was stationed in West
Germany has defected to the Soviet Union, a Foreign Ministry
spokesman said yesterday.
The soldier, identified only as William Roberts and his West Ger
man wife, feared persecution for their political views, spokesman
Gennady Gerastmov said, adding that Roberts "already had been
persecuted in the U.S. Army."
Gerastmov provided no rank or Army unit for Roberts, nor did
he say when Roberts and his wife, identified only as P. Neumann,
arrived in the Soviet Union. He did say that the couple have left for
a honeymoon in the Soviet republic of Turkmenia.
A spokesman for the U.S. Embassy said he had no information
about the case except what was provided by the Soviet Foreign
Ministry. He contended, however, that the term "political asylum"
was a misnomer since U.S. citizens are free to travel to almost any
country that will accept them.
In Washington, the U.S. Army announced that it had declared a
deserter one of its soldiers assigned to West Germany. Pvt. 2/c
Wade Evan Roberts. The Army noted that Roberts' first name dif
fered from that released by Moscow.

Official: No trade war upcoming
WASHINGTON — Hoping to defuse economic tensions with
Japan, U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter said yesterday
(hat Japan is a "great and respected friend" of the United States,
despite the dispute over semiconductors, and insisted that the
two nations are not heading toward a trade war.
Yeutter sought to reassure skeptical members of the Senate
Finance Committee, who want tougher steps to force Japan to buy
more American-made goods, that the Reagan administration is
aggressively defending U.S. workers and businesses against un
fair imports.
One member. Sen. Donald Riegle, D-Mich., asked. "Are we
supposed to let plant after plant close, job after job go overseas?"
Another member, Sen. John Heinz, R-Pa., said in unusually
blunt language. "The Japanese have been getting away with mur
der for years, and now that our country is littered with the bodies
of dead and dying industries, the administration is saying it may
impose capital punishment in the future."
But Yeutter insisted that last week's decision to impose 100 per
cent tariffs on many Japanese products — such as computer com
ponents and color television sets — will send "a signal to our
Japanese friends." The heavy penalties will be imposed April 17 in
retaliation for Japanese firms' "dumping" of semiconductors —
the tiny silicon chips used in computers and many electronic
products — at unfairly low prices.
"I don't know how we can be a whole lot more aggressive than we
have been," Yeutter said of the action, the first U.S. trade sanc
tions against Japan in the post-World War II era.
Mulroney: Reagan preoccupied
OTTAWA — Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney says that
he and other world leaders were very concerned that crucial Amer
ican foreign policy decisions were being overlooked earlier this
year because of President Reagan's preoccupation with the Iran
arms scandal and his health.
"The focus of his administration . . . was on his own domestic
obligations," Mulroney said, referring specifically to the presi
dent's hospitalization in January for prostate surgery and the
crisis over the shipment of arms to Iran. "But life continued for
the rest of us."
The prime minister made his remarks during a two-hour inter
view he gave this week to some American reporters based here as
Canadian officials prepared for the annual Reagan-Mulroney
meeting to be held Sunday and Monday in Ottawa.
As an example of the concern he cited over Reagan's situation,
Mulroney spoke of a meeting he had in Rome with Italian Prime
Minister Bettino Craxi in January: "Craxi and other Italian
leaders, like other prime ministers around the world, were saying
to themselves, 'When are these problems that are important to me
going to get some attention?' "
"They too were preoccupied with relations with the U.S. and
what was going to happen."
Mulroney said his own particular worries dealt with crucial
bilateral issues, particularly efforts to negotiate a free trade agree
ment and obtain greater American cooperation in reducing acid
rain, a form of air pollution that reportedly is endangering large
numbers of Canadian lakes and waterways.
Pope supports free elections
SANTIAGO, Chile — Pope John Paul II instructed bishops yes
terday to support moves toward free elections in Chile, following
private meetings with Gen. Augusto Pinochet and a violence
marred rally marked by impassioned appeals from poor Chileans
for freedom and justice.
In a speech to Chile's conference of 31 Roman Catholic bishops
on his second day in this politically polarized country, the pontiff
affirmed the rights of people everywhere to take part in political
life and elect their leaders. He acknowledged as heartening recent
moves in this direction by Chile's authoritarian government, in
cluding the legalization of some political parties and the opening
of electoral registers.
But he added, "The good of the country requires that these
measures be consolidated, perfected and complemented in such a
way that they become valid instruments in favor of social peace in
a Christian country in which all must recognize themselves as
children of God and brothers of Christ."
The day was filled with jarring juxtapositions of John Paul
traveling between Chile's opposing political forces. He went from a
balcony appearance and chapel prayer with President Pinochet to
a stage in a shanty town to address several hundred thousand of
the city's poor, many of whom fiercely oppose the Chilean leader.
Population growth threatens China
BEIJING — China's population growth is in danger of running
out of control if immediate action is not taken to curb recent
"sharp increases" in births, a Chinese official warned yesterday.
In a front-page article, the English-language China Daily news
paper quoted Zheng Jiaheng, director of the state statistical
bureau, as saying that in rural areas, a growing number of
couples are violating China's "one couple, one child" policy.
In some rural areas. Communist Party cadres and village leaders
are ignoring the birth control policy and having "extra-budget"
babies of their own. China Legal News reported earlier this week.
The newspaper also quoted peasants as saying, "As long as we
don't get punished by being shot, we're going to have more
babies."
Some peasants, the newspaper said, have established close per
sonal relations with village leaders who allow them to go on having
more children. Other peasants have become so wealthy that they
can afford to pay the fines imposed for violations of the one-child
policy, the newspaper said.
Zheng told deputies attending the current session of the Na
tional People's Congress. China's legislature, that the violations
were mainly a result of a relaxation of the country's strict birth
control measures in recent years.
