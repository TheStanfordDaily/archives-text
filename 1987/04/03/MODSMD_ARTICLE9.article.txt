# Senate overturns Reagan veto
## 
### 
WASHINGTON — The Senate yesterday
overrode President Reagan's veto of a >87.5 bil
lion highway and mass transit bill after 13
rebellious Republicans spurned an extraordi
nary personal plea from Reagan who had made
the Issue a major test of leadership and politi
cal revival.
The Senate's 67 to 33 vote to override the
veto — just enough to reverse its vote Wednes
day to sustain the president's position — came
after Reagan unexpectedly drove to Capitol Hill
to lobby personally against the measure that
he had decried as a pork-filled budget-buster.
"I beg you to vote with me on this," Reagan
was quoted by Sen. Thad Cochran, R-Miss., as
telling him and the other 12 Republicans in a
private meeting just off the Senate floor. The
13 had voted Wednesday to override the veto
and stood firm against a formidable White
House lobbying operation that preceeded
Reagan's visit to the Hill.
Shortly after Reagan finished his nearly 90
minutes of meetings with the Republicans,
word began to spread that none had budged,
refusing to move either individually or col
lectively. As the rollcall began, a solemn hush
fell over the Senate chamber and its packed
visitors' galleries.
"We fought the good fight," said Senate
Minority Leader Robert Dole, R-Kan., in a vir
tual concession of defeat as he and Majority
Leader Robert C. Byrd, D-W.Va., exchanged

restrained, even gracious commentaries on
the tense drama of the preceding 24 hours.
Then, one by one. the 13 GOP rebels — nearly
one-third of the 46-member Republican
minority — cast their votes to override the
president's veto, denying him the one vote he
needed to win.
It had come to one vote because Reagan had
prevailed Wednesday by one vote, and Sen.
Terry Sanford, D-N.C., his lone supporter
among the Democrats, had decided to switch
sides and abandon Reagan.
With the Senate finally producing precisely
the two-thirds vote necessary to override, it
joined the House In putting the law into effect
without the president's signature. The House
voted 350 to 73 to override on Tuesday.
Congress two months ago overode Reagan's
veto of a clean-water act reauthorization, the
only other major legislation approved by the
100 th Congress since it convened under full
Democratic control.
In addition to authorizing continuation of
federal highway and transit aid for the next
five years, including more than 150 special
road projects for states and districts of influen
tial lawmakers, the bill allows states to raise
the speed limit from 55 to 65 mph on rural
stretches of interstate highways.
The combination of speed-limit increases for
rural lawmakers, mass transit money for ur
banites and road money for nearly everyone

made the legislation extremely popular — a
high-risk target for the White House to use in a
test of wills with Congress as Reagan struggled
to come back from damage suffered in the
Iran-contra affair.
But Reagan, who Republicans described as
truly offended by what he regarded as spend
ing excesses in the measure, chose to stake his
prestige on the issue, and some Democrats
said Thursday that he will get credit for trying
in a manner that belied the image of a disen
gaged. distracted lame-duck president.
Using a sports metaphor. Sen. Edward Ken
nedy, D-Mass., said. "On this day, on this
issue and in this battle, President Reagan
played the game very well indeed, as the leader
he is and can be. If no more shoes drop on
Irangate, he is clearly out of the woods and all
of us recognize that and welcome that."
The struggle gave Reagan an opportunity to
demonstrate "aggressive . . . hands-on" man
agement of government, said Sen. George
Mitchell. D-Maine. "He tried and he failed.
There's no disgrace in that."
Dole described the effort as "money in the
bank" for Reagan, saying he would get "credit
with the American people for standing tough"
along with credit among Republicans in up
coming legislative battles, starting with action
on the fiscal 1988 budget next week.
