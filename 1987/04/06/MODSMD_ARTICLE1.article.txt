# Swimmers win 3rd NCAA title

### ERIK ESELIUS Senior staff writer 
AUSTIN, Tex. — High atop the
Texas Swim Center's 10-meter
platform, a place where Sherpas,
migrating geese and gallant
oxygen molecules exchange busi
ness cards, Stanford Coach Skip
Kenney and Asst. Coach Ted
Knapp briefly surveyed the crowd
before making their noble, post
victory plunge.
Adrenaline, no doubt, has its
coercive influence.
In an emotionally charged final
third day, the Stanford men's
swimming team padded its sizable
second-day lead and won its third
consecutive NCAA championship
Saturday.
Trailing only after the first
night, the Cardinal had a busy
second and third evening at the
awards podium. All told, Stanford
finished with 374, while second
place USC had 296 points.
Third-place Florida had 293
points, followed by California
(269), Texas (257), Michigan
(174), UCLA (146) and Louisiana
State (145).
Kenney, selected as Swimming
Coach of the Year for the third

consecutive season, was clearly
enthused.
"The feeling of winning a na
tional championship is so fantas
tic, I can't even describe it," said
Kenney, who spent some time
poking at a shriveled contact lens
after he was ceremonially thrown
into the pool. "We knew coming in
that if we swam well, we'd win.
And we did. It's a great thrill.
"I think this Is one of the
greatest teams In NCAA history.
Nobody can say we were lucky to
win. We have great athletes on
this team."
And unquestionably, Stanford
has the finest NCAA swimmer ever
— Pablo Morales, who topped off
his incredible Cardinal career
with 11 NCAA individual titles out
of a possible 12, breaking the old
mark of 10 set by USC's John
Naber.
Entering the championship,
Morales heard continual whispers
of his realistic chance of establish
ing the all-time individual mark.
After he won the 200-yard individ
ual medley and the 100 butterfly,
the latter only .11 second off his
American record set last year, the

outscoring its nearest competitors by 78 points.
whispers grew to Van Halen-esque
proportions.
"I tried to Ignore it." Morales
said, referring to the media hype.
"I just wanted to go out ag
gressively; the only thing I had on
my mind was race strategy."
The race was the 200 butterfly,
his chief competitor Anthony
Mosse. a Stanford teammate.
Mosse, a 1984 Olympian, said
that he felt like he was "caught be
tween a rock and a hard place"
when thinking about prospects of
winning the race and denying
Morales the record mark.
Ultimately, Mosse saw the
pressure-packed ocassion as "an
incentive to take up the challenge,
to go after it."
Taking full advantage of his 100-
butterfly speed. Morales surged to
a relatively quick full body length
lead, an advantage he held en
route to a new American record
time of 1:42.60 and a cornerstone
in NCAA swimming history.
"You can't beat this, being able
to swim well personally and
having the team win," Morales
said."lt's a privilege to be men
tioned in the same breath as John
Naber. I feel very fortunate."
After the record-shattering per
formance, the Stanford team
gathered at the end of the lane and
delievered the traditional "Leland
Stanford" anthem to congratulate
its senior tri-captaln.
Mosse, visably disappointed by
his swim, was characteristically
diplomatic and talked of his
friendship with Morales.
"He's the reason why I came to
Stanford," Mosse said. "I wanted
to work out with the best. Pablo
adds so much to the team besides
points. His leadership and inspi
ration will be missed."
Morales did not win Swimmer of
the Year — edged out by Cal's Matt
Biondi, who set three American
records in the 50. 100 and 200
freestyle.
Stanford also got a superlative
showing from another one of its
Olympians, tri-captain Jeff Kos
toff. Coming off a sixth-place
finish in the 500 freestyle, an

event that has handcuffed him for
four years at the NCAAs, Kostoff
approached his final two races,
the 400 IM and the 1650 freestyle,
with added vigor.
The results certainly came —
blue ribbons in both. "Actually, I
wanted to win three titles," Kos
toff admitted afterwards. "I
haven't quite got enough speed for
the 500. Each year I think, This is
the year to put it all together.' "
To see Kostoff and Morales
finish their Stanford careers in
championship fashion was a truly
a cherished moment for Kenney.
"They are our leaders. Pablo and
K.B. (Kostoffs nickname) swam
so well. To go out on top with
these two is very special." Kenney
said.
Morales and Kostoff had plenty
of aid, however — about a
M*A*S*H unit's worth. For
starters, witness the stellar sup
port of the Cardinal backstrokers,
most notably sophomore Jay Mor
tenson. Expected "to have a
chance to break the American
record in the 100 back before he
leaves Stanford." according to
Kenney, Mortenson was a bit
precocious, establishing the new
standard on the opening back
stroke leg of the victorious 400
medley-relay swim.
In the 100 backstroke in
dividual title, Mortenson came in
second behind Harvard's David
Berkoff, who swam the initial 25
yards almost entirely underwater,
relying upon a strong dolphin
from the starting shove-off.
More than just a backstroking
guy from Wisconsin, Mortenson
also recorded a second-place
clocking in the 100 butterfly be
hind Morales.
In addition to Mortenson, junior
Sean Murphy was a finalist in
both the 100 and 200 backstroke
for the third straight year, claim
ing eighth and fourth place
respectively. Junior Matt Nance,
meanwhile, finished 12th overall
in the 200 backstroke while secur
ing a lOth-place spot in the 200
IM.
If patience is a virtue and age is
wisdom, then youth must be vir
tuous speed. Or at least some

thing to the tune of freshman free
stylers John Witchcl. Doug
Lilydahl and Byron Burson.
On the second day, Witchel
swam four 200-yard freestyle
swims, leading off both the time
trial and championship 800
freestyle relay and swimming two
more in the individual 200
freestyle competition. At the day's
end, Witchel earned seventh indi
vidually while helping the relay
team post a fifth-place finish. "He

did a hell of a job," Kenney said
succinctly.
Lilydahl's and Burson's mark
became most manifest in the
prelimary 400 freestyle relay.
Swimming the third leg, Lilydahl
— nicknamed "the human high
light film" by teammates —
brought the Stanford four back
into the forefront. Anchor Byron
Burson continued the charge, and
suddenly, the Cardinal was
staring at a No. 2 seeding going

into the finals. Stanford eventu
ally finished tied for third with Mi
chigan.
Sophomore John Hodge, who
swam all the freestyle relays, pro
vided more freestyle bounty as he
snared 15th overall in the 200
freestyle.
The Cardinal championship
count would have been a few skips
higher had it not been for one un
fortunate dive in the 3-meter
diving competion. Stanford's Matt

Frawley was sixth in the late
rounds until a difficult attempt
went awry. Frawley, only a sopho
more, ended up 17th overall.
Under the Wake
Throughout the three-day event, the
Stanford cheering section, comprised
of a host of parents, friends and
former swimmers, was without ques
tion the loudest and most boisterous
— clearly domimant over the partisan
Texas crowd.

second behind Harvard's David
Berkoff, who swam the initial 25
yards almost entirely underwater,
relying upon a strong dolphin
from the starting shove-off.
More than just a backstroking
guy from Wisconsin, Mortenson
also recorded a second-place
clocking in the 100 butterfly be
hind Morales.
In addition to Mortenson, junior
Sean Murphy was a finalist in
both the 100 and 200 backstroke
for the third straight year, claim
ing eighth and fourth place
respectively. Junior Matt Nance,
meanwhile, finished 12th overall
in the 200 backstroke while secur

IM.
If patience is a virtue and age is
wisdom, then youth must be vir

On the second day, Witchel
swam four 200-yard freestyle
swims, leading off both the time
trial and championship 800
freestyle relay and swimming two
more in the individual 200
freestyle competition. At the day's
end, Witchel earned seventh indi
vidually while helping the relay
team post a fifth-place finish. "He

did a hell of a job," Kenney said
succinctly.
Lilydahl's and Burson's mark
became most manifest in the
prelimary 400 freestyle relay.
Swimming the third leg, Lilydahl
— nicknamed "the human high

brought the Stanford four back
into the forefront. Anchor Byron
Burson continued the charge, and
suddenly, the Cardinal was
staring at a No. 2 seeding going

platform, a place where Sherpas,

ness cards, Stanford Coach Skip
Kenney and Asst. Coach Ted
Knapp briefly surveyed the crowd
before making their noble, post
victory plunge.
Adrenaline, no doubt, has its
coercive influence.
In an emotionally charged final
third day, the Stanford men's
swimming team padded its sizable
second-day lead and won its third
consecutive NCAA championship
Saturday.
Trailing only after the first
night, the Cardinal had a busy
second and third evening at the
awards podium. All told, Stanford
finished with 374, while second
place USC had 296 points.
Third-place Florida had 293
points, followed by California
(269), Texas (257), Michigan
(174), UCLA (146) and Louisiana
State (145).
Kenney, selected as Swimming
Coach of the Year for the third

consecutive season, was clearly
enthused.
"The feeling of winning a na
tional championship is so fantas
tic, I can't even describe it," said
Kenney, who spent some time
poking at a shriveled contact lens
after he was ceremonially thrown
into the pool. "We knew coming in
that if we swam well, we'd win.
And we did. It's a great thrill.
"I think this Is one of the
greatest teams In NCAA history.
Nobody can say we were lucky to
win. We have great athletes on
this team."
And unquestionably, Stanford
has the finest NCAA swimmer ever
— Pablo Morales, who topped off
his incredible Cardinal career
with 11 NCAA individual titles out
of a possible 12, breaking the old
mark of 10 set by USC's John
Naber.
Entering the championship,
Morales heard continual whispers
of his realistic chance of establish
ing the all-time individual mark.
After he won the 200-yard individ
ual medley and the 100 butterfly,
the latter only .11 second off his
American record set last year, the

whispers grew to Van Halen-esque
proportions.
"I tried to Ignore it." Morales
said, referring to the media hype.
"I just wanted to go out ag
gressively; the only thing I had on
my mind was race strategy."
The race was the 200 butterfly,
his chief competitor Anthony
Mosse. a Stanford teammate.
Mosse, a 1984 Olympian, said
that he felt like he was "caught be
tween a rock and a hard place"
when thinking about prospects of
winning the race and denying
Morales the record mark.
Ultimately, Mosse saw the
pressure-packed ocassion as "an
incentive to take up the challenge,
to go after it."
Taking full advantage of his 100-
butterfly speed. Morales surged to
a relatively quick full body length
lead, an advantage he held en
route to a new American record
time of 1:42.60 and a cornerstone
in NCAA swimming history.
"You can't beat this, being able
to swim well personally and
having the team win," Morales
said."lt's a privilege to be men
tioned in the same breath as John
Naber. I feel very fortunate."
After the record-shattering per
formance, the Stanford team
gathered at the end of the lane and
delievered the traditional "Leland
Stanford" anthem to congratulate
its senior tri-captaln.
Mosse, visably disappointed by
his swim, was characteristically
diplomatic and talked of his
friendship with Morales.
"He's the reason why I came to
Stanford," Mosse said. "I wanted
to work out with the best. Pablo
adds so much to the team besides
points. His leadership and inspi
ration will be missed."
Morales did not win Swimmer of
the Year — edged out by Cal's Matt
Biondi, who set three American
records in the 50. 100 and 200
freestyle.
Stanford also got a superlative
showing from another one of its
Olympians, tri-captain Jeff Kos
toff. Coming off a sixth-place
finish in the 500 freestyle, an

event that has handcuffed him for
four years at the NCAAs, Kostoff
approached his final two races,
the 400 IM and the 1650 freestyle,
with added vigor.
The results certainly came —
blue ribbons in both. "Actually, I
wanted to win three titles," Kos
toff admitted afterwards. "I
haven't quite got enough speed for
the 500. Each year I think, This is
the year to put it all together.' "
To see Kostoff and Morales
finish their Stanford careers in
championship fashion was a truly
a cherished moment for Kenney.
"They are our leaders. Pablo and
K.B. (Kostoffs nickname) swam
so well. To go out on top with
these two is very special." Kenney
said.
Morales and Kostoff had plenty
of aid, however — about a
M*A*S*H unit's worth. For
starters, witness the stellar sup
port of the Cardinal backstrokers,
most notably sophomore Jay Mor
tenson. Expected "to have a
chance to break the American
record in the 100 back before he
leaves Stanford." according to
Kenney, Mortenson was a bit
precocious, establishing the new
standard on the opening back
stroke leg of the victorious 400
medley-relay swim.
In the 100 backstroke in
dividual title, Mortenson came in
second behind Harvard's David
Berkoff, who swam the initial 25
yards almost entirely underwater,
relying upon a strong dolphin
from the starting shove-off.
More than just a backstroking
