AUSTIN, Tex. — High atop the
Texas Swim Center's 10-meter
platform, a place where Sherpas,
migrating geese and gallant
oxygen molecules exchange busi
ness cards, Stanford Coach Skip
Kenney and Asst. Coach Ted
Knapp briefly surveyed the crowd
before making their noble, post
victory plunge.
Adrenaline, no doubt, has its
coercive influence.
In an emotionally charged final
third day, the Stanford men's
swimming team padded its sizable
second-day lead and won its third
consecutive NCAA championship
Saturday.
Trailing only after the first
night, the Cardinal had a busy
second and third evening at the
awards podium. All told, Stanford
finished with 374, while second
place USC had 296 points.
Third-place Florida had 293
points, followed by California
(269), Texas (257), Michigan
(174), UCLA (146) and Louisiana
State (145).
Kenney, selected as Swimming
Coach of the Year for the third

consecutive season, was clearly
enthused.
"The feeling of winning a na
tional championship is so fantas
tic, I can't even describe it," said
Kenney, who spent some time
poking at a shriveled contact lens
after he was ceremonially thrown
into the pool. "We knew coming in
that if we swam well, we'd win.
And we did. It's a great thrill.
"I think this Is one of the
greatest teams In NCAA history.
Nobody can say we were lucky to
win. We have great athletes on
this team."
And unquestionably, Stanford
has the finest NCAA swimmer ever
— Pablo Morales, who topped off
his incredible Cardinal career
with 11 NCAA individual titles out
of a possible 12, breaking the old
mark of 10 set by USC's John
Naber.
Entering the championship,
Morales heard continual whispers
of his realistic chance of establish
ing the all-time individual mark.
After he won the 200-yard individ
ual medley and the 100 butterfly,
the latter only .11 second off his
American record set last year, the


Freshman Byron Burson, sophomore Jay Mortenson and friends
hoist the NCAA men's swimming championship trophy above their

heads. The Cardinal won the national championship this weekend,
outscoring its nearest competitors by 78 points.
