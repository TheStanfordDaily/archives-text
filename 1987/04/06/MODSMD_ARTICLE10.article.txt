# Lightning disrupts KZSU broadcast
## 
### 
A bolt of lightning that struck
Stanford Friday afternoon forced
the campus radio station. KZSU
FM, off the air for nearly 90
minutes, according to Station
Manager Scott Martin.
"We got zapped, but we didn't
suffer any major damage." he
said.
KZSU Chief Engineer Mark
Lawrence said the lightning
caused only *10 to >20 worth of
damage to equipment.
The station was off the air from
1:35 to 2:59 p.m. while he
repaired the damages.
According to Lawrence, light
ning that struck campus
electrified the ground for a split
second, causing increased voltage
In the cable that connects the
KZSU studio in Memorial
Auditorium with Its transmitter
in the foothills near the Dish.
The high voltage blew two fuses
In the remote control, which is

used to control the power of the
transmitter. Lawrence said. It also
destroyed the two amplifiers that
the station's signal passes
through on its way to the trans
mitter.
According to Lawrence, fuses in
the remote control are designed to
blow when lightning strikes, pre
venting damage to more expensive
equipment at either end of the
cable. Apparently, he said, the
safety equipment that protected
the two amplifiers could not
withstand the voltage.
Lawrence said he tuned into
KZSU after he saw the lightning
strike.
After driving to the transmitter
and finding nothing amiss there,
Lawrence returned to the studio
and discovered the damages. He
said he replaced the fuses and one
of the amplifiers, and repaired the
other amplifier.
