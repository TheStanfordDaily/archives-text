At 9:35 this morning, nine gentlemen from
Cleveland will be in Canada to do battle with
nine gentlemen from Toronto. The event
would be insignificant were it not for the fact
that these men are members of the Indians
and Blue Jays, and their meeting is the first
game of the 1987 Major League baseball
season.
Fans everywhere have been waiting over
five months for this moment. It is at this
time of year when everyone is certain that his
team will win. Failures of past years are for
gotten come April. The older players are cer
tain to provide leadership, those in the
middle of their careers will finally reach their
potential and a young phenom or two will
provide the last piece in the puzzle. This year
is the year the team will go all the way.
In a few weeks, though, reality will set in,
as the teams play up (or down) to their true
ability. Then the real questions will begin to

be answered. Will the Red Sox recover from
their World Series collapse and win their first
title in nearly 70 years? Do Texas and
Cleveland finally have enough talent to win?
Can the Yankees muster the pitching neces
sary to complement their devastating batting
power? Can Cincinnati's Eric Davis really hit
.300, steal 130 bases and hit 50 homers in
one year? Can Don Mattingly surpass the
already imposing Hall of Fame statistics that
he has chalked up in just three full years in
the majors? Will Wade Boggs continue his
dominance at the plate? Will Roger Clemens
have another MVP season?
When the first pitch is thrown today it will
no longer matter whether the owners are col
luding to keep players' salaries down. For the
next six months, the faithful will check the
standings every day to check on the progress
of the home team. The magic spell of our na
tional pastime will once again hold the
country in its grasp. Baseball is back.
