# The 						life and times of Oral
## 
### 
Oral "Redemption" Roberts was born in a
manger not far from the little village of Prayer
town on July 4, 1777. He immediately pub
lished a critique of the Sermon on the Mount,
calling it a "fatally flawed, hopelessly vague
document." He followed this up with his
monumental revision of the Bible, the "Oral
Testament." that perched atop The New York
Times best seller list for over 100 years.

Bored with his success as an author,
Roberts turned his energies to education. In
an unprecedented act. he founded the pres
tigious Ivy Oral Schools, which included the
University of Oral and the Oral Roberts In
stitute for the Divinely Motivated. Within the
course of two cocktail parties, Roberts
managed to raise an impressive *8 million en
dowment for the schools. It was this unheard
of fundraising success that caused me to
.conclude, "Oh my God."
By the precocious age of 10, Oral decided to
raise enough money to fund the upcoming War
of 1812, which he predicted in his widely
praised speech. "I have a prophecy." He would
have been successful in this task had it not
been for the intervention of the world's mili

tary generals, who pleaded with him to resolve
the conflict. He acceded, saying, "It's a dirty
job, but God sent me to do it."
At the age of 18, Oral decided it was time to
unite the people of the world and so he created
The Oral Roberts Society for the Advancement
of Love (ORAL) and was awarded the distin
guished Oral Roberts prize for contribution to
world peace. He recorded this triumph in a
journal titled "Arkansas, Adolescence and the
American Answer" — another best seller.
For 181 years, the people of the earth lived in
peace, love and understanding. But one day,
Oral got in front of his TV camera and told the
people that God had descended to him in a
dream and told him that he wasn't going to be
around much longer, as heaven was in need of
Oral's services.
This immediately caused two mischievous
men named Jerry and Jimmy to get into an ar
gument over who would inherit the Kingdom
of Oral. Both men laid strong reasons for their
claim, but the dispute was finally resolved by
Oral himself. In a watershed decision, Judge
Oral ruled that Jerry should get a majority of
the mortals and Jimmy would get all of Oral's
TV shows. The two men seemed satisfied with
the agreement and exchanged auto
biographies.
Oral's time to go had finally come and he left
as »he came, with sunbeams in his eyes and
some unidentifiable glow around his head.
Jerry was happy with his Moral Majority
(Oral's lawyer was a terrible speller and wrote
"moral" Instead of "mortal" in Oral's will) and

Jimmy liked his TV shows.
But a man named Jim persuaded Jimmy to
give him a couple of TV shows because he was
such good friends with Jerry. Jimmy agreed
and soon Jim and Jerry became the best of
friends.
Everything was going swell until a scantily
clad harlet named Carol Doda came forward
and said that she was having an affair with
Jim but couldn't continue this immoral life
style. She was quoted in The Oral Roberts
Review as saying, "I'm tired of being treated
like a tramp!" and said aliens that looked like
Bill Cosby talked her into the dastardly deed.
Naturally, this got Jerry upset and he hurried
out of his office in a flurry. He called a press
conference and implicated Jimmy in the plot.
Jimmy was stunned.
Now Jim and Jerry had a hotly contested
feud with Jimmy about who should gain con
trol of the divided kingdom. Jim said that
Jimmy hated Jerry and that's why the whole
mess got started. Jimmy replied that he was
innocent and cited the fact that he had never
seen aliens that looked like Bill Cosby before.
Jerry declined to comment, saying he was
"content that the majority is behind me on this
one."
It looked as though the struggle would never
end until one day a bright young man named
Pat offered to be an impartial arbitrator for the
two parties. They agreed and told Pat the whole
story. Pat listened and finally said,
"Gentleman, I think I've got a solution. If I am
elected. . . "
