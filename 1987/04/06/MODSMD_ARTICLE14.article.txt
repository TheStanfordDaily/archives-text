# U.S. aids Turkish intimidation
## 
### 
Last week Greece and Turkey
were on the brink of war. The
Turkish and Greek armed forces
were put on alert. The Greek gov
ernment ordered a limited
mobilization of reserves and
decided to suspend the operations
of the U.S. base at Nea Makri near
Athens.
The crisis that threatened to
lead to war between two members

of NATO began early in March
when the Greek government
decided to acquire a controlling
stake in a Canadian-led consor
tium that was set up to exploit oil
fields in the Aegean Sea. Greece
reportedly made this decision be
cause it wished to avoid increased
tensions with Turkey. Prior to the
takeover, the consortium was
planning to drill for oil 11 miles off
the Greek island of Thasos. The
spot belongs to the island's con
tinental shelf according to inter
national law. but Turkey disputes
this.
In 1976, the two countries were
on the brink of war over the same
issue. That crisis was neutralized
by the Bern Agreement of 1976. in
which they undertook "to abstain
from any Initiative or act relating
to the continental shelf of the
Aegean Sea that might prejudice
the negotiations." The Greek gov
ernment in recent weeks was care
ful not to violate the Bern Agree
ment. even though it disputes Its
continuing validity after it broke
off negotiations in 1981. The
takeover of the consortium was
portrayed in Greece as implying
an indefinite postponement of
drilling in disputed areas.
The Turkish government inter
preted the takeover differently —
seeing it as a move by the Greek
government to violate the Bern
Agreement. Despite the fact that
after the takeover the consortium
made no move toward new oil

drilling, the Turkish government
decided to pre-empt the Greeks by
sending its own exploration ves
sel, the Slsmik 1, into the
disputed area. This was an exact
repetition of the 1976 crisis, even
to the detail that it was the same
Turkish vessel in both cases.
Predictably, the Turkish move
brought the two countries to the
brink of a military confrontation.
As the Sismlk 1 was moving
toward the disputed area, the
navies of the two countries were
converging at that point. War was
averted at the last moment when
Turkey backed down under in
tense diplomatic pressure from its
Western allies and ordered the Sis
mik 1 to remain in Turkish ter
ritorial waters.
This instance of the Turkish
tendency to push the Aegean
dispute to the brink of war is in
dicative of its general policy of in
timidation.
The narrow issue at stake in last
month's crisis is a dispute over
the continental shelf rights of the
Greek islands of the eastern
Aegean near Turkey. The right of
an Island to claim a continental
shelf was stipulated in the Geneva
Convention of 1958 and reaf
firmed at the International Law of
the Sea Convention of 1982.
Of the four states that did not
sign the 1982 treaty — the United
States. Venezuela. Israel and
Turkey — only Turkey disputed
the continental shelf rights of is
lands (the United States disputed
the clauses related to exploitation
of sea beds beyond continental
shelf rights on free-market
grounds).
The Turkish argument is that
the landmass of Asia Minor estab
lishes continental shelf rights that
override those of the Greek Islands
in the eastern Aegean. No other
country in the world accepts such
a principle, since it would reduce
the exploitation rights of islands
located near continental land
masses, such as Britain in the
North Sea, to their territorial
waters (12 miles, usually). If the
Turkish position were to prevail,
it would mean the economic suf

focation of the Greek islands of
the eastern Aegean, because
beyond their territorial waters
they are surrounded by areas of
the continental shelf, all of which
would belong to Turkey.
In pursuing its line, the Turkish
government has persistently
avoided International arbitration.
In both the 1976 and the 1987
crises, as well as at other times,
Turkey rejected proposals by the
Greek government to submit the
case to the International Court of
Justice at The Hague. Further, on
March 29 the Turkish Prime Mini
ster Turgut Ozal rejected a U.S.
State Department proposal that
Greece and Turkey submit their
dispute to NATO arbitration.
To back its diplomatic man
euvers with a big stick, Turkey In
the mid-1970s created the Army of
the Aegean — equipped with 200
landing craft — and stationed it
on the Turkish shores opposite
the Greek islands of the eastern
Aegean. This is a particularly in
timidating threat to the Greeks,
whose memories of the Turkish
Invasion of Cyprus in 1974 are
still fresh.
The Turkish policy of Intimida
tion stems from its awareness
that Turkey is a larger and
militarily stronger nation than
Greece. This has led to the atti
tude that "might is right."
It is outrageous that a policy of
intimidation — based on "might
is right" and pursued by one
member of the NATO alliance at
the expense of another — is
viewed with equanimity by the
United States.
The American posture toward
the Greek-Turkish conflict is
strangely dichotomous. On the
one hand, the prevalent attitudes
toward the conflict are that it is a
dispute between two allies in
NATO who have ancient enmities
and who are unreasonably
paranoid of each other. On the
other hand, the United States has
strongly contributed to the mili
tary advantage of Turkey over
Greece. This advantage is largely
the result of the fact that up to the
mid-'7os. U.S. military aid to

Greece and Turkey overwhelm
ingly favored Turkey.
In the aftermath of the 1974
Turkish Invasion of Cyprus —
that disillusioned many Greeks
about the "collective security" that
the alliance is supposed to provide
— the Greek government at
tempted to commit the United
States to a more balanced military
aid policy. In 1976, the United
States agreed to a legally non
binding ratio of 10 to seven for
U.S. military aid to Turkey and
Greece. This was upheld by the
United States until early this year
when it began once again to favor
Turkey disproportionately.
The arguments in favor of
strong militaiy aid toward Turkey
are geopolitical. Turkey borders
the Soviet Union. Iran. Iraq and
Syria. Its geopolitical significance
increased with the collapse of the
Shah of Iran and the Soviet inva
sion of Afghanistan. No doubt,
these larger concerns necesarily
have to figure prominently in
American policy.
The issue is that the catering of
the geopolitical needs of the West
ern alliance as a whole should not
be at the expense of its junior
members. The problem is that the
United States, the leader of the al
liance. is not willing to either
guarantee the rights of Greece
against its stronger and ambi
tious neighbor (it declined to
guarantee the Greek islands of the
eastern Aegean against a Turkish
invasion) or to maintain some
semblance of balance in its mili
tary aid to Greece and Turkey.
As a result, in the name of
geopolitical necessity, the alliance
seems quite willing to go along
with the intimidation of the
weaker members by the stronger.
Is this the alliance of free world
nations that we want? Are these
the Western values that we wish to
uphold, and for which the alliance
was created in the first place? If
we cannot uphold our principles
in our own house, how can we
hope to uphold them beyond the
Western world?
