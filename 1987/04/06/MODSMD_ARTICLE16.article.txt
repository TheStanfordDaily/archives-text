'Hoosiers' is a
realistic film
I don't agree with Lawrence
Shorter's view that the movie
"Hoosiers" is racist (Daily, March
31). In fact, I think it's hogwash,
and I'll tell you why.
The movie is based on histori
cal fact. For a few days in March,
1954, the tiny town of Milan,
Indiana, became the focus of
attention of the whole state.
Milan High School defeated
Muncie Central High School, a
traditional basketball super
power, to win the Indiana boys'
state high school basketball
championship. The event is still
affectionately referred to as "The
Miracle of Milan" in Indiana bas
ketball lore.
I wonder how long Shorter has
lived in Indiana. The Stanford
Student Directory for the last two
years has given his address as
Perris, California.
For the last 15 years, I have
lived in a small town of about
13,000 people in Indiana. I don't
know the exact figure, but I
would be quite surprised if more
than 1 percent of my hometown
population is black. This is typi
cal of small-town Indiana.
The reason you didn't see black
people in Hickory in the movie is

because they are very rare in real
life. I have never met, nor even
heard of, a black farmer in In
diana.
However, there are places in
Indiana with significant black
populations. Cities like Fort
Wayne, Indianapolis, Terre
Haute, Gary and South Bend all
have a large number of black
people. In the championship
game in the movie, the Hickory
team plays South Bend Central
High School. It's likely that, even
in 1952, such an urban high
school team would have some
black players.
I played basketball for my high
school team in Indiana. When we
traveled to Gary for a game, many
players on the other team and
many of the fans were black.
But when we played somewhere
like North Judson, a small town
analogous to Hickory, it was al
ways a white team with a
coach and white fans, with very
few exceptions. That's the way'tt
really is.
To condemn "Hoosiers" as
racist because it accurately
portrays the racial and cultural
situation in small-town Indiana is
not only unfair, it's a ridiculous
accusation. I wouldn't expect to
see many white people in a film
set in Harlem.
