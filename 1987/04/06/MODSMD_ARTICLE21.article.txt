## Is Dead Week really dead at Stanford? 
### KATHY LACHENAUER Staff writer 
This April, as Christians
celebrate Easter, Stanford under
graduates rejoice In their own
resurrections. Although Dead
Week was less than a month ago,
students have come back to life
with cheerier faces, browner
bodies and lighter course loads
now that it is spring.
Despite spring's brightness, the
horrors of Dead Week's early ex
ams, last-minute papers and pro
fessors cramming in new material
are not easily forgotten by stu
dents. Many complain about the
name and purpose of the last
study week of the quarter.
For sophomore Alison Savitz,
Dead Week was the liveliest aca
demic week of her winter quarter.
She had a computer science pro
gram and a 10-page sociology
paper due as well as two exams
during Dead Week. "Calling it
'Dead Week' seems like a joke."
Savitz said.
Agreeing with Savitz's state
ment, Assoc. Dean of Humanities
and Sciences Carolyn Lougee said

"the worst thing about Dead Week
is the name."
Lougee explained that during
Dead Week, extracurricular activi
ties that require student partici
pation are not to take place, but
the policy concerning course work
is not as clear.
"Professors are not supposed to
initiate work unless It's done
routinely," according to Lougee.
Junior Clark Eller's professors
have not all followed Dead Week
guidelines. Eller, a transfer stu
dent from UC-Irvlne, said there
was no formal study week policy at
Irvine, but that professors simply
did not assign new material.
"Here It's Dead Week, but teach
ers still give problem sets, new as
signments and take-homes," Eller
said. He said that in his
aeronautic engineering class, he
not only had a problem set as
signed during Dead Week, but one
during finals week also.
Engineering students seemed
particularly confused by Dead
Week's name and purpose. "Why
do they even call It Dead Week'?"
sophomore Edward Silva asked.
Silva, who is majoring in electrical

engineering, said he has more
problem sets due during Dead
Week than at any other time
during the quarter.
But Stanford is not the only
school with a study week policy
that sometimes confuses stu
dents. Carl Thum, academic skills
trainer at Dartmouth College, said
"our reading week sends an am
biguous message to students."
Like Stanford. Dartmouth Is on
the quarter system, and the week
before exams is called "reading
week." During reading week,
classes meet, but new material is
not to be assigned. Besides
reading week, students have two
to three days without classes
before their first exams.
According to Thum. reading
week is a time for Dartmouth stu
dents to catch up. but some see it
as a cramming period for a quar
ter's worth of undone work.
Northwestern University, an
other school on the quarter sys
tem, has a study week almost
identical to Dead Week.
According to Harold Stare, as
sistant to the dean of the College

of Arts and Sciences, "there are
classes scheduled, but no exams
and assignments may be due
during the reading period."
But Stare explained that profes
sors often take hand counts in
class and vote for scheduling the
exams during the reading week to
give students and faculty a longer
spring vacation. Problems arise
from this voting system when
some Northwestern students are
faced with three exams in one day.
Stanford's Dead Week policy
prevents such an overload. Ac
cording to Lougee, if a professor
opts for a day during Dead Week
for the final, the officially sched
uled exam time must still remain
open to students.
Audrey Bernfield, director of un
dergraduate advising at Stanford,
praised the policy whereby two
exam times could be offered, and
said Dead Week's flexibility really
benefits the students.
"The faculty is responsive to
students' Interests" and does not
rigidly adhere to the exam
schedule, according to Bernfield.
Crafty students like Savitz took
full advantage of this flexible

policy. Although her Dead Week
was crammed with studying and
taking finals, she had two weeks
of spring vacation. "I was all done
by Monday of finals week," Savitz
said.
This fast-paced, "cram" study
ing troubled academic advisers.
For example, one Northwestern of
ficial admitted that the univer
sity's reading period leaves little
time for contemplation.

Dartmouth's Thum called Har
vard's two-week. class-free
reading period a more appropriate
amount of time to reflect on a se
mester's worth of Information
before exams.
Bernfield sees a similar need for
reflective time at Stanford. "I
think Dead Week should be dead
and we should not have classes,"
Bernfield said.
