## Card nine takes two at USC 
### TOM SENF Senior staff writer 
LOS ANGELES — USC's Brian Nichols
turned what could have been a great weekend
for Stanford into just a good one, hurling a
five-hit complete game to lead the Trojans to a
3-1 win yesterday over the Cardinal at Dedeaux
Field.
The victory averted a Stanford sweep of the
three-game weekend series. The Cardinal had
won Saturday 9-4 and Friday 4-0 behind Jack
McDowell's two-hit, 13-strikeout shutout — a
performance Stanford Coach Mark Marquess
called "as good any in his career here."
USC Coach Mike Gillespie was more than
happy to salvage one game, as yesterday's vic
tory broke a seven-game Pacific 10 Southern
Division losing streak for the Trojans and
snapped a 10-game Cardinal league win streak
as well.
"It beats a sweep by a long shot," he said.
"It's clear it will be a two-team race (between
Stanford and UCLA), but there's gonna be a
dogfight for third and it's reasonable that the
third team might get into the regionals."
Stanford is now 10-3 in the Six-Pac,
percentage points ahead of UCLA (11-4). USC

and Arizona State, which swept California at
home this weekend, are tied for third, four
games back at 7-8. Arizona is in fifth at 6-9.
Nichols, who was the Trojans' starting
catcher in the first two games, got the starting
nod when John Reilley was sidelined with the
flu. Nichols is no stranger to the mound,
however. The junior right-hander has been the
nation's top reliever this year with two wjns,
no losses and 15 saves in 19 relief appear
ances.
Still, before yesterday, his longest stint had
been 2 1/3 innings. Was Gillespie surprised
Nichols went the distance?
"Yes . . . astounded." he said.
Nichols is accustomed to coming out of the
bullpen throwing heat, but had to change his
style yesterday to keep the Stanford hitters off
balance and to pace himself. "I knew I couldn't
throw fastballs for nine innings." he said. "I
had to mix my pitches. I took it as a challenge
to throw my breaking ball over the plate."
Nichols met the challenge, painting the cor
ners all day with his slow curve and changeup.
Only Toi Cook and Ed Sprague were really able
to solve him. each with two hits. Cook drove in
the Cardinal's only run with a sixth-inning
single.

Stanford wasted a good pitching perfor
mance from Brian Keyser and Rob Wassenaar,
who limited the Trojans to five hits. "Usually,
holding them to three runs is good enough,"
Marquess said.
But Keyser got himself in trouble three times
with leadoff walks, and twice it cost him, as
the men came around to score in both the
fourth and fifth innings to give him his first
loss of the season against three wins.
Wassenaar came on in the sixth and allowed
no hits and one intentional walk, but he was
nicked for an unearned run in the eighth for
the game's final tally.
Two opposite-field singles by the left-handed
hitting Jeff Saenger staked Stanford to a 3-0
lead in the fourth Inning Friday night. Then,
after the Trojans scored an unearned run off
Cardinal starter Jim Price, Ruben Amaro put
Stanford back up by three with a solo homer
off USC starter and loser Randy Powers (4-3).
"They'd been working me fastball in and
away," Amaro said. "I got jammed a little bit,
but I got enough of it to get it out."
The Trojans tied the game in the fifth and
knocked Price out in the sixth, but the Card-
lnal went ahead to stay in the
seventh with a two-run uprising
that made a winner out of reliever
A 1 Osuna (4-2). then put it away
with a three-run eighth.
The key hits in the inning were
a two-run, two-out single to right
by David Esquer and an RBI triple
by Arnaro. On the pitch before his
hit, Amaro had gone to first. Un
fortunately. the count was only 3-
2.
"That's the first time that's ever
happened to me," Amaro said. "He
had thrown so many pitches. I
figured he'd come back with a
fastball, and I turned on it pretty
good. I just laughed it off."

No USC players or fans were
laughing during Friday's game, as
McDowell's awesome display of
power pitching had the Trojans
completely overmatched. The 13
strikeouts tied the career high
McDowell set last week against
Arizona State and served notice
that the injuries that had plagued
him since last May are now in the
past.
"Jack threw unbelievably well."
catcher Doug Robbins said. "It's
the hardest I've ever seen him
throw."
Of his approximately 120
pitches, McDowell threw 90
fastballs, most of which were over
90 miles per hour. After reaching
a high of 94 mph, McDowell was
still bringing it at 90 in the ninth
inning.
"That's probably the hardest I've
thrown start to finish in my

career," said McDowell, who ran
his record to 5-1. 4-0 in Slx-Pac
Play-
Stanford got an unearned run
off USC starter Darrln Beer (5-5)
in the fourth, then extended it to
3-0 In the seventh on a Paul Carey
double and a Saenger single.
Although there were only two
runs scored in the inning, there
were also two pitching changes,
giving McDowell a long rest he did
not want — especially on a cold,
windy night.
"I was really conscious of that."
McDowell said. "That's hurt me so
far this year — we have a big in
ning, I come out and I'm stiff. So 1
went back inside (the clubhouse)
and stretched out."
He need not have worried. After
walking the leadoff man in the
bottom of the seventh, he fanned
Jim Campanis, blew Corby Oakes

away with a 92-mph heater, then
rung up A1 Vlllasenor. who began
the weekend as the Slx-Pac's
leading hitter, to strike out the
side. Both Oakes and Vlllasenor
earned the hat trick for the night.
Card notes
Keyser started yesterday because
Stanford's No. 2 starter, Lee Plemel,
is ineligible due to an incomplete last
quarter that dropped him below the
required number of units. Marquess
said that he and Plemel have dis
cussed the situation and that he ex
pects the Junior right-hander back for
next weekend's crucial series with
UCLA.

Of his approximately 120
pitches, McDowell threw 90
fastballs, most of which were over
90 miles per hour. After reaching
a high of 94 mph, McDowell was
still bringing it at 90 in the ninth
inning.
"That's probably the hardest I've
thrown start to finish in my

career," said McDowell, who ran
his record to 5-1. 4-0 in Slx-Pac
Play-
Stanford got an unearned run
off USC starter Darrln Beer (5-5)
in the fourth, then extended it to
3-0 In the seventh on a Paul Carey
double and a Saenger single.
Although there were only two
runs scored in the inning, there
were also two pitching changes,
giving McDowell a long rest he did
not want — especially on a cold,
windy night.
"I was really conscious of that."
McDowell said. "That's hurt me so
far this year — we have a big in
ning, I come out and I'm stiff. So 1
went back inside (the clubhouse)
and stretched out."
He need not have worried. After
walking the leadoff man in the
bottom of the seventh, he fanned
Jim Campanis, blew Corby Oakes

away with a 92-mph heater, then
rung up A1 Vlllasenor. who began
the weekend as the Slx-Pac's
leading hitter, to strike out the
side. Both Oakes and Vlllasenor
earned the hat trick for the night.
Card notes
Keyser started yesterday because
Stanford's No. 2 starter, Lee Plemel,
is ineligible due to an incomplete last
quarter that dropped him below the
required number of units. Marquess
said that he and Plemel have dis
cussed the situation and that he ex
pects the Junior right-hander back for
next weekend's crucial series with
UCLA.
LOS ANGELES — USC's Brian Nichols
turned what could have been a great weekend
for Stanford into just a good one, hurling a
five-hit complete game to lead the Trojans to a
3-1 win yesterday over the Cardinal at Dedeaux
Field.
The victory averted a Stanford sweep of the
three-game weekend series. The Cardinal had
won Saturday 9-4 and Friday 4-0 behind Jack
McDowell's two-hit, 13-strikeout shutout — a
performance Stanford Coach Mark Marquess
called "as good any in his career here."
USC Coach Mike Gillespie was more than
happy to salvage one game, as yesterday's vic
tory broke a seven-game Pacific 10 Southern
Division losing streak for the Trojans and
snapped a 10-game Cardinal league win streak
as well.
"It beats a sweep by a long shot," he said.
"It's clear it will be a two-team race (between
Stanford and UCLA), but there's gonna be a
dogfight for third and it's reasonable that the
third team might get into the regionals."
Stanford is now 10-3 in the Six-Pac,
percentage points ahead of UCLA (11-4). USC

and Arizona State, which swept California at
home this weekend, are tied for third, four
games back at 7-8. Arizona is in fifth at 6-9.
Nichols, who was the Trojans' starting
catcher in the first two games, got the starting
nod when John Reilley was sidelined with the
flu. Nichols is no stranger to the mound,
however. The junior right-hander has been the
nation's top reliever this year with two wjns,
no losses and 15 saves in 19 relief appear
ances.
Still, before yesterday, his longest stint had
been 2 1/3 innings. Was Gillespie surprised
Nichols went the distance?
"Yes . . . astounded." he said.
Nichols is accustomed to coming out of the
bullpen throwing heat, but had to change his
style yesterday to keep the Stanford hitters off
balance and to pace himself. "I knew I couldn't
throw fastballs for nine innings." he said. "I
had to mix my pitches. I took it as a challenge
to throw my breaking ball over the plate."
Nichols met the challenge, painting the cor
ners all day with his slow curve and changeup.
Only Toi Cook and Ed Sprague were really able
to solve him. each with two hits. Cook drove in
the Cardinal's only run with a sixth-inning
single.

Stanford wasted a good pitching perfor
mance from Brian Keyser and Rob Wassenaar,
who limited the Trojans to five hits. "Usually,
holding them to three runs is good enough,"
Marquess said.
But Keyser got himself in trouble three times
with leadoff walks, and twice it cost him, as
the men came around to score in both the
fourth and fifth innings to give him his first
loss of the season against three wins.
Wassenaar came on in the sixth and allowed
no hits and one intentional walk, but he was
nicked for an unearned run in the eighth for
the game's final tally.
Two opposite-field singles by the left-handed
hitting Jeff Saenger staked Stanford to a 3-0
lead in the fourth Inning Friday night. Then,
after the Trojans scored an unearned run off
Cardinal starter Jim Price, Ruben Amaro put
Stanford back up by three with a solo homer
off USC starter and loser Randy Powers (4-3).
"They'd been working me fastball in and
away," Amaro said. "I got jammed a little bit,
but I got enough of it to get it out."
The Trojans tied the game in the fifth and
knocked Price out in the sixth, but the Card-
lnal went ahead to stay in the
seventh with a two-run uprising
that made a winner out of reliever
A 1 Osuna (4-2). then put it away
with a three-run eighth.
The key hits in the inning were
a two-run, two-out single to right
by David Esquer and an RBI triple
by Arnaro. On the pitch before his
hit, Amaro had gone to first. Un
fortunately. the count was only 3-
2.
"That's the first time that's ever
happened to me," Amaro said. "He
had thrown so many pitches. I
figured he'd come back with a
fastball, and I turned on it pretty
good. I just laughed it off."

No USC players or fans were
laughing during Friday's game, as
McDowell's awesome display of
power pitching had the Trojans
completely overmatched. The 13
strikeouts tied the career high
McDowell set last week against
Arizona State and served notice
that the injuries that had plagued
him since last May are now in the
past.
"Jack threw unbelievably well."
catcher Doug Robbins said. "It's
the hardest I've ever seen him
throw."

pitches, McDowell threw 90
fastballs, most of which were over
90 miles per hour. After reaching
