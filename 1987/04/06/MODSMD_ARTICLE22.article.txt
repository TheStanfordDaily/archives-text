## Card nine takes two at USC 
### TOM SENF Senior staff writer 
LOS ANGELES — USC's Brian Nichols
turned what could have been a great weekend
for Stanford into just a good one, hurling a
five-hit complete game to lead the Trojans to a
3-1 win yesterday over the Cardinal at Dedeaux
Field.
The victory averted a Stanford sweep of the
three-game weekend series. The Cardinal had
won Saturday 9-4 and Friday 4-0 behind Jack
McDowell's two-hit, 13-strikeout shutout — a
performance Stanford Coach Mark Marquess
called "as good any in his career here."
USC Coach Mike Gillespie was more than
happy to salvage one game, as yesterday's vic
tory broke a seven-game Pacific 10 Southern
Division losing streak for the Trojans and
snapped a 10-game Cardinal league win streak
as well.
"It beats a sweep by a long shot," he said.
"It's clear it will be a two-team race (between
Stanford and UCLA), but there's gonna be a
dogfight for third and it's reasonable that the
third team might get into the regionals."
Stanford is now 10-3 in the Six-Pac,
percentage points ahead of UCLA (11-4). USC

and Arizona State, which swept California at
home this weekend, are tied for third, four
games back at 7-8. Arizona is in fifth at 6-9.
Nichols, who was the Trojans' starting
catcher in the first two games, got the starting
nod when John Reilley was sidelined with the
flu. Nichols is no stranger to the mound,
however. The junior right-hander has been the
nation's top reliever this year with two wjns,
no losses and 15 saves in 19 relief appear
ances.
Still, before yesterday, his longest stint had
been 2 1/3 innings. Was Gillespie surprised
Nichols went the distance?
"Yes . . . astounded." he said.
Nichols is accustomed to coming out of the
bullpen throwing heat, but had to change his
style yesterday to keep the Stanford hitters off
balance and to pace himself. "I knew I couldn't
throw fastballs for nine innings." he said. "I
had to mix my pitches. I took it as a challenge
to throw my breaking ball over the plate."
Nichols met the challenge, painting the cor
ners all day with his slow curve and changeup.
Only Toi Cook and Ed Sprague were really able
to solve him. each with two hits. Cook drove in
the Cardinal's only run with a sixth-inning
single.

Stanford wasted a good pitching perfor
mance from Brian Keyser and Rob Wassenaar,
who limited the Trojans to five hits. "Usually,
holding them to three runs is good enough,"
Marquess said.
But Keyser got himself in trouble three times
with leadoff walks, and twice it cost him, as
the men came around to score in both the
fourth and fifth innings to give him his first
loss of the season against three wins.
Wassenaar came on in the sixth and allowed
no hits and one intentional walk, but he was
nicked for an unearned run in the eighth for
the game's final tally.
Two opposite-field singles by the left-handed
hitting Jeff Saenger staked Stanford to a 3-0
lead in the fourth Inning Friday night. Then,
after the Trojans scored an unearned run off
Cardinal starter Jim Price, Ruben Amaro put
Stanford back up by three with a solo homer
off USC starter and loser Randy Powers (4-3).
"They'd been working me fastball in and
away," Amaro said. "I got jammed a little bit,
but I got enough of it to get it out."
The Trojans tied the game in the fifth and
knocked Price out in the sixth, but the Card-
