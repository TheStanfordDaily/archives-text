# Gymanasts sixth at Pac-10 meet
## 
### MARK SMOYER Staff writer 
For a program that finished
third in the nation last year, a
sixth place conference finish does
not sound very satisfying.
Then again, when the program
has been seriously hampered by
Injuries and has had to redshirt
its best performer and its top
freshman, yet still turns in a team
score better than the scoring
averages of all but five NCAA
teams, things start looking a lot
better.
So, despite their final finish in
this weekend's Pacific 10 Confer
ence Men's Invitational Cham
pionships. Stanford's gymnasts
had nothing negative to say about
their performance.
"It was our best meet of the
year." Junior Mike Matzek said.
"We proved to ourselves that we
are a really good team." Matzek
finished third overall In the all
around competition and qualified
for the this summer's U.S. Cham
pionships.
"It isn't that great to do so well
and take sixth," Chuck Gerardo
said, "but everyone on the team
was Just happy that we performed
as well as we did."
Cardinal Coach Sadao Hamada
said he had "no regrets; we did the

best that we could." With a team
score of 278.30, the squad did bet
ter than almost any team in the
country could. Unfortunately for
Stanford, most of the programs
that can do better were at the
meet.
Although the Cardinal did its
best and still lost, the Maples
Pavilion crowd was a clear winner.
With half of the 12-team field
ranked among the country's top
15, the Pac-10-plus-two competi
tion promised to highlight the
best collegiate gymnastics in the
country. It delivered.
No. 11 New Mexico pulled off the
major surprise of a meet full of
surprises, upsetting favorites No.
1 Fullerton State and No. 3 UCLA
to win the team title with 282.40
points. Fullerton was a close
second at 282.05, while the
Bruins provided the other signifi
cant surprise in the team competi
tion by finishing fifth at 279.80,
due largely to a disappointing per
formance by Tony Pineda, who
came in as the Individual favorite
and left in last place.
The subpar performances by
many of the Bruins opened the
door for unexpected Individual
leaders. In the end. California's

Mike Matzek placed third at the Pac-10 Championships with a score
of 112.60 to earn a spot at the U.S. Championships.
Mikulak finished first and second
with superb totals of 113.25 and
113 points, respectively. Matzek.
tied for first with UCLA's Curtis
Holdsworth going into Saturday's
compulsorles at 57.3. held on to
take third overall at 112.60.
Holdsworth was fourth at 111.90.
"1 hit on everything. Those are
my best scores (for both optionals
and compulsorles)." Matzek said.
"It was the best meet of my life."
A total of 108 points at a combi
nation meet Is necessary to qualify
directly to the national champion
ships. rather than through the
regionals. Seven performers broke
the barrier this weekend. Stan

ford's Chuck Gerardo. projected
as a possible top-five finisher,
finished three-quarters of a point
under the mark.
"I didn't have a bad meet. I just
didn't have a great meet." Gerardo
said. "Against that caliber of com
petition you have to have a great
meet to finish high."
To add Injury to Injury, sopho
more Scott Schaffer sprained both
of his big toes warming up — an
injury less humorous than it
sounds — and could perform only
in the vault, pommel horse and
parallel bars. This left only five
Cardinal gymnasts for three
events, making every score count.
Both Stanford freshmen Conrad
Voorsanger and Charles Loop
came through, recording personal
all-around bests.
