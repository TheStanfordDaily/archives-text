# Gymanasts sixth at Pac-10 meet
## 
### MARK SMOYER Staff writer 
For a program that finished
third in the nation last year, a
sixth place conference finish does
not sound very satisfying.
Then again, when the program
has been seriously hampered by
Injuries and has had to redshirt
its best performer and its top
freshman, yet still turns in a team
score better than the scoring
averages of all but five NCAA
teams, things start looking a lot
better.
So, despite their final finish in
this weekend's Pacific 10 Confer
ence Men's Invitational Cham
pionships. Stanford's gymnasts
had nothing negative to say about
their performance.
"It was our best meet of the
year." Junior Mike Matzek said.
"We proved to ourselves that we
are a really good team." Matzek
finished third overall In the all
around competition and qualified
for the this summer's U.S. Cham
pionships.
"It isn't that great to do so well
and take sixth," Chuck Gerardo
said, "but everyone on the team
was Just happy that we performed
as well as we did."
Cardinal Coach Sadao Hamada
said he had "no regrets; we did the

best that we could." With a team
score of 278.30, the squad did bet
ter than almost any team in the
country could. Unfortunately for
Stanford, most of the programs
that can do better were at the
meet.
Although the Cardinal did its
best and still lost, the Maples
Pavilion crowd was a clear winner.
With half of the 12-team field
ranked among the country's top
15, the Pac-10-plus-two competi
tion promised to highlight the
best collegiate gymnastics in the
country. It delivered.
No. 11 New Mexico pulled off the
major surprise of a meet full of
surprises, upsetting favorites No.
1 Fullerton State and No. 3 UCLA
to win the team title with 282.40
points. Fullerton was a close
second at 282.05, while the
Bruins provided the other signifi
cant surprise in the team competi
tion by finishing fifth at 279.80,
due largely to a disappointing per
formance by Tony Pineda, who
came in as the Individual favorite
and left in last place.
The subpar performances by
many of the Bruins opened the
door for unexpected Individual
leaders. In the end. California's
Bob Sundstrom and Steve


Benjamin Tong/Dally
Mike Matzek placed third at the Pac-10 Championships with a score
of 112.60 to earn a spot at the U.S. Championships.
