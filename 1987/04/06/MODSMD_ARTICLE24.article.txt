## 
### ALICIA KENT Staff writer 
A winning weekend has se
cured the Stanford men's vol
leyball team a position in the
District 8 Regional Champion
ships. Friday night at Roble
Gym, the Cardinal overpowered
Long Beach State 15-9, 12-15,
15-7, 15-12. Saturday, again in
the small confines of Roble,
Stanford shut out Cal State-
Northridge 15-10, 15-10, 15-
12.
This double winning surge
puts the Cardinal in the No. 6
position nationally, with its 8-6
Western Intercollegiate Volley
ball Association record and 18-
9 overall mark. The regional,
held at San Diego State, runs
April 23 to 25.
In addition to the excitement
of beating Long Beach in four
games after losing to the 49ers
in five games Feb. 20. the
players and crowd experienced

an atypical 10-minute delay.
Tied at eight In the second
game after both teams had
made comebacks, the lights
went out on the Stanford side
of the court, only to reveal a
police officer standing in the
doorway.
She announced that the
match would be ended If Stan
ford setter Parker Blackman's
car was not moved from the
Roble driveway. The lights were
then turned on; however, it
took almost 10 minutes for
them to warm up to full inten
sity. The delay frustrated the
players, and some even felt that
it prompted Stanford's only lost
game of the weekend.
Although the 49ers were
missing key players Alan Jane
and All Tazerounl. it was the
Cardinal, with its strong ser
ving and passing, which
dominated Friday's match. In
the first game. Stanford estab
lished the lead at 3-0 and never
allowed Long Beach to threaten.
The first point of the match came
from a hit by freshman Dan
Hanan. who posted a team-high
hitting percentage of .579.
Hanan also ended the game
with his powerful serve, which
helped the Cardinal throughout
the night. "Our serving was
tough," said senior outside hitter
Stephen Blue. "That was key.
They (Long Beach) aren't the best
passing team. With our serves,
they couldn't set up their offense."
In the second game, both teams
fought hard, with the lead con
stantly changing hands, but in
the end, it was Long Beach which
was able to run its offense and
capitalize on It."In game two, we
may have been serving the
poorest. They were able to pass up
to the net and run their offense,"
Stanford Asst. Coach Ruben
Nieves said.

However. Stanford proved Its
consistent fighting ability and
showed that a loss would not stop
the Cardinal. John McDermott
provided the firepower In game
three. McDermott — who led the
team with five block assists —
served, hit and blocked consis
tently throughout the game to put
the Cardinal ahead after losing
the first two points.
In both the third and fourth
games, the Cardinal controlled the
49ers by maintaining strong leads
throughout both games. "It was a
good match, but Stanford was
playing better," Long Beach Coach
Ray Ratelle said. "They are going
to be in good shape for the
playoffs."
Blackman, a freshman, had a
good match setting, according to
Nieves. The Cardinal's much-
Improved digging, which Black
man led with 13. and consistent
passing, helped the Stanford hit
ters to post a .370 match hitting
percentage.
Saturday's defeat of Northrldge
characterized Stanford's come
back ability. The Cardinal made
comebacks In both the second and
third games.
