# Netters split two with Hagey out
## 
### KEN STEVENS Senior staff writer 
It was a painful weekend in
more ways than one for the Stan
ford women's tennis team.
Saturday, junior Cari Hagey
became the latest Cardinal player
to go down with an Injury as she
strained ligaments in her left knee
In the first set of her singles
match against USC's Anya Koch
off. Hagey's status is uncertain
until Wednesday, when she will be
checked for possible cartilage
damage.
Stanford overcame the Injury
Saturday and went on to beat the
Trojans 6-3. thanks in large part
to a tremendous doubles effort.
Yesterday, however, in the com
pletion of a match that was
suspended Friday because of rain,
second-ranked UCLA outdid the
Cardinal iri doubles to record a 5-4
victory.
The fifth-ranked Cardinal
dropped to 13-3 on the year in
dual matches, while the Bruins

remained undefeated at 20-0.
Friday. Stanford and UCLA were
in the middle of an extremely close
match when rain swamped the
varsity courts. So too were the
Cardinal's hopes of upsetting the
highly ranked Bruins put on hold
as the team focused on traditional
rival USC.
Saturday's match was a
rematch of last May's NCAA team
championship, and it lived up to
everyone's expectations. The
Trojans got on the board first
when Hagey was forced to default
with the injury in the No. 5 singles
match.
"I was at net, and I hit a
forehand volley crosscourt, and
my body went, but my legs
stayed." Hagey explained. "My
kneecap went. I sprained a liga
ment. It was pretty scary."
Four of the other five singles
matches were through very
quickly. With USC leading 3-2. the
only singles remaining was in
court one, where Patty Fendlck
was forced to a third set for the
first time all season. The Trojans'
Maeve Quinlan was consistent, if
not spectacular, but Fendick
prevailed 6-2, 5-7, 6-4.
The momentum went back and
forth between the two teams in
the doubles matches, and eventu
ally the Cardinal and Trojans were
deadlocked as each of the three
matches was at 3-3 in the third
set. Kay Tittle and Lisa Green put
Stanford ahead by defeating Quin
lan and Mary Norwood 6-3, 1-6, 6-
3 in the No. 2 match.
Moments later, Fendick and
Stephanie Savides clinched the
match with a 3-6, 6-1, 6-3 win
against Ginny Purdy and Lupita
Novelo on court one. Senior Leigh
Anne Eldredge and sophomore
Cindy Buchsbaum — playing in
place of Hagey — completed the
doubles sweep with a 2-6, 6-1, 6-4
victory on Court Three.
Yesterday, the Cardinal found
itself in a hole before the con
tinuation of the UCLA match even
started. Hagey was on crutches in
stead of on the court, and Stan
ford was forced to default the No. 5
singles because Hagey had already
played in the match Friday.
At the outset of yesterday's play,
Stanford was as hot as the
weather. Fendick led UCLA's Jane
Thomas 6-2, 5-2 when they took
the court, and it took Fendick just
six points to finish the match.
Tittle then stepped onto court
one with the score 6-6 in her first
set tiebreaker against the Bruins'
Allyson Cooper. Tittle fought off a
set point to win the tiebreaker 10-
8 and then disposed of Cooper 6-1
in the second set to take the No. 4
singles.
The Cardinal went up 3-1 when
Savides rallied for a thrilling 1-6,
6-4, 7-6 (12-10) victory in the No.
2 singles over Joni Urban.
A critical moment in the match
came when Green's comeback at
tempt in the No. 3 singles was
thwarted by UCLA's Jennifer
Fuchs. With the score 3-3 in the

10th game of the third set, Green
hit a groundstroke that appeared
to catch the line, but Fuchs called
it out to record a 6-7, 6-3, 6-4 vic
tory.
The Bruins' Maria La Franchi
easily bested Wilson 6-2, 6-1 in the
No. 6 singles to even the match
heading into the doubles.
The No. 1 doubles match
brought out the best in Fendick
and Savides and the worst in
Fuchs and Thomas. The UCLA
pair, notorious for throwing
tantrums on the court, had as
much trouble with the most vocal
Stanford crowd of the season as
they did with Fendick and
Savides. Among its antics, the
Bruin tandem complained that
the crowd was too noisy, claimed

that Savides touched a ball that
cleared her racket by more than a
foot and, on at least one occasion,
flashed obscenities at the crowd.
The Stanford duo quieted Fuchs
and Thomas and fired up the
crowd, scoring a 6-4, 6-2 victory to
give the Cardinal a 4-3 lead.
The Bruins were making all of
the noise on the other two courts,
however. After winning the first
set, Tittle and Green lost 10
straight games to go down 4-0 in
the third set of the No. 2 doubles
against Urban and Cooper. At the
same time, Eldredge and
Buchsbaum crumbled in the third
set of the No. 3 doubles, losing 6-
2, 2-6, 6-1 to O'Meara and
LaFranchi.
