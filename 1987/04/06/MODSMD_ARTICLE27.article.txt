LOS ANGELES — From the stands of Marks Ten
nis Stadium at USC, one can see the outfield fence of
Dedeaux Field. The long 425-foot distance to center
field symbolized the prodlgous challenge the Stan
ford men's tennis team faced against the top-ranked
Trojans.
Saturday, the 20th-ranked Cardinal was only able
to reach the warning track In losing to USC, 6-3.
That was far better than the day before, however, as
Stanford struck out against No. 3 UCLA, losing 8-1.
With the losses, Stanford dropped to third place In
the Pacific 10 Southern Division and almost cer
tainly needs a win at California Wednesday to have a
chance to go to the NCAA Championships. Stanford
Is 2-2, trailing USC (6-0) and UCLA (5-1). The Bears,
after being swept in Los Angeles as well are 1-3.
Though the Cardinal, which fell to 9-7 overall,
never led against USC, it seemed on the verge of pull
ing off an upset throughout most of the match.
Stanford got in a hole quickly, trailing 3-0. Jeff
Tarango (ranked 24th) lost to sixth-ranked Trojan
Rick Leach in No. 1 singles, 6-3, 6-2, Mark Jacobson
fell to John Carras at No. 3, 6-2, 6-2, and Jeff
Cathrall was beaten by Scott Melville, 6-2, 6-1.
However, Stanford senior Scott Moody gutted out a
tough match in No. 5 singles against Swedish Import
Jonas Wallgard, winning a first-set tiebreaker 8-6,
then surviving a break point for Wallgard at 6-5 in
the second to win 7-6, 7-5.
Meanwhile, on court two, Stanford's Patrick
McEnroe — ranked third in the preseason before in
juries sidelined him for six weeks — was locked up
with the nation's second-ranked player. USC's Luke
Jensen, in a match that lasted three hours before
McEnroe finally won.
After losing the first set in a tiebreaker (7-2), Jen
sen had two break points with a 6-5 lead in set two.
On the first, McEnroe survived when he somehow
volleyed back Jensen's smash of a let ball. But Jen
sen came back with a down-the-line backhand shot
to take the set.
Jensen had the upper hand throughout most of
the third set. First, leading 2-1, Jensen had three

break points. He lost two of them, but then McEnroe
hit a shot that Jensen called long. However, the
umpire overruled Jensen's call, denying him the
break and evening the set, 2-2.
Undaunted. Jensen came back to break McEnroe
without argument, and led, 4-2. McEnroe retaliated,
however, by breaking Jensen In his next two service
games to lead, 5-4.
Fighting until the end. Jensen got two more break
points in the next game, but hit errant forehands
after long rallies in both of them, enabling McEnroe
to survive, 7-6, 5-7, 6-4, and closing the team score
to 3-2, USC.
Stanford's Geordie McKee and USC's Eric Amend,
who got a late start in No. 6 singles because the
stadium only has five courts, split the first two sets
in the now pivotal match. Receiving at the beginning
of set three, McKee nabbed the first three points and
seemed on the verge of taking control.
Amend withstood all four break attempts of that
game and six in the entire set, and defeated the Stan
ford senior, 4-6, 6-3, 6-3.
USC then only needed one win in doubles and
promptly got it when the sixth-ranked team of Leach
and Melville beat McEnroe and Tarango, 6-3, 6-2.
Carras and Wallgard beat Cathrall and Eric Peus, 6-
3, 6-7, 6-3, but Jacobson and Moody knocked off
Amend and Jensen, 7-5, 6-4, to narrow the final
score.
"We've got a real big match next week," Stanford
Coach Dick Gould said, "but I feel a little better about
going into it after today."
Unlike Saturday, Friday's match against UCLA in
blustery conditions at the Los Angeles Tennis Center
had all the drama of Once Around The Quad. Stan
ford's only victory came when McEnroe beat UCLA's
Brett Greenwood, 6-3, 6-2.
"We got a good old-fashioned butt-kicking," Gould
said. "We were worse than I expected. They were the
same as I expected."
Tarango lost to Buff Farrow, 6-2, 6-3, Jacobson fell
to Dan Nahirny, 6-1, 6-4, and McKee lost to Brian
Garrow, 6-3, 6-1.
Cathrall saw his seven-match win streak end
against Tim Trigueiro, 6-4, 6-4, and Moody lost a six
match streak of his own against Patrick Galbraith.
