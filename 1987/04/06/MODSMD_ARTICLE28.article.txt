# Card track preps, but none qualify

### ERIK STEN Editorial staff 
Almost. The word of the week
end for Stanford track.
It's almost time for the season to
swing into full gear. Beginning
with next weekend's five-way meet
at Stanford Stadium, the Cardinal
will begin an important month
long stretch of competition taking
aim at a May 2 encounter with
California.
With much of the team's train
ing pointing toward those later
meets, last weekend's Texas
Relays at Austin and Fresno
Relays at Fresno City College took
something of a back seat in the
minds of both the coaches and
athletes.
The main goal was simply to
give the athletes another chance
to compete; the secondary ob
jective, to qualify some people for

the national championships. The
first was easy accomplished, and
the second just missed.
Running In Texas. Stanford's
Charles Alexander placed eighth
In a strong 5.000-meter field with
a time of 13:59.9, a personal
record. The only disappointing
facet of the senior's Impressive
race was that he just missed the
NCAA-qualifying standard of
13:57.
Next week, however, Alexander
will have another chance. With
five top teams coming to Stanford,
the Cardinal coaching staff is
hoping that stiff competition and
a home-track advantage will help
boost the athletes to qualifying
marks.
As Stanford's distance-medley
relay, last year's meet champion,
finished a disappointing seventh.
Alexander was the top story in
Texas. In Fresno, two members of
the women's team stod out, senior
Pam Board and freshman Carol
Gray. Board placed second in both
the 400 and 100 hurdles with
marks of 59.88 and 14.4
respectively. Gray won a tactical
3,000 in 9:28.24.
Going in to the meet. Gray had
hoped to qualify, but the field's
slow pace quickly took that goal'
from reach. Gray was forced to set
tle back and look for a way to win.
She stayed with the pack and
with about 600 meters to go.
"made a move at just the perfect
time and slipped through the
field," Stanford Asst. Coach Scott

Chisam said. Gray established a
10-yard lead and. as a surprised
field didn't go after her, completed
a convincing win with a 71-second
last lap.
According to Chisam, it was the
freshman's "best collegiate track
and field race to this date," and a
good preview of the kind of slow
races run in most big meets, in
cluding the NCAAs.
For Board, the meet was just a
beginning, albeit a good one. It
was the senior's first competition
of the year, and, having beaten
her rival from UCLA, Gayle Kellon,
in the 400 hurdles, it was signifi
cant.
After 200 yards of the race.
Board was in eighth place, run
ning slow and speeding up as she
had that week in practice. At 200,
she turned it on and finished
second.
