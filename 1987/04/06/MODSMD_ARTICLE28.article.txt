# Card track preps, but none qualify

### ERIK STEN Editorial staff 
Almost. The word of the week
end for Stanford track.
It's almost time for the season to
swing into full gear. Beginning
with next weekend's five-way meet
at Stanford Stadium, the Cardinal
will begin an important month
long stretch of competition taking
aim at a May 2 encounter with
California.
With much of the team's train
ing pointing toward those later
meets, last weekend's Texas
Relays at Austin and Fresno
Relays at Fresno City College took
something of a back seat in the
minds of both the coaches and
athletes.
The main goal was simply to
give the athletes another chance
to compete; the secondary ob
jective, to qualify some people for

the national championships. The
first was easy accomplished, and
the second just missed.
Running In Texas. Stanford's
Charles Alexander placed eighth
In a strong 5.000-meter field with
a time of 13:59.9, a personal
record. The only disappointing
facet of the senior's Impressive
race was that he just missed the
NCAA-qualifying standard of
13:57.
Next week, however, Alexander
will have another chance. With
five top teams coming to Stanford,
the Cardinal coaching staff is
hoping that stiff competition and
a home-track advantage will help
boost the athletes to qualifying
marks.
As Stanford's distance-medley
relay, last year's meet champion,
finished a disappointing seventh.
