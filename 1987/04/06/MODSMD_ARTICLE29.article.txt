## 
### EVAN TUCHINSKY Staff writer 
Though most of the attention
of the gymnastics world was
focused on the men's Pacific 10
Conference Championships
held at Stanford this weekend,
the few eyes that glanced over
to Albuquerque. N.M.. were
treated to an equally exciting
and skillful display of acrobat
ics.
There, in the Land of
Enchantment, the 18th-ranked
Stanford women's gymnastics
team met New Mexico and No. 7
Nebraska, finishing third with
a score of 182.95. The Lobos
won the competition with a
186.05, followed by the
Cornhuskers' 185.95.
Despite the low finish, the
Cardinal's mark was this

season's highest away-meet
score for the squad, and raised
the team's regional qualifying
mark to 182.40. Stanford has
now officially moved up from
fifth to fourth in the West
Region, surpassing Fullerton
State.
"We had a pretty good meet,
really," Stanford Coach Homer
Sardlna said. "I think we had
the best team effort of the
season. Everyone stayed to
gether and worked together
from beginning to end. It was
nice to see."
Highlighting the squad's per
formance was a vast improve
ment on the uneven bars, the
Cardinal's Achilles' heel this
season. "The team swung bars
a lot better," Sardina said.
