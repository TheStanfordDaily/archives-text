# Senate puts amendment on ballot
## 
### MONIQUE SCHEER Senior staff writer 
ASSU senators present at a spe
cial meeting Friday voted unani
mously In favor of placing on the
spring ballot a constitutional
amendment allowing high-cost
projects to be financed by fees
levied over more than one year.
The 14 senators also voted to
place on the ballot referenda re
garding student support of the
proposed Reagan Library, develop
ment in the foothills and Univer
sity divestment from South Africa.
Currently, funds for any project
"such as building a pub or doing a
>100,000 renovation to the boat
house" must be paid by special
fees in one year. Senate Chair Jeff
Soukup said.
The proposed constitutional
amendment would permit the
ASSU to pay for expensive projects
by spreading the appropriation of
"capital fees" over several con
secutive years. The money would
not be applied toward the opera
tion of student groups. Soukup
said.
According to Soukup, since the
amendment states that the fees
cannot be rescinded once they
have been approved by two-thirds
of the student body, the ASSU
could take out a mortgage to
finance the project for which the
capital fee has been approved. The
project could then be completed
the summer after the spring elec

tion with no money coming out of
ASSU accounts until the fall, he
said.
"It (the amendment) is more fair
to the extent that those who enjoy
it are those who are paying for it."
Soukup said.
The same amendment was
placed on the spring election bal
lot two years ago, but "barely lost,"
receiving less than the required
two-thirds of the students' votes.
Soukup cited a_general lack of stu

dent confidence in the ASSU that
year as the reason for the amend
ment's failure.
Soukup said he thinks the
amendment will make it easier for
the ASSU to sell ideas for expen
sive projects to the student body,
but pointed out that because each
capital fee request requires ap
proval by two-thirds of the student
body, "it's not as if the senate can
raise money right and left."
In other business, the senate

voted to Include on the ballot a ref
erendum concerning the proposed
site of the Reagan Library.
If passed by the student body,
the referendum would stand as a
recommendation by the students
"that the Board of Trustees and
the Ronald Reagan Presidential
Foundation select an alternate
and more appropriate site for the
Ronald Reagan Presidential Li
brary, and that the site selection
process should Include appropri
ate and well-publicized opportuni
ties for significant participation
by students, faculty and other
Stanford community members."
Senator Steve Hellman, a stu
dent representative on the Board
of Trustees, spoke out against the
timing of the referendum. "This
discussion has been going on for
three years, (and) I think It's In
sulting that . . . now they (the
senators) have suddenly decided
it's a hot issue to put on the ballot.
It's an Insult to the president (of

the United States)."
A referendum that, if passed,
would call on the Univerlsty to rec
ognize the foothills on campus "as
a unique resource of tremendous
environmental and aesthetic value
to Stanford University" will also be
on the spring ballot.
Senator Scott Doerlng intro
duced the referendum and des
cribed it as a supportive measure
for the "general preservation and
using of academic land for aca
demic purposes."
Students will also be able to vote
on a referendum supporting the
proposal by Stanford Out of South
Africa for the Board of Trustees to
establish a "timeline for divest
ment from all corporations doing
business in South Africa."
