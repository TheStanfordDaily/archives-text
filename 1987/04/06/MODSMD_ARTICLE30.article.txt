disappointment behind it, the

performance of the year Friday
and Saturday at the Stanford Golf
Course. In fact, Stanford led after
the opening round, firing a 368.
Even at the end of the first day's
27 holes, Stanford trailed leader
UCLA by just seven strokes.
Dreams of keeping alive a four
year string of winning at least one
tournament disappeared Satur
day, though. USC, In second place
and seven strokes behind the
Bruins after the first day, shot a
torrid 548 over the final 27 holes
to take the team championhsip.
There was no surprise in the in
dividual competition. The college
ranks haven't seen a player of the
caliber of Arizona State's Bill
Mayfalr since Jay Randolph left
USC. Mayfalr won for the seventh
time this season and the second

time at Stanford. He also won here
In the fall.
And he didn't just win, he
dominated. After "struggling" to a
70 In the opening round. Mayfalr
posted back-to-back 3-under-par
68s to win by seven strokes over
San Jose State's John Kennaday.
Kennaday, who led after a sterling
69 In the opening round, finished
with a 71 and a 73 to card a 213.
"It was a superb performance by
Bill Mayfalr. 206 Is a fine total. It
was just a terrific effort from the
best player In college. USC shot a
great score the final day with It
really close going Into the final
round. San Jose also deserves a
lot of credit for their finish,
staying right with three of the top
teams In the country," Stanford
Coach Tim Schaaf said.
No. 11 USC finished at 1101,
eight better than No. 3 ASU and
10 ahead of SJSU and UCLA.
Stanford wound up fifth at 1122.
"It was a very encouraging
tournament. The first round was
our first low round of the year. It
was our second top-five finish of
the season, the first in a tourna
ment of this magnitude," Schaaf
said.
"The most important thing was
that this was the first time we
were In contention and felt we
were In the tournament."
