# Dolan takes individual lead

### ROBERT PORTNOY Staff writer 
Without the services of star
senior Kathleen McCarthy, the
Stanford women's golf team yes
terday shot 316 on its home
course and is in third place. Just
seven strokes off the lead, going
into today's final 36 holes of the
California Intercollegiate.
Cardinal sophomore Clare
Dolan fired a one-over-par 74 to
capture the individual lead in the
tournament by one shot over the
top collegiate player in the
country, Laurette Maritz of U.S.
International. Maritz is certain to
be a first-team All-America selec
tion for the fourth consecutive
season.
San Jose State, which will host
today's final 36 holes at the
Villages Golf Course, leads the In
tercollegiate with a 309 total, five
strokes ahead of second-place
USC. San Jose has three players
among the top eight individuals,
with Julie Ralls at 76 and Dana
Lofland and Lisa Ipkendanz at 77.
In determining a team's score
for any round, the low four scores

of the day are totaled and the fifth
Is thrown out. With McCarthy in
bed with the flu, the other four
Cardinal women were under ex
treme pressure to score well.
Though Dolan's round is what
placed Stanford in contention for
the team title, it was Trish
McGonigle's gritty performance on
the back nine that kept those
hopes alive.
"We had a good round consider
ing we only had four scores to go
with today. I was especially
pleased with Trish McGonigle.
She started seven-over-par with a
43 on the front nine, and brought
it back by going even par for a 37
on the back nine," Stanford Coach
Tim Baldwin said.
SJSU, USC and Stanford will be
the primary pursuants of the team
championship. The closest com
petitor to the lead group is San
Diego State at 324, eight strokes
behind the Cardinal. It will be es
pecially tough, however, to catch
SJSU on its own stomping
grounds.
"It was good for the girls to have
to do their thing without Kathleen
today," Baldwin said.
"Hopefully we'll have her in the
lineup [today]. Villages is a good
course, but it's a lot less severe
than Stanford,
