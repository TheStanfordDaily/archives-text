This is the Jirst in a weeklong series of articles on
the issues and candidates that will appear on the
ASSU spring election ballot.

Encouraged by the recent upswing in volunteer
work by Stanford students, an alliance of student
groups headed by the ASSU Senate has sponsored a
general fee proposal for >80,000 to fund community
service activities.

5j ASSU Elections
1987

This is the first year that students have had an op
portunity to vote on a general fee. Unlike special fees,
general fees are renewed automatically in subse
quent years â€” no new approval by voters is neces
sary. A constitutional amendment passed last spring

enables students to propose general fees and to
change their size on an annual basis by percentages
specified on the elections ballot.
If passed by the required two-thirds of the voters,
the fee will cost students approximately *2 a quarter,
said COP member Carey White.
Historically, the senate has determined general
fees Internally, White said. Unlike special fees, which
go to a specific organization, general fees are given to
the Program Board to distribute to students. This
process ensures that "fringe groups" can obtain
funding even If they don't have the support of the
majority of the student body. White said.
A general fee also eliminates the administrative
difficulty of having "hundreds of special fee
proposals on a ballot," White said.
Currently, the Program Board, the primary fund
ing apparatus for student organizations, will only
fund groups that make special contributions to the
campus or directly benefit Stanford students. Pro
gram Board Director Robin Miller said.
