## 
### TOM OSCHERWITZ Staff writer 
This is the Jirst in a weeklong series of articles on
the issues and candidates that will appear on the
ASSU spring election ballot.

Encouraged by the recent upswing in volunteer
work by Stanford students, an alliance of student
groups headed by the ASSU Senate has sponsored a
general fee proposal for >80,000 to fund community
service activities.

This is the first year that students have had an op
portunity to vote on a general fee. Unlike special fees,
general fees are renewed automatically in subse
quent years — no new approval by voters is neces
sary. A constitutional amendment passed last spring

enables students to propose general fees and to
change their size on an annual basis by percentages
specified on the elections ballot.
If passed by the required two-thirds of the voters,
the fee will cost students approximately *2 a quarter,
said COP member Carey White.
Historically, the senate has determined general
fees Internally, White said. Unlike special fees, which
go to a specific organization, general fees are given to
the Program Board to distribute to students. This
process ensures that "fringe groups" can obtain
funding even If they don't have the support of the
majority of the student body. White said.
A general fee also eliminates the administrative
difficulty of having "hundreds of special fee
proposals on a ballot," White said.
Currently, the Program Board, the primary fund
ing apparatus for student organizations, will only
fund groups that make special contributions to the
campus or directly benefit Stanford students. Pro
gram Board Director Robin Miller said.
According to ASSU Senator
Felix Cuevas, a sponsor of the pro
posal. the current structure of the
board prevents It from fulfilling
the community service Interests of
the students.
Student community service or
ganizations have a tremendous
need for financing. Cuevas said. A
survey sent out this year revealed
that student groups need
♦ 100,000 to operate their service

projects.
While the Charity Carnival, a
party for children In East Palo Alto
run by the Student Volunteer Net
work, cannot currently be funded
by the Program Board, the com
munity service fund could finance
It, Cuevas said.
If a tutoring program needed
books, color crayons and art
supplies for Its students, the fund
could supply the resources,
Cuevas added.
The fund Is meant to
"encourage Stanford students to
be involved In community service
by providing them a reliable fund

ing source," Cuevas said.
However, he added that. "The
fund Is only for projects Initiated
and run by Stanford students." It
does not include donations.
Cuevas said.
Although the fund is up for a
vote, the details of its operation
have not yet been worked out. It is
not clear yet whether the fund will
"prioritize the local area,
nationwide service or worldwide
service," Cuevas said.
According to Miller, if the pro
posal is approved it will double the
financial resources of the board.

Miller said that the additional
money will not put too much
power In the hands of the Program
Board. With the additional money,
"there will be less reason for the
board to say no to an organiza
tion." Miller said.
To ensure proper administra
tion of the fund, sponsors of the
bill have recommended that at
least two members of future Pro
gram Boards must have commu
nity service experience.
The bill has a broad range of
sponsors, ranging from the Stan
ford Volunteer Network to Stan
ford Students for Deaf Awareness.
