# 'Voices for change'
## Gender roles scrutinized 
### GEOFF SANBORN Senior staff writer 
At a conference on Friday night, Shepherd Bliss
and Susan Griffin both addressed the "damage that
has been done" to men and women by socletally
Imposed gender roles, but they took strikingly differ
ent approaches.
Bliss, a professor of psychology at JFK University
in Orinda. and Griffin, author of "Pornography and
Silence." delivered the keynote addresses at the
weekend's conference on "Women and Men: Voices
for Change."
Bliss's speech was a physical performance, backed
by the drumbeat of a stage assistant, while Griffin
took a more cerebral tack, reviewing the gender
related themes of her last two books and a work in
progress.
The conference, sponsored by the Rape Education
Project, continued with performances and meetings
Saturday and Sunday.
Bliss is an activist in the new Men's Movement,
which he said is still In the "bra-burning stage" of de
velopment. He spent his time on stage alternating
between descriptions of the damage that has been
done to men by the masculine gender role, and
boyish interludes in which he butted heads with his

assistant and attempted to "fly" across the stage.
"We (In the Men's Movement) urge men to recall
their positive male ancestry," he said. "As men left
the farm and home for the city and factory, they lost
something. Our goal Is to restore the male commu
nity In its original, positive form."
Bliss cited circumcision, military induction and
AIDS as examples of the kind of pain that is specific
to males, and is partially responsible for the shorter
life expectancy and higher rate of alcoholism among
men.
"There is something hazardous about the male sex
role that needs to be changed if men are to survive,"
he said.
Griffin agreed with Bliss's concern about the
dangers of the masculine sex role, but emphasized
that "both men and women are brutalized by this
masculinity."
She discussed her work on rape, pornography and
war as it relates to men's objectification of women
and their unnatural divorcement from their more
"feminine" characteristics.
Men remove themselves from their vulnerable,
sensitive, caring qualities by projecting those
qualities on to women, she said. This is both a great
