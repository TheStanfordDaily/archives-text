Mulroney suggests summit meeting
OTTAWA — Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney raised
the stakes In the U.S.-Canadian dispute over acid rain by propos
ing in a meeting with President Reagan yesterday that the two
countries sign a treaty that would reduce the air pollution that
causes it by 50 percent by 1994.
Mulroney's suggestion came in the first of a series of meetings
between the two leaders, each of whom is facing the most pressing
political trials of his tenure at home. It was Reagan's first trip out
of the United States since the Iran-contra affair came to light.
The Canadians had sought from the United States a bilateral
agreement — a less formal accord than a treaty — to reduce sulfur
dioxide emissions, which are the principal cause of acid rain. But
Washington has resisted on grounds that greater study was ne
cessary.
Canada claims that acid rain, 50 percent of which comes from
U.S. industry along the border, has killed 14,000 Canadian lakes
and waterways. The government here has adopted legislation re
quiring a 50 percent reduction in Canadian emissions by 1994.
"The prime minister asked the president to consider the admin
istration and Congress moving together and joining the Canadian
government and Parliament in a non-partisan manner to sign a
treaty," a U.S. official said.
Thatcher tough on Gorbachev
MOSCOW — Having long considered Western Europe part of the
solution to its difficulties in dealing with the Reagan administra
tion, the Soviet Union now appears to believe that European
leaders like British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher are part of
the problem.
So inflexible was Thatcher on key arms-control issues during
her five-day visit here last week that the Soviets were left looking
toward the April 13 arrival of U.S. Secretary of State George Shultz
for a possible "soft line" on Intermediate-range nuclear forces
(INF) in Europe.
A virtual love feast on both sides, Thatcher's tour ended with
her and Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev's declaring mutual trust
and liking for each other.
But aside from the atmospherics of friendship that enhanced
the domestic positions of both, said Soviet officials, Gorbachev
ran into a stone wall.
The Soviets claimed to be astounded that Thatcher argued
publicly against Gorbachev's proclaimed long-term goail of a world
without nuclear weapons. Describing such a world as a "dream,"
and saying she spoke for other Western European leaders,
Thatcher said it would be "less stable and more dangerous for all
of us."
Gorbachev delays trip to Prague
PRAGUE, Czechoslovakia — A planned visit here by Soviet
leader Mikhail Gorbachev, expected to begin today, will not take
place until later in the week because Gorbachev has "a slight
cold," Czechoslovak officials said yesterday.
The officials indicated that the decision to postpone the trip had
been made this weekend, on the eve of the Soviet leader's planned
arrival for a scheduled three-day stay.
They said Gorbachev would now arrive "in the second half of the
week" but refused to specify the day.
The sudden shift appeared to come as a surprise and embar
rassment to the Czechoslovak communist leadership, which
decorated Prague with banners and flags and accredited some 300
foreign journalists at a special press center in anticipation of Gor
bachev's arrival today.
Hungary's economic reforms
BUDAPEST, Hungary — A crush of shoppers navigate carts past
counters piled high with sausages in the food department of the
Skala co-operative store here. Buyers cluster around bins of fresh
vegetables abundant even in the depths of winter. Some grind up
their own custom-mixed coffee beans while listening to the sooth
ing tones of piped-in pop.
The scene at Skala on a typical day is revealing when compared
with that of a food store in Romania, Hungary's East European
neighbor.
There, the dirty, dimly lighted stores operated by the state are
often devoid of meat and vegetables other than withered carrots
and turnips. Coffee is unheard of. Some shops, in fact, offer only
bones — but are nevertheless besieged by block-long lines of des
perate customers.
The shopping-market gap between these two Soviet allies,
largely non-existent 30 years ago, provides a quick sense of the po
tential significance of economic reform in the communist-ruled
world.
Soviets admit to trouble in space
MOSCOW — The Soviet Union reported yesterday that It was
unable to dock its first space laboratory with its orbiting Mir sta
tion because of a failure in the lab's control system.
The research module, called Kvant, came to within 200 meters
(about 218 yards) of docking ports on the manned space station,
the official Tass news agency said.
But the approach was aborted during the final stage of the dock
ing "owing to an irregular function of the control system of the
astrophysical laboratory Kvant," Tass said.
The terse, three-paragraph report was one of the few times in
recent years that the Soviet Union has acknowledged a setback in
its space program.
"At present, telemetric data are being analyzed," Tass quoted
the mission control center as saying. "A decision on further work
with the module will be taken on the strength of results of the
analysis."
The 11-ton Kvant, loaded with 1.5 metric tons of scientific in
struments. was launched last Tuesday and apparently its flight
went according to plan until the very last moments.
Biden: Wrapped up in campaign
WASHINGTON — On the afternoon of Feb. 4. the Senate
Judiciary Committee held its first oversight hearing on federal
anti-trust policy, a subject that Chairman Joseph Biden. D-Del,,
has targeted as one of his top priorities.
Biden never made it to the hearing. While the Justice Depart
ment's antitrust chief was testifying, the senator was meeting
with his political advisers and giving an interview to a political col
umnist about his plans to run for president.
Three months after taking the helm of the committee. Biden's
undeclared quest for the 1988 Democratic presidential
tlon has rendered him a part-time chairman.
He is generally in town three days a week, often leaving
Thursday night for campaigning in lowa or New Hampshire and
not returning to Washington until Tuesday morning.
The 44-year-old senator, who has always stressed his backstage
role in brokering compromises, says the decentralized system
shows "my ability to delegate and get things done. I've been get
ting a lot of help from my colleagues. ... I don't care a lot whether
It's me or my name on It."
