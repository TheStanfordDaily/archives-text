WASHINGTON — The scene reeked of an
espionage scandal: a young Marine guard at
the U.S. Embassy in Moscow and his lover
Galia. a buxom Soviet employee at the em
bassy, caught in the most compromising of sit
uations in an American diplomat's private
apartment.
When it happened late last summer, U.S.
punishment was swift. Sgt. Arnold Bracy. who
seven months later would be arrested in a KGB
sex-for-secrets operation that has devastated
American interests in Moscow, was busted last
Aug. 21 to the rank of corporal.
Then he was put back on duty, guarding the
most sensitive diplomatic outpost in the
world.
By ignoring the security risk in the Bracy
case, officials at the embassy and in Washing
ton probably gave the KGB seven extra months
of unmolested spying on the embassy. Ameri
can intelligence experts said last week.
Several said that the Marine spy case under
scores a basic and unremedied defect in Amer
ican counterintelligence and security policies:
a complacent attitude toward espionage that

has led to fatal lapses in a long string of U.S.
spying disasters.
"What it points to is much broader — a fun
damental management breakdown in hand
ling security across the board." said a federal
law enforcement source heavily involved in se
curity matters.
"Don't mistake this. It's not a failure of tech
nical systems. It's a breakdown of people and
management."
"The biggest mistake we'll make — and we're
going to make it — is to come down on the
Marines and stop there," a veteran congres
sional intelligence expert said. "What we really
need to do is to change something that's vir
tually Impossible to change: a mindset."
In interviews last week, those and other in
telligence officials bitterly criticized the State
Department and the former U.S. ambassador
to the Soviet Union, Arthur Hartman, for what
they called unforgivable blunders in securing
the Moscow embassy against the KGB.
More than the Marines, they argued, the
American diplomatic establishment is to
blame for overlooking a spy ring that appar

ently wiped out U.S. intelligence operations in
the Soviet Union and gave the Kremlin months
of top-secret cables between the embassy and
Washington.
One expert disagreed. Former CIA director
William Colby said that the department "has
taken its security responsibilities seriously."
and suggested that better overall supervision
of the Marine guards might have prevented
espionage losses.
All granted, however, that the State Depart
ment is far from alone in falling to address the
espionage threat effectively. American com
placency has been central to every recent U.S.
spying loss, from the John Walker Navy spy
ring, which lasted 17 years, to the Jonathan
Pollard, Larry Chin, Ronald Pelton and Edward
Lee Howard cases of 1985 and 1986.
Embassy officials are now said to have
ignored several warning signs in the spy case,
including disregarding alarms that Soviet
KGB agents tripped as they wandered through
the embassy at night in 1986, planting listen
ing devices and photographing documents.
