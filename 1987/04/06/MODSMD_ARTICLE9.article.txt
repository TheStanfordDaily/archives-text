# Study favors exercise over diet

Exercising seems to be a more effective
way of losing weight and preventing heart
disease than dieting, according to a Stanford
Medical Center study.
The study analyzed the effect of different
weight loss methods on hepatic lipase and
lipoprotein lipase *â€” two enzymes that are
believed to have an effect on cholesterol levels
in the body.
Marcia Stefanick, project director of the
Stanford Weight Control Project, said men in
a test group that lost weight by exercising
had higher levels of lipoprotein lipase and
lower levels of hepatic lipase than men who
lost about the same amount of weight by
dieting.
Lipoprotein lipase is associated with a
lower risk of heart attack, while hepatic
lipase is associated with a higher risk.
Peter Wood, the study's principal inves
tigator, called the study "fairly unique" in its
attempt to distinguish the effects of weight
loss due to dieting from the effects of weight
loss due to exercise. Most previous studies
have examined the combined effects of diet

and exercise, he said.
To properly Isolate the pure effects of exer
cise, the caloric Intake of the exercisers was
held constant at prestudy levels. Wood said
this was "quite challenging to manage," be
cause exercise stimulated the appetites of
some of the test subjects, and others wanted
to diet to enhance their weight loss.
Men were divided Into three groups: a con
trol group, a group that did not change
eating habits but started an exercise pro
gram and a group that didn't exercise but
reduced food intake by about 300 calories a
day.
At the end of the first year, the exercisers
lost an average of only 10 pounds, compared
to the dieters' average loss of 16 pounds.
Also, both groups had lower levels of hepatic
lipase in their blood than the control group.
Significant differences began to emerge in
the second year, during which the men were
encouraged to maintain their weight loss on
their own. Exercisers tended to continue ex
ercising on their own, and maintained their
weight loss, while the dieters gained back
about half the weight they had lost. At the
end of two years, the two groups were ap

proximately equivalent In the amount of
weight lost since the beginning of the study.
The exercisers, however, had much health
ier heart attack risk profiles. Dieters' hepatic
lipase levels Increased as they gained weight
back. Also, lipoprotein lipase was signifi
cantly higher in the exercisers than in the
dieters.
The two lipases are believed to have oppo
site effects on cholesterol. High levels of
hepatic lipase are associated with low
density lipoprotein (LDL), the type of choles
terol linked to heart disease. Lipoprotein
lipase, however, is associated with high
density lipoprotein (HDL), believed to help
prevent heart disease. Hepatic lipase is
negatively associated with HDL.
At the end of two years, the exercisers in
the study had HDL levels higher than the
dieters. Stefanick asserted that this result
supports the hypothesis that losing weight
by exercise is more beneficial than losing it
by dieting.
The Stanford researchers will continue to
follow the program participants through the
third year, but they are also beginning an
other weight loss study.
