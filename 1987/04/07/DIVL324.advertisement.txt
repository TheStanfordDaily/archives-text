Dear Stanford students,
There's something you can do for a
short time each day that will improve ev

future career, your relationships, every
thing — all at the same time. What's
more, it's easy to do. Over 1,000,000 stu

You can learn about it at a special
free lecture on the Transcendental Medi
tation technique, and regardless of what
you've already heard about TM, this en
tertaining talk will surprise and enlighten
you. More than that, it may well change
your life.
At the lecture, you'll learn how the
simple, natural TM technique, which is
practiced for 15-20 minutes twice a day,
brings profound benefits to mind and body,
and how these benefits automatically im
prove one's social behavior, sehool and
job performance, and much more.
"TM relaxes me so much —
I feel more alert and awake
with less hours of sleep than I
had before TM. I haven't been
getting headaches lately, where
before I used to have splitting
headaches at least once a week."
— Cyndi Holtz, Stanford senior,

of scientific research that's been done on

the past 15 years). And you'll learn that
a lot of the research findings are directly
relevant to your personal and academic
development as a student. Here is a par
tial list of the research results in the field
