# CIR recommends using persuasion
## 
### MARK LAWRENCE Senior staff writer 
The Committee on Investment
Responsibility last week voted to
recommend that the Board of
Trustees urge two companies in
Stanford's Investment portfolio to
withdraw from South Africa.
In a report to the trustee com
mittee that decides investment
policy, the CIR said Stanford
should use upcoming stockholder
resolutions to encourage Good
year Corp. and NCR Corp. to dis
continue their operations in
South Africa because they have
not encouraged racial equality
there.
The trustee committee, the Spe
cial Committee on Investment Re
sponsibility, considered the ClR's
recommendations in a telephone
conference on Friday. The trus
tees' decision will be made public
today.
The stockholder resolutions are
two of about 50 the CIR will con
sider between last week and the
end of the school year, according
to CIR Chairman Frederick Hlllier,
professor of operations research.
Hillier said spring is tradition
ally the season for stockholder
resolutions, but this year is par
ticularly busy because stockhold
ers have raised concerns about
corporate involvement in South
Africa.
At its meeting tomorrow, the
CIR will consider about eight more
resolutions concerning South
Africa.
The CIR said in its report of the
March 30 meeting that neither
Goodyear nor NCR contributes
products or services of "strategic

importance" to the South African
government. But, the CIR said,
the companies have not been ac
tive in opposing South African
employment policies or in promot
ing racial equality in that country.
The report said Goodyear has
refused to adopt any anti
apartheid policies that would vio
late South African laws. The com
mittee also said Goodyear refused
to stop sales to the South African
military and police after a 1986
shareholder resolution called for
the company to cut off such sales.
Goodyear subsequently stopped
sales to the military and police in
response to changed South
African laws, not because of a
change of policy, according to the
CIR.
Between 1982 and 1986,
Goodyear averaged a Sullivan
rating of 2.07, on a scale of one to
three with one being the best. The
Sullivan Principles are a set of
guidelines for corporate activity in
South Africa designed to promote
racial equality in the workplace.
The CIR report criticized NCR
for employing only 82 blacks out
of a total of 509 employees in
South Africa. The report also said
NCR has not provided the CIR
with concrete Information about
the company's anti-apartheid ac
tivities in South Africa.
Between 1982 and 1986, NCR
averaged a 2.4 Sullivan rating.
The CIR also decided last week
to recommend that the trustees
abstain on a stockholder resolu
tion sponsored by American Tele
phone and Telegraph concerning
one of the company's interests,
Olivetti. AT&T owns 22.3 percent
of the Italian company.
The CIR said in the report that
It was impossible to evaluate
Olivetti's presence In South Africa
because too little information Is
available on the company's opera
tions there.
Hllller said the CIR goes
through a four-step process in
reviewing companies' perfor
mance In South Africa.
First, the CIR examines a com
pany's recent Sullivan ratings.
The committee then decides
whether a company's products are
of strategic importance in rein
forcing apartheid, Hillier said.
Third, the CIR looks at any other
factors relevant to a company's
presence in South Africa, he said.
