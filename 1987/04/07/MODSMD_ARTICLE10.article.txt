# 900-foot Don said 'Get a job'
## 
### 
I slept fitfully last night — tos
sing and turning and throwing
my covers on the floor. It must
have been around 3 a.m. when I
suddenly became completely
awake. Someone or something
was in my room. I could feel its
presence and could almost hear it
breathing. With shivers running
up and down my spine, I opened
my eyes.

A 900-foot tall Donald Kennedy
towered at the foot of my bed. Ac
tually, he wasn't really towering;
he had to stoop quite a bit to avoid
hitting his head on the ceiling. He
was wearing running shorts. Oh, I
know you're thinking that I had
one too many beers or had been
playing with herbs again, but I'll
swear on a stack of Dailys that
this story is true.
He spoke to me, his voice
booming through my tiny room.
"Kristen," he said.
"What?"
He took a deep breath, and I

shuddered. I knew what was to
come would be terribly important.
"Kristen," he repeated, "get a
job."
I gasped. As I began to stammer.
"But Don . . ."he was already dis
solving into an early morning
mist. I watched with wide-eyed
wonder until all that was left of
him was his smile. "Get a job," his
smile said, and then it too disap
peared — leaving a fine coating of
dust on my furniture. Try as I
might, I could not get back to
sleep. What a horrible prediction
of doom! Must I really leave the
Farm and (gulp) get a job?
Somewhere along the line,
someone lied to me. It was a nasty,
corrosive little lie, one that I based
four years of my life on. The lie
went something like this: You're
going to Stanford? Well, you've got
it made. You'll never have to do
anything else and your name will
be up in big, colored lights. People
will pay just to talk to you. And so
on. I fell for it — hook, line and
sinker.
It's appropriate, at this time of
year, when high school seniors
camp out by their mailboxes, to
recall the thrill of getting into col
lege. Come on, you remember. I
counted the days until April 15th;
I went to the mailbox all aquiver

for two weeks straight. Infurlat
ingly, the mail service in my home
hamlet in Maine is (shall we be
polite) slow. I didn't have a snow
ball's chance In hell of seeing any
letter until April 20th, at least.
Still, I rushed down the driveway
every day and held my breath as
the hinged door creaked open.
Would it be a thick envelope or a
thin one? Would I be accepted —
thus assuring that my future
would hold fame and fortune?
When it finally arrived, the letter
was not too thick, not too thin. It
was just right. My life was set.
Once again, I'm waiting for
thick or thin envelopes. I laser
print my life on an 8-by-12 piece of
paper, fold myself up and mail me
away. I'm "on file" all over Califor
nia. The envelopes I receive are
pitifully thin; the pile of letters on
my floor is only a millimeter high.
I have a friend who has taught me
to read between the lines. Several
letters told me that they didn't
have any positions open that
matched my qualifications.
Translation: We don't even want
you to sweep our floors. Some
companies even thanked me for
sending them my resume. I have a
sneaking suspicion that they use
them to start fires or line canary
cages.

So I've tried the letter routine,
and I've tried networking. (The
only people I know do sweep the
floors, but they're still a connec
tion.) It's time to get tough. As
graduation approaches, and my
mother and the bank begin to
worry about the word
"unemployed," I'm willing to try
desperation tactics. Don Kennedy
appeared to me again, you know.
Yes, indeed. We talked about all
sorts of things, but no matter how
I begged and pleaded, he refused
to let me stay on the Farm. In fact,
he threatened me. If I don't find a
job by the end of June, he's calling
me home. Yes, friends, we are sin
ners in the hands of an angry god.
I'm going to lock myself on the
sundeck and stay there until I get
my job. I know I have your support
in this, and that you will help in
any way that you can. Please don't
let Don take me home. There's a
waitresslng job waiting for me in
Maine, and my mother wants me
to paint the house. I appeal to
your hearts and to your pocket
books. I need a job. My time here
can't be over, can It?

shuddered. I knew what was to
come would be terribly important.
"Kristen," he repeated, "get a
job."
I gasped. As I began to stammer.
"But Don . . ."he was already dis
solving into an early morning
mist. I watched with wide-eyed
wonder until all that was left of
him was his smile. "Get a job," his
smile said, and then it too disap
peared — leaving a fine coating of
dust on my furniture. Try as I
might, I could not get back to
sleep. What a horrible prediction
of doom! Must I really leave the
Farm and (gulp) get a job?
Somewhere along the line,
someone lied to me. It was a nasty,
corrosive little lie, one that I based
four years of my life on. The lie
went something like this: You're
going to Stanford? Well, you've got
it made. You'll never have to do
anything else and your name will
be up in big, colored lights. People
will pay just to talk to you. And so
on. I fell for it — hook, line and
sinker.
It's appropriate, at this time of
year, when high school seniors
camp out by their mailboxes, to
recall the thrill of getting into col
lege. Come on, you remember. I
counted the days until April 15th;
I went to the mailbox all aquiver

for two weeks straight. Infurlat
ingly, the mail service in my home
hamlet in Maine is (shall we be
polite) slow. I didn't have a snow
ball's chance In hell of seeing any
letter until April 20th, at least.
Still, I rushed down the driveway
every day and held my breath as
the hinged door creaked open.
Would it be a thick envelope or a
thin one? Would I be accepted —
thus assuring that my future
would hold fame and fortune?
When it finally arrived, the letter
was not too thick, not too thin. It
was just right. My life was set.
Once again, I'm waiting for
thick or thin envelopes. I laser
print my life on an 8-by-12 piece of
paper, fold myself up and mail me
away. I'm "on file" all over Califor
nia. The envelopes I receive are
pitifully thin; the pile of letters on
my floor is only a millimeter high.
I have a friend who has taught me
to read between the lines. Several
letters told me that they didn't
have any positions open that
matched my qualifications.
Translation: We don't even want
you to sweep our floors. Some
companies even thanked me for
sending them my resume. I have a
sneaking suspicion that they use
them to start fires or line canary
cages.

So I've tried the letter routine,
and I've tried networking. (The
only people I know do sweep the
floors, but they're still a connec
tion.) It's time to get tough. As
graduation approaches, and my
mother and the bank begin to
worry about the word
"unemployed," I'm willing to try
desperation tactics. Don Kennedy
appeared to me again, you know.
Yes, indeed. We talked about all
sorts of things, but no matter how
I begged and pleaded, he refused
to let me stay on the Farm. In fact,
he threatened me. If I don't find a
job by the end of June, he's calling
me home. Yes, friends, we are sin
ners in the hands of an angry god.
I'm going to lock myself on the
sundeck and stay there until I get
my job. I know I have your support
in this, and that you will help in
any way that you can. Please don't
let Don take me home. There's a
waitresslng job waiting for me in
Maine, and my mother wants me
to paint the house. I appeal to
your hearts and to your pocket
books. I need a job. My time here
can't be over, can It?
