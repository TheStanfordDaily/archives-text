# Committee system is faulty
## 
### 
Ever been on a University committee? Well,
it's not a pleasant experience. Let me tell you a
story.
Halfway through my sophomore year, I
bought a beat-up old van. That year I got six
parking tickets. The first one came on the very
day that I coaxed the "war pig." as I called it,
into the parking lot of Lagunita. I ran inside to
tell my friends about my purchase and when I
came out moments later there was a little yel
low ticket that read, "Bail *11." I figured the
cop (if I may use that term for a Stanford
policeman) had to have been hiding in the
bushes nearby to get it there so quickly. I
guess I should have known right then what I
was up against.

But I was young and cocky. So the next day I
went out to the pig and put the first ticket
right back under the windshield wiper. They'll
never give me two. I figured. When I came back
from class there were two yellow slips gently
flapping in the breeze. My confidence was
shaken. 1 hopped on my bike (since I wouldn't
have money to buy gas for the pig after I paid
the two tickets) and rode to the Police Depart
ment to buy my Dormitory West parking per
mit. 1 hung the little hanger proudly from my
rear-view mirror.
Two weeks later, when 1 finally had enough
money to put the van back on the road again, I
was approached by a friend.
"Can 1 bum a ride to the Bookstore?"
"What? It's only 200 yards from here."
"I know. But I had a Calc midterm today."
"OK. let's go."
I parked behind Betas in a C parking lot. We
went inside the bookstore and my friend spent
15 minutes looking for the pencil section.
When we came out 20 minutes later, sure
enough, there was another damned little yel
low piece of paper. "Wrong lot" was checked.
Ticket number four came when my hanger
accidentally fell from the rear view mirror as I
weaved down Palm Drive — 1 didn't notice it
had fallen for two days. I found tickets number
five and six on my windshield when I discov
ered that the Lagunita parking lot actually has
several poorly marked C spaces hidden among
the Dormitory West spaces.
All these tickets and all that money weren't
in vain, however. The first thing that I've
learned Is not to move my vehicle. I go
everywhere on my bike now. How well does this

work? Well, this year I've only gotten two
parking tickets so far. And I only got them be
cause the damned suction cup sticker kept
falling down from my rear window. But I duct
taped it to the window now, so it won't go
anywhere. It works really well; however, if I do
decide to go driving there is the problem of the
tape covering most of the back window. Better
to be a safety hazard than broke, I guess.
The second thing I've gotten is peace of
mind. The money I've paid for parking stickers
is going to good causes, like the Marguerite. I
tried using the Marguerite for a while, but
when I rode it I got too lonely. It also took me
about half the time to ride my bike to the same
places. Anyway, though, I'm sure there are
people out there who do use the Marguerite,
and I sure am glad my money helps them get
where they're going.
The last thing I got out of It is the impetus to
change the parking situation. I decided to do
something about this mess. So I joined the
University Committee on Parking and Trans
portation — the one that runs the whole
parking show.
The Nominations Commission, the bureau
of the ASSU responsible for filling the student
positions on the many University committees
and councils, was the one that chose me. The
committees it fills include the following (as
random examples): Committee on Libraries,
Committee on Undergrad Admissions and Fin
ancial Aid, Committee on Athletics and even
the subcommittee on Bicycle Safety. Practi
cally every aspect of life at Stanford, in other
words.
Anyway, I attended one parking meeting,
then decided to stop out of school for a quarter
(for reasons only remotely related to my
parking tickets). I later learned that the Nom
Com never replaced me on the committee, even
though I had Informed them I was stopping
out. The other student on the committee. I
heard, changed addresses and never showed
up at any meetings. So for a whole year, the
students went unrepresented on a committee
that needs — nay. demands — student repre
sentation.
Poor attendance by students on committees
is only one problem of the University commit
tee system, however. Here's an incomplete list:
□ Students on committees tend to be a sig
nificant minority. Usually there's only one or
two representatives of the student body on any
given committee.
□ Students tend to know very little about
the issues. Most of the University officials have
been on the committees for many years and
know the situation and its history inside out.
Students often walk Into many important is
sues In mid-stride and leave In mid-stride
since a term of office Is only one academic year.

They spend much of that year learning what's
going on, In most cases.
□ Students are cut loose from any support
or Information structure. The Nom Com picks
committee members and then says "goodbye."
While most of the University administrators on
the various committees are representatives of
their various departments, the students on
committees hardly tend to be representatives
of the student body — even if they truly want to
be.
What all this means Is that having students
on the various committees Is less valuable to
our Interests than it could be. This is the
ASSU's fault, and It has several frightening
ramifications:
□ When an important issue arises, the
ASSU often finds out about It late In the game.
The student committee members aren't at
fault since they are never informed that they
should report to anyone about what goes on —
there's no one for them to report to. Valuable
time is wasted.
□ The students on the committees, for the
most part, don't truly represent the students.
They represent themselves. They get their in
formation about the matters at hand from the
committee and they make decisions without
knowing what the general student body wants.
Now this isn't the student committee mem
bers faults, as I've said. Neither is It the Univer
sity administration's fault — they've given us
the chance to represent ourselves. It's the
ASSU's fault for not taking a more active role
in supporting student committee members.
Now. as usual. I have a solution to this mess:
transform Nom Com from a once-a-year com
mission into a full-blown organization. It
should:
□ Inform new committee members about
the history of issues their committee will be
dealing with and how they affect the students.
This will maintain continuity of student inter
ests.
□ Collect regular reports from committee
members and make reports to the senate and
COP based on these. This will help keep the
ASSU briefed on how they can represent us
best.
□ Meet regularly with committee members
to discuss what is In the students' best inter
ests and how to lobby for that in their
respective committees. Naturally, this will
unite the students into one powerful voice
rather than many weak voices.
Maybe if this happens, we'll find that a lot of
the annoyances that we have on campus — like
10 zillion different parking permits — are
eliminated.
