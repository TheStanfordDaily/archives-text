student sex
complicated
Mr. Bethell, I am amused by
your naive concept about the
causes of sexual activity, but I am
quite offended by your attempt to
impose your values on those of us
who believe differently.
First, you make the false as
sumption that students will be
enticed into sexual activity by the
accessibility of condoms. Clearly,
you fail to understand that the
decision to or not to become
sexually active is extremely com
plex.
Students simply do not choose
to engage in sex because they can
obtain contraceptives at Cowell
instead of having to go to a Uni
versity Avenue drugstore. Such a
decision is based on upbringing,
morality, religion, love, desire,
etc., but not on the proximity of
the nearest condom, or the clever
ness of a trite slogan, "Just Say
No".
You are correct that sex in
volves questions of morals, but
not necessarily your morals, nor
those of Christianity. A university
such as Stanford has an obliga
tion to encourage students to lead
a virtuous lifestyle according to
their own values without oppres
sion by those who believe differ
ently.
Contrary to what you may
believe, non-Christians also have
a sense of morality. Furthermore,
religious freedom and diversity
still exist in America, and no one,
including Hoover scholars, has
the right to impose their morality
on others. Values are a personal
issue, Mr. Bethell.
With regard to your judgement
of homosexuals and "unnatural
sex," I am astonished that you
have the ability to truly and uni

versally define what is and is not
natural. (Obviously the result of
profound philosophical medita
tion.) I am also amazed that you
have such clear insight into the
souls of these people. I assume
your observation of these "fires of
lust" results from extensive inter
action with, and careful psycho
logical study of, homosexuals,
and not mere prejudice. That is
correct, isn't it?

Marx's critics
aren't always
conservatives
Professor John Manley argues
(Daily, April 2) that, since the
Hoover Institution has a "formal
charge to expose the ends of the
doctrines of Marx," it must be a
"conservative" institution. But
this is fallacious.
Without a clear distinction
between "good" and "evil" in all
doctrines of political action, there
could be no "progressive" politics
at all, and no way of aiming at a
"better" world.
Thus, most liberal thinkers, as
well as all honest Marxists, also
"expose the evils of the doctrines
of Marx." To distinguish fairly
between the good and the evil in
such doctrines is an essential
task of the critical mind.
The vast majority of liberals
reject Marxist thought, precisely
through critical reason. To iden
tify liberalism with an uncritical
acceptance of Marx is a serious
error; many of Marx's most
penetrating critics have been
liberals — or even Marxists, such
as C. Wright Mills and Leszck
Kolakowski.
