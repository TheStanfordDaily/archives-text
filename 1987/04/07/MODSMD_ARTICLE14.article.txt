### ERIN MARTIN 
Stanford University libraries have acquired the un
published diary of Pauline Pfelffer Hemingway, wife
of Ernest Hemingway, recounting the couple's three
month safari In East Africa.
The diary of Pauline Hemingway, the second of
Hemingway's four wives. Is expected to provide new
background on his subsequent writings about
Africa.
"Pauline's diaries should have a lot of bearing on
works such as "The Snows of Kilimanjaro' and 'Green
Hills of Africa,' " said English Prof. George Dekker.
"It should be somewhat Illuminating about their
marriage as well."
Nancy Packer, professor of English, said that the
addition of the journal to University collections Is
"marvelous."
"This should be extremely interesting and provide
Insight into why once Hemingway married her, he
stopped writing so well," she said.
The diary, covering Nov. 22, 1933 to Feb. 21, 1934,
focuses on the writer's experiences as a new hunter

on his first safari. According to Carol Rudlsell. man
uscript librarian in special collections and University
archives at Green Library, "It talks about
Hemingway's love of big game, as well as some of his
mishaps and fears about the trip."
The Hemingway's marriage was "not a happy one"
In the eyes of most biographers, according to Dek
ker. "Critics have not been fair to her. I think it is
very important to get the other side of the story," he
added.
"People have seen her as a 'rich bitch' out to get a
famous writer," he said. "This diary may show that it
just was not like that at all."
Rudlsell said the journal Includes descriptions of
Hemingway's great fear of snakes, his Inexperience
with guns that once almost led him to accidentally
shoot himself and medical problems of severe
amoebic dysentery.
Donated by Alicia, Claire and Jay McEvoy of San
Francisco, the diary is currently available for viewing
by students and faculty in the University archives at
Green Library.
