Reagan finishes Canadian talks
OTTAWA, Canada — President Reagan yesterday wrapped up a
25-hour summit meeting with Canadian Prime Minister Brian
Mulroney with a surprise promise to consider a new U.S.-
Canadian accord on acid rain controls and a ringing endorsement
of a sweeping free-trade agreement between the two nations.
While Reagan and Mulroney are basically in accord on free
trade, the United States has resisted Canada's call for a treaty
pledging the two countries to eliminate 50 percent of the emis
sions that cause acid rain by 1994.
But Reagan unexpectedly added language at the end of a
prepared speech to the Canadian Parliament saying that "the
prime minister and I have agreed to consider a bilateral accord on
acid rain, building on the tradition of agreements to control pollu
tions of our shared International waters."
Such an agreement on acid rain, patterned after the accord by
which the two nations monitor water quality in the Great Lakes,
would fall short of a treaty but goes further than Reagan has ever
gone before on the acid rain Issue.
White House spokesman Marlln Fitzwater called the statement
"a first step" and said the U.S. administration had reached no
decision on whether the "mechanism" of Internationally controll
ing acid rain would require a treaty.
In his speech to Parliament, where he was loudly cheered but
also twice interrupted by hecklers, Reagan said that the free-trade
agreement, now the subject of Intense U.S.-Canadian negotia
tions, would serve as a model of International cooperation "to all
nations that now wrestle against the siren temptation of protec
tionism." The Parliament applauded when Reagan then pledged
to engage In "good faith negotiations that will make this visionary
proposal a reality."
Court rules against Texaco
WASHINGTON — The Supreme Court dealt Texaco Inc. a major
setback in its bitter legal battle with Pennzoil Co., ruling yesterday
that the company may still be required to post an *11 billion bond
while it appeals a damage award Pennzoil won In 1985.
The high court unanimously overturned lower federal court vic
tories for Texaco that reduced the appeal bond requirement to *1
billion. Texaco, one of the nations 10 largest companies, had
argued that It would be forced Into bankruptcy If required to pay
the higher bond.
The Justices, citing established principles governing the rela
tionship between state and federal courts, ruled that the lower
federal courts should have stayed out of the bond dispute until the
Texas state courts had Issued final rulings on the entire contro
versy.
The ruling Intensifies pressure on both Texaco and Pennzoil to
negotiate a bond or lien agreement sufficient to protect Pennzoil
but not so expensive as to force Texaco to seek protection under
federal bankruptcy laws, attorneys involved in the case said.
The court did not address the central state court issue that
produced the record-setting >10.5 billion jury award: whether
Texaco wrongfully interfered in a 1984 agreement between Pen
nzoil and Getty Oil Co. under which Pennzoil would buy 42 per
cent of Getty's stock. Texaco outbid Pennzoil and wound up with
Getty's oil reserves.
Kemp enters presidential race
WASHINGTON — Stressing a hard-line approach to defense and
foreign policy, New York Rep. Jack Kemp formally announced his
candidacy yesterday for the 1988 Republican presidential nomin
ation.
In a crowded House hearing room, surrounded by his colleagues
and supporters, the former pro football star and one of the prime
Instigators of President Reagan's supply-side tax cut warned that
"the central dilemma of our day is that we lie defenseless against
Soviet missiles."
To meet that threat, he called for rapid deployment of the Strate
gic Defense Initiative, Reagan's space-based missile defense pro
gram, and he vowed to turn the forthcoming campaign into a
"national referendum" on the Issue.
In dealing with the Soviet Union and its allies around the world.
Kemp called on Americans to "unite behind a strategy for victory."
going beyond "containing communism to the ultimate triumph of
freedom." As a start In that direction, he urged support for guer
rilla forces battling communist regimes on three continents.
Beefier and grayer than during his quarterback days with the
Buffalo Bills, the 51-year-old legislator still exudes youthful
vitality. He has been a top drawing card at Republican gatherings
across the nation ever since he rose to prominence In the late
1970s with his advocacy of across-the-board cuts in income tax
rates.
Egyptians hold troubled vote
CAIRO, Egypt — Egyptians voted yesterday in parliamentary
elections that President Hosnl Mubarak hopes will bolster his
image as a democratic reformer and give him a mandate to lead
Egypt through tough economic times that lie ahead.
However, the balloting was marred by reports of violence, allega
tions of fraud and what appeared to be a low voter turnout due to
deep-seated public apathy.
Spokesmen for the four opposition groups contesting the elec
tion along with the ruling National Democratic Party all accused
the government of ballot-rigging and acts of violence and intimi
dation directed against both their members and voters.
Their reports ranged from one to three persons killed, scores
Injured and hundreds arrested In clashes between supporters of
the ruling and opposition parties. However, government officials
strongly denied the charges and Independent observers touring
various polling stations In the Nile Delta, where most of the vio
lence was reported, witnessed a few clashes and scuffles but said
' the opposition charges appeared to be greatly exaggerated.
"The allegations of fraud and violence are as inevitable as the
outcome of the election." said one Western diplomat, who sugges
ted that the balloting was neither as crooked as the opposition
seemed determined to portray it nor as fair as the government
would like It to seem.
Poland may try radical reform
WARSAW, Poland — Faced with a stagnating economy and en
couraged by the policies of Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev.
Polish government planners are considering a program of radical
new economic reforms that would mandate a dramatic expansion
of private enterprise and capitalist-style markets here in the com
ing years.
The reform plan, details of which were revealed for the first time
last week, is still being debated and could be weakened or even
gutted before Its formal unveiling by the government's Economic
Reform Commission, now planned for June.
But officials said the steps being considered would put Poland
on a par with countries such as China and Hungary that have
gone the furthest in revising the traditional state-run socialist
economy.
Adoption of the plan would also represent a major policy shift by
the government of Gen. Wojciech Jaruzelskl. Though Poland drew
up a package of market-oriented economic reforms in 1981,
during the existence of the Solidarity trade union, the measures
have never been fully implemented and Jaruzelskl has shown little
Interest In extending them In the last five years.

Reagan finishes Canadian talks
OTTAWA, Canada — President Reagan yesterday wrapped up a
25-hour summit meeting with Canadian Prime Minister Brian
Mulroney with a surprise promise to consider a new U.S.-
Canadian accord on acid rain controls and a ringing endorsement
of a sweeping free-trade agreement between the two nations.
While Reagan and Mulroney are basically in accord on free
trade, the United States has resisted Canada's call for a treaty
pledging the two countries to eliminate 50 percent of the emis
sions that cause acid rain by 1994.
But Reagan unexpectedly added language at the end of a
prepared speech to the Canadian Parliament saying that "the
prime minister and I have agreed to consider a bilateral accord on
acid rain, building on the tradition of agreements to control pollu
tions of our shared International waters."
Such an agreement on acid rain, patterned after the accord by
which the two nations monitor water quality in the Great Lakes,
would fall short of a treaty but goes further than Reagan has ever
gone before on the acid rain Issue.
White House spokesman Marlln Fitzwater called the statement
"a first step" and said the U.S. administration had reached no
decision on whether the "mechanism" of Internationally controll
ing acid rain would require a treaty.
In his speech to Parliament, where he was loudly cheered but
also twice interrupted by hecklers, Reagan said that the free-trade
agreement, now the subject of Intense U.S.-Canadian negotia
tions, would serve as a model of International cooperation "to all
nations that now wrestle against the siren temptation of protec
tionism." The Parliament applauded when Reagan then pledged
to engage In "good faith negotiations that will make this visionary
proposal a reality."
Court rules against Texaco
WASHINGTON — The Supreme Court dealt Texaco Inc. a major
setback in its bitter legal battle with Pennzoil Co., ruling yesterday
that the company may still be required to post an *11 billion bond
while it appeals a damage award Pennzoil won In 1985.
The high court unanimously overturned lower federal court vic
tories for Texaco that reduced the appeal bond requirement to *1
billion. Texaco, one of the nations 10 largest companies, had
argued that It would be forced Into bankruptcy If required to pay
the higher bond.
The Justices, citing established principles governing the rela
tionship between state and federal courts, ruled that the lower
federal courts should have stayed out of the bond dispute until the
Texas state courts had Issued final rulings on the entire contro
versy.
The ruling Intensifies pressure on both Texaco and Pennzoil to
negotiate a bond or lien agreement sufficient to protect Pennzoil
but not so expensive as to force Texaco to seek protection under
federal bankruptcy laws, attorneys involved in the case said.
The court did not address the central state court issue that
produced the record-setting >10.5 billion jury award: whether
Texaco wrongfully interfered in a 1984 agreement between Pen
nzoil and Getty Oil Co. under which Pennzoil would buy 42 per
cent of Getty's stock. Texaco outbid Pennzoil and wound up with
Getty's oil reserves.
Kemp enters presidential race
WASHINGTON — Stressing a hard-line approach to defense and
foreign policy, New York Rep. Jack Kemp formally announced his
candidacy yesterday for the 1988 Republican presidential nomin
ation.
In a crowded House hearing room, surrounded by his colleagues
and supporters, the former pro football star and one of the prime
Instigators of President Reagan's supply-side tax cut warned that
"the central dilemma of our day is that we lie defenseless against
Soviet missiles."
To meet that threat, he called for rapid deployment of the Strate
gic Defense Initiative, Reagan's space-based missile defense pro
gram, and he vowed to turn the forthcoming campaign into a
"national referendum" on the Issue.
In dealing with the Soviet Union and its allies around the world.
Kemp called on Americans to "unite behind a strategy for victory."
going beyond "containing communism to the ultimate triumph of
freedom." As a start In that direction, he urged support for guer
rilla forces battling communist regimes on three continents.
Beefier and grayer than during his quarterback days with the
Buffalo Bills, the 51-year-old legislator still exudes youthful
vitality. He has been a top drawing card at Republican gatherings
across the nation ever since he rose to prominence In the late
1970s with his advocacy of across-the-board cuts in income tax
rates.
Egyptians hold troubled vote
CAIRO, Egypt — Egyptians voted yesterday in parliamentary
elections that President Hosnl Mubarak hopes will bolster his
image as a democratic reformer and give him a mandate to lead
Egypt through tough economic times that lie ahead.
However, the balloting was marred by reports of violence, allega
tions of fraud and what appeared to be a low voter turnout due to
deep-seated public apathy.
Spokesmen for the four opposition groups contesting the elec
tion along with the ruling National Democratic Party all accused
the government of ballot-rigging and acts of violence and intimi
dation directed against both their members and voters.
Their reports ranged from one to three persons killed, scores
Injured and hundreds arrested In clashes between supporters of
the ruling and opposition parties. However, government officials
strongly denied the charges and Independent observers touring
various polling stations In the Nile Delta, where most of the vio
lence was reported, witnessed a few clashes and scuffles but said
' the opposition charges appeared to be greatly exaggerated.
"The allegations of fraud and violence are as inevitable as the
outcome of the election." said one Western diplomat, who sugges
ted that the balloting was neither as crooked as the opposition
seemed determined to portray it nor as fair as the government
would like It to seem.
Poland may try radical reform
WARSAW, Poland — Faced with a stagnating economy and en
couraged by the policies of Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev.
Polish government planners are considering a program of radical
new economic reforms that would mandate a dramatic expansion
of private enterprise and capitalist-style markets here in the com
