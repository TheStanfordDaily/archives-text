## How the fizz came back Bug uncovers the real Pop Rocks story

Dearest Bug,
How are you? What is the true
history of Pop Rocks Action
Candy? They were the candy oj
our generation. You remember
the rumors: that Mlkey, oj Life
cereal fame, died because he ate
them while drinking a soft drink;
that they were banned. Why are
they back, six years after they
disappeared?
- Mr. Goodbar
As a trip to the supermarket
breakfast-cereal aisle would show.
Mlkey did not die; he's alive and
kicking In Life cereal's new ad
campaign.
Pop Rocks were created in 1956
by a General Foods chemist who
was trying to Invent an instant
soda pop. Serendlpitously, he
ended up with a hard carbonated
candy that popped and fizzed in
one's mouth. General Foods began
marketing Pop Rocks in 1977 and
went on to sell half-a-billion pack

ets of them in the year-and-a-half
before their demise.
As is the nature of those things,
no one nows how the rumor about
Mikey's death got started, but it is
true that General Foods' profits
plunged 24 percent in the last
quarter of 1979 because of the
candy's slumped sales. In 1980.
General Foods halted Pop Rocks
production.
In 1985, lured by their
phenomenal profit potential, two
investors "paid a substantial
amount" to General Foods for a
license to manufacture Pop Rocks.
They formed Carbonated Candy
Ventures after obtaining the U.S.
Food and Drug Administration's
reapproval of their product's
safety (a packet of Pop Rocks con
tains only 10 percent of the car
bon dioxide found in a can of soda
pop).
In January, the company began
test-marketing throughout Cali
fornia and Arizona, finding, as CC
Venture Vice President and Gen

eral Manager Mary O'Brien put
it,"that all the rumors that in
volved Pop Rocks before aren't
happening again."
The Pop Rocks explosion is on
once again; CC Venture

spokesperson Sue Foley called the
testing run, "tremendously suc
cessful."
Dear Bug Me,
Why does Stanford, always the

iconoclast, refer to our beloved
degrees-to-be as A.B.'s and
A.M.'s? Does someone in the
Registrar's Office have dyslexia?
At first, I entertained the notion
that the Moral Majority had in
sisted on warning labels for
obscene degree abbreviations,
but surely It would not have
stopped until that filthy B.S. was
eradicated as well. Even the ref
erence librarians at Green do not
know the answer to this looming
question. I suspect a conspiracy;
is Don Kennedy a communist?
- Scrambled
Rest assured that Stanford Isn't
the only place that Juggles the let
ter ordering; the Chicago Manual
of Style maintains that M.A.,
A.M.. 8.A., A.8., M.S. and B.S. are
all okay.
The first 11 people I talked to
said, "1 don't really know, why
don't you ask so and so." Using
this method, 1 managed to work
nicely through the offices of the

Registrar, the President, the Dean
of Humanities and Sciences, the
Graduation Assistant, the Univer
sity Archives and then on back to
the Registrar. With no luck.
Attempted explanations ranged
from, "maybe It's an alphabetical
ordering thing," and "maybe It's
Greek versus Latin," to "maybe It's
all a mistake."
After contemplating this all a
bit, I stepped back and realized
that In the olden days, when col
lege degrees were done In Latin,
and Artlum Baccalaureus was the
proper word order, there couldn't
have been enough known science
for anyone to get a Sclentlae Bac
calaureus by studying It. English
came along before science had
progressed to the mainstream
university curriculum level. And
so It was. You can earn a Maglster
in Artlum or the Arts, but only a
Master In the Sciences.

firmed by the chair of the Classics
