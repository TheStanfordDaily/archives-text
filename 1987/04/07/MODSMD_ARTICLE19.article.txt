## Card nine looks for TKO at SCU 
### TOM SENF Senior staff writer 
In the spirit of last night's Leonard-
Hagler fight, today's game between Stan
ford and Santa Clara can be seen as a pre
liminary to this weekend's main event —
the Cardinal's three-game clash with UCLA
at Sunken Diamond.
Today's bout begins at 2:30 p.m. at Buck
Shaw Stadium In Santa Clara and would
seem to be about as even as a Mike Tyson-
Pee Wee Herman matchup. The Cardinal
brings a 25-10 record Into the contest and
Is ranked fifth nationally by
ESPN/Colleglate Baseball and seventh by
Baseball America.
The Broncos are a respectable 19-17-2 on
the year, but were handled easily (6-2) by
Stanford on Feb. 1. Santa Clara has also
lost two games to Pacific 10 Southern Divi
sion doormat California.
Still, Santa Clara is tied for second in the
West Coast Athletic Conference with

Nevada-Reno and Loyola-Marymount at 7-6-
1. The three teams trail Pepperdlne. ranked
No. 5 by Baseball America and No. 6 by
ESPN.
The Broncos' top offensive threats are
third baseman Gary Maasberg and fresh
man catcher Troy Buckley. Maasberg Is hit
ting .351 with six homers and 27 RBIs,
while Buckley has five homers and 37 RBIs
to go with a .343 average.
Stanford is coming off a successful
weekend in Los Angeles that saw it take two
of three games from USC. The Cardinal
pitching staff, expected to be one of the best
in the nation this year, has asserted itself
lately, compiling a 1.03 ERA in the last four
games.
The most impressive of those four games
was Friday night's two-hit, 13-strikeout
shutout thrown by Jack McDowell. The
Trojans put two men on base In just one in
ning. and neither of their two hits (a flare to

was particularly well hit.
Although USC's Brian Nichols
stopped the Cardinal 3-1 on five
hits Sunday, Stanford Coach
Mark Marquess was still happy
with the weekend outcome. "You
like to get the sweep anytime you
win the first two, but we're real
pleased," he said. "1 thought we
played well."

agreed. "Anytime you get It posi
tion to sweep, you have to try to
take advantage of It,"he said.
"Unfortunately. It didn't work out,
but we played pretty well and
pitched very well."
Because all of Stanford's top
relievers — Brian Keyser, Rob
Wassenaar, A 1 Osuna and Steve
Chitren — saw action this
weekend, today's game will likely
be a staff effort. Keyser. McDowell
and Jim Price will probably not
throw today, but anyone else, In
cluding Mark Carper and Dave
Rels, could see some duty.
Card notes
The 10-game conference winning
streak that was snapped Sunday set a
Stanford record. The previous mark
was eight, set in 1967-68 and tied in
1982.
