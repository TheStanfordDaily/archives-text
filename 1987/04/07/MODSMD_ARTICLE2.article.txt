# COP slate wants to communicate
## 
### MONIQUE SCHEER Senior staff writer 
This is the second in a ivecklong series of arti
cles on the issues and candidates that will
appear on the ASSU spring election ballot.

The one word that would describe what "The
Equalizers" stand for is: communication.
Sophomore Leonard Adler and juniors Maria
Canas, Jim Durkin and Roechelle Smith, who
make up the Council of Presidents (COP) slate,
all agree that students need to be heard. To
back up this belief, they have come up with a
number of reforms in the ASSU they claim
would facilitate better communication be
tween them and the students.

"We want people to feel as If they have an
equal voice," Canas said, recalling how she
once felt too Intimidated to talk to the COP, a
feeling she thinks many students still have.
"We want to bring the ASSU down to earth. We
want people to feel at home," she said.
Durkin pointed out that they hope more
open communication would work two ways.
"Not only would it make us more visible, but it

would put us on the spot and make us more ac
countable," he said.
If elected, the slate plans to hold office hours
In White Plaza once a week and to speak at
house meetings each week to improve commu
nication between students, the ASSU and the
University faculty and Board of Trustees.
The four would also start a telephone survey
of students prior to each senate meeting in or
der to better ascertain student opinion on key
issues. "We could get a good enough feel for the
student body opinion with about 150
responses," Smith said.
While agreeing that communication is a
main issue of the Equalizers' campaign, Adler
added that the group will be working for
results as well. "Things can get done," Adler
said, citing as an example his own achieve
ment as a senator this year of installing
change machines in Wilbur Hall.
"We want students to see results." Adler
said. "If I go to a house meeting in Branner, I
have to have something to say if I don't want to
feel foolish."
Adler, a political science and computer sci
ence major, Is the only member of the slate
who has been in the ASSU. "The students
don't need a bunch of people (in the COP) who
have been stuck in the ASSU," he said.
Adler also sits on several committees, where
he has authored bills on freshman housing
and divestment.

Canas, c* junior in English, has been active
in public service as the Volunteer Network
liaison for Potter dormitory and a barrio assis
tance tutor last year. She is facilitator for the
Rape Education Project and headed advertis
ing for their recent conference, "Women and
Men: Voices for Change." She also sits on two
University committees on undergraduate cur
ricula.
Durkin, a junior in economics and psychol
ogy, has been involved in entertainment at
Stanford, serving as promotions manager for
the Concert Network last year. He also founded
the Comedy Club of Stanford and Insane
Asylum Productions.
Smith, an electrical engineering major, is a
member of the Society of Black Scientists and
Engineers. She served on the banquet commit
tee last year and currently sits on the solicita
tions committee. She has also sung with the
Stanford Gospel Choir for two years and
helped choreograph for the Kuumba Dance
Ensemble last year.
Pointing to the level of dedication the slate
members have shown to their respective activi
ties, Adler said they would be just as commit
ted to the COP if elected.
Three members would stay on campus over
the summer and all four would take only half
time course loads if elected, Adler said. Durkin
described it as "the biggest dedication made in
years."
