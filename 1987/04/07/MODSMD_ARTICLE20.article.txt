# Golfers gain third-place finish with McCarthy out
## 
### ROBERT PORTNOY Staff writer 
Trish McGonigle, Clare Dolan,
Adrienne Gilmartin and Kay Cor
nelius yesterday proved them
selves to a lot of people.
If anyone, for even a moment,
thought that the Stanford
women's golf team simply rode the
heels of its superstar senior, Kath
leen McCarthy, such myths have
been thoroughly dispelled.
While McCarthy rested at home
with the flu, the Cardinal quartet,
seven strokes off the lead after
shooting 316 Sunday, bettered
that total by four shots in the
morning round, and then shot a
blistering 305 over the final 18 to
retain third place in the California
Intercollegiate.
After opening the tournament
at the Stanford Golf Course, the
women moved yesterday to the
Villages Golf Course in San Jose
for the final 36 holes. Leading
second-place USC by five strokes
going into the final day, San Jose
State stayed hot on its home
course to capture the team title at
910. The Trojans wound up eight
shots back, with Stanford at 933.
USC was led by freshman sensa
tion Tracy Nakamura, who shot
72 and 73 the final day to win the
individual crown with a 222 total,
her second tournament title of the
year. Nakamura benefitted by not
having to go head-to-head with
the top collegiate player in the
country, Laurette Maritz of U.S.
International. Maritz was in
second place behind Stanford's
Clare Dolan on the strength of a
75 Sunday, but, like McCarthy,
she was bitten by the flu bug.
The Stanford standout yester
day was McGonigle, a junior.

Trish McGonigle fired a 230 over 54 holes, including a final-round 74,
to finish fourth yesterday at the California Intercollegiate.
McGonigle shot even-par on the
back nine Sunday to salvage an
80, and then kept up the pace
with a 76 to open the final day and
a 74 over the last 18. McGonigle's
230 total was good for fourth place
individually.
"Trish is a real competitor and
the most competitive person we
have on our team. She's the kind
of person who digs down deep,
and even when she's not hitting it
well, she's competitive as hell,"
Stanford Coach Tim Baldwin said.
"She has a lot of the competitive
fire of (NCAA tennis champion)
Patty Fendick. As her game comes
together, combine it with her
competitiveness, and we may
really have something. Controlling
those competitive fires is some

thing Trish has had to learn to
do."
Dolan. the leader after her first
round 74. fell to 80 and 77 in the
final two rounds. Her 231 total
was still good for fifth place, just a
shot behind McGonigle. Monday
proved a very long day for Dolan.
who is still coming back after a
year off because of tendonitis in
her left wrist.
"1 didn't play very well. 1 was
scrambling most of the time to
save myself becuase 1 was hitting
it all over the place. 1 didn't do that
very well either, so my scores were
a little higher." Dolan said.
Baldwin was quick to point out
that Dolan is still recovering.
"Every day her ball-striking con
tinues to Improve. She has the
ability to scramble when things
don't go well. She's just at that
stage right now. trying to get her
game back together." Baldwin
said.
