# Golfers gain third-place finish with McCarthy out
## 
### ROBERT PORTNOY Staff writer 
Trish McGonigle, Clare Dolan,
Adrienne Gilmartin and Kay Cor
nelius yesterday proved them
selves to a lot of people.
If anyone, for even a moment,
thought that the Stanford
women's golf team simply rode the
heels of its superstar senior, Kath
leen McCarthy, such myths have
been thoroughly dispelled.
While McCarthy rested at home
with the flu, the Cardinal quartet,
seven strokes off the lead after
shooting 316 Sunday, bettered
that total by four shots in the
morning round, and then shot a
blistering 305 over the final 18 to
retain third place in the California
Intercollegiate.
After opening the tournament
at the Stanford Golf Course, the
women moved yesterday to the
Villages Golf Course in San Jose
for the final 36 holes. Leading
second-place USC by five strokes
going into the final day, San Jose
State stayed hot on its home
course to capture the team title at
910. The Trojans wound up eight
shots back, with Stanford at 933.
USC was led by freshman sensa
tion Tracy Nakamura, who shot
72 and 73 the final day to win the
individual crown with a 222 total,
her second tournament title of the
year. Nakamura benefitted by not
having to go head-to-head with
the top collegiate player in the
country, Laurette Maritz of U.S.
International. Maritz was in
second place behind Stanford's
Clare Dolan on the strength of a
75 Sunday, but, like McCarthy,
she was bitten by the flu bug.
The Stanford standout yester
day was McGonigle, a junior.
