### CHRIS CRADER Staff writer 
A truism In sports Is that finishing a season fast Is
more Important than starting it fast. It is true,
though, that a fast start can often lead to a strong
finish, and nothing would make the Stanford crew
teams more happy.
On Saturday, both the men and the women sent
squads to the San Diego Crew Classic, perhaps the
best competition this side of the national champion
ships, and both teams posted Impressive results.
The varsity women took third behind Washington
and defending national champion Wisconsin, turn
ing in a time of 6:57. while the men rowed a 6:09,
good for sixth, but within nine seconds of the win
ner, Harvard.
Also competing on the men's side was a freshman
eight, which missed a stroke with only 14 more to go

while fighting neck and neck with Orange Coast Col
lege; the novice team, which placed third and
"finished as high as they could," according to Stan
ford Coach Ken Dreyfuss; and the JV boat, which
couldn't come back from a slow start to catch OCC or
Pennsylvania in their heat.
For the women, the JV boat also took third place,
and the two freshman boats excelled. The No. 1 frosh
boat took second and the No. 2 boat won in its cate
gory.
Dreyfuss said he was glad to see his team's good
practices paying off with a good regatta. "We went
there still not knowing," he said, adding that the
team now has the realization that we can row with
anybody. We're no longer . . . trying to become a good
crew; this crew is there.
The race also marked the first time that Stanford's
varsity has beaten California In 16 years, as the
Bears placed seventh.
