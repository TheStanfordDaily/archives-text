LAS VEGAS, Nev. (AP) â€” Sugar Ray Leonard
returned to the ring in spectacular fashion after a
three-year layoff and upset Marvelous Marvin
Hagler last night to become the world mid
dleweight champion.
Leonard won the 12-rou.nd bout on a split deci
sion to become boxing's 10th triple champion.
Leonard circled and impressed judges with
flurries in the late rounds In one of the great
comeback stories in boxing history, although
some thought the aggressive Hagler had an edge.
Judge Lou Filippo scored it 115-113 for Hagler
while judge Dave Moretti saw it 115-113 and Jo Jo
Guerra had it 118-110, both for Leonard.
The Associated Press favored Hagler, 117-112.
"I see myself taking him out," Leonard said of a
dream he had in the days before the fight.
Leonard couldn't take him out, but he did what
the oddsmakers gave him little chance to do.
Hagler, losing for the first time in 38 fights,
dating to 1976, was a 5-2 favorite.
"He, to me, is still the champion," the jubilant
Leonard said In the ring after the fight as a sellout
throng of 15,366 in an outdoor arena at Caesars
Palace cheered him on.
"I didn't want the belt. I just wanted to beat
him."
Leonard, fighting for only the second time since
his last undisputed welterweight title fight in Feb.

1982, came out circling and made Hagler miss
badly in the first four rounds. Then in the fifth,
Hagler landed some head shots and hurt Leonard
with a left to the head.
Throughout the fight, the stalking Hagler
seemed to land the harder shots. But Leonard,
looking very tired from the sixth through 10th
rounds, never quit fighting, landing severed com
binations although they seemed to lack sting.
In the 11th round, Leonard went flat-footed and
outpunched Hagler with several flurries to the
head, followed with a beautiful hook to the body
and a hook to the head.
Throughout the fight. Hagler trapped Leonard
on the ropes, only to have Leonard flurry to get
free.
Both men went at it toe-to-toe in the final round
and on a couple of occasions Leonard circled his
hand in the air to lead cheers for himself. Hagler
hurt Leonard with a left to the head, but then the
bell sounded.
"I beat him," Hagler said. "I beat him, and he
knows it."
"I told you about Vegas. They stole it. I stayed
aggressive, and I won the fight," said Hagler who
had complained about the officiating in Las
Vegas.
"I made a comeback that was the greatest ac
complishment of my life," Leonard said.
