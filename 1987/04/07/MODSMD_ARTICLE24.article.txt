Stanford Out of South Africa (SOSA)
Proposal for Changes in Stanford University Investment Policy
March 1987

1.) Criteria and timetable for divestment: Pro
posed amendment to the University
Statement on Investment Responsibility Concern
ing Endowment Securities
Insert section 2.5:
2.5 Investments in Corporations Conducting
Business in or with South Africa
Corporations conducting business in or with
South Africa include those corporations which
grant loans to South Africa, those which engage in
trade activities with South Africa, and those
which operate subsidiary firms in South Africa.
The University Statement on Invesment Respon
sibility Concerning Endowment Securities
includes the measure that the University will seek
to eliminate "substantial social injury" caused by
a company's activities either in its capacity as
shareholder or by selling its securities in that com
pany.
Given the repressive nature and pervasiveness
of the apartheid system in South Africa, however,
any corporation conducting business in or with
South Africa is aiding in or directly causing sub
stantial social injury. These corporations
legitimize and lend credibility to the oppressive
regime, provide strategic resources to the South
African government, supply the high level tech
nology necessary for the modernization and
maintenance of government repression, and
create a revenue base for the minority regime.
In light of this and the fact that the apartheid
system pervades every aspect of life in South

Africa, it is clear that foreign corporations, rather
than helping to reform apartheid, actually bolster
the apartheid regime. Therefore, all corporations
which conduct business in or with South Africa
should begin immediate steps toward disinvest
ment. Moreover, Stanford University will take
measures to insure that this process of disinvest
ment is completed as quickly and effectively as
possible.
The measures which the University will take in
clude the following actions:
1) Immediate establishment of a moratorium on new
investments in companies conducting business in
or with South Africa.
2) Initiation of dialogue by September 1, 1987 with all
firms in the University portfolio with South Africa
links calling for disclosure of information regarding
corporate activities in South Africa and calling for
the adoption of the following measures:
a) Immediate termination of commercial activi
ties with the government of South Africa and
its security apparatus: police, military, migra
tion control, influx control regulation.
b) Immediate termination of operations of sub
sidiary firms in South Africa.
Response to these inquiries and this call for
disinvestment by the University will be expected by
January 1, 1988.
If corporations agree to adopt the measures out
lined above by January I, 1988, then the Univer
sity will lift its moratorium on investments in these

corporations. Failure to adopt the measures out
lined within a reasonable period of time will result
in reinstatement of the moratorium and initiation
of divestment procedures.
If corporations refuse to adopt the measures out
lined above by January 1, 1988, then the
University will immediately begin to enact proce
dures for divestment of its securities in these corpo
rations. Divestment from these corporations will be
completed by January 1, 1989.
Corporations that refuse to disclose adequate in
formation concerning their South Africa opera
tions or that fail to provide a response to the
University's inquiries by January 1, 1988 will be
considered to have refused to adopt the measures
outlined above, and the University will begin to
enact procedures for divestment of its securities in
these corporations.
The University will also act in concert with other
colleges and universities in order to communicate its
concern to and amplify its leverage on corporations as
well as on United States policy makers.
Additional actions may also be appropriate to pres
sure and insure corporate disinvestment from South
Africa. University action is not limited to the measures
listed above.
2.) Mechanism for divestment
The Commission on Investment Responsibility
(CIR) will immediately begin researching the South
Africa activities of corporations in the University
portfolio. They will also initiate dialogues with these

corporations by September 1, 1987, calling for disin
vestment from South Africa and for the adoption of
the measures outlined above.
This dialogue will take place between University
administrators, corporate officials, and the Boards of
Directors of these corporations. Response to the Uni
versity's inquiries and call for disinvestment will be
expected by January 1, 1988.
The CIR will then insure that the University enact
procedures for divestment from corporations which
by January 1, 1988 have not disclosed adequate infor
mation concerning their South Africa operations,
have refused to respond to the University's inquiries,
or have not adopted the measures outlined above.
This divestment process is to be completed by January
1, 1989. The CIR will also actively monitor and evalu
ate the activities of those corporations which have
agreed to adopt the measures set forth by the Univer
sity regarding operations in South Africa to insure
compliance with the measures outlined above.
3.) Additional Changes in University Invest
ment Policy
1) Establishment of an open University invest
ment policy to include monthly publication of
University portfolio transactions, beginning May
1987.
2) Establishment of a Re-investment Planning
Commission, which includes student represen
tation with full membership, to investigate so
cially responsible investment alternatives for
the University portfolio.

Author:
Stacey Leyton, Undergraduate Senator
Whereas the student body has voted to support total
divestment by a two-to-one margin, and
Whereas the ASSU Senate continues to support total
divestment, and
Whereas the SOSA proposal presents a reasonable
process and timeline for divestment from all corporations
doing business in South Africa;
Be it resolved by the Senate of the Association
that we endorse the SOSA proposal and call upon the
Board of Trustees to approve this proposal.

Referendum 2
In Opposition to the
Proposed Site of the
Reagan Library
In recognition of:
• the environmental and visual sensitivity of the pro
posed site in the Stanford Foothills; and,
• the intensity of the expected use by non-academic
visitors which would be potentially disruptive to the
academic operations of the University; and,
• the viability of the facility in a location outside of the
Foothills Region;
BE IT RESOLVED that the students of Stanford Univer
sity recommend that the Board of Trustees and the Ronald
Reagan Foundation select an alternate and more appro
priate site for the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library, and
that the site selection process should include appropriate
and well-publicized opportunities for significant participa
tion by students, faculty, and other Stanford community
members.

Referendum 3
On the Preservation of the Foothills
In recognition of:
The Foothills as an unique resource of tremendous en
vironmental and aesthetic value to Stanford University;
and,
The area's vulnerability to the increasing development
pressures;
BE IT RESOLVED that the students of Stanford Univer
sity recommend that the Board of Trustees take special
and immediate action to ensure and preserve the Stanford
Foothills Region (bounded by Alpine Road, Junipero
Serra Boulevard, Page Mill Road, and Interstate 280) as
undeveloped open space, with exception given only to
academic uses which would not be viable in any alterna
tive location, and which would not be disruptive to the
environmental and visual quality of the area.
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that the students of
Stanford University recommend that the Board of Trus
tees create a procedural mechanism, internal to the
University, by which Stanford land use decisions in the
Foothills Region and in all other areas owned by the
University can be fully and fairly appealed at the re
quest of a legitimate and appropriate number of faculty,
staff, students, and/or Stanford community members.

its security apparatus: police, military, migra
tion control, influx control regulation.
b) Immediate termination of operations of sub
sidiary firms in South Africa.
Response to these inquiries and this call for
disinvestment by the University will be expected by
January 1, 1988.
If corporations agree to adopt the measures out
lined above by January I, 1988, then the Univer
sity will lift its moratorium on investments in these

corporations. Failure to adopt the measures out
lined within a reasonable period of time will result
in reinstatement of the moratorium and initiation
of divestment procedures.
If corporations refuse to adopt the measures out
lined above by January 1, 1988, then the
University will immediately begin to enact proce
dures for divestment of its securities in these corpo
rations. Divestment from these corporations will be
completed by January 1, 1989.
Corporations that refuse to disclose adequate in
formation concerning their South Africa opera
tions or that fail to provide a response to the
University's inquiries by January 1, 1988 will be
considered to have refused to adopt the measures
outlined above, and the University will begin to
enact procedures for divestment of its securities in
these corporations.
The University will also act in concert with other
colleges and universities in order to communicate its
concern to and amplify its leverage on corporations as
well as on United States policy makers.
Additional actions may also be appropriate to pres
sure and insure corporate disinvestment from South
Africa. University action is not limited to the measures
listed above.
2.) Mechanism for divestment
The Commission on Investment Responsibility
(CIR) will immediately begin researching the South
Africa activities of corporations in the University
portfolio. They will also initiate dialogues with these

corporations by September 1, 1987, calling for disin
vestment from South Africa and for the adoption of
the measures outlined above.
This dialogue will take place between University
administrators, corporate officials, and the Boards of
Directors of these corporations. Response to the Uni
versity's inquiries and call for disinvestment will be
expected by January 1, 1988.
The CIR will then insure that the University enact
procedures for divestment from corporations which
by January 1, 1988 have not disclosed adequate infor
mation concerning their South Africa operations,
have refused to respond to the University's inquiries,
or have not adopted the measures outlined above.
This divestment process is to be completed by January
1, 1989. The CIR will also actively monitor and evalu
ate the activities of those corporations which have
agreed to adopt the measures set forth by the Univer
sity regarding operations in South Africa to insure
compliance with the measures outlined above.
3.) Additional Changes in University Invest
ment Policy
1) Establishment of an open University invest
ment policy to include monthly publication of
University portfolio transactions, beginning May
1987.
2) Establishment of a Re-investment Planning
Commission, which includes student represen
tation with full membership, to investigate so
cially responsible investment alternatives for
the University portfolio.

Stanford Out of South Africa (SOSA)
Proposal for Changes in Stanford University Investment Policy
March 1987

1.) Criteria and timetable for divestment: Pro
posed amendment to the University
Statement on Investment Responsibility Concern
ing Endowment Securities
Insert section 2.5:
2.5 Investments in Corporations Conducting
Business in or with South Africa
Corporations conducting business in or with
South Africa include those corporations which
grant loans to South Africa, those which engage in
trade activities with South Africa, and those
which operate subsidiary firms in South Africa.
The University Statement on Invesment Respon
sibility Concerning Endowment Securities
includes the measure that the University will seek
to eliminate "substantial social injury" caused by
a company's activities either in its capacity as
shareholder or by selling its securities in that com
pany.
Given the repressive nature and pervasiveness
of the apartheid system in South Africa, however,
any corporation conducting business in or with
South Africa is aiding in or directly causing sub
stantial social injury. These corporations
legitimize and lend credibility to the oppressive
regime, provide strategic resources to the South
African government, supply the high level tech
nology necessary for the modernization and
maintenance of government repression, and
create a revenue base for the minority regime.
In light of this and the fact that the apartheid
system pervades every aspect of life in South

Africa, it is clear that foreign corporations, rather
than helping to reform apartheid, actually bolster
the apartheid regime. Therefore, all corporations
which conduct business in or with South Africa
should begin immediate steps toward disinvest
ment. Moreover, Stanford University will take
measures to insure that this process of disinvest
ment is completed as quickly and effectively as
possible.
The measures which the University will take in
clude the following actions:
1) Immediate establishment of a moratorium on new
investments in companies conducting business in
or with South Africa.
2) Initiation of dialogue by September 1, 1987 with all
firms in the University portfolio with South Africa
links calling for disclosure of information regarding
corporate activities in South Africa and calling for
the adoption of the following measures:
a) Immediate termination of commercial activi
ties with the government of South Africa and
its security apparatus: police, military, migra
