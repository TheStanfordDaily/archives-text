# Profile in Perfection

The Texas swimming center complex in Austin is a sizable arena. There are a lot of benches, warm-up
tables and pools, press rooms, corners — places to hide.
During the three-day men's NCAA championship, viewed by approximately 2,000 spectators each night,
the mysterious whereabouts of Stanford's Pablo Morales went virtually undiscovered throughout the compe
tition. He hid well and often.
His quest for solitude, however, was not an easy one, given the media buzz over the perpetual big question:
"Do you think that you can break John Naber's record of 10 NCAA individual titles?"
Morales never really gave anyone a clear idea. "Just concentrating on race strategy and contributing to the
Stanford team title," he said after the first day.
And appropriately enough, Morales never revealed any true thoughts after the meet — he could not be
reached.
Before and during the NCAA competition, the ritual of swimming preparation unfolded.
Pre-championship meet days saw the spawnings of the Gillette razor. Morales and the rest of his
teammates shaved to a baby's softness, a condition that both physiologically and pyschologically contributes
to improved times.
Once the meet unfolded, Morales initiated his hide and go hide some more techniques.
The tension and concentration became most apparent when Morales, forced to make a public appearance,
showed at the starting blocks.
No more dark and sordid warm-up pools. No more bench corners or warm-up tables. Morales was finally in
plain view.
He began his pre-race routine with his characteristic full, deep breaths before stooping down to kick a bit
at the pool surface.
Next came the round-house arm swings followed by more deep breaths. Finally, after three days of mental
preparation and concentration. Morales let loose with one final arm exercise — an extended fist. He had bro
ken John Naber's mark, a record posted among others in the Stanford locker room thanks to Morales' four
years on the Farm.
