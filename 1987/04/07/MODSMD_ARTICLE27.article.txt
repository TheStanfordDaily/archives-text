# Sailors gain lead over Cal
## 
### HUGH BETHELL Editorial staff 
After repeatedly finding themselves outnumbered
by sailors from California this year, members of the
Stanford sailing team found power in numbers at
the seventh and eighth regattas of the Northern Cali
fornia Racing Series this weekend, as 16 Cardinal
sailors banded together to beat Cal and take the over
all lead In the series.
In the six earlier regattas, Cal had won three times
by dominating the course. While Stanford entered
one or two boats at each regatta, Cal regularly fielded
a fleet of five or six.
At this weekend s regatta in Santa Cruz, though,
the two teams were more evenly matched, with four
Cardinal boats battling five from Berkeley. Those
odds proved more favorable for Stanford, as Cardinal
sailors won both regattas and took a 4-3 series lead.
On Saturday, a building Seabreeze and rolling,
choppy seas tested the Stanford sailors, who are
more accustomed to the steady winds and puddle
flat waters of Redwood City. Still, the top Cardinal
boat, sailed by junior Drew Gashler and senior Kris
ten Boyles In the A Division, and Juniors Dan Buck
staff and Kathleen Mallery in the B Division, fought
to a one-point victory over second-place Cal.
The depth ol the Stanford team showed elsewhere
in the top five as well, as senior Tom Kuhne and
freshman Rita Snape teamed up with seniors Doug
Hagen and Glna Ottobani to take third place, and
freshman Robert Brown and sophomore Helen Willey
paired with sophomore Bill Shoemaker and junior
Jennifer Brokaw to take fourth place.
With the series tied at 3-3 after the first regatta,
the Cardinal welcomed Sunday's smoother seas and

steadier breezes and the chance to begin the second
regatta with a clean slate. In an impressively consis
tent performance, Buckstaff and Mallery. and Kuhne
and Snape captured first place, 15 points ahead of
Cal, but just two points ahead of teammates Hagen
and Ottobani, and Gashler and Boyles. who took
second place.
Stanford also captured fifth place, as senior There
duPont, fresh from a stint with the Oxford sailing
team, and freshman Kim Grose, the team's newest
member, turned in a strong performance in the A Di
vision.
"It was definitely a total team effort, with all our
sailors working together for the benefit of the team.
It was really nice to have nearly as many boats as Cal.
Instead of ganging up on one Stanford boat, they had
to deal with a number of Stanford boats that were all
doing very well, and that made It really difficult for
them. All our sailors deserve credit for the two
regatta victories," Stanford Coach Blake Middleton
said.
With new tans and renewed confidence, the team
returned to Stanford Sunday night already planning
for the Pacific Coast Championships that are sched
uled for April 25 and 26. Before that important
regatta, though, the team will try for one more North
Series victory in Regatta No. 9 at Berkeley. The Card
inal sailors hope that by sailing in that regatta, and
also practicing on those same waters at different
times in the next few weeks, they will be ready to beat
the Bears on their home waters at the champion
ships.
"The team is getting really excited about the cham
pionships. I think we'll be ready to meet and beat
however many sailors Berkeley fields," Grose said.
