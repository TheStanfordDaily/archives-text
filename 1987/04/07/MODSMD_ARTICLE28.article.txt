# Softball lakes four on the road

### 
The Stanford softball team
took to the road and raised
its record to 12-1 with a pair
of double-header sweeps of
Chlco State and Butte Col
lege last weekend.
Terri Silliman led the
Cardinal against Chico State
with three triples, and Tish
Peterson. Laura Buchanan
and Susan Watson com
bined on a defensive gem to
halt a Chlco State rally.
At Butte. Cardinal
pitchers Lisa Buchanan and
Dawn Becker struggled with
a tight strike zone all after
noon. "This team showed
me a lot." Coach Tami
Brown said. "They held to
gether and came through.
Many other teams I've seen
and coached would have
folded under similar circum
stances."
The Cardinal travels to
USF for a double-header
today at 1:30 p.m., then
hosts Santa Rosa at the
Baylands fields in Palo Alto
Friday at 1 p.m.
