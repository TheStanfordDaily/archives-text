# Western Culture course will be changed next year
## 
### LORI SILVER Staff writer 
Administrators offered conflicting explanations
yesterday for a plan to restructure the Conflict and
Change track of the Western Culture program next
year.
The primary reasons for the proposed changes In
the track are widespread complaints about an un
focused curriculum and a shortage of available fac
ulty, according to track co-chair Susan Stephens, as
sociate professor of classics.
But History Prof. Paul Robinson, chairman of the
Western Culture program, said the plans to change
the course were based entirely on a lack of available
faculty members and had nothing to do with
negative student feedback.
If the new format Is approved, the winter and
spring quarters of Conflict and Change next year will
consist of a single lecture and a pair of two-hour dis
cussion sections each week, following the format of

the Great Works track, Stephens said. Fall quarter
will continue with the course's present format of
three lectures with one two-hour discussion section
weekly.
Stephens cited the lack of integration in the track
curriculum as a major reason for the change. The
present track is so disjointed that each quarter is al
most a different course, she said.
"There has been a wide range of complaints. We
are not happy with the lack of coordination of the
three quarters," she said.
Switching to a Great Works format will help focus
the track because discussion leaders will be able to
immediately Identify and respond to student Inter
ests and concerns. Stephens said.
And Instead of relying on one faculty member to
give three lectures a week, the new format will con
sist of guest lectures by faculty from different depart
ments.
"We could go out and find new
people (to teach the track), but
that's not the best solution when
we haven't had a great success in
tegrating the course," she said.
The new format might also
feature a New World emphasis,
bringing other disciplines such as
Afro-American Studies and

Feminist Studies into the track,
according to Stephens.
However, these changes will
depend on the recommendations
made by the task force on the
Western Culture distribution re
quirement, Stephens said.
The task force, which is study
ing the controversy surrounding
the Western Culture requirement,
is due to present its solution to
the Faculty Senate this week, ac
cording to task force head Paul
Seaver, professor of history.
