# Students to phone 'pro fros'
## 
### SUSAN LINDHEIM Staff writer 
Stanford student volunteers will call prospective
freshmen next week as part of a new program to
make the admissions process more personal.
On Monday through Thursday nights, 120 Stan
ford students will call all 2,500 admitted freshmen.
Groups of 40 will call each night, beginning at 5 p.m.
"The main purpose is just to call every student and
say Welcome to Stanford', " explained Jean Fetter,
dean of Undergraduate Admissions.
"It's very different having a letter from someone in
the Admissions Office and a call from a student," she
added. "We pride ourselves in making this very per
sonal. . . . This telephone outreach is just an exten
sion of the personal touch that we give every applica
tion."
The callers will congratulate the prospective fresh
men and then answer any questions they might have
about the University or undergraduate life.
"I don't want this to be a hard sell of Stanford." Fet
ter said, adding that the purpose Is simply to aid pro
spective students in making a more informed choice
about the University.
Although other schools use similar programs,
some staffed by alumni, Fetter said the idea is new to
Stanford. But since the program Is untested. Fetter
said she can't predict what effect it might have upon

the number of students who decide to come to Stan
ford. However, she added. "I don't think It can hurt
in helping people make an Informed choice."
Presently the Admissions Office sends two letters
to each prospective freshman over a 10-day period.
There is also the "pro fro" student host program and
a two-night faculty call-in program where faculty
members accept collect calls from admitted students
to answer questions.
However, Fetter noted that these programs onty
reach a small percentage of the admitted class.
Fetter said that the new program "can work in two
different directions. The advantage is that students
are really on the spot. . . getting a sense of what it is
like to be a Stanford undergraduate." The disadvan
tage. she said, is that the callers are randomly
matched with students.
But the Admissions Office will try to have a wide
range of students manning the phones, so that spe
cific questions can be referred to people with the
greatest knowledge about the subject, Fetter said.
"I think the gesture of welcome and congratula
tions counterbalances any kind of mismatch you
might have," she said.
Most people who apply to Stanford are offered ad
mission to five or six other schools, Fetter explained.
"It's vety tough for people to make a decision. If we
can help in any way . . . then I think the job is
worthwhile."
