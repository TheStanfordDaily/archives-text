# Capitol march backs education
## 
### DIANE BISGEIER Senior staff writer 
An estimated 200 Stanford stu
dents joined about 7,000 other
marchers at the State Capitol yes
terday in a demonstration in sup
port of California education.
"The march was really positive,
and it was obvious that education
is a big problem," said junior biol
ogy major Bill King, who passed
out flyers for the march. It was
"probably the biggest statement
made by students since the Viet
nam era" in terms of numbers of
student participants, he said.
The marchers included
"parents, grandparents and
people from all ethnic groups," ac
cording to freshman participant
Mary Dillard.
Two busses transported much
of the Stanford contingent, which
left from the Oval at 6:45 a.m. A
rally was held at 9:30 and the
march began at noon. Featured
speakers included Rev. Jesse
Jackson, State Senator Art Torres
and Assemblywoman Maxlne
Waters.
Senior Ben Garcia said that
many of the protesters favored the
passage of a state senate educa
tion bill that calls for a <76 million

emergency fund to come directly
from the state general fund. The
bill was passed last week by the
California senate, but was vetoed
by Gov. George Deukmejian.
As a compromise, Deukmejian
has proposed that only *25 mil
lion be taken from the state gen
eral fund and the rest be loaned
from the State Workers' Pension
Fund. The proposal was sched
uled to go before the Senate last
night or this Thursday.
" 'Duke' is basically pushing for
this compromise, but in the past
he really pushed for cuts in educa
tion," Garcia said. "He worked for
a surplus in the general fund be
cause it looks good on his part.
This was his argument from the
last election, but the surplus came
from budget cuts in financial aid
and bilingual education."
Other goals of the march were to
emphasize ethnic studies in Cali
fornia schools and to strengthen
community colleges. "There is a
push right now to get ethnic
studies more developed and to be
a part of the American history cur
riculum," said Garcia, who ex
plained that the issue of ethnic
studies had been raised in the

educational movement of the 19605.
"There was enough support (then) to shut down
the schools" at San Francisco State University and
UC-Berkeley. said Garcia, who explained that pro
grams In African, Chlcano. native American and
Asian studies were formed as a result of the move
ment.
"The same thing occurred at Stanford and the
result was somewhat positive," Garcia said. The
Stanford reforms were limited to opening programs
in Afro-American and Chlcano studies, however, and
Garcia characterized these programs as "very under
developed."
"Stanford needs a push for more minority faculty
in order to develop these programs," he said. The
University currently has a 7 percent minority repre
sentation in the faculty.
Freshman Mary Dillard marched to gain support
for community colleges. "We felt community colleges
were important in not allowing students to be shut
out of schools. The minorities at Stanford are the
elite, and that's fine for us, but unless they are the
elite, minorities don't get out (into the world). Higher
education is important for everybody," said Dillard,
who collected funds from campus organizations for
the busses.
