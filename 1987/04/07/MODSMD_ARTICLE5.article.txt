The Stanford AIDS Education
Project, which distributed 9,000
condoms in White Plaza last quar
ter to promote the prevention of
AIDS, is holding two workshops
this week on making sex both
safer and more erotic.
"It's a very direct program," said
David Lourea, co-founder and co
director of the Sexologists' Sexual
Health Project, the group conduct
ing the workshops. "We're con
cerned about developing sexual
communication skills that can
save your life."
"The Eroticizing Safer-Sex
Workshops" will concentrate on
the distinction between safe and
unsafe sexual actions, how to dis
cuss sexually transmitted
diseases and their prevention
with sexual partners, and how to
enhance one's sex life while still
protecting one's health, he said.
They will be held tonight at 7:30
in room 204 of CERAS (Center for
Education Research at Stanford)
and Thursday night at 7:30 at the
Old Firehouse.
The workshops will be con
ducted by a team of sexologists
from the Sexologists' Sexual
Health Project, a group founded by
several faculty members of the
San Francisco-based Institute for
the Advanced Study of Human
Sexuality.

"Our goal is to teach students
that they can take responsibility
for preventing the spread of
sexually transmitted diseases and
that they can enrich their
relationships with hotter, health
ier and safer sex," said senior Ken
Ruebush, coordinator of the AIDS
Education Project.
"There's more to safer sex than
telling people not to exchange bod
ily fluids. When you stop and
think about it, dry sex doesn't
sound very comfortable, or like
much fun. This program is about
the nitty-gritty 'how-tos' of safer
sex," he said.
The workshop tonight is geared
toward heterosexual women and
men. and the one Thursday is di
rected toward gay and bisexual
men.
Lourea and the Sexologists'
Sexual Health Project have been
conducting safe-sex workshops
for gay and bisexual men since
1981. In the last four years, they
have held workshops for
heterosexuals, including
workshops at UC-Berkeley and
San Francisco State University,
and Lourea said the demand for
both workshops is rising.
When the project first started
holding these workshops for
heterosexuals, there were one or
two a year. Lourea estimates that
