## THE
						STANFORD DAILY An Independent Newspaper GSB effort praised 
### 
The Graduate School of Business (GSB)
should be congratulated for its efforts to en
courage students to enter careers in public
service.
The GSB has become one of the first busi
ness schools in the country to design a pro
gram to relieve loan debts of graduates who
take jobs in public or government service —
where the remuneration is less than for com
parable positions in the private sector. The
program will be implemented this June.
The GSB has shown a commitment to its
goal. The program not only applies to future
graduates, but to alumni as well.
The program is especially timely. Pay for
public service jobs — traditionally lower than
for equivalent jobs in the private sector —
has increased at a much slower rate over the
past several years.
In recent years, the majority of GSB
graduates have taken jobs with investment
banking or consulting firms. But trained

managers are needed to organize hunger
relief efforts, plan fund-raising projects for
non-profit groups and coordinate research
efforts in the battle against disease.
Many graduates interested in entering
careers in public service have found it neces
sary, having accumulated large loan debts
due to the cost of higher education, to take
jobs in the private sector.
The GSB program will help make that con
cern a thing of the past.
Further, because of the program, those
who would not have considered public ser
vice careers at all may do so.
Because of the pay discrepancy, fewer
highly trained individuals have entered
public service careers than the more
lucrative private sector. But, clearly, the
more talent that can be applied to the world's
problems the better. The GSB program is
certain to have a positive effect in helping
people to help each other.
