# Library opponents encounter obstacles
## 
### JOHN POLLACK Senior staff writer 
Despite last Thursday's Faculty
Senate resolution urging Stan
ford's Board of Trustees to "solicit
and carefully examine" an alter
nate. scaled-down architectural
plan for the proposed Ronald
Reagan Presidential Library, the
library's opponents still face an
uphill battle in their attempt to
have the archive relocated or
reduced in size.

News analysis

"I think we have made a firm
commitment to go forward (with
the library). It's not likely that the
commitment to the library. . . will
change," said Warren Christo
pher, chairman of the University
Board of Trustees.
Christopher, reached in Los An
geles yesterday, declined to spec
ulate on what action the trustees
might take concerning the resolu
tion, but promised that it would
be discussed at the board's next
meeting, scheduled for May 12.
The Faculty Senate resolution
calls for a relocation of the library
if, after an alternate plan has been
developed, the current design is
retained.
Charles Palm, head archivist at
the Hoover Institution and
campus liaison for the Reagan
Presidential Foundation, ex
pressed exasperation at the
resolution's passage. "The senate
has offered (the trustees) two al
ternatives. neither of which is
reasonable," he said.
The first alternative outlined in
the resolution is to reduce the li
brary's proposed size, an option
that Palm said is unacceptable to
the National Archives, the govern
ment agency that administers
presidential libraries.
The second alternative is to
"rescind a promise made publicly
to the president, one that he has
accepted." Palm said.
In an unusual appearance and
appeal at last Thursday's senate
meeting. Christopher said there is
"very little likelihood" that the
trustees will reconsider the cur
rent library plan. Referring to
Christopher's comments. Palm

said, "I take him at his word."
Several faculty members have
questioned the effect the senate
resolution — which passed by a
vote of 26-4 with five abstensions
— will have on the trustees. "I
think it will harden the (trustees')
lines," said Mechanical Engineer
ing Prof. Bob Eustls, one of the
five abstainers.
According to Eustis, the resolu
tion was unnecessary and some
what of an insult to the trustees.
Eustis, however, acknowledged
that he is "not in favor of the
Reagan Library in its current
form."
Classics Prof. Marsh McCall,
who also abstained from voting,
shared Eustis' concern with the
trustees' possible reaction to the
resolution.
Like Eustis. though. McCall ex
pressed dissatisfaction with the li
brae's current design. "The thing
is too damn big." he said.

Such criticism of the library's
current design typifies recent con
cern in the Stanford community.
Many observers feel that the
design is inappropriate for its pro
posed site in the foothills above
Junipero Serra Boulevard. Critics
claim that the archive — which
will include 10,500 square feet of
exhibit space and a 150-seat
auditorium — will be more of a
tourist attraction than a center for
scholarly research. They argue
that a facility which would serve
primarily tourists should not be
located so near the center of
campus.
Library proponents, however,
defend the current design. They
point out that the amount of
planned exhibit space is less than
that in all but two of the eight
other presidential libraries, and
maintain that an auditorium is
both necessary and traditional in
such libraries.
