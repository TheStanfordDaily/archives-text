Embassy might be torn down
WASHINGTON — President Reagan, saying he was "deeply con
cerned over the breach of security In our Moscow embassy," said
yesterday that he might order the new facility torn down if it could
not be protected from Soviet eavesdropping, and he Instructed
two boards to review security procedures at U.S. embassies
throughout the world.
The United States will not occupy our new embassy building in
Moscow unless and until I can be assured that It is safe to move
into a secure embassy environment," Reagan told reporters in the
White House briefing room. "Likewise, the Soviet Union will not
be allowed to occupy their new facility in Washington until a si
multaneous move by both countries is possible."
This has been a longstanding U.S. position, but White HoUse
spokesman Marlln Fitzwater said that Reagan's statement was In
tended to demonstrate "the president's personal involvement and
the strength of his conviction that the security question is impor
tant and has to be corrected."
House panel cuts 4 Star Wars'
WASHINGTON — President Reagan's >5.3 billion request for the
"Star Wars" space-based missile defense system in fiscal 1988 was
slashed to *3.5 billion yesterday by the House Armed Services
Committee.
The *1.8 billion cut was approved by a vote of 25-23.
Committee Chairman Les Aspin, D-Wis., said the narrow mar
gin of the committee vote suggests that the funding level will be
further reduced by the full House, which is less sympathetic to the
program than the Armed Services Committee. Aspin predicted the
House would freeze next year's funding at the current level of *3.2
billion.
The funding for "Star Wars" — or the Strategic Defense Initia
tive, as it is known officially — is part of an overall *304 billion
defense spending bill that the House Armed Services Committee is
expected to approve today. Although the president requested *312
billion for defense, the full House Is expected to limit it to this
year's level of *298 billion to conform with a budget resolution
that will pass the House later this week.
SDI less effective than thought
WASHINGTON — Weapons scientists associated with the Stra
tegic Defense Initiative (SDI) program acknowledge that the first
phase of a ballistic missile defense system would be effective
against "no more than 16 percent" of the warheads In the Soviet
arsenal at a cost of tens of billions of dollars, two Senate staff
members charged yesterday.
The assessment appeared in a 60-page report on the SDI pro
gram by James Bruce, an aide to Sen. Bennett Johnston, D-La.,
and Douglas Waller, an aide to Sen. William Proxmlre, D-Wis. The
report was intended as a response to a recent Defense Department
proposal calling for development of a system that could be
deployed as early as 1994.
The DoD proposal, which proponents said would require formal
adoption of a more permissive interpretation of the 1972 Anti-
Ballistic Missile treaty, aroused substantial criticism from
Congress and U.S. allies, and the administration decided in
February to defer a decision on the plan until later.
In their report, said to be based on classified briefings by "more
than 60 SDI scientists, engineers, project managers, and ballistic
missile defense experts," the aides said that they were unable to
gather detailed information about the design of the "near-term"
defense favored by the Pentagon.
Link sought in mysterious deaths
LONDON — When 38-year-old computer scientist David Sands'
car crashed into a derelict restaurant not long ago in the south of
England, the police reported his death as a routine traffic fatality.
Others are skeptical. For Sands was the third scientist working
for the defense contractor Marconi Ltd. to die in violent, mysteri
ous circumstances in the last six months. All three were involved
in sensitive, defense-related projects; all were apparent suicides,
and there were no witnesses to any of the deaths.
A fourth scientist, engaged in similar work at Loughborough
University in the Midlands, disappeared last January. The police
have reportedly scaled down their search, but the man's family is
talking of hiring private detectives to carry on.
Marconi Ltd. Is one of a handful of European companies directly
involved in the Reagan administration's Strategic Defense Initia
tive. a program for a space-based missile defense system. But offi
cials of the government and Marconi alike insist that none of the
victims was directly involved in the program.
The Ministry of Defense and police investigators say that they
have found no evidence of a conspiracy, yet a nation that revels in
spy stories and has produced such tellers of espionage tales as lan
Fleming and John LeCarre has found it difficult to accept the
deaths as coincidental.
War on cocaine comes to Brazil
RIO DE JANEIRO. Brazil — The South American war between
cocaine traffickers and drug enforcement officials Is spreading
into a vast new theater — Brazil. And police officials say the
country's law enforcement agencies are ill-equipped to deal with
the problem.
Increasing amounts of cocaine are being moved through this
country en route to the United States and Europe, several anti
drug experts said in recent interviews. And in the last year or so,
traffickers have begun refining significant quantities of the drug
in clandestine Brazilian laboratories.
Most raw cocaine paste and semi-refined "base" is produced
from coca leaves grown in Bolivia and Peru. Colombia has long
been the main center for the final stage of refining before the
cocaine powder is sent along smuggling routes to the United
States.
In recent years, officials have expressed fear that tighter con
trols on (he cocaine trade in Bolivia. Pem and Colombia could
result in more trafficking and refining in Brazil, and police offi
cials and foreign experts say this is now happening.
Deukmejian opens his options
SACRAMENTO — California Gov. George Deukmejian (R) ap
pears the antithesis of the California politician: colorless In a sea
of glitter, cautious In a land of flash, untelcgenlc in the media in
cubator that hatched Ronald Reagan.
But at last he is acquiring one of the colorations of others who
have sat where he sits. He thinks the rest of America should learn
more about him.
In the past two weeks, he has set himself on a course designed
to lead him beyond the insular concerns of the state capitol in
Sacramento. Just where that is. the undemonstrative chief execu
tive Is not prepared to say.
"At this stage in my life ... I would like to have available to me
down the road a number of options," he said in an Interview.
Deukmejian. 58. has been hinting broadly that he is interested
in running for a third term in 1990. after winning a record 1.7
million-vote victory over Los Angeles Mayor Tom Bradley last fall.
No California governor has succeeded at that since Earl Warren In
1950.
Friends also say he is thinking about a bid for national office
sometime In the future, although not In 1988; he's staying
neutral in the GOP presidential nomination battle.

War on cocaine comes to Brazil
RIO DE JANEIRO. Brazil — The South American war between
cocaine traffickers and drug enforcement officials Is spreading
into a vast new theater — Brazil. And police officials say the
country's law enforcement agencies are ill-equipped to deal with
the problem.
Increasing amounts of cocaine are being moved through this
country en route to the United States and Europe, several anti
drug experts said in recent interviews. And in the last year or so,
traffickers have begun refining significant quantities of the drug
in clandestine Brazilian laboratories.
Most raw cocaine paste and semi-refined "base" is produced
from coca leaves grown in Bolivia and Peru. Colombia has long
been the main center for the final stage of refining before the
cocaine powder is sent along smuggling routes to the United
States.
In recent years, officials have expressed fear that tighter con
trols on (he cocaine trade in Bolivia. Pem and Colombia could
result in more trafficking and refining in Brazil, and police offi
cials and foreign experts say this is now happening.
Deukmejian opens his options
SACRAMENTO — California Gov. George Deukmejian (R) ap
pears the antithesis of the California politician: colorless In a sea
of glitter, cautious In a land of flash, untelcgenlc in the media in
cubator that hatched Ronald Reagan.
But at last he is acquiring one of the colorations of others who
have sat where he sits. He thinks the rest of America should learn
more about him.
In the past two weeks, he has set himself on a course designed
to lead him beyond the insular concerns of the state capitol in
Sacramento. Just where that is. the undemonstrative chief execu
tive Is not prepared to say.
"At this stage in my life ... I would like to have available to me
down the road a number of options," he said in an Interview.
Deukmejian. 58. has been hinting broadly that he is interested
in running for a third term in 1990. after winning a record 1.7
million-vote victory over Los Angeles Mayor Tom Bradley last fall.
No California governor has succeeded at that since Earl Warren In
1950.
Friends also say he is thinking about a bid for national office
sometime In the future, although not In 1988; he's staying
neutral in the GOP presidential nomination battle.

Embassy might be torn down
WASHINGTON — President Reagan, saying he was "deeply con
cerned over the breach of security In our Moscow embassy," said
yesterday that he might order the new facility torn down if it could
not be protected from Soviet eavesdropping, and he Instructed
two boards to review security procedures at U.S. embassies
throughout the world.
The United States will not occupy our new embassy building in
Moscow unless and until I can be assured that It is safe to move
into a secure embassy environment," Reagan told reporters in the
White House briefing room. "Likewise, the Soviet Union will not
be allowed to occupy their new facility in Washington until a si
multaneous move by both countries is possible."
This has been a longstanding U.S. position, but White HoUse
spokesman Marlln Fitzwater said that Reagan's statement was In
tended to demonstrate "the president's personal involvement and
the strength of his conviction that the security question is impor
tant and has to be corrected."
House panel cuts 4 Star Wars'
WASHINGTON — President Reagan's >5.3 billion request for the
"Star Wars" space-based missile defense system in fiscal 1988 was
slashed to *3.5 billion yesterday by the House Armed Services
Committee.
The *1.8 billion cut was approved by a vote of 25-23.
Committee Chairman Les Aspin, D-Wis., said the narrow mar
gin of the committee vote suggests that the funding level will be
further reduced by the full House, which is less sympathetic to the
program than the Armed Services Committee. Aspin predicted the
House would freeze next year's funding at the current level of *3.2
billion.
The funding for "Star Wars" — or the Strategic Defense Initia
tive, as it is known officially — is part of an overall *304 billion
defense spending bill that the House Armed Services Committee is
expected to approve today. Although the president requested *312
billion for defense, the full House Is expected to limit it to this
year's level of *298 billion to conform with a budget resolution
that will pass the House later this week.
SDI less effective than thought
WASHINGTON — Weapons scientists associated with the Stra
tegic Defense Initiative (SDI) program acknowledge that the first
phase of a ballistic missile defense system would be effective
against "no more than 16 percent" of the warheads In the Soviet
arsenal at a cost of tens of billions of dollars, two Senate staff
members charged yesterday.
The assessment appeared in a 60-page report on the SDI pro
gram by James Bruce, an aide to Sen. Bennett Johnston, D-La.,
and Douglas Waller, an aide to Sen. William Proxmlre, D-Wis. The
report was intended as a response to a recent Defense Department
proposal calling for development of a system that could be
deployed as early as 1994.
The DoD proposal, which proponents said would require formal
adoption of a more permissive interpretation of the 1972 Anti-
Ballistic Missile treaty, aroused substantial criticism from
Congress and U.S. allies, and the administration decided in
February to defer a decision on the plan until later.
In their report, said to be based on classified briefings by "more
than 60 SDI scientists, engineers, project managers, and ballistic
missile defense experts," the aides said that they were unable to
gather detailed information about the design of the "near-term"
defense favored by the Pentagon.
Link sought in mysterious deaths
LONDON — When 38-year-old computer scientist David Sands'
car crashed into a derelict restaurant not long ago in the south of
England, the police reported his death as a routine traffic fatality.
Others are skeptical. For Sands was the third scientist working
for the defense contractor Marconi Ltd. to die in violent, mysteri
ous circumstances in the last six months. All three were involved
in sensitive, defense-related projects; all were apparent suicides,
and there were no witnesses to any of the deaths.
A fourth scientist, engaged in similar work at Loughborough
University in the Midlands, disappeared last January. The police
have reportedly scaled down their search, but the man's family is
talking of hiring private detectives to carry on.
Marconi Ltd. Is one of a handful of European companies directly
involved in the Reagan administration's Strategic Defense Initia
tive. a program for a space-based missile defense system. But offi
cials of the government and Marconi alike insist that none of the
victims was directly involved in the program.
The Ministry of Defense and police investigators say that they
have found no evidence of a conspiracy, yet a nation that revels in
spy stories and has produced such tellers of espionage tales as lan
