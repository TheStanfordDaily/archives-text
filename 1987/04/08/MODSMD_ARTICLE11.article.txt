# Afghan rebel treated at Med Center
## 
### A.J. THOMAS Staff writer 
An Afghan rebel refugee will soon undergo
leg surgery at the Stanford Medical Center
which will enable him eventually to return to
battle.
Wasil Khan Ishaqzal, 28, whose bullet
shattered left leg healed six inches shorter
than his right, is slated for a leg-lengthening
surgical procedure next week, said Dr. Donald
Nagel, professor of orthopedic surgery at the
medical center.
According to Nagel. Wasil Khan is one of 150
Afghan fighters who are being brought to U.S.
hospitals under the auspices of a congres
sionally mandated program.
Wasil Khan is the first Afghan refugee to be
treated at Stanford, a medical center
spokesperson said yesterday.
The medical center has agreed to waive the
costs of surgery and hospitalization, which
could total between *20,000 and *30,000,
Nagel said.
Nagel and the physician scheduled to per
form the operation, Dr. Walter Pyka, have
agreed to waive their professional fees as well.
Nagel said his concern is for "humanitarian
need" and not political issues. "We treat

patients." he said.
After his operation. Wasil Khan will receive
outpatient follow-up care at the medical center
for about six months. He is currently staying
with members of the Afghan community in
Oakland.
Nagel said Stanford planned to treat another
war victim, a 10-year-old Afghan boy with
shrapnel injuries, but that presently the boy
could not be found In the refugee camp where
he is believed to live.
A member of the anti-communist
Mujahldeen rebel group, Wasil Khan was
wounded 18 months ago in his home province
of Janzjan near the Soviet border. Nagel said.
No doctor was available, and local residents
tried unsuccessfully to treat his fractured leg.
Because he could no longer fight. Wasil
Khan escaped across the Afghan border into
Pakistan. At a border hospital in Peshewar,
Pakistan, he was seen by an international
team of doctors that was screening refugees to
receive treatment in the United States.
Patients chosen to come to the United States
must have received a war-related injury for
which no treatment is readily available. Nagel
said those patients with the best chances for
rehabilitation are selected.
According to Nagel, the program is coor

dlnated by a congressional task force on Af
ghanistan. Various private charity and politi
cal groups. Including the Intergovernmental
Committee on Migration and the physician
sponsored International Medical Corps, partic
ipate In the refugee medical program.
He said the government pays to bring the
patients to the United States and the ICM pays
for their transportation expenses while they
are here.
Nagel made his first trip to Afghanistan 10
years ago when he spent part of his sabbatical
working in a Kabul hospital. Last September
he went to the Afghan Surgical Hospital in Pes
hewar to help screen patients for
reconstructive surgery.
Upon his return, Nagel talked to Stanford
Hospital administrator Sheldon King about
providing free treatment for a few of the
refugees.
"If the beds are all empty and we have the
staff there. It doesn't cost much to care for
these people," Nagel said.
The surgical procedure, developed by Soviet
physicians and only recently imported to this
country, involves running fine wires through
the leg and bone and attaching them to metal
rings encircling the leg.
