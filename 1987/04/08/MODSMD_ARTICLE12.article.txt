# OPINIONS
## THE 						STANFORD DAILY An Independent Newspaper The 						Daily recommends: 
### 
Below are The Daily's recommendations
for groups requesting ASSU fee assessments
this year. Only those groups that interviewed
with The Daily were considered for endorse
ment.
Axe Committee
Amount requested: *23,836
Recommendation: YES
Each year the Axe Committee puts on the
Big Game bonfire and rally. In addition, it
supports Stanford sports in general. The
new chairman has made it clear that the un
sportsmanlike behavior that plagued some
basketball games this year will not be
repeated. The committee also plans to ex
pand its support of other sports. And next
year, the weekly spirit competition at football
games will be supplemented by a canned food
drive to help feed the hungry.
The Band
Amount requested, part I: *29,201
Amount requested, part II: *6,667
Recommendations: YES
The Stanford Band provides its creative
brand of musical entertainment to Stanford
students, faculty and alumni at home foot
ball and basketball games and other Univer
sity functions. The Band's unique style and
irreverent humor distinguish it from its
staid, boring counterparts at other univer
sities. The first part of the fee assessment
covers the Band's operating budget for next
year and the second portion of the fee re
quest will help fund the Band's preseason
trip to Colorado, where it will play at the foot
ball game and at parties for incoming fresh
men. Such trips help the Band prepare for
the upcoming fall season while giving sup
port to the team on the road. The additional
exposure will extend the Band's reputation
and provide intangible benefits to all Stan
ford students. The fee, which covers just one
sixth of the trip's cost for 100 Band mem
bers, works out to about 16 cents per stu
dent per quarter.
Black Student Union
Amount requested: *22,747
Recommendation: YES
The Black Student Union is the umbrella
organization for all black student groups on
campus. It continues to promote and sup
port the cultural and ethnic concerns of the
Stanford black community. Its annual
events, such as Kwanzaa, the Martin Luther
King Jr. rally and the Soul-to-Soul African
Dialogue series, are well-attended and well
organized. The BSU serves as a valuable
resource to the entire Stanford community
and deserves continued financial support.
The Chaparral
Amount requested: *9,333
Recommendation: YES
The Chaparral, Stanford's humor maga
zine, has been making students laugh since
1899. The last few years have seen the
Chappie get its finances in order while con
tinuing to produce a high-quality, funny
magazine. This year's joint issue with the
Harvard Lampoon was one of the best ever.
Next year the Chaparral plans to publish five
issues instead of three, including a free issue
for incoming freshmen and a parody of an
other widely circulated campus publication.
Chicanos In Public Service (ChIPS)
Amount requested: *8,307
Recommendation: YES
New this year, Chicanos in Public Service
(ChIPS) unites two long-standing campus
public service programs. Barrio Assistance
and Project Motivation. Every Saturday. Bar
rio Assistance brings children from East Palo
Alto to Stanford, where they recieve tutoring
at El Centro. Project Motivation works to in
terest disadvantaged high school students in
higher education. Combined. Project Motiva
tion and Barrio Assistance involve about 70
student volunteers and serve over 300
elementary and high school students.
The Concert Network
Amount requested, part I: *33,333
Amount requested, part II: *17,707
Recommendations: NO
The time has come to lay the Concert Net
work to rest. Three years ago students ap
proved funds for the network, a group that
promised to solve the concert problems of the
past and to be self-supporting. Since then
the Concert Network has been everything but
successful. Inefficient management, dwin
dling funds and a fiasco or two have marked
its history. Now the Concert Network wants
more money. The first fee assessment seeks
operating costs, while the second will provide
pay for an adviser as required by the Univer
sity. Neither is worth support.
KZSU
Amount requested, part I: *59,123
Amount requested, part II: *10,553
Recommendations: YES
KZSU. the campus radio station, broad
casts a variety of music, sporting contests
and public service programs. In addition, the
station gives over 150 graduate and under
graduate students each year practical experi
ence in the radio industry. The second por
tion of the campus radio station's fee request
will go toward capital expenditures and will
allow the station to buy much-needed new
equipment. KZSU provides an invaluable
service to the Stanford community.

SaLSA
Amount requested: *25,651
Recommendation: YES
SaLSA, the Stanford Latino Student Alli
ance, sponsors a wide variety of events on
campus, such as the Cinco de Mayo Dinner,
Ballet Folklorico, movie screenings and aca
demic seminars. All of these valuable cultural
and educational programs are open to the
entire Stanford community.
Speakers Bureau
Amount requested: *59,704
Recommendation: YES
The ASSU Speakers Bureau provides a vi
tal service to the Stanford community. Help
ing bring such speakers as Dr. Ruth. Nich
olas Daniloff and Jesse Jackson to campus is
no small task, and the Speakers Bureau per
forms it admirably. Next year, the bureau
plans to work even more closely with other
campus groups in getting top-notch
speakers to Stanford, a development that will
certainly lead to more and better on-campus
speakers. The bureau deserves a "Yes" vote.
Stanford Action
Amount requested: *14,467
Recommendation: NO
Stanford Action seeks money to establish
an ASSU service organization to promote ex
tracurricular opportunities at Stanford. The
idea itself is of dubious necessity: a group to
promote groups will mean another item on
the seemingly endless list of ASSU
bureaucracies. The manner in which that
idea will be implemented seems even less
worthy of student funds. Stanford Action
wants to publish a guide of extracurricular
opportunities. This as an expensive duplica
tion of a service already provided by the stu
dent directory.
The Stanford Daily
Amount requested: *42,667
Recommendation: YES
Of course we're biased, but The Daily
needs its fee request this year. The Daily has
incurred losses in the previous two years,
mostly due to the higher printing and pro
duction costs of publishing a larger newspa
per. This year, we have had to significantly
streamline operations in order to break even,
and the result has been a smaller newspaper
with less room for news, sports, photos and
features. With the money from this fee re
quest, The Daily will be able to provide more
and better coverage of the Stanford commu
nity.
Stanford-in-Government
Amount requested: *24,427
Recommendation: YES
Stanford-in-Government has been in
strumental in encouraging and aiding stu
dents to participate in government by provid
ing exposure through well-attended forums
on political events, bringing government
speakers to campus and setting up summer
intern networks in state government and in
Washington. SiG is also hoping to expand its
intern program to state government Intern
ships beyond California. SiG serves
hundreds of Stanford students in a year and
relies heavily upon student support to con
tinue its activites.
Stanford Women's Center
Amount requested: *14,989
Recommendation: YES
The Stanford Women's Center plays an im
portant role on campus. The center provides
varied programming, interesting workshops
and operates a useful information referral
service. Next year, the center plans to com
plement these excellent programs and
services with larger events, and is presently
working with other campus groups to bring
comedian/actress Lily Tomlin to campus.
The Stanford Women's Center is an out
standing resource to the Stanford commu
nity and deserves a "Yes" vote.
The Student Channel
Amount requested: *36,060
Recommendation: YES
The Student Channel's fee assessment
seeks capital for minimal equipment needs
to begin its first year of broadcasting. The
channel will utilize the University's new
SUNet system to bring programming almost
everywhere on campus. Plans include a soap
opera, news programs and the live broad
casting of sold-out campus events such as
guest speakers' appearances. In addition to
providing interesting local programming,
the channel will give students training in
television production. The Student Chan
nel's organizers are enthusiastic about
breaking new ground and have worked hard
to get help from the University and private re
sources.
Tuesday Films
Amount requested: *17,627
Recommendation: YES
The Tuesday Films series has proven to be
a successful educational and artistic film se
ries. The films are rare and diverse,
representing a wide range of cultural and ar
tistic viewpoints, and are well attended by in
ternational students as well as faculty mem
bers. Most of the films are not commercially
viable, and therefore only play at universities
or art centers. A major university like Stan
ford has a responsibility to show artistic
films.
