# Dead week the 'in' way
## 
### 
Stanford students create an image of themselves
as perfectly well-rounded students. We are all healthy
and active and prefer getting great tans to studying
even in the middle of winter quarter. Nevertheless,
we are casually brilliant in class, and contrary to the
laws of mathematics we all manage to get above the
median on all our tests. In general, we are terribly in
tellectual in a non-intellectual kind of way.

You may notice, though, that things change
during Dead Week. You can tell it is Dead Week be
cause people admit without embarrassment that
they are studying and then scream at midnight from
the horror of it all. How then do we manage to recon
cile the pleasant fiction of the ideal Stanford student
with the harsh reality of finals? Does geeking out all
week at Green to get a B- fit into this image? Cer
tainly not. To cover ourselves, we perform an elabo
rate series of rituals that promote the illusion of ef
fortless excellence even as we study our brains out.
Studying during Dead Week is something of an
art. Slinking off to a dark corner of Green is not the
Stanford way. No one can marvel at your scholastic
stamina as you lie sleeping in the cushy chairs.
Since Dead Week is the only time you can study in
public without becoming a social pariah, study in
your room — preferably with the door open. Study
ing alone is not much fun, so invite some friends and
play loud music to attract attention. Serving drinks
helps too. And when you get tired of this and decide
to go party, tell everyone how much work you have to
do and how busy you are; it makes great conversa
tion.
Sadly, Dead Week eventually comes to an end, and
then you have to actually start taking finals. During
the final itself, it is OK to be a geek. Everyone around
you is too busy to socialize anyway. However, in
those tense minutes before the test starts, you are
expected to live up to the Stanford ideal. Only
hardcores arrive 30 minutes early and flip frantically
through their notes. True Stanford students are
supposed to be more confident than this. They arrive
one or two minutes early and talk calmly about how
they haven't opened the book in three weeks and the
number of lectures they have blown off. The really
cool ones bring beer. Even as they teeter on the brink
of academic annihilation, they know that the
preservation of dignity is paramount.
Since style is so much more important than sub
stance, the trick to succeeding on finals is simply to
maintain the illusion of knowledge even as you flail

wildly. Confidence Is the key. Like a pack of vicious
dogs. TAs can smell fear. If you are taking an engi
neering test, use a black felt-tip marker and never
cross anything out. If you are writing an essay, start
from an indefensible position and argue with pas
sion and fervor. And, above all else, leave before the
test is over. Real Stanford students are too self
assured to check their answers.
Taking the test is only the warm-up for the hardest
task of all: telling your friends how you did. The best
thing to do is to simply avoid the subject, but this is
usually impossible since tradition dictates that any
dazed person stumbling back from a test gets asked
"How did you do?" If you aced it, you can't very well
say, "I aced it — even a lobotomized hamster could
have passed," because the person you are talking to
might have gotten 40 points below the median. More
important, real Stanford students are much too laid
back to be concerned about anything as trivial as
grades. Even If the test was monstrously difficult and
you managed to scrape through only because you
worked really hard all quarter, it is shameful to ad
mit this, so you are stuck again. The only proper
response is to smile enigmatically and say, "Oh, I
failed." Everyone will be in awe of your modesty.

But what if you really did fail? Well, either Dean
Fred or Dean Jean screwed up. because no one who
belongs at Stanford ever fails at anything. We don't
even get below the median. But to admit the truth
and say, "I should have gone to Berkeley — I failed"
requires more courage than most people have. You
might try something like "Well, I failed, but 1 only
studied for 15 minutes." But this is no excuse, since
real Stanford students excel without effort anyway.
Once again, the only proper response is to smile
enigmatically and say, "Oh, I failed." The beautiful
thing about this simple phrase is that no one can tell
whether you really did fail or whether you aced it and
are merely being appropriately nonchalant.
No one but the person in Old Union who hands out
grade reports has to know.

requires more courage than most people have. You
might try something like "Well, I failed, but 1 only
studied for 15 minutes." But this is no excuse, since
real Stanford students excel without effort anyway.
Once again, the only proper response is to smile
enigmatically and say, "Oh, I failed." The beautiful
thing about this simple phrase is that no one can tell
whether you really did fail or whether you aced it and
are merely being appropriately nonchalant.
No one but the person in Old Union who hands out
grade reports has to know.
