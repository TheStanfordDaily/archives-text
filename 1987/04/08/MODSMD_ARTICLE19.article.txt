## Basinger steals 'Blind Date' 
### KAIKEASEY 
What movie do I get to review?
"Blind Date." Sounds good. Who
directed it? Blake Edwards. OK,
he's a good director. Now what
should I expect? Lots of physical
humor (slapstick) and beautiful
women, like in "10" and the
"Pink Panther" series.
Well, I got what I expected —
plus a little more. "Blind Date" is
a typical Blake Edwards film,
but what sets it apart in my
mind from the others is the act
ing of the two stars, Bruce Willis
and Kim Basinger. The plot was
not bad, but not interesting,
either; it relied a bit too much
on slapstick. Willis and
Basinger, however, pull off the
slapstick with flying colors.
Willis succeeds in this film be
cause — as on "Moonlighting" —
he plays a comical yet intelligent
man who gets the job done in
his own particular idiom. He
plays Walter, an up-and-coming
L.A. businessman whose date
for an important business din
ner backs out on him. Unable to
find a suitable replacement at
such short notice, he must rely
on his brother to set him up
with a blind date.
His brother succeeds in find
ing a woman suitable to Walter's
tastes, but warns him that if he
gets her drunk she'll go "wild";
it's kind of like the "Gremlins"

do-not-feed-it-after-midnight
syndrome. Of course, Walter
falls in love with Nadia
(Basinger) at first sight — who
wouldn't? — and predictably
gets her drunk. This sets up the
plot and allows for plenty of
humor from both Willis and
Basinger.
Nadia goes "wild" by
romantically attacking Walter
while they're driving on the
freeway, "speaking frankly" in a
posh restaurant and generally
stirring up controversy and
chaos. Through all this Walter
does an admirably funny job
trying to undo Nadia's wild
stunts and antics.
At one point, Nadia accident
ally rips the pocket of Walter's
coat. He hides this mishap from
a co-worker with his menu, and
tries to find some safety pins to
put the pocket back on. His co
worker notices and questions
Walter, but before Walter can an
swer Nadia jumps in by claiming
it's "the new style" and rips the
co-worker's jacket pocket. This
may not read funny, but when
you see the comic expressions
on Willis' and Basinger's faces
during the scene you can't help
but laugh.
Not to be shown up by Nadia,
Walter performs his own devil
ish routine later in the film at a
party thrown by Nadia's friends.
He breaks out of his role as the

maligned peacemaker and goes
"wild" himself. Slamming cham
pagne, juggling blobs of tuna
and lofting olives into female
guests' exposed cleavage are just
a few of his antics. This change
is not so much one of character
as a normal progression caused
by exasperation about the date
gone awry, and Willis pulls it off
superbly.
An interesting subplot adds
some surprises to the movie
when the couple meets Nadia's
old yet still possessive boyfriend,
played psychotically by John
Laraquotte. His relentless pur
suit of Nadia helps push Walter
through his transformation and
provides cheap laughs as his car
plows through the fronts of
three buildings during his pur
suit. He also plays a big part in
the ending, but I won't give that
away. I will say that more
slapstick is involved.
What surprised me most
about the movie was viewing yet
another side of Basinger's act
ing talents. From his hilarious
acting on "Moonlighting," I
knew Willis could pull off com
edy, but I had no idea Basinger
could be so funny. I've been a big
fan of hers since "Never Say
Never Again" and her erotic role
In "9 1/2 Weeks," but I had al
ways wondered if she could
make it in a comedy role. Well,
here she answers my question.
She stole the movie with her
humor and her stunning looks.
I recommend "Blind Date" not
for the plot or for the slapstick,
but for the fine performances of
the two stars.
