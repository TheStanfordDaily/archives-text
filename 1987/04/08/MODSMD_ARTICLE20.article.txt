# Student Film Festival to be held
## 
### 
Not many Stanford students realize there is a film
making program on campus, and even fewer stu
dents have ever seen any of the films produced in the
program. This situation should be remedied tomor
row and Friday night, when the first-ever Stanford
Student Film Festival is held in Cubberley
Auditorium.
The impetus for the festival came from a commit
tee of film program alumni and current students
working under the auspices of the Department of
Communication, specifically a core group of second
year master's students. "It's something everybody
has been wanting to do for a long time, and it finally

came together this year," says graduate student El
len Bruno, one of the festival's organizers. "It's a
quiet program, and we're trying to let people know
what's going on here."
All films produced at Stanford since 1980 were eli
gible for submission, and a total of 36 films fit the
30-minutes-or-under qualification. (The festival is
intended to be a showcase for as many films as possi
ble, and it was felt that any production longer than
30 minutes would not fit into the festival format). A
panel of five judges from the area screened the sub

The first Stanford Student Film Festival will be held tomorrow and Friday nights in Cubberley Auditorium.
Among the films to be shown is Nicole Grindle's "With Clean Hands and Straight Eyes," about an Indian's
path of continued sobriety through a stronger cultural pride.
