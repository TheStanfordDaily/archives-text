# Student Film Festival to be held
## 
### 
Not many Stanford students realize there is a film
making program on campus, and even fewer stu
dents have ever seen any of the films produced in the
program. This situation should be remedied tomor
row and Friday night, when the first-ever Stanford
Student Film Festival is held in Cubberley
Auditorium.
The impetus for the festival came from a commit
tee of film program alumni and current students
working under the auspices of the Department of
Communication, specifically a core group of second
year master's students. "It's something everybody
has been wanting to do for a long time, and it finally

came together this year," says graduate student El
len Bruno, one of the festival's organizers. "It's a
quiet program, and we're trying to let people know
what's going on here."
All films produced at Stanford since 1980 were eli
gible for submission, and a total of 36 films fit the
30-minutes-or-under qualification. (The festival is
intended to be a showcase for as many films as possi

best, and of most Interest to general audiences.
Among the judges are Tom Ambrogi, acting dean
of Memorial Chapel, known for his work with media;
Stan Gibbs. an alumnus of the Stanford Film Pro
gram and a teacher at Stanford's Film and Video In
stitute; William Johnson, film critic for the Times
Tribune; and Lise Rubinstein, a graduate of Stan
ford and an independent documentary producer
based in Palo Alto.
Twenty-four films will be shown over the two
nights of the festival; with the exception of Jeff
Shank's "The Slug." which will lead off each night's

program, an entirely different program will be shown
each night. The majority of the films are documen
taries. but some works of fiction, such as Diana Ger
ber's 'Garfield Goulash." are also included.
Program alumni and faculty members have been
invited to the festival, as well as support people in the
Bay Area film community, such as film developers
and negative cutters. "We're bringing the program
together." said Bruno. She also stated that the fes
tival could become a regular event and might include
films made by students across the nation in the fu
ture.
The Stanford Student Film Festival will be held
tomorrow and Friday at 8 p.m. Each night's selec
tion is expected to run slightly over two hours; there
will also be an intermission each night. A reception
will be held at Friday evening's showing. A dona
