## Card nine busts Broncos Chitren gains eighth save backed by 15 hits 
### TOM SENF Senior staff writer 
SANTA CLARA — After being
held to five hits Sunday by USC,
the Stanford offense erupted yes
terday for 15 In the Cardinal's 7-4
victory over Santa Clara at Buck
Shaw Stadium.
The win upped Stanford's
record to 26-10 and sent the Card
inal Into this weekend's show
down with UCLA with 15 wins in
its last 17 games. The Broncos fell
to 19-18-2.
Stanford got at least one hit
from each spot In the batting or
der, and of the Cardinal's 15 hits,
14 were singles, and many were
hit either up the middle or to the
opposite field — a pleasing fact to
Stanford Coach Mark Marquess.
"Some guys we still need to work
on, but we did hit the ball well,"
Marquess said. "We went the
other way real well."
Right-hand hitting Ed Sprague
led the Cardinal attack with three
hits In five at-bats, drilling two
singles to center and another to
right. His second hit, a single to
right In the third, scored Frank
Carey, who had singled and
moved to second on a textbook
bunt single by David Esquer, with
the game's first run.
Sprague has feasted on non
conference pitching all year, hit
ting .341 with seven of his nine
homers. He is not, however,
merely a weekday hitter, as his
.340 Pacific 10 Southern Division
trails only Jeff Saenger (.400) and
Paul Carey (.347) on the team.
"He's carried it over to league,"

Marquess said. "It's not a situa
tion where he's just hit well In
midweek games. He hit the ball
well against Arizona State and
USC. He's swinging the bat well
right now, as well as he has all
year."
"I just come out and play as
hard as I can," Sprague said. "A
game Is a game to me."
The Cardinal broke It open with
a five-run, slx-hlt fourth against
Bronco starter and loser Vlnce
Fultz (3-2). Saenger started things
with a one-out walk and moved to
second on a perfect hit-and-run
single to left by Ron Witmeyer.
Carey and Esquer brought
Saenger in with groundball
singles to right, then Ruben
Amaro bounced a two-run single
up the middle.
With Esquer heading for third
on Amaro's hit, Santa Clara center
fielder Jeff Healy threw the ball
Into the Cardinal dugout, allowing
Esquer to score and Amaro to go
to third. Amaro later scored on a
passed ball.
A 1 Osuna pitched a smooth first
three innings to pick up his fifth
win of the year against two losses,
but Rob Wassenaar quickly found
himself in a bases loaded, no-out
situation in the fourth.
He got out of it, however, by fan
ning Bruce Powers (one of four K's
for Powers on the day) and induc
ing shortstop Matt Toole to hit
into a 6-4-3 double play.
The Broncos did pick up a pair
of runs against Wassenaar in the
fifth and threatened to score an
other In the sixth, but the senior
right-hander escaped a man on

third, one-out jam unscathed.
It was freshman Mark Carper's
turn to play Houdlni in the
seventh. With runners at the cor
ners and two outs. Carper set
Powers down on strikes to keep
Stanford ahead 7-2.
Santa Clara mounted another
threat in the eighth, and this one
paid dividends. With two out. Jeff
Dißono lined a two-run single to
right that brought stopper Steve
Chitren out of the Cardinal bull
pen. After Gaiy Maasberg reached
on an error to bring the tying run
to the plate, Chitren retired
cleanup hitter Troy Buckley on a
fielder's choice, then slammed the
door on the Broncos with a 1-2-3
ninth.
"They always play us tough."
Marquess said. "They had some
scoring opportunities, but we
were able to make the big pitch
when we needed to."
Chitren began the season as the
Cardinal's No. 3 starter, but the
emergence of Jim Price and the
need for a late-Inning closer put
Chitren In the bullpen about three
weeks ago. Since then, he has
succeeded In seven of seven save
situations and now has eight for
the season.
"The first couple times I felt
awkward," Chitren said. "I've al
ways been a starter, but I think
I've adjusted to it. It makes me
more aggressive."
"If he knows he's not going to be
out there as long, he may feel he
can get more aggressive with his
fastball," Marquess said.
"Whatever it is, he's taken to it
well."
Card notes
Carey's average had slipped to .245,
but the sophomore second baseman
grounded two solid singles to right
and had a long opposite field out to
left.
Not surprisingly. Jack McDowell
was named Slx-Pac Pitcher of the
Week for his two-hit, 13-strikeout
shutout of USC last Friday. McDowell
is scheduled to pitch the series opener
against UCLA on Friday at Sunken
Diamond.
