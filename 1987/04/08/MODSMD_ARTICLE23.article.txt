# Netters travel to Cal needing win
## 
### JON WEISMAN Staff writer 
It was two months ago that the Stanford
men's tennis team met California at the Na
tional Team Indoor Championships in Louis
ville, Ky. The 5-4 loss was the first of three
straight defeats that weekend that knocked
the Cardinal out of the top 10 for the first time
since 1982.
Today at Berkeley. Stanford, now out of the
top 25 with a 9-7 record, gets a chance at
revenge against the 1 lth-ranked Bears (13-7).
It should be noted, however, that the most
recent rankings do not include Stanford's last
five matches, In which the Cardinal is 3-2.
"We should move up a bit," Stanford Coach
Dick Gould said. "But we still have a lot to
prove â€” to ourselves, primarily."
Today's match begins a st ring of six matches
in 11 days for the Cardinal.
Two other things mark significant differ
ences between today's 1:30 p.m. match and

the one in Louisville. First, this match counts
in the Pacific 10 Southern Division standings,
in which Stanford is 2-2 and California is 1-3.
Second, Stanford will have Patrick McEnroe
and Mark Jacobson, who were Injured most of
February, in the lineup.
"I think that changes the complexion of the
match around completely," California Coach
Steve McCain said of McEnroe's return.
"[McEnroe's absence] had two effects. First, it
made Stanford not quite as good, obviously.
Secondly, with Patrick out, it lulled our guys to
sleep. They thought they were going to go out
and whack them."
McEnroe. No. 17 in the latest rakings. is 5-1
since his return from knee and foot injuries
and 6-3 overall. In his last match, he defeated
second-ranked Luke Jensen of USC. 7-6, 5-7,
6-4.
Jacobson. a senior from Los Altos Hills, is 5-
4 in singles this season despite losing against
both UCLA and USC. Jacobson is 7-3 in
doubles, teaming up with Scott Moody.

"I would hope we would be stronger," Gould
said. "I'm sure they're stronger, too. They've
been playing well. On paper our lineup is a
little stronger, but playing at home is a big ad
vantage for them. It's a match we're capable of
winning, but I do expect a dogfight."
Like Stanford, California was blown out
against No. 3 UCLA, with fourth-ranked Steve
DeVries scoring the Bears' only singles victory.
And like Stanford, California lost a closer
than-the-score-indicates 6-3 match to the top
ranked Trojans.
DeVries extended sixth-ranked Rick Leach
to a third set in singles, and Cal's second and
third doubles teams lost in the third set of
their matches 6-4 and 7-6, respectively.
Besides DeVries, the Bears have the nation's
15th and 52nd-ranked players in Woody Hunt
and Kurt Streeter, along with two of the na
tion's top-10 doubles teams.
Stanford freshman Jeff Tarango (17-4) is
ranked 23rd in singles, while Jeff Cathrall and
Eric Peus (12-5) are the No. 43 doubles team.
