# Ennis leads QB hopefuls as spring football begins
## 
### KEN STEVENS Senior staff writer 
While yesterday marked
opening day for many major

league baseball teams, it also
marked the opening of spring
practice for the Stanford football
team.
And though it is only practice.

the spring season is crucial for
many of the Cardinal players.
"Spring's basically a time to
earn jobs." center Andy Sinclair
said.
Sinclair, an honorable men
tion All-America performer in
1986, need not worry about his
job, but several positions are
open and the competition began
yesterday.
Most notable of the openings
is the quarterback spot, which
was John Paye's for the past
four seasons. Greg Ennis, who
replaced Paye in the Cardinal's
27-21 Gator Bowl loss last De
cember, is the front-runner to
be the starter come next Sep
tember, but he will have to beat
out redshirt freshman Scott
Stark.
"Jack (head coach Elway) said
today that every job's open." En
nis said yesterday.
The Cardinal players had no
trouble breaking a sweat yester
day. as the soaring tempera
tures greeted them on the
practice field. "It was hot,"
Sinclair said. "But it was fun."
In addition to being a time
when starting jobs are won. the
spring is also a period when the
players work on conditioning
and improving their skills.
"There's more contact in the
spring than in the fall
(practices)," Sinclair said. "I'm
basically trying to become a bet
ter player â€” working on the fine
tuning."
"We went through quite a bit
of the offense today," Ennis
said. "We're not changing
much."
The spring practice will last
five weeks, concluding May 9
with the traditional Card
inal/White Game at Stanford
Stadium at 10 a.m. The team
will scrimmage each Saturday,
with the exception of April 25,
when there will be no practice.
