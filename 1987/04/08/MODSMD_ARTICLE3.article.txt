# People's Platform backs progressive agenda
## Platform makes ASSU picks 
### FRANK QUARATIELLO Staff writer 
The People's Platform last night for
mally endorsed "The Plan" slate for
Council of Presidents in next week's
ASSU spring election. The platform, a
coalition of students who support a poli
tical agenda promoting the rights and
interests of minorities and other pro
gressive issues, also made endorse
ments for Senior Class Presidents and
candidates for ASSU Senate.
If the slates and candidates accept the
endorsements, each of them will be ex
pected to uphold the tenets of the
People's Platform, which include in
creases in funding for ethnic studies
and community centers as well as sup
port for more general Issues such as

total divestment from South Africa.
For undergraduate senate, the
People's Platform voted to endorse
juniors Stacey Leyton and Brett
Mahoney, sophomores Lilian Hirales,
Jon Inda, Miguel Marquez and Jeff Mar
shall and freshmen Jason Dominguez,
Gina Harrison, Derick Lin and Daniel
Luna.
In the graduate race for the senate,
the platform endorsed Richard Vaughan
and Don Gagliardi.
For the first time, slates in the Senior
Class Presidents race approached the
People's Platform for endorsement. The
platform voted to endorse the "Slate of
'88" made up of Maria Meier, Eric Pros
nitz, Paige Mazzoni and Stuart Levy.
"We were concerned (about whether
we'd get the endorsement), but we really

felt that we were the most qualified,"
said sophomore Julie Martinez, one of
four members of The Plan COP slate.
"I think that the support of the
People's Platform will be helpful," added
Martinez, who is joined on The Plan
slate by juniors Lori Abert and Eric Allen
and sophomore Ira "Tripp" Williams.
The different minority and progressive
groups that make up the People's Plat
form have come together in the past and
have achieved much through their
unity, Martinez said.
"The People's Platform is really
growing in political power," said Felix
Cuevas, a People's Platform campaign
coordinator. "A lot more people sought
endorsement this year than last year."
Different minority communities
are very supportive of the People's
Platform, because they know that
it represents a diverse populace
and that its candidates are more
responsible to the students.
Cuevas said. More minorities and
progressive whites are running
this year because the People's Plat

form has given them more of a
sense of having potential for
change, according to Cuevas.
"[A People's Platform endorse
ment] makes a big difference,"
Cuevas said. "Out of nine people
that we endorsed last year (when
the group was started), seven of
them were elected and five were
elected to voting positions."
"It's an interesting concept."

who is not a member, said of the
