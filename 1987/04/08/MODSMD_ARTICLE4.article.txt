### MONIQUE SCHEER Senior staff writer 
This is the third in a series of
articles this week on the issues
and candidates that will appear
on the ASSU spring election bal
lot.
The "Philosopher Kings" are
taking a light-hearted, or what
they call "down-to-earth, ap
proach to the race for ASSU Coun
cil of Presidents (COP).

EIassu Elections
1987

Juniors Steve Baer, Greg
Carlson, Wayne Cooperman and
Darren Schneider have devised a
campaign that Is something less
than serious, although Baer
claims "we're not like the
Chappies."
The four candidates, all mem
bers of the Kappa Alpha fraternity,
say they are serious about chang
ing the Image of the ASSU and
making the COP more visible.
Claiming that the current COP

is not readily available to talk to
students, the members of the Phi
losopher Kings slate plan to be out
on the green bench in front of
Tresidder Union regularly to make
themselves more accessible to stu
dents who want to voice their
opinions on campus issues.
"It's more the attitude, not the
issues," Baer said.
"We're more enjoyable to work
with." Cooperman added, saying
that this congeniality would
"create confidence in the senate
because we won't be a bore or a
burden."
None of the members of the slate
has had any ASSU experience or
any experience working with the
University Administration, but
they feel this fact will make them
less reluctant to try new ap
proaches. "We'll catch on right
away . . . and we'll question some
things." Schneider said.
Some of the slate's new ideas in
clude a concept they call "parking
anarchy," which Cooperman
defined as "the students' rights to
park wherever they want without
being harrassed by Nazis driving

souped-up scooters handing out
tickets."
The four candidates also plan to
reform the University's property
damage policy, create all-night
study areas, change calendar and
Dead Week policies, and find a
way to require the study of women
and minorities outside of the
Western Culture track.
The four men, three of whom
are Jewish, are not concerned by
the slate's lack of racial diversity.
"We have geographic diversity."
Cooperman said, noting that the
individual members of the slate
come from Oregon, Indiana, New
Jersey and California.
Schneider, referring to himself
as "the guy (on the slate) who's
going to keep everyone else realis
tic." said the real reason for not
having a minority representative
on their slate was to avoid includ
ing "token people" simply to
garner votes.
"It would be condescending to
include a minority just to include
a minority," Cooperman said. "We
want people we work well with."
Baer, a junior in economics, has
been Involved In entrepreneurial
activities, starting Student
Services Integrated, an organiza
tion that sells telephones and
phone book covers on campuses
In California and Indiana. He Is
currently philanthropy chairman
for the Kappa Alphas.
Carlson, a junior in political sci
ence and economics, works at
Meyer Library.

Cooperman. also a junior In po
litical science and economics, is a
disc jockey at KZSU and social
chairman for the KAs.
Schneider, a junior in biology,
devotes time to pre-med activities,
and last year was sports editor for
the Quad. He Is currently the KA
Rush chairman and alumni repre
sentative.
Baer pointed out that the Phi
losopher Kings. If elected, would
have no trouble finding time to
carry out their plans for the ASSU.
"Three out of four of us are eco
nomics majors, so we'll have
plenty of time to devote to the job,"
he explained.
