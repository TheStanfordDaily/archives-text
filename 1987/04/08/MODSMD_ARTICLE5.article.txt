# University divests of over $1 million
## SCIR votes to sell USX holdings 
### MARK LAWRENCE Senior staff writer 
The Board of Trustees' Special Commit
tee on investment Responsibility (SCIR)
decided last week to sell more than *1 mil
lion of Stanford stock in USX Corp., charg
ing that the company has refused to provide
the trustees with detailed information on
its operations in South Africa.
The decision, which was announced yes
terday, marked Stanford's second-largest
divestiture to date. Since October, the Uni
versity has sold almost *6 million of stock
in companies that the trustees decided
were not adequately promoting racial
equality In South Africa.
Stanford owns 35,839 shares of USX
valued at $1,048,291, according to Mon
day's stock prices. The divestment, once
carried out, will leave Stanford with about
$169 million of investments in 63 compan
ies that do business in South Africa.
In a series of telephone meetings the

SCIR held last week, the committee also
decided not to vote on shareholder resolu
tions sponsored by Goodyear Corp. and
NCR Corp. concerning their continued op
eration in South Africa.
The SCIR's decisions are final and do not
need approval of the full board, which had
delegated investment decisions to the com
mittee.
The Committee on Investment Responsi
bility (CIR), the 12-member panel of faculty,
staff, students and alumni that advises the
SCIR, had recommended that Stanford vote
to urge Goodyear and NCR to withdraw
from South Africa.
But after reviewing the ClR's recommen
dation, the SCIR failed to find "clear and
conclusive evidence" that Goodyear or NCR
have been destructive influences in South
Africa, according to a report released yester
day by the SCIR.
The SCIR added in the report, however.
that it Is concerned about
Goodyear's performance in South
Africa. The trustee committee said
it will convey its reservations to
the company's management and
ask for a clarification of the com
pany's policies on combating
apartheid.
CIR Chairman Frederick Hillier
said he is disappointed with the

trustees' decisions not to vote on
the two resolutions. But he called
the decision to request more infor
mation from Goodyear "a positive
step."
The SCIR said in the report that
its selective divestment policy is
based on the principle that "there
is a compelling need for American
companies in South Africa to
work strongly for change while
they are there" and that compan
ies "unwilling or unable to commit
significant resources and energy
to combat the effects of apartheid

and to work for its elimination
should be asked to disengage from
South Africa."
The SCIR also decided last week
to abstain on a withdrawal resolu
tion sponsored by American Tele
phone and Telegraph concerning
one of its South African Interests,
Olivetti. The SCIR agreed with the
CIR that too little information is
available on the Italian company's
operations in South Africa to eval
uate whether the company should
withdraw.

In a report on its decision to
divest of USX stock, the SCIR said
it had repeatedly asked the com
pany for information about the ra
cial policies of its South African
affiliates. At its December 1986
meeting, the trustees decided to
divest if USX. formerly U.S. Steel,
did not provide the information
before March 31 or decide to
withdraw from South Africa as
soon as possible.
The company did not respond to
Stanford's requests.

The trustee committee decided
on USX without any recommenda
tion from the CIR. which had rec
ommended all of the trustees' pre
vious divestment decisions.
Stephen Peeps, director of Uni
versity Public Relations, said the
divestiture is "highly significant"
because it shows that the SCIR
will take up divestment issues on
its own, without prompting from
the CIR.
"This decision shows that the
SCIR doesn't need to rely exclu
sively on the CIR." said Peeps.

whose office organizes trustee
meetings. "It Is the first time the
board has on Its own proposed a
divestment action not because of
the concern of the CIR or any
other part of the Stanford commu
nity."
The CIR is preparing a new set
of divestment guidelines that it
will submit to the SCIR at its May
meeting, according to Hillier. pro
fessor of operations research. He
said neither committee will con
sider any new divestment deci
sions until then.
