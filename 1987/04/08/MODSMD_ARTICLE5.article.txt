# University divests of over $1 million
## SCIR votes to sell USX holdings 
### MARK LAWRENCE Senior staff writer 
The Board of Trustees' Special Commit
tee on investment Responsibility (SCIR)
decided last week to sell more than *1 mil
lion of Stanford stock in USX Corp., charg
ing that the company has refused to provide
the trustees with detailed information on
its operations in South Africa.
The decision, which was announced yes
terday, marked Stanford's second-largest
divestiture to date. Since October, the Uni
versity has sold almost *6 million of stock
in companies that the trustees decided
were not adequately promoting racial
equality In South Africa.
Stanford owns 35,839 shares of USX
valued at $1,048,291, according to Mon
day's stock prices. The divestment, once
carried out, will leave Stanford with about
$169 million of investments in 63 compan
ies that do business in South Africa.
In a series of telephone meetings the

SCIR held last week, the committee also
decided not to vote on shareholder resolu
tions sponsored by Goodyear Corp. and
NCR Corp. concerning their continued op
eration in South Africa.
The SCIR's decisions are final and do not
need approval of the full board, which had
delegated investment decisions to the com
mittee.
The Committee on Investment Responsi
bility (CIR), the 12-member panel of faculty,
staff, students and alumni that advises the
SCIR, had recommended that Stanford vote
to urge Goodyear and NCR to withdraw
from South Africa.
But after reviewing the ClR's recommen
dation, the SCIR failed to find "clear and
conclusive evidence" that Goodyear or NCR
have been destructive influences in South
Africa, according to a report released yester
day by the SCIR.
The SCIR added in the report, however.
