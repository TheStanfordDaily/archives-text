# Workshop targets heterosexuals
## 'Safe sex' promoted

"We need to go from carefree hedonism to
responsible hedonism," said sexologist
David Lourea, setting the tone for last
night's safe sex workshop for he
terosexuals.
Somber warnings alternated with adven
turous glee as Lourea and five other
sexologists showed approximately 100
people gathered in CERAS how to avoid
sexually transmitted diseases, particularly
AIDS, and still enjoy great sex.
"If you have been a lazy, boring lover, safe
sex will be frightening. If you have been a
creative, caring lover, safe sex will just be
another challenge,'' said Lourea, a co
founder and co director of the Sexologists'
Sexual Health Project, the group leading the
workshop.
The key to making safe sex erotic —
rather than merely "better than no sex at

all," as one workshop participant character
ized it — is to use condoms, lubricants and
spermicides as sex toys and to stretch the
definition of sex to include more than ac
tual intercourse, according to the
sexologists.
They outlined which sexual actions are
safe and which are not. Vaginal intercourse
with a condom is probably safe, as is oral
sex with a condom and oral sex with a rub
ber dam, they said. A rubber dam is a thin
square of latex used to cover the vulva to
prevent the transmission of vaginal fluids
during oral sex. It Is also called a dental
dam and can be found in dental hygiene
stores. The same actions without a condom
or rubber dam are unsafe. Anal sex with a
condom is probably safe, but without a con
dom is one of the most unsafe practices.
Body massage and sensual bathing is safe.
Using a diaphragm, spermicide and a
condom is probably the safest way
to have vaginal intercourse.
Abstinence is the surest way to
avoid sexually transmitted

diseases, but Lourea emphasized
that abstinence is not always
practical and can lead to a damag
ing pattern of behavior.
"The danger with abstinence is
that it can be a way of avoiding the
issue. And it works only when it's
really practiced," Lourea said
during a break in the program.

People can fall into a binge/purge
pattern in which they alternately
abstain from sex for fear of disease
and engage in sex with their old,
unsafe behaviors when the temp
tation becomes too great, he said.
"The reality is that we need to
learn how to use sex in a respon
sible way. Abstinence which isn't

carefully thought out is, in my
professional opinion, a high-risk
activity," Lourea said.
Monogamy isn't necessarily safe
either. Sixty percent of
monogamous couples are not ac
tually monogamous, with one
partner engaging in extracurric
ular sex without the knowledge of

the other, according to Clark
Taylor, sexologist and co-founder
of the Sexologists' Sexual Health
Project.
Champagne, whipped cream,
mangos and bananas were dis
played as props to increase
eroticism during non-intercourse
sex activity.

Lubricants with names like
Slip, Rub Down and Probe were
passed around to be felt and
tasted.
Feathers, a horsetail fly swatter
and a feather duster were demon
strated as toys to stretch the
limits of sensuality.
