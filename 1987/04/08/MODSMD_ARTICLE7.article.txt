# New tax laws complicate April deadline scramble
## 
### MORTY POSNER Editorial staff 
Although the deadline for filing your
1986 federal income tax form is a week
away, changes in the tax law will make stu
dent tax returns substantially different
next year.
College students will find that in 1987,
exemptions and deductions that existed
previously will be eliminated. Predominant
among these changes is the loss of the per

sonal exemption for students who are
claimed as dependents on their parents'
return.
In the 1986 return, parents receive a
® 1,080 deduction for each dependent and
students may claim the same amount as a
personal exemption. Next year, the deduc
tion will be • 1,900, but students will not be
able to claim the exemption if their parents
claim them as dependents.
