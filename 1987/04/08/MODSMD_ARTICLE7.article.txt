# New tax laws complicate April deadline scramble
## 
### MORTY POSNER Editorial staff 
Although the deadline for filing your
1986 federal income tax form is a week
away, changes in the tax law will make stu
dent tax returns substantially different
next year.
College students will find that in 1987,
exemptions and deductions that existed
previously will be eliminated. Predominant
among these changes is the loss of the per

sonal exemption for students who are
claimed as dependents on their parents'
return.
In the 1986 return, parents receive a
® 1,080 deduction for each dependent and
students may claim the same amount as a
personal exemption. Next year, the deduc
tion will be • 1,900, but students will not be
able to claim the exemption if their parents
claim them as dependents.
The new tax reform will require
parents to provide the Social Se
curity number of their dependent
children on their return and vice
versa. In this way, the Internal
Revenue Service can crack down
on compliance by cross-checking
the returns of families.
Because dependent students
will effectively have more taxable
income, many will find that they
are also no longer exempt from
federal withholding and will have
to update their W-4 form, which
also changes this year.
"We're going to find a lot of
people who claim exempt . . . who
have to pay taxes." said Sally
Schwerln, manager of the Palo
Alto office of tax preparer H&R
Block. Schwerln warned that the
IRS imposes a >500 fine on those
who claim to be exempt when they
are not.
The W-4 form, which helps
employers to calculate federal
withholding, was revised by the
IRS this year, only to result in a
new form that was much more
complicated than the old one. A
third, simplified version is now
becoming available. No matter

which form you fill out (either the
new complex form or the new
simplified form) you must fill out a
new form by October.
Fortunately for students,
"unless you really have an involved
tax return," said Schwerln. the W
-4 will be relatively simple to com
plete.
With regard to financial aid.
students are again the losers as
the deductibility of interest on
education loans will be phased out
gradually during the next four
years. This will not affect the
majority of undergraduate stu
dents who do not qualify to
itemize deductions, however. Pre
viously. interest on loans was de
ductible In full.
Teaching assistants and re
search assistants are also losers if
they are earning financial aid. Fel
lowships and assistantships for
which work is performed will be
taxed.
Attorney Mark Franich. who
advises students through the
ASSU Legal Couseling service,
warns that students who are earn
ing money In this way need to
report it because "the IRS likes to
look Into these sorts of arrange
ments." Outright academic
scholarships will not be taxed in
the future if they are designated
for specific expenditures, such as

tuition or books. Schwerin said
schools will react to this by simply
indicating what financial aid is to
be used for so that it will be tax
exempt for students.
Although most students do not
qualify to itemize deductions on
their returns, charitable contribu
tions may be deducted in full in
1986 even if you do not itemize.
Next year, charitable deductions
for non-itemizers will be
eliminated. In addition, travel as a
form of education will no longer be
a legitimate deduction and the
deduction for credit-card interest
paid during the year is being
phased out.
The filing deadline for federal
returns is a week from today.
Schwerin said she expects her of
fice will see its biggest rush of
filers this week. The changes in
the tax law will cause confusion,
Schwerin predicted,
"I generally suggest that
[students) do [their tax returns]
themselves," said Franich. "Most
students don't have complicated
legal or accounting problems."
Franich emphasized that
"Stanford students in particular
should be able to fill it out."
Schwerin likened her office's
rush close to the filing deadline to
finals: "You work really hard and
then it's over."
