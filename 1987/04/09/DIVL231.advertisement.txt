Sponsor Statement:
"Each trade agreement, each bank loan, each new investment is another brick in the wall of
our continued, existence."
-J 3. Vorster, former Prime Minister of South Africa
This referendum asks the Board of Trustees to discuss and vote on total divestment.
Though there have been repeated shows of student support for total divestment for over the
past twenty years, the Trustees have never taken a public vote on total divestment.
Since the 1960'5, students have been calling for the divestment of stock from all
corporations who are doing business in South Africa. In 1977, 300 students were arrested in
Old Union for divestment In recent years, students have used tactics ranging from polite
lobbying to sit-ins to try to persuade the Board of Trustees to divest. In the 1986 ASSU
Spring Election, students voted by a two-to-one margin for total divestment.
Total divestment is a means to pressure corporations to pull out of ("disinvest from") South
Africa (this means completely pulling out, unlike the recent incomplete IBM and GM
disinvestments). As J.B. Vorster admits, corporate involvement strengthens apartheid
because companies pay taxes to South Africa, sell products critical to the strength of the South
African economy (such as computers and automobiles), and by law must provide their
services and products to the South African military in an emergency situation. Disinvestment
withdraws this support and weakens apartheid.
Polls of Black South Africans consistently show that they favor disinvestment, as do
prominent anti-apartheid leaders such as Nelson Mandela and Bishop Desmond Tutu. While
the apartheid regime may claim to know what's best for Black South Africans better than
Black South Africans themselves, Stanford should listen to their voice and divest.
Because of these reasons, many universities have voted for total divestment, including
Columbia and the entire University of California system. Other public entities such as New
York City and the state of California have also decided to divest.
Yet how seriously have the Trustees taken the students' position on total divestment? In
spite of all of our efforts and concern, they have yet to take a public vote on the issue of total
divestment. SOSA has written a proposal for divestment, endorsed by the ASSU Senate,
which outlines clear steps under a reasonable timeline. Even if you don't necessarily support
divestment you should vote "yes" on the referendum, because the Board of Trustees should at
least respect sutdent opinion enough to consider the proposal.
