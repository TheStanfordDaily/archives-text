Stanford Out of South Africa
(SOSA)
Proposal for Changes in Stanford Uni
versity Investment Policy
March 1987
1.) Criteria and timetable for divestment:
Proposed amendment to the Univer
sity Statement on Investment Respon
sibility Concerning Endowment
Securities
Insert section 2.5:
2.5 Investments in Corporations Conduct
ing Business in or with South Africa
Corporations conducting business in
or with South Africa include those
corporations which grant loans to
South Africa, those which engage in
trade activities with South Africa, and
those which operate subsidiary firms
in South Africa.
The University Statement on Inves
ment Responsibility Concerning En
dowment Securities includes the
measure that the University will seek
to eliminate "substantial social injury"
caused by a company's activities either
in its capacity as shareholder or by sel
ling its securities in that company.
Given the repressive nature and
pervasiveness of the apartheid system
in South Africa, however, any corpo
ration conducting business in or with
South Africa is aiding in or directly
causing substantial social injury.
These corporations legitimize and
lend credibility to the oppressive
regime, provide strategic resources to
the South African government, supply
the high level technology necessary for
the modernization and maintenance of
government repression, and create a
revenue base for the minority regime.
In light of this and the fact that the
apartheid system pervades every
aspect of life in South Africa, it is clear
that foreign corporations, rather than
helping to reform apartheid, actually
bolster the apartheid regime.
Therefore, all corporations which con
duct business in or with South Africa
should begin immediate steps toward
disinvestment. Moreover, Stanford
University will take measures to
insure that this process of disinvest
ment is completed as quickly and ef
fectively as possible.
The measures which the University
will take include the following actions:
1) Immediate establishment of a
moratorium on new investments in
companies conducting business in or
with South Africa.
2) Initiation of dialogue by September 1,
1987 with all firms in the University
portfolio with South Africa links calling
for disclosure of information regarding
corporate activities in South Africa and
calling for the adoption of the following
measures:
a) Immediate termination of com
mercial activities with the gov
ernment of South Africa and its
security apparatus: police, mili
tary, migration control, influx
control regulation.
b) Immediate termination of opera
tions of subsidiary firms in South
Africa.
Response to these inquiries and this
call for disinvestment by the University
will be expected by January 1, 1988.

If corporations agree to adopt the
measures outlined above by January 1,
1988, then the University will lift its
moratorium on investments in these
corporations. Failure to adopt the
measures outlined within a reasonable
period of time will result in reinstate
ment of the moratorium and initiation
of divestment procedures.
If corporations refuse to adopt the
measures outlined above by January 1,
1988, then the University will immedi
ately begin to enact procedures for di
vestment of its securities in these
corporations. Divestment from these
corporations will be completed by Jan
uary 1, 1989.
Corporations that refuse to disclose
adequate information concerning their
South Africa operations or that fail to
provide a response to the University's
inquiries by January 1, 1988 will be
considered to have refused to adopt the
measures outlined above, and the Uni
versity will begin to enact procedures
for divestment of its securities in these
corporations.
The University will also act in concert
with other colleges and universities in or
der to communicate its concern to and
amplify its leverage on corporations as
well as on United States policy makers.
Additional actions may also be appro
priate to pressure and insure corporate
disinvestment from South Africa. Univer
sity action is not limited to the measures
listed above.
2.) Mechanism for divestment
The Commission on Investment Re
sponsibility (CIR) will immediately begin
researching the South Africa activities of

corporations in the University portfolio.
They will also initiate dialogues with these
corporations by September 1, 1987, call
ing for disinvestment from South Africa
and for the adoption of the measures out
lined above.
This dialogue will take place between
University administrators, corporate offi
cials, and the Boards of Directors of these
corporations. Response to the Univer
sity's inquiries and call for disinvestment
will be expected by January 1, 1988.
The CIR will then insure that the Uni
versity enact procedures for divestment
from corporations which by January 1,
1988 have not disclosed adequate infor
mation concerning their South Africa
operations, have refused to respond to the
University's inquiries, or have not
adopted the measures outlined above.
This divestment process is to be com
pleted by January 1, 1989. The CIR will
also actively monitor and evaluate the ac
tivities of those corporations which have
agreed to adopt the measures set forth by
the University regarding operations in
South Africa to insure compliance with
the measures outlined above.
3.) Additional Changes in University In
vestment Policy
1) Establishment of an open Univer
sity investment policy to include
monthly publication of University
portfolio transactions, beginning May
1987.
2) Establishment of a Re-investment
Planning Commission, which in
cludes student representation with
full membership, to investigate so
cially responsible investment alter
natives for the University portfolio.

Stanford Out of South Africa
(SOSA)
Proposal for Changes in Stanford Uni
versity Investment Policy
March 1987
1.) Criteria and timetable for divestment:
Proposed amendment to the Univer
sity Statement on Investment Respon
sibility Concerning Endowment
Securities
Insert section 2.5:
2.5 Investments in Corporations Conduct
ing Business in or with South Africa
Corporations conducting business in
or with South Africa include those
corporations which grant loans to
South Africa, those which engage in
trade activities with South Africa, and
those which operate subsidiary firms
in South Africa.
The University Statement on Inves
ment Responsibility Concerning En
dowment Securities includes the
measure that the University will seek
to eliminate "substantial social injury"
caused by a company's activities either
in its capacity as shareholder or by sel
ling its securities in that company.
Given the repressive nature and
pervasiveness of the apartheid system
in South Africa, however, any corpo
ration conducting business in or with
South Africa is aiding in or directly
causing substantial social injury.
These corporations legitimize and
lend credibility to the oppressive
regime, provide strategic resources to
the South African government, supply
the high level technology necessary for
the modernization and maintenance of
government repression, and create a
revenue base for the minority regime.
In light of this and the fact that the
apartheid system pervades every
aspect of life in South Africa, it is clear
that foreign corporations, rather than
helping to reform apartheid, actually
bolster the apartheid regime.
Therefore, all corporations which con
duct business in or with South Africa
should begin immediate steps toward
disinvestment. Moreover, Stanford
University will take measures to
insure that this process of disinvest
ment is completed as quickly and ef
fectively as possible.
The measures which the University
will take include the following actions:
1) Immediate establishment of a
moratorium on new investments in
companies conducting business in or
with South Africa.
2) Initiation of dialogue by September 1,
1987 with all firms in the University
portfolio with South Africa links calling
for disclosure of information regarding
corporate activities in South Africa and
calling for the adoption of the following
measures:
a) Immediate termination of com
mercial activities with the gov
ernment of South Africa and its
security apparatus: police, mili
tary, migration control, influx
control regulation.
b) Immediate termination of opera
tions of subsidiary firms in South
Africa.
Response to these inquiries and this
call for disinvestment by the University
will be expected by January 1, 1988.

If corporations agree to adopt the
measures outlined above by January 1,
1988, then the University will lift its
moratorium on investments in these
corporations. Failure to adopt the
measures outlined within a reasonable
period of time will result in reinstate
ment of the moratorium and initiation
of divestment procedures.
If corporations refuse to adopt the
measures outlined above by January 1,
1988, then the University will immedi
ately begin to enact procedures for di
vestment of its securities in these
corporations. Divestment from these
corporations will be completed by Jan
uary 1, 1989.
Corporations that refuse to disclose
adequate information concerning their
South Africa operations or that fail to
provide a response to the University's
inquiries by January 1, 1988 will be
considered to have refused to adopt the
measures outlined above, and the Uni
versity will begin to enact procedures
for divestment of its securities in these
corporations.
The University will also act in concert
with other colleges and universities in or
der to communicate its concern to and
amplify its leverage on corporations as
well as on United States policy makers.
Additional actions may also be appro
priate to pressure and insure corporate
disinvestment from South Africa. Univer
sity action is not limited to the measures
listed above.
2.) Mechanism for divestment
The Commission on Investment Re
sponsibility (CIR) will immediately begin
researching the South Africa activities of

corporations in the University portfolio.
They will also initiate dialogues with these
corporations by September 1, 1987, call
ing for disinvestment from South Africa
and for the adoption of the measures out
lined above.
This dialogue will take place between
University administrators, corporate offi
cials, and the Boards of Directors of these
corporations. Response to the Univer
sity's inquiries and call for disinvestment
will be expected by January 1, 1988.
The CIR will then insure that the Uni
versity enact procedures for divestment
from corporations which by January 1,
1988 have not disclosed adequate infor
mation concerning their South Africa
operations, have refused to respond to the
University's inquiries, or have not
adopted the measures outlined above.
This divestment process is to be com
pleted by January 1, 1989. The CIR will
also actively monitor and evaluate the ac
tivities of those corporations which have
agreed to adopt the measures set forth by
the University regarding operations in
South Africa to insure compliance with
the measures outlined above.
3.) Additional Changes in University In
vestment Policy
1) Establishment of an open Univer
sity investment policy to include
monthly publication of University
portfolio transactions, beginning May
1987.
2) Establishment of a Re-investment
Planning Commission, which in
cludes student representation with
full membership, to investigate so
cially responsible investment alter
natives for the University portfolio.
