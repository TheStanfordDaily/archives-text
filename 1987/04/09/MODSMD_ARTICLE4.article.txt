There once were four people who thought they could
do a great job on the COP. Luckily (at least they felt
so) they found each other and decided to run. But what
would they call their slate?
You see they wanted their name to reflect who they
were and what they stood for. They were qualified for
the job. Two had been on the Senate, one as Deputy
Chair. One helped run Orientation and was involved
with community service, another ran the Pro-Fro pro
gram and was a Daily editor. They were all also in
volved in many other activities which put them in touch
with a lot of people in the community. But what name
could reflect all that?
They knew of course that no slate of four people
could represent every interest on the campus. They also
knew though that they had open minds and a genuine
sensitivity (intellectual and emotional) to the issues.
They felt that the ASSU was for all students and they
wanted to show that in their name. But what name?
They thought a lot about the issues. They saw that
student's interests fall into two categories: those of stu
dents with special common concerns (student groups)
and those of the student body as a whole. They thought
of ways to help the ASSU reach those people: through
visibility of the COP. through student surveys, and
through having individual representatives to student
groups. There were specific issues they wanted to
pursue which they felt were student concerns. They
wanted a more vigorous recruitment of minority pro
fessors and students and a larger commitment to Ethnic
Studies Programs. They wanted to simplify the funding
process for student groups and to deaden Dead Week.
They felt the athletic facilities should be upgraded and
extended and that Tresidder should be made more
responsive to student needs. They also wanted to ex
tend ASSU projects to meet student needs and to ex
plore the possibilities of the ASSU serving a social
function. In short they wanted all students to know that
there could be people on the COP who were excited
about responding to their interests. All these things
they thought about, but still no name.
Then one day one of them said, "Hey, what about
'The Common Denominator.' " And it fit so well that it
was settled.
The Common Denominator, an uncommonly good
solution.

Do you want a representative government?
The Equalizers are here for all students. We're a ra
cially diverse slate, but our interests extend beyond our
cultural backgrounds. Despite our diversity, we share a
common goal — the desire to work through the ASSU
to better serve the students.
Do you want a dedicated Council of Presidents?
During our term of office we'll be going to school
half-time in order to devote as much time as possible to
COP. We've also made plans to stay over the summer
to get a head start on our projects for the upcoming
year. We challenge you to find another slate ready to
make these sacrifices.
Do you want a student government that uses your
opinions to make its decisions?
Many students feel that they don't have input in the
decisions of the ASSU. These are some of the solutions
we propose:
v* Straw Poll — an organization that telephone sur
veys samples of students on key issues before the ASSU
Senate like divestment and freshman housing choice.
Outreach Program — each COP member will
speak at a house meeting once a week on a rotating
basis.
White Plaza Office Hours — we'll hold office
hours in White Plaza once a week. Stop by and tell us
your opinions.
V COP Complaint Hotline — a number that you can
dial and get your gripes about the ASSU answered.
Do you want a COP that gets things done?
We want change within the student government and
the University. Here arc a few ways we intend to make
those changes:
v* Food Service Task Force — will work toward sol
ving the problems within University Food Service such
as high cost and inability to carry over extra meals from
the week before.
Entertainment Bureau — When your dorm or stu
dent group puts on a party or show, you'll be able to
call the E.B. to get the right performer at the right price
under contract.
Student Groups Space — Groups like the Asian
Community and Women's Center need improved
facilities. We'll face the Administration with these con
cerns and push for action.
v* Minority Task Force — will investigate important
minority issues such as minority admissions and ethnic
studies and make necessary changes.
V Coin and Vending Machine Task Force — no
change to do your laundry? Can't get a Coke in the
middle of the night? This group will get these services
into the dorms.
Isn't it time for The Equalizers?

The job of the COP is to provide a link between the
students, the administration, and the student senate. It
is difficult to do this unless one actually takes the time
to speak with the students and find out how they feel.
The PHILOSOPHER KINGS have spent the last three
years experiencing the true flavor of Stanford life. It is
rumored that we tend to indulge occasionally in
Hedonistic pleasures; however, we do have a serious
side. Any time student rights are endangered by im
perialist University policy the PHILOSOPHER
KINGS swoop down and lead the struggle for truth,
justice, and the American way. Our candidacy
represents a whole-hearted effort to make Stanford
more responsive to student needs, no matter what the
cost. NO PRISONERS.
A brief list of our goals:
Reform University damage fee assessment system;
Integrate the required study of women and minorities
into the Stanford curriculum outside of western cul
ture;
Establishment of all-night study areas;
Increase the length of winter break;
Create a REAL (grateful) "Dead Week;
Parking Anarchy — The elimination of Nazis driving
souped-up scooters issuing tickets randomly and
ruthlessly;
Change western culture to Midwestern culture: Study
of Indiana, lowa, etc.;
Declare Stanford a "drug-testing free zone";
Reagan Library in White Plaza — Stanford Out of
White Plaza;
Add more Trees to the Dollies and make a forest;
"No pork-barrel legislation, and absolutely no wallow
ing at the public trough";
"No time for moderation";
"Always listen to the drunk guys at the next table";
"Total disregard and reckless abandon";
"You can't recork a bottle, if it feels good - do it";
" 'Cause we've got the time";
" 'Cause we're so comfortable";
"Who are these guys and what are they thinking?";
"Ignore the ASSU because disbanding them didn't
work";
"A vote for us is a vote for humanity";
"Shrink the growing problem of SBD because every
mouth comes with a pair of hands";
"Stop the flow of ASSU covert aid to the Contra
rebels";
"We will not be tools of the imperialist nation";
MTOSCFH WAFLN;
"More stop signs and more construction because there
just doesn't seem to be enough on campus";
"Vote for us to get your fee refunds";
