There once were four people who thought they could
do a great job on the COP. Luckily (at least they felt
so) they found each other and decided to run. But what
would they call their slate?
You see they wanted their name to reflect who they
were and what they stood for. They were qualified for
the job. Two had been on the Senate, one as Deputy
Chair. One helped run Orientation and was involved
with community service, another ran the Pro-Fro pro
gram and was a Daily editor. They were all also in
volved in many other activities which put them in touch
with a lot of people in the community. But what name
could reflect all that?
They knew of course that no slate of four people
could represent every interest on the campus. They also
knew though that they had open minds and a genuine
sensitivity (intellectual and emotional) to the issues.
They felt that the ASSU was for all students and they
wanted to show that in their name. But what name?
They thought a lot about the issues. They saw that
student's interests fall into two categories: those of stu
dents with special common concerns (student groups)
and those of the student body as a whole. They thought
of ways to help the ASSU reach those people: through
visibility of the COP. through student surveys, and
through having individual representatives to student
groups. There were specific issues they wanted to
pursue which they felt were student concerns. They
wanted a more vigorous recruitment of minority pro
fessors and students and a larger commitment to Ethnic
Studies Programs. They wanted to simplify the funding
process for student groups and to deaden Dead Week.
They felt the athletic facilities should be upgraded and
extended and that Tresidder should be made more
responsive to student needs. They also wanted to ex
tend ASSU projects to meet student needs and to ex
plore the possibilities of the ASSU serving a social
function. In short they wanted all students to know that
there could be people on the COP who were excited
about responding to their interests. All these things
they thought about, but still no name.
Then one day one of them said, "Hey, what about
'The Common Denominator.' " And it fit so well that it
was settled.
The Common Denominator, an uncommonly good
solution.

Do you want a representative government?
The Equalizers are here for all students. We're a ra
cially diverse slate, but our interests extend beyond our
cultural backgrounds. Despite our diversity, we share a
common goal — the desire to work through the ASSU
to better serve the students.
Do you want a dedicated Council of Presidents?
During our term of office we'll be going to school
half-time in order to devote as much time as possible to
COP. We've also made plans to stay over the summer
to get a head start on our projects for the upcoming
year. We challenge you to find another slate ready to
make these sacrifices.
Do you want a student government that uses your
opinions to make its decisions?
Many students feel that they don't have input in the
decisions of the ASSU. These are some of the solutions
we propose:
v* Straw Poll — an organization that telephone sur
veys samples of students on key issues before the ASSU
Senate like divestment and freshman housing choice.
Outreach Program — each COP member will
speak at a house meeting once a week on a rotating
basis.
White Plaza Office Hours — we'll hold office
hours in White Plaza once a week. Stop by and tell us
your opinions.
V COP Complaint Hotline — a number that you can
dial and get your gripes about the ASSU answered.
Do you want a COP that gets things done?
We want change within the student government and
the University. Here arc a few ways we intend to make
those changes:
v* Food Service Task Force — will work toward sol
ving the problems within University Food Service such
as high cost and inability to carry over extra meals from
the week before.
Entertainment Bureau — When your dorm or stu
dent group puts on a party or show, you'll be able to
call the E.B. to get the right performer at the right price
under contract.
Student Groups Space — Groups like the Asian
Community and Women's Center need improved
facilities. We'll face the Administration with these con
cerns and push for action.
v* Minority Task Force — will investigate important
minority issues such as minority admissions and ethnic
studies and make necessary changes.
V Coin and Vending Machine Task Force — no
change to do your laundry? Can't get a Coke in the
middle of the night? This group will get these services
into the dorms.
Isn't it time for The Equalizers?

Philosopher Kings

Editor
The job of the COP is to provide a link between the
students, the administration, and the student senate. It
is difficult to do this unless one actually takes the time
to speak with the students and find out how they feel.
The PHILOSOPHER KINGS have spent the last three
years experiencing the true flavor of Stanford life. It is
rumored that we tend to indulge occasionally in
Hedonistic pleasures; however, we do have a serious
side. Any time student rights are endangered by im
perialist University policy the PHILOSOPHER
KINGS swoop down and lead the struggle for truth,
justice, and the American way. Our candidacy
represents a whole-hearted effort to make Stanford
more responsive to student needs, no matter what the
cost. NO PRISONERS.
A brief list of our goals:
Reform University damage fee assessment system;
Integrate the required study of women and minorities
into the Stanford curriculum outside of western cul
ture;
Establishment of all-night study areas;
Increase the length of winter break;
Create a REAL (grateful) "Dead Week;
Parking Anarchy — The elimination of Nazis driving
souped-up scooters issuing tickets randomly and
ruthlessly;
Change western culture to Midwestern culture: Study
of Indiana, lowa, etc.;
Declare Stanford a "drug-testing free zone";
Reagan Library in White Plaza — Stanford Out of
White Plaza;
Add more Trees to the Dollies and make a forest;
"No pork-barrel legislation, and absolutely no wallow
ing at the public trough";
"No time for moderation";
"Always listen to the drunk guys at the next table";
"Total disregard and reckless abandon";
"You can't recork a bottle, if it feels good - do it";
" 'Cause we've got the time";
" 'Cause we're so comfortable";
"Who are these guys and what are they thinking?";
"Ignore the ASSU because disbanding them didn't
work";
"A vote for us is a vote for humanity";
"Shrink the growing problem of SBD because every
mouth comes with a pair of hands";
"Stop the flow of ASSU covert aid to the Contra
rebels";
"We will not be tools of the imperialist nation";
MTOSCFH WAFLN;
"More stop signs and more construction because there
just doesn't seem to be enough on campus";
"Vote for us to get your fee refunds";

Eric — So what's the PLAN? Our plan is to increase
student control over University matters that affect the
lives of students. How's that for big goals? Many stu
dent problems, however, are directly linked to lack of
control over various aspects of our Stanford experi
ence, for instance, the ineffective Dead Week Policy.
As a slate, we hope to bring diversity, experience, and
determination to the COP. With these qualities, we
plan to represent all students and bring about real
change.
Lori — The four of us worked hard to put together a
slate that understands the diverse needs of Stanford
students. We believe that it takes more than color to
make someone a true representative of a community,
and Julie and Ira's current involvements strongly indi
cate that they have the awareness of issues necessary to
make them an effective voice to the administration.
However, not all students are progressively-minded;
therefore, my experiences in the Greek system and my
involvement with student services at the ASSU, as well
as Eric's work within the Undergraduate Senate will
help us all relate to the various concerns of the student
body.
Ira — Our plan centers around the idea that Stanford
students need to have greater input in decision-making
processes. Specifically, we see three areas as being most
critical. They are 1) the need to examine admissions
and financial aid practices, 2) the need to review the
process by which the academic calendar is constructed,
and 3) the desperate need for student office and recrea
tion space.
We chose these issues because, in talking with
various students, these three are on many people's
minds. We aren't placing the blame for these problems,

however, on anyone. For instance, we don't think there
is a need for a sweeping reform of Stanford's admis
sions policies; rather, we would like to work with them
to help bring a wider representation of students to this
campus. This is true for all of our issues; we don't plan
to change the world. We only want to address the prob
lems and concerns of students and come to resolutions
which satisfy everyone.
Julie — We believe that we possess a unique combi
nation of strengths. With diversity, experience, and de
termination, we can increase student control over
University policies and processes. We understand the
limits of the position but feel we are the best qualified
to work within those limits.

Picture this:
Four experienced Stanford students who envision a
better tomorrow for their beloved university and its
talented student body. Using radical and innovative
ideas, they achieve their incredible goals, resulting in an
illustrious and Utopian university.
Sounds great, but first let's focus on improving today.
SLATE OF THE UNION is determined to making
changes that will help the Stanford student today. We
have experienced the ASSU bureaucracy. We have
seen the frustration of our fellow students. We recog

nize the divisions that exist in our student body. And
we are committed to making the necessary changes.
Our goal is to attack the following:
Quality of Student Life
— Extend the hours of Meyer and Green Libraries and
explore the possibility of installing electronic check
out.
— Improve the quality of health care attention at
Cowell.
— Redesign current student ID's; e.g. laminated
picture student ID's.
— Increase student accessibility to dorm based com
puter facilities (especially laserwriters!).
— Open the possibility for students to use their meal
cards at Tresidder.
— Create an all campus celebration in the Spring to
unify the student body.
Student Involvement
— Improve the diversity and quantity of student repre
sentation in the ASSU.
— Continue and expand student involvement in task
forces, intern positions and special legislative com
mittees.
— Increase student awareness of funding available for
student organizations.
Student Issues
— Work to increasing the quantity and variety of fields
represented by outside firms recruiting on campus.
— Lobby faculty and administration to emphasize the
quality of the teaching over the quantity of pages
printed.
— Continue pressuring the administration to take an
active stance against apartheid in South Africa.
— Continue to support the suggested renovation of the
Western Culture program.
— Work on improving relations between Stanford stu
dents and the surrounding communities.
— Support the Sanctuary Movement at Stanford.
— Continue to advocate AIDS Awareness and increase
the accessibility of contraceptives.
— Promote ethnic and academic diversity. Remember
that unity is the fusion of different components; it is
NOT conformity of the parts.
SLATE OF THE UNION will implement changes that
will improve student life as well as address student con
cerns. We will listen to your ideas and do our best to in
corporate them. We want to see changes that will
benefit students who are here now. SLATE OF THE
UNION believes that our concerted effort will in turn
result in a united student body.

Undergraduate Senators (cont'd)

Brett M. Mahoney
Junior, Political Science
ASSU Senator, 1986-87; served on the student affairs
committee; Kappa Alpha Psi Fraternity Inc.; Keeper of
Records 1987
Awareness has been my goal in participating with the
ASSU. Student Awareness of their resources and .uni
versity awareness of student interests. In 1986-87 the
student affairs committee and I felt these goals could
best be achieved through dorm outreach programs and
a forum on student influence in university decision
making. If elected again I would like to concentrate
more on the Economic side of the ASSU; helping fund
student organizations which will best benefit students
and make our presence felt on this campus and in this
community.
Miguel Marquez
Sophomore, Undeclared
Member of MEChA, Ballet Folklorico de Stanford,
Project Motivation, and the Stanford Society of
Chicano Engineers and Scientists
In addition to high school leadership roles, my year
and a half at Stanford has given me ample opportunity
to enhance my leadership abilities. I am currently a
staff member at El Centro where I work implementing
educational programs and I am System Administrator
of the Zapata computer cluster. Also, I am a Theme
Associate at Casa Zapata where I help in programming
for the residents. As an ASSU Senator, I would like to
lead educational programs and lend support to those
who take the initiative to sponsor their own programs.
Additionally, I am endorsed and endrse the People's
Platform.
Mike G. Mueller
Sophomore, Economics
Served as Senator for the ASWU at Willamette Uni
versity, Salem, Oregon, 1985-87
The Senate should not isolate and alienate itself from
the mainstream of Stanford students; it's not a platform
for special interests. Rather, it should reflect, and voice,
the majority opinion of the students. Look at a recent
edition of the ASSU News if you want to see a demon
stration of their seriousness and conviction. A check
needs to be placed on the distribution and amount of
your fees being allocated by the ASSU. The Senate
needs to do more than give a tacit approval of virtually
every spending measure which it faces; it needs a strong
dose of common sense.
Peter Nadan
Sophomore, International Relations (Undeclared)
Advising Associate 1986-87; Orientation Volunteer
1986-87; Committee of Fifteen 1985-86; Centennial
Committee 1985-86
The ASSU has over one million dollars. Your dol
lars. These funds are spent at the Senate's discretion.
As your Senator I will make sure that the Senate spends
the money as you see fit, not on the whim of the bu
reaucracy. Further, I will make a concerted effort not to
push well-intentioned, albeit futile, ideals. Rather I'd
like to see the money spent practically: lights on the
tennis and basketball courts; all-campus parking stick
ers; televisions in all University housing; and any other
ideas that you propose. In short, I will speak for you.

Cliff Rachlin
Freshman, Undeclared
Member of Barrio Assistance Tutoring Project; Team
'87 athletic program for East Palo, Stanford Amnesty
International
The administration of Stanford needs to be
responsive to the needs of Stanford students and the
ASSU should play a key role in this. I support the
already existing policy of assigning senators to dorms to
inform them of ASSU news and keep them involved.
Rather than grandiose schemes, I have particular
policies in mind. I plan to emphasize support of public
service activities which desperately need it and would
like to use the ASSU to push for a quicker rate of di
vestment. Even more specifically, I believe that the
teaching of the Holocaust should be made a mandatory
part of each Western Culture tracks. These are only a
few ideas; most of them should come up during the year
from the students I would be responsible to.
Michael Roark
Freshman, Undeclared
Incite and Report. These are the duties of an ASSU
Senator. Incite. On a campus where student activism is
low, a senator must stir up the student body by organiz
ing rallies, leading marches, focusing debate, and ques
tioning faculty and administration. We can not and will
not be silent on issues and policies which affect us!
Above all, however, a senator must Report.
Communication is the only way to assure that a senator
is representing your views. Not only will you have my
phone number, but I will often be in your dorms talking
with you.
Mychal H. Schwartz
Freshman, Undeclared
Let's face it. How am I to. win your vote in such little
space and time? My name is Michael, but with a Y . . .
WHY? Because I ask why. Why are there no concerts.
Why don't I see returns on my ASSU dues. Why does
the Reagan Library get planned without any student in
put. These are just questions. Questions are not
enough. Answers are not enough. Action speaks for it
self, and so far this year, either I'm deaf, or the Bear
has got the ASSU's tongue. It's time for some
noticeable action, some real returns, beyond the
longstanding programs that are so easy for the Senate
to maintain.
Scott A. South wick
Sophomore, Electrical Engineering
Varsity Crew
As a member of a varsity sport at Stanford, and more
importantly, a sport that is not funded 100% by the
Athletic Department, I can identify with and support
those students involved with Club Sports and Athletics.
However, my attentions as senator will not be limited
to these ideas. As a transfer student, I have a contrast
ing though helpful angle as to how a Senate should be
operated. The Senate should benefit and accommodate
to the majority or mainstream of the student body as
well as, but not only special interest groups and an elite
group of senators.
James R. Suhre
Junior, Economics
Head Tall Guy of the Chaparral; Concert Network Ad
visory Board
The Senate currently consists of 20 year old student
council members, who haven't done anything but pout
and act important in their own little arena! Worst of all,
they claim to know more about how to run student
groups than the actual heads of those groups! I'm
speaking specifically about the appropriations commit

tee! It's time to end the inquisition! I'm a Chappie, on
the Concert Network Board, and I build sets for the
Student Cable Channel. And I'm not going to deny
KZSU the money to buy a compact disk player! Is that
100 words yet? Buy the Chaparral.
Peter Thiel
Junior, Philosophy & Biology
Chess Club President; CR treasurer
I have no experience in the ASSU Senate. I have no
experience wasting $86,000 of student money on
ASSU office renovations, helping friends pack resumes
with positions in the ASSU bureaucracy, and giving
them disproportionate salaries on top. As an outsider
looking at the current student government, I am dis
gusted. As a member of several student organizations
that could not receive funding (supposedly because of a
"lack of funds"), I am furious about this waste of our
money; if elected, I will work to make the ASSU serve
the Stanford community rather than itself.
Dinesh Vazirani
Sophomore, Undeclared
Member of International Speakers Bureau; Orienta
tion Volunteer '86; Staff writer Daily '86
As an ASSU Senator it will be my goal to voice all
the grievances and desires of the student body. I will
strive to be a link between the students and the Associ
ation, unveiling many of the existing ambiguities of the
Association to the Stanford student. At the present mo
ment, most students are unaware of the functions of
many of the committees of the Association. I will try to
bring to light the functions and advantages of these
committees, by creating a positive interaction between
the students and myself.
