Live your senior year in an altered state. We'd like to
make a difference in your last year here, as you mutate

from a college student to a money-earning, job-holding
(hopefully) person. We have plans to change senior life
into an exciting year.
We will not ALTER the traditional fun by continuing:
( Disorientation Week; Senior Pub Nights;
Mausoleum Party; Senior Tailgaters; Casino Night;
Spring Formal.
In addition, we have many exciting ALTERNA
TIVES planned:
( Ski Trips, Lakers, Senior Sports Nights, A Senior
Directory, Senior Barbecues, Weekend at Disneyland,
Alumni/Faculty cocktail hours; Regressive Pub Night.
Since this is our last year at Stanford (maybe?) unless
you're taking classes pass/no commencement, we would
like to help make the ALTERATIONS necessary to
enter the "real world" with:
112 A liaison between Senior Class and Alumni/Faculty
organizations; Manage Senior Budget; Activate Senior
Network; Publish Quarterly Calendar/Newsletter;
Alumni job network.
Spend your senior year with an ALTERED SLATE.
