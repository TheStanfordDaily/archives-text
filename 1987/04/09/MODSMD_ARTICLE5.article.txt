Live your senior year in an altered state. We'd like to
make a difference in your last year here, as you mutate

from a college student to a money-earning, job-holding
(hopefully) person. We have plans to change senior life
into an exciting year.
We will not ALTER the traditional fun by continuing:
( Disorientation Week; Senior Pub Nights;
Mausoleum Party; Senior Tailgaters; Casino Night;
Spring Formal.
In addition, we have many exciting ALTERNA
TIVES planned:
( Ski Trips, Lakers, Senior Sports Nights, A Senior
Directory, Senior Barbecues, Weekend at Disneyland,
Alumni/Faculty cocktail hours; Regressive Pub Night.
Since this is our last year at Stanford (maybe?) unless
you're taking classes pass/no commencement, we would
like to help make the ALTERATIONS necessary to
enter the "real world" with:
112 A liaison between Senior Class and Alumni/Faculty
organizations; Manage Senior Budget; Activate Senior
Network; Publish Quarterly Calendar/Newsletter;
Alumni job network.
Spend your senior year with an ALTERED SLATE.

Dean Fred, The Legend.
Three years ago this April, The Legend sat down in
front of some 1,500 letters. With his Cardinal red pen
he sealed the fate of a generation. "Great!" he said, the
universal benediction of his administration. And we
took him up on the offer, but the job is far from
finished.
The graduation of our class will mark the End of an
Era. The last of Hargadon's chosen few. And without a
doubt, we're out to make this year live up to that
Legend. We recognize the fact that to make our senior
year nothing short of legendary will require hard work
and an effort nothing short of Goliath.
We have already been talking with 88'ers about what
you want for your senior year. Better and more activi
ties. Senior disorientation (like Frosh orientation with
out the innocence, complete with an inspiring talk by
Fred himself). A Senior Mausoleum party that will rock
the Stanfords. Reserved Senior sections at Football and
Basketball games. A Senior Sierra Camp Retreat. Bet
ter Pub Nights.
In the next week, in our rounds on the hot and heavy
campaign trail, we, Stacey, Ed, Liz, and Keith, will talk
with you. Give it some thought, what exactly makes a
legendary year?
It's the End of an Era. End it with a bang, not a

One year left! For the class of'BB — Dean Fred's cel
ebrated last class — that must seem almost
unbelievable. Just a few short years ago, we were
young, timid freshmen — screaming our dorm name at
football games, cursing Western Culture, surviving
University Meal Service.
But now we're older, more mature (less mature?),
and soon to be graduating (or maybe a fifth year). For
the Class of '88, we are facing our last year together on
the Farm before we head off to Wall Street and the
Peace Corps and Silicon Valley.
To make our senior year as fun and memorable as
possible, the Slate of'BB would like to continue local bar
nights, add a. few more excursions to the City, have
several beach trips and, maybe, a ski trip, and rock-n
-roll with small bands in the spring sun at Wilbur Field.
Since graduation is a serious affair, we will support a
well-known leader as Commencement speaker.

We of the Slate of '88 feel we offer a healthy combi
nation of leadership, conscientiousness, and a desire to
have fun. The Slate of'BB wants our last year at Stan
ford to be the best year. Let's go out with a bang,

Live your senior year in an altered state. We'd like to
make a difference in your last year here, as you mutate

from a college student to a money-earning, job-holding
(hopefully) person. We have plans to change senior life
into an exciting year.
We will not ALTER the traditional fun by continuing:
( Disorientation Week; Senior Pub Nights;
Mausoleum Party; Senior Tailgaters; Casino Night;
Spring Formal.
In addition, we have many exciting ALTERNA
TIVES planned:
( Ski Trips, Lakers, Senior Sports Nights, A Senior
Directory, Senior Barbecues, Weekend at Disneyland,
Alumni/Faculty cocktail hours; Regressive Pub Night.
Since this is our last year at Stanford (maybe?) unless
you're taking classes pass/no commencement, we would
like to help make the ALTERATIONS necessary to
enter the "real world" with:
112 A liaison between Senior Class and Alumni/Faculty
organizations; Manage Senior Budget; Activate Senior

Alumni job network.
Spend your senior year with an ALTERED SLATE.

Dean Fred, The Legend.
Three years ago this April, The Legend sat down in
front of some 1,500 letters. With his Cardinal red pen
he sealed the fate of a generation. "Great!" he said, the
universal benediction of his administration. And we
took him up on the offer, but the job is far from
finished.
The graduation of our class will mark the End of an
Era. The last of Hargadon's chosen few. And without a
doubt, we're out to make this year live up to that
Legend. We recognize the fact that to make our senior
year nothing short of legendary will require hard work
and an effort nothing short of Goliath.
We have already been talking with 88'ers about what
you want for your senior year. Better and more activi
ties. Senior disorientation (like Frosh orientation with
out the innocence, complete with an inspiring talk by
Fred himself). A Senior Mausoleum party that will rock
the Stanfords. Reserved Senior sections at Football and
Basketball games. A Senior Sierra Camp Retreat. Bet
ter Pub Nights.
In the next week, in our rounds on the hot and heavy
campaign trail, we, Stacey, Ed, Liz, and Keith, will talk
with you. Give it some thought, what exactly makes a
legendary year?
It's the End of an Era. End it with a bang, not a
whimper. Vote Mem Slate!
