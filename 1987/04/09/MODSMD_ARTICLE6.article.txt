Julie Ann Bianchini

ican Smokeout - co-chairman (Fall '85), Advising As
sociate (Fall '86 to present), Alpha Phi - chapter
historian (Spring '86 to present), Stanford In Govern

Do you remember first hearing about the ASSU Sen
ate? .. . Well, after 8 quarters, 27 finals, and 364 fro
yo's, I decided to stop hearing about Senate decisions
and instead, to start making them.
What will I do? I will work to increase student aware
ness and involvement in Senate issues, insure equitable
appropriation of funds, and promote diversity by spon
soring various student groups and activities.

How will I do this? 1 will pour my energy and enthus
iasm into attending meetings, publicizing issues, and
listening to students.
So, vote for Julie Bianchini. And, to quote Frank
Bartles, "Thank you for your support."
Helen F. Chang
Sophomore, Product Design
Artist for the Chaparral; Camerawoman for the Stu
dent Channel; Former KZSU slave labourer.
What does the Senate know about student groups
and interests? Do they do anything but tell the students
what they can't do and can't have? Vote for me and
maybe we'll improve student life with things like the
Student Channel, better equipment for KZSU, a 24-
hour library, and free access to laser printers for every
Stanford student.
Erik A. Charlton
Sophomore, Undeclared (Product Design)
What does the ASSU do? Why are we so removed
from our student governing body that we cannot define
its duties? The ASSU has become involved with many
legitimate special interest groups which don't involve a
majority of students. These groups have a valuable im
pact on the University; but we need new organizations;
additional groups which could better support and in
form the student body as a whole. For these reasons, I
believe that the ASSU needs to reassess the needs of
the student body and choose an appropriate course in
order to resolve this problem.
Timur Colak
Freshman, Undeclared
As an ASSU Senator, I hope to quickly gain the
background on all of the issues and the mechanisms of

the Senate •. jt me to act as a responsible rep
resentative of Stantord students as well as my con
science. I intend to closely monitor the attitudes of the
student body and reflect these opinions at the Senate
and committee meetings. These actions along with my
sense of justice will steer me to protect the major inter
ests of all students while preserving the reputation of
Stanford as a top quality university.
John Crandon
Sophomore, Biology/Poli Sci
Nominations Commissioner 1986-87; Stanford in Gov
ernment, Committee on Intern Resources 1986-87,
'85-'B6; Inter Fraternity Council 1987; Kappa Alpha
Fraternity 1986-87
"What in the HELL is the ASSU anyway?" is a ques
tion asked all too often by students here at Stanford. As
an ASSU Senator, one of my goals would be to allevi
ate this problem by increasing the communication and
rapport between the ASSU and the student body. A
few of the issues that I am specifically interested in in
clude: establishing a true "Dead Week" without
classes, increasing services for Row houses including
computer facilities and SUNet connections, reevaluat
ing the university calendar for future years to include a
Christmas break longer than two weeks, and providing
a free condom in every pocket.
Jason Dominguez
Freshman, Undeclared
In order for Stanford to remain a leading educational
institute, it must evolve to meet the changing needs of
society. I would like to become involved in the shaping
of decisions which will keep Stanford at the forefront of
education. Beyond that, I would like to help implement
programs to make everyone's Stanford experience as
enriching as possible. Being here by virtue of your in
telligence and diversity, it would benefit the Stanford
community if the ideas of all of you were heard and
enacted, and as a senator, I would work to effect the
changes you find necessary and helpful.
Bruce Elvin
Freshman, Undeclared
Committee of Fifteen, appointed by the Dean of School
of Humanities and Sciences; Stanford Daily Reporter;
Stanford In Government
What does Stanford owe us? I'm not quite sure, but I
know that for $20,000 we deserve more. It is the Uni
versity's turn to pay us. Stanford University is here to
serve. The administration, faculty and facilities should
all be directed toward the individual students. Students
at the finest university in the country deserve quality
food, adequate swimming and weight training facilities
and upperclass dorm computers. Senators should work
for the student to widen the number of classes to meet
student demand and to pursue big name rock groups to
play the Farm.
Thank You for Considering Bruce Elvin.
Shari Fetterman
Freshman, Undeclared
Speaker's Bureau Committee; Senate Associate; Stu
dent Affairs Committee
As an ASSU Senator, I will encourage interaction
between students, the administration, and the trustees.
I will work to create more opportunities for student
participation in University decisions. However, my
main goal will be to improve the accessibility of infor
mation to students about campus activities, events and
opportunities. Students should be more aware of the
ASSU and its potential benefits so that the ASSU can
be stronger and be maximized to serve more students
better. Student awareness could be raised through ef
fective distribution of ASSU information and increased
dorm outreach by the Senate.
Perry Friedman
Freshman, Undeclared
I believe that it should be easier for student groups to
get on the ballot for funding. The students are intelli
gent enough to decide for themselves whether or not to
approve any requests. 1300 signatures is prohibitively
large to small organizations and is no small nuisance.
I believe the Senate should be responsible to the
people. Issues discussed at each meeting should be re
ported in the Daily and the minutes of each meeting, as
well as the voting records of all senators, should be
readily available at the ASSU Office.
Charles Givens
Junior, Political Science
Black Pre-Law; a member of Alpha Phi Alpha Frater
nity Inc. - Secretary; Gospel Choir; Black Greek Letter
Council - Fundraising Chairman; a member of the
Stanford Bowling team - Club Sports Representative
As a Junior, I have seen the increasing problem of
running such a large university without communication
between the different decision-makers. So there is a
definite need for the voice of the people to be heard
and conveyed to the university. In the Senate I would
be attempting to bridge this communication gap. Also
this would afford me the chance to learn how a large
university works politically and use my political skills to
benefit the school and its students. Further minority
representation in the ASSU Senate helps this institu
tion become more responsive to the needs of the whole
polity.
Lucky Gutierrez
Senior, Economics
Coordinator, Project Motivation; Theme Associate,
Casa Zapata; Co-Chair, MEChA Labor Support Com
mittee; Industrial Liaison, Stanford Society of Chicano
Engineers and Scientists; Tutor, Barrio Assistance

I believe that as an ASSU Senator I can represent the
interests of our diverse student body. I am especially in
terested in dealing with issues which affect the ethnic
and progressive communities on campus, as well as sup
porting community service activities. However, my
main goal as a senator would be to make the ASSU ef
ficient and responsive in addressing all student's con
cerns.
Gina F. Harrison
Freshman, Economics
Black Student Union; Pre-Business Society; volunteer
for coordination of Club Ujamaa
As an ASSU Senator, my main focus will be to pro
vide fair and informed representation for all Stanford
students. The senate has the dual responsibility of for
mulating ASSU policies and overseeing their imple
mentation. I believe that students should have a more
active role in this decision-making process which
direcetly affects them. This is especially true in areas
such as Food Service, student group funding, and
Housing. I would also like to foster change in Univer
sity policies such as divestment, and the lack of support
for ethnic studies and theme houses on campus.
Lillian Hirales
Sophomore, Undeclared
Administrative Assistant to Council of Presidents; Bar
rio Assistance
My work as an Administrative Assistant has encour
aged me to run for ASSU Senate. I understand the
complexity of student group programming that requires
much time and funding and I plan to use that experi
ence to aid student organizations on campus. I will be
especially sensitive to minority students and groups
who are often underrepresented in the ASSU. I will
work to have their ideas brought forward, considered,
and put into effect. As a Senator, I will also make the
ASSU more accessible to all students.
Reid Hoffman
Sophomore, Symbolic Systems
The ASSU has enormous potential for making posi
tive changes in this University. It is a very wealthy or
ganization with approximately $500,000 in reserves.
Recently, the ASSU Senate approved plans to renovate
its own office space for $80,000. While the ASSU
needs repair, other student facilities, like the Old
Firehouse, seem to need the money more. I believe the
ASSU is suffering from an egocentrism inherent in
many bureaucratic organizations. It tends to serve its
own needs before the needs of the students. As a
senator, I will attempt to increase the ASSU's financial
commitment to student activities. Right now, the
money is just sitting in the bank.
Jon Inda
Sophomore, Undeclared
MEChA - Treasurer; Student Labor Support Commit
tee Core Member; Barrio Assistance Tutor; volunteer
staff for El Centro Chicano; Program Board for EI
Centro Chicano; Ambassador Program for Minority
Admissions; Stanford Society of Chicano Engineers;
Project Motivation
I would like to promote change in the bureaucratic
methods by which Stanford conducts policy-making.
Students should easily be able to communicate their
concerns and needs in areas such as; Housing, Financial
Aids, and Food Service. As expressed in The People's
Platform, Stanford's policies are not responsive to the
concerns of all members of the community, especially
those of minorities, progressives, and women. I would
like to build a Senate that is more responsive to these
needs.

Douglas Karpa
Freshman, Undeclared
I support the People's Platform and intend to in
crease the influence of the student body on the policies
of this University in order to stop the corporatization of
such student services as the Coffee House and Food
Service; to protect the rights of the Stanford workers;
and to get equal funding and office space for all Univer
sity organizations.
I also want to increase the availability of ASSU re
sources for the students by increasing the size and
comprehensiveness of OATQ and by providing a ser
vice to help people to take advantage of these re
sources.
As Senator I intend to keep the Senate responsive to
the student body's needs.
Stacey Leyton
Junior, History
ASSU Senator, 1986-87; Member of Stanford Out of
South Africa, 1985-87; Member of Student Labor Sup
port Committee, 1985-87
Much is wrong with Stanford University in 1987 —
investments in South Africa and an ethnocentric West
ern Culture program, for example. And Stanford func
tions as an undemocratic institution, as student voices
are ignored in issues ranging from divestment to Dead
Week policy. The ASSU should not be a bureaucracy
designed to serve itself, but should serve as the voice of
the students and demand that the university hears and
acts on our concerns. As a People's Platform ASSU
Senator this year, I have and will continue to uphold
progressive causes by funding student groups and
representing student interests to the Administration.
Derick Lin
Freshman, Undeclared
Asian American Student Association Planning Com
mittee Officer; Member, Coffee House Board
As a member of Californians Against Proposition 63,
I saw the enlightened rejection of this proposition by
the majority of the Stanford community. Yet, while we
have a mandatory western culture program, ethnic
studies remain weak, and Asian-American studies non
existent. The administration's responsiveness to stu
dent needs (as in organization space) and the ASSU's
communication with individual students remains inade
quate. These, and other issues elaborated in the
People's Platform, will be the focus of my work in the
Senate. Let's all — ASSU, Third World and Progres
sive student communities — work together for the bet
terment of our University.
Daniel Luna
Freshman, Undeclared
Administrative Assistant to the COP; Treasurer for
Casa Zapata dorm; Stanford Newman Choir; MEChA;
Rotating Vice-President for Stanford Society of
Chicano Engineers and Scientists
As an ASSU Senator, representing students' con
cerns and suggestions will be my primary goals. These
suggestions and concerns have been especially under
represented in the minority communities. Having
worked with the ASSU and other minority organiza
tions, I have seen a recurring problem: representation
of the different communities at Stanford can at times be
unproportional. Not only will I assist students' efforts
to improve representation, but also seek new channels
through which students can express their ideas, have
their ideas reviewed, and participate in some way, in
the reviewing process. My goal is seeing ideas that rep
resent students' needs implemented.
