What do you want from life?
A heated, kidney-shaped pool?
An ASSU push for four-year guaranteed housing?
Real simulated Indian jewelry?
Improved ASSU support for student organizations?
Hell, non-judgemental ASSU support for student or
ganizations?
Bob Dylan's new unlisted phone number?
An ASSU that doesn't concern itself with itself?
A new Monza?
An ASSU senator who isn't a special interest toy?
A beautifully-restored third reich swizzlestick?
A reason why the ASSU needs secret sessions?
How 'bout a McCulloch chainsaw?
A senator who serves you and not himself?
Or a baby's arm holding an apple?

Do you remember first hearing about the ASSU Sen
ate? .. . Well, after 8 quarters, 27 finals, and 364 fro
yo's, I decided to stop hearing about Senate decisions
and instead, to start making them.
What will I do? I will work to increase student aware
ness and involvement in Senate issues, insure equitable
appropriation of funds, and promote diversity by spon
soring various student groups and activities.

How will I do this? 1 will pour my energy and enthus
iasm into attending meetings, publicizing issues, and
listening to students.
So, vote for Julie Bianchini. And, to quote Frank
Bartles, "Thank you for your support."
Helen F. Chang
Sophomore, Product Design
Artist for the Chaparral; Camerawoman for the Stu
dent Channel; Former KZSU slave labourer.
What does the Senate know about student groups
and interests? Do they do anything but tell the students
what they can't do and can't have? Vote for me and
maybe we'll improve student life with things like the
Student Channel, better equipment for KZSU, a 24-
hour library, and free access to laser printers for every
Stanford student.
Erik A. Charlton
Sophomore, Undeclared (Product Design)
What does the ASSU do? Why are we so removed
from our student governing body that we cannot define
its duties? The ASSU has become involved with many
legitimate special interest groups which don't involve a
majority of students. These groups have a valuable im
pact on the University; but we need new organizations;
additional groups which could better support and in
form the student body as a whole. For these reasons, I
believe that the ASSU needs to reassess the needs of
the student body and choose an appropriate course in
order to resolve this problem.
Timur Colak
Freshman, Undeclared
As an ASSU Senator, I hope to quickly gain the
background on all of the issues and the mechanisms of

the Senate •. jt me to act as a responsible rep
resentative of Stantord students as well as my con
science. I intend to closely monitor the attitudes of the
student body and reflect these opinions at the Senate
and committee meetings. These actions along with my
sense of justice will steer me to protect the major inter
ests of all students while preserving the reputation of
Stanford as a top quality university.

ernment, Committee on Intern Resources 1986-87,

Fraternity 1986-87
"What in the HELL is the ASSU anyway?" is a ques
tion asked all too often by students here at Stanford. As
an ASSU Senator, one of my goals would be to allevi
ate this problem by increasing the communication and
rapport between the ASSU and the student body. A
few of the issues that I am specifically interested in in
clude: establishing a true "Dead Week" without
classes, increasing services for Row houses including
computer facilities and SUNet connections, reevaluat
ing the university calendar for future years to include a
Christmas break longer than two weeks, and providing
a free condom in every pocket.
Jason Dominguez
Freshman, Undeclared
In order for Stanford to remain a leading educational
institute, it must evolve to meet the changing needs of
society. I would like to become involved in the shaping
of decisions which will keep Stanford at the forefront of
education. Beyond that, I would like to help implement
programs to make everyone's Stanford experience as
enriching as possible. Being here by virtue of your in
telligence and diversity, it would benefit the Stanford
