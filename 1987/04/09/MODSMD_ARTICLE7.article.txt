Having been a graduate student at Stanford for four
years and a graduate senator for one, I believe I am
sensitive to the needs of otheres in the graduate popu
lation, particularly in the areas of funding, housing and
the terms of TA and RA appointments. The ASSU
Senate provides the best campus-wide forum in which
these issues can and should be addressed. By having the
ASSU consider these issues, my overall goal is to help
improve the quality of graduate student life at Stanford.

The graduate and undergraduate senators don't like
each other terribly much. The reason for this enduring
antipathy is that, although graduate and undergraduate
students contribute more or less equally to ASSU fund
ing, the undergraduates — being the extracurricular
little buggers they are — get to go home with most of

the goodies. This makes the graduate senators mad, so
they vote against everything. Having been an under
grad at Stanford myself for the past four years, I can
bring both perspectives to the Senate, thereby encour
aging compromise and breaking the grad-undergrad
senatorial stalemate. See you at the Flicks.

ASSU Graduate Senator, Budget & Finance Commit
tee, Appropriations Committee
As an incumbent ASSU Senator I have experience
and knowledge to my credit. If elected I will continue to
attend meetings and be actively involved in the student
government. 1 can't offer to lower taxes or to try to
make Berkeley a Stanford overseas campus but I can
try to continue to contribute to ASSU spending policy
and represent the issues of the graduate community.

Incumbent ASSU Graduate Senator, 1986-87; Mem
ber, Police-Community Relations Board

I am a current member of the ASSU Senate and was
the only graduate senator during the 1986-87 term who
was endorsed by the progressive People's Platform and
who served in the People's Platform coalition in the
Senate. I am also the endorsed candidate of the Stan
ford chapter of the National Lawyers Guild. If re
elected, I will continue to support the principles of the
People's Platform and the NLG and their agendas, in
cluding divestment, effective non-discrimination
policies, enhanced police-community relations, a less-
Eurocentric undergraduate curriculum, and full
funding to progressive, gay and Third-World student
groups.

I spent my undergraduate years in Buffalo, NY,

Now I work for the Chaparral. How much more
qualified could I be?
