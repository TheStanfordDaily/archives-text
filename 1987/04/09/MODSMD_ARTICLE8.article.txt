ASSU News
Amount requested: $8,040
Sponsor: Scott San Filippo
Senate Recommendation: YES

Sponsor Statement:
When you flip through the Daily and hit the ASSU News page, don't you feel like you almost
have to stop and read some of it, just to see how outrageous it is this week?
It works. It's designed to get people to read it, and it works. People turn to the page, start
reading because it's funny, and end up picking up a little, here and there, about what's happening
in the ASSU. They get information, and they can enjoy getting it
God knows, student government isn't so big a deal that people desperately need to know about it.
But every once in awhile, it can help students or hurt them. Everyone should have the chance to
know what's going on if they want to - and if they don't want to, they can sail get a laugh.
Here's what we publish:
* How much money we're giving to student groups. We give out
$750,000 a year in small pieces — with the News , you can
always check up on how we're doing.
* Ads for jobs in the ASSU. Some are actually good jobs, and
who fills them makes a difference in how helpful we are to
students. Everyone has an equal shot at applying now,
because the jobs are published in the News.
* Role-call votes of the Senate. Senators have been safe in the
past, but no more ~ now it's public how each Senator votes
on controversial issues.
* The Senate's and the COP's projects and goals. They may be
things you're interested in - you can decide whether you
want to get involved or start a recall campaign.
* Announcements of deadlines: funding deadlines, job
applications, come-talk-to-us-before-we-screw-up
deadlines.
* Totally random words and graphics. Rude jokes. Evil
messages. Senator trading cards, and voodoo spells.
We can't guarantee it will stay this funny - there is more information we need to squeeze in,

and the edit board will change. But it gets people information. And it's fun.
Besides all that, it's the smallest Special Fee on the ballot $0.25 per student per quarter,
$0.05 per issue. Almost as cheap as the Daily, and a hell of a lot funnier.

ASSU Speakers Bureau
Amount requested: $59,704
Sponsor: Meg Richman
Senate Recommendation: YES
The Speaker's Bureau is an extremely well-run organization which brings numerous
big-name and controversial speakers to campus. They have received funding from the ASSU
for several years now and have yet to let us down. We would like to see the continuation of
the fine job Speaker's Bureau has done and therefore recommend that you vote YES.

Axe Committee
Amount requested: $23,836
Sponsors: Tom Smegal, Mike Tuchin
Senate Recommendation: YES
These are the people who bring you the traditional events of Big Game Week. In the
interest of future rallies, bonfires, desk blotters and the return of the Stanford Axe to its home,
we strongly support fine Stanford tradition and recommend YES for the Axe Committee.
Sponsor Statement:
After a decade absence, the Big Game Bonfire has been restored to its proper place in Lake
Lagunita. Next year students' hopes for the return of the parade in San Francisco will be
answered. In fact, Stanford students will no longer march along the deserted streets of the
warehouse district. Instead, students will march through the streets of downtown San
Francisco, leading to a rally in Union Square. Both of these events and much, much more are
made possible by the work of the Stanford Axe Committee.
The Stanford Axe Committee, re-organized just three years ago, has grown from eight
members in 1983 to over one hundred this year. The goal of the Axe Committee is to provide
a focus of support for Stanford Athletics and to direct the revival of grand old Stanford
tradition. To this extent, the Axe Committee has "retrieved" the Stanford Banner stolen by
Berkeley, in the 60's. This banner now proudly flies over Stanford Stadium at every home
football game. In addition, once a quarter students can expect to see the Stanford Blotter, a
convenient source of information about campus events and dates.
Next year, the Axe Committee will expand beyond the football season. We will be active in
support of Stanford Basketball and will do the same during Baseball Season. Next year, we
also hope to provide support for other sports as well.
The Axe Committee will receive $8,000 in non-ASSU financial support next year. Despite
this, the many expenses make a fee assessment vital. We feel that the activities of the Axe
Committee, including two of the most attended student events each year, warrant such an
assessment. Thank you for your consideration and BEAT CAL!

Black Student Union
Amount requested: $22,747
Sponsor: Terri James
Senate Recommendation: YES
Sponsor Statement:
The Black Student Union is an educational, cultural, political, and social organization that
has served the Stanford community since 1967. In its twentiety year of existence, the BSU
continues to provide programming and activities which unify the Black community, promote
academic growth, and foster a positive atmosphere at Stanford, in which all students can
enjoy and learn from Black American culture.
Committees with in the BSU help draw in students around their own particular area of
interest. The Western Culture committee is currently the most active and visible committee,
leading the campus in advocating the new "World Culture" Track, the Minority Admissions
committee aids the admissions office in more active recruitment of talented minority students
and planning new programs to address the academic concerns of minority students, and the
Finance committee allocates BSU discretionary funds. In addition, several independent
branches of the BSU include: the Black Pre-Medical Organization, the Society of Black
Scientists and Engineers, the Black Pre-Law Organization, the Black Pre-Business
Association, the Black American Law Students Association, and the Black Recruitment and
Orientation Committee.
The BSU promotes cultural diversity at Stanford, which educates and enriches the entire
Stnaford community. Annual BSU programs include:
Kwanzaa
Martin Luther King Rally, which has featured Julian Bond and Jesse
Jackson
Soul Food Dinner
Malcolm X Rally
The BSU also sponsors and supports speakers, films, and programs that reflect the Black
community's diversity, needs, and concerns.

The Chaparral
Amount requested: $9,333
Sponsor: James R. Suhre
Senate Recommendation: Neutral
The Chappie has been the Stanford humor magazine for many, many years. Every year
they produce several high quality issues. The Senate's major reservation about their budget
was that they charge a small amount for their magazine. The proposed budget, however, calls
for 5 issues, 2 of which will be distributed for FREE, including a spoof of the Daily. The
C aparral hope to use this money to help raise the Chappie to the level it once was. The
Senate offers a NEUTRAL recommendation on the Chapparal.
Sponsor Statement:
Tis better to have lived and laughed than never to have lived at all." This is the motto of
lhe Stanford Chaparral, the one-and-only on-campus humor publication. The Chappie is a
professionally-created periodical which, through the powers of wit and humor, lives up to its
Dlans I ,^ o ' lol iS not a funny F lacc ' but " should bc " In 1987-88, Chappie
plans to increase fromthree issues a year to five, with one being a totally new issue for
incoming freshmen. Chappie charges a mere one buck per issue, a third of what some other

Chicanos In Public Service (ChIPS)
Amount requested: $8,307
Sponsor: Felix Cuevas
Senate Recommendation: Neutral
ChIPS represents a new step in special fee funding. A community service group has never
before asked for a special fee from the ASSU. We feel that the only way to determine if a
precedent should be established is to allow the students to make the decision in the election.
We choose not take a stand on this new issue. The future of this and other community service
special fees lies solely with you...
Sponsor Statement:
For fourteen years Barrio Assistance has tutored children from East Palo Alto Saturday
mornings at Stanford's El Centro. For ten years Project Motivation has encouraged high
school students to seek higher education at places such as Stanford University. For the last
four years both of these groups have had difficulty receiving any sort of funding from the
ASSU due to the nature and focus of their programming: community service. Traditionally,
Barrio Assistance and Project Motivation had been mostly funded by the Program Board. In
recent years, however, the ASSU determined that Program Board funds should be directed to
activities that direcdy benefit students, regardless of the number of Stanford student
volunteers involved in the projects. Consequendy, B.A. and Pro Mo were forced to look
elsewhere for funding. However, because they are student coordinated groups, they have a
difficult time receiving money from educational foundations that require direct school or
university affiliation despite long histories or dedicated volunteers. Unfortunately, university
department funds are also scarce and cannot provide the minimum requirements for operating
expenses. As a result, both organizations have not been able to provide for their usual
community service projects.
Barrio Assistance and Project Motivation have spoken often about combining efforts to seek
funding. The group coordinators are committed to serve the community through action.
Subsequendy, they founded Chicanos in Public Service. Both B.A. and Pro Mo feel that the
student body strongly supports public service and would vote in favor of the ChIPS special
fee. ChIPS is envisioned to be a permanent outlet for students interested in assisting
impoverished and disadvantaged local communities.
The budget reflects two facets of ChIPS: the operating costs are for weekly tutoring of 50
children ranging from kindergarten to the sixth grade, including a breakfast for the children;
and programming expenses for projects organized by both B.A. and Pro Mo. Funds are
particularly needed to continue weekly tutoring of children. Both groups will also continue to
fundraise by writing proposals to educational foundations, corporations, and university
departments.

Club Sports
Amount requested: $73,457
Sponsor: Scott Bommer
Senate Recommendation: YES
Sponsor Statement:
The Club Sports Program at Stanford University represents a return to the player-oriented
concept that characterized the beginning of organized sports in the United States. With the
emphasis on student initiative not only in competition and performance, but also in team
management, the club program provides participants the opportunity to shape thier own
experience to a much greater degree than any other program in the Athletic Department.
The enthusiasm and team pride engendered by this environment are readily perceived by
even the most casual observer, and are reflected by the fact that well over 2000 participants
within the Stanford community currently take pan in one or more of the 29 club sports
offered.
The program is coeducational and exists to provide additional opportunites in competition,
intsruction, and recreation for undergraduate and graduate students, and faculty and staff in an
array of sports which are not funded through other areas of the Stanford Athletic Department.
Included are several clubs that compete and train on the varsity level (rugby and judo, for
example), as well as other clubs that are more recreationally oriented (bowling and cricket).
One student representative from each club attends the Gub Council meetings and casts the
club's vote in any necessary matters. The Club Sports President, elected by the council every
year in the spring, presides over council meetings and heads the budget and steering
committees; he/she is assisted by a Vice-President. The Director of Club Sports, a full-time
administrator paid by the Athletic Department, serves as advisor and oversees all operations.
The Club Council uses its funds to help clubs meet general programming expenses such as
facility and travel costs, essential non-personal equipment, uniforms, and administrative
expenses.

Concert Network I
Amount requested: $33,333
Sponsor: Alexander Danel
Senate Recommendation: Yes . , . . . . ,
This money is for ROCK CONCERTS not Humphrey Who and his harmonica banjo band,
but rather FIVE real rock concerts at Stanford. Salaries will be paid as a percentage of the
net-profits - that is: No Show, No Dough! Next year's Concert Network (under new
management) is going to be exciting, fun and profitable. The Senate has offered their support
and we urge the student body to join us by voting YES for the Concert Network.

Concert Network II
Amount requested: $17,707
Sponsor: Alexander Danel
Senate Recommendation: No
This part of the Concert Network's budget goes only to pay the salary of a faculty advisor
required by the University. The Senate feels that the student body should not be taxed to pay
the salary of a non-student advisor with limited responsibilities. This Senate strongly
recommends that you vote NO on paying this exorbitant salary.
Conditions
The following conditions shall apply to the Concert Network Special Fee request Unless
these conditions are met, without substantial deviation as determined by the ASSU Senate
Appropriations Committee, before the results of this election are certified, the Special Fee
request shall not be considered by the Senate for certification, and no money shall be collected
in support of the fee or disbursed to the Concert Network.
1) The Concert Network shall agree that the Advisor's salary will not be paid by the Concert
Network.
2) The Concert Network shall agree that the Special Fee is to be used solely to subsidize rock
shows on campus during the regular academic year, and that for 1987-88, an average of
one-fifth the Fee or three-quarters of the talent fee, whichever is less, shall be used for each
show. Any remaining funds must be transferred to reserves or used to fund other
reduced-cost or free events for students.
3) The Concert Network shall agree to put in place an incentive salary structure as follows,
with bonuses to be divided proportionally among the staff.
* For determining bonuses, target levels of income shall be set for each event, and
the target level shall be the breakeven point after including any budgeted subsidy.
* Base salaries shall be paid as specified in lines 12-19.
* A fixed per-show bonus shall be paid to the staff for each show produced; this
bonus shall be at least $600 for major events and may be less for smaller events.
* After the amount of above-target revenue on shows has covered the Concert
Network's fixed expenses, at least 30% of the remaining revenue over those expenses
shall be paid to the staff.
* After the amount of above-target revenue exceeds three times the Concert
Network's fixed expenses, at least 50% of the additional revenue shall be paid to the
staff.
Sponsor Statement:
When the Charter for the Concert Network was approved by the University in 1984, one of
the requirements for the organization was that it have an advisor. The purpose of this person
is to establish continuity in the organization, facilitate relationships with other University
Departments, and to provide advice to the Concert Network's student staff. The Concert
Network is required to pay one-third of the advisors salary. A failure to pass this part of the
fee request will leave the Concert Network in a vulnerable position in which it will not be
allowed to pay for its share of the advisor's salary. The Network will be forced to address
this situation in one of three ways: 1) Find another (University) source of funding for the
advisor other than using Concert Network funds; 2) Requesting a line item modification
from the ASSU Senate to pay for its share of the advisor's salary out of other Concert
Network funds; or 3) Refuse any money received from Part 1 of the fee assessment. It is
important to note that it is not likely that a "No" vote on this portion of the fee request will
encourage the University to pay the Concert Network's share of the advisor s salary and that
the Senate has expressed reluctance to allow the Concert Network to pay for the advisor out of
its other revenues. Thus a failure to pass this part of the fee request may be tantamount to
defeating both parts of the fee.

The Daily
Amount requested: $42,667
Sponsor: Barbara Metzler
Senate Recommendation: YES
Sponsor Statement:
The Stanford Daily is the primary vehicle for communicating news and events in the
Stanford community to its 25,000 readers. The Stanford Daily is an independent, non-profit
corporation.
The objectives of The Daily are: 1) to publish a high-quality student newspaper, and 2) to
provide valuable educational experiences to those students involved in publishing The Daily.
In the past two years, The Daily has incurred $46,000 in operating losses. Most of these
can be attributed to higher printing and production costs of a larger paper. During 1986-87,
The Daily significantly streamlined its operation to control costs. The result has been a
smaller newspaper with less room for news, features, photos and reviews. In order to break
even this year, the newspaper must be made up of a higher proportion of paid advertising.
During 1987-88, The Daily will continue to face financial challenges.
* Advertising sales have failed to return to the record level set in 1984-85. This trend has
been observed at newspapers throughout the country.
* The Daily's printer has not increased printing costs in two years. Since the cost of
newsprint has risen, printing costs will undoubtedly go up when the contract is renewed this
spring.
* The Daily has postponed necessary repairs and capital expenditures to respond to lower
revenues.
As a result of these financial pressures, The Daily is requesting money from student fees to
cover the increased costs of typesetting and printing. This money will be used to increase the
size of the paper, increase the number of pages of articles and photographs, and decrease the
percentage of advertising that now makes up the paper.

KZSU Part I
Amount requested: $59,123
Sponsor: Scott A. Martin
Senate Recommendation: YES
KZSU has been providing a necessary service at Stanford for years. They broadcast
Stanford sports events, interviews with important campus officials and music for any and all
tastes. The Senate supports KZSU and recommends that the student body concur. Let's give
KZSU an overwhelming YES vote for the operating budget.
Sponsor Statement:
KZSU is Stanford's non-commercial, educational radio station, operating 24 hours a day 7
days a week, with 500 watts at 90.1 FM. It enables over 150 graduate and undergraduate
students each year to gain hands-on broadcast experience and work-study experience in
electrical engineering. The station's production facilities are utilized an average of 17 hours
per day by KZSU staff, as well as University departments and student groups. The station
also plays a critical role in the University's earthquake preparedness plan, is the focus of a
spring quarter communication class, and is often the conduit through which Stanford faculty
and others are interviewed by major networks.
Programming includes major campus events and speeches, the complete men's football,
basketball, and baseball conference schedules, and interview shows with prominent
University personnel. KZSU plays progressive rock, classic rock, and jazz in a streamlined
college radio format, and features public interst programming for minority groups. Public
service announcements are run for campus organizations and local non-profit groups entirely
free of charge.
In focusing this year on bringing in outside revenue, KZSU is expected to run a modest
budget surplus this year. The station receives no money directly from the University.

What's a radio station without up to date equipment? KZSU music will sound much better
when it is played on their new CD player. The delay box will allow phone-in callers to be
broadcast on the air, with a slight delay to bleep the @#%*'s. The Senate found this to be
absolutely vital to KZSU, so please, vote YES to giving them this necessary equipment.

The Stanford Band provides entertainment for Stanford students, alumni, and other
members of the Stanford community. The Band performs at home football and basketball

played a key role in promoting campus spirit during Big Game week. Therefore, the Senate
heartily recommends a YES vote on the Band's operating budget.

The Band (LS JUMB) Part IT
Amount requested: $6,667
Sponsor: Todd E. Olson
Senate Recommendation: No
The Senate divided the Band's budget into its operating and pre-season trip components to
provide the students the opportunity to decide whether or not to fund the trip. The Senate
believes the trip predominantly benefits the participating Band members NOT the Stanford
community at large. Therefore, because most students would not benefit from this excursion,
we feel they should not pay for it and strongly recommend a NO vote on the trip budget.
Sponsor Statement:
The Leland Stanford Junior University Marching Band (LSJUMB) performs at Stanford
events year-round, both athletic and otherwise, to build spirit in campus activities and make
life on the Farm fun. Such events include athletic competitions, all-campus rallies, the bonfire
rally, the San Francisco rally. Gaieties, campus-wide parties, and student organized activites
such as Special Olympics. Finally, the Band plays a major role in Freshman Orientation.
The LSJUMB is student run. As such, it also provides an excellent opportunity for any
Stanford student who joins to become actively and creatively involved in campus life.
However, as a student organization we must rely on the student body for funding, thus we
are requesting support for a pre-quarter trip to Colorado. On such trips the Band brings long
missed spirit to distant alums, new-found campus spirit to freshmen, and much needed
support for the football team.
In addition, these trips are essential in the preparation of the Band for the coming year.
Band members leave homes, jobs and pay checks and then spend a week on the road honing
their musical and comical skills to the level of quality entertainment that you expect at the
beginning of the fall. (Next fall will mark three years since we have had such a full-band trip.
I believe this past fall speaks for itself in demonstrating the effects of this lack of preparation).
So, as you can see, a pre-quarter trip benefits every student who has ever enjoyed the Band.
And, the price is right. For only 16 cents per quarter you'll be getting a better Band.

Senate Recommendation: YES
The Stanford Latino Student Alliance sponsor events that are open to the entire Stanford
family including the annual Cinco de Mayo Dinner. They offer cultural and educational
programming. Their events are well organized and benefit many people. The senate
recommends a YES vote for SaLSA.
Sponsor Statement:
SaLSA is a new group which will unify the annual schedule of programs that has been
offered by the Stanford Chicano community for over 5 years. SaLSA's aim is to continue
providing the Stanford community with cultural programs to heighten the expression of
Chicano art and culture. In addition, SaLSA will offer academic programs to increase
awareness of social and political issues affecting the Mexican-American population of the
United States.
The governing body of this organization will be composed of the leaders of the independent
Chicano theme voluntary student organizations and two financial managers who will be
responsible for disbursement of funds, financial reports, and the general coordination of
SaLSA's efforts. The organization will be apolitical in nature and focused on the
programming and organization.
SaLSA's special fee budget includes such established events as the Ballet Folklorico de
Stanford's Spring Concert, the Chicano Student Activities Committee's Dia de los Muertos,
La Gran Posada, and Latinos in the Professions academic seminar series, the Cinco de Mayo
Dinner, the Stanford Assocation for Latino Issues' film series featuring screenings of such
works as "Latino," "Salvador," and "Salt of the Earth," and the quarterly publication "Estos
Tiempos."
In addition, we are proposing additional programs that are not offered through present
ASSU services: a Latino Speaker's Bureau that will bring prominent Latino speakers (e.g.
Henry Cisneros, Federico Pena, Delores Huerta, Toney Anaya); a Teatro Campesino
performance (Latino Drama Troupe); and small scale Latino concerts (trios, Gabino
Palomares, Nueva Cancion).
Most of the proposed programming, then, includes programs which have been annually
presented to the ASSU through the discretionary cycles. In addition, we have included other
programming that is not usually funded through Program Board.
The benefits to the community are many. Attendance to some of our events have been as
follows: Cinco de Mayo Dinner (500+); Latino Screening (400+); Ballet Folklorico (500+);
Academic Seminars (100+); Gran Posada (350+); Dia de los Muertos (150+) and Gabino
Palomares (100+). In addition, all the proposed events would take place in large auditoriums
to accommodate interested students.

is a newly formed non-profit, student-run organization designed to provide safe
transportation and sober drivers to students who are too intoxicated to drive or who don't
wish to ride with an intoxicated driver. This organization is a great illustration of what student
initiative can produce on the Stanford campus, involving a large number of students while
benefitting an even larger number. The Senate applauds this initiative and strongly urges a
YES vote for this great new group!

Student Channel
Amount requested: $36,060
Sponsor: Alexander Danel
Senate Recommendation: YES
The Student Channel is a new organization and while we feel that it could fulfill an
important campus media role, the students should decide if this is an organization which
merits funding. The Student Channel has demonstrated a series of organizational problems
which are currently being ironed out, but prevent us from soundly endorsing it. We would
like to see the development of this organization but have some reservations about its structure.
Sponsor Statement:
This university has just created an internal cable network, SUNet, and has allocated one of
the available video channels for students. Before the cable's trenches were covered, various
visionaries already began banding together, getting trained and organized. This continuously
expanding, lively bunch has survived the birth trauma, dealt with the red tape, and secured
itself as the official caretakers SUNet Channel Ten. The group's official name is "Student
Channel," but you will know it as XTV.
The goal of the Student Channel is to get you involved. Like Andy Warhol said, "everyone
will be famous for fifteen minutes." Stanford has a wealth of diverse, interesting, televisable
activities happening all the time. It seems every student participates in some activity, like
sports or drama or chess club—the Student Channel is your way to get your activity recorded
and on the tube. Heck, we're even willing to telecast the ASSU Senate, (if we can keep the
camera-man awake.) •
XTV is going to create programming, too. Video production is creative, hard work, and a
lot of fun. Like rowing, a video crew has to pull together. XTV is creating opportunities for
people to feel the thrill.
The following exerpts from its constitution reflect the Student Channel s commitment to
fulfill the trust invested in us by awarding us a spot on the SUNet cable system.
The founding and continuing goals of the Student Channel are the enhancement of
communication within the Stanford community and the fulfillment of creative expression by
Stanford students. .. . ...,..
The Student Channel recognizes that because we are a mass media, we have responsibiliues
to our audience and potential audience. We seek to provide programming that will educate,
inform, and entertain the viewing audience. Educational programs and public service
announcements are an important part of our responsibilities. Our staff must maintain
reasonable and high standards for the technical and aesthetic quality of programming. Our
actions and intentions must always be creative and constructive.
The Student Channel is commited to providing equal opportunities for access by all Stanford
students. Our programming seeks to give balanced representation to the diverse viewpoints
and the variety of student groups of this university. , , , .
Consistent with the objectives set forth above, the Student Channel needs to leam the
opinions of its audience, and the community in general, regarding the quality and content of
its programming. We will give reasonable consideration and response to all such opinions.
In addition, Student Channel's operations wiU be devoted to training and instnicting
interested Stanford students in the workings of cable television and broadcast. We thus
recognize that much of our responsibility is to our own staff as well as to our audience; to
educate our personnel as well as our viewers; and to provide a pleasant working and/or
learning environment in which they can function to the best of their abilities.

Stanford Action
Amount requested: $14,467
Sponsor: Dixon Osbum
Senate Recommendation: YES
Stanford Action is responsible for the Stanford Action Faire put on at the beginning of fall
quarter in which student groups have a chance to gain exposure on campus and solicit new
members. Since registration has been moved out of Maples Pavilion, this is the only event of
its kind now offered on campus. In the interest of equal exposure for campus groups we
recommend YES for Stanford Action.
Sponsor Statement:
If you involve yourself in any extracurricular organization at Stanford, if you are interested
in academics, athletics, community services, creative or performing arts, ethnic or cultural
pursuits, the media and publications, political and social activism, recreation, religion or
studftnt government, you should look to Stanford Action. As the newest service project for
the ASSU, Stanford Action presents itself as a student organization which 1. provides a
strong, unified voice to student concerns, such as the need for student office space and
conference facilities, and the need for consolidated and centralized information regarding
University policies and services to students; 2. provides relevant and current information
about student extracurricular activities to the Stanford student body and to other student
organizations; and 3. links all student organizations on campus to ensure that all students
benefit from a well-planned variety of events on campus.
Witness the first annual Stanford Action Faire this past Autumn. We coordinated 133
student organizations on two days, allowing the Stanford community to explore the
extracurricular opportunities available to them and allowing student groups to publicize their
organizations, generate interest in the community and strengthen their group by accepting
applicants. Stanford Action distributed surveys concerning the need for student office space
as the initial step toward rectifying the need for additional workspace for student groups. And
Stanford Action distributed surveys concerning the speakers Stanford students most wanted to
hear on campus.
If you have ever faced problems thrown at you by the University with regard to
extracurricular activities or if you have just wanted to leam more about or from student
groups, you should help strengthen Stanford Action's role in assisting students. If you
approve our budget, we will have the financial strength to present two Stanford Action Faires
annually, create a definitive guide to student involvement at Stanford which will be distributed
to all students before their arrival at Stanford, and undertake the projects and questions which
concern you most.

SURE
Amount requested: $47,093
Sponsors: Julie Ann Yuen, Rudy Fuentes
Senate Recommendation: YES
SURE (Stanford United for Rape Elimination) has recently been made an ASSU business
project. The Senate feels that this, along with a recent revision of SURE's bylaws, will give
the organization the added strength and structure to make it a valuable asset to the Stanford
community. SURE's hours of operation will increase and its benefit to students will be
expanding. The Senate recommends a YES vote for an established organization. Your YES
vote will make a good thing even better.
Sponsor Statement:
Stanford United for Rape Elimination (SURE) is a student-run organization, whose primary
purpose is to provide safe and reliable protection to persons walking or biking alone on
campus at night. SURE offers dispatched bicycle, golf-can, or walking escorts.
Upon dispatch, an escort will come directly to the caller and will accompany the caller to
her/his desination. Escorts will go anywhere on the Stanford campus.
SURE also provides golf-cart shuttle service, which leaves hourly from Meyer and Green
libraries and from Tresidder Union and goes to each rider's destination.
Three escorts work each night, seven days per week, and are paid $5.50 per hour. Escorts
may be female or male. During the first seven weeks of Autumn Quarter, escorts work from
8 pm to 12 midnight. FOr the remainder of Autumn Quarter and for the entirety of Winter
Quarter, escorts work from 6pm to 12 midnight. During Spring Quarter, escorts work from
8 pm to 12 midnight.
SURE has been in existence for about ten years. During those ten years, the service has
expanded from volunteer escorts to paid escorts for increased reliability, and from walking
escorts to golf cart escorts for increased speed and mobility. We are looking forward to next
year as a year of even further development.
The need for this program has been evidenced by the strong support SURE has received in
past ASSU elections. The Stanford campus in nd as safe and insulated from crime as many
of us would believe.
For the past five years, SURE has been operating with two golf carts. Golf cart service is
greatest when we are using two carts. However, the golf carts are also the source of our
greatest frustrations: the carts frequently need repairs, and they have been stolen and
vandalized. Despite the frustrations, we remain convinced that golf carts best fit our purposes
because they, unlike cars, are able to get into every nook on campus. This year, we are
purchasing one new cart (we sold one last summer), and we hope to purchase another next
year, trading in the one we now have.
Another development which we would like to see is salaried directors. Many of SURE's
problems could be alleviated by committed and motivated directors. Students have many time
and energy committments; a salary would provide incentive to make SURE a high priority,
thus ensuring smoother operation of the program in the future. Salaried directors would be
especially crucial for next year, as we see the upcoming year as a time for the reevaluation and
solidifying of the SURE Escort Service.
