Problem: Presently, almost all (with exception of Volunteer Networks Reach Out Today)
voluntary student organizations sponsoring community service activities are not funded
through the ASSU for their public service programs. This is due to the established
regulations that prohibit the allotment of Program Board funds to activities not directly
affecting the immediate Stanford student community. In addition, some primary costs such as
food and transportaion are also excluded through the funding regulations.
Goal: To establish a find for community service programs developed by voluntary student
organizations through the present funding mechanism - the Program Board.
Solution: A Community Service General Fee - This General Fee would establish a community
service fund that the Program Board can draw from when funding operating and
programming expenses of community service activities that it would otherwise not fund
because of the present Program Board funding guidelines.
Distinction from Program Board Fee: The major distinction is the costs that would be funded
through the fee. We see the Community Service fund as funding operating and programming
costs for public service activities - integral food, transportation, resource, and development
costs. For example, the Charity Carnival and a variety of tutorial program costs for food, and
transportation for East Palo Alto children are not funded throueh the ASSU, this fund would
cover those costs. Some other clear examples will be given by Program Board Director,
Robin Miller, during the Senate meeting.
Guidelines for the fund will be drawn after the General Fee passes. We are initiating this
working guideline that follows to use when discussing the fee with the Daily and students.
"The Community Service General Fee will fund operating and programming expenses of
Community Service activities initiated and executed by Stanford voluntary student
organizations with priority given to programs and projects within the immediate geographic
areas. Expenditures such as food and travel that play an integral part of an organization's
programming may be covered through this General Fee."
Realize that any guidelines set for the fee have to be passed through by Administration and
Rules Committee and the Senate. This gives you the ultimate decision on the guidelines for
the fee.
We are asking that the Senate allow this Community Service Special Fee to be placed on the
Spring ballot. Realize that the establishment of a new General Fee requires the vote of 2/3 of
the Senate student voting populace. It is for this reason that we urge a strong and positive
recommendation from the Senate for the establishment of this General Fee.

There is an established need and the Community Service General Fee is the mechanism we
are initiating as a working solution. This effort is another example on how to further develop
the services offered through the ASSU. If you have any questions on the fee feel free to call
Rudy Fuentes at 725-1465 or 324-3412 or Felix Cuevas 327-1810.
Senate Recommendation: YES
A STRONG AND ACTIVE YES. The Senate unanimously voted in favor of this General
Fee. We have never seen such an important and worthwhile initiative placed on the ballot in
the entire histoiy of Stanford. All over campus student community service projects have
dramatically increased both in number and in scope. Unfortunately, funds have not followed
suit. The time is long overdue to actively support Stanford student public service efforts.
Projects that work with the elderly, children, hunger, poverty, and a variety of other concerns
will benefit greatly from this fund. Organizations like Reach Out Today projects, Barrio
Assistance, Stanford Special Olympics, and numerous Stanford Volunteer Network programs
have endorsed the Community Service General Fee. FEEL GOOD ABOUT LIFE: VOTE
YES! Make Felix and Rudy happy.
Program Board General Fee
Sponsor Statement:
The Program Board General Fee serves the vast majority of student organizations. It provides
funds for educational and cultural programming on campus, and is administered and distributed by
the Program Board.
Publications Board General Fee
Sponsor Statement:
The ASSU Publications Board is responsible for supporting and encouraging student
publications at Stanford. Because we believe that publications greatly enhance the quality of life at
Stanford we try to help keep current publications going while also encouraging new groups to
publish. Our funds are used both to supply student publications with the resources they need
(including the Publications Room in Storke Building) while contributing money to the publications'
budgets. The majority of the publications we fund rely heavily on our financial support and could
not exist without our assistance. Many of our publications are now ready to expand and improve
their journals, but cannot because we don't currently have adequate financial resources. It is only
because of student support in the past that you can now enjoy such publications as the Chapparral,
Dial Tone, Estos Tiempos, Sequoia, and The Real News. With your continued financial support
we can bring you even more quality publications. A few dollars from each tuition check can go a
long way toward allowing student publications to continue to foster the open discussion of ideas
and opinions at Stanford. Thank you for your support.
