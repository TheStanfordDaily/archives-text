News analysis

The Senate and House Inves
tigating committees, which have
combined their efforts, are main
taining silence in order to
"preserve relations with the wit
nesses so they will cooperate," ac
cording to House committee
spokesman Gerry Cacciotti. He
also said that the committees are
not releasing information because
they are in the process of
"structuring" their testimony for
the televised hearings scheduled
to begin May 5.
Cacciotti, a 1985 Stanford
graduate, would not comment on
whether the committee had con
tacted W, Glenn Campbell, direc
tor of the Hoover Institution at
Stanford, or Charles Meyers,
former dean of the Law School.
Both men are on the three
member Intelligence Oversight
Board (IOB), a presidential advi
sory board mentioned by the
Tower Commission in in its dis
cussion of the Iran-contra affair.
The third member of the 108 is
Charles Tyroler, a Democrat who
has been the executive director of
the Committee on the Present
Danger since its founding In
1976. Campbell has been on the
croup's board of directors since
1976.
According to a spokesman for
the Committee on the Present
Danger, the research and educa
tion organization is a bipartisan
group dedicated to a "common
belief that the Soviet Union was
developing military superiority
over the United States."
Another Hoover Institution
scholar is also associated with the
108. Senior Fellow Martin Ander
son is a consultant to the board,
according to the Hoover Institu
tion's 1986 annual report.
The Tower Commission report
on the Iran-contra matter states
that Lt. Col. Oliver North and Vice
Admiral John Poindexter appar
ently received legal advice from the
108 exempting them from a con
gressional ban on lethal aid to the
contra rebels fighting Nicaragua's
Sandinlsta government.
A document outlining the lOB's
legal advice to White House offi
cials was found in North's White
House safe. The letterhead had
been removed from the document,

but it resembled "other memor
anda prepared for the NSC
(National Security Council) by the
IOB," the Tower report states.
The 108 did not provide a copy
of this document to the Tower
commission when asked for all
memoranda "providing legal ad
vice to the NSC staff in 1985 and
1986," according to the board's
report.
The Tower report indicates that
the 108 advice was solicited in
response to a letter sent in August
1985 by Michael Barnes, then a
Democratic congressman from
Maryland.
Barnes, who is now practicing
law in Washington, said yesterday
he had written a letter to then na
tional security adviser Robert
McFarlane after the media began
to report on contra support activ
ity by North. At that time
McFarlane said that the NSC staff
was not violating the law.
But Barnes maintained yester
day that North was violating a
1984 congressional act prohibit

ing the Defense Department. CIA
or any other agency or entity
"involved In intelligence activities"
from directly or indirectly sup
porting military operations in
Nicaragua. Barnes said that he
was unaware of the lOB's legal
opinion at the time.
"Whoever gave the legal advice
gave improper advice in my per
sonal opinion," Barnes said.
According to the Tower commis
sion report, the lOB's legal advice
hinged on a presidential executive
order that defined the NSC as the
"highest Executive Branch entity"
instead of part of "the Intelligence
Community."
The Tower commission report
did not take a position on the
merit of the legal advice given by
the 108, but did say that it was
"an odd source" for the advice.
"It would be one thing for the In
telligence Oversight Board to
review the legal advice provided by
some other agency," the report
states. "It is another for the Intelli
gence Oversight Board to be

originating legal advice of its
own."
According to Reagan's Execu
tive Order 12334, the 108 is
charged with reporting any un
lawful intelligence activities di
rectly to the President. The 108
mandate includes reviewing the
practices and procedures of the
intelligence community and con
ducting investigations when ne
cessary to cariy out its functions.
The Tower commission also
questioned the political wisdom of
North's activity.
"Even if it could be argued that
(the congressional) restrictions
did not technically apply to the
NSC staff, these activities pre
sented great political risk to the
president. The appearance of the
president's personal staff doing
what Congress had forbade other
agencies to do could, once dis
closed, only touch off a firestorm
in the Congress and threaten the
administration's whole policy on
the contras," the report con
cludes.
