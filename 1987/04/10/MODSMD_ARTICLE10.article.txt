Reagan retreats on arms control
WASHINGTON — President Reagan. In a major shift, has
decided to retreat further from major arms control proposals he
made at the Reykjavik summit last fall, reducing from 10 years to
five the time he is willing to accept treaty-imposed limits on the
Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI), senior administration officials
said yesterday.
Reagan, in a defeat for the State Department and a victory for
the Defense Department, instructed Secretary of State George
Shultz to tell Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze in
Moscow next week that the United States is willing to abide by the
Antiballlstic Missile (ABM) treaty constraints on SDI for five years
from the point that a new arms-reduction treaty takes effect, the
officials said. At the Reykjavik summit in October, the adminis
tration said it would abide by the treaty constraints until at least
1996.
Reagan also authorized Shultz to tell the Soviets that a so-called
50 percent reduction in strategic arms cannot be completed by the
end of 1991. as he had proposed at Reykjavik, but must take place
over seven years from the point that a new treaty takes effect, the
officials said.
Gorbachev ready for summit
LONDON — Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev is prepared to
travel to Washington this year to sign an arms-control agreement,
Soviet Ambassador to Britain Leonid Zamyatin said here yester
day.
He said the possibility of such an agreement, eliminating
intermediate-range nuclear forces (INF) from Europe, will largely
be determined by U.S. Secretary of State George Shultz's visit to
Moscow next week.
Zamyatin, a member of the Communist Party Central Commit
tee and former chief Soviet government spokesman, gave added
weight to Indications that Moscow is placing the highest level of
importance on the Shultz visit. As a result of the secretary's talks
there, he said, instructions could be given to representatives at
the Geneva arms talks to "speed up" an accord that could be
finalized "in a few months."
"Everything depends on what Mr. Shultz comes to Moscow
with," Zamyatin told a group of American reporters. "If he comes
with the clear intention of. . . agreement, then it is all right." The
Soviets would expect an INF accord to be signed by Gorbachev and
President Reagan in the U.S. capital before the end of the year, he
said. "But if (Shultz) comes with empty hands, then there is no
sense in arranging another summit."
Soviets elevate espionage dispute
MOSCOW — The Kremlin warmed up the espionage dispute
with Washington yesterday by displaying a variety of electronic lis
tening devices that it said were planted by U.S. agents in Soviet
diplomats' offices and homes in Washington, New York and San
Francisco.
Two days after President Reagan accused Soviet officials of
"bugging" a new U.S. Embassy building in Moscow, a Foreign
Ministry official showed the listening devices and other "material
evidence" to reporters and said that the United States was clearly
responsible.
The elaborate nature of the presentation, including not only
microphones and transmitters but color photographs of them,
suggested that it had been prepared well in advance.
But a Soviet security official said that some of the devices were
removed from the new Soviet Embassy building in Washington
only a few days ago. Other eavesdropping equipment was discov
ered long ago, in the 19705, the official said.
Senate increases aid to homeless
WASHINGTON — The Senate yesterday passed a bill that would
allow the government to spend an additional >423 million this
year for housing, food, mental health and job training programs
for the nation's 300,000 homeless.
The 85-12 vote came only after the Senate broke a stalemate
over congressional pay increases that had threatened to scuttle
the bill. Voting 68-29, the Senate ruled out of order a proposal to
add to the homeless bill an amendment to repeal the recent
• 12,100-a-year pay raise for members of Congress.
"America's homeless have been waiting for a long time to be
taken seriously, and this is the first serious effort by the federal
government to help them," said Maria Foscarinis, the chief Wash
ington lobbyist for the National Coalition for the Homeless. The
Senate bill, she said, is "a major first step."
Czechs cheer for Gorbachev
PRAGUE, Czechoslovakia — More than 150,000 residents of the
Czechoslovak capital turned out yesterday to cheer Kremlin leader
Mikhail Gorbachev as he brought his campaign for economic and
political changes to the country where Soviet tanks crushed a
home-grown reform movement 19 years ago.
In an atmosphere of cautious hope and open curiosity, they
waved from balconies, cheered from crowded sidewalks and
climbed onto lampposts for a glimpse of the man whom many
called a symbol of hope for change In their own country as well as
in the Soviet Union.
"The working people believe in him," said Jana Hruskova, a
Russian-language student who shook hands with the Soviet Com
munist Party chief as he arrived for talks with Czechoslovak leader
Gustav Husak at the Hradcany Castle overlooking the city.
She said one young man called out from the crowd, "Misha (the
Russian equivalent for Mike), stay here with us!"
But, she said. Gorbachev replied: "There is no need to stay here.
I see that we will be friends forever." Gorbachev and his wife.
Ralsa, were in Prague on the first day of a three-day visit to an ally
whose leadership was installed after Soviet troops and other War
saw Pact forces ousted the reformist government headed by Alex
ander Dubcek.

dynasty emperors, adventurous tourists with extra cash can now

ucts and services now being offered to civilian customers by
China's defense industries, the People's Liberation Army, and
other military-related Institutions.

growing cosmetics industry. It is now reported to be one of the
