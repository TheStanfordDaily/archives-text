# House rejects Reagan's budget
## 
### 
WASHINGTON - The House brushed aside
President Reagan's budget yesterday and ap
proved a Democratic trillion-dollar budget
resolution featuring higher taxes and lower
defense outlays.
The vote, 230-192, followed party lines as
the Democrats Insisted that the president
must change his mind about tax increases.
"Everyone in this town knows we can't solve
this problem without significant revenues,"
Rep. Marvin Leath, D-Texas, said, "The presi
dent knows that."
But Republicans were equally adamant In
their rejection of new taxes. "If you vote for this
proposal, you're voting for more taxes," Rep.
Harold Rogers, R-Ky., said. "Take that and tell
It to your home folks."
Any tax Increases would be imposed on
gasoline, beer, wine and cigarettes, the burden
of which would fall most heavily on "your
middle-income, average taxpayer," Rep.
William Thomas, R-Calif., warned.
The House budget represents "the standard
Democratic formula for excess spending. . . .
It takes money away from people and gives it
back to them," White House spokesman Marlin

Fltzwater told reporters aboard Air Force One
as President Reagan flew to West Lafayette,
Ind., for a speech at Purdue University. "We're
opposed to tax increases and opposed to
defense cuts." Fltzwater said.
The Senate will vote later this month on its
spending resolution. Its Budget Commitee has
recommended a package of tax increases and
spending cuts simlliar to the House program.
The House resolution sets a total spending
limit for the federal government during fiscal
1988, which begins Oct. 1. But the actual
spending for specific programs will be set later
by the appropriations committees.
After their defeat yesterday. House
Republicans vowed to continue to fight. "I
reminded Democrats that President Reagan
has pledged to veto any broad new taxes," said
Rep. Delbert Latta, R-Ohio, the ranking Re
publican on the House Budget Committee.
"Thus, If the Democrat majorities in both
houses of Congress persist on new taxes, they
could precipitate a stalemate."
Yesterday's House vote makes clear the
sharp differences in spending priorities be-

tween the administration and congressional
Democrats.
The president sought to increase defense
spending *8 billion above current levels, while
the House voted for a *9 billion reduction.
Both budgets called for lower domestic spend
ing, but the amounts differed widely. Reagan
wanted cuts totaling *22 billion, compared
with *9 billion ordered in the House resolu
tion.
As opposed to the *6 billion hike in tax reve
nues supported by the president, the House
resolution calls for *18 billion in unspecified
new taxes. In addition, the Democratic plan
projects * 1 billion from increased tax enforce
ment and *2 billion from so-called user fees
and premiums charged for governmental
services.
Any tax increases would be imposed on
gasoline, beer, wine and cigarettes, the burden
of which would fall most heavily on "your
middle-income, average taxpayer," Rep.
William M. Thomas. R-Calif., warned.
