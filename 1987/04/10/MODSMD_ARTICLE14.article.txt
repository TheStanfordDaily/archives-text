## 
### A.J. THOMAS Staff writer 
Andy Warhol foresaw a world In which everyone
would be famous for 15 minutes. We may not live In
that world yet. but the Student Channel hopes to
bring Stanford a litte bit closer.
The Student Channel, a group of about 80 stu
dents interested in television production and broad
casting, will air its first programming Monday. It will
broadcast on SUNet, the University's internal cable
network.
The Student Channel offers Stanford students an
opportunity to get involved in all aspects of cable tele
vision production, said Chief Announcer David
Andrews.
"You can do anything from making your own pro
duction to practicing your TV skills to working in ad
ministration," Andrews said. "You can even be an
engineer."
According to Andrews, the Student Channel was
conceived a year ago as an offshoot of the Stanford
Instructional Television Network (SITN), which had
aired engineering classes and public service pro
grams on SUNet.
Andrews said the Student Channel, whose call let
ters are XTV, plans initially to broadcast between 20
and 30 hours of programming a week.
Slated for Monday are the first episode of "General
Dormitory," a soap opera made by Stanford stu
dents. and a program called Inside Stanford Sports
that will feature interviews and footage of Stanford
athletes.

Andrews said XTV will also show student Inter
views conducted randomly this week in White Plaza,
as well as about 20 hours of programming provided
by National College Television.
In the future, the Student Channel plans to air a
news show, an arts and entertainment program.
Communication Department films, and live events
from the Coffee House.
Plans to carry sports events "are pretty long
range," Andrews said, because covering sports re
quires more than one camera.
"We're a bare-bones operation right now." Andrews
added, noting that the group presently has its studio
and offices in a "dormitory-sized room" in Jordan
Quad.
Andrews said the Student Channel will begin
training video jockeys, or VJs, next week. VJs will
play video tapes, read news and promotional an
nouncements and possibly conduct live interviews,
he said.
So far, a core group of about 15 students has been
responsible for getting the Student Channel organ
ized and ready to go on the air, Andrews said.
Andrews said the Student Channel has received
funding from alumni donations, Residential Educa
tion. the Engineering Department and the ASSU.
The Student Channel is also seeking a fee request in
the upcoming ASSU general election.
The Student Channel will broadcast on SUNet
channel 10 beginning at 7 p.m. Monday. Branner,
Governor's Corner, Lagunita, Roble, Stern and Wil
bur halls are currently connected to the SUNet cable.
