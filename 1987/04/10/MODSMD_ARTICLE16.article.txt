## THE 						STANFORD DAILY An Independent Newspaper Council of Presidents 
### 
Each year, prospective Council of Presi
dents slates and senate candidates run for
office promising to reform student govern
ment. Each year sees a new wave of eager and
ambitious candidates, fervent in their
crusades to change the ASSU for the better
and hopeful they will be elected to office.
And each year, it seems, the ASSU remains
unchanged. Students still complain about
needless bureaucracy, overly formal
processes and incompetence. Senators
themselves often become disgusted with the
process; two years ago, a slew of senators and
a member of the COP resigned out of sheer
frustration with the system.
Given all this, it's no wonder students of
ten scoff at the lofty proposals of idealistic
COP slates. The attitude is one of resigna
tion: Regardless of what a slate promises, the
ASSU will not change, so it's pointless even
to consider a slate's plans. While this atti
tude may be easily fallen into, it's not an en
tirely productive one.
Candidates for office — any office — must
be considered on the basis of their experi
ence and their plans for the position. If a can
didate has a history of commitment and re
sponsibility and promises to continue in that
manner in his or her new position, that
should be reason enough for voter support.
Of the four slates running for ASSU Coun
cil of Presidents, two stand out. Members of
both "The Plan" and"The Equalizers" are
knowledgeable about student government,
have enthusiasm for the job and are qualified
to serve. The Equalizers, however, offer a bet-
Referendum one
SOSA proposal
Recommendation: YES
Yesterday, The Daily recommended a "No"
vote on this referendum. However, the refer
endum as The Daily received it — and as
published in the ASSU elections handbook
— is incorrect. The referendum simply calls
upon the Board of Trustees to consider a
SOSA proposal calling for total divestment. It
does not call upon the University to divest of
all its South Africa-related holdings.

ter choice for COP.
The Equalizers have concrete ideas to im
prove student relations with their govern
ment. To better communications between
students and the ASSU, the slate plans to
hold office hours in White Plaza, conduct
straw polls of the student body on a regular
basis, speak at house meetings and institute
a COP complaint hotline.
The slate has other ideas to improve stu
dent government. They plan to create a Food
Service Task Force, which would serve as a
liaison between students and University
Food Service; an Entertainment Bureau,
which would help students plan and organ
ize parties; and a Minority Task Force, which
would investigate issues such as minority
admissions.
All these ideas have merit, and, if imple
mented, would doubtless serve students well.
The mere fact that other slates have pro
posed similar ideas in the past — and have
not followed through on their promises —
should not unduly bias students this year.
The Equalizers have a level of dedication
and enthusiasm that very well might mean
real action and improvement in the ASSU.
The members of the slate are qualified and
committed to the COP; they plan to remain at
Stanford over the summer to get a head start
on implementing their plans. And they have
proposed several good ideas for making the
ASSU more responsive to student concerns.
Voters should take the slate on its word. The
Equalizers deserve student support on Tues
day and Wednesday.
The trustees should more heavily weigh
student concerns when making decisons
that affect the University. Last year, students
voted overwhelmingly to support total divest
ment; nevertheless, the trustees have contin
ued to follow a policy of selective divestment.
This referendum is a good idea. Regardless
of whether one supports total divestment,
the referendum deserves support. The trus
tees should value student concerns at least
enough to consider the SOSA proposal,
which is all the referendum asks them to do.
