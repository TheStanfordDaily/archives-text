Foothills need
to be preserved
Bravo to the action of the 12
former chairmen of the Faculty
Senate! Bravo to Prof. Craig Hel
ler of Human Biology! Bravo to
the ASSU! Each of these individ
uals or groups has spoken out in
reasoned opposition to the siting
of the Ronald Reagan Presidential
Library. The library may be
Stanford-bound, which disap
points me, but at least some are
speaking up about its size and
about its location.
I have seen the photos, I have
seen the model in Green Library, I
have been out to Lagunita to look
across to the swale that the
Reagan Library will supposedly
nestle in. I am no structural en
gineer and I know little about
what the Stanford Planning Of
fice does; nonetheless. I agree
with Prof. Heller: I don't see how

the library will fit into the foothill
swale.
Regardless of whether or not it
will fit there (or if it will take 15
years to soften its presence), I am
disappointed that it will be up
there at all. The foothills behind
the campus have meant much to
generations of Stanford students.
Long before "The Dish" was in
place, Stanford students walked
those foothills at dawn, dusk and
midnight. From Steinbeck's days
on the Farm to the present, those
foothills have been a magical
place to us sill. Those foothills are
an important part of this Univer
sity's heritage. Isn't the future of
this institution tied closely to its
past? Isn't that one of the
keystones of the current massive
fund drive?
The library may be coming, and
there may be little that can be
done about that. I think that the
present siting of the library will
prove the beginning of the end of
a cherished part of this Univer-

sity. I applaud the efforts of some
on campus who are trying to help
preserve the foothills of Stanford.
Keep it up.

Was woman
'deprived'?
In a recent article "the mother
from Co-Madres" explained how
she was interrogated "for a period
of 13 days while being deprived of
both food and water" (Daily, April
3). It was my understanding that
a person could not survive 13
days without water. If this is true,
then either The Daily got the facts
wrong or quoted a rather inept
liar. Is it possible that "deprived"
should read "put on reduced
rations of?" I would be grateful if
someone could clarify this.
