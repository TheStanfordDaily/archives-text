# Sexuality and the Reagan Right
## 
### 
I was bemused by the recent article about
Tom Bethell, the visiting media fellow at the
Hoover Institution who belittles the University
for not preaching sexual abstinence to stu
dents rather than "safe sex" (Daily. April 3).
Bethell pushes the line that giving condoms
to students promotes promiscuity. Education
Secretary William Bennett and other
Reaganauts have been sounding this claim all
year. We are used to accepting the protest at
face value: give condoms to young people and
you are suggesting to them to have sex.

The real question of how condoms promote
sex is quite different and reveals the true char
acter of right-wing Christian morality.
Condoms decimate the probability of con
tracting AIDS and effectively receiving the
death penalty for having sex. By taking away
the death penalty for sex. condoms "promote"
sex. Not only is this objectively the real Issue,
but if you listen to the religious right you will
hear them trumpet It quite openly. I used to
fool around In catechism class, but I know this
isn't the Christian morality the nuns tried to
teach me.
Bethell charges that the media and the Uni
versity treat AIDS as "a greater threat to the
sexual revolution than to the health of
America. " What an ugly piece of dissembling â€”
it is Bethell and the Reagan/religious right
who oppose safe-sex education In order to
press their battle against the sexual revolu
tion.
They want a death penalty for sex. and have

the gall to accuse others of putting social goals
above public health. All anyone else is trying to
do is get the information out. The kindest con
jecture one can make about these Reaganauts
is that they are too stupid to understand what
they are advocating.
Even Bethell's use of the word "promiscuity"
is a red herring, as the only other sexual be
havior he mentions is abstinence. Maybe Beth
ell defines any sexual activity outside of mar
riage as promiscuous. If so he should buy a
dictionary to go with his Bible. Webster's Dic
tionary defines promiscuous as "characterized
by a lack of discrimination, especially in sexual
liaisons."
If Bethell knew anything about Stanford he
would know that the hang-ups here are quite
the opposite of promiscuity. Stanford students
are remarkably afraid of any appearance of in
volvement with anyone that might not secure
the highest peer-group approval. Maybe it is
that most students live on campus all four
years and never get away from the scrutiny of
their peers. Maybe it is visions of a glamorous
future that must remain untarnished by any
blemish. Maybe it is simply the pain and
awkwardness of youth. Whatever the case. Bet
hell's fascination with promiscuity belies his
ignorance of Stanford.
Personally. I think there should be a lot more
sex. which is not to say promiscuity. How can
anybody who is not dead to the human condi
tion not see a dearth of love? How can anybody
that does not eat saltpeter for breakfast feel
that physical love is not an essential part of
romantic love?
If some people can find solace in the safety of
abstinence that is a small stiver lining to the
AIDS tragedy. If others can find solace in the

religious devotion of abstinence that is also a
boon to the human condition. Physical and
emotional human love are a great boon as well,
and I can only hope that they prosper.
When it comes to battling AIDS I am for all
out war. I would like to see a massive campaign
advocating both safe sex and standards for
revelation of personal sexual histories.
If that doesn't stop the plague. I would like to
see mandatory yearly AIDS tests for everyone
over 15 and a law that anyone who tests posi
tive can only have safe sex and then only with
people who have signed a letter of informed
consent. Prosecution would follow complaints
by individuals who contracted the disease.
Anyone who was convicted under this law
would have demonstrated his incapacity to ful
fill the social obligations of carrying a deadly
disease and would be sent to a quarantine
community where he could be as dissolute as
he wanted.
These are big guns and would obviously re
quire an amendment to the Constitution, both
to enable the action and to secure protections
against abuse. Let's hope it doesn't come to
that, but if people don't start talking to each
other with total honesty about sexual histories
and practicing safe sex where indicated, some
such measures will be unavoidable.
Would Bethell oppose mandatory AIDS test
ing on the grounds that it would remove the
death threat from sex and hence "promote
promiscuity?" Probably not. The lure of threat
ened civil liberties would be too much entice
ment for a man of the right. But why does it
take something "anti-left" to move the right to
reason?
