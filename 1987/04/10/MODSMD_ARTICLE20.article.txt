Pierre DuPont (Pete to you and me) is coming to
campus today. As everyone knows, the affable former
governor of Delaware was the first person of either
party to declare himself a candidate for president of
the United States. He is cute and wears horn-rimmed
glasses. His name conjures up images of burly
French fur trappers and traders. Will he win? How
about the others Republican hopefuls? Without fur
ther filler, here are my predictions as to who will
capture the Republican nomination for the 1988
elections.

Republican East
1. Jack Kemp, New York
2. Pierre DuPont, Delaware
3. Tom Kean, New Jersey
4. Jeanne Kirkpatrick, Georgetown
5. Al Haig, The Pentagon
6. Pat Robertson, Virginia
Although he has been disappointing in the polls so
far, Kemp will prevail in this division. The New York
congressman, who declared his candidacy on Mon
day, has retained his boyish good looks and is a Hall
of Fame quarterback. His middle name is French,
but he still thinks that France is run by a bunch of
commies. Kemp will attempt to ride the Reagan con
servative roller coaster to victory, and has promised a
new round of red-bashing if he is elected president.
Pete DuPont will be talking on campus today. As
candidates go. Pete is a weird one. DuPont calls him
self a supply-side conservative, yet he supports sanc
tions on South Africa. My friend Andrew Patzman
questioned his stand on toxics, however. A president
named Pierre? It could be time.
Gov. Tom Kean of New Jersey would probably win
this division if he was a serious candidate. However,
he has said he has no intention of running, which
could put a damper on his prospects for victory.
Kean, as his re-election in 1985 demonstrated, can
attract both the black and Democratic votes. He is an
intelligent moderate, but must overcome the belief
that nothing good will ever come from New Jersey.
Look for him to be the vice-presidential candidate.
If Kirkpatrick does not run for president, she will
be a strong contender for the V.P. slot. As a presi
dent, she would bring a certain cantankerous flair to
the Oval Office. As Andrew commented, she is "too
brainy for the pick-up and six-gauge shotgun set,
but she is still a lot better than the rest."
Haig declared his candidacy on March 24. There
are concerns, however, that the former general and
secretary of state will out-talk the electorate with
multisyllable linguistics.
Robertson chances have been hurt by the recent
Gospelgate. According to Andrew. "God's on his side.

That ought to count for something." There are
rumors that God will call Robertson back to heaven if
the TV preacher is not elected.
Republican West
1. Bob Dole, Kansas
2. George Bush, Texas
3. Howard Baker, Tennessee
3. Jim Bakker, North Carolina
4. Paul Laxalt, Nevada
6. George Deukmejian, California
Bob Dole will pull away early and steamroll over the
rest of the division. The Kansas senator is shrewd,
intelligent and witty. He is extremely well-respected
and also knows the Senate inside and out and will be
able to efficiently deal with Congress. However, he
will have to overcome the doubts of whether he is
more or less qualified than his wife, Secretary of
Transportation Elizabeth Dole. Elizabeth Dole is
even more likely to stage an in-house coup than
Nancy Reagan.
George Bush remains the front-runner in the early
polls, but there are strong doubts that the vice presi
dent has the vertebral support to win a national elec
tion. Chris Fialko described Bush as "a wishy-washy
Yalie who can't decide how to tie his shoes."
However, Andrew comments that Bush's "powerful
friends and good table manners might get him the
nomination." Before he can fully devote himself to
the campaign. Bush will first have to figure out his
exact role in the Iran-contra affair and what color tie
to wear to the Republican convention.
Baker will almost certinly not run, which is too
bad. Baker, the new chief of staff for the Reagan ad
ministration, is highly considered and very intelli
gent. Voters, however, like a president who stands
head and shoulders, and not elbows and knees,
above the crowd.
Jim Bakker had it all: money, fame, the chairman
ship of a major corporation and the grace of God.
Now he has nothing. All because of lust. His example
should be a lesson to all those sleazy politicians out
there. His sordid past, however, may play very well in
certain parts of the country.
Paul Laxalt is a close friend of President Reagan.
He is from Nevada, which is right next door to Cali
fornia. He will not win. Nor will he be a V.P. candi
date.
Deukmejian was going to run as a favorite-son
candidate, but now he says he won't even do that.
Most analysts agree that his name is too complex to
lead him to the nomination.
Predictions
Dole will knock out Bush in the early rounds and
then proceed to chew up and spit out the hapless
Kemp. For a running mate, he will chose either
Kirkpatrick, Kean or Baker. Several weeks ago, given
certain contingencies, I predicted that Joe Biden
would win the Democratic nomination, which leaves
a Dole versus Biden finale. Dole will make many jokes
about Biden's lack of hair and go on to victory.
Anyone out there care to bet on all this?

then proceed to chew up and spit out the hapless
Kemp. For a running mate, he will chose either
Kirkpatrick, Kean or Baker. Several weeks ago, given
certain contingencies, I predicted that Joe Biden
would win the Democratic nomination, which leaves
a Dole versus Biden finale. Dole will make many jokes
about Biden's lack of hair and go on to victory.
Anyone out there care to bet on all this?


Editor's notes
Pierre DuPont (Pete to you and me) is coming to
campus today. As everyone knows, the affable former
governor of Delaware was the first person of either
party to declare himself a candidate for president of
the United States. He is cute and wears horn-rimmed
glasses. His name conjures up images of burly
French fur trappers and traders. Will he win? How
about the others Republican hopefuls? Without fur
ther filler, here are my predictions as to who will
capture the Republican nomination for the 1988
elections.

Republican East
1. Jack Kemp, New York
2. Pierre DuPont, Delaware
3. Tom Kean, New Jersey
4. Jeanne Kirkpatrick, Georgetown
5. Al Haig, The Pentagon
6. Pat Robertson, Virginia
Although he has been disappointing in the polls so
far, Kemp will prevail in this division. The New York
congressman, who declared his candidacy on Mon
day, has retained his boyish good looks and is a Hall
of Fame quarterback. His middle name is French,
but he still thinks that France is run by a bunch of
commies. Kemp will attempt to ride the Reagan con
servative roller coaster to victory, and has promised a
new round of red-bashing if he is elected president.
Pete DuPont will be talking on campus today. As
candidates go. Pete is a weird one. DuPont calls him
self a supply-side conservative, yet he supports sanc
tions on South Africa. My friend Andrew Patzman
questioned his stand on toxics, however. A president
named Pierre? It could be time.
Gov. Tom Kean of New Jersey would probably win
this division if he was a serious candidate. However,
he has said he has no intention of running, which
could put a damper on his prospects for victory.
Kean, as his re-election in 1985 demonstrated, can
attract both the black and Democratic votes. He is an
intelligent moderate, but must overcome the belief
that nothing good will ever come from New Jersey.
Look for him to be the vice-presidential candidate.
If Kirkpatrick does not run for president, she will
be a strong contender for the V.P. slot. As a presi
dent, she would bring a certain cantankerous flair to
the Oval Office. As Andrew commented, she is "too
brainy for the pick-up and six-gauge shotgun set,
but she is still a lot better than the rest."
Haig declared his candidacy on March 24. There
are concerns, however, that the former general and
secretary of state will out-talk the electorate with
multisyllable linguistics.
Robertson chances have been hurt by the recent
Gospelgate. According to Andrew. "God's on his side.

That ought to count for something." There are
rumors that God will call Robertson back to heaven if
the TV preacher is not elected.
Republican West
1. Bob Dole, Kansas
2. George Bush, Texas
3. Howard Baker, Tennessee
3. Jim Bakker, North Carolina
4. Paul Laxalt, Nevada
6. George Deukmejian, California
Bob Dole will pull away early and steamroll over the
rest of the division. The Kansas senator is shrewd,
intelligent and witty. He is extremely well-respected
and also knows the Senate inside and out and will be
able to efficiently deal with Congress. However, he
will have to overcome the doubts of whether he is
more or less qualified than his wife, Secretary of
Transportation Elizabeth Dole. Elizabeth Dole is
even more likely to stage an in-house coup than
Nancy Reagan.
George Bush remains the front-runner in the early
polls, but there are strong doubts that the vice presi
dent has the vertebral support to win a national elec
tion. Chris Fialko described Bush as "a wishy-washy
Yalie who can't decide how to tie his shoes."
However, Andrew comments that Bush's "powerful
friends and good table manners might get him the
nomination." Before he can fully devote himself to
the campaign. Bush will first have to figure out his
exact role in the Iran-contra affair and what color tie
to wear to the Republican convention.
Baker will almost certinly not run, which is too
bad. Baker, the new chief of staff for the Reagan ad
ministration, is highly considered and very intelli
gent. Voters, however, like a president who stands
head and shoulders, and not elbows and knees,
above the crowd.
Jim Bakker had it all: money, fame, the chairman
ship of a major corporation and the grace of God.
Now he has nothing. All because of lust. His example
should be a lesson to all those sleazy politicians out
there. His sordid past, however, may play very well in
certain parts of the country.
Paul Laxalt is a close friend of President Reagan.
He is from Nevada, which is right next door to Cali
fornia. He will not win. Nor will he be a V.P. candi
date.
Deukmejian was going to run as a favorite-son
candidate, but now he says he won't even do that.
Most analysts agree that his name is too complex to
lead him to the nomination.
Predictions
Dole will knock out Bush in the early rounds and
then proceed to chew up and spit out the hapless
Kemp. For a running mate, he will chose either
Kirkpatrick, Kean or Baker. Several weeks ago, given
certain contingencies, I predicted that Joe Biden
would win the Democratic nomination, which leaves
