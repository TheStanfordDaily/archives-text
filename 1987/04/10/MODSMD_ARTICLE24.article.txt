## Cultural series will laud workers 
### STEVE CHOUGH 
Cultural and racial strife: an
issue that has always existed, one
that still plagues us today. The
problems are numerous, the solu
tions few.
Stanford, for many years, has
prided Itself as being one of the
nation's most culturally diverse
universities. During the months
of April and May. a series of pro
grams titled the "Multicultural
Days of Celebration" will honor
the diversity and contributions of
Stanford's workers and staff mem
bers.
"A lot of times students and fac
ulty forget the University is run
and maintained by the workers
and staff," said Okada Resident
Assistant Shirley Wang, who has
been helping to organize the se
ries. "These workers and staff are
of many different ethnicities . . .
and face discrimination based on
race, gender or sexual orientation
more acutely than other groups
because of their disadvantageous
class position."
"Showing appreciation to the
workers helps us be more con
siderate and sensitive to the is
sues of labor and its relationship
to the University, " she added.
"The program helps foster good re
lations with the workers and is
just one step in making us more
conscious of what they do."
Tomorrow marks the beginning
of the series, which will include
six different programs running on
successive Saturdays. All are de
signed for the dual purpose of fac
ulty appreciation and cultural
awareness.
The "Multicultural Days of
Celebration" includes events
focusing on four of Stanford's
major ethnic groups â€” the native
American, Asian, black and
Latino cultures, as well as a night
for what series organizer and
Council of Presidents member
Rudy Fuentes called a "main
stream" group.
Planning for the series began in

October. While returning students
were busy readjusting themselves
and freshmen were lost in the
chaos of fall quarter, a small ASSU
committee under the direction of
Fuentes began brainstorming to
develop a program Intended to im
prove student-worker relations in
the Stanford community. The
committee decided that a series of
different "days of appreciation"
would be the most effective way to
show the workers of Stanford that
they are indeed appreciated.
When selecting the theme of the
program, the committee consid
ered the urgency of the problem of
cultural misunderstanding. The
"Multicultural Days," it was
decided, would provide a program
that was important and educa
tional, and at the same time inter
esting and entertaining.
The program aims at transmit
ting a cultural awareness that will
bridge misunderstandings not
only between workers and stu
dents but between students them
selves, according to Fuentes. "To
understand a person, you must
first understand his culture. Cul
ture is an important aspect of
each individual community," he
said.
"There is not one single cause
for the lack of understanding
among different cultures," accord
ing to Fuentes. but he attributed
much of the problem to a lack of
exposure.
"Most people, for all their lives,
have been exposed to just one cul
ture. People need to open up to
other cultures, learn about the
problems, concerns and suc
cesses" of people from different
cultural backgrounds, Fuentes
said.
Besides the Council of Presi
dents and the ASSU committee,
which has been primarily respon
sible for raising the >12,000
budget the program requires, dif
ferent theme houses, cultural
groups and other campus organi
zations have become actively in
volved in planning the series.

Members of each of the ethnic
groups represented in the celebra
tion were asked to choose a film
and present a program they felt
would best reflect their culture.
Fuentes said this format allowed
people to "present their culture to
Stanford the way they wanted it to
be perceived." Fuentes explained
that the image an ethnic group
wishes to promote is often differ
ent than the Image "imposed" on
the culture by outsiders.
Wang described the program
not as "academic or intellectual"
but as a celebration that will allow
people to "feel and experience dif
ferent cultures. The events are
snapshots or windows into differ
ent cultures."
The celebration begins tomor
row with Black Culture Night. The
program will Include the reading
of poetry by Black Student Union
President Amanda Kemp, and per
formances by student dance
groups and the Stanford Gospel
Choir, as well as the screening of
the film "A Soldier's Story."
Asian Night is scheduled for the
following Saturday, April 18. The
agenda for the evening includes a
jazz duet (featuring library staff
member Francis Wong), the movie
"The Great Wall" and a perfor
mance by student martial arts
groups.
American Indian Culture Night,
to be held April 25, will feature an
Indian storyteller from Wyoming,

an event that promises to be one
of the highlights of the entire
celebration. Also planned for the
evening is the showing of the film
"Three Warriors."
In celebration of Mexican Inde
pendence Day, Cinco de Mayo, the
Latino Cultural Day will be held on
Saturday, May 2. From 9 a.m. to 5
p.m., a carnival will be held In
White Plaza. The evening agenda
includes the showing of "La Ley
del Monte" as well as perfor
mances by a marlachi group and

The event for May 9 is Family
Night. The evening's planners
hope to focus on the "main
stream" aspects of the Stanford
community. Rob Reiner's 1986
summer smash "Stand By Me" will
be shown in Dinkelspiel at 7 p.m.
Groups including the Mendicants,
Counterpoint and Mixed Com
pany are currently scheduled to

fashion. Acts will be drawn from
events such as Stanfunk and the
Faculty Talent Night; staff and
Bay Area comedians are also
