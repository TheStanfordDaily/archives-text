# African adventurer gives travel hints
## 
### DAVID LIPPEATT Editorial staff 
Africa — the dark continent.
It's a place where thundering
herds of wildebeest cover the
plains, where the lion's roar
sends shivers down the spines
of weary travelers, where native
peoples live simple but cul
turally rich lives In much the
same way they have for cen
turies. Or at least so goes the
stereotype.
Well, one man has found all
of this and more. Freelance
writer and photographer Stel
fen Landauer, who spoke at the
Bechtel International Center
Tuesday night, recounted tales
of wonder and adventure as he
described his 16-month solo
odyssey in search of the real
Africa.
Behind the stereotypes and
the negative image of the con
tinent Americans receive from
the press (focusing on wars and
famines, for example). Lan
dauer found an Africa of
friendly, hospitable people and
extraordinary natural beauty.
"I was apprehensive at first,
traveling in Africa by myself,"
he recalled. "But people are in
credibly nice and hospitable. I
hardly ever felt threatened."
"I would say that It's safer to
travel in Africa than to walk the
streets of San Francisco," Lan
dauer said.
"People would often offer me
a free room for a night," Lan
dauer said.
Even without the hospitality,
"food, transportation, rooms —
all are a lot cheaper in Africa
than in western countries," he
said.
During his trip, Landauer
spent time in Kenya, Tanzania,
Uganda. Rwanda, Somalia,
South Africa and Zaire, among
other countries. Everywhere he
went he was struck by the atti
tudes of the people he met.

"It amazed me that in the
midst of terrible material con
ditions. (these) people had a
real joy of life." he said. "There
is a rhythm In Africa that you
get into — people have a differ
ent sense of time there.
Among the highlights of Lan
dauer's trip were: visiting the
island of Zanzibar, once the
capital of an Arab empire, off
the coast of Kenya; standing
face to face with rare, shy
mountain gorillas In the Rwan
dan rain forests; cruising by
cargo boat up the Congo River;
climbing the mountains of the
moon in Zaire; and seeing
firsthand the enormous con
trast between the wealthy
whites and the impoverished
blacks in South Africa.
Landauer emphasized the
fact that anybody, especially
students, can travel safely and
cheaply in Africa. "You don't
need much," he said. "Just a
backpack, some good walking
shoes, a few simple medicines
— anything else you want you
can get there."
"People shouldn't be afraid of
going to Africa by themselves,"
he added. "It's really easy to
meet other travelers and team
up with them for a while."
In fact, "other travelers are
your best source of current in
formation" about what to do
and where to go on the contin
ent, he added.
Women can and do travel in
Africa alone or in small groups,
he said, but he advised them to
avoid more strict Arab
countries.
Landauer, who also spent
nine months traveling through
Asia, is offering two three-hour
seminars on traveling alone
through Africa and Asia at the
I-Center. The Asian seminar
will be held Sunday, at 1 p.m.
The African seminar will be
Sunday, April 19, also at 1 p.m.
The cost of the seminars is *25.
