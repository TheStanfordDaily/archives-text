## Stanford battles UCLA for Six-Pac lead 
### TOM SENF Senior staff writer 
It's showdown time at Sunken
Diamond this weekend, as the top
guns on the West Coast. Stanford
and UCLA, battle for first place In
the Pacific 10 Southern Division
in a three-game shootout begin
ning today at 2:30 p.m.
Although Pepperdine may have
a claim to the Best in the West tag,
there is no denying that Stanford
and UCLA are the top two teams in
the West's top conference. The
Cardinal is ranked fifth and the
Bruins eighth by ESPN/Collegiate
Baseball, but Baseball America
has UCLA ahead of Stanford at
Nos. 6 and 7.
The only rankings that matter,
however, are the Six-Pac stand
ings, and the Cardinal is currently
percentage points ahead with a
10-3 record to the Bruins' 11-4.
"A win is a win in league." Stan
ford Coach Mark Marquess said,
downplaying the Importance of
the series. "If we win two out of
three this weekend and then get
swept, that's no good. But with
the top two teams in the league. It
is special. It gives us a little more
Incentive. And it's the last time we
play them."
Most of the Stanford pitching
staff would just as soon forget the
last time the teams met. The
Bruins pounded the Cardinal for
31 runs in two games before Stan
ford came back to win the third
game in a Feb. 27-Mar. 1 series in
Los Angeles.
"For us to be successful, we
have to pitch well," Marquess
said. "We don't want to get in a
slugfest with them."
And with good reason. Taking
on the Bruins in a slugging con
test is like taking on a skunk in a
. . . well, you know what kind of
contest. UCLA leads the Six-Pac
with 68 homers, including 61
from its starting lineup.
First baseman Eric Karros is
hitting .329 with five homers —
and is now on the bench. Fresh
man Bob Hamelin mans that spot
for the Bruins and is hitting .380
with six homers and 21 RBIs in
just 71 at-bats.

Some other members of UCLA
Murderer's Row are: catcher Billy
Haselman (.333, six homers, 36
RBIs), center fielder Charlie
Fiacco (.323, 5. 25), designated
hitter Steve Stowell (.309, 5. 21).
right fielder Jeff Osborn (.293, 7,
24), left fielder Steve Hisey (.291,
9. 44) and third baseman Scott
Cline (.267, 7, 18).
But the main man in the UCLA
attack is second baseman Torey
Lovullo, last year's Six-Pac Co-
Player of the Year. Lovullo cur
rently leads the Six-Pac with 15
homers. Is second in hitting with
a .389 average and is third in RBIs
with 42. He tagged the Cardinal
for three roundtrippers in their
earlier series.
"You can't just pitch around
him (because of the other Bruins),
but he's a great offensive player
and we have a lot of respect for
him." Marquess said. "If it's on
the line, I'm not going to let him
beat me. We hope we can contain
him. We know we won't shut him
down, but we hope we can limit
the damage he can inflict. We just
hope we can get him out when we
need to, but if we can pitch
around him we will."
The key for the Cardinal staff
will be to get ahead of the hitters.
"Anytime you play a power-hitting
team, you have to pitch ahead,"
Marquess said. "When you're
pitching from behind, they can sit
on the fastball, and that's a real
advantage for them."
Although he would prefer lower
scoring games and is confident of
his Six-Pac-leading pitching
staff's (3.64 ERA) ability to
produce them, Marquess also
believes the Cardinal has a chance
even if the scoreboard approaches
double digits.
"Normally, with that type of
team (UCLA), you have to pitch
well, not outslug them," he said.
"But once in a while you have to
win a 10-8, 9-8 game, and we're
capable of doing that."
The Cardinal racked up 27 runs
against the Bruins in Los Angeles
and may be called on to produce
similar numbers this weekend.
Ruben Amaro has been the quin
tessential leadoff man for Stan

ford, leading the team in hitting
(.350), runs scored (43), walks
(29) and stolen bases (21).
Amaro has usually been driven
in by either Toi Cook (.304, 4 HRs.
29 RBIs). Ed Sprague (.342. 9. 38)
or Paul Carey (.320, 8, 28).
Today's game matches two
junior right-handed pitchers who
usually have the radar guns hum
ming and the pro scouts drooling
in UCLA's Alex Sanchez and Stan
ford's Jack McDowell.
Sanchez, the Six-Pac's other Co-
MVP last year, is 4-3 with a 4.45

ERA and leads the conference
with 67 strikeouts, while
McDowell (5-1. 4.08) has fanned
26 in his last two outings. Both
are expected to be among the top
10 picks in this year's draft.
Marquess wouldn't give either
pitcher an edge, but he did predict
there would be a lot of heat on the
mound today — and he wasn t
talking about the weather.
"When you have two good
pitchers, it's a toss-up," he said.
"But there'll be a lot of good
fastballs popping out there." Both

pitchers can bring it at about 90
mph, with McDowell's fastball
probably a little higher than
Sanchez's.
Another advantage the Cardinal
fireballer may have is control.
While Sanchez has walked 55 in
his 62.2 innings. McDowell has
issued just 23 free passes in 46.1
innings.
"I hope it continues and we get
six or seven, but he (Sanchez)
usually rises to the occasion and
can shut you down anyway,"
Marquess said.

Sanchez did not rise to the occa
sion against Stanford on Feb. 27.
when his walks were a main factor
in his departure during an eight
run Cardinal rally.
After a one-week absence. Lee
Plemel (5-4, 3.39 ERA) returns to
the Stanford rotation tomorrow
and will face the Bruins' Randy
Hennis (6-1, 5.54). On Sunday,
Jim Price (3-0, 4.05) will be on the
mound for the Cardinal against
Stowell (8-2. 3.76).

David Esquer (8) and his Stanford teammates hope to keep from sliding into second place this weekend at Sunken Diamond.
Should the Stanford starters
take a lead into the late innings, it
is likely they will be safe in the
hands of Cardinal stopper Steve
Chitren. Since moving to the bull
pen three weeks ago. Chitren has
been entrusted with the lead
seven times and has recorded a
save each time, giving him eight
for the season.
Many pitchers cannot handle
the tension of late-inning relief,
but Chitren has an interesting
philosophy that solves this prob
lem. "I throw more fastballs and
challenge the hitter," he said.
"When I come in, it's usually in a
situation when the hitter has to
come through, so that puts the
pressure on him."
While recognizing the Bruins'
power, USC Coach Mike Gillespie
envisions a successful weekend
for the Cardinal. "I really like the
way Stanford plays," he said last
weekend. "Stanford is not going to
beat themselves. I have to think
they're in the driver's seat. They
get them at home, they have less
losses already, and I like their
pitching. It will be a good series. I
wish I could see it."
KZSU Radio (90.1 FM) will
broadcast all three of this
weekend's games, with the profes
sional Robert Portnoy and steady

microphone. Game time both to

"But there'll be a lot of good
fastballs popping out there." Both

pitchers can bring it at about 90
mph, with McDowell's fastball
probably a little higher than
Sanchez's.
Another advantage the Cardinal
fireballer may have is control.
While Sanchez has walked 55 in
his 62.2 innings. McDowell has
issued just 23 free passes in 46.1
innings.
"I hope it continues and we get
six or seven, but he (Sanchez)
usually rises to the occasion and
can shut you down anyway,"
Marquess said.

Sanchez did not rise to the occa
sion against Stanford on Feb. 27.
when his walks were a main factor
in his departure during an eight
run Cardinal rally.
After a one-week absence. Lee
Plemel (5-4, 3.39 ERA) returns to
the Stanford rotation tomorrow
and will face the Bruins' Randy
Hennis (6-1, 5.54). On Sunday,
Jim Price (3-0, 4.05) will be on the
mound for the Cardinal against
Stowell (8-2. 3.76).

Should the Stanford starters
take a lead into the late innings, it
is likely they will be safe in the
hands of Cardinal stopper Steve
Chitren. Since moving to the bull
pen three weeks ago. Chitren has
been entrusted with the lead
seven times and has recorded a

for the season.
Many pitchers cannot handle
the tension of late-inning relief,
but Chitren has an interesting
philosophy that solves this prob
lem. "I throw more fastballs and
challenge the hitter," he said.
"When I come in, it's usually in a
situation when the hitter has to
come through, so that puts the
pressure on him."
While recognizing the Bruins'
power, USC Coach Mike Gillespie
envisions a successful weekend
for the Cardinal. "I really like the
way Stanford plays," he said last
weekend. "Stanford is not going to
beat themselves. I have to think
they're in the driver's seat. They
get them at home, they have less
losses already, and I like their
pitching. It will be a good series. I
wish I could see it."
KZSU Radio (90.1 FM) will
broadcast all three of this
weekend's games, with the profes
sional Robert Portnoy and steady

morrow and Sunday is at 1 p.m.
It's showdown time at Sunken
Diamond this weekend, as the top
guns on the West Coast. Stanford
and UCLA, battle for first place In
the Pacific 10 Southern Division
in a three-game shootout begin
ning today at 2:30 p.m.
Although Pepperdine may have
a claim to the Best in the West tag,
there is no denying that Stanford
and UCLA are the top two teams in
the West's top conference. The
Cardinal is ranked fifth and the
Bruins eighth by ESPN/Collegiate
Baseball, but Baseball America
has UCLA ahead of Stanford at
Nos. 6 and 7.
The only rankings that matter,
however, are the Six-Pac stand
ings, and the Cardinal is currently
percentage points ahead with a
10-3 record to the Bruins' 11-4.
"A win is a win in league." Stan
ford Coach Mark Marquess said,
downplaying the Importance of
the series. "If we win two out of
three this weekend and then get
swept, that's no good. But with
the top two teams in the league. It
is special. It gives us a little more
Incentive. And it's the last time we
play them."
Most of the Stanford pitching
staff would just as soon forget the
last time the teams met. The
Bruins pounded the Cardinal for
31 runs in two games before Stan
ford came back to win the third
game in a Feb. 27-Mar. 1 series in
Los Angeles.
"For us to be successful, we
have to pitch well," Marquess
said. "We don't want to get in a
slugfest with them."
And with good reason. Taking
on the Bruins in a slugging con
test is like taking on a skunk in a
. . . well, you know what kind of
contest. UCLA leads the Six-Pac
with 68 homers, including 61
from its starting lineup.
First baseman Eric Karros is
hitting .329 with five homers —
and is now on the bench. Fresh
man Bob Hamelin mans that spot
for the Bruins and is hitting .380
with six homers and 21 RBIs in
just 71 at-bats.

Some other members of UCLA
Murderer's Row are: catcher Billy
Haselman (.333, six homers, 36
RBIs), center fielder Charlie
Fiacco (.323, 5. 25), designated
hitter Steve Stowell (.309, 5. 21).
right fielder Jeff Osborn (.293, 7,
24), left fielder Steve Hisey (.291,
9. 44) and third baseman Scott
Cline (.267, 7, 18).
But the main man in the UCLA
attack is second baseman Torey
Lovullo, last year's Six-Pac Co-
Player of the Year. Lovullo cur
rently leads the Six-Pac with 15
homers. Is second in hitting with
a .389 average and is third in RBIs
with 42. He tagged the Cardinal
for three roundtrippers in their
earlier series.
"You can't just pitch around
him (because of the other Bruins),
but he's a great offensive player
and we have a lot of respect for
him." Marquess said. "If it's on
the line, I'm not going to let him
beat me. We hope we can contain
him. We know we won't shut him
down, but we hope we can limit
the damage he can inflict. We just
hope we can get him out when we
need to, but if we can pitch
around him we will."
The key for the Cardinal staff
will be to get ahead of the hitters.
"Anytime you play a power-hitting
team, you have to pitch ahead,"
Marquess said. "When you're
pitching from behind, they can sit
on the fastball, and that's a real
advantage for them."
Although he would prefer lower
scoring games and is confident of
his Six-Pac-leading pitching
staff's (3.64 ERA) ability to
produce them, Marquess also
believes the Cardinal has a chance
even if the scoreboard approaches
double digits.
"Normally, with that type of
team (UCLA), you have to pitch
well, not outslug them," he said.
"But once in a while you have to
win a 10-8, 9-8 game, and we're
capable of doing that."
The Cardinal racked up 27 runs
against the Bruins in Los Angeles
and may be called on to produce
similar numbers this weekend.
Ruben Amaro has been the quin
tessential leadoff man for Stan

ford, leading the team in hitting
(.350), runs scored (43), walks
(29) and stolen bases (21).
Amaro has usually been driven
in by either Toi Cook (.304, 4 HRs.
29 RBIs). Ed Sprague (.342. 9. 38)
or Paul Carey (.320, 8, 28).
Today's game matches two
junior right-handed pitchers who
usually have the radar guns hum
ming and the pro scouts drooling
in UCLA's Alex Sanchez and Stan
ford's Jack McDowell.
Sanchez, the Six-Pac's other Co-
MVP last year, is 4-3 with a 4.45

ERA and leads the conference
with 67 strikeouts, while
McDowell (5-1. 4.08) has fanned
26 in his last two outings. Both
are expected to be among the top
10 picks in this year's draft.
Marquess wouldn't give either
pitcher an edge, but he did predict
there would be a lot of heat on the
mound today — and he wasn t
talking about the weather.
"When you have two good
pitchers, it's a toss-up," he said.
"But there'll be a lot of good
