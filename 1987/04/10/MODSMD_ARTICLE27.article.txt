### EVAN TUCHINSKY Staff writer 
If you are a fan of women's gymnastics, hop the
next plane to Seattle and make your way to the
University of Washington.
It is on the Huskies' home turf that the NCAA
West Regional will be held tomorrow night, and
18th-ranked Stanford will be joining some of the
strongest squads in the nation in the hope of
qualifying for the national finals April 24-25 In
Utah.
The Cardinal enters the competition seeded
fourth, behind UCLA. Washington and Oregon
State. Fullerton State, which was seeded fourth
until Stanford's performance last weekend in Al
buquerque. N.M., is now fifth.
"Right now, this is the best we've ever been
seeded." Stanford co-captain Alison McGann said.

"We are ahead of Cal State-Fullerton, who [is]
traditionally strong."
Making the finals will be a tough task for Stan
ford. but not an impossible one. This year, the
number of teams competing In the championship
meet has been increased from 10 to 12.
The champions from each of the five regions
receive automatic berths at the NCAAs. leaving
seven at-large spots. These typically go to the
second-place teams, which keeps at least two
places open for lower regional finishers.
What this means is that, should Stanford finish
in the top three in the region, the Cardinal would
have a chance to qualify for the finals; the higher
the finish, the greater the possibility of going.
"We would at least need to beat Oregon State,
and we would like to beat Washington." McGann

said. The junior noted that as the
host team, the Huskies would
have an advantage and be tough
to upset.
"We need a good meet to do
this." she added.
However, despite the obstacles,
McGann is optimistic. "Everybody
looks really good in the gym right
now; everybody's peaking," she
said. "We are all really psyched to
have a good meet."

'Everybody looks
really good in the
gym right now. . . .

Recent improvement on the un
even parallel bars will further
benefit the Cardinal. "As a team,
bars has been looking pretty
strong. It's been the downfall of
the season (until recently),"
McGann said.
Also on Stanford's side Is the
team's arsenal of talent. Fresh
man Dina Amoroso has been at
the forefront of the Cardinal offen
sive, joined by strong all
arounders McGann, sophomore

Co-captain Cheryl Doo and senior
Nanci Goldsmith.
Amoroso enters the competition
with a regional-qualifying score
around 37, and a good perfor
mance this weekend would give
her a chance to qualify for the
finals individually even if the team
does not advance.
The team is further fortified by
the return of sophomore Sherl
Evenson, who Injured her knee in
the third meet of the season at
California. Regionals will mark
her third meet since then.
"Sherl's looking pretty good and
coming back to health," McGann
said. "We can really use her."
In light of the recent injury to
sophomore Jinny Rhee, Evenson's
return has been accentuated.
Rhee. the fifth all-arounder for
Stanford this season, suffered a
metatarsal stress fracture while
jogging, restricting her to just
competing on bars.
Also conspicuously absent from
the lineup at the regional will be
Jessica Armstrong, who was a bal
ance beam and floor exercise spe
cialist before seriously injuring
her knee March 8 against Wash
ington State. The sophomore will
be out of competition for an un
known length of time, and will be
missed this weekend.
Rounding out the Cardinal's
competitve force are freshmen Be
cky Ashton and Susan Banta, plus
senior Cindy Boyd.
