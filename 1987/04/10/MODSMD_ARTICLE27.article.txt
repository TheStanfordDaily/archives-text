If you are a fan of women's gymnastics, hop the
next plane to Seattle and make your way to the
University of Washington.
It is on the Huskies' home turf that the NCAA
West Regional will be held tomorrow night, and
18th-ranked Stanford will be joining some of the
strongest squads in the nation in the hope of
qualifying for the national finals April 24-25 In
Utah.
The Cardinal enters the competition seeded
fourth, behind UCLA. Washington and Oregon
State. Fullerton State, which was seeded fourth
until Stanford's performance last weekend in Al
buquerque. N.M., is now fifth.
"Right now, this is the best we've ever been
seeded." Stanford co-captain Alison McGann said.

"We are ahead of Cal State-Fullerton, who [is]
traditionally strong."
Making the finals will be a tough task for Stan
ford. but not an impossible one. This year, the
number of teams competing In the championship
meet has been increased from 10 to 12.
The champions from each of the five regions
receive automatic berths at the NCAAs. leaving
seven at-large spots. These typically go to the
second-place teams, which keeps at least two
places open for lower regional finishers.
What this means is that, should Stanford finish
in the top three in the region, the Cardinal would
have a chance to qualify for the finals; the higher
the finish, the greater the possibility of going.
"We would at least need to beat Oregon State,
and we would like to beat Washington." McGann
