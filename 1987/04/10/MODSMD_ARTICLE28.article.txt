# Stanford Stadium to host track standouts tomorrow
## 
### ERIK STEN Editorial staff 
World-class track comes to the
Farm this weekend.
Tomorrow at Stanford Stadium,
four of the nation's top collegiate
teams will join the Cardinal and a
handful of unattached Olympians
to take part in the Stanford Track
Classic, an unscored event that
promises some of the best track
and field this side of the Olympics.
"We've got former Olympians
and aspiring Olympians." Coach
Brooks Johnson said. "When
those two come together, the
sparks fly."
At the top of the list is Jackie
Joyner, the 1986 Sullivan Award
winner and world-record holder in
the heptathlon. Tomorrow, the
versatile Joyner will compete in
two of her many events. An almost
unbeatable competitor in the hep
tathlon. Joyner is heralded as the
world's top track and field athlete
performing today.
Also competing will be one of
Joyner's closest competitors for
that title. Valerie Brisco-Hooks, a
gold medal winner in the 200, 400
and 1600 meter relay at the 1984
Olympics, will be entered in the
sprints.
For the men, the top draw is
Andre Phillips, who last year was
ranked first in the world in the
400 hurdles with a time of 47.31
and fourth in the open 400 with a
44.71 clocking.
Tomorrow, Phillips is expected
to enter the open 400 as well as
the 200. The Olympian will run
into a challenge from San Diego
State's Rex Brown and Notre
Dame's Tim Brown. Though the
two are not related, they do have
one thing in common — excep
tional speed. Another surprise fac
tor in the 200 could be Cardinal
freshman Gus Envela, who has a
lifetime best of 10.25 in the 100.
SDSU, Notre Dame and Stan
ford will be joined by UCLA. Wash
ington and Lousiana State to com
plete an exceptional field. After
winning this year's national in
door team championship, the LSU
women are currently regarded as
the best team in the country, and
the LSU men are not far behind.
For the spectators, the meet
should be extraordinary. For the
Cardinal athletes. Johnson hopes
it will be an ideal chance to qualify
for the NCAA championships in
June. Because of Its extremely
tough qualifying standards, the
NCAA meet often goes to the team

that brings the most athletes.
Consequently, Johnson Is hoping
to get a jump on the field.
"We need meets like this," he
said. "With everyone coming and
no points being scored, we don't
have to worry about doubling and
tripling people up to win the meet.
"Everyone can just concentrate
on fast times and qualifying."
Johnson added.
Athletes to watch for the Card
inal will be Charles Alexander in
the 5.000. Christian Skoog in the
800. Erica Wheeler in the Javelin
and the men's 4 x 100 relay. With
the exception of Wheeler, all have

been close to qualifying this year
and with good competition could
do so tomorrow. Wheeler, one of
the nation's top throwers, is just
now returning from an Injury. The
sophomore also has the potential
to qualify.
Another key event will be the
women's high jump, in which the
Cardinal's Lisa Bernhagen, the
NCAA indoor record-holder in the
event, will match Jumps with
LSU's Kim Carter, this year's
third-place finisher indoors. Also
jumping will be the Huskies' Vicky
Borshelm, another talented
jumper with a best of 6-foot-2.
