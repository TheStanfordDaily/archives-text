# Spikers host powerful UCLA, USC

### ALICIA KENT Staff writer 
The pressure is on for the Stanford men's
volleyball team as it fights for a spot in the Dis
trict 8 Reglonals. Tonight, the Cardinal faces
No. 1 UCLA at 7. and tomorrow No. 3 USC
visits Maples Pavilion at 7:30 p.m.
Stanford is 8-6 in the Western Intercollegiate
Volleyball Association, putting it fifth in the
conference. UCLA is undefeated against WIVA
teams, with a 15-0 conference record and 33-3
overall record. Following close behind the
Bruins, the Trojans are 12-3 in the WIVA and
23-9 overall.
After last weekend's double win for the Card
inal, Stanford Coach Fred Sturm thought the
team had an automatic berth to the reglonals
April 23-25 in San Diego. However, Sturm dis
covered that Stanford needs one more win to
ensure a spot in the reglonals.
Entry Into the reglonals is the first step
toward becoming one of the teams at the NCAA
finals, which will be played May 1-2. The win
ners from each of the three regions in the
country gain automatic berths to the NCAAs,
while the fourth spot Is determined by a com
mittee. The winner of each of the West, East
and Midwest regions gains the nomination.
In the past it has been the West's nomina
tion that has filled the No. 4 spot at the NCAAs.
If Stanford can win a spot in the reglonals and
then go on to win, it would most likely be the
fourth team in the NCAAs.
In contention for the regional spot is Hawaii,
which is No. 6 In the WIVA. Hawaii, 6-10 in the

conference, has two more matches to play
before the end of the season. If Hawaii can win
both and the Cardinal loses its final four
matches, both teams would tie for the No. 5
WIVA position, with an 8-10 record.
Traditionally, the second through fifth
teams in the WIVA have been the contenders in
the Western Reglonals. This puts Stanford's
No. 5 ranking as the hot spot. If Hawaii and
Stanford were to tie, they would face each
other in a playoff match to decide the fifth
place team.

'We'd like to clinch
that playoff spot as
soon as possible.'

Tonight's match will definitely be a tough
one, as both the Bruins and the Cardinal have
much resting on it. If UCLA wins, it will clinch
the conference title and establish its place in
the NCAAs. However. Stanford has plenty of in
centive also.
"We'd like to clinch that playoff spot as soon
as possible." Stanford Asst. Coach Ruben
Nieves said. "We feel pretty confident we could
win at least one, hopefully two or three of our
matches."
Stanford lost at UCLA twice this season, first
on Feb. 6 at the UCLA/Reebok Collegiate Vol

leyball Classic, 15-8, 15-11, 15-4. and again on
Feb. 18, 15-7, 15-8, 15-7. in a frustrating 65-
minute conference match.
Stanford also lost in its two confrontations
against USC, first at the UCSB/Michelob Light
Collegiate Invitational on Jan. 23, and again
on Feb. 21 at USC, 15-10, 15-6, 15-7.
Calling on Its depth of players, the Cardinal
will try to confuse its opponents with different
blocking options and substitution of players.
Depending on where UCLA and USC prove to
be strong, Stanford is working on its ability to
block different parts of the net.
In addition, the Cardinal can bring in setter
Steve Modory and hitter Robert Peterson to
confuse the other teams.
According to Nieves, in the past the team has
placed too much emphasis on its opponent's
play. This weekend, he hopes that the team
can put past losses behind it and concentrate
on its own strengths. "We need to do the
things we do well," Nieves said.
