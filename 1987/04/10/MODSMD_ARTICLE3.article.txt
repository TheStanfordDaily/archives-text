# Class of 1991
## Minority admits rise this year 
### MARCUS MABRY Senior staff writer 
The Office of Undergraduate Ad
missions announced yesterday an
increase in the number of
minorities and women admitted
to the freshman class.
Women constitute 45 percent of
those admitted to the Class of
1991. Blacks make up 9.4 percent
(up from 7.7 percent last year),
Mexican-Americans 7.9 percent
(up from 7.3 percent), American
Indians 0.9 percent (up from 0.6
percent), and Asian-Americans
17.1 percent (up from 15.4 per
cent)
The Office of Admissions has ac
cepted 2,474 students, 15 percent
of the 16,883 applicants, the
second-largest applicant pool in
Stanford history.
Almost 200 students were also
selected to be David Starr Jordan
Scholars at Stanford. This honor
formally recognizes for the first
time "those students who met,
with highest distinction, the
criteria for admission to Stanford:
academic excellence, evidence of
achievement outside the class
room and personal qualities befit
ting the University," according to
an Admissions Office press
release.
Dean of Admissions Jean Fetter
said the Admissions Office made a
renewed effort this year to bring

more minorities to Stanford,
sending all minority applicants a
letter from the dean and a special
newspaper depicting opportuni
ties and life here for minorities.
The Jordan Scholars program,
named after the University's first
president, was established as a
result of a new policy set by the
Committee on Undergraduate Ad
missions and Financial Aids, a
student and faculty committee.
Fetter said.
The scholarships are honorary
distinctions and there are no fin
ancial awards attached to them.
Excluding athletic scholarships,
financial aid at Stanford is based
solely on demonstrated need, the
difference between the total cost of
attending the University and the
amount a student can afford to
pay.
Fetter said there are currently
no programs established for Jor
dan Scholars who decide to attend
Stanford, but that the Dean of Un
dergraduate Studies will be creat
ing programs specially for
recipients.
Admission to Stanford contin
ues to be very competitive, with
over 3,080 applicants possessing
4.0 grade-point averages. More
than 1,850 scored 700 or better
on the verbal SAT, and over 6,070
applicants scored 700 or better on
the math SAT. Sixteen percent, or
2,679, of the applicants also had
combined SAT scores above
1,400.
Offers of admission were sent to
students representing every state

and 30 foreign countries. Califor
nia claimed the highest number of
members to the admitted class,
31.8 percent, followed by New
York (7.5 percent), Texas (4.8 per
cent) and Illinois (4.5 percent).
Four percent of the admitted stu
dents are foreign, approximately
the same number as last year.
Fetter added, "We are very
pleased with the whole class."
