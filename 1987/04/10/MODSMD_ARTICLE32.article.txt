# Revenge on the minds of Stanford women's netters
## Cardinal to play Wildcats without services of Hagey 
### KEN STEVENS Senior staff writer 
With three losses so far In the
1987 season, the Stanford
women's tennis team has three
schools on Its payback list as It
heads Into the second half of the
Pacific 10 Conference season.
Arizona, the first team to beat
the Cardinal this season, will
come to the Stanford Tennis
Stadium Sunday for a noon
match. The Wildcats upset then-
No. 1-ranked Stanford Feb. 21 In
Tucson by a 5-4 score.
Following the victory over the
Cardinal. Arizona upset USC,
which was ranked No. 2 at the
time. "I think the fact that they
beat USC after they beat us, it got
our attention," Stanford Coach
Frank Brennan.
The wins against the Cardinal
and Trojans are the Wildcats' only
conference victories to date,
however. Arizona has struggled
recently, dropping to 12-9 overall
and 2-5 in the Pac-10. "I think
they were at the high point of their
season (when they beat Stan
ford)," Brennan said.
Nevertheless, the Wildcats have
a history of playing the Cardinal
and other highly ranked schools
very closely. "They obviously play
well against good schools," Bren
nan added.
Stanford, 13-3 overall and 2-3 in
the Pac-10, seems to be competing
against good schools every
weekend. The Cardinal is coming
off of a thrilling 6-3 victory against
USC and a heartbreaking 5-4 loss

against undefeated UCLA last
weekend.
The match against UCLA wasn't
the Cardinal's only loss of the
weekend. Junior Cari Hagey
twisted her left knee in the first
set of her singles match last Sat
urday against USC and will not be
in action this weekend.
Hagey was examined Wednes
day for possible cartilage damage,
and the test results were negative,
but the date of her return to the
Cardinal lineup is uncertain.
"Carl Hagey's going to be out for
the weekend at least, maybe next
weekend," Brennan said.
The vacancy in the lineup that
Hagey's injury creates may be
filled by senior Leigh Anne
Eldredge, whose court time has
been limited to doubles action
since her return from a stress
fracture Injury. "Now without Cari
healthy, I think we're really shor
thanded without Leigh Anne in
there," Brennan said.
However, Brennan had said last
weekend that Eldredge would
probably not return to singles un
til the April 17-18 trip to UCLA
and USC. As of yesterday, he was
still not certain whether he
wanted to rush Eldredge back into
the singles lineup Sunday.
It was Arizona's singles lineup
that did In the Cardinal the last
time the two teams met. The
Wildcats are led by Sue Russo at
the No. 1 position. Russo is 9-10
in singles this season.
Stanford's top performer this
season has been none other than
Patty Fendick, the defending

NCAA singles champion who Is
making a strong run at defending
her title. Fendlck has won 41
straight college singles matches,
her last defeat coming almost a
year ago. Russo gave Fendlck one
of her most difficult matches of
the season when the two met ear
lier In the season In Tucson.
Monday, the Cardinal will host
Arizona State at 1:30 p.m. Stan
ford dropped the Sun Devils 0-0
Feb. 20 In Tempe.
Since the loss to the Cardinal,
ASU (11-10 overall and 2-5 in the
Pac-10) has knocked off USC 5-4
and Arizona 6-3. "It's been a weird
year," Sun Devil Coach Sheila
Mclnerney said. "I've got five
seniors and a couple suffering
from seniorltis, I think."
ASU's No. 1 player is under .500
this season. Laura Glitz posts a 7-
10 mark in dual matches.
However, Carol Coparanis. who
plays No. 2. is 13-6 on the season,
and Therese Arlldsen is 12-8 at
No. 3.
Mclnerney had nothing but
praise for Stanford. With regards
to the Cardinal's chances of
repeating as national champion,
Mclnerney said, "I think Stan
ford's got a great chance."
While serving as one of the
coaches of the Junior Federation
Cup team last year, Mclnerney got
to know Eldredge, who was a
member of the team. She said that
she is pulling for Eldredge to come
back from her injury, but she
added, "I'm not crazy about Leigh
Anne getting too healthy this
weekend."
