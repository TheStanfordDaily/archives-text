# Netters desperately in need of victories
## Stanford men host Sun Devils, Wildcats 
### JON WEISMAN Staff writer 
All season long, the Stanford
men's tennis team has had to gear
itself up for crucial matches. That
condition comes from remaining
on the borderline of being invited
to the NCAA championships next
month.
This weekend is no different for
the Cardinal, except that if it loses
either match at Stanford Tennis
Stadium to No. 15 Arizona State
(today at 1:30 p.m.) or Arizona
(tomorrow at noon), Stanford
probably will not have the same
reason to gear up for its matches
next week against the nation's top
three teams.
"It's going to be tough, but we
still have a chance," Stanford
junior Patrick McEnroe said. "It's
not a good chance, and if we lose
any of these matches this week,
we have no chance."
Stanford, 9-8 overall and 2-3 in
the Pacific 10 Southern Division,
has a 1-7 record against top-20
opponents, with that one victory
coming April 10 at ASU. But the
Cardinal can't be faulted for not
trying. Except for an 8-1 loss to
UCLA a week ago, none of the
losses has been by more than two
matches.
The most recent example came
Wednesday at Berkeley, where the

Cardinal lost to California for the
second time this season. 6-3.
"We're pretty close, but we can't
quite make it over the hump,"
Stanford Coach Dick Gould said.
"I look for some upsets (in the next
five matches). I look for something
to happen."
"Definitely we're a little low after
(California)," McEnroe said.
"Myself, I kind of let the team
down. Usually. I play well in a big
match."
Although McEnroe lost to Cali
fornia's Woody Hunt, he had two
of Stanford's three singles wins
last weekend against UCLA and
USC, both over top-20 players.
Stanford, which had a com
pletely healthy team for the first
time less than three weeks ago.
must again ponder the prospect of
playing without at least one
starter.
Geordie McKee, who missed
Wednesday's match when a bruise
on a bone on the bottom of his foot
flared up, te out of today's match
and is doubtful for tomorrow.
However, Scott Moody, barring
any flareup of the knee injury that
also kept him out of the match
against the Bears, will probably
Play..
Gould indicated that a change
may be coming in the top two
doubles positions, which are a
combined 1-9 in Six-Pac play.
