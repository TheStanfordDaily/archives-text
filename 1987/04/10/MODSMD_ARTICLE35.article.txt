## 
### ROBERT PORTNOY Staff writer 
They're over the hump. The
Stanford men's golf team has fi
nally found Itself, If you can say
that after one successful tourn
ament, and It didn't come a mo
ment too soon.
In preparation for next
week's Western Intercollegiate
In San Jose, the Cardinal tees
It up today and tomorrow In the
Fresno Pepsi Classic. With
only three tournaments left on
Its 1986-87 schedule, Stanford
last weekend began to realize
some of the potential promised
by this year's highly touted
freshman class. Granted, the
Cardinal's success came on Its
home course In the Stanford
U.S. Intercollegiate, but In a
season that has seen only one
other top-five finish, grabbing
fifth place was a certain
confidence-builder.
Finishing fifth in a field that
had three of the top 11 teams in
the country Is probably the
least of what the Cardinal ac

complished. It shot 368 to lead
the tournament after the first
round, the first time any of the
starting six players had ever
been in that position.
More importantly, they
played well enough through the
last nine holes of the first day to
be just seven shots off the lead
going Into the final 27 holes.
It turned out that USC
knocked every stick down the
final day to run away with the
tournament. But the players
were all spread out over the
course, so the Stanford golfers
felt they were In the hunt much
of the way. which they indeed
were. It was the first time any of
the starting six had been in
contention for a tournament
title.
"We can at least know that
we're able to compete, to be in
the top half of the field, and
even be In contention for titles.
Each person is playing much,
much better. Knowing we can
do that is a big boost," sopho
more John Mahon said.
