# Stanford cyclists at UC-Santa Cruz
## 
### WITOLD J. HENISZ 
At the midpoint of the 1987 season, three
teams have emerged from the pack of the West
ern Collegiate Cycling Conference to battle for
first place.
With an outstanding performance at San
Diego State two weeks ago, the UC-Santa Bar
bara squad has vaulted into contention along
with archrlvals Stanford and Cal Poly-San Luis
Obispo.
This weekend, Stanford travels to compete
In two 50-mlle road races In the uncomfortable
heat of Santa Cruz. The Cardinal will cycle
against all of the contending teams in the
WCCC.
Two weeks ago, the Cardinal was upset by
California 127-124 at the Chico State Road
Race, with rival Cal Poly scoring a distant
third.
The order of finish had Stanford riders Mike
Collins, Bob Borchers and Tom Moyer all in the
top five, but the places were downgraded when
the officials granted two Cal riders places
despite a wrong turn on the course.
In the 'B' race, Hank Dart, John Chang and
Vit Henisz all scored points for Stanford. Brian
Bray finished seventh In the 'C' race. Laura
Rodman. Jennifer Hubbert. Wendy Dick and

Vickl Levine all scored points In the women's
race.
The next day.the Cardinal rode In the Davis
crlterlum and won Its second- most Impressive
victory of the season. Stanford easily beat Cal
Poly 180.5 to 168.5.
Moyer led the 'A' team to victory, but not
without some difficulty. Early In the race a bolt
In his shoe sheared in half. Luckily, Moyer had
recently seen an amateur cyclist who could tie
his shoes while riding, and he had been prac
ticing this feat himself. Moyer received a hand
off of a spare shoe and proceeded to rip off his
defective footware and replace it without losing
contact with the main pack.
Moyer scored in all of the preems and came
across the line In third place, followed by Bor
chers and Collins in ninth and 12th,
respectively.
In the 'B' race. Brock La Porte, Dart and
Henisz all scored in the points. Scooter Wil
liams had his best career race, finishing sixth
In the 'C' field despite a crash at the finish line.
Rodman and Hubbert finished 1-2 in the
women's race.
The Cardinal kept this victory in mind as it
traveled to San Luis Obispo last weekend
where one year ago It had watched the league

championship sail away In a rush of 1-2-3 Cal
Poly finishes.
Moyer took the responsibility square on his
shoulders and rode the strongest race of any
Stanford rider this season. Moyer chased down
at least a half dozen Cal Poly breaks and scored
consistently In the preems. He managed to
finish in second place ahead of all 19 Cal Poly
entrants.
Only John Moffet joined Moyer at the finish
for Stanford; all the other 'A' riders had been
left behind by the furious 28-mph pace.
In the 'B' race. La Porte's solo break with two
laps to go silenced the hundreds of home town
fans and brought him his first victory ever.
Earlier. Stanford had been victorious when
Moffet — a former Olympic swimmer and Cy
cling Olympic Training Center graduate —
finished in second place In a double kilometer
time trial.
In the road race, Stanford had only a wealth
of bad luck. Moffet did finish In fifth and Moyer
did win the field sprint for eighth place, but
only La Porte, Henisz and Miller joined them in
the points.
Though Cal Poly won the three-stage race
easily. It fell far under its runaway victory of a
year ago. Stanford remained In the running
along with UCSB for the league crown.
