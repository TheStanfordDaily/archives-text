### SOHAILA ABDULALI 
Thirteen pieces of white Styrofoam that were
used In an April Fool's sculpture In the Quad
last week were stolen from a construction site
near the Anatomy Building at the end of
March, according to Stanford police.
The pieces are worth *1,200 and whoever
took them from the construction site commit
ted grand theft, a felony offense, according to
Stanford Police Chief Marvin Herrington.
Herrington said most of the pieces were
found yesterday at various locations around
campus.
The 18-foot-long pieces first appeared In the
Quad April 1 in the form of a mock
Stonehenge, with a note from a group identify
ing itself as Stanford Out of Druidic Affairs
(SODA).

Herrington said the police saw the pieces in
the Quad, but left them alone because there
had been no complaint. "No one knew that
they belonged to anyone In particular." he
said.
The pieces were not reported stolen from the
construction site until April 7, Herrington
said. "They finally put two and two together,"
he said.
After appearing in the Quad in druidic
formation, the pieces were removed and
spread around campus.
Junior Derek Ott said he was walking
through the Quad April 1 and saw University
workers dismantling the structure. "We just
asked if we could have them, since it looked
like they were going to be thrown away, and
they (the workers) said yes," Ott said. He said
five pieces were used to make a dock In
Lagunita.

However, Ralph Buchanan, director of
Operations and Maintenance, said that no
University workers had been sent to dismantle
the Quad sculpture. "I can find no one who
would have been taking it down ... at least
not in an official capacity," he said.
Herrlngton said the people who took the
pieces from the Quad would be questioned
when they were identified, but he said he did
not think they had committed any crime if
they did not know the pieces were stolen prop
erty.
Herrlngton said he did not know whether all
the pieces could still be used. "I was hoping
we'd find them in relatively good shape, but if
they're at the bottom of the lake. ..."
Ott said he hopes that if the pieces can no
longer be used for construction they will be
allowed to stay in Lag.
