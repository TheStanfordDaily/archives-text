# DU Rush prompts Res Ed memorandum
## 
### MARCUS MABRY Senior staff writer 
A flier publicizing this year's Delta Up
silon fraternity Rush prompted Fraternal
Affairs Adviser Joe Pisano to issue a memo
this week to resident assistants (RAs) re
questing their "help in educating fresh
men" about the current status of the unrec
ognized fraternity.
In the memo Pisano asks that potential
DU rushees be informed of the status of the
Stanford chapter. The memo restates that:
□ The DU fraternity is currently unrecog

nized at Stanford and the earliest that a DU
chapter can apply for provisional recogni
tion from the University is fall quarter,
1989. This prohibits the fraternity from
having or publicizing group events on
campus.
□ The DU national office has suspended
the Stanford chapter. No one who joins the
DU's this spring will be initiated into the
national fraternity.
□ No student who is a member of the cur
rently unrecognized DU chapter will be a
part of a future group if the fraternity is
given University recognition.

□ The following stipulation, made when
the University decided to revoke recognition
of the fraternity, applies to all DU actives
and pledges at Stanford. It would also apply
to anyone who joins the fraternity this
spring. "Until further notice, actives and
pledges of Delta Upsilon are not permitted
to visit or to live in the residence at 553
Mayfield Avenue," the memo states.
The University revoked recognition of the
DUs spring quarter of last year and ter
minated their housing privileges, citing a
long history of destructive and anti-social
behavior.

Pisano said the memo is not an attempt
to limit the freedom of students to associate
with each other. "No one is preventing
Stanford freshmen from associating with
whoever they want," he said.
"I felt it necessary that any freshman — or
anyone else — interested in joining an un
recognized group know their chances of
gaining recognition," Pisano said. "Based
on all the information, people can make
their own decisions."
The fraternity does not have an "ignoble"
