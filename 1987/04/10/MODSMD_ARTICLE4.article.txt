# DU Rush prompts Res Ed memorandum
## 
### MARCUS MABRY Senior staff writer 
A flier publicizing this year's Delta Up
silon fraternity Rush prompted Fraternal
Affairs Adviser Joe Pisano to issue a memo
this week to resident assistants (RAs) re
questing their "help in educating fresh
men" about the current status of the unrec
ognized fraternity.
In the memo Pisano asks that potential
DU rushees be informed of the status of the
Stanford chapter. The memo restates that:
□ The DU fraternity is currently unrecog

nized at Stanford and the earliest that a DU
chapter can apply for provisional recogni
tion from the University is fall quarter,
1989. This prohibits the fraternity from
having or publicizing group events on
campus.
□ The DU national office has suspended
the Stanford chapter. No one who joins the
DU's this spring will be initiated into the
national fraternity.
□ No student who is a member of the cur
rently unrecognized DU chapter will be a
part of a future group if the fraternity is
given University recognition.

□ The following stipulation, made when
the University decided to revoke recognition
of the fraternity, applies to all DU actives
and pledges at Stanford. It would also apply
to anyone who joins the fraternity this
spring. "Until further notice, actives and
pledges of Delta Upsilon are not permitted
to visit or to live in the residence at 553
Mayfield Avenue," the memo states.
The University revoked recognition of the
DUs spring quarter of last year and ter
minated their housing privileges, citing a
long history of destructive and anti-social
behavior.

Pisano said the memo is not an attempt
to limit the freedom of students to associate
with each other. "No one is preventing
Stanford freshmen from associating with
whoever they want," he said.
"I felt it necessary that any freshman — or
anyone else — interested in joining an un
recognized group know their chances of
gaining recognition," Pisano said. "Based
on all the information, people can make
their own decisions."
The fraternity does not have an "ignoble"
history, according to Pisano. and
there is a chance that it will regain
recognition, but there must be a
"break In the action between the
destructive last year of the DU's
and any possible good chapter in
the future."
He noted that the best chance of
getting a future DU chapter at
Stanford would come from
making a complete break with the
past DU's.
DU President Scott Hartman
said the fraternity's Rush would
be completely off-campus. He said
his Initial reaction to the memo
was that the University was deter
mined to undermine anv artivltv

of the group, regardless of Its loca
tion.
"We thought we were staying
within University policy by
keeping our Rush off campus. We
enjoy one another's company and
we want to keep the house going,
despite the fact that there is no
physical structure," he said.
While the group is permitted to
gather off campus, it is not per
mitted to advertise those gather
ings on campus.
Pisano said he currently has no
punitive plans in mind concern
ing the dissemination of DU Rush
publicity.
Hartman said he has no idea
what the prospects of success are
for an off-campus Rush for an un
recognized fraternity. "No one has
ever done this before." he said.
