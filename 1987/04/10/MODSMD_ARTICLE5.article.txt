### MARTHA MOODY Staff writer 
The man who assaulted a
Stanford student outside the
Physics Tank Wednesday even
ing may have been attempting
to rape her. according to Stan
ford Police Chief Marvin Her
rington. The man attacked the
woman in daylight and
wounded her with a small knife

before she fought him off.
' Herrington said he does not
know what the man's motive
was, but that rape was a possi
bility because he did not try to
rob her. "I don't think he in
tended to use the knife for any
thing but a threat," Herrington
said. "He didn't expect that sort
of resistance . . . she fought
pretty hard." Since it was still
daylight, fear of apprehension
may have been another reason the
attacker gave up, Herrington said.
The fact that this attack oc
curred before nightfall does not
make it unusual, Herrington said.
"Over the years, sexual assaults
on women have occurred just as
frequently In broad daylight as at
night," he said.

Herrington urged everyone who
is alone at any time of day to be
suspicious of anyone loitering
about who fits the attacker's des
cription: a white male in his 30s,
about 5-foot-11, thin- to medium
build. The suspect is described as
clean-cut in appearance with
straight brown hair cut above col
lar length.
Anyone who thinks they may
have seen this individual should
call the Stanford Police at 723-
9633 or 911. Herrington also
urged everyone to exercise caution
at all times of day.
