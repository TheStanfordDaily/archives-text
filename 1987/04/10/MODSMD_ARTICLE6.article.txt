### MONIQUE SCHEER Senior staff writer 
This is another in a series of articles about the
issues and candidates in next week's ASSU
election.

A "better quality of student life" is the ultim
ate goal of the "Slate of the Union," one of four
slates of candidates running for ASSU Council
of Presidents (COP).
Juniors Mike Cahill, Carole Solomon, Fred
Wang and Grant Winfrey, who make up the
COP slate, call for immediate improvements in
specific areas.
Rather than focusing on long-term goals, the
slate would like to work on "things we can ac
tually get accomplished within our term of of

fice," Solomon said.
Noting that many Ivy League schools have li
braries open until two or three in the morning,
Cahill said the slate would lobby for an exten
sion of hours at Meyer and Green libraries.

Another goal is to laminate student identifi
cation cards and include a magnetic strip on
the back. "We want to see it made into some
thing students can use at the bookstore as a
credit card and at Tresidder, (to) use their ex
tra (Food Service) meals," Cahill said.

The slate would also like to Improve health
care attention at Cowell and make computers
and printers more available to students.
"These are things that are commonly com
plained about," Solomon said.
Another aim of the Slate of the Union is to
increase student involvement in the ASSU and
other groups on campus to promote student
body unity.
"School spirit basically exists only during
Big Game Week," Solomon said. "But we're all
in this together. We're all trying to graduate. It
can also be something more like a big party."
To promote involvement, the slate plans to
place greater emphasis on effective publicity.
Winfrey described the slate's
plan for a "Stanford Awareness
Week," during which each dorm
on campus will cooperate with a
student group In a series of
workshops and speeches on major
campus Issues.
"The average student In Wilbur
doesn't know about groups on
campus. This is an opportunity
for them to voice their opinion,"
Solomon added.

Part of the slate's planned
publicity drive Is to make student
groups aware of available ASSU
funding opportunities. According
to Wang, "last year there was a
lack of groups interested in get
ting money."
Cahill, a junior In history and
economics, is currently ASSU spe
cial projects and budget assistant
financial manager. He Is also in
volved with the Venture Capital
Committee and the Newman Cen
ter.
Solomon, a junior in interna
tional relations, acts as coordina
tor of special projects for the Black

Pre-Law and Public Service Soci
ety and is on the ASSU Nomina
tions Commission.
Wang, a junior in industrial en
gineering and economics, serves
as ASSU funding assistant finan
cial manager and was involved in
Stanford-In-Business last year.
Winfrey, a junior in sociology, is
the chairman of the Tresidder Un
ion Board and ASSU administra
tive assistant financial manager.
Last year he was the business
manager for the ASSU Course
Guide and two years ago he served
as an administrative assistant for
the COP.
