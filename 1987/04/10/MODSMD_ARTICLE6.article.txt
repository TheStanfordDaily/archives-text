This is another in a series of articles about the
issues and candidates in next week's ASSU
election.

A "better quality of student life" is the ultim
ate goal of the "Slate of the Union," one of four
slates of candidates running for ASSU Council
of Presidents (COP).
Juniors Mike Cahill, Carole Solomon, Fred
Wang and Grant Winfrey, who make up the
COP slate, call for immediate improvements in
specific areas.
Rather than focusing on long-term goals, the
slate would like to work on "things we can ac
tually get accomplished within our term of of

fice," Solomon said.
Noting that many Ivy League schools have li
braries open until two or three in the morning,
Cahill said the slate would lobby for an exten
sion of hours at Meyer and Green libraries.

Another goal is to laminate student identifi
cation cards and include a magnetic strip on
the back. "We want to see it made into some
thing students can use at the bookstore as a
credit card and at Tresidder, (to) use their ex
tra (Food Service) meals," Cahill said.

The slate would also like to Improve health
care attention at Cowell and make computers
and printers more available to students.
"These are things that are commonly com
plained about," Solomon said.
Another aim of the Slate of the Union is to
increase student involvement in the ASSU and
other groups on campus to promote student
body unity.
"School spirit basically exists only during
Big Game Week," Solomon said. "But we're all
in this together. We're all trying to graduate. It
can also be something more like a big party."
To promote involvement, the slate plans to
place greater emphasis on effective publicity.
