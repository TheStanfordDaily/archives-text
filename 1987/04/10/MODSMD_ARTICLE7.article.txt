# Soviet reforms limited, Taubman says
## Journalist assesses 'glasnost' 
### JOHN POLLACK Senior staff writer 
"Change is in the air" in the Soviet
Union, but Americans should not expect
a fundamental change in the Ideological
outlook of that nation, said Philip Taub
man, The New York Times' Moscow
bureau chief and former Stanford Daily
editor who spoke here last night.
Taubman. speaking to a group of
about 300 people In Kresge Auditorium,
discussed the authenticity and effective
ness of economic, political and social
reforms currently being Instituted in the
Soviet Union by Mikhail Gorbachev, the
Soviet general secretary.
He cited the Soviets' recent release of
dissident Andrei Sakharov as an impor
tant example of Gorbachev's wide
ranging policy of "glasnost," a Russian
word meaning "openness." Glasnost
refers to the Soviet government s recent
limited relaxation of control over politi

cal and intellectual discourse and cer
tain elements in the economy.
"It's a stunning symbol of change"
Taubman said, referring to Gorbachev's
personal telephone call to Sakharov that
ended the dissident's six-year internal
exile to the city of Gorky.
Taubman said the call was a
"courageous act" that demonstrated the
Soviet leader's "desire to see change take
place in the Soviet Union."
But Taubman was quick to note,
however, that Americans should not ex
pect a fundamental change in the So
viet's ideological outlook. Gorbachev is
only "seeking to perfect the Communist
system." he said. "The Soviet Union will
not ever become a Jeffersonian
Democracy."
Nevertheless. Gorbachev has in
stituted many notable changes in the
Soviet economic system. Taubman said.
Significant among these changes are:
□ Greater autonomy for plant

managers.
□ The introduction of second and third
shifts at factories.
□ The introduction of stricter quality
control in production.
□ The establishment of a link between
productivity and pay in the workplace.
□ The elimination and consolidation of
government ministries.
But Taubman pointed out that these
changes have not cured the "sluggish"
economy of its ills, saying that "the in
tractability of the economy has
frustrated Gorbachev and has also
surprised him."
"It is clear that Gorbachev is ex
perimenting," he said. "This generation
(of Soviet leaders) is impatient to get the
country moving."
"Soviets are increasingly impatient
with their poor standard of living." he
added, noting that there have been "few
tangible results" resulting from
Gorbachev's reforms. Soviets still
must wait in long lines for such
food staples as meat, milk and
butter, he said. Gorbachev "has
set In motion a series of expecta
tions that he cannot meet."
Despite these failures, Taub
man said, there Is no public
criticism of Gorbachev within the
Soviet Union, except in the form of
Jokes. In contrast to this virtual
silence Is the widening of public
debate on a variety of other social
issues that have traditionally been
taboo.

Homosexuality, crime, drug
abuse and corruption in politics
are among the topics now
debated, albeit mildly, in the edi
torial pages of the Soviet press,
which Is controlled by the govern
ment, Taubman said.
"The boundary of permissibility
Is much wider" than it used to be,
he said, calling this a "remarkable
change."
This expansion of boundaries is
also evident on Soviet television,
Taubman said. He recounted the
story of a "Soviet Mike Wallace"
who paid a "surprise visit" to a
shoe factory, where he proceeded
to berate the plant manager — on
the air — for the poor quality of
his product.
He also told of a Michael Jack

son video shown on Soviet televi
sion, interspersed with footage of
"a group of Soviet breakdancers."
Despite these relaxations of gov
ernment censorship and control,
Taubman stressed that there is no
such thing as Western-style
freedom of the press in the Soviet
Union. He said that some of the
reforms — such as the release of
certain imprisoned dissidents —
are possibly "Intended to reduce
criticism in the West," in prepara
tion for future arms control nego
tiations.
Taubman said that only when
he and other westerners are no
longer followed by the KGB as they
now are will he"know that change
has really arrived" in the Soviet
Union.
