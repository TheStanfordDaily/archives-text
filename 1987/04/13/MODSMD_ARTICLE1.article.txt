# Four win Mellon awards

### JAY BHATTACHARYA 
Four Stanford students have
been awarded the prestigious
Andrew Mellon Foundation Fel
lowships for excellence in the
humanities, the highest number
of Mellon recipients in the Univer
sity's history.
According to Carolyn Lougee,
dean of Undergraduate Studies,
the purpose of the Mellon Fellow
ships is to encourage the bright
est college graduates in the United
States and Canada to go on to aca
demic careers. It is intended to
counter the recent trend of
qualified humanities students
shying away from teaching and re
search.
The grant, which includes full
tuition, fees and a cash stipend of
*9,700, will support the
recipients in their studies at the
graduate school of their choice.
The support is renewable, and will
continue up to the level of a doc
toral thesis.
The Stanford winners are
seniors William Bristow in philos
ophy, Elizabeth Cheng in history,
and Daniel Kodmur in American
studies. In addition, Kirsten
Swinth, who graduated last year,
received a fellowship In American
art history.
The competition for the grants
is intense, according to Lougee.
This year, only 122 of the 1,722
candidates nominated by faculty
members across the country
received the award. The winners
included 79 seniors and 43 recent
graduates.
Each candidate had to undergo
a rigorous series of interviews
before being chosen. In addition,
their "record of academic achieve
ment," "creativity in thinking"
and faculty recommendations
were taken into account in the
final decision, Lougee said.
Stanford was fifth on the list of
schools with multiple award
recipients. Harvard topped the list
with 15 winners, Yale had 10,
Princeton had nine, and UC-
Berkeley had six. Stanford tied the
University of Chicago with four
winners.
Lougee stressed, however, that
this year was Stanford's best per
formance in this annual competi
tion, indicating an "upswing" in
humanities achievement at the
University. Ivy League schools
such as Harvard, Yale, and Prince
ton win more Mellon Fellowships,
she says, because the humanities
departments at those universities
are traditionally more visible than
they are at Stanford.
Lougee noted that unlike the Ivy
League schools, nearly half of
Stanford's student body is com
mitted to engineering and science
fields.
Cheng is finishing an honors
thesis in history, her major field.
She is considering several options
for next year, including a joint
program of history and law at the
University of Chicago. She eventu
ally wants to work in some aca
demic capacity.
Kodmur is also working on an
honors thesis in history. Next
year, he will begin a doctoral pro
gram in history at UC-Berkeley.
He plans eventually to teach his
tory at the university level.
Neither Bristow nor Swinth
could be reached for comment.
Although the total number of
applicants was up from last year,
Lougee said that she wasn't sure
whether the total number of Stan
ford applicants was up as well.
