Texaco files for bankruptcy
NEW YORK — Texaco Inc., the country's third largest oil com
pany, filed for protection under the federal bankruptcy laws yes
terday after attempts to settle its titanic legal battle against Pen
nzoll Co. failed to produce a deal acceptable to either side.
Texaco's dividend and debt interest payments will be in
definitely suspended as a result of the filing, affecting all Its stock
holders and owners of about *6.8 billion of Texaco bonds, com
pany officials said. But the bulk of Texaco's operations, including
gasoline sales, will not be Immediately impaired, the officials said.
Pennzoll, which won a record >10.53 billion jury verdict after
suing Texaco for wrongfully interfering with a merger contract,
will be hard hit by the filing because it must now attempt to
pursue its judgment in federal bankruptcy court here, attorneys
Involved In the case said.
Texaco chief executive James Kinnear said that decision to seek
bankruptcy protection was "difficult, painful and wrenching" but
"we had no choice in the matter." He accused Pennzoil chairman
J. Hugh Liedtke of Intransigence during settlement talks.
Pennzoll officials denounced Texaco's move as irresponsible
and unnecessary. "It's ridiculous," said Baine Kerr, a member of
Pennzoil's negotiating team. "What this means is that they've
decided that they can't win on appeal. We'll collect more this way.
It's just going to be a long process that will make a lot of lawyers
rich."
Afghan rebels attacked USSR
WASHINGTON - Afghan rebels have inflicted their first
casualties inside the Soviet Union, killing one Russian civilian
and wounding two others with rocket fire, but there are conflict
ing reports about whether the rebels set foot on Soviet soil or fired
across the border in the March 8 attack.
The incident is also particularly significant in that It is the first
time the Soviets have reported such an incident since their occu
pation of Afghanistan began in December 1979, U.S. officials
said.
The incident, reported a month after it took place, seems likely
to heighten Soviet concern about the potential threat of the Af
ghan resistance struggle to the Soviet Union, particularly its Mos
lem population In Tadzhikistan bordering on Afghanistan.
Several Afghan resistance groups claim they have been stepping
up the Infiltration of agents into Tadzhikistan to arouse Islamic
sentiments and hand out copies of the Koran. But never before
have they carried out such a provocative military operation that
they and the Soviets agree resulted in harsh Soviet reprisals on
rebel strongholds In northern Afghanistan.
Changed Soviets to greet Shultz
HELSINKI, Finland — As Secretary of State George Shultz
prepared to arrive in Moscow today for arms control talks, there
was a growing consensus among experts in the Soviet Union that
the Kremlin has significantly changed its attitude toward arms is
sues under leader Mikhail Gorbachev In a way that enhances
prospects for agreements in the long run.
But In the short run, negotiations toward such agreements
could require re-examlnation of fundamental North Atlantic
Treaty Organization doctrine and spark fights within the alliance,
particularly If some types of nuclear weapons are to be eliminated
entirely, rather than just reduced In numbers.
For example, while one goal of Shultz's meetings in Moscow is
an accord To reduce to zero the number of longer-range inter
mediate nuclear missiles in Europe, the possibility of eliminating
the shorter-range missiles as well is far from being warmly or uni
versally embraced by the Europeans. The longer-range weapons
have a reach of 1,000 to 3,000 miles and the shorter category ex
tends from 350 to 1,000 miles. Both are lumped together under
the designation intermediate nuclear forces.
A senior Reagan administration official noted yesterday that the
Soviets this week may propose eliminating both categories of
weapons. "But whether we are prepared to go to that, whether our
allies would want to go to that. Is not certain by any means" he
cautioned.
Eliminating all such weapons would have to be considered
within the context of NATO's doctrine of "flexible response," the
official explained. Under the doctrine, NATO needs many types of
nuclear weapons to provide many graduated responses short of
all-out nuclear war.
Whether today's more forthcoming stand by the Kremlin on se
curity issues represents the view of Gorbachev, a young leader
with a fresh approach, or whether it has been forced on the Krem
lin by America's military buildup over the past seven or eight
years, is not clear to Soviet experts.
Court to rule on Hinckley visit
WASHINGTON — Government prosecutors are asking U.S. Dis
trict Judge Barrington Parker to use a federal law passed In
response to John Hinckley Jr.'s acquittal by reason of Insanity In
the 1981 shooting of President Reagan in deciding whether
Hinckley will be permitted an Easter visit with his parents.
The law, signed by Reagan on Oct. 12, 1984, makes It more dif
ficult for defendants In federal cases to use the insanity defense
and it also makes It harder for defendants found not guilty by rea
son of Insanity to be released, even for short-term visits, from the
mental Institutions to which they are committed.
Hinckley, 32, is to appear before Parker in U.S. District Court
here today for a hearing on the request by St. Elizabeth's Hospital
that Hinckley be allowed a one-day, unescorted visit with his par
ents.
Prosecutors also have asked Parker to require St. Elizabeth's to
ask court approval for any escorted off-grounds visit by Hinckley,
such as his Dec. 28 visit with his parents in Reston. Va. That
visit, on which Hinckley was accompanied by an unarmed hospi
tal employee. Infuriated Secret Service officials who said the trip
posed possible danger to Reagan.
The hearing could also produce a ruling by Parker on just how
strong the evidence of Hinckley's sanity would have to be for him
to be discharged from the hospital, where he has been held since
his trial In June 1982.
China adopts new press rules
SHANGHAI, China — The Chinese Communist Party has

from publishing articles on certain controversial subjects, accord
ing to press and party propaganda officials.

One topic specifically placed off limits for now is the reform of
China's political svstem. Journalists say.
"We were informed by the propaganda department that this
should be discussed Internally, not In the society at large." said
Zhu Xingqing, deputy editor in chief of the World Economic
Herald.
In an Interview. Gong Xinhan. vice minister of the Shanghai
Communist Party's propaganda department, confirmed that new
rules have been given to the press about which subjects may be
aired In the mass media.

shares by Chinese enterprises is another subject on which

allies would want to go to that. Is not certain by any means" he
cautioned.
Eliminating all such weapons would have to be considered
within the context of NATO's doctrine of "flexible response," the
official explained. Under the doctrine, NATO needs many types of
nuclear weapons to provide many graduated responses short of
all-out nuclear war.
Whether today's more forthcoming stand by the Kremlin on se
curity issues represents the view of Gorbachev, a young leader
with a fresh approach, or whether it has been forced on the Krem
lin by America's military buildup over the past seven or eight
years, is not clear to Soviet experts.
Court to rule on Hinckley visit
WASHINGTON — Government prosecutors are asking U.S. Dis
trict Judge Barrington Parker to use a federal law passed In
response to John Hinckley Jr.'s acquittal by reason of Insanity In
the 1981 shooting of President Reagan in deciding whether
Hinckley will be permitted an Easter visit with his parents.
The law, signed by Reagan on Oct. 12, 1984, makes It more dif
ficult for defendants In federal cases to use the insanity defense
and it also makes It harder for defendants found not guilty by rea
son of Insanity to be released, even for short-term visits, from the
mental Institutions to which they are committed.
Hinckley, 32, is to appear before Parker in U.S. District Court
here today for a hearing on the request by St. Elizabeth's Hospital
that Hinckley be allowed a one-day, unescorted visit with his par
ents.
Prosecutors also have asked Parker to require St. Elizabeth's to
ask court approval for any escorted off-grounds visit by Hinckley,
such as his Dec. 28 visit with his parents in Reston. Va. That
visit, on which Hinckley was accompanied by an unarmed hospi
tal employee. Infuriated Secret Service officials who said the trip
posed possible danger to Reagan.
The hearing could also produce a ruling by Parker on just how
strong the evidence of Hinckley's sanity would have to be for him
to be discharged from the hospital, where he has been held since
his trial In June 1982.

Texaco files for bankruptcy
NEW YORK — Texaco Inc., the country's third largest oil com
pany, filed for protection under the federal bankruptcy laws yes
terday after attempts to settle its titanic legal battle against Pen
nzoll Co. failed to produce a deal acceptable to either side.
Texaco's dividend and debt interest payments will be in
definitely suspended as a result of the filing, affecting all Its stock
holders and owners of about *6.8 billion of Texaco bonds, com
pany officials said. But the bulk of Texaco's operations, including
gasoline sales, will not be Immediately impaired, the officials said.
Pennzoll, which won a record >10.53 billion jury verdict after
suing Texaco for wrongfully interfering with a merger contract,
will be hard hit by the filing because it must now attempt to
pursue its judgment in federal bankruptcy court here, attorneys
Involved In the case said.
Texaco chief executive James Kinnear said that decision to seek
bankruptcy protection was "difficult, painful and wrenching" but
"we had no choice in the matter." He accused Pennzoil chairman
J. Hugh Liedtke of Intransigence during settlement talks.
Pennzoll officials denounced Texaco's move as irresponsible
and unnecessary. "It's ridiculous," said Baine Kerr, a member of
Pennzoil's negotiating team. "What this means is that they've
decided that they can't win on appeal. We'll collect more this way.
It's just going to be a long process that will make a lot of lawyers
rich."
Afghan rebels attacked USSR
WASHINGTON - Afghan rebels have inflicted their first
casualties inside the Soviet Union, killing one Russian civilian
and wounding two others with rocket fire, but there are conflict
ing reports about whether the rebels set foot on Soviet soil or fired
across the border in the March 8 attack.
The incident is also particularly significant in that It is the first
time the Soviets have reported such an incident since their occu
pation of Afghanistan began in December 1979, U.S. officials
said.
The incident, reported a month after it took place, seems likely
to heighten Soviet concern about the potential threat of the Af
ghan resistance struggle to the Soviet Union, particularly its Mos
lem population In Tadzhikistan bordering on Afghanistan.
Several Afghan resistance groups claim they have been stepping
up the Infiltration of agents into Tadzhikistan to arouse Islamic
sentiments and hand out copies of the Koran. But never before
have they carried out such a provocative military operation that
they and the Soviets agree resulted in harsh Soviet reprisals on
rebel strongholds In northern Afghanistan.
Changed Soviets to greet Shultz
HELSINKI, Finland — As Secretary of State George Shultz
prepared to arrive in Moscow today for arms control talks, there
was a growing consensus among experts in the Soviet Union that
the Kremlin has significantly changed its attitude toward arms is
sues under leader Mikhail Gorbachev In a way that enhances
prospects for agreements in the long run.
But In the short run, negotiations toward such agreements
could require re-examlnation of fundamental North Atlantic
Treaty Organization doctrine and spark fights within the alliance,
particularly If some types of nuclear weapons are to be eliminated
entirely, rather than just reduced In numbers.
For example, while one goal of Shultz's meetings in Moscow is
an accord To reduce to zero the number of longer-range inter
mediate nuclear missiles in Europe, the possibility of eliminating
the shorter-range missiles as well is far from being warmly or uni
versally embraced by the Europeans. The longer-range weapons
have a reach of 1,000 to 3,000 miles and the shorter category ex
tends from 350 to 1,000 miles. Both are lumped together under
the designation intermediate nuclear forces.
A senior Reagan administration official noted yesterday that the
Soviets this week may propose eliminating both categories of
weapons. "But whether we are prepared to go to that, whether our
allies would want to go to that. Is not certain by any means" he
cautioned.
