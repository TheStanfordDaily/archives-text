## THE 						STANFORD DAILY An Independent Newspaper Encourage gay RAs 
### 
Recently, the Office of Residential Educa
tion took a positive step toward combating
prejudice by encouraging gays and those
sensitive to issues of sexual identity to apply
to be resident assistants.
Res Ed's action is intended to help
overcome the fear of homosexuality and
sexual minorities. Obviously, this homo
phobia is a negative aspect of our culture and
is at the root of sexual discrimination and
oppression.
Gays are often a misunderstood minority
because they are primarily an invisible
minority. Res Ed has recognized that if gays
were more visible, there would be more op
portunities to break down stereotypes and
properly discuss sexual issues.
Since Res Ed's policy seeks only to inform
gays of these opportunities, it is entirely fair.
Lesbians and gay men will not be given
priority in receiving RA positions. There is
no "sexual preference" box on the application

for gays to check in order to receive special
consideration. As always. Res Ed will leave
hiring to the resident fellows of each living
group.
As well as bringing issues such as homo
phobia to the forefront, gay RAs can be help
ful to students who have questions about un
derstanding their own sexual identity.
Homosexuality can be a difficult topic to dis
cuss openly; RAs who understand the con
cerns involved can be important to people
trying to understand themselves.
There is an additional positive aspect of
the Res Ed policy: Res Ed has recognized the
legitimacy of gays and their concerns. This
simple recognition is important for a
minority group that some wrongly label as
sinful or deviant.
RFs should avoid hiring based on sexual
preference. But applicants who understand
gay and lesbian concerns should be asked to
join residence staffs and to become RAs.
