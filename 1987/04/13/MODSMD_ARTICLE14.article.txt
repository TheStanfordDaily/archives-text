### 
SDI system is
vulnerable
After reading Computer Science
Prof. John McCarthy's optimistic
assessment of the Strategic
Defense Initiative's (SDl's) com
puting feasibility (Daily, March
31), I accept his challenge to
"help" with SDI — assuming for
now that criticism of the ad
hominem variety does not qualify
as such.
McCarthy's comparison be
tween turning on SDI and bring
ing up a new telephone switching
computer misses the central
point. In order to work, SDI must
survive and function in the midst
of an adversary's maneuvers to
knock it out.
How would McCarthy assess
the odds of keeping a large com
puterized phone network up and
running when a competitor
phone company's most ruthless
vice presidents are scheming —
no holds barred — to make it
crash? Wouldn't an appropriately
placed bomb take care of a
centralized computer? Or, in the
case of a highly distributed sys
tem. wouldn't simply cutting
enough communication cables
and antenna feeds cripple the
system enough to impose unac
ceptable delays upon data and
messages?
Software systems offer an ad-

versary some very tempting vul
nerabilities: Why not plant a
"time bomb" in the code, kidnap
the system's most knowledgeable
software engineers the day it's set
to go off and then launch a final
offensive while second-string
engineers attempt — under gruel
ing pressure — a system restart?
In the midst of these attacks on
the system, a few recalcitrant
bugs in the software would be the
least of anyone's worries.
None of the countermeasures
I've suggested cost the tiniest
fraction of what it might eventu
ally cost to design effective immu
nity from them. In addition to
their dollar costs, these "immune
systems" would cost the system
complexity which in turn
presents even more avenues for
sabotage.
After four years of "studying"
SDI, none of its proponents have
seriously acknowledged the issue
of vulnerability to cheaper, low
tech countermeasures. This ap
palling lack of candor and inat
tentiveness to cost effectiveness is
reason enough alone for Congress
to kill the program.
Some researchers accept SDI as
a vehicle for getting their work
done while advancing the na
tion's basic technologies, in spite
of harboring reservations about
whether overall SDI objectives are
realistic. Once Reagan is out of
office, I suspect that accountabil
ity for SDI costs vs. benefits will

increasingly be levied. Under
such scrutiny there is a good
chance of the entire SDI concept
being largely discredited.
If so, these same scientists may
someday feel embarrassment and
regret over having gone along
with it.

Farm absurd
in recent days
Stanford is fast becoming the
theater of the absurd.
The Faculty Senate sees noth
ing unreasonable about urging
the University Board of Trustees
to disregard four years of plan
ning and renege on their commit
ment so that the faculty can
redesign and relocate the Reagan
Library. • '■'fa"
After spending their 10-day
spring break in El Salvador, Stan
ford students return convinced,
not only that they know who and
what are to blame for that
country's strife, but that their
views merit serious considera
tion. They'll probably get it, on a
campus where no one expresses
skepticism that the real purpose
of a trip sponsored by those well
qualified construction experts,
the Public Service Center and
Memorial Church, was to help

rebuild the earthquake-damaged
University of San Salvador.
Campus health professionals
push a board game called
"Sexploration," believing that
student ignorance of the meaning
of the word "fornication" implies
ignorance about sex. and that
talking about sex is useful in
preventing sexually transmitted
diseases, unwanted pregnancies
and difficulties in interpersonal
relationships. If only there were
some competent evidence for this
lovely thought! It's not clear
whether abstinence has a spot on
the board, but the acting dean of
the chapel asserts that the Uni
versity should encourage stu
dents to make "ethical" decisions
but shouldn't determine the
"moral content" of these deci
sions. Such a statement coming
from a clergyman sounds a little
odd, especially since he's exhib
ited no similar moral neutrality
when it comes to such issues as
the sanctuary movement.
The general public sees no need
for education about rape; every
one's in favor of punishing it
severely. Nevertheless, although
Stanford students can't talk
about sex, there's a student
group called "The Rape Education
Project," whose efforts include a
film entitled "Re-thinking Rape."
As a lawyer in the public sector,
I'd like to plead with University
President Donald Kennedy and

the deans of the schools of law
and business, who are urging
students to enter "public service"
(i.e., government and the non
profit sector) so that they can —
God help us — "Make a differ
ence": Please, folks, direct your
products elsewhere; the public
sector is already over-endowed
with inane policies and shallow
"thinkers."

Alternate site
suggested/or
the library
While ground is unbroken and
contracts still unsigned, may I
please offer an alternative to the
Reagan Library's proposed site?
The present site has had much
negative reception. Maybe it goes
back to our early instincts of
self-preservation. No one
welcomes an occupation of the
uphill dominant position. Present
plans will place the extensive
development higher than any
thing on the Stanford campus. It
imposes a monument upon us
and upon a rural vista and, in
addition, carries the threat that
now these pastoral hills will be
found "ideal" for further develop
ment.
Many Reagan admirers (and all

who are not) will resent that Im
position every time they drive
down Junipero Serra Blvd. (or are
rerouted from it because of devel
opment) and every time they raise
their heads to look at the western
hills.
The site I suggest is near the
site being considered and nearer
to main highway access.The li
brary would not be a large intru
sion during construction or with
its eventual use. It could be a
beautiful place to develop an
unusual garden and to locate a
library — a center generations
would enjoy, not resent.
As the famed Butchart Gardens
in Victoria, 8.C., this center
would have as its beginning an
old quarry, the quarry off Old
Page Mill Road.
Please, if this site is consid
ered, remember it is important to
employ at the outset the special
expertise of a landscape architect
to establish a land-use plan so
that the library and other
developments may be a happy
marriage (Instead of an imposi
tion of function). This could in
spire or challenge an architect to
design a really great building, not
a flatland quadrangle imposed on
a grassy hill.
Unusual problems beget unus
;ual solutions.
Thank you for your considera
tion of my proposal.

what are to blame for that
country's strife, but that their
views merit serious considera
tion. They'll probably get it, on a
campus where no one expresses
skepticism that the real purpose
of a trip sponsored by those well
qualified construction experts,
the Public Service Center and
Memorial Church, was to help

Campus health professionals

"Sexploration," believing that

whether abstinence has a spot on
the board, but the acting dean of
the chapel asserts that the Uni

but shouldn't determine the
"moral content" of these deci

from a clergyman sounds a little
odd, especially since he's exhib

The general public sees no need

severely. Nevertheless, although
Stanford students can't talk
about sex, there's a student

As a lawyer in the public sector,
I'd like to plead with University
President Donald Kennedy and

the deans of the schools of law

God help us — "Make a differ

with inane policies and shallow
"thinkers."

Alternate site
suggested/or
the library
While ground is unbroken and
contracts still unsigned, may I
please offer an alternative to the
Reagan Library's proposed site?
The present site has had much
negative reception. Maybe it goes
back to our early instincts of
self-preservation. No one
welcomes an occupation of the
uphill dominant position. Present
plans will place the extensive
development higher than any
thing on the Stanford campus. It
imposes a monument upon us
and upon a rural vista and, in
addition, carries the threat that
now these pastoral hills will be
found "ideal" for further develop
ment.
Many Reagan admirers (and all

who are not) will resent that Im
position every time they drive
down Junipero Serra Blvd. (or are
rerouted from it because of devel
opment) and every time they raise
their heads to look at the western
hills.
The site I suggest is near the
site being considered and nearer
to main highway access.The li
brary would not be a large intru
sion during construction or with
its eventual use. It could be a
beautiful place to develop an
unusual garden and to locate a
library — a center generations
would enjoy, not resent.
As the famed Butchart Gardens
in Victoria, 8.C., this center
would have as its beginning an
old quarry, the quarry off Old
Page Mill Road.
Please, if this site is consid
ered, remember it is important to
employ at the outset the special
expertise of a landscape architect
to establish a land-use plan so
that the library and other
developments may be a happy
marriage (Instead of an imposi
tion of function). This could in
spire or challenge an architect to
design a really great building, not
a flatland quadrangle imposed on
a grassy hill.
Unusual problems beget unus
;ual solutions.
Thank you for your considera
tion of my proposal.

SDI system is
vulnerable
After reading Computer Science
Prof. John McCarthy's optimistic
assessment of the Strategic
Defense Initiative's (SDl's) com
puting feasibility (Daily, March
31), I accept his challenge to
"help" with SDI — assuming for
now that criticism of the ad
hominem variety does not qualify
as such.
McCarthy's comparison be
tween turning on SDI and bring
ing up a new telephone switching
computer misses the central
point. In order to work, SDI must
survive and function in the midst
of an adversary's maneuvers to
knock it out.
How would McCarthy assess
the odds of keeping a large com
puterized phone network up and
running when a competitor
phone company's most ruthless
vice presidents are scheming —
no holds barred — to make it
crash? Wouldn't an appropriately
placed bomb take care of a
centralized computer? Or, in the
case of a highly distributed sys
tem. wouldn't simply cutting
enough communication cables
and antenna feeds cripple the
system enough to impose unac
ceptable delays upon data and
messages?
Software systems offer an ad-

versary some very tempting vul
nerabilities: Why not plant a
"time bomb" in the code, kidnap
the system's most knowledgeable
software engineers the day it's set
to go off and then launch a final
offensive while second-string
engineers attempt — under gruel
ing pressure — a system restart?
In the midst of these attacks on
the system, a few recalcitrant
bugs in the software would be the
least of anyone's worries.
None of the countermeasures
I've suggested cost the tiniest
fraction of what it might eventu
ally cost to design effective immu
nity from them. In addition to
their dollar costs, these "immune
systems" would cost the system
complexity which in turn
presents even more avenues for
sabotage.
After four years of "studying"
SDI, none of its proponents have
seriously acknowledged the issue
of vulnerability to cheaper, low
tech countermeasures. This ap
palling lack of candor and inat
tentiveness to cost effectiveness is
reason enough alone for Congress
to kill the program.
Some researchers accept SDI as
a vehicle for getting their work
done while advancing the na
tion's basic technologies, in spite
of harboring reservations about
whether overall SDI objectives are
realistic. Once Reagan is out of
office, I suspect that accountabil
ity for SDI costs vs. benefits will

increasingly be levied. Under
such scrutiny there is a good
chance of the entire SDI concept
being largely discredited.
If so, these same scientists may
someday feel embarrassment and
regret over having gone along
with it.
