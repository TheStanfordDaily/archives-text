# 'Princess Ida' is a real winner
## 
### 
For an evening of pure escapist pleasure,
everyone enjoys a great sexist musical comedy.
They haven't made a good one since "My Fair
Lady." Everybody is too sensitive today, I
suppose. If you are willing to go back a cen
tury. though, you will discover a riotous, revel
ing, sexist romp by William S. Gilbert and Sir
Arthur Sullivan entitled "Princess Ida," which,
by coincidence, the Stanford Savoyards will be
presenting at the end of this month. "Princess
Ida" forcefully demonstrates what can happen
when women try to isolate themselves from
men. All feminist studies majors should be re
quired to attend.

Gilbert and Sullivan!?! Isn't that, like, cul
ture? Man, I hate that classical Shakespeare
and opera-type stuff. Hey, never fear — so do I.
Trust me. this is different. Am I not the same
guy who writes about roller derby and ice
hockey? Would I send you to something that
the common blue-collar, beer-drinking kind of
guy couldn't understand and enjoy?
First of all. "Princess Ida" is in English and it
is an operetta. That makes it like a Broadway
show. The funniest and most important lines
are spoken rather than sung so that the audi
ence doesn't miss them. Furthermore,
"Princess Ida" features drunkenness, men in
drag and plenty of violence. You just can't beat
it for first-class entertainment.
Act I opens at King Hlldebrand's castle,
where the assembled masses await the arrival
of King Gama's ship and speculate as to
whether Princess Ida will be with him. Hil
debrand directs that rich robes, a luxurious
bed and a costly banquet be reserved for Gama
if Princess Ida is on board. If not. bread and
water In a dungeon cell will be Gama's fate.
Apparently. Princess Ida and Hlldebrand's
son Hilarion were engaged to be married 20
years earlier, at the ages of one and two,
respectively. The prophets, of course, disap
proved. since "Husband twice as old as wife,
argues ill for married life." Rumor has it that
Princess Ida has renounced men and shut her
self Inside a women's college. King Hlldebrand.

a monarch not to be messed with, has vowed
"upon his oath to trounce them both" should
King Gama arrive without Ida.
Gama arrives with only his three warrior
sons, who later in the play prepare for combat
by ritually shedding their armor. It is simply
too uncomfortable for battle. One of the show's
highlights is King Gama's singing introduc
tion to the audience, when he proclaims:
"Everybody says I'm such a disagreeable man!
And I can't think why!" Gama and Hildebrand
trade insults. Gama finally admits that Ida is
self-sufficient inside her women's college
where men are neither welcome nor allowed.
Even the rooster crowing there is "done by an
accomplished hen."
Hildebrand wants to storm the college but
Prince Hilarion believes he can use male charm
to woo Ida back. Hilarion, with his friends
Cyril and Florian, makes plans to sneak into
the college. Meanwhile, Gama and his sons
remain as Hildebrand's hostages until Hilarion
safely returns. We learn later that Gama is sub
jected to the worst possible torture — he is
treated so well that he is left with "nothing
whatever to grumble at." The first act ends
with a typical resounding Gilbert and Sullivan
finale, with the cast, chorus and orchestra at
full volume. The resounding chants of "the
rum-tum-tum of the military drum and the
guns that go boom, boom" are heard as Gama
is marched off to the dungeon.
Act II opens In Castle Adamant, the women's
college, where Lady Psyche Is lecturing her stu
dents on the classics and the evils of men. She
declares, "Man's a ribald — man's a rake, man
is nature's sole mistake." Hilarion. Cyril and
Florian scale the castle wall, find some robes
and decide to masquerade as women. We are
treated to several numbers that mock the
women's attempts at isolation. Florian brags:
"A Woman's college! Maddest folly going!
What can girls learn within Its walls worth
knowing?
I'll lay a crown (the Princess shall decide it)
111 teach them twice as much in half-an-hour
outside it."
Our three heroes run across Princess Ida
and apply for admission to the college, each
forswearing men and vowing never to marry
one. They are accepted. Next they run across
Lady Psyche, who happens to be Florlan's
sister. So what if it is far fetched — you didn't
come to see realism. They confide their pur
pose to Lady Psyche and question how she

came to be involved in such madness. Lady
Psyche offers a wonderful tune which con
cludes that man, "though well behaved, at best
is only a monkey shaved!"
Lady Blanche enters and recognizes
Hilarion, Cyril and Florian as imposters. For
tunately, Lady Blanche is power-hungry. Ida's
marriage to Hilarion would be Blanche's op
portunity to be first in command at the castle.
She agrees to help.
At the luncheon, Cyril gets drunk on wine,
embarrassing himself and accidentally
blowing the cover. Princess Ida is horrified and
slips into the water while running on to the
bridge. Hilarion saves her but to no avail. Ida
condemns Hilarion, Cyril and Florian to death
as spies.
Meanwhile, King Hildebrand and his army
are outside the gate threatening to "storm the
walls and level the halls in the twinkling of an
eye." Ida has vowed to fight them. How Gilbert
and Sullivan resolve the dilemma is left for the
third act and will cost you >4 if you are a stu
dent or $6.50 if you are not.
The Stanford Savoyards will be presenting
"Princess Ida" on April 24, 25 and 26 and May
1, 2 and 3 in Dinkelspiel Auditorium. It is a
lively and fun production that should not be
missed. Even if the plot seems contrived, the
music is regarded as some of Sir Arthur Sul
livan's best.
The Stanford Savoyards have been in exis
tence since 1973, keeping the works of Gilbert
and Sullivan alive at Stanford. The Savoyards
present two shows a year with an occasional
attempt at a summer show. Next year we can
look forward to "H.M.S. Pinafore" in the fall
and either "lolanthe" or "Yeoman of the
Guard" in the spring. Ticket prices are mini
mal and the Stanford Savoyards do not ask for
funds from outside sources. Other theatre
groups could learn a lesson from their efficient
use of funds.
For a student, the price of a ticket is half
what you would pay for a roller derby and still
less than a movie in Palo Alto. Besides,
"Princess Ida" is respectable entertainment.
You can bring a date. The crowd may be a bit
more civilized than you usually find at the
ASSU Sunday Flicks but the show is worth it.
See you there.

college, where Lady Psyche Is lecturing her stu
dents on the classics and the evils of men. She
declares, "Man's a ribald — man's a rake, man
is nature's sole mistake." Hilarion. Cyril and
Florian scale the castle wall, find some robes
and decide to masquerade as women. We are
treated to several numbers that mock the
women's attempts at isolation. Florian brags:
"A Woman's college! Maddest folly going!
What can girls learn within Its walls worth
knowing?
I'll lay a crown (the Princess shall decide it)
111 teach them twice as much in half-an-hour
outside it."
Our three heroes run across Princess Ida
and apply for admission to the college, each
forswearing men and vowing never to marry
one. They are accepted. Next they run across
Lady Psyche, who happens to be Florlan's
sister. So what if it is far fetched — you didn't
come to see realism. They confide their pur
pose to Lady Psyche and question how she

came to be involved in such madness. Lady
Psyche offers a wonderful tune which con
cludes that man, "though well behaved, at best
is only a monkey shaved!"
Lady Blanche enters and recognizes
Hilarion, Cyril and Florian as imposters. For
tunately, Lady Blanche is power-hungry. Ida's
marriage to Hilarion would be Blanche's op
portunity to be first in command at the castle.
She agrees to help.
At the luncheon, Cyril gets drunk on wine,
embarrassing himself and accidentally
blowing the cover. Princess Ida is horrified and
slips into the water while running on to the
bridge. Hilarion saves her but to no avail. Ida
condemns Hilarion, Cyril and Florian to death
as spies.
Meanwhile, King Hildebrand and his army
are outside the gate threatening to "storm the
walls and level the halls in the twinkling of an
eye." Ida has vowed to fight them. How Gilbert
and Sullivan resolve the dilemma is left for the
third act and will cost you >4 if you are a stu
dent or $6.50 if you are not.
The Stanford Savoyards will be presenting
"Princess Ida" on April 24, 25 and 26 and May
1, 2 and 3 in Dinkelspiel Auditorium. It is a
lively and fun production that should not be
missed. Even if the plot seems contrived, the
music is regarded as some of Sir Arthur Sul
livan's best.
The Stanford Savoyards have been in exis
tence since 1973, keeping the works of Gilbert
and Sullivan alive at Stanford. The Savoyards
present two shows a year with an occasional
attempt at a summer show. Next year we can
look forward to "H.M.S. Pinafore" in the fall
and either "lolanthe" or "Yeoman of the
Guard" in the spring. Ticket prices are mini
mal and the Stanford Savoyards do not ask for
funds from outside sources. Other theatre
groups could learn a lesson from their efficient
use of funds.
For a student, the price of a ticket is half
what you would pay for a roller derby and still
less than a movie in Palo Alto. Besides,
"Princess Ida" is respectable entertainment.
You can bring a date. The crowd may be a bit
more civilized than you usually find at the
ASSU Sunday Flicks but the show is worth it.
See you there.

For an evening of pure escapist pleasure,
everyone enjoys a great sexist musical comedy.
They haven't made a good one since "My Fair
Lady." Everybody is too sensitive today, I
suppose. If you are willing to go back a cen
tury. though, you will discover a riotous, revel
ing, sexist romp by William S. Gilbert and Sir
Arthur Sullivan entitled "Princess Ida," which,
by coincidence, the Stanford Savoyards will be
presenting at the end of this month. "Princess
Ida" forcefully demonstrates what can happen
when women try to isolate themselves from
men. All feminist studies majors should be re
quired to attend.

Gilbert and Sullivan!?! Isn't that, like, cul
ture? Man, I hate that classical Shakespeare
and opera-type stuff. Hey, never fear — so do I.
Trust me. this is different. Am I not the same
guy who writes about roller derby and ice
hockey? Would I send you to something that
the common blue-collar, beer-drinking kind of
guy couldn't understand and enjoy?
First of all. "Princess Ida" is in English and it
is an operetta. That makes it like a Broadway
show. The funniest and most important lines
are spoken rather than sung so that the audi
ence doesn't miss them. Furthermore,
"Princess Ida" features drunkenness, men in
drag and plenty of violence. You just can't beat
it for first-class entertainment.
Act I opens at King Hlldebrand's castle,
where the assembled masses await the arrival
of King Gama's ship and speculate as to
whether Princess Ida will be with him. Hil
debrand directs that rich robes, a luxurious
bed and a costly banquet be reserved for Gama
if Princess Ida is on board. If not. bread and
water In a dungeon cell will be Gama's fate.
Apparently. Princess Ida and Hlldebrand's
son Hilarion were engaged to be married 20
years earlier, at the ages of one and two,
respectively. The prophets, of course, disap
proved. since "Husband twice as old as wife,
argues ill for married life." Rumor has it that
Princess Ida has renounced men and shut her
self Inside a women's college. King Hlldebrand.

a monarch not to be messed with, has vowed
"upon his oath to trounce them both" should
King Gama arrive without Ida.
Gama arrives with only his three warrior
sons, who later in the play prepare for combat
by ritually shedding their armor. It is simply
too uncomfortable for battle. One of the show's
highlights is King Gama's singing introduc
tion to the audience, when he proclaims:
"Everybody says I'm such a disagreeable man!
And I can't think why!" Gama and Hildebrand
trade insults. Gama finally admits that Ida is
self-sufficient inside her women's college
where men are neither welcome nor allowed.
Even the rooster crowing there is "done by an
accomplished hen."
Hildebrand wants to storm the college but
Prince Hilarion believes he can use male charm
to woo Ida back. Hilarion, with his friends
Cyril and Florian, makes plans to sneak into
the college. Meanwhile, Gama and his sons
remain as Hildebrand's hostages until Hilarion
safely returns. We learn later that Gama is sub
jected to the worst possible torture — he is
treated so well that he is left with "nothing
whatever to grumble at." The first act ends
with a typical resounding Gilbert and Sullivan
finale, with the cast, chorus and orchestra at
full volume. The resounding chants of "the
rum-tum-tum of the military drum and the
guns that go boom, boom" are heard as Gama
is marched off to the dungeon.
