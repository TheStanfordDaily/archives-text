They come from across the
United States and around the
world. Young and old, they come
armed with cameras, maps and
questions, In big bunches and
small groups. They are friends,
relatives and just curious obser
vers. Who are they?
They are the thousands of
people who come to visit Stanford
each year.
While many are the family and
friends of Stanford students and
staff, others are tourists who
would like to learn about the Uni
versity and Its history. This
month, a large number of visitors
are prospective freshmen who
have recently received notices of
acceptance to Stanford and have
come to visit the campus in order
to decide which college to attend
In the fall.
"We really encourage visitors to
come to see the University. We try
to orient our tours to them. In or
der to give them a realistic view of
the campus and student life," said
Scott Chamness, assistant coord
inator of the Guide and Visitor
Service for the Public Affairs Of
fice,
The Guide and Visitor Service
and the Tresidder Union Informa
tion Center are two of the main in
formation service centers for

those unfamiliar with the
campus. The Guide and Visitor
Service operates the information
desk at the Hoover Tower platform
and the information booth at the
front of the Quad and also gives
tours of the campus twice daily.
However, Stanford has no
central visitor information center,
and as a result there are no com
pletely accurate statistics for the
number of people who actually
visit the University each year.
According to Olga Valencia-
Pardo, program coordinator for
the Guide and Visitor Service,
"approximately 85,000 people
asked questions at our informa
tion booths last year."
However, this number does not
give a fair representation of the
number of people who came to
visit Stanford in 1986, since "a lot
of visitors come on the weekends
and after hours. We only take
count of the visitors who happen
to stumble across us by taking a
tour or stopping at one of our in
formation booths,." she said. "The
actual number of visitors is prob
ably much greater."
Many visitors are easily
recognized around campus by the
cameras around their necks and
the campus maps in their hands.
The Stanford Bookstore, White
Plaza and Hoover Tower are some

of the popular visitor attractions
on campus. Visitors also take ad
vantage of the Guide and Visitor
Service's student-guided daily
tours.
"Most of the visitors on the
tours are easy to identify," said
tour guide Scott Roth.
"Tourists want to know general
information about the University,
its history, Lake Lagunita and
Hoover Tower," he said.
"High school students who want
to get admitted to Stanford are the
[easiest] to identify. They are

usually dressed nicely and are up
in the front of the tour group with
their parents. Common questions
they ask include 'What were your
SAT scores and grades in high
school?' and Do 1 have to be a var
sity athlete to get in?' They try to
impress the tour guides in order
to get accepted to the school," he
said.
On the weekends, many visitors
come from overseas, according to
Alisa Mays, night supervisor at
the Tresidder information booth.
"There seems to be mostly

European visitors on the
weekends," she said. "They will
come up to the booth and ask a
question like *So, what's Stanford
like?' and then expect a 15-
minute spiel on the campus his
tory."
Although the atmosphere and
architecture of the Stanford
campus are different from other
universities, especially many Ivy
League schools, many guests are
impressed with the school.
"Stanford's a different type of
college," said Roth. "People get en
thusiastic when they see students
studying on the grass in shorts in
April."
Visitors favorably remark on
Stanford's current spring
weather, the scenic greenery and
the people on campus.
According to Carin Anderson, a
prospective freshman from
Cambridge, Mass., "Stanford is
beautiful. The weather is pretty
amazing and the people are really
friendly."
Ajay Agarwal, a prospective
freshman visiting with his family
from Pittsburgh, Pa., agreed. "I
was admitted last week, so I came
to see what the school was like for
myself. This is one of the most
beautiful campuses I've ever seen.
Before I came, I thought Princeton
was the nicest campus, but this is
even nicer," he said.

Seeing the Stanford campus
firsthand Is helpful for many pro
spective freshmen who must
decide which college they will at
tend In the fall by the beginning of
May.
Ted Ryan, the father of a pro
spective freshman from Wood
bury, Conn., sported a tie and
jacket and shot footage with a
video camera as he toured the
campus.
"My daughter is choosing be
tween Harvard and Stanford, and
ever since we stepped off the plane
she's been going crazy and saying.
'Wow!' Coming from the East
Coast, It's hard for us to think of
this as being a college campus.
We're used to Gothic architecture
and stuffy students with thick
glasses. I think she'll probably
decide to come here." he said.
Visiting Stanford can also influ
ence many high school students
who are considering applying for
admission to Stanford In the fu
ture.
Alexandra Hearne, a high school
junior from Princeton, N.J., plans
to apply to Stanford next fall. "The
campus is breathtaking." she
said. "Just by being here, it's
definitely become my first choice.
It's a completely different environ
ment than the Ivy League
schools."

question like *So, what's Stanford
like?' and then expect a 15-
minute spiel on the campus his
tory."
Although the atmosphere and
architecture of the Stanford
campus are different from other
universities, especially many Ivy
League schools, many guests are
impressed with the school.
"Stanford's a different type of
college," said Roth. "People get en
thusiastic when they see students
studying on the grass in shorts in
April."
Visitors favorably remark on
Stanford's current spring
weather, the scenic greenery and
the people on campus.
According to Carin Anderson, a
prospective freshman from
Cambridge, Mass., "Stanford is
beautiful. The weather is pretty
amazing and the people are really
friendly."
Ajay Agarwal, a prospective
freshman visiting with his family
from Pittsburgh, Pa., agreed. "I
was admitted last week, so I came
to see what the school was like for
myself. This is one of the most
beautiful campuses I've ever seen.
Before I came, I thought Princeton
was the nicest campus, but this is
even nicer," he said.

Seeing the Stanford campus
firsthand Is helpful for many pro
spective freshmen who must
decide which college they will at
tend In the fall by the beginning of
May.
Ted Ryan, the father of a pro
spective freshman from Wood
bury, Conn., sported a tie and
jacket and shot footage with a
video camera as he toured the
campus.
"My daughter is choosing be
tween Harvard and Stanford, and
ever since we stepped off the plane
she's been going crazy and saying.
'Wow!' Coming from the East
Coast, It's hard for us to think of
this as being a college campus.
We're used to Gothic architecture
and stuffy students with thick
glasses. I think she'll probably
decide to come here." he said.
Visiting Stanford can also influ
ence many high school students
who are considering applying for
admission to Stanford In the fu
ture.
Alexandra Hearne, a high school
junior from Princeton, N.J., plans
to apply to Stanford next fall. "The
campus is breathtaking." she
said. "Just by being here, it's
definitely become my first choice.
It's a completely different environ
ment than the Ivy League
schools."

They come from across the
United States and around the
world. Young and old, they come
armed with cameras, maps and
questions, In big bunches and
small groups. They are friends,
relatives and just curious obser
vers. Who are they?
They are the thousands of
people who come to visit Stanford
each year.
While many are the family and
friends of Stanford students and
staff, others are tourists who
would like to learn about the Uni
versity and Its history. This
month, a large number of visitors
are prospective freshmen who
have recently received notices of
acceptance to Stanford and have
come to visit the campus in order
to decide which college to attend
In the fall.
"We really encourage visitors to
come to see the University. We try
to orient our tours to them. In or
der to give them a realistic view of
the campus and student life," said
Scott Chamness, assistant coord
inator of the Guide and Visitor
Service for the Public Affairs Of
fice,
The Guide and Visitor Service
and the Tresidder Union Informa
tion Center are two of the main in
formation service centers for

those unfamiliar with the
campus. The Guide and Visitor
Service operates the information
desk at the Hoover Tower platform
and the information booth at the
front of the Quad and also gives
tours of the campus twice daily.
However, Stanford has no
central visitor information center,
and as a result there are no com
pletely accurate statistics for the
number of people who actually
visit the University each year.
According to Olga Valencia-
Pardo, program coordinator for
the Guide and Visitor Service,
"approximately 85,000 people
asked questions at our informa
tion booths last year."
However, this number does not
give a fair representation of the
number of people who came to
visit Stanford in 1986, since "a lot
of visitors come on the weekends
and after hours. We only take
count of the visitors who happen
to stumble across us by taking a
tour or stopping at one of our in
formation booths,." she said. "The
actual number of visitors is prob
ably much greater."
Many visitors are easily
recognized around campus by the
cameras around their necks and
the campus maps in their hands.
The Stanford Bookstore, White
Plaza and Hoover Tower are some

of the popular visitor attractions
on campus. Visitors also take ad
vantage of the Guide and Visitor
Service's student-guided daily
tours.
"Most of the visitors on the
tours are easy to identify," said
tour guide Scott Roth.
"Tourists want to know general
information about the University,
its history, Lake Lagunita and
Hoover Tower," he said.
"High school students who want
to get admitted to Stanford are the
[easiest] to identify. They are

usually dressed nicely and are up
in the front of the tour group with
their parents. Common questions
they ask include 'What were your
SAT scores and grades in high
school?' and Do 1 have to be a var
sity athlete to get in?' They try to
impress the tour guides in order
to get accepted to the school," he
said.
On the weekends, many visitors
come from overseas, according to
Alisa Mays, night supervisor at
the Tresidder information booth.
"There seems to be mostly

European visitors on the
weekends," she said. "They will
come up to the booth and ask a
question like *So, what's Stanford
like?' and then expect a 15-
minute spiel on the campus his
tory."
