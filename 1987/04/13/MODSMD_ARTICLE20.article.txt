## Bruins would rather forget Mr. Wassenaar 
### TOM SENF Senior staff writer 
On Feb. 26, just before Stanford and
UCLA met for the first time this year in
Los Angeles, UCLA Coach Gary Adams
wanted to know which three pitchers
his Stanford counterpart, Mark
Marquess, would likely include in the
Cardinal starting rotat ion.
When the answer of Jack McDowell,
Lee Plemel and Steve Chitren came,
Adams' reaction was one of surprise.
"What about that guy Wassenaar?" he
asked. "He isn't in there?"
Now, six weeks later, Adams is prob
ably downright baffled after Rob Was

senaar held his powerful Bruins to just
two runs and four hits in eight Innings
of brilliant relief pitching yesterday that
propelled Stanford to an 8-6 win and a
one-game lead in the Pacific 10 South
ern Division.
Next to McDowell's 22, Wassenaar's 16
wins over the previous two seasons are a
Stanford high, and his 18-4 career
record entering this year was fifth-best
all-time on the Farm.
Still, the senior right-hander from
Edina, Minn, was just sixth on the Card
inal staff In innings pitched before yes
terday. He has done well when he has
been out there, compiling a 3-1 record

and a team-leading 2.55 ERA, mostly in
long relief.
Wassenaar does not, however, con
sider himself the forgotten man of the
Stanford staff. "In college baseball, you
need at least six pitchers, and I feel I can
contribute in one of those six spots."
A strong fall season made Wassenaar a
candidate for a starting job, but a couple
of shaky early outings and a high level of
competition put him in the bullpen.
"Disappointed, yeah, but not discour
aged," Wassenaar said of his assign
ment. "Everyone else pitched well."
"He's handled it very well, but I know
