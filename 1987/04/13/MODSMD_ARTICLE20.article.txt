## Bruins would rather forget Mr. Wassenaar 
### TOM SENF Senior staff writer 
On Feb. 26, just before Stanford and
UCLA met for the first time this year in
Los Angeles, UCLA Coach Gary Adams
wanted to know which three pitchers
his Stanford counterpart, Mark
Marquess, would likely include in the
Cardinal starting rotat ion.
When the answer of Jack McDowell,
Lee Plemel and Steve Chitren came,
Adams' reaction was one of surprise.
"What about that guy Wassenaar?" he
asked. "He isn't in there?"
Now, six weeks later, Adams is prob
ably downright baffled after Rob Was

senaar held his powerful Bruins to just
two runs and four hits in eight Innings
of brilliant relief pitching yesterday that
propelled Stanford to an 8-6 win and a
one-game lead in the Pacific 10 South
ern Division.
Next to McDowell's 22, Wassenaar's 16
wins over the previous two seasons are a
Stanford high, and his 18-4 career
record entering this year was fifth-best
all-time on the Farm.
Still, the senior right-hander from
Edina, Minn, was just sixth on the Card
inal staff In innings pitched before yes
terday. He has done well when he has
been out there, compiling a 3-1 record

and a team-leading 2.55 ERA, mostly in
long relief.
Wassenaar does not, however, con
sider himself the forgotten man of the
Stanford staff. "In college baseball, you
need at least six pitchers, and I feel I can
contribute in one of those six spots."
A strong fall season made Wassenaar a
candidate for a starting job, but a couple
of shaky early outings and a high level of
competition put him in the bullpen.
"Disappointed, yeah, but not discour
aged," Wassenaar said of his assign
ment. "Everyone else pitched well."
"He's handled it very well, but I know

he still wants to pitch more,"
Marquess said of Wassenaar, who
went 9-2 as the No. 3 starter on
Stanford's 1985 College World Se
ries squad. "He's worked hard,
and when he's been asked to pitch
he's responded."
He responded brilliantly yester
day, striking out eight in his eight
innings. He entered the game in
the top of the first with Stanford
trailing 3-0, the bases loaded, one
out and a 1-0 count on UCLA right
fielder Jeff Osborn.
At first, it didn't appear that
Wassenaar would fare much bet
ter than his predecessor Jim
Price. Wassenaar completed the
walk to Osborn to force in a run,
then fell behind Bobby Holley 3-0.
It looked as if the game would be
over before the capacity crowd at
Sunken Diamond would have a
chance to let its first layer of sun
tan lotion soak in, but Wassenaar

threw two strikes, then coaxed a
double-play ball out of Holley to
end the Inning.
After Torey Lovullo reached him
for a solo homer in the fifth that
brought UCLA within 8-6, Was
senaar retired 13 consecutive bat
ters before an Osborn single with
one out In the ninth ended his af
ternoon.
Known primarily for his sharp
breaking curveball, Wassenaar
crossed the Bruins up by using
his fastball more often than in his
2 2/3-inning stint on Friday.
Looking for the curve, the UCLA
hitters were often jammed by the
fastball, resulting in pop-ups and
flyballs.
"There are two things you have
to do when you pitch against
UCLA," Wassenaar said. "One, you
can't walk them or give In to them
like we did In L.A. Two, you have
to have pretty good control on
your fastball.
Because Stanford has a makeup
game with California next Monday
after a three-game series against

Arizona, Wassenaar will likely get
a start in the next week. He does
not, however, expect to move into
the regular rotation.
But Gary Adams probably still
can't understand it.
