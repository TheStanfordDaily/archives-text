# Card plays rude host to bungling Bruins
## 
### TOM SENF Senior staff writer 
UCLA brought its muscle and gaudy of
fensive statistics to Sunken Diamond this
weekend, but in the end it was pitching
and defense that decided the outcome.
Recovering from a 14-6 Bruin thrashing
on Friday, Stanford rallied to win 3-2 on
Saturday and 8-6 yesterday due to strong
pitching performances by Lee Plemel,
Steve Chitren and Rob Wassenaar and one
horrendous inning by the UCLA defense.
The Cardinal now leads the Bruins by
one game in the Pacific 10 Southern Divi
sion with a 12-4 record, 28-11 overall.
UCLA is 12-6 in the Six-Pac, 29-13-1 over
all.
In the first inning yesterday, the packed
house at Sunken Diamond (the atten
dance for the weekend was over 7,500)
must have thought it was watching a
sunny replay of Friday's blowout, as the
Bruins struck loudly, deep and often
against Stanford starter Jim Price.
Price gave up five hits and a walk to the
seven batters he faced, including homers
by Torey Lovullo and Eric Karros. With the
bases loaded and a 1-0 count on Jeff Os
born, Wassenaar was summoned out of
the Cardinal bullpen.
Wassenaar walked Osborn to make the
score 4-0, but got Bobby Holley to hit into a
6-4-3 double play to end the inning.
UCLA starter Steve Stowell did manage
to last longer than Price — but not by
much. He got through the first inning un
scathed, but both he and his teammates
fell apart in the second.
After Doug Robbins opened the inning
with a walk. Paul Carey hit a chopper that
skidded past Lovullo at second for an er
ror. Mark Machtolf grounded an RBI single
to left, then Stowell walked Brian Johnson
and Frank Carey to bring Paul Carey
across.
Ruben Amaro tied the game and chased
Stowell with a two-run single that bounced
over Karros' head at third. It was to be
Stanford's last hit of the inning, but the

excitemcnt was lar from over.
After David Esquer sacrificed, Toi Cook
was walked intentionally to reload the
bases. Ed Sprague then hit a sharp
grounder to third, which Karros fielded,
but Cook beat his throw to second.
What happened next was truly bizarre.
With a 2-1 count on Robbins, freshman
first baseman Bob Hamelin tried to sneak
in behind Sprague at first. Sprague went
back to the bag standing up, and reliever
Bill Wenrick's throw caromed off him and
into foul territory.
"If the ball gets by in this park, you're
done." Stanford Coach Mark Marquess
said. "When it gets in foul territory, we
look for two bases."
Amaro scored from third easily, and
when the 6-foot-1. 220-pound Hamelin
didn't exactly chase the ball as if it were a
jelly doughnut. Third Base Coach Dean
Stotz waved Cook home.
"I didn't think I'd be able to score be
cause I didn't think the ball had gotten
that far away," Cook said. "But when I
came around third, he was still chasing
after it or whatever he was doing."
"Cook didn't run hard to me at third, but
the guy went after it so poorly I sent him
anyway," Stotz said. "It was him (Hamelin)
throwing and Cook running, and he
launched it."
Launch it he did, well over catcher Billy
Haselman's head. As Wenrick ran the ball
down near the UCLA on-deck circle,
Sprague rounded third and took off for the
plate. Whether he would have made it or
not will never be known, because Wen
rick's throw sailed just as far over Hasel
man and into a delirious throng of players
in the Cardinal dugout.
On the play: three runs and three errors.
In the inning: eight runs, two hits and
four errors.
Wassenaar and Wenrick kept things
pretty quiet the rest of the way. After allow
ing a run in the third and another in the
fifth on a Lovullo homer, Wassenaar did
not allow another baserunner un
til a one-out Osborn single In the
ninth.
Chitren then came on to strike
out both Holley and Robbie Kat
zaroff to record his ninth save of
the year.
Saturday's game was simply a
classic. Both Plemel and UCLA's
Randy Hennis were able to escape
numerous jams (UCLA left 14 men
on base: Stanford stranded
seven), but it was Sprague's two
out, two-run double off reliever
David Dale in the seventh that
decided it.
Amaro's leadoff homer in the
first gave the Cardinal a 1-0 edge,
but the Bruins got two in the third
to take the lead. While his
teammates struggled against Hen
nis, Plemel was able to keep the
fastball-hitting Bruins at bay with
his off-speed pitches — but just
barely.
The junior right-hander allowed
eight hits and five walks in his 6
2/3 innings, but only two runs
crossed the plate. "Lee kept them
off stride," Marquess said. "They
like to sit on the fastball, and he's
a breaking ball pitcher. He kept
them off balance."
Plemel's curves and sliders also
made his fastball more effective.
"He got them frustrated,"
Marquess said. "He got them to
start looking for the breaking ball,
then got the fastball by them.
When you do that, it doesn't mat
ter how hard you throw, it looks
like 100 miles per hour."
After Chitren bailed Plemel out
with a bases-loaded strikeout of
Haselman in the seventh, the
Cardinal finally cashed in an op
portunity.
A leadoff walk to Frank Carey
and a two-out free pass to Cook
brought Sprague up and brought
off-speed specialist Dale out of the
UCLA bullpen.
"They had beaten me on sliders
the last two days." said Sprague,
who was 0-for-8 in the series at
that point.
The sliders kept coming, but
this time, after pulling one just
foul on the previous pitch,
Sprague drilled an inside slider
into left-center that scored Carey
and Cook easily.
"I was pumped up, but 1 didn't
want to jump out and swing at a

ball In the dirt." Sprague said. "He
had thrown so many (sliders) that
I thought he'd keep throwing
them, and he happened to get one
on the Inside half."
Not surprisingly, the Bruins did
not go quietly. In the ninth, a
Hamelln single and a walk to Kat
zaroff loaded the bases with two
outs for Steve Hlsey. who entered
the weekend tied for the Slx-Pac
RBI lead.
Chltren got ahead of Hlsey, then
got the Bruin slugger to hit into a
fielder's choice on a 2-2 pitch to
end the game. "I went to my slider
more (Saturday)." said Chltren,
who usually goes with his fastball
out of the bullpen. "They seemed
to pull off It and tried to jerk every
thing."
The Bruins did jerk everything
on Friday, pounding the Cardinal
for 17 hits, including four
homers, in their 14-6 win.
The primary victim of the UCLA
onslaught was Stanford ace Jack
McDowell, who gave up 10 hits
and eight runs in just 3 1/3 In
nings. McDowell did not pitch as
badly as his numbers would indi
cate, but the Bruins found a hole
on his good pitches and found the
fence on his mistakes.
Holley paced UCLA with a 5-for
-6 day that included a homer and
five runs scored. "I had a feeling it
was going to be my day,"he said.
"Even on the plane I was thinking
about what I was going to do to
McDowell."
This was a pretty brash state
ment for a guy who entered the
game hitting .217, but Holley's
humility soon returned. "It's rare I
get three hits," he said. "Five is In
credible."
UCLA led just 2-1 after three in
nings, but homers by Hamelln
and Hlsey and a three-run double
by Lovullo keyed a six-run fourth.
Stanford never got closer than five
the rest of the way.
Card notes
For the weekend. Lovullo went 6-
for-11 with three homers and eight
RBIs. He now has 18 roundtrippers for
the season, tops in the conference.
Amaro was the Cardinal hitting
star. The senior leftfielder went 5-for
-13. including homers on both Friday
and Saturday, his third and fourth of
the season. He would have had a pair
on Saturday, but UCLA center fielder
Charlie Fiacco robbed him In the
seventh before Sprague's heroics.
UCLA brought its muscle and gaudy of
fensive statistics to Sunken Diamond this

fastball-hitting Bruins at bay with
his off-speed pitches — but just
barely.
The junior right-hander allowed
eight hits and five walks in his 6
2/3 innings, but only two runs
crossed the plate. "Lee kept them
off stride," Marquess said. "They
like to sit on the fastball, and he's
a breaking ball pitcher. He kept
them off balance."
Plemel's curves and sliders also
made his fastball more effective.
"He got them frustrated,"
Marquess said. "He got them to
start looking for the breaking ball,
then got the fastball by them.
When you do that, it doesn't mat
ter how hard you throw, it looks
like 100 miles per hour."
After Chitren bailed Plemel out
with a bases-loaded strikeout of
Haselman in the seventh, the
Cardinal finally cashed in an op
portunity.
A leadoff walk to Frank Carey
and a two-out free pass to Cook
brought Sprague up and brought
off-speed specialist Dale out of the
UCLA bullpen.
"They had beaten me on sliders
the last two days." said Sprague,
who was 0-for-8 in the series at
that point.
The sliders kept coming, but
this time, after pulling one just
foul on the previous pitch,
Sprague drilled an inside slider
into left-center that scored Carey
and Cook easily.
"I was pumped up, but 1 didn't
want to jump out and swing at a

ball In the dirt." Sprague said. "He
had thrown so many (sliders) that
I thought he'd keep throwing
them, and he happened to get one
on the Inside half."
Not surprisingly, the Bruins did
not go quietly. In the ninth, a
Hamelln single and a walk to Kat
zaroff loaded the bases with two
outs for Steve Hlsey. who entered
the weekend tied for the Slx-Pac
RBI lead.
Chltren got ahead of Hlsey, then
got the Bruin slugger to hit into a
fielder's choice on a 2-2 pitch to
end the game. "I went to my slider
more (Saturday)." said Chltren,
who usually goes with his fastball
out of the bullpen. "They seemed
to pull off It and tried to jerk every
thing."
The Bruins did jerk everything
on Friday, pounding the Cardinal
for 17 hits, including four
homers, in their 14-6 win.
The primary victim of the UCLA
onslaught was Stanford ace Jack
McDowell, who gave up 10 hits
and eight runs in just 3 1/3 In
nings. McDowell did not pitch as
badly as his numbers would indi
cate, but the Bruins found a hole
on his good pitches and found the
fence on his mistakes.
Holley paced UCLA with a 5-for
-6 day that included a homer and
five runs scored. "I had a feeling it
was going to be my day,"he said.
"Even on the plane I was thinking
about what I was going to do to
McDowell."
This was a pretty brash state
ment for a guy who entered the
game hitting .217, but Holley's
humility soon returned. "It's rare I
get three hits," he said. "Five is In
credible."
UCLA led just 2-1 after three in
nings, but homers by Hamelln
and Hlsey and a three-run double
by Lovullo keyed a six-run fourth.
Stanford never got closer than five
the rest of the way.
Card notes
For the weekend. Lovullo went 6-
for-11 with three homers and eight
RBIs. He now has 18 roundtrippers for
the season, tops in the conference.
Amaro was the Cardinal hitting
star. The senior leftfielder went 5-for
-13. including homers on both Friday
and Saturday, his third and fourth of
the season. He would have had a pair
on Saturday, but UCLA center fielder
Charlie Fiacco robbed him In the
seventh before Sprague's heroics.
UCLA brought its muscle and gaudy of
fensive statistics to Sunken Diamond this
weekend, but in the end it was pitching
and defense that decided the outcome.
Recovering from a 14-6 Bruin thrashing
on Friday, Stanford rallied to win 3-2 on
Saturday and 8-6 yesterday due to strong
pitching performances by Lee Plemel,
Steve Chitren and Rob Wassenaar and one
horrendous inning by the UCLA defense.
The Cardinal now leads the Bruins by
one game in the Pacific 10 Southern Divi
sion with a 12-4 record, 28-11 overall.
UCLA is 12-6 in the Six-Pac, 29-13-1 over
all.
In the first inning yesterday, the packed
house at Sunken Diamond (the atten
dance for the weekend was over 7,500)
must have thought it was watching a
sunny replay of Friday's blowout, as the
Bruins struck loudly, deep and often
against Stanford starter Jim Price.
Price gave up five hits and a walk to the
seven batters he faced, including homers
by Torey Lovullo and Eric Karros. With the
bases loaded and a 1-0 count on Jeff Os
born, Wassenaar was summoned out of
the Cardinal bullpen.
Wassenaar walked Osborn to make the
score 4-0, but got Bobby Holley to hit into a
6-4-3 double play to end the inning.
UCLA starter Steve Stowell did manage
to last longer than Price — but not by
much. He got through the first inning un
scathed, but both he and his teammates
fell apart in the second.
After Doug Robbins opened the inning
with a walk. Paul Carey hit a chopper that
skidded past Lovullo at second for an er
ror. Mark Machtolf grounded an RBI single
to left, then Stowell walked Brian Johnson
and Frank Carey to bring Paul Carey
across.
Ruben Amaro tied the game and chased
Stowell with a two-run single that bounced
over Karros' head at third. It was to be
Stanford's last hit of the inning, but the

excitemcnt was lar from over.
After David Esquer sacrificed, Toi Cook
was walked intentionally to reload the
bases. Ed Sprague then hit a sharp
grounder to third, which Karros fielded,
but Cook beat his throw to second.
What happened next was truly bizarre.
With a 2-1 count on Robbins, freshman
first baseman Bob Hamelin tried to sneak
in behind Sprague at first. Sprague went
back to the bag standing up, and reliever
Bill Wenrick's throw caromed off him and
into foul territory.
"If the ball gets by in this park, you're
done." Stanford Coach Mark Marquess
said. "When it gets in foul territory, we
look for two bases."
Amaro scored from third easily, and
when the 6-foot-1. 220-pound Hamelin
didn't exactly chase the ball as if it were a
jelly doughnut. Third Base Coach Dean
Stotz waved Cook home.
"I didn't think I'd be able to score be
cause I didn't think the ball had gotten
that far away," Cook said. "But when I
came around third, he was still chasing
after it or whatever he was doing."
"Cook didn't run hard to me at third, but
the guy went after it so poorly I sent him
anyway," Stotz said. "It was him (Hamelin)
throwing and Cook running, and he
launched it."
Launch it he did, well over catcher Billy
Haselman's head. As Wenrick ran the ball
down near the UCLA on-deck circle,
Sprague rounded third and took off for the
plate. Whether he would have made it or
not will never be known, because Wen
rick's throw sailed just as far over Hasel
man and into a delirious throng of players
in the Cardinal dugout.
On the play: three runs and three errors.
In the inning: eight runs, two hits and
four errors.
Wassenaar and Wenrick kept things
pretty quiet the rest of the way. After allow
ing a run in the third and another in the
fifth on a Lovullo homer, Wassenaar did
not allow another baserunner un
til a one-out Osborn single In the
ninth.
Chitren then came on to strike
out both Holley and Robbie Kat
zaroff to record his ninth save of
the year.
Saturday's game was simply a
classic. Both Plemel and UCLA's
Randy Hennis were able to escape
numerous jams (UCLA left 14 men
on base: Stanford stranded
seven), but it was Sprague's two
out, two-run double off reliever
David Dale in the seventh that
decided it.
Amaro's leadoff homer in the
first gave the Cardinal a 1-0 edge,
but the Bruins got two in the third
to take the lead. While his
teammates struggled against Hen
nis, Plemel was able to keep the
fastball-hitting Bruins at bay with
his off-speed pitches — but just
barely.
The junior right-hander allowed
eight hits and five walks in his 6
