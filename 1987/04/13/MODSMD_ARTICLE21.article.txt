# Card plays rude host to bungling Bruins
## 
### TOM SENF Senior staff writer 
UCLA brought its muscle and gaudy of
fensive statistics to Sunken Diamond this
weekend, but in the end it was pitching
and defense that decided the outcome.
Recovering from a 14-6 Bruin thrashing
on Friday, Stanford rallied to win 3-2 on
Saturday and 8-6 yesterday due to strong
pitching performances by Lee Plemel,
Steve Chitren and Rob Wassenaar and one
horrendous inning by the UCLA defense.
The Cardinal now leads the Bruins by
one game in the Pacific 10 Southern Divi
sion with a 12-4 record, 28-11 overall.
UCLA is 12-6 in the Six-Pac, 29-13-1 over
all.
In the first inning yesterday, the packed
house at Sunken Diamond (the atten
dance for the weekend was over 7,500)
must have thought it was watching a
sunny replay of Friday's blowout, as the
Bruins struck loudly, deep and often
against Stanford starter Jim Price.
Price gave up five hits and a walk to the
seven batters he faced, including homers
by Torey Lovullo and Eric Karros. With the
bases loaded and a 1-0 count on Jeff Os
born, Wassenaar was summoned out of
the Cardinal bullpen.
Wassenaar walked Osborn to make the
score 4-0, but got Bobby Holley to hit into a
6-4-3 double play to end the inning.
UCLA starter Steve Stowell did manage
to last longer than Price â€” but not by
much. He got through the first inning un
scathed, but both he and his teammates
fell apart in the second.
After Doug Robbins opened the inning
with a walk. Paul Carey hit a chopper that
skidded past Lovullo at second for an er
ror. Mark Machtolf grounded an RBI single
to left, then Stowell walked Brian Johnson
and Frank Carey to bring Paul Carey
across.
Ruben Amaro tied the game and chased
Stowell with a two-run single that bounced
over Karros' head at third. It was to be
Stanford's last hit of the inning, but the

excitemcnt was lar from over.
After David Esquer sacrificed, Toi Cook
was walked intentionally to reload the
bases. Ed Sprague then hit a sharp
grounder to third, which Karros fielded,
but Cook beat his throw to second.
What happened next was truly bizarre.
With a 2-1 count on Robbins, freshman
first baseman Bob Hamelin tried to sneak
in behind Sprague at first. Sprague went
back to the bag standing up, and reliever
Bill Wenrick's throw caromed off him and
into foul territory.
"If the ball gets by in this park, you're
done." Stanford Coach Mark Marquess
said. "When it gets in foul territory, we
look for two bases."
Amaro scored from third easily, and
when the 6-foot-1. 220-pound Hamelin
didn't exactly chase the ball as if it were a
jelly doughnut. Third Base Coach Dean
Stotz waved Cook home.
"I didn't think I'd be able to score be
cause I didn't think the ball had gotten
that far away," Cook said. "But when I
came around third, he was still chasing
after it or whatever he was doing."
"Cook didn't run hard to me at third, but
the guy went after it so poorly I sent him
anyway," Stotz said. "It was him (Hamelin)
throwing and Cook running, and he
launched it."
Launch it he did, well over catcher Billy
Haselman's head. As Wenrick ran the ball
down near the UCLA on-deck circle,
Sprague rounded third and took off for the
plate. Whether he would have made it or
not will never be known, because Wen
rick's throw sailed just as far over Hasel
man and into a delirious throng of players
in the Cardinal dugout.
On the play: three runs and three errors.
In the inning: eight runs, two hits and
four errors.
Wassenaar and Wenrick kept things
pretty quiet the rest of the way. After allow
ing a run in the third and another in the
fifth on a Lovullo homer, Wassenaar did
