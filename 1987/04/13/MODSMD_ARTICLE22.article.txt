# A 						trio of Card runners steal their own show

### ERIK STEN Editorial staff 
Saturday at the Stanford Track Classic, Olympic
athletes were Stanford Coach Brooks Johnson's big
drawing cards. In return for skipping the Stanford-
UCLA baseball game, Brooks provided the fans with
Jackie Joyner-Kersey, Valerie Brisco-Hooks and
Andre Phillips, three of the world's finest athletes.
Impressive they were. But by the time the meet was
finished, a trio of Cardinal distance runners had
stolen the show.
While the world-class competitors easily outdis
tanced the collegiate field and spoke of what's to
come for them this season, the real excitement was
provided by Marc Olesen, Christian Skoog and Carol
Gray.
Olesen won the 5,000 meters and Skoog the 800.
Gray, a freshman, finished second in a nail-biter of a
3.000.
Along with teammates Charles Alexander and
Marc Mastalir, Olesen had planned to wage an attack
on the NCAA 5.000 meter qualifying time of 13:57.
Each of the runners was to take a turn leading the
race; if all went well, they would push each other to
qualifying marks. But a hot day and a slow first five
changed those plans, and Olesen found himself
alone in front with the qualifying standard quickly
slipping away.
Breathing down his neck were two Notre Dame
runners and Tom Wysocki, another national-caliber
athlete imported for the meet. Olesen decided simply
to go for the win, even though he "figured I wouldn't
have to lead the whole thing.''
No one else, however, was willing to take the lead.
Until the race's ninth lap. when a Notre Dame runner
slipped by him, the race had been all Olesen's. From

there on out it was a pack of four. When the bell
sounded for the final lap. it looked like a race for the
taking — until the pack rounded the first curve.
With 300 to go Olesen let loose his kick and opened
up a lead. Notre Dame's Dan Garrett came hard, but
Olesen hung on to win by % QQQrsUt£ej"tfh.<?l a second
at 14:10.50. To pull off the victory, the junior ran his
last 300 in 43 seconds.
After being injured all last year and much of his
sophomore season, it was the redshirt junior's first
track race in almost two years. Consequently, the
victory was sweet.
"I wasn't nervous, but I did realize it was my first
race in two years," Olesen said. "Afterwards I was
really happy. It's good to see that I can still do it."
In the men's 800, Skoog was — in a word — un
beatable. As the pack jostled for position around the
first corner, the junior worked himself into the lead,
a spot he wouldn't relinquish for the rest of the race.
While a tightly grouped pack tried in vain to get by
him, Skoog surged and fought his way to a 1:49.41
victory. The time was just over a second off the
1:48.1 needed to qualify for NCAA championships.
Trimming that second off will be Skoog's next chal
lenge.
For Gray the task will be similar. The freshman All-
America cross country selection finished the 3,000
in 9:24.56, a scant .56 of a second off the NCAA stan
dard of 9:24.
After taking command of the race and leading the
first six-and-a-half laps, Gray was able to escape
everyone but Lousiana State's Lisa Reed. The more
experienced Reed seemed to be waiting on Gray and
with a lap to go she made her move. The kick was too

much for the Cardinal runner, but her fast time was
encouraging.
In other events, Cardinal junior Lisa Bernhagen
set a new school outdoor record in the high jump at
6-foot-2. Washington's Vickie Borsheim also jumped
6-2, but Bernhagen was awarded the victory on
misses. Absent from the competition was LSU's Kim

Carter, the nation's third-ranked jumper, who unex
pectedly scratched from the event.
Other winners for Stanford were the men's sprint
relay team, which won in 41.13; and sophomore
Glenn Schneider, who won the day's last event, the
discus, with a throw of 186-9. Schneider's best toss
came as the last in an impressive series of four in
which he improved with every try. The shortest effort
of the bunch was 183 feet, a mark that would have
been good for second.
In the women's shot put, former Stanford athlete
Pam Dukes, one of the nation's premier throwers,
took control of the field and won with a toss of 57-3.
