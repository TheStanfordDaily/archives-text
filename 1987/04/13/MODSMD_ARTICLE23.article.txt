# Netters sweep Arizona schools
## 
### JON WEISMAN Staff writer 
Most every kid growing up in
the 1970s memorized the words to
the preamble of the Constitution
by watching "Schoolhouse Rock."
Those same kids, however, might
have great difficulty reciting the
words of any of the Constitution's
articles.
Similarly, the Stanford men's
tennis team has mastered the
preamble to what Stanford Coach
Dick Gould is calling "Tennis
Week at Stanford." It remains to
be seen how well the Cardinal does
against Articles I. II and 111.
Stanford got ready for this
week's matches against the na
tion's top three teams — USC.
Long Beach State and UCLA — by
recording a couple of 7-2 victories
against No. 15 Arizona State and
Arizona on Friday and Saturday.
"As long as we stay healthy. I'm
excited about (this week).' Gould
said. "We have a great opportunity
now. . . . It's a cliche, but we have
to play one match at a time.
"Long Beach State beat the heck
out of us the end of last year."
Gould continued. "I don't think
they've lost to anyone other than
USC. and they played them close
both matches, and I'm really
looking forward to playing them.
California also swept the
Arizona schools this weekend to

remain tied with the Cardinal for
third place in the Paeiflc-10
Southern Division standings at 4-
3. behind the first-place Trojans
and second-place UCLA.
Stanford revamped its slumping
doubles lineup and the combina
tions produced five wins in six
matches over the weekend.
Scott Moody and Patrick
McEnroe, who form the 45th
ranked doubles team in the
country but had not played to
gether since early in the season,
swept both their matches at No. 1
this weekend. The duo. now 5-1 in
1987, defeated ASU's Jeff Wood
and Mike Molten, 6-4, 7-6. and
Arizona's lan Aler and Benji
Papcll, 6-4. 6-4 Saturday.
The other revision teamed Mark
Jacobson and Jeff Tarango, who
had lost the only previous match
they had played together. After
losing a close one to ASU's Andy
Roediger and Ken Kupcrstein, 6-
3. 6-7, 6-4. Jacobson and Tarango
got on the winning side with a 6-
4. 6-4 win over the Arizona's Jose
Wasserfrier and John Schmitt.
Jeff Cathrall and Eric Peus.
ranked 43rd, raised their record
this year to 15-5 at the No. 3
doubles spot. Despite being bro
ken more than once when serving
for the match, they now have a
three-match win streak after wins
over the Sun Devils' Jeff Karp and
Grant Adams. 6-3. 7-6, and the

Wildcats' Paul Landry and Rob
Horwood, 6-4, 7-5.
"I think our doubles did a good
job — that's good to see," Gould
said. "I thought Mark Jacobson
played great doubles both days.
Third doubles, we were serving for
the match twice and lost serve,
but came back to win, which was
good both days."
Against ASU, the Cardinal won
five of six singles matches to
ensure themselves of the victory
before doubles began. But against
Arizona. Stanford lost twice in
singles, leaving victory in doubt.
The doubt only increased when
the Cardinal started off slowly In
doubles.
Tarango. McEnroe, and Barry
Richards all posted two-set vic
tories for Stanford Saturday.
Tarango (ranked 23rd) knocked
off Aler at No. 1. 6-4. 6-1, McEnroe
(ranked 17th) came back from a 1-
4 deficit to Schmitt in the first set
of No. 2 singles to win. 7-6, 6-4,
and Richards raised his record to
12-5 with a 6-1. 6-3 win over Jose
Rojas at No. 6.
However. Moody, who had won
eight of his last nine matches, fell
to Landry at No. 5, 6-4, 6-3, and
Cathrall, who had won eight of 10.

No. 3 but lost the match. 3-6. 6-4.
