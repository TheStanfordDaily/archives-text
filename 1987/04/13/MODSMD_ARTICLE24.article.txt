# Card women avenge loss to Wildcats
## 
### KEN STEVENS Senior staff writer 
With the NCAA championships
just a month away, the Stanford
women's tennis team got some
good news on and off of the court
yesterday.
Leigh Anne Eldredge's return to
the Cardinal singles lineup was a
resounding success as the senior
made quick work of Arizona's Jo
Jo Grummel to help lead Stanford
to an 8-1 victory over the visiting
Wildcats.
The victory raised the Cardinal's
overall record to 14-3 and avenged
a 5-4 loss to the Wildcats on Feb.
21 in Tucson. Arizona dropped to
12-11.
After the match. Stanford
Coach Frank Brennan announced

that Eleni Rossides — who has
not played since she suffered
stress-fracture injuries in both
legs over a year ago — might play
doubles in the Cardinal's 1:30
p.m. match against Arizona State
today at the Stanford Tennis
Stadium.
"We may try her in some doubles
[today]," Brennan said of
Rossides, who hit for about an
hour while her teammates were
taking care of Arizona.
Eldredge, also a victim of a
stress-fracture injury, had played
doubles in the Cardinal's last five
matches, but yesterday was her
first singles action of the season.
After freshman Lisa Green won
her No. 3 singles match when
Arizona's Betsy Somerville — ailed
by chicken pox — had to default at
2-2 in the first set. Eldredge put

Stanford ahead 2-0 with a 6-1, 6-0
pounding of Grummel in the No. 6
singles.
Brennan called Eldredge's per
formance "very encouraging. She
didn't play anybody great, but she
blew her off the court." Brennan
Indicated that he might move
Eldredge up on the ladder for
today's match.
Stephanie Savides had an
equally easy time with a much
tougher opponent in the No. 2
singles. Sue Russo, who often
plays No. 1 for the Wildcats,
couldn't match Savides' wealth of
passing shots and drop shots. The
Stanford senior breezed to a 6-1,
6-2 victory.
"Stephanie's been doing really
well," Brennan said. "It's nice to
have her In there. She's really

solidifying that position."
After junior Kay Tittle recorded
a 6-3. 6-2 win at No. 4, Patty Fen
dick sealed the match with a 6-2,
6-4 victory over the Wildcats'
Chris Seiffert on court one. Seif
fert pressed Fendick in the second
set. and Fendick was not at her
best, but the Cardinal senior still
had enough to remain undefeated
in 1987.
"I thought Patty played pretty
well; she didn't play great," Bren
nan said. "She only got four
standing ovations, instead of the
usual nine."
Sophomore Cindy Buchsbaum,
playing instead of freshman
Valerie Wilson for the first time
this season, completed the Stan
ford singles sweep with a 7-6, 6-3
win against Jackie Ranger in the
No. 5 singles.
Brennan said that Buchsbaum
will remain in the lineup in place
of Wilson. "Cindy's been hot and
playing really well." he said.
"Valerie has had some pretty
tough losses there (at the bottom
of the ladder) — some pretty over
whelming losses."
Without the services of Somer
ville, Arizona was forced to default
the No. 1 doubles match, giving
Fendick and Savides the rest of
the afternoon off.
Tittle and Green beat Grummel
and Ranger 6-2, 6-4 at No. 3, but
the Wildcats avoided the shutout
when Russo and Buchholz rallied
for a 4-6, 7-6, 7-6 win in the No. 2
doubles match against Eldredge
and Buchsbaum.
Brennan said after the match
that he had hoped that Eldredge
would not have to go to a third set
in doubles. "In retrospect, I
should have bagged the third set,"
he said.
Having already beaten ASU 9-0
at Tempe. the Cardinal's match
today against the Sun Devils will
likely be a tuneup for next
weekend's matches at UCLA and
USC. Stanford will be without
junior Carl Hagey for the Los An
geles road trip.
Hagey is still wearing a brace on
her left knee, which she strained
against USC last weekend. "She's
not going to be able to start hit
ting until next weekend," Bren
nan said. "She's not going to be
able to play against USC and
UCLA."

Chris Seiffert on court one. Seif
fert pressed Fendick in the second
set. and Fendick was not at her
best, but the Cardinal senior still
had enough to remain undefeated
in 1987.
"I thought Patty played pretty
well; she didn't play great," Bren
nan said. "She only got four
standing ovations, instead of the
usual nine."
Sophomore Cindy Buchsbaum,
playing instead of freshman
Valerie Wilson for the first time
this season, completed the Stan
ford singles sweep with a 7-6, 6-3
win against Jackie Ranger in the
No. 5 singles.
Brennan said that Buchsbaum
will remain in the lineup in place
of Wilson. "Cindy's been hot and
playing really well." he said.
"Valerie has had some pretty
tough losses there (at the bottom
of the ladder) — some pretty over
whelming losses."
Without the services of Somer
ville, Arizona was forced to default
the No. 1 doubles match, giving
Fendick and Savides the rest of
the afternoon off.
Tittle and Green beat Grummel
and Ranger 6-2, 6-4 at No. 3, but
the Wildcats avoided the shutout
when Russo and Buchholz rallied
for a 4-6, 7-6, 7-6 win in the No. 2
doubles match against Eldredge
and Buchsbaum.
Brennan said after the match
that he had hoped that Eldredge
would not have to go to a third set
in doubles. "In retrospect, I
should have bagged the third set,"
he said.
Having already beaten ASU 9-0
at Tempe. the Cardinal's match
today against the Sun Devils will
likely be a tuneup for next
weekend's matches at UCLA and
USC. Stanford will be without
junior Carl Hagey for the Los An
geles road trip.
Hagey is still wearing a brace on
her left knee, which she strained
against USC last weekend. "She's
not going to be able to start hit
ting until next weekend," Bren
nan said. "She's not going to be
able to play against USC and
UCLA."
