All good things must come to an end.
Ending a season marked by a record-high
postseason seeding and the besting of a half-dozen
school standards, the Stanford women's gymnastics
team finished fourth Saturday at the West Regional
In Seattle, Wash., with a year-high away meet score
of 183.80. The Cardinal narrowly missed a berth to
the NCAA championships In Salt Lake City, Utah, on
April 24-25.
UCLA, the top seed In the competition, captured
the regional title with an Impressive 190.75 team
score, a mark high enough to seed the squad first In
the national finals. Host Washington placed second
with 187.35, followed by Oregon State at 186.35.
These three teams will join Arizona and Arizona
State to comprise the Pacific 10 Conference's contin
gent at the finals.
Fullerton State and California finished behind
Stanford, with scores of 180.65 and 178.15.
"If we had just a smidge of luck, we would have
made it in (to the finals)," Stanford Coach Homer
Sardlna said. "We finished 15th, and they take 12
teams. We were just a hair away."
Freshman Dina Amoroso also just missed qualify
ing for nationals. Her 14th-place finish in the all
around at 36.55 left her with a 36.9 national qualify
ing score, shy of what she needed to gain an individ
ual berth.
"Dina had an off night. She should have been able
to qualify with a good night," Sardlna added.
A good night is exactly what senior Nanci
Goldsmith enjoyed Saturday. "Nanci had a great
meet," the coach said. "She was our leading scorer
and ninth In the all-around with 37.1.
"Nanci had a great performance. She was consis
tent throughout the whole meet. She had two breaks
on bars but hit floor well, vaulted well and had a good
beam routine. It was a good way to see her go out,"
Sardlna added.
Teammate Alison McGann had a good meet as well.
The junior co-captain placed 11th In the all-around
with 36.8 points, and finished seventh on balance
beam with a 9.5.
Senior Cindy Boyd and freshman Becky Ashton
also put in good performances at the regionals.
"Cindy did a good job and got a 9.3 on beam," Sar
dlna noted. "Becky got a 9.15 on floor and 9.35 on
beam."
There were some problematic performances,
though. "Cheryl Doo had kind of an off night. She
did OK on floor and vaulted well, but she had a little
problem on bars and floor.
"Susan Banta missed bars," Sardlna added. "This
put a lot of pressure on everyone else, and we ended
up scoring 45.3."
Nonetheless. Sardlna Is hardly disappointed with
the Cardinal gymnasts. "I am happy because they
represented us really well. The Stanford community
should be proud of our girls.
