# Southerners crush Card
## 
### ALICIA KENT Staff writer 
It was a no-wln situation for the Stan
ford men's volleyball team this weekend.
Literally.
The Cardinal was crushed by No. 1 UCLA
Friday night at Maples Pavilion, 15-8, 15-
9, 15-9 and again on Saturday by No. 3
USC, 15-13, 15-10, 15-5.
Although Stanford was clearly the un
derdog against the UCLA Bruins, who are
undefeated In league play with a 16-0
Western Intercollegiate Volleyball Associa
tion record, the Cardinal provided a much
better performance than its previous
February 18 loss to the Bruins.
"Stanford has improved a lot since our
first meeting," UCLA Coach A 1 Scates said.
Scates coached Stanford Coach Fred
Sturm to three NCAA championships In
1972, '75 and '76. "Sturm has done a fine
job this season."
The powerful serving and hitting of the
Bruins, in addition to their wall of blockers
and depth of players, forced Sturm to try
different strategies throughout the even
ing. Seniors Steve Modory and Robert
Peterson were brought in at 7-13 in the
first game with hopes of confusing the
powerful UCLA offense. Peterson, a 6-6
blocker, scored one point with Scott
Fortune serving, but the Bruins barely felt
the shift in players.
The key strategy change came from the
6-foot junior Brad Nelson, who entered the
second game with Stanford losing 1-9.
Blocking with Dan Hanan and John
McDermott to score the next point, Nelson
established himself not only as a blocker,
but also provided four digs and led the
„team with a .667 hitting percentage.
Stanford Asst. Coach Ruben Nieves was
Impressed by Nelson's ability to come off
the bench in the middle of the match and
provide such a spark for the team. "Brad
responded really well. He really gave the
team a lift," Nieves said. "We learned some
thing about Brad tonight."
In addition to player substitutions, the
Cardinal tried to change its blocking ap

proach to fight off All-Amerlcan Asbjorn
Volstad. a swing hitter from Forde. Nor
way; senior Jeff Williams: and junior Don
Dendlnger. "We tried more of a man-to
man type blocking, which Is a different ap
proach than UCLA is used to." Nieves said.
"But we weren't as effective as we had
hoped."
According to Sturm, the Bruins' serving
hurt Stanford's ability to pass well, which
led to predictability in the Cardinal's hit
ting. "UCLA is the kind of team that when
they get going with their serving, you get
forced to pass into their block," Sturm
said.
Hoping for a possible win on Saturday
that would clinch the regional bid for Stan
ford, the Cardinal ended the evening in
frustration, although it seemed at the start
of the match that Stanford was the
stronger team. "We started off real slow,"
said Adam Johnson, an outside hitter for
the Trojans. "Mentally we were not really in
to the game." Johnson, the 1986 Player of
the Year, led both teams with 18 kills and
was the Cardinal's center of concern.
At the start of the match, Stanford
jumped ahead with a 3-0 lead, capitalizing
on the Trojans hitting errors. The Cardinal
went on to build up a 12-5 score, but
quickly fell apart when Johnson reached
the serving position. "Losing that first
game hurt us." said Peterson, who played
in two of the three games. "To tell you the
truth, I can't say what happened out there.
It's a tough thing to assess."
USC Coach Bob Yoder attributed his
team's shocking comeback to the Trojan's
blocking and digging. "As soon as we put
our defense together, we were able to come
up with a win," said Yoder, whose brother
Dave Yoder posted a match-high 19 digs.
After the Trojan comeback in the first
game, frustration took over on the Card
inal side of the net. In the second and third
games, USC took control of the scoreboard
and never allowed Stanford to threaten.
"The guys were pretty frustrated out
there," said Modory, who started In the
second game.
