NEW YORK (AP) — Dale Murphy hit two home runs
and drove in five runs as the Atlanta Braves routed
the New York Mets 12-4 yesterday in a game marked
by a fly ball that hit a bird and fell for a double to set
up Murphy's first homer.
The Braves were leading 2-1 in the third inning
when Dion James hit a routine fly to left. But as
leftfielder Kevin Mcßeynolds moved into position,
the ball struck a pigeon and James went into second
as both the bird and ball dropped in short left. The
bird died.
