# SIG announces D.C. fellows
## 
### JEFF SEINFELD Staff writer 
Four Stanford students — Juniors David Kang and
Stephen Churchill and seniors Frederick Yang and
Ron Ratcliffe — will receive a guaranteed position in
Washington, D.C. this summer and a *1.250 stipend
as recipients of the 1987 Stanford-in-Government
(SIG) Fellowships.
In addition, SiG awarded the new Select Intern
ship to senior Margaret Rhinelander, who will
receive a summer position at the Washington office
of Amnesty International.
The fellowship program achieved "unparalleled
success" this year, based on the unprecedented
number of students who applied for the positions,
according to Fellowship Director Robert Weitzner.
Weitzner attributed the increased response to an
attempt to offer a more "diverse array of opportuni
ties . . . which represent and integrate the eclectic
interests of the students and the many areas of the
public policy process." SiG was "very pleased at
meeting our (expansion) objectives set at the begin
ning of the year." he said, which included foreign af
fairs and human rights.
Each fellow will have the opportunity to work in
tensively at a high level of the national government,
in positions that, according to Weitzner, "span the
political Issue spectrum." Ratcliffe will work in trade
policy at the U.S. Trade Representative, Churchill In
environmental concerns at the Office of Technology
Assessment, Yang at the House Subcommittee on
Criminal Justice, and Kang in foreign affairs at Con
gressman Lee Hamilton's office.
The fellows were chosen by a "rigorous application
process," Weitzner said, which consisted of selection
committees composed of faculty, staff, past fellows
and other students.
Now that their positions are secured, the fellows'
preparation consists mainly of research into their
field of internship. Kang, for example, has "already
begun to study Congressman Hamilton," especially
"how he feels about specific issues, such as contra
support . . . and the Middle East."

Kartg acknowledged that as the first Stanford Fel
low to work In Hamilton's office, he feels a responsi
bility to perform well this summer so that SIG will be
able to offer the internship again next year. But be
cause of Hamilton's role in the developing Iran
contra affair and the Middle East. Kang said Hamil
ton's office is "the most exciting place I can think of
being this summer."
Many other students have found internships for
this summer, according to Samlra Kawash, SIG
chair. "We are looking forward to several students
going to Sacramento for the first time." she said,
adding that five of them will receive >1,000 scholar
ships. She said that SIG will not only continue but
expand the Sacramento program next year In order
to accommodate growing student interest.
Additionally, Kawash said, SIG would like to
develop a resource file of internship opportunities in
state governments outside of California. The plan
reflects "another way we're trying to reach all the stu
dents, not just those Interested In Washington or
California, for every student has a state and every
state has a government." she noted.
Kawash also cited a "larger response to all pro
grams" than in past years, especially SiG's "Issues
Beyond the Farm" lecture series, which she termed
"very successful." The only SIG offering which waned
in popularity this year was the Washington lobby
trip, designed both to give student applicants a bet
ter edge against those who are able to actually Inter
view for internships and to gather more information
about the positions and offices themselves.
"This will probably be the last year for the trip,"
Kawash said, since few students seemed interested
and past applicants did not feel it was an extraordi
nary service. The two students sent to Washington
over spring break did make good contacts with
various offices, she added, and returned with exten
sive information on potential housing, which SIG
would like to use in a book on living in Washington.
In the future, Kawash said, "much of the lobby
trip's function will be taken over by the D.C.
campus," scheduled to open next spring.
