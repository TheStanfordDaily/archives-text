# Freeman says social programs are responsible for social ills

### MARK LEMLEY Staff writer 
A scholar at the Hoover Institution has released a
controversial new report on the sources and extent of
poverty in America.
Roger Freeman, a senior fellow emeritus at Hoover,
said he released his monograph entitled "Does
America Neglect the Poor?" in response to the recent
pastoral letter on poverty written by the American
Catholic Bishops' Conference.
The thesis of his work, according to Freeman, is
that there is a causal relationship between the dra
matic expansion of social welfare programs and so
cial ills.
He believes that programs like the Great Society,
introduced by Lyndon Johnson in an attempt to end
poverty, actually had the opposite effect. "It was in
stead accompanied by a spectacular rise in all forms

of crime, family abandonment, child neglect,
widespread adoption of ruinous lifestyle and
destructive behavior, and an exponential growth of
drug and alcohol use," Freeman said.
Political Science Prof. John Manley characterized
this argument as "the standard conservative cri
tique." He said Freeman would have to show some
startling new evidence to justify releasing the report,
which he said sounded like "very old stuff."
Freeman's other main contention is that poverty is
not worsening in America today. He argues that un
employment is at its lowest point since President
Ronald Reagan took office, and takes issue with the
pastoral letter, which asserted that "poverty has in
creased dramatically."
In fact, argues Freeman, poverty has not shown a
long-term change in the last 20 years. He noted that
the bishops' evidence that poverty
had increased did not take into ac
count "food stamps, medical care
and other in-kind benefits" pro
vided by welfare programs. He
said that including these benefits
proved his point statistically.
He used the publication of his

book to attack two specific
proposals made by the Catholic
bishops. He argued that raising
the minimum wage would make
large numbers of people un
employable. He also said it would
"drive up . . . labor costs, raise
prices and make American goods
even less competitive than they
now are."
Increasing benefits paid by Aid
to Families with Dependent
Children, another proposal made

by the churchmen, would tremen
dously increase the budget deficit,
according to Freeman.
Freeman concluded that "the
most painful shortcoming in the
bishops' letter is the failure to em
phasize the prime responsibility
that all persons have for them
selves. . . . That, it seems to me, is
about the worst message to give
anybody in a letter that aspires to
be moral teaching."
