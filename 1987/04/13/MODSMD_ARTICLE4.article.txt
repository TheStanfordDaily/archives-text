Using a grant from the Andrew
Mellon Foundation, the School of
Education will implement a new
coterminal teacher education pro
gram this fall that will involve un
dergraduates for the first time and
provide need-based financial aid.
The new Mellon program "is de
signed to attract outstanding un
dergraduates to the field of teach
ing" while providing "expanded
teacher education curriculum and
financial aid for those who
qualify," according to Marge
Kalkowski, assistant director of
Stanford's Mellon Foundation pro
gram in teacher education.
The program, backed by a
*500,000 grant, will involve edu
cation electives and seminars
during students' junior and
senior years, according to
Kalkowski. The students' fifth
year will include classroom experi
ence, she said.
At present, students in the
coterminal Stanford Teacher Edu
cation Program (STEP) don't
begin studying for their coter
minal degree until their fifth year.
The Mellon program will lead to
a master's degree in education
and a California single-subject
teaching credential, just as the
STEP program currently does.

The three-year program will ac
cept 10 students each year. Soph
omores majoring in English,
French, German, Spanish, biol
ogy, chemistry, history, math or
physics are eligible to apply for the
program, which begins fall 1987.
Kalkowski said.
The School of Education will be
accepting applications for this fall
until May 1, she said. The inter
views for the 10 fall quarter
openings will be held during May,
with the results to be announced
by June 1, according to
Kalkowski.
The Mellon grant will provide
need-based financial aid to fifth
year students who qualify. Previ
ously, many students in the STEP
program have had to take out
loans to finance their fifth year,
according to Kalkowski.
"We've never had a problem at
Stanford with the quality of appli
cants (to STEP), but we have lost
some very talented people because
they couldn't afford a fifth year of
study," Education Prof. Nel Nod
dings said. Noddings will serve as
administrator of the Mellon proj
ect.
As a result of the Mellon grant,
however, fifth-year students can
now expect "substantial" financial
aid, plus "limited support in the
