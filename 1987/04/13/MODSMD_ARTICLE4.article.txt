### JAY FRY Staff writer 
Using a grant from the Andrew
Mellon Foundation, the School of
Education will implement a new
coterminal teacher education pro
gram this fall that will involve un
dergraduates for the first time and
provide need-based financial aid.
The new Mellon program "is de
signed to attract outstanding un
dergraduates to the field of teach
ing" while providing "expanded
teacher education curriculum and
financial aid for those who
qualify," according to Marge
Kalkowski, assistant director of
Stanford's Mellon Foundation pro
gram in teacher education.
The program, backed by a
*500,000 grant, will involve edu
cation electives and seminars
during students' junior and
senior years, according to
Kalkowski. The students' fifth
year will include classroom experi
ence, she said.
At present, students in the
coterminal Stanford Teacher Edu
cation Program (STEP) don't
begin studying for their coter
minal degree until their fifth year.
The Mellon program will lead to
a master's degree in education
and a California single-subject
teaching credential, just as the
STEP program currently does.

The three-year program will ac
cept 10 students each year. Soph
omores majoring in English,
French, German, Spanish, biol
ogy, chemistry, history, math or
physics are eligible to apply for the
program, which begins fall 1987.
Kalkowski said.
The School of Education will be
accepting applications for this fall
until May 1, she said. The inter
views for the 10 fall quarter
openings will be held during May,
with the results to be announced
by June 1, according to
Kalkowski.
The Mellon grant will provide
need-based financial aid to fifth
year students who qualify. Previ
ously, many students in the STEP
program have had to take out
loans to finance their fifth year,
according to Kalkowski.
"We've never had a problem at
Stanford with the quality of appli
cants (to STEP), but we have lost
some very talented people because
they couldn't afford a fifth year of
study," Education Prof. Nel Nod
dings said. Noddings will serve as
administrator of the Mellon proj
ect.
As a result of the Mellon grant,
however, fifth-year students can
now expect "substantial" financial
aid, plus "limited support in the
undergraduate years," such as
payment for tutoring. Kalkowski
said.
The Mellon project will also al
low the undergraduate to form
ulate a plan of study with advisers
from both his or her academic
major and from the School of Edu
cation. said Kalkowski. The on
going seminars and education
electlves students will take as
juniors and seniors are designed
to give them training in educa
tional theory that will be of practi
cal use in the classroom, she said.
"Students who specialize In
their major area have often lost
sight of the discipline and don't
have the basic understanding to
teach at a high school level." said
Kalkowski. The Mellon project
curriculum will help students

"think about their majors from a
pedagogical point of view."
During the undergraduate
years. Kalkowski said, students
will participate in tutoring and in
school observation at local
schools. The fifth year will involve
both course work and actual
teaching for two periods a day.
The Mellon Foundation gave
similar grants to Columbia. Cor
nell and Harvard. All four schools
will be meeting later in April to
"compare notes," Kalkowski said.
While Stanford and Cornell
worked together to receive the
grants, "the programs are inde
pendent of each other." she said.
"We are consulting with one an
other mostly to bounce ideas off
each other."
The future of the Mellon pro
gram beyond the Initial three
years depends upon the financial
situation once the program is un
der way, according to Noddings.
Many of the details of the program
are still being finalized and are

subject to change. Kalkowskl said.
"We're looking for commitment
to the field of education" on the
part of the applicants, as well as
students who have "done well
academically." she said.
"I think that we really need
really well qualified students to get
Involved In education right now."
Kalkowskl said. "The field Is at an
exciting point In time; the public
Is really concerned with educa
tion. The field is really ripe for
change.
"Students with a lot of motiva
tion could have a lot of impact in
the near future." Kalkowskl said,
and she believes that the Mellon
project will provide Stanford stu
dents with that opportunity.
"It offers students a head start
on preparation for a teaching
career," she said.
Applications are available at the
School of Education Admissions
Office, Kalkowskl said. She Is
available to answer questions con
cerning the program at 723-4891.
