# DuPont calls for new opportunity

### MICHAEL CHEN 
Former Delaware Gov. Pete Du-
Pont, the first Republican to
declare his presidential candidacy
for 1988, emphasized the need for
increased "individual opportu
nity" in the United States in a
speech Friday in Cubberley
Auditorium.
"I'm running for president be
cause I believe that individual op
portunity is the most important
thing in your life." DuPont said.
"That's what a president of the
United States ought to be trying to
do for you: Create a climate of op
portunity where you can make
your own decisions, where you
have the resources to do that and
the chance to make tomorrow a
little brighter."
DuPont is prepared to make
radical changes in government
programs in order to increase this
"individual opportunity."
"All the other candidates, with
perhaps the exception of Jesse
Jackson, are status-quo candi
dates," he said. "I think we have to
make some big new decisions. . . .
I want to help the American people
make the changes that all of us
understand have to be made."
DuPont discussed three of the
reforms he advocates. One change
would be to replace the existing
system of public education with a

voucher system, enabling families
to choose their own public schools
by means of private grants.
"Why -do you think the educa
tion system is not as good as it
ought to be?" DuPont asked. "I got
an idea; it's because it's a
monopoly. Do monopolies work
very well? Does the post office
work?"
DuPont is also in favor of replac
ing the present welfare system,
which he believes has under
mined the American family and
work ethic, with a workfare sys
tem. "If you and I sat down this af
ternoon to design a welfare system
that was intended to take dignity
away from people and to deny
them opportunity, we couldn't
have done a better job than what
we've got today," DuPont said.
In addition, DuPont proposed
the elimination of farm subsidies,
maintaining that a free market
place will benefit American
agriculture. "My proposal is to
phase down farm subsidies over
five years to give them time to ad
just. and then let's help the farmer
compete in the marketplace." he
said. "The market has served
every other segment of American
endeavor, and it has served the
farm community, too."
