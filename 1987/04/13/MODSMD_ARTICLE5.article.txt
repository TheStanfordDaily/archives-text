# DuPont calls for new opportunity
## 
### MICHAEL CHEN 
Former Delaware Gov. Pete Du-
Pont, the first Republican to
declare his presidential candidacy
for 1988, emphasized the need for
increased "individual opportu
nity" in the United States in a
speech Friday in Cubberley
Auditorium.
"I'm running for president be
cause I believe that individual op
portunity is the most important
thing in your life." DuPont said.
"That's what a president of the
United States ought to be trying to
do for you: Create a climate of op
portunity where you can make
your own decisions, where you
have the resources to do that and
the chance to make tomorrow a
little brighter."
DuPont is prepared to make
radical changes in government
programs in order to increase this
"individual opportunity."
"All the other candidates, with
perhaps the exception of Jesse
Jackson, are status-quo candi
dates," he said. "I think we have to
make some big new decisions. . . .
I want to help the American people
make the changes that all of us
understand have to be made."
DuPont discussed three of the
reforms he advocates. One change
would be to replace the existing
system of public education with a

voucher system, enabling families
to choose their own public schools
by means of private grants.
"Why -do you think the educa
tion system is not as good as it
ought to be?" DuPont asked. "I got
an idea; it's because it's a
monopoly. Do monopolies work
very well? Does the post office
work?"
DuPont is also in favor of replac
ing the present welfare system,
which he believes has under
mined the American family and
work ethic, with a workfare sys
tem. "If you and I sat down this af
ternoon to design a welfare system
that was intended to take dignity
away from people and to deny
them opportunity, we couldn't
have done a better job than what
we've got today," DuPont said.
In addition, DuPont proposed
the elimination of farm subsidies,
maintaining that a free market
place will benefit American
agriculture. "My proposal is to
phase down farm subsidies over
five years to give them time to ad
just. and then let's help the farmer
compete in the marketplace." he
said. "The market has served
every other segment of American
endeavor, and it has served the
farm community, too."
Audience reaction to DuPont
varied. "I give him a good rating
on speaking ability and communi
cation ability," said Subodh
Chandra, chair of Stanford Demo
crats. "However, it's very difficult
to respond to rhetoric. ... He
oversimplified some of the issues
so much."
Junior Lisa Yanney. a campaign
worker for DuPont, said the
former governor's attitude is
refreshing. "I think we need a
change. I think the way we're
going is downhill. . . . Some of his
programs may be a little bit ex
treme, but on the whole, every
thing (in them) is what needs to
be done."
In a question-and-answer ses
sion after the speech, DuPont was
asked about his support for man

datory drug testing in high
schools. According to DuPont's
program, high school students
chosen at random would be forced
to submit to a drug test; upon
failing the test, the guilty stu
dent's driver's license would be
revoked for a certain period of
time. "Drugs destroy opportu
nity," DuPont said. "How do we
send the message to young
people?"
Foreign policy entered the dis
cussion when one audience mem
ber asked for DuPont's opinions
on a nuclear test-ban treaty,
foreign aid to Third World nations
and Central America. DuPont said
he supports nuclear testing,
asserting that the United States
needs to know whether the
missiles it has are effective and
will work. As for foreign aid, Du-
Pont declared that the United
States must simultaneously

"protect the interests of the
United States" and "help people be
free."
DuPont also advocates Ameri
can intervention in the sagging
market economies of Third World
countries. In Central America,
DuPont favors supporting the
contras. "We ought to be helping
them get their revolution back,"
he said.
In response to a question on the
Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI),
DuPont said that he conceives of
SDI as a form of arms control.
