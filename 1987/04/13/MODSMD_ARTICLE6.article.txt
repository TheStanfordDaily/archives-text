### RUSSELL KOROBKIN Editorial staff 
This is another in a series of articles on
the candidates and issues that will ap
pear on the ASSU spring election ballot.

Thirty-two undergraduate senate can
didates and nine graduate candidates
will appear on the ASSU spring election
ballot tomorrow and Wednesday, accord
ing to ASSU Elections Commissioner
Brett Jarvis.
Of these. 10 undergraduates will be
elected voting members of the ASSU
Senate and 10 more will be chosen as
non-voting senators.
Ten graduate senators will also be
elected. According to Jarvis. there will
be room on the ballot for write-in
choices, since only nine graduate stu

Unlike undergraduates, who are

elected at large, graduate senators are
elected by district. The schools of busi
ness, law and medicine are allowed a
total of three seats, as are the schools of
humanities and sciences, education and
earth sciences. The School of Engineer
ing is allowed four.
