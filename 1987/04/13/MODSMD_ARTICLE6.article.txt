### RUSSELL KOROBKIN Editorial staff 
This is another in a series of articles on
the candidates and issues that will ap
pear on the ASSU spring election ballot.

Thirty-two undergraduate senate can
didates and nine graduate candidates
will appear on the ASSU spring election
ballot tomorrow and Wednesday, accord
ing to ASSU Elections Commissioner
Brett Jarvis.
Of these. 10 undergraduates will be
elected voting members of the ASSU
Senate and 10 more will be chosen as
non-voting senators.
Ten graduate senators will also be
elected. According to Jarvis. there will
be room on the ballot for write-in
choices, since only nine graduate stu
dents have entered the race.
Unlike undergraduates, who are

elected at large, graduate senators are
elected by district. The schools of busi
ness, law and medicine are allowed a
total of three seats, as are the schools of
humanities and sciences, education and
earth sciences. The School of Engineer
ing is allowed four.

Council of Presidents (COP) member
Carey White said that fewer senate can
didates have attempted to identify them
selves with specific issues this year than
in past elections.
"Well over half the people are saying al
most nothing about themselves," he
said. "It's never good for people to prom
ise the moon, but there's a big difference
between promising the moon and put

ting your name and nothing else on a
flier."
White said he thinks there has histori
cally been a correlation between a strong
issue orientation during senate cam
paigns and performance in office. Can
didates who "have Issues do a good job."
he said, while candidates who run
saying "they dislike X. Y or Z run into
brick walls" in the senate and "have the
least productive experience for them
selves and those who vote for them."
White said candidates who don't nan
on any issues, positive or negative, are
usually less effective than those with
positive programs but more effective
than those with negative programs.
Jarvis agreed with White that Issues
"seem to be minimal" in this year's cam
paign, and suggested that successful
senators often have specific ideas. "The
most common statement is to 'get
rid of the bureaucracy.' That's
what everyone would like to see
and something very hard to ac
complish," he said.
Candidates supported by the
People's Platform, a coalition of
students who support a political
agenda promoting the rights and
interests of minorities, are among
the most issue-oriented candi

dates, according to White.
According to Vivian Wu, an
ASSU senator and member of the
coalition, the People's Platform
stands for the development of eth
nic studies programs, divestment
and increased student group of
fice space.
Wu said senate candidates en
dorsed by the People's Platform
are campaigning individually and
collectively. A change in the
ASSU's election rules allows can
didates to campaign in groups, al
though they will appear as indi
viduals on the ballot.

The Chaparral humor magazine
is also running candidates in a
group, according to editor and
senate candidate Jim Suhre.
Suhre complained that the senate
is hampered by a "lack of student
group experience among the
senators" and said the Chaparral
candidates want to "leave fee as
sessments up to the students."
Suhre said that despite the
satiric approach many Chaparral
candidates take to campaigning,
the group is "definitely running
seriously."
