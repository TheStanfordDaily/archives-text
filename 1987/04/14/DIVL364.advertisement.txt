Today, Applied Technology is exploring an exciting new product
arena which includes Integrated Threat Warning Systems, C3I,
Space and Strategic Defense Systems, and Test, Training and
Simulation Systems. Our major business areas include threat warn
ing systems, support equipment, minicomputers, optical signal pro
cessors, optical spectrum analyzers, and reconnaissance systems.
Over the last 20 years, Applied Technology has become the pre
mier developer of advanced warning systems â€” designs that have
revolutionized modern electronic warfare. It's earned us a solid
reputation for creativity, state-of-the-art design and quality
production.
And, with the backing of Litton, we've invested over $40 million in a
new, ultramodern 355,000+ square foot facility with well-equipped
laboratories and offices, and complete fitness, recreation and dining
facilities. This centralized facility provides an atmosphere conducive
to technical innovation and excellence.
