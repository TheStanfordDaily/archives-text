# Western Culture Task Force urges reforms
## 
### LORI SILVER Staff writer 
A University task force released
a report yesterday calling for
major reforms in the Western Cul
ture requirement and recom
mending that the main purpose of
the Area One requirement become
the study of diverse cultures.
The report calls on tracks to
focus on a non-European culture,
include primary texts by women
and minorites, abolish the core
list of readings and even change
the name of the Area One require

ment to Cultures, Ideas and
Values.
The draft legislation, prepared
by the Task Force on the Area One
requirement, led by History Prof.
Paul Seaver, will be presented to
the Committee on Undergraduate
Studies after faculty and students
have a chance to contribute ideas.
Although Dean of Undergradu
ate Studies Carolyn Lougee and
Assoc. History Prof. Clay Carson,
both members of the task force,
characterized the reforms as "very
moderate," Seaver said the pro
posal will change the central ob

jective of the Area One require
ment to the study of diverse
cultures.
According to the draft legisla
tion, "the objectives of the Area
One requirement are to broaden
students' understanding of differ
ent cultures, cultural diversty and
the processes of cultural interac
tion."
"The liberal education of Stan
ford undergraduates should in
clude the study of the cultural di
versity that has become the heri
tage of us all," the report states.
According to Seaver, the major

changes proposed by the task
force include dropping the core
list of readings and requiring geo
graphic and cultural diversity of
texts.

The report proposes that all
tracks in the program deal with
some Latin American, Asian or
African culture besides European
cultures, Seaver said.
"The draft suggests diversity in
not only in geography, but also in

terms of elite and non-elite writ
ers. All tracks must include texts
by women and minorities," Seaver
said.
"We have restructured the pro
gram to allow innovations that
have occurred to permeate the last
bastion of traditionalism," Carson
said.
Lougee said the changes have a
"great deal of continuity with the
purpose of the existing program."
"The continuity comes partly in
the rationale (behind the Area One
requirement). We're acquainting
students with what they're going

to need in order to understand the
society in which they live and
operate effectively in it," she said.
Lougee said that the proposal
will allow for creative thinking
about the Area One requirement.
She said that existing tracks
would have to be significantly
modified for them to meet the
criteria of the new proposal.
The flexibility of the proposal
will allow the tracks to develop
their particular themes, Seaver
said.
"After the tracks declare their
purpose, they can adjust their
reading or chronological span to
their purpose. Right now, many
tracks don't have a purpose —
their only purpose Is to teach the
core list of books." he said.
For Classics Prof. Susan Step
hens, a task force member, the
"old core list was full of flaws. It ex
cludes major Influences on West
ern and non-Western thought,"
she said.
"I hope the proposal will
generate excitement In the faculty
in ways to organize new courses."
she said.
Stephens, co-chair of the Con
flict and Change track, said she
envisions new courses like Cul
ture of the Americas — focusing
on the development of culture In
North and South America — and
Urban Centers, which would em
phasize the growth of culture in
major cities like London, Rome
and Athens.
Carson said that the task force
"was working with a view of trying
to get legislation that would have
enough support to get adopted."
Seaver said that Interviews with
student groups and faculty helped
to shape the task force's decision.
Carson said the changes
resulted from "changes in the fac
ulty and changes In the level of
knowledge of the students."
"Most of the faculty now press
ing for reform had no power at the
time the Western Culture program
was set up." he said.
