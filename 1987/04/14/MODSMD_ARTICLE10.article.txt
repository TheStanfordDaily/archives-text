## 
### 
The following Is the text oj the
recommendations of the Task Force
on the Area One requirement, which
urns charged last Jail with carrying
out a comprehensive review oj the
Western Culture requirement. The
task force members Include: Assoc.
History Prof. Clay Carson, Asst.
Provost Fernando de Necochea, soph
omore Jay Gilbert, VTSS lecturer
Barry M. Katz. Junior William King,
Dean of Undergraduate Studies
Carolyn Lougee, Philosophy Prof.
John Perry, Assoc. Classics Prof.
Susan Stephens and sophomore Barb
Voss.
Effective no later than autumn
quarter 1989-90, the three-quarter se
quences certified as fulfilling the Area
One requirement shall be limited to
those which conform to the rationale,
objectives and criteria specified below.
Beginning In 1987-88. proposals for
sequences that satisfy the require
ment may be submitted to the Area
One Program Committee for review
and approval for the subsequent year.
1. Rationale
The liberal education of Stanford
undergraduates should include study
of the cultural diversity that has
become the heritage of us all.
Comparative studies that bring out
the distinctive themes and character
istics of cultures permit students to
become familiar with their own cul
ture and with cultures not their own.
Courses that study the traditions and
values of diverse cultures — African.
Asian and Latin American, as well as
European — can prepare students to
be active members In their own society
and In the global community of which
they are a part. They enable students
to appreciate and understand the
United States as a multicultural soci
ety, since they, study several of the
cultures that have converged to com

prise it.
Our understanding of ourselves as
Individuals and as members of com
munities depends In part on a knowl
edge of the cultures, Ideas and values
that have helped shape the kinds of
people we are and the kind of society
we live in. Such knowledge enables
students to appreciate and to examine
critically various cultures and to
escape the blinders of provincialism.

D. To enable students to Increase their

ters. It shall recommend to the CUS
any changes it considers desirable in
policy concerning the teaching of se

6. Student fulfillment of the require
ment
A. Students shall be encouraged to
satisfy the requirement as early as
possible in their undergraduate
studies, preferably in their first year.
B. Transfer students with acceptable
credits shall have satisfied the Area
One requirement.
The following Is the text oj the
recommendations of the Task Force
on the Area One requirement, which
urns charged last Jail with carrying
out a comprehensive review oj the
Western Culture requirement. The
task force members Include: Assoc.
History Prof. Clay Carson, Asst.
Provost Fernando de Necochea, soph
omore Jay Gilbert, VTSS lecturer
Barry M. Katz. Junior William King,
Dean of Undergraduate Studies
Carolyn Lougee, Philosophy Prof.
John Perry, Assoc. Classics Prof.
Susan Stephens and sophomore Barb
Voss.
Effective no later than autumn
quarter 1989-90, the three-quarter se
quences certified as fulfilling the Area
One requirement shall be limited to
those which conform to the rationale,
objectives and criteria specified below.
Beginning In 1987-88. proposals for
sequences that satisfy the require
ment may be submitted to the Area
One Program Committee for review
and approval for the subsequent year.
1. Rationale
The liberal education of Stanford
undergraduates should include study
of the cultural diversity that has
become the heritage of us all.
Comparative studies that bring out
the distinctive themes and character
istics of cultures permit students to
become familiar with their own cul
ture and with cultures not their own.
Courses that study the traditions and
values of diverse cultures — African.
Asian and Latin American, as well as
European — can prepare students to
be active members In their own society
and In the global community of which
they are a part. They enable students
to appreciate and understand the
United States as a multicultural soci
ety, since they, study several of the
cultures that have converged to com

prise it.
Our understanding of ourselves as
Individuals and as members of com
munities depends In part on a knowl
edge of the cultures, Ideas and values
that have helped shape the kinds of
people we are and the kind of society
we live in. Such knowledge enables
students to appreciate and to examine
critically various cultures and to
escape the blinders of provincialism.
2. The objectives of the Area One re
quirement are:
A. To broaden students' understand
ing of different cultures, cultural di
versity and the processes of cultural
interaction both within a single cul
ture and between different cultures;
B. To engage students with works that
have Intellectual importance by virtue
of the ideas they express, their mode of
expression or their influence;
C. To develope students' abilities to
understand ideas and values, for the
sake of self-understanding and under
standing of others;
D. To enable students to Increase their
skills — in understanding and analyz
ing works. In reasoning and arguing
for or against an interpretation and in
expressing their understanding and
interpretation orally and in writing —
and to prepare them for advanced
work in the humanities, sciences and
engineering.
3. The number of sequences certified
as satisfying the Area One require
ment shall not exceed 10. Certified
sequences are required:
Diversity:
A. Geographical. To study at least one
culture inside and at least one outside
the European family of cultures. Each
culture shall be treated on its own
terms as well as in terms of its interac
tions with other cultures.
B. Historical. To have an historical di

C. Social. To confront Issues relating
to class, race and gender, and to in
clude a substantial number of works
by women, minorities and persons of

tions; buildings and machines.
H. To instruct in small groups for a
minimum of two hours each week, al
though three to four hours each week
would be preferable. These discussion
groups should not exceed 18 students,
but 15 would be a more desirable
number. Students' performance In
these small groups shall form a signifi
cant part of the evaluation of their
work.
I. To be five-unit courses, meeting five
hours weekly. These courses may, but
need not. Include lectures. Courses
that receive credit toward a major shall

pervised by the Area One Committee,
which shall;
A. Be composed of a small number of
faculty (a majority of whom are not
teaching in the approved sequences),
a lecturer/instructor, two student
members nominated by the ASSU,
with the deans of Humanities and
Sciences and Engineering (or a repre
sentative of each) and the dean of Un
dergraduate Studies (if he or she is not
the representative of the dean of H&S)
as ex officio members. The goals of the
Program will be best served by a com
mittee balanced with regard to gender,
ethnicity, academic discipline and
field of expertise.
B. Be appointed by the provost on the
recommendation of the dean of

Humanities and Sciences, in consulta
tion with the deans of the Schools of
Engineering and Earth Sciences.
C. Prepare an evaluation of each se
quence in terms of the objectives,
criteria and rationale listed above at
least every second year that a sequence
is taught. These evaluations should be
Included In a report to the Committee
on Undergraduate Studies (CUS) and
should be used as the basis for deci
sions concerning enrollments in the
various sequences as well as for deci
sions concerning the continuation of
particular sequences.
D. Certification shall be for a period of
up to four years and may be renewed.
Applications for renewal should be
