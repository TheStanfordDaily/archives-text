# CIR should adopt new outlook
## 
### 
The Committee on Investment Responsibil
ity (CIR) will vote Wednesday on a proposal for
total divestment which, If accepted, could lead
to a radical departure from previous behavior.
Stanford Out of South Africa (SOSA) enthusi
astically endorses the proposal and urges the
CIR to vote positively on it.

SOSA

The proposal treats the criteria and
timetable for divestment. It maintains that
companies must terminate both commercial
activity with the government of South Africa
and Its security apparatus and terminate
operations of subsidiary firms In South Africa
by the beginning of next year. It states: "If cor
porations refuse to adopt the measures out
lined above by Jan. 1, 1988, then the Univer
sity will Immediately begin to enact procedures
for divestment of Its securities In the corpora
tions. Divestment from these corporations will
be completed by Jan. 1, 1989."
The meaning of the proposal may be better
understood when one examines previous CIR
behavior. The CIR was founded by the Univer
sity after May 1977, when 294 Stanford
protesters were arrested. The committee was

supposed to develop a moral investment policy.
In 10 years, the committee has recom
mended divestment from few companies and
Stanford has divested only *5.8 million of
â™¦ 190 million of South Africa-related stock. At
this pace, it would take the University Board of
Trustees approximately 330 years to divest all
of Stanford's South Africa-related holdings.
Thus the proposal, which mandates that the
divestment process be competed by Jan. 1,
1989, represents a major shift in policy. SOSA
applauds the change.
The meaning of the new proposal may also
be better understood when one looks at the
philosophy that underpins it. From 1977 to
1985, the committee maintained that compan
ies could play a net-positive role in South
Africa. Continued investment was thus jus
tifiable.
At the beginning of this school year, the
committee wrote that companies play a net
negative role in South Africa, yet individual
companies can perform actions that balance
out the negative fact of being in South Africa.
This orientation leads to an approach of
selective divestment, which weighs the merits
and drawbacks of each company individually.
Both previous CIR positions were character
ized by the belief that companies can perform
positive social actions in South Africa.

The new proposal rejects the previous prem
ise. It states that given "the repressive nature
and pervasiveness of the apartheid system In
South Africa, however, any corporation con
ducting business in or with South Africa is
aiding in or directly causing substantial social
injury. These corporations legitimize and lend
credibility to the oppressive regime, provide
technology necessary for the modernization
and maintenance of government repression
and create a revenue base for the minority
regime. , . . Foreign corporations, rather than
helping to reform apartheid, actually bolster
the apartheid regime."
Thus the new proposal represents both a
step toward total divestment and a major
philosophical shift as to the role of foreign cor
porations in South Africa. Whereas previously
the committee maintained that companies
could somehow play a positive role In South
Africa and implement a divestment pace which
reflected that understanding, it has now put
forth a proposal that both rejects its previous
logic and calls for divestment within 18
months.
SOSA approves of the change by the commit
tee and hopes that it will pass the proposal in
its meeting tomorrow.
This viewpoint was submitted by Stanford
Out of South Africa.
