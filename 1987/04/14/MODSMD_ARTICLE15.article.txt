# Lessons of 'Blue Velvet'
## 
### 
According to a significant number of critics and
columnists, yours truly in the little picture must be
depraved, vulgar and absolutely against the grain.
Why? Because I like the movie "Blue Velvet."
That film is amazingly controversial. You know
"Blue Velvet." Written and directed by David Lynch;
stars a terrifying Dennis Hopper; plays at the Flicks
in May. It inspired one San Francisco Chronicle col
umnist to say, "This movie represents everything
that's wrong with the world today."

So, how reasonable is it to see my favorite film as
an expression of moral corruption? Is "Blue Velvet" a
work of art or is it just a pimple of a movie?
First, a look at what is wrong with the world today.
Allow me to introduce Oliver North, Oral Roberts (or
Tammy Faye Bakker) and . . . oh, Vanna White.
The media gave us Oliver North as ail-American,
patriotic, loyal to God and country. But since he's
been silent, who knows what he's really like? Most
disturbing: Perhaps he is — unquestioningly — an
all-American patriotic lover of God and country.
Oral and Tammy Faye have a veneer of religion.
Their show-business fronts may obscure some kind
of religious commitment or they may be just facades.
How can you tell?
Vanna White says she's a good girl but looks like
she isn't. Now she's in Playboy so she looks good but
pretty definitely isn't. Praise her or damn her, you
can't explain her.
Do the people I've named represent some of the
things that are wrong with our world? They pretend
virtue or seem to pretend it; at least we suspect them
of pretense. "Blue Velvet" doesn't pretend anything.
What audiences want from movies are themes they
can agree with. This is why historical and biographi
cal films are safe properties. They deal with subjects
that have already been canonized — kind of like
Western Culture texts. Who's going to say they hated
"Gandhi"?
If you'd been watching TV at 1 a.m. last Tuesday,
you could have caught the 1950 epic "American
Guerilla in the Philippines." Perhaps one senses a
Cold War mentality? At least it's overt. Compare it to
the more insidious "Rambo" movies. Then compare
"Rambo" to "Gandhi." Do you think they're polar op
posites? I don't.
"Rambo" glorifies violence. "Gandhi" glorifies non
violence. Rambo is the hero of his movie and Gandhi
is the hero of his. Obviously the subject matter is dif
ferent and each film takes a predictable moral
stance. But let's look at how both films treat the
heroization of their characters.
In fact, neither "Rambo" nor "Gandhi" pays any at
tention to this process. "Rambo" is as one
dimensional as a comic book. "Gandhi" resembles
the kind of biography written to instruct children
who their heroes are.
"Blue Velvet," however, deals with precisely the
processes of heroization and the formation of moral
judgements. The film begins with a complete, one
dimensional picture: the white picket fence, the red
tulips, the blue sky. This picture is then peeled away
and the dark events unfold (it's OK to be
melodramatic). You don't just learn what's behind
the pretty picture, you learn how it was painted. As
the movie ends, the opening scene is reconstructed.

It's still red, white and blue, but now you're aware of
the whole spectrum.
People say "Blue Velvet" is a pimple, that it lacks
moral vision because you can't learn anything from a
pimple. Other people, wrongly I think, do see it as
decadent and celebrate that. Before one can begin to
understand "Blue Velvet," it helps to look at David
Lynch's earlier films.
"The Elephant Man" seems to belong to the histori
cal/biographical genre. It's based on the true story of
John Merrick, who is horribly deformed but has a
noble heart. The "elephant man" who is the subject
of the film is also the object of study for the other
main character, a doctor. This dimension of the film
is heightened by comparing the doctor to the car
nival manager who exploits Merrick.
Lynch is dealing with questions raised by Foucault
and other scholars. The 19th century saw the rise of
the scientific study of man, the other side of which
was the reduction of the individual to a manageable
entity. Only recently have we been aware that this
"till happens.
It's interesting that when Lynch's film came out,
there had recently been a stage play based on the
same true story and a TV film based on that play.
Even more interesting: David Bowie played the title
role in one production of the play. This is typical of
the way personalities are picked up as properties,
glorified and then dropped. Look at how TV news
treats major organ-transplant patients.
Lynch's next film, "Dune," was liked or disliked
depending on whether viewers liked Frank Herbert's
novel. Has anyone talked about "Dune" just as a
film?
"Dune" is another in the biographical genre, an
epic that happens to be science fiction. You can see it
as straight adventure. But it's quite revealing, as an
example of Lynch's work, to see it as a treatment of
the process of heroizatlon. That vast complex of
spacy machinery isn't there for special effects a la
"Star Wars." It's symbolic of the pressures on the
Kyle McLachlan character to become a hero, to fit
into the complex as the pre-eminent cog in the sys
tem. •
McLachlan also plays the clean-cut and innocent
(but he has an earring) Jeffrey in "Blue Velvet." I
would guess that Lynch sees this actor as blank —
suitable for many roles. He's not really good or bad,
he's an indeterminate character. He makes you want
him to be a hero.
One thing about "Blue Velvet" that bothered nearly
everyone was that line about the singing robins of
love. Why do audiences titter nervously at this line?
One reason: If we've rejected the vision of evil the film
presents, to be consistent we should also reject the
film's presentation of good. This means pulling the
moral carpet out from under ourselves. On the other
hand, if we accept that evil does lie concealed in our
hearts. . . .
This ambiguous situation is what people refer to
when they say "Blue Velvet" has no moral vision. In
stead of presenting a full-fledged and implicit value
system, it challenges you to pull together your own
moral system.
"Blue Velvet" isn't a pimple. What can we learn
from this film? The possibility that Oliver North, the
Bakkers, Ronald Reagan and anyone who whole
heartedly defends situations without explaining why
or being aware that things might be otherwise — the
possibility that these people are the real pimples.
What is blue velvet, after all? It's a color, and a kind
of cloth. You and I make it sound all the ways it does.
