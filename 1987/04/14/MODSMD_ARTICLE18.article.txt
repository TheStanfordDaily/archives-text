## U.S./Soviet student summit to take place at Stanford 
### LORI SILVER Staff writer 
Regardless of whether Soviet
leader Mikhail Gorbachev travels
to Washington this year, he will
have missed the U.S./Soviet sum
mit at Stanford.
Soviet college students, spon
sored by the Stanford/Soviet Ex
change Project (SSEP). will visit
Stanford next year to participate
in an unusual summit — an ex
change of ideas and culture.
In return, the SSEP will send
approximately 13 Stanford under
graduates to the Soviet Union In
the winter of 1988. Last
Thursday, the SSEP held an infor
mation meeting for students in
terested in traveling to the Soviet
Union. The meeting outlined the
application process.
The two-week outbound pro
gram to the Soviet Union will
feature a 10-day dialogue with So

viet students at a yet-to-be
determined university and several
days of travel. Although the Soviet
Union will pay for all the Stanford
students' expenses while they are
in the country, participants are
expected to contribute *500.
funded by corporations or com
munity groups in their
hometown.
"We're looking for a diverse
group of people — all different
years, majors, interests and eth
nicity." said steering committee
member Jeff Lager, adding that
the group needs diversity to fairly
represent both Stanford and the
United States.
Senior Lisa Hoffman, an advisor
to the steering committee, empha
sized that knowledge of Russian is
not a requirement and encour
aged students of all majors — from
international relations to electri
cal engineering — to apply.
Applications are due Friday and

are available at the Overseas
Studies Office in Sweet Hall, at the
Bechtel International Center and
in the Slavic Languages, History
and International Relations De
partment offices.
"The important thing to realize
is that this is not a travel and not
an academic program. The object
is to get a cultural dialogue going
between the United States and the
Soviet Union." Lager said.
Students who are chosen will be
required to take at least one
Soviet-related course before they

leave. They are also expected to
participate in fund-raising events
and a seminar on Soviet culture,
and to welcome the incoming So
viet group, Hoffman said.
When they return from the So
viet Union, students will "share
their insights with the Stanford
community." according to Hoff
man.
While students are busy filling
out their applications, the steer
ing committee has more immedi
ate concerns on its mind — pre

paring for the arrival of the Soviet
students.
Although no dates have been
finalized, Hoffman said she is
hoping that the students, who are
scheduled to stay for two weeks,
will visit at the beginning of next
winter quarter.
"Fund raising is our main con
cern right now." said Jenny
Schmitz. head of SSEP fund
raising. Because the SSEP needs
to cover all of the Soviets' expenses
while they are in the United
States, the groups needs to raise
>30.000.
The SSEP will look for corporate
sponsors and University funds.
Schmitz said.
Ann Banchoff, a steering com
mittee member, said she expects
the Soviets will send their best
and brightest students. "They will
be challenging intellectually and
culturally," she said.
Hoffman said the Soviets will be

placed in dormitories or houses in
groups of twos and threes.
According to Lager, the Soviets
will participate in dialogues and
discussions during their stay. The
SSEP is also planning to "expose
the (Soviet) students to U.S. cul
tural life and show them what
Stanford is like," he said.
The SSEP. which was estab
lished in February, takes its shape
from the Yale/U.S.S.R. Project,
which has hosted two groups of
Soviet students and sent three
groups of Yale students to Moscow
State University.
The SSEP is co-sponsored by
the Citizen Exchange Council
(CEC). which is an American non
profit U.S./Soviet exchange opera
tion. and the Soviet Student
Council. The CEC choose Yale.
Stanford and Williams College as
three of nine American univer
sities to participate in the pro
gram.
