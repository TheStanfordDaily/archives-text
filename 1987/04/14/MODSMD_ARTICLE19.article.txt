# Bills, robots and glow-in-the-dark candy

Dear Bug Me,
Darn, this will be the second time in a row.
It seems like I never get around to turning my
study list in on time. But I /eel like my late
fees are really making an important contribu
tion toward the University. How much reve
nue is generated by everyone's penalty fees?
- The White Rabbit
Quite a hefty hunk. According to Jon Erick
son, a bursar in the Controller's Office, last au
tumn quarter alone 445 students filed late lists
at an average crack of *13 apiece — a total of
*5,830 for the University. Winter quarter
brought in *5,940.
Late payment of fees figures are also quite
impressive. Autumn quarter, 533 folks didn't
make it in time, adding *12,264 to University
coffers. And though 320 of the bills from last
quarter remain unpaid. 684 people have
generated a total of *12,694. Yipes.
Dear Bug Me,
Right now in CSIO6A, we're plowing our
way through "Karel the Robot," but I'm
confused. Distressed even. How the heck am I
supposed to pronounce "Karel," especially
since one TA calls it Carl and the other calls it

Carol? Doesn't anybody know?
- Karl
Richard Pattis, the creator of "Karel the
Robot" says:"I can't pronounce it myself,
though 1 tend to call it Carl. . . . It's something
like Karell in Czechoslovakian." Indeed it is.
The telephone operator at the Czechoslovakian
Embassy in Washington confirms its pronun
ciation as Karrell, with a rolled *r' in the middle
and an accent on the end.
The entire Karel project began for Pattis as a
way to kill time while working toward his doc
torate degree in Stanford's Computer Science
Department. As Pattis' legend goes, Karel. the
hero of this "gentle introduction into the art of
programming in PASCAL," takes his name
from the Czech author Karel Kapek, who intro
duced a form of the word "robot" from the Rus
sian phrase for "forced labor."
Dear Bug Me,
As long as we're talking about candy with
personality (like Pop Rocks) what about the
old tall tale about Wintergreen Lifesavers that
sparkle when you eat them in the dark. Do
they?
- Mikey
"Yes they do," says Caroline Fee, who wroks
in the public relations office at Nabisco, the

company that makes Lifesavers.
"They contain the two necessary ingredi
ents, mint flavoring and crystalline sugar. The
methyl saliclate in the mint flavoring reacts
with the sugar by emitting light when being
crushed."
Sounds hokey, doesn't it? But, sure enough,
it's true. Please do try this at home. kids. Each
disc is good for several flickers, a bit like
greenish lightning bugs flashing between your
molars.
Although the five or six people I talked with
at the Lifesavers public relations office
couldn't agree, extensive independent testing
(in my closet with a hand mirror) confirms
that only the Wint-O-Green (not the Pep-O-
Mint, Butter Creme Mint, Cryst-O-Mint or
Spear-O-Mint flavors) emits light. Also, win
tergreen Certs work equally well. The ultimate
Certs encounter.
Remember, gang, these are all real letters
sent in by real folks. Like you. Don't waste your
chance to see your work in print — send all
your questions to Bug Me, c/o The Stanford
Daily, Storke Student Publications Building,
Stanford, Calif., 94305, or through LOTS user
mail to the destination "Bug-Me" (include the
