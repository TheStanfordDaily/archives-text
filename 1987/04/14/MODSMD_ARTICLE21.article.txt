## Cardinal netters scorch visiting Sun Devil squad 
### KEN STEVENS Senior staff writer 
Stanford had already clinched its
women's tennis match against Arizona
State 7-1, but many of the spectators on
hand yesterday were still in their seats
watching the final doubles match on
court three.
Some remained simply to bask in
what was left of the 80-degree tempera
ture. Most, however, stayed to witness
the return of sophomore Eleni Rossides
to the Cardinal lineup.
After a layoff of one year, one month
and eight days, Rossides teamed with
sophomore Cindy Buchsbaum in the
No. 3 doubles match. And though the
pair was bested 7-5, 7-6 by ASU's
Therese Arildsen and Jill Hamilton.
Rossides was just glad to be back. "It felt
good," she said. "I just want to be able to
contribute somehow."
The Cardinal's 7-2 victory raised its
overall record to 15-3 and its Pacific 10
Conference mark to 4-3. The Sun Devils
dropped under .500 at 11-12.
Rossides, who had been sidelined by
stress fractures in both legs, under
standably had problems covering the
court, and her serve was not in top form
as she was plagued by double faults. "It
was all a bit shaky," she said. "I just
could not move my legs. Nine months is
a long time (to be out of action)."
"Literally, she hasn't been serving in
almost a year," Stanford Coach Frank
Brennan said.
But Brennan was not concerned with
results, and he liked what he saw. "It's

like the talking dog," he said. "It's not
what they say; it's that they speak at all.
I was very pleased. I was pleased she
made the mental breakthrough.
"Obviously she's a valuable member of
our team," Brennan added. "The sooner
we get her back, the better. I'm just
going to play it by ear. She's got a little
bit of work to do on the court before she
can get into matches."
Rossides said she does not expect to
be ready to play singles this weekend at
UCLA and USC, but she is optimistic
that she will be able to work her way into
shape by "practicing and playing sets
against people on the team."
In winning yesterday, the Cardinal
displayed its considerable depth at the
bottom of the ladder. Playing at No. 6,
Buchsbaum put Stanford on the
scoreboard first with a 6-1, 6-2 victory
over ASU's Beth Smigel. "That's a couple
of good matches in a row for Cindy,"
Brennan said.
Just seconds later, senior Leigh Anne
Eldredge won by the same score in the
No. 5 match, defeating the Sun Devils'
Kristi McCormick. The win marked
Eldredge's second impressive perfor
mance in as many singles matches fol
lowing her return from a stress-fracture
injury. .
"Eldredge was very good, and she was
pleased with the way she played," Bren
nan said. He added that he might move
her up in the singles lineup next
weekend in Los Angeles. "On the other
hand," he said, "Kay's been doing a good
job."
Kay Tittle was better than good yester

day as she routed ASU's Lisa Haldas 6-2,
6-2 in the No. 4 match. The junior from
Texas was sharp with her serves, volleys
and groundstrokes. and Haldas became
more and more frustrated as the match
progressed.
"Kay's really a good player if she can
stay positive." Brennan said. "She has
to blow some people out like that."
The Cardinal clinched the team vic
tory when senior Patty Fendick and
freshman Lisa Green recorded victories
on courts one and three. Fendick raised
her 1987 singles record to 25-0 with a 6-
3. 6-1 win against ASU's Laura Glitz in
the No. 1 match.
Green matched groundstrokes with
Arildsen in the No. 3 match and eventu
ally put away the native of Copenhagen.
Denmark by a 6-3. 6-4 score.
ASU's only singles victory came in the
No. 2 match, where senior Carol
Coparanis swept Stanford senior Steph
anie Savides 6-4. 6-4.
In the doubles. Tittle and Green
played a steady match at No. 2 to defeat
Haldas and McCormick 7-5, 6-2.
"They're starting to really concentrate."
Brennan said. "They're starting to keep
their bad periods shorter. Today, they
were doing a much better job of controll
ing it. They were helping each other
out."
Fendick and Savides won a first-set
tiebreaker in the No. 1 doubles and then
cruised in the second set to record a 7-6.
6-1 victory over Coparanis and Glitz.
The fifth-ranked Cardinal next plays
Friday in Los Angeles against seventh
ranked use.

Conference mark to 4-3. The Sun Devils
dropped under .500 at 11-12.
Rossides, who had been sidelined by
stress fractures in both legs, under
standably had problems covering the
court, and her serve was not in top form
as she was plagued by double faults. "It
was all a bit shaky," she said. "I just
could not move my legs. Nine months is
a long time (to be out of action)."
"Literally, she hasn't been serving in
almost a year," Stanford Coach Frank
Brennan said.
But Brennan was not concerned with
results, and he liked what he saw. "It's

like the talking dog," he said. "It's not
what they say; it's that they speak at all.
I was very pleased. I was pleased she
made the mental breakthrough.
"Obviously she's a valuable member of
our team," Brennan added. "The sooner
we get her back, the better. I'm just
going to play it by ear. She's got a little
bit of work to do on the court before she
can get into matches."
Rossides said she does not expect to
be ready to play singles this weekend at
UCLA and USC, but she is optimistic
that she will be able to work her way into
shape by "practicing and playing sets
against people on the team."
In winning yesterday, the Cardinal
displayed its considerable depth at the
bottom of the ladder. Playing at No. 6,
Buchsbaum put Stanford on the
scoreboard first with a 6-1, 6-2 victory
over ASU's Beth Smigel. "That's a couple
of good matches in a row for Cindy,"
Brennan said.
Just seconds later, senior Leigh Anne
Eldredge won by the same score in the
No. 5 match, defeating the Sun Devils'
Kristi McCormick. The win marked
Eldredge's second impressive perfor
mance in as many singles matches fol
lowing her return from a stress-fracture
injury. .
"Eldredge was very good, and she was
pleased with the way she played," Bren
nan said. He added that he might move
her up in the singles lineup next
weekend in Los Angeles. "On the other
hand," he said, "Kay's been doing a good
job."
Kay Tittle was better than good yester

day as she routed ASU's Lisa Haldas 6-2,
6-2 in the No. 4 match. The junior from
Texas was sharp with her serves, volleys
and groundstrokes. and Haldas became
more and more frustrated as the match
progressed.
"Kay's really a good player if she can
stay positive." Brennan said. "She has
to blow some people out like that."
The Cardinal clinched the team vic
tory when senior Patty Fendick and
freshman Lisa Green recorded victories
on courts one and three. Fendick raised
her 1987 singles record to 25-0 with a 6-
3. 6-1 win against ASU's Laura Glitz in
the No. 1 match.
Green matched groundstrokes with
Arildsen in the No. 3 match and eventu
ally put away the native of Copenhagen.
Denmark by a 6-3. 6-4 score.
ASU's only singles victory came in the
No. 2 match, where senior Carol
Coparanis swept Stanford senior Steph
anie Savides 6-4. 6-4.
In the doubles. Tittle and Green
played a steady match at No. 2 to defeat
Haldas and McCormick 7-5, 6-2.
"They're starting to really concentrate."
Brennan said. "They're starting to keep
their bad periods shorter. Today, they
were doing a much better job of controll
ing it. They were helping each other
out."
Fendick and Savides won a first-set
tiebreaker in the No. 1 doubles and then
cruised in the second set to record a 7-6.
6-1 victory over Coparanis and Glitz.
The fifth-ranked Cardinal next plays
Friday in Los Angeles against seventh
ranked use.
