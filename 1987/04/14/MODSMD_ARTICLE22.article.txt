# Stanford begins pivotal homestand versus 49ers
## 
### JON WEISMAN Staff writer 
At a press conference yesterday,
talk about the men's tennis team
ranged from great moments of the
past to great hopes for the future.
But for now, Stanford must con
centrate on the week at hand.
In a 1:30 p.m. match today at
the Stanford Tennis Stadium, the
Cardinal takes on second-ranked
Long Beach State in the first of
three straight matches against
the nation s top three teams.
Coach Dick Gould said it will
probably take at least two wins for
Stanford to be invited to the NCAA
championships next month in
Athens, Ga.
"This year they have 12 at-large
teams to increase the draw to 20,"
Gould said, "which gives us a
fighting chance. ... I think if we
beat one of these teams and beat
Cal (next week) we have an outside
chance, but I think we need to
beat two of these teams."
In the past, with a 16-teain field,
the NCAA selection committee has
never taken more than five teams
from the West Coast. Gould said
the number could go up to six this
year, but with No. 1 USC, Long

Beach State, No. 3 UCLA and No.
10 Pepperdine virtually
guaranteed berths, Stanford (11-
8) will be in a dogfight for the final
spot or spots with No. 1 1 Califor
nia, No. 17 UC-Irvine and the Uni
versity of San Diego, all of which
the Cardinal has lost to this year.
Fortunately. following a
nationwide example, those teams
have also beaten up on each other,
leaving the Cardinal, which is cur
rently out of the top 25 for the first
time since the computerized
rankings originated, in a position
to garner a berth if the team can
pull out some wins this week.
Long Beach State is 23-2, with
both losses coming to Stanford's
opponent Friday, USC. The 49ers
whipped the Cardinal here at
Stanford last year. 6-2, winning
five of six singles matches. They
boast four singles players in the
top 100, led by No. 7 Richard
Bergh. and two top-20 doubles
teams, which are led by No. 14
Bergh and Pat Hultgren.
"Long Beach just killed us in
singles last year," Gould said.
"Then they added another
Swedish player to complement
their No. 1 player, who is a

Swedish player. They are very ex
perienced in the rest of their
lineup. They're going to be very
tough. That's a must match for
us."
Stanford's Geordie McKee is on
a day-to-day basis due to a bruised
bone on the bottom of his foot,
and is doubtful for today's match.
Patrick McEnroe, who was the
Human Ice Bag after Saturday's
win over Arizona, will play despite
soreness in his left shoulder and
in his legs. Mentally, the Cardinal
appears as ready as it will ever be
for this week's matches.
"I think we're doing pretty well,"
Jeff Tarango said. "From what we
started with I think the team's im
proved a lot. I think we can do a lot
more still."
McEnroe agreed. "It's a good
challenge," he said. "I've felt all
along that we had a good chance
to beat some of the top schools,
and so far we haven't been able to,
but I think we have a good chance.
"We were kind of an underdog
last year in Athens," he said. "Not
in the same way that we are now.
but no one really expected us to
win last year."

Stanford freshman Jeff Tarango will probably face Long Beach State's Richard Bergh, who hails from
Sweden, this afternoon in the number one singles match.
"I like the way we're playing,
provided we're healthy," Gould
said.
Stanford followed the unat
tractive pattern set by college bas
ketball's Louisville this year by be
coming a borderline candidate for
the NCAA tournament the year
after winning the championship.

Gould said that if Stanford can
avoid Louisville's fate and just get
invited to Georgia, it will have a
reasonable chance to go far.
"We have four matches left,
three of them this week," Gould
said. "They're big matches, all ba
sically top-10 schools, and we've
got to come away with three wins.
And we're capable of doing it.
We're just about healthy enough,
and we're playing just about well
enough to make that a realistic
goal.

"Then you look even beyond
that toward the NCAAs," Gould
continued, "and you say, our rep
utation and performance (In Geor
gia) is such that people say, Oh
my God, here comes Stanford,'
and I wouldn't want to play us
then. But we have to get there.
"We're not far," he said. "We've
played most of the top teams.
We're coming along, like they say,
from injury recoveries and some of
the guys like Mark Jacobson have

improved their doubles. . . . We're
very, very close."
Stanford hosts USC, 7-0 in
Pacific-10 Southern Division play,
Friday at 1:30 p.m. The next day,
the Cardinal takes on UCLA in a
unique indoor/outdoor format.
Third through sixth singles and
second and third doubles will
begin at Stanford Tennis Stadium
at noon, with the rest of the
matches being played in Maples
Pavilion at 6:30 p.m.

along that we had a good chance
to beat some of the top schools,
and so far we haven't been able to,
but I think we have a good chance.
"We were kind of an underdog
last year in Athens," he said. "Not
in the same way that we are now.
but no one really expected us to
win last year."

Stanford freshman Jeff Tarango will probably face Long Beach State's Richard Bergh, who hails from
Sweden, this afternoon in the number one singles match.
"I like the way we're playing,
provided we're healthy," Gould
said.
Stanford followed the unat
tractive pattern set by college bas
ketball's Louisville this year by be
coming a borderline candidate for
the NCAA tournament the year
after winning the championship.

Gould said that if Stanford can
avoid Louisville's fate and just get
invited to Georgia, it will have a
reasonable chance to go far.
"We have four matches left,
three of them this week," Gould
said. "They're big matches, all ba
sically top-10 schools, and we've
got to come away with three wins.
And we're capable of doing it.
We're just about healthy enough,
and we're playing just about well
enough to make that a realistic
goal.

"Then you look even beyond
that toward the NCAAs," Gould
continued, "and you say, our rep
utation and performance (In Geor
gia) is such that people say, Oh
my God, here comes Stanford,'
and I wouldn't want to play us
then. But we have to get there.
"We're not far," he said. "We've
played most of the top teams.
We're coming along, like they say,
from injury recoveries and some of
the guys like Mark Jacobson have

improved their doubles. . . . We're
very, very close."
Stanford hosts USC, 7-0 in
Pacific-10 Southern Division play,
Friday at 1:30 p.m. The next day,
the Cardinal takes on UCLA in a
unique indoor/outdoor format.
Third through sixth singles and
second and third doubles will
begin at Stanford Tennis Stadium
at noon, with the rest of the
matches being played in Maples
Pavilion at 6:30 p.m.
At a press conference yesterday,
talk about the men's tennis team
ranged from great moments of the
past to great hopes for the future.
But for now, Stanford must con
centrate on the week at hand.
In a 1:30 p.m. match today at
the Stanford Tennis Stadium, the
Cardinal takes on second-ranked
Long Beach State in the first of
three straight matches against
the nation s top three teams.
Coach Dick Gould said it will
probably take at least two wins for
Stanford to be invited to the NCAA
championships next month in
Athens, Ga.
"This year they have 12 at-large
teams to increase the draw to 20,"
Gould said, "which gives us a
fighting chance. ... I think if we
beat one of these teams and beat
Cal (next week) we have an outside
chance, but I think we need to
beat two of these teams."
In the past, with a 16-teain field,
the NCAA selection committee has
never taken more than five teams
from the West Coast. Gould said
the number could go up to six this
year, but with No. 1 USC, Long

Beach State, No. 3 UCLA and No.
10 Pepperdine virtually
guaranteed berths, Stanford (11-
8) will be in a dogfight for the final
spot or spots with No. 1 1 Califor
nia, No. 17 UC-Irvine and the Uni
versity of San Diego, all of which
the Cardinal has lost to this year.
Fortunately. following a
nationwide example, those teams
have also beaten up on each other,
leaving the Cardinal, which is cur
rently out of the top 25 for the first
time since the computerized
rankings originated, in a position
to garner a berth if the team can
pull out some wins this week.
Long Beach State is 23-2, with
both losses coming to Stanford's
opponent Friday, USC. The 49ers
whipped the Cardinal here at
Stanford last year. 6-2, winning
five of six singles matches. They
boast four singles players in the
top 100, led by No. 7 Richard
Bergh. and two top-20 doubles
teams, which are led by No. 14
Bergh and Pat Hultgren.
"Long Beach just killed us in
singles last year," Gould said.
"Then they added another
Swedish player to complement
their No. 1 player, who is a

Swedish player. They are very ex
perienced in the rest of their
lineup. They're going to be very
tough. That's a must match for
us."
Stanford's Geordie McKee is on
a day-to-day basis due to a bruised
bone on the bottom of his foot,
and is doubtful for today's match.
Patrick McEnroe, who was the
Human Ice Bag after Saturday's
win over Arizona, will play despite
soreness in his left shoulder and
in his legs. Mentally, the Cardinal
appears as ready as it will ever be
for this week's matches.
"I think we're doing pretty well,"
Jeff Tarango said. "From what we
started with I think the team's im
proved a lot. I think we can do a lot
more still."
McEnroe agreed. "It's a good
challenge," he said. "I've felt all
along that we had a good chance
to beat some of the top schools,
and so far we haven't been able to,
but I think we have a good chance.
"We were kind of an underdog
last year in Athens," he said. "Not
