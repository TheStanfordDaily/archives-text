# Cardinal nine takes breather, travels north to battle Dons
## 
### TOM SENF Senior staff writer 
After taking two out of three
games from UCLA last weekend to
stake a one-game lead In the
Pacific 10 Southern Division,
Stanford baseball players were
given yesterday off by Coach Mark
Marquess.
Today may not prove to be much
more strenuous, as the Cardinal
faces 13-26 USF in a 2:30 p.m.
game at the Dons' Benedetti Dia
mond. Stanford and USF have met
once already this season, with the
Cardinal cruising to a 7-0 victory
on March 3 at Sunken Diamond.
Rob Wassenaar was the winning
pitcher that day. but It is unlikely
he will get another shot at the

Dons today. Wassenaar was a
busy man this weekend, throwing
a total of 10 2/3 Innings In two ap
pearances against UCLA, allowing
four runs and seven hits while
striking out 14.
On Sunday. Wassenaar relieved
Jim Price In the first inning and
threw eight innings of two-run,
four-hit baseball to key Stanford's
8-6 win. He does not, however, ex
pect to replace Price in the start
ing rotation.
"I'm pretty comfortable in a
rrH#»f rnle." Wassenaar said. "Jim
Price has been doing the job for us
all year. He's a really strong
pitcher. It was just one of those
days for him."
Sophomore right-hander Brian
Keyser (3-1. 4.91 ERA) did not

pitch last weekend and will likely
start today. Senior lefty A 1 Osuna
threw to just one UCLA batter, so
he should see action as well.
USF Coach Ken Bowman is ex
pected to send senior right
hander Mike Supple to the mound
today. Supple is 3-4 on the year
with a 5.94 ERA.
The Dons' record is less than
impressive, but USF has usually
managed to stay close. The Dons
have lost 10 one-run games on the
year.
Offensively, USF is led by fresh
man Arnie Sambel, who is hitting
.393, and senior shortstop Steve
Berriatua at .385,
Ruben Amaro continues to lead
the Cardinal attack. Another pro
ductive weekend (5-for-13 with
two homers) left the senior left
fielder's batting average at .353.
Third baseman Ed Sprague still
holds a narrow lead (nine to eight)
over right fielder Paul Carey in the
team home run race, but Sprague
has opened a large advantage in
RBls with 41 to Toi Cook's 29 and
Carey's 28.
On Thursday Stanford returns
to Six-Pac action. Marquess will
take his squad into Wildcat
country as the Cardinal visits
Arizona for a three-game series.
The Wildcats, who are the
defending NCAA champions, have
fallen on hard times, but are al
ways tough at home. Coach Jerry
Kindall's team will nevertheless
have a hard time returning to the
College World Series in Omaha
later this year.
In other Six-Pac contests later
this week. USC will host Califor

nla for a three-game series begin
ning Thursday, and UCLA will en
tertain Arizona State for three
games. whieh also begin
Thursday.
Card notes
Stanford currently leads UCLA by
one game In the Six-Pac but Is two
games ahead of the Bruins In the loss
column. The Cardinal Is 12-4 In league
play, while the Bruins are 12-6.
In other Stx-Pac action last
weekend. Arizona State (9-9) moved

into third place by taking two of three
from USC (8-10) in Tempe. California
(5-11) swept three from slumping
Arizona (6-12) In Berkeley to edge
closer to escaping the conference cellar
for the first time this year.
By beating UCLA twice. Stanford
moved from fifth to third In the ESPN
collegiate baseball poll and from
seventh to fourth in the Baseball
America rankings. The Bruins held
their No. 6 spot with Baseball America
but fell from eighth to ninth in the
ESPN collegiate poll.

After getting of to a l-for-27 start,
freshman Brian Johnson stroked two
sharp singles and a solid flyout on
Sunday to raise his average by 67
points. Johnson has had trouble
living up to expectations this season,
but anyone would have trouble living
up to the expectations created by the
all-time California home run king and
two-time state Player of the Year.
"People ask me what's wrong with
Brian, but there's nothing wrong with
him," Marquess said. "He's going to be
a great player."

managed to stay close. The Dons
have lost 10 one-run games on the
year.
Offensively, USF is led by fresh
man Arnie Sambel, who is hitting
.393, and senior shortstop Steve
Berriatua at .385,
Ruben Amaro continues to lead
the Cardinal attack. Another pro
ductive weekend (5-for-13 with
two homers) left the senior left
fielder's batting average at .353.
Third baseman Ed Sprague still
holds a narrow lead (nine to eight)
over right fielder Paul Carey in the
team home run race, but Sprague
has opened a large advantage in
RBls with 41 to Toi Cook's 29 and
Carey's 28.
On Thursday Stanford returns
to Six-Pac action. Marquess will
take his squad into Wildcat
country as the Cardinal visits
Arizona for a three-game series.
The Wildcats, who are the
defending NCAA champions, have
fallen on hard times, but are al
ways tough at home. Coach Jerry
Kindall's team will nevertheless
have a hard time returning to the
College World Series in Omaha
later this year.
In other Six-Pac contests later
this week. USC will host Califor

nla for a three-game series begin
ning Thursday, and UCLA will en
tertain Arizona State for three
games. whieh also begin
Thursday.
Card notes
Stanford currently leads UCLA by
one game In the Six-Pac but Is two
games ahead of the Bruins In the loss
column. The Cardinal Is 12-4 In league
play, while the Bruins are 12-6.
In other Stx-Pac action last
weekend. Arizona State (9-9) moved

into third place by taking two of three
from USC (8-10) in Tempe. California
(5-11) swept three from slumping
Arizona (6-12) In Berkeley to edge
closer to escaping the conference cellar
for the first time this year.
By beating UCLA twice. Stanford
moved from fifth to third In the ESPN
collegiate baseball poll and from
seventh to fourth in the Baseball
America rankings. The Bruins held
their No. 6 spot with Baseball America
but fell from eighth to ninth in the
ESPN collegiate poll.

After getting of to a l-for-27 start,
freshman Brian Johnson stroked two
sharp singles and a solid flyout on
Sunday to raise his average by 67
points. Johnson has had trouble
living up to expectations this season,
but anyone would have trouble living
up to the expectations created by the
all-time California home run king and
two-time state Player of the Year.
"People ask me what's wrong with
Brian, but there's nothing wrong with
him," Marquess said. "He's going to be
a great player."
