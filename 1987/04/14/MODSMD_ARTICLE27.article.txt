# Success Story
## $500 Million- All because of a careless error 
### 
Lewie Ford was once just an average Stanford freshman. He had a nice red bike, a Flicks season pass, three Stanford
sweatshirts, and a new pair of Vaurnets. Like most of his kind. Ford checked his mailbox twice a day. On the second round
one day, he found a surprise- he had been chosen to sit on 15 ASSU committees. Apparently, some meathead in the ASSU
(It's rumored to have been a drunk Phi Delt) accidentally typed in the wrong student number, placing Ford on a committee
instead of former COP President Mike Collins. (Ironically, Collins, feeling crushed and rejected because he didn't get on the
Committee of Six Thousand, went insane and ran for COP. Informed sources say he now crawls home from pubs every
night, muttering horrible things about ducks and sheep.) Furthermore, the ASSU meathead fell asleep, his nose hitting the
RETURN key, placing Ford on 14 more committees.
Feeling rather proud of himself, and thinking he was now obligated. Ford spent most of his sophomore year sitting in on
committee meetings. One particular committee interested Ford so much that he started to devote most of his time to it. He
spent hours writing, reading and thinking about the committee. As luck would have it, his amazing work and effort
brought him to the attention of some very important and influential people. One of those people was named Oliver North,
who happened to be doing research at the Hoover Institution at the time. Several months later. North somehow ended up
with an extra several million dollars that he had to dump somewhere. He used Lewie Ford's bank account. A few good in
vestments later, as well as several "hush" payments from North, and Ford's net worth was over $500 million, making him
the tenth richest man in the world. Said Ford on his success-- "Just imagine, a lin 15 chance that 1 would be on a commit
tee that I liked enough to work that hard. Damn good odds to become one of the richest men in the world."
