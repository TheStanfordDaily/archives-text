We asked our prize-winning reporting staff to interview a leading
bureaucrat to ask him why he, Jeff Soukup, reads the ASSU
News. We will also ask you nicely to vote for it today and tomor
row. (Well, one day will do.)
ASSU News: So, you like the ASSU News. Why?
Jeff Soukup: Because your mother does.
AN: No, really.
JS: Okay. I like it for its insightful, perceptive writing. Its hard
driving journalistic style. Its powerful but oh-so-thorough
opinion pieces. Its exciting, up-to-the-minute, turn-every-stone
investigative reporting.
AN: No, really.
JS: Okay, I like the News because it's the first, thing we've ever
tried in public information that worked. We did flyers; we did
dorm outreach, we did all that good stuf. We did it serious, nice,
jazzy, soft, whatever. No luck. Nobody paid attention — not be
cause the info, or student government itself, was inherently
terribe — basically no one was checking in because we weren't
doing it the right way.
AN: And this is it?
JS: You're reading it, aren't you?
AN: Yeah, but I don't know why.
JS: Because we print stuff people ought to be able to read in the
damn newspaper: how much of their money got given away and
to whom, what senators voted what way on what issues, what
decision-making committees of the University they can be mem
bers on, and what paid and volunteer jobs they can get managing
ASSU businesses. It's written in such a way as to make it fun to
read. The ASSU News is kind of like Juicy Fruit gum. It puts a
little hop in your step, a twinkle in your eye, and if you chew on
it too long your teeth will turn black.
AN: How much does this cost students?
JS: ASSU pays for half of it, so it only costs about 25 cents a quar
ter a person on the Special Fee. We come out 14 times a year and
get a special deal on the full pages. It turns out to cost about 5
cents an issue.
AN: How does this touch the average person's life?
JS: I think it dramatically affects it. People desperately need
something to read during class.
AN: What lies ahead for the ASSU News?
JS: Its life rests in the palm of each Stanford student. A yes vote
means, simply, continued life for a two-year-old infant. Don't be
a baby-killer.
