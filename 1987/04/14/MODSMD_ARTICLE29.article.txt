# The
						Little Itty Bitty Committee Ditty. It's witty.

This guy came into the COP office the other day as I was sitting on my bare carpet looking stupid without any
furniture around me and asked if I knew when the Panel on X, Y, and Z would be meeting next. Well, not really,
I told him. "Do you know when they usually meet?" Umm, their chair ought to know that, I think. "Well, can I
ask what happened at their last meeting?" Uhh, I hate to say this, but I'm afraid the students on that committee
haven't reported recently. "How can I find out what's going on?" Listen, I've got a student directory right here
... "Hey, man, do they pay you to be clueless?" Plenty, I said, and I hit him on the head and sent him off.
Yeah, the committee system is huge, tentacular, and fluxing. We can't keep a handle on what's going on in all
the different committees unless we really get our acts together. How can this be done?
We will hire Committee Staff Assistants as database administrators (I don't know what it means either, but it
sounds cool.) for next year to:
1) Read LOTS E-Mail committee members send after every ;meeting (see coupon below). Toss it off to a
printer and bind it. Call up the COP if anything especially frightening shows up.
2) Get each committee's University staff to send us a quick E-Message notification every time a meeting is
held, then send the minutes when they're available.
3) Cross-check every known committee meeting with every report from students so we can know who at
tending their meetings. KGB kind of stuff.
4) Report attendance rosters to the COP.
This should get close to fixing the problem. We'll know what's going on, when things meet, who to ca11... and
it'll all be on-line, too. Sort of "Macintized."
By the way, anyone want one of these jobs? We'll pay about $100 a month starting in October. Call Carey at
327-8648. Call him rude names and make disgusting noises.
