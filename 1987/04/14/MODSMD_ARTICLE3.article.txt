The Centennial Celebration Operating
Committee (CCOC) and the faculty have
agreed to cancel all classes after 2:15
p.m. Thursday, May 14 when Stanford
begins its 100 th anniversary celebration
of the laying of the cornerstone in the
Quad.
The event marks the beginning of a se
ries of ceremonies to continue through
1991, said CCOC Chairman Gerald
Lieberman, professor of operations re
search.
Lieberman said the decision to cancel
classes was made to encourage as many
students as possible to participate in

Thursday's events. "As a faculty member
with a class at 4:15 that day, I personally
think that this celebration is an appro
priate reason to not have class," Lieber
man said.
The celebration will begin at 2:15 p.m.
with a formal academic procession to
the Quad, where the rest of the events
will take place. The procession will be
"comparable to graduation," with all fac
ulty members in academic robes, said
Diana Diamond, assistant director of
University relations.
At 2:30 p.m.. the dedication ceremony
of the Centennial cornerstone will begin
on a stage placed in front of Memorial
Church, Liberman said. The stage will

hold 40 people and there will be room for
5,000 seated guests and 10,000 stand
ing, said Diamond.
Invitations have been sent out to
135,000 alumni, and an announcement
in a community report will inform 7,000
people from neighboring communities
of the events. Some 25,000 faculty mem
bers and students are invited also, Dia
mond said.
Featured speakers include the foreign
ministers of Canada, Mexico and the
United States. "This is the first time in
history that foreign ministers of these
three northern and central American
countries will meet," Diamond said.
