Not really. He's actually quite a hairy young knight.
The following two committees have been criticized as ineffective and nonexistent (this is even worse than
what is said about us. At least we exist). Therefore, the ASSU is considering not confirming any nominees to
these committees. Here are the facts. It is up to you to decide whether or not these are indeed valid committees
and worth applying for. Or mess everything up and be the only one to apply.
Ineffective: Commission on Investment Responsibility
The C-IR is supposed to aid the trustees in executing the Trustees' reported policy of selective divestment. Un
der a policy of selective divestment, determinations must be made between companies who are deemed net
good actors and those who are net negative actors. From these determinations, divestment and proxy vote deci
sions are supposed to be made. Herein lies the basic structural flaw that keeps the C-IR from functioning, in any
meaningful way, as it should. The Trustees insist on a case by case approach to selectivie divestment. With such
an approach, the C-IR must make some sort of evaluation of a company's performance on the apartheid issue.
The C-IR is not permitted to rely on the Sullivan ratings in making such decisions. Instead, the members of the
C-IR are forced to attempt to come up with their own criteria and judge relative corporate performance. This is a
job that simply cannot be accomplished in a legistimate or expeditious fashion from here in Palo Alto. For the
Trustees to insist upon such an approach does not reflect a desire to deal fairly with each company, but rather
serves only to cripple any potentially positive influence the C-Ir might have ...
The C-IR can only do what the Trustees will allow it. The Trustees must allow the C-IR to use objective criteria
when setting an investment policy. Guidelines for new investment, must also be set. This must happen before
the Stanford community can believe that the Trustees are serious about selective divestment. There is no indica
tion that such changes in Trustee policy will be forthcoming. That is way we are seeking to pull the student
members from the commission. We feel students should not be a part of the Trustees' cynical window-dressing
of a very serious issue.

Non-Existent: Committee of Fifteen
The Committee of Fifteen cannot meet unless it is called upon to convene. There are only three ways that this
can occur: a vote of the Faculty Senate, a referendum of the student body, and a call by the president of the Uni
versity. The last time this committee met was in the spring of the 1983-84 school year. This committee exists to
write changes to the legislative and judicial charter, a valid function but not a frequently occuring one.
Therefore, perhaps students should be appointed to this committee only after we're sure that the committee will
actually meet. But that would make too much sense.
