# Card golf twelfth at Intercollegiate
## 
### ROBERT PORTNOY Staff writer 
After a 14th-place finish In this
weekend's Fresno Pepsi Classic,
the Stanford men's golf team
stands 12th out of 24 teams after
yesterday's first round of one of
the biggest events of the year, the
Western Intercollegiate In Santa
Cruz.
The Cardinal was carried by
freshman Mark Funseth, who
blistered the Pasatlempo Golf
Club course to the tune of an even
par 71, good for a fifth-place tie
with four other golfers.
"Funseth played a really good
round. He could have shot even
better. It was one of the better
rounds of the year. It's one of the
toughest courses we play," Stan
ford Coach Tim Schaaf said.
"Since I've been here we've never
had a round under 70. He's only
played the course once before, in
our practice round Thursday. It's
a good thing, too, because the
others were pretty high," Schaaf
added.
The back nine on Pasatiempo's
6,700-yard layout did in the other
Stanford golfers. Freshman Steve
White, sophomore John Mahon
and junior Rich Marek all were
just one-over-par after 10 holes,
only to see their scores balloon to
78, 77 and 76, respectively.
"John, Steve and Rich all played
well to the turn, then gave back a
lot of strokes on the back nine. At
the turn we were playing really
well. They just had some shots not
work out the way they were in
tended. They just came a cropper

(unglued) on the back nine,"
Schaaf noted.
The course was playing much
tougher than the front nine scores
indicate. Many of Stanford's
poorer rounds in past tourna
ments have left the team so close
to the bottom there was no hope of
a high finish. Here, Stanford trails
the No. 8 team, UCLA, by just
eight strokes.
A surprising California team is
leading the tournament. The
Bears, whose golf history previous
to this season would not place
many names in the "Who's Who of
College Athletics," have turned
their program around in the last
18 months. In fact, the Bears had
never beaten Stanford In a golf
tournament previous to this
season. Then, beginning this fall,
they bested Stanford five con
secutive times before the Cardinal
hosted the Stanford U.S. Intercol
legiate the first week of this
month.
"They're really establishing
themselves as a power in college
golf, and it's a sign of greater Bay
Area strength in college golf.
They're legitimate and we'll have
to reckon with them for some
time. They have a set team and
we've sort of been in a rebuilding
process this year, so there will be a
greater motivation to get them in
the future," Schaaf said.
Cal stands at 362, just two
strokes ahead of San Jose State.
SJSU is the host of the tourna
ment, and they know the
Pasatlempo course as well as
anyone. Santa Barbara is four
shots behind the Spartans, with

Arizona another stroke back. BYU
is at 370 along with Fresno State.
Washington is at 371, the Bruins
at 375 and USC at 377.
The individual tournament is
led by Spartan Paul Ditsche at 68,
tied with UCLA's Rich Greenwood.
Cal's Ben Furth is at 69, as is
Kevin Sutherland of Fresno State.

Paul Holtbey of UCSB is one of
four tied with Stanford's Funseth
at 71. The other three are Mark
Sanchez and Heath Whitmore of
Cal, and O.D. Vincent of Washing
ton. Stanford's other two individ
uals participating are freshman
Brad Benbrook and sophomore
Roger Miraglia, at 80 and 83.
