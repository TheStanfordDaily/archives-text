# Card cyclists finish second over weekend
## 
### WITOLD HENISZ 
So far this season, the Stanford
cycling team has taken pride in Its
criterium results and travel
habits, but until this past
weekend the Cardinal had not
proven itself as a team capable of
dominating a road race.
On an unusual weekend with
two road races and no criteriums,
Stanford managed second place
overall in a competition that
featured over a dozen schools. The
finish strengthened the Cardinal's
season standing, and proved
strange travel habits don't hurt
that much.
After a few hours of restful
sleep, the team was rudely
suprised by a blast of artic air at
the usually tropical Kings City and
San Ardo road race courses.
Stanford more than survived in
the 40 to 45 degree early morning
temperatures. The Cardinal came
in third on Saturday with 134
points to UC-Santa Barbara's 184
and Cal Poly-San Luis Obispo's
140. At San Ardo on Sunday,
Stanford came out the victor, out
scoring UCSB by 9 and Cal Poly by
19.
Tom Moyer dominated the
sprint of each 'A' race in charac
teristic style. Moyer finished third

In both races, outdistancing the
field In the final 100 yards.
Charles Dart 111 had similar suc
cess In the 'B* races. Dart finished
second on Saturday and third on
Sunday to lead the young Cardinal
'B' team to strong finishes.
Eugene Sargent and John
Chang also rode well. Sargent and
Chang finished directly behind
Dart for a Cardinal 2-3-4 finish on
Saturday. Sargent also finished in
the points along with Brian Bauer
on Sunday.
Former 'B' rider Brock La Porte
enjoyed the more controlled and
smoother riding of the 'A' pack as
he placed fifth on Sunday.
Stanford riders Robert Borchers
and John Moffet also scored
points for the *A' team. Moffet
crashed at the line on Saturday
when a Cal Poly rider swerved in
front of him but was awarded the
place of the rider at fault. Moffet
was not badly hurt.
Steve Miller has climbed to the
top of the 'C' field in only a few
weeks. His sixth place finish on
Saturday followed by a second
place on Sunday clearly mark him
as a force on the team along with
John Shinn, who finished 16th
and sixth.
Jennifer Hubbert scored points
for Stanford In the women's race
on Sunday.
