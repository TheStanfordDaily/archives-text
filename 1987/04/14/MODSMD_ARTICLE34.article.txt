# Rush surviving IFC guidelines
## 
### MARCUS MABRY Senior staff writer 
Interfraternity Council (IFC) guidelines have not
affected adversely this year's fraternity Rush as oppo
nents of the plan initially feared, according to IFC
President Steve Singleton.
When Rush opened last week two. aspects of the
new guidelines went into effect: All rushees had to
have special IFC-issued Rush cards and all fraterni
ties were restricted from serving hard alcohol.
The guidelines stipulate that this week of Rush
will be completely free of alcohol and Rush cards will
again be required of all those wishing to attend any
Rush event.
Opponents of the guidelines originally argued that
requiring rushees to go out of their way to pick up
the cards would decrease the number of people at
tending Rush functions.
Singleton said he considers the guidelines
"successful."
He noted that the first week of Rush is usually the
rowdiest because there are more people rushing than
in the following weeks. And the fact that this year's
first week passed without incident showed the new
guidelines are effective. Singleton said.
Singleton said it was in the first week of last year's
Rush that an incident occurred related to the Delta
Upsilon fraternity that contributed to that fraternity
losing University and national recognition.
He said there have been no reports of incidents of
violence or disturbances involving Rush, nor of in
fractions against the new guidelines.
"I have heard no complaints from police or the
community," he said. "We have survived the first
week and I think that was a real success."
He emphasized that he will have a better idea of the

effects of the guidelines when he talks to representa
tives and Rush chairmen at Thursday's regular IFC
meeting.
Singleton said he believed that last week's party at
tendance was not lower because of Rush cards. He
observed that during the two nights of parties which
he monitored, parties were "if anything, bigger than
last year's."
He estimated that over 500 Rush cards have been
distributed.
Junior Tom Schoaf. Sigma Chi Rush chairman,
said the cards have been beneficial, noting that they
have cut down the number of "randoms" attending
Rush activities and have brought out a group of rus
hees who are more genuinely interested in fraternity
life.
"Last week we had just as good a showing as last
year and the people there were genuinely interested
in Rush," Schoaf said.
He added that this week's dry Rush should not sig
nificantly affect parties because they are all being
held in the afternoons and fewer people would drink
in the afternoons anyway.
Alpha Delta Phi Rush Chairman Steve Moore, a
sophomore, was unwilling to predict how the new
guidelines will affect Rush in the long run. But he re
ported that Rush cards and prohibition of alcohol
did not affect last week's Rush events "one way or the
other," adding that Alpha Delta Phi has never had to
deal with the kind of problems the cards are
supposed to alleviate.
He also said that the dry week will not affect this
week's events at his fraternity.
"We are going to have a fun week in spite of the dry
Rush. We'll use our creative energies to overcome it,"
Moore said.
