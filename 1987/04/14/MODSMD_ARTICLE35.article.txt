### JIM DEWANE 
The Concert Network will bring
the Grateful Dead to Frost Ampit
heater again this spring, with af
ternoon shows on May 2 and 3.
The performances should last
three hours or longer, "depending
on how long the band wants to
play," according to Phil Klein, staff
supervisor of the Concert Net
work,
The Concert Network has
brought Grateful Dead shows to
Stanford the past several springs.
"They've gone fine," Klein said
of past shows. But he cited hot
weather as a potential problem for
concert-goers. "We get the usual
five or six dehydrations" yearly, he
said. Klein added that although
there was one arrest last year,
there are "usually no arrests" at
Grateful Dead shows.

For next month's Dead shows,
mail-order tickets priced at
>17.50 may be purchased by call
ing the Grateful Dead hotline at
457-6388.
Student tickets will go on sale at
the Tresldder ticket office on April
20 for >15.50 for Stanford stu
dents who bring identification.
Student IDs must also be pre
sented for admission to the
shows, Klein said. Tresldder will
have 2,500 tickets for each show.
They will be sold exclusively to
Stanford students, faculty and
staff on April 20 and 21.
The Concert Network was
formed to bring entertainment to
campus. Recent productions in
clude a series of comedy shows
throughout the year and two per
formances by jazz musician Stan
ley Jordan last week.
