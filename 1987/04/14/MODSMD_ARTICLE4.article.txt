# Trustees to decide on three CIR evaluations
## 
### DIANE BISGEIER Senior staff writer 
A University Board of Trustees committee
will consider today recommendations made
by the Commission on Investment Respon
sibility (CIR) last week on three corpora
tions with dealings in South Africa .
The CIR is recommending the trustees'
Special Committee on Investment Respon
sibility (SCIR) vote "yes" on shareholder
resolutions calling for Ingersoll-Rand Co.
and Timken Co. to withdraw from South
Africa but to vote "no" on a similar resolu
tion for Pfizer Inc., which the CIR described
as "consistently" having top Sullivan
ratings. Ingersoll-Rand has a Sullivan
rating of three and Timken has not signed
the Sullivan Principles.
The SCIR is a committee appointed by the
trustees to make decisions regarding Uni
versity divestments and disinvestments.
The recommendations mark the second
round of a series of considerations the SCIR
will make regarding University divestment

and disinvestment in 60 corporations with
operations in South Africa. In examining
each corporation, the CIR will advise the
SCIR on shareholder resolutions calling for
withdrawal from South Africa.
The CIR, in advising the SCIR, bases its
decisions on several criteria, including the
Sullivan Principles. Designed in 1977 by
Rev. Leon H. Sullivan "to promote social
justice," the principles advocate anti
apartheid lobbying and placement of
blacks, coloreds and Asians in management
and supervisory positions.
Each company that operates in South
Africa is given a Sullivan rating by Arthur
D. Little, Inc. The corporations are assigned
ratings of one, two and three, signifying
good, adequate or poor progress,
respectively.
Ingersoll-Rand is one of only three of the
60 corporations with dealings in South
Africa in the Stanford portfolio that carries
a Sullivan rating of three. Additionally,
