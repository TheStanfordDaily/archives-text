# ASSU elections today
## 
### MARCUS MABRY Senior staff writer 
Today is election day.
In the next 48 hours, registered Stanford
students at home and abroad will have the
opportunity to vote in the ASSU elections.
They will duly elect their representatives
and decide on referendums and fee assess
ments.
Additionally, in order to receive refunds
from the ASSU next year, students must
vote today or tomorrow.
Voters will elect a new Council of Presi
dents (COP), the administrative branch of
the ASSU.
In addition to providing the most ac
knowledged voiceÂ«of the student body's con
cern and opinion, the COP partially estab
lishes the agenda of student political and
economic action for the year.
Hoping to capture the electorate's hearts
and, consequently, this title are four slates:
The Equalizers, Philosopher Kings, The
Plan and Slate Of The Union.
ASSU senators will also be selected today.
Voters will choose 10 undergraduates
