### ERIN MARTIN Staff writer 
"Hey. we've got only five minutes
left." shouted X-TV student en
gineer Kevin Lehman.
All else was calm in the new Pine
Hall studio last night as staffers
awaited the premiere of the new
student-run channel at Stanford.
Programming began with a
spoof soap opera. "General Dor
mitory." followed by close-up
sports coverage, on-the-spot stu
dent interviews and promotional
advertisements of candidates run
ning for ASSU Council of Presi
dents.

General Manager Alex Danel. a
senior, said he was excited about
the first airing. "It is the culmina
tion of a long haul." he said.
"Our goal is to build an organi
zation that gives people the crea
tive opportunity to both operate

and watch a student channel."
Danel said.
Student opinions of the pro
gramming varied greatly. "The
station could be a useful vehicle
for exchanging ideas." said senior
Anne Farnham. "1 think it's a good
thing."
But economics graduate stu
dent Alec Rawls called parts of the
station's programming "terribly
inane."
"I saw a few minutes of the soap
opera and moved far away from
the TV. The gymnastics clips were
good, though." Rawls said.
Some students joked about the
station's future capabilities. "I
think it's a great way to dis
seminate anti-administration
propaganda." said senior Felicia
Keesing.
Wink Thorne, former program
ming director, said the station
"started out with a few core people
who were part of SITN (Stanford
Instructional Television Network)

and wanted a student channel. It
was only a dream three quarters
ago."
Broadcast over the SUNet cable
system, the station (channel 10 on
the dial) began to acquire filming
and production equipment winter
quarter. The station obtained lim
ited funding from the ASSU Pro
gramming Board and donations
from the Stanford Engineering
Association.
Danel said that the station used
the funds to buy and lease equip
ment necessary for production.
"Most of our equipment came
from SITN." Danel said.
"Our equipment is held together
with chewing gum." Lehman said.
Co-chief Announcer Palmer
Colamarino. a senior, stressed the
experimental nature of last night's
showing and tonight's airing from
7 to 9 p.m. "We hope that these
two trial runs will be seen by lots
of people, either in the dorms or at
the Coffee House."
