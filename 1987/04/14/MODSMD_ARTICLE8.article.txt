Tutu defies new government laws
JOHANNESBURG, South Africa — Archbishop Desmond Tutu
defied new government regulations yesterday by urging South
Africans to join him in calling for the release of thousands of poli
tical detainees imprisoned here without trial.
Tutu, the Anglican archbishop of Cape Town, was joined by
other Protestant. Catholic and Jewish religious leaders In a dra
matic challenge to South Africa's white-led minority government.
Over the weekend, the government had prohibited all protests
against its practice of detaining anti-apartheid activists and other
political opponents and holding them without charge, sometime
for periods approaching a year and often in solitary confinement.
Tutu, whose defiance of the new rules drew the support of U.S.
Ambassador Edward Perkins, courted arrest by making his public
statement. But later in the day, the government backed down on
the explosive issue.
"I will urge my congregations to launch a campaign, a peaceful
and non-violent campaign, whatever the consequences." Tutu
said. He described the government's new regulations as immoral,
totalitarian and "blasphemous," and added:
"Christians cannot obey them without dishonoring God. I warn
the government again to just remember one thing: You are power
ful — perhaps very powerful, even — but you are not God. You are
mere mortals. Beware when you take on the church of God.
Others have tried and have bitten the dust."
Honecker won't visit West Berlin
BONN, West Germany — East German chief of state Erich
Honecker, in a decision viewed as a setback to recent efforts to im
prove relations between the two Germanys, yesterday turned
down an invitation for a precedent-setting visit to West Berlin this
month.
East Germany's official news agency, ADN, said Honecker's
decision was partly in reprisal for an effort last summer by West
Berlin Mayor Eberhard Diepgen to discourage West German politi
cal leaders from visiting East Berlin.
West German and West Berlin officials called this "an excuse,"
however, and said privately they believed that the Soviet Union
had barred Honecker from making the trip.
Diepgen invited Honecker a month ago to attend the official cer
emony in West Berlin on April 30 marking Berlin's 750 th anniver
sary. No East German chief of state has visited West Berlin, so the
trip would have been a significant sign of improved relations.
Israeli soldiers kill demonstrator
JERUSALEM — Israeli soldiers yesterday opened fire on Arab
demonstrators outside a university campus in the occupied West
Bank, killing one, while security forces rounded up dozens of
Palestinians suspected of organizing and planning disturbances
in the area.
Israeli authorities later ordered the Bir Zeit University campus,
where the shooting occurred, closed for four months and imposed
military curfews on at least three West Bank towns and refugee
camps. They said the moves, coupled with the predawn arrests,
were designed to stamp out the violence that has plagued the
region for more than two weeks and resulted in the firebombing
death Saturday night of an Israeli woman from one of the area's
Jewish settlements.
The army spokesman said the students threw rocks, burned
tires and blocked roadways leading to the campus. When soldiers
arrived, they were pelted with rocks and bottles, the spokesman
said, and opened fire with tear gas and rubber bullets to disperse
the rioters. When that did not work and the troops felt endan
gered. he said, they fired with live ammunition into the crowd.
University officials said at a press conference that the soldiers
had fired without provocation and continued firing for several
minutes.
Hart announces official candidacy
DENVER — Former Colorado Sen. Gary Hart formally an
nounced his candidacy for the Democratic presidential nomina
tion yesterday, vowing to combat greed, corruption and mis
management in order to pursue his vision of "the national inter
est."
Hart said that he is seeking the presidency simply because "I
love my country."
Hart, whose 1984 candidacy was a long shot when he chal
lenged Walter Mondale for the Democratic nomination, this time
is the acknowledged Democratic front-runner. He earned that po
sition by his surprisingly strong showing in 1984 and con
solidated it by issuing numerous statments on domestic and in
ternational issues over the past two years.
Hart is the third candidate to formally join the Democratic pres
idential competition, joining former Arizona Gov. Bruce Babbitt
and Rep. Richard Gephardt of Missouri.
Politically. Hart faces the task of uniting behind him the diverse
elements of the traditional Democratic coalition, some of whom,
notably organized labor, bitterly opposed his candidacy in 1984.
And he still must explain himself to those Democratic primary
voters who regarded him in 1984 as a remote and enigmatic fig
ure, in part because he dissembled about his age and his family
name, which was changed to Hart from Hartpence.
Convicted kidnapper escapes
PASADENA — Law enforcement officials searched Monday for a
convicted kidnapper sentenced to four life terms who escaped
from a court lock-up facility and hobbled away in leg chains to a
waiting pickup truck.

9 a.m. Monday from the Los Angeles County Superior Court build
ing in Pasadena. Los Angeles sheriffs Deputy Bob Nimtz said.

cell, as the convict, who was wearing leg shackles, escaped from
the facility and into the waiting pickup. Fosselman said

years for several other crimes including armed robbery, kidnap
ping. kidnapping for ransom, grand theft, and various weapons
