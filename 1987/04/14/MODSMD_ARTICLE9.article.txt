# Shultz and Schevardnadze meet
## 
### 
MOSCOW — Secretary of State George
Shultz and Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard
Shevardnadze held almost seven hours of in
tensive talks, including an unscheduled even
ing session, on embassy "bugging." human
rights and arms control issues yesterday
before setting up seven working groups to ex
plore the rights and arms issues in greater
detail today.
State Department spokesman Charles Red
man refused to say what aspects of the sensa
tional embassy espionage incidents were dis
cussed or whether the issue would be explored
further. However, Tass, the official Soviet gov
ernment news agency, said that the two sides
were examining "conditions for the work of
their embassies and diplomatic missions on
the territory of the other side."
Redman characterized the daylong talks as
"serious and businesslike," adding that "the
two (men) worked energetically toward getting
through a very long agenda." He would not say
whether progress had been made during the
day.
The proliferation of expert working groups,
five in arms control areas, indicated that no
obvious impasse had yet occurred. But it did
not mean that the three days of talks will end
with a notable success, such as agreement in
principle on how to reduce or eliminate both
categories of intermediate-range nuclear
missiles in Europe.

The two sides have agreed in principle to
eliminate the longer-range missiles from
Europe while retaining 100 warheads each in
this category. But they are seriously divided
over the shorter-range category of
intermediate-range missiles, where the Soviets
hold a monopoly. Moscow wants them frozen
at current unequal levels, while the United
States wants the right to equal levels.
Shultz took time from the meetings to call at
a Seder, or Jewish Passover dinner, being held
at Spasso House, the U.S. ambassador's
residence here, which was attended by about
35 "refuseniks" — those who have been denied
permission to emigrate. Shultz is the highest
ranking U.S. official to meet with Moscow
dissidents since the human rights movement
began here more than two decades ago.
While the embassy "bugging" row cast a
shadow over Shultz's visit, it did not appear to
interfere significantly with his itinerary. He is
scheduled to meet today with Soviet Premier
Nikolai Ryzhkov on economic issues and with
Soviet Communist Party leader Mikhail Gorba
chev before resuming talks with Shevardnadze
in the evening.
To ensure secure communications, however,
a special van was set up for Shultz's messages
to Washington and for meetings with his staff.
First on Shultz's agenda of talks, a U.S. offi
cial said, was "the problem created by Soviet
espionage" against the U.S. Embassy, which

was taken up between the two men with only
translators and note-takers present. Shultz
has accused the Soviets of recruiting Marine
guards to help them gather intelligence at the
embassy and has described the Reagan admin
istration as "damned upset."
With their experts, Shultz and
Shevardnadze then took up human rights and
humanitarian concerns, with a "full and ex
tensive exchange" that covered both individual
cases as well as general considerations, he
said.
They agreed to set up the first of the working
groups of experts on human rights issues. A
second group will deal with bilateral Issues.
During the afternoon and evening sessions,
they discussed five arms control Issues and
created working groups to deal with them.
Foremost were the three topics currently being
negotiated in Geneva: offensive intercontinen
tal missiles and bombers, anti-missile space
defenses and an INF (Intermediate Nuclear
Forces)treaty.
The INF issue is widely regarded as ripe for
settlement within the next few months and
likely to produce a summit meeting at which
President Reagan and Gorbachev would sign
it.
Two other topics — nuclear-weapons testing
and risk-reduction centers — were the basis
for the final two groups.
