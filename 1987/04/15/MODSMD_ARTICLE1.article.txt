### ANDREW PATZMAN Editorial staff 
An unidentified male attacked a woman walking
alone near the Physics Tank Monday night. In an as
sult police say Is "almost identical" to one that oc
curred last week.
"It was very possibly the same person involved in
both attacks," Stanford Police Chief Marvin Her
rington said yesterday."In both cases, the attacker
came up from behind and used a sharp Instrument,"
Herrington said.
Noting that robbery was not attempted in either at
tack, Herrington called sexual assault a possible
motive In both cases.
Herrington said Stanford police "are taking some
steps" to Increase security on campus, but declined
to discuss details.
Like the earlier attack, which took place last Wed
nesday, the assault Monday occurred in the mall be
tween the Physics Tank and the Earth Sciences
Building, Herrington said. "It was very close to the
same spot."
The victim in Monday's assault, a Stanford em
ployee. was not injured in the attack, which took
place "between 9:30 and 10:00 p.m.," Herrington
said.
According to Herrington, the woman was walking
alone when the attacker "came from behind and
grabbed her." Although he threatened her with
"some kind of sharp instrument." Herrington said
the woman mangaged to escape from the attacker
"pretty quickly."
"She came back with her elbow and hit him, and
knocked him to the ground," Herrington said. "Then
she ran to her car, drove to Palo Alto and called us."
According to police, Monday's victim described her
assailant as a white male adult in his early 20s,
about 5-foot-11. 160 pounds, of medium build, with
"sandy blond or light brown hair." He was wearing
blue jeans and a dark long-sleeved shirt.
The description of Monday's assailant is "pretty
close to the description of the previous attacker,"
Herrington said. "We think it's probably the same
guy.".
The first assault occurred about 6:45 p.m. last
Wednesday. The victim suffered minor cuts on her
arm and hand and a bloody nose, but refused medi
cal treatment.
Herrington warned students and staff to "be cau
tious on campus at night," especially in the "mall
areas near the Quad."
"It's pretty deserted around those places at night,"
he said. "You don't have any traf
fic flow In those areas except
bicycles, and there aren't many
bicycles at night."
Herrlngton advised students
that if they have to go out, to go
out with a friend. He said stu
dents should not go out alone
"Both of these cases happened
when the victim was totally alone.
Apparently this person (the at
tacker) was waiting until the vic
tim was completely alone before he
attacked," Herrlngton added.
