# In ant-icipation of the spring
## 
### 
One day last quarter, I was doodling at my
desk when a small reddish ant wandered onto
my pad of paper. I watched it for a while and
eventually decided to squish it. Just as my
thumb was in position over his tiny body, I
heard a high-pitched voice.
"Don't kill me, please."
I looked in amazement at the insect. Surely
this ant wasn't speaking to me. Feeling silly, I
put my head on my desk and looked at the ant.
It blinked and waved one of its antenna.

"Excuse me?" I said.
"Please don't kill me," the tiny voice
repeated. This time I saw the ant's mouth
move. I was stunned. Here was a tiny creature,
Its brain no larger than the head of a pin,
speaking to me.
"Oh," I stammered. "I'm terribly sorry. I
didn't mean ... I didn't know . . . What I mean
is . . . Wow. you're a talking ant!"
The ant sighed visibly. "Yes, I am. Everyone
in my family can talk."
"Your family?" I was confused.
"Formicldae. We are colonial hymenopterous
Insects with a complex social organization and
various castes performing special duties. Don't
you ever read your dictionary?" The ant
paused and then continued. "My special duty
is that of communicator ant. I've been sent by
the council to talk to you."

"The council? What council?"
"Never mind," the ant replied. "It's too com
plex. I've come to ask your permission to live
here."
"Here, on my desk?"
"No, no, in this room. It's rainy and cold
outside, and we aren't very happy. Our scouts
noticed that you had a fairly large room and
that you rarely vacuum the carpet. I'm here to
talk you into extending your home to the
homeless."
"You want to live in my room, with me?"
"Yes, we do, and we're asking very nicely."
Well, I'll skip the rest of the conversation. He
was an eloquent and convincing ant, so I
decided to let him and his family stay. Unfor
tunately, I had little previous experience
negotiating with ants and was unaware how
large an ant family is. When I came back to my
room that evening, the place was — quite
literally — crawling with ants. My radio was
playing while a large number of the little in
sects were trying to put a tape in my stereo.
Other ants had tipped over my garbage can
and were swarming around an old banana
peel. Several ants were laboriously turning the
pages of a comic book and laughing. There
were ants everywhere.
"What's going on here?" I shouted. The room
became quiet. "What are all you bugs doing?"
My friend the communicator ant was still on
the desk.
"Not bugs — formicldae. We were only
having a small party to celebrate our good
fortune. Is there a problem?"
Just at that moment, the door was pushed
open and several hundred ants staggered In —
carrying on their backs a bottle of beer. They
set it at my feet.

"That's for you," the ant on the desk said. I
could think of nothing to say as a second troop
of ants dropped a bottle opener at my feet. I
bent down and picked up the beer. It was cold.
"Oh, I almost forgot. We ordered a pizza, too.
I hope you like pepperonl."
After much negotiation, I got about half of
the ants to move out of my room and into the
kitchen. With the other half. I made a deal. I
wouldn't endanger their lives by vacuuming
my carpet as long as they wouldn't even think
about going near my bed. You have to draw the
line somewhere. From then on, we got along
nicely.
There is a point to this story. Winter quarter
is finally over and the sun shines brightly. The
flowers and trees are beginning to bloom. Skin
has appeared all over campus: scantily clad
bodies soak up the sun in the afternoons and
become tanner and tanner. Freshmen from
back East shake their heads and can't believe
they ever considered Harvard. And. just when 1
was growing fond of my little friends, they left.
It's time to go, they said. We want to be out in
the sun. too. I felt tears In my eyes as they all
filed out my window in a long black line. I
would miss their company. And yet. it was also
a happy occasion. Just like the robins arriving
from the south, or the swallows returning to
Caplstrano. my ants left — signaling that
spring was truly here. My last quarter at Stan
ford. I dusted off my bathing suit and followed
them out9ide.
Welcome to spring quarter; It's a wonderful
thing.
