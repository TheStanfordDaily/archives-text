# Endorsements biased
## 
### 
We are writing to make known to students publicly
what we have seen in watching The Daily make
recommendations on special fees, referendums and
Council of Presidents slates. Their recommendations
are read by thousands and thousands of people on
this campus, and we think it is important that stu
dents who will vote know the truth. The Daily's en
dorsements are in many cases dangerously factually
uninformed, prepared in a way that is unprofes
sional and unfair to candidates, and contain deep
biases that The Daily does not mention.

FUENTES, et al.

We have talked to many candidates and sponsors
of special fees who interviewed with The Daily one
week ago. Here is what they say:
□ First, when student groups went in for recommen
dations for their special fees many were shocked to
find that the members of The Daily edit board who
showed up did not know anything about the organi
zations. They did not read the budgets beforehand
and did not even know how much the groups are
asking for until — or even after — the interview.
□ Second, the members of the edit board did not
take the interviews at all seriously — even though
they must have known they were playing with the fu
ture of student organizations and their ability to
survive. Several sponsors and candidates com
plained that the interviewers were rude and did not
seem to care or listen. This is not the way to decide
on issues of hundreds of thousands of dollars or on
the candidates who will be elected to work for stu
dents.
□ Third, we have talked to three years' worth of
people who have gone to The Daily for endorsements
and the only trend we can pick out in The Daily's
recommendations is that when they have a choice
they will always pick the candidates who hate the
ASSU the most. This is what the candidates say as
well — both those who are picked and those who are
not picked — and they know because they have gone
to the interviews and talked with the edit board. The

same is true for special fees — particularly for new
projects (even though The Daily in the previous years
has always called for new projects). These are not the
right criteria to to use in recommending to the stu
dents what the best choices are.
These things are wrong. The Daily is the campus
newspaper and has the right to print anything it
wants. But it also has the responsibility to print the
truth. If it is printing opinion and calling it informed
opinion, it has the responsibility to make sure that
thought has been given to the issues. This means
that The Daily edit board must do more than show
up for the interviews and pick people at random,
pick the people they decide they personally like or
pick people based on one-tenth of the facts.
You may not always agree with the ASSU Senate's
recommendations either — that's why we have elec
tions every year to replace senators who are not rep
resentative — but at least the senate gives careful
thought to the things it makes recommendations on.
Senators on the appropriations committee, for ex
ample, spent several hours during winter quarter on
each of the questions on the ballot. Those issues
were then debated by 40 people in a public forum
where anyone could come, listen and watch what
went on. The ASSU didn't try to do everything ad hoc
in one weekend like The Dally did.
You see. The Daily cannot be held accountable be
cause it has a near monopoly on information and
uses it. We can't wait to see what headline they stick
on this piece by the way. We bet it will be something
nice like "Daily endorsements only part of the
picture." Compare that with the title we submitted:
"Daily recs uninformed and biased."
We think we've all wasted enough time reading
Daily endorsements. Go decide on the issues yourself
— think about what matters to you, talk to the candi
dates, read their material, read the election hand
book and make a thoughtful decision if you care. Do
all the things the campus newspaper failed to do.
Then vote and know you've had a responsible effect.

and Carey White, members of the ASSU Council oj
Presidents; George Cuervas, ASSU senator; and
David Moguel, member of the Chicano Student Ac
tivities Committee.
