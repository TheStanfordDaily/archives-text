# SCIR is not responsive to divestment concerns

Pull students
out of the CIR
The Committee on Investment Responsibility (CIR)
was created with the intention that it serve as advi
ser to the University Board of Trustees' Special Com
mission on Investment Responsibility (SCIR) for
South Africa-related investment decisions. The CIR
consists of faculty, students, staff and alumni. It is
the body that does the primary research on the cor
porations in the Stanford portfolio that have South
African connections. The CIR is supposed to aid the
trustees in executing the trustees' reported policy of
selective divestment.

VAN LOBEN SELS

Under a policy of selective divestment, determina
tions must be made between companies that are
deemed net good actors and those that are net
negative actors. From these determinations, divest
ment and proxy vote decisions are supposed to be
made. Herein lies the basic structural flaw that keeps
the CIR from functioning as it should. The trustees
insist on a case-by-case approach to selective divest
ment. With such an approach, the CIR must make
some sort of evaluation of a company's performance
on the apartheid issue. The CIR is not permitted to
rely on the Sullivan ratings in making such deci
sions. Instead, the members of the CIR are forced to
attempt to come up with their own criteria and judge
relative corporate performance. This is a job that
simply cannot be accomplished in a legitimate or ex
peditious fashion from here in Palo Alto. For the
trustees to insist upon such an approach does not
reflect a desire to deal fairly with each company, but
rather serves only to cripple any potentially positive
influence the CIR might have.

The functional reality of trustee actions on CIR
recommendations has been nothing short of shame
ful. As meager and slow as the CIR recommendations
necessarily have been, the SCIR often just casually
disregarded those recommendations — even for the
very worst companies in the portfolio. Last week the
CIR called for a "yes" vote on disinvestment proxy
resolutions for Goodyear and NCR. two of the very
worst performers in the portfolio by any standard.
The SCIR blithely rejected the CIR without explana
tion. Instead, the trustees came back with a recom
mendation that the CIR not vote on all proxy resolu
tions — only the ones at the extreme ends of the
spectrum. This was done presumably so the SCIR
would not have to disagree publicly with the CIR.
Why would the trustees create a commission such
as the CIR, then systematically disregard so many of
its recommendations and cripple it with impossible
evaluative criteria? Surely the CIR must serve a pur
pose. It does. The CIR gives the community the im
pression that something is being done about South
Africa and that the trustees are serious about
selective divestment. The sloth and powerlessness of
the CIR and its policy recommendations serve the
trustees' interests very well. This is an issue the trus
tees would just as soon not deal with and the CIR
provides them with an ingenious means of doing just
that.
The CIR can only do what the trustees will allow it.
The trustees must allow the CIR to use objective
criteria when setting an investment policy.
Guidelines for new investment must also be set. This
must happen before the Stanford community can
believe that the trustees are serious about selective
divestment. There is no indication that such
changes in trustee policy will be forthcoming. That is
why we are seeking to pull the student members
from the commission. We feel students should not be
a part of the trustees' cynical window-dressing of a
very serious issue.

Student CIR
participation
is necessary
As one of three student members of the Committee
on Investment Responsibility (CIR), I have read the
recent articles (Daily, April 9 and 10) and feel the
need to share my views with the Stanford commu
nity. I also want to make clear that my statements
are personal statements, not statements represent
ing the CIR in any official capacity.
The recent article about the decision of the Special
Committee on Investment Responsibility (SCIR) to
divest from USX Corp. portrayed the SCIR as an ac
tive participant in working against apartheid. This
is the first instance I know of in which the SCIR has
played a proactive role in the divestment (selling
stock) or disinvestment (selling a South African op
eration) of Stanford holdings. It hope that this action
portends what shall come, but I am skeptical.

NARTER

The SCIR more typically rejects CIR recommen
dations or sends them back for more analysis —
which usually means that no action is taken. The
Goodyear and NCR disinvestment decisions are typi
cal. The CIR recommended that Stanford vote in fa
vor of proxies that ask each company to sell its South
African holdings.
The consensus of the CIR is that being in South
Africa is inherently bad since participating in South
African society both legitimizes and supports apart
heid. Unless a company is an especially "good actor"
it should leave. Most debate within the CIR has been

about how to define a good actor.
Another common practice of the CIR is to infor
mally discuss policy with the SCIR. Since the CIR is
only able to recommend policy to the SCIR. we will
usually modify policy internally to be more in line
with the views of the SCIR in order to be more effec
tive.
This allows the SCIR to reject certain policies pro
posed by the CIR without being on record as reject
ing them. Again, this permits the SCIR to look as if it
were only waiting for CIR recommendations in order
to act. In truth. I do not find them responsive to the
CIR.
The CIR is. a special animal consisting of three
members each from the alumni, faculty, staff and
students. We all hold diverse views — I suspect we
have both Mondale Democrats and Reagan
Republicans on the CIR — yet we are able to come to
agreement.
The SCIR frequently dismisses our arguments and
does what it pleases. I must disagree with Daniel
Brenner, a University trustee on the SCIR, when he
states that the SCIR and the CIR work well together.
I very much understand John van Loben Sels'
frustration. However, I can't agree with his motion to
vote for withdrawal in all shareholder resolutions. I
personally believe that good actors exist in South
Africa and play a net positive role in the ending of
apartheid. I perhaps understand the basis for van
Loben Sels' frustration even better than he does,
since he has missed 10 of the last 24 meetings.
However, I believe continued student participation
in the CIR is valuable.
My ideal would be to force the SCIR to formally
reject all CIR proposals and be accountable to the
University community for its actions. When 12
people representing all sectors of the University come
to consensus on such genuinely complex issues, the
SCIR should not be able to dismiss our proposals so
easily.

were only waiting for CIR recommendations in order
to act. In truth. I do not find them responsive to the
CIR.
The CIR is. a special animal consisting of three
members each from the alumni, faculty, staff and
students. We all hold diverse views — I suspect we
have both Mondale Democrats and Reagan
Republicans on the CIR — yet we are able to come to
agreement.
The SCIR frequently dismisses our arguments and
does what it pleases. I must disagree with Daniel
Brenner, a University trustee on the SCIR, when he
states that the SCIR and the CIR work well together.
I very much understand John van Loben Sels'
frustration. However, I can't agree with his motion to
vote for withdrawal in all shareholder resolutions. I
personally believe that good actors exist in South
Africa and play a net positive role in the ending of
apartheid. I perhaps understand the basis for van
Loben Sels' frustration even better than he does,
since he has missed 10 of the last 24 meetings.
However, I believe continued student participation
in the CIR is valuable.
My ideal would be to force the SCIR to formally
reject all CIR proposals and be accountable to the
University community for its actions. When 12
people representing all sectors of the University come
to consensus on such genuinely complex issues, the
SCIR should not be able to dismiss our proposals so
easily.

Pull students
out of the CIR
The Committee on Investment Responsibility (CIR)
was created with the intention that it serve as advi
ser to the University Board of Trustees' Special Com
mission on Investment Responsibility (SCIR) for
South Africa-related investment decisions. The CIR
consists of faculty, students, staff and alumni. It is
the body that does the primary research on the cor
porations in the Stanford portfolio that have South
African connections. The CIR is supposed to aid the
trustees in executing the trustees' reported policy of
selective divestment.

VAN LOBEN SELS

Under a policy of selective divestment, determina
tions must be made between companies that are
deemed net good actors and those that are net
negative actors. From these determinations, divest
ment and proxy vote decisions are supposed to be
made. Herein lies the basic structural flaw that keeps
the CIR from functioning as it should. The trustees
insist on a case-by-case approach to selective divest
ment. With such an approach, the CIR must make
some sort of evaluation of a company's performance
on the apartheid issue. The CIR is not permitted to
rely on the Sullivan ratings in making such deci
sions. Instead, the members of the CIR are forced to
attempt to come up with their own criteria and judge
relative corporate performance. This is a job that
simply cannot be accomplished in a legitimate or ex
peditious fashion from here in Palo Alto. For the
trustees to insist upon such an approach does not
reflect a desire to deal fairly with each company, but
rather serves only to cripple any potentially positive
influence the CIR might have.

The functional reality of trustee actions on CIR
recommendations has been nothing short of shame
ful. As meager and slow as the CIR recommendations
necessarily have been, the SCIR often just casually
disregarded those recommendations — even for the
very worst companies in the portfolio. Last week the
CIR called for a "yes" vote on disinvestment proxy
resolutions for Goodyear and NCR. two of the very
worst performers in the portfolio by any standard.
The SCIR blithely rejected the CIR without explana
tion. Instead, the trustees came back with a recom
mendation that the CIR not vote on all proxy resolu
tions — only the ones at the extreme ends of the
spectrum. This was done presumably so the SCIR
would not have to disagree publicly with the CIR.
Why would the trustees create a commission such
as the CIR, then systematically disregard so many of
its recommendations and cripple it with impossible
evaluative criteria? Surely the CIR must serve a pur
pose. It does. The CIR gives the community the im
pression that something is being done about South
Africa and that the trustees are serious about
selective divestment. The sloth and powerlessness of
the CIR and its policy recommendations serve the
trustees' interests very well. This is an issue the trus
tees would just as soon not deal with and the CIR
provides them with an ingenious means of doing just
that.
The CIR can only do what the trustees will allow it.
The trustees must allow the CIR to use objective
criteria when setting an investment policy.
Guidelines for new investment must also be set. This
must happen before the Stanford community can
believe that the trustees are serious about selective
divestment. There is no indication that such
changes in trustee policy will be forthcoming. That is
why we are seeking to pull the student members
from the commission. We feel students should not be
a part of the trustees' cynical window-dressing of a
very serious issue.

Student CIR
participation
is necessary
As one of three student members of the Committee
on Investment Responsibility (CIR), I have read the
recent articles (Daily, April 9 and 10) and feel the
need to share my views with the Stanford commu
nity. I also want to make clear that my statements
are personal statements, not statements represent
ing the CIR in any official capacity.
The recent article about the decision of the Special
Committee on Investment Responsibility (SCIR) to
divest from USX Corp. portrayed the SCIR as an ac
tive participant in working against apartheid. This
is the first instance I know of in which the SCIR has
played a proactive role in the divestment (selling
stock) or disinvestment (selling a South African op
eration) of Stanford holdings. It hope that this action
portends what shall come, but I am skeptical.

NARTER

The SCIR more typically rejects CIR recommen
dations or sends them back for more analysis —
which usually means that no action is taken. The
Goodyear and NCR disinvestment decisions are typi
cal. The CIR recommended that Stanford vote in fa
vor of proxies that ask each company to sell its South
African holdings.
The consensus of the CIR is that being in South
Africa is inherently bad since participating in South
African society both legitimizes and supports apart
heid. Unless a company is an especially "good actor"
it should leave. Most debate within the CIR has been

about how to define a good actor.
Another common practice of the CIR is to infor
mally discuss policy with the SCIR. Since the CIR is
only able to recommend policy to the SCIR. we will
usually modify policy internally to be more in line
with the views of the SCIR in order to be more effec
tive.
This allows the SCIR to reject certain policies pro
posed by the CIR without being on record as reject
ing them. Again, this permits the SCIR to look as if it
were only waiting for CIR recommendations in order
to act. In truth. I do not find them responsive to the
