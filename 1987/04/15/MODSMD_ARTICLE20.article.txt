## Interview: Sondra Locke, actress and director 
### MARK TOMPKINS Editorial staff 
Sondra Locke made her film
debut almost 20 years ago, In an
adaptation of Carson McCullers'
"The Heart Is a Lonely Hunter,"
Wherein she played a sensitive
adolescent girl who befriends a
deaf-mute, played by Alan Arkin.
Locke was barely out of high
school at the time; she won the
role when the film's producers
held a regional talent contest to
find a "fresh face" for the part. All
the more extraordinary, then, that
Locke was nominated for an
Academy Award her first time out,
an accolade that catapulted her
into Hollywood.
Locke arrived in Tinseltown just
in time for the so-called Hollywood
crisis of the late '60s and early
'70s, when (and post-"Star Wars"
youngsters may have a hard time
believing this), after a series of
well-publicized biblical and histor
ical flops, Hollywood started
making small, personal films.
After appearing in a number of
film and TV roles, and as she puts
it, "hiding out," Locke appeared in
"The Outlaw Josey Wales," her
first picture with Clint Eastwood.
She went on to star in a number of
Eastwood films, displaying a
knack for comedy in "Bronco
Billy," wherein she played a bitchy
New York heiress, playing nicely
off the well-meaning meathead
title character played by
Eastwood.
But although she may be best
known for her work with
Eastwood, Locke has now turned
to directing. "Ratboy" is her first
effort as a director: an absurdist
fable, it chronicles the discovery of
yes, a ratboy, by an unscrupulous
would-be impresario (Locke) and
the ratboy's subsequent exploita
tion by the Hollywood community.
While big-budget extravaganzas
have become all the rage in Holly

wood during the last decade,
Locke feels that "Ratboy" is an un
usual, smaller and more personal
film, perhaps harkening back to
the early '70s sort.
When I talked with Locke during
an afternoon last week in San
Francisco, she seemed straight
forward and relaxed, in contrast
to her often uptight or neurotic
screen roles. With her classical
prettiness, in some ways Locke
seemed very delicate; I wanted to
avoid making any sudden move
ments around her. But as she
talked, with the perspective of one
who has seen cycles come and go
in Hollywood, it became clear that
she was enthusiastic about
"Ratboy" and had strong beliefs
about herself and her work.
Daily: I was surprised by how
well all of "Ratboy's" action
scenes worked. I would've
thought that as a first-time direc
tor, you would've avoided those
complicated scenes.
Locke: It's really funny. I've had so
many people comment on the ac
tion and certainly if anybody had
ever asked me, do you think of
yourself as knowing how to shoot
action, I would've said "no way!" I
never realized there was action in
the film because I looked at it from
the story point of view, for the
comment or the message I wanted
to get across, and the action hap
pened to be what happened in a
scene. I never thought, "Here I
have an action scene coming up,
I'd better do this." And even now
I've been thinking, "Where, what
action?" I don't even know that it
was action, because it was just
innately part of the story.
Daily: As a director, how respon
sible are you for the final,
finished product? How much of
yourself do you think is in the
film?
Locke: Well, a lot I think. I was
very, very lucky in that I did have a
lot of freedom in making the film. I

think there's no question about it;
even some of the top directors, I
think they'd agree that directing
is the art of compromise. It's end
less compromise all the time —
with the studio, with yourself,
with an actor who's not exactly
what you imagined he was going
to be and all those things.
But I feel like I can look at the
film and see myself. I'm happy
about that. I see the flaws, and I
see the good things, I see the bad
things. But in spite of it all. I see a
tone that I put in there somehow.
Daily: You mentioned flaws. Was
there anything you really weren't
satisfied with?
Locke: A million little things. I
spent the whole last two-thirds of
the film not looking at the dailies
(rough prints of the film that has
just been shot). I wouldn't even
look at them, and I thought I was
really weird, but I talked with a
couple of other directors, like
Peter Weir ("Witness," "The
Mosquito Coast") and he said he
never looks at dailies. Basically,
particularly when you're just
starting out, the only way they're
going to let you reshoot it is if It
didn't come out, period. So you
can't redo it. With dailies, I tend to
really see everything I do wrong
and I get depressed. And I say, "Oh
God, I shouldn't have done this,
and I didn't do that and I missed
this shot," and I'd get really de
pressed. And I'd go to work think
ing about redoing yesterday's
work instead of doing today's, so 1
just stopped looking. So when you
say where are the flaws, they're in
practically every scene of the
picture.
Daily: But the ordinary viewer
wouldn't pick up on them?
Locke: Probably not, maybe some
of them. But for me they're un
avoidable (laughs).
Daily: How would you define
creativity — what sort of
creativity did you bring to

"Ratboy," both as an actress and
a director? When you have a
script in front of you, what do
you bring to it?
Locke: Everything's a part of you
— I think that's the most impor
tant thing, to feel the real singular
point of view, the single attitude
that's the driving force of a piece,
and anything — the perfor
mances, the script, the photogra
phy — that you can tailor toward
to that attitude, that point of view,
is really to me the objective.
I wish I could write. To me, that
is the most creative process. I'm in
the process of discovering that I'm
not as bad at re-writing as I

thought I was. I have a pretty good
knack for zeroing in and fixing
things. But to sit down and start
from nothing — I'm so impressed
with that.
Daily: Did you work closely with
Rob Thompson (screenwriter of
"Ratboy")?
Locke: I did, on the re-write, par
ticularly on the first two-thirds of
the film. The last act was relatively
the way we had structured it, but
the original script was set in New
York, it wasn't set toward the
whole Hollywood scene.
Daily: The film presents Holly
wood in a fairly negative light.

Would you care to comment on
that?
Locke: I honestly don't see it as
completely inaccurate. Obviously
the film has a bigger-than-life
quality about it — it is a fable, and
so it is an exaggeration, but in es
sence I don't think it's an exag
geration of the whole Hollywood
scene.
Daily: Again, both as an actress
and a director, what do you think
of the present state of Hollywood
and the types of films that are
being made?
Locke: Actually I'm in a state of en
