## Interview: Sondra Locke, actress and director 
### MARK TOMPKINS Editorial staff 
Sondra Locke made her film
debut almost 20 years ago, In an
adaptation of Carson McCullers'
"The Heart Is a Lonely Hunter,"
Wherein she played a sensitive
adolescent girl who befriends a
deaf-mute, played by Alan Arkin.
Locke was barely out of high
school at the time; she won the
role when the film's producers
held a regional talent contest to
find a "fresh face" for the part. All
the more extraordinary, then, that
Locke was nominated for an
Academy Award her first time out,
an accolade that catapulted her
into Hollywood.
Locke arrived in Tinseltown just
in time for the so-called Hollywood
crisis of the late '60s and early
'70s, when (and post-"Star Wars"
youngsters may have a hard time
believing this), after a series of
well-publicized biblical and histor
ical flops, Hollywood started
making small, personal films.
After appearing in a number of
film and TV roles, and as she puts
it, "hiding out," Locke appeared in
"The Outlaw Josey Wales," her
first picture with Clint Eastwood.
She went on to star in a number of
Eastwood films, displaying a
knack for comedy in "Bronco
Billy," wherein she played a bitchy
New York heiress, playing nicely
off the well-meaning meathead
title character played by
Eastwood.
But although she may be best
known for her work with
Eastwood, Locke has now turned
to directing. "Ratboy" is her first
effort as a director: an absurdist
fable, it chronicles the discovery of
yes, a ratboy, by an unscrupulous
would-be impresario (Locke) and
the ratboy's subsequent exploita
tion by the Hollywood community.
While big-budget extravaganzas
have become all the rage in Holly

wood during the last decade,
Locke feels that "Ratboy" is an un
usual, smaller and more personal
film, perhaps harkening back to
the early '70s sort.
When I talked with Locke during
an afternoon last week in San
Francisco, she seemed straight
forward and relaxed, in contrast
to her often uptight or neurotic
screen roles. With her classical
prettiness, in some ways Locke
seemed very delicate; I wanted to
avoid making any sudden move
ments around her. But as she
talked, with the perspective of one
who has seen cycles come and go
in Hollywood, it became clear that
she was enthusiastic about
"Ratboy" and had strong beliefs
about herself and her work.
Daily: I was surprised by how
well all of "Ratboy's" action
scenes worked. I would've
thought that as a first-time direc
tor, you would've avoided those
complicated scenes.
Locke: It's really funny. I've had so
many people comment on the ac
tion and certainly if anybody had
ever asked me, do you think of
yourself as knowing how to shoot
action, I would've said "no way!" I
never realized there was action in
the film because I looked at it from
the story point of view, for the
comment or the message I wanted
to get across, and the action hap
pened to be what happened in a
scene. I never thought, "Here I
have an action scene coming up,
I'd better do this." And even now
I've been thinking, "Where, what
action?" I don't even know that it
was action, because it was just
innately part of the story.
Daily: As a director, how respon
sible are you for the final,
finished product? How much of
yourself do you think is in the
film?
Locke: Well, a lot I think. I was
very, very lucky in that I did have a
lot of freedom in making the film. I

think there's no question about it;
even some of the top directors, I
think they'd agree that directing
is the art of compromise. It's end
less compromise all the time —
with the studio, with yourself,
with an actor who's not exactly
what you imagined he was going
to be and all those things.
But I feel like I can look at the
film and see myself. I'm happy
about that. I see the flaws, and I
see the good things, I see the bad
things. But in spite of it all. I see a
tone that I put in there somehow.
Daily: You mentioned flaws. Was
there anything you really weren't
satisfied with?
Locke: A million little things. I
spent the whole last two-thirds of
the film not looking at the dailies
(rough prints of the film that has
just been shot). I wouldn't even
look at them, and I thought I was
really weird, but I talked with a
couple of other directors, like
Peter Weir ("Witness," "The
Mosquito Coast") and he said he
never looks at dailies. Basically,
particularly when you're just
starting out, the only way they're
going to let you reshoot it is if It
didn't come out, period. So you
can't redo it. With dailies, I tend to
really see everything I do wrong
and I get depressed. And I say, "Oh
God, I shouldn't have done this,
and I didn't do that and I missed
this shot," and I'd get really de
pressed. And I'd go to work think
ing about redoing yesterday's
work instead of doing today's, so 1
just stopped looking. So when you
say where are the flaws, they're in
practically every scene of the
picture.
Daily: But the ordinary viewer
wouldn't pick up on them?
Locke: Probably not, maybe some
of them. But for me they're un
avoidable (laughs).
Daily: How would you define
creativity — what sort of
creativity did you bring to

"Ratboy," both as an actress and
a director? When you have a
script in front of you, what do
you bring to it?
Locke: Everything's a part of you
— I think that's the most impor
tant thing, to feel the real singular
point of view, the single attitude
that's the driving force of a piece,
and anything — the perfor
mances, the script, the photogra
phy — that you can tailor toward
to that attitude, that point of view,
is really to me the objective.
I wish I could write. To me, that
is the most creative process. I'm in
the process of discovering that I'm
not as bad at re-writing as I

thought I was. I have a pretty good
knack for zeroing in and fixing
things. But to sit down and start
from nothing — I'm so impressed
with that.
Daily: Did you work closely with
Rob Thompson (screenwriter of
"Ratboy")?
Locke: I did, on the re-write, par
ticularly on the first two-thirds of
the film. The last act was relatively
the way we had structured it, but
the original script was set in New
York, it wasn't set toward the
whole Hollywood scene.
Daily: The film presents Holly
wood in a fairly negative light.

Would you care to comment on
that?
Locke: I honestly don't see it as
completely inaccurate. Obviously
the film has a bigger-than-life
quality about it — it is a fable, and
so it is an exaggeration, but in es
sence I don't think it's an exag
geration of the whole Hollywood
scene.
Daily: Again, both as an actress
and a director, what do you think
of the present state of Hollywood
and the types of films that are
being made?
Locke: Actually I'm in a state of en

couragement right now because at
least there are some unusual films
that are getting made — "Blue Vel
vet," Jim Jarmusch's "Down By
Law." There are a lot of new.
independent-type production
companies and distribution com
panies that are popping up, and I
find that really encouraging, be
cause a few years ago you didn't
see anything.
Daily: Do you think those films
and companies could represent
the future?
Locke: I think so. The pendulum
always swings. I remember when I
did my first film. I was right out of
high school and I didn't know
what the heck was going on. and I
laugh now. because at the time I
was so impressed that I was in a
million-dollar movie, and
nowadays of course you can't
make anything for a million dol
lars. I went to Hollywood and all of
a suddSn there were no films
being made because they had
made a lot of big films that had
lost a lot of money, and then
boom. The pendulum went the
other way: they started making a
lot of little films, and nothing with
a big budget got approved. So it
just goes back and forth.
Daily: How do you think you've
changed since your debut?
You've been around a while now,
since 1968.
Locke: I'm not sure I've changed a
whole lot. I've always felt I was
born an adult, which in a sense is
probably why, in the practical
world, I loved movies and still love
movies. It's the child in me, still
playing pretend. It was really a
shock to me, coming to Holly
wood. It was a great part, for a
first film. And yet I always had the
ability — I use this as an example,
when I was nominated for an Os

car. I remember going to the
theater that night and not believ
ing for one second that it was
going to happen. There was just
such an earthbound side to me. I
could step back. I've maintained
that over the years, a sense of
humor about knowing all the ins
and outs and the politics, and the
whole illogical, nonsensical part of
the business.
Daily: Everyone says there's a lot
of waiting around in Hollywood.
What do you do between film
parts?
Locke: That's one thing I look
back on now with longing, be
cause I used to look at actors and
think they had such an easy task
when they were working. They go
In for a few weeks, get a lot of
money, none of the ultimate re
sponsibility Is theirs, and it's
really a breeze. And they have a lot
of time In between parts. But then
on "Heart." my first film, I remem
ber Alan Arkin, who was a big star
then, going, "I wonder If I'll ever
make another film." I thought,
this is Incredible — there's a man
who's a big star, and he's worrying
if he'll ever work again. It was
impossible, and yet I discovered
that most actors are that way.
They always think it's their last
film, no matter how famous they
are, and the waiting Is like a
nightmare to them.
For me, it was never that way. I
loved the time in between. Sadly. I
think it was because there were
not enough roles that I coveted
enough for me to care whether I
did them or not. So there was not
that anxiety about it. So when I
say that I look back with longing, I
mean that as a director, because
as a director you don't have that
long time between projects. You
spend two years of your life,
sometimes more, on one project,
and by that time, you've probably
already found another story, and
they sort of run into each other.
And I think I'm going to miss that

time in between, frankly.
Daily: What's the progress of a
movie like "Ratboy" once the
filming is done? How involved
are you in the marketing, getting
it out to the public?
Locke: I've tried to be Involved
with it very much, in this particu
lar case. It's the most unknown
area to me. because I've been on
film sets for almost 20 years, and
I've studied it, and it's been like
second nature to me. But the
whole marketing end is some
thing I've never gotten Involved in,
and it's a mystery to me. It's terri
fying. You look at people, and
what will get them to go into a
theater, and what won't? I have no
idea. It's not a science that you
can ever really figure out. I'm
really trying to be Involved on
"Ratboy," because It's unusual,
It's off-beat, and Warner Brothers
doesn't really know how to sell it;
there is no way to sell it. You can
only hope that there are enough
people interested in something
different, and if you let them know
about It, maybe they'll go.
Daily: How has the film been re
garded? It was shown in a
European film festival, I hear.
Locke: The first time I showed the
film, I had just finished it, and I
was invited to take it to the
Deauville Festival in France. It was
extremely well-received. The
reception was so — if I had tried to
write the scene myself, I couldn't
have written a better scene. I was
very pleased with that. And it
opened and got a good review in
the Los Angeles Times, too. So it
has gotten some good reactions;
it's the kind of thing where people
either really love it or just don't get
it at all. What pleased me about
the good reception was that people
didn't just like it or say nice things
about me; they seemed to under
stand the story, the heart of what I
was trying to project.

This is the Ratboy, the center of attention, naturally enough, in
Sondra Locke's "Ratboy." When the Ratboy is discovered in his
native dump environment, he is exploited by Hollywood social climb
ers, with disastrous results.
Daily: Present company ex
cluded, how important are critics
to the success, of a movie like
this? Is the idea to build up some
kind of media attention around
it?
Locke: I tell you, I don't know if
there is any idea around it. When I
first saw the final movie, I
thought, "I don't have any idea
who will like this movie. I don't
know if it's students, or Woody Al
len fans, or Sylvester Stallone fans
for that matter. I don't know if it's

critics, or the man on the street."
So far the people who seem to be
liking it the most are more of the
serious film buffs. I guess if we
take that as a hint, we'll try to call
attention to ourselves to people
like that. It's certainly not going to
be a major TV commercial cam
paign type of movie, that's for sure
(laughs).
I wouldn't even be unhappy if
this could be one of those films
that lingers around, and maybe
even years later could be appreci
ated for something. That 1 find
very appealing.
Daily: Nowadays it seems like
everything gets a second life on
video, too.

Locke: I would say that a film like
this could theoretically be very
good in rental and on cable. It's
certainly a film for a special audi
ence.
Daily: Where do you think you'll
go from here? Is directing be
coming more important to you
than acting?
Locke: I think definitely. I'm devel
oping two stories right now. and
they're both psychological thril
lers, one that's more like the old
Jllm-noir genre. I'm intrigued by
that genre, with Its contrasts.
Something that always appealed
to me about "Ratboy" was the
hard-edged morality to it, with
also a kind of bittersweet feel to it.
I like the idea of man with his dark
side and lights, and both these
stories have a little of that, even
though they're more standard,
you can pinpoint them more in
terms of genre than you can
"Ratboy."
Daily: Would you be playing roles
in these, or just direct?
Locke: I don't think so. I'm going
to try to stay behind the camera. I
would like not to have that extra
burden for these, although I do
have one comedy that I'm think
ing of acting in.
Daily: Is it hard for a woman to
direct in Hollywood?
Locke: I think it is. It's hard for
anybody to get started in their
career, but women are just begin
ning to work in a lot of profes
sions. There's something there —
I think it's an area that some
women should be very good at. For
me, the most Important thing
about film, one thing which I
think is lost in a lot of today's
films, which I love so much in a lot
of old films, is a certain ability to
be in touch with the emotions.
Women are classically very in
touch with emotions, and they're
very in touch with the perception
and projection of emotions. I
think that's something that serves
you well as a director, trying to
manipulate the emotions.
Daily: Do you have any advice for
aspiring actors or directors?
Locke: I tell you, this whole busi
ness of being hooked on acting or
directing, especially acting — I
think in some ways a technical
skill you can rely on more, because
people can rate it, to some degree.
Acting is a mystery to most people;
they don't know whether it's good,
bad or how you do it. It's such a
roulette game. I would never

dream of discouraging anybody,
or encouraging anybody. Because
I think it's your own drive that's
going to make it happen. Because
it's not rational or reasonable at
all. what films are successes, what
films get made, what directors get
work, what actors get work, it
doesn't seem to have any sense to
it. So if a person is really driven to
do it. that's when they have the
ability — if not. they're probably

not going to make it.
I think I've been very lucky in my
career, because when I was start
ing out as an actress I was not very
good at talking about myself. I was
terribly sensitive, not very good at
selling myself. I couldn't stand the
whole business end of it. So in a
sense I did hide out a lot. And it's a
tribute to my luck or something
that I managed to stick around,
because I was just not very good at

promoting myself or going out and
making things happen. So a lot of
the things that did happen, came
to me. There was a certain destiny
involved. And although 1 felt I was
prepared for them when they
came, 1 didn't do a lot to make
them happen. In. general 1 think
the people who do make it are the
ones who are really driven, and
not necessarily the ones with the
most talent.

Sondra Locke plays an unscrupulous character with fame on her
mind in "Ratboy." The film, which Locke directed, was well-received
at France's Deauville Film Festival but Locke says she has no idea
who will like the film here.
