# Clapton shows why he's the world's greatest
## 
### KAI KEASEY 
Eric Clapton proved Saturday night why he is the
best guitarist in the world. Before a sell-out Oakland
Coliseum crowd. Clapton and his band performed
two hours of non-stop, high-energy rock-n-roll that
can only be called incredible.
To the delight of the majority of the crowd, Clapton
played mainly his older, classic rock songs. He
recalled his Cream roots, as he opened with
"Crossroads" and "White Room." He then did his
cover of Bob Marley's "I Shot the Sheriff' with an ex
tended guitar solo that rocked the fans to a frenzy. In
fact, every single song contained an extended in
trumental jam that inevitably featured Clapton
wailing away on his six-string. Each successive
'solo fit into each different song perfectly, which
solidified Clapton's musical and technical genius in
my mind.
Clapton was not the only one playing well Satur
day. His keyboardist, bassist and drummer played
flawless background, and during a 20-minute rendi
tion of "Same Old Blues" each exhibited his own im
mense talent with a solo. The bassist's solo was tech
nically remarkable yet still clean, and had a real blues
flavor that fit nicely into the song. The keyboardist
looked like a whirling dervish during his solo, as he
jumped, spun, gyrated and still played a fast-paced,
high-energy, blues-based solo. Phil Collins played
drums for Clapton, and seemed to fully enjoy the
respite from being the main figure on stage; casually
dressed in sweats and a white T-shirt, the wild and
woolly Collins played a fast and frenzied drum solo
that Was just remarkable.
Even though the beginning of the concert con
sisted of great songs and performances, the end
managed to surpass everything that had come
before. Clapton closed with "Let It Rain." "Cocaine"
and Layla, in that order. To heighten the anticipa
tion. he opened each song with unfamiliar riffs and
solos, which had the crowd wondering what song he
was playing, before he broke into the unmistakable
rhythms of the last three songs. Once again each
song featured Clapton's incredible solos, and he just
kept rockin' with each one.

The end of the concert
managed to surpass
everything that had come
before.

It's really hard to describe just how wonderful his
performance was, but what really impressed me was
his stamina. I thought he would get tired after
soloing on every single song, but apparently he
didn't, making the concert that much better and in
creasing my opinion of him immensely.
The set was minimal â€” only a bank of light in an
overhead framework, with no flashy background or
constructed set. When you play guitar as well as
Clapton, you don't need a flashy backdrop. The light
ing was good despite the small amount of hardware,
and it produced some pleasing effects. During Col
lins' solo, lights of various different colors were
flashed on Phil only, producing the illusion of a large
packet of fireworks exploding in quick succession.
The crowd was vocal throughout the concert, and
then stormed the stage during "Cocaine." and
remained there for the duration. Clapton received a
raucous standing ovation and. after an extended
rest, returned to perform "In the Sunshine of My
Life" for an encore. He didn't play a second encore,
even though the crowd wanted it; people actually
booed when the house lights were turned on.
My only complaints didn't diminish my enthusi
asm for the concert. At times. Clapton would stop in
total darkness for a full five seconds, which confused
me as to whether he continued the same song or
started a new one when he began playing again. He
also didn't play the slow part of "Layla" long enough
for my taste. Overall, though. I was awed by his rep
ertoire. skill and endurance, and judging by every
thing I heard, so was the rest of the crowd.
