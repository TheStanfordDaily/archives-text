# Stanford combo takes two jazz festivals
## 
### 
This past weekend was a good one, to say the
least, for Stanford jazz. Stanford's combos took
first and sixth place in the Pacific Coast Col
legiate Jazz Festival at Berkeley on Friday
night, and then early Saturday morning the top
combo flew to Notre Dame for the prestigious
Notre Dame Collegiate Jazz Festival, where it
tied for first place.
Stanford Combo 1, so named for the PCCJ
Festival, consisted of Bob Adams on acoustic
piano, David Aguiar on saxophone, Larry
Grenadren on bass, George Rice on trumpet
and Bill Oliver on drums. Adams, Aguiar and
Adams all picked up individual awards for out
standing playing, while the combo as a whole
beat out UC-Berkeley to take first place overall.
Other bands at the festival hailed from Wash
ington, Idaho and Oregon.
Saturday the combo flew to the invitation
only Notre Dame Festival; an invitation was
earned after the group sent in a tape of its
music several months ago. The combo tied for
first place with a group from New Jersey's
William Patterson College.
The members of Stanford's ensemble were
naturally pleased with their showings at each
festival, but saxophonist Aguiar said it was
"particularly fun" to tie for firsi in Notre Dame
"because no one there had ever heard of Stan
ford in terms of jazz groups."
Also happy was Jose Bo wen, who co-directs
Stanford's jazz combos with Jim Nadan. Bowen
remarked that Stanford's jazz program has
seen a big improvement within the last few
years, and said the high placings of the combo
are an indication of just how far the program
has come.
The individual awards won at Friday's compe
tition in Berkeley were: the Bill Evans Memorial
Award, which went went to pianist Adams, the
lan Epstein Award to saxophonist Aguiar and
the PCCJF Award for Outstanding Bassist to
Grenaden.
