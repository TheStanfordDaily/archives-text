## Buy-back not a rip-off The 						Bookstore’s dealin' down on used books 
### LISA BROOKS 
The Bookstore — a place where
people go in smiling and come out
complaining about the lines and
the prices. Despite appearances,
however, the Stanford Bookstore
is not out to rip off students — es
pecially In the case of its used
book buy-backs.
This was difficult for junior
Roberta Kowalskl to believe.
"I feel gypped. I just bought a
book for $20 and they're going to
buy it back for *3."

Senior Nan Ho also expressed
dissatisfaction with the system. "I
brought in eight books and got
about *40. I expected twice as
much. They said I could bring
them back at the end of the quar
ter and maybe get 50 percent, but
that just seems like the
runaround."
These students have legitimate
gripes, according to textbook
manager Jim Arnold, who is in
charge of the buy-back operation.
However, he stresses that the
causes of unhappiness for these

students lie in national supply
and demand factors rather than
the Bookstore's policies.
"We're here to provide a service
for the students, not to make
money," Arnold said.
Arnold noted the many opportu
nities that the store gives stu
dents to sell their books as an ex
ample of that service. Many col
leges only schedule buy-backs
during the last week of a term,
while Stanford also has them
during the first week of the quar
ter. In addition, buy-backs are

held every Friday of the quarter
after the third week.
The usual week of buy-backs
will also be lengthened at the end
of spring quarter.
"Since everyone sells their
books in June, we will extend the
sale to 10 days and have three
buyers instead of just one," said
Arnold.
In order to avoid losing money,
the Bookstore will only purchase
books which it can sell back either
to students or to a wholesale book
company. Books will be purchased
If they are on the current retail
market in the right edition.
The Bookstore also purchases
discontinued books if they are on
a department's reading list for the

quarter which immediately fol
lows or if they are on a Nebraska
Book Company list of books that
the wholesaler will buy from the
Bookstore.
Exceptions to this rule are copy
materials, books that retail for
less than *3.95 and workbooks or
other books with cribbed pages.
The Bookstore automatically
pays 50 percent of the retail price
of a textbook currently in print
despite its condition.
Students sometimes get lucky

because the retail price of a cur
rent book will have risen by the
time they sell back their books. So
if a >20 book goes up to *25.the
student will pocket • 12.50 rather
than *10. However, if the price
drops, the student will get back
less than half of the original price.
When it comes to determining
which books to buy back and how
much they are worth. Arnold and
his staff refer to the Nebraska
Book Company list.
"Usually a student will get
anywhere from 10 to 33 percent
tops of what he or she paid." Ar
nold stated.
The Bookstore marks up all
books it buys for resale to Stan

ford students by one-third in or
der to cover operating costs. It
loses money, however, on books
that it sells to the Nebraska
wholesaler because the Bookstore
only receives the price it pays to
students.
"If we pay a student $8 for a
book, then we sell it to the
(wholesaler) for >8," Arnold said.
"We actually lose money on this
end of the deal because we have
additional freight charges — but
we give the students the break."
Arnold emphasized that any
money made from textbooks goes
toward paying rebates which are
made available fall quarter.
