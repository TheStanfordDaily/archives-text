## Buy-back not a rip-off The
						Bookstore’s dealin' down on used books 
### LISA BROOKS 
The Bookstore — a place where
people go in smiling and come out
complaining about the lines and
the prices. Despite appearances,
however, the Stanford Bookstore
is not out to rip off students — es
pecially In the case of its used
book buy-backs.
This was difficult for junior
Roberta Kowalskl to believe.
"I feel gypped. I just bought a
book for $20 and they're going to
buy it back for *3."

Senior Nan Ho also expressed
dissatisfaction with the system. "I
brought in eight books and got
about *40. I expected twice as

held every Friday of the quarter
after the third week.
The usual week of buy-backs
will also be lengthened at the end
of spring quarter.
"Since everyone sells their
books in June, we will extend the
sale to 10 days and have three
buyers instead of just one," said
Arnold.
In order to avoid losing money,
the Bookstore will only purchase
books which it can sell back either
to students or to a wholesale book
company. Books will be purchased
If they are on the current retail
market in the right edition.
The Bookstore also purchases
discontinued books if they are on
