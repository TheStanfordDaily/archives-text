## Men's tennis stuns No. 2 Long Beach St. Doubles sweep leads to 6-3 win 
### JON WEISMAN Staff writer 
Whiie the Stanford men's tennis team still has
tough matches remaining this season, the
groundwork for the road to Athens, Ga., and the
NCAA championships was laid yesterday with a 6-3
win over No. 2 Long Beach State.
It's a shame that the 12-8 Cardinal faces two more
roadblocks this weekend in top-ranked USC and
third-ranked UCLA because yesterday's victory over
the 49ers, now 23-3, would have been one to savor.
Inspired by the play of Jeff Cathrall, who came
back from a 5-2 deficit in the third set of his singles
match to win and tie the team score at 3-3, the fired
up Cardinal blew out the 49ers in doubles, winning
three straight matches â€” two over top-20 doubles
teams.
Stanford and Long Beach State were tied through
out the singles portion of the match. Each was
leading in two matches, trailing in two matches and
virtually tied in two matches.
For example, just as 17th-ranked Patrick McEnroe
was losing to Long Beach State's No. 45 Greg Failla at
No. 2 singles, 6-4, 6-2, Stanford freshman Barry Ric
hards was finishing off Mitch Bridge at No. 6. 7-5, 6-
2.
"I got down break twice in the first set," Richards
said, "and just kind of hung in there, stuck it
out. . . . Toward the end of the first set I started pick
ing up on the fact that his groundstrokes weren't
really hurting me. If I was staying back, they were
just getting back deep, and all I had to do was get
into the net, and they were still floating high when I
was at the net, so I could put away the volleys pretty
easily."
Stanford's Scott Moody then lost to Patrick
Hultgren at No. 5, 6-4. 6-2, but 23rd-ranked Jeff
Tarango countered that by edging seventh-ranked
Richard Bergh, 7-6 (7-3), 6-4.
At this point, the remaining two matches were in
their third set. With Cathrall trailing 5-2 in his No. 3
match against Kevin Gilette, most of the fans' atten
tion was focused on the No. 4 match, where Mark
Jacobson was serving, trailing Pat Crow 3-2.
But while Jacobson was broken and then beaten
in the next game to go down 5-2 himself. Cathrall.
perhaps buoyed by the encouragement of teammates
Gary Gerstman and Andy Sands, won two straight
games.
Then, moments after Crow broke Jacobson again

to win the match, 3-6, 6-4, 6-2, Cathrall. down 4-5,
was serving with the game score 3-3. Cathrall's
leaping overhead smash enabled him to dodge the
match point, tying the set at 5-5.
After breaking Gilette 4-1 In the next game,
Cathrall fired two straight aces before his backhand
volley completed the comeback, 2-6, 6-4, 7-5.
"I thought I had a chance (when down in the third
set)," Cathrall said, "because I was pushing three-all
on his serve a lot, over and over, and 1 just seemed to
not be able to push it over. I figured that if I could get
up early on his serve. I could break it. That just hap
pened to happen, and once that happened I felt really
confident, which was kind of cool. I really had it
going."
"I wasn't serving that well the whole match, over
all," Cathrall said about his flurry of aces. "I had been
concentrating on keeping my shoulders level because
they were dropping, and my head was coming down
a lot the last couple of days. It just happened to be up
those couple of serves. ... I got it going and 1 served
big."
If ever there was a case of a player's pertormace
rubbing off on his teammates, this was it. Not only
did Cathrall and Eric Peus (ranked 45th) spring to a
5-0 lead against Failla and Will Moravec. but Tarango
and Jacobson pounced on the 14th-ranked team of
Bergh and Hultgren at No. 2 to lead 5-1.
The 49er teams each came back a bit, but in the
end it was Cathrall and Peus winning their fourth
straight and raising their record to 16-5 with a 6-3,
6-3 win. and Tarango throwing his racket in the air
after he and Jacobson clinched the team victory. 6-1.
1-6, 6-2.
McEnroe and Moody then completed the doubles
sweep with a 7-6 (8-6), 6-3 win over No. 18 Crow and
Gillette. It was the fourth straight win for the
reunited duo and upped their record to 6-1.
Tarango described the feeling of the team coming
out of the locker room for doubles.
"The attitude," he said, "basically was we had been
playing good doubles in practice and we finally have
set doubles (teams), and we were pretty confident, I
think. We were confident once we got to doubles that
we were going to win."
"We needed the win and we got it, against a good
team," said Stanford Coach Dick Gould. "Fort
unately, everybody's reasonably healthy; that's going
to be the key for the rest of the week, to keep everyone
healthy. We are going to need a lot of fan support. I
think it's very important against USC and UCLA."
