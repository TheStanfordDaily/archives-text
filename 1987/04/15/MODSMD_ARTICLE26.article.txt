### ROBERT PORTNOY Staff writer 
Nothing like a little extra batting practice before a
big Pacific 10 Southern Division series.
That's what yesterday's affair in San Francisco
turned out to be. The Stanford baseball team, ranked
third by ESPN and fourth by Baseball America, bat
tered USF, 18-6, on the strength of six homeruns â€”
the most hit In a game by the Cardinal since April 9.
1985 when it knocked out seven.
Stanford improved its overall record to 29-11,
while the Dons dropped to 13-27. The Cardinal will
take its Six-Pac leading 12 4 record into Tucson to
face the struggling Arizona Wildcats in a three-game
set beginning Thursday.
The Cardinal attack was led by senior centerfielder
Toi Cook, who hit two solo homeruns and two
singles, scored three times and stole two bases.
"1 went back to my old batting style, the way I hit
last year, standing straight but bent at the waist, not
bending my knees like I have been. It went really well.
I don't know why 1 went away from what worked for
me before, but you're always trying to get that extra
edge," Cook said.
Junior designated hitter Jeff Saenger collected
four RBIs on a two-run homer and a two-run single
in four at-bats. Senior Mark Machtolf, who started
because catcher Doug Robbins was given the day off,
knocked in four runs on a two-run homer and two
run single. Sophomore second baseman Frank Carey
added two doubles and three RBIs in four trips.

Sophomore Brian Keyser picked up the win for the
Cardinal, upping his record to 4-1. Mike Supple took
the loss for USF to fall to 3-5. Keyser, however,
pitched just the first three innings, giving up four
runs on seven hits. Senior lefty A 1 Osuna, who saw
only an inning of action last weekend against UCLA,
threw the next three, giving up a run on two hits.
Freshman Mark Carper allowed three hits and a run
in two innings of work, and junior David Reis
pitched the ninth, surrendering one hit.
The Stanford barrage took no time getting started.
It began with back-to-back solo homers in the first
inning by Cook and sophomore Ed Sprague, the reg
ular third baseman who started behind the plate in
place of Doug Robbins. Then freshman right fielder
Paul Carey reached on an error, and scored on
Saenger's two-run blast. Machtolf walked and Frank
Carey delivered a two-out, run-scoring double. The
first inning would be one of three different innings
in which the Cardinal batted around.
The Stanford hitters didn't wait long to do it again.
The Cardinal sent everyone to the plate in the
second, with the first run coming on Cook's second
homer of the day and sixth of the year. Machtolfs
two-out. two-run single capped the inning after
Sprague had been hit by a pitch and Paul Carey had
singled him to third and stole second.
Stanford again rode the merry-go-round in the
sixth, this time to the tune of four runs. Saenger
started the rally with a bases-loaded two-run single,
which was followed by an RBI single by senior
