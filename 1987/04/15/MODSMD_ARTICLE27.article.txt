# Predictions for pennant races
## 
### 
Even now. so early in the course of a long
162-game schedule, the thoughts of baseball
fans turn toward September, as they consider
the possibility of post-season play for their fa
vorite teams. While rotisserie league
aficionados primarily just worry over the vital
statistics of a fairly randomly selected con
glomeration of (unfortunately) National
Leaguers, the majority of real baseball fans
don't care if their shortstop can hit as long as
he can field, and forgive the catcher's .250 bat
ting average as long as he hits with men in
scoring position — and as long as their team is
in the pennant race.

Ah — the pennant race. Nothing can com
pare to the thrill of being in contention for the
division title in those precious final weeks of
September. Nothing is so disheartening as to
be the doormat of the division by June. So. to
end the suspense now and allay the suffering
of doormat fans, here are my predictions for
the best — and worst — teams in major league
baseball this year.
Starting off in the National League East.
Pittsburgh fans can give up now. Things
haven't been going well the past few years and
won't get any better this year. Montreal won't
fare well either.
The class of this division is the St. Louis

Cardinals, who will recover from last season's
off year to regain the form of their 1985 cham
pionship year. The persistently and consis
tently successful Whitey Herzog still has pretty
much the same team, and the Cardinals can't
possibly suffer the vast numbers of injuries
and slumps that felled them last year. Consis
tent pitching and strong defense will put St.
Louis back at the top of the NL East, while the
Mets will succumb to the pressures of defend
ing a World Series title, inter-squad squab
bling and drug rumors — not to mention
writer's cramp, a malady that has afflicted
most of the Mets since the off-season, when
the entire team wrote autobiographies. The
fact that Len Dykstra "wrote" a book entitled
"Nails" is obnoxious enough to ensure that the
Mets will not repeat.
The National League West, now sadly the
weakest division in baseball despite not having
a franchise in Seattle, has the hottest, most
vogue new team in baseball — the Cincinnati
Reds (really the oldest team in the majors).
Despite their fashionability. the Reds will not
win the NL West. Neither will Houston, al
though the Astros will definitely contend,
something Los Angeles will not. Atlanta and
San Diego haven't a prayer. This leaves, yes.
the Giants. I also picked them last year, so I'm
giving them another chance. San Francisco's
Roger Craig, one of the best managers around,
has a year under his belt, a decent pitching
staff and lots of talented young players.
Besides, this division is kind of a toss-up. so
I'll go with the home team.
The other weak division in baseball — the
one that really does have a Seattle franchise,
and even a Minnesota club — will be won bv

the Texas Rangers. The men from Arlington
will achieve this feat because two of them,
Petes Incaviglia and O'Brien are from my
hometown (Pebble Beach) and third baseman
Steve Buechele is a Stanford product. Clearly.
I'm biased, but Texas is a good young team,
definitely on the upswing, while the other
decent teams in this league. California and
Kansas City, have seen better days. Oakland is
always a factor, but with the A's ever-present
injury troubles, you never know.
The American League East is, as always, the
toughest to predict, because it is Ihe toughest
division. Sad to say. defending champion Bos
ton will probably not repeat, but will contend.
Much ballyhooed Cleveland, the only team in
the division not to finish in first place in this
decade, will fail again this year; the Indians are
much-improved, but arc not. as Sports Il
lustrated claims, "The Best Team in the Ameri
can League". Toronto looks good, but then so
does New York — and despite being an avid
Yankee-hater, I have a horrible feeling it is
"one of those years" — a Yankee Year. My
friends will be shocked at this forecast, but
with five teams so closely bunched (Detroit
should also stay close most of the way), the
dreaded Yanks have an edge in experience,
tradition and just general overall evilness.
They also have Don Mattingly. Despite their
fast start, count Milwaukee out. along with
Baltimore.
Meanwhile, there's an honest-to-goodness,
real-life pennant race going on right now. right
here at Stanford. Why wait for September? My
prediction for May: Stanford will finish first.
UCLA will come in second — and Cal will wind
up dead last.
