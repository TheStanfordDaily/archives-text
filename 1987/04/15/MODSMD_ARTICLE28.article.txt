# Roble Rotisserie: a Yoo-Hoo shake for Jammin’ Jim
## 
### 
A young man from Roble Hall
lives in perpetual fear of being
doused by a full bottle of Yoo-
Hoo chocolatc milk. At least he
should — If he has forgotten.
I'm reminding him now.

Stanford junior Jammln' Jim
Jen, you see, won last year's
Roble Hall rotlsserie league
championship, and it is a tradi
tion to embalm the victor with
that gooey brown stuff. Some
how we never got around to it.
but as rotlsserie started again
last week along with that other
baseball season, my thoughts
returned to milk.
Especially since my team
finished second to Mr. Jen's
last year.
Rotlsserie baseball Is a rather

recently invented game In
which a group of eight or 10
people auction off the players In
the National League (forget the
American League — actually I
shouldn't even have mentioned
that bush league). Eight
statistical categories are then
used to determine whose team
is winning.
We at Roble refer to ourselves
as owners, and the feeling of
power is Intoxicating. Watch
this: I own Eric Davis. I own
Eric Davis. I own Eric Davis.
Whenever I'm feeling down I
click my heels three times and
say, "I own Eric Davis."
In fact, that's the beauty of
rotlsserie baseball — you don't
have to do anything. No rolling
dice, no looking up numbers on
little cards, none of that strato
schlock.
You Just wake up every morn
ing. sprint downstairs and look
at the box scores. Keith
Moreland stole a goddamned
