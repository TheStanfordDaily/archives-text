# Roble Rotisserie: a Yoo-Hoo shake for Jammin’ Jim
## 
### 
A young man from Roble Hall
lives in perpetual fear of being
doused by a full bottle of Yoo-
Hoo chocolatc milk. At least he
should — If he has forgotten.
I'm reminding him now.

Stanford junior Jammln' Jim
Jen, you see, won last year's
Roble Hall rotlsserie league
championship, and it is a tradi
tion to embalm the victor with
that gooey brown stuff. Some
how we never got around to it.
but as rotlsserie started again
last week along with that other
baseball season, my thoughts
returned to milk.
Especially since my team
finished second to Mr. Jen's
last year.
Rotlsserie baseball Is a rather

recently invented game In
which a group of eight or 10
people auction off the players In
the National League (forget the
American League — actually I
shouldn't even have mentioned
that bush league). Eight
statistical categories are then
used to determine whose team
is winning.
We at Roble refer to ourselves
as owners, and the feeling of
power is Intoxicating. Watch
this: I own Eric Davis. I own
Eric Davis. I own Eric Davis.
Whenever I'm feeling down I
click my heels three times and
say, "I own Eric Davis."
In fact, that's the beauty of
rotlsserie baseball — you don't
have to do anything. No rolling
dice, no looking up numbers on
little cards, none of that strato
schlock.
You Just wake up every morn
ing. sprint downstairs and look
at the box scores. Keith

base! Dickie Noles got shelled
again. Eric Davis went 4-for-4
with three stolen bases and also
picked up the save.
No time for that 9 a.m. class —
I've got to compute my team ERA.
Okay, so we get a little obsessed.
Jim turned to me the other day
and said, "The fire is back. I set
my alarm clock 15 minutes earlier
so I could get to the sports page

first."
Uh, yeah. Yoo-Hoo.
The actual auction itself was
more fun than I've had since
watching Bill Buckner part his
legs last October. Each of the
"owners" had $285 in play money
to buy 10 pitchers and 15 hitters.
The problem I had was that al
most every player 1 wanted was
"cute". And Kris Gowen, the only
female owner In our league (the
name of her team is Kris'
Krushes), attached no monetary
limits to her roving eye. So 1 didn't
get St. Louis rlghtfielder Jim Lin
deman (030), Willie McGee (*lB -

remember, he looks like E.T.), nor
Susan Slusser's favorite beau,
John Tudor (*37).
But I do have Eric Davis.
Then there's the dark side of
rotisserie baseball — injuries and
ruthlessness. When Giants'
shortstop Jose Uribe limped
across the plate with the winning
run against the Dodger's last
Friday, we shrieked in delight,
hoping he was headed for the dis
abled list.
Yes. I admit it. Every night I
pray that Pedro Guerrero's knee
gives out again. Hey, if my fellow
owners can invent a new way for

Eric Davis to die every day. I can
pray for a knee to blow up. Espe
cially since Jim owns Pedro.
Last week one of the Roble
owners found out Jody Davis had
broken a finger. The owner didn't
tell anyone, and quickly traded
Davis to an unwitting owner
(could it have been Jim Jen?).
It ain't always pretty, but it's
fun. So if you're looking for a rea
son to skip classes and listen to
meaningless Giants games, start
up a rotisserie league. It's not too
late.
Remember that Jammin' Jim.
It's never too late for milk.
