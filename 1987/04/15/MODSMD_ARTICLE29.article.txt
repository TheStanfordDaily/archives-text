layouts in the Phoenix area. She shot 76
yesterday and finds herself in 13th place
overall after 36 holes.

among the Stanford players at 156. She
shot 79 in the opening round to trail both
McCarthy and senior Adrienne Gilmartin,
but rebounded with a 77 yesterday to trail
McCarthy by five shots. Gilmartin shot 77
Monday, but fell to 81 yesterday for a 158
total.
Sophomore Clare Dolan struggled to an
82 the first day and was able only to pare
two strokes off that in the second round.
Her 162 total is three ahead of junior Trish
McGonigle, who recovered from a dismal
opening-round 89 to shoot a gutty 76 yes
terday for a 165 total.
Stanford held the position it occupied
after the first round of the tournament.
With 18 holes complete, the Cardinal was
