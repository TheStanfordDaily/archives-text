# Experiment acquires shuttle berth

An electronics experiment designed by Stan
ford scientists has been scheduled for inclu
sion in a future space shuttle mission, re
searchers have announced.
The scientists' contribution to the shuttle
flight will be a 12-mile-long tether designed to
measure currents and voltage while the shuttle
is in flight. The experiment has been sched
uled for the shuttle's 50th flight, which will
take place no sooner than October 1990, ac
cording to the Times Tribune. The Challenger
disaster of January 1986 was the 25th shuttle
launch.
"This type of experiment has not been done
so far," said a Stanford associate professor
who did not wish to be named. "This is the
first time a large electrodynamic structure has
been flown In that environment. We don't
know what the consequences will be, and we
cannot guess results."
The experiment will work like a big fishing
reel, with a satellite at the end of a long wire,
according to Antony Fraser-Smith, a senior re

search associate at Stanford Electronics Labo
ratory (SEL).
"When the conditions are right, they (the
astronauts) will reel it out, first only about 12
miles, later maybe up to (62 miles)," Fraser-
Smith said. The purpose of letting out the tet
her is so we can test what the atmosphere is
really like. You cannot accurately test on the
shuttle because it is always breaking the
sound barrier, and (it stirs up a lot of gases)."
"It may be possible to tap the electricity or to
draw power," said Rock Bush, research associ
ate at SEL. "Another possibility is to drive
power through the tether."
According to Bush, other aims of the experi
ment are to investigate the dynamics of deploy
ment of a long tether, to Investigate the inter
action of two objects in space and to learn
about the environment.
The experiment was originally proposed by
Roger Williamson, senior research associate at
SEL, and Electrical Engineering Prof. Peter
Banks, when they were at UC-San Diego In
1976. According to Bush, who has been at

Stanford for three years, various ideas were
considered along the way.
The proposal for the experiment, known as
the Shuttle Electrodynamic Tether System
(SETS), was not submitted in Its present form
until about two years ago.
Banks has been involved in two previous
space shuttle experiments, in March 1982 on
the third shuttle flight, and in July 1985 on
Space Lab 11. Bush, who works closely with
Banks and Williamson, said both experiments
were successful. Bush said he was primarily
involved in the Space Lab experiment and was
responsible for its scientific mission and plan
ning.
According to Fraser-Smith, NASA has been
pushing for increased international coopera
tion. The Initial tether system project began as
a joint U.S.-Italian venture. The United States
is responsible for designing and building the
tether and deployer, while Italy will construct
the satellite.
NASA has contracted Stanford to do re
search for several years, according to Fraser-
Smith.
