### ROBERT PORTNOY Staff writer 
With the second round of the
Western Intercollegiate under
Its belt, the Stanford men's golf
team Is in 16th place with 18
holes on tap for today In sunny
Santa Cruz.
Freshman Mark Funseth is
the story of the week for the
Cardinal. He has startled a stel
lar field with two superb
rounds of golf on the difficult
Pasatiempo golf course, tying
him for sixth place with two
other golfers, Just seven strokes
off the lead. Funseth carded a
73 yesterday to go with his 71
in the opening round for a 144
total shared by California's
Mark Sanchez and first-round
co-leader Paul Dletsche of San
Jose State.

'Mark played his first tourna
ment back In January. Since
then, he has put together some
excellent tournaments. If he
had parred the last four holes of
the our tournament (the Stan
ford U.S. Intercollegiate), he
would've finished fourth In an
excellent field." Stanford Coach
Tim Schaaf said.
"Here he's In sixth place
among some of the best players
In the country. He's In a posi
tion where he could win and
certainly finish very high In a
field of potential All-
Americans."
Fresno State leads the tourn
ament with a 728 total, six
strokes ahead of surprise first
round leader Cal. Santa Bar
bara is just four shots behind
the Bears, with Arizona and
UCLA another shot back at
739.
