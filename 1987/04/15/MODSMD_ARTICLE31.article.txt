the quality of play will not be
reduced. The Golddlggers, 11-3 on
the season, will battle the 10-2 Los
Angeles Starlites for sole posses
sion of first place in the league.

Los Angeles won't roll over and

like a "Who's Who" in volleyball.
They are led by three members of
the silver-medal-winning 1984

Crockett and Jeanne Beauprey.
Also on their roster is Tracy Clark,
who was a three-time Ail-

men's volleyball team, will be ser
ving as a commentator for the
ESPN broadcast of the game, to be
aired on a tape-delay basis Sunday
night at 9 p.m.
