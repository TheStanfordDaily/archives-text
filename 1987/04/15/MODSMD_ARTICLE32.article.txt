### CLAY CALVERT Staff writer 
Despite a worsening problem of overcrowding in
California prisons, the warden of San Quentin State
Prison said here last night that he supports stiffer
criminal sentences.
Daniel Vasquez, warden at the state's oldest
maximum-security facility, which holds 3,200
prisoners, made his remarks last night to about 70
people at Branner Hall.
Rather than giving lighter sentences and increas
ing the number of prisoners paroled as a way of
dealing with overcrowding, Vasquez said he sup
ports Gov. George Deukmejian's move to build more
prisons.
"It's a choice we have to make and I think this
governor has made that choice," Vasquez said,
noting that the state needs more space to hold the
most violent and dangerous criminals threatening
society.
"I think in the state of California we're biting the
bullet, if you will. We're saying, 'Folks, its going to
cost money. It's going to cost money to have safety
and security in your community.' "
Vasquez gave a strong vote of support for capital
punishrrtent. He said that although capital punish
ment does not deter all criminals, it can serve "as a
deterrent on an individual basis."
He pointed to wide public support for both capital

punishment and tougher sentencing.
"The voting public in the state of California made
some very historic decisions last November." he said.
"They changed three state supreme court justices,
one who was the chief justice (Rose Bird). It's the
first time it has ever happened in the state of Califor
nia."
Bird was voted out of office largely because she
overturned death sentences.
While he said building more prisons is one way of
dealing with overcrowding in prisons, Vasquez
stressed that all solutions have problems.
"It costs either way." he said. "If we're real lenient,
it may cost us in threatening the safety and security
of our communities. If we're too harsh. It may cost us
in prisons and prison beds."
The warden of the 135-year-old prison also cited
AIDS and drug use in state prisons as issues of great
concern.
"AIDS in the prison system is getting to be more
and more of an issue," Vasquez said, explaining that
the disease is transmitted in prisons largely through
acts of homosexual rape and dirty needles used by in
travenous drug users.
Drugs are brought into prisons by corrupt guards
and visitors hiding them in bodily orifices, he said.
Vasquez also commented on the prison's most fa
mous inmate. Charles Manson.
"He's a crazy mad-dog killer and I don't go out of
my way to talk to him," Vasquez said.
