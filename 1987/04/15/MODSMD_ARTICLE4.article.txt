# Western Culture
## Track changes spark protest 
### TOM OSCHERWITZ Staff writer 
Several professors yesterday as
sailed the report of the Western
Culture task force, released Mon
day, which recommended broad
ening the program's cultural
parameters.
The critics said the recommen
dations require a breadth of
knowledge beyond the capacity of
most current Instructors and call
for the elimination of core reading
lists, which they feel are essential.
The task force report calls on
Western Culture tracks to focus
on a non-European culture, in
clude primary texts by women and
minorities, and abolish the core
list of readings, currently common
to all tracks.
The current Western Culture
program "is not perfect as it is,
but this will destroy it," said En
glish Prof. Ronald Rebholz. "Only
a cultural anthropologist" could
have the wide range of knowledge
needed to teach under the new
program, Rebholz said.
The requirements will "elim
inate virtually all the professors
who are currently teaching this
course," he added.
English Prof. William Chace

said he read the proposal with
"dismay" and "deep regret."
Already, professors "have the sen
sation of traveling too fast" during
the Western Culture sequence. By
expanding to world culture, the
task force is mandating a "vapid"
and "thin-blooded" curriculum,
Chace said.
"Who is going to teach this
course?" Chace asked.
Herbert Lindenberger, professor
of comparative literature and En
glish, said "There may be people
with the experience, but not
enough to teach 1,500 students
each year."
Lindenberger said he, like many
of his colleagues, was "trained to
teach in the tradition of the West."
Assoc. Classics Prof. Susan
Stephens argued that professors
could design teachable courses
under the task force's guidelines.
Stephens, a member of the West
ern Culture task force and a lec
turer in the program's Conflict
and Change track, said professors
could team up in fields in which
they are uncertain. Currently, in
the Conflict and Change track,
one professor lectures on Islam
