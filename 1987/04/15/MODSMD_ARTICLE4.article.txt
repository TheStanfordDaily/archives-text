# Western Culture
## Track changes spark protest 
### TOM OSCHERWITZ Staff writer 
Several professors yesterday as
sailed the report of the Western
Culture task force, released Mon
day, which recommended broad
ening the program's cultural
parameters.
The critics said the recommen
dations require a breadth of
knowledge beyond the capacity of
most current Instructors and call
for the elimination of core reading
lists, which they feel are essential.
The task force report calls on
Western Culture tracks to focus
on a non-European culture, in
clude primary texts by women and
minorities, and abolish the core
list of readings, currently common
to all tracks.
The current Western Culture
program "is not perfect as it is,
but this will destroy it," said En
glish Prof. Ronald Rebholz. "Only
a cultural anthropologist" could
have the wide range of knowledge
needed to teach under the new
program, Rebholz said.
The requirements will "elim
inate virtually all the professors
who are currently teaching this
course," he added.
English Prof. William Chace

said he read the proposal with
"dismay" and "deep regret."
Already, professors "have the sen
sation of traveling too fast" during
the Western Culture sequence. By
expanding to world culture, the
task force is mandating a "vapid"
and "thin-blooded" curriculum,
Chace said.
"Who is going to teach this
course?" Chace asked.
Herbert Lindenberger, professor
of comparative literature and En
glish, said "There may be people
with the experience, but not
enough to teach 1,500 students
each year."
Lindenberger said he, like many
of his colleagues, was "trained to
teach in the tradition of the West."
Assoc. Classics Prof. Susan
Stephens argued that professors
could design teachable courses
under the task force's guidelines.
Stephens, a member of the West
ern Culture task force and a lec
turer in the program's Conflict
and Change track, said professors
could team up in fields in which
they are uncertain. Currently, in
the Conflict and Change track,
one professor lectures on Islam
and another on Christianity, she
said.
The new program will require
professors "to reconceptuallze"
their method of teaching. Step
hens said. One need not teach
chronologically, she said, noting
that one can critique Plato as a
totalitarian through the study of
Nazi Germany.
Assoc. History Prof. Clay Car
son, also a member of the task
force, said, "We provide the
framework. The professors will be
responsible for the innovation."
The proposal "keeps the older
goals, but adds cultural diversity."
Carson added.
Professors also expressed'con
cern over the absence of core texts
from the new proposal.
Lindenberger said, "I share (the
Western Culture task force's) con
cern for the Idea that texts are im
bedded in culture," but a student
needs to have a sense of major
ideas and texts. "Students should
know texts for their intrinsic
value."

The task force may have been so
conscious of reforming the idea of
Western Culture that it "threw out
the baby with the bathwater."
Lindenberger said.
Since the Greeks, people have
believed in an "intellectual tradi
tion" and in a collection of signifi
cant texts that relate to each
other. Lindenberger said. "It is
gloriously arrogant of this great
Western university for it to sud
denly decide to break with a
2,500-year Intellectual tradition."
According to Rebholz, the great
texts unite the various tracks and
provide students a common
medium for discussion. "The
whole idea behind the core
reading list is to give students
something to talk about besides
the weather," Rebholz said.
Stephens argued that the shift
in emphasis is from using books
as a primary object of study
toward emphasizing cultural di
versity. "People should spend
more time looking at things
besides simply written artifacts,"
Stephens said.
According to Carson. "It's how
we respond to a work that makes
it great."

Many of the "great works" will
be reflected in the various read
ings, Carson said. When people
read Wollstencraft, for example,
they learn about Rousseau, he
said. "People can learn about Marx
as he is seen and absorbed by
Third World countries."
"It is important for people to
realize that Aristotle might mean
something different to those at
the bottom of the heap than to
those at the top," Carson added.
Chace warned that the task
force's recommendations threat
ened the Internal modifications
started by professors in the
various Western Culture tracks.
"The Western Culture tracks have
already been moving in the right
direction," Chace said.
According to Rebholz, most
courses would by necessity focus
on recent history because the
writing of women and ethnic
minorities rarely was published
until the 18th century. "I think
the ancient world is gone." Reb
holz said.
The Committee on Undergradu
ate Studies will examine the pro
posal next Wednesday, McCall
said.
