# Kennedy looks to Stanford's future
## 
### MARK LAWRENCE Senior staff writer 
University President Donald
Kennedy said yesterday that the
University's $1.1 billion Centen
nial fund-raising drive is off to a
good start, but he cautioned that
Stanford will have to overcome
lean federal budgets to achieve its
goals over the next 25 years.
"We went out the door very suc
cessfully," Kennedy said. But he
said congressional efforts to cut
the federal deficit over the next
two decades mean there will be
less federal money available for
universities.
In his first interview since he
returned to the presidency at the
beginning of spring quarter, Ken
nedy said his winter quarter leave
enabled him to take a long, in
depth look at Stanford's future
and to chart a course that will
head off problems Stanford may
encounter before the year 2010.
"The Idea (of the sabbatical) was
really to tell me a little bit more
about what I ought to emphasize
in the next period of my
presidency here, what things I
ought to leave time to work on,
what changes we most need to see
made around here," Kennedy

said. "We made very good progress
In that planning exercise during
the quarter."
But Kennedy said there Is more
work to be done to complete a
comprehensive plan for the Uni
versity to follow until 2010. He
said he and a committee of faculty
and staff members will finish de
veloping the plan by June. He said
the plan will be announced
publicly after the Board of Trus
tees discusses it during a retreat
scheduled for September.
Kennedy said his work on long
range planning and fund raising
for the University's $1.1 billion
Centennial campaign will require
so much of his time that he may
be less visible on campus.
"I think for the period of the
Centennial, I am going to be some
what more of an outside president
than I was for the first six-and-a
half years," Kennedy said.
Although Kennedy would not
comment on specifics of the Uni
versity's comprehensive plan, he
said the committee is considering
responses to both external and in
ternal challenges Stanford will
confront in the near future.
When Centennial campaign
goals were announced in
February, Kennedy said Stan
ford's top priorities were rebuild
ing the science and engineering
facilities on the west side of
campus, building new student
housing, expanding financial aid
and adding 100 new endowed
professorships.
On issues beyond Stanford,

Kennedy said, the committee is
working to develop strategies for
maintaining scarce federal fund
ing for Stanford through years
when government money is ex
pected to be distributed more
evenly among U.S. universities.
Kennedy said, however, that he
is hopeful that the federal govern
ment will provide matching funds
for renovation of the Near West
Campus.
In the near future, Kennedy
said, he hopes to continue the
early success of the Centennial

campaign, which will continue
through 1991.
He said he was encouraged that
donations have not fallen off since
Jan. 1, when the new federal tax
law took effect.
He said he is also pleased with
the feedback he has been getting
about Stanford's *1.1 billion
fund-raising goal.
"We worried that the goal would
seem greedy rather than auda
cious." Kennedy said. "But that
has not been the general reac
tion."
