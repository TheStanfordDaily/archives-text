# Expert blasts U.S. television

The values displayed by American tele
vision run more in line with a
totalitarian society than with a free soci
ety. according to a British television ex
ecutive who spoke here last night.
"In the sacred name of competition,
the three networks aim identical pro
grams at identical people at identical
times," said Jeremy Isaacs, chief execu
tive of Channel 4, London. Issacs, the
featured speaker for the annual
McClatchy Memorial Lecture, com
plained that American television offers
far too much entertainment and far too
little educational programming.
The networks "entertain a certain sort
of viewer with a certain type of program
ming and neglect all others." he said.
"And I exaggerate only a little."
American television, fueled by adver
tising dollars, can be seen as an arm of
commerce. Just as all broadcasting in a
totalitarian society serves state

purposes, he said.
"In a totalitarian society, there must
be one set of programming with all pro
grams having the same interests in com
mon," Isaacs said. In the United States,
"in a free market society, there must
also be (one set of programming inter
ests) — or so the networks would have
us believe."
Issacs contrasted the homogenous
programming seen in the United States
with the more diverse shows that
British television stations offer. In Eng
land, he said, TV stations have found
they can attract audiences with public
service shows as well as with the com
mercial entertainment shows that
pervade U.S. television.
Unlike American broadcasting,
British programming reflects the belief
that there is no single audience — "no
one monolithic receptor, which pro
gramming should aim for."
Among the products of Channel 4
recognizable to Americans are "My
Beautiful Laundrette" and "A Room with

a View," both highly regarded films
shown in the United States in 1986, and
Max Headroom, a computerized,
telegenic television announcer.
Channel 4. an independent station es
tablished by the British Parliament,
seeks to serve cultural and ethnic
minorities, Isaacs said. The channel
prides itself on its innovative program
ming, including "rude film, not very
rude, not, of course, pornography," and
on shows for the deaf and for gays, he
added.
In its six years of existence, Channel 4
has broadened the range of programs
that may be shown on regular television
"without frightening the horses," Isaacs
said.
And that is a noble aim of broadcast
ing, according to Isaacs. Broadcasting
"should cater for Individual choices,
pleasing all (viewers) some of the time
and daring to offend some of us to please
others."
