Gorbachev makes arms offer
MOSCOW — Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev has made another
new offer — to eliminate all Soviet shorter-range nuclear missiles
from Europe within a "relatively short and clearly defined time
frame" — in order to achieve a medium-range missile accord with
the United States, the Soviet news agency Tass said early today.
Tass said the newest offer, which It said goes well beyond one
made public last weekend, was made by Gorbachev in a Kremlin
meeting with Secretary of State George Shultz yesterday.
The Tass account did not make It clear whether Gorbachev was
offering to dismantle or destroy all shorter-range missiles or only
to move them from Europe. Tass' English-language version used
the word "eliminate." The Russian-language account used a Rus
sian version of the word "liquidate."
Tass said that it followed from Shultz's explanations in the
meeting "that the U.S. administration, together with Its allies In
NATO, is not prepared to reach zero in the question of shorter
range missiles, that they have no final stand on the matter."
Shultz said before the Moscow bargaining began that any such
new proposed from the Soviets would have to be discussed in detail
with U.S. allies in Europe, whose security would be directly af
fected by changes In the deployments of the nuclear missiles.
If the Tass account accurately represented the state of the U.S.-
Soviet bargaining at the end of the meeting with Gorbachev, it
seemed likely that Shultz will leave Moscow later today without
answering the Soviet proposal.
Trade deficit soars in February
WASHINGTON — The nation's trade woes continued In
February as merchandise imports outpaced exports by *15.1 bil
lion, the third-highest monthly trade deficit ever and a level well
beyond market expectations, the Department of Commerce re
ported yesterday.
But the department, disclosing what it called an Improved sys
tem for estimating the import-export data, sharply revised
downward January's deficit figure from an earlier reported >14.8
billion to >12.3 billion. In addition, for all of 1986, it cut >3.5 bil
lion from the trade deficit to a new estimate of >166.3 billion,
though it was still the highest ever.
Some economists believe that the January and February figures
are a sign of a downward trend in the trade deficit, an interpreta
tion that was bolstered slightly by the fact that U.S. exports
jumped >2.3 billion to >18.7 billion for the month, the best gross
export record in four months.
Moreover, economists pointed out that the recent sharp decline
in the dollar makes the picture look worse than it really is by
driving up the nominal value of imports and shrinking the
nominal value of exports.
However, the reported >15.1 billion February deficit, the worst
since last November's >15.4 billion gap and surpassed only by last
July's >16.1 billion, was cold comfort at best. Market analysts gen
erally had expected the deficit to be between >13 billion and >14
billion.
"It's two years since the dollar peaked, and we would have hoped
to see more Improvement by this time, but there is almost noth
ing. The value of imports keeps going up, while foreign demand
for our goods has not responded enough to offset that," said Sara
Johnson of Data Resources Inc., an economic forecasting concern

Fourth Marine to be questioned
WASHINGTON — A fourth Marine assigned to guard U.S.
diplomatic posts in the Soviet Union has been detained on
suspicion of espionage and administration sources said yesterday
there are likely to be additional arrests in connection with security
breaches at key embassies and consulates.
In a related move, the U.S. ambassador to Austria ordered five
Marine guards to leave the embassy in Vienna and return to the
United States for questioning in the government investigation of
security lapses, the Defense Department said yesterday.
Four of the Marines ordered home from Vienna are suspected of
having had sexual relations with foreign women while on previous
assignments in Warsaw Pact countries. The fifth Marine was
recalled because of allegations that he violated other embassy
security regulations unrelated to the ongoing espionage investiga
tion. according to Pentagon spokesman Robert Sims.
Administration officials said yesterday that the widening Inves
tigation is now centered on two dozen Marine guards who either
are under suspicion of allowing security breaches or who may be
key witnesses injudicial proceedings against those who have been
accused. The sources said additional arrests are expected In com
ing weeks.
Poll shows doubt in Reagan
SANTA BARBARA, Calif. — Two of three Americans say they
believe President Reagan is not telling the truth about the Iran
contra affair, a sharp increase since a month ago, according to a
new Washington Post-ABC News poll.
Despite the president's attempts In recent weeks to answer the
criticism of the Tower special review board and to shift public at
tention to other matters, the poll shows that the president's over
all approval rating has not improved and public skepticism about
the Iran-contra affair has grown.
At the same time, however, the survey found that, by 2 to 1.
Americans also believe Reagan is honest. Surveys done for the
White House by pollster Richard Wirthlln have shown a similar
trend, in which Reagan is described by those questioned as gener
ally honest but not telling the truth about Iran, a Republican
strategist said.
Reagan's support, which plummeted after the Iran arms sales
were disclosed, stabilized in February but "has not significantly
recovered" since then, the strategist said. In the Interim, Reagan
has made intensive efforts to rebuild his political strength and
brought In a new team of White House advisers under Chief of
Staff Howard Baker.
The new survey comes as those advisers are planning a shift in
emphasis in Reagan's agenda, hoping to take advantage of a per
iod of relative quiet before the congressional hearings gear up on
Iran later this spring.
Bond denies using cocaine
ATLANTA — In his first public comments on allegations by his
estranged wife that he uses cocaine, former Georgia state Sen.
Julian Bond denied yesterday that he has ever used the drug and
accused the press of making "life hell for Innocent people."
Bond, who has become the center of a controversy here since
the allegations surfaced last weekend in news reports, said that
his wife had retracted the charges she had made "In anger" to At
lanta police in mid-March and that he was "satisfied with her
withdrawal."
"What is at issue here is a family affair, of concern only to those
who are Intimately Involved," he said, reading from a prepared
statement at a news conference on the Morehouse College campus
here. "As far as we are concerned, the matter is closed."
Bond, interviewed later on a radio talk show, said "I've never
used cocaine, never at all."
The Atlanta Journal and the Atlanta Constitution, in their
combined editions Saturday, reported that Bond's wife. Alice,
voluntarily told narcotics officers March 19 that her husband was
abusing cocaine and that she could no longer put up with it.

brought In a new team of White House advisers under Chief of
Staff Howard Baker.
The new survey comes as those advisers are planning a shift in
emphasis in Reagan's agenda, hoping to take advantage of a per
iod of relative quiet before the congressional hearings gear up on
Iran later this spring.
Bond denies using cocaine
ATLANTA — In his first public comments on allegations by his
estranged wife that he uses cocaine, former Georgia state Sen.
Julian Bond denied yesterday that he has ever used the drug and
accused the press of making "life hell for Innocent people."
Bond, who has become the center of a controversy here since
the allegations surfaced last weekend in news reports, said that
his wife had retracted the charges she had made "In anger" to At
lanta police in mid-March and that he was "satisfied with her
withdrawal."
"What is at issue here is a family affair, of concern only to those
who are Intimately Involved," he said, reading from a prepared
statement at a news conference on the Morehouse College campus
here. "As far as we are concerned, the matter is closed."
Bond, interviewed later on a radio talk show, said "I've never
used cocaine, never at all."
The Atlanta Journal and the Atlanta Constitution, in their
combined editions Saturday, reported that Bond's wife. Alice,
voluntarily told narcotics officers March 19 that her husband was
abusing cocaine and that she could no longer put up with it.

Gorbachev makes arms offer
MOSCOW — Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev has made another
new offer — to eliminate all Soviet shorter-range nuclear missiles
from Europe within a "relatively short and clearly defined time
frame" — in order to achieve a medium-range missile accord with
the United States, the Soviet news agency Tass said early today.
Tass said the newest offer, which It said goes well beyond one
made public last weekend, was made by Gorbachev in a Kremlin
meeting with Secretary of State George Shultz yesterday.
The Tass account did not make It clear whether Gorbachev was
offering to dismantle or destroy all shorter-range missiles or only
to move them from Europe. Tass' English-language version used
the word "eliminate." The Russian-language account used a Rus
sian version of the word "liquidate."
Tass said that it followed from Shultz's explanations in the
meeting "that the U.S. administration, together with Its allies In
NATO, is not prepared to reach zero in the question of shorter
range missiles, that they have no final stand on the matter."
Shultz said before the Moscow bargaining began that any such
new proposed from the Soviets would have to be discussed in detail
with U.S. allies in Europe, whose security would be directly af
fected by changes In the deployments of the nuclear missiles.
If the Tass account accurately represented the state of the U.S.-
Soviet bargaining at the end of the meeting with Gorbachev, it
seemed likely that Shultz will leave Moscow later today without
answering the Soviet proposal.
Trade deficit soars in February
WASHINGTON — The nation's trade woes continued In
February as merchandise imports outpaced exports by *15.1 bil
lion, the third-highest monthly trade deficit ever and a level well
beyond market expectations, the Department of Commerce re
ported yesterday.
But the department, disclosing what it called an Improved sys
tem for estimating the import-export data, sharply revised
downward January's deficit figure from an earlier reported >14.8
billion to >12.3 billion. In addition, for all of 1986, it cut >3.5 bil
lion from the trade deficit to a new estimate of >166.3 billion,
though it was still the highest ever.
Some economists believe that the January and February figures
are a sign of a downward trend in the trade deficit, an interpreta
tion that was bolstered slightly by the fact that U.S. exports
jumped >2.3 billion to >18.7 billion for the month, the best gross
export record in four months.
Moreover, economists pointed out that the recent sharp decline
in the dollar makes the picture look worse than it really is by
driving up the nominal value of imports and shrinking the
nominal value of exports.
However, the reported >15.1 billion February deficit, the worst
since last November's >15.4 billion gap and surpassed only by last
July's >16.1 billion, was cold comfort at best. Market analysts gen
erally had expected the deficit to be between >13 billion and >14
billion.
"It's two years since the dollar peaked, and we would have hoped
to see more Improvement by this time, but there is almost noth
ing. The value of imports keeps going up, while foreign demand
for our goods has not responded enough to offset that," said Sara
Johnson of Data Resources Inc., an economic forecasting concern
in Lexington. Mass.
Fourth Marine to be questioned
WASHINGTON — A fourth Marine assigned to guard U.S.
diplomatic posts in the Soviet Union has been detained on
suspicion of espionage and administration sources said yesterday
there are likely to be additional arrests in connection with security
breaches at key embassies and consulates.
In a related move, the U.S. ambassador to Austria ordered five
Marine guards to leave the embassy in Vienna and return to the
United States for questioning in the government investigation of
security lapses, the Defense Department said yesterday.
Four of the Marines ordered home from Vienna are suspected of
having had sexual relations with foreign women while on previous
assignments in Warsaw Pact countries. The fifth Marine was
recalled because of allegations that he violated other embassy
security regulations unrelated to the ongoing espionage investiga
tion. according to Pentagon spokesman Robert Sims.
Administration officials said yesterday that the widening Inves
tigation is now centered on two dozen Marine guards who either
are under suspicion of allowing security breaches or who may be
key witnesses injudicial proceedings against those who have been
accused. The sources said additional arrests are expected In com
ing weeks.
Poll shows doubt in Reagan
SANTA BARBARA, Calif. — Two of three Americans say they
believe President Reagan is not telling the truth about the Iran
contra affair, a sharp increase since a month ago, according to a
new Washington Post-ABC News poll.
Despite the president's attempts In recent weeks to answer the
criticism of the Tower special review board and to shift public at
tention to other matters, the poll shows that the president's over
all approval rating has not improved and public skepticism about
the Iran-contra affair has grown.
At the same time, however, the survey found that, by 2 to 1.
Americans also believe Reagan is honest. Surveys done for the
White House by pollster Richard Wirthlln have shown a similar
trend, in which Reagan is described by those questioned as gener
ally honest but not telling the truth about Iran, a Republican
strategist said.
Reagan's support, which plummeted after the Iran arms sales
were disclosed, stabilized in February but "has not significantly
recovered" since then, the strategist said. In the Interim, Reagan
has made intensive efforts to rebuild his political strength and
brought In a new team of White House advisers under Chief of
Staff Howard Baker.
The new survey comes as those advisers are planning a shift in
emphasis in Reagan's agenda, hoping to take advantage of a per
