### 
Tuesday the ASSU Senate will consider a
proposal to officially remove student repre
sentatives from the Committee on Invest
ment Responsibility (CIR) next year.
Meanwhile, John van Loben Sels, one of
this year's three student representatives on
the committee, resigned in protest yesterday,
charging that the CIR is overly cautious and
lacks any real authority to influence Univer
sity investment decisions on South Africa.
Unquestionably, the present structure and
policies of the CIR leave much to be desired
â€” but they do not justify a student boycott.
The CIR, a 12-member committee com
prised of students, faculty, staff and alumni,
advises the University Board of Trustees on
investment matters.
As van Loben Sels and other sponsors of
the ASSU proposal correctly point out, the
CIR has no official power to make investment
policy.
Nevertheless, the ClR's effect on trustee di
vestment decisions has been far from incon
siderable.

Over the past year the trustees have voted
to divest of nearly *6 million in stock of com
panies that do business in South Africa.
Nearly all of these divestments were made
based on recommendations prepared by the
CIR.
If the CIR had not been around to investi
gate the conduct of companies doing busi
ness in South Africa and to prepare detailed
recommendations, it is highly unlikely that
the trustees would have divested as much as
they have.
If the ASSU votes to withdraw students
from the CIR next year, the student body will
lose what little voice it has in shaping the
course of the University's divestment policy.
Recent efforts to create a student boycott of
the CIR reflect justifiable frustration at the
ClR's cautiousness and the dreadfully slow
pace of divestment at Stanford.
But despite its faults, the CIR plays an im
portant role in influencing the University's
investment policy. It is a place where student
voices should be heard.
