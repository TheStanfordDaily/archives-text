# Houses are not ghettos
## 
### 
I sense that in her recent viewpoint Pilar Keagy
believes that ethnic theme houses are coun
terproductive because they ghettoize minorities
(Daily, April 1). Other students share her
animosities toward theme houses, but I think most
students on campus do not really understand what
ethnic theme houses are all about.
Do theme houses tend to ghettoize minorities? In
order to answer this question, we need to look at the
facts.

WYATT LEUNG

At most, 50 percent of the residents in an ethnic
theme house are of that ethnicity; the rest are a good
mix of other ethnicities. For example, Casa Zapata
(the Chlcano theme house) this year has 88 resi
dents: four Asian-Americans, four blacks, 26 whites,
43 Chicanos, four native Americans, three non
citizens and four others.
Although the stereotype is that theme houses are
ghettos of a particular ethnic group, the reality is
that each theme house also consists of a diverse mix
of other groups.
It is true that Chicano residents in Zapata often
speak Spanish and participate in Chicano cultural
activities. But if this close tie to Chicano culture is
bad (because it ghettolzes residents), then what is
the point of having a Chicano theme house if resi
dents only speak English and do not get involved in
any cultural events?
I think non-minority students should be more un
derstanding of why minority students may want to
live in a theme house. In their search for identity,
minority students often want to explore what It
means to be an Afro-American, a Chicano, an Asian-
American or whatever. Many of them went to high
schools where there were very few other minority stu
dents.
At Stanford, they may have their first opportunity
to be with a large number of other academically ori
ented, high-achieving minorities. Like everyone else,
they enjoy sharing experiences, concerns and fears
with others like themselves, and so they may choose
to live in ethnic theme houses. In addition, many of
them have expressed the importance of a supportive
environment in helping them to survive the aca
demic pressure and to adjust to University life.
Finally, I want to talk about the deeply rooted
stereotypes of ethnic theme houses. The un
popularity of these houses is reflected in the low
priority for them on students' draw cards. Most stu
dents feel uneasy about living in a theme house.
They often fear that the residents of a theme house

would be hostile to them, they would be segregated
from the main ethnic group, they just wouldn't fit in,
etc.
So I decided to find out whether the reality of living
in an ethnic theme house really confirms their fears.
A summary of what I discovered after reviewing the
most recent residence evaluations of Casa Zapata fol
lows.
As I expected, nearly all non-Chicano students who
were assigned to Zapata did not want to live there in
itially; however, the surprising thing was that after
living in Zapata for a while, almost all of them were
satisfied with their experience and many of them
even enjoyed it.
In the Zapata evaluations, most of them expressed
comments like the following: "I was very ap
prehensive about living in Zapata and had petitioned
to change, (but) it is not at all what I expected and
I'm glad I had a chance to live here."
Moreover, the enthusiasm for Zapata is expressed
by an overwhelming positive feeling about the house.
When asked to rate the residence. 75 percent said it
was "a great place to live"; 17.8 percent said, "a good
place"; 4.8 percent said, "a satisfactory place"; 1.3
percent said, "not a good place"; and 1.2 percent
abstained.
When asked, "do you feel a sense of family in Casa
Zapata?" 90 percent said "yes," eight percent said
"no" and two percent abstained.
One resident's comment about the atmosphere in
Zapata typifies the majority's feelings: "Being a part
of Zapata is like being a part of a family — warm and
fun." After reading over 200 pages of evaluations I
saw so many positive comments that they still ring in
my ears.
Although my research was limited to Zapata, I
believe that the other two ethnic theme houses
(Okada and Ujamaa) are probably just as wonderful.
According to the most recent Residential Education
survey, ethnic theme houses were rated the highest
(Daily, April 1). I hope you would agree with me that
the stereotypes of ethnic theme houses are baseless
prejudices.
Ethnic theme houses both preserve a sense of
identity for ethnic groups and teach others about
their cultures. Moreover, they increase awareness of
minority issues, expose residents to different
lifestyles and encourage them to look at things from
different perspectives.
Ethnic theme houses do not deserve to be treated
as bottom-of-the-barrel residences. They are
treasures to be cherished by us all.

by an overwhelming positive feeling about the house.
When asked to rate the residence. 75 percent said it
was "a great place to live"; 17.8 percent said, "a good
place"; 4.8 percent said, "a satisfactory place"; 1.3
percent said, "not a good place"; and 1.2 percent
abstained.
When asked, "do you feel a sense of family in Casa
Zapata?" 90 percent said "yes," eight percent said
"no" and two percent abstained.
One resident's comment about the atmosphere in
Zapata typifies the majority's feelings: "Being a part
of Zapata is like being a part of a family — warm and
fun." After reading over 200 pages of evaluations I
saw so many positive comments that they still ring in
my ears.
Although my research was limited to Zapata, I
believe that the other two ethnic theme houses
(Okada and Ujamaa) are probably just as wonderful.
According to the most recent Residential Education
survey, ethnic theme houses were rated the highest
(Daily, April 1). I hope you would agree with me that
the stereotypes of ethnic theme houses are baseless
prejudices.
Ethnic theme houses both preserve a sense of
identity for ethnic groups and teach others about
their cultures. Moreover, they increase awareness of
minority issues, expose residents to different
lifestyles and encourage them to look at things from
different perspectives.
Ethnic theme houses do not deserve to be treated
as bottom-of-the-barrel residences. They are
treasures to be cherished by us all.
