# The 						future's fashion statement

Ah, the wild life of a grad student. The other
night I was whooping it up with some friends
over at Cardinal Sin. The joint was Jumping.
There must have been at least five other people
in the place. As we munched popcorn, drank
beer and listened to the hot sounds of the Bee
Gees, we moaned over the omnipresent dull
ness of life at Stanford.

"The bars are boring." we said. "The politics
are boring."
Suddenly, they rounded on me. "And you're
boring." they snarled. "All you ever write about
in that boring column is Canada."
"Do something nasty, something radical!"
my friend Chris commanded.
So I've found a new c-word. This week I'm
writing — not about Canada — but about . . .
about . . . condoms.
A few days later, you see. I saw those posters
for the sex clinic for gay and bisexual men. You
know, for the "Eroticizing Safe Sex"
workshops. You must have seen them. They
featured anatomically correct Plllsbury Dough
boys. leaping gleefully, "tuchus" first, on to
condoms shaped like erect rocket ships.
"Disgusting." sneered those same friends
who complained that Stanford was dull.
"Whatever happened to monogamy, celibacy,
abstinence?"
Fine virtues, those. But I don't think any

thing happened to them. I doubt that they
were universally observed 50 or 100 or 1,000
years ago.
Monogamy is my personal choice . . . but
you've already heard that I'm sort of boring.
Anyway, no 900-foot-tall Donald Kennedys
have invaded my bedroom lately to tempt me
down the primrose path of dalliance.
The truth is that not everyone in the world is
lucky enough to have a happy, healthy,
monogamous relationship. And it would be
tragic and supremely wasteful, if. while trying
to find one, you caught a fatal disease.
A major problem with the argument for
abstinence and against condoms is that it is
voiced by such absurd sources. 1 mean, who
can take the fire and brimstone admonitions
of the televangellsts seriously. post-Jim Bak
ker?
And then there was President Reagan's
speech two weeks ago in which he advocated
chastity. Odd advice, considering that Nancy
was knocked-up well In advance of the wed
ding. And considering that many prostate
problems arise from prolonged . . . um . . .
disuse. Reagan probably doesn't know that
much about sex in the 1980s anvway.
No. I think the people who want to combine
safe sex with fun sex have the right idea. But
they're going to have an uphill battle. It will be
difficult to persuade people to use precautions
that give a magical, mystical experience all the
allure of doing dishes while wearing Rubber
maid gloves.
The problem is with the condoms them
selves. As a child. I always heard condoms
compared to balloons. In my mind's eye. I
imagined them looking like party decorations
— pink and blue and yellow. I was terribly dis

appointed when I did see one. There it was. an
unappealing, off-white sausage casing. Dull,
dull. dull.
I mean, sex should be about fun and frolic,
joy and excitement. Today's condoms create an
antiseptic atmosphere. You almost expect the
staff of the Stanford Hospital to bustle in and
take your pulse. Some of the romance disap
pears in the clinical environment.
It does not have to be this way. I understand
that a Japanese manufacturer is now making
condoms in black and pink. Where is Ameri
can industry? Come on. America, don't let the
condom become the new silicon chip!
Retool and reopen American factories. Make
condoms in fuchsia, magenta and teal green.
Make them fluorescent. (What could be more
fun that a condom than glows in the dark?)
Make fortune-cookie models, with romantic,
funny or sexy messages emblazoned along the
sides.
The ads for condoms are all wrong. Either
they try to scare you into using them — on
pain of death — or they feature goofy-looking,
misty-eyed models, dressed in outfits right out
of the disco age.
AIDS is not going to go away. And. despite
the sincerest wishes of the moral minority,
"people that love" will keep on fornicating. So
let's make the condom the fashion statement
of the 19905. The ultimate in street-smart sass
and yuppie chic.
Personally. I plan to stick to monogamy. You
never can tell. Fidelity might become the
second big trend of the 19905. Right after
designer condoms.
