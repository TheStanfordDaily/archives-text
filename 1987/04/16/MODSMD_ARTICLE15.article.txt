Maintain the
fight against
the library
Kudos go to the Faculty Senate
for having the courage to carefully
examine and question the design,
function and site of the proposed
Reagan Library complex, and for
taking a stand that it felt was
appropriate — although un
popular — with the University
Administration.
Many people feel that it is too
late in the planning process for a
reconsideration of the library
plans. But the facts dictate other
wise. New information — as it
becomes available — must be
integrated into the planning
process.
The site for the Reagan complex
was chosen before an environ
mental review was performed and
before the special area plan for
the foothills was divulged. Ap
proval was given to the library
before the plans for the building
were submitted.
When the project was approved
a couple of years ago, the library
was an abstraction, the size and
scope of the complex were not
discussed in any detail and the
access road was not decided
upon.
The University declined to have
a Reagan policy center built on
campus, yet the currently pro
posed complex is larger than the
policy center that was rejected.
The recent deliberations in the
senate on April 2, and the analy
sis by Frank G. Burke, acting
archivist of the United States
(Campus Report, April 1), indi
cate that decreasing the exhibit
space or auditoria and scaling
down the size of the complex is
not likely to be acceptable to the
Reagan Library Foundation.
Thus, given the size and scope
of the complex, issues need to be
re-evaluated — such as University
control and appropriateness of
the location.
We must remember that, al
though the Administration has
decided that the Reagan complex
should be built in the foothills by
Junipero Serra Blvd., it is by no
means certain that the Santa

Clara County Planning Commis
sion will allow the complex to be
built on that site.
County permission to build
there has not yet been obtained,
the environmental review has not
been completed, permits have not
been issued and public hearings
have yet to be held. It is Impor
tant that we consider the issues
now and express our opinions to
the University Administration,
the Santa Clara County Board of
Supervisors and the Planning
Commission.
The faculty, by courageously
speaking out, have done just
that. Now it is time for the rest of
the Stanford community, staff
and students to become involved,
learn the facts and express their
opinions.
In project planning, the ability
to reassess a situation and be
flexible when new facts and new
perspectives arise is a quality that
distinguishes between excellent
policy-making and mediocre plan
ning. If another site for the
Reagan Library or a smaller com
plex is more appropriate, let us be
flexible and willing to change our
plans accordingly.

Requirement
is impossible
to satisfy
I am writing to express my
dissatisfaction with the distribu
tion requirements at this fine
University. I am a senior in need
of a non-western class as well as
distribution area three. There are
only four classes offered that
fulfill both of these requirements
this quarter. All of these classes
have limited enrollment, making
it virtually Impossible to take one
of these classes — unless your
name begins with an 'S\
As a junior I tried to take Zen
Buddhism but was told to wait
until the following year. Now I've
been informed that there is abso
lutely no room in the class and
there is nothing they can do.
You see, the University in its

infinite wisdom decided to limit
the size of the religious studies
classes to 75 (or fewer in some
cases) — leaving 45 seniors In
quite a predicament. Wise move?
You decide.
The University owes each stu- ;
dent classes to fulfill the various
requirements for a liberal educa
tion. It's the responsibility of the ;
University to deal with the struc
tural problem such as this, and
solve it before 45 students don't
graduate.
The only answer the Academic
Standing Office gives to desperate
seniors is to take two separate
classes or to petition to waive one
of the requirements. Two sepa
rate classes with a full schedule
could put one over the 20-unit
limit.
Well, one can always petition to
take more. But the petition
process Is a mind-numbing
nightmare of administrative bu
reaucracy. It's not fair to have to
wait around for weeks wondering
what will happen in June. Not to
mention that by the time the
University gets around to looking
at the petition, its too late to do
anything about the situation.
Also, I would like to mention
that Prof. Carl Bielefeldt and the
teaching assistant for Zen Bud
dhism, Tom Tweed, have been
very understanding and helpful.
But their hands are tied. It's the
University elites who are calling
all the shots, and we, the stu
dents, are suffering.
Lastly, I would like to say that
beyond the struggle to fulfill all
the requirements and deal with
the psychological strain and
trauma of spring quarter senior
year, the fact that I wanted to
take Zen Buddhism but can't is
not fair. We certainly wouldn't
want to enjoy a class and maybe
learn something while fulfilling
those übiquitous requirements.
I am forced to take classes that
I really have no desire to take.
Chinese Ceramics? I don't think
so. There is no need for this type
of situation to arise. I'd just like
to congratulate the University on
some great planning and also for
their concern for my impending
graduation.
