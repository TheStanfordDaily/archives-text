## Kenpo Karate Club offers more than a few kicks 
### BRYAN COOPERRIDER 
Amidst all the excitement and
glamor surrounding Stanford's
NCAA football, basketball and
swimming teams, the Kenpo
Karate Club often goes unnoticed.
Nevertheless, with the highest
membership of all club sports
here. Stanford kenpo boasts an
Interesting history and a lively
agenda.
The martial art of kenpo "Is one
of the most sophisticated move
ment arts In existence," according
to George Pegelow, head instruc
tor of the club."It affects the way
you move In all aspects and
sports."
Kenpo Instills In Its students a
self-awareness that "teaches you
about how your body works, both
physically and psychically," he
added. Pegelow has headed the
club since 1965, the year after It
was founded.
Boasting a membership today of
75 to 100 students per quarter.

the Kenpo Club Is the oldest mar
tial arts group on campus. When
the club was established In 1964,
It received coverage by Look maga
zine (comparable to today's Life
magazine) and by several local
television stations.
In the late '60s and '70s, mem
bership grew to 250 people a quar
ter. Because of the size, practice
was moved to Maples Pavilion,
where the students filled the
entire gym.
Interest in the Vietnam War, ac
cording to Pegelow. was one rea
son for the high enrollment, but
he is quick to point out that "the
highest aim of the art is to avoid
conflict and violence."
But "we were heavily into com
petition until the mid-'7os," he ex
plained.
After the mid-'7os, interest in
competition dwindled and belt
ranking (by color) became less im
portant. Student interest in the
philosophy behind kenpo began to
rise. This was encouraged by

Pegelow, who believes very
strongly in the philosophical as
well as physical aspects of the
sport.
Because of the appeal of teach
ing at Stanford, the quality of the
Instructors is very high. Pegelow
teaches the first quarter students
and he tries "to give them a taste
of what's in store."
Randolph John Is the second
quarter instructor, and he brings
with him significant experience In

both aikido and kenpo.
Kirk Schnoor teaches the ad
vanced students. He is the chief
Instructor at a local studio and is
recognized as one of the best in
structors in Northern California
in forms, techniques and freestyle
fighting.
"I like the laid-back attitude of
the club," said Jeff Gill, who has
been a member of the club for two
years. "The teachers are great.
They let the students choose their

own path of learning and progress
at their own rate," he added.
Schnoor acknowledged the open
teaching attitude In the club.
"Karate Is the art of becoming
your own teacher," he said.
The Stanford Kenpo Club Is also
host to many visiting lecturers.
Navy Vice Admiral James Bond
Stockdale, a prisoner of war In
Vietnam, spoke to the kenpo stu
dents on Feb. 9. when he was
awarded an honorary black belt In
the IKKA (International Kenpo
Karate Association) In recognition
of his courage, honor and his ef
forts to make people aware of the
power of the human spirit in ex
treme crises. He Is the fourth
recipient of such an award.
Terry Dobson also spoke to the
club about the real meaning of the
true power of any genuine martial
art to catalyze the resolution of
conflict. Dobson has studied
alkldo in Japan with master
Morihei Uyeshiba and is his most
adept Western student.

Other visiting lecturers Include
Deng Ming Dao. author of "The
Wandering Taoist." and Esquire
magazine Senior Editor George
Leonard, a black belt in alkido and
author of "The Silent Pulse."
The class also Includes discus
sion sections on Mondays after
practice for those that are inter
ested in the philosophy behind
karate. "I've had some of the most
profound experiences because of
the quality of the students.
Sometimes it's like the Breakfast
Club â€” a 'psychic hyperspace,' "
Pegelow explained.
Pegelow is currently working on
a book entitled "Art and Science of
Kenpo Karate" with Ed Parker, the
founder and president of the
IKKA. It Is a theoretical book that
discusses the principles of strate
gies and tactics in kenpo karate.
Pegelow concluded by em
phasizing that, because it is a true
martial art. kenpo "is a powerful
vehicle for understanding the
self."
