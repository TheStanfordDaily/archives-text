Scott's Seafood Grill and Bar
2300 E. Bayshore
Palo Alto
Sitting inside this restaurant, one expects to look
outside and see towering cliffs and crashing waves
rather than Highway 101 and rushing cars, but in
fact this seafood palace is nestled snugly between the
pandemonium of Embarcadero and the Bayshore
Freeway.
In spite of its incongruous but handy location, the
atmosphere at Scott's is nice, if a bit hurried. The
restaurant sports a traditional fish-and-ship decor.
Selecting from the list of salads and starters, my
guest and I chose the bay shrimp salad and clam
chowder.
The bay shrimp salad, in addition to the obvious,
included slices of fresh tomato and avocado covered
with a mild vinaigrette. The dressing was too oily,
but the salad was quite enjoyable nonetheless.
The clam chowder was crowned with a spot of
finely ground parsley. The dish was gently spiced
and served piping hot.
Scott's has a large list of daily specials in addition

to the house specialties. I picked the seafood saute
and my friend decided on the broiled salmon.
Seafood saute at Scott's is a blend of crab legs,
prawns and scallops sauteed in a wine, lemon and
butter sauce. It's the perfect blend for the seafood
lover who wants it all.
My guest's salmon was a more traditional meal,
light and tender and nicely complemented by lemon
butter and spices.
Each entree was served with slightly underdone
asparagus spears and tangy, delicious saffron rice.
Prices are in the mid-teens for most entrees, and
the restaurant is a perfect place to take the parents
for dinner.
For those interested in a true bargain, Scott's also
features a sunset dinner special from 4:30 to 6:30
p.m. Monday through Saturday.
