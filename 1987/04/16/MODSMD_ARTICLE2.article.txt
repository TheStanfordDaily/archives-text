# Student resigns from CIR
## 
### MARK LAWRENCE Senior staff writer 
Senior John van Loben Sels resigned
yesterday from the Committee on Invest
ment Responsibility (CIR) and encour
aged the ASSU Senate not to appoint
any new student members to the com
mittee for the 1987-88 school year.
Van Loben Sels. who was one of three
student members of the CIR, said the
Board of Trustees does not seriously
consider the ClR's recommendations on
investment decisions and only main
tains the committee to give the impres
sion that it values the advice of the stu
dents, faculty, staff and alumni who
comprise the CIR.
"This is a case where students are
being asked to be part of an extremely
cynical piece of trustee window-dressing
for a very serious issue," van Loben Sels,
also an ASSU senator, said in an an
nouncement of his decision.
Representatives of the Black Student
Union (BSU) and Stanford Out of South
Africa (SOSA) voiced their support of
van Loben Sels' resignation and his
ASSU proposal, which the senate will
consider at its meeting on Tuesday.
Van Loben Sels, a consistent sup
porter of total divestment, also an
nounced that the CIR had considered at
a meeting earlier in the day to meet with
SOSA to discuss ways of putting a total
divestment proposal before the trustees.
The CIR refused to adopt the proposal at
the meeting.
Although the other two student mem
bers of the CIR are sympathetic to his
frustrations, they are not close to resign
ing, van Loben Sels said.
CIR Chairman Frederick Hillier said
he is unsure whether the CIR will seek a
replacement for van Loben Sels or if the
University would appoint student mem
bers of the committee If the senate votes
not to appoint students for next year.
Hillier called van Loben Sels' resigna
tion an overreaction to his frustration
with the pace of Stanford's decision
making on divestment from companies
that do business in South Africa.
"I understand John's frustration with

respect to the difficulty of getting the
trustees to adopt our recommendations,
but ... I certainly feel this is
premature." Hillier said.
He said the trustees' decision last
week to follow the ClR's recommen
dations on three of four shareholder
resolutions concerning disinvestment
from South Africa show that the CIR has
some Influence with the trustees' Spe
cial Committee on Investment Responsi
bility (SCIR), which makes Stanford's
final investment decisions.
Hillier said he would be "terribly dis
appointed" if the senate votes not to ap
point any student members to the CIR
for next year. "Student input is really vi

tal to this process," Hilller said. "We are
indeed making fairly good progress, and
I don't think we would have gotten as far
as we have without students' input."
University President Donald Kennedy
said in an interview Tuesday that he
also thinks the senate proposal is an
overreaction.
"If you look at the track record over the
last several years, in fact the percentage
of times in which the SCIR did follow the
ClR's recommendations is rather high."
said Kennedy, an ex-officio member of
the SCIR. "I think the worst mistake you
can make is to overreact to a cluster of
events in time."
Two weeks ago, the SCIR
decided not to vote in two share

holder resolutions after the CIR
recommended that Stanford vote
to urge the companies to
withdraw from South Africa be
cause of their poor records in that
country.
But van Loben Sels said his
decisions had nothing to do with

the SCIR's recent actions. Rather,
he said he has seen during his two
quarters on the CIR that the SCIR
often disregards his committees
advice,
"I have tremendous respect for
the efforts of the CIR members."
van Loben Sels said. "But they
have simply been asked to do an
impossible iob."
He said the trustees' insistence
that the CIR evaluate each com
pany's performance in South
Africa individually, rather than by
applying a formula based on the
Sullivan Principles, slows down
the evaluation so much that the
entire process is ineffective.
"As currently constituted by the
trustees, the CIR is not a serious
attempt to institute a legitimate
selective divestment policy." van
Loben Sels said. "The Board may
not come around to our way of
thinking, but It's our intention
that students not be a part of
deluding the Stanford commu
nity.
"Students desperately want to
play a role in investment deci
sions, but not until the trustees
show they are serious about ex
ecuting their own policy," he said.
BSU and SOSA members said
they hope van Loben Sels' resigna
tion and the senate proposal will
draw attention to the what they
called the trustees' lack of action
on divestment.

He said the trustees' decision last
week to follow the ClR's recommen
dations on three of four shareholder
resolutions concerning disinvestment
from South Africa show that the CIR has
some Influence with the trustees' Spe
cial Committee on Investment Responsi
bility (SCIR), which makes Stanford's
final investment decisions.
Hillier said he would be "terribly dis
appointed" if the senate votes not to ap
point any student members to the CIR
for next year. "Student input is really vi

tal to this process," Hilller said. "We are
indeed making fairly good progress, and
I don't think we would have gotten as far
as we have without students' input."
University President Donald Kennedy
said in an interview Tuesday that he
also thinks the senate proposal is an
overreaction.
"If you look at the track record over the
last several years, in fact the percentage
of times in which the SCIR did follow the
ClR's recommendations is rather high."
said Kennedy, an ex-officio member of
the SCIR. "I think the worst mistake you
can make is to overreact to a cluster of
events in time."
Two weeks ago, the SCIR
decided not to vote in two share

holder resolutions after the CIR
recommended that Stanford vote
to urge the companies to
withdraw from South Africa be
cause of their poor records in that
country.
But van Loben Sels said his
decisions had nothing to do with

the SCIR's recent actions. Rather,
he said he has seen during his two
quarters on the CIR that the SCIR
often disregards his committees
advice,
"I have tremendous respect for
the efforts of the CIR members."
van Loben Sels said. "But they
have simply been asked to do an
impossible iob."
He said the trustees' insistence
that the CIR evaluate each com
pany's performance in South
Africa individually, rather than by
applying a formula based on the
Sullivan Principles, slows down
the evaluation so much that the
entire process is ineffective.
"As currently constituted by the
trustees, the CIR is not a serious
attempt to institute a legitimate
selective divestment policy." van
Loben Sels said. "The Board may
not come around to our way of
thinking, but It's our intention
that students not be a part of
deluding the Stanford commu
nity.
"Students desperately want to
play a role in investment deci
sions, but not until the trustees
show they are serious about ex
ecuting their own policy," he said.
BSU and SOSA members said
they hope van Loben Sels' resigna
tion and the senate proposal will
draw attention to the what they
called the trustees' lack of action
on divestment.
