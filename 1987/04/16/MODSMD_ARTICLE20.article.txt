Waverley Place
560 Waverley
Palo Alto
Waverley Place Is the place for the person who
wants everything — except something new. For an
establishment that purports to be Italian, this res
taurant only offers the most widely known Italian
dishes, like spaghetti carbonara and fettucini
alfredo. In addition, the rap music that was uncom
fortably present in our conversation was not in
keeping with the Italian format.
With an otherwise wonderfully pleasant atmos
phere — furnished oakwood beams, polished brass
railings, a plethora of plants — and impeccable ser
vice. this restaurant promises much.
Unfortunately, our appetizers did not live up to
those promises. From the extensive list, my guest
chose tortellini alia crema and I selected the carpac
cio.
The tortelli alia crema was served h: a cream sauce.
Even though peas and ham were included in the
dish, the scarcity of these ingredients made them go
virtually unnoticed.
The carpaccio was served with a spicy mustard
sauce that literally drowned the fine slices of beef.
The sauce was actually good, but the beef was com
pletely overwhelmed by the spicy taste. I would rec

ommend this dish if the mustard sauce was served
on the side, but as it stands, the excessive amount
applied on .the beef ruins the taste.
Fortunately, our entrees were somewhat better
than our first course. The menu, however, offers a
preponderance of items, making selection a difficult
matter.
In an effort to select the most unusual dishes on
the menu, my guest and I chose Petaluma medallions
of duck and stuffed breast of chicken, respectively.
The duck was good, and with the strong taste of
the green peppercorn sauce to offset the equally poig
nant meat, a pleasant experience in all.
My stuffed chicken breast, served in a port wine
sauce, was the highlight of the meal. The fowl was
stuffed with ricotta cheese, sun-dried tomatoes, and
prosclutto.
Dinner was accompanied by a delicious bottle of
Beaulieu Vineyard Chardonnay. Selections on the
wine list are expensive (they start at >18), but the
restaurant serves a large variety of wines by the
glass.
If a pleasant atmosphere, excellent service and
good, traditional dishes sounds like a nice evening
out, try Waverley Place. If you are looking for some
thing out of the ordinary, however, try some place
less pre-packaged.
