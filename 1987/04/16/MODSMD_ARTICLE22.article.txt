## Energetic 'West Side Story' opens tonight 
### JAMES R. DICKEY Editorial staff 
Tonight the curtains rise once again to the
familiar sounds of the "West Side Story" overture.
Performed, directed and produced entirely by stu
dents, the Ram's Head production clearly shows the
enthusiasm and weeks of hard work that have gone
into the play.
The work opens to a rousingly gymnastic chase be
tween the Sharks and the Jets, the rival gangs in the
play. Lieutenant Schrank (David Venderbush) and
Officer Krupke (Philip Eisner) — the overbearing rep
resentatives of law and order — bust in on the scene
with all the fury of an April shower.
Their appearance points up the only real
shortcoming of the production, namely the lack of
audience dislike for the characters who are supposed
to be the most detestable. Schrank Is harsh but too
understandable, Krupke is more like the "Bull" char
acter on "Night Court"and Bernardo (Steve Tannen)
doesn't seem slimy enough.
The likable nature of the cast as a whole, though,
is a real asset in the portrayals of Tony (Adam
Schwarz) and Maria (April Steuber).
As Tony, Schwarz is almost like Michael J. Fox in
his appeal. Except for a weak characterization of the

womb-to-tomb" friendship between Tony and Riff
(Michael Leonard). Schwarz's performance Is engag
ing and entertaining. His persona Is perfect for devel
oping a character who believes the world Is in his
hands when it is actually falling apart.
The Tony and Maria combination is electric, botn
performers are obviously absorbed by their roles.
April Steuber's soprano is both pleasant and pierc
ing. yet doesn't overpower Schwarz in the duets in
"Tonight, Tonight" or "There's a Place for Us."
Less obviously dramatic but still noteworthy In
their performances are Baby John (Eric Raneletti).
who is as beguillngly innocent and honest as possi
ble, and Doc (Stephen Toutonghl), who really shines
after the rape attempt on Anita (Monica Lytle).
The play features several excellent group numbers,
including the all-female rendition of "America,"the
pent-up emotion of "Cool" and the fantasy scene of
"There's a Place for Us."
From start to finish the performance is full of
excitement and energy, and is quite an excellent pro
duction.
"West Side Story" opens tonight at 8 p.m. in
Memorial Auditorium and runs through Saturday
evening. It also runs next week, Thursday through
Saturday, at 8 p.m.
