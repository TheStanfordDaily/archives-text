# Sitcom escapees in classic 'Arsenic and Old Lace'
## 
### ANDREW BERKOWITZ 
In an age when Broadway plays
are becoming lavish and flashy
epics, "Arsenic and Old Lace" is a
pleasant return to simplicity. A
simplicity, in fact, that has made
"Arsenic and Old Lace" one of the
two or three most frequently
produced plays of the last 40
years: it has been a mainstay of
high school and community
theatre. The production currently
in San Francisco, the first Broad
way revival since "Arsenic" ran for
1,444 performances in the 19405,
is simply the best version of the fa
mous mystery/comedy you may
ever see.
What really makes "Arsenic" fly
is its cast, half of them TV sitcom
escapees. Jean Stapleton, who for
eight years was the dingy Edith
Bunker on "All in the Family,"
plays the lovable but murderous
Abby Brewster, a sort of Edith
Bunker-cum-"Death Wish" char
acter. Marion Ross, the harried
Mrs. Cunningham on "Happy
Days," is Martha Brewster, Abby's
cyanide-toting sibling. The two
veteran actresses tackle the lead
roles with gusto, bouncing ener
getically around the stage, even
during the evening show after an
afternoon matinee. From the
opening curtain to the final bows,
there is no question that
Stapleton and Ross are the stars
of the show.
Gary Sandy, who was the frantic
station manager Andy Travis on
"WKRP in Cincinnati," is the fran
tic nephew Mortimer Brewster In
"Arsenic and Old Lace." The roles
are strangely similar; except for
the slicked hair and business suit,
Sandy could be running franti
cally around WKRP instead of the
crazy Brewster household.
Other familiar members of the
cast include Jonathan Frid, the
(no kidding) "vampire villain
turned-hero" Barnabas Collins on
the gothic soap opera "Dark
Shadows," and Larry Storch, a
fine actor with a long list of movie
and television roles to his credit.
Frid is Jonathan Brewster, the

long-lost Brewster nephew who
has had his face changed one time
too many, and Storch is Dr.
Einstein (no, not the Dr.
Einstein), whose drunken surgi
cal procedures have turned Jon
athan into a Boris Karloff look
alike.
All these fine actors mesh nicely
to make for an enjoyable play, but
there's a strange sense of deja-vu
during the evening. Stapleton has
the voice; the one that I kept ex
pecting to say: "Archie, I sold our
Gloria into slavery today." (Or
something like that.) The same
goes for Ross — "Richie, why don't
you invite the Fonz over for a game
of Trivial Pursuit?" — and Sandy
— "Hey Herb, is that your normal
sports jacket or is today Flag
Day?" 1 guess the more famous
you are, the better you have to act

to make people forget the charac
ters that m&de you famous.
In case you've never seen
"Arsenic and Old Lace," I'd rather
not give away the plot. The New
York Daily News calls it "A
Bonanza of Laughs," and while
I've never found "Bonanza" to be
particularly funny, suffice to say
that "Arsenic" has enough laughs
(maybe a "Gunsmoke" of laughs)
to satisfy even the grumpiest
theatre-goer (I should know; the
grumpiest theatre-goer was sit
ting in front of me). With two
crazy old ladies, 12 (or is it 13?)
bodies, a German plastic surgeon,
Boris Karloff, Teddy Roosevelt, a
horny minister's daughter and all
the elderberry wine you can drink,
it's gotta be good.
One warning about the theatre:
It's tall. It's very, very tall. Al

though the actors' voices carry
well throughout the theatre, from
the upper balcony It Is difficult to
see the subtle expressions on the
actors' faces. Heck, it's hard to see
the stage. If I had decided to throw
the grumpiest theatre-goer off of
the balcony during the first act,
she wouldn't have hit bottom until
the final curtain.
This is Broadway at its best,
and, thanks to this traveling
show, you can see it without
having to fly to New York. "Arsenic
and Old Lace" runs until May 2 at
the Curran Theatre in San Fran
cisco. The ornate set — the living
room of an old wooden mansion —
is terrific, the cast is star-studded
(not to reduce this to the level of
Hollywood Squares) and the play
is a true classic. You won't see a
better production.

These macabre sisters find cyanide a laughing matter in "Arsenic and
Old Lace." Or maybe actresses Jean Stapleton (standing) and Marion
Ross are just happy to be away from "All in the Family" and "Happy
Days."

There's a curious sense of deja vu in the Curran Theatre production of "Arsenic and Old Lace"; all the
lead roles are played by TV sitcom actors, which makes for interesting viewing. Pictured above: Jean
Stapleton, Marion Ross, Paul Rosson (seated) and Gary Sandy.
