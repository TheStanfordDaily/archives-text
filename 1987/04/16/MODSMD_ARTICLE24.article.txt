Louie Bellson Big Band
Dynamite!
Concord Jazz, CCD-4105
This disc features drummer Louie Bell
son and his big band In a very exciting
concert given at the Concord Jazz Festival
In August 1979. The live concert format is
without a doubt the best way to hear Bell
son's style of drumming. The band
features all sorts of experienced jazz tal
ent. including Don Menza and Dick Spen
cer on lead tenor and lead alto
respectively, and Alan Kaplan on
trombone. Featured extensively and
playing lead throughout is Bobby Shew,
who played at Stanford last March.

A great example of the
excitement that live jazz
can create.

Shews clean, high playing and elegant
solos are one of the many treats on this
disc. The disc also features a teenage Matt
Cattingub on alto sax. Cattlngub played
lead alto In Toshlko Aklyoshi's band In
Memorial Auditorium two weeks ago.
All of these great soloists aside. It Is
Louie Bellson's ferocious brand of drum
ming that drives this performance from
the opening "Sambandrea Swing" by Don
Menza to the final "Explosion" by Matt
Cattlngub. Bellson Is generous with the

spotlight, featuring John Chlodlnl on one
ballad and Bobby Shew on another, and
saving his open drum solo for the final
tune.
This Is a great example of the excite
ment that live jazz can create, and you
don't have to give up any sound quality. A
full 48 minutes of dynamite music.
Mel Torme'
Rob McConnell and the Boss Brass
Concord Jazz CCD-4306
Rob McConnell and Mel Torme have
come together to produce some excellent
big-band jazz In the traditional style. This
combination seems very appropriate,
since McConnell's band Is so trombone
oriented and Torme's voice has so many
trombone-like qualities. This Idea is
clearly understood on the first cut, "Just
Friends," where Torme sings a swinging
solo with the trombone section a cappella.

Torme's rich voice is showcased on all
the cuts, but particularly on the ballads.
"September Song" and "A House Is Not A
Home." He controls his sound completely,
using subtle vibrato and always coming
off sincere. At times Torme''s low range is
so Intense that you can feel it in your own
throat. The disc is very well produced, the
recording being completely digital (DDD).
so there is no noise to distract you.
The highlight of the disc is the Duke El
lington medley. Torme' sings Ellington's
music with a flair that stems from years of
familiarity. But some of the sections are
instrumental arrangements, like "It Don't
Mean A Thing. . which give you a
chance to hear McConnell's band as well.
The balance is terrific and the combina
tion even better. Also, you get 43 minutes
of great sound.

If you are already a big-band fan. do not
miss this disc. And if you are not a big
band fan yet, do not miss it either — it
will make you one. Quincy Jones has long
been respected as one of the great big
band leaders and this disc is a good exam
ple of why this is true. The band is hot —
hard-swinging, tight ensemble playing,
great soloists and Interesting arrange
ments. Thev start out with a mellow

guitar solo by Les Spann on "Lester Leaps
In"and before you know it the whole band
bursts in to back Spann up with some of
the cleanest and tightest ensemble
playing you will ever hear.
In addition to the great section work
there are some outstanding soloists: Phil
Woods (alto). Art Farmer (trumpet) and
Sahib Shihab (baritone), among others.
Jerome Richardson does some great flute
work on this disc, soloing as well as
leading the sax section. The recording is
very well produced, despite the fact that it
was originally analog, and you can hear
the flute even with the entire band behind
it.
Featured on the disc are a number of
standards, including "Caravan." "Air Mail
Special" and "They Say It's Wonderful."
Ernie Wilkin's arrangement of the Ray
Brown standard "Cherokee" is particu
larly well-performed. In all, a disc
definitely worth owning, despite its
brevity (36 minutes).
Bob Mintzer Big Band
Camouflage
Digital Music Products. CD-456
"Camouflage" is a great example of
what else a big band can do. Although the
band swings hard in the traditional big
band fashion, most of the disc is devoted
to Bob Mintzer's original brand of big
band jazz fusion. A lot of jazz fusion
sounds like a rock band accompanied by a
few horn "pops." but this is really a big
band with a rock influence. Bob Mintzer
deserves credit for combining the best
parts of traditional big band with a fusion
sound.

Playing these great arrangements are
some very hot New York musicians, in
cluding Peter Erskine. Don Grolnick,
Marvin Stamm and Randy Brecker. Bob
Mintzer's solos are also a highlight — fast,
clear and always musical.
The sound on this disc is perhaps the
best recording of a big band that we have
ever heard. Most studios record big bands
with 20 separate microphones and then
mix down to stereo for a very flat sound.
Before this was possible, bands would
record with one mike, changing the bal
ance by physically moving the musicians.
Tom Jung has recreated this technique in
stunning digital sound using one bi
directional ribbon microphone for the 13
horns and then mixing in the rhythm sec
tion. all direct to digital. The result is 65
minutes of big band fusion in DMP's
usual spectacular sound.

If you are already a big-band fan. do not
miss this disc. And if you are not a big
band fan yet, do not miss it either — it
will make you one. Quincy Jones has long
been respected as one of the great big
band leaders and this disc is a good exam
ple of why this is true. The band is hot —
hard-swinging, tight ensemble playing,
great soloists and Interesting arrange
ments. Thev start out with a mellow

guitar solo by Les Spann on "Lester Leaps
In"and before you know it the whole band
bursts in to back Spann up with some of
the cleanest and tightest ensemble
playing you will ever hear.
In addition to the great section work
there are some outstanding soloists: Phil
Woods (alto). Art Farmer (trumpet) and
Sahib Shihab (baritone), among others.
Jerome Richardson does some great flute
work on this disc, soloing as well as
leading the sax section. The recording is
very well produced, despite the fact that it
was originally analog, and you can hear
the flute even with the entire band behind
it.
Featured on the disc are a number of
standards, including "Caravan." "Air Mail
Special" and "They Say It's Wonderful."
Ernie Wilkin's arrangement of the Ray
Brown standard "Cherokee" is particu
larly well-performed. In all, a disc
definitely worth owning, despite its
brevity (36 minutes).
Bob Mintzer Big Band
Camouflage
Digital Music Products. CD-456
"Camouflage" is a great example of
what else a big band can do. Although the
band swings hard in the traditional big
band fashion, most of the disc is devoted
to Bob Mintzer's original brand of big
band jazz fusion. A lot of jazz fusion
sounds like a rock band accompanied by a
few horn "pops." but this is really a big
band with a rock influence. Bob Mintzer
deserves credit for combining the best
parts of traditional big band with a fusion
sound.

Playing these great arrangements are
some very hot New York musicians, in
cluding Peter Erskine. Don Grolnick,
Marvin Stamm and Randy Brecker. Bob
Mintzer's solos are also a highlight — fast,
clear and always musical.
The sound on this disc is perhaps the
best recording of a big band that we have
ever heard. Most studios record big bands
with 20 separate microphones and then
mix down to stereo for a very flat sound.
Before this was possible, bands would
record with one mike, changing the bal
ance by physically moving the musicians.
Tom Jung has recreated this technique in
stunning digital sound using one bi
directional ribbon microphone for the 13
horns and then mixing in the rhythm sec
tion. all direct to digital. The result is 65
minutes of big band fusion in DMP's
usual spectacular sound.


Louie Bellson Big Band
Dynamite!
Concord Jazz, CCD-4105
This disc features drummer Louie Bell
son and his big band In a very exciting
concert given at the Concord Jazz Festival
In August 1979. The live concert format is
without a doubt the best way to hear Bell
son's style of drumming. The band
features all sorts of experienced jazz tal
ent. including Don Menza and Dick Spen
cer on lead tenor and lead alto
respectively, and Alan Kaplan on
trombone. Featured extensively and
playing lead throughout is Bobby Shew,
who played at Stanford last March.

A great example of the
excitement that live jazz
can create.

Shews clean, high playing and elegant
solos are one of the many treats on this
disc. The disc also features a teenage Matt
Cattingub on alto sax. Cattlngub played
lead alto In Toshlko Aklyoshi's band In
Memorial Auditorium two weeks ago.
All of these great soloists aside. It Is
Louie Bellson's ferocious brand of drum
ming that drives this performance from
the opening "Sambandrea Swing" by Don
Menza to the final "Explosion" by Matt
Cattlngub. Bellson Is generous with the

spotlight, featuring John Chlodlnl on one
ballad and Bobby Shew on another, and
saving his open drum solo for the final
tune.
This Is a great example of the excite
ment that live jazz can create, and you
don't have to give up any sound quality. A
full 48 minutes of dynamite music.
Mel Torme'
Rob McConnell and the Boss Brass
Concord Jazz CCD-4306
Rob McConnell and Mel Torme have
come together to produce some excellent
big-band jazz In the traditional style. This
combination seems very appropriate,
since McConnell's band Is so trombone
oriented and Torme's voice has so many
trombone-like qualities. This Idea is
clearly understood on the first cut, "Just
Friends," where Torme sings a swinging
solo with the trombone section a cappella.

Torme's rich voice is showcased on all
the cuts, but particularly on the ballads.
"September Song" and "A House Is Not A
Home." He controls his sound completely,
using subtle vibrato and always coming
off sincere. At times Torme''s low range is
so Intense that you can feel it in your own
throat. The disc is very well produced, the
recording being completely digital (DDD).
so there is no noise to distract you.
The highlight of the disc is the Duke El
lington medley. Torme' sings Ellington's
music with a flair that stems from years of
familiarity. But some of the sections are
instrumental arrangements, like "It Don't
Mean A Thing. . which give you a
chance to hear McConnell's band as well.
The balance is terrific and the combina
tion even better. Also, you get 43 minutes
of great sound.
