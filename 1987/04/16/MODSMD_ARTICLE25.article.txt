Fran Schumer
Most Likely To Succeed
New York: Random House, 1986
Whatever happened to the class
of. . .? Ever since the '70s ended.
It's been fashionable to define that
decade in terms of its students. I
thought that Fran Schumer's
"Most Likely To Succeed" would
most likely do nothng more than
that; approaching the book. I
feared that a discussion of "six
women from Harvard and what
became of them" that is billed as
being "in the tradition of Mary
McCarthy's The Group' and Alice
Adam's 'Superior Women' " would
be unlikely to offer any new in
sights about either Schumer's
generation or student life in the
'70s.
I was right. And wrong.
Schumer's case study of six
women from Harvard's first
coeducational class is successful
not as a portrait of Jane Q. Public.
'70 style, but rather as a
documentation of the problems
women face when they must rec
oncile the pressure placed on
them by their peers and mentors
to "succeed" with their own goals
— or lack of them.
The book is written in two sec
tions; the first is a year-by-year
description of the undergraduate
experiences of Schumer and her
five classmates. She begins by de
scribing herself as a freshman. In
a fairly straighforward narrative
she discusses the ups and downs
of her freshman year; she comes
to Harvard from a sheltered,
middle-class background, but be
cause her father is an exter
minator she allows a "working
class" aura to settle around her.
Her politically correct background
and writing skills make her fairly

popular; in discussing her friends
and lovers she makes it clear that
these relationships were more im
portant to her than academics.
The women she chooses as
friends are very much like herself
— Intellectual, witty, terribly good
at what they do and. more often
than not, terribly unsure of them
selves. Most of them are used to
measuring success by figues —
their SAT scores, their grades,
their weight on the scale. When
stress and the pressure of adjust
ment make these figures fluc
tuate. they panic.
Five women gradually emerge in
Schumer's narrative: Daisy.
Paige, Eleanor, Tess and Felicity.
Eleanor, a calm and self-possessed
medical student, is adopted by
Fran as a roommate midway
through freshman year. Daisy,
who didn't want to come to Har
vard in the first place, becomes
one of the paper's most successful
photographers. Paige, a perfec
tionist. spent most of her time at
Harvard frustrated because she
couldn't seem to use the talents
she believed she possessed.
Felicity, a star tennis player, is the
most fragile in the group; Tess, a
"pre-med jock,", the most stable.
In the second part of the book,
each of these women — including
Schumer — is given a separate
chapter. After a decade, Schumer
meets with all of her old friends
and asks them to recount their
lives. For the most part, the
friends have not kept in touch, so
the tone of the book changes at
this point. With the exception of
Schumer's description of her own
life, the writing becomes more dis
tant and abbreviated.
In these final six chapters.

successes of herself and her

friends. For anyone who has iden
tified with one or several of the
characters earlier in the book —
and most women who attend or
have attended college will — this
proves either a coming to terms
with one's own life after college or
an eerie look into the future. I
found myself, a recent graduate,
pouring over the pages in which
Schumer describes her friends'
lives immediately after gradua
tion.
What I liked best about "Most
Likely To Succeed" was that al
though Schumer discusses the
lives of herself and her friends
with some intimacy, she doesn't
go overboard. She spends a great
deal of time discussing eating dis
orders, nervous breakdowns, bro
ken love affairs and other stuff of
melodrama, but her language is
entirely unmelodramatic. We're
convinced that the women she is
discussing are entirely real; for
some of us, they may seem eerily
familiar.
