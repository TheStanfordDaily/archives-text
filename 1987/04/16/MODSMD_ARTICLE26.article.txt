# Primo Levi remembered

Primo Levi was found April 7 in his home in
Turin, Italy. It is possible he committed suicide;
an autopsy is planned.

Consider that this has been: I commend these
words to you.
— Primo Levi, "Sheena"
It is not often that we encounter a writer whose
words strike us wholly, from the first sentence we
read. Primo Levi was such a writer. His subjects
were perhaps the most difficult any human being
could survive to write about: Levi lived through
the Holocaust and World War 11.
From his own pain and fear, Levi wove language
of clear beauty, of gentle wit and attentive descrip
tion — language that helped to transmute the hor
rifying and confounding reality of the Holocaust
into something communicable and meaningful to
his readers.
As one of those readers, the first striking sen
tences of Levi that I read concern Argon and the
other inert (noble) gases. In his memoir "The
Periodic Table." Levi uses his experiences as a
chemist to tell stories from his life before and after
Auschwitz.
Such a device might seem doomed to failure,
chemistry being for most of us a world of drudgery
and memorization. For Levi, however, the world of
the elements provided a metaphorical language
that he used to comprehend the upheavals of his
life. The very stuff of life — the elements — became
through his touch the stuff of literature, word and
metaphor.
Despite my fascination with his writing, I have
avoided the four Levi volumes about Auschwitz.

For me. a certain silence surrounds the word
"Auschwitz"; the despair, fear and absence of
meaning we associate with merely the word
threaten the mind — even the lucid, powerful
mind of Primo Levi — with that silence, that pos
sibility of complete forgetting. Perhaps I've always
questioned whether even Levi's forthright and
human storytelling could bear the load of the
speaking of the silence that is Auschwitz.

From his own pain and
fear, Levi wove language of
clear beauty.

I find it easier to approach Levi's other powerful
books about World War 11. One book. "If Not Now.
When?" a tale of Jewish partisans in Russia and
Poland set late in the war. has all the trappings of
a great adventure story. The partisans, whose
tales Levi based on real accounts of surviving par
tisans, struggle with the Germans, the Poles, the
Russians and even nature — a struggle for sur
vival and for meaningful purpose in a situation
that calls all meaning into question. As the book
ends, however, it begins; or rather, shows Levi's
usual sharp focus. "The war is not over." as he
wrote in"The Reawakening," and never will be.
For Levi, the war in the mind of a survivor never
ends; the question of survival must be confronted
again and again. One continually asks why one Is
alive. Writing is a way to reiterate that question.
As Levi said in 1984, "After Auschwitz, I had an
absolute need to write." Out of that need came one
of the clearest voices in 20th century literature, a
voice silenced last week.
