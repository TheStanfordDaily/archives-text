## Last stand for last year's champion Wildcats 
### TOM SENF Senior staff writer 
In the Pacific 10 Southern Division It's a
short drop from the penthouse to the out
house. and nobody has found that out more
quickly than the 1987 Arizona Wildcats..
Arizona was on top of the collegiate
baseball world last season, rolling through
postseason play with an 8-1 record en route
to Its third NCAA championship.
Now, less than 11 months later, the
Wildcats are mired In fifth place In the Slx-
Pac with a 6-12 mark, just one game ahead
of last-place Calfornla. In order to match
last season's 18-12 record. Arizona will
have to win Its final 12 conference games.
Arizona will need a miraculous finish If It
Is to catch both Arizona State (9-9) and USC
(8-10) for third place In the Slx-Pac and still
have a shot at an at-large NCAA berth. Stan
ford will try to ensure that the Wildcats do
not get an opportunity to repeat last year's
postseason heroics In a three-game series
that begins tonight at 7 p.m. at Sancet
Field in Tucson.
"It's very much an uphill battle, but It can
be done," Arizona Coach Jerry Kindall said.
"That's our goal. We won't give up."
Although Arizona is currently In the
midst of a five-game conference losing
streak, Stanford Coach Mark Marquess is
wary that the Wildcats may finally bust
loose.
"They just can't afford to lose anymore,"
Marquess said. "If they're going to keep
their season going, they have to start with
us. They're going to be pumped up and play
hard. It's their last stand."

It Is possible that Arizona's last stand will
be as successful as Custer's. Stanford, cur
rently ranked No. 3 In the nation by
ESPN/Collegiate Baseball, leads the Slx-Pac
with a 12-4 record and Is fresh off two wins
over second-place UCLA (12-6).
The Cardinal, however, was coming off a
doubleheader sweep of the Bruins last year
when it went down to USC and dropped
three straight games.
"We're in the driver's seat (In the confer
ence race), but the only problem with that is
that we can't relax." centerflelder Tol Cook
said. "That happened to us last year. We've
got to keep the pressure on them (UCLA).
We have to figure they're going to outhit
everybody and take two out of three, so we
have to do that or better."
Despite what happened last season, Kln
dall would rather not have to begin a stretch
drive against the Cardinal. "I would prefer
to be playing Stafford Junior High," he
said.
One of Kindall's main problems this year
is that many of his players are not as far out
of junior high as he would like. The
Wildcats lost three-fourths of their infield
(including All Slx-Pac first baseman Todd
Trafton), two-thirds of their outfield
(including all-conference left fielder Mike
Serine), their designated hitter, a starting
pitcher and their top reliever.
Arizona now has four freshmen — Greg
Fowble, Glenn Baxley, J.T. Snow and Alan
Zinter — in its starting lineup, and its top
reliever, David Blake, Is also in his first
year.

After an important last weekend in which the Cardinal took two games from UCLA and moved itself into sole possession of
first place in the Pacific 10 Southern Conference, Toi Cook and his teammates will be concentrating on avoiding a mental
let-down in this weekend's series with fifth-place Arizona State.
The freshmen are talented —
none of the regulars Is hitting un
der .299 and Blake has a team
high four saves — but they are still
freshmen. Fowble has committed
27 errors at shortstop, and the
Wildcats have blown numerous
games in the late innings, includ
ing two in the ninth during a
three-game sweep at the hands of
Cal last weekend.
"That (the Cal losses) we can at
tribute to mistakes by
youngsters." Kindall said. "But
that's not a cop-out. We have to
play better."
One man tailor-made to rattle a
shaky defense and a pitching staff
that is. according to Kindall. "in a
shambles." is Stanford left fielder
Ruben Amaro. Amaro can hit

(.348), get on base (.453 on-base
percentage), run (24 steals) and
score (48 runs). He leads the Card
inal in all of the above categories.
"I think one of the keys is
having good years from your
seniors." Marquess said. "He's
been one of our most consistent
players. He's just done everything
we've asked of him."
Kindall will send junior right
hander Frank Halcovich (3-5. 6.35
ERA) to the mound tonight
against Stanford's Jack McDowell
(5-2. 5.25) because Wildcat ace
Gilbert Heredia was forced into
two innings of relief duty on Sun
day against Cal. Heredia (8-5,
3.59) will pitch Friday against Lee
Plemel (5-4. 3.32).
Saturday's game will match
Arizona's Gary Alexander (2-2.
5.04) and either Jim Price (3-0.
4.79) or Rob Wassenaar (3-1,
2.55) for Stanford. The one that
does not start Saturday will prob

ably be on the mound in Monday's
makeup against Cal at Sunken
Diamond, unless he is needed in
relief on Saturday.
"If we have an opportunity to
win the game on Saturday and
have to use both Price and Was
senaar, we'll do it." Marquess
said.
Card notes
Arizona is hitting .317 to Stanford's
.289, but the Cardinal has a decided
advantage in both pitching (team ERA
of 3.98 to the Wildcats' 4.94) and
defense (.963 percentage to Arizona's
.949).
Stanford is currently .005 shy of the
school record for fielding percentage
set by the 1968 squad, which included
a first baseman named Mark
Marquess,
All three games of the series can be
heard on KZSU Radio (90.1 FM) with
the golden throats of David Fisher and
Susan Slusser providing the commen
tary. Game time tomorrow is at 7 p.m.

we've asked of him."
Kindall will send junior right
hander Frank Halcovich (3-5. 6.35
ERA) to the mound tonight
against Stanford's Jack McDowell
(5-2. 5.25) because Wildcat ace
Gilbert Heredia was forced into
two innings of relief duty on Sun
day against Cal. Heredia (8-5,
3.59) will pitch Friday against Lee
Plemel (5-4. 3.32).
Saturday's game will match
Arizona's Gary Alexander (2-2.
5.04) and either Jim Price (3-0.
4.79) or Rob Wassenaar (3-1,
2.55) for Stanford. The one that
does not start Saturday will prob

ably be on the mound in Monday's
makeup against Cal at Sunken
Diamond, unless he is needed in
relief on Saturday.
"If we have an opportunity to
win the game on Saturday and
have to use both Price and Was
senaar, we'll do it." Marquess
said.

Last year it was hats off to the NCAA champion Wildcats. This weekend, however, Stanford won't give
Arizona State much respect A couple of Card wins could knock the defending champs out of the playoffs.
In the Pacific 10 Southern Division It's a
short drop from the penthouse to the out
house. and nobody has found that out more
quickly than the 1987 Arizona Wildcats..
Arizona was on top of the collegiate
baseball world last season, rolling through
postseason play with an 8-1 record en route
to Its third NCAA championship.
Now, less than 11 months later, the
Wildcats are mired In fifth place In the Slx-
Pac with a 6-12 mark, just one game ahead
of last-place Calfornla. In order to match
last season's 18-12 record. Arizona will
have to win Its final 12 conference games.
Arizona will need a miraculous finish If It
Is to catch both Arizona State (9-9) and USC
(8-10) for third place In the Slx-Pac and still
have a shot at an at-large NCAA berth. Stan
ford will try to ensure that the Wildcats do
not get an opportunity to repeat last year's
postseason heroics In a three-game series
that begins tonight at 7 p.m. at Sancet
Field in Tucson.
"It's very much an uphill battle, but It can
be done," Arizona Coach Jerry Kindall said.
"That's our goal. We won't give up."
Although Arizona is currently In the
midst of a five-game conference losing
streak, Stanford Coach Mark Marquess is
wary that the Wildcats may finally bust
loose.
"They just can't afford to lose anymore,"
Marquess said. "If they're going to keep
their season going, they have to start with
us. They're going to be pumped up and play
hard. It's their last stand."

It Is possible that Arizona's last stand will
be as successful as Custer's. Stanford, cur
rently ranked No. 3 In the nation by
ESPN/Collegiate Baseball, leads the Slx-Pac
with a 12-4 record and Is fresh off two wins
over second-place UCLA (12-6).
The Cardinal, however, was coming off a
doubleheader sweep of the Bruins last year
when it went down to USC and dropped
three straight games.
"We're in the driver's seat (In the confer
ence race), but the only problem with that is
that we can't relax." centerflelder Tol Cook
said. "That happened to us last year. We've
got to keep the pressure on them (UCLA).
We have to figure they're going to outhit
everybody and take two out of three, so we
have to do that or better."
Despite what happened last season, Kln
dall would rather not have to begin a stretch
drive against the Cardinal. "I would prefer
to be playing Stafford Junior High," he
said.
One of Kindall's main problems this year
is that many of his players are not as far out
of junior high as he would like. The
Wildcats lost three-fourths of their infield
(including All Slx-Pac first baseman Todd
Trafton), two-thirds of their outfield
(including all-conference left fielder Mike
Serine), their designated hitter, a starting
pitcher and their top reliever.
Arizona now has four freshmen — Greg
Fowble, Glenn Baxley, J.T. Snow and Alan
Zinter — in its starting lineup, and its top
reliever, David Blake, Is also in his first
year.

After an important last weekend in which the Cardinal took two games from UCLA and moved itself into sole possession of
first place in the Pacific 10 Southern Conference, Toi Cook and his teammates will be concentrating on avoiding a mental
let-down in this weekend's series with fifth-place Arizona State.
The freshmen are talented —
none of the regulars Is hitting un
der .299 and Blake has a team
high four saves — but they are still
freshmen. Fowble has committed
27 errors at shortstop, and the
Wildcats have blown numerous
games in the late innings, includ
ing two in the ninth during a
three-game sweep at the hands of
Cal last weekend.
"That (the Cal losses) we can at
tribute to mistakes by
youngsters." Kindall said. "But
that's not a cop-out. We have to
play better."
One man tailor-made to rattle a
shaky defense and a pitching staff
that is. according to Kindall. "in a
shambles." is Stanford left fielder
Ruben Amaro. Amaro can hit

(.348), get on base (.453 on-base
percentage), run (24 steals) and
score (48 runs). He leads the Card
inal in all of the above categories.
"I think one of the keys is
having good years from your
seniors." Marquess said. "He's
been one of our most consistent
players. He's just done everything
we've asked of him."
