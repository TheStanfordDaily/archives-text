# Freshman finishes eighth in Western
## 
### ROBERT PORTNOY Staff writer 
Stanford freshman Mark
Funseth posted a final-round
76 in the Western Intercol
legiate yesterday for a 220, total
which earned him a tie for
eighth place with three other
golfers.
"Because of the tough field in
the tournament, this is by far
the best individual perfor
mance (by a Stanford golfer) of
the season," Stanford Coach
Tfm Srftaaf said.
Unfortunately, that's all the
good news to report from the
Pasatiempo Golf Course in
Santa Cruz.
The Stanford men's golf
team, after an impressive
showing In its own Stanford
U.S. Intercollegiate and a
mediocre performance In the
Fresno Pepsi Classic, needed a
shot in the arm heading into
two of the top tournaments of
the season, the Sun Devil Inter
collegiate at the end of the
month and the Pac-10 tourna
ment the first week In May.
What it got, In the words of
Schaaf, was "something of a
setback, with the exception of
Funseth's play." That tran
slates into a 17th place finish
at 1,167, a full 168 strokes be
hind tournament winner
Fresno State.
The play of Funseth.
however, is starting to draw
everyone's attention.
"He's establishing himself as
one of the top freshmen on the
West Coast, maybe In the
country. He would agree with
me that he has not yet played
up to his potential. He could

become a really first-class,
dominating player in the col
legiate ranks for us over the
next few years," Schaaf said.
Fresno State defeated
Arizona for the team title in
possibly the most exciting
finish of the season. Kevin
Sutherland of Fresno State
came to the par-3 18th hole
needing a par to give the Bull
dogs the team title. A bogey
would leave them tied with the
Wildcats, and they would lose
the tournament on the basis of
a tiebreaking procedure.
At the same time, Sutherland
trailed Richard Greenwood of
UCLA by one stroke for the in
dividual crown. A birdie would
give him a share of the title.
The 18th at Pasatiempo has a
very slick green, making it one
of the most difficult to putt on
the course.
Sutherland hit an adequate
tee shot, leaving him some 25
feet for birdie. If he played It
conservatively and two-putted.
Fresno would win and he'd
lose. If he charged the birdie at
tempt and ran it by the hole, he
could have the most nerve
racking four or five-footer of his
life coming back. Sutherland
played it safe, but still left him
self three endless feet for the
team title. He sunk the putt,
giving Fresno the champion
ship.
UCLA finished third in the
team race at 1.112, two strokes
behind Arizona. BYU wound up
fourth at 1,115, with San Jose
State at 1,117 and Cal, the
first-round leader, at 1,119.
Santa Barbara carded 1,121,
USC 1,126. and Washington
1.132.
