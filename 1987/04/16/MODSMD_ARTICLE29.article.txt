## 
### ROBERT PORTNOY Staff writer 
The sun was not all that sizzled
yesterday during the final round
of the Lady Sun Devil in Paradise
Valley, Ariz.
With temperatures approaching
100 degrees, the Stanford wo
men's golf team scorched the de
manding Anasazi Golf Course,
firing a tournament-low 296 over
the final 18 holes to vault Into fifth
place and all but lock up a berth in
the NCAA tournament held May
27-30.
The Cardinal's remarkable final
round, two shots better than the
previous low in the tournament,
moved it from a tie for eighth with
UCLA to fifth place at 918, just
three strokes behind Arizona and
six behind U.S. International Uni
versity. Oklahoma State won the
team title with a 900 total, fol
lowed by Arizona State at 903.
"If we had played the last hole of
the tournament better, we would
have passed Arizona and caught
USIU," Stanford Coach Tim
Baldwin said.
Cardinal senior Kathleen
McCarthy, returning to the lineup
after being kept out of the Califor
nia Intercollegiate by flu. demon
strated why she's certain to be a
first-team All-America for the
second time in her Stanford
career.
McCarthy carded a one-under
71 on the par 72. 6.200-yard
Anasazi layout. Her final round
brought her from 13th place to
seventh at 222, just four strokes
behind the winner, Robin Hood of
Oklahoma State. Hood captured
her third consecutive Intercol
legiate title. She had won at Texas
and Southern Methodist coming

Into the Lady Sun Devil.
"Kathleen played great all three
days, and if she hadn't had a cold
putter, if she'd putted like Kath
leen McCarthy usually does, she
would've won the tournament.
She's striking the ball tremen
dously. It's something to see. No
one in the college game plays like
she does," Baldwin said.
McCarthy lipped out a four-foot
birdie putt on the 17th hole and
had a two-foot par putt on the
18th "jackknife out," Baldwin
said.
The rest of the Cardinal pro
vrded ample support for their top
player. Sophomore Clare Dolan
fired a final round 73, the second
best round shot by Stanford all
tournament, to finish at 235.
Senior Adrienne Gilmartin posted
her second 77 of the event,
sandwiching an 80 in the second
round, for the same total of 235.
Trish McGonigle struggled to an
opening-round 89, but recovered
in fine fashion to post a 76 Tues
day and close with a 75 yesterday.
Junior Kay Cornelius is only one
who went in the opposite direc
tion, closing with an 82, but her
79 and 77 in the first two rounds
both counted and were crucial in
keeping the Cardinal within strik
ing distance of the leaders.
"The field was really strong.
Florida. USC, New Mexico and
SJSU were all ranked ahead of us
and we beat them good. This last
round will pretty much solidify us
in the low 14 going to the NCAA
tournament and will secure our
No. 9 ranking. We're starting to
play well at just the right time,
with Pac-lOs coming up in a week
and a half and the NCAAs after
that," Baldwin said.

Jennifer Wyatt of Lamar
finished second in the tourna
ment with a 219 total. She tied
Laurette Maritz of USIU, the top
collegiate golfer in the country.
Karen Davies stood alone in third
place at 220, only a stroke ahead
of two players tied at 221. Melissa
McNamara of Tulsa and Pam
Wright of national power ASU.
In the team competition, Stan-

ford passed Florida, New Mexico
and USC, and also left UCLA be
hind in its march to the fifth-place
finish.
"It was a fantastic comeback.
Clare and Trish are starting to Jell,
and so is Adrienne. McCarthy's
already there. It's a real
confidence-builder going into the
Pac-10 and NCAA tournaments,"
Baldwin said.
