# Trustee committee acts on CIR advice
## 
### MARCUS MABRY Senior staff writer 
The University Board of Trustees Spe
cial Committee on Investment Responsi
bility (SCIR) yesterday approved three of
four recommendations made by the
Committee on Investment Responsibil
ity (CIR) involving portfolio companies
doing business in South Africa.
The approved CIR recommendations,
made last week, called on Stanford to
vote "yes" on the shareholder resolution
calling for Ingersoll-Rand to withdraw
from South Africa, vote "no" on a share
holder resolution calling for Pfizer Inc.
to withdraw from South Africa and vote
in favor of the resolution recommending
that the Timken Company sign and fully
implement the Sullivan Principles.
The SCIR rejected a CIR recommenda
tion calling for Stanford to vote "yes" on
a shareholder resolution calling for Tim
ken to withdraw from South Africa. The
SCIR advised abstention from the share
holder resolution.
In its recommendations, the CIR cited

poor performance with respect to the
Sullivan Principles as the reason for op
posing continued South African opera
tion by Ingersoll-Rand and Timken.
Ingersoll-Rand is one of only three of
the corporations in the Stanford
portfolio with dealings in South Africa
which carries a Sullivan rating of three,
the worst rating possible. Timken is one
of only three companies in the portfolio
that have refused to sign the Sullivan
Principles. William Timken, chairman of
the board of the Timken Company, is a
member of the University Board of Trus
tees.
The SCIR is a committee appointed by
the trustees to advise the full board on
decisions regarding University divest
ments and disinvestments.
The CIR advises the SCIR on share
holder resolutions regarding withdrawal
from South Africa.
These latest SCIR recommendations
to the trustees mark the second round of
a series of committee deliberations con-
cerning the 60 corporations in the
University portfolio with opera
tions in South Africa.
The SCIR does not always ap
prove CIR recommendations. Ear
lier this year, the SCIR did not ac
cept two CIR recommendations
calling for disinvestment votes
with the Goodyear and NCR corpo
rations, "two of the worst compan
ies in the portfolio," according to
one CIR member.
CIR Chairman Frederick Hillier,
a professor of operations research,
said that the SCIR approves "the
substantial majority of recom

mendations" made by the CIR.
noting that the two committees
generally follow the same criteria
for evaluating a company's role in
South Africa.
"They follow the criteria laid
down for CIR. but they have more
discretion. They laid down the
guidelines and are [more free] to
deviate from them, [though they
seldom do)," Hillier said.
University President Donald
Kennedy, an ex-officio member of
the SCIR, stated that SCIR ap
proval varies from case to case.
"You have to examine SCIR
rationale in each case. Sometimes
[it does not approve CIR recom
mendations because] it doesn't
agree with CIR rationale or feels
that the CIR recommendation is

not supported by the facts," Ken
nedy said. "It is not uncommon
for it (the SCIR) to disagree. But,
you'll find that in the majority of
cases it agrees more than it dis
agrees."
The Sullivan Principles are a set
of criteria established by Rev.
Leon H. Sullivan in 1977 under
which companies adhering to
them promote social justice in
South Africa by opposing apart
heid and by placing blacks,
colored and Asians in managerial
and supervisory positions.
Each company that operates in
South Africa is given a Sullivan
rating of one, two or three, signify
ing good, adequate or poor prog
ress.
