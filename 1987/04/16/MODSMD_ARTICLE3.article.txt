### MARCUS MABRY Senior staff writer 
The University Board of Trustees Spe
cial Committee on Investment Responsi
bility (SCIR) yesterday approved three of
four recommendations made by the
Committee on Investment Responsibil
ity (CIR) involving portfolio companies
doing business in South Africa.
The approved CIR recommendations,
made last week, called on Stanford to
vote "yes" on the shareholder resolution
calling for Ingersoll-Rand to withdraw
from South Africa, vote "no" on a share
holder resolution calling for Pfizer Inc.
to withdraw from South Africa and vote
in favor of the resolution recommending
that the Timken Company sign and fully
implement the Sullivan Principles.
The SCIR rejected a CIR recommenda
tion calling for Stanford to vote "yes" on
a shareholder resolution calling for Tim
ken to withdraw from South Africa. The
SCIR advised abstention from the share
holder resolution.
In its recommendations, the CIR cited

poor performance with respect to the
Sullivan Principles as the reason for op
posing continued South African opera
tion by Ingersoll-Rand and Timken.
Ingersoll-Rand is one of only three of
the corporations in the Stanford
portfolio with dealings in South Africa
which carries a Sullivan rating of three,
the worst rating possible. Timken is one
of only three companies in the portfolio
that have refused to sign the Sullivan
Principles. William Timken, chairman of
the board of the Timken Company, is a
member of the University Board of Trus
tees.
The SCIR is a committee appointed by
the trustees to advise the full board on
decisions regarding University divest
ments and disinvestments.
The CIR advises the SCIR on share
holder resolutions regarding withdrawal
from South Africa.
These latest SCIR recommendations
to the trustees mark the second round of
a series of committee deliberations con-
