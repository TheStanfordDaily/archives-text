# Stanford doesn't discriminate, admissions asst. director says

### CLAY CALVERT Staff writer 
Despite a Jewish population considerably lower
than that at some Ivy League schools, Stanford does
not discriminate against Jewish applicants, accord
ing to Jon Reider, assistant director of undergradu
ate admissions.
"1 have no evidence at all . . . that there is any dis
crimination against Jews at Stanford" Reider said,
stressing that the University has no quotas based on
religion for its student population. In addition, the
Stanford application does not include a space for
students to indicate religious preference, he said.
Reider made his remarks in a speech last night at
Branner Hall.
According to figures in the national Hillel direc
tory, the Jewish student population at Stanford is
about 10 percent, Reider said. That figure is less
than the 50 percent reported for Columbia. 35 per
cent at the University of Pennsylvania, 30 percent for
Yale and 21 percent for Harvard.
Reider gave several explanations for the lower
Stanford figure, including the fact that Stanford's
applicants come primarily from the West Coast,
where there is a smaller Jewish population.
"It's true we get a lot of applications from the East
Coast — a lot of Jewish applicants from the East
Coast — but invariably in terms of the overall pool, it
does average out to be a whole lot," he said.
Reider noted that while New York has 32 percent of
the nation's Jewish population, only five percent of
Stanford's applicants are from New York. In compari
son, California has 13 percent of nation's Jewish

population, yet more than 40 percent of the under
graduate application pool is comprised of Califor
nians.
Reider also noted that 75 to 80 percent of all college
students tend to go to institutions within 500 miles
of home, a fact that keeps many eligible applicants
from the East Coast away from Stanford.
"This is particularly true of the East because there
are a tremendous number of high-quality institu
tions on the East Coast." Reider said.
Another reason for the comparatively smaller num
ber of Jews at Stanford is that some Jewish families
from the East don't want their children to go to col
lege on the West Coast. Reider said.
"A lot of Jewish families. I think, are somewhat re
luctant to see their kids come this far west. There is a
sense of. 'You go west and you will never come
back,' " he said.
The University also might be the victim of an
image problem among Jewish students applying to
college. Reider said.
"I think there is a lingering image. I think it lingers
long after the facts would prove differently, that
Stanford is a waspy' " university, he said.
Reider said he tries to talk to Jewish applicants
who call the admissions office and might be con
cerned about such an image of the University.
Reider said the "mildly indifferent" image of
Jewish life at Stanford is changing, noting that the
University is more visible now.
"It's much more common now for Eastern. Jewish
kids to want to come here. I think that [Stanford is)
seen as a place where the Jewish community is quite
lively," he said.
