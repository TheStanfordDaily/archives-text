# Library critics voice discontent over plan

Opponents of the proposed
Reagan Presidential Library spoke
out again last night at a poorly at
tended meeting intended to
generate student protest against
the highly controversial proposal.
The meeting, held in the Meyer Li
brary forum room, was sponsored
by the Stanford Workshop on Poli
tical and Social Issues (SWOPSI).
"Clearly, the entire process of
bringing the library to Stanford
has been flawed from the begin
ning," said English Prof. Ronald
Rebholz, who criticized the
decision-making process behind
the library's location at Stanford.
Rebholz said the idea to build
the library at Stanford originated
— Improperly — with Hoover In
stitution Director W. Glenn
Campbell, without input from the
University faculty or administra
tion.
Faculty input concerning the
proposal was further ignored, ac
cording to Rebholz. when Univer
sity President Donald Kennedy of
ficially accepted the library on be
half of Stanford before the Faculty
Senate had an opportunity to dis
cuss the matter.

"He (Kennedy) disregarded the
Rosse Committee's recommenda
tion that the senate be consulted
before a decision (about the li
brary) was made." Rebholz said.
The Rosse Committee, which
was appointed by Kennedy in
1983 and charged with assessing
faculty and staff opinion about the
proposed library's academic
merits, recommended that no
final decisions be made concern
ing the library prior to consulta
tion with the Faculty Senate.
Anthony Siegman, professor of
electrical engineering and a
staunch library opponent, agreed
with Rebholz's criticism. "This li
brary totally arises from the
Hoover Institution," Siegman
said.
"Glenn Campbell is the villain,
and I think villain is the proper
word to use," he added.
Siegman said that if the library
is built as planned in the foothills
behind Junipero Serra Boulevard
overlooking Lagunita, the already
strained relationship between the
University and the Hoover Institu
tion will deteriorate even further.
"This library is going to poison the
relationship." he said.
In addition to these concerns.
Siegman said that the proposed 11-

brary — with 10,500 square feet of
exhibit space and parking for 250
cars — would be more of a tourist
attraction than an academic
resource and is therefore inappro
priate for the Junipero Serra site.
"It just isn't an appropriate spot
for a tourist attraction." he said.
Siegman predicted that

250.000 to 500,000 tourists
would visit the library,each year
and cited figures that claimed that
of the 1,700,000 people who
visited the eight existing presi
dential libraries in 1980, only two
thousand were scholars.
Rebholz and Siegman, both li
brary opponents, gave the only
formal presentations at the
meeting. According to the
meeting's organizer, SWOPSI Stu
dent Director Lewie Ford, no li
brary supporters were invited to
speak.
Charles Palm, head archivist at
the Hoover Institution and
campus liaison for the Reagan
Presidential Foundation, declined
to comment on the meeting or
make a general statement when
reached by telephone last night.
Rebholz expressed disappoint
ment at students' low awareness
of the controversy. "Students
seem barely concerned" about the
Reagan Library, he said, adding
that they are a "vital constituency"
that should be heard in the cur
rent debate.
Students who attended the
meeting, however, were unani
