# Senior slates ballot causes confusion
## ASSU election results not yet available

The results of this week's ASSU election will
not be known until Saturday morning "at the
earliest." said Sharon Merrow. associate elec
tions commissioner.
If no COP slate garners 50 percent or more of
the total vote, a run-off election will be held
next week.
The senior class president election was de
signed to avoid a run-off. but the resulting bal
lot confused many voters. Some juniors voting
Tuesday and yesterday who marked their bal
lots incorrectly complained to the ASSU that
they were not properly informed of the correct
procedure, said Elections Commissioner Brett
Jarvis.

Instructions on the ballot directed voters to
rank the slates from one to four in order of
preference. However, many voters, failing to
read the instructions and assuming the usual
voting procedure, indicated only one choice on
their ballot.
"We told people (at the polling booths) to
remind voters (of the unusual procedure)."
Merrow said. But complaining students,
worried that their ballots would be invalidated
because of their mistakes, said the poll
watchers did not point out the instructions on
the ballot.
Merrow said those ballots would not be dis
qualified. but would be counted as though the
marked slate was ranked number one and the
rest were not ranked at all.
The senior class presidents are elected under

the "preferential voting system" as defined by
"Robert's Rules of Order" and contained in the
ASSU constitution.
Under this system, the first-rank votes are
tallied first. Secondary rankings are only
tallied if the initial count does not produce a
majority.
"It's kind of a complicated process" but is
useful because it eliminates the need for a run
off in the event there is no majority. Merrow
said.
Jarvis said he had no control over selecting
the voting procedures.
"I have no regrets at all. We just did what was
in the (ASSU) bylaws." Jarvis said.
As to the number of voters in this year's elec
tion. Jarvis had no specific number, but said
voter turnout "looks pretty decent."
