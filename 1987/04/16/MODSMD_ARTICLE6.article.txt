latest addition to their facility,
an atom smasher that is ex
pected to provide key informa
tion about the beginning of the

The recently completed. â€¢ 115

sity scientists ahead of their
competition in the interna
tional race for a grand unifica
tion theory, or as they call it.
"the theory of everything."
Burton Richter, director of
SLAC. described the new col
lider and other accelerators as
"funny kinds of time machines.
They recreate the conditions
that existed when the universe
was very young."
