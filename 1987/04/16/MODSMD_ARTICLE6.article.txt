# SLAC unveils linear collider

Physicists at the Stanford
Linear Accelerator Center
(SLAC) yesterday unveiled the
latest addition to their facility,
an atom smasher that is ex
pected to provide key informa
tion about the beginning of the
universe.
The recently completed. â€¢ 115
million Stanford Linear Col
lider (SLC) should put Univer

sity scientists ahead of their
competition in the interna
tional race for a grand unifica
tion theory, or as they call it.
"the theory of everything."
Burton Richter, director of
SLAC. described the new col
lider and other accelerators as
"funny kinds of time machines.
They recreate the conditions
that existed when the universe
was very young."

Philip Bambade, a physicist at SLAC and the new Stanford
Linear Collider, points to the spot where particles will collide in
the new loop. The collision point, which will normally be cov
ered by shielding, was left visible for a press tour yesterday.
"Our ultimate goals are to un
derstand what the basic building
blocks of nature are, and how they
Interact and form the world as we
see it," said Richter. who shared a
1976 Nobel Prize in physics.
A grand unification theory
would explain how the four funda
mental forces of nature work to
gether. Scientists identify the
forces as the gravitational, electro
magnetic. "strong" and "weak."
The new collider is an upgrad
ing and extension of the 19-year
old linear accelerator that can be
seen stretching beneath Highway
280 off of Sand Hill Road. A mile
long loop. 50 feet underground,
has been added to one end of the
accelerator, creating a new col
lider shaped like an enormous
tennis racket frame.
In the original linear ac
celerator. experimenters sent elec
trons speeding through the two
mile tunnel where they smashed
Into a stationary target. Scientists
will now be able to shoot two

beams down the accelerator on a
collision course.
Electrons will crash In the new
loop section with their antimatter
equivalents, called positrons. The
collision of these particles will
destroy them and create new
forms, including the Z, or "zee
zero." particle.
Scientists are trying to learn
about the Z particle because it is a
carrier of the weak force.
At the collision point the beams
will be only one-tenth the width of
a human hair with enough energy
to power 30 homes. SLAC's inno
vative design will produce beams
more focused and more powerful
than ever before.
The new collider is now in its
"tuneup phase," Richter said, but
it has already set a record by
producing the most powerful
beam of electrons ever generated
in a particle accelerator.
The beam had an energy of 53
billion electron volts, which. Rich
ter said, is equivalent to the en
ergy in a stack of flashlight bat
teries one million miles high.
Experiments with the collider

are scheduled to begin this sum
mer.
SLAC's competition in the high
energy physics race is the
European Organization for Nu
clear Research, known by its
French acronym, CERN. A 17-mile
circular accelerator is being built
by CERN near Geneva. Switzer
land.
When it incompleted in 1989, it
will be the largest accelerator in
the world.
