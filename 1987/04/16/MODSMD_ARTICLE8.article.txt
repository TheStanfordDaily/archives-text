Investigation of Marines 6 a mess 9
WASHINGTON — The government investigation of espionage
charges against U.S. Marine security guards is "a mess" because
of interagency conflicts and problems with the initial interroga
tion of a primary suspect, a knowledgeable administration official
said yesterday.
Another Informed official said the issue of providing immunity
from prosecution to some guards in return for their testimony is
being hotly debated within the administration.
The allegations came as the Marine Corps began its first judicial
hearings In the expanding security scandal, which has led to the
arrest of three Marines on espionage charges and one for allega
tions of improper fraternization. In addition, at least 40 Marine
guards have been recalled from their posts throughout the world
in connection with the Investigation.
The administration official who said the investigation is "a
mess" also said the probe is being hampered by the "institutional
resistance" of conflicting government agencies trying to protect
their own interests. Agencies with a role in the investigation in
clude the State Department, Defense Department, Navy Inves
tigative Service. Marine Corps and Central Intelligence Agency. In
addition, the chief of the Justice Department's internal security
section has been providing informal advice to the military inves
tigators. according to officials.
North free-lanced arms deal
WASHINGTON — In the early morning hours of May 28, 1986,
while other members of a White House delegation were asleep in
the Tehran Hilton, Lt. Col. Oliver North. Jr. unilaterally struck an
arms-for-hostages deal and summoned a planeload of U.S. weap
ons from Israel as part of the bargain, informed sources said yes
terday.
North secretly ordered the waiting airplane filled with missile
spare parts to fly to Iran after he had reached a private agreement
with Iranian middleman Manucher Ghorbanlfar that two Ameri
can hostages would be released when the shipment arrived, ac
cording to the sources.
However, when North later awakened his boss on the mission,
former national security adviser Robert McFarlane, and informed
him of the private agreement, an irritated McFarlane rejected the
deal and insisted that all four American hostages be released. Just
as the aircraft was reaching its final checkpoint before turning
toward Iran, McFarlane used his secret communications system
to order the plane back to Tel Aviv, the sources said.
McFarlane had clandestinely arrived in Tehran three days ear
lier as part of a White House effort to swap U.S. weaponry for
American hostages held by Iranian-backed extremists in Lebanon
and open a dialogue with the regime. North's pre-dawn free
lancing ar>d McFarlane's subsequent veto were cited Wednesday
by one top investigator into the Iran-contra affair as further
evidence of the "terribly amateurish and unprofessional way" in
which President Reagan's high-risk initiative was handled.
Official charged with fraud
WASHINGTON — C. McClain Haddow. former chief of staff to
the secretary of Health and Human Services, was indicted yester
day on charges of fraudulently obtaining more than *30,000 from
a charitable foundation and additional kickbacks from contracts
to write speeches for former Secretary Margaret Heckler.
In a seven-count indictment. Haddow was charged with secretly
routing >33,540 in payments from the non-profit T. Bear Founda
tion. which he helped create while at HHS, to a Senate credit un
ion account that Haddow controlled with his wife, Alice.
As an HHS official, the indictment said, Haddow urged
numerous health-care corporations to contribute to the founda
tion, which was created to promote hand-washing by children. He
then pocketed 90 percent of the foundation's monthly payments
to Michelle Magoon, a Haddow associate who was hired as a
fundraiser at his behest, according to the indictment.
The indictment, returned by a federal grand jury here, followed
an investigation by the Justice Department's public integrity sec
tion that was triggered by a report in The Washington Post last
June. The Post reported that Alice Haddow had secretly received
more than *30.000 in T. Bear Foundation payments without the
knowledge of foundation officials, and that the money was routed
through Magoon, a secretary at a local consulting firm who did no
work for the money.
Haddow, who left HHS early last year and now runs a Washing
ton consulting firm, was charged with mail fraud, false state
ments and conflict of interest. He is a former Utah state represen
tative who managed the 1976 campaign of Sen. Orrin Hatch. R-
Utah. and later headed Hatch's Utah staff.
If convicted. Haddow faces up to 12 years in prison and
*271.000 in fines.
Shultz lunches with writers
MOSCOW — Taking time out from the problems of arms con
trol. Secretary of State George Shultz met with a group of Soviet
writers and artists yesterday for a lively talk about "glasnost" and
"perestroika."
He stopped for a Holy Week service in a Russian Orthodox
Church and visited the grave of poet-novelist Boris Pasternak.
Shultz. a former university professor, clearly enjoyed the intel
lectual discussion of glasnost (openness) and perestroika
(reorganization), which are championed by Soviet leader Mikhail
Gorbachev.
Chingiz Altmatov, a prize-winning novelist from Kirghiz, whose
father disappeared in Stalin's purges of the 19305, was among the
guests. Also present were Andrei Dementev, a poet and editor of
the literary magazine Yunost, playwright Mikhail Roschin,
painter-sculptor Zurab Teseretelli and writer Anatoly Rybakov.
"Those people were terribly articulate, and Shultz Is a wonderful
listener," an American who was present said.
All of them, a guest said later, endorsed Gorbachev's effort to
open up the traditionally secretive society. And they agreed with
the new leader that it will be impossible to reverse the process
once it has taken root.
"Shultz was enjoying lt enormously," the guest added. "After all,
he taught at three universities (Stanford. Massachusetts Institute
of Technology and Chicago), and he was back at a round table
with other Intellectuals."
Hinckley will not leave hospital
WASHINGTON — St. Elizabeths Hospital withdrew its request
yesterday to allow presidential assailant John Hinckley Jr. a one
day. unescorted Easter visit with his parents, but a hospital offi
cial said later that doctors still believe Hinckley is ready for ex
panded privileges.
Decisions about Hinckley's privileges and restrictions are based
on "clinical" assessments, and they are unchanged, Thomas said.
The withdrawal of the March 23 request was discussed during a
hearing at which a federal prosecutor raised questions about the
hospital's handling of the case, in light of disclosures that
Hinckley had corresponded with serial killer Theodore Bundy.
U.S. Attorney Joseph diGenova questioned Wednesday whether
St. Elizabeths improperly withheld information about Hinckley's
activities from prosecutors.

yesterday to allow presidential assailant John Hinckley Jr. a one
day. unescorted Easter visit with his parents, but a hospital offi

Investigation of Marines 6 a mess 9
WASHINGTON — The government investigation of espionage
charges against U.S. Marine security guards is "a mess" because
of interagency conflicts and problems with the initial interroga
tion of a primary suspect, a knowledgeable administration official
said yesterday.
Another Informed official said the issue of providing immunity
from prosecution to some guards in return for their testimony is
being hotly debated within the administration.
The allegations came as the Marine Corps began its first judicial
hearings In the expanding security scandal, which has led to the
arrest of three Marines on espionage charges and one for allega
tions of improper fraternization. In addition, at least 40 Marine
guards have been recalled from their posts throughout the world
in connection with the Investigation.
The administration official who said the investigation is "a
mess" also said the probe is being hampered by the "institutional
resistance" of conflicting government agencies trying to protect
their own interests. Agencies with a role in the investigation in
clude the State Department, Defense Department, Navy Inves
tigative Service. Marine Corps and Central Intelligence Agency. In
addition, the chief of the Justice Department's internal security
section has been providing informal advice to the military inves
tigators. according to officials.
North free-lanced arms deal
WASHINGTON — In the early morning hours of May 28, 1986,
while other members of a White House delegation were asleep in
the Tehran Hilton, Lt. Col. Oliver North. Jr. unilaterally struck an
arms-for-hostages deal and summoned a planeload of U.S. weap
ons from Israel as part of the bargain, informed sources said yes
terday.
North secretly ordered the waiting airplane filled with missile
spare parts to fly to Iran after he had reached a private agreement
with Iranian middleman Manucher Ghorbanlfar that two Ameri
can hostages would be released when the shipment arrived, ac
cording to the sources.
However, when North later awakened his boss on the mission,
former national security adviser Robert McFarlane, and informed
him of the private agreement, an irritated McFarlane rejected the
deal and insisted that all four American hostages be released. Just
as the aircraft was reaching its final checkpoint before turning
toward Iran, McFarlane used his secret communications system
to order the plane back to Tel Aviv, the sources said.
McFarlane had clandestinely arrived in Tehran three days ear
lier as part of a White House effort to swap U.S. weaponry for
American hostages held by Iranian-backed extremists in Lebanon
and open a dialogue with the regime. North's pre-dawn free
lancing ar>d McFarlane's subsequent veto were cited Wednesday
by one top investigator into the Iran-contra affair as further
evidence of the "terribly amateurish and unprofessional way" in
which President Reagan's high-risk initiative was handled.
Official charged with fraud
WASHINGTON — C. McClain Haddow. former chief of staff to
the secretary of Health and Human Services, was indicted yester
day on charges of fraudulently obtaining more than *30,000 from
a charitable foundation and additional kickbacks from contracts
to write speeches for former Secretary Margaret Heckler.
In a seven-count indictment. Haddow was charged with secretly
routing >33,540 in payments from the non-profit T. Bear Founda
tion. which he helped create while at HHS, to a Senate credit un
ion account that Haddow controlled with his wife, Alice.
As an HHS official, the indictment said, Haddow urged
numerous health-care corporations to contribute to the founda
tion, which was created to promote hand-washing by children. He
then pocketed 90 percent of the foundation's monthly payments
to Michelle Magoon, a Haddow associate who was hired as a
fundraiser at his behest, according to the indictment.
The indictment, returned by a federal grand jury here, followed
an investigation by the Justice Department's public integrity sec
tion that was triggered by a report in The Washington Post last
June. The Post reported that Alice Haddow had secretly received
more than *30.000 in T. Bear Foundation payments without the
knowledge of foundation officials, and that the money was routed
through Magoon, a secretary at a local consulting firm who did no
work for the money.
Haddow, who left HHS early last year and now runs a Washing
ton consulting firm, was charged with mail fraud, false state
ments and conflict of interest. He is a former Utah state represen
tative who managed the 1976 campaign of Sen. Orrin Hatch. R-
Utah. and later headed Hatch's Utah staff.
If convicted. Haddow faces up to 12 years in prison and
