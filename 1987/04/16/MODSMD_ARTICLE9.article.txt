# Shultz optimistic about arms talks

MOSCOW — Secretary of State
George Shultz said yesterday that
"quite a lot of progress" was made
toward a treaty that would elimi
nate medium-range missiles In
Europe during three days of talks
with Soviet leaders and that he
can see the prospect "close at
hand" for reaching an agreement.
Shultz's assessment, one of the
most optimistic that has been
heard from a senior U.S. ne
gotiator, was based on a new offer
presented to him Tuesday by So
viet leader Mikhail Gorbachev and
Improved somewhat yesterday by
Foreign Minister Eduard
Shevardnadze.
The new offer essentially
combines elimination of the
medium-, or Intermediate-range,
nuclear-armed missiles of both
sides that can hit targets between
600 and 3,000 miles away, with
elimination of shorter-range

missiles of 350- to 600-mlle range,
a category In which the Soviets
have a monopoly.
Shultz told Gorbachev — as he
told a press conference shortly
before leaving Moscow — that he
could not respond immediately to
the offer because of the necessity
to consult U.S. allies in Europe.
Late yesterday, Shultz flew to
Brussels to begin the process of
discussion within the North At
lantic Treaty Organization, which
is likely to take several weeks.
Shevardnadze, in a brief ex
change with the reporters, said it
is "quite realistic" to expect Gor
bachev to come to a summit
meeting in the United States with
President Reagan later this year to
sign a pact on Europe-based
missiles. It would be the first
U.S./Soviet nuclear arms treaty of
the Reagan administration.
Agreement on such a treaty has

been considered for many months
to be the key to the next full-scale
Reagan-Gorbachev summit. The
Soviets have also said that
Shultz's willingness to bargain on
such a treaty during his trip here
would be crucial to the prospects
for arms control negotiations in
the remaining months of the
Reagan administration.
Through the official news
agency Tass and state television,
the Soviets gave generally upbeat
assessments of Shultz's talks.
Tass atcused the U.S. delegation
of falling to give a "constructive
response" to Soviet proposals, but
It said that overall the discussions
had been "timely and useful."
Talks would continue at future
ministerial meetings, as well as at
Geneva, it said.
Gorbachev, meeting yesterday
with U.S. House Speaker Jim
Wright, D-Texas, and other mem

bers of a congressional delegation,
said the United States and the So
viet Union "are close to reaching
an agreement on the problem of
medium-range missiles in linkage
with shorter-range missiles." Tass
said.
Late yesterday, Soviet television
showed a 32-minute interview
with Shultz by a Soviet commen
tator, in which Shultz defended
the U.S. arms control position and
gave a blunt assessment of the So
viet "invasion" of Afghanistan and
what he called its aggressive
espionage tactics. The unedited
interview was the first ever shown
on Soviet television with a U.S.
secretary of state, according to
diplomats here.
As it turned out, the potential
for bargaining during Shultz's
mission to Moscow was cut short
by Gorbachev's proposal.
