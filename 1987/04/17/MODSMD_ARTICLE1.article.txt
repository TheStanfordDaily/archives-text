# Assembly bill takes hard line on 'date rape'
## 
### JOHN POLLACK Senior staff writer 
Acquaintance rape on California college campuses
is the target of new legislation recently introduced in
the California legislature by State Assemblyman Tom
Hayden, D-West Los Angeles.
If passed, the bill would require most colleges and
universities in the state, including Stanford, to spe
cifically define rape as a crime in their campus codes
of conduct. These institutions would be given
greater authority to investigate and prosecute possi
ble acquaintance rapes.
The proposed legislation attempts to address the
reluctance of acquaintance rape victims to file formal
charges and would supplement rather than replace
existing legislation.
Hayden said Wednesday that the legislation is
needed to protect the rights of rape victims. "Often
the victim doesn't have the same voice as the
accused," Hayden said, noting that universities have
" been no different than the rest of society. . . . [They
have) not been committed to or aggressive about this
issue."
Sally Cole, University judicial affairs officer, said
she is skeptical about the legislation, at least as it
would apply to Stanford. While Cole acknowledged
that there is "no specific mention" of acquaintance
rape in the University's Fundamental Standard, she
said a "laundry list" of unacceptable behavior is un
necessary because the standard is "a global state
ment that students shouldn't violate the rights of
others."
The bill would also require colleges and univer
sities to institute mandatory rape prevention
workshops for all students. "We must start with an
assumption of relative ignorance and tell them what
can happen," Hayden said.
"You have to assume that the educational back
ground that they (the students) have does not em
phasize the historical violence against women."
But Cole said mandatory workshops are unneces
sary at Stanford because rape education is "already a
high priority."
"We achieve the same goals in our own way," she
added.
Eileen McManus, a spokesperson for the Stanford
Women's Center, agreed with Cole. "I definitely think
there is a need for education
about these issues," she said, add
ing that the Women's Center
already has programs to educate
students about acquaintance
rape.
McManus acknowledged, how
ever , that other schools might
need encouragement in this direc
tion. She cited a particular ac

quaintance rape case at UC-
Berkeley — the Clark Kerr Inci
dent — which Is widely acknowl
edged to have been poorly handled
by university administrators.
Judy Corbett, an administrative
aide to Hayden, told The Daily
Californian last month that this
incident, in which a woman was
allegedly raped by four football
players, was one factor that
motivated Hayden to introduce
the new legislation.
If passed, the legislation would
be binding on all colleges and uni

versities In California except,
ironically, the University of Cali
fornia. Corbett said the University
of California system is immune
from this type of legislation under
the California Constitution. The
state can only advise the UC sys
tem on this matter, she said.
The bill will be reviewed by the
Assembly Subcommittee on
Higher Education April 28, and
should be approved by the Educa
tion Committee by May 8, Corbett
said. Beyond this point, she said,
the bill's future is uncertain.
