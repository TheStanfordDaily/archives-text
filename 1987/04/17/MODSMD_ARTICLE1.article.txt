Acquaintance rape on California college campuses
is the target of new legislation recently introduced in
the California legislature by State Assemblyman Tom
Hayden, D-West Los Angeles.
If passed, the bill would require most colleges and
universities in the state, including Stanford, to spe
cifically define rape as a crime in their campus codes
of conduct. These institutions would be given
greater authority to investigate and prosecute possi

The proposed legislation attempts to address the
reluctance of acquaintance rape victims to file formal
charges and would supplement rather than replace
existing legislation.
Hayden said Wednesday that the legislation is
needed to protect the rights of rape victims. "Often
the victim doesn't have the same voice as the
accused," Hayden said, noting that universities have
" been no different than the rest of society. . . . [They

issue."
Sally Cole, University judicial affairs officer, said
she is skeptical about the legislation, at least as it
would apply to Stanford. While Cole acknowledged
that there is "no specific mention" of acquaintance
rape in the University's Fundamental Standard, she
said a "laundry list" of unacceptable behavior is un
necessary because the standard is "a global state
ment that students shouldn't violate the rights of
others."
The bill would also require colleges and univer

workshops for all students. "We must start with an
assumption of relative ignorance and tell them what
can happen," Hayden said.

ground that they (the students) have does not em
phasize the historical violence against women."
But Cole said mandatory workshops are unneces

high priority."
"We achieve the same goals in our own way," she
added.
Eileen McManus, a spokesperson for the Stanford
Women's Center, agreed with Cole. "I definitely think
