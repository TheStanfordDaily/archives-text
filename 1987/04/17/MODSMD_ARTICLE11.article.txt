## 
### HARU CONNOLLY 
With a just over 14 months to go before the
California presidential primary, both Demo
cratic and Republican campus groups are
gearing up for the 1988 presidential cam
paign.
"We will have a meeting Monday night to talk
about candidates and an informational table
set up every Thursday," said sophomore Sub
odh Chandra, president of the Stanford Demo
crats. "We hope to be an umbrella organization
for Democratic candidate committees and try
to unify for the purpose of electing a Demo
cratic candidate to the presidency."
The campus College Republicans have
begun to plan fall activities, including debates
and a membership table in White Plaza, said
junior Tanya Ferencko, the organization's out
going president.
"This year we hope to have more interaction
with State College Republicans," Ferencko
said, "We also plan to examine educational is

sues and to support candidates by having
them come to speak, getting out the vote and
getting publicity for them."
"We've just begun, and so have the candi
dates," said sophomore Ken Rivera, president
of the Stanford College Republicans. "Our
drive will start in the fall.
Student groups supporting particular candi
dates are also getting ready for next year.
"For the rest of 1987, we are mostly setting
up coordination so that we can direct people in
1988," said junior Mark Lemley, campaign co
ordinator for Gary Hart, the former Demo
cratic senator from Colorodo who declared
Monday.
"In 1984, we had enthusiasm and energy,
but no structure," Lemley said. "This year we
want to keep the energy we had in 1984 and
get the best structure possible."
According to senior Mike Bunzel, who is af
filiated with the campaign of Sen. Joseph
Biden, D-Del., "There is a low-level following
(for Biden) already. Ten students already want

to go to lowa to work for him."
Lemley said the local Hart campaign held a
party Monday night to celebrate his formal
declaration of candidacy. According to Lemley.
45 Hart supporters from the 12th Congres
sional District watched Hart's videotaped an
nouncement.
"We will be setting up fund-raiser events and
having monthly meetings to inform students
of the status and issues of (Hart's) campaign,"
Lemley said. "The Hart campaign will be
independent at different levels." he said.
"Northern and Southern California will oper
ate as different entities, but we will be receiv
ing policy statements from the national or
ganization."
Bunzel said, "Biden hasn't announced yet,
so the organization is still informal." He added
that Biden supporters expect the senator to
announce his candidacy in early May.
"There seems to be more enthusiasm for
presidential campaigns (than for local elec
tions)," Lemley added.
