## THE 						STANFORD DAILY An Independent Newspaper Debate is needed 
### 
The voting In this year's ASSU elections is
over and the names of the winners will be
available soon. However, questions remain
about the enthusiasm the student body has
shown for the whole process: How many
people voted only to get their fee refunds?
This potential lack of interest among Stan
ford students is not due to cynicism. The
problem instead runs much deeper. Stu
dents do not take much interest in the elec
tions because they do not know who, or
what, they are voting for. This year, there
was very little on which to base a choice in a
campaign unusually devoid of issues. As one
Council of Presidents member said, "It's
never good to promise the moon, but there's
a big difference between promising the moon
and putting your name and nothing else on a
Hier."
The problems with the slates are even
worse than those with the senate. Sub
stantive issues could be discussed in
speeches and debates. Instead we were vic
timized by an endless barrage of fliers. The
ASSU should sponsor forums so that stu
dents can find out what the candidates are
thinking.

Voters were also confused about whether a
given slate was running for senior class pres
ident or COP. Considering that most of the
campaign propaganda attempted to promote
clever slate names, it is unlikely that stu
dents were able to make an informed choice
in either contest.
The lack of substantive issues in the COP
race is due in part to the fact that the COP is
not accountable for its actions. Indeed it is
unlikely that any executive council can be ef
fective when everyone always has the oppor
tunity to pass the buck.
In the past, the ASSU has had one student
body president; it is now time to return to
such a system. Instead of having invisible
people hiding behind slates that stand for
everything, students hopefully will have the
opportunity to vote for a visible person who
stands for something.
This chief executive will be free to appoint
additional people to help with the workload,
but he or she will always be accountable for
what goes on. The familiar COP chorus —
"I'm not in charge of that, the other person
is," — will no longer be heard. The time for
such a change is now. It is up to the students
to insist on making it a reality.
