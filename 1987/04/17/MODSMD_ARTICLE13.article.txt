# Surrogacy is mistake
## 
### 
The general public Is being mislead by representa
tives of the growing industry of surrogate parenting
who are advocating this new and profitable practice.
While the decision in the Baby M case is under ap
peal, it is time to ponder the wisdom of the entire
concept of "surrogate parenting."
Those advocating surrogate parenting would have
you believe the following disturbing statements:

JOSEPH DAVIS
DIRCK BROWN

□ Every infertile couple is entitled to have children
by whatever means are available.
This is more a case of self-love than love for a child.
We sympathize with the pain and suffering of in
fertile couples. However, the need for a child can
become an obsession as it blinds the couple to the
potentially damaging effects of surrogacy on the
child. It may also blind couples to the needs of other
children who are desparately hoping to be adopted by
loving parents.
□ Surrogacy is justifiable when a man — the
sperm donor in the surrogacy situation — desires a
child to carry his own genes into future generations.
This fails to take into account the potentially long
term divisive effects on a marriage when the child
produced by means of a surrogacy agreement is ge
netically related to the husband but not to the wife.
This reality is fertile ground for family dysfunction as
the child enters adolescence and as the child and his
or her adoptive mother become more aware of their
genetic alienation from each other.
□ Baby M (and all surrogate children) will be
happy with her situation in life as she realizes that
she was a "gift of love."
The reality is that she was not given; she was sold
by her natural mother and purchased by her biologi
cal father. This is the harsh reality that Baby M will
have to live with all her life. It will affect her sense of
identity and self-worth.
□ Surrogacy is sanctioned in our culture.

We fought a civil war to put an end to an economic
system of buying and selling human beings. A court
may rule that surrogacy is legal and binding, but can
we live with the immorality of a contract that
legalizes the sale of babies?
□ The Baby M case will not be repeated if only
more care is taken in screening and evaluating po
tential surrogate mothers.
Our clinical experience with hundreds of women
who have relinquished their child for adoption con
firms the fact that it is humanly impossible for a
woman to be sure how she will feel after carrying a
baby for nine months and giving birth. There is
simply no way to predict the full impact of pregnancy
and birth along with the guilt of premeditated aban
donment of a baby at birth.
□ The belief that once the child produced by sur
rogate contract is placed in the adoptive family, this
family will be like any other family.
Our experience with scores of adoptive families
proves this to be false. As she grows up, Baby M will
want and need to know the "full story" of her concep
tion, birth and relinquishment. As she becomes a
young woman, she will want to hear the truth from
her natural mother, meet her half brother and sister,
and know them as human beings to whom she has a
lifelong biological and emotional tie. Unlike non
adoptive families, she will have to find ways to ex
plain her special status to her peers in school when
they ask: "How come your real mother gave you up?"
We believe that these misconceptions arise be
cause the long-term impact of surrogacy on the child
has been overlooked. We are concerned that this
lifelong view is neglected for more immediate goals
because this is an age of instant gratification. On a
deeper level, it is also an age in which man still
believes he can control nature to meet his own needs.
We hope surrogate parenting will be ultimately
rendered illegal on the grounds that it is morally and
ethically unsound and contrary to the long-term In
terests and healthy development of the child.
