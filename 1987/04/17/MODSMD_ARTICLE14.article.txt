# Western Culture tracks suffice

### 
On Monday, the Western Culture Task Force
released Its report calling for major reforms In
the Western Culture requirement. It recom
mends that the purpose of the sequence
become the study of diverse cultures and will
mean, among other things, the abolition of the
core list of readings.

While I wholeheartedly believe "the liberal
education of Stanford undergraduates should
Include study of the cultural diversity that has
become the heritage of us all," as the task force
writes, the Idea behind Western Culture, that
there are certain great thinkers we must
study, is not a denial of other cultures. It is
true, and undeniably unfortunate, that most
of the great classics that have shaped Western
thought and religion — as well as our legal, po
litical and educational institutions — were
written by males, many of them white. It is
equally true that our present culture has been
profoundly affected by its Interaction with
other cultures. The charge that the current
Western Culture sequence ignores the contri
butions to our society by women and people of
color is deeply disturbing, and must be
redressed in some ways. But for better or
worse, an elite group of great thinkers has had
the most profound effect on Western institu
tions. and the study of their thought should be
the primary focus of a required Western Cul
ture sequence at any great university.
The effect of the teachings of St. Augustine
upon the Western religious system, the impor
tance of Descartes' scientific method to the de
velopment of Western education and the evolu
tion of Western political systems in terms of
the ideas of John Locke are fundamentals that
must be taught at Stanford. Minorities and

women do not really figure into these classics,
but the fact remains that a certain group of
"great thinkers" has had a profound effect
upon Western institutions, and their works
should be read as part of a core reading list. Of
course, the classics should be taught in light of
the fact that minorities and women are often
excluded — that sad fact is as much an impor
tant heritage of Western culture as is the ac
tual writing of these "great thinkers."
The task force recommendations are so
broad in their desire to open our minds to the
influence of diverse cultures that if the recom
mendations are to work at all, the study of the
great thinkers will be no more. This cannot be
allowed to happen, despite the glaring need for
Stanford undergraduates to be educated in
diverse cultures. The task force calls for Area
One "courses that study the traditions and
values of diverse cultures." The task force is
absolutely right that such study is necessary
for a liberal education and its concerns are
well-founded. However, these concerns should
be directed in a positive direction that will get
students to study such things without destroy
ing the idea of the Western Culture require
ment.
There are also great logistical problems with
the recommendations of the task force. There
is already barely enough time to teach the
readings now included in Western Culture. In
addition, no professor at Stanford is qualified
to teach a course of "the whole world according
to everyone" for even one quarter.The only so
lution possible that would begin to satisfy the
demands of the task force within the
framework of a one-year required sequence
would be to have a rapid rotation of different
professors from many departments. There are
no limitations to the suggestions of the task
force, and the result of any attempt to "enact"
its recommendations will be to produce chaos.
A course designed to do everything and satisfy
everyone will likely do neither.
The task force has legitimate worries regard
ing the proper scope of a liberal education and
the notion that Stanford's Area One require

ment does not satisfy this scope. The difficulty
is to integrate the study of diverse cultures
into the education of every Stanford under
graduate, and solutions are hard to come by.
Assoc. History Prof. Clay Carson told The
Daily that under a new Area One requirement
"people can learn about Marx as he is seen and
absorbed by Third World countries." Of course
they can, and they should. But first Marx
should be read in itself, as a product of the
time in which it was written.
Perhaps there is a solution that would bring
his and other task force members' excellent
ideas into the Area One sequence. The core list
of readings could be taught in the current
Western Culture fashion for two quarters. In
the current Western Culture system, the se
quence seems to lose its focus in the third
quarter, so perhaps the classics could be
related to modern fascism, women, minorities,
etc. in that third quarter.
Of course, this would leave students a woe
fully inadequate liberal arts education, but it
would avoid chaos, preserve the classics to
some degree and incorporate diverse cultures
to some extent. The third quarter would
become the appropriate time to read Kwame
Nkrumah and relate his writing and his ac
tions in Ghana to the Marx read previously, to
read modern interpretations of the founda
tions of Western culture by women intellec
tuals, etc.
Another idea would be to have a structured
liberal education for everyone — nine units re
quired for the whole year that would incor
porate both the Western Culture sequence as
we have known it and World Culture as we
want it. 1 personally favor this idea but have no
faith in the University to design such a pro
gram because it would interfere with the pres
sure to produce good engineers that reigns su
preme at Stanford.
In any case, we should not sacrifice the clas
sics for the legitimate need to educate in the
way the task force recommends. A different di
rection must be found somehow.

On Monday, the Western Culture Task Force
released Its report calling for major reforms In
the Western Culture requirement. It recom
mends that the purpose of the sequence
become the study of diverse cultures and will
mean, among other things, the abolition of the
core list of readings.

While I wholeheartedly believe "the liberal
education of Stanford undergraduates should
Include study of the cultural diversity that has
become the heritage of us all," as the task force
writes, the Idea behind Western Culture, that
there are certain great thinkers we must
study, is not a denial of other cultures. It is
true, and undeniably unfortunate, that most
of the great classics that have shaped Western
thought and religion — as well as our legal, po
litical and educational institutions — were
written by males, many of them white. It is
equally true that our present culture has been
profoundly affected by its Interaction with
other cultures. The charge that the current
Western Culture sequence ignores the contri
butions to our society by women and people of
color is deeply disturbing, and must be
redressed in some ways. But for better or
worse, an elite group of great thinkers has had
the most profound effect on Western institu
tions. and the study of their thought should be
the primary focus of a required Western Cul
ture sequence at any great university.
The effect of the teachings of St. Augustine
upon the Western religious system, the impor
tance of Descartes' scientific method to the de
velopment of Western education and the evolu
tion of Western political systems in terms of
the ideas of John Locke are fundamentals that
must be taught at Stanford. Minorities and

women do not really figure into these classics,
but the fact remains that a certain group of
"great thinkers" has had a profound effect
upon Western institutions, and their works
should be read as part of a core reading list. Of
course, the classics should be taught in light of
the fact that minorities and women are often
excluded — that sad fact is as much an impor
tant heritage of Western culture as is the ac
tual writing of these "great thinkers."
The task force recommendations are so
broad in their desire to open our minds to the
influence of diverse cultures that if the recom
mendations are to work at all, the study of the
great thinkers will be no more. This cannot be
allowed to happen, despite the glaring need for
Stanford undergraduates to be educated in
diverse cultures. The task force calls for Area
One "courses that study the traditions and
values of diverse cultures." The task force is
absolutely right that such study is necessary
for a liberal education and its concerns are
well-founded. However, these concerns should
be directed in a positive direction that will get
students to study such things without destroy
ing the idea of the Western Culture require
ment.
There are also great logistical problems with
the recommendations of the task force. There
is already barely enough time to teach the
readings now included in Western Culture. In
addition, no professor at Stanford is qualified
to teach a course of "the whole world according
to everyone" for even one quarter.The only so
lution possible that would begin to satisfy the
demands of the task force within the
framework of a one-year required sequence
would be to have a rapid rotation of different
professors from many departments. There are
no limitations to the suggestions of the task
force, and the result of any attempt to "enact"
its recommendations will be to produce chaos.
A course designed to do everything and satisfy
everyone will likely do neither.
The task force has legitimate worries regard
ing the proper scope of a liberal education and
the notion that Stanford's Area One require

ment does not satisfy this scope. The difficulty
is to integrate the study of diverse cultures
into the education of every Stanford under
graduate, and solutions are hard to come by.
Assoc. History Prof. Clay Carson told The
Daily that under a new Area One requirement
"people can learn about Marx as he is seen and
absorbed by Third World countries." Of course
they can, and they should. But first Marx
should be read in itself, as a product of the
time in which it was written.
Perhaps there is a solution that would bring
his and other task force members' excellent
ideas into the Area One sequence. The core list
of readings could be taught in the current
Western Culture fashion for two quarters. In
the current Western Culture system, the se
quence seems to lose its focus in the third
quarter, so perhaps the classics could be
related to modern fascism, women, minorities,
etc. in that third quarter.
Of course, this would leave students a woe
fully inadequate liberal arts education, but it
would avoid chaos, preserve the classics to
some degree and incorporate diverse cultures
to some extent. The third quarter would
become the appropriate time to read Kwame
Nkrumah and relate his writing and his ac
tions in Ghana to the Marx read previously, to
read modern interpretations of the founda
tions of Western culture by women intellec
tuals, etc.
Another idea would be to have a structured
liberal education for everyone — nine units re
quired for the whole year that would incor
porate both the Western Culture sequence as
we have known it and World Culture as we
want it. 1 personally favor this idea but have no
faith in the University to design such a pro
gram because it would interfere with the pres
sure to produce good engineers that reigns su
preme at Stanford.
In any case, we should not sacrifice the clas
sics for the legitimate need to educate in the
way the task force recommends. A different di
rection must be found somehow.
