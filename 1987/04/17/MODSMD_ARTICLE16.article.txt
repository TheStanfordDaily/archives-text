We live in a complex, busy
world full of tests, assignments,
tuition payments, dates (or lack
thereof) and other problems. But
the world is bigger than the
boundaries we all place around
ourselves, and its existence needs
to be recognized. It is toward this
need that this letter is addressed.
I recently had the chance to
meet with the group of students
that went to El Salvador. It
turned out to be a very rewarding,
inspiring and provacative experi
ence. They seem more than will
ing. in fact dedicated, to share
their experiences. We should
utilize this resource. They want
to share what they saw, felt and
experienced in El Salvador. They
are extremely open-minded and
diverse as a group, and are very
anxious to communicate with the
community. Talking with them
puts everything in another per
spective.
The group that went was a lot
like all of us and it is very easy to
gain a sense of how it changed
them and how it would have
changed us if we had gone. It
appeared to me that they are not
spreading dogma, but are giving
firsthand data, and then posing
key questions about what is
going on there for everyone to
consider and answer for them
selves In their own way. It is
amazing how much we can learn
about ourselves and our world in
a few hours. For the questions
that arise are about people strug
gling and suffering for their very
existence. Only these are real
people just like you, me and the
group that went to see them. This
is something that is easily forgot
ten over the distances that sepa
rate us.
I would like to thank the stu
dents for sharing their experi
ences with me and for all the
effort that they put into the pro
gram, as well as thanking those
who organized and planned the

trip. I would encourage everyone
to talk to the people that went
and hope that similar programs
will happen. Such experiences are
more valuable than any test we
will ever take and are key to un
derstanding ourselves, our world
and our future.

Freshman, undeclared
Whites under
represented in
admissions
A recent article on the increase
in minority admissions to Stan
ford (Daily, April 10) neglected to
draw one significant conclusion:
Based on The Daily's figures,
non-Hispanic whites have now
become one of Stanford's most
underrepresented ethnic groups.
This is an interesting conse
quence of official minority
recruitment policies.
Admissions figures for the class
of 1991 include: native
Americans, 0.9 percent; Asian-
Americans, 17.1 percent: blacks,
9.4 percent: Hispanics, 7.9 per
cent: and other whites, 64.7 per
cent. Based on the ethnic distri
bution of the U.S. population,
these totals imply the underrepre
sentation of whites is nearly the
most severe.
Furthermore, if we chose as our
base the number of graduating
high school seniors in each eth
nic group rather than the overall
population figures, the statistical
tilt against "other whites" would
likely become worse, leaving this
ethnic group as the single least
represented at Stanford.
Most importantly, the category
"other whites" is a bureaucratic
absurdity, lumping together doz
ens of different Caucasian ethnic
groups with totally dissimilar
patterns of economic and educa
tional advancement. Mayflower
WASPs and recent immigrants
from rural Egypt are both
squeezed into the same single
category.

A more detailed ethnic analysis
of Stanford admissions would
certainly reveal some of these
"white" ethnic groups to be enor
mously underrepresented on
campus, with admission levels
only one-tenth or one-twentieth
that of such official minorities as
blacks or Hispanics.
In addition, many of these
unrecognized ethnic groups,
such as Appalachian whites,
probably face cultural and psy
chological barriers to applying to
Stanford comparable to those
faced by inner-city blacks or
southwestern Hispanics.
Yet Stanford policies, which
apparently emphasize skin color
over personal socio-economic
status, seem to ignore these is
sues.
Perhaps if current ethnic
recruitment and admissions
policies at Stanford were com
pletely eliminated and replaced by
policies aimed at applicants of
low socio-economic status, these
absurdities would disappear.
Any reasonable person should
agree that an applicant — black
or white — from a welfare
household, neither of whose par
ents attended college, should be
favored over a comparable appli
cant — black or white — both of
whose parents are highly paid
professionals. American ethnic or
geographical groups that are
disproportionately poor or un
dereducated would benefit ac
cordingly.
In contrast, present Stanford
policies appear to target mostly
the highly privileged individuals
of generally underprivileged eth
nic groups. Providing special
admissions to the prep school
children of black doctors and
lawyers does absolutely nothing
for the black underclass and
provokes the justifiable anger of
Impoverished whites. Adding,
say, an automatic 20 percent to
the SAT scores and GPAs of all
applicants raised on welfare
seems a much better and fairer
alternative.

inspiring and provacative experi
ence. They seem more than will
ing. in fact dedicated, to share
their experiences. We should
utilize this resource. They want
to share what they saw, felt and
experienced in El Salvador. They
are extremely open-minded and
diverse as a group, and are very
anxious to communicate with the
community. Talking with them
puts everything in another per
spective.
The group that went was a lot
like all of us and it is very easy to
gain a sense of how it changed
them and how it would have
changed us if we had gone. It
appeared to me that they are not
spreading dogma, but are giving
firsthand data, and then posing
key questions about what is
going on there for everyone to
consider and answer for them
selves In their own way. It is
amazing how much we can learn
about ourselves and our world in
a few hours. For the questions
that arise are about people strug
gling and suffering for their very
existence. Only these are real
people just like you, me and the
group that went to see them. This
is something that is easily forgot
ten over the distances that sepa
rate us.
I would like to thank the stu
dents for sharing their experi
ences with me and for all the
effort that they put into the pro
gram, as well as thanking those
who organized and planned the

trip. I would encourage everyone
to talk to the people that went
and hope that similar programs
will happen. Such experiences are
more valuable than any test we
will ever take and are key to un
derstanding ourselves, our world
and our future.

Whites under
represented in
admissions
A recent article on the increase
in minority admissions to Stan
ford (Daily, April 10) neglected to
draw one significant conclusion:
Based on The Daily's figures,
non-Hispanic whites have now
become one of Stanford's most
underrepresented ethnic groups.
This is an interesting conse
quence of official minority
recruitment policies.
Admissions figures for the class
of 1991 include: native
Americans, 0.9 percent; Asian-
Americans, 17.1 percent: blacks,
9.4 percent: Hispanics, 7.9 per
cent: and other whites, 64.7 per
cent. Based on the ethnic distri
bution of the U.S. population,
these totals imply the underrepre
sentation of whites is nearly the
most severe.
Furthermore, if we chose as our
base the number of graduating
high school seniors in each eth
nic group rather than the overall
population figures, the statistical
tilt against "other whites" would
likely become worse, leaving this
ethnic group as the single least
represented at Stanford.
Most importantly, the category
"other whites" is a bureaucratic
absurdity, lumping together doz
ens of different Caucasian ethnic
groups with totally dissimilar
patterns of economic and educa
tional advancement. Mayflower
WASPs and recent immigrants
from rural Egypt are both
squeezed into the same single
category.

A more detailed ethnic analysis
of Stanford admissions would
certainly reveal some of these
"white" ethnic groups to be enor
mously underrepresented on
campus, with admission levels
only one-tenth or one-twentieth
that of such official minorities as
blacks or Hispanics.
In addition, many of these
unrecognized ethnic groups,
such as Appalachian whites,
probably face cultural and psy
chological barriers to applying to
Stanford comparable to those
faced by inner-city blacks or
southwestern Hispanics.
Yet Stanford policies, which
apparently emphasize skin color
over personal socio-economic
status, seem to ignore these is
sues.
Perhaps if current ethnic
recruitment and admissions
policies at Stanford were com
pletely eliminated and replaced by
policies aimed at applicants of
low socio-economic status, these
absurdities would disappear.
Any reasonable person should
agree that an applicant — black
or white — from a welfare
household, neither of whose par
ents attended college, should be
favored over a comparable appli
cant — black or white — both of
whose parents are highly paid
professionals. American ethnic or
geographical groups that are
disproportionately poor or un
dereducated would benefit ac
cordingly.
In contrast, present Stanford
policies appear to target mostly
the highly privileged individuals
of generally underprivileged eth
nic groups. Providing special
admissions to the prep school
children of black doctors and
lawyers does absolutely nothing
for the black underclass and
provokes the justifiable anger of
Impoverished whites. Adding,
say, an automatic 20 percent to
the SAT scores and GPAs of all
applicants raised on welfare
seems a much better and fairer
alternative.
