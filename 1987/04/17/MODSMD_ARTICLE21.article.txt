## Surging Cardinal guns for upsets against USC, UCLA 
### JON WEISMAN Staff writer 
Even though the NCAA champion
ships do not begin until May 16, playoff
time has already begun for the Stanford
men's tennis team.
The Cardinal probably will have a na
tional tournament bid on the line when
it takes on top-ranked USC (27-0) today
at Stanford Tennis Stadium at 1:30
p m., and No. 3 UCLA (19-5) tomorrow
in a split match at noon and 6:30 p.m.
The match against the Bruins is being
divided Into outdoor and indoor por
tions. Third through sixth singles and
second and third doubles will be played
In the afternoon at Stanford Tennis
Stadium, while No. 1 doubles and No. 1
and 2 singles will be at Maples Pavilion
at night.
Although the Cardinal, 12-8 overall
and 4-3 in the Pacific 10 Southern Divi
sion, can do no better than tie for first
place in the conference (USC is 7-0),
these matches will still have a profound
impact on Stanford's chances of gaining
one of 12 at-large bids for the NCAAs.
The team's task is formidable. USC
has all six singles players ranked In the
top 100. UCLA, amazingly, can top this.
The Bruins have seven players ranked in
the top 100 in singles, even though only
six can start at one time.
. Each team has three pairs ranked in
the top 50 in doubles, although UCLA's
Patrick Galbraith is on two of those
Bruins' duos.
By contrast, Stanford has a "mere"
two players listed in each of the singles
and doubles rankings. Patrick McEnroe
(7-6) is 24th in singles, while Jeff
Tarango (20-5) Is 31st. In doubles, Jeff
Cathrall and Eric Peus (16-5) are 45th
and McEnroe and Scott Moody (6-1) are
50th.

Still, Stanford had enough manpower
to beat No. 2 Long Beach State Tuesday,
6-3. So, despite losing to UCLA 8-1 and
USC 6-3 In Los Angeles two weeks ago,
the defending national champion Card
inal may be up for the challenge this
weekend.
The key match against the Trojans
today may be Tarango vs. fourth-ranked
Rick Leach In No. 1 singles. Leach, who
beat Tarango 6-3, 6-2 when they last
met, is almost a hero to Tarango, who
has watched Leach play since the Card
inal freshman was eight years old and
the Trojan was 12.
"I felt bad about not playing better
against him." Tarango said. "When he
stepped up to the line to serve, it was
like, OK, there's no way I'm going to
break. . . . When I was serving, I started
out, and I double-faulted twice in the
first game.
"I was just a complete bundle of
nerves," Tarango said. "And then I'd get
the shots to put away a game or some
thing, and I'd hit the back net, and it
was just a real ugly experience. I think
I'll be a lot more calm and collected, and
I'm playing a lot better now than I was
then."
Despite the rankings of the Trojan
players, Stanford figures to be very com
petitive. The last time the teams met,
McEnroe beat No. 2 Luke Jensen and
Moody knocked off No. 29 Jonas Wall
gard. Also, the Cardinal doubles teams,
which had previously been the team's
downfall, are 8-1 since Jacobson and
Tarango teamed up at No. 2 and Moody
and McEnroe joined at No. 1
"Pat beat Luke Jensen down there,
and beat him last year when he played
him, and so that's a match we can win,"
Gould said. "Tarango and Leach —
they're both from Southern Cal. [Leach]
is a god (to Tarango) and Jeff has got to

get over that when he plays him. and
he's capable of beating him. He's been
playing really well for us. But USC is very
beatable, I think."
Both Stanford and UCLA will have a
challenge on Saturday to adjust from the
slower-moving courts and relaxed at
mosphere of the outdoors to the faster
carpet of Maples. Gould said that the in
door match usually attracts the year's
largest crowd to witness a college match.
"Basically, when our courts (outside)
were a little quicker, we'd go inside on
the carpet, which plays a little faster,
and it would play very much the same,"
Gould said. "Two years ago, we slowed
these courts down dramatically. Now
there's quite a difference between these
courts and the courts inside."
Because the carpet was not laid down
until last night, Stanford will have no
more practice time in Maples than
UCLA.
"It's going to be whoever adjusts best
to the carpet," Gould said. "Unfor
tunately, both of my players (Tarango
and McEnroe) are not primarily serve
and-volley players, and that's going to
make it really tough this year."
Gould said the reason the outdoor
courts were slowed down was to make
them more like the courts at Athens,
Ga., where the national championships
are played annually.
"We decided, hey. if we're going to go
back to where the national champion
ship is, we better make our courts (like
theirs)," he said.
Last year, it didn't take a Six-Pac
championship for Stanford to test that
theory to perfection, only an NCAA
berth. A win or two this weekend could
give it the chance to do it again.

6-3. So, despite losing to UCLA 8-1 and
USC 6-3 In Los Angeles two weeks ago,
the defending national champion Card
inal may be up for the challenge this
weekend.
The key match against the Trojans
today may be Tarango vs. fourth-ranked
Rick Leach In No. 1 singles. Leach, who
beat Tarango 6-3, 6-2 when they last
met, is almost a hero to Tarango, who
has watched Leach play since the Card
inal freshman was eight years old and
the Trojan was 12.
"I felt bad about not playing better
against him." Tarango said. "When he
stepped up to the line to serve, it was
like, OK, there's no way I'm going to
break. . . . When I was serving, I started
out, and I double-faulted twice in the
first game.
"I was just a complete bundle of
nerves," Tarango said. "And then I'd get
the shots to put away a game or some
thing, and I'd hit the back net, and it
was just a real ugly experience. I think
I'll be a lot more calm and collected, and
I'm playing a lot better now than I was
then."
Despite the rankings of the Trojan
players, Stanford figures to be very com
petitive. The last time the teams met,
McEnroe beat No. 2 Luke Jensen and
Moody knocked off No. 29 Jonas Wall
gard. Also, the Cardinal doubles teams,
which had previously been the team's
downfall, are 8-1 since Jacobson and
Tarango teamed up at No. 2 and Moody
and McEnroe joined at No. 1
"Pat beat Luke Jensen down there,
and beat him last year when he played
him, and so that's a match we can win,"
Gould said. "Tarango and Leach —
they're both from Southern Cal. [Leach]
is a god (to Tarango) and Jeff has got to

get over that when he plays him. and
he's capable of beating him. He's been
playing really well for us. But USC is very
beatable, I think."
Both Stanford and UCLA will have a
challenge on Saturday to adjust from the
slower-moving courts and relaxed at
mosphere of the outdoors to the faster
carpet of Maples. Gould said that the in
door match usually attracts the year's
largest crowd to witness a college match.
"Basically, when our courts (outside)
were a little quicker, we'd go inside on
the carpet, which plays a little faster,
and it would play very much the same,"
Gould said. "Two years ago, we slowed
these courts down dramatically. Now
there's quite a difference between these
courts and the courts inside."
Because the carpet was not laid down
until last night, Stanford will have no
more practice time in Maples than
UCLA.
"It's going to be whoever adjusts best
to the carpet," Gould said. "Unfor
tunately, both of my players (Tarango
and McEnroe) are not primarily serve
and-volley players, and that's going to
make it really tough this year."
Gould said the reason the outdoor
courts were slowed down was to make
them more like the courts at Athens,
Ga., where the national championships
are played annually.
"We decided, hey. if we're going to go
back to where the national champion
ship is, we better make our courts (like
theirs)," he said.
Last year, it didn't take a Six-Pac
championship for Stanford to test that
theory to perfection, only an NCAA
berth. A win or two this weekend could
give it the chance to do it again.

Freshman Jeff Cathrall keyed Stanford's upset victory over Long Beach State on Tues
day. Today and tomorrow, Cathrall will be trying to push the Cardinal past No. 1 USC.
and No. 3 UCLA and into the NCAA tournament
Even though the NCAA champion
ships do not begin until May 16, playoff
time has already begun for the Stanford
men's tennis team.
The Cardinal probably will have a na
tional tournament bid on the line when
it takes on top-ranked USC (27-0) today
at Stanford Tennis Stadium at 1:30
p m., and No. 3 UCLA (19-5) tomorrow
in a split match at noon and 6:30 p.m.
The match against the Bruins is being
divided Into outdoor and indoor por
tions. Third through sixth singles and
second and third doubles will be played
In the afternoon at Stanford Tennis
Stadium, while No. 1 doubles and No. 1
and 2 singles will be at Maples Pavilion
at night.
Although the Cardinal, 12-8 overall
and 4-3 in the Pacific 10 Southern Divi
sion, can do no better than tie for first
place in the conference (USC is 7-0),
these matches will still have a profound
impact on Stanford's chances of gaining
one of 12 at-large bids for the NCAAs.
The team's task is formidable. USC
has all six singles players ranked In the
top 100. UCLA, amazingly, can top this.
The Bruins have seven players ranked in
the top 100 in singles, even though only
six can start at one time.
. Each team has three pairs ranked in
the top 50 in doubles, although UCLA's
Patrick Galbraith is on two of those
Bruins' duos.
By contrast, Stanford has a "mere"
two players listed in each of the singles
and doubles rankings. Patrick McEnroe
(7-6) is 24th in singles, while Jeff
Tarango (20-5) Is 31st. In doubles, Jeff
Cathrall and Eric Peus (16-5) are 45th
and McEnroe and Scott Moody (6-1) are
50th.

to beat No. 2 Long Beach State Tuesday,
6-3. So, despite losing to UCLA 8-1 and
