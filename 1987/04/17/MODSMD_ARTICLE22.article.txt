# Wildcats jump to fast lead, hold on for 10-5 triumph

TUCSON, Ariz. — There was
something of a role reversal last
night at Sancet Field.
The Pacific 10 Southern
Division-leading Stanford Card
inal squandered scoring opportu
nities, ran the bases terribly and
could not make the critical plays
In the field.
The fifth-place Arizona Wildcats,
by contrast, played aggressively,
made the plays defensively and
cashed in their scoring chances to
record a 10-5 win.
The Stanford loss, coupled with
UCLA's 10-inning, 13-12 victory
over Arizona State, dropped the
Cardinal into a virtual tie with the
Bruins in the Six-Pac race. Stan
ford still leads, but just by
percentage points, with a 12-5
conference record to UCLA's 13-6.
Arizona upped its league mark to
7-12.
The Cardinal seemed to have a
lot going for it entering the game.
Stanford had won 12 of its last 14
league games and was sending its
ace. Jack McDowell, to the
mound.

Arizona, on the other hand, was
fighting a five-game Six-Pac losing
streak, and because the Wildcats
used their top pitcher, Gilbert
Heredia, in relief last Sunday.
Arizona Coach Jerry Kindall was
forced to use Frank Halcovich.
Halcovich entered the game with
an 0-4 record and a 9.30 ERA in
league play.
Still, it was Halcovich who
lasted 7 2/3 innings, while
McDowell was gone after four,
having allowed nine runs.
It was McDowell's second
straight sub-par outing, but bore
no resemblance to the pummeling
he took last week against UCLA. If
McDowell was eaten alive by the
Bruins, he was nibbled to death
by the Wildcats, especially during
their five-run first inning.
Greg Fowble led off with a bunt
single that hit third base. Rich
Schuman walked and the runners
moved up on a Chip Hale bunt.
McDowell fanned Halcovich, and
looked poised to escape the inning
when he got ahead of Steve Strong
0-2.
But then came the game's pivo
tal play. Strong chopped the ball
between first and second. Second

baseman Frank Carey charged it,
then bobbled it in front of him.
Recovering quickly. Carey threw
to first.
It was a bang-bang play — and
the Cardinal did not get the call,
as Carey was charged with a run
scoring error.
"From my point of view, he was
out," shortstop David Esquer
said. "But Coach (Mark) Marquess
said we're not going to get that call
on the road."
Not only didn't the Cardinal get
the call, it didn't get the third out
for quite a while either. Singles by
Gary Alexander and Dave Shermet
put Arizona ahead 3-0. Freshman
first baseman J.T. Snow capped
the inning with a two-run hit-and
run double through the vacated
hole at shortstop.
"Our clutch hitting in the first
inning with two outs was out
standing," Kindall said. "All three
guys really battled. It was good in
the first to jump ahead of
McDowell."
Halcovich held Stanford score
less through six innings, but not
without some help from both his

The Cardinal baseball team needed more than good bunting last night to overcome the 10-0 deficit that it
spotted the Arizona Wildcats in Tucson. Several baserunning errors thwarted early Stanford scoring
chances, and late inning rallies were not enough as the Wildcats prevailed 10-5. The Cardinal will try to
regain sole possession of first place in the Pacific 10 Southern Division by winning today's 7 p.m. contest
