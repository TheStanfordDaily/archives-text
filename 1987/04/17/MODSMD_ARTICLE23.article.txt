# Healthy lady netters visit ailing USC, UCLA

Injuries seem to be the recurring theme of
collegiate women's tennis this season, and
while fifth-ranked Stanford has been re
establishing its top lineup over the past
week with the return of senior Leigh Anne
Eldredge and sophomore Eleni Rossides.
USC and UCLA have been falling apart.
The Cardinal, 15-3 overall, will attempt to
strengthen Its seeding for next month's
NCAA team championship when it visits
USC today at 1:30 p.m. and UCLA tomor
row at 1 p.m.
The Trojans, winners of three of the past
six national championships and last year's
runner-up to Stanford, find themselves on
the edge of not qualifying for this year's
tournament. USC is ranked seventh in the
most recent poll, but the Trojans have lost
four straight matches since beating Califor
nia April 3. The first loss in that streak
came April 4 — a 6-3 defeat at the hands of
the Cardinal.
The losing streak has dropped USC to 13-
9 on the season. "We're looking to next
year," Trojan Coach Dave Borelll said.
USC's hopes for another strong season
diminished drastically when Caroline
Kuhlman, who was ranked No. 1 in the na
tion for most of last year, came up with ten
donitis early in the season. Kuhlman has
played in only five matches, and two days
ago it was announced that she will be out of
action for three months, which will cause
her to miss the remainder of the season.
The Trojans have also been without Mary
Norwood, the team's No. 3 singles per
former. for the past three matches. Borelli
said she is doubtful for today's match.

"We played a pretty tough schedule,"
Borelll said. "We played everybody In the top
20. I think. I generally like to do that, but
this might have been a bad year with the In
juries."
UCLA has also been winless since leaving
the Bay Area two weeks ago. The Bruins,
who are ranked second in the nation and
rose to 20-0 with a 5-4 victory over Stanford
April 5, are now 20-3 following three
straight losses during a road trip to Texas
last weekend. The Bruins stumbled at
Southern Methodist, Texas and Trinity —
all by 5-4 margins.
UCLA was not 100 percent last weekend,
as Jennifer Fuchs and Allyson Cooper, the
team's No. 3 and 4 performers, played with
nagging injuries. In fact, Fuchs was not
able to play singles in the loss to Texas.
Both players will be in the lineup tomorrow,
however.
The Cardinal is still not completely
healthy. Junior Cari Hagey will miss this
weekend's action because of a strained left
knee, and Rossides is not in top shape. Yet.
optimism abounds among the members of
the defending NCAA champions, who have
won eight of their last nine dual matches.
"1 think we're pretty hot right now." Stan
ford Coach Frank Brennan said. "We've
played some good matches in a row. It was
kind of tough without Cari Hagey last time
(against USC and UCLA).
"Now 1 think our spirits are back up," he
added. "We've been having great practices.
Leigh Anne's back, (and) Eleni has finally
played a match and she's getting healthier."
Brennan said that while many teams are
overworked, the Cardinal is fresh as it looks

toward the upcoming championships. "A
lot of teams at this point in the season are
really getting tired," he said. "They're get
ting frustrated and discouraged. They've
traveled too much."
On the other hand, Stanford is just now
starting to peak, according to Brennan.
"I'm looking to have very possibly the

healthiest team at (the) nationals," he said.
Brennan explained that a pair of wins
this weekend would mean more than just
beating two rivals. "We have a chance to
move up to No. 2 in the nation (behind
Florida)," he said. "It would certainly be
nice to go into (the) nationals seeded as
high as possible."
One person who likes the Cardinal's
chances is Borelli. "They're probably the
best team on paper if they're healthy." the
Trojan coach said.
