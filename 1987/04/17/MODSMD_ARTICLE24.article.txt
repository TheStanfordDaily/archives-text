As the track season swings into
full gear. so does the Stanford
track team.
Alter a good showing in last
weekend's Stanford Track Classic
at Stanford Stadium, the Cardinal
will travel tomorrow just down the
road to San Jose, where it will be
one ol many teams competing in
the Bruce Jenner Classic. With
the exception of seven women who
will be in Florida taking part in
the Eastern Invitational, the
;quad looks to be at nearly full
strength.
We've been getting better by
leaps and bounds," Asst. Coach
Scott Chisam said. "Now it's that
championship time of year when
everything relates to qualifying."
Qualifying for both the Pacific
10 Conference championships
held May 23 at Oregon State and
the NCAA championships sched
uled for June 3 to 6 in Baton
Rouge, La., will be first on the
Cardinal's agenda this weekend.
While many of Stanford's ath
letes have already qualified for the
Pac-lOs, only two have bettered

the NCAA standards. If the Card
inal is to score well at the nation
als, qualifiers Lisa Bernhagen
(high jump) and Patty Purpur
(shot put) will need some help.
Giving the two some company will
be the task of the day.
In Florida, the two women most
likely to qualify will be freshman
Carol Gray and senior Pam Board.
Board, the returning conference
champion in the 400 meter
hurdles, just missed qualifying lor
the NCAAs last year. This year,
after winning her first race and
twice beating her rival from UCLA.
Gayle Kellon, the senior looks
right on track.
Gray, a freshman All-America
selection in cross country, missed
qualifying in the 3,000 by less
than a second last weekend. With
another race under her belt and
the added experience gained by it.
Gray looks almost certain to
qualify soon.
Back in San Jose, juniors Chris
tian Skoog in the 800 and Brian
Marshall in the high jump could
be the Cardinal's best bet. Last
weekend, Skoog won a tough 800

Stanford junior high jumper Lisa Bernhagen has already posted heights good enough to qualify her for
both the Pacific 10 Conference ehampionships and the NCAA championships. Bernhagen's teammates,
however, will be trying to qualify for those postseason festivities on Saturday at the Bruce Jenner Classic
in San Jose and at the Eastern Invitationals in Tallahassee, Fla.
and in the process just missed
qualifying. Marshall, a talented
jumper with a 7-foot-4-and-one
half personal best, will compete in
a Jenner field that features three
other 7-4 or better jumpers. The
competition could push him
higher.

Another interesting facet of the
Jenner meet will be the presence
of a strong California squad. For
the first time in many years, the
Stanford coaching staff thinks the
Cardinal may have a shot at win
ning the Big Meet against the
Bears, to be held this year on May
2 at Stanford Stadium.
The meet will begin at 11:30
a.m. at San Jose City College.
