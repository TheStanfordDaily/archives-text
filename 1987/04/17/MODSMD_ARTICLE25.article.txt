# Stanford seeks final league playoff spot
## 
### ALICIA KENT Staff writer 
The UC-Santa Barbara Gauchos
and the Loyola-Marymount Lions
have the Stanford men's volleyball
team hanging by a wire. Hoping to
clinch the No. 5 position In the
Western Intercollegiate Volleyball
Association and thus gain entry
into the Western regionals, the
Cardinal needs to win one of its
two final league matches this
weekend.
Stanford will be forced to per
form well tonight at 7:30 at
Loyola, where It hopes to slay the
lowly Lions and gain the playoff
spot before visiting the powerful
Gauchos tomorrow night, again at
7:30.
Now 8-8 in the WIVA and 18-11
overall, the Cardinal is being
threatened Hawaii, which is 7-10
in the conference. The regionals
will be played at San Diego State
April 23 and 25, where the WIVA's
second thru fifth place teams will
battle for the fourth spot In the
NCAA championships, to be held
through May 1 and 2 at UCLA.
Loyola Is 1-15 in the WIVA, good
for last place in the conference.
Stanford Coach Fred Sturm said
he is "cautiously optimistic"
about a win over Loyola and a spot
in the regionals. On March 6. the
Cardinal's last confrontation with
Loyola, Stanford easily tamed the
Lions, 15-10, 15-7, 15-8.
UCSB, however, which is cur
rently No. 4 in the WIVA. will be a
definite obstacle for the Cardinal.
Coming off a win over No. 2 Pep
perdlne, the Gauchos are 12-5 in
the WIVA and 27-10 overall.
If tomorrow's match is like the

last Stanford-UCSB match on
January 29. when the Cardinal
lost 15-13, 15-11, 15-12, the team
may end the season feeling very
frustrated. Plagued with 31 hit
ting errors, 10 serving errors and
nine blocking errors in three
relatively short games, Stanford
felt that It had defeated itself.
With much improvement, a
changed lineup and several impor
tant matches behind it, Sturm
said he feels his team has
developed the skills to beat the
Gauchos. Whether Stanford can
put these skills to good use is an
other question.
UCSB will threaten the Cardinal
with a consistently strong de
fense. "They (UCSB) are on a roll,"
Sturm said. "They are very strong
defensively: they are a better
blocking team than they've been
in past years."
In addition to defense, Sturm
sees the powerful hitting and play
making as a Gaucho strength to
focus on. "They move the ball
around very well. When they can
set up their passes, they can run
their offense very well," Sturm
said.
Sturm attributes this strong of
fense to UCSB's setter, Jon
Wallace, a junior from Newport
Beach. Sturm said he has the abil
ity to mix up the plays and
confuse the Cardinal defense.
The theme for this weekend will
be quality and consistency, ac
cording to Sturm. To obtain its
berth to the regionals and to com
bat the Lions and the Gauchos,
the Cardinal will have to capitalize
on its own strengths. "If we do the
things we do well, then it will work
just fine," Sturm said.
