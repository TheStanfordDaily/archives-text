# Cardinal crews host big regatta
## 
### CHRIS CRADER Staff writer 
There are few things in college sports more excit
ing than the battle for a national championship and
the Stanford crew teams are hoping they've found
one.
The Redwood Shores-Stanford Rowing Classic has
as strong a field as any regatta in both the men's and
women's categories, and a unique round-robin for
mat.
The rowing begins today at 2 p.m.. with additional
sessions beginning at 9 a.m. and 3:15 tomorrow af
ternoon.
Three eastern schools and three western schools
are entered in each race, and each boat rows three
times with no overall winner determined.
On the men's side are defending national cham
pions Wisconsin. Intercollegiate Rowing Association
champion Brown, Dartmouth and the top three
schools from the West Coast last year — Washington.
Stanford and California.
On the women's side are Stanford. Cal and the top
four from last year's national championships — Wis
consin. Radcliffe. Washington and Princeton.
"I don't mind (the format)," said women's rower
Kristen Dahl. "It's hard, and you have to be able to
perform three times in 36 hours, but our bodies
should be able to recover."
Both Cardinal teams are coming off successful
showings at the San Diego Crew Classic two weeks
ago, where the women placed third and the men
sixth against tough competition. The men also
placed higher than Cal for the first time in 16 years.
Men's varsity captain Andy Rebele said he is
excited with the team's performance so far. "It wasn't
like they (Cal) had a weak year," he said. "They had a
strong race and we beat them."
Rebele said the team has improved greatly during
the last year and expects better results this year
based on the team's fast start. "If we do the same
things we did last year, we should go right through
people."
The women's boat may have trouble maintaining
its high position, however, as one of the varsity
rowers suffered a minor back injury, forcing a lineup
alteration for the weekend. Dahl said she thinks
things will work out, however.
"I think we'll do pretty well. I think we'll go faster as
time goes on."
Also competing for the Cardinal will be both men's
and women's junior varsity, one men's and two
women's freshmen boats and a men's novice boat.
Stanford is hoping to fare well over the weekend,
but both varsity boats are looking more for improve
ment in the long run than any short-run success.
With a few more small meets coming up to prepare,
the two teams are looking toward the Pacific 10
championships, and dethroning Washington.
Rebele said: "I think we should be within half a
length of Washington and Wisconsin. It's going to
depend on who pulls it out that day."
