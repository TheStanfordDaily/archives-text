# Two awarded Truman scholarships

Sophomores David Cline and Jonathan Wel
ner have been named Harry S. Truman
Scholars in recognition of their past public
service activities and plans for a future career
in public service.
The scholarship awards $6,500 per year for
four years to 104 college sophomores
nationwide to help subsidize their junior and
senior years and two years of graduate school.
To be eligible for a Truman scholarship, a
student must be "planning a career in public
service and have an established track record in
high school and college," Political Science Pro
fessor Emeritus Hubert Marshall said.

Fifteen to 20 Stanford students applied for
three University nominations this year, ac
cording to Marshall.
Compared to the approximately 800 colleges
and universities around the country that
nominate students for the scholarship, Stan
ford nominees have been extraordinarily suc
cessful, Marshall said.
Over the past seven years, 13 out of 14 Stan
ford nominees have received the scholarship.
Marshall said he was not sure if Stanford
has the best record in the country for produc
ing Truman scholars, "but it's better than Har
vard, Radcliffe, Yale . . . you know, the usual
list."
Applicants are frequently involved in com
munity service, and have worked for congres-

sional campaigns or have been congressional
interns, Marshall said. Most major in the so
cial sciences, he said, but added that, "we
sometimes get interesting mixes."
Cline, who plans on majoring in public
policy, was co-president of his high school's
service club and helped establish a shelter for
homeless men in his hometown of Bellvue,
Wash. At Stanford, he is involved with the
Stanford Democrats, Stanford-in-Government
and the Volunteer Network.
Welner, a transfer from Harvard who plans
to major in international relations and me
chanical engineering, spent the summer after
he graduated from high school lobbying
