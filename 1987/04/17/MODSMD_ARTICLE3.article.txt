# Two awarded Truman scholarships

### MONIQUE SCHEER Senior staff writer 
Sophomores David Cline and Jonathan Wel
ner have been named Harry S. Truman
Scholars in recognition of their past public
service activities and plans for a future career
in public service.
The scholarship awards $6,500 per year for
four years to 104 college sophomores
nationwide to help subsidize their junior and
senior years and two years of graduate school.
To be eligible for a Truman scholarship, a
student must be "planning a career in public
service and have an established track record in
high school and college," Political Science Pro
fessor Emeritus Hubert Marshall said.

Fifteen to 20 Stanford students applied for
three University nominations this year, ac
cording to Marshall.
Compared to the approximately 800 colleges
and universities around the country that
nominate students for the scholarship, Stan
ford nominees have been extraordinarily suc
cessful, Marshall said.
Over the past seven years, 13 out of 14 Stan
ford nominees have received the scholarship.
Marshall said he was not sure if Stanford
has the best record in the country for produc
ing Truman scholars, "but it's better than Har
vard, Radcliffe, Yale . . . you know, the usual
list."
Applicants are frequently involved in com
munity service, and have worked for congres-

sional campaigns or have been congressional
interns, Marshall said. Most major in the so
cial sciences, he said, but added that, "we
sometimes get interesting mixes."
Cline, who plans on majoring in public
policy, was co-president of his high school's
service club and helped establish a shelter for
homeless men in his hometown of Bellvue,
Wash. At Stanford, he is involved with the
Stanford Democrats, Stanford-in-Government
and the Volunteer Network.
Welner, a transfer from Harvard who plans
to major in international relations and me
chanical engineering, spent the summer after
he graduated from high school lobbying
Congress with regard to a defense
appropriations bill for the Relative
Action Center of American Hebrew
Congregations. He said he Is cur
rently "preoccupied with Poll Scl
138B," an arms control seminar.
Welner said he has been Inter
ested In arms control since high
school and described his position
on the issue as moderate. "I'm not
a dove or a liberal or anything," he
said.
Last summer, Welner worked
for the senate campaign of Harriet
Woods. The past few weeks, he
has been working on his own cam
paign for ASSU Senate.
Both Cline and Welner say they
may go into a graduate program In
public policy, but neither has a
specific job in mind yet.
On Monday of Big Game week
last November. Cline. who is on
the Axe Committee, received the
application, was due on Friday. "I
remember sitting out by the Boat
house, guarding the bonfire,
writing my essay," he said.

Applicants are required to write
a 600-word essay on a public
policy issue, domestic or interna
tional.
Cline wrote his essay on the sit
uation in Central America and
said the interview for the Stanford
nomination concentrated mostly
on it.
Welner said the most interest
ing parts of the application
process were the interviews.
"The Stanford interview was
kind of high-pressure, but really
no big deal," he said. The regional
interview in Kansas City, on the
other hand, was more rigorous.
"They really tried to put you on the
spot," Welner said.
Welner's essay was, in his own
words, "a description of the myths
behind the Strategic Defense Ini
tiative."
The scholarship is available only
to sophomores. Because freshman
year is "a time of confusion that
doesn't give (students) much of an
opportunity to get Involved," the
nominations committee at Stan
ford and the national organization
consider seriously the applicants'
high school activities, Marshall
said.
