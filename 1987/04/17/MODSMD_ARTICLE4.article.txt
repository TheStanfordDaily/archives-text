# Krupp internships: Germany up close

### LAURA REED 
Reflecting on his experiences
as an intern in Berlin, Jon Pal
mer said that one of the inci
dents that stood out in his
mind as particularly German
was a city hall beer night â€” an
exuberant celebration during
which dignified officials of the
conservative German Christian
Democratic Party let loose and
joyfully ate huge sausages,
threw bean bags at bowling
pins and got quite drunk.
Palmer, a senior, was one of
42 Stanford students who par
ticipated in the 1986 Krupp
Foundation Internship Pro
gram, an Integral part of the
Stanford-in-Berlin program.
The main goal of the program
is "to give students in-depth so
cial and professional experi
ence within the German cul
ture," according to Ken Kauf
man. director of development

in Europe for Overseas Studies.
Stanford-in-Berlin is the only
Stanford overseas center that
currently has an Internship
program in addition to aca
demic and cultural opportuni
ties.
The interns . study at the
Stanford-in-Berlin center dur
ing either autumn or winter
quarter, and then live on their
own, working in well-paying
jobs in various locations in Ger
many for three months.
Palmer, a political science
major, worked with the Chris
tian Democratic Party, one of
five political parties in Berlin.
"The internship was an op
portunity to learn about how
the government of Berlin
works, from the vantage point
of the conservative, traditional
majority party in their coalition
government," Palmer said.
