# Krupp internships: Germany up close
## 
### LAURA REED 
Reflecting on his experiences
as an intern in Berlin, Jon Pal
mer said that one of the inci
dents that stood out in his
mind as particularly German
was a city hall beer night — an
exuberant celebration during
which dignified officials of the
conservative German Christian
Democratic Party let loose and
joyfully ate huge sausages,
threw bean bags at bowling
pins and got quite drunk.
Palmer, a senior, was one of
42 Stanford students who par
ticipated in the 1986 Krupp
Foundation Internship Pro
gram, an Integral part of the
Stanford-in-Berlin program.
The main goal of the program
is "to give students in-depth so
cial and professional experi
ence within the German cul
ture," according to Ken Kauf
man. director of development

in Europe for Overseas Studies.
Stanford-in-Berlin is the only
Stanford overseas center that
currently has an Internship
program in addition to aca
demic and cultural opportuni
ties.
The interns . study at the
Stanford-in-Berlin center dur
ing either autumn or winter
quarter, and then live on their
own, working in well-paying
jobs in various locations in Ger
many for three months.
Palmer, a political science
major, worked with the Chris
tian Democratic Party, one of
five political parties in Berlin.
"The internship was an op
portunity to learn about how
the government of Berlin
works, from the vantage point
of the conservative, traditional
majority party in their coalition
government," Palmer said.
For Palmer. living and working
in a different environment was a
challenge, but also a benefit of his
Internship.
"You're forced to deal with living
In an environment you're not used
to with people you may not under
stand. and you have to deal with
working with Institutions that
have no American counterparts. 1
think everyone grew up a lot be
cause they had to learn to adjust,"
he explained.
Senior Alexandra Rankin
worked for Nlxdorf Computer for
nine months as part of a software
development team. "It was a very
close-knit, small group; the people
were all younger, and ultimately
they were just as much my friends
as my co-workers." she said.
"From the very beginning, they
were willing to accept me as a full
time, responsible worker. I was
given my own parts of a computer
program to be completely respon
sible for, which was nerve
wracking in the beginning, be
cause It was going to be sold," she
said.
For engineers In particular, the
Krupp internship program offers
a rare opportunity to stop and
reflect on where their lives are
going and to gain valuable experi
ence, without having to pay tui
tion.
"When I first went to Berlin. I
was caught in the Stanford engi
neering push — get your major,
end in four years and so forth."
Rankin said. "But after I got to
Berlin. I ended up staying six
months longer than I had
originally planned.
"The year gave me a great deal of
perspective on Stanford — before I
was having a lot of stress prob
lems about schoolwork, and wor
rying about what I was going to
do. Going there gave me a lot of
distance on that, " she said.
Steve Collins, who worked as a
computer programmer with Luf
thansa in Cologne, agreed that his
Internship helped him "get out of
the Stanford mentality."
Like many of the interns, Col
lins had to find housing by ren
ting with a German person he

'During my time in Berlin, I lived
with a woman who thought she
was a witch. She used to sit and
read Tarot cards in the night with
100 candles burning.'
- Steve Collins, Krupp intern

didn't know. He remembered his
landlady vividly.
"During my time in Berlin, I
lived with a woman who thought
she was a witch. She used to sit
and read Tarot cards in the night
with 100 candles burning," he
said.
Collins said the experience of
living with Europeans, as a
European, was the best thing
about the internship.
"If you're in Europe, not as a
tourist, but to work there, the
people treat you a lot differently.
The first thing you get is, 'Are you
a tourist, or a soldier?', and when
you say 'No, I'm working here,'
their whole attitude changes, and
they say 'Come, let me buy you a
beer, let's talk,' " he said.
Kira Sturney. a graduate stu
dent, worked with the broadcast
ing division of Berlin's main
media organization, Sender Freies
Berlin. She suggested that her su
pervisor do a story on Stanford
students in Berlin, and he gave
her full responsibility for produc
ing the program. She worked with
a film crew. Interviewed students
and program directors and wrote
the .script for the program.
Sturney said she felt an intern
ship with the media had particu
lar benefits. "Because of the na
ture of my internship, I really was
aware of what was going on in
"Berlin life at that moment." Stur
ney said.
"Every day, because I was in the
newsroom, I was in touch with
what was going on politically in
the city, and culturally too — I in
terviewed a French dancer who
came to Berlin, and we had free
tickets to her shows and to other
programs," she said.
All of the interns interviewed

agreed that they learned a consid
erable amount from their intern
ship experience that they would
not have learned had they only
studied in the Stanford-in-Berlin
program, or in any Stanford over
seas center.
According to Sturney: "With the
internships, you get to meet
people outside of an academic sit
uation. When I'd talk to the
workers over lunch or beers, I
wouldn't be listening to the chan
neled academic response of our
German professors, but the real
heart-and-gut German opinion.
"You can only learn so much
German in classrooms and order
ing in restaurants, whereas if
you're living with a German
woman who doesn't speak En
glish, and you have to think at
seven in the morning how to com
municate over Cheerios, and you
have to get to work and take direc
tions in German and explain your
problems In German, you really
learn fast," she said.
Graduate student Rick Altinger
worked with Borsig, a company
that designs and manufactures
heavy industrial equipment, and
used their computerized design
system to engineer parts of indus
trial compressors.
For Altinger, the most valuable
aspect of his experience was living
the life of a European instead of
viewing Europe from a tourist's
persectlve.
"I was, in a lot of senses, a Ber
liner. I lived there; I worked there.
I feel like I know what the average
German engineer's life Is like.
Only by settling down like that can
you really submerge yourself and
get to know the culture and ways
of thinking of another people," he
said.
