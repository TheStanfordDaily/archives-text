### DIANE BISGEIER Senior staff writer 
The Office of the Provost has re
quested additional funding for the
University Libraries System to al
leviate the effects of unexpected
price hikes in foreign journals and
serial publications.
According to Michael Ryan, col
lection development officer and
field curator for special collec
tions, the increased cost of foreign
materials, coupled with the recent
weakening of the dollar, has
"conspired to precipitate a critical
situation" for the system and has
forced it to seek additional fund
ing to maintain current pro
grams.
"Book prices, particularly those
from abroad, have jumped up
much more aggressively than we
had anticipated," said David
Weber, director of University Li
braries.
Set in December, the proposed
1987-88 University Libraries book
budget is approximately $4 mil
lion, a 9.2 percent increase over

this year's total.
Citing the recent price increases
and devaluation of the dollar, the
Office of the Provost last week pro
posed that an addition of
$275,000 to the book budget be
considered by the University
Board of Trustees in the "June
revisions process" in order to
maintain the current acquisition
program.
"We're watching it to make sure
our acquistions program is not
significanly weakened due to the
changing circumstances," said
University Provost James Rosse.
"If current trends continue,
then we may be in a tight situa
tion," Ryan said.
An additional $200,000 to
$300,000 will also be added from
reserves carried over from last
year, said Weber, who added that
he hopes that the additional fund
ing will enable the library system
to "come very close to maintaining
almost as healthy a program as we
previously had."
