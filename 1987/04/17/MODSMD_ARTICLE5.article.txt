# Library funding to recieve boost
## 
### DIANE BISGEIER Senior staff writer 
The Office of the Provost has re
quested additional funding for the
University Libraries System to al
leviate the effects of unexpected
price hikes in foreign journals and
serial publications.
According to Michael Ryan, col
lection development officer and
field curator for special collec
tions, the increased cost of foreign
materials, coupled with the recent
weakening of the dollar, has
"conspired to precipitate a critical
situation" for the system and has
forced it to seek additional fund
ing to maintain current pro
grams.
"Book prices, particularly those
from abroad, have jumped up
much more aggressively than we
had anticipated," said David
Weber, director of University Li
braries.
Set in December, the proposed
1987-88 University Libraries book
budget is approximately $4 mil
lion, a 9.2 percent increase over

this year's total.
Citing the recent price increases
and devaluation of the dollar, the
Office of the Provost last week pro
posed that an addition of
$275,000 to the book budget be
considered by the University
Board of Trustees in the "June
revisions process" in order to
maintain the current acquisition
program.
"We're watching it to make sure
our acquistions program is not
significanly weakened due to the
changing circumstances," said
University Provost James Rosse.
"If current trends continue,
then we may be in a tight situa
tion," Ryan said.
An additional $200,000 to
$300,000 will also be added from
reserves carried over from last
year, said Weber, who added that
he hopes that the additional fund
ing will enable the library system
to "come very close to maintaining
almost as healthy a program as we
previously had."
In addition to the University
system, other Stanford libraries,
such as the Hoover Institution Li
brary. are also suffering from In
creased acquisition costs.
The Hoover Library, along with
the medical, business and law li
braries. is not a part of the library
system. Hoover has made cuts in
its Japanese and East European
acquisitions budgets as a result of
the Increasing journal costs.
"Our East European budget has
already been spent, and we're
already not ordering any Japanese
books," said Charles Palm, head
librarian and archivist at Hoover.
"I would say that this has been the
mo3t severe situation in the last
10 years.
"Sixty percent of our budget has
been lost as a result of our
Japanese acquisitions fund,"
Palm said. "I don't think we'll ever
be able to undo the damage that
has been caused unless we're able
to raise funds through donations
or through the University."
Both Palm and Ryan see the
problems at Stanford as part of a
national trend In university libra
ries. "There's been a general trend
in this direction which has af
fected some libraries earlier than
Stanford," Ryan said.
