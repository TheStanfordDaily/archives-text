# $3.9 million dispute
## Farm seeks trial in telephone suit 
### CLINT HIGHFILL Staff writer 
University lawyers filed briefs
this month with the California
Court of Appeals contending that
a dispute over a $3.9 million con
struction bill should be resolved in
court rather than in arbitration.
VoTT IhforTriatfon Systems,
which helped construct the $20.8
million campus phone system,
contracted with the University in
1984 to install — for $1.3 million
— about one-third of the under
ground tubing that carries the
phone system's cables. The
tubing, now fully installed and
functioning, has cost the Univer
sity approximately $3.7 million.
Volt billed the University for an
additional $3.9 million in April
1986 because it had to replace
much of the conduits after the ini
tial installation. "Numerous acts
and omissions on the part of Stan
ford and its representatives
delayed, disrupted and interfered
with Volt's performance, and sig
nificantly increased the cost of
and time required for completion
of its work," a Volt legal brief says.
Last August, the University
refused to pay Volt any amount

above the contracted price.
The magnitude of the disagree
ment is extraordinary, said Ed
mundo Moran, associate staff
counsel for University Legal Af
fairs. Moran said that while
disputes between construction
contractors and the University are
not uncommon, the claims han
dled by thfTJniversitv Affairs
Office usually fall in the $ 10,000
to $20,000 range.
The contested issues are:
□ Who is responsible for Volt
having to replace its original
work?
□ What process should be used to
determine that responsibility?
The latter question was an
swered in November by a Califor
nia Superior Court judge who
ruled that Stanford and Volt
should resolve their differences in
court.
Volt appealed the ruling in De
cember, and a ruling from the Cal
ifornia Court of Appeals is ex
pected before the end of the sum
mer, according to Lynn Pasahow,
an attorney for the San Francisco
firm of McCutchen, Doyle, Brown
& Enersen, which is retained by
Stanford.
Addressing the issue of respon
sibility, the Stanford brief con
tends that either Volt was at fault
or "the corrective work was neces
sary because construction draw
ings and project management pro
vided to Stanford by defendants
Brlan-Kangas-Foulk & Associates
and Telecommunications Interna
tional. Inc. (Til) were Inadequate
or improper."
Volt contends that Stanford Is
liable in any case because the Uni
versity owns the property on
which the project was con
structed.
To settle the dispute. Volt calls
for arbitration, involving only
Stanford and Volt, as provided for
in the original Stanford-Volt con
tract.
Stanford fears a two-step
scenario could thrust the cost of
settling with Volt upon the Univer
sity.
As the University's brief to the
Appeals Court says, "If Stanford
were forced to arbitrate Volt's
claims alone before an arbitrator,
the arbitration could result in a
determination that Til and [Brlan-
Kangas-Foulk] drawings or Til's
project management were inade
quate, and [make] an award for

Volt. If Stanford then were forced
separately to litigate Its indemnity
claims against Til and [Brian-
Kangas-Foulk) In court. Til and
IBrian-Kangas-Foulk] might not
be bound by the arbitrator's
award. A court or jury could find
that their drawings were ade
quate. and deny indemnity.
"The Superior Court was the
only forum In which Stanford's
claims against Volt, Til and Brian-
Kangas-Foulk all could be resolved
at the same time and place."
Volt's attorneys, challenging the
lower-court decision, contend that
the Federal Arbitration Act
governs the arbitratability of all
disputes involving interstate com
merce.
Volt is headquartered in New
York state.
Stanford's response submitted
to-the Appeals Court maintains
that both parties agreed the con
tract would be governed by Cali
fornia law and argues that the act
does not forbid the court from
honoring that agreement.
Given the U.S. Supreme Court's
recent interest in arbitration is
sues, the matter could theoreti
cally reach the U.S. Supreme
Court, according to Pasahow.
"It is an area that continues to
have some uncertainty as to some
of its parameters, so it is the kind
of case the Supreme Court might
take to resolve those uncertain
ties," Pasahow said.
