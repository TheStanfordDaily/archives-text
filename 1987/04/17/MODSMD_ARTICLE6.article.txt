# $3.9 million dispute
## Farm seeks trial in telephone suit 
### CLINT HIGHFILL Staff writer 
University lawyers filed briefs
this month with the California
Court of Appeals contending that
a dispute over a $3.9 million con
struction bill should be resolved in
court rather than in arbitration.
VoTT IhforTriatfon Systems,
which helped construct the $20.8
million campus phone system,
contracted with the University in
1984 to install — for $1.3 million
— about one-third of the under
ground tubing that carries the
phone system's cables. The
tubing, now fully installed and
functioning, has cost the Univer
sity approximately $3.7 million.
Volt billed the University for an
additional $3.9 million in April
1986 because it had to replace
much of the conduits after the ini
tial installation. "Numerous acts
and omissions on the part of Stan
ford and its representatives
delayed, disrupted and interfered
with Volt's performance, and sig
nificantly increased the cost of
and time required for completion
of its work," a Volt legal brief says.
Last August, the University
refused to pay Volt any amount

above the contracted price.
The magnitude of the disagree
ment is extraordinary, said Ed
mundo Moran, associate staff
counsel for University Legal Af
fairs. Moran said that while
disputes between construction
contractors and the University are
not uncommon, the claims han
dled by thfTJniversitv Affairs
Office usually fall in the $ 10,000
to $20,000 range.
The contested issues are:
□ Who is responsible for Volt
having to replace its original
work?
□ What process should be used to
determine that responsibility?
The latter question was an
swered in November by a Califor
nia Superior Court judge who
ruled that Stanford and Volt
should resolve their differences in
court.
Volt appealed the ruling in De
cember, and a ruling from the Cal
ifornia Court of Appeals is ex
pected before the end of the sum
mer, according to Lynn Pasahow,
an attorney for the San Francisco
firm of McCutchen, Doyle, Brown
