The complexity of organisms on Earth suggests
"supernatural intervention." said author Norman
Geisler last night in a lecture entitled "Does God Ex
ist: The Scientific Evidence."
"To believe that life arose from purely natural
causes is like believing that Webster's dictionary was
a result of an explosion in a printing shop," Geisler
said.
Geisler, speaking to an audience of about 300 in
Cubberley Auditorium, cited the works of noted sci
entists such as Darwin, Newton and Einstein to dis
cuss the problems surrounding theories on the birth
of the universe and the origins of life.
He said astronomers' attempts to explain the birth
of the universe, especially the "Big Bang" theory,
added support to creationist views.
"In science, as in the Bible, the world begins with
an act of creation, a sudden flash of light," he said.
Scientists have used reason to get to a point where
"theologians have been sitting all along," he added.
Geisler used science's "Principle of Causality" to
argue that logic leads to conclusions of the necessary
existence of a supernatural being.
This principle, which says that an "adequate
cause" is needed for any event to take place, negates
a "something from nothing" view on the birth of the
universe, he said.
Geisler then turned to arguments surrounding the

origin of life, concluding that the
complexity of organisms was
much too profound to attribute to
"random chance."
Using analogies between
natural-occurring phenomena
and those that occur due to intelli

gent intervention, Geisler con
cluded that the vast complexity of
even single-celled animals made it
very unlikely that their origin was
a result of chance.
"When one reads 'Drink Coke'
written in skywriting, the first re
action is not to blame it on the
wind," he said.
He argued that some kind of in
telligence is necessary for order to

exist. "The dictionary only has the
26 letters of the alphabet in it,"he
said, "but it takes intelligence to
arrange them in a specific way."
Geisler also attacked the evolu
tionist notion of the "primordial
soup" theory of the origin of life.
He said no scientific evidence sup
ports this theory, which post
ulates that the first life could have
arisen from complex chemical

mixtures.
"No laboratory in the world has
ever produced a living thing, even
with intelligent intervention,
much less without it,"he said.
After the lecture, which was
sponsored by Campus Crusade for
Christ, Geisler answered the ques
tions from the audience, most of
which was hostile to his views.
