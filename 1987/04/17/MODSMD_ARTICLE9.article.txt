NATO will study Soviet proposal
BRUSSELS. Belgium — NATO foreign ministers agreed yester
day to launch an immediate study of the new offer to eliminate
European-based missiles brought from Moscow by Secretary of
State George Shultz, amid indications that the alliance will accept
the offer in about three weeks.
In his appearance this morning before the North Atlantic Coun
cil, the alliance's governing body, Shultz did not formally endorse
acceptance of the Soviet offer to eliminate shorter-range nuclear
missiles — of the kind which only the Soviets have deployed —
after an agreement is reached to eliminate the intermediate-range
nuclear weapons in Europe of both superpowers.
The intermediate weapons have a range of 600 to 3,000 miles
while the shorter range Soviet weapons have a range between 300
and 600 miles.
Instead, Shultz took the position that the decision must come
later through "a systematic and careful process" of consultations.
There was no doubt, though, from reports of Shultz's confiden
tial remarks to his fellow ministers and his statements at a press
conference that the Reagan administration is lobbying for accep
tance of the Soviet offer, which Shultz described as "a great oppor
tunity for the alliance."
Fed could be causing recession
WASHINGTON — The Federal Reserve Board is in danger of
tightening interest rates too much and plunging the nation Into a
recession next year, budget director James Miller said yesterday
in blunt remarks that could set off a major Reagan administration
dispute with Fed Chairman Paul Volcker.
"Our greatest danger is overreact ion," Miller told a breakfast
meeting with reporters. The chances are only one in 10 that the
nation will suffer an economic downturn next year, Miller said,
but "we can surely bring it on" through mistakes in policy.
If the Fed restricts the supply of money excessively and rapidly
drives up Interest rates, he added, "we could be in a substantial
recession a year from now."
Seven times during an hour of questions and answers. Miller
warned against "overreaction" by Volcker and the other Federal
Reserve Board policy-makers, who are grappling with a resur
gence of inflation. Although prices are rising faster than last year,
he stressed, there is no cause for panic.
Most economists expect the cost of living to increase between 4
and 5 percent this year, far above the miniscule rate of 1.1 percent
during 1986. Last year's inflation level, the lowest In 23 years, was
caused by an extraordinary plunge in oil prices.
Gorbachev assails party officials
MOSCOW — Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev acknowledged
yesterday that high-level Communist Party officials are slowing
his programs designed to revitalize Soviet life.
But he Insisted that there is no organized political opposition to
him or his attempts to bring greater efficiency and more candor
into the economy and government.
Speaking to 5,000 delegates to the 20th congress of the Kom
somol, or Young Communist League, Gorbachev said that the na
tion already has traveled a long way on the road to renewal.
"The past period was not easy, but it was fruitful," he said of the
two years since he assumed office in March 1985.
But he said that there have been difficulties as well, adding:
"The machinery of braking (the proposed change) existed not by
itself. There are concrete personalities Involved In that machinery
at the level of the Central Committee (of the party) and govern
ment, in the ministries, republics and regions. They are in work
collectives and even in the Komsomol."
Since he came to power after the death of Konstantin Cher
nenko. Gorbachev has presided over a purge of aging and corrupt
officials at all levels in Soviet life.
FCC alters definition of obscenity
WASHINGTON — The Federal Communications Commission
yesterday adopted sweeping new restrictions on the broadcast of
obscene and offensive material, warning radio and television sta
tion owners that they risk fines or loss of their licenses if they
broadcast sexually explicit language or song lyrics.
The warning significantly changes the FCC's 11-year-old hands
off policy on "indecent" material broadcast over the airwaves. Pre
viously, the commission limited its actions against such language
to the "seven dirty words" made famous by comedian George Car
lin.
But under yesterday's rulings, the commission said it will take
enforcement actions against snows that contain explicit, offensive
descriptions of sexual or excretory activities — even If the shows
do not contain the seven famous dirty words. Enforcement ac
tions range from fines of *2,000 a day for each offense to revoca
tion of a broadcaster's license to operate.
Controversy in cancer research
WASHINGTON — Survival rates for the leading forms of cancer
have improved during the nation's generation-long war against
the disease, but much of the improvement has resulted from ear
lier detection and more accurate diagnoses rather than better
therapies, according to a major study by the General Accounting
Office released yesterday.
In studying the treatment of the 12 most common types of can
cers from 1950 to 1982, the report said that nearly all the cases it
monitored showed significant progress. However, much of the
success was attributed to preventive measures, not treatment
breakthroughs — a point that led to charges that the medical
community has exaggerated claims In fighting the disease.
The report by the GAO, Congress' investigative agency, focused
on cancers of the lung, breast, colon, rectum, bladder, stomach,
cervix, uterus, prostate and head and neck, as well as leukemia
and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.
The study said that a combination of earlier cancer detection
and better therapies had resulted In varying improvements In the
number of patients surviving their disease, with the most signifi
cant changes recorded in treatment of leukemia and lymphomas
and far less progress in many forms of lung and stomach cancer.
Seizure of Hart campaign fund
LOS ANGELES — U.S. marshals seized thousands of dollars
from Gary Hart's Los Angeles fund-raising parties to try to satisfy
a court order to pay outstanding campaign debts.
Sounding irritated but expressing no embarrassment as a
result of the crashing of his two parties Wednesday night. Hart
said at a press conference yesterday that the matter was
"apparently a legal misunderstanding." He insisted that creditors
from his last presidential campaign have no legal right to money
raised for his 1988 run.
"I think whoever was proceeding in this direction was misin
formed." he said.
The Santa Barbara-based advertising company of Semper-
Moser Associates took the attention-getting step of sending
plainclothes marshals to the back-to-back Hart events to try and
satisfy a •162,754.57 judgement the company won in U.S. Dis
trict Court last December against Hart's 1984 campaign commit
tee.
Semper-Moser attorney Besty Lehrfeld, In Washington, said
that the marshals impounded •29,512.50 in cash and checks at
the two events Wednesday night.

The study said that a combination of earlier cancer detection
and better therapies had resulted In varying improvements In the
number of patients surviving their disease, with the most signifi
cant changes recorded in treatment of leukemia and lymphomas
and far less progress in many forms of lung and stomach cancer.
Seizure of Hart campaign fund
LOS ANGELES — U.S. marshals seized thousands of dollars
from Gary Hart's Los Angeles fund-raising parties to try to satisfy
a court order to pay outstanding campaign debts.
Sounding irritated but expressing no embarrassment as a
result of the crashing of his two parties Wednesday night. Hart
said at a press conference yesterday that the matter was
"apparently a legal misunderstanding." He insisted that creditors
from his last presidential campaign have no legal right to money
raised for his 1988 run.
"I think whoever was proceeding in this direction was misin
formed." he said.
The Santa Barbara-based advertising company of Semper-
Moser Associates took the attention-getting step of sending
plainclothes marshals to the back-to-back Hart events to try and
satisfy a •162,754.57 judgement the company won in U.S. Dis
trict Court last December against Hart's 1984 campaign commit
tee.
Semper-Moser attorney Besty Lehrfeld, In Washington, said
that the marshals impounded •29,512.50 in cash and checks at
the two events Wednesday night.

NATO will study Soviet proposal
BRUSSELS. Belgium — NATO foreign ministers agreed yester
day to launch an immediate study of the new offer to eliminate
European-based missiles brought from Moscow by Secretary of
State George Shultz, amid indications that the alliance will accept
the offer in about three weeks.
In his appearance this morning before the North Atlantic Coun
cil, the alliance's governing body, Shultz did not formally endorse
acceptance of the Soviet offer to eliminate shorter-range nuclear
missiles — of the kind which only the Soviets have deployed —
after an agreement is reached to eliminate the intermediate-range
nuclear weapons in Europe of both superpowers.
The intermediate weapons have a range of 600 to 3,000 miles
while the shorter range Soviet weapons have a range between 300
and 600 miles.
Instead, Shultz took the position that the decision must come
later through "a systematic and careful process" of consultations.
There was no doubt, though, from reports of Shultz's confiden
tial remarks to his fellow ministers and his statements at a press
conference that the Reagan administration is lobbying for accep
tance of the Soviet offer, which Shultz described as "a great oppor
tunity for the alliance."
Fed could be causing recession
WASHINGTON — The Federal Reserve Board is in danger of
tightening interest rates too much and plunging the nation Into a
recession next year, budget director James Miller said yesterday
in blunt remarks that could set off a major Reagan administration
dispute with Fed Chairman Paul Volcker.
"Our greatest danger is overreact ion," Miller told a breakfast
meeting with reporters. The chances are only one in 10 that the
nation will suffer an economic downturn next year, Miller said,
but "we can surely bring it on" through mistakes in policy.
If the Fed restricts the supply of money excessively and rapidly
drives up Interest rates, he added, "we could be in a substantial
recession a year from now."
Seven times during an hour of questions and answers. Miller
warned against "overreaction" by Volcker and the other Federal
Reserve Board policy-makers, who are grappling with a resur
gence of inflation. Although prices are rising faster than last year,
he stressed, there is no cause for panic.
Most economists expect the cost of living to increase between 4
and 5 percent this year, far above the miniscule rate of 1.1 percent
during 1986. Last year's inflation level, the lowest In 23 years, was
caused by an extraordinary plunge in oil prices.
Gorbachev assails party officials
MOSCOW — Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev acknowledged
yesterday that high-level Communist Party officials are slowing
his programs designed to revitalize Soviet life.
But he Insisted that there is no organized political opposition to
him or his attempts to bring greater efficiency and more candor
into the economy and government.
Speaking to 5,000 delegates to the 20th congress of the Kom
somol, or Young Communist League, Gorbachev said that the na
tion already has traveled a long way on the road to renewal.
"The past period was not easy, but it was fruitful," he said of the
two years since he assumed office in March 1985.
But he said that there have been difficulties as well, adding:
"The machinery of braking (the proposed change) existed not by
itself. There are concrete personalities Involved In that machinery
at the level of the Central Committee (of the party) and govern
ment, in the ministries, republics and regions. They are in work
collectives and even in the Komsomol."
Since he came to power after the death of Konstantin Cher
nenko. Gorbachev has presided over a purge of aging and corrupt
officials at all levels in Soviet life.
FCC alters definition of obscenity
WASHINGTON — The Federal Communications Commission
yesterday adopted sweeping new restrictions on the broadcast of
obscene and offensive material, warning radio and television sta
tion owners that they risk fines or loss of their licenses if they
broadcast sexually explicit language or song lyrics.
The warning significantly changes the FCC's 11-year-old hands
off policy on "indecent" material broadcast over the airwaves. Pre
viously, the commission limited its actions against such language
to the "seven dirty words" made famous by comedian George Car
lin.
But under yesterday's rulings, the commission said it will take
enforcement actions against snows that contain explicit, offensive
descriptions of sexual or excretory activities — even If the shows
do not contain the seven famous dirty words. Enforcement ac
tions range from fines of *2,000 a day for each offense to revoca
tion of a broadcaster's license to operate.
Controversy in cancer research
WASHINGTON — Survival rates for the leading forms of cancer
have improved during the nation's generation-long war against
the disease, but much of the improvement has resulted from ear
lier detection and more accurate diagnoses rather than better
therapies, according to a major study by the General Accounting
Office released yesterday.
In studying the treatment of the 12 most common types of can
cers from 1950 to 1982, the report said that nearly all the cases it
monitored showed significant progress. However, much of the
success was attributed to preventive measures, not treatment
breakthroughs — a point that led to charges that the medical
community has exaggerated claims In fighting the disease.
The report by the GAO, Congress' investigative agency, focused
on cancers of the lung, breast, colon, rectum, bladder, stomach,
cervix, uterus, prostate and head and neck, as well as leukemia
and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.
The study said that a combination of earlier cancer detection
and better therapies had resulted In varying improvements In the
number of patients surviving their disease, with the most signifi
cant changes recorded in treatment of leukemia and lymphomas
and far less progress in many forms of lung and stomach cancer.
