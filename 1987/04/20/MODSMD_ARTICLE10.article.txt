# Zschau encourages private sector

### DIANE BISGEIER Senior staff writer 
Ed Zschau, former Republican representa
tive from California's 12th district, stressed
the need for members of the private sector to
become involved in the political process in a
speech Friday in Bishop Auditorium.
"We need more business people in govern
ment who understand how the world works,"
said Zschau, the former president of Systems
Industries Corp. who ran unsuccessfully
against California Democratic Sen. Alan
Cranston in last year's senatorial election.
Zschau said he became disillusioned at cer
tain points in the campaign. "I would have felt
better about it if every step of the way I could
have talked about things in a way that was
me," he said. He attributed much of the prob
lem to the effects of public opinion polls,
noting that "when you're behind it's difficult to
raise money."
He explained that the media often forced
him to take a "more negative approach" in the
campaign. "A speech on how to improve educa
tion often doesn't make the headlines, but a
biting remark about your opponent often
does," he said.
Despite his 1986 loss, Zschau says he plans
to give the Senate another try. "I've developed
an enormous faith in our future and an op
timism in our system." he said.

After graduating from Princeton in 1963 and
receiving an MBA and a Ph.D. from Stanford.
Zschau served on the Stanford faculty. In 1969
he founded Systems Industries, a high-tech
firm, and as a result became interested in
venture capital legislation.
"During the 1970s there was a real scarcity
of venture capital." Zschau said. "I was asked
to chair a task force on capital formation and 1
concluded that the single most important
problem was the capital gains tax."
Zschau testified before Congress in 1977 on
the negative aspects of the tax. In March 1978,
he helped U.S. Rep. Bill Steiger draft the In
vestment Incentive Act, which President
Carter signed into law eight months later as
the Steiger Amendment.
"I concluded from that experience that we
need more business people in government
with personal experience," Zschau said. "I
decided in early 1981 that I would run for the
House in this district."
Zschau sees an "enormous vacuum for lead
ership" within the U.S. government. He told
the audience of about 150 that he was able to
draft legislation for an international trades
subcommittee to which he did not belong
simply by attending the meetings.
"People who have real world experience can
make a difference," he said.
Zschau said that one of the largest draw
backs to our political system is partisanship.

"The Idea is to create the situation where if
things go good you get credit, but if they don't
the other party gets the blame, and this re
quires an enormous amount of energy." he
said. "It can be very counterproductive."
In order to solve that problem. Zschau said
we must answer the question, "How do we
create within a democracy an environment In
which officials are focused on what should be
done rather than on getting re-elected?
"You've got to be yourself and let the chips
fall where they may." he said, adding that he
thought that the media should be prevented
from publishing opinion poll results in the last
few weeks of an election.
Currently, Zschau chairs a task force on in
ternational competitiveness. "The focus of our
activities is to provide an intellectual founda
tion for discussing this Issue," he said.
"Whenever you have a hot political topic like
this, a lot of dumb ideas are proposed. Our
purpose Is to gain agreement of the facts and
factors that affect competitiveness, and em
phasize that the responsibility for being com
petitive is not the government's but that of
American business."
Zschau sees the government's role in compe
tition as one of providing "an environment in
which the private sector can be competitive.
Fiscal, monetary, education and environmen
tal policy all determine whether there's going
to be a government that stimulates or impedes
an environment for competition."
