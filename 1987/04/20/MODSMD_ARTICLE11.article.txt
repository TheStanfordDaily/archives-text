### SUHA JHAVERI Staff writer 
A new sorority. Gamma Phi
Beta, hopes this spring to join
the six sororities that are cur
rently members of the Inter-
Sorority Council.
The movement to reinstate
the Mu chapter of Gamma Phi
Beta, which has been absent
from Stanford since being dis
solved in the all-sorority ban of
1944. Is being led by junior
Linda Sonne.
"I thought that it would be a
good idea to have another
sorority with Rush the way it
is. Things are just getting too
tight," Sonne said.
Fraternal Affairs Adviser Joe
Pisano said he endorsed the
sorority because he felt that
there is a "statistical need" for
sororities on campus.
Gamma Phi Beta, the oldest
sorority in the country, is pres
ently an interest group at Stan

ford. consisting of five mem
bers. After expected approval
and recognition from acting
Dean of Student Affairs Norm
Robinson, the sorority will be
able to hold an informal Rush.
Sonne is unsure how large
Gamma Phi Beta will be or
whether the sorority will hold a
selective Rush.
Elisabeth Holcomb, collegiate
consultant for Gamma Phi Beta
at Stanford, said she felt there
was a need for a sorority "with
no set reputation. We'd just be
a labeled a new sorority.' "
Holcomb added that Gamma
Phi Beta wanted to return to
the Stanford campus because
"six sororities (weren't)
enough. Last year 50 women
didn't get bids."
Sonne said she hopes to hold
the first Informal Rush party
tomorrow at 5 p.m. in the
Adams House lounge. All Inter
ested women are invited to at
tend.
