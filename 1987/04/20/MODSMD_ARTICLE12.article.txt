## THE
						STANFORD DAILY An Independent Newspaper Proposal is absurd 
### 
The long-awaited report from the Western
Culture Task Force was released last week,
and its recommendations are unequivocally
disappointing. The suggestion that the Area
One distribution requirement be turned into
a study of diverse cultures is politically prag
matic, but educationally bankrupt.
The task force seeks to establish a three
quarter course that would examine one West
ern and at least one non-Western culture.
This approach threatens to create an
anthropological survey course in which
freshmen would learn the historical facts
about various cultures. The resulting pro
gram would more closely resemble a seventh
grade social studies course than the founda
tion of a Stanford liberal education. The
strength of the Area One requirement is that
it does not focus on memorization, but
teaches complex ideas and the skills to
analyze them critically. The title "Western
Culture" is somewhat of a misnomer — none
of the tracks aims to teach the details of
European civilization. The tracks attempt to
teach students how to think. This basic
value of the Area One requirement seems to
have been lost on the task force.
The task force also ignores the most com
mon complaint about the present Area One
courses — tracks already try to cover too
much material in three short quarters. If an
other culture is added to the syllabus, what
will be removed? The works of Aristotle,

Plato, Locke, Marx or Freud?
Stanford students should be exposed to a
variety of cultural traditions before they
graduate, and that is precisely why the non-
Western distribution requirement exists.
Shortcomings in courses that fulfill that re
quirement are evident, but the problems
should be redressed within the confines of
the non-Western requirment rather than
through Area One.
One of the Western Culture program's
greatest assets is the faculty that teaches in
the tracks. The new criteria would force pro
fessors schooled in the Western tradition to
teach subjects completely beyond their realm
of knowledge. While Stanford could and
would find someone to teach these courses,
it is unlikely the teachers would be tenured
faculty. If faculty members aren't excited
about the Area One requirement, it could
become a ghetto for unproven junior faculty
who lack seniority.
The Western Culture program is far from
perfect. Changes should be made to address
more fully the impact of women and
minorities on Western culture. And other
cultures should be studied, in so far as they
had an effect on the development of Western
culture. But the changes that are needed
should be made within the existing
framework, not by throwing a successful pro
gram out the window and starting from
scratch.
