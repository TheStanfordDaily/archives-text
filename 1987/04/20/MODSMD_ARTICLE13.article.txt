Stanford, has
a gold mine
in languages
You may not realize it, but our
university has gold mines — not
literally, of course, but even more
valuable.
They are the multilingual
groups at the University. Stan
ford attracts students and teach
ers from around the globe and
they learn and teach such lan
guages as Hausa, Norwegian,
Irish, Tibetan, Korean, Greek and
Indonesian. These and many
other lesser-known languages are
not departments unto them
selves, such as German. French
or Russian. Rather, classes in
these languages are all offered
through the Linguistics Depart
ment's Special Languages Pro
gram.
Guests from foreign countries,
professors at Stanford and occa
sionally a trained student take up
the chfdlenge and have, needless
to say, the courage to teach these
courses. Students have benefited
enormously; students of first- or
second-generation parents have
been able to approach their heri
tage, students curious without
bound have been able to explore
their language of interest and
students with special require
ments for graduation have been
able to meet them.
In these classes, all the stu
dents share one thing: The lan
guage has always been the center
of their attention, not the course

or the grade. Teachers, too, have
benefited: they have been able to
systematize the learning of these
languages, establish educational
methodology and write textbooks.
Teachers have improved their
texts and materials and have
received an enormous sense of
gratification in keeping their
particular language alive and of
interest to others.
Yet why are languages more
valuable than gold mines? Lan
guage is a singular achievement
of all people. Each language is an
elaborate, consistent, subtle en
tity created from naught by the
genius of our ancestors. It brings
together a people's landscape,
history, attitudes and nuances —
all in one finite collection of sym
bols and sounds tied together in
rules — and, invariably, in excep
tions to those rules. Besides
being of practical use to
academics concerned with Etrus
can or Basque, languages are real
bridges between people. Once
learned, a language is the com
mon property of all its speakers.
Distinctions between
nationalities don't blur but blend.*
Stanford has been following a
path of reducing the Special Lan
guages Program, As a result,
fewer classes are being offered
and fewer teachers are being
attracted. This pattern, along
with more cuts, is to be finalized
in a meeting being convened by
Dean of Undergraduate Studies
Carolyn Lougee. If this trend
continues, the University and the
students will suffer. With the
diversity of the student body and
the varied expertise of the pro-

gram's teachers, the University
should not undercut such a pow
erful source of creativity.

That the Reagan Library in the
Stanford foothills is here to stay
is a matter of record. Except for a
few details, the agreements have
been signed. The University
Board of Trustees and other ad
ministrative and community
officials have spoken. The library
is history.
Can we now get on with other,
more important matters?
One of these may be of some
interest. Recently, an architect
friend and I, walking in the lower
foothills, discovered between two
low-lying ridges, a natural, fern
carpeted basin, shielded on all
sides by either hills or eucalyptus
trees or both.
From what we could tell, the
area has been seen by very few
and is of no apparent use. My
friend, who is from Washington,
D.C., made a few rough calcula
tions and realized that the loca
tion might meet specifications for
the Richard M. Nixon Presidential
Library.
Completely out of sight, it could
serve Stanford scholars in crimi
nal law as a running area and a
vital historical archive both.
