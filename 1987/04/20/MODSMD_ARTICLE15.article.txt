The long-awaited Western Culture Task Force
Report is here, and it reeks.
I wasn't sure what to expect from the onset, but
considering the people on the committee, let me just
say that I'm disappointed. The report features a lack
of reasoning that is appalling. If implemented, the
results would be disastrous.

For starters, the main focus of our beloved Area
One would be changed to the "study of diverse
cultures." Tracks will study non-European culture,
include primary texts by women and minorities and
abolish the core list of readings. The task force even
came up with a new name for the Area One require
ment — "Cultures, Ideas and Values." Cute, huh?
"The objectives of the Area One requirement are to
broaden students' understanding of different
cultures, cultural diversity and the processes of cul
tural interaction. The liberal education of Stanford
undergraduates should include the study of the cul
tural diversity that has become the heritage of us
all." So says the task force's report.
What was the reaction to this "broadening of the
program's parameters." as it was described in a
recent article (Daily, April 15)? Thankfully, and
rightfully, many professors have reacted with
feelings ranging from amazement to outrage. En
glish Prof. Ronald Rebholz said one would need to be
a "cultural anthropologist" to teach this course. En
glish Prof. William Chace echoed this sentiment —
"Who is going to teach this course?" he asked. I don't
know about you but I get damn scared when I hear
persons of the stature of Chace and Rebholz ques
tioning their ability to teach a course.
So what is it that scares them? The report just
says that it wants to "prepare students to be active
members ... in the global community" and to
"escape the blinders of provincialism." You want to
escape the blinders of provincialism, don't you?
I think the biggest problem is the elimination of
the core list of readings. Whether you argue that this
action "breaks with a 2,500-year intellectual tradi
tion," as English Prof. Herbert Lindenberger did, or
that the core list "gives students something to talk
about besides the weather," as Rebholz said, the
move just doesn't make sense. In this incredibly
diverse setting, where students from Idaho major in
art and students from Kenya major in electrical engi
neering, the differences can be overwhelming. At
least with the core selections there is a starting
point, a link, a common ground on which everyone
can stand. The student from Idaho and the student
from Kenya have both read Plato, both seen David's
Michelangelo and have both heard a Beethoven sym

phony. Both knew that we didn't just wake up one
day with a nuclear arms race and a health epidemic.
But listen to the argument of Assoc. History Prof.
Clay Carson: "It's how we respond to a work that
makes it great. When people read Wollstencraft, for
example, they learn about Rousseau. People can
learn about Marx as he is seen and absorbed by
Third World countries." Added Assoc. Classics Prof.
Susan Stephens: "One need not teach chronologi
cally. One can critique Plato as a totalitarian through
the study of Nazi Germany."
This strikes me as a very second-hand approach to
our culture. Yes, people can study the effects of
literature, but so much is missed. As Lindenberger
said, "Students should know texts for their intrinsic
value." We're big kids now, and we should be at least
attempting to deal with these works as directly as
possible, formulating our own thoughts and making
our own judgments. Why shouldn't we read Rous
seau if we want to learn about Rousseau? You and I
may disagree about what ought to be on that contro
versial list, but I agree with Chace that "The tracks
have already been moving in the right direction."
There is still another point to argue against the
task force's selection of the texts. Suppose, during a
specific time period, minority works are not influen
tial, not of a high literary value or simply not pub
lished? Rebholz makes the point that the writing of
women and ethnic minorities was rarely published
until the 18th centuiy. He thinks that if the new list
is adopted, the "ancient world is gone."
Philosophical gripes aside, the practical problems
are stunning. I am currently enrolled in the
Literature and the Arts track, and just last week we
were held responsible for a mere 500 pages of "Great
Expectations." We're moving. I, along with about
1,500 other students, can personally assure you that
more work is absolutely out of the question. It's
simply bad for our complexion.
While we're at it, how about those poor professors?
I wonder what my lecturer, English Prof. Larry
Friedlander, would say if I told him to expand the
focus of the course in order to make room for another
culture or two: "Sure, Scott! Why don't you drop by
my office and we'll work something out. Does around
5 o'clock sound OK?" Please. Those profs, work their
butts off as it is trying to give the class a focus and
some sort of thematic unity. Teaching Western Cul
ture as it currently exists is an extremely difficult
task for any teacher; these proposals only make
things worse.
The future? One can only hope that the Committee
on Undergraduate Studies will study the proposals,
and after extensive deliberation (all good committees
need to have extensive deliberation) say, "Thank you.
no." I've heard some pretty thoughtful recommen
dations from fellow students, such as beefing up the
non-Western culture requirement.
No one has all the answers. But if these guys have
their way Stanford may need a rare book room to
store all those unread copies of Aristotle and The
Iliad.
