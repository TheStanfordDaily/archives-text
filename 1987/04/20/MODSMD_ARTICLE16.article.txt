# Pesticides pollute California
## 
### 
In recent weeks, Stanford MEChA has Initi
ated a campaign on campus, in conjunction
with the United Farm Workers (UFW) grape
boycott, to rid Stanford dining halls of all table
grapes.

MARK PIZZARO

There are many facets of this issue which
have been debated over the past few months,
throughout California and here on campus.
Interestingly, there is a common thread to all
these debates: Those who oppose the boycott
consistently fail to address the issue at hand.
That is to say. the California growers (farm
owners) spend the vast majority of their anti
boycott efforts claiming that Cesar Chavez and
the UFW are slandering them, and purpose
fully attempting to ruin their industry for per
sonal profit. Even if this were true, although it
is a far cry from what the UFW is actually
pursuing, this does not relate in the least to
the issue of concern. These are the facts:
□ In 1984 alone. California food, water and air
supplies were exposed to 310.289.990 pounds
of pesticides.
□ Pesticide researchers (biologists and
chemists) estimate that at least 50 percent of
these pesticides are completely unnecessary
for the insured health and safety of the crops.
□ Of the five pesticides that the UFW is trying
to ban permanently (those used predominantly
on grapes), two are proven mutagens in labora
tory animals and the others lack the necessary
research to make said determination. All but
one are still used in California.

□ One-third of all pesticides used in California
are known carcinogens.
□ The Occupational Health and Safety Admin
istration says there are no safe levels of car
cinogen exposure.
□ Virtually all pesticides (and in particular
those targeted to be banned) can be absorbed
through the skin, eyes and lungs.
□ Many of these pesticides are put directly
into the soil, and are therefore grown straight
into California foods (thus, these and oil-based
pesticides cannot be washed from California
grown foods).
□ This direct soil exposure has allowed pes
ticides to leak into California ground water
supplies, resulting in cancer in over 20 Califor
nia children (in McFarland and Fowler) and
seven resultant deaths.
□ Over 300.000 farm workers face at least
minimal disease from pesticidal exposure each
year.
□ These diseases result from exposure to the
pesticides and can appear as long as 33 days
after spraying, but often appear only hours
after spraying.
All the above statistics were obtained from
documents released by the California Food and
Agriculture Department.
These are the facts. This is what is happen
ing today. The use of deadly pesticides in Cali
fornia's agricultural business does not affect
only Chlcanos or only farm workers. It affects
virtually everyone in California. If you breathe
California air, drink California water or eat
California-grown crops, you are affected by
pesticide use. In addition, as things stand
today, you have no say in the matter. This is
why the grape boycott is so Important to the
Stanford community. The California growers,

The simple truth is that
people are in pesticide treat
ment as you read this arti
cle, that babies are being
born without arms and legs,
and real human beings are
dying today because of pes
ticide use and abuse in Cali
fornia.

supported by Gov. George Deukmejlan. have
yet to consider the concerns of California
citizens. If they did. why would they use more
than twice the amount of pesticides necessary
to grow "safe" crops simply because they make
the food products look more appealing?
The UFW grape boycott is not about the dol
lar. and it is not about fame and glory. It Is
about the health of the people who live in Cali
fornia. work in its fields and eat Its food. The
simple truth is that people are being treated
for pesticide poisoning as you read this article,
that babies are being born without arms and
legs and that human beings are dying today
because of pesticide use and abuse in Califor
nia. This is obviously not a game. If you would
like to find out more about the grape boycott,
or if you have any questions at all. please con
