### HARU CONNOLLY 
Vice President George Bush may come to
Stanford this quarter as part of an ASSU
Speakers Bureau series featuring 1988 presi
dential candidates, according to senior Meg
Richman, director of the Speakers Bureau.
Richman said the Speakers Bureau received
a letter from Bush's office on Friday which in
dicated that he would be interested in speak
ing at Stanford if he comes to Northern Califor
nia this spring. "If anyone comes this quarter,
it would be Bush," Richman said.
The Speakers Bureau sent letters last month
to 38 politicians who have declared their can
didacy or simply expressed an interest in run
ning for the presidency
As a result of that initial mailing, former Del
aware Gov. Pete DuPont has already spoken at
Stanford. Other invited candidates include
former Democratic senator Gary Hart of

Colorado, Sen. Joseph Biden, D-Del., Sen.
Robert Dole, R-Kan., White House Chief of
Staff Howard Baker, New York Democratic
Gov. Mario Cuomo, California Republican Gov.
George Deukmejian and Tennessee Republi
can Gov. Lamar Alexander.
"Most requests have been placed in their
open files, saying that they will keep us in
mind if they come to the Bay Area," said fresh
man Steven Struthers, who is organizing the
presidential candidates series. "Right now we
will be mailing out return letters, again en
couraging them to come."
"We are hoping they will be coming to the
Bay Area," said Struthers, who said that Du-
Pont was able to combine his Stanford appear
ance with a fund-raiser in San Francisco. "It's
tough for them to schedule a speech at a col
lege campus.
"I don't foresee any honorarium requests,
but we will be open to paying for travel expen

ditures and an overnight stay in Palo Alto if a
candidate requests that," Struthers said.
Normally, an honorarium request is chan
neled through the ASSU Speakers Bureau
Committee, which discusses that request in
light of its budget and the "speaker's worth to
the Stanford community." Struthers ex
plained.
"Our goal is to get all of (the candidates) here
to speak," Struthers said. "I see this series as a
means of enlightening students to different
ideas, (so that) when they vote, they have an
idea on the policies of the candidates."
According to Richman, preparations for
other speaker series have begun this quarter,
including series with mayors and cartoonists.
"We've invited cartoonists Gary Larson ("The
Far Side"), Garry Trudeau ("Doonesbury"), Bill
Watterson ("Calvin and Hobbes") and Berke
Breathed ("Bloom County")," said Richman.
"We may even get Breathed for this quarter."
