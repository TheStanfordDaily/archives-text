## Study shows global retirement patterns vary 
### ELAINE LU 
Japanese workers are more
likely than their American coun
terparts to continue working after
reaching age 60, but both U.S.
and Japanese workers tend to
remain in the work force longer

than laborers in France and the
United Kingdom, according to
Stanford researchers.
Sociology Prof. Alex Inkeles and
graduate student Chikako Usui
recently completed a study on dif
fering attitudes toward retirement
in France, Japan, the United
States and the United Kingdom.

The two reported the results of
their field research at a recent
Hoover Institution conference on
retirement.
Inkeles used data from a study
conducted for the prime mini
ster's office of Japan in 1981 to
draw his conclusions. According
to this study — which surveyed
men over 60 years of age in Japan,
the United States, the United
Kingdom and France — the num
ber of people who actually take ad
vantage of retirement in the differ
ent countries varies significantly.
In the United States, 33 percent
of men over 60 remain in the work
force. In Japan, a higher propor
tion, 57 percent, continue to
work.
Europeans, however, tend to
retire at a younger age than their
American and Japanese counter
parts. In France, eight percent of
men over 60 continue to work; In
England, the figure is 13 percent.
A difference in attitudes toward
retirement becomes apparent In
the part of the study that ex
amines the issue of the "ideal" re
tirement age for employees in the
respective countries.

When French and British men
were asked for their ideal retire
ment age, 55 percent responded
age 60. while only two to three per
cent responded age 70.
When asked the same question,
only 16 percent of American men
and 14 percent of Japanese men
responded age 60. Significantly
more men — 22 percent in the
United States and 39 percent in
Japan — responded age 70.
Furthermore, most Americans
(64 percent) and Japanese (60
percent) view their savings from
their working years as their pri
mary source of income during
their retirement. In contrast, 67
percent of the French and 50 per
cent of the British surveyed view
social security as the greatest
source of income for retirees.
Inkeles said the difference In at
titudes about retirement showed
that in the United States and
Japan there is relatively greater
emphasis on "reliance on oneself
. . . rather than on the govern
ment."
Another aspect of the research
studied and compared the retire
ment schemes of various nations.

Inkeles and Usui found that most
countries institute similar retire
ment programs.
According to Inkeles. a compar
ative approach Is necessary so
that data for the United States is
considered in the context of other
industrial countries. By observing
countries that have already ex
perimented with reformed social
programs — such as an earlier re
tirement age — governments can
gain ideas and measures of their
success.
In collecting data on the main
facts about retirement. Inkeles

and Usui considered such factors
as the normal pensionable age
and the percent of average wage
replaced by pension benefits.
The minimum age in industria
lized nations for receiving a gov
ernment pension Is 65 years and
nine months, and most countries
provide industrial workers with a
pension of 61 to 62 percent of
their normal wages, they found.
Since economic and structural
facts did not give "compelling ex
planations" for the differences in
degree of participation of the el
derly in the labor force. Inkeles

said, he and Usui were left with*
"measures of popular values,
preferred modes of behavior . . .
(and) cultural orientations" as
possible causes.
Cultural factors Include
"attitudes toward work, its intrin
sic meanlngfulness and Its rela
tion to desired conditions such as
autonomy and independence," In
keles added.
Usui said she believes that gov
ernments hope to find "an op
timum balance between work and
leisure, and with how individuals
view and prepare for retirement."
