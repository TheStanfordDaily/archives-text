## Tennis loses two; NCAAs not likely 
### JON WEISMAN Staff writer 
Needing a win at home last
weekend to have a good chance at
being invited to the NCAA Cham
pionships next month, the Stan
ford men's tennis team suc
cumbed to top-ranked USC 6-3
Friday before being wiped out by
third-ranked UCLA Saturday, 8-1.
Stanford fell to 12-10 overall
and fourth place in the Pacific
Conference Southern Division at
4-5. With only one dual match
remaining in the regular season,
-at home against 5-4 California
•May 1, Stanford's chances of
defending its national title are
slim.
"The match with Cal is very im
portant," Stanford Coach Dick
Gould said. "It may not have any
•relevance, but we've got to get
.ready for it. . . . We don't know
what the other teams that we're in
contention with have been doing."
Friday looked like it might be
the day for upsets. While the 11th
j-anked Bears, by virtue of a
doubles sweep, were startling
UCLA 5-4, Stanford was giving the
Trojans a tough battle, as the
.teams were tied 3-3 after singles
play.
Stanford's Patrick McEnroe,
ranked 24th in the nation, made
surprisingly short work of No. 2
Luke Jensen, disposing of the am
bidextrous Trojan 6-1, 6-2. It was
the second consecutive victory
over Jensen for McEnroe, though
it had taken three hours when the

teams last met two weeks ago in
Los Angeles.
USC came back to take a 2-1
lead thanks to wins in the middle
of the lineup. Scott Melville
(ranked 75th) overcame a break by
Stanford's Mark Jacobson in the
first set of their No. 4 singles
match before breezing in the
second set to win, 6-4, 6-1.
In court three, the opposite hap
pened. USC's John Carras blew
away Jeff Cathrall in the first set,
but then had to come back from
being down a break himself in the
second set to win 6-0, 7-5.
The match that had received the
most buildup was between Stan
ford freshman Jeff Tarango
(ranked 31st) and Trojan senior
Rick Leach (ranked fourth) at No.
1. Leach, whose play has long
been followed by Tarango, had
easily handled the freshman two
weeks ago. 6-3, 6-2.
Friday, however, Tarango
earned Leach's respect by moving
out to a 5-0 lead, igniting both
himself and the capacity crowd at
Stanford Tennis Stadium with a
succession of great clutch shots
such as the second service ace
that gave him a 5-0 lead. Tarango
remained steady through the
second set to win 6-1, 6-4, tying
the team score at 2-2.
As 29th-ranked Jonas Wallgard
of USC was breaking the tie with a
6-4, 6-3 victory over Scott Moody,
Stanford freshman Barry Ric
hards was coming back from a 3-5
deficit in the second set of his No.
6 singles match against 57th

ranked Eric Amend to tie at 5-5.
With Stanford now trailing 3-2, it
was now crucial that Richards not
lose his one-set lead.
By the time the set went into a
tiebreaker, the crowd had spilled
onto court four to view the action
better. Richards staked a 5-1 lead
in the tiebreaker, but Amend
came back to tie.
Richards then lunged to hit a
backhand that Amend returned
into the net to lead, 6-5, before
breaking Amends serve with an
other backhand shot to win the
match, 6-4, 7-6. The Cardinal was
then fired up to play doubles after
splitting singles, just as it was
when it upset No. 2 Long Beach
State Tuesday.
"I felt very confident going into
the doubles at 3-3," USC Coach
Dick Leach said. "I felt if Ricky
(Leach) and Scott (Melville) won
we would for sure, because Stan
ford has improved their number
one team a little bit by getting
Moody in there because he's such
a good doubles player."
McEnroe and Moody were han
dled with ease by the third-ranked
team of Leach and Melville in No. 1
doubles, 6-2, 6-2. But in courts
two and three, the Stanford teams
had come back identically from 6-
2 first-set losses with 6-3 second
set wins.
Jensen and Amend, who in be
tween points were having a war of
grunts with the crowd, regrouped
in the third set of their No. 2

In a highly anticipated No. 1 singles match Friday at Stanford Tennis Stadium, Cardinal freshman Jeff
Tarango, ranked 31st in the nation, upset USC's No. 4-ranked Rick Leach, 6-1, 6-4. Earlier in the year, the
more experienced Leach had easily beaten the freshman, 6-3, 6-2. But even Tarango's impressive victory
wasn't enough as the Card fell to the Trojans 6-3.
