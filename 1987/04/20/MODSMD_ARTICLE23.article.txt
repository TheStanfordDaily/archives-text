# Baseball takes exciting third game in Arizona
## 
### TOM SENF Senior staff writer 
TUCSON - It was The Game
Nobody Wanted, or at least The
Game Nobody Could Take, until
David Esquer and Ed Sprague
stepped forward and grabbed it for
Stanford.
After blowing a seven-run lead,
**the Cardinal trailed Arizona 11-10
in the ninth inning Saturday af
ternoon here at Sancet Field when
Esquer delivered a two-out RBI
single to center off Wildcat reliever
Frank Halcovich, who had beaten
Stanford Thursday night. Three
batters later. Sprague ripped a
Halcovich slider well up against
the fence in left-center for a three
run double.
The result was a wild 14-11
Stanford win that restored the
Cardinal's one-game lead in the
Pacific 10 Southern Division over
- UCLA, which lost to Arizona State
* on Saturday. Stanford also beat
Arizona 12-3 on Friday, giving the

Cardinal five wins in its six-game
season series with the Wildcats.
Stanford is now 14-5 in the Six-
Pac, 31-12 overall, while Arizona
fell to 7-14 in the conference and
28-21 overall. The Cardinal will
host California today at 2:30 p.m.
in a makeup of an earlier rainout.
Jack McDowell will start for Stan
ford.
"When you win a game like this
— you light, make errors, fall be
hind and come back the way we
did — that's really big," Stanford
Coach Mark Marquess said.
"You've gotta win a few of these."
For 4 1/2 innings, a cliffhanger
did not seem to be in the making,
as Stanford relentlessly drilled
groundballs through Sancet
Field's rock-hard infield en route
to a 10-3 lead. In its first five at
bats, the Cardinal nailed Arizona
starter Gary Alexander for 12 hits
and reliever Jason Klonoski for
four more, including three each
from Esquer and Toi Cook.
Despite their fifth-place Six-Pac

status, the Wildcats refused to fold
In the stifling Arizona heat. They
scored three runs in the bottom of
the fifth and another in the sixth
to close to within 10-7, then went
ahead in the bottom of the
seventh — with a lot of help from
the Stanford defense.
With one on and one out. Card
inal reliever Steven Chitren got
consecutive double-play balls to
second from Steve Strong and Al
exander, but Stanford did not
record a single out because of
back-to-back errors (one fielding
and one throwing) by Cardinal
second baseman Frank Carey.
The two miscues loaded the
bases, setting the table for Dave
Shermet's two-run double Inside
third base. J.T. Snow then laid
down a perfect safety squeeze to
tie the game and was safe when
Chitren couldn't find the handle
for Stanford's third error of the in
ning.

On Friday, second baseman Frank Carey went 3-for-5 to help the Cardinal to a 12-3 victory. Saturday,
however, two seventh-inning errors by the sophomore helped to put Stanford one run back. Nonetheless,
a great bottom-of-the-ninth rally by Carey and his teammates saved the day as the Card won 14-11.
A fielder's choice by Alan Zinter
put Arizona up 11-10, a lead they
took into the top of the ninth.
Pinch hitter Mark Machtolf began
the inning by lifting what ap
peared to be a routine flyball to
Halcovich in left, but the wind
caused him to misplay it into a
double.
It was Halcovich's third such ad
venture of the day. In the fifth, he
nearly did a pirouette chasing a
slicing Ron Witmeyer shot and
failed to read the hook on a
Sprague liner down the line. Both
went for two bases.
"He's my best hitter." Arizona
Coach Jerry Kindall said, defend
ing his decision to use Halcovich.
a .407 hitter, in the outfield. "I
couldn't DH him because my
pitcher (Alexander) was the DH. I
tried to hide him out there in left,
but the wind wouldn't permit
that."
After Witmeyer popped up, Kin
dall brought Halcovich in from the
outfield to pitch to right-handed

pinch hitter Scott Delucchi.
Marquess countered with lefty
Eric Cox. who grounded out to
short as Machtolf took third.
Esquer then nailed a Halcovich
fastball on the first pitch to tie the
game.
"Coach Marquess told me not to
take anything, to go up and hack
at a good pitch," Esquer said. "It
showed he has a lot of confidence
in me and pumped me up. I
thought if we were gonna lose the
game we were gonna lose it ag
gressively."
A walk to Ruben Amaro and an
error by shortstop Greg Fowble on
Cook's bouncer — the Arizona
freshman's 30th of the year —
loaded the bases.
For exactly three pitches.
"He (Halcovich) had pretty good
stuff against me on Thursday, but
it's hard to have good stuff again
that soon," Sprague said. "He
started me off with a slider (for a
called strike), but it was just spin
ning. Then he moved me back
with a fastball (for a ball). He tried
to come back with the slider, and 1
hit it."
Hit it he did. about nine feet up
on the 12-foot fence in left-center

to clear the bases easily.
After his team had beaten Stan
ford 10-5 on Thursday, Klndall
was asked what he thought of
facing his nemesis. Lee Plemel,
the following night.
"What's that mean?" Klndall
asked.
The Arizona skipper probably
has a better idea now, as Plemel
extended his career record to 5-0
against the Wildcats with a 10-hit
complete-game performance.
The junior right-hander, now 6-
4 on the year, was at his speed
changing. corner-painting best,
holding Arizona scoreless through
the first seven innings.
By the time Arizona reached
Plemel for three in the eighth,
Stanford had a 12-0 lead against
Wildcat ace Gilbert Heredia. In two
games against Stanford this year
Heredia is 0-2 with a 15.57 ERA.
Against everyone else, he is 8-4
with a 3.15 ERA.
Doug Robbins (2-for-4. three
runs scored). Paul Carey (3-for-5,
four runs scored) and Frank Carey
(3-for-5) all had big days, but the
biggest belonged to Witmeyer,
who went 3-for-5 and drove in a
career-high six runs.
