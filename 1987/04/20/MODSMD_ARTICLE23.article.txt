# Baseball takes exciting third game in Arizona

TUCSON - It was The Game
Nobody Wanted, or at least The
Game Nobody Could Take, until
David Esquer and Ed Sprague
stepped forward and grabbed it for
Stanford.
After blowing a seven-run lead,
**the Cardinal trailed Arizona 11-10
in the ninth inning Saturday af
ternoon here at Sancet Field when
Esquer delivered a two-out RBI
single to center off Wildcat reliever
Frank Halcovich, who had beaten
Stanford Thursday night. Three
batters later. Sprague ripped a
Halcovich slider well up against
the fence in left-center for a three
run double.
The result was a wild 14-11
Stanford win that restored the
Cardinal's one-game lead in the
Pacific 10 Southern Division over
- UCLA, which lost to Arizona State
* on Saturday. Stanford also beat
Arizona 12-3 on Friday, giving the

Cardinal five wins in its six-game
season series with the Wildcats.
Stanford is now 14-5 in the Six-
Pac, 31-12 overall, while Arizona
fell to 7-14 in the conference and
28-21 overall. The Cardinal will
host California today at 2:30 p.m.
in a makeup of an earlier rainout.
Jack McDowell will start for Stan
ford.
"When you win a game like this
— you light, make errors, fall be
hind and come back the way we
did — that's really big," Stanford
Coach Mark Marquess said.
"You've gotta win a few of these."
For 4 1/2 innings, a cliffhanger
did not seem to be in the making,
as Stanford relentlessly drilled
groundballs through Sancet
Field's rock-hard infield en route
to a 10-3 lead. In its first five at
bats, the Cardinal nailed Arizona
starter Gary Alexander for 12 hits
and reliever Jason Klonoski for
four more, including three each
from Esquer and Toi Cook.
Despite their fifth-place Six-Pac

status, the Wildcats refused to fold
In the stifling Arizona heat. They
scored three runs in the bottom of
the fifth and another in the sixth
to close to within 10-7, then went
ahead in the bottom of the
seventh — with a lot of help from
the Stanford defense.
With one on and one out. Card
inal reliever Steven Chitren got
consecutive double-play balls to
second from Steve Strong and Al
exander, but Stanford did not
record a single out because of
back-to-back errors (one fielding
and one throwing) by Cardinal
second baseman Frank Carey.
The two miscues loaded the
bases, setting the table for Dave
Shermet's two-run double Inside
third base. J.T. Snow then laid
down a perfect safety squeeze to
tie the game and was safe when
Chitren couldn't find the handle
for Stanford's third error of the in
ning.

On Friday, second baseman Frank Carey went 3-for-5 to help the Cardinal to a 12-3 victory. Saturday,
however, two seventh-inning errors by the sophomore helped to put Stanford one run back. Nonetheless,
a great bottom-of-the-ninth rally by Carey and his teammates saved the day as the Card won 14-11.
