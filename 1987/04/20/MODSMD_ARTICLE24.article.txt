# Volleyball grabs unexpected win
## 
### ALICIA KENT Staff writer 
Nobody can deny that the
Stanford men's volleyball team
has fulfilled its prophecy of a
season of improvement.
Saturday night at UC-Santa
Barbara, in the last league
match of the season, the Card
inal proved to its skeptics that
it has truly improved by
severely beating the Gauchos,
11-15, 15-7. 15-4. 9-15, 15-7.
Coming off a 15-3. 10-15, 15-
6. 15-13 win over the Loyola-
Marymount Lions on Friday
night, and thus gaining entry
into the Western Regionals,
Stanford had already been
looking ahead to beating
UCSB.
Going into the match. Stan
ford Coach Fred Sturm said he
felt that if the team could em
phasize its own strengths and
put all of its skills together, it
could defeat UCSB. which is in
fourth place in the Western In
tercollegiate Volleyball Associa
tion with a 12-6 record.
"Things finally came to
gether." said senior John
McDermott, who played his last
collegiate league game Satur
day. "It was one of our better
matches of the season."
The team consistency
pushed Stanford to beating
UCSB. which had just come off
a win against No. 2 Pepperdine.
The Cardinal will now face Pep
perdine In the regionals at 6
p.m. April 23 at San Diego
State. "The win over Santa Bar
bara gave us a boost in our con

fidence and it also gave us mo
mentum," Sturm said. "It will
be good to go into the regionals
with a couple of wins."
Officially. UCLA (ranked
No.l) and Penn State will be
representing the West and East
in the NCAA championships.
The midwestern representa
tive, either Fall State or Ohio
State, will be decided this
weekend when the Midwestern
Regionals will be played.
The fourth spot in the cham
pionships will probably be filled
by the winner of this weekend's
Western Regionals. "We're
really looking forward to going
down and playing Pepperdine."
McDermott said. "Now we feel
we have a chance to win the
whole thing."
This weekend, some much
improved Cardinal blocking
allowed Stanford to master the
usually uncontrollable setting
of UCSB setter Jon Wallace and
the powerful kills of hitters Jon
Kosty and Pat Pennington.
Junior Scott Fortune rose to
the occasion and played one of
his most steady blocking
matches of the season, accord
ing to Sturm.
"The difference was that our
blocking was much more effec
tive." Sturm said. Ahead 9-7 in
the final game of the match.
Fortune provided three blocks
and the key kills that clinched
the match for Stanford.
After losing the first game
due to trouble with passing and
Inconsistent serving, sopho
more Dave Johnson came In for
senior Stephen Blue. "Dave came
In and really sparked the team.
He's the kind of player that makes
things happen and the guys really
responded," Sturm said. "He
seemed to be doing everything well
— digging, hitting, passing, ser
ving."
In addition, the much-improved

team effort helped the Cardinal
overcome its passing problems.
"All around, we played much bet
ter as a team," McDermott said.
"We got them in trouble passing
and were able to switch things
around on them."
Friday was a different situation
for Stanford, which went into the
match knowing it could beat the
1-16 Lions. However, Loyola had
just come off of its first win of the
season against San Dlego State,
and performed with more offen
sive power than in its last con

frontation with the Cardinal.
The players found it hard to pin
point the root of Stanford's flat
performance. According to Blue,
the Cardinal offensive game suf
fered because of the quick sets
and surprisingly powerful play of
the Lions.
In the third game, senior setter
Steve Modory came in to bring the
team to the win. "His experience
has a settling effect on the team.
He came in and seemed to know
what to do," Sturm said.
