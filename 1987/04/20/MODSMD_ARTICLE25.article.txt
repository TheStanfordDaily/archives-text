# Women revenge loss to UCLA
## 
### KEN STEVENS Senior staff writer 
Playing on the same team as
Patty Fendick, Stephanie Savides
tends to be overshadowed by her
undefeated teammate, even
though Savides plays No. '2 in the
Stanford women's tennis team's
singles lineup.
Saturday, however. Savides was
forced into the spotlight against
UCLA, and the senior responded
with a crucial come-from-behind
singles victory to lead the Cardinal
to a 5-4 win at Los Angeles that
avenged Stanford's 5-4 loss to the

Bruins April 5.
The victory, combined with
Friday's 6-3 win at USC. upped
Stanford's record to 17-3 overall,
6-3 in the Pacific 10 Conference.
The loss, UCLA's fifth in a row,
dropped the Bruins to 20-5.
With five singles matches com
pleted Saturday. Stanford held a
3-2 advantage over the Bruins,
and the No. 2 match between
Savides and UCLA's Joni Urban
had moved to a third set.
Urban took a 5-3 lead in the
final set and held a match point in
the ninth game. But Savides
captured a 3-all point to narrow

the margin to 5-4, and the Card
inal tri-captain then went on to
take the next three games for a 4-
6, 6-4, 7-5 victory that gave Stan
ford a 4-2 lead heading into
doubles.
The Cardinal's work was not
done, however. UCLA has been
strong in doubles all season and
had taken two of three matches
when the teams met earlier at
Stanford.
The Bruins' talented but
troublemaking No. 1 doubles
squad of Jane Thomas and Jenni
fer Fuchs was split up prior to Sat
urday's match. "They got in a big

fight down In Texas (last weekend)
and refused to play with each
other," Stanford Coach Frank
Brennan said.
As a result. Thomas teamed
with Allyson Cooper at No. 1, and
Fendick and Savides took advan
tage of the new UCLA tandem, re
cording a 6-4, 6-4 win that
clinched the team victory.
The Cardinal could have ex
tended its winning margin, but it
lost a pair of close contests in the
other doubles matches. Senior
Leigh Anne Eldredge and sopho
more Cindy Buchsbaum held
match points in both the second
and third sets of the No. 2 doubles
before losing 4-6, 7-6. 7-6 to Ur
ban and Fuchs.
"By that time, the other team
(Fendick and Savides) had won,"
Brennan said, explaining that the
team victory was already sealed
when Eldredge and Buchsbaum
entered their third set. "It's aw
fully hard to win those matches."
In the No. 3 doubles match,
UCLA's Maria LaFranchi and
Catherine O'Meara knocked off
Kay Tittle and Lisa Green 7-5, 7-5.
"It was 7-5, 7-5 against a really
good team, and we didn't play
well." Brennan said.
Fendick. Green and Tittle joined
Savides as winners in the singles
play as the Cardinal swept the top
four matches. Fendick beat
Thomas 6-2. 6-4 to record her
45th-straight singles victory.
Green rolled past Fuchs 6-3, 6-3 to
avenge a three-set loss in the
match at Stanford, and Tittle beat
Cooper 4-6, 6-2. 6-2.
The Cardinal's only singles
losses came at Nos. 5 and 6. where
LaFranchi upended Buchsbaum
6-3, 7-5, and O'Meara edged
Eldredge 5-7, 6-2. 6-3.
