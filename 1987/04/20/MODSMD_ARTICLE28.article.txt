# Gash vaults, Board hurdles Stanford team records

### ERIK STEN Editorial staff 
Two new school records and
four NCAA qualifiers amounted to
a pretty good weekend for Stan
ford track.
With most of the team compet
ing in San Jose at the Bruce Jen
ner Classic and a privileged few in
Florida at the Eastern Invita
tional, the Cardinal's goal on Sat
urday was to qualify as many ath
letes as possible for the NCAA
championships.
In search of the best environ
ment to get those qualifying
marks, Stanford Coach Brooks
Johnson took seven members of
the women's team to Florida while
the rest of the coaching staff ac
companied the bulk of the team to
San Jose.
In general, the more athletes a
team qualifies, the higher it places
at the nationals. If the same is
true this year, Stanford's national
potential definitely rose over the
weekend as four more events were
added to the team's NCAA roster.
Along the way, two school
records were broken — both by
their previous owners. In Florida,
senior Pam Board lowered her
own school record In the 400-
meter hurdles from 58.74 to
58.30, and in San Jose junior
John Gash set his third school
record of the season in the pole
vault with a jump of 17-feet-8-l/2.
Also qualifying for the Cardinal
were sophomore Patty Purpur and

freshman Carol Gray. Purpur,
already a qualifier In the shot put,
made herself a two-event NCAA
entrant with a discus mark of
169-3, a throw just better than the
168-6 standard.
Gray, who last weekend just
missed the 3,000 standard of
9:24.0 with a time of 9:24.5, easily
erased the disappointment of that
near-miss with a convincing
clocking of 9:19.1, good for
second place In Florida.
For Gash, who finished first at
the Jenner meet, the record vault
was his third in a series of record
breaking jumps this season. After
beginning to work with new Stan
ford Asst. Coach Dorothy Doolittle
last fall, the junior has consis
tently improved, and earlier this
season he broke the school record
with a vault of 17-0.
A few weeks later, Gash moved
the record to 17-4, and Saturday,
the junior did it again. Doolittle
attributed her pupil's success to
an improved approach, an innova
tion that has allowed Gash to gain
crucial take-off velocity.
Though not quite as scientific
about the procedure, Gash agreed
with his coach's assessment. "I
was getting better last year," Gash
said.
"After working hard for another
year, I was waiting to break
through."
Through working on his run
up, Doolittle has increased Gash's
approach from 125 to 127 feet.
While still using the same amount

of strides, the junior has learned
to go farther and faster. The In
creased speed has made the differ
ence.
"Now he has a lot more velocity
at take-off," Doollttle said. "The
extra acceleration has allowed him
to vault with heavier poles and
consequently to jump higher."
As he gets more accustomed to
the heavier poles and works to es
tablish consistency. Gash sees
himself possibly vaulting 18-0 or
better, he said.
Board, a senior team captain,
has also broken the Stanford
record more than once. During
her freshman season In 1984,
Board set school records In both
the 110 and 400 hurdles. She
went on to break the 400 mark the
following year, but until Saturday
that effort stood as her best.
Last year she was the confer
ence champion with a season-best
of 58.83 — unfortunately the
NCAA qualifying mark was 58.50.
So far this season, in three races,
Board has broken her own Stan
ford record, made the NCAA quali
fying standard and beaten rival
Gayle Kellon of UCLA twice. She
seems well on her way to her best
season ever.
For the. coming week, Board,
Gash and their teammates will
concentrate on training. The team
as a whole has no meets scheduled
for next weekend, but a group of
Individuals will take part in the
Mt. Sac and possibly the Penn
Relays.
