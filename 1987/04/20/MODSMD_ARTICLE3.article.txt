# ASSU election results delayed
## 
### MONIQUE SCHEER Senior staff writer 
The results of last week's ASSU election are still not available because
of unforeseen difficulties with the Scantron machine used to count the
ballots, according to Elections Commissioner Brett Jarvis.
Some results may be available sooner, but all will be in before the con-

stitutional deadline on midnight
Wednesday, in time to meet the re
quirements for scheduling a likely
run-off election, Jarvis said.
The first delay came Friday,
when the Scantron machine and
the computer used to tabulate the
results required minor adjust
ments before they could accom
modate the length of the ballots,
Jarvis said.
"We finally got it rolling on
Friday. So far we've done 1,300
(ballots) on the back side," Jarvis
said.
Because the Scantron machine
is located in the registrar's office,
the ASSU elections commission
could not run ballots through the
machine over the weekend.
"They wouldn't let us use the
machine (over the weekend), I
guess because they had no one to
stay with us," Jarvis said.
The ballots could not be counted
by hand in the meantime
"because it's too slow," Jarvis
said. He also pointed out that the
commission had to count the
senior class ballots and write-in
votes by hand over the weekend.
The 1,300 half-finished ballots
are only a fraction of Jarvis' esti
mate of a total 6,000 ballots. But
he said the counting will be com
pleted before the constitutionally
imposed deadline of one week
after the last polls close.
The results for different sec
tions of the ballot may be an
nounced separately, perhaps
starting today, Jarvis said.
The ASSU constitution sets
deadlines for the announcement
of election results so that prepara
tions can be made for a run-off a
week in advance. A run-off elec
tion for the COP will be held next
week if no slate receives at least 50
percent of the vote in the results
this week, according to Jarvis.
The delay in the election
returns, besides keeping the can
didates in suspense, will have no
serious effects on those slates par
ticipating in the run-off.
