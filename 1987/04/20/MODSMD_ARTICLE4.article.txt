# Juniors elect Memslate
## 
### MARK LAWRENCE Senior staff writer 
Stacey Estrella, Ed Goines, Liz
Marks and Keith Yamashita — a
group of juniors known to Stan
ford voters as "Memslate" — won
last week's election for Senior
Class Presidents by a margin of
more than 200 votes, according to
preliminary counts.
The four slate members say that
in addition to the standard Senior
Class President activities — senior
pub nights and Commencement
— they hope to start new pro
grams and involve as many
seniors as possible in organizing
them.
The objective. Goines said, is to
infuse some school spirit into a
year overburdened by major re
quirements. job searches and
graduate school applications.
"We want seniors to get some of
that spirit we had during fresh
man year." Goines said. "At foot
ball games, we want them to forget
about their futures for a while and
just go yell a lot."
According to election results
posted by the ASSU this weekend,
Memslate won 671 of the 1,158
votes cast, outdistancing the Slate
of'BB, which finished second with
438. The ASSU has not yet
received ballots from overseas
campuses, but those votes will not
make a difference, according to
ASSU Elections Commissioner
Brett Jarvis.
Since the ballot asked voters to
rank the four slates in order of
preference, the vote counts were
tabulated according to a formula
for preferential elections.
Memslate members say the first
item on their agenda is a "we're
still-juniors" party that the slate
plans to hold on the intramural
fields in late May. After that, slate
members say, they will spend the
summer organizing senior activi
ties ranging from a wild
"disorientation" party to a new
community service program.
For each of these programs, the
presidents will organize a commit
tee of seniors to work out the
details.
Goines said the presidents hope
to "start off the year with an emo
tional charge" by holding a
"disorientation" bash reminiscent
of parties held during freshman
orientation week. He said the slate
is hoping to arrange an appear

ance by former Dean of Admis-;
sions Fred Hargadon, who ad%
mitted the Class of 1988 during
his last year at Stanford.
Slate members say they also
plan to establish a new senior
public service program. "It'll be an
outreach program for the elderly
or East Palo Alto or something like
that," Yamashita said.
Marks said another option the
•slate will consider is starting a big
brother/big sister program.
As part of its effort to renew
Stanford spirit, the slate plans to
reserve large blocks of seats for
home football and basketball
games and to organize bus trips to
the USC game in Los Angeles.
But Estrella said it's the little
things that can make senior year
fun. She said the presidents, in
addition to their more ambitious
plans, also hope to sponsor
"Twister" parties, a talent show,
senior trips to the Stanford Sierra
Camp and Yosemite and a senior
raffle. They also plan to organize a
senior class directory like the
froshbook, according to Marks.
