# Outstanding applicants recognized
## Jordan program initiated 
### ANN MARSH Staff writer 
In the same envelope that contained
their acceptances, 200 of this year's pro
spective freshmen were notified that
they had been selected as Jordan
Scholars by the Office of Undergraduate
Admissions.
In a new program, honorary recogni
tion will be awarded to those freshmen
applicants who best meet Stanford's ac
ceptance criteria of academic excellence
and adherence to the University's funda
mental standards, according to Jean
Fetter, dean of Undergraduate Admis
sions.
The award, which does not include

monetary assistance, is named after
Stanford's first president, David Starr
Jordan, who first developed the Univer
sity's fundamental standards.
Fetter, who chose the 200 with the
help of two associate deans of admis
sion, said she envisions an academic
ceremony for recipients, similar to the
awards given to freshmen at the end of
the academic year.
The effort by the Committee of Under
graduate Admissions and Financial Aids
to acknowledge the personal achieve
ments of prospective Stanford students
comes largely as a response to the drop
in the number of students who decide to
attend the University after being ad
mitted, according to Fetter.

"One of the concerns at Stanford is
that we offer admission to fine students
and a number of them choose not to
come because they've been offered finan
cial aid elsewhere," said Fetter.
According to Robert Huff, director of
financial aids, the increase in merit
based financial aid — which in four-year
institutions has risen by as much as 30
percent over the past few years — has
made it difficult for Stanford to continue
its policy of offering only need-based fin
ancial aid. The rising trend toward en
ticing students with monetary rewards
for academic work "can result in stu
dents being bought," Huff said.
