# Condom committee will meet
## 
### LESLIE HATAMIYA Staff writer 
The idea of placing condom dis
pensers In some University dorms and
Libraries will be considered by a new
committee if the ASSU Senate approves
three student appointments to that
committee tomorrow.
According to Norm Robinson, acting
dean of Student Affairs, the University
has yet to take action on a two-month
old student task force recommendation
urging the installation of condom dis
pensers in student residences and li
brary restrooms because students have
not yet been appointed to the University
Housing and Operations Advisory Com
mittee.

Once Robinson receives notice of the
student appointments, the committee
will meet and begin Its study of the con
dom dispenser Issue. Robinson said.
The committee will study the pros and
cons of installing the condom dis
pensers in restrooms around campus
and then make a recommendation on
the issue, he said. As acting dean of Stu
dent Affairs. Robinson is responsible for
final approval of the committee's recom
mendation.
The Office of Student Affairs "sent in a
request to the ASSU Nominations Com
mittee In January or February" but has
not yet been notified of students ap
pointed to that committee, Robinson
said.
According to Christina Felton. chair of

the ASSU Nominations Commission,
three student nominees were chosen
after interviews on April 4. but have not
yet been confirmed because the senate
has not met since then.
She said that appointments were
delayed until April 4 because of a
shortage of applicants.
When the Nominations Committee
first advertised for the five student posi
tions in January, only one student ap
plied. she said. That student, freshman
Kimberly Claffy. was appointed to the
committee last quarter.
"Probably part of the problem of the
lack of student applicants was that this
was a new committee and no one was
familiar with what its purpose is,"
she said.
"Toward the end of last quarter
we advertised for the committee
openings a second time and
received applications the weekend
before Dead Week." she said.
Other members already on the
committee are Robinson, Keith
Guy, director of Housing and Food
Service, and Rob Robinson, pro
fessor of German Studies and resi
dent fellow at Lagunlta Court
West.
Robinson said he Is not sure
how soon the committee will be
able to take action on the installa
tion of the dispensers. "There is
no way of knowing what issues
will come up to be discussed," he
said.
The Idea of installing the con
dom dispensers In campus
restrooms was suggested last
quarter in a five-member task
force of students enrolled in

Human Biology 150 A, "Biosocial
Aspects of Birth Control."
Junior Shirley Wang, a member
of the original task force, said the
political nature of the issue has
made the approval of dispensers
difficult. "People are worried
about what alumni, parents and
athletes will think and (how they
will) react," she said.
The task force, however, has
found support from students, res
ident fellows and library officials.
Susan Perry, chief librarian at
Meyer, has no objection to install
ing the condom dispensers in the
library's restrooms. "I'm perfectly
willing to put them into Meyer if
they were put into other
bathrooms on campus." she said.
Madera resident fellow Charlie
Junkerman is also in favor of the
proposal. "I think it's a fine idea."
he said. "I'm convinced of the
latest advertising on safe sex to
prevent the spread of AIDS and
STDs. If condoms are close by,
rather than students having to
bike to Walgreens at nine or ten ot
night, students would be more
likely to use them."

Junior Jeff Colen, resident as
sistant at Madera, said he sees a
need for the dispensers in student
residence restrooms. "No matter
what people say about how smart
Stanford students are, there's a
lot of miseducation. If condoms
are accessible, it would encourage
birth control. I am in favor of the
whole idea." he said.
Colen said whether students
would use the dispensers would
depend on the atmosphere in the
dorm. "In a dorm where it was dis
cussed openly I think they would
be used. It might be more uncom
fortable for a student to use them
in a dorm (where) there was a
negative attitude toward them."
Evan Porteus, resident fellow at
Roble, said he wouldn't object to
the dispensers, and added that
they might cause students to talk
about being more cautious about
sex.
Roble resident assistant Jack
Alden also does not object to the
condom dispensers. "I think the
idea is fine. Any ease in the acces
sibility (of condoms) is a positive
step," he said.

need for the dispensers in student
residence restrooms. "No matter
what people say about how smart
Stanford students are, there's a
lot of miseducation. If condoms
are accessible, it would encourage
birth control. I am in favor of the
whole idea." he said.
Colen said whether students
would use the dispensers would
depend on the atmosphere in the
dorm. "In a dorm where it was dis
cussed openly I think they would
be used. It might be more uncom
fortable for a student to use them
in a dorm (where) there was a
negative attitude toward them."
Evan Porteus, resident fellow at
Roble, said he wouldn't object to
the dispensers, and added that
they might cause students to talk
about being more cautious about
sex.
Roble resident assistant Jack
Alden also does not object to the
condom dispensers. "I think the
idea is fine. Any ease in the acces
sibility (of condoms) is a positive
step," he said.
