Argentine president triumphs
BUENOS AIRES, Argentina — President Raul Alfonsin. pulling
Argentina back from the brink of bloodshed, yesterday personally
confronted Army rebels at an infantry school they were holding
and accepted their surrender.
The Argentine leader flew by helicopter to the embattled military
base 20 miles west of the capital, capping a five-day national
drama that had threatened to pit loyal troops against the insur
gents and to shake the foundations of this three-year-old
democracy.
Before leaving. Alfonsin delivered a fiery speech promoting
democracy and military respect for civilian authority to cheering
tens of thousands massed in front of the government's Pink
House. He told the crowd he would return with a solution to the
crisis.
"Compatriots, Happy Easter. The mutinous men have backed
down," he announced back at the executive mansion three hours
later, evoking thunderous applause and tears of joy among the lis
teners. "As required, they will be detained and judged."
The presidential action appeared to reaffirm civilian rule in a
country rocked by half a century of military coups. Commentators
praised the peaceful outcome as an encouraging sign of the con
solidation of democracy. But amid the euphoria of the moment,
serious questions lingered about the future ability of Army com
manders to enforce discipline among lower-ranking officers who
had refused to move against the rebels.
Israelis clash with Palestinians
KIRYAT SHEMONA, Israel — Israeli soldiers clashed early yes
terday with a heavily armed Palestinian unit on a hostage-taking
mission inside Israel's northern border, leaving the three guerril
las and two soldiers dead, the Israeli Army and radio reported.
The gun battle began after Israeli forces tracked footprints
through rugged terrain in the hills near the Lebanese border, the
army said.
It was the first attempted infiltration of the area by Palestinian
guerrillas in more than a year and the first time since before Is
rael's 1982 invasion of Lebanon that guerrillas succeeded in
penetrating Israel's northern border, scene of numerous bloody
operations in the 19705.
Yesterday afternoon, Israeli helicopter gunships retaliated by
bombarding a building outside the Lebanese port city of Tyre that
the Israeli Army said was used to plan terrorist attacks. The target
was near the Palestinian refugee camp of Rashidiyah.
New Polish debate over Holocaust
WARSAW, Poland — A fervent new debate about Polish "co
responsibility" for the Holocaust, sustained in the press here for
more than three months, appears to signal an important shift of
attitude by some leading intellectuals on one of this country's
more sensitive historical issues.
The debate, which editors said would not have been possible
before a recent relaxation in official censorship, began with an ar
ticle by the respected literary critic Jan Blonski, who argued that
Poles bore guilt in connection with the Nazi extermination of six
million Jews on Polish territory during World War 11. Polish
ground will be "stained." Blonski said, until the guilt is collectively
acknowledged.
The powerfully argued article represented one of the first times
that a prominent intellectual in Poland had differed from the view,
strongly promoted by official propaganda as well as Catholic and
opposition circles, that Poles were blameless for the genocide.
Its publication in the independent Catholic weekly Tygodnik
Powszechny in January touched off an outpouring of more than
100 articles and letters, including attacks on Blonski as well as
soul-searching admissions of guilt feelings by other writers.
Pope delivers Easter message
VATICAN CITY — Pope John Paul II used his traditional Easter
Sunday message to urge respect for the unborn child and speak
against artifical insemination.
In his "Urbi et Orbi" (to the city and the world) blessing in St.
Peter's Square, the pontiff said the human being was fashioned by
God in his own image "when he quickens in the mother's womb."
He added: "May reverent wonder for the mystery of love that sur
rounds his coming into the world not die out in contemporary
man."
"We beseech you Lord of the living grant that, in harmony with
the divine plan, he may live in the only way worthy of him. the way
of giving from person to person in a context of love expressed
through the flesh in an act which from the very beginning God
willed as a seal of the giving."
The pope also urged people to "respect the transcendent dignity
of all their fellow human beings, whether they be poor or hungry,
imprisoned, sick, dying, wounded in body or mind, beset by doubt
or tempted to despair."
Lawyers thrive 011 Iran scandal
WASHINGTON — The Iran-contra scandal is the best thing to
happen to Washington lawyers since Watergate.
The dozens of individuals implicated in. involved with or even
tangent tally connected to the affair have lawyers. Their companies
have lawyers. Their secretaries have lawyers. Their accountants
have lawyers. Their bankers have lawyers.
Sometimes even their lawyers have lawyers: Witness retired Air
Force major general Richard Secord. whose lawyer. Thomas
Green, has hired Earl Silbert. a former U.S. attorney here, to rep
resent him in connection with the probe. Neither Green nor Sil
bert would grant interviews to explain why.
"In central roles. I imagine you must have two dozen law firms,
at a minimum," said Leonard Garment, whose office features a
photograph of client Robert McFarlane. a former national security
adviser, inscribed with thanks to Garment for his faith and
friendship.
In addition, there are the 23 lawyers working for independent
counsel Lawrence Walsh, the 17 lawyers working for the Senate
select committee, the 12 working for the House select committee
and the six lawyers who worked for the Tower commission.

Argentine president triumphs
BUENOS AIRES, Argentina — President Raul Alfonsin. pulling
Argentina back from the brink of bloodshed, yesterday personally
confronted Army rebels at an infantry school they were holding
and accepted their surrender.
The Argentine leader flew by helicopter to the embattled military
base 20 miles west of the capital, capping a five-day national
drama that had threatened to pit loyal troops against the insur
gents and to shake the foundations of this three-year-old
democracy.
Before leaving. Alfonsin delivered a fiery speech promoting
democracy and military respect for civilian authority to cheering
tens of thousands massed in front of the government's Pink
House. He told the crowd he would return with a solution to the
crisis.
"Compatriots, Happy Easter. The mutinous men have backed
down," he announced back at the executive mansion three hours
later, evoking thunderous applause and tears of joy among the lis
teners. "As required, they will be detained and judged."
The presidential action appeared to reaffirm civilian rule in a
country rocked by half a century of military coups. Commentators
praised the peaceful outcome as an encouraging sign of the con
solidation of democracy. But amid the euphoria of the moment,
serious questions lingered about the future ability of Army com
manders to enforce discipline among lower-ranking officers who
had refused to move against the rebels.
Israelis clash with Palestinians
KIRYAT SHEMONA, Israel — Israeli soldiers clashed early yes
terday with a heavily armed Palestinian unit on a hostage-taking
mission inside Israel's northern border, leaving the three guerril
las and two soldiers dead, the Israeli Army and radio reported.
The gun battle began after Israeli forces tracked footprints
through rugged terrain in the hills near the Lebanese border, the
army said.
It was the first attempted infiltration of the area by Palestinian
guerrillas in more than a year and the first time since before Is
rael's 1982 invasion of Lebanon that guerrillas succeeded in
penetrating Israel's northern border, scene of numerous bloody
operations in the 19705.
Yesterday afternoon, Israeli helicopter gunships retaliated by
bombarding a building outside the Lebanese port city of Tyre that
the Israeli Army said was used to plan terrorist attacks. The target
was near the Palestinian refugee camp of Rashidiyah.
New Polish debate over Holocaust
WARSAW, Poland — A fervent new debate about Polish "co
responsibility" for the Holocaust, sustained in the press here for
more than three months, appears to signal an important shift of
attitude by some leading intellectuals on one of this country's
more sensitive historical issues.
The debate, which editors said would not have been possible
before a recent relaxation in official censorship, began with an ar
ticle by the respected literary critic Jan Blonski, who argued that
Poles bore guilt in connection with the Nazi extermination of six
million Jews on Polish territory during World War 11. Polish
ground will be "stained." Blonski said, until the guilt is collectively
acknowledged.
The powerfully argued article represented one of the first times
that a prominent intellectual in Poland had differed from the view,
strongly promoted by official propaganda as well as Catholic and
opposition circles, that Poles were blameless for the genocide.
Its publication in the independent Catholic weekly Tygodnik
Powszechny in January touched off an outpouring of more than
100 articles and letters, including attacks on Blonski as well as
soul-searching admissions of guilt feelings by other writers.
Pope delivers Easter message
VATICAN CITY — Pope John Paul II used his traditional Easter
Sunday message to urge respect for the unborn child and speak
against artifical insemination.
In his "Urbi et Orbi" (to the city and the world) blessing in St.
Peter's Square, the pontiff said the human being was fashioned by
God in his own image "when he quickens in the mother's womb."
He added: "May reverent wonder for the mystery of love that sur
rounds his coming into the world not die out in contemporary
man."
"We beseech you Lord of the living grant that, in harmony with
the divine plan, he may live in the only way worthy of him. the way
of giving from person to person in a context of love expressed
through the flesh in an act which from the very beginning God
willed as a seal of the giving."
The pope also urged people to "respect the transcendent dignity
of all their fellow human beings, whether they be poor or hungry,
imprisoned, sick, dying, wounded in body or mind, beset by doubt
or tempted to despair."
Lawyers thrive 011 Iran scandal
WASHINGTON — The Iran-contra scandal is the best thing to
happen to Washington lawyers since Watergate.
The dozens of individuals implicated in. involved with or even
tangent tally connected to the affair have lawyers. Their companies
have lawyers. Their secretaries have lawyers. Their accountants
have lawyers. Their bankers have lawyers.
Sometimes even their lawyers have lawyers: Witness retired Air
Force major general Richard Secord. whose lawyer. Thomas
Green, has hired Earl Silbert. a former U.S. attorney here, to rep
resent him in connection with the probe. Neither Green nor Sil
bert would grant interviews to explain why.
"In central roles. I imagine you must have two dozen law firms,
at a minimum," said Leonard Garment, whose office features a
photograph of client Robert McFarlane. a former national security
adviser, inscribed with thanks to Garment for his faith and
friendship.
In addition, there are the 23 lawyers working for independent
counsel Lawrence Walsh, the 17 lawyers working for the Senate
select committee, the 12 working for the House select committee
and the six lawyers who worked for the Tower commission.
