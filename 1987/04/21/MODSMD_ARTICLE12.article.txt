						STANFORD DAILY An Independent Newspaper Don't stroke egos 
### 
When 200 prospective freshmen opened
their acceptance letters recently, they got an
extra ego boost: They learned they had been
named Jordan Scholars.
The new Admissions Office program aims
to entice highly qualified applicants to
choose Stanford over other schools, some of
which offer merit-based financial aid.
Essentially, the scholars program is an at
tempt to lure prospective freshmen to Stan
ford by stroking their egos. While it is impor
tant that Stanford recognize the academic
achievements of its students, the Jordan
program is an ill-conceived effort to do so.
At the very least, the program is insulting
to the intelligence of prospective freshmen.
Students admitted to Stanford should be
more thoughtful about choosing which col
lege to attend than to let a meaningless piece
of paper sway the decision. Only the naive
will let the Jordon Scholar designation bowl
them over.
More important, the program will inject an

undesirable air of elitism into freshman year.
Stanford can be intimidating enough as it is
without taking away the feeling that we are
all starting out on roughly the same level.
There is no objective way to determine who
should belong to the cream of the cream of
the crop. Naming some students to such a
group can only have negative effects by put
ting pressure on them to out-perform their
peers while making other students feel less
qualified to be at Stanford.
Once freshmen arrive here, their high
school accomplishments quickly become ir
relevant — and rightly so. One of the most ex
citing things about coming to college is the
chance it offers for a fresh start in an envi
ronment rich with opportunity.
The Jordan Scholars program — especially
if it is expanded to include special classes or
ceremonies — will perpetuate the existence
of an elite group of students long after the
reasons for recognizing them have lost im
portance.
