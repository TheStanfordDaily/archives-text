ASSU is sorry
Because of the obvious
widespread interest in last week's
ASSU elections, the Elections
Commission would like to
apologize for the tardiness of the
results.
Although the bylaws of the
ASSU allow an entire week for the
preliminary tally to be an
nounced, we find that to be a long
time to expect candidates, slates
and sponsors to wait for the
results of their efforts and we
empathize with them.
For the votes to be tallied, the
ballots must be scanned and the
accumulated data must be prop

erly manipulated by a computer
program.
Although the program has been
ready for quite some time, we ran
into some difficulties with the
University's new scanning ma
chine, which has less capacity
than those used in previous years
and scans the ballots at a much
slower pace than we expected.
It is our desire to have the
results as soon as possible, and
we are making our best efforts in
order to see that this is accom
plished. Again, we apologize for
the delay.

Follow plans
In her recent letter, Mary Ash Is
confused about the Faculty Sen
ate (and campuswlde) opposition
to the design and siting of the
Reagan Museum. Conference
Center and Library (Daily, April
10).
We're not "urging the
[University Board of Trustees! to
disregard four years of planning."
We're just asking that what was
promised and decided by the
University administration and
the trustees during those four
years of planning be adhered to.
