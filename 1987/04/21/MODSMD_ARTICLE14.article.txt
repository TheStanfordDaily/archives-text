Task force's
ideas would
end program
The recommendations of the
Western Culture Task Force are
disastrous because they blur the
focus of Western Culture, make
conscientious coverage from the
ancient to the modern period
impossible and change the char
acter of the course to so-called
"cultural history."
I know that I speak for many
when I say — flatly and categori
cally — that I would not teach
such a course. I am not trained as
a social scientist and do not wish
to be retrained thus. I could not
teach such a course conscien
tiously or in good conscience.
I cannot imagine revising the
English track "Literature and the
Arts in Western Culture" along
the lines suggested by the task
force without gutting the course.
And I see no way to staff such an
artificially concocted course (if it
existed) with appropriate faculty.
The requirement for a substan
tial number of works by women
and minorities — coupled with
the geographic requirement of
balancing a European culture
with a non-European one —
means that the 500-year coverage
will have to be the modern period.
I think it no rhetorical hyper
bole that the adoption of the task
force's recommendation would
presage not just the collapse of
the Western Culture requirement
— on which the University has
expended such energy and talent
with such spectacular success —
but also the collapse of any
freshman-year culture require
ment.
The Committee on Undergradu
ate Studies, which received the
task force's report, must face up
to its responsibility if it enacts
such changes.

No reason to
apologize/or
requirement
While David Risser Is correct in
his recent column (Dally. April
17) that the study of "the elite
group of great thinkers" Is an
important function of any great

university, he — and many other
students and faculty now speak
ing in defense of the Western
Culture program — seem to
defend it mainly on utilitarian
grounds: that the study of the
great books should be preserved
merely because no scholar is
equipped with a breadth of
knowledge to cover all cultures.
His "defense" of the West's
great books is almost apologetic.
He sees thetr "exclusion" of
women and minorities as equally
important as the texts them
selves.
Coming from a college without
a Western Culture requirement, it
seems strange to me that stu
dents who are fortunate enough
to have such a course do not
realize its importance.
The fact is that such books are
worth learning because:
□ Like it or not, Africa has no
Dante: Latin America no Homer.
We don't read the great books
because of the author's ethnicity,
but because they say something
important and true about who we
are and why we are here. It so
happens that these "ethnocen
tric" writers and thinkers have
said it better than anyone else so
far.
□ Although it is important to
have knowledge of other cultures,
the priority should be knowledge
of one's own background. Sadly,
evidence has shown that even at
the best universities, the majority
of students enter without
knowing much about our cul
ture's past — and then, not sur
prisingly. proceed to act in ignor
ance of it. To instruct students in
its flaws with equal fervor as they
are instructed in its virtues is to
impress upon their minds that
what they are learning is
meaningless. And to declare that
students should better study
Tanzanian music or Sri Lankan
anthropology rather than Plato
and Aristotle is theft of tuition
money.
□ And finally, in response to
the inevitable argument "Who's to
say that one culture is better than
another?", the answer is: reality.
Ideas have consequences, and the
society we live in is a result of its
cultural foundations. The "West"
has the greatest degree of both
material affluence and political
freedom (including women's
rights) in the world, and this is
not mere coincidence. We are in a
Western society, and if liking that
fact Is "ethnoeentrlsm." then let
us make the most of It.

Focus on our
own heritage
On the very day the Western
Culture Task Force proposed that
the University water down the
Area One requirement by bring
ing in material about minorities,
the Third World, etc. (What will
go: the Bible, Plato, Shake
speare?), James Reston la
mented, "It is probably not too
much to say that the present
generation is now coming out of
school with no common body of
knowledge, no common moral
and intellectual discipline and no
common faith" (Daily, April 14).
Two books already rated as
classics: "Habits of the Heart" by
Robert Bellah and associates, and
"The Closing of the American
Mind: How Higher Education has
Failed Democracy and Im
poverished the Souls of Today's
Students" by Allan Bloom, spell
out the reasons for the disaster.
Bloom, who is compared with
Nietzsche for verve and impact by
the prestigious French magazine
"I'Express", carefully
demonstrates how the shallow
pluralism pushed by the task
force has led to indifference to all
cultures — not just our own.
People without a deep sense of
identity can't take anything very
seriously.
Bloom observes that all the
other cultures are very aware of
who they are — even selfishly —
and that we are the only boobs
who are emptying ourselves in
the name of some crazy un
realizable universalism. Which
doesn't mean we shouldn't be
open In good time to all sorts of
other traditions or problems of
people. But in psychic growth, as
in plant growth, a trunk — one's
own heritage — precedes the
spreading branches. Skip that
phase and you get what we've got
and are asked to get more of:
practically nothing.
"L'Express" also featured an
article by Alain Besancon (the
successor of Raymond Aron)
called "Signes Favorables". which
states there are many books. TV
programs, articles and talks indi
cating a swing back to main
stream values and common sense
— Including the literary realm —
in France.
Ideology such as Marxism,
deconstruction and general criti
cal Byzantlsm are out as are the
sillier forms of modern art.

Task force's
ideas would
end program
The recommendations of the
Western Culture Task Force are
disastrous because they blur the
focus of Western Culture, make
conscientious coverage from the
ancient to the modern period
impossible and change the char
acter of the course to so-called
"cultural history."
I know that I speak for many
when I say — flatly and categori
cally — that I would not teach
such a course. I am not trained as
a social scientist and do not wish
to be retrained thus. I could not
teach such a course conscien
tiously or in good conscience.
I cannot imagine revising the
English track "Literature and the
Arts in Western Culture" along
the lines suggested by the task
force without gutting the course.
And I see no way to staff such an
artificially concocted course (if it
existed) with appropriate faculty.
The requirement for a substan
tial number of works by women
and minorities — coupled with
the geographic requirement of
balancing a European culture
with a non-European one —
means that the 500-year coverage
will have to be the modern period.
I think it no rhetorical hyper
bole that the adoption of the task
force's recommendation would
presage not just the collapse of
the Western Culture requirement
— on which the University has
expended such energy and talent
with such spectacular success —
but also the collapse of any
freshman-year culture require
ment.
The Committee on Undergradu
ate Studies, which received the
task force's report, must face up
to its responsibility if it enacts
such changes.

No reason to
apologize/or
requirement
While David Risser Is correct in
his recent column (Dally. April
17) that the study of "the elite
group of great thinkers" Is an
important function of any great

university, he — and many other
students and faculty now speak
ing in defense of the Western
Culture program — seem to
defend it mainly on utilitarian
grounds: that the study of the
great books should be preserved
merely because no scholar is
equipped with a breadth of
knowledge to cover all cultures.
His "defense" of the West's
great books is almost apologetic.
He sees thetr "exclusion" of
women and minorities as equally
important as the texts them
selves.
Coming from a college without
a Western Culture requirement, it
seems strange to me that stu
dents who are fortunate enough
to have such a course do not
realize its importance.
The fact is that such books are
worth learning because:
□ Like it or not, Africa has no
Dante: Latin America no Homer.
We don't read the great books
because of the author's ethnicity,
but because they say something
important and true about who we
are and why we are here. It so
happens that these "ethnocen
tric" writers and thinkers have
said it better than anyone else so
far.
□ Although it is important to
have knowledge of other cultures,
the priority should be knowledge
of one's own background. Sadly,
evidence has shown that even at
the best universities, the majority
of students enter without
knowing much about our cul
ture's past — and then, not sur
prisingly. proceed to act in ignor
ance of it. To instruct students in
its flaws with equal fervor as they
are instructed in its virtues is to
impress upon their minds that
what they are learning is
meaningless. And to declare that
students should better study
Tanzanian music or Sri Lankan
anthropology rather than Plato
and Aristotle is theft of tuition
money.
□ And finally, in response to
the inevitable argument "Who's to
say that one culture is better than
another?", the answer is: reality.
Ideas have consequences, and the
society we live in is a result of its
cultural foundations. The "West"
has the greatest degree of both
material affluence and political
freedom (including women's
rights) in the world, and this is
not mere coincidence. We are in a
Western society, and if liking that
fact Is "ethnoeentrlsm." then let
us make the most of It.

Focus on our
own heritage
On the very day the Western
Culture Task Force proposed that
the University water down the
Area One requirement by bring
ing in material about minorities,
the Third World, etc. (What will
go: the Bible, Plato, Shake
speare?), James Reston la
mented, "It is probably not too
much to say that the present
generation is now coming out of
school with no common body of
knowledge, no common moral
and intellectual discipline and no
common faith" (Daily, April 14).
Two books already rated as
classics: "Habits of the Heart" by
Robert Bellah and associates, and
"The Closing of the American
Mind: How Higher Education has
Failed Democracy and Im
poverished the Souls of Today's
Students" by Allan Bloom, spell
out the reasons for the disaster.
Bloom, who is compared with
Nietzsche for verve and impact by
the prestigious French magazine
"I'Express", carefully
demonstrates how the shallow
pluralism pushed by the task
force has led to indifference to all
cultures — not just our own.
People without a deep sense of
identity can't take anything very
seriously.
Bloom observes that all the
other cultures are very aware of
who they are — even selfishly —
and that we are the only boobs
who are emptying ourselves in
the name of some crazy un
realizable universalism. Which
doesn't mean we shouldn't be
open In good time to all sorts of
other traditions or problems of
people. But in psychic growth, as
in plant growth, a trunk — one's
own heritage — precedes the
spreading branches. Skip that
