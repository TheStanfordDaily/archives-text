# The
						things I hate most

Do you know what the definition of "column" is?
Well, it's not — as you might think — a carefully
thought-out work of opinion literature. Nope.
Columns are really a place for a lucky few to tell what
really pisses them off. In my past columns, I've writ
ten that University Food Service, the Concert Net
work and the campus parking situation all irk me.
Well, I just realized that if I focus on one irritation
per column, I'll never get them all out. So here's a
catch-all column of the top 10 things at Stanford
that piss me off. Starting from No. 10, in the tradi
tion of David Letterman:

No. 10: Library monitors.
These are among the cushiest jobs on campus, but
they bug me because of how you get them. Say you go
to work for a library — Green, for example. Over the
years, you learn everything the Dewey Decimal Sys
tem has to offer, how to find a 170-year-old parch
ment scroll in a massive place like the library and
maybe even how to use the command mode on
Socrates.
In short, you're a highly skilled person. What does
your boss do? He hands you a clicker and tells you to
sit all day checking IDs. Now that's efficient use of
labor. A baboon could do the job. Maybe that's why
the Japanese are making better cars.
No. 9: Lake Lag.
This is a cool place to hang out during the spring,
but I have a few problems with it. First of all, this
body of water is a pond — not a lake or even a "little
lake."
Calling it a lake is like naming a bookmobile the
Reagan Library and parking it out behind Tresidder.
(Say, that's not a bad. . .)
The second thing that bothers me here is the
"lake" itself. Picture this: you're out on a sailboat, the
sun's beating down on your head, you're sweaty,
smelly. So you dive headfirst into the lake only to
come up with a mouthful of mud and tadpoles, a
sprained neck and a half-dozen leeches clinging to
your body. Come on, put some more water in the
damned pond.
No. 8: University Food Service.
I couldn't resist.
No. 7: Excessive dorm charges.
The University has quite a little scam going here.
Students get charged *100 for rearranging the
furniture in a lounge, *50 for not cleaning the pop

corn out of the cracks in the sofas, <>25 for debunk
ing beds — $4 per little metal bed cap — and on and
on. And God help your dorm if it should break a win
dow.
No. 6: Daily columns.
It's kind of ironic, but I hate reading Daily
columns; I don't even read mine. They make me sick.
They're stupid, inane and often boring.
About the only time I resort to reading them is
after I've thoroughly combed the field hockey box
scores halfway through a two-hour class.
No. 5: SUNet.
I dunno. Maybe I'm different. But I think if Stan
ford is going to invest in a cable TV channel it should
be HBO — not SUNet. I'd rather see things like the
Hagler-Leonard fight than EE 106 any day.
No. 4: Classes.
There's nothing that ruins a good spring quarter
at Stanford more than a class, or, worse yet, several
classes. (To be fair, this excludes windsurfing,
sailing, ultimate frisbee, etc.)
No. 3: Hanging worms.
I guess I believe that all of God's creatures deserve
to live. But these damned hanging worms take It too
far. They piss me off because I don't understand
what they're after.
What the hell are these things, anyway? Baby but
terflies? Banana slugs? Where do they go? Why do
they hang from the trees? What do they want with
our hair? Why don't the squirrels eat them? Not
knowing pisses me off.
No. 2: The squirrels.
They should eat the worms.
And the No. 1 thing that pisses me off is .. . the
ASSU spring elections.
It was close between this one and the worms for
No. 1. I had to give the nod to the elections, though.
This is a nasty process.
At midnight on the fated day that campaigning
begins, thousands of pounds of paper, cardboard
and wood get plastered to everything from bathroom
stalls to the walls in White Plaza.
Yeah, OK, it's nice — even kind of funny — for a
day or two. You read fliers promising nothing differ
ent than what fliers have been promising for the last
five years. Maybe you even remember the name of the
senate candidate whose fliers feature the stomping
dinosaur picture or a cartoon of a woman ripping up
the ASSU bylaws.
But it gets tiring pretty soon. In the end you vote
more for your fee refund than because you give a shit
about next year's bureaucrats. There's got to be a
better way. Maybe they should give senate seats to
the 20 people who collected the most hanging
worms.
