# Senate debates student role in CIR
## CIR chairman urges senators to wait for new divestment guidelines 
### MARK LAWRENCE Senior staff writer 
Frederick Hillier, chairman of the Commit
ter on Investment Responsibility (CIR), last
night urged the ASSU Senate to postpone a
decision on whether to appoint new student
members to the CIR until after that committee
submits to the University Board of Trustees a
new set of divestment guidelines.

News analysis

Although he would not elaborate on the
guidelines, Hillier said they would, if adopted
by the trustees, accelerate the pace of Univer
sity decision-making on investment policy and
lead to a flurry of divestment from companies

that Stanford decides are not promoting racial
equality in South Africa.
The senate is scheduled to consider at its
meeting tonight a proposal that the ASSU
protest the pace of University implementation
of its selective divestment policy by not ap
pointing students to the CIR for the 1987-88
school year.
The senate motion is sponsored by senator
John van Loben Sels, a senior, who resigned
from the CIR last week. Van Loben Sels
charged that the trustees maintain the CIR
only in order to give the impression that they
value recommendations of the students, fac
ulty, staff and alumni who comprise the 12-
member committee.
Hillier said it is a case of bad timing that the
ASSU is planning to consider van Loben Sels'
proposal less than a week before the CIR will
release details of the new guidelines. He said

the CIR will complete the guidelines at Its
meeting tommorrow and make them public
later in the week.
The new guidelines, which will be submitted
to the trustees* at their meeting next month,
ask the trustees to adopt a policy of consider
ing divestment based on a company's Sullivan
rating. Hillier said. The Sullivan Principles are
a set of standards for corporate activity in
South Africa designed to promote racial
equality.
The CIR and the trustees' Special Committee
on Investment Responsibility (SCIR), which
makes Stanford's final investment decisions,
now consider each company's performance in
dividually, a process that takes much more
time than would applying a formula based on a
company's Sullivan rating.
Van Loben Sels and other critics of the
University's divestment policy say that the
case-by-case evaluations slow down the
process so much that the entire process is
ineffective.
If the SCIR accepts the new guidelines,
Hillier said, lengthy discussion of some
companies will not be necessary since new
criteria would "trigger" divestment from
companies with low Sullivan ratings.
At tonight's senate meeting, debate will
center on whether the ClR's recommen
dations on University investment policy
have an impact on the trustees' divestment
decisions.
In announcing his resignation from the
CIR last week, van Loben Sels said the CIR

Is "not a serious attempt to institute a
legitimate selective divestment policy."
But members of the SCIR say that al
though the two committees sometimes
come to different conclusions, the ClR's
recommendations are nevertheless useful
in implementing Stanford's selective divest
ment policy.
One of the two remaining student mem
bers of the CIR, business school student
Bart Narder, takes a position somewhere
between these two extremes. He says the
SCIR has little regard for the ClR's recom
mendations, but he believes student input
on the CIR is valuable nonetheless.
"If I felt that the SCIR was totally using us
as a tool to hoodwink the University, I'd
resign," Narder said.
"The SCIR assumes a company is inno
cent until proven guilty," Narder said. "The
CIR assumes it's guilty until proven inno
cent."
