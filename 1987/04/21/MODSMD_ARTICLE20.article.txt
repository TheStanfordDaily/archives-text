## Aikido helps to find harmony in life at Stanford 
### CALISA COLE 
On the sunlit wrestling mats In Enclna
Gym at noon, 20 barefoot students kneel
before the Instructor. Some are In shorts
and t-shirts, others In sweat pants. Most
are wearing the traditional gi (white
loose-fitting pants and top) or hakama (a
formal Japanese ankle-length skirt) with
belts of white, blue, brown or black.
Instructor Frank Doran demonstrates a
technique called "shiho-nage" to the
group. In this move, a student playing the
role of attacker steps forward and at
tempts to strike Doran. In one swift move
ment, Doran redirects the attacker's mo
mentum. and the attacker is left lying on
the mat.

"Let's try that," says Doran. The stu
dents bow to him, and then to each other.
They pair up, rise and practice the tech
nique. A few minutes later, a clap of the
hands by Doran returns the group to the
kneeling line.
"Have you ever been windsurfing?
Sailing? Skiing? Those are examples of
going with the flow," says Doran to the
group that includes beginners as well as
experienced students. "If you don't know,
Mother Nature will teach you. You can't
muscle Mother Nature. It's the same thing
here. Try to keep the motion going. That's
nature's way. One steady roll, consistent."
The class is studying Aikido, a
Japanese art of self-defense. The word
Aikido comes from ai meaning

"harmony," ki, which means "the forces
of nature and life energy," and do,
meaning "way of life."
Founded in the early 1900s by martial
artist Morihei Ueshiba, Aikido Is a
reflexive rather than offensive art. Ues
hiba, after spending many years studying
traditional martial arts, developed Aikido
from his belief that the true meaning of
martial arts is to protect.
According to followers of the form, there
is no attack in Aikido. Through Aikido
techniques, violent aggression can be
neutralized in a swift and controlled man
ner. Not only is the defender not harmed,
but the attacker also is not inflicted with
serious Injury. This reflects Ueshiba's
philosophy of protection, which extends

even to the aggressor.
In a addition to studying a physical art,
Aikido students learn about their own
mental processes. Aikido teaches that
mental tension produces corresponding
physical tenseness, and vice versa. Stu
dents learn to "center" their bodies so
that gravity supports them, rather than
fights against them.
This centering is mental as well as
physical, and can be a defense against all
conflict. "When the mind and body are
jointly relaxed and centered, a superior
form of functioning begins to manifest it
self in the student." states a brochure
published by Aikido West, a training cen
ter in Redwood City.
Lisa Bauer, a first-year student at the

Graduate School of Business, started
Aikldo training four years ago while an
undergraduate here. She currently trains
with Doran four to five times a week.
Bauer cites two reasons for her Aikido
training.
"First, there's a meditative aspect that
carries over into my everyday life. When I
was an undergraduate, studying took a
lot of effort," she says.
"Through Aikido, I'm finding that in
business school, which is 20 units a
term, studying is less of an effort because
I'm not fighting against it. I'm going with
the flow. Aikido allows me to handle day
to-day stress. Little things don't get to me
anymore."
