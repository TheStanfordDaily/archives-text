### KATHRYN VER PLOEG 
Dear Bug Me,
Why exactly did Coca-Cola decide to
put calcium in Tab? Don't Tab drinkers
get enough milk? Why is this beverage
singled out for health improvement? Is
this an anti-Diet Coke conspiracy?
Anyway, it doesn't taste as good any
more. M _

Ron Coleman, of Coca-Cola's public rela
tions department, said that the calcium
was added "because the profile of the Tab
drinker most fits the profile of the person
who has the greatest need for calcium in
the diet. Female."
Traditionally, Tab has been a harbinger
beverage. Always riding the evolutionary
wave, it was introduced with 100 percent
cyclamate sweetening, then, after FDA
cyclamate disapproval, switched to pure
saccharin. Now in the NutraSweet era. it
has turned to what it calls a Nutra-
Sweetßlend — saccharin and NutraSweet
— for sweetening.
Dear Bug Me,
Last week when I was walking around
the Quad, I noticed that some of its pillars
are starting to look a little tired. I remem
ber something my Geology 001 professor
said: that the columns in the Quad, in
Jact the whole Quad itself, is being
eroded by the weather and the rain. Is the
Quad going to cave in soon? Should I can
cel my plans to go to graduate school here
at Stanford?

Surely enough, the Quad is weathering
away. The exceedingly weak carbonic acid
found in the mixture of rain water and car
bon dioxide is slowly wearing at the calcite
that is cementing together the sand in the
Quad's sandstone.
But fear not. As Gordon Brown, the cur
rent Geology 001 professor and chairman
of the Geology Department says. "Oh, it'll
be thousands of years before it completely
dissolves. Long after we're gone."
In fact, you're probably better off going
to graduate school here than you would be
back East. Years of burning dirty (pyrite
loaded) coal has led to major concentra
tions of sulfuric acid in the rain (acid
rain), doing a more serious number on the
East Coast buildings than our carbonic
acid could ever aspire to.
