## Cardinal nine defeats Cal, increases lead McDowell tosses six-hit complete game in 6-1 win 
### TOM SENF Senior staff writer 
Last weekend against Arizona, Stan
ford played the score-a-lot, give-up-a-lot
game made famous in the Pacific 10
Southern Division by Arizona State and
continued this year by UCLA. But yester
day against California, Stanford went
back to its traditional strengths — pitch
ing and defense — to post a 6-1 victory at
Sunken Diamond.
After giving up 17 runs (12 earned) in
his last 7 1/3 innings during losses to
UCLA and Arizona, Jack McDowell was
back in command yesterday, throwing a
complete-game six-hitter to raise his
record to 6-3 on the year. Because he
threw just four innings against Arizona
last Thursday, McDowell was able to come
back yesterday.
"I wasn't concerned." the junior right
hander said about his last two outings.
"UCLA just hit me, even though I had
good stuff. That's the first time that's
happened, but when you go through the
Pac-10, it will happen at least once in
three years. In Arizona, if our infielders
make a couple of tough plays, no runs get
scored."
McDowell didn't seem worried, but
Stanford Coach Mark Marquess gave him
away. "He was chomping at the bit to
pitch," Marquess said. "He was really
excited about pitching today. He thought
he had something to prove, I guess."
One thing McDowell proved was that he
can win without a 90-plus mph fastball.
His short rest took away some of his heat,
but he made up for it with his slider and
split-fingered fastball.
"When your bats go sour (Cal scored
just 11 runs in three games against USC
last weekend), you don't want to run into
McDowell," Cal Asst. Coach John Hughes
said. "His breaking balls were as good as
I've seen from him."
And his fastball was not useless by any
means. "That was probably the best
movement on my fastball all year,"
McDowell said.
Stanford had trouble defensively last
weekend at Arizona, but the Cardinal

backed McDowell with some fine plays
yesterday. McDowell helped himself by
picking Charlie Bonney off first in the
first and third baseman Ed Sprague made
a running throw to nail Todd Mayo on a
two-strike bunt in the third.
The Cardinal came up with two more
gems in the sixth. Frank Carey made a
diving stop on Bonney's smash up the
middle to record the first out, and with
two on and two out, first baseman Ron
Witmeyer snuck in behind Cal shortstop
Jeff Kent at first to take a perfect pickoff
throw from catcher Doug Robbins to end
the inning.
Robbins snuffed out another Cal rally
in the seventh when he cut down Brad
DeJardin trying to steal second.
The Cardinal attributed most of its
problems last weekend to the playing con
ditions at Arizona's Sancet Field, which
should probably be called Sancet Quarry.
"Ours (Sunken Diamond) is like playing
in the living room, and theirs (Arizona's)
is like a backyard full of rocks," Robbins
said.
"We've been pretty solid defensively all
year," McDowell said. "Arizona is like
playing on Astroturf with bad hops. It's
(with the Stanford defense) not like
throwing a groundball and holding your
breath or anything."
Even Marquess, usually slow to make
excuses or criticize another facility, had
something to say about the Wildcats' dia
mond. "That field is torture," he said.
Unlike McDowell, Cal starter Travis Wil
lis did not have the luxury of tight
defense. With Sprague at second in the
third, Kent threw Robbins' routine
grounder past first baseman John Correa
to allow Sprague to score and prolong the
inning enough for Paul Carey to deliver an
RBI single up the middle.
The Bears' only run was earned but less
than deserved. Kent drew a walk with one
out in the fourth, then went all the way to
third on a wild pitch and scored on a
DeJardin groundout.
Sprague put the Cardinal ahead 3-1
with an RBI single to left in the fifth, and
Stanford put it away with three more
runs in the eighth.

Witmeyer bounced a two-out single up
the middle off reliever Fred Corral to score
Paul Carey, and after Frank Carey walked,
Kent committed his third error of the day
on a David Esquer grounder that brought
Witmeyer across. Ruben Amaro then
closed out the scoring with an RBI double
to left.
McDowell was happy to have the three
extra runs and couldn't resist getting in a
dig at the last-place (6-14 in the Six-Pac)
Bears. "That just buries them," he said.
"It shows them they don't have a shot to

come back. They had been pretty vocal,
but that shut them up . . . not that they
have anything to talk about."
Stanford will play its fifth game in six
days today when it meets San Jose State
at San Jose Municipal Stadium at 1 p.m.
Marquess plans to use four or five
pitchers for a couple innings apiece. Jim
Price, Rob Wassenaar and A 1 Osuna are
three of the most likely candidates to see
action. The Spartans are 27-19 on the
year, 6-6 in the Pacific Coast Athletic As
sociation.

Card notes
Stanford is now a game-and-a-half ahead of
UCLA in the Six-Pac with a 15-5 record to the
Bruins' 14-7. The Cardinal has won 15 of its
last 18 league games.
All four of Stanford's RBls yesterday came
with two outs. "We've done that all year."
Marquess said of the Cardinal's clutch hitting.
"This team has been as good as any we've had
at getting two-out hits."

Last weekend against Arizona, Stan
ford played the score-a-lot, give-up-a-lot
game made famous in the Pacific 10
Southern Division by Arizona State and
continued this year by UCLA. But yester
day against California, Stanford went
back to its traditional strengths — pitch
ing and defense — to post a 6-1 victory at
Sunken Diamond.
After giving up 17 runs (12 earned) in
his last 7 1/3 innings during losses to
UCLA and Arizona, Jack McDowell was
back in command yesterday, throwing a
complete-game six-hitter to raise his
record to 6-3 on the year. Because he
threw just four innings against Arizona
last Thursday, McDowell was able to come
back yesterday.
"I wasn't concerned." the junior right
hander said about his last two outings.
"UCLA just hit me, even though I had
good stuff. That's the first time that's
happened, but when you go through the
Pac-10, it will happen at least once in
three years. In Arizona, if our infielders
make a couple of tough plays, no runs get
scored."
McDowell didn't seem worried, but
Stanford Coach Mark Marquess gave him
away. "He was chomping at the bit to
pitch," Marquess said. "He was really
excited about pitching today. He thought
he had something to prove, I guess."
One thing McDowell proved was that he
can win without a 90-plus mph fastball.
His short rest took away some of his heat,
but he made up for it with his slider and
split-fingered fastball.
"When your bats go sour (Cal scored
just 11 runs in three games against USC
last weekend), you don't want to run into
McDowell," Cal Asst. Coach John Hughes
said. "His breaking balls were as good as
I've seen from him."
And his fastball was not useless by any
means. "That was probably the best
movement on my fastball all year,"
McDowell said.
Stanford had trouble defensively last
weekend at Arizona, but the Cardinal

backed McDowell with some fine plays
yesterday. McDowell helped himself by
picking Charlie Bonney off first in the
first and third baseman Ed Sprague made
a running throw to nail Todd Mayo on a
two-strike bunt in the third.
The Cardinal came up with two more
gems in the sixth. Frank Carey made a
diving stop on Bonney's smash up the
middle to record the first out, and with
two on and two out, first baseman Ron
Witmeyer snuck in behind Cal shortstop
Jeff Kent at first to take a perfect pickoff
throw from catcher Doug Robbins to end
the inning.
Robbins snuffed out another Cal rally
in the seventh when he cut down Brad
DeJardin trying to steal second.
The Cardinal attributed most of its
problems last weekend to the playing con
ditions at Arizona's Sancet Field, which
should probably be called Sancet Quarry.
"Ours (Sunken Diamond) is like playing
in the living room, and theirs (Arizona's)
is like a backyard full of rocks," Robbins
said.
"We've been pretty solid defensively all
year," McDowell said. "Arizona is like
playing on Astroturf with bad hops. It's
(with the Stanford defense) not like
throwing a groundball and holding your
breath or anything."
Even Marquess, usually slow to make
excuses or criticize another facility, had
something to say about the Wildcats' dia
mond. "That field is torture," he said.
Unlike McDowell, Cal starter Travis Wil
lis did not have the luxury of tight
defense. With Sprague at second in the
third, Kent threw Robbins' routine
grounder past first baseman John Correa
to allow Sprague to score and prolong the
inning enough for Paul Carey to deliver an
RBI single up the middle.
The Bears' only run was earned but less
than deserved. Kent drew a walk with one
out in the fourth, then went all the way to
third on a wild pitch and scored on a
DeJardin groundout.
Sprague put the Cardinal ahead 3-1
with an RBI single to left in the fifth, and
Stanford put it away with three more
runs in the eighth.

Witmeyer bounced a two-out single up
the middle off reliever Fred Corral to score
Paul Carey, and after Frank Carey walked,
Kent committed his third error of the day
on a David Esquer grounder that brought
Witmeyer across. Ruben Amaro then
closed out the scoring with an RBI double
to left.
McDowell was happy to have the three
extra runs and couldn't resist getting in a
dig at the last-place (6-14 in the Six-Pac)
Bears. "That just buries them," he said.
"It shows them they don't have a shot to

come back. They had been pretty vocal,
but that shut them up . . . not that they
have anything to talk about."
Stanford will play its fifth game in six
days today when it meets San Jose State
at San Jose Municipal Stadium at 1 p.m.
Marquess plans to use four or five
pitchers for a couple innings apiece. Jim
Price, Rob Wassenaar and A 1 Osuna are
three of the most likely candidates to see
action. The Spartans are 27-19 on the
year, 6-6 in the Pacific Coast Athletic As
sociation.

Card notes
Stanford is now a game-and-a-half ahead of
UCLA in the Six-Pac with a 15-5 record to the
Bruins' 14-7. The Cardinal has won 15 of its
last 18 league games.
All four of Stanford's RBls yesterday came
with two outs. "We've done that all year."
Marquess said of the Cardinal's clutch hitting.
"This team has been as good as any we've had
at getting two-out hits."
