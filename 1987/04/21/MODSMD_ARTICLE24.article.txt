# Sailors finish tied with California
## 
### HUGH BETHELL Editorial staff 
In a disappointing end to the Northern California
Racing Series, the Stanford sailing team took second
and third place behind a pair of sailors from Califor
nia this weekend In the series' ninth regatta. As a
result, the Cardinal finished the series In an un
breakable tie for first place with its rivals from across
the bay.
At the series' earlier regattas, which have been
held over the last two months, Stanford sailors often
found themselves outnumbered by the Bears. That
was not the case this weekend, however, as 18 Card
inal sailors competed on the waters off Berkeley
against seven other schools, in conditions that
ranged from light breezes and medium-sized waves
to near gale-force winds and large, breaking swells.
According to Stanford Coach Blake Middleton, the
team sailed very well overall, but no one Cardinal
boat was consistent enough to top the best boat from
Cal.
"We had some problems with inconsistency, but
overall, everyone on the team performed strongly. As
a team, we really outdid Cal, and we only lost the
regatta because we couldn't consistently beat their
top boat," Middleton said.
Stanford's top boat, sailed by junior Drew Gashler
and senior Kristen Boyles in the A division and by
senior Tom Kuhnle and sophomore Rita Snape in
the B division, came very close to capturing overall
victory in the regatta, finishing only six points out of
first place.
The second Cardinal scoring boat also turned in a
strong performance, as juniors Dan Buckstaff and
Kathleen Mallery teamed up with juniors Doug
Hagen and Gina Ottoboni to take third place, 21
points ahead of a team from Cal that took fourth.
In addition, sophomore Brad Swett and senior
Kari Evans paired up with freshman A 1 Sargent and
junior Jen Brokaw to take fifth place, and freshman
Robert Brown and sophomore Helen Wllley joined
junior There DuPont and freshman Kim Grosse in a
sixth-place performance.
While Stanford's second, third, fifth and sixth
place finishes at the regatta proved the team's
strength and depth, they could not lift the Cardinal
from a 4-4 tie with the Bears in the overall series'
standings. Both teams had the same number of vic
tories and second-place finishes, so the tie is consid
ered unbreakable.
Though the Stanford team was disappointed with
the close loss, the sailors were pleased with the
practice they got in preparation for next weekend's
Pacific Coast Championships, which will be held at
Berkeley under a similar format.
"It was great training for our sailors, because they
got to sail in winds from five to 25 knots and waves of
all sizes â€” the kind of waves we don't get in Redwood
City. We should be well prepared for the PCC regatta
next weekend." Middleton said.
The regatta's building winds and waves also led to
new Cardinal combinations, as heavyweights who
normally sail as skippers took their turns as crews In
order to get more weight into the boats during the
last races. DuPont. who had skippered the first six
races, spent the last two getting a crew's bruises with
skipper Hagen.
"It was great going upwind, but we were a little too
heavy when going downwind. Still, it was great to
sail with Doug. It's something I've wanted to do for a
long time." DuPont said.

the Northern California Racing Series this weekend at Berkeley. Sophomore Brad Swett and senior Kari
Evans (left) were fifth.
"The team has been sailing
really well, and I'm confident that
we'll be well-prepared when we get
to the PCC regatta next weekend.
Our top skippers are better than
they look," Brokaw said.
