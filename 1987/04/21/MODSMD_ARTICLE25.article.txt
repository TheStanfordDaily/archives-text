# Seko, Mota win Boston Marathon

BOSTON (AP) — Japan's Toshihiko Seko
broke away from the pack going up Heartbreak
Hill and won the Boston Marathon for the
second time yesterday in a slowly paced race
featuring an elite field and marred by two acci
dents.
For the 30-year-old Seko, the winner in 1981,
it was his eighth victory in his last nine mara
thons. But his time of 2 hours, 11 minutes, 50
seconds, was disappointing in view of the ex
pected fast race.
Meanwhile, 1984 Olympic bronze medalist
Rosa Mota, running the Boston Marathon for
the first time, was the first women's finisher,
clocking 2:25:21, the third-fastest ever by a
woman in this race. She led all the way and
never was threatened in posting her seventh
victory in 10 marathons.
Seko's only marathon defeat since 1979,
after he finished third in his first Boston Mara
thon, came in the 1984 Olympics at Los An
geles, where he finished 14th.
This victory was surprisingly easy, in view of
the quality of the field, considered one of the
best — if not the best — ever assembled in this
91st running of the Boston Marathon. It in
cluded defending champion Rob de Castella of
Australia, ranked No. 2 in the world; Juma
Ikangaa of Tanzania, ranked No. 1; Steve Jones
of Wales, ranked No. 1 in 1985 and the second
fastest marathoner in history; Olympic silver
medalist John Treacy of Ireland, and two-time
Boston winner Geoff Smith of England.
But once Seko, the world's fourth-ranked
marathoner, made his decisive surge at the
"killer" point of the race with about six miles to
go, he was in command. He won by 47 seconds
over Jones, who clocked in at 2:12:37.
Smith wound up third in 2:12:42 and Dave
Gordon of Eugene, Ore., was fourth in 2:13:30.
De Castella, finishing sixth, nearly met dis
aster at the outset.
Race officials were slow in getting the rope
out of the way of the starters as the race was
about to begin. De Castella tripped over the
rope and tumbled, scraping his hands and
knees. After rolling over and nearly getting
trampled by the stampede of runners — there
were 6,313 entrants — he got up quickly and
resumed running.
The other incident occurred shortly after the
start of the wheelchair division, which began
15 minutes before the open competition. Four
wheelchairs collided, knocking two of the com
petitors out of the race with minor abrasions.
Of the two that continued, Jim Knaub, the
1982 and 1983 wheelchair champion, eventu
ally dropped out, near the 10-mile point.
In the open race, Ikangaa. Jones and Smith
were expected to set a blistering pace, but none
made any attempt to do it.
After receiving the winner's laurel wreath,
Seko said through an interpreter. "I was very
anxious to establish a world record, but the
headwind bothered me. . . . That's why the
race was so slow."
