# Men's, women's crew each win one, lose two
## 
### CHRIS CRADER Staff writer 
Friday afternoon began looking
like the beginning of a great
weekend for the men's and
women's crew teams; unfortun
ately, looks can be deceiving.
In the first round of the Red
wood Shores-Stanford Rowing
Classic, the men's varsity beat
Dartmouth and the women's var
sity beat California — but then
things turned downhill. The men
fell to Washington and defending
national champion Wisconsin on
Saturday, while the women lost to
both Radcliffe and Princeton.
Also on the men's side, the

junior varsity fell to Wisconsin,
and the novice boat was edged out
by Cal. but the freshman boat
came back to beat the Bears.
For the women, the junior var
sity lost to Santa Clara, but the
frosh boat turned the tables,
beating the Broncos.
The format was an interesting
form of torture where each crew
rowed three times in 30 hours.
The Brown men and the Washing
ton women seemed to fare the
best, as both were undefeated over
the two days.
In the men's races, Cal and
Washington went 2-1, while both
Wisconsin and Stanford finished
at 1-2.
