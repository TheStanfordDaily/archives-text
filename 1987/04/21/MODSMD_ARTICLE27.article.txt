### WITOLD HENISZ Staff writer 
The No. 1 rider on the Stanford cycling team,
Tom Moyer, said repeatedly this past weekend
that the team could not expect to do well enough
to close the gap on its rivals. Moyer proved himself
wrong.
Saturday at the UCLA criterium, Moyer scored
in five of six primes and won the field sprint. Sun
day, at the San Diego State criterium. Moyer
dominated the sprints and finished in second
place behind victorious Stanford rider John
Coyle.
Led by Moyer's strong showing, the Cardinal
closed a 147-point gap between itself and first
place to 55.
Stanford now rests in striking distance of first
place in the Western Collegiate Cycling Confer
ence.

In the Braces. Hank Dart came from the back of
the pack in a tight field sprint to claim victory on
Saturday. Also in the points at the finish and in
the primes were Brian Bauer and Brock La Porte.
On Sunday it was La Porte's turn in the
limelight. After catching a breakaway group with
only a lap to go, La Porte surged forward in the
final 500 yards for second place. Dart, who already
scored in numerous primes, finished in seventh.
The women of the Stanford cycling team also
fared well. Jennifer Hubbert was second at SDSU
and Laura Rodman scored in the points on both
days.
The C team saw its chances of capturing its first
victory of the season dissipate on Saturday when
Steve Miller was forced into the curb and crashed
with only 300 yards to go. Meanwhile, Hassan
Carrol and Scooter Williams turned in the finest
performances of their careers for third and fifth
places respectively.
