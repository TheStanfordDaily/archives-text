The Medical Center next week
will begin participating In a low
'•ost breast cancer screening
program initiated by the Ameri
can Cancer Society.
The program, called the Smart
Woman Mammography Screen
ing Program. Is designed to
make women aware of the im
portance of undergoing regular
screening for breast cancer, ac
cording to Sandy Malet, assis
tant chief technologist for the
program.
A mammography test consists
of X-raying the breasts to find
any signs of a tumor. Malet said.
She added that the test is impor

tant because it can detect a
tumor much earlier than a self
examination.
Early detection greatly
reduces the cost and importance
of the ensuing treatment, saving
lives and breasts, she said.
The low cost of the service Is
specifically designed to encour
age qualified women to take the
test, Malet said.
The Med Center's fee will be
•50 instead of the usual $140.
According to Malet, the Med
Center plans to run the program
at a loss because "we feel it's
worth it to educate women."
Eligible participants must be
over 35 years old. never have

had a previous exam and have
no current complaints, Malet
said.
"We want the women who
haven't had any treatment," she
said. Malet said this is done to
encourage women who do not
have regular tests to come in for
the first time, she said.
Breast cancer appears most
frequently in women over 35.
According to Malet, a woman
should have a mammography
every two or three years after
this age. After the age of 40. a
test should be taken "at least
every other year," Malet said.
The program will continue
through May.
