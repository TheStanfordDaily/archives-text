# Campus assault cases still unsolved
## 
### A.J. THOMAS Staff writer 
Nothing new has developed in
the investigations of two recent
assaults against women on
campus, although students have
been unusually helpful to police.
Stanford Police Chief Marvin Her
rington said yesterday.
Herrington said police received
three or four calls in the last week
from people who reported seeing
someone fitting the general des
cription of the attacker. Police
have questioned all of the individ
uals but do not consider any of
them suspects, Herrington said.
In both attacks, which occurred

April 8 and April 13 near the
Physics Tank, an unidentified
male attacked a lone woman from
behind using a sharp Instrument.
Although both women managed to
escape quickly, the first victim
received minor cuts.
Because the two victims gave
similar descriptions of their at
tacker. Herrington said police
believe that one man committed
both assaults. The second victim
described her attacker as a white
male in his early 20s, about 5-foot
-11, 160 pounds, of medium build,
with "sandy blond or light brown
hair." The first victim offered a
very similar description, except
that she said her attacker may

have been in his 30s.
Herrington said that since rob
bery was not attempted in either
case, sexual assault was a possible
motive.
Herrington said police were
"doing some extra things" to in
crease campus security, but
declined to elaborate.
"We asked people to call in if
they saw anyone fitting the des
cription who was acting suspici
ously." Herrington said. He
termed the few calls received so far
"encouraging" since "people don't
usually call."
Herrington said the calls indi
cated that "people are aware and
paying more attention."

Eileen McManus, a member of
the Stanford Rape Education Proj
ect. said she felt campus reaction
to the assaults has not been
strong enough.
"I don't see much of a reaction
on campus or people getting angry
about it," she said. "I'd like to see
a rally or something."
"It's difficult to say at this point
whether the individual is still in
this area," Herrington said. "He's
tried twice and hasn't been suc
cessful. He may have moved on."
Herrington said, however, that
the police would put "extra effort
into this as long as we think there
is a chance something will turn
up."
