# Committee blasts task force report
## 
### TOM OSCHERWITZ Staff writer 
The University's Western Cul
ture Programming Committee
(WCPC) yesterday sharply
criticized a recent proposal to
modify the University's current
Western Culture program.
In a letter written on behalf of
the WCPC, chairman Paul Robin
son assailed a proposal submitted
last week by the University task
force on the Area One requirement
for failing "to address the issues of
class, gender and minorities" and
instead emphasizing the issue of
"cultural diversity."
"On the whole ... we did not
find the draft (of the task force) a
promising beginning," according
to the letter.
The task force report calls on
Western Culture tracks to include
study of a non-European culture,
include primary texts by women
and minorities, and abolish the
core list of readings, currently
common to all tracks.
"We believe that the Area One re
quirement should remain a three
quarter course in Western intellec
tual, literary and cultural tradi
tions — that it should not be
changed into a world culture
course or a sequence whose goal is
the study of cultural diversity."
the letter states.
"We think the requirement
ought to remain the requirement
in Western Culture," Robinson
said yesterday.
According to Robinson, the im
pact of the WCPC recommen
dations is likely to be significant
because "the views expressed by
the Western Culture committee
(WCPC) represent far and away

the vast majority of those who
teach in the Western Culture pro
gram."
According to Robinson, the task
force proposal does not address
the main points of contention that
have characterized the debate over
Western Culture in recent years.
He said the task force report
ignores the criticism most com
monly leveled at the current West
ern Culture program, namely that
it "did not do justice to the experi
ence and contributions of women,
minorities and the non-elite."
"The failure to study non-
Western culture" was not the key
item of concern. Robinson added.
Yesterday's WCPC letter argues
that the issue of "cultural diver
sity" — raised by the task force
proposal — would best be ad
dressed by expanding the Univer
sity's non-Western requirement,
not by amending the Western Cul
ture program.
"The systematic study of cul
tural diversity ought to be met not
by abandoning the Western Cul
ture requirement, but by redefin
ing and reorganizing the existing
non-Western requirement," the
WCPC report reads. "Indeed, an
ideal solution would be to in
stitute, in place of the current
grab-bag of courses, a seriously
comparative program, such as
represented by the course, 'The
World Outside the West,' " accord
ing to the letter.
Dean of Undergraduate Studies
Carolyn Lougee, a member of both
the WCPC and the Area One task
force said a concern motivating
the task force's proposal was a
perceived "asymmetry" in how
Western and non-Western
cultures are studied at Stanford.
The study of Western culture Is
"up-front," while the study of non-
Western culture remains in the
background, Lougee said.
Lougee added. "1 suspect that
they (the members of the task
force) will give alot of considera
tion to the Western Culture Pro
gram Committee's recommen
dations."
Lougee said the task force had
anticipated that it might have to
make revisions in its initial pro
posal.
In 1976-77, when the present
Western Culture program was
being formed, "the task force went
through five public statements"
before a proposal passed the Fac

ulty Senate, Lougee said.
On Wednesday, the Committee
on Undergraduate Studies (CUS) .
which initially commissioned the
Area One task force, will "air its
opinion" on the proposal. Lougee
said. Like the WCPC. the CUS will
send its opinions back to the task
force, she added.
The WCPC letter also rejects, al
most point-by-point, many other
task force recommendations.
The letter recommends that
some form of core list of reading
be maintained. "Without a core
list of some sort, the committee
fears that tracks could degenerate
into narrow thematic or discipli
nary enterprise."
The WCPC letter argues that
"the minimum 500-year coverage
proposed in the draft is woefully
inadequate to creating the sense
of historical depth and resonance
that is essential to cultural
literacy."

Robinson said the Western in
tellectual tradition gives one "the
power over one's Intellectual des
tiny."
"If you don't know the stuff,
you're destined to be a victim,"
Robinson said.
The letter also says the current
proposal would threaten the exis
tence of the current Western Cul
ture tracks. "The draft would, in
effect, gut most of the existing
Western Culture tracks, squan
dering the years of work by both
regular faculty and lecturers that
have made those tracks —
whatever their shortcomings —
the most vital element in Stan
ford's general education curricu
lum," Robinson said in the letter.
According to History Prof. Paul
Seaver, chairman of the task
force, the recent proposal does not
threaten the existence or viability
of the existing Western Culture
tracks.
