# Committee blasts task force report
## 
### TOM OSCHERWITZ Staff writer 
The University's Western Cul
ture Programming Committee
(WCPC) yesterday sharply
criticized a recent proposal to
modify the University's current
Western Culture program.
In a letter written on behalf of
the WCPC, chairman Paul Robin
son assailed a proposal submitted
last week by the University task
force on the Area One requirement
for failing "to address the issues of
class, gender and minorities" and
instead emphasizing the issue of
"cultural diversity."
"On the whole ... we did not
find the draft (of the task force) a
promising beginning," according
to the letter.
The task force report calls on
Western Culture tracks to include
study of a non-European culture,
include primary texts by women
and minorities, and abolish the
core list of readings, currently
common to all tracks.
"We believe that the Area One re
quirement should remain a three
quarter course in Western intellec
tual, literary and cultural tradi
tions — that it should not be
changed into a world culture
course or a sequence whose goal is
the study of cultural diversity."
the letter states.
"We think the requirement
ought to remain the requirement
in Western Culture," Robinson
said yesterday.
According to Robinson, the im
pact of the WCPC recommen
dations is likely to be significant
because "the views expressed by
the Western Culture committee
(WCPC) represent far and away

the vast majority of those who
teach in the Western Culture pro
gram."
According to Robinson, the task
force proposal does not address
the main points of contention that
have characterized the debate over
Western Culture in recent years.
He said the task force report
ignores the criticism most com
monly leveled at the current West
ern Culture program, namely that
it "did not do justice to the experi
ence and contributions of women,
minorities and the non-elite."
"The failure to study non-
Western culture" was not the key
item of concern. Robinson added.
Yesterday's WCPC letter argues
that the issue of "cultural diver
sity" — raised by the task force
proposal — would best be ad
dressed by expanding the Univer
sity's non-Western requirement,
not by amending the Western Cul
ture program.
"The systematic study of cul
tural diversity ought to be met not
by abandoning the Western Cul
ture requirement, but by redefin
ing and reorganizing the existing
non-Western requirement," the
WCPC report reads. "Indeed, an
ideal solution would be to in
stitute, in place of the current
grab-bag of courses, a seriously
comparative program, such as
represented by the course, 'The
World Outside the West,' " accord
ing to the letter.
Dean of Undergraduate Studies
Carolyn Lougee, a member of both
the WCPC and the Area One task
force said a concern motivating
the task force's proposal was a
perceived "asymmetry" in how
