### JOHN POLLACK Senior staff writer 
Despite criticism of recently
proposed changes in the Western
Culture program. Black Student
Union (BSU) members yesterday
defended the controversial modifi
cations as both necessary and
realistic.
"Some serious social, political
or economic criticism" is needed
in the current Western Culture
program and the proposed
changes attempt to address this
deficiency, according to Lloyd
Metz, communications intern for
the BSU.
"You just can't ignore" the inter
action between Western and Eas
tern civilizations throughout his
tory, Metz said, citing trade be
tween medieval Italian city-states,
the Middle East and China as an
example.
"They had intellectual inter
change between these places." he
said.
Metz also disputed critics'
claims that Stanford lacks enough
qualified professors to teach the
diversified curriculum called for
by the task force on the Area One

requirement, the University com
mittee that made the recommen
dations.
"We have enough (qualified)
people" said Metz, noting that fac
ulty in the Center for East Asian
Studies and the Afro-American
Studies program are sources of ex
pertise in this area.
Critics of the proposed changes
claim that the texts in the current
core reading list of the Western
Culture program are indispen
sable, that they cannot be
replaced by alternative texts with
out depriving students of material
essential to understanding West
ern culture.
Kathryne Gambrell, an un
declared freshman and BSU mem
ber. disagreed. "I don't think
Western Culture is so crammed
that nothing can be deleted." she
said.
Gambrell noted that currently,
many tracks change five to 10
books on their reading list each
year, and that some of the current
texts are "pretty obscure."
"Some of these texts are not in
dispensable," she said.
Metz agreed with Gambrell.
"Room can be made" for texts em
phasizing the role of women and
people of color, Metz said.
