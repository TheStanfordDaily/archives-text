# Housing lottery begins: Who's the fastest draw in the West?
## 
### MARCUS MABRY Senior staff writer 
With fingers crossed and good luck
charms in hand, students this morning
began filing into the Clubhouse at Old
Union to decidc their fate.
The University Housing Draw — Stan
ford's annual housing raffle — has begun.
The Draw — the process by which stu
dents are assigned to on-campus
residences — will involve more than 4.000
students before it concludes Friday, ac
cording to Rodger Whitney, director of
University Housing.
All students wishing to live in on
campus housing fall quarter, excluding
those who enter fraternities, are required
to enter the Draw.

According to Whitney, changes in this
year's Draw include the addition of
priorities to Hurlburt and Lathrop
Houses for students interested in helping
those houses develop theme programs.
Hurlburt and Lathrop are slated to
become the Russian/East European and
the native American theme house,
respectively, in the fall of 1988.
Another change in the Draw this year is
the addition of priorities to ethnic theme
houses — Okada. Ujamaa and Zapata —
for students who agree to enroll in at least
one dormitory-based course and to be
"active participants in theme activities."
Whitney said.
Whitney said there are usually about
3,300 "assignable spaces" on campus. Ac
cording to Whitney. 1.600 of these spaces

are reserved for incoming freshmen and
many more are set aside for resident as
sistants, academic support staff and
handicapped students.
Students who have guaranteed status
— those who have chosen next year to be
one of the three years in which they are
guaranteed University housing — will
draw from a pool of Draw numbers rang
ing from one to 3.000. Those who have
chosen next year as their unguaranteed
year will draw numbers from 3,001 to
5.000.
On Friday, after all entered students
have drawn their numbers, the University
Housing Center will begin making initial
housing assignments, ending "round
one'\of the Draw.
Starting with students with the lowest

draw numbers, the housing center will
match students with their housing
preferences until all available spaces have
been filled.
After the results of round one are an
nounced sometime in mid-May, a second
round of The Draw will take place, Whit
ney said.
During the period between rounds, stu
dents who have decided to accept bids
from housed fraternities or who have cho
sen to accept their initial housing assign
ments will drop out of the Draw process.
Those students who take no action
after round one will automatically enter
round two and will most likely move up on
the Draw list. Whitney said.
"You can't do any worse. You can only
get assigned to places higher on your pref

erence list," Whitney said.
He urged students to list housing
choices according to where they would
most like to live and not attempt to guess
according to cutoff numbers from last
year's Draw.
Because resident spaces are listed ac
cording to sex and because so many men
drop out after round one to join fraterni
ties or to become RAs, Whitney said, the
housing chances for men usually improve
substantially.
Second-round assignments will be an
nounced soon after Memorial Day, Whit
ney said.
Students still unassigned after round
two can enter a waiting list for housing by
drawing from numbers higher than
5,000.
