Accused war criminal deported
WASHINGTON — Accused Nazi war criminal Karl Linnas was
deported yesterday to the Soviet Union, where he faces a death
sentence for his World War II role as head of an Estonian concen
tration camp where 12,000 people were killed.
The Supreme Court cleared the way yesterday for Linnas' expul
sion, voting 6-3 to deny his request for a delay, effectively ending
his five-year struggle to remain in this country. The justices
issued no opinion with their vote.
Justice Department officials said Linnas was taken from his
New York jail cell by federal agents yesterday afternoon and placed
on the 7:10 p.m. flight of CSA. the Czechoslovakian airline, from
John F. Kennedy International Airport to Prague en route to the
Soviet Union. The plane left JFK at about 8 p.m.
Linnas, in handcuffs and wearing a brown fedora and a suit and
tie, shouted to a group of reporters at the airport that Americans
should consider his deportation to the Soviet Union to be the
equivalent of "murder."
The Linnas case triggered a battle that split the Reagan admin
istration and pitted the Jewish and East European immigrant
communities against one another.
Arafat heads PLO parliament
ALGIERS, Algeria — After four divided years, most of the war
ring factions of the Palestine Liberation Organization met under
the same roof yesterday as a parliament-in-exile, in a move toward
reunification that also involves a realignment of PLO relations
within the Arab world and hardens their terms for peace in the
Middle East.
In a dramatic entrance to a conference hall surrounded by Al
gerian army anti-aircraft emplacements, PLO Chairman Yasser
Arafat was greeted with standing ovations by 1,200 cheering
delegates and guests.
"We now all stand together, united until the final liberation of
Palestine," Arafat told the gathering.
The moment seemed to reflect a personal triumph for Arafat and
a boost to his leadership and his struggle with Syrian President
Hafez Assad for control of key elements of the Palestinian move
ment. Some of the compromises being adopted here to bring more
leftist and radical factions back into the fold, however, could even
further restrict Arafat's influence and ability to negotiate with
Western powers and more moderate Arab states.
Contra-Wells Fargo connection
WASHINGTON — The secret financial network used by the
Nicaraguan rebels to receive and distribute tens of millions of dol
lars in donations after the cutoff of U.S. military aid was set up in
1977 initially to hide the money transferred abroad by wealthy
Nicaraguans fearful of a Sandinista victory, Miami banking
sources say.
According to the sources, the contra network used the same
Cayman Islands bank — Banco de America Central (BAC) — the
same system of Miami "pass through" accounts and Panamanian
shell companies, and perhaps some of the same advisers.
Soon after a stunning Sandinista attack at the Masaya military
barracks 17 miles outside Managua on Oct. 17, 1977, worried
members of Nicaragua's middle and upper classes began looking
for ways to transfer assets out of the country. Representatives of
Managua's Banco de America, then controlled by local sugar inter
ests and Wells Fargo Bank, established BAC as a subsidiary in the
Caymans, a haven with strict laws safeguarding the privacy of
depositors, according to the banking sources.
Alfonsin moves toward peace
BUENOS AIRES, Argentina — Moving to revamp the Army com
mand after an uprising by rebel officers, President Raul Alfonsin
yesterday accepted the resignation of the Army chief of staff amid
indications that other top generals would be pushed into retire
ment.
While government officials denied a deal had been made with
the rebels, who surrendered Sunday when Alfonsin flew to the
base they had occupied, the removal of the Army's commander
had been one of their primary demands.
The government also appeared ready to ask the Supreme Court
to clarify the legal status of junior officers accused of committing
atrocities during the military's crackdown on leftist subversion in
the late 19705. Resentment of the proceedings against several
hundred soldiers that has simmered in the armed forces exploded
last week when middle-ranking officers seized two Army bases, in
sisting on an end to the trials and an amnesty for those charged.
Four-star general dies at 85
WASHINGTON — Gen. Maxwell Taylor, former chairman of the
Joint Chiefs of Staff, one of the nation's most celebrated and con
troversial soldiers, and a central figure in U.S. involvement in the
Vietnam War, died Sunday night at Walter Reed Army Medical
Center.
Taylor, 85, was admitted to Walter Reed in mid-January, and
died of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, commonly known as Lou
Gehrig's disease, the Pentagon said in an announcement yester
day.
Secretary of Defense Caspar Weinberger said that Taylor would
be remembered as "one of the great military men in American his
tory" and that he "epitomized what it means to be a soldier, a
diplomat and a scholar."
A four-star general, he had served as Army chief of staff, com
mander of U.S. forces in Berlin and Korea, superintendent of West
Point and U.S. ambassador to South Vietnam.
His World War II career was studded with stunning exploits. As
a two-star general commanding the 101st Airborne Division in
World War 11. Taylor was the first American general to land in
France when his paratroopers leapfrogged the Allied armies that
stormed ashore on the beaches of Normandy on D-Day, June 6.
1944.
For his exploits behind the German lines in Normandy, Taylor
was awarded the Distinguished Service Cross, the nation's
second-highest decoration for valor.
Captured condor alive and well
SAN DIEGO — The 7-year-old male California condor that until
Sunday was the last of its species remaining in the wild under
went an extensive physical examination in San Diego yesterday
and was pronounced in seemingly good health.
X-rays gave no indication that the giant bird had ingested lead
shot or had any lead in its tissues — a problem that has plagued
other condors. A blood sample is to be analyzed for the presence of
heavy metals or pesticides.
The bird, known as Adult Condor 9. was captured by biologists
Sunday morning. He is now part of the captive breeding program
at the San Diego and Los Angeles zoos, which Includes the 27
remaining birds of the highly endangered species.
Baker said that the bird would spend the next two weeks In the
program's quarantine pen where keepers will keep it under close
observation.
After that the California condor recovery team is expected to de
termine which female condor the new male will be paired with. Al
though the condor breeding season generally ends in April, the
birds will probably be put together to see whether they might mate
eventually.
