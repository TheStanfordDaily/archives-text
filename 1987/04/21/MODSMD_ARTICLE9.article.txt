# ASSU opens new reserves
## 
### DIANE BISGEIER Senior staff writer 
The ASSU will Implement a new sys
tem for Its more than *450,000 In
reserves beginning next year, according
to the ASSU financial manager.
Marlah Dickson said, "The new
structure will ensure that we will always
have enough money In the reserves."
She added that, "It has a formula for
each reserve where the level Is reset each
year to accommodate the upcoming
year."
The ASSU will establish five reserves,
which are to be funded mainly through
the accumulated earnings of profits
generated over and above the ASSU
budget. Council of Presidents member
Carey White emphasized that students'
ASSU fees do not pay for the reserve
funds. According to White, the ASSU
merely redistributes these fees to all of
the student organizations.
The ASSU instead gets Its income
through its banking service, which is
accessible to all student organizations,
and through service projects such as the
Sunday Flicks and lecture notes. "Over
the years we make profits, spend some
and reinvest some," White said.
Dickson attributed the excess amount
of money currently in the ASSU reserves
to its banking system. "We are one of the

few, If any, student governments to pro
vide a bank for other student programs.
That's why we generate so much
money."
She characterized the ASSU as "one of
the most successful and financially sta
ble student governments" in the
country.
Next year's new reserve system will be
composed of the following:
□ The project reserve, set at approxi
mately * 150,000 for 1987-88, will
ensure against any catastrophes or acci
dents in operations. "About 10 years ago
... an ASSU organization established to
bring concerts to the campus lost about
♦ 100,000. We didn't have any system
that would cover that loss," Dickson ex
plained.
The project reserve will be recomputed
annually to equal three times the stan
dard deviation of project Income "over
the fiscal years for which information Is
available," according to the ASSU bill
that proposed the five reserves.
□ An operating reserve of about
♦200,000 will be "a little more than our
portion in operations each year In case
something goes wrong: If the elections
commission goes over budget, for exam
ple," Dickson said. The operating
reserve will be equivalent to 150 percent
of the budgeted operating expenses for
the ASSU for each fiscal year.

□ A special discretionary reserve —
which will contain any ASSU money that
is in excess of its operating budget and
does not need to go to any other reserve
— will serve to maintain the other
reserves. The recent innovations on the
ASSU offices were funded from this
reserve.
"If we have a good year, the same
amount will be allotted to each reserve,"
said Dickson, who explained that the
projections are based not on profits, but
on expenses, which generally do not
decline. "The excess money in the spe
cial discretionary reserve can be spent
by the senate on things we don't budget
for but that are proposed during the
year."
□ Created in the event that ASSU in
vestments or projects fall short of what
is projected for the operating budget, an
income-smoothing reserve will hold ap
proximately >50,000 for next year. It
shall be maintained at an amount equiv
alent to 100 percent of the budgeted in
vestment income for the current fiscal
year.
□ Finally, an equipment reserve of ap
proximately *50,000 will fund the pur
chase of a new computer for the ASSU
banking agency, which handles all stu
dent organizational banking transac
tions.
