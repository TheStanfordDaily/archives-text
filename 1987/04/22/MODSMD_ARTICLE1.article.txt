# Runoff in COP race; service fee approved
## 
### MONIQUE SCHEER Senior staff writer 
The Equalizers and The Plan
will participate in a runoff for
Council of Presidents next week,
unless the Slate of the Union
decides to demand a recount of
the votes.
Students also voted by a 66 per
cent margin last week to create a
community service general fee and
passed all three referendums on
the ballot.
A constitutional amendment
that would allow for long-term
capital expenditures, however,
was voted down.
In the preliminary count, all
ASSU fee requests were passed ex
cept for the Chaparral. Concert
Network II and the Band 11.
Of the 4,623 votes cast for COP

slates. The Equalizers garnered
over 38 percent, while The Plan
took 24 percent and the Slate of
the Union tallied just under 23
percent. The Philosopher Kings
took fourth place with almost 15
percent of the vote.
The Slate of the Union trailed
The Plan by a mere 53 votes, ac
cording to the first official count,
released yesterday afternoon. The
slate has 72 hours from yester
day's announcement to call for a
recount, for which they must post
a $250 bond, according to COP
member Carey White.
Mike Cahill, a member of the
Slate of the Union, said his slate
has not yet decided whether to re
quest a recount, as its members
said they were under the impres
sion that the elections commis-

sion had initiated a recount on its
own.
Elections Commissioner Brett
Jarvis said the commission did
not intend to recount the ballots
unless the Slate of the Union re
quested it. "We heard they might
request a recount." he said.
Whether a recount will take
place is still unknown at this time.
"We'll probably discuss it
IWednesdayl." Cahill said.
If the Slate of the Union does re
quest a recount, it could be com
pleted by Monday and would prob
ably not cause the runoff to be
postponed, Jarvis said.
A definite date has not been set
for the runoff, but according to
White, it could be any time after
next Monday. "It is conceivable
that the runoff will be held
Thursday and Friday," he said.
Prior to the runoff election, the
two participating slates will hold
at least one public debate, said
members of The Equalizers and
The Plan.
In other election results:
□ Two-thirds of the voters ap
proved the creation of a commu
nity service general fee. The
*80.000 fee. on which students
may get a refund, is allocated in a
way similar to the Program Board
fee. The money will be used to sup
port community service projects
in the Stanford community.
□ The first referendum on the bal
lot. which asked the University
Board of Trustees trustees to con
sider the Stanford Out Of South
Africa proposal for total divest
ment, passed by a margin of 1,942
votes. Senator Stacey Leyton said
the two-to-one vote in favor of the
referendum "shows our support
hasn't decreased since last year,
which some (members of the Com
mittee on Investment Responsibil
ity) had been saying."
□ The constitutional amendment
fell just 212 votes short of the two
thirds majority required for pas
sage. The amendment also failed
by a small percentage when it was
on the ballot two years ago.

sion had initiated a recount on its
own.
Elections Commissioner Brett
Jarvis said the commission did
not intend to recount the ballots
unless the Slate of the Union re
quested it. "We heard they might
request a recount." he said.
Whether a recount will take
place is still unknown at this time.
"We'll probably discuss it
IWednesdayl." Cahill said.
If the Slate of the Union does re
quest a recount, it could be com
pleted by Monday and would prob
ably not cause the runoff to be
postponed, Jarvis said.
A definite date has not been set
for the runoff, but according to
White, it could be any time after
next Monday. "It is conceivable
that the runoff will be held
Thursday and Friday," he said.
Prior to the runoff election, the
two participating slates will hold
at least one public debate, said
members of The Equalizers and
The Plan.
In other election results:
□ Two-thirds of the voters ap
proved the creation of a commu
nity service general fee. The
*80.000 fee. on which students
may get a refund, is allocated in a
way similar to the Program Board
fee. The money will be used to sup
port community service projects
in the Stanford community.
□ The first referendum on the bal
lot. which asked the University
Board of Trustees trustees to con
sider the Stanford Out Of South
Africa proposal for total divest
ment, passed by a margin of 1,942
votes. Senator Stacey Leyton said
the two-to-one vote in favor of the
referendum "shows our support
hasn't decreased since last year,
which some (members of the Com
mittee on Investment Responsibil
ity) had been saying."
□ The constitutional amendment
fell just 212 votes short of the two
thirds majority required for pas
sage. The amendment also failed
by a small percentage when it was
on the ballot two years ago.
