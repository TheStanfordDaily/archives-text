# Terrorism: No easy solution
## 
### JOHN POLLACK Senior staff writer 
"There are no simple solutions
to terrorism," an expert on ter
rorism said last night at a
Stanford-in-Government pre
sentation entitled "International
Terrorism: Where Is It Leading
Us?"
Michael Stohl, a political sci
ence professor at Purdue Univer
sity who specializes in the study
of terrorism, said the United
States must differentiate be
tween various types of terrorism
before it can deal effectively with
the problem.
"Different enemies require dif
ferent responses," Stohl told a
small audience at Branner Hall,
noting that insurgent, state
supported and international ter
rorism should each be treated
differently.
Beverly Allen, assistant pro
fessor of French and Italian and

author of a forthcoming book on
terrorism tn Italian literature,
addressed the issue from a lin
guistic perspective.
"The word 'terrorism' Is very
dangerous because it is a
blanket label," Allen said, noting
that any act labeled "terrorist" is
removed from the historical con
text that produced it. Without
the historical context, she said,
we cannot understand the cause
behind a violent act.
While not excusing terrorist
acts, Allen said the language
used to describe them — espe
cially the word terrorist —
hampers our understanding of
them. "Language is constantly
being manipulated," she said.
Stohl also spoke of manipula
tion, noting that the public is
manipulated by both terrorists
and the media coverage of ter
rorist violence. Stohl, however,
said he does not favor restrlc

tions on media coverage because
they would "challenge" terror
ists to create newsworthy
events.
Stohl called the Reagan ad
ministration's anti-terrorism
policy a "failure," adding that
the president s strong rhetoric
has blown the problem out of
proportion. According to Stohl.
the president unrealistically
raised the public's expectations
about the United States' ability
to stop terrorism while simulta
neously fostering excessive
public concern about the prob
lem.
Stohl downplayed the problem
of terrorism, noting that the
United States should not feel as
threatened as it does. "Attacks
on American targets should not
be elevated to an attack on
America as a whole," he said.
"I don't think it (terrorism) is
much of a problem. "
