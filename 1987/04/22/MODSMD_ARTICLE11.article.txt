# Colonel's stay in Rodin garden
## 
### ANN MARSH Staff writer 
A new sculpture made a special
appearance last Sunday in the
Rodin sculpture garden. But it
didn't resemble any figure on the
famous sculptor's Gates of Hell.
No one knows if Auguste Rodin
would have approved the addition
of Colonel Sanders to the garden,
but that's where the fiberglass
Kentucky-fried figurehead myster
iously turned up Easter morning.
On March 4. the life-size Colonel
was "kidnapped'' from the
prominent display window at Paul
and Donna Prudence's Kentucky
Fried Chicken restaurant on El
Camino Real.
Since the recovery of the miss
ing mascot, the mood in the res
taurant has been jubilant, accord
ing to Donna Prudence. She said a
group of customers recently an
nounced, "We're here to celebrate.
The Colonel Is back."
Apparently, the Colonel, too, is
happy to be back with the
Prudences after his six-week ab

sence. "I've seen it all â€” It's not a
pretty picture. Take me home!"
read the note attached to the
Colonel, who suffered head Injur
ies and other damages from the
ordeal.
"I never meant to worry you.
Donna and Paul." the note contin
ued. "I just needed some space.
Happy Easter! Your Faithful Ser
vant, The Colonel."
The Prudences are happy to
have retrieved the Southern
gentleman, worth approximately
<5,000 and no longer produced.
The couple said they will have to
spend thousands of dollars on re
pairs and Install a new alarm sys
tem. When the Colonel finally
makes his reappearance, he will
be cemented into position.
The Prudences did not decide
easily to take such measures to
protect their prized possession.
"There's certainly a lot of tradi
tion (surrounding the Colonel),"
said Paul Prudence. "We've kind of
lost track of all the times he's been
stolen."
A Stanford fullback once broke

through the glass and tried stuff
ing the statue In the back of his
sports car. The student was
stopped In mid-getaway by police.
This time, however, the
burglars were more crafty. The
best lead the police have, said
Donna Prudence, Is a report by a
Domino's Pizza delivery woman
who, on a run to the Stanford
campus, saw two "teen-aged kids"
doing something suspicious In
front of the restaurant at about
the time the Colonel was stolen.
During the tense weeks before
his return, the Prudences circ
ulated and posted filers all over
the Stanford campus and in all
fraternity houses offering a *500
reward for return of the statue. Al
though the culprits never came
forth, the money will go to Anna
Mercer, a Menlo Park resident who
called the police after spotting the
Colonel between a burgher and
The Gates of Hell.
When the police came to pick up
the Colonel "all the museum
guards were taking photos," said
Mercer. "It was really funny."
