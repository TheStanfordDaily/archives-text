Two months ago, a student task force sug
gested to the Office of Student Affairs that
condom dispensers be installed in residences
and libraries around campus. The proposal
has yet to be considered. The process has
been inexcusably delayed by an illogical
method of decision-making.
Acting Dean of Student Affairs Norm Rob
inson will have the ultimate say over whether
the dispensers are allowed on campus. As is
typical University procedure, Robinson opted
to form a committee to study the issue — the
University Housing and Operations Advisory
Committee, to be exact.
Before this extension of the endless Uni
versity bureaucracy could even consider
meeting, the ASSU Nominations Commis
sion had to advertise for, interview and select
student members of the committee. Then the
ASSU Senate had to approve them.
This process is slow and unwieldly, espe
cially concerning the tremendous public
health issue in question. But what is worse
is that this decision should not be within the

purview of the committee system in the first
place.
The decision about placing condom dis
pensers in residences and libraries should be
a decentralized decision. If Robinson does
approve of the idea, then residents should be
able to determine whether they want dis
pensers in their houses. If Robinson does not
approve of the idea, then the committee's re
commendation will be ignored. In either
case, no committee is needed.
The committee system, slow and tiresome
as it is, is often necessary to insure student
and faculty input on important issues that
affect the entire University community. But
new committees should be avoided when
decisions can be made in other forums and
in a fraction of the time.
Condom dispensers are not a matter of
campus-wide concern. Whether dispensers
should be installed in residences is a ques
tion that should be determined by individual
dorms.
