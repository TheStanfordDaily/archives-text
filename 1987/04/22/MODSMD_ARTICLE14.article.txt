Name change
will solve
library woes
Having heard more impas
sioned controversy over the
Reagan Library than I care to
remember, I would like to offer a
modest proposal to satisfy all
sides.
All the environmental, esthetic
and other concerns expressed can
undoubtedly be met by simply
renaming it the Ted Kennedy
Library. This judicious compro
mise would save hundreds of
man-hours of faculty time.

Watch but for
phone fraud
at Stanford
I am writing to warn members
of the Stanford community about
possibly fraudulent offers of dis
count long-distance telephone
service.
Last November, at a stand in
White Plaza, I signed up to receive
"unlimited long-distance phone
service" during specified hours of
each day for a flat fee of *70 per
month.
The "phone company." then
calling Itself "Network America,"
also offered unlimited long
distance service all day long for a
fee of ♦ 120 per month.
I soon became suspicious. The
"phone company" offered to
reduce each subscriber's monthly
fee according to the number of
new victims each subscriber
enlisted.

Fearing that this offer was a
pyramid scheme in which the
original perpetrators persuade
victims to defraud successive
rounds of other victims, I quickly
returned a notarized refund re
quest form to Network America.
I never received a refund. But
in December I received a letter
announcing that the start-up
date of the phone service had
been delayed until January.
Since December, I have received
neither my refund nor any addi
tional information from Network
America. Nor has any discount
long-distance service been con
nected to my telephone.
If any other members of the
Stanford community have fallen
victim to this alleged fraud and
are interested in pursuing some
sort of joint legal action, please
contact me.

Graduates of
Yale can too
tie their shoes
I find outrageous the statement
in Ken Fenyo's recent column
that George Bush is "a wishy
washy Yalie who can't decide how
to tie his shoes" (Dally, April 10).
As a person with two advanced
degrees from Yale University, I see
this opinion as both astonishing
and disturbing in its degree of
inaccuracy, lllogic and poor judg
ment.
Moreover, it encourages a
climate of opinion at Stanford —
already too pervasive — about the
abilities of Yalies and possibly
others who have had life experi
ences outside the Farm.
Let's look at the inaccuracies
first. Like the majority of Yalies,
while cutting the mustard on a
day-to-day basis George Bush
wears penny loafers, which do not

need to be tied. When he is out
visiting family in Texas and
punching oil wells or broncos, he
wears cowboy boots, which also
do not have laces. At his vacation
house on the Maine coast, he
wears rubber lobsterman boots
from L.L. Bean. Such boots would
look pretty silly with shoe laces. I
must conclude that Fenyo is
either insidiously inaccurate or
just plain wrong.
Now consider the illogic. Tfte
column states that Bush "can't
decide how to tie his shoes." As
any Yalie knows, there is only one
way to tie shoes. There Is no deci
sion process here for Bush or any
other Ivy Leaguer.
I assume that what was really
meant Is either that Bush doesn't
know how to tie his shoes or that
he suffers a mental or physical
inadequacy that prevents him
from successfully completing the
task. This is absurd and unsub
stantiated speculation.
Turning finally to poor judge
ment: Irrespective of his inten
tions, Fenyo has needlessly cast
aspersions on the reputations of
the Yalles — an entire class of
hard-working and well
intentioned members of society.
While not often called upon to
do so, we do know how to tie our
shoes. When necessary, we do so
cheerfully — for God, for country
and for Yale.
While not wanting to sink to
the level of the column, I would be
very surprised if more than a
handful of Stanford students —
fresh from their Hawaiian spring
breaks — have the potential to
remove their flippers, flip-flops
and windsurfers and actually find
a pair of shoes — much less tie
them properly.
I'd challenge any Stanford
graduate student to a shoe-tying
contest, If it weren't such a pat
hetic mismatch.
