# Failure to change would be folly

### 
Scott Lyon's recent column criticizing the
Western Culture Task Force report (Daily, April
20) was repulsive in tone, short-sighted in
scope and reactionary in thought.
Lyon begins his "criticism" of the Western
Culture report by citing the suggestion of in
cluding works of women and minorities. Is
there a problem with this suggestion? Do
women and minorities not figure in the devel
opment of Western culture?

LLOYD METZ

It should be clear to any truly modern person
that the answer Is "No." Perhaps the problem
many have with the Issue of Area One reform Is
the word "minorities." Once again, any ra
tional. modern person would realize that
"minorities" Include history's working classes
along with racial minorities. Can anyone
truthfully say that the cultural and Intellectual
contributions of minorities to Western culture
are Insignificant?
The elimination of "the blinders of provin
cialism." as the task force report puts It. Is the
most valuable change the Western Culture
reform would bring. It Is this provincial atti
tude that has the "Western world" condescend
ing to the peoples of the Middle East. Central
and South America. Asia and Africa.
Why Is It that the West has difficulties seeing
eye-to-eye with the Lebanese. Nlcaraguans or
the black South Africans? It Is because we. the
West, see these peoples as Intellectually and
culturally Inferior.
We don't seem to understand why Africans
or South Americans violently reject American

and European "gifts" of Western culture.
Could it be that we don't understand the cen
turies of European exploitation? Could it be
that these people had intellectually and cul
turally rich civilizations before European con
tact?
In order for everyone to adequately function
in the global world of today and tomorrow, we
should put Western culture in its proper per
spective as one (although dynamic) of many
world cultures.
Here lies the answer to the question of the
core reading list's future. In the scope of a
"world culture" program, Plato would find a
place with Pharaoh Akhnaton and other
"Eastern" thinkers.
It is when an intellectual tradition is per
petually taught independent of any outside
contributions or contemporaries that
chauvinism develops. If the core reading list is
truly invaluable, it will show up In the "world
culture" reading list.
It is said. "Why shouldn't we read Rousseau
if we want to learn about Rousseau?" How
funny that the defenders of Area One use the
battle cry of the reformists. I say. "Why
shouldn't we read about the slave society of
Haiti which financed Rousseau's France?" The
complete political, social and economic context
of an author's time must be taught along with
the work.
It Is often — and quite strongly — said that
the current faculty Is unqualified to teach a
"world culture" track. Also, it Is said that If
there is no new track implemented, there is
not enough time to augment the current
tracks.
To the first assertion. I say that change does
not come without pain. In the long run.it is

better to have to find better qualified faculty
now than to produce 111-prepared, prejudiced
doctors, lawyers, engineers and executives In
the future.
To the second claim. 1 say that there Is room
to Include the "flip side" of Western culture. As
a former Literature and Arts student, 1 can —
and I'm sure Lyon can — honestly say that
there were lectures on works that had little in
fluence on American culture. Western culture
or any culture and could have been replaced.
I hope that the attitudes represented in
Lyon's column are not those of the majority of
Stanford students. Unfortunately. 1 feel that
hope might be an idle dream.
Maintenance of Area One in its current form
is nothing short of folly. Increasing the non-
Western culture requirement to two courses is
no answer. That solution would result in two
quarters of focused study. A broader require
ment is needed.
If any resolution to this issue is to be found,
the discussion and debate must be reasonable
and clear-sighted. Columns such as Lyon's
only serve to insult the issues of the reformists
and the readers of The Daily.
