# Fight the Fun Police
## 
### 
It was late fall quarter and things were not going
well. I was woefully unprepared for my upcoming
finals and was seriously wondering why I was still
wasting time In school when I could be living as a
vagrant in the mountains. Clearly, the only solution
was to go to the Flicks and vent my frustrations by
pelting strangers with wads of paper.
So my roommate and I — Biff (not his real name —
but close enough) — stuffed our backpacks with a
quarter's worth of late problem sets, flailed midterms
and random fliers and headed toward Mem Aud.

The flick was "E.T." — precisely the kind of syrupy,
uplifting schmaltz I was not in the mood for — and
there was a crowd of only about 100 or so. But that
didn't matter. We were not planning to sit through
the whole movie anyway.
Since there were so few people, we thought that we
would try to hit every person in Mem Aud. with a
paper wad at least once. Biff and I had progressed
through several rows of people when someone ap
peared and told us we were throwing too much
paper.
We were confused. This was the Sunday Flicks. At
every Flick we had been to in three years we had
thrown paper. In fact, there were usually thousands
of people throwing paper (and other things). No one
had ever told us to stop.
We suspected that this person was an agent of the
legendary Stanford Fun Police, a covert organization
devoted to making campus life less fun. We explained
the history of the Flicks to the Fun Police agent, but
he was not impressed. He flashed an "ASSU Flicks"
logo on his shirt and confiscated our paper.
We knew fascism when we saw it. We returned to
our seats (where we still had.a large supply of paper)
and waited for the short. As soon as the lights
dimmed and the short began, we hurled our remain
ing paper into the projector beam. This created a
momentary but dazzling snow flurry. Everyone in
Mem Aud was impressed.
Everyone but the Fun Police, that is. The agent
reappeared out of nowhere and confiscated both my
backpack and Biff. I sat paperless and alone for a
minute. Then I had visions of my roommate being
tortured by the Fun Police and sprang to his aid.
I found Biff being subjected to an economics
lecture by a Fun Police officer. He quoted some
astronomical figure for the cost of cleaning up Mem
Aud after each flick. We were told that we were bad
boys and that if we ever did this again we would
never be allowed into the Sunday Flicks again.
Well, we have respect for economic realities — if
not the Fun' Police — so I have subsequently cur
tailed my paper-throwing habits. Biff was so emo
tionally wrecked by the incident that he stopped out
to go race bicycles.
Now — two quarters later — I hear an announce
ment at a house meeting that the Flicks are still too
rowdy and that we should all try to be more tame. It

must be you people, because I've been good.
It is the duty of columnists to find great portents in
minutiae such as this. What is our campus coming
to, I wonder, when the Sunday Flicks — that great
bastion of traditional Stanford anarchy — is subject
to restraint? What is happening to the Stanford play
ful spirit?
There has been a disturbing trend in recent
months. First, the Band gets banned. Then we lose
Big Game (a correlation, perhaps?). Then there is
talk of a dry stadium next year, and there is a dry
Rush this year. And now we are asked to throw only
polite amounts of paper at the Flicks. The Fun Police,
it seems, are everywhere; not even the Sunday Flicks
are safe.
Imagine Stanford in 10 years if these trends con
tinue. The Band marches and plays "Hail Stanford,
Hail" instead of "All Right Now." Students go to
Green instead of football games. The Sunday Flicks
shows only videotapes of arcane engineering classes.
Parties are outlawed. Fun Police are billeted in every
dorm to insure that only intellectual discussions
take place at meals. Lagunita becomes a parking lot.
And, of course, we never win Big Game again. In
short, Stanford becomes Indistinguishable from Cal
tech.
Granted, the above paragraph reads like a bad
Gaieties skit — perhaps I am just a curmudgeonly
old dinosaur — but it seems that there was more fun
to be had on campus four years ago than there is
today.
Part of the blame lies with students, I suppose. The
distinction between having good fun and being ob
noxious and disgusting is often subtle. I consider
throwing paper at the Flicks to be in the former cate
gory, while, say, urinating on a football field or
beating someone to a bloody pulp is generally consid
ered to be in the latter.
Nevertheless, there seem to be more rules here
than there were when 1 was a freshman — and not all
of them are good ones. I find the injunction against
drinking games, for example, to be objectionable, al
though you probably will never find me playing quar
ters.
There is something to be said for having respect
for students' Individual responsibility. And, as a
rule, the more (harmless) stupid fun there is on
campus the better it will be.
Which at last brings me back to the Sunday Flicks.
Obviously, there are some things that do not belong
at the Flicks — the Fun Police and people throwing
bricks or mayonnaise, for starters. But the great
preflick paper fight is a tradition that deserves to
continue.
As I said, I respect economic reality more than the
Fun Police. If the cleanup after the Flicks is expen
sive. then so be it. We should do what Americans do
best: Throw money at the problem. After all, I pay
about >3,700 per quarter for classes (which are gen
erally no fun at all), so I certainly wouldn't mind
giving the ASSU Sunday Flicks a few extra dollars for
cleanup.
And if we can keep the rest of the activities at the
Flicks within the scope of good fun as opposed to
hooliganism, perhaps the Fun Police will go away
and leave us alone.
