## Stanford provides campus jobs for its neighbors 
### NANNETTE THOMPSON Staff writer 
Stanford is helping to make the job
search easier for its neighbors who have
no work experience or a poor scholastic
record.
The University Personnel Department
coordinates two programs aimed at help
ing members of the community find jobs.
The Stanford Employment Experience
Program (SEE) aids those looking for full
time employment. Another program, the
Youth Opportunity Program (YOP), aids
area high school students.
Both programs are "highly recognized
by the community," according to Michael
Britt, director and coordinator of SEE
and YOP.
SEE provides entry-level jobs on

campus to a target population that is eco
nomically disadvantaged, physically lim
ited or of minority backround. Partici
pants in the program are referred to SEE
counselors by numerous community em
ployment agencies.
SEE members come to Stanford with
some training and work on campus for a
probationary six-month period. Most
have been trained in clerical skills for
three to six months, according to John
Pugh, coordinator of the Teen Opportu
nity Program for Opportunities Industri
alization Centers West (OICW), an em
ployment agency In Menlo Park that
makes referrals to SEE.
"We make sure they can do the job —
that they have the clerical skills, a pleas
ant telephone manner, verbal and written
communication skills and a neat appear

ance," he said.
OICW also looks for who are punctual,
dependable and who can take initiative —
by finding out about public transporta
tion to and from work, for instance.
Marie Voyles, Stanford's employment
department supervisor, said she believes
her department benefits by hiring
employees from SEE. "It's nice to know
these people come recommended," she
said. "They come with a reference point."
Voyles added that another positive
aspect of the program is that It is "so per
sonal.
"A counselor takes the person under his
wing and tries to make a good match
(between the participant and a depart
ment on campus)," she said. If a problem
should arise with an employee, his or her
counselor can be contacted to act as a

"sounding board," she said.
"It is one of the few programs that is
uniformly positive," said Robert Parker,
director of personnel for the University.
When participants are hired "they are
people who add a lot to the place," Parker
said. Parker also noted the program's low
turn-over rate as one of its positive
aspects.
Perhaps most important to participants
in the program is the fact that "they get
their self-respect back," said Shaun Grif
fin, a counselor in SEE. "They get a sense
of accomplishment you don't get unless
vou work for It,"he added.
While SEE focuses on finding full-time
employment for about 120 people a year,
YOP Is targeted mainly to high school stu
dents seeking jobs during the summer
months. About 110 students participate

in the summer and 25 to 35 participate
during the school year.
The program is geared toward provid
ing an "opportunity for those that aren't
3.0 (GPA status) or those not necessarily
college-bound," Brltt said. Those targeted
are the economically disadvantaged and
the physically limited, usually from Menlo
Park and East Palo Alto.
Aside from economic status, students
are accepted into YOP based on work ex
perience, interest, academic skills, a let
ter of recommendation and a written ap
plication. Students may work in the areas
of engineering, medical science, mainte
nance or clerical work.
YOP also gives participants access to
college admission applications, financial
aid preparation, career counseling and
academic tutoring.
