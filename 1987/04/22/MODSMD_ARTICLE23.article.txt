## 'Raising Arizona': The Coens' indefinable comedy 
### DOUG GRABOWSKI JENNIFER TSAY 
The Coen brothers, who
produced and directed the offbeat
"Blood Simple," are back with
"Raising Arizona," a film that
preserves much of the quirky
humor of their previous film. This
time, however, the humor is pre
sented in an outright comedy
rather than in aJilm-noir parody.
"Raising Arizona" revolves
around a series of "babynap
plngs," the toddler in question
being Nathan Arizona Jr., one of
the famed quintuplets from
Tempe, Arizona. Hi and Edwina
McDonnough (Nicolas Cage and
Holly Hunter), a childless couple,
decide to steal one of the babies
after hearing Nathan Arizona Sr.
lament that the quints are more
than he can handle. What follows
Is a distinctly original comedy in
volving a "lone biker of the
Apocalypse," a pair of convicts
who escape through a sewer sys
tem and a chase involving several
packages of Huggles diapers and a
Doberman plnscher.
With its desert setting and
numerous chase scenes, "Raising
Arizona" is reminiscent of a "Road
Runner" cartoon. Maybe this ex
plains why Hi has a Road Runner
tattoo on his right arm. The Coens
borrow from other sources as well:
"Road Warrior" flicks, spaghetti
Westerns and even Sam Shepard.
What holds the film together is
the Coens' unique visual sense.
The camera moves constantly
from a baby's point of view on the
floor to either an overhead shot, a
panoramic view of a sunset or a
fish-eye close-up of an annoying

house guest. One ts astounded by
the Coens' loving attention to
Americana as they pan along a
floor Just so that we can see the
Planter's Cheese Balls being
crushed Into a carpet by a leather
clad mercenary.
The editing Is quick and sur
prising, but doesn't jar the viewer.
This rapid pace seems borrowed
from commercials â€” especially the
first 10 minutes of the film, which
portray the courtship, marriage
and childlessness of Hi and Ed
wina.

With its desert setting and chase
scenes, 'Raising Arizona 9 is reminis
cent of a 'Road Runner 9 cartoon.

The film, however, varies greatly
in tone. The lengthy conclusion
scenes seem forced and awkward.
When Nathan Arizona Sr., an
unfinished-furniture tycoon,
delivers a homily on marriage to
Hi and Edwina, the film suddenly
seems to be taking itself too
seriously.
Even more perplexing is Hi's
closing dream sequence, in which
he envisions his future life as a
grandfather, replete with a
Thanksgivng dinner lifted from a
Norman Rockwell painting. This
final parody drags on and finally
stops being funny. The Coens
seem unsure about whether to
make us laugh or to move us with
Hi's sentimental vision.
Hi dreams of a day when "all
parents will be good and just and

wise, and all children will be
happy," but there aren't any good
parents In this film, not even Hi
and Edwina. Little Nathan is just
a prop alternately placed on the
roof of a moving car, strapped to
the front of a Harley Davidson or
simply left on the dividing line of
an interstate highway.
This is fine for a comedy, but
when the film tries to say some
thing about parenting, the
message is garbled, lost amid out
landish situations and charac
ters.

Except for the character of Hi,
everyone seems like a caricature.
Holly Hunter portrays Hi's wife
Edwina, who is a police officer but
also a typical nagging wife. She
whines and pouts at every oppor
tunity and one wishes that the
filmmakers had made her charac
ter more human. John Goodman
and Bill Forsythe, however, who
play the baby-faced bank robbers
Gale and Evelle Snopes, work well
together In a team reminiscent of
Laurel and Hardy.
Of all the performances, Cage's
is the most interesting. His dis
heveled hair and self-effacing
manner bring a comic pathos to
his role as Hi, an ex-con trying to
give up his addiction to robbing
convenience stores. Cage does a
fine job of narrating the film in a

bizarre blend of Southern slang
and literary speech. Telling the
audience about Edwina's infer
tility, he soberly remarks that "her
insides were rocky ground where
my seed could find no purchase."
The dialogue in "Raising
Arizona" is to be savored. "Oh!
Balloons!" chortles the fugitive
Evelle Snopes as he robs a

roadside store. "Do they blow up
into funny shapes?" "Only If
round's funny," replies the
crotchety store owner. This
humor of situation and dialogue,
not physical slapstick, is the
Coens' forte.
"Raising Arizona" resists defini
tion. It is a comedy in the broadest
sense of the word, designed to en

tertain on many levels. Avoiding
the predictability of so many of
today's formulaic dead-end films,
like the self-perpetuating "Police
Academy," films, "Raising
Arizona" takes pride in the art of
filmmaking. Stylish and eccentric
in its attention to detail, it's a
great way to spend two hours in
the dark.

Nicolas Cage gets a little tied up in the new comedy "Raising Arizona," written and directed by the ac
claimed Joel and Ethan Coen. Cage plays a "bahynapper" who gets more trouble than he bargained for.
