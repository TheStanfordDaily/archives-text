# Broderick's latest 'Project' fails
## 
### GEORDIE McKEE 
If you happen to be the type of moviegoer who en
joys being manipulated and provoked to feel anger
toward humankind for man's cruelty to animals,
then you shouldn't miss "Project X." Although the
film is humorous at times — largely due to its squad
of adorable chimpanzees — it falls sadly short of ac
hieving what it sets out to do.

Broderick and Hunt relate
only on a dull, superficial
level.

Unfortunately, Matthew Broderick, who stars as
Air Force pilot Jimmy Garrett, is unable to use any of
the charm, wit or humor for which he is loved and
renowned. The script is so poorly written that it
never allows for any development of Broderick's char
acter, who is obviously the main attraction of the
film. We expect to see something in the mold of his
past successes — "Ferris Bueller's Day Off and "War
Games" — but all we get is a very funny and talented
actor playing the role of a simple-minded, common
thinking adult.
Don't get me wrong, though. Broderick's portrayal
of Jimmy Garrett as a sensitive, small-town guy who
cares only about flying is believable and well-done,
but it lacks the dynamism and spark the film needs
to be a success. Instead, we get spots of fun and
humor from the chimps that Jimmy becomes re
sponsible for in the top-secret military training pro
gram he's assigned to.
"Project X" co-stars Helen Hunt as Teri, the univer
sity researcher who trains one of the chimps, Virgil
(played a chimp named Willie). This sad-faced crea
ture should rightfully get top billing, since only he
captures the audience's emotions with his lovable
character.
When we finally discover that the Air Force plans to
use the monkey as a guinea pig to test its radiation
capacity in case of a nuclear war. the film loses its
lighthearted quality and becomes a political state
ment. Teri and Jimmy join forces to save their
beloved friend, and Virgil's fate becomes a struggle
between these two and the emotionless bureaucracy
of the Air Force.
By the time the winner is declared, though, we
hardly care. Scenes drag from one to the next with
out any purpose or plot line to keep our interest. The
interaction between Broderick and Hunt is also a
disappointment, as they relate only on a dull, super
ficial level. The relationship never becomes anything
but an exchange of words.
In short, "Project X" is a disappointment.
