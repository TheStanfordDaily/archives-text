# Old movies are going, going, gone
## 
### JAMES KOSIC 
For the last few weeks, I've felt that
the closing of Palo Alto's New Varsity
Theater in February deserved some
kind of eulogy in these pages. The rea
son for this feeling was not very clear to
me. since the theater itself was not par
ticularly enjoyable, having declined into
a rather decrepit state. The cracked
paint was peeling off the walls. The cur
tains were ripped. And the shabby
chairs — upholstered in red velvet, red
imitation velvet, red vinyl, red imitation
vinyl, red tape or any combination of
the above — might be politely called un
comfortable.
The films themselves (the prints, that
is) were generally of poor quality.
Whether it was "Citizen Kane" or
"Lawrence of Arabia," nearly every flick
started with a brief but violent
snowstorm. Decades of breakage gave
nearly every star an unusually bad case
of the hiccups somewhere in the film
("Frankly my ear, I don't gi amn"). The
theater's seedy image was cemented by
the extravagantly androgynous ticket
takers and the ritual convention of Palo
Altan punkers after the late show.
To be totally accurate, the New Var
sity, in fact, didn't ever close at all. The
ownership changed hands and the new

management, in a burst of creativity,
simply changed the theater's name to
(ta da!) the Varsity Theater. More im
portantly for moviegoers, however, they
also changed its format. The old New
Varsity was a revival house, meaning
that it revived films that had already
been released, generally old and new
"classic" films of both foreign and do
mestic persuasion, and showed them
for a single night or two, usually in a
double feature. In their wisdom, the
new management began showing first
run, limited-release foreign and domes
tic films, just like the Aquarius, Bijou.
Guild. Fine Arts, Stanford and Park
theaters.
So the death of the New Varsity as a
revival theater deserves an epitaph for
what it represented, the last theater of
its kind outside of San Francisco and
Berkeley. Within the last four years.
Jour such theaters in this area have
either closed their doors or changed
their format: the Fox in Redwood City,
the Festival, the Bijou and now the New
Varsity in Palo Alto.
In addition, two film series on
campus (sponsored by the Law School
and the Chaparral) which specialized in
classic films have also folded. The only

remaining semi-regular showing
of older films is the Tuesday Films
series In Cubberley Auditorium, a
series whose selection of films can
be accurately described as
esoteric. The opportunity to see
classic films In a theater is now
practically non-existent.
The obvious reason for the
decimation of the revival theaters
and series is the advent of the
video cassette recorder. Nearly any
film can be Inexpensively rented
and viewed at one's convenience,
unedited and without commer
cials. The selection of films now
available on video is extensive and
will probably, sooner or later, in
clude every movie one would ever
wish to see. Every moviegoer
should be oveijoyed.
So what's the problem? Well, at
the risk of sounding like an In
sidious pre-yuppie, the "experi
ence" of watching a great film in a
theater Is being lost. Two aspects
make the theater experience espe
cially better than the VCR experi
ence.
The first is that the TV tends to
put the viewer In control of the
movies. In the cinema, the viewer
Is a member of a captive audience.
There Is no rewind, no pause, no
fast forward. For better or worse.

the moviegoer must watch the
film as the director intended.
Watching movies on TV eventually
makes them like — well, like TV.
Soon you're getting up to make
popcorn, do laundry or vacuum
the floor while "The Bicycle Thief
plays in the background, or per
haps you're fitting the first hour of
"Notorious" between dinner and
"The Cosby Show." and the
second hour between "Family
Ties" and "L.A. Law."
The second reason is more ob
vious: When movies are viewed on
the big screen they are big. The
picture Is clearer, the colors are
brighter than on television. The
sound is much more dynamic,
and the audience Is. unless you
watch TV alone, quieter. Movies In
a theater can captivate and over
power an audience in a way that a
tiny television screen never can.
I'd like to end with a little recom
mendation. If you're part of a stu
dent group looking to raise some
money, a revival film series could
be an Idea for you to consider.
Without competition from profes
sional movie houses, such a film
series could successfully advertise
for the off-campus, Palo Alto film
going crowd. A clientele that sup
ported four theaters and two film
series could not have dried up
completely in just four years.
And finally, if you do plan to
start up a film series, be sure to
send me a schedule.

that it revived films that had already
been released, generally old and new
"classic" films of both foreign and do
mestic persuasion, and showed them
for a single night or two, usually in a
double feature. In their wisdom, the
new management began showing first
run, limited-release foreign and domes
tic films, just like the Aquarius, Bijou.
Guild. Fine Arts, Stanford and Park
theaters.
So the death of the New Varsity as a
revival theater deserves an epitaph for
what it represented, the last theater of
its kind outside of San Francisco and
Berkeley. Within the last four years.
Jour such theaters in this area have
either closed their doors or changed
their format: the Fox in Redwood City,
the Festival, the Bijou and now the New
Varsity in Palo Alto.
In addition, two film series on
campus (sponsored by the Law School
and the Chaparral) which specialized in
classic films have also folded. The only

remaining semi-regular showing
of older films is the Tuesday Films
series In Cubberley Auditorium, a
series whose selection of films can
be accurately described as
esoteric. The opportunity to see
classic films In a theater is now
practically non-existent.
The obvious reason for the
decimation of the revival theaters
and series is the advent of the
video cassette recorder. Nearly any
film can be Inexpensively rented
and viewed at one's convenience,
unedited and without commer
cials. The selection of films now
available on video is extensive and
will probably, sooner or later, in
clude every movie one would ever
wish to see. Every moviegoer
should be oveijoyed.
So what's the problem? Well, at
the risk of sounding like an In
sidious pre-yuppie, the "experi
ence" of watching a great film in a
theater Is being lost. Two aspects
make the theater experience espe
cially better than the VCR experi
ence.
The first is that the TV tends to
put the viewer In control of the
movies. In the cinema, the viewer
Is a member of a captive audience.
There Is no rewind, no pause, no
fast forward. For better or worse.

the moviegoer must watch the
film as the director intended.
Watching movies on TV eventually
makes them like — well, like TV.
Soon you're getting up to make
popcorn, do laundry or vacuum
the floor while "The Bicycle Thief
plays in the background, or per
haps you're fitting the first hour of
"Notorious" between dinner and
"The Cosby Show." and the
second hour between "Family
Ties" and "L.A. Law."
The second reason is more ob
vious: When movies are viewed on
the big screen they are big. The
picture Is clearer, the colors are
brighter than on television. The
sound is much more dynamic,
and the audience Is. unless you
watch TV alone, quieter. Movies In
a theater can captivate and over
power an audience in a way that a
tiny television screen never can.
I'd like to end with a little recom
mendation. If you're part of a stu
dent group looking to raise some
money, a revival film series could
be an Idea for you to consider.
Without competition from profes
sional movie houses, such a film
series could successfully advertise
for the off-campus, Palo Alto film
going crowd. A clientele that sup
ported four theaters and two film
series could not have dried up
completely in just four years.
And finally, if you do plan to
start up a film series, be sure to
send me a schedule.
