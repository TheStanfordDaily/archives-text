# Old movies are going, going, gone

### JAMES KOSIC 
For the last few weeks, I've felt that
the closing of Palo Alto's New Varsity
Theater in February deserved some
kind of eulogy in these pages. The rea
son for this feeling was not very clear to
me. since the theater itself was not par
ticularly enjoyable, having declined into
a rather decrepit state. The cracked
paint was peeling off the walls. The cur
tains were ripped. And the shabby
chairs — upholstered in red velvet, red
imitation velvet, red vinyl, red imitation
vinyl, red tape or any combination of
the above — might be politely called un
comfortable.
The films themselves (the prints, that
is) were generally of poor quality.
Whether it was "Citizen Kane" or
"Lawrence of Arabia," nearly every flick
started with a brief but violent
snowstorm. Decades of breakage gave
nearly every star an unusually bad case
of the hiccups somewhere in the film
("Frankly my ear, I don't gi amn"). The
theater's seedy image was cemented by
the extravagantly androgynous ticket
takers and the ritual convention of Palo
Altan punkers after the late show.
To be totally accurate, the New Var
sity, in fact, didn't ever close at all. The
ownership changed hands and the new

management, in a burst of creativity,
simply changed the theater's name to
(ta da!) the Varsity Theater. More im
portantly for moviegoers, however, they
also changed its format. The old New
Varsity was a revival house, meaning
that it revived films that had already
been released, generally old and new
"classic" films of both foreign and do
mestic persuasion, and showed them
for a single night or two, usually in a
double feature. In their wisdom, the
new management began showing first
run, limited-release foreign and domes
tic films, just like the Aquarius, Bijou.
Guild. Fine Arts, Stanford and Park
theaters.
So the death of the New Varsity as a
revival theater deserves an epitaph for
what it represented, the last theater of
its kind outside of San Francisco and
Berkeley. Within the last four years.
Jour such theaters in this area have
either closed their doors or changed
their format: the Fox in Redwood City,
the Festival, the Bijou and now the New
Varsity in Palo Alto.
In addition, two film series on
campus (sponsored by the Law School
and the Chaparral) which specialized in
classic films have also folded. The only
