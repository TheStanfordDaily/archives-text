# Director Seidelman: Making Mr. Wrong
## 
### JENNIFER REESE 
"Making Mr. Right" Is a dis
astrous movie. Following her suc
cess with "Desperately Seeking
Susan," director Susan Seidel
man has fallen flat on her face.
The question now is, which movie
was the fluke — "Desperately
Seeking Susan" or this mess?
"Making Mr. Right" tries to poke
fun at the so-called dilemma of the
modern career woman who can't
find a good man. Frankle (Anna
Magnuson), the heroine. Is inde
pendent and successful but
romantically frustrated. It's easy
to see why, because all the men
around her are intolerable losers.
Her boyfriend, whom she dumps,
is a caricature of the stupid, pom
pous politician. The scientist she
works with is nerdy and hostile.
The men in smaller roles are
equally unappealing. Things look
bad for Frankle, and she consoles
herself by eating pints of Ice
cream.
Fortunately, there is an alterna
tive to human men: a mechanical
man named Ulysses, the creation
of the nerdy scientist (both roles
are played by John Malkovlch).
Frankie is hired to promote
Ulysses and tutor him in interper
sonal relationships. He turns out

to be everything his human coun
terparts are not: sensitive, warm,
devoted and good In bed. He falls
In love with Frankle and eventu
ally she overcomes her prejudice
against androids and they get to
gether.

That Frankie chooses an
android should be a stinging in
dictment of men, but it doesn't
have that effect. Why she chooses
the android, as it's played by
Malkovlch, is incomprehensible.
There's no way to applaud her

choice. Malkovlch is simply too
unappealing in this role.
I can't lay the whole blame for
the movie's failure on Malkovlch,
but he is certainly a factor. As
both the nerdy scientist and as
Ulysses, he is painful to watch. He

is a peculiar-looking, very pale ac
tor with a strange, limp haircut.
As the nerdy scientist he is un
pleasant. but as Ulysses he Is un
bearable in his effort to appear
sympathetic and ingenuous. To
mimic the android's innocence.

he widens his eyes and looks per
petually dazed. When Frankie
gives him a friendly kiss on the
cheek, he looks at her stupidly
and asks. "What was that.
Frankie?" It's enough to make you
cringe. There is no way to feel
good when Frankie ends up with
him.
So the central joke of the movie
fails. This is no Indictment of
men. I didn't cheer when Frankie
chose the android. 1 winced. Un
fortunately, I think the filmmak
ers intended the audience to
cheer, or at least to chuckte.
In all fairness, Anna Magnusson
as Frankie is fine. She's not a
magnetic presence, but she does
her best with the role. She runs
around in tight short skirts and
high heels for much of the movie
and holds up traffic at stoplights
while she puts on lipstick In her
car mirror. These gags aren't very
funny, but Magnusson carries
them off reasonably well.
The movie Is wacky and ram
bling with thankfully only a few
scenes that try to be profound. To
its credit, there are several very
original and funny moments, and
the movie is not without a few
laughs — but only a few. The
central plot is so weak and the act
ing so mediocre that It all sags and
collapses into mush.
