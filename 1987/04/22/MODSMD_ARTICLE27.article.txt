## Baseball hangs on for 7-5 win at San Jose St. 
### TOM SENF Senior staff writer 
SAN JOSE — Anytime the No. 4 baseball team in
the nation loses a midweek non-conference game, It
has to be considered an upset, but had Stanford fal
len to San Jose State here yesterday, it would not
have been that much of a surprise.
The Cardinal was coming off four Pacific 10 South
ern Division games in the past five days and was
missing its two offensive catalysts, seniors Toi Cook
and Ruben Amaro. Cook did not play due to Illness,
and Amaro was unable to make the 1 p.m. game be
cause of a class.
Yesterday's opponents were not your average
middle-of-the-week pushovers, either. The Spartans
entered the game with a 27-19 record, 6-6 in the
Pacific Coast Athletic Association, and had just
taken two from UC-Santa Barbara over the weekend.
Also, San Jose State Coach Sam Piraro sent his
No. 3 starter, A 1 Bacosa, to the mound and he was
not just out for a short midweek workout, throwing
six innings.
Stanford, however, had won 21 of its last 25 games
and found its good habits hard to break as the Card
inal jumped out to a 7-0 lead, then held on for a 7-5
win to raise its overall record to 33-12.
"We're very pleased." Stanford Coach Mark
Marquess said of his team's sustained effort over the
past six days. "We win two in Tucson (against
Arizona), beat Cal (Monday) and win this game too.
That's real big for us."
The offensive star for the Cardinal was first
baseman Ron Witmeyer, who in recent games has
gone from one of the easiest outs in the Stanford
lineup to one of its most dangerous clutch hitters.
His three hits in four at-bats put his average over
the .200 mark to end a season-long struggle, and his
four RBIs gave him 36 for the season and put him
into second place on the team — an amazing feat
considering he is just eighth on the team in hits.
"Right now I'm more confident at the plate than
I've been all year," Witmeyer said. "I go up there
thinking I'm going to hit the ball hard. A
After bouncing a single up the middle in the
second, Witmeyer gave Stanford a 2-0 lead in the
fourth with a line-drive two-run double over the head
of Spartan left fielder Rick Anderson.
A bases-loaded walk to Mark Machtolf and an Eric
DeGraw sacrifice fly extended the Cardinal lead to 4-
0, then Witmeyer made it 6-0 in the fifth with a
scorching two-out triple down the rightfield line off
the glove of Spartan first baseman Tom Hutler.

"He (Bacosa) got the curve out over the plate and
hung it up a little," Wltmeyer said.
Not long ago the ball may well have stayed In Hut
ler's glove. "Both of them (the single and the triple)
would probably have been outs earlier in the season."
Witmeyer said.
David Esquer continued his recent hot streak with
an RBI single to right in the sixth for Stanford's final
run. According to Witmeyer. the performance of
Esquer, Frank Carey and himself will be crucial
down the Six-Pac stretch and in postseason play.
"The bottom of the order will be the key from here
on out," he said. "We've been winning games even
though Frank and I haven't been going great. If we
get it going, we should score a lot of runs getting on
for the top of the order, which has been doing a great
job all year."
San Jose State's Greg Banda reached winning
pitcher Rob Wassenaar (4-1) for a homer to center In
the sixth, and the Spartans picked up another run in
the seventh on three straight hits off A1 Osuna before
Steve Chitren came on to coax a 6-4-3 double-play
ball out of pinch hitter Brian Fisher.
Chitren had to struggle in the ninth, however,
before recording his 10th save of the year. With the
strike zone seemingly smaller, the Spartans used
three walks and two hits to bring the winning run to
the plate before Chitren fanned Brian Rhodes to end
it.
"He (the umpire) may have been squeezing me a
little, but I didn't have good stuff today." Chitren
said. "I've got to make them beat me, but today I beat
myself."
Although he was unhappy about the walks.
Chitren had no quarrel with the bottom line. "As
long as we come out with a win, that's all that mat
ters," he said.
Card notes
Starting pitcher Jim Price had beaten the Spartans twice
this year, but could not escape the third inning, leaving
with runners on second and third and no outs.
Wassenaar got Stanford out of the inning unscathed, but
not without the help of a rather strange double play.
On Fernando Viera's sharp groundball to Witmeyer, the
runner at third — Mike Haruff — did not break, but Monte
Brooks at second did. Witmeyer retired Viera, then threw to
Esquer to trap Brooks. Esquer chased Brooks toward
third, but when Haruff made a move toward the plate, the
Cardinal shortstop veered across the infield to cut him off.
Esquer then threw to catcher Ed Sprague. who ran
Haruff down for the second out. Wassenaar then struck out
Anderson to end the inning.
