Good things certainly do
come to those who wait.
After an almost winless
season in 1986, the Stanford
Softball team has come back to
post an 18-2 record after two
wins against USC Saturday, 6-
0 and 10-2.
"They were Incredible." Stan
ford Coach Tami Brown said of
her players' performance
against the Trojans. "The team
played awesome. We just outhit
them, outplayed them, out
classed them."
Highlighting the Cardinal's
offense was senior Laura Bu
chanan, who hit her first col
legiate home run Saturday to
contribute to the squad's pow
erful hitting effort.
The squad's defense, behind
the pitching of Lisa Buchanan
and Dawn Becker, was equally
formidable. "Lisa Buchanan

had eight strikeouts in the first
game and Dawn Becker pitched
well In the second," Brown
said. "We had great defensive
play."
All of this is veiy impressive
for a team that was just
dropped down from a varsity to
a club team, and one for which
being shut out was a common
occurence last year.
"This team is a Cinderella
story," noted Brown, the rookie
head coach from Arizona State.
"It is a great turnaround."
Brown attributes this
metamorphasis to her different
training philosophy. "We
practice hard and we practice
the correct fundamentals and
basics.
"The atmosphere is great, the
attitude is great," Brown
added. "They play well to
gether."
The Cardinal resumes action
this Saturday. April 25, at 3:00
in a double-header.
