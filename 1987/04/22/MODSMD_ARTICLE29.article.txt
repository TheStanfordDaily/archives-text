ton College. Delaware and William and Mary.
In addition to Stanford and Yale, the Vienna, Va.
native had also been considering Boston College,
Delaware and William and Mary.
"First of all, I thought Stanford was the best aca
demic place I could go," Patrick said. "Then I came
and visited — and it was just beautiful. It seemed like
the perfect place to go to college."
Patrick, who averaged a league-leading 20.1 points
per game in his senior year at Sidwell Friends High
School in Washington D.C., is also positive about the
Stanford basketball program. "It's an up-and-coming
program." Patrick said. "Coach (Mike) Montgomery
really has a winning attitude, and I'd like to be part of
a winning program. I think I can contribute to the
team next year and in the future."
Montgomery is equally enthusiastic about his
newest player. "The addition of John Patrick wraps
up what we consider to be a solid recruiting year in
our first year at Stanford,'' Montgomery said.
"Patrick has the ability to play both guard positions
and will provide us good guard depth in the immedi
ate future. He comes from an excellent basketball
area, and with his background and skills, he should

be a solid performer for the next four years."
A two-time all-league selection for the Interstate
Athletic Conference, Patrick was the last Stanford
recruit to sign a letter of intent to play during the
1986-87 signing period. The Cardinal signed 6-9,
245-pound center Lang Meyer of The Woodlands.
Texas, and 6-7, 225-pound forward Andrew Vlahov
of Perth, Australia, in November.
Along with scoring over 20 points a game his
senior season, Patrick also averaged nine rebounds
and seven assists a game. As a junior, the point
guard averaged 18.3 points, 7.5 rebounds and five
assists per game. He was team MVP at Sidwell
Friends two straight years, and established several
single-game school records, including most points
(29 — twice), most field goals (13) and most assists
(13).
Patrick was named to the all-tournament team in
the Hill Tournament in Pottsdam, Pa., was
nominated a McDonald's All-America and was cho
sen honorable mention all-metropolitan by The
Washington Post the past two years.
Patrick was also an all-league performer in football,
leading his team in all-purpose yardage as a receiver,
a free safety (seven interceptions) and kickoff and
punt returner.
Despite living on the opposite coast, Patrick had
an opportunity to see the Cardinal basketball team
on television a few times this year. "I saw them play a
couple of times." he said. "I like their style of play. It's
an upbeat style — and I'm used to playing in
playgrounds in Washington D.C."
