# Senate gives up on CIR; will not appoint students
## 
### MARK LAWRENCE Senior staff writer 
The ASSU Senate voted last night not to
appoint any students to the Committee on
Investment Responsibility (CIR) for the
next school year, charging that the it has
not been effective in instituting the Uni
versity's selective divestment policy.
The bill, passed by a vote of 11-9, was
adopted despite the pleas of University
President DonalcJ Kennedy, who earlier in
the meeting warned the senate that a deci
sion not to appoint students to the CIR
would lead the Board of Trustees to believe
that students do not have the patience to
consider complex issues like divestment.
Senior John van Loben Sels, the senator
who proposed the bill last week, argued
that the CIR cannot effectively implement
Stanford's selective divestment policy be
cause the trustees have given the CIR an
impossible job. He said students should
not be a part of what he called-a-trustee ef
fort to delude the Stanford community
into believing there is an effective divest
ment policy.
The CIR, a 12-member committee of stu
dents, faculty, staff and alumni, advises
the trustees' Special Committee on Invest
ment Responsibility (SCIR), which makes
Stanford's final investment decisions.
In other matters, the senate voted last
night to support the conclusions of the
Western Culture Task Force. The task
force issued a report last week proposing
that the eight Western Culture tracks in

include primary texts by women and
minorities, and abolish the core reading
list common to all the tracks.
Several senators said they hoped the
task force's conclusions would spark more
debate that would be useful in formulating
(he final answer to the controversy over the
Western Culture program.
In discussion of the CIR proposal, van
Loben Sels, who served on the CIR for two
quarters before resigning last week, said
the CIR cannot possibly evaluate corporate
activity in South Africa from thousands of
miles away. For that reason, he said, the
SCIR and the CIR should base investment
decisions involving South Africa on com
panies' adherence to the Sullivan Prin
ciples, standards for corporate activity
that promote racial equality in South
Africa.
The CIR and the SCIR also currently con
sider other evidence of a company's perfor
mance in South Africa — evidence that van
Loben Sels said is unnecessary since Sul
livan ratings are the best indicator of a
company's racial policies.
Van Loben Sels also said, that the SCIR
pays little attention to CIR recommen
dations on divestment and shareholder
resolutions involving withdrawal from
South Africa.
Kennedy, in making his quarterly report
to the senate, said that the SCIR always lis
tens carefully to CIR advice and has sup-
ported CIR recommendations
more than half the time.
"The CIR is, 1 think, the right
approach, even though it hasn't
yielded the right result every
time." Kennedy said. He warned
that if students relinquish their
voice on University committees,
faculty and trustees will perceive
that students are not patient
enough to help make decisions on
sensitive and complex issues.
The senate's decision also came
despite the opposition of CIR
Chairman Frederick Hillier and
the two remaining student mem
bers. graduate students Bart Nar
der and Lisa Goldman.
Hillier. a professor of operations
research, said Monday that stu
dent input is vital to the CIR. But
he added that the CIR would con
tinue to operate without students
appointed by the ASSU.
"The CIR will, in one form or an
other. with or without students,
continue to be the official body
that is making recommendations

to the trustees." Htllier said.
"Rather than make the CIR less ef
fective. we should work to make
the CIR more effective."
Htllier said that at least the sen
ate should postpone considera
tion of the bill until the CIR has
finished drafting a new set of di
vestment guidelines that it will
propose to the trustees at their
meeting next month. Although
Hillier would not elaborate on the
details of the new guidelines, he
said they would, if adopted by the
trustees, accelerate the pace of
SCIR decision-making and lead to
a flurry of divestment.
A motion by the Council of
Presidents to postpone considera
tion of the bill until the senate's
May 19 meeting was rejected when
ASSU Senate Chairman Jeff
Soukup broke a 10-10 deadlock
and forced a vote.
Van Loben Sels said he was
"elated" with the vote, particularly
since it was close. "That shows to
me how seriously we take our role
in University governance and how
desperately we want to be a part of
the University's investment
policy." he said.

Soukup broke a 10-10 deadlock
and forced a vote.
Van Loben Sels said he was
"elated" with the vote, particularly
since it was close. "That shows to
me how seriously we take our role
in University governance and how
desperately we want to be a part of
the University's investment
policy." he said.
