# Senate gives up on CIR; will not appoint students

### MARK LAWRENCE Senior staff writer 
The ASSU Senate voted last night not to
appoint any students to the Committee on
Investment Responsibility (CIR) for the
next school year, charging that the it has
not been effective in instituting the Uni
versity's selective divestment policy.
The bill, passed by a vote of 11-9, was
adopted despite the pleas of University
President DonalcJ Kennedy, who earlier in
the meeting warned the senate that a deci
sion not to appoint students to the CIR
would lead the Board of Trustees to believe
that students do not have the patience to
consider complex issues like divestment.
Senior John van Loben Sels, the senator
who proposed the bill last week, argued
that the CIR cannot effectively implement
Stanford's selective divestment policy be
cause the trustees have given the CIR an
impossible job. He said students should
not be a part of what he called-a-trustee ef
fort to delude the Stanford community
into believing there is an effective divest
ment policy.
The CIR, a 12-member committee of stu
dents, faculty, staff and alumni, advises
the trustees' Special Committee on Invest
ment Responsibility (SCIR), which makes
Stanford's final investment decisions.
In other matters, the senate voted last
night to support the conclusions of the
Western Culture Task Force. The task
force issued a report last week proposing
that the eight Western Culture tracks in

include primary texts by women and
minorities, and abolish the core reading
list common to all the tracks.
Several senators said they hoped the
task force's conclusions would spark more
debate that would be useful in formulating
(he final answer to the controversy over the
Western Culture program.
In discussion of the CIR proposal, van
Loben Sels, who served on the CIR for two
quarters before resigning last week, said
the CIR cannot possibly evaluate corporate
activity in South Africa from thousands of
miles away. For that reason, he said, the
SCIR and the CIR should base investment
decisions involving South Africa on com
panies' adherence to the Sullivan Prin
ciples, standards for corporate activity
that promote racial equality in South
Africa.
The CIR and the SCIR also currently con
sider other evidence of a company's perfor
mance in South Africa â€” evidence that van
Loben Sels said is unnecessary since Sul
livan ratings are the best indicator of a
company's racial policies.
Van Loben Sels also said, that the SCIR
pays little attention to CIR recommen
dations on divestment and shareholder
resolutions involving withdrawal from
South Africa.
Kennedy, in making his quarterly report
to the senate, said that the SCIR always lis
tens carefully to CIR advice and has sup-
