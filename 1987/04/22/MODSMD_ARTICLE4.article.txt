# Med School will test new drug to fight AIDS
## 
### LORI SILVER Staff writer 
A drug that may fight off AIDS and the
AIDS-related complex (ARC) will be tested
at the Stanford Medical School, according
to a medical school doctor.
Dr. Gail Skowron, a postdoctoral fellow
working at the medical school's AIDS
Treatment Evaluation Unit, said she has
begun screening patients to receive the
drug called dideoxycytidine (DDC). The

federally funded AIDS unit is one of 14
nationwide.
According to Skowron. DDC is "more
potent" than AZT, the current drug
prescribed for AIDS patients. While AZT
lessens the effect of AIDS, it often carries
serious side effects that some patients
cannot tolerate. Skowron said.
"Even though AZT decreases the num
ber of infections and the number of
deaths (resulting from AIDS), there is al
ways room for improvement. If there is a

drug better than AZT, we would like to
find it," she said.
Skowron noted that it is unlikely DDC
will turn out to be a cure for AIDS.
Preliminary studies of DDC performed
on human subjects show that it is less
toxic than AZT, Skowron said. "It has the
same action against the virus with less ef
fect on the cells of the body," she said.
Researchers here testing the drug on
AIDS and ARC patients are looking for a
decrease in the activity of the disease and

any side effects the patients might
develop. Skowron said.
The "dose-escalation" study will start
eight AIDS and eight ARC patients at a
low dose of DDC for eight weeks. Skowron
said. If the initial dose is tolerated suc
cessfully, 16 new patients will be entered
into the study at a higher dose, she said.
The study's objective is to measure how
high the DDC dosage can go without the
patients developing side effects, she said.
Skowron said she expects the study to

last at least one year. A patient who
doesn't respond to the drug will partici
pate in the study for three months, while
a patient who responds will participate
for six months, she said.
If the study proves that the drug is ef
fective. the government will conduct an
other study with hundreds of patients or
put the drug into limited distribution, ac
cording to Skowron.
The Stanford center is headed by Dr.
Thomas Merigan, professor of medicine.
