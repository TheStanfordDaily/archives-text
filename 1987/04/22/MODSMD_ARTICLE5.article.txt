The longest-living heart-lung transplant
recipient, 36-year-old Charles Walker, died
Sunday at Stanford University Hospital.
Walker, who was a Mountain View resident,
died at 8:20 p.m. of renal failure and infection,
according to a Stanford Medical Center
spokesperson.
Walker received his first heart-lung
transplant in 1981 at Stanford Hospital and
later received a second transplant in 1984 after
suffering respiratory problems.
Walker was readmitted to the hospital April
2 with pneumonia. He had just returned from
Florida, where he was visiting his brother. Ten
days later, he went into intensive care and was
put on a respirator.
Walker was born with a heart defect that
gradually worsened as he got older and caused
damage to his lungs, according to his mother,
June Spangenburg.
In 1980. Walker was told by doctors that he
had only a 2 percent chance of living for an

other five years. He received second opinions
at St. Joseph's Hospital in Syracuse. N.Y., and
at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester. Minn., before
coming to Stanford Hospital.
Walker was the second person to receive a
heart-lung transplant at the hospital, follow
ing Arizona newspaper executive Mary Gohlke.
Gohlke received her transplant March 9, 1981
and died May 6. 1986. after falling down at
home and suffering internal bleeding.
Walker's first transplant was performed May
1, 1981 by Dr. Bruce Reitz and Dr. Norman
Shumway. On June 17, 1984. Walker received
a second heart-lung transplant after suffering
respiratory problems. Despite this setback.
Walker had few other problems. Spangenburg
said.
"He had a good life those six years," said
Spangenburg.
"Stanford was real good to Chuck." said his
mother. "Without tnem (the doctors and
nurses at the hospital), he would have been
gone long ago. Everyone there was real nice to
him."

"He was one darn great kid," said Spangen
burg. "He had a strong will to live and he
fought hard to live. Chuck certainly had a lot of
friends."
Walker was born and raised in Newark Val
ley. N.Y. and moved to Mountain View after his
first transplant. He was a licensed funeral di
rector, but he also loved to refinish furniture,
paint and do needlework in his spare time.
Walker is the 21st of 40 Stanford University
Hospital heart-lung transplant recipients to
die. The longest-living heart-lung transplant
patient is now 44-year-old Ron Grunden of
Ventura, Calif. Grunden received his
transplant Nov. 5. 1982.

four brothers. Bill Walker of Blnghampton.
