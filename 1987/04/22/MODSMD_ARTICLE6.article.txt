# This house focuses on human biology

### AIMEE BERZINS 
While the initials RF. RA, TA,
and AA sound familiar to most
students, many are not aware
that FAs and FFs also exist on
campus. Focus assistants and
faculty fellows are both parts of
the newest idea in Stanford
residences — the focus house.
Stanford's first and only
focus house is Adams House in
Sterling Quadrangle, Adams
has been the center of the new
human biology focus program
since the beginning of the year.
The dorm's program, initiated
last year through the combined
efforts of Residential Education
and the Human Biology Depart

ment, is designed to create a
program that centers around a
specific area of study.
Although originally planned
as a stepping stone to a theme
house, the Adams focus pro
gram has combined both the
elements of normal residence
living and a theme house at
mosphere.
"The program is designed to
introduce people to the re
search in a particular, area
without restricting it to just
people in human biology," says
Gene Flood, the resident fellow
at Adams.
Although (he hou.se does tar
get a certain major, the program
does not exclude those with differ
ent majors. "It is not specifically
for human biology majors, but for
people who are interested in is
sues of the social sciences," says
Junior Holly Urban, one of 10 FAs
in Adams.
The FAs, who were selected
before the Draw last spring, are
central to the development and or
ganization of the human biology
related programs for the house.
They work with the RFs and resi
dent assistants to provide an at
mosphere for informal intellectual
exchanges of Ideas as well as fac
ulty/student interaction outside
of the classroom.
Junior Bill Penney, another FA,
says he feels that one of the
greatest aspects of the program is
the opportunity it provides for
students to improve communica
tion with faculty.
"Twenty faculty fellows are di
rectly associated with the aca
demic program for the year," Pen
ney says.
Professors from all departments
were chosen from a group of
nominations by the residents at
the beginning of the year. A large
catered dinner was then held at
Adams for all the FFs and resi

dents to kick off the program.
"We have had one big social
event each quarter to enable the
faculty fellows to meet the stu
dents on an Informal level," Pen
ney says.
In addition, the FFs are also
invited to attend every house pro
gram. Through better communi
cation between the professors and
students, the FAs hope to provide
residents with opportunities to
get a closer look at the Stanford
faculty. They also plan to allow for
faculty familiarization with stu
dents that they may be writing
recommendations for in the fu
ture.
Adams residents say that one of
the best features of the focus
house is that it is made up of such
a broad field of research that stu
dents of almost any major get In
terested.
"Because human biology is an
interdisciplinary field — it covers
everything from biology to eco
nomics to psychology — the pro
grams contain a range of perspec
tives for students," says John
Hogan, an RAin Adams.
It is important to note that
these programs are designed for
student/resident interests, Hogan
says. "Although there are a lot of
academic programs offered, we're
not turning the residence into an
other classroom, but providing
fun and interesting programs
which promote small group dis

cussions without classroom pres
sure."
The residents do not feel they
must go to every program every
week. "It's very much like any
other residence with the standard
Res Ed programs, plus a variety of
special interest ones which relate
to the focus," Hogan says.
Topics covered this year have In
cluded a discussion led by Jerry
Talley, a lecturer in human biol
ogy. on the fundamentals of
relationships and the rituals of
the first date; a discussion on
birth control methods in the year
2000 with Chemistry Prof. Carl
Djerassi, the inventor of the birth
control pill; a discussion on ways
to combat the problems of hunger
and homelessness on the Penin
sula; a presentation about the use
of hypnosis In medicine; and a
discussion on garbology, the
study of garbage In societies.
The general consensus by all in
volved In the human biology focus
program is that it had a successful
first year, yet is still in a transi
tional process.
"Everyone in conjunction with
developing the focus program had
their own ideas as to what it
should be," Urban explains. "It
was difficult to form a collective
idea as to how the program would
be run, but ultimately it has been
up to the FAs to design the pro
gram."
"It has taken us a year to

develop it (the program) into what
we feel it should be," Hogan says.
"Now we can go on from here to
determine how successful the pro
gram will be with next year's stu
dents."
One of the biggest problems af
fecting the program was the fact
that it was not announced as a
focus house until after the Draw
last spring, and many of residents
in Adams were not prepared for it.
According to the FAs, the fact that

there was a good response from
the residents in such a trial year is
evidence of the program's success.
"We are hoping with the in
creased student awareness, there
will be many more students in
volved in the programs next year,"
Urban says.
The greatest measure of suc
cess, however, is the fact that the
two main goals of the focus house

were met — the quality of residen
tial progamming Improved, and
many faculty members came to
the house, according to the FAs.
The focus house will continue to
address short-term goals for the
upcoming year, improving both
the quantity and quality of the
programs, and increasing student
and resident attendance at the
programs as the house becomes
more established.
