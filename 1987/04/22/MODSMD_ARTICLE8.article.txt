Swiss account funded contras
WASHINGTON — A shadowy and scandal-plagued army Intelli
gence unit — code-named Yellow Fruit — secretly opened a num
bered Swiss bank account that may have been used as a conduit
for funds to aid the Nlcaraguan contras. a Pentagon official said
yesterday.
The official said that the bank account at Credit Suisse in
Geneva was unauthorized by the Department of Defense and the
Army command, which did not even know that it existed until last
month when CBS News supplied the Pentagon with the account
number.
( BS reported Monday that *75,000 from the account was used
by Marine Lt. Col Oliver North and an associate, retired Air Force
Maj. Gen. Richard Secord, to charter a Danish freighter to deliver
a load of Soviet bloc rifles and other weapons to the contras in the
spring of 1985, at a time when Congress had prohibited U.S. mili
tary aid to the rebels.
I he official said that the account has been frozen so funds can
no longer be withdrawn. Nevertheless, the account apparently
survived for more than three years after the demise of the Army
unit that opened it.
Alfonsin shuffles army leadership
BUENOS AIP'LS, Argentina — Argentine President Raul Alfon
sin followed a dramatic Easter victory over military mutineers
Monday by shuffling the command structure of his troubled
armed forces.
Alfonsin's army commander, Gen. Hector Erenu, who had
proved unable to suffocate the vest-pocket rebellion by disaffected
officers, was retired at his own request, the government an
nounced. Eight other generals were also being retired at their re
quest, a government communique said late Monday.
Alfonsin then faced the challenge of finding a new commanding
general loyal to the government but also able to effectively com
mand a disciplined institution afflicted with sagging morale and
deeply preoccupied with its past and its future.
After a day of consultations. Alfonsin named Gen. Jose Caridi,
until Monday the army's fourth-ranking general, as the new com
mander. Caridi. a 56-year-old bachelor, m an artillery officer who
had been the army's inspector general.
1 he mutineers had called for the appointment of a general far
down on the promotion list, but Alfonsin ignored them, selecting
instead one of the most senior generals. The general named by the
rebels as their choice for the commander's job was one of those
retired.
Grenade kills cadet in Soweto
JOHANNESBURG, South Africa — A hand grenade thrown at
police cadets yesterday killed one person and injured 64 in the
black township of Soweto, the government information bureau
said.
The bomb was hurled from a passing car into a group of cadets
drilling on the exercise ground of the Soweto police academy. The
dead man was a black. Four of the injured were in a critical condi
tion. doctors said.
There was no immediate indication that the attack was con
nected with cases of arson last week in railway stations around
Johannesburg. More than 50 carriages have been set on fire and
damage was estimated at several million rand. No new arson has
been reported since soldiers and heavily armed police began
protecting the stations Monday.
The South African Transport Service blames the arson on radi
cal groups among black railwaymen who have been on strike for
six weeks. The railwaymen's union has strongly denied the ac
cusation.
Agents seize Laßouche assets
WASHINGTON — Federal and state law enforcement agents
seized businesses yesterday controlled by political extremist Lyn
don Laßouche in a court-approved effort to collect more than *21
million in fines that have been assessed against groups affiliated
with Laßouche.
The early-morning raids by U.S. marshals, FBI agents and Vir
ginia state police on three Laßouche operations near his
headquarters in Leesburg. Va., were conducted in response to un
paid penalties imposed by federal courts when Laßouche officials
refused two years ago to turn over financial records being sought
in a federal criminal investigation.
As a result of that investigation. 13 Laßouche associates have
been charged with credit card fraud and conspiracy for allegedly
bilking hundreds of people out of more than *1 million during
Laßouche's unsuccessful 1984 presidential campaign. Authori
ties said many elderly people were persuaded to use their credit
cards to make campaign loans that Laßouche aides never in
tended to repay.
Biden, Dole lead funding race
WASHINGTON — The two presidential hopefuls reporting the
most cash in the bank at this early stage of the 1988 campaign
have yet to officially declare their candidacies: Sens. Bob Dole, R-
Kan.. and Joseph R. Biden Jr., D-Del.
Through March 31. Dole had a *2.5 million stash and Biden re
ported *2.1 million, according to latest filings at the Federal Elec
tion Commission.
Records show that Dole's presidential committee had a
*208,000 cash balance as of March 31. Moreover, an aide said
Dole plans to fully tap *2.1 million left over from his 1986 Senate
re-election campaign. Also. Dole's subsidiary political action com
mittee. Campaign America, has *202.000 available to boost his
White House quest, primarily by making donations to lower-level
Republican candidates across the country.
Ostensibly, such PACs are prohibited from engaging in presi
dential campaign activities, but Dole and others have clearly used
them to advance their White House ambitions.
Biden. whose official announcement is expected in June, leads
all Democratic contenders with *1.7 million in cash in his presi
dential committee, offset by *135.000 in debts, and a *421,000
surplus available to him from his Senate campaign committee.
French Socialist Party faces split
PARIS — With one foot in power and the other out. the French
Socialist Party Is suffering from an identity crisis.
The most prominent Socialist leaders, sobered by managing the
country from 1981 to 1986 and eager to keep a Socialist as presi
dent. increasingly have moved away from tradition-minded party
militants who still seek Inspiration in leftist Ideology and all-night
debates on political platforms.
The way the party reconciles the split will go a long way toward
determining its chances In a new presidential election, scheduled
Just over a year from now. and in subsequent parliamentary elec
tions. More broadly, it will help shape the Socialist role in politics
for years to come as voters drift away from the left-right Ideological
standoff that long has characterized French elections.
