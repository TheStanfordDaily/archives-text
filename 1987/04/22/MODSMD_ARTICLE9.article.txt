# Court extends death penalty
## 
### 
WASHINGTON — The Supreme Court ruled
yesterday that the death penalty may be
Imposed on all participants in a felony that
results in murder — even if they neither killed
nor intended to kill.
The 5-to-4 decision involved two brothers
who participated in a kidnapping but were not
aware that the victims would be slain and were
nearby when their father did the killing.
The ruling will allow the death penalty to be
imposed far more often in most of the 37 states
that have capital punishment laws, lawyers on
both sides agreed.
It also substantially undercuts a 1982 deci
sion in which the court ruled out the execution
of a defendant whose only role was to drive a
getaway car following a murder. That decision
appeared to bar the execution of anyone but
the person who actually committed the murder
in cases such as armed robbery or other
serious crimes.
Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, writing for
the court yesterday, said an accomplice's
"major participation" in a felony that leads to a
murder, when "combined with reckless indif
ference to human life," may be enough to war
rant capital punishment.
Justice Byron White, who wrote the 1982
decision in Enmund v. Florida, which was also
decided 5-4, joined O'Connor along with Chief
Justice William Rehnquist and Justices Lewis
Powell and Antonin Scalia.
The opinion provoked a strongly worded dis
sent by Justice William Brennan, joined by
Justices Thurgood Marshall, Harry Blackmun
and John Paul Stevens.
Yesterday's decision, Tison vs. Arizona,, in
volved two young brothers, Ricky and
Raymond Tison, who smuggled weapons into

the Arizona State Prison at Florence in 1978 in
order to help their father, a convicted mur
derer. escape. The group, along with another
brother and the father's cellmate, Randy
Greenawalt. developed car trouble as they
drove through the Arizona desert.
They flagged down a passing car occupied by
a couple named Lyons, their 2-year-old son
and 15-year-old niece. While the two Tison
sons went off to fill a water jug to leave behind
for the Lyons, their father and Greenawalt
murdered the family with repeated shotgun
blasts.
The group was caught after a shootout at a
police blockade. One brother was killed. The
father escaped fnto the desert where he died of
exposure. Greenawalt was convicted of mur
der. Ricky and Raymond Tison were convicted
of four murders under the Arizona accomplice
liability and felony-murder statutes.
The Arizona Supreme Court upheld their
death sentences after the Enmund ruling by
saying that the brothers essentially intended
to kill because they could have foreseen in en
gineering the breakout "that life would be
taken."
O'Connor, who was an Arizona state judge at
the time of the highly publicized events, said
the Tison brothers — even though they had
not intended to kill anyone — had a "degree of
participation in the crimes (that) was major
rather than minor." enough to support a deter
mination that they had a "reckless indifference
to human life."
The Tison case was far different from the
1982 case, she said, where the getaway driver's
participation in a house robbery-murder was
"attenuated."
She said the state court's standard was too

broad, however, and ordered that it review the
case under yesterday's standard to determine
whether the Tisons showed a "reckless Indif
ference" for life.
Brennan, writing for the dissenters, said the
Tison case was virtually identical to the 1982
Enmund case, "Like Enmund," he wrote, "the
Tisons neither killed nor attempted or In
tended to kill anyone. Like Enmund, the
Tisons have been sentenced to death for the in
tentional acts of others which the Tisons did
not expect , , . and over which they had no
control.
"Unlike Enmund, however, the Tisons will
be the first individuals in over 30 years to be
executed for such behavior." Brennan said,
even though there are laws on the books in
many states that allow accomplices to be ex
ecuted.
"The fact that this court's death penalty
jurisprudence can validate different results in
. . . indistinguishable cases suggests that
something more profoundly disturbing than
faithlessness to precedent is at work in capital
sentencing," Brennan said.
The ruling appears at odds with most high
court decisions involving the scope of the
death penalty. The court has tended to narrow
rather than broaden the use of capital punish
ment in such cases as kipnapping or rape.
The decision triggered an angry response
from death penalty opponents, such as Henry
Schwarzschild of the American Civil Liberties
Union. "There is no point in mincing words,"
he said, adding that the ruling is "barbaric
and outrageous" and"the argument used to
arrive at (the ruling) is a piece of brainless
sophistry."

not intended to kill anyone — had a "degree of
participation in the crimes (that) was major
rather than minor." enough to support a deter
mination that they had a "reckless indifference
to human life."
The Tison case was far different from the
1982 case, she said, where the getaway driver's
participation in a house robbery-murder was
"attenuated."
She said the state court's standard was too

broad, however, and ordered that it review the
case under yesterday's standard to determine
whether the Tisons showed a "reckless Indif
ference" for life.
Brennan, writing for the dissenters, said the
Tison case was virtually identical to the 1982
Enmund case, "Like Enmund," he wrote, "the
Tisons neither killed nor attempted or In
tended to kill anyone. Like Enmund, the
Tisons have been sentenced to death for the in
tentional acts of others which the Tisons did
not expect , , . and over which they had no
control.
"Unlike Enmund, however, the Tisons will
be the first individuals in over 30 years to be
executed for such behavior." Brennan said,
even though there are laws on the books in
many states that allow accomplices to be ex
ecuted.
"The fact that this court's death penalty
jurisprudence can validate different results in
. . . indistinguishable cases suggests that
something more profoundly disturbing than
faithlessness to precedent is at work in capital
sentencing," Brennan said.
The ruling appears at odds with most high
court decisions involving the scope of the
death penalty. The court has tended to narrow
rather than broaden the use of capital punish
ment in such cases as kipnapping or rape.
The decision triggered an angry response
from death penalty opponents, such as Henry
Schwarzschild of the American Civil Liberties
Union. "There is no point in mincing words,"
he said, adding that the ruling is "barbaric
and outrageous" and"the argument used to
arrive at (the ruling) is a piece of brainless
sophistry."
