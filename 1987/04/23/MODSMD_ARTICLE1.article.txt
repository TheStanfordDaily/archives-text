# Animal rights activists to march
## 
### JAY FRY Staff writer 
Animal rights activists will
march on the Stanford campus to
morrow and engage in civil dis
obedience to protest the Univer
sity's use of animals for scientific
research.
"A number of protesters will risk
arrest" during the 9 a.m. march
through the Stanford Shopping
Center to an undisclosed location
on campus, said Sharon Proietti
of the Mid-Peninsula Animal
Rights Coalition.
Similar protests at Stanford
April 24 and Nov. 10 last year
resulted in more than 40 arrests.
The demonstration tomorrow
will protest Stanford's "unre
sponsiveness to appeals for dis
cussion of the use of laboratory
animals'' and will be "nonviolent
in the tradition of Gandhi and
Martin Luther King," Proietti
said.
According to Proietti, animal
rights activists from"the East Bay
to Santa Cruz" will also be present
at simultaneous demonstrations
at UC-Berkeley, UC-Davis and San
Francisco State. The protests are
intended to honor a World Day for
Laboratory Animals, she said.
In a letter to University Presi
dent Donald Kennedy earlier this
month, the coalition called for
Stanford to "start meaningful dis
cussions with representatives of
the animals rights community to
develop a plan to phase out Uni
versity reliance on the experimen
tal use and abuse of animals."
Kennedy replied in a letter Tues
day that he cannot not* agree to
such a request and does not con
sider lending "even tacit support
for the position that all vital re
search in the biological and medi
cal sciences can be performed
now, or in the foreseeable future,
without using animals.
"Non-animal models — com
puters, cell cultures and others —
are heavily used here at Stanford
and elsewhere, but they cannot
serve as adequate substitutes for
research now done with animals,"
Kennedy's letter states.
According to Kennedy, Stan
ford's animal research facilities
are "highly regulated enterprises"
subject to unannounced federal
inspections.
All research involving animals
must also be approved by the
funding agency and a Stanford
oversight committee, Kennedy
wrote. This committee, the Ad
ministrative Panel on Laboratory
Animal Care, includes University
researchers, staff and a student as
well as three community members
— including two veterinarians —
not affiliated with Stanford.
According to Lise Giraud, an
animal rights activist and a libra
rian at Green Library, tomorrow's
protest will highlight that animal
research "is a very big business"
at Stanford and other univer
sities. "Animal research is career
building, not disease-fighting,"
she said.
Giraud said much animal re-
search has "no justification" and
is often merely an attempt to
create "knowledge for knowledge s
sake, knowing it will get funded."
Assoc. Prof. Thomas Hamm, di
rector of the division of laboratory
animal medicine at the Medical
School, said that although much
of the research using animals is
"science for science's sake," it can
yield practical results for human
beings.
"That which is deemed
'unnecessary' is a value judg
ment." said Prof. Seymour Levine.

a researcher in endocrinology and
psychobiology. "Nobody can
predict the nature of a whole basic
research endeavor" and what
practical use will come from each
instance of animal research, he
said.
In its letter to Kennedy, the Mid-
Peninsula Animal Rights Coali
tion urged Stanford to:
□ Request increased funding for
the development of research tech
nologies that do not injure
animals.
□ Forego requiring science and
medical students to vivisect or dis
ect animals.
□ Allow medically trained people
chosen by the animal rights com
munity unscheduled access to

animal research facilites to moni
tor them.
□ End the use of lost and
abandoned pets purchased from
local pounds as research tools im
mediately.
□ Take immediate steps to end
psychological experimentation on
animals.
□ Begin discussions to create a
plan to phase out the University's
experimental use of animals.
"Their allegations are very
tired," said Larry Horton. Stan
ford associate vice president for
public affairs. "(The proposals] are
really embarrassing retreads" that
repeat demands presented at pre
vious protests.
"They (members of the coali

tion) attempt to appear reasonable
and are, in fact, very unreasona
ble." he said. "The state of science
requires animals in research." If
animals are excluded. Horton
said, society will "pay the price for
freezing medical knowledge at this
particular point."
"I wish we could (stop using
animals)," Hamm said. "But we
have to (use them) in order to
make advances."
Clad in black and carrying black
balloons, the protesters will meet
at 9 a.m. tomorrow at the corner
of El Camino and Quarry Road at
the Stanford Shopping Center
and proceed through campus to
an undisclosed destination at
9:30 a.m., Proietti said.
