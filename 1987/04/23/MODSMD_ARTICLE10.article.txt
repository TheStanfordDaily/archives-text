# Death penalty challenge rejected
## 
### 
WASHINGTON - The Supreme
Court, in what could be the last
broad-based constitutional chal
lenge to the death penalty, yester
day rejected arguments that a
state's capital punishment system
must be struck down because of
statistics that suggest racial dis
crimination.
The 5-4 opinion by Justice
Lewis Powell, Jr., said that
statistical discrepancies in sen
tencing are an inevitable part of
the criminal justice system, and
that without stronger proof of dis
crimination, the court would not

strike down laws or invalidate sen
tences. Death penalty opponents,
he suggested, should take their
case to the state legislatures, not
the courts.
He was joined by Chief Justice
William Rehnquist and justices
Byron White, Sandra Day
O'Connor and Antonin Scalia.
Justices William Brennan, Thur
good Marshall. John Paul Stevens
and Harry Blackmun dissented.
Death penalty opponents, who
have been striving for a decade to
come up with a successful consti
tutional challenge to death

penalty statutes, were despondent
about the ruling, saying that it ap
peared the high court was closing
the door to any major challenges.
Jack Boger. an attorney with
the NAACP Legal Defense and
Educational Fund, who repre
sented the defendant in the case,
said the court "would only accept
direct evidence in (his) case. That
is beyond the power of lawyers to
present" because it would require
"breaking the sanctity of the jury
room and entering the minds of
the jurors to see if they were
motivated by race." That standard

of proof cannot be met. he said,
"short of a confession by the
jurors."
Death penalty advocates, such
as Washington Legal Foundation
general counsel Daniel Popeo,
hailed the ruling as a "message
from the court that due process
does not mean endless process."
Popeo said he hoped the decision
would speed up executions and
"block further ridiculous novel le
gal appeals by people who are
guilty of murder. These people are
murderers."
