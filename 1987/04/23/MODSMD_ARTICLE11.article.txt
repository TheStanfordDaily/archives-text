# U.S. failed to stop KGB bugging
## 
### 
WASHINGTON - U.S. officials knew as early
as 1979 that the Soviet KGB was systemati
cally bugging the new American Embassy un
der construction in Moscow, but failed to use
an effective means to stop it. a top State De
partment official acknowledged yesterday.
"I think the supervisory people knew that
the embassy was being bugged." Robert Lamb,
assistant secretary of state for diplomatic se
curity. told a House subcommittee investigat
ing the recent breach of security in Moscow.
Lamb said that U.S. officials were unable to
combat Ihe bugging because they assumed er
roneously that they had an effective "strategy"
for removing KGB-planted bugs. Instead, he
said, they found that the Soviets had integra
ted eavesdropping capability into materials
used to build the embassy.

"Where this strategy was weak was in the
sense that the Soviets used parts of the
structure itself as the bugging." Lamb said.
"These are the kinds of things that are going to
be difficult for us to neutralize."
As a result of the bugging, the unoccupied
embassy building is, in the words of Rep.
Connie Mack, R-Fla., "an eight-story
microphone plugged into the Politburo." A
commission headed by former Secretary of
Defense James Schlesinger is looking into
whether the $'23 million building should be
demolished and replaced to eliminate the
bugs.
Espionage charges filed recently against two
Marine guards who served at the current U.S.
embassy and were allegedly compromised by
sexual affairs with Soviet women, have focused

attention on security breaches in the construc
tion of the new U.S. embassy building in Mos
cow.
The building is part of a *190 million com
plex that is being built under terms of an
agreement reached between the United States
and the Soviet Union in 1972. The agreement
called for the Soviets to provide large prefabr
icated parts of the building, which were viewed
as cheaper than more secure types of construc
tion.
"Security was not considered seriously
enough in the construction from the earliest
stages," Lamb acknowledged.
Rep. Doug Bereuter, R-Neb., said that be
cause of the bugs, the building never can be
used by U.S. officials.
