### MAURICE LEE 
Summer internships in the
offices of local government offi
cials are being sponsored for
the first time ever by the Stan
ford Public Service Center .
The internship program will
"encompass all facets of local
government. but mostly
municipal" in an effort to
promote undergraduate inter
est in local and regional govern
ment issues and policies, ac
cording to Tim Stanton of the
Public Service Center.
Stanton said the program
seeks to include internships
that will offer students concrete
results and experience. "There
are a lot of issues right here . . .
that students can get involved
in,"he said.
The internships will include
opportunities for students to
work in the office of a city
manager or planning depart
ment. or help put together an
environmental-impact study.

Stanton said.
The part-time and full-time
internships are for Stanford
students only and will offer •6-
per-hour stipends.
Although only a few intern
ships have been established so
far, Stanton said the Public
Service Center plans to develop
six to 12 by the beginning of
summer. A "strong interest
response from students" could
lead to the establishment of
more internships, he added.
Financial backing for the
program was provided by a
* 10,000 grant from the Penin
sula Community Foundation.
The grant will be used to sub
sidize internship stipends.
According to Bill Somerville.
executive director of the Penin
sula Community Foundation,
the grant was awarded because
there appears to be little inter
est or opportunity for students
to work within the local and
regional governments.
