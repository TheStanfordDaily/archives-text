## THE 						STANFORD DAILY An Independent Newspaper Draw is unfair

Spring on the Farm is generally a joyous
time; after all, it is the time for spring musi
cals, a full lake and sun-filled afternoons.
However, there is one springtime ritual that
puts a damper on everyone's spirits — the
Draw.
For most Stanford students, drawing is an
awe-inspiring, anxiety-ridden experience.
One random pick from a tub will decide your
housing for a year or two. There are, of
course, a few privileged students who won't
sweat it when they draw their numbers this
year. These are students who have a
returning-resident priority to a desirable ac
commodation. These students have merely
gotten lucky, yet they have been rewarded
first chance at some of the best housing on
campus for two years of their choosing.
Residential Education justifies the use of
returning residency on two principles:
□ Residences need returning members to
carry on traditions and provide continuity
from year to year.
□ Students who have enjoyed and partici
pated in the camaraderie of a residence

should be allowed to return the next year if
they like.
However, there are two faults with Res Ed's
reasoning. First of all, it is naive to believe
that camaraderie draws people back to
residences. If good times were all it took to
make a desirable residence, Wilbur and
Stern would have higher draw numbers then
Storey House. Clearly it is the luxurious
living situation that makes places like 558
Mayfield and Yost House some of the most
desirable on campus.
The second fault in Res Ed's reasoning is
the belief that returning-resident priorities
will provide continuity to the residences.
Many Stanford students break up their
guaranteed years with their unguaranteed
year. Students who have been overseas, off
campus, unguaranteed or stopped out
compose a large portion of returning
resident priorities. They don't provide much
continuity.
Returning-resident priority provides an
unjustifiable advantage to a lucky few. It
should be abolished.
