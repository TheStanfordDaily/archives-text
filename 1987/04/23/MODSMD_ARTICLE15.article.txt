Education will
dispel racism
The history of people in power
is very different from the history
of the common people. People of
color did not see European
colonization as "Manifest Des
tiny." Rather, we saw it as threat
ening to our very existence — and
we were right.
All Stanford students need to
learn about this aspect of history,
too, even if it's not. as Scott Lyon
put it in his recent column, "our
beloved" Western Culture (Daily,
April 20).
Why? Because it is impossible
to live in the .United States and
not be exposed to a culture alien
to one's own.
A true liberal education must
incorporate the studies of other
cultures, such as the Afro-
American. Asian-American,
native American and
Chicano/Mexican-American
cultures. These studies would
give us a better appreciation of
our fellow students' heritage — a
better sense of "where they come
from."
As ignorance is the root of pre
judice and discrimination, this
new understanding would
promote tolerance and help dispel
racism. A world culture course
could achieve this goal and the
Area One Task Force's proposal is
a step in the right direction.
Stanford MEChA fully supports
the Area One Task Force's pro
posed changes to the Western
Culture requirement. The Univer
sity can no longer freely silence
the voices of minorities and
women in the classroom. It is
time for Stanford to recognize
that people of color outside of
Europe have made intellectual

and artistic contributions to the
world we live in.
"If not us, who? If not now.
when?"

Minorities and
women made
contributions
I would like to speak for the
new Western Culture class,
"Western Culture: An Alternative
View." While a great many people
may think minorities and women
are important but do not really
"fit into" Western culture as far as
contributions are concerned, I
feel this is very wrong.
There is very strong evidence
that Western industrialization
could not have reached the
heights that it did without the
slave trade. This is just one point.
The fact is, minority groups —
such as the Afro-American race —
have been pushed to the side for
hundreds of years. Many of the
great inventions that helped the
Western world advance were by
minorities, but these were stolen
by the majority, and it is the
majority that took the credit.
For many years, the real truth
has not been told and it is pain
fully evident that the majority on
this campus and in this country
would like to keep it that way. I
agree that such great societies as
the Greeks did a lot, but many
people either don't know or don't
realize that the Greeks were influ
enced by the Egyptians.
Great minds like St. Augustine
— an African — have influenced
Western culture immensely. It is
easy to go on teaching the wrong
story, because it has been taught
for the longest time.

I feel that one reason there is so
much opposition to Assoc. His
tory Prof. Clayborne Carson's new
course is because many people
know the real truth, but would
not like to be submerged in em
barrassment. I feel that it is ter
ribly important that all of us
make an effort to learn the truth
and break this so called
"tradition" so that we can under
stand the real formation of West
ern culture.
"Western Culture: An Alterna
tive View" must be preserved. It
stands as an effort to bring
minorities and women into the
picture, giving credit where credit
is due.
Taking this course away would
not only disturb me greatly, it
would also disappoint many other
students at Stanford who realize
that minorities and women have
had a great impact on Western
culture and want the real truths
revealed — not in an effort to
embarrass but to educate — and
bring ourselves out of falsehood.

Innovations
must be made
The long-awaited report from
the Western Culture Task Force is
here, and it's wonderful.
I'm sure that most of us at
Stanford are aware of the escalat
ing Western Culture bout. Unfor
tunately, many people here are
being influenced by hype and
emotion rather than by the issue.
It has been said that a Stanford
education is a liberal one. That
may be the case — but there is no
doubt that many of the people
who are in authoritative positions
here are not so liberal. Consider
the staff of The Daily.

During the last few days. The
Daily has featured an editorial,
columns and letters — many of
which were written by staff mem
bers — which have berated the
ideas of Western Culture reform
and which have disparaged the
efforts of the Western Culture
Task Force.
It is really a tragedy that the
writers of these articles have been
incapable of transcending the
temptation to drown us in their
own personal views. If they strove
for liberality, fairness and honest
scholarship, I suspect they would
endeavor to print an equal num
ber of articles expressing the
views of both sides. Perhaps I'm
giving their integrity too much
credit.
It is also sad that The Daily's
editorial board would use such
derogatory phrases as "seventh
grade social studies course" and
"ghetto for unproven junior fac
ulty" to describe what we'd have if
we implemented the proposed
reforms (Daily, April 20). It was
just a classic case of playing on
words to sway opinions. Why not
rely on truth and fact to sway
opinion? Oops, perhaps again, I
am asking too much.
Some have argued the proposed
course would only teach students
historical facts and not how to
think critically and thoroughly. It
would teach us to form our own
ideas about Western culture.
I think that is what the "pro-old
Western culture" folk are really
afraid will happen. They're scared
that if we are exposed to more
than a white-male view of things,
if we are exposed to truth and
reality, we may opt for a view
which is different from theirs.
This is expected. I mean, look
at who is providing the most
serious opposition to reform:
white males. God forbid us to

have views and beliefs that are
relevant to our own lives!
It has been claimed that the
proposed reforms emphasize
"throwing a successful program
out the window." This is so obvi
ously incorrect that it makes me
question if the speaker even read
the proposal. This statement, I'm
sure, was made out of either
ignorance or guilt. Ignorance if
the proposal was not honestly
addressed but its addressors felt
that an affirmative opinion would
admit the inadequacy of the pro
gram. The truth hurts folks! It's
time we faced it!

Upper classes
are in control
of education
I'm not sure what all the fuss is
about. Who could expect the Uni
versity to add to its vast selection
of courses one which would shed
positive light on undercultures?
That's not the way for the con
trolling status group to preserve
its advantage. It already has
enough ethnic and women's
courses to create a facade of con
cern.
Herodotus, the father of his
tory, and several other of his
counterparts from those classic
times had no problem with re
cording the great influence which
their Egyptian neighbors had on
the development of their society.
I guess they hadn't learned how
to gain and sustain the upper
hand through the control of
knowledge. The educational insti
tutions of the United States (and
Europe too, as I understand) have
that trick down to a science now.
It was silly of me — I don't
know what got into my head — to
think that my philosophy profes

sor would actually confess to his
class that the origins of Western
philosophical thought were to be
found in the Egyptian mystery
system. After a brief discussion in
his office, he did admit this. But
there was never any mention of it
in class. It was just a reminder
that people don't give up advan
tage.
So, it's no surprise that the
VTSS track didn't teach me that
the Moslem invasion brought
with it the universities, math,
science and literature that were
the impetus for the Renaissance.
Nor did it encourage me to
consider that every time the na
tion celebrates Columbus Day the
"Indian" is disrespected. We con
tinue to forget them as we love all
that has been gotten from them.
As women's suffrage in the
United States is discussed in
class I expect only to hear that it
came about relatively early in the
nation's history. I won't hold my
breath waiting to be reminded
that it came so late in the history
of humanity.
During the early periods of the
industrial revolution some of the
greatest innovations came from
Southern slaves. At the time, they
were not recognized in patent
grants because they were not
considered to be people. However,
let's not recognize them in our
history books today. We wouldn't
want any little child of the under
class to get wild notions that he
or she could achieve in a techno
logical field, too.
1 think we all need to realize
that no one willingly surrenders
their position of advantage. Not
even the liberal-thinking, open
minded faculty and student body
of Stanford should be called upon
to do that.
