# Leading a life without a thesis
## 
### 
It is too early for memoirs, yet I can't help
thinking about the story of my life — particu
larly since a friend has already provided the
most appropriate title: "Years and Still No
Thesis." Thanks.

I was visiting this friend last autumn while
he was writing a term paper and. of course. 1
managed to interrupt his work because I
needed an audience while I brooded over my
existence. He seemed preoccupied with his
paper and its lack of a title. 1 grappled with my
life's own lack of focus. 1 suggested a title for
his paper and he suggested a title for my life.
We laughed hard — probably more than his
comments required. 1 mean, it wasn't that
funny. Yet 1 detected that familiar surge of anx
iety that rode underneath the laughter. And to
this day 1 insist 1 did the right thing under the
circumstances: I cried. Well. I almost cried.
Actually — and less dramatically — as I look
back on my life, at the way it has slowly
assumed color and substance. I see a frantic
search for meaning in life, or at least an organ
izing principle.
I never really embraced the notion of pursu
ing a "career" in a way comparable to my peers.
To my mind, the idea of spending the bulk of
one's adult energies performing a professional
task was something best left to those more
positively directed than me.

Our culture has embraced the work ethic
with renewed conviction — a most annoying
development for me. Even the still voice of my
conscience has adopted this perspective and
constantly nags me: "You're 23 years old. Do
you know where you are going?"
The question posed by my conscience is, I
suspect, precipitated by unnamed external
pressures, even by the subtleties of life. This is
certainly not unique to me; it is. in fact, a
drama that is played out in the lives of most
college students.
Yes. It is a wearying cliche, but it remains
the quintessential college question. At a time
in your life when you're trying to figure out just
who you are it's very frightening to define your
self in any lasting professional terms.
It's a syndrome of sorts — one that is
facilitated by those unrelenting external pres
sures, like the minimalist conversation that
rings with embarrassing familiarity: "Poli Sci,
huh? What're you going to do when you
graduate? Go to law school?"
"Yeah."
"Oh."
Exit stage left.
And it is a syndrome that is at the very least
exacerbated by — what else? — reality. Few of
us can financially afford the luxury of postpon
ing for any extended length of time the big
decision: what we are going to be when we
grow up.
But it came to pass that during one
pleasurable excursion through the stacks of
our libraries I came across the writings of one
man who renewed my faith in our culture.
I found an essay that is actually the text of a
lecture he gave at the University of Tennessee
College of Law in Knoxville and is suitably

titled "Law as an Art."
The man who uttered these words was
Charles Black Jr., a recently deceased profes
sor at Yale Law School. Implicit throughout
this speech Is Prof. Black's conviction that we
have to remember to draw a distinction be
tween our professional identities and aspira
tions and the other facets of our life. Reading
his works literally changed my life; or, rather,
it changed the way I looked at my life.
As I read more by and about this man, 1 am
struck repeatedly by his feelings that it is we
who choose to restrict our lives to our alleged
careers, we who too often confuse our profes
sional aspirations with our quest for personal
identity.
Bob Eckhardt, a former congressman from
Texas and a friend of the professor's, tells this
story in Volume 95 of "The Yale Law Journal,"
a volume dedicated to the memory of Charles
Black.
Surprised to find his childhood friend in law
school. Eckhardt Inquired of the professor
how this career decision came about. Black
responded: "Oh. 1 don't care much about being
a lawyer. But it's the only respectable way to be
a miscellanist."
"What's a miscellanist?"
"An expert in miscellany."
By example, Prof. Black — a world-renowned
legal scholar who considered himself
"primarily a poet" — showed that It is possible
— certainly desirable and perhaps even neces
sary — to lead a rich, varied life outside of the
law. A "career" does not have to be a life
consuming fate.
When I grow up I wanna be Charles Black Jr.

"An expert in miscellany."

legal scholar who considered himself
"primarily a poet" — showed that It is possible
— certainly desirable and perhaps even neces
sary — to lead a rich, varied life outside of the
law. A "career" does not have to be a life
consuming fate.
