## Behind the scenes 
### 
What other careers would you
have liked to pursue?
An actress, but not Just an
actress, a famous one. And this
is not to say I won't do so In the
future.
Why do you do what you do?
I'm an Italian professor be
cause my mom and dad told me
to. I started an acting career,
but they sald,"No way!"
What is something that you
gives you great joy in life?
I would have to say water, in
any form — the sea, a tub with
hot water and foam, or a foun
tain.
When you graduated from col
lege, where did you see your
self in 10 years?
I wanted to be all over the
world, who knows doing what. I
just wanted to be away from
Napoll and to have a glamorous
life.
What is yourfavorite Junk food?
Ice cream — I could bathe in
it!
How would you compare
Americans to Italians?
American men make excellent
husbands. They take the trash
out. Italian men make wonder
ful lovers, but never marry
them. The perfect man would be
a combination of the two.
What period of your life so far
has been the most enjoyable
and why?
I loved the period when I was
30 years old. It was the 19605,
and we lived on improvisation,
not knowing what the next day
would bring.
What are your worst and best
qualities?
I can be impatient and over
bearing. However, I would say
I'm generous and giving of my
time.
Do you have any heroes or
heroines?
No, we live in a time with no
heroes.
What are the toughest and best
parts of your Job?
The toughest is the bureau
cracy, but that is a nuisance we
must live with. The best are the
students and the people that I
work with. They make it fun.
