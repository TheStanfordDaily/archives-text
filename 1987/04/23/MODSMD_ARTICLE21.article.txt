# The 						palace and park in S.F.
## 
### JAMES R DICKEY Editorial staff 
Nestled snugly between rows of
Victorian-style houses and near
Fisherman's Wharf and Fort
Mason is the Palace of Fine Arts, a
shelter in the storm of San Fran
cisco's hectic pace.
Constructed for the 1920
World's Fair, the Palace is reminis
cent of a grander age, of Greek
parthenons and Roman col
iseums. The columns stand over
90 feet tall, and their tops are
adorned with statues of men and
angels. The Romanesque columns
and dome provide a special atmos
phere to those walking or loung
ing around the small lake at the
Palace borders.
Though fairly difficult to find,
the Palace is well worth a visit. It's
hidden locale may actually be a
benefit, as there never seems to be
a problem with crowds or a lack of
privacy.
Behind the Palace's grand
structure and its delights for the
senses lies the Exploratorium
with its intellectual delights. The
Exploratorium is a huge arena full
of hands-on science and nature
experiments that are fun and in
teresting for science or curiosity
buffs of all ages.
Among the exhibits that
abound at the Exploratorium are
the house of mirrors, optical illu
sions and parabolic microphones
for experimentation by the guests.
Entrance to the Exploratorium
costs a small donation to the foun
dation that maintains it, but the
Palace and Its grounds are free
and open to the public at all
hours.
In addition to the exhibits and
natural pleasures provided by the
grounds and the Palace itself,
there is an auditorium which fre
quently hosts spectacular shows
such as the upcoming "Khadra" —
San Francisco's folk ballet.
Occasional lucky visitors to the
Palace are treated to the display of
the lake's majestic fountain,
which for unknown reasons is
operated only occasionally and at
random hours.
To find the Palace, simply go
west on Bay St. past the Wharf

and then follow the signs and be
prepared to have a great time.
Lauded as one of the world's
most outstanding horticultural
achievements and one of San
Francisco's chief attractions.
Golden Gate Park is a wonder not
to be missed.
Cultivated from barren sand
dunes a little more than 100 years
ago, the park is now 1,017 acres of
lush trees, lawns, gardens, shrubs
and lakes.
Largest of the lakes is Stow
Lake, surrounding Strawberry
Hill, the highest point in the park.
The hill is also adorned by Hunt
ington Falls — though not
Niagara, quite impressive for
downtown San Francisco.
For aquatically inclined visitors.
Stow Lake's boathouse rents pad
dleboats and rowboats to the
public.
If you prefer the arts, the park
boasts two fine museums. The De
Young Museum includes the spec
tacular Avery Brundage collection
of oriental art in addition to a sub
stantial number of American and
European pieces.
The California Academy of
Sciences faces the De Young
Museum from across the music
concourse. The Academy includes

the Morrison Planetarium and the
10.000-creature Steinhart
Aquarium.
The music concourse is an am
phitheater that hosts frequent
concerts by groups ranging from
high school bands to the San
Francisco Symphony.
Also of international fame is the
conservatory. Inside the glass
building are numerous species of
flowers and tropical plants. In
front of the conservatory are
seasonal flower displays, includ
ing one commemorating the 50th
anniversary of the Golden Gate
Bridge.
The Japanese Tea Garden is an
experience not to be missed while
at the park. Inside the garden is a
teahouse that serves Oriental teas
and fortune cookies. The garden
itself is an impressive display of
flowering trees and shrubs,
bridges, creeks and pagodas. It is
the only botanical section of the
park which charges admission.
The more athletic visitors can
rent horses, skates or bicycles or
enjoy the archery, fishing, jog
ging, baseball or tennis facilities
that abound at the park.
There are more than 10 lakes
and an unbelievable number of
pleasant places to picnic or take in
the afternoon sun.
