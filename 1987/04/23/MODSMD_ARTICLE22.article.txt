## Strange, disturbing 'Mister, Mister' on view 
### ANDREW BERKOWITZ Staff writer 
I told everybody back home that I went to see
"Mister, Mister," and boy were they jealous. Shucks,
they'll never know the truth: The "Mister. Mister"
currently playing at The Nitery is not the modern pop
group that features a balding lead singer and a few
top-20 tunes.
Forget the real world.
This version of "Mister. Mister" is a strange, con
fusing and disturbing play by the German au
thor/poet/playwright Gunter Grass that is both hor
rific and funny at the same time. Grass, known best
for his novel "The Tin Drum," is considered one of
the primary literary figures of the German genera
tion that grew up during the Nazi era. and in some
ways the play reflects the horror of the period
through which he lived.
The play centers around Bollin (James Patrick
Kennedy), a sweet, psychotic murderer who talks to
dolls and methodically records all the events occur
ring around him in a little brown pocket notebook
(not unlike certain Daily reporters). The guy seems
very harmless (he isn't) and very strange (he is).
However, the characters that Bollin meets along the
way are so strange that we can never decide whether
it is Bollin who is crazy or the others.
What transpires in the 80-minute play is difficult
to describe. It's also difficult to understand. In four
seperate scenes, Bollin meets characters who defy
his attempts to be logical and systematic in murder.
There is the flu-ridden girl Sophie (Heather
McClure) whose crossword puzzles and bedtime
stories are more engrossing than the strange man
who is hiding behind her bed. She is completely
oblivious to Bollin's motives; her reply to his request
that she remove her pajamas is simply. "Don't be un
reasonable. I had a hundred and two this morning."
In the play's funniest scene, Mimi (Jill Yonas), the
histrionic prima donna in the flowing hot-pink
gown, decides to have her quaking fiancee (James
Gunn) photograph a dramatic murder scene in her

bathtub, but pouts jealously when Bollin confesses
that he plans to kill a rival opera singer that same af
ternoon.
Tying the acts together are two nasty little
children. Sprat (Dana Klapper) and Slick (David
Kurtz), who appear periodically to ask Bollin for
"things" from his pockets. Bollin likes children more
than adults, but these kids are the most
manipulative characters in the play; they have
learned to hold a proprietary and sexual power over
weak adults.
There is far more to Grass' play than I have des
cribed here. The key is to try to understand Bollin,
who. played by Kennedy, seems more lovable and
pitiable than horrible. Each scene reveals part of his
character, but at the same time makes him even
more mysterious and confusing. "If the play leaves
you a little bit confused, then we've done our jobs,"
says Kennedy, a graduate student who returns to the
Stanford stage for the first time since 1981.
The set is actually five sets in one, each individu
ally lit during specific scenes. They make an interest
ing contrast together on the Nitery floor; a bedroom,
a park bench, a dressing room, a forest and an apart
ment. A large screen in the background flashes dif
ferent photographic negatives depending on which
part of the set is being used, and two shadow pup
pets represent the taunting children behind the
screen.
It's hard to predict what the audience reaction to
"Mister, Mister" will be. Some may find it funny,
others sad or depressing. There is no guarantee that
you won't walk out of The Nitery saying, "What in the
world was that?" The acting is quite good, and
Denise Chuk's direction is quick, lively and blackly
humorous. The success or failure of "Mister, Mister"
may depend more on the actual play than the perfor
mance itself â€” even the best actors can't fix a Hawed
play. If you don't like the play, chances are it will be
Gunter Grass' fault and not the actors.'
Tickets are available at Tresidder for "Mister,
Mister," which plays at The Nitery tonight through
Saturday at 8 p.m., and on Sunday at 2 p m.
