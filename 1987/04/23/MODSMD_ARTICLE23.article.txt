# U2 is born again with 'The Joshua Tree'
## 
### GREGORY A. MORRIS 
Well, here we go again. It hap
pened with Prince. It happened
with the Talking Heads. It hap
pened with Bruce Springsteen.
Now, for the next year or so, it ap
pears that we can count on being
inundated with I-told-you-so's
from people who discovered U2
when "no one had ever heard of
them." The Irish band has just
released its fifth studio album,
"The Joshua Tree," and in the
wake of the band's almost legen
dary performances during the Am
nesty International "Conspiracy of
Hope" Tour last year, the world is
poised to elevate yet another re
cording act to mega-star status.
Fortunately, the reason we are
now stuck with U2 is that "The
Joshua Tree" is one of the best,
most inspiring popular albums of
the decade.
Announcing itself with solemn
chords that remind one of a
Gregorian chant, "The Joshua
Tree" opens with three largely
hopeful tunes. Upon first listen,
one is inclined to think that U2
has somehow gone soft, perhaps
even . . . no, don't say it . . . sold
out. Each song offers the sympa
thetic encouragement of lead
singer Bono's (nee: Paul Hewson)
uplifting lyrics and only sparse
evidence of the trademark pealing
lead guitar of the Edge (Dave
Evans). One wonders if the band
has chosen to compromise its all
business, guitar-driven sound in
search of broader acceptance, and
one fears that Boqo has nowhere
to go with his particular brand of
lyrical inspiration.
In fact, further scrutiny reveals

a controlled subtlety never before
present in U2's work. On the
band's last full-length album,
"The Unforgettable Fire," produc
ers Brian Eno and Daniel Lanois
introduced a lush texture to the
U2 sound by exploiting the am
biguities of increased reverbera
tion. The production team's effort
was not wholly successful, in part
because some of the band's songs
came across as incomplete
thoughts and in part because
there was no variation in the pro
duction. One did not know if the
album brilliantly expressed uncer
tainty and human frailty or simply

achieved muddled confusion. On
"The Joshua Tree," Eno and
Lanois have managed to use their
production technique to expand
the range of emotions evoked by
U2's music. Indeed, they go so far
as to borrow the services of Steve
Lillywhite. U2's original producer,
whose contrasting preference for
crystal clarity enhances the new
album's sonic depth.
The first three cuts on "The Jos
hua Tree" reveal lyrical distinc
tion. too. Each song suggests an
underlying faith that allows us to
maintain an even keel and drags
us along when it must, but there

is more. In the three songs. U2
shifts from the unbridled confi
dence of "Where the Streets Have
No Name" to the wistful and poig
nant sincerity of "I Still Haven't
Found What I'm Looking For" to
the patient but angry determina
tion of "With or Without You." The
majesty of The Edge's guitar and
Larry Mullen's drumming, with
which the record begins, becomes
subdued by the persistence of
Adam Clayton's rhythmic bass
and Bono's vocals, ultimately
drenched in pain. And suddenly,
after a five-minute slow burn over
a nervously throbbing bass line,

"With or Without You" releases a
cascade of vocal emotion that
vaguely recalls the haunting har
monies of "October," the band's
second album.
But hope and idealism mean
little if they cannot confront real
world ugliness. On "The Joshua
Tree." as on "The Unforgettable
Fire" and the breakthrough album
"War," U2 opts for confrontation
with a vengeance. The balance of
the new album is devoted to the
real world â€” desolation, thorough
spiritual confusion and death.
"With or Without You" is fol
lowed by the urgency of "Bullet the

Blue Sky." another in the series of
U2 songs lamenting the dis
crepancy between today's United
States and the just. Utopian
America of the Western world's
naivest dreams. Appearing out of
nowhere as a symbol of harsh
reality, the song presses us toward
exhaustion. One has a sense of
being overwhelmed. Today, many
in Ireland are escaping this hope
lessness through heroin addic
tion. "Running to Stand Still" is a
barren acoustic ode to this recur
ring topic in U2's music. The
portrayal is both realistic and in
tensely sympathetic: "You got to
cry without weeping/Talk without
speaking/Scream without raising
you voice, you know/I took the
poison, from the poison
stream/Then I floated out of
here/Singing. . The song seems
to be about self-knowledge and
self-awareness as much as any
thing else.
The real world is most evident
on "Red Hill Mining Town," which
opens the second side. Emerging
from the ashes of "Running to
Stand Still," Bono's brooding
voice is that of a miner in the
midst of Britain's 1983 mining
strike. Rather than choosing to
starve themselves to death,
literally, the miners won nary a
concession before returning to
work after months without pay.
Pleading to retain some slight
sense of self-worth. Bono finally
explodes: "I'm hanging on/You're
all that's left to hold onto/I'm still
waiting."
Ever since U2 enjoyed a taste of
success with its first records, the
