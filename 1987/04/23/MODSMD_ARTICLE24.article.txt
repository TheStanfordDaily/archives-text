Julian Barnes
Staring At The Sun
New York: Knopf, 1987
If Julian Barnes hadn't written it, I probably
wouldn't have read "Staring at the Sun,"
whose dust jacket claims the book "chronicles
a century in the life of Jean Serjeant, from her
innocent 1920s girlhood to her flight into the
sun in the year 2021." For a novel of barely 200
pages, this seems rather an ambitious subject;
I wasn't quite sure if one page per six months
could actually "deepen (my) sense of wonder of
the tenacious hold that life exerts."
I was suprised, however, to see that Barnes
had written a novel so soon after his 1986 best
seller. "Flaubert's Parrot." and I hoped that by
reading his new book I could get some idea of
why everyone had liked his last one so much.
An inter-genre book-length love affair with
Flaubert and a mysterious parrot. "Flaubert's
Parrot" got so many kudos from critics that I
never really recovered from disliking it.
I found "Staring At The Sun" far more en
gaging than "Flaubert's Parrot." It isn't bril
liant. but it's dazzling enough in parts to make
me forgive its flaws. I'm tempted to think that
this is a Flaubert-lover's attempt at creating a
cosmic Emma Bovary. Like Flaubert. Barnes
gets uncannily close to Emma at times and
hysterically distant at other times.
The trouble I have with both "Flaubert's Par
rot" and "Staring At The Sun" is that Barnes
sets up structures that undermine what he
does best. Barnes is good when chatting about
things that are tangible and within his experi
ence. but the devices he chooses seem to draw
him into the realm of the academic and pre

cious. "Flaubert's Parrot" is at times nothing
more than witty language — as if Barnes had
committed himself to writing something inno
vative at whatever cost. In "Staring At The
Sun." Barnes commits himself to beginning
his novel in the past and ending it in the fu
ture. and often the novel is overwhelmed by
what Barnes has predetermined it should en
compass.
The book opens with an aerial manuever by
Sergeant-Pilot Thomas Prossner that seems ir
relevant until Prossner reappears about one
third of the way into the novel. The transition
between the two-page incident and the intro
duction of Jean is disconcerting, as is much of
the pacing in this book; instead of six months
per page Barnes fluctuates between slow
motion and overdrive, with varying success.
For example. Barnes' discussion of Jean's early
childhood moves much too slowly, perhaps
even for Barnes. Some of his descriptions of
Jean's pre-pubescent discoveries are tinged
with the sort of impatience too-busy fathers
have for silly-girl children.
As the book opens, four-year-old Jean is
given a present of supposed hyacinths by her
favorite uncle. Leslie. After waiting for months
for the hyacinths to bloom, she discovers that
they're really golf tees. She has been the victim
of one of Leslie's practical jokes. When Barnes
remarks. "Strangely, the Incident didn't make
her lose faith in Uncle Leslie. Instead, she lost
her faith in hyacinths." we don't know if he's
charmed by her actions or irritated by them.
The distance between Barnes and Jean nar
rows progressively as Jean matures and
becomes capable of thinking "adult" thoughts.
Jean In her 20s and 30s is far more credible
than Jean in her teens: A shy and awkward girl

before and after her marriage, she is convinc
ingly baffled by her sexual impotence. Barnes
manages to describe her bland middle years in
a way that is anything but bland.
But it's after Jean leaves her deadbeat
policeman husband that the book really begins
to take off. Barnes moves quickly through her
single parenthood, bringing her son Gregory
to maturity in eight clean pages that make one
wish Jean had grown up a bit faster.
When Gregory's old enough to be left alone,
Jean begins to travel around the world. There's
a wonderful rapport, it seems, between the 40-
year-old Barnes and the 40-year-old Jean.
Timing is no longer an issue as Jean hops
around visiting the Seven Wonders of the
World. One wishes she could be forever 40 and
forever traveling.
Jean, however, ages sporadically and
determinedly. Or rather, Barnes gives her the
concerns of the aging — papery skin, clumsy
hands, reticence — but not the mind of an
older woman. Except for occasional flights of
memory and sagacity, we're still dealing with
the Jean who trades the Coliseum for the
Leaning Tower of Pisa so that she can fit the
Seven Wonders into her budget.
Instead of changing Jean, Barnes in the last
section of the book completely changes the
world around her. Her world and that of her
son is dominated by the General Purposes
Computer, a 1984/ Brave New World/2001-
esque information device. At this point things
get a bit awkward; just as in the beginning I
was unsure of Barnes' attitude toward Jean, at
this point I can't tell what Barnes thinks of the
General Purposes Computer, what he wants us
