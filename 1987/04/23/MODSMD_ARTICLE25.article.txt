# The 						Return of KZSU PICKS
## 
### 
Well, we're back! Miss us? No,
probably not.
Y'know how you always read
this column and complain that
you could write mindless tripe like
we do? Well, bigshot, here's your
chance to prove it.
Yep, that's right. Just like Ann
Landers leaving the Sun-Times,
all us Zoo Pickers for this year are
movin' on. Unlike Ann, tho,' we
don't have a high-paying job
waiting for us at the rival paper
(Guess that'd be The Daily Cal).
But enough of our troubles! You
can be the KZSU Picks columnist
of the future! Yeah!
See. this here's a great job.
You're a columnist for The Daily,
appear semi-weekly (maybe more),
and you don't get some cheesy pic
of yourself in the paper. You're
anonymous! You can insult with
impunity! You can be lofty! You
can pretend you know what you're
talking about! You can be the only
person to laugh at your column!
You can get PAID!!!!!
Well, if this sounds appealing to
you, all you hafta do is to send a
sample column reviewing some
record (preferably recent and one
that we've heard of) to: KZSU
Picks, c/o Entertainment Editor,
The Stanford Daily, Storke Publi
cation Bldg., Stanford, CA,
94305. Entries will be judged on
level of difficulty, originality,
taste, humor and (oh, yeah)
whether we agree with what you
wrote. Not really. But anyways,
the deadline to enter is probably
May 15. So get cracking!
Reviews this week are in
rock'n'rollers who sued for the
right to use their own name.
Oingo Boingo
Boi-ngo
Thomas Dolby, Thomas Dolby,
Thomas Dolby, Thomas
This is the third Boingo-type
record this column has seen. In
each of the two preceding reviews
we have said that the album under
consideration was finally the one
that would propel the band to
fame and fortune. In each, we
were terribly, terribly wrong. Hey,
it's time to face facts: this band

will probably never be popular.
This is not to say that they haven't
tried. They have. How many teen
sex comedies soundtracks could
one band do. anyway? This is not
to say that no one likes them.
Some people do. They always sell
out concerts in L.A. and even in
places as far away as Santa Bar
bara. But for some reason they
haven't caught on in a big way.
Who knows why? Maybe their
time will come. Maybe some rich
publishing syndicate will see this
column and whisk us off to a
lucrative career in big-time record
reviewing. Maybe not.

Whoops, almost ended there
without reviewing the record!
Guess it wouldn't be the first time,
though. Anyways, this here is a
pretty not-bad record album. It's a
lot better than their last, "Dead
Man's Party," which we, under the
mistaken impression it would
grow on us, gave a 3 1/2.. It didn't
grow. So we weren't looking for
ward a whole lot to this record.
Then we got the record. Ugly,
u gly. u gly cover. Take a look for
yourself! There's all fifteen
hundred jillion of the bandspeople
doin' their darndest to look really

cool and mystical. Really ugly
looking. Then there's that title.
How the heck do you pronounce
that? It looks vaguely Vietnamese
with that hyphen."Boin-go." I
could see. OK. we're picking, but
that cover sucks.
Well, once inside the jacket, you
gotta prepare yourself. This band
has changed. It kinda seems like
they're going for becoming a
(shock, horror) more typical new
wave/rock band. Before, lead
singer Danny Elfman would
scream (albeit tunefully) and the
other 800 guys in the barid would
rush to supply chanted back-up

vocals, blaring horns and slap
happy drumming. Sure, it was
cleverly calculated, but it sounded
terrific and inspired. And you
could dance to it. Nowadays,
melodies are important. Vocals
are controlled. Instruments are
layers to create a more sophisti
cated sound. Sounds like the guys
have been listening to the radio
too much.
But, once you get out of shock,
you start to sort of like the new
stuff. It's still the same band o'
crazies in there somewhere.
There's still cool horns and weird

lyrics and strange xylophonic ef
fects. There's still about 70 guys
in the band. OK. it isn't "Only a
Lad" (their first record). At least
there isn't as much slow, boring
stuff as on their erstwhile release
(though there is enough so that
you get to grind your teeth a little).
And some of the stuff really does
cook. Or at least simmer. It's a
step up. There are a couple of
really good songs. Really.
No, no, no, all that sounds so
negative. Fact is, we liked this al
bum a lot. We're wiser now, so it
only gets a 3 1/2. See, if we gave it
a 4 or more, then we'd have to add
a 6 to our scale, and then we'd end
up bagging the whole scale deal
like Rolling Stone had to. And
that'd be a pity, huh?
The Smiths
Louder Than Bombs
Jefferson Starship, Jefferson
Starship, Jefferson Starship, Jef
ferson Starship
Reviewing this album is like
reviewing a 10-year-old kid's
teeth. The kid's got 24 teeth, but 8
are old ones she's still waiting to
spit out that are beginning to yel
low. The other 16 are new, but a
couple don't look so good. In gen
eral, the kid's got great teeth,
though, and probably won't need
braces. Dad's happy, and shows
off her teeth any time anybody
comes over, and some people can
only muse that her wisdom teeth
will come in in a few years and
screw the whole thing up.
The Smiths' album has 24
songs on it — it's a double album
— and eight are, in fact, old ones. I
don't know why they do that. It's
really a drag, so I recommend
taping the album for yourself
without all those old songs if
you've already got them on other
albums. The other 16 are brand
new and they are in keeping with
their last album "The Queen is
Dead." a fun, rocking, danceable
album with a dose of dry, morbid
humor that makes you feel that
you don't have to take them ultra
seriously. The lineup is the same,
and Morrisey's voice is as annoy
ingly self-possessed, and as
sinewy and moody as ever. Some

songs on here are great fun —
raw, hippety-hoppity and melodic
— like "London," "Shakespeare's
Sister" and "Panic," with its won
derful refrain, "Hang the DJ/Hang
the DJ/Hang the DJ/Because the
songs he plays/Don't say anything
to me about my life."
Others recall the beat and
spiraling guitar work of the first
two albums, like the '50s-ish
"Ask" and "Is it Really So
Strange?" Several songs are
quieter, haunting tunes, with
Morrisey's typical, almost point
less musings which you really
don't care about, except they al
most become a parody in "Asleep,"
"Half a Person" and "Stretch Out
and Wait," where he sings: "Will
the world end in daytime?/I really
don't know/And is there any point
to ever having children?/I really
don't know." The voice is still
there, the guitar is still there, and
they throw in a couple of
surprises, a couple of duds and a
bunch of older songs, but some
how, you end up listening to this
album over and over. It's just like
that 10-year-old kid's teeth. Get it
now?
The The
Infected
Johnny Rotten, Johnny Rotten,
Johnny Rotten, Johnny Rotten,
Johnny
Matt Johnson may be the most
miserable figure in pop music.
The list of the agonized in progres
sive music is long — some would
say entirely too long. Angst ranges
from the general social disillusion
ment shown by bands such as the
Dead Kennedys and New Model
Army to a dissatisfaction with
relationships such as that shown
on the new Husker Du album to,
finally, that most pathetic sort of
mental trauma, dissatisfaction
with oneself and a loss of personal
identity. Until recently, it was
clear that the only two competi
tors in the personal nihilist
sweepstakes were Morrisey (of The
Smiths) and Matt Johnson. Oh
sure, there have been other chal
lengers: Robert Smith of The Cure

before he had to go and get happy
— the same thing happened to
New Order and innumerable other
Brit gloom rockers. But no one
else really stated his case as piti
fully or as eloquently. Well, now
Matt Johnson is the undisputed
king. A quick listen to the new
Smiths album finds Morrisey
committing the unpardonable sin
of singing "la. la. la. la, la" and et
cetera. He actually sounds happy.
No one could mistake "Infected"
for happy pop fluff. Yes, there are
saxophones and chirpy back
ground vocals. Yes. the title track
has a nice dance beat, and the rest
of the tunes have the finely crafted
pop sound of careful layering,
something which results when
the artist is accustomed to com
plete control over the recording
process. (Johnson writes and
produces his own work, and plays
many of the instruments on the
record.) The result is a pop tune
with a touch of uneasiness at its
heart. The listener's attention is
immediately drawn to the synco
pated rhythm tracks which drive
each song along, but Johnson has
added a generous portion of pop

hooks, breaks and an effective
blend of brass, synth and guitar
sounds which keep the record
from being yet another drum
machine fiasco.
While the musical style of The
The is interesting, the lyrics are
nothing short of amazing. War.
sex, death, urban decay, cap
italism. consumer society, suicide
— all of these are touched upon.
This in itself is not unusual. Every
silly English pop guitar band does
this. The The is special because
its songs show with brutal clarity
how Matt Johnson (the lyrics are
so vivid they must be derived from
personal experience) internalizes
all these problems.
How does he? With difficulty. By
the end of the album he's so
worked up that he decides to take
a drive to clear his mind: "I got one
hand on the radio, one hand on
the wheel/I got my right foot on
the floorboards — I'm preparing to
kill or be killed." Lines such as
these fill the album. Yes, listening
to this can be depressing, but it
can also instill a sense of awe. The
musical and lyrical eloquence with
which Johnson relates his experi
ence is amazing and makes the
record a remarkable achievement.

Army to a dissatisfaction with
relationships such as that shown
on the new Husker Du album to,
finally, that most pathetic sort of
mental trauma, dissatisfaction
with oneself and a loss of personal
identity. Until recently, it was
clear that the only two competi
tors in the personal nihilist
sweepstakes were Morrisey (of The
Smiths) and Matt Johnson. Oh
sure, there have been other chal
lengers: Robert Smith of The Cure

before he had to go and get happy
— the same thing happened to
New Order and innumerable other
Brit gloom rockers. But no one
else really stated his case as piti
fully or as eloquently. Well, now
Matt Johnson is the undisputed
king. A quick listen to the new
Smiths album finds Morrisey
committing the unpardonable sin
of singing "la. la. la. la, la" and et
cetera. He actually sounds happy.
No one could mistake "Infected"
for happy pop fluff. Yes, there are
saxophones and chirpy back
ground vocals. Yes. the title track
has a nice dance beat, and the rest
of the tunes have the finely crafted
pop sound of careful layering,
something which results when
the artist is accustomed to com
plete control over the recording
process. (Johnson writes and
produces his own work, and plays
many of the instruments on the
record.) The result is a pop tune
with a touch of uneasiness at its
heart. The listener's attention is
immediately drawn to the synco
pated rhythm tracks which drive
each song along, but Johnson has
added a generous portion of pop

hooks, breaks and an effective
blend of brass, synth and guitar
sounds which keep the record
from being yet another drum
machine fiasco.
While the musical style of The
The is interesting, the lyrics are
nothing short of amazing. War.
sex, death, urban decay, cap
italism. consumer society, suicide
— all of these are touched upon.
This in itself is not unusual. Every
silly English pop guitar band does
this. The The is special because
its songs show with brutal clarity
how Matt Johnson (the lyrics are
so vivid they must be derived from
personal experience) internalizes
all these problems.
How does he? With difficulty. By
the end of the album he's so
worked up that he decides to take
a drive to clear his mind: "I got one
hand on the radio, one hand on
the wheel/I got my right foot on
the floorboards — I'm preparing to
kill or be killed." Lines such as
these fill the album. Yes, listening
to this can be depressing, but it
can also instill a sense of awe. The
musical and lyrical eloquence with
which Johnson relates his experi
ence is amazing and makes the
record a remarkable achievement.

Well, we're back! Miss us? No,
probably not.
Y'know how you always read
this column and complain that
you could write mindless tripe like
we do? Well, bigshot, here's your
chance to prove it.
Yep, that's right. Just like Ann
Landers leaving the Sun-Times,
all us Zoo Pickers for this year are
movin' on. Unlike Ann, tho,' we
don't have a high-paying job
waiting for us at the rival paper
(Guess that'd be The Daily Cal).
But enough of our troubles! You
can be the KZSU Picks columnist
of the future! Yeah!
See. this here's a great job.
You're a columnist for The Daily,
appear semi-weekly (maybe more),
and you don't get some cheesy pic
of yourself in the paper. You're
anonymous! You can insult with
impunity! You can be lofty! You
can pretend you know what you're
talking about! You can be the only
person to laugh at your column!
You can get PAID!!!!!
Well, if this sounds appealing to
you, all you hafta do is to send a
sample column reviewing some
record (preferably recent and one
that we've heard of) to: KZSU
Picks, c/o Entertainment Editor,
The Stanford Daily, Storke Publi
cation Bldg., Stanford, CA,
94305. Entries will be judged on
level of difficulty, originality,
taste, humor and (oh, yeah)
whether we agree with what you
wrote. Not really. But anyways,
the deadline to enter is probably
May 15. So get cracking!
Reviews this week are in
rock'n'rollers who sued for the

Oingo Boingo
Boi-ngo
Thomas Dolby, Thomas Dolby,
Thomas Dolby, Thomas
This is the third Boingo-type
record this column has seen. In
each of the two preceding reviews
we have said that the album under
consideration was finally the one
that would propel the band to
fame and fortune. In each, we
were terribly, terribly wrong. Hey,
it's time to face facts: this band

will probably never be popular.
This is not to say that they haven't
tried. They have. How many teen
sex comedies soundtracks could
one band do. anyway? This is not
to say that no one likes them.
Some people do. They always sell
out concerts in L.A. and even in
places as far away as Santa Bar
bara. But for some reason they
haven't caught on in a big way.
Who knows why? Maybe their
time will come. Maybe some rich
publishing syndicate will see this
column and whisk us off to a
lucrative career in big-time record
reviewing. Maybe not.

Whoops, almost ended there
without reviewing the record!
Guess it wouldn't be the first time,
though. Anyways, this here is a
pretty not-bad record album. It's a
lot better than their last, "Dead
Man's Party," which we, under the
mistaken impression it would
grow on us, gave a 3 1/2.. It didn't
grow. So we weren't looking for
ward a whole lot to this record.
Then we got the record. Ugly,
u gly. u gly cover. Take a look for
yourself! There's all fifteen
hundred jillion of the bandspeople
doin' their darndest to look really

cool and mystical. Really ugly
looking. Then there's that title.
How the heck do you pronounce
that? It looks vaguely Vietnamese
with that hyphen."Boin-go." I
could see. OK. we're picking, but
that cover sucks.
Well, once inside the jacket, you
gotta prepare yourself. This band
has changed. It kinda seems like
they're going for becoming a
(shock, horror) more typical new
wave/rock band. Before, lead
singer Danny Elfman would
scream (albeit tunefully) and the
other 800 guys in the barid would
rush to supply chanted back-up

vocals, blaring horns and slap
happy drumming. Sure, it was
cleverly calculated, but it sounded
terrific and inspired. And you
could dance to it. Nowadays,
melodies are important. Vocals
are controlled. Instruments are
layers to create a more sophisti
cated sound. Sounds like the guys
have been listening to the radio
too much.
But, once you get out of shock,
you start to sort of like the new
stuff. It's still the same band o'
crazies in there somewhere.
There's still cool horns and weird

lyrics and strange xylophonic ef
fects. There's still about 70 guys
in the band. OK. it isn't "Only a
Lad" (their first record). At least
there isn't as much slow, boring
stuff as on their erstwhile release
(though there is enough so that
you get to grind your teeth a little).
And some of the stuff really does
cook. Or at least simmer. It's a
step up. There are a couple of
really good songs. Really.
No, no, no, all that sounds so
negative. Fact is, we liked this al
bum a lot. We're wiser now, so it
only gets a 3 1/2. See, if we gave it
a 4 or more, then we'd have to add
a 6 to our scale, and then we'd end
up bagging the whole scale deal
like Rolling Stone had to. And
that'd be a pity, huh?
The Smiths
Louder Than Bombs
Jefferson Starship, Jefferson
Starship, Jefferson Starship, Jef
ferson Starship
Reviewing this album is like
reviewing a 10-year-old kid's
teeth. The kid's got 24 teeth, but 8
are old ones she's still waiting to
spit out that are beginning to yel
low. The other 16 are new, but a
couple don't look so good. In gen
eral, the kid's got great teeth,
though, and probably won't need
braces. Dad's happy, and shows
off her teeth any time anybody
comes over, and some people can
only muse that her wisdom teeth
will come in in a few years and
screw the whole thing up.
The Smiths' album has 24
songs on it — it's a double album
— and eight are, in fact, old ones. I
don't know why they do that. It's
really a drag, so I recommend
taping the album for yourself
without all those old songs if
you've already got them on other
albums. The other 16 are brand
new and they are in keeping with
their last album "The Queen is
Dead." a fun, rocking, danceable
album with a dose of dry, morbid
humor that makes you feel that
you don't have to take them ultra
seriously. The lineup is the same,
and Morrisey's voice is as annoy
ingly self-possessed, and as
sinewy and moody as ever. Some

songs on here are great fun —
raw, hippety-hoppity and melodic
— like "London," "Shakespeare's
Sister" and "Panic," with its won
derful refrain, "Hang the DJ/Hang
the DJ/Hang the DJ/Because the
songs he plays/Don't say anything
to me about my life."
Others recall the beat and
spiraling guitar work of the first
two albums, like the '50s-ish
"Ask" and "Is it Really So
Strange?" Several songs are
quieter, haunting tunes, with
Morrisey's typical, almost point
less musings which you really
don't care about, except they al
most become a parody in "Asleep,"
"Half a Person" and "Stretch Out
and Wait," where he sings: "Will
the world end in daytime?/I really
don't know/And is there any point
to ever having children?/I really
don't know." The voice is still
there, the guitar is still there, and
they throw in a couple of
surprises, a couple of duds and a
bunch of older songs, but some
how, you end up listening to this
album over and over. It's just like
that 10-year-old kid's teeth. Get it
now?

Matt Johnson may be the most

ment shown by bands such as the

on the new Husker Du album to,
finally, that most pathetic sort of

low. The other 16 are new, but a
couple don't look so good. In gen
eral, the kid's got great teeth,
though, and probably won't need
braces. Dad's happy, and shows
off her teeth any time anybody
comes over, and some people can
only muse that her wisdom teeth
will come in in a few years and
screw the whole thing up.
The Smiths' album has 24
songs on it — it's a double album
— and eight are, in fact, old ones. I
don't know why they do that. It's
really a drag, so I recommend
taping the album for yourself
without all those old songs if
you've already got them on other
albums. The other 16 are brand
new and they are in keeping with
their last album "The Queen is
Dead." a fun, rocking, danceable
album with a dose of dry, morbid
humor that makes you feel that
you don't have to take them ultra
seriously. The lineup is the same,
and Morrisey's voice is as annoy
ingly self-possessed, and as
sinewy and moody as ever. Some

songs on here are great fun —
raw, hippety-hoppity and melodic
— like "London," "Shakespeare's
Sister" and "Panic," with its won
derful refrain, "Hang the DJ/Hang
the DJ/Hang the DJ/Because the
songs he plays/Don't say anything
to me about my life."
Others recall the beat and
spiraling guitar work of the first
two albums, like the '50s-ish
"Ask" and "Is it Really So
Strange?" Several songs are
quieter, haunting tunes, with
Morrisey's typical, almost point
less musings which you really
don't care about, except they al
most become a parody in "Asleep,"
"Half a Person" and "Stretch Out
and Wait," where he sings: "Will
the world end in daytime?/I really
don't know/And is there any point
to ever having children?/I really
don't know." The voice is still
there, the guitar is still there, and
they throw in a couple of
surprises, a couple of duds and a
bunch of older songs, but some
how, you end up listening to this
album over and over. It's just like
that 10-year-old kid's teeth. Get it
now?

Matt Johnson may be the most
miserable figure in pop music.
The list of the agonized in progres
sive music is long — some would
say entirely too long. Angst ranges
from the general social disillusion
ment shown by bands such as the
Dead Kennedys and New Model
Army to a dissatisfaction with
relationships such as that shown
on the new Husker Du album to,
finally, that most pathetic sort of
mental trauma, dissatisfaction
with oneself and a loss of personal
identity. Until recently, it was
clear that the only two competi
tors in the personal nihilist
sweepstakes were Morrisey (of The
Smiths) and Matt Johnson. Oh
sure, there have been other chal
lengers: Robert Smith of The Cure

before he had to go and get happy
— the same thing happened to
New Order and innumerable other
Brit gloom rockers. But no one
else really stated his case as piti
fully or as eloquently. Well, now
Matt Johnson is the undisputed
king. A quick listen to the new
Smiths album finds Morrisey
committing the unpardonable sin
of singing "la. la. la. la, la" and et
cetera. He actually sounds happy.
No one could mistake "Infected"
for happy pop fluff. Yes, there are
saxophones and chirpy back
ground vocals. Yes. the title track
has a nice dance beat, and the rest
of the tunes have the finely crafted
pop sound of careful layering,
something which results when
the artist is accustomed to com
plete control over the recording
process. (Johnson writes and
produces his own work, and plays
many of the instruments on the
record.) The result is a pop tune
with a touch of uneasiness at its
heart. The listener's attention is
immediately drawn to the synco
pated rhythm tracks which drive
each song along, but Johnson has
added a generous portion of pop

hooks, breaks and an effective
blend of brass, synth and guitar
sounds which keep the record
from being yet another drum
machine fiasco.
While the musical style of The
The is interesting, the lyrics are
nothing short of amazing. War.
sex, death, urban decay, cap
italism. consumer society, suicide
— all of these are touched upon.
This in itself is not unusual. Every
silly English pop guitar band does
this. The The is special because
its songs show with brutal clarity
how Matt Johnson (the lyrics are
so vivid they must be derived from
personal experience) internalizes
all these problems.
How does he? With difficulty. By
the end of the album he's so
worked up that he decides to take
a drive to clear his mind: "I got one
hand on the radio, one hand on
the wheel/I got my right foot on
the floorboards — I'm preparing to
kill or be killed." Lines such as
these fill the album. Yes, listening
to this can be depressing, but it
can also instill a sense of awe. The
musical and lyrical eloquence with
which Johnson relates his experi
ence is amazing and makes the
record a remarkable achievement.

Well, we're back! Miss us? No,
probably not.
Y'know how you always read
this column and complain that
you could write mindless tripe like
we do? Well, bigshot, here's your
chance to prove it.
Yep, that's right. Just like Ann
Landers leaving the Sun-Times,
all us Zoo Pickers for this year are
movin' on. Unlike Ann, tho,' we
don't have a high-paying job
waiting for us at the rival paper
(Guess that'd be The Daily Cal).
But enough of our troubles! You
can be the KZSU Picks columnist
of the future! Yeah!
See. this here's a great job.
You're a columnist for The Daily,
appear semi-weekly (maybe more),
and you don't get some cheesy pic
of yourself in the paper. You're
anonymous! You can insult with
impunity! You can be lofty! You
can pretend you know what you're
talking about! You can be the only
person to laugh at your column!
You can get PAID!!!!!
Well, if this sounds appealing to
you, all you hafta do is to send a
sample column reviewing some
record (preferably recent and one
that we've heard of) to: KZSU
Picks, c/o Entertainment Editor,
The Stanford Daily, Storke Publi
cation Bldg., Stanford, CA,
94305. Entries will be judged on
level of difficulty, originality,
taste, humor and (oh, yeah)
whether we agree with what you
wrote. Not really. But anyways,
the deadline to enter is probably
May 15. So get cracking!
Reviews this week are in
rock'n'rollers who sued for the
right to use their own name.

This is the third Boingo-type
record this column has seen. In
each of the two preceding reviews
we have said that the album under
consideration was finally the one
that would propel the band to
fame and fortune. In each, we
were terribly, terribly wrong. Hey,
it's time to face facts: this band

will probably never be popular.
This is not to say that they haven't
tried. They have. How many teen
sex comedies soundtracks could
one band do. anyway? This is not
to say that no one likes them.
Some people do. They always sell
out concerts in L.A. and even in
places as far away as Santa Bar
bara. But for some reason they
haven't caught on in a big way.
Who knows why? Maybe their
time will come. Maybe some rich
publishing syndicate will see this
column and whisk us off to a
lucrative career in big-time record
reviewing. Maybe not.

Whoops, almost ended there
without reviewing the record!
Guess it wouldn't be the first time,
though. Anyways, this here is a
pretty not-bad record album. It's a
lot better than their last, "Dead
Man's Party," which we, under the
mistaken impression it would
grow on us, gave a 3 1/2.. It didn't
grow. So we weren't looking for
ward a whole lot to this record.
Then we got the record. Ugly,
u gly. u gly cover. Take a look for
yourself! There's all fifteen
hundred jillion of the bandspeople
doin' their darndest to look really

cool and mystical. Really ugly
looking. Then there's that title.
How the heck do you pronounce
that? It looks vaguely Vietnamese
with that hyphen."Boin-go." I
could see. OK. we're picking, but
that cover sucks.
Well, once inside the jacket, you
gotta prepare yourself. This band
has changed. It kinda seems like
they're going for becoming a
(shock, horror) more typical new
wave/rock band. Before, lead
singer Danny Elfman would
scream (albeit tunefully) and the
other 800 guys in the barid would
rush to supply chanted back-up

vocals, blaring horns and slap
happy drumming. Sure, it was
cleverly calculated, but it sounded
terrific and inspired. And you
could dance to it. Nowadays,
melodies are important. Vocals
are controlled. Instruments are
layers to create a more sophisti
cated sound. Sounds like the guys
have been listening to the radio
too much.
But, once you get out of shock,
you start to sort of like the new
stuff. It's still the same band o'
crazies in there somewhere.
There's still cool horns and weird

lyrics and strange xylophonic ef
fects. There's still about 70 guys
in the band. OK. it isn't "Only a
Lad" (their first record). At least
there isn't as much slow, boring
stuff as on their erstwhile release
(though there is enough so that
you get to grind your teeth a little).
And some of the stuff really does
cook. Or at least simmer. It's a
step up. There are a couple of
really good songs. Really.
No, no, no, all that sounds so
negative. Fact is, we liked this al
bum a lot. We're wiser now, so it
only gets a 3 1/2. See, if we gave it
a 4 or more, then we'd have to add
a 6 to our scale, and then we'd end
up bagging the whole scale deal
like Rolling Stone had to. And
that'd be a pity, huh?
