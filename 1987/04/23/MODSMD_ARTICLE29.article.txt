## Netters in Ojai for Pac-10 Individuals Fendick sitting out first women's Pac-10s; sidelined pair return 
### KEN STEVENS Senior staff writer 
Patty Fendick may well win back-to-back NCAA singles
titles, but she will not become the first-ever Pacific 10 Con
ference women's singles champion.
Fendick. 28-0 this season and the defending champion
at Ojai, will not take part in the 32-player singles draw,
which begins this morning. She will, however, compete in
the doubles beginning tomorrow.
"It was a conscious decision just to hold her out," Stan
ford Coach Frank Brennan said. "She doesn't really need
the rest, but there's really nothing to be gained. It's kind of
tough to defend herself all of the time."
Fendick is the most prominent of the absentees in the
singles draw this weekend. Of the six Pac-10 schools, only
California will field its top six players. Other notable players
who will not compete include Stephanie Harges (USC's No.
2 player), Jennifer Fuchs (No. 3 for UCLA) and Betsy Some
rville (N0.3 for Arizona).
Nevertheless, the tournament should be very competi
tive, according to Brennan. In the past, any school could
send players to Ojai. But with the formation of the women's
Pac-10 this year, the main draw of the tournament has
become the conference championships, just as it had
already been for the men's Pac-10.
"It's kind of nice." Brennan said. "It's much more of an
honor to say, 'Well, I'm the Pac-10 singles champion.' The
matches are more meaningful. There won't be any easy
matches."
Without Fendick competing, senior Stephanie Savides is
the Cardinal's top player in the singles. She will begin play
at 9 a.m. with a first-round match against Harriet Knols. a
backup for Arizona. If she can defeat Knols, Savides will
face the winner of the match between Cal's Alissa Finerman
and Arizona State's Laura Glitz this afternoon.
Stanford has three players in first-round matches at
10:30 a.m. Freshman Lisa Green is up against Jackie
Ranger, Arizona's No. 5 player. Sophomore Cindy
Buchsbaum is matched against Cal's No. 3 player, Sharon
Fletcher, and freshman Valerie Wilson faces some stiff com
petition In ASlJ's Carol Coparanis.
Junior Kay Tittle, the Cardinal's remaining entrant,
opens play at noon against Kathy McGarrigle, a reserve for
USC. Tittle should advance to play the winner of the match
between Chris Seiffert of Arizona and Catherine O'Meara of
UCLA.
Stanford will also field senior Leigh Anne Eldredge and
sophomore Eleni Rossides in the open singles, which in
cludes schools from all parts of California. "Hopefully Eleni
and Leigh Anne will get a lot of matches and get that match
toughness we'd like them to get," Brennan said.
Brennan explained that with Eldredge and Rossides
coming off of injuries that kept them out of action for long
periods of time, he never considered putting either in the
Pac-10 draw. "I want to get them a lot of matches," he said.
"This (Pac-10) draw is pretty tough. There's a chance they
might draw someone pretty good in the first round and
lose. That would be counterproductive."
For Rossides. the Ojai tournament will represent her first
competitive singles since suffering stress-fracture injuries
in both legs over a year ago.
"Physically, she seems pretty good," Brennan said. "(But)
I realized with Leigh Anne it's not just a matter of hitting
the forehand and backhand. You have to get that match
toughness."
The Pac-10 doubles begin tomorrow morning. Fendick
and Savides, who certainly will be a favorite to capture the
title, open against an unheralded tandem from UCLA.
Green and Tittle will face a more formidable first-round
opponent in ASU's No. 1 team of Coparanis and Glitz.
Buchsbaum and Wilson are matched against USC's top
team, Ginny Purdy and Lupita Novelo.
Stanford junior Cari Hagey, who strained her left knee
three weeks ago. is still not ready to play. Brennan is confi
dent that she will return for next weeks dual matches
against U.S. International and Cal.
