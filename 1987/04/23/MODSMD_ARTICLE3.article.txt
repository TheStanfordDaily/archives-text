Organizers have finalized a hectic
schedule of speeches, performances and
a historic gathering of North American
foreign ministers as part of next
month's Cornerstone Weekend, the first
of two gala events celebrating the Stan
ford Centennial.
University officials have taken the un
usual step of canceling all afternoon
classes on Thursday. May 14. so that
students, faculty and staff can partici
pate in a ceremony commemorating the
laying of the University cornerstone in
Building 60 a century ago.
A crowd of over 5,000 is expected to
gather in the Inner Quad to hear
speeches by various Stanford dig
nitaries, including an address by U.S.
Secretary of State George Shultz, as well
as speeches from his counterparts from

Mexico and Canada, Canadian External
Affairs Secretary Joseph Clark and
Mexican Foreign Relations Secretary
Bernardo Sepulveda Amor.
The three foreign ministers will hold
private discussions on campus earlier in
the day, the first such joint meeting of
these government officials in history.
Shultz is currently on leave as Parker
Professor of International Economics at
the Graduate School of Business.
The Thursday festivities will begin
with an academic procession at 2 p.m.
In addition to the speeches by the
foreign ministers, spectators will hear
remarks from University President
Donald Kennedy and Board of Trustees
President Warren Christopher.
Speeches by History Prof. David Ken
nedy and Education and Drama
Emeritus Prof. H. Donald Winbigler will
put the event and the Centennial
Celebration in historical context.

Following the afternoon program, stu
dents and staff have been invited to at
tend a public reception, fireworks dis
play and a moonlit dance in the Quad.
Between 1,500 and 2,000 University
alumni are also expected to attend a spe
cial alumni dinner in Stanford Stadium
that evening, said University Relations
Director Stephen Peeps, chief executive
of the Centennial Celebration.
The Cornerstone Weekend is the first
of two gala celebrations of the Stanford
Centennial,' Peeps said.
Begun last year with the anniversary
of Stanford's founding grant, the Cen
tennial will feature a series of forums,
conferences and events that will "leave a
legacy that will draw attention to Stan
ford and its accomplishments." he said.
University organizers hope to cap off
the five-year celebration on an even big-
ger scale in October 1991, the
100 th anniversary of Stanford's
opening. Peeps said.
Cornerstone Weekend events
will continue through Saturday.
May 16. Visiting alumni and
members of the local Stanford
community are being encouraged
to attend a variety of forums,
panel discussions, and student
performances and exhibitions.
On Friday, alumni have been
invited to attend regular sessions
of selected 9 and 10 a.m. classes.

Student music, drama and per
formance groups will also be scat
tered at seven places on campus to
provide entertainment through
out the afternoon.
Saturday will feature panel dis
cussions focusing on the Ameri
can West. Much of the discussion
will focus on Stanford's "unique
short-term growth and Western lo
cation" and the University's spe
cial role in Pacific Rim issues,
Peeps said.
Panel topics on Saturday morn
ing include "The Politics and
Policies of the American West,"
"The Future of Education in Cali
fornia" and"The National Eco
nomy and the Pacific Rim."
