# Basebrawl is not poetic
## 
### 
I went to the Giants-Dodgers
game Tuesday night and there
were a lot of fights in the stands.
Earlier in the day I had read a
column by Ron Fimrite in
Sports Illustrated about how he
was sick of all the "literati" who
write poem after poem after
story about the diamond game.

"Writers who otherwise as
sume a properly cynical posture
toward humankind.'' Fimrite
wrote, "tend to collapse to their
knees in tears when composing
love songs to baseball.''
Well, no writer would write
anything close to a love song if
he saw Tuesday night's game.
Maybe a good blood-and-guts
story, but no love story.
Candlestick was surprisingly
warm, my buddies and I had
consumed a couple of rounds of
beer by the fourth inning, and
we were all feeling good. Base
ball has that time-stopping
quality to it.and we would have
been swept away if there hadn't
been a fight every 10 minutes or
so.
We knew when a fight oc
curred because everybody stood
up and pointed toward it and
started cheering. Most of the
fights took place out in the left
field bleachers, and we would
see a mass of people all bunched
up and security guards running

toward them.
At first I thought of it as a
three-ring circus — a baseball
game out there, beer right in
front of us and boxing to the left.
Then I saw some policeman
taking a guy out in handcuffs. It
occurred to me that the guy was
going to spend the night in jail. I
looked at my beer and said.
"Maybe they shouldn't be selling
this stuff to us."
Yesterday I found out that 20
fans were cited for public
drunkenness and 75 were
ejected from the ballpark. I'm
keeping my "properly cynical
posture toward humankind."
Luckily, just as the fighting
reached a peak and the helmet
ed riot police marched into the
bleachers (how would you fit
that line into a poem?), the
Giants and Dodgers decided to
take back the night.
The Dodgers led 3-1 going into
the fifth inning, when they
strung together four singles to
score three more runs. But the
Giants came right back with a
double, a triple and a Jeff
Leonard home run to score three
runs of their own in the bottom
of the fifth.
Chris Speier tied the ballgame
with a homer in the sixth, and
then in the bottom of the
seventh it started to get ugly on
the field too.
With a Giant run already in.
and the San Francisco crowd
chanting "Dodgers suck."
Leonard drew a walk and imme
diately began taunting Los An
geles pitcher Matt Young.
Leonard took a huge lead off of
first and wiggled his hips.

Sure enough Young yanked
his pick-off throw into the dirt,
and Leonard swaggered into
second. Leonard scored on a
single and the Giants led 7-5.
Meanwhile, the vendors had
stopped serving beer. Maybe
they moved the kegs into the
dugout.
In the ninth, the Dodgers
scored three heroic (as Mr.
Fimrite would not put it) runs to
go ahead 8-7. The Giants
bounced right back with a run
to send the already "epic" game
into extra innings.
The boxing moved from the
bleachers to the third-base line
in the tenth. With a man on
second. Giants pitcher Scott
Garrelts intentionally walked
Pedro Guerrero to face Dodger
cleanup hitter Mike Marshall.
This is not a good thing to do to
a man with pride.
Marshall hit Garrelts' first
pitch over the left-field fence,
and made some poetic gestures
at Garrelts as he rounded the
bases.
Garrelts' bean-ball pitch to the
next batter was one of the best
I've ever seen — it went over and
behind the batter's head.
So both teams met on the
first-base line to push and shove
each other a bit. Giant Chris
Brown and Guerrero desperately
wanted to go at it. but there
were 50 or so shuffling men be
tween them. The crowd was
going crazy, and I. myself, was
standing on my seat itching to
see the first punch.
Maybe Fimrite should be
happy that most of the time you
can write poems about baseball.
