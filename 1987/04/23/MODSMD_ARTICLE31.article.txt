### JON WEISMAN Staff writer 
Taking a breather from the
worries of getting invited to the
NCAA Championships, several
members of the Stanford men's
tennis team will be participating
in the Pacific 10 Championships
in Ojai.
The Pac-lOs, which begins
today and continues through
Sunday, is a purely individual
tournament. USC clinched the
Pacific 10 Southern Division title
last weekend when it beat Stan
ford and California while UCLA
lost to the Bears. The Trojans are
9-0, followed by UCLA at 6-3, Cali
fornia at 5-4 and Stanford at 4-5.
Though there are more than 20
different divisions at the Pac-lOs.
only a few concern the Cardinal.
One is the main Six-Pac draw for
men. which has a five-round
single elimination tournament of
32 players.
Stanford is sending six players
to compete in that draw: freshmen
Jeff Tarango (21-6. ranked 31st)
and Barry Richards (13-6), sopho
more Curtis Dunn (7-2) and
seniors Patrick McEnroe (8-7.
ranked 24th), Mark Jacobson (9-
6) and Scott Moody (13-12).
Freshman Jeff Cathrall and
senior Geordie McKee are nursing
injuries and are not making the
trip.
Their competition is scheduled
to include three of the nation's top
six players. USC's Luke Jensen
and Rick Leach are ranked second
and fourth respectively, though
they each lost to McEnroe and
Tarango last weekend. Also, sixth
ranked Steve DeVries of California
will play.
In last year's tournament,
McEnroe and Moody both reached
the semifinals. McEnroe defeated
the Bears' Woody Hunt (currently
ranked 14th) and Jensen, while
Moody knocked off DeVries in the
second round before bowing to
USC's John Carras (currently
21st).
In doubles, Richards will replace
the injured Cathrall as freshman
Eric Peus' doubles partner. The
two competed together once this
year and won. McEnroe and
Moody (7-2, ranked 50th) and
Tarango and Jacobson (2-4) will
form the other two teams.
In the independent division,
which will feature players from
schools like No. 2 Long Beach
State and No. 10 Pepperdine, Peus
(1-0) and freshman Jonathan
Kahn will play singles, and Dunn
and Kahn (2-1) will play doubles.
The men's final dual match of
the regular season is May 1
against Cal, with the indoor
mixed-doubles match against the
Bears May 2 at Maples Pavilion.
