## 
### ALICIA KENT Staff writer 
Heading down south to catch the Waves, the Stan
ford men's volleyball team will face a hard-hitting
surf at 6 p.m. tonight when it plays No. 3 Pepperdine
at San Diego State's Peterson Gym in the semifinals
of the Western Regional.
Currently ranked No. 8 in the nation with a 21-1 1
overall record, the Cardinal ended its conference
season last weekend with two wins to give it a 10-8
record and fifth place in the Western Intercollegiate
Volleyball Association.
The Waves, 21-6 overall and 15-3 in the WIVA,
finished second in the WIVA. but tonight the stand
ings are irrelevant as the Cardinal tries to advance to
the regional final Saturday at 7:30 p.m. Third-place
USC. ranked No. 4 nationally, will battle fourth-place
UC-Santa Barbara, ranked No. 7. tonight at 8 to de
termine the other finalist.
The winner of Saturday's final will advance to the
NCAA tournament May 1 and 2 at UCLA's Pauley
Pavilion. No. 1 UCLA and No. 2 Penn State have
already earned berths by virtue of winning their
respective conferences. No. 6 Ball State and No. 11
Ohio State remain alive for the fourth spot in the
NCAAs.
Tonight's match will be a "do or die situation," ac
cording to Pepperdine Coach Rod Wilde. "Anything
can happen," he said. Pepperdine lost to UCSB April
11. 15-6, 15-7, 15-12. while Stanford beat UCSB 1 1-
15. 15-7. 15-4.9-15. 15-7 April 18.
Last weekend's upset of UCSB ended the season
for the Cardinal on an upbeat note and instilled con
fidence that Stanford will need in facing the powerful
hitters of Pepperdine. "It was important to win: now
we know we can do well." freshman setter Parker
Blackman said.
Stanford now finds itself in an ideal position for
the regionals, having ended the season with a strong
feeling of improvement. "We are starting to play bet
ter than at any part of the season — both in our con

sistency and our quality." Stanford Coach Fred
Sturm said. "We've improved all aspects: blocking,
digging, serving."
According to freshman Kent Steffes. the team is
feeling pretty confident. "We think we can beat
them," he said. However, the Waves have the hitting
power of three All-Americas — junior Matt Rigg and
seniors Rob Scott and Troy Tanner — and the experi
ence of the 1985 and 1986 national titles.
"We've done really well in the past. 1 think that it
will help us in the long run mentally because we've
been in tough situations," Wilde said. "But Stanford
has some young guys who are really hungry. So we'll
have to stop them."
The blocking strategy against these "three tough
guys," as freshman Dan Hanan put it, will be the
Cardinal's main focus, trying to decide whether to
concentrate on the three or to plant blockers against
the rest of the team.
In the past two league matches against the Waves.
Stanford attempted both attacks, only to lose both
times. On March 7 Stanford lost 15-12, 15-11, 15-7
at home, and March 28 Pepperdine triumphed
again, 12-15, 15-10, 15-12, 16-14, although in the
second league confrontation Stanford clearly put up
a better fight.
In addition to hitting strength. Sturm thinks Pep
perdine's consistency has given the Waves the edge
in the past. "They have a good mixture of experi
enced players and inexperienced players which has
been very effective," Sturm said. "In addition, they're
very scrappy on defense and serve pretty ag
gressively."
For the Cardinal approach to this well-rounded
team, Sturm will rely on his team playing to its full
potential. "We'll have to organize at the net and exe
cute well." Sturm said. "We just have to play together
as a team."
"We are going to have to go into the match not wor
rying about who we are playing. We'll just play our
game," said Hanan, who will be starting In the
outside hitter position.
