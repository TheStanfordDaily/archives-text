# Protesters plan reunion
## 
### JOHN POLLACK Senior staff writer 
Ten years after 294 demonstra
tors were arrested in an Old Union
sit-in protesting Stanford's invest
ments in companies that do busi
ness with South Africa, partici
pants in that demonstration are
making plans to hold a reunion
here next month.
The 1977 sit-in was one of the
largest protests in Stanford his
tory and among the very first
demonstrations about the divest
ment issue in the United States.
The incident gained national
media attention and sparked
similar protests at other colleges
and universities.
The 1977 sit-in was staged
primarily to protest a decision by
the University Board of Trustees
to abstain from shareholder
resolutions concerning the Ford

Motor Company's presence in
South Africa. But while the 16-
hour demonstration did not sway
the trustees, several protesters
claim it was a success.
"In a much larger sense it was
very effective . . . (because) it
raised the issue" of apartheid and
divestment in the United States,
said Chris Coleman, one of the
Stanford students arrested during
the 1977 incident.
Coleman, who is helping plan
the reunion, was a member of the
Stanford Committee for a Respon
sible Investment Policy (SCRIP),
the student group that organized
the sit-in. He is now a banker at
Citicorp in San Francisco.
Coleman said the Stanford
campus was fairly quiet in 1976,
but that the Soweto riots of that
year — covered extensively by the
U.S. press — aroused student con
cern about South Africa.

Chris Gray, another student ar
rested at the 1977 sit-in, agreed
with Coleman's assessment.
"When you're faced with a glaring
injustice, you can get a large
minority" involved with an issue.
Gray said.
Coleman said SCRIP "con
ducted a huge education drive" on
campus about apartheid for
several weeks before the sit-in.
The issue "really exploded," he
said.
Raymond Giraud, professor
emeritus of French and Italian,
said SCRIP began in early 1977
with about nine people. "It mush
roomed out" from there, Giraud
said.
Giraud, who took part in the sit
in but was not arrested, criticized
the current trustees for their rela
tive intransigence on the divest
ment issue. "The Board of Trus
tees is still saying the same thing,
making the same argument that
they did in 1977," he said.
"Stanford is the great laggard in
the company of great univer
sities," he added.
Biology Prof. Dow Woodward,
who also participated in the 1977
sit-in. echoed Giraud's senti
ments. He said the trustees would
only divest if Stanford's South
Africa-related investments were in
danger of losing money.

Woodward said the trustees are
afraid divestment might alienate
the University's current and po
tential corporate donors that now
do business in South Africa.
He said the current trustees are
"insensitive" to student opinion
on divestment, and added that
Stanford is "clearly not the leader"
on this issue.
But Coleman was more optimis
tic than Woodward about the
prospects for divestment. Calling
Stanford's divestment "inevit
able." Coieman said both moral
and public relations considera
tions will cause the University to
divest.
