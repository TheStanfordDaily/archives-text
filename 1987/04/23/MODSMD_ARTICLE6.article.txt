# Recount likely in COP race
## Vote tally still incomplete 
### ANN MARSH Staff writer 
The Slate of the Union will probably ask the ASSU
Elections Commission to recount the Council of
Presidents election totals, slate member Mike Cahill
said yesterday.
Meanwhile, portions of more than 400 ballots from
last week's ASSU general election remain to be
counted, and ASSU elections officers have yet to set a
date for a COP runoff election.
Final vote counts have been delayed because of
complications with the scanning machine supplied
by the Registrar's Office, according to Elections
Commissioner Brett Jarvis. The machine registered
only one side of the two-sided ballot, delaying the tal
lying of over 400 fee request votes.
Jarvis said the uncounted votes could potentially
affect the outcome in two of the 22 student fee re
quests: the Chaparral and Stanford Action.
The counting delay will not affect the results of the
ASSU Senate and COP races, he said.
Cahill said his slate, which narrowly lost a runoff
spot to The Plan, may request that the elections com
mission waive the *250 bond required to recount
votes because of The Plan's slim margin of victory
over Slate of the Union.
"I think the vote was so close that they should be
required to do a recount" to insure accuracy, Cahill
said. The Plan defeated Slate of the Union by only 2
percent of the total vote cast, according to Jarvis.
But Jarvis said he doubted a recount would be in
itiated without the bond money, which is retrievable
only if the recount proves the initial results inac
curate.
Although the senate has already certified the latest
election results, Jarvis said the date of the COP
runoff has not yet been set because the senate is still
in the process of certifying that the conduct of the
candidates during the campaign complied with
ASSU rules. A date for the runoff should be an
nounced by Monday, Jarvis said.
Election commissioners have also yet to obtain 12
votes from the overseas campus in Berlin, which
were also completed incorrectly, Jarvis said. As a
result, the elections commission plans to call the
program in Germany and obtain the students' votes
via telephone.
The wait for official results has aggravated some
student leaders. "1 think it's absurd," said current
COP member Mary Thurber of this year's elections
process. Thurber blames the delays on a slow and in
efficient system of counting votes, not on the elec
tions commission.
"We're trying to get some money together to do
some research on how to improve the system," she
said. "People should be able to get the results within
24 hours of voting."
In preparation for their runoff next week, the two
