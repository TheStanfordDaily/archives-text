Police kill six in South Africa
STELLENBOSCH, South Africa — South African police opened
fire on rampaging crowds in Johannesburg yesterday, fatally
wounding six striking black transport workers in an intensifying
labor conflict that has racial undercurrents.
Wednesday's clashes in Johannesburg came after the state
owned South African Transport Services fired 16,000 striking
black railwaymen in one of the largest mass dismissals in the
country's history. Union leaders said the firings could lead to an
escalation of violence in the six-week-old walkout.
Last night, in a hard-line campaign speech here in advance of
May 6 whites-only parliamentary elections, President Pieter Botha
warned that a "revolutionary onslaught" in this country was wors
ening and asserted that "wherever freedom is being challenged,
freedom has to be defended."
Speaking in tnis traditional home of Afrikaner intellectuals,
Botha defended what he termed the government's "inherent right
to defend itself when its existence is at stake," and said that from
time to time it is necessary to suspend civil liberties to cope with
"urgent danger."
Botha did not refer directly to violence in Johannesburg and its
black township of Soweto, which has posed a serious challenge to
the authority of the ruling National Party during the election cam
paign.
But he made it clear to a largely partisan crowd of 1.800 that he
intended to deal firmly with civil unrest, a position likely to under
cut claims by his extreme right-wing opposition that his govern
ment has been too soft on militant black protesters. "There is a
total onslaught against our security and our way of life," Botha
told his cheering followers.
SDI timetable judged unrealistic
WASHINGTON — A decade or more of additional research is
needed to resolve key technical questions surrounding the devel
opment of a sophisticated defense against Soviet ballistic
missiles, according to a report released yesterday that challenges
the Reagan administration's timetable for the Strategic Defense
Initiative (SDI).
The assessment by a 17-member panel associated with the
American Physical Society, the premier scientific organization of
U.S. physicists, runs counter to longstanding administration
contentions that sufficient information will be produced by the
Pentagon's SDI research program to decide on development of key
missile defense technologies in the early 1990s or sooner.
The panel, which included military and civilian scientific re
searchers, concluded after an 18-month investigation that "even
in the best of circumstances, a decade or more of intensive re
search would be needed for an informed decision about the poten
tial effectiveness and survivability" of the most promising laser,
particle beam and microwave weapons.
Since President Reagan first enthusiastically endorsed an ac
celerated research program into defenses against strategic nu
clear missiles four years ago, it has been a controversial and in
creasingly costly part of the Defense Department's budget. Some
of the administration's most ardent SDI supporters have urged
that a White House decision be made soon on whether to develop
the first portions of a missile defense, despite concerns about
technical feasibility and superpower arms control restrictions.
Delay urged for trade action
WASHINGTON — House Minority Leader Robert Michel, R-111.,
urged yesterday that the House postpone action on trade legisla
tion until Japanese Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone concludes
next week's meetings in Washington with President Reagan.
When Nakasone arrives in Washington April 29, he is expected
to ask Reagan to cancel the 100 percent tariffs he imposed last
week on >300 million worth of Japanese computers, power tools
and televisions. Reagan acted in retaliation for Japan's failure to
live up to an agreement to control the world price of computer
chips.
Former Japanese Foreign Minister Shintaro Abe, in Washing
ton this week as a special envoy from Nakasone to persuade
Reagan to void the new tariffs or lift them "as soon as possible,"
was told by Reagan and top administration officials that they will
have to stay in place a month or more.
Administration officials told Abe that the Japanese would first
have to live up to the agreement on computer chip prices and
prevent Japanese chip manufacturers from "dumping" chips
abroad at below cost.
At a news conference after two days of talks here, Abe said he
would report to Nakasone that the administration and Congress
also want Japan to take its long-promised steps of stimulating its
own domestic economy.
Sri Lankan rebels attacked
COLOMBO, Sri Lanka — More than 100 people, most of them
Tamil guerrillas, were killed and an equal number injured yester
day as Lankan military airplanes bombed guerrilla positions in
strife-torn north and east Sri Lanka, informed sources said.
The state-run media center confirmed the raids, but said 80
Tamil guerrillas were killed and about the same number injured
in the attacks.
Some civilians also were affected, the media center said, adding
that the military operations were directed at guerrilla positions
run by the radical Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam and their
allies in the Eelam Revolutionary Organizations of Students, who
were held responsible for a spate of massacres of civilians in the
last few days.
The latest was Tuesday's bomb explosion at a Colombo bus sta
tion in which nearly 150 civilians were killed and 200 injured. A
government spokesman said the "government will continue with
out reservation to strike at all (the rebel groups') targets until the
killing of innocent civilians and their attempts to impede the
peace process are abandoned."
U.S. diplomat accused as spy
WARSAW — The Polish government yesterday accused a U.S.
diplomat stationed here of spying and said his activity was
evidence of aggressive American espionage in Soviet-Bloc
countries.
Government spokesman Jerzy Urban said that Albert Mueller, a
second secretary in the political section of the U.S. Embassy, had
been "caught red-handed" Saturday night as he met with a con
tact to deliver spying equipment, money and instructions.
Urban said Mueller was detained by police until he was identi
fied as a diplomat, then released to American officials. The Polish
Foreign Ministry delivered a protest note to U.S. officials here
Monday about Mueller's activity but did not formally expel him.
Urban said. A U.S. Embassy spokesman said Mueller had left the
country Sunday.
The incident, which Urban described as a setback in
U.S./Polish relations, came at a time when the Reagan adminis
tration has focused attention on alleged spying by Soviet agents at
the U.S. Embassy in Moscow. It also coincided with the Polish gov
ernment's reaction to revelations by a high-level defector, Ryszard
Kukllnskl, who it says supplied the CIA with an Inside account of
preparations for martial law In 1981.
