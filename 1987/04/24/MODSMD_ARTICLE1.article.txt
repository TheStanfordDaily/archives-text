# Stanford loses Reagan Library
## 
### CHARLIE GOFEN MARK LAWRENCE Senior staff writers 
The Ronald Reagan Presidential Foun
dation announced yesterday that it has
abandoned its plans to build the Reagan
Library at Stanford and will search for a
new location in Southern California.
The announcement came in the wake of
Increasing faculty opposition to the li
brary. Faculty members had argued that
the facility posed a threat to academic
freedom by linking Stanford with Reagan
conservatism. The faculty's opposition
was spurred largely by a recent statement
of Hoover Institution Director W. Glenn
Campbell, who wrote in the 1986 Hoover
annual report that the addition of the
Reagan Library gave Stanford reason to

"boast" of a "Reagan connection."
The foundation did not mention faculty
opposition in its terse statement yester
day, but said only that it sought a location
where a Reagan public affairs center
could be built adjacent to the library. "It is
regrettable that this cannot be accom
plished at Stanford University," the state
ment said.
The foundation had originally proposed
that an accompanying public policy cen
ter be governed by Hoover, but Stanford's
Board of Trustees opposed the plan from
the start.
In December 1983 the trustees voted
unanimously to accept the library on the
condition that Hoover not govern a public
affairs center at Stanford. In February
1984 Presidential Counselor Edwin
Meese announced that acceptance of the

library would be "independent" of any
public affairs center, clearing the path for
an agreement in principle to locate the li
brary at Stanford.
In February 1985, the trustees ap
proved a 20-acre site for the library in the
foothills overlooking campus. The library
plans had become a point of contention in
recent weeks. Critics charged that the li
brary would become more of a tourist at
traction than an academic resource and
thus should not be located so near to the
center of campus. Some opponents also
argued that the proposed structure was
too large, and the Faculty Senate voted
three weeks ago to scale down the facility
or move it further from campus.
The undetermined location of the
public affairs center also had been a focus
of recent debate. Stanford faculty charged

that Campbell was planning to locate a
Hoover-run policy center near the library.
Such a location, the critics said, might
cause the public to associate the center
with Stanford.
Despite the faculty objections to the
Reagan Library plans, though, the Stan
ford trustees and University President
Donald Kennedy had recently reaffirmed
support for the library. The foundation's
decision apparently came as a surprise to
the trustees as well as to the Stanford
community.
In a joint statement. Kennedy and
Board of Trustees President Warren
Christopher said: "We were proceeding
diligently and on schedule with our plan
ning for the library, and so we are
naturally disappointed with the decision
of the trustees of the Reagan Presidential

Foundation.
"While we regret the decision, we cer
tainly wish them success in their efforts
with this very important undertaking. To
that end. we will cooperate with the foun
dation and make available all our plan
ning materials."
Kennedy was unavailable for comment
yesterday. Another University adminis
trator, speaking on condition of
anonymity, speculated that recent faculty
objections to the library had played a part
in the foundation's decision. The admin
istrator said the foundation might have
decided that it could head off controversy
by relocating the library in Southern Cali
fornia.
Most Stanford faculty members had
agreed that the library would be a
valuable academic resource, but
some said the advantages would
be overshadowed by thr perceived
connection between Stanford and
the Reagan administration.
The loudest faculty critics of the
proposed library expressed joy al
yesterday's announcement, and
some took credit for the founda
tion's decision.
"A lot of people worked hard for
this." said Political Science Prof.
John Mauley, asserting thai the
foundation reacted to a "grass
roots effort" within the Stanford
community to oppose the library.
The foundation did not specify
where In Southern California the
facility would be built, but Oc
cidental College and USC have
both expressed Interest In hosting
the library, according to Political
Science Prof. Alexander George.
The Reagan Foundation board
of trustees made Its decision at a
meeting yesterday morning In
Washington. D.C. Hoover Director
Campbell, who Is on a sabbatical
from Hoover to raise about *100
million for the library and public
affairs center, is chairman of the
foundation.
Campbell and Charles Palm.
Stanford's liaison with the Reagan
foundation, were unavailable for
comment yesterday.
