# Guatemalans criticize U.S. policy
## 
### JAY BHATTACHARYA 
The Guatemalan government is "the worst
human rights violator In the hemisphere,"
Guatemalan labor lawyer Enrique Torres said
yesterday.
Torres and student refugee William Cas
teneda told a White Plaza audience of about 25
of the human rights abuses In Guatemala and
criticized U.S. policy in the region.
Torres condemned the government's strat
egy of "destroying the guerilla counter-
Insurgency" by lndiscrimlnantly "destroying
the people. Despite this tactic, opposition to
the government is stlU strong, he said.
Torres also criticized the U.S. government
for sending aid to the Guatemalan military. In
creased U.S. presence in Central America
could lead first to a regional conflict, and then
to a major war, he said.
Central America is now little more than "a
colony for the United States" with "no govern
ment for the people," Casteneda said.
A Guatemalan University student In exile,
Castoneda recounted his personal experiences
with the human rights abuses. According to
Casteneda, there are 20,000 students In

Guatemala who have "lost everything they
have worked for."
With the help of Interpreter Marty Rum
baugh, Casteneda described Guatemalan uni
versity life as radically different from that In
the United States. According to Castenada. the
"freedom of thought" students enjoy here is
non-existent in Guatemala. "The university is
invaded by the army of Guatemala," he said,
and students are often "accused of being com
munist or subversive."
"Many students are assassinated, or
caputured. Many are left wounded with no
hospital that will care for them because the
army controls them all," he said.
Torres also criticized the American news
media's presentation of the situation in
Guatemala. Journalists excuse the oppression
of the year-old Christian Democratic Govern
ment in Guatemala as a "process Of building
democracy," Torres said.
Establishing a democracy should not re
quire so much violence, he added.
Torres said that the current regime of Presi
dent Vinlcio Cerezo has made no effort to cur
tall the abuses of the military.
He also gave examples of the oppression

faced by "a generation of (Guatemalans) that
has grown up under the military."
"Growing a beard has been considered sub
versive at times," Torres said, adding that the
military has been diligent In enforcing even
this minor prohibition.
In a harrowing account of his own experi
ences with the Guatemalan military, Cas
teneda said he and four university friends were
captured and tortured for 15 days by the army.
According to Casteneda, the military usually
finds and assassinates those who are released.
After his friends were killed, he said he fled the
country, fearing that he was next on the list.
The event was sponsored by the Palo Alto-
Stanford Medical Aid Committee for Central
America. According to Mary Navarro, volunteer
coordinator of the organization, the main pur
pose of the program was to draw attention to
the situation in Guatemala, which the media
generally Ignores.
The speakers are on a 50-city tour called
"The Caravan for the Forgotten." They have
spoken at other Bay Area locations including
San Francisco, Oakland and San Jose. The
tour also has collected over • 15,000 to be used
to buy relief supplies for Guatemala.
