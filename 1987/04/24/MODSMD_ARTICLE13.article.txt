# El Salvador group discusses trip
## 
### SUHA JHAVERI Staff writer 
Students who spent spring
break viewing El Salvador last
night praised the courage of
the Salvadorans and criticized
U.S. military involvement in
the country.
Several of the students who
traveled to El Salvador con
ducted the slide show and
question-and-answer session
entitled "El Slavador: A Nation
at War" in Dinkelspiel Audi
torium. The student group
spent eight days in the country
to work with local students to
rebuild a university.
El Salvador "is a beautiful
country, but it is a country of
war," senior Tom Lee said.
In their impressions of the
experience, many students
noted the perserverance of the
Salvadorans.
"The strength of their beliefs,
despite their poverty, gives
these people incredible hope."
said junior Kirsten Jones.
Panel members stressed the
need for American citizens to
pressure the U.S. government
to instigate change in El Sal
vador; the students were wary
of prospects for the future,
however.
Several of the panelists said
Salvadoran President Jose
Napoleon Duarte was "merely a
puppet of the United States"
with little support from the
local population.
"El Salvador is only an issue
when talked about in commu
nist terms in the United
States." said senior Lise
Grande. "It is an internal struc

tural problem that El Salvador
needs to solve in its own time
and pace."
The presentation, however,
ended in a heated exchange
when junior Lisette Bloch, a
resident of El Salvador, ques
tioned the purpose of a visit to
the troubled country by Stan
ford students over spring
break.
Bloch said the trip was
"political" rather than humane,
and led to a "one-sided" experi
ence.
"I would have expected Stan
ford students to reach beyond
the program planned by the
University to understand all
sides of El Salvador's situa
tion," she said, adding that the
students' "conclusions are not
objective."
"First of all. you only worked
rebuilding the university for
one hour," Bloch said. "How
can you justify this to the
people you received money
from?"
According to junior Karen
Marangi, she and the other
Stanford students were un
aware that their work would be
limited to one afternoon.
Freshman Kristen Jordhal
stressed that an attempt had
been made to reach out to El
Salvador. "We went there to
shed light on a situation." she
said. "Now people (at Stanford)
are finally talking about it."
Acting Dean of the Chapel
Thomas Ambrogi added that
the "symbolic value of working
with our El Salvadoran broth
ers and sisters" was the pur
pose of the visit.
