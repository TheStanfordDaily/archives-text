## THE 						STANFORD DAILY An Independent Newspaper Save the condor 
### 
On Sunday, the last known California con
dor was captured in the Bitter Creek Na
tional Wildlife Refuge in Kern County near
Bakersfield. The capture of Adult Condor 9
marked the end of a yearlong effort to remove
the last four known condors from their envi
ronment — where several have been
poisoned in recent years.
While it is sad to see a rare bird plucked
out of the sky and caged, it is also a hopeful
sign that the condor will eventually return to
the California wilderness in full force. Scien
tists are able to construct artificial environ
ments conducive to mating, and now that
the last handful of condors has been saved,
conservationists can see to the mating of the
birds in captivity. Or at least, cheer things
along.
After the condors mate, scientists and con
servationists will be faced with the task of
successfully reintroducing the progeny of
their captives. Hopefully, it will not be more

than a few years before the condor again sails
majestically over the California landscape.
Before the 19-pound vulture can start
courting other condors, however, Adult Con
dor 9 will undergo blood tests for pesticides
and heavy metal poisoning. The condor's
story is not a new one. America's wildlife and
wilderness are disappearing at an alarming
rate as stable ecosystems are destroyed by
pesticides, pollution, toxic wastes, oil spills,
etc. The list seems to be unending.
The natural world can be a great benefit to
humankind. It is a source of knowledge and
beauty. Unfortunately, man exhibits a more
impressive ability to destroy the world
around him than to appreciate it.
Recent efforts to save the condor, however,
are an encouraging signal that some people
recognize the lethal effects of man-made
civilization. Perhaps the real solution lies not
in treating symptoms, but addressing the
causes of the ruin of our environment.
