Shovld some
be more equal
than others?
The new David Starr Jordan
Scholars program raises many
questions about how this admis
sions policy will affect undergrad
uate life at Stanford. The Office of
Admissions has initiated the
program in an effort to reduce the
number of highly qualified appli
cants who decide not to attend
Stanford after they have been
offered admission. While this
scheme may seem effective to an
admissions officer who is trying
to attract talented students, is
such a program consistent with
the values of this university?
One of the greatest learning
experiences we had as Stanford
students was understanding that
we all stood on equal ground
when we first arrived here as
freshmen. Every individual was
admitted to Stanford because
there was at least one part of
his/her character or one thing
that he/she accomplished that
really made him/her special.
Nobody told us before we saw our
first red-shirted orientation vol
unteer what special quality each
of us had or who was the most
talented among us. Rather, it has
been only after we have lived
together, studied together, joked
together, eaten together and
sometimes even drunk or slept
together that we have gradually
come to understand and to feel
what is truly special about each
one of us. Officially recognizing
some freshmen as "Jordan
Scholars" before they even come
to Stanford threatens the sense of
equality among incoming fresh
men that is so crucial to the suc
cess of a Stanford education.
Incoming freshmen here
already have enough natural
insecurities with which to cope
because of the tendency they have

to compare themselves to each
other. Isn't this exactly the kind
of thing that the whole spirit of
freshman orientation tries to
prevent? The Jordan Scholars
program will only exacerbate this
inclination. It contradicts the
values of this institution when
the University provides new mem
bers of the Stanford community
with guidelines to compare them
selves to each other in terms of
"more preferred" and "less
preferred" students. It promotes
the existence of hierarchies
among impressionable young
freshmen from the moment they
set foot on campus.
We have all learned many
things and grown in many ways
while at Stanford, and one thing
that we have clearly learned is
that such a program will hurt the
quality of undergraduate life.
While the program might cause a
few dozen more talented prospec
tive freshmen to come to Stan
ford, this benefit is clearly out
weighed by the heavy toll that
this will take on the Stanford
experience for all students. The
program does not "adhere to the
University's fundamental stand
ards," to quote Dean Fetter
(Daily, April 20), and it is doubt
ful indeed that "the University's
first president, David Starr Jor
dan. who first developed the Uni
versity's fundamental standards"
would have supported such a
scheme.

Program to get
scholars is
deeply flawed
I am pleased to see that the
Office of Admissions has found a
way to recognize the truly excep
tional members of the freshman
class with the David Starr Jordan
Scholar distinction. The distinc-

tion alone, however, is inade
quate. Other programs should be
established to help these excep
tional students take full advan
tage of their years at Stanford.
What about making Storey
House and 558 Mayfield David
Starr Jordan theme houses?
Perhaps we could build a special
David Starr Jordan Library, ex
clusively for the use of the
scholars (although it may be
difficult to find an appropriate
site)? The front of the balcony in
Mem Aud could be designated the
David Starr Jordan Flicks Section
and 50-yard-line seats in the
student section could be reserved
as well.
Jordan scholars should also
have a separate Draw, with num
bers from one to 200. They
should also be permitted to sign
up for classes first each quarter.
Each scholar should be provided
with his or her own personal
Macintosh, to encourage
creativity and computer literacy.
Academic advisers for the Jordan
Scholars will be chosen from the
pool of previous scholars, except
for the first year, when scholars
will be advised by specially desig
nated Honorary David Starr Jor
dan Scholars.
Each year the scholars could
have a special dinner with Univer
sity President Donald Kennedy to
discuss their academic experi
ences and share their insights
with one another. At the end of
their Stanford career, they will
attend special Jordan Scholar
recruiting sessions to screen
possible employers. Once their
major life decisions are made,
they can relax at their special
Jordan Scholar Senior Weekend
in Hawaii, then attend the sepa
rate (but equal) David Starr Jor
dan Scholar graduation in Frost.
After all, while we all got in,
some of us got in better than
others.

scholars is
deeply flawed
I am pleased to see that the
Office of Admissions has found a
way to recognize the truly excep
tional members of the freshman
class with the David Starr Jordan
Scholar distinction. The distinc-

tion alone, however, is inade
quate. Other programs should be
established to help these excep
tional students take full advan
tage of their years at Stanford.
What about making Storey
House and 558 Mayfield David
Starr Jordan theme houses?
Perhaps we could build a special
David Starr Jordan Library, ex
clusively for the use of the
scholars (although it may be
difficult to find an appropriate
site)? The front of the balcony in
Mem Aud could be designated the
David Starr Jordan Flicks Section
and 50-yard-line seats in the
student section could be reserved
as well.
Jordan scholars should also
have a separate Draw, with num
bers from one to 200. They
should also be permitted to sign
up for classes first each quarter.
Each scholar should be provided
with his or her own personal
Macintosh, to encourage
creativity and computer literacy.
Academic advisers for the Jordan
Scholars will be chosen from the
pool of previous scholars, except
for the first year, when scholars
will be advised by specially desig
nated Honorary David Starr Jor
dan Scholars.
Each year the scholars could
have a special dinner with Univer
sity President Donald Kennedy to
discuss their academic experi
ences and share their insights
with one another. At the end of
their Stanford career, they will
attend special Jordan Scholar
recruiting sessions to screen
possible employers. Once their
major life decisions are made,
they can relax at their special
Jordan Scholar Senior Weekend
in Hawaii, then attend the sepa
rate (but equal) David Starr Jor
dan Scholar graduation in Frost.
After all, while we all got in,
some of us got in better than
others.
