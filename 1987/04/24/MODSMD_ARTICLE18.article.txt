# No Reagan connection
## 
### 
So the Reagan Library isn't coming to Stanford.
After more than four years of plans and protests, the
Ronald Reagan Presidential Library Foundation has
decided to go elsewhere, and I can't help feeling that
this match between Ronald Reagan's library and
Leland Stanford's university was never meant to be.

I'll be honest. I'm not a big fan of Ronald Reagan —
or the Hoover Institution, for that matter. I didn't
want the library to come here from the beginning. I
didn't like the proposed site of the library, and I
didn't like the proposed design of the library.
I won't deny that my prejudice against the library
gave me a skeptical attitude about the whole thing
from the start. But my reasons for not wanting the li
brary at Stanford run deeper than a dislike of the li
brary's site or problems with Reagan's policies. Quite
simply, the Reagan Library had no business on the
Stanford campus in the first place; it just didn't
belong here.
Proponents of the library claimed that it would
have been an invaluable academic resource to the
University, and they were probably right. However,
there are a lot of libraries Stanford could obtain in
order to create an academic resource for the Univer
sity. The only reason, really, that the Reagan Library
was slated to be built at Stanford is because the
Hoover Institution wanted it to be. Hoover
originated, sustained and tirelessly promoted the
idea of the Reagan Library.
W. Glenn Campbell, director of the Hoover Institu
tion, boasted in the 1986 Hoover annual report that
the presence of the library would create a "Reagan
connection" between the White House and the Uni
versity. Regardless of the implications that state
ment had for Stanford's standing as an academic,
non-partisan institution, Campbell was right. The li
brary would have created something of a
"connection." But the real point is that no
"connection" existed in the first place.
Stanford doesn't have a Reagan "connection," and
it probably never will. Ronald Reagan has a few
friends in the Hoover Institution, was governor of
California for a while and his gubernatorial papers
are stored in Hoover. He didn't graduate from Stan
ford. He didn't attend Stanford. The mere fact that
Stanford is the pre-eminent private university in the
state where he was once governor is not reason
enough to build the Reagan Library here; if every
private university in.the country used that reason
ing, Harvard would have more presidential libraries

than It knew what do do with.
Think about it. We have the Hoover Institution
here, and a lot of people don't like it. Who allowed the
Hoover Institution to be built in the first place, and
why hasn't it been driven off campus since? Why
aren't there organized groups of concerned citizens
collecting signatures against Hoover? Why isn't the
Faculty Senate drafting resolutions condemning
Hoover?
Granted, the Hoover Institution is not welcomed
with open arms by most members of the Stanford
faculty, and there are those who would rejoice at the
sight of a crumbling Hoover Tower. But Herbert
Hoover was a Stanford alumnus. He does have a
Stanford connection. Although he wasn't the most
notable of presidents, Stanford did have a hand in
his creation. Hence, the attitude at Stanford toward
the Hoover Institution is one of tacit acceptance. The
tributes to Herbert Hoover located in the lobby of
Hoover Tower are somehow OK, because Hoover,
regardless of one's assessment of his presidency, is a
Stanford man.
But Ronald Reagan isn't. When officials at Hoover
tried to claim that the library would not contain fa
vorable Reagan memorabilia or tributes to his
presidency, I never believed them. Of course a presi
dential library is going to present that presidency in
the best light possible. There's nothing wrong with
that. Presidential libraries are as much tributes as
they are academic resources; anyone who has ever
visited one could tell you that.
And though my opposition to the library centers
on the overall idea of the place, the Reagan Library
did have some serious logistical problems: It would
have created traffic problems, its effect on the natu
ral landscape may have been disastrous and its
design was not as originally planned. And there were
problems with the people involved, too: Campbell,
who wouldn't win any popularity contests among
Stanford faculty anyway, made some blatantly par
tisan remarks that did nothing more than make
people mad, and the libraiy's architect made some
snide comments about Stanford's sandstone-and
tile style that nobody appreciated.
But the library itself. I think, was the real problem.
People at Stanford felt uncomfortable with the idea of
having a sort of monument to the Reagan presidency
on campus, and they let their opinions be known. All
the letters, petitions, resolutions and protests must
have done something — but let's not kid ourselves
into thinking that the Reagan administration actu
ally listened to the Stanford community. It's more
likely the White House heard what was going on at
Stanford and decided not to deal with the whole sit
uation.
In the end, though, I think the members of the
foundation made the right decision. Both for them
and for us.
