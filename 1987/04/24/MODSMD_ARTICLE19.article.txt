# Recommendations need clarification
## 
### 
The Western Culture Task Force is grateful
for all the comments by faculty and students
on our draft on the Area One requirement.
These comments make it clear that some sig
nificant amount of elaboration is needed in ex
planation of the rationale, objectives and
criteria in the task force's recommendations.
These comments also raise problems that will
be addressed by the task force as it continues
its deliberations.

It is important to note that all the faculty
members on the task force teach in the West
ern Culture program, and all three student
members have taken one or another of the
tracks. Three of the faculty are presently ser
ving as chairs of three of the program's eight
tracks, another faculty member served as chair
of a fourth track until recently and still an
other faculty member designed the experimen
tal course currently being given this spring
quarter. Two faculty members served on the
task force that in 1976-77 designed the cur
rent program. In other words, the present task
force consists of individuals — faculty and stu
dents — who have been actively engaged In the
current program, understand its goals and ap
preciate its successes.
In carrying out our charge from the provost,
we have consulted faculty and students inside
and outside the existing eight tracks. We have
been made aware of the strengths and weak
nesses in the current program and of the sub
stantial changes that are already taking place
in the eight tracks. Our draft recommen
dations endorse the changes that have taken

place and provide for a continuation of the evo
lutionary process already under way.
We will take into account the comments we
have received in our further deliberations and
recommendations. The Area One requirement
is one of the most important parts of under
graduate education at Stanford and deserves
the thoughtful attention of all of us.
Answers to questions on the task force's
recommendations for the Area One require
ment:
□ Would the draft legislation result in the
abolition of the eight tracks currently in exis
tence?
No. The task force's draft calls for a maxi
mum of 10 tracks and presupposes the oppor
tunity for all of the existing tracks to continue.
□ Does the draft legislation prevent the
teaching of the present core list?
No. The proposal permits each track to
devise a reading list with primary works as its
focus, according to the priorities dictated by
the objectives of each track. However, the pro
posal does not prescribe a single common core
list for all 10 tracks.
□ Does the requirement to study at least one
culture outside the European family of
cultures mean that half the course must be
devoted to the study of such a non-European
culture?
No. The task force does not specify propor
tions or ratios for the study of either European
or non-European cultures, nor does it
prescribe in which quarter or quarters such
comparisons should take place. The purpose of
the geographical requirement Is to emphasize
that, when it is appropriate to introduce a
non-European culture in a European course
(or vice versa), such a culture ought to be
treated in Its own terms as well as in terms of

bers on the Task force

ture Program.

its interactions with or influence on other
cultures.
□ Does the proposed legislation assume that
teaching faculty will be experts in more than
one culture?
No. Rather, it is assumed that the teaching
faculty will consult and draw on colleagues at
Stanford who possess the necessary expertise.
□ Does the proposed legislation mandate
the abandonment of instruction on classical
and Christian antiquity?
No. The requirement that each track have a
historical dimension of at least five centuries
does not preclude a track from spanning a
longer period or from focusing on pre-modern
time periods.
□ Does the task force proposal represent a
vote of no confidence in the present eight
tracks?
No. The task force is aware that the present
tracks have already responded to concerns
raised by faculty and students. The proposed
legislation endorses the changes that have
taken place and provides for a continuation of
the evolutionary process already under way.
