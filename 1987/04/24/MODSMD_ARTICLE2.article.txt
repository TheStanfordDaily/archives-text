After three years of planning for
a Ronald Reagan Presidential Li
brary, all that remains here are Ir
relevant blueprints and a puzzling
question — Why did the Ronald
Reagan Presidential Foundation
change its mind on a matter that
had been decided in 1984?

News analysis

In Its announcement yesterday,
the foundation cited only the
desirability of having a Reagan
public affairs center adjacent to
the library. The White House, in
1983, had formally offered the li
brary, a museum and a public af
fairs center as a package, with the
center to be administered by the
Hoover Institution.
But in February 1984, the White
House and the University reached
an agreement to separate the
public affairs center from the li
brary and museum following
Stanford's insistence that a
campus-based policy center be
governed by normal University
standards — by the University
provost and not by the Hoover In
stitution.
Although the rationale for
withdrawing the library will not be
known unless members of the
Reagan foundation elaborate, the
decision may have been influ
enced by the continued protest
against the library from members
of the Stanford community.
From the beginning, the rela
tionship between Stanford and
the Reagan foundation has been
tense and often hostile as the Uni
versity endeavored to limit the li
brary to an unadorned scholarly
asset and the foundation pushed
for a memorial to President
Reagan.
The tension stems in part from
continued strain between the Uni
versity and the Hoover Institution
over the institution's alleged poli
tical partisanship. W. Glenn
Campbell, director of Hoover, is
also president of the Reagan foun
dation and Hoover Senior Fellow
Martin Anderson is the founda
tion's secretary.
Campbell exacerbated that ten
sion by writing In the 1986 Hoover
Annual Report that, with the loca
tion of both Hoover and the library
at Stanford, the entire University
could "boast" of Its "Reagan con
nection."
Campbell's comments prompted
a unanimous censure (with one
abstention) by the Faculty Senate
in February for contradicting the
"non-partisan rationale offered by
the Board of Trustees for siting
the . . . library on this campus."
The character of the opposition
changed dramatically this month

This rendering of the proposed Reagan Library site in the Stanford foothills sparked protest among many
in the Stanford community. Critics argued that the depiction made the library appear disproportionately
large in relation to the Stanford campus, while library proponents said the depiction was inaccurate and
outdated.
when the Faculty Senate and
lormei senate chairmen threw
their wrlght behind the protest:
I I Twelve former chairmen of the
Faculty Senate wrote a letter to the
senate stating that "the library Is
simply too large and the expected
level ol usage too high for that
(Junlpero Serra) site." The letter
proposed revising the architec
tural plans In consultation with
representatives of the faculty and
campus homeowner groups.
I ) The Faculty Senate voted 2H-4
April 2 to adopt the letter's
proposals In a resolution to the
trustees. Formal Faculty Senate
criticism of a proposed University
building Is unprecedented.
The only other major senate vote
on the library was In 1983 when

the senate voted unanimously
that a campus-based public af
fairs center should fall under the
University's normal academic
governance rules.
The significance of this month's
Faculty Senate vote was Il
lustrated by the appearance of
Board of Trustees President War
ren Christopher, who stressed
that there was "very little
likelihood'' thai the board would
want to reconsider previously
made commitments.
Although the Issue was techni
cally a land-use matter and thus
fell within the trustees' Jurisdic
tion. many faculty members felt
(hat they had not been adequately
consulted on plans for a library In
tended for academic use.
The Faculty Senate Is consid
ered the ultimate authority on the
academic affairs of the University
and the University's day-to-day
operations, and most decisions of

thr srnatr on acadrmic affairs arr
rubbrr-stamprd by the trustees.
Among thr faculty, opposition
to thr library had prrvlously brrn
voiced by only a few members,
most promlnrntly Political Scl
ener Prof. John Mauley and En
glish Prof. Ronald Rehhol/..
Thr suddrn. and tardy, opposi
tion by an overwhelming majority
of the 'Faculty Srnatr scrips to
havr brrn provokrd by a .eallza
tlon that it had brrn edged out of
thr decision-making process.
Rebholz speculated last night
that the resolution was "a
desperation move Inspired by
(former senate chairs) Craig Heller
and David Aberncthy." Abernethy
was the only faculty member on
the Reagan Library Planning
Committee.
Heller said he did not believe the

nection."
Campbell's comments prompted
a unanimous censure (with one
abstention) by the Faculty Senate
in February for contradicting the
"non-partisan rationale offered by
the Board of Trustees for siting
the . . . library on this campus."
The character of the opposition
changed dramatically this month

This rendering of the proposed Reagan Library site in the Stanford foothills sparked protest among many
in the Stanford community. Critics argued that the depiction made the library appear disproportionately
large in relation to the Stanford campus, while library proponents said the depiction was inaccurate and
outdated.
when the Faculty Senate and
lormei senate chairmen threw
their wrlght behind the protest:
I I Twelve former chairmen of the
Faculty Senate wrote a letter to the
senate stating that "the library Is
simply too large and the expected
level ol usage too high for that
(Junlpero Serra) site." The letter
proposed revising the architec
tural plans In consultation with
representatives of the faculty and
campus homeowner groups.
I ) The Faculty Senate voted 2H-4
April 2 to adopt the letter's
proposals In a resolution to the
trustees. Formal Faculty Senate
criticism of a proposed University
building Is unprecedented.
The only other major senate vote
on the library was In 1983 when

the senate voted unanimously
that a campus-based public af
fairs center should fall under the
University's normal academic
governance rules.
The significance of this month's
Faculty Senate vote was Il
lustrated by the appearance of
Board of Trustees President War
ren Christopher, who stressed
that there was "very little
likelihood'' thai the board would
want to reconsider previously
made commitments.
Although the Issue was techni
cally a land-use matter and thus
fell within the trustees' Jurisdic
tion. many faculty members felt
(hat they had not been adequately
consulted on plans for a library In
tended for academic use.
The Faculty Senate Is consid
ered the ultimate authority on the
academic affairs of the University
and the University's day-to-day
operations, and most decisions of

thr srnatr on acadrmic affairs arr
rubbrr-stamprd by the trustees.
Among thr faculty, opposition
to thr library had prrvlously brrn
voiced by only a few members,
most promlnrntly Political Scl
ener Prof. John Mauley and En

Thr suddrn. and tardy, opposi
tion by an overwhelming majority
of the 'Faculty Srnatr scrips to
havr brrn provokrd by a .eallza

thr decision-making process.
Rebholz speculated last night
that the resolution was "a
desperation move Inspired by
(former senate chairs) Craig Heller
and David Aberncthy." Abernethy
was the only faculty member on
the Reagan Library Planning
Committee.
Heller said he did not believe the
impetus for the decision was the
Faculty Senate vote.
