# Protests may have affected relocation

After three years of planning for
a Ronald Reagan Presidential Li
brary, all that remains here are Ir
relevant blueprints and a puzzling
question — Why did the Ronald
Reagan Presidential Foundation
change its mind on a matter that
had been decided in 1984?

News analysis

In Its announcement yesterday,
the foundation cited only the
desirability of having a Reagan
public affairs center adjacent to
the library. The White House, in
1983, had formally offered the li
brary, a museum and a public af
fairs center as a package, with the
center to be administered by the
Hoover Institution.
But in February 1984, the White
House and the University reached
an agreement to separate the
public affairs center from the li
brary and museum following
Stanford's insistence that a
campus-based policy center be
governed by normal University
standards — by the University
provost and not by the Hoover In
stitution.
Although the rationale for
withdrawing the library will not be
known unless members of the
Reagan foundation elaborate, the
decision may have been influ
enced by the continued protest
against the library from members
of the Stanford community.
From the beginning, the rela
tionship between Stanford and
the Reagan foundation has been
tense and often hostile as the Uni
versity endeavored to limit the li
brary to an unadorned scholarly
asset and the foundation pushed
for a memorial to President
Reagan.
The tension stems in part from
continued strain between the Uni
versity and the Hoover Institution
over the institution's alleged poli
tical partisanship. W. Glenn
Campbell, director of Hoover, is
also president of the Reagan foun
dation and Hoover Senior Fellow
Martin Anderson is the founda
tion's secretary.
Campbell exacerbated that ten
sion by writing In the 1986 Hoover
Annual Report that, with the loca
tion of both Hoover and the library
at Stanford, the entire University
could "boast" of Its "Reagan con
nection."
Campbell's comments prompted
a unanimous censure (with one
abstention) by the Faculty Senate
in February for contradicting the
"non-partisan rationale offered by
the Board of Trustees for siting
the . . . library on this campus."
The character of the opposition
changed dramatically this month

This rendering of the proposed Reagan Library site in the Stanford foothills sparked protest among many
in the Stanford community. Critics argued that the depiction made the library appear disproportionately
large in relation to the Stanford campus, while library proponents said the depiction was inaccurate and
outdated.
