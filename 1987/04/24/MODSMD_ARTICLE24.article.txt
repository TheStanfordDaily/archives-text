Lifting two-ton suitcases for strangers, they never
lose their welcoming smiles. They are willing to
laminate meal cards, stuff trash bags and wear the
same red T-shirts for a week straight. Although their
red shirts usually erode and smell by the fifth day, or
ientation volunteers exude Stanford spirit all week
long.
Applications are due today for all those eager to
welcome the new students of fall 1987 to the Farm:
over 500 applicants are expected for the 160 OV
spots.
"There are so many equally qualified people, it's
going to be so hard to choose," said sophomore Joe
Choi. Choi is one of 10 student coordinators who will
be read the OV applications over the next few weeks.
The student coordinators met together recently
and outlined a criteria for model OVs, according to
Frosh Coordinator Laurie Langfitt. "We wanted a
clear Idea of what we were looking for so the selection
would be more fair," Langfitt said.
"The greatest number of OVs come from freshmen;
they still have enthusiasm spilling over and I imag
ine that (this) comes off In the application," Langfitt
added.
Enthusiasm among OVs is the key to the program,
Choi explained. "Stanford Is one of the only univer
, sitles with a student-run orientation. We have a very

unique program and hopefully we'll keep the tradi
tion alive," he said.
The goal Is for new students "to have a good time
but to learn about what Stanford has to offer Intellec
tually," Langfitt said about Orientation '87.
For example, new students can dance to the music
at their dorm parties one night and attend a major
faculty debate the next morning.
There will also be a series of programs to help ac
quaint freshmen with the Univerlsty. "How To Read
a Western Culture Text" is an Orientation program
designed to prepare new students for Stanford's
work load, for example.
Another goal of Orientation '87 is for students to
realize that diversity abounds at Stanford, Langfitt
said. Coordinators will lead committees concentrat
ing on native American, black, Chlcano and other in
terests.
Asian-American Coordinator Jae Choi said he
hoped his commitee would provide an extra cushion
for Asian-Americans' adjustment to Stanford.
"Sometimes they don't know exactly how they'll fit in
and that they'll have a support group here," Choi
said.
An international student committee is a group
new to orientation. Coordinator Lema Ataya, a junior
from Kuwait, will help students adjust to culture
shock in general, as well as to life at Stanford in par
ticular.
Those who have the most difficult time adapting

are usually not students but parents. Orientation
87, therefore, will feature a daylong program espe
cially for Mom and Dad. "I know I had a lot of support
from my parents, and when they're comfortable with
Stanford it's easier," said Kristen Holmes, the coord
inator of parent's orientation.
While new students are parting from parents and
diving into deGuerre pool, OVs will be scrambling
around looking for lost luggage and lost students.
Sophomore Charles Hauck Is faced with the huge
job of transportation coordinator. "I'd just love to get

every one and every thing where they're supposed to
be on time," Hauck said.
Although formal orientation only lasts for five
days, it is a yearlong process for Langfitt and the
other coordinators. They will stay on campus to work
on the orientation programming all summer.
"We'll be sitting in front of the Mac for long hours
this summer," Langfitt said, adding that she
thought that Orientation '87 is well worth her effort.
"I can't think of anything better to do at Stanford
for Stanford," she said.
