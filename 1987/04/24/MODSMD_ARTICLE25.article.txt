## Card has two alive in Ojai 
### KEN STEVENS Senior staff writer 
It would be difficult to claim that anyone could
have a home court advantage at the Pacific 10 Con
ference men's tennis championships. But the way
Stanford's Jeff Tarango plays In Ojai. you might
swear that he's playing In his own backyard.
Tarango. who breezed to the title last year In the
Ojai boy's 18-and-under tournament, took the first
two steps yesterday toward the Pac-10 singles crown.
Teammate Patrick McEnroe, a semifinalist last
season, also advanced to the quarterfinals yesterday.
The first round actually offered more than Tarango
expected. Rich Kepler, a reserve from USC, extended
the Stanford freshman to a first set tiebreaker before
succumbing 7-6, 7-5.
"It wasn't supposed to be a tough match," Tarango
said. "I was just really bad on my concentration. I al
ways have trouble in the first round of tourna
ments."
He had no trouble In the second round, however.
Arizona's lan Aler, a Pac-10 quarterflnallst last year,
was run all over the court by Tarango, who advanced
with a 6-1, 6-4 victory. "I played well, and was ready
for the match," Tarango said.
McEnroe may not have been ready for a pair of
three-set matches, but that's exactly what he got.
USC backup Scott Brownsberger nearly dumped the
Cardinal junior in the first round, narrowly losing 6-
3, 4-6, 7-6.
McEnroe struggled again in the opening set of his
second round match against Arizona State's Ken
Kuperstein. McEnroe rebounded from a first set loss,
however, to post a 4-6, 6-3, 6-4 victory. He will face
UCLA's Brett Greenwood in today's 9 a.m. quarter
finals.
With the exception of the Cardinal's top two
players, the opening day was symbolic of the Stan
ford's season so far. Three players went out in the
first round: Mark Jacobson, Curtis Dunn and Barry
Richards.
Senior Scott Moody advanced to the second round
by virtue of a forfeit by USC's John Carras. Then he
met California ace Steve DeVries. Last year. Moody
upset DeVries in the second round, but he could not
