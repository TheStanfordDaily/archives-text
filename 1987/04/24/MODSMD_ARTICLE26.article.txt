# Tittle, Green lead Cardinal women
## 
### KEN STEVENS Senior staff writer 
OJAI — On a day when the
fortunes of the Stanford women's
tennis team went up and down,
no Individual symbolized the
Cardinal's play better than Lisa
Green.
The freshman from San Jose
rode the proverbial roller coaster
twice yesterday in the first day of
the Pacific 10 Conference
women's singles championships.
Green survived two scares to join
teammate Kay Tittle in this morn
ing's quarterfinals.
The Cardinal saw three players
exit the singles draw yesterday:
senior Stephanie Savides in the
second round, and Cindy
Buchsbaum and Valerie Wilson in
the opening round.
Green gave new meaning to the
term "streak hitter" yesterday.
She came out on fire in the first
round, quickly winning the first
set against Arizona's Jackie
Ranger 6-0.
Just as quickly, however.
Green's shots started finding the
net, and Ranger captured the
second set 6-0. The two fought to
a 4-4 tie in the decisive third set
before Green took the last two
games and the match.
Green didn't make things any
easier for herself in her second
round match against California's
Caroline Scherman. The first six
games were all Scherman as she
breezed through the first set.
Green continued her Jekyll-and-
Hyde performance, however, and
turned around to take the second
and third set, dropping just two
games in each. "She finished up
strong in the third set," Stanford

Coach Frank Brennan said.
Green's 0-6. 6-2. 6-2 victory over
Scherman moved her into a 9 a.m.
quarterfinal today. She will face
Cal's Linda Oechsle, who recorded
an impressive 4-6. 6-3, 7-5 second
round win against Arizona State's
Carol Coparanis.
Tittle took a much easier road to
the quarterfinals. After defeating
USC's Kathy McGarrigle 6-0, 6-3
in the first round, she knocked off
UCLA's Catherine O'Meara 7-5, 6-
3 later in the afternoon.
"1 thought 1 was playing pretty
solidly — nothing spectacular,"
Tittle said, who was a key factor in
the Cardinal's championship run
late last season. "I feel like I'm at
the same point I was last year."
Tittle will be up against stiffer
competition in today's quarter
finals when she meets UCLA's
Jane Thomas at 9 a.m. Thomas,
the tournament's No. 2 seed, beat
Tittle in three sets in their only
previous match this season.
Savides was one of several
players to be upset on the tourna
ment's first day. Though she
struggled to overcome Arizona's
Henriette Knols 7-5, 7-6 in the
morning, Savides could not
survive her sccond round match
with Cal's Alissa Finerman, who
posted a 6-4, 6-4 victory.
"Finerman's a good player,"
Brennan said. "I don't think it was
that much of an upset. I'm not too
concerned. I thought Stephanie
played well."
Buchsbaum almost pulled off an
upset of her own. After winning
the first set 7-6 against Cal's
Sharon Fletcher, Buchsbaum held
four match points in a second set

Stanford junior Kay Tittle advanced to the quarterfinals of the Pacific 10 Conference
championships in Ojai by defeating USC's Kathy McGarrigle 6-0, 6-3, and UCLA's Cath
erine O'Meara 7-5, 6-3. Tittle will face Bruin Jane Thomas today at 9 a.m.
tie-breaker. Fletcher, however,
hung on to win the tie-breaker 11-
9 and then took the third set 6-3.
Wilson was the only Cardinal
player to go down without much of
a fight, losing to Coparanis 6-1, 6-
1.
Stanford also met with a mixed
fate in the Women's Intercollegiate
singles. Senior Leigh Anne
Eldredge, the top seed in the

draw, defaulted her opening
round match because of soreness
in her legs. Eldredge is recovering
from stress fracture injuries.
"I think she just needs a little
more rest between matches,"
Brennan said. "We were just push
ing her too hard."
Sophomore Eleni Rossides, also
mending from stress fracture in
juries, made her return to compet
itive singles a successful one as
she swept Cal Poly-San Luis
Obispo's Chris Chalandra 6-3, 6-3
in the first round of the intercol

legiate singles.
Rossides, who had not played
singles since March 5 of last
season, is the No. 2 seed. "She's
not match tough, but she was
pretty good," Brennan said. "She
fought hard, and she had no
pain."
In addition to the singles quar
terfinals, the Pac-10 doubles will
also get under way today. Savldes
and Patty Fendick, the No. 2 seed,
open at noon, along with Wilson
and Buchsbaum. Tittle and Green
play at 11 a.m.

play at 11 a.m.
OJAI — On a day when the
fortunes of the Stanford women's
tennis team went up and down,
no Individual symbolized the
Cardinal's play better than Lisa
Green.
The freshman from San Jose
rode the proverbial roller coaster
twice yesterday in the first day of
the Pacific 10 Conference
women's singles championships.
Green survived two scares to join
teammate Kay Tittle in this morn
ing's quarterfinals.
The Cardinal saw three players
exit the singles draw yesterday:
senior Stephanie Savides in the
second round, and Cindy
Buchsbaum and Valerie Wilson in
the opening round.
Green gave new meaning to the
term "streak hitter" yesterday.
She came out on fire in the first
round, quickly winning the first
set against Arizona's Jackie
Ranger 6-0.
Just as quickly, however.
Green's shots started finding the
net, and Ranger captured the
second set 6-0. The two fought to
a 4-4 tie in the decisive third set
before Green took the last two
games and the match.
Green didn't make things any
easier for herself in her second
round match against California's
Caroline Scherman. The first six
games were all Scherman as she
breezed through the first set.
Green continued her Jekyll-and-
Hyde performance, however, and
turned around to take the second
and third set, dropping just two
games in each. "She finished up
strong in the third set," Stanford

Coach Frank Brennan said.
Green's 0-6. 6-2. 6-2 victory over
Scherman moved her into a 9 a.m.
quarterfinal today. She will face
Cal's Linda Oechsle, who recorded
an impressive 4-6. 6-3, 7-5 second
round win against Arizona State's
Carol Coparanis.
Tittle took a much easier road to
the quarterfinals. After defeating
USC's Kathy McGarrigle 6-0, 6-3
in the first round, she knocked off
UCLA's Catherine O'Meara 7-5, 6-
3 later in the afternoon.
"1 thought 1 was playing pretty
solidly — nothing spectacular,"
Tittle said, who was a key factor in
the Cardinal's championship run
late last season. "I feel like I'm at
the same point I was last year."
Tittle will be up against stiffer
competition in today's quarter
finals when she meets UCLA's
Jane Thomas at 9 a.m. Thomas,
the tournament's No. 2 seed, beat
Tittle in three sets in their only
previous match this season.
Savides was one of several
players to be upset on the tourna
ment's first day. Though she
struggled to overcome Arizona's
Henriette Knols 7-5, 7-6 in the
morning, Savides could not
survive her sccond round match
with Cal's Alissa Finerman, who
posted a 6-4, 6-4 victory.
"Finerman's a good player,"
Brennan said. "I don't think it was
that much of an upset. I'm not too
concerned. I thought Stephanie
played well."
Buchsbaum almost pulled off an
upset of her own. After winning
the first set 7-6 against Cal's
Sharon Fletcher, Buchsbaum held
four match points in a second set

Stanford junior Kay Tittle advanced to the quarterfinals of the Pacific 10 Conference
championships in Ojai by defeating USC's Kathy McGarrigle 6-0, 6-3, and UCLA's Cath
erine O'Meara 7-5, 6-3. Tittle will face Bruin Jane Thomas today at 9 a.m.
tie-breaker. Fletcher, however,
hung on to win the tie-breaker 11-
9 and then took the third set 6-3.
Wilson was the only Cardinal
player to go down without much of
a fight, losing to Coparanis 6-1, 6-
1.
Stanford also met with a mixed
fate in the Women's Intercollegiate
singles. Senior Leigh Anne
Eldredge, the top seed in the

draw, defaulted her opening
round match because of soreness
in her legs. Eldredge is recovering
from stress fracture injuries.
"I think she just needs a little
more rest between matches,"
Brennan said. "We were just push
ing her too hard."
Sophomore Eleni Rossides, also
mending from stress fracture in
juries, made her return to compet
itive singles a successful one as
she swept Cal Poly-San Luis
Obispo's Chris Chalandra 6-3, 6-3
in the first round of the intercol

legiate singles.
Rossides, who had not played
singles since March 5 of last
season, is the No. 2 seed. "She's
not match tough, but she was
pretty good," Brennan said. "She
fought hard, and she had no
pain."
In addition to the singles quar
terfinals, the Pac-10 doubles will
also get under way today. Savldes
and Patty Fendick, the No. 2 seed,
open at noon, along with Wilson
and Buchsbaum. Tittle and Green
play at 11 a.m.
