# Card nine set to slug it out with Sun Devils
## 
### ROBERT PORTNOY Staff writer 
Over its last four Pacific 10 Southern Division
baseball games, Stanford has scored 35 runs, win
ning two of three last weekend at Arizona and defeat
ing California Monday at Sunken Diamond.
Arizona State, meanwhile, scored a startling 42
runs in three games last weekend at home against
UCLA. The Sun Devils, however, managed only one
win.
Thus one thing is certain as the two teams begin a
three-game Six-Pac series tonight at Packard
Stadium in Tempe, Ariz. â€” plenty of runs will be
scored.
"Arizona State is playing really well. We'll have our
hands full keeping their offense contained. I would
expect it to be high-scoring. The games are always
high-scoring down there," Stanford Coach Mark
Marquess said.
The Cardinal is coming off a 7-5 non-conference
victory over San Jose State Tuesday. Stanford enters
the series ranked fourth in the nation, with a 15-5
conference record, 32-12 overall. Arizona State took
three straight from New Mexico State this week and
has 28-21 record, 10-11 in the conference.
Cardinal pitching will be the key in the series. If
the Stanford staff, arguably the best in the confer
ence, pitches up to its capabilities, a repeat of the
Cardinal's three-game sweep of the Devils at Sunken
Diamond March 27 to 29 is a distinct possibility.
Stanford will throw two of the top pitchers in the
Six-Pac at ASU in juniors Jack McDowell and Lee
Plemel. Plemel, the starting pitcher tonight, has had
key victories in the Cardinal's last two conference se

ries after Stanford fell In the first game to both UCLA
and Arizona. Plemel Is 3-0 with a 3.68 ERA In confer
ence play, 6-4 with a 3.28 ERA overall.
"[Plemel's] last two performances have been so big
coming after first-game losses," Marquess said.
"That's what made those wins so important, to have
Lee pick us up in both cases."
McDowell, after being shelled in his previous two
outings against UCLA and Arizona, rebounded to
toss a six-hit, 6-1 gem agianst the Golden Bears
Monday. It's not certain whether the Cardinal ace, 6-
3 with a 4.88 ERA, will pitch Saturday or Sunday.
Either sophomore Jim Price or senior Rob Was
senaar will throw the other game.
"We're certainly not going to lose confidence in
Jack. He's one of the best pitchers we've had here at
Stanford. You keep throwing Jack McDowell out
there and you're going to win a lot of ballgames,"
Marquess said.
Stanford hitters are led by senior left fielder Ruben
Amaro, who is batting .333; freshman right fielder
Paul Carey, .329 with 8 homers and 33 RBIs; and
sophomore third baseman Ed Sprague, with a team
leading 11 homers and 49 RBIs.
The Sun Devils, the first team to adopt the "we're
just going to score a ton of runs" philosophy that has
been quite popular in the Six-Pac, still can do that
quite well. Entering the New Mexico State series,
ASU was led in hitting by catcher Tim Spear at .361,
with a team-leading 13 doubles and 21 RBIs. First
baseman Tony Mattla, batting .315, was leading the
club in homers with 14 and RBIs with 42.
"We know they're going to score a lot of runs. I
think the thing where they've improved themselves
over the last few years is pitching." Marquess added.

Cardinal hurler Jack McDowell will pitch either Saturday or Sunday against the Arizona State Sun Devils
in Tempe. McDowell is coming off a good performance against San Jose State earlier this week.
