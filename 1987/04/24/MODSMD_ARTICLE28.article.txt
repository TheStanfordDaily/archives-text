# Gerardo, Matzek head for NCAAs
## 
### MARK SMOYER Staff writer 
It's sort of like walking into a
class expecting a short quiz on the
past week's lectures and finding
out that you will be tested on
everything every Stanford profes
sor has said in the past three
years.
Well, that's an exaggeration, but
not a big one. For the past three
weeks Stanford gymnast Chuck
Gerardo has been training for this
weekend's NCAA championships,
to be held at UCLA's Pauley
Pavilion, expecting that he would
compete only on the pommel
horse. Wednesday night. Cardinal
Coach Sadao Hamada informed
Gerardo that he was entered in all
six events as an at-large com
petitlor in the Individual cham
pionships.
While the news Inspired quotes
from Gerardo too profane to print,
it does give the Cardinal's three
representatives a much better
chance to make a big impact in
one of the nation's two most im
portant meets of the year.
Also competing for Stanford, in
a meet that rivals any in the world
for quality of competition and
facilities, will be Mike Matzek and
Scott Schaffer. Matzek will also
compete in the all-around cham
pionships and Schaffer will partic
ipate in the vault.

Matzek. who finished third Indi
vidually at the Pacific 10 Confer
ence championships, is consid
ered to be among the handful of
gymnasts capable of winning the
collegiate individual title, won last
year by Jon Louis, now a Stanford
assistant coach.
Gerardo's status is a little less
sure. Had he been training for all
six events, he too would be among
that handful: with the situation
as it stands now. however, his
chances seem slim. "My compul
sories have been going well."
Gerardo said, "but I'm worried

about optionals."
Gerardo's compulsory-optional
balance is just the opposite of Mat
zek's, who will need a personal
best performance in the rigidly
structured compulsories to win
the collegiate title. At the Pac-10
championships, Matzek was in
first place all-around after the op
tionals. but finished third in the
compulsories by a margin that
dropped him two places to his
final standing.
If anything is going to give Mat
zek a boost in his charge toward
the title, it's the fact that Gerardo

— who, as the first alternate
nationwide, gained his surprise
berth due to a last minute drop
out — will be going through all six
events with him. Minutes before
he knew of Gerardo's good
fortune, Matzek said, "It's going to
be tough because the team's sup
port is always really helpful . . .
this year I'm there on my own."

strange circumstance of spending
four days in Los Angeles for
literally five seconds of gymnas-

night's Individual event cham
pionships, In which case It will be
15 seconds.
"The vault Is such a quick event

that I tend to think about it too
much before competing," Schaffer
said, adding that this problem will
be magnified by the fact that it is
the only event in which he will per
form this weekend. "I have to try
and treat it like just another
meet."
Matzek and Gerardo expect

their main competition to be
UCLA's Tony Pineda. California's
Bob Sundstrom and Oklahoma's
Mike Rice, among many others.
UCLA. Cal State-Fullerton. New
Mexico, Oklahoma. Penn State
