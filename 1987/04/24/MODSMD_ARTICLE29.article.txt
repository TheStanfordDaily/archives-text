# Women gymnasts get recruits
## 
### EVAN TUCHINSKY Staff writer 
Howard Jones had a big hit last year with his
song, "Things Can Only Get Better." Homer Sar
dlna, the head coach of the Stanford women's
gymnastics team, seems to have taken the tune to
heart, accumulating a recruiting class for the
1988 season that may be the best in Stanford his
tory.
"Are we excited? You bet we are." Sardina ex
claimed. "We have good depth. It's outstanding."
Topping the list of recruited athletes is Do
Yamashiro, but don't look for her in next year's
lineup. "She'll be sitting out school next year to
train for the '88 Olympics. She's one of the best

gymnasts in the country, if not the best. She's un
believable."
Another Olympic-class gymnast who will be en
tering Stanford this fall is Denise Villars. The St.
John's High School senior trains with Bela
Karolyi in Houston. Karolyi is the coach who
guided such gymnasts as Nadia Comenici. Mary
Lou Retton and Julianne McNamara to Olympic
medals.
"Villars is very, veiy, very good." Sardina said.
"She is trying out for the (U.S.) World Games team
this spring and summer.
"Her strongest events are bars, beam and floor,"
Sardina said, adding that although Villars' vault
is competitive, "we have to work
on getting her vault better."
The squad will gain a good all
around performer with Julie Dun
hill. Dunhill, a club gymnast from
Aurora, Colo., will not train for the
world championships this sum
mer.
"Our next girl is from right
here," Sardina said of Jennifer
Bloom, a resident of San Mateo, a
senior at Aragon High School and
a participant in Stanford's youth
gymnastics program. "She's the

best high school competitor," Sar
dlna said, noting that Bloom does
not compete for any club.
"Jennifer is an outstanding
gymnast, a super athlete," he
added.
Christy Volastro, a resident of
Pittsfleld, Mass.. rounds out the
Cardinal Class of 1991. Volastro is
a Class I gymnast who competes
for a club in New York.
"She will be a really good gym
nast," according to Sardina.
"She's about 5-foot-4, slender â€” a
good body type.
"This is one of our best recruit
ing classes in terms of depth."
Sardina said. "With Do, it is the
best in terms of quality."

In addition, next season will
mark the collegiate debut of
Marietta Frey, a member of this
year's freshman class who was
injured before she had the oppor
tunity to compete. "We'll have
Marietta back and she's like a
freshman," Sardina said of his
uneven bars ace from Lexington,
Mass.
The coach's joy about next
year's prospects is tempered
somewhat by the graduation of
senior Nanci Goldsmith. "It's sad
to see Nanci go. She had a terrific
year and will be hard to replace.
"Athletes like Denise, Julie and
Jennifer will help to ease the
pain," Sardina added.
