# Faculty reaction to move is mixed
## 
### TODD PIERCE Staff writer 
Stanford faculty voiced both
relief and regret over the Ronald
Reagan Presidential Foundation's
sudden decision to scrap plans for
a Reagan Library in Stanford's
foothills.
Critics of the library expressed
their elation at the move and said
they hoped the University commu
nity could again become more
unified after the divisive library
conflict.
"The University will be disap
pointed, but a lot of people will be
elated," said Political Science Prof.
John Manley. Attributing the
withdrawal of the plan to a "grass
roots effort," he said community
pressure was essential through
out the controversy.
"A lot of people worked hard for
this," Manley said. "There was a
hope to affect the Hoover Institu
tion and the presidential founda
tion, and this strategy seems to

have worked."
Kenneth Arrow, chair of the
Faculty Senate and professor of
economics, said he regretted the
loss of the library as an academic
resource. Arrow stood by the sen
ate's endorsement of a Reagan Li
brary located away from the foot
hills and reduced in size.
Electrical Engineering Prof. An
thony Siegman had been a
prominent opponent of the li
brary's location in the foothills
above Junipero Serra Drive, but
he said he did not consider the
foundation's decision a great vic
tory.
'It wasn't my intention to drive
the library off campus," he said.
"We just felt that the Junipero
Serra site wasn't appropriate"
given the size of the library.
Biology Prof. Craig Heller said:
"Quite frankly, I think this is a
good resolution to the prob
lem. ... I think that we did have a
major problem, and this particu
lar resolution of the problem
avoids It entirely." Last month
Heller and 1 1 other past chairmen
of the Faculty Senate signed a
resolution opposing the proposed
site and size of the library.
Heller said the foundations
decision to relocate the library was
particularly propitious because
the University Board of Trustees
"had given their word and felt
hesitant to go back and re
negotiate the foothills site." Board
of Trustees President Warren
Christopher reaffirmed the trus
tees' commitment as recently as
this month.
The foundation stated In a press
release yesterday that It had
decided to relocate the library be
cause It sought a location where a
public affairs center could be built
adjacent to the library. Several
professors, however, ascribed the
move to other motives.
Mauley said Stanford commu
nity protest had convinced the
foundation to relocate the library.
"The community voice here was
getting more and more Insistent,"
he said.
Samuel Brain, a research asso
ciate at the Stanford Medical
School, said "faculty and students
can be praised" for their efforts.
"The recent (ASSU) referendum
convinced the presidential foun
dation to move It,"he added. "It
proved the faculty, students and
residents didn't want It."
Brain, a founding member of a
residential group that opposed
building the library In the foot
hills. said. "I'd like to think the ef
forts of the faculty, staff and com
munity helped to move It, but If It
didn't, who cares."
Slegman said that he hoped the
opposition of Faculty Senate
members would "not appear as a
political sort of thing," and that he
hoped "the alumni don't view It
thai way."
Mauley and Brain said the li
brary's withdrawal would head off
a divisive split In the Stanford
community.
"It's the best thing that's hap
pened in a while," Brain said.
"We'll be able to gel back to the
real work of a university."
