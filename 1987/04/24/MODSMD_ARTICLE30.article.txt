# Card champs swim once more
## 
### BRENDAN HEALEY Senior staff writer 
While It seems like only yesterday that
Pablo Morales was putting the finishing
touches on his standout career by win
ning the last of his record 11 NCAA indi
vidual titles, the Cardinal senior and his
teammates have been asked to hit the
pool one more time.
Stanford is traveling to Los Angeles for
the Avis Swimming Championships and
will will kick off this weekend's USC
Olympic Pool competition with a 2 p.m.
swim tomorrow against USC, and con
tinue with a possible noon final Sunday
against the winner of the Texas-
California meet.
There was some doubt about whether
Stanford would even participate after
the squad recorded a deadlocked 6-6
vote on the issue, and Stanford Coach

Skip Kenney has reservations about
asking his swimmers to compete so
soon after winning their third con
secutive NCAA championship.
"I would compare it to competing in
the Final Four in basketball, and then
picking four more teams and playing on
a different-sized court," said Kenney of
the event, which will be held in a 25-
meter pool as opposed to the standard
25-yard college pool.
"There's an awful lot of pressure that
built up through the year." Kenney con
tinued. "It's time for our student
athletes to spend some time as students.
You have to have some time to smell the
roses. I'm not in favor of the timing (of
the meet) in the season."
Nonetheless, Kenney added, "We're
going to get fired up when we get down
there. We're going to do all the things
that are necessary. We're going to do it

right."
Stanford's John Witchel shared Ken
ney's determination.
"I see this meet as an excellent oppor
tunity to do really well." he said. "It's an
other opportunity to beat USC, which is
pretty fun."
The championship could well be
decided in the Cardinal's preliminary tiff
with NCAA runner-up USC, which
matches what are probably the two
strongest teams. The Trojans boast a
standout corps of distance freestylers,
paced by Dan Jorgensen and Mike
O'Brien, and Kenney is particularly leery
of USC In its home pool.
"They figure if they can beat Stanford,
it will highlight their season." he said.
They're always good at home. We expect
a real close meet with USC and another
real, real close meet with Texas if we
swim them."
