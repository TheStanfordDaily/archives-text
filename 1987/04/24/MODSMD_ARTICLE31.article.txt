Stanford Track Coach Brooks Johnson
divides his team's season into three dis
tinct parts.
The first section is training. The ob
jective is simply to get the athletes into the
best shape possible. Next comes what
Johnson calls competition. Here the ath
letes try to refine their conditioning into a
competitive edge. The team takes part in a
meet each weekend as the athletes get
tuned up and try to qualify for the NCAA
and Pacific 10 Conference champion
ships.
Finally there comes the championship
part of the season. At this point training
takes a back seat to mental preparation —
each weekend features another big meet

as the team works its way to an NCAA
finale.
According to Johnson. "May starts that
championship season." The Cardinal will
begin that third phase on May 2 with a
home meet against California.
To wind down the competition stage of
the program. Johnson and his troops will
travel to Cal Poly-San Luis Obispo for a
Saturday meet with five other local teams.
As Johnson admits, the competition at
Cal Poly shouldn't be too fierce. The meet,
he said, "is just a low-key prepper for Cal.
A chance for some people to race and keep
their competitive rhythms going."
Although the coaches are not expecting
much more from the meet than some good
practice races, NCAA qualifying times are
always a possibility.
