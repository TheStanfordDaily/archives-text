SAN DIEGO — A hard loss ends
the season of every playoff team
but one. Unfortunately for the
Stanford men's volleyball team,
the Cardinal is not that one. The
Cardinal, competing in the West
ern Regional semifinals last night,
fell to Pepperdine 15-5, 15-6, 15-3
at San Diego State s Peterson
Gym.
Things just never went the
Cardinal s way, as Pepperdine
scored on each of the first three
serves of the match and cruised to
a 57-minute victory. Pepperdine is
now 22-6 overall, while Stanford
finishes the season at 21-12.
"We came out and took It to
them," Pepperdine Coach Rod
Wilde said. "It's hard to get any
momentum when we play that
well. We slowed down Scott

(Fortune) and we stopped Kent
(Steffes) — that's a big part of
their offense."
Tomorrow night, the Waves will
face the winner of the other semi
final between USC and UC-Santa
Barbara.
Pepperdine came out still smart
ing from an upset at the hands of
the Gauchos two weeks ago. and
decided to take it out on Stanford.
The Waves hit .397 as a team and
posted 16 blocks, while the Card
inal was held to a ,103 clip and
only five team blocks.
"They're just an experienced
team and they played well," Stan
ford setter Parker Blackman said.
"They were serving really tough,
which made it hard to develop an
offense."
"They (Stanford) just never
really got a rhythm going," Wilde
said.

Wave All-America Matt Rigg had
11 kills at a .400 pace, as well as a
match-high seven digs; All-
America Rob Scott had 10 kills at
.412 hitting percentage, Randy
Bergstedt hit .538 with nine kills
and former national team member
Troy Tanner also had nine kills,
hitting .353.
For Stanford. Fortune, a junior
middle blocker, had nine kills and
a .200 percentage, freshman Dan
Hanan hit .231 with eight kills
and Robert Peterson came off the
bench to post four kills and a .222
mark.
The blocking statistics told a
similar story, as Hanan's team
high three blocks were surpassed
by four Pepperdine players.
"They blocked really well,"
Blackman said. "We'd finally get a
ball by the block and they'd be
scrambling to pick it up. We just
couldn't get a ball down."
