# Cardinal sails into big weekend regatta
## 
### HUGH R. BETHELL Editorial staff 
Tomorrow morning, on the choppy
waters of San Francisco Bay, the Stanford
sailing team will begin competing in the
regatta that it has been preparing for all
year.
The event Is called the Pacific Coast
Championships, and it is without doubt
the most important regatta of the West
Coast sailing season. By Sunday evening,
the two schools that will represent the
Pacific region in the dinghy racing division
at this year's national sailing champion
ships will be selected from among the 15 to
20 expected entrants.
Needless to say, the Cardinal squad is
gunning for one of the two top spots that
will allow them to compete at the nationals
in King's Point, N.Y., at the end of May.
"The team is very excited about the PCC
regatta," Stanford Coach Blake Middleton
said. "We've been looking forward to it ever

since last year, when we narrowly missed
qualifying for the dinghy nationals. Almost
all the sailors who competed at that regatta
will be competing again this weekend, and
1 think we stand a good chance of qualify
ing this year."
If Stanford does qualify this year, the
team will have survived a brutally testing
regatta. This year's Pacific Coast Champi
onship will be held under a new format,
with twice as many races scheduled during
two days of non-stop racing. The new for
mat — and the Bay's rough waves and
wind — will present a challenge to all the
teams. For the Cardinal, the regatta offers
the opportunity to prove its strength.
"Our biggest assets are our depth and
our experience in these conditions. If we
put those strengths to work. I think we can
show that we're the best team on the West
Coast." said sophomore sailing team mem
ber Amy Balzer.
