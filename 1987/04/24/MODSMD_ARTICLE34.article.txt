# Longhorns, Cardinal square off at Avis Invitational in L.A.

### BRENDAN HEALEY Senior staff writer 
Like two gunflghters ambling
into the O.K. Corral, Stanford and
Texas are edging toward a high
noon showdown in the Sunday
finals of this weekend's Avis
Swimming Championships at the
USC Olympic Pool.
The two teams are the hottest
guns in the women's collegiate
swimming world, and although
the meet is billed as bringing to
gether the top four women's
squads in the nation, the competi
tion boils down to the Longhorns
and Cardinal.
"Anytime we swim Stanford, it's
a big meet," Texas Coach Richard
Quick said. "It should be a good
meet if we get that far (to the
finals), and I'm sure we will."
To do so, the Longhorns must
first dispose of USC tomorrow in a
noon matchup, which immedi
ately follows the 10 a.m. Stanford-
UCLA meet. Neither NCAA cham
pion Texas nor runner-up Stan
ford is expected to be challenged
by the Trojans or Bruins, who
finished eighth and 15th
respectively at last month's na
tional championships.
If Stanford and Texas do meet in
the finals, it will be the squads'
third tussle of the season. The
Longhorns easily swam away with
the dual meet in Austin, Tex., 92-
48, but had to withstand a fierce

Cardinal comeback to eke out a
638.5-621.5 win at NCAAs.
The Avis meet Is held roughly a
month after the theoretical end of
the college season, and due to Its
unique nature there are several
extra rules that could work to the
Cardinal's advantage.
The meet Is swum with an ab
breviated schedule of events that
emphasizes the sprints, and the
Cardinal will look to Jenna
Johnson, the NCAA champion in
both the 50- and 100-yard
freestyles, and Aimee Berzins, the
NCAA 100 freestyle runner-up.
Each team is also limited to 12
swimmers, which should nullify
Texas' tremendous depth to some
degree.
"It should (help)," Stanford
backstroker Michelle Donahue
said of the squad limit. "We prob
ably lost (the) NCAAs because we
didn't have as many swims."
Stanford Coach George Haines'
contingent, however, will likely be
at less than full strength as three
All-Americas and the Cardinal's
top diver are expected to miss the
trip.
Haines reported that Monica
Nielebeck is staying home due to
academic commitments and
Susannah Miller is out with a dis
located kneecap. Jill Johnson and
diver Katie Connors may also miss
the meet because of eligibility
problems arising from their par
ticipation in the recent U.S.

championships.
Those who do compete are ex
pected to record relatively fast
times as they are still feeling the
residual effects of their pre-NCAA
conditioning.
"I'd say they'll be somehwere be
tween Pac-lOs and NCAAs,"
Haines said of his squad's perfor
mance level. "We worked pretty
hard for three weeks. Now we're in
the fourth week, and we're going
to rest some."
Of course, the incentive of
swimming against the Long
horns, who boast NCAA three
event champion and Swimmer of
the Meet, Betsy Mitchell, should
also bring out the best in the
Cardinal.
"We're taking it pretty seri
ously," Donahue said. "There's al
ways that little vengeance. 1 think
we're approaching it with a good
attitude."
In other news from deGuerre
Pool, the winners of the team
awards were announced at last
Friday's team banquet.
Susan Rapp was named the
squad's MVP. Co-captain Rapp
won the 200 breaststroke at the
NCAAs and finished second in
both the 100 breaststroke and
200 individual medley.
Winning the Dolphin Award for
"taking the most guff," as Haines
said, was Donahue, while Berzins
was tabbed Most Improved.
