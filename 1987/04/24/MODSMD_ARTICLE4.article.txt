# Kennedy criticizes Western Culture debate
## 
### MARK ROGOWSKY 
University President Donald Kennedy
issued a letter yesterday criticizing the way
the debate over the Western Culture Task
Force report has been waged during the
past two weeks.
"The conduct of a discussion like this one
in the newspaper instead of in a dialogue
with the proposers constitutes an irresist
ible temptation to hyperbole," Kennedy
said.
He said "an appropriate response (to the
task force draft) would be for those con
cerned about the outcome to . . . construct
thoughtful and persuasive communica
tions designed to change the task force's
mind. Instead a number of them have

preferred to draw and fire. "
Kennedy called recent responses
"unfortunate" because the task force's draft
"deserves more careful consideration" and
because "it is discouraging to minority stu
dents. who may find in the rhetorical vigor
and the haste of these reactions a message
that their concerns are to be dismissed with
a prompt and heavy hand."
Kennedy's comments drew mixed
reviews. History Prof. Paul Seaver, chair
man of the task force, agreed that some
responses to the draft proposal were less
than helpful. "What we needed were careful
responses based on careful reading (of the
report)," he said. "Many colleagues didn't
understand what it actually said."
Classics Prof. Marsh McCall, chairman of

the Committee on Undergraduate Studies
(CUS), said the task force wants as much
feedback as possible before coming out with
a final report and he "wouldn't agree with
the apparent suggestion that at least some
number of those who have responded
haven't read the report carefully."
"Certainly CUS has done precisely what
the president seems to be calling on the
community to do," McCall said.
Disputing at least part of Kennedy's state
ment, Dean of Undergraduate Studies
Carolyn Lougee said she believes the
deliberative process "has worked well."
Although Lougee said she supports Ken
nedy's views about "giving thoughtful
responses to the task force," she said that
the issue "doesn't lend itself to quiet

response" because of the emotional nature
of the subject.
Lougee said that the early stage of the
debate was flawed with excessive
negativism, but that "the debate has
become fuller and more useful."
Both McCall and Seaver agreed that the
task force's decision to release the draft
report was appropriate.
"We need to hear from as many people in
the community as possible," Seaver said.
McCall added that "any time something
that's basic to the Stanford community is
being discussed all stages are public."
Seaver said he hopes that the debate will
now center on "what the legislation actually
proposes as opposed to (the critics') own
fears."
