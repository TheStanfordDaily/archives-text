# Drell, Zare group questions SDI feasibility

### CLINT HIGHFILL Staff writer With wire reports 
Challenging Reagan adminis
tration assumptions about "Star
Wars," a group of America's top
scientists said yesterday that at
least a decade of research is
needed to determine whether
high-energy lasers and particle
beams can be used to knock down
enemy missiles in space.
Stanford Chemistry Prof. Rich
ard Zare was on the 17-member
panel of the American Physical So
ciety that released the report. Sid
ney Drell. deputy director of the
Stanford Linear Accelerator Cen
ter (SLAC). was society president
when the study was commis
sioned in 1986.
"The point of this report," Drell
said, "is how far does one have to
go . . . from what is known today
to what is needed to meet military
needs?"
The 422-page technical study of
Reagan's Strategic Defense Initia

tive (SDI) was reviewed by a six
man committee that included
former SLAC director Wolfgang
Panofsky, Nobel laureate Arthur
Schawlow of the Stanford Physics
Department and Nobel laureate
Charles Townes of UC-Berkeley. It
was headed by L. Charles Hebel,
emeritus vice president of re
search at Xerox Corp. in Palo Alto.
The study delivered the shar
pest scientific challenge yet to ad
ministration plans to deploy
space- and ground-based ballistic
missile defenses as early as 1994.
But Drell, calling the study a
"technical primer," said It is "not
a recommendation yes or no on
SDL"
Kumar Patel, co-chairman of
the study group and a physicist at
AT&T Bell Laboratories, said: "On
purely scientific and engineering
criteria, one would not make a
decision on early deployment. But
In the International arena, there
are other forces."
Another author. Jeremiah Sul
livan of the University of Illinois-

Urbana. said deployment in the
early or mid-1990s would be "a
gamble."
"Even in the- best of circum
stances. a decade or more of inten
sive research would be required
just to provide the technical
knowledge needed for an Informed
decision about the potential effec
tiveness and survivability" of
lasers and other "directed energy
weapons," the report said.
A Pentagon critique said the
report's conclusions were
"subjective and unduly pessimis
tic about our capability to bring to
fruition the specific technologies
needed for a full-scale develop
ment decision in the 19905."
But Patel and others rejected
that view at a news conference.
"In spite of the progress that
has been made, a substantial
amount of research remains to be
done before an informed judg
ment can be made about the effec
tiveness and the reliability and
survivability of such weapons if

and when they are deployed."
Patel said.
The Pentagon's Strategic
Defense Initiative Organization,
which directs SDI research, said
in a statement that recent
breakthroughs have brought

some high-energy devices closer to
the weapons stage.
The report played an immediate
role in congressional debate on
President Reagan's request to
spend $5.8 billion next year on
Star Wars.
Members of a Senate appropra
tions subcommittee raised it in a
closed session yesterday with the
head of the SDI Office, Air Force
Lt. Gen. James Abrahamson, said
one congressional source, who
declined to be identified.
The authors of the report,
"many of whom have Important
roles in developing those technolo
gies," received classified briefings
from Defense Department offi
cials, Patel said.
Patel's co-chairman on the
study group was Harvard Univer
sity physicist Nicolaas Bloember
gen, who was awarded a Nobel
Prize in 1981 for his work on
lasers.
Their report concluded that the
