U.S./Soviet arms talks resume
GENEVA — The U.S./Soviet arms-control talks resumed here
Thursday, and the chief Soviet negotiator predicted a treaty to
limit nuclear missiles this year.
Alexei Obukhov, questioned by reporters as he greeted U.S.
negotiator Maynard Glitman at the Soviet mission here,
declared, "We expect to have a treaty this year."
And Glitman said, "We expect to have a good treaty."
The optimism of the arms-control experts raised hopes that
negotiators will agree on a reduction In intermediate-range nu
clear missiles based In Europe.
In Washington, President Reagan greeted the resumption of the
talks with optimism. However, he stressed the concerns of the At
lantic alliance that the removal from Europe of all nuclear weap
ons except for battlefield-scale ones could leave the allies vulner
able to the Warsaw Pact's superior conventional forces.
And Secretary of State George Shultz, assuring the NATO allies
that the United States has an "awesome" and flexible nuclear arse
nal, said the allies "shouldn't be afraid to take yes for an answer to
our own proposal" for missile reductions.
Economy growth exceeds forecast
WASHINGTON — The nation's economy expanded at an annual
rate of 4.3 percent during the first three months of the year, far
exceeding most expectations in and out of government, the De
partment of Commerce reported yesterday.
But economists downplayed the strength of the report because
much of it reflected a huge buildup of unsold inventories, while
actual sales fell for the first time in a year.
The pattern led some economists to warn that the massive in
ventories, undercutting the need for substantial new production,
could result in slow growth during the current quarter, continu
ing the seesaw pattern of the past year.
Analysts did agree that the continued improvement in the trade
balance represented good news. The trade deficit decreased at an
annual rate of *13.8 billion in inflation-adjusted dollars.
While some analysts feared slower growth ahead, others said
that the inventory buildup and the decline in spending may
merely be a compensation for the year-end 1986 buying spree
spurred by the new tax law. The law, which went into effect Jan.
1, eliminated the federal deduction for state and local sales taxes.
Sri Lanka strife continues
COLOMBO, Sri Lanka — Hundreds of Tamils were reported
fleeing areas of heavy government air strikes in the Jaffna Penin
sula yesterday as the strikes continued for the second day in the
predominantly Tamil north of the country.
Tamil leaders in Colombo expressed fears that violence could
engulf the Sri Lankan capital as demonstrators tried to storm the
city morgue and militant Buddhist monks demanded the resigna
tion of President Junius Jayewardene.
Government officials said the air strikes were in response to
Tuesday's bus station bombing in Colombo. Police yestersday
lowered their original estimate of the number of people killed in
that attack from 150 to 106.
The government has said Tamil militants were responsible for
the bombing and that their bases in the north would be targeted
as long as they struck at civilian targets in the south. The Tamil
rebel groups have denied responsibility for the bombing.
The recent attacks on civilian targets by both sides in Sri
Lanka's civil strife has killed more than 400 people in the last
week and has brought tensions between the country's
predominantly Buddhist Sinhalese majority and predominantly
Hindu Tamil minority to a new intensity.
Soviet claim releases insufficient
MOSCOW — A group of former political prisoners, freed over the
last three months, said yesterday the releases have stopped and
conditions for those still in camps and prisons remain un
changed.
The three-page statement, signed simply by "a group of former
political prisoners," expressed disappointment at the pace and
depth of Communist Party leader Mikhail Gorbachev's program of
democratization.
"As long as even one political prisoner stays in a camp, all talk of
restructuring, of democratization, of openness — all this talk
means nothing, it is all empty," the statement said.
According to the prisoners' unofficial lists, 127 political
prisoners were freed this year by special orders of the Presidium of
the Supreme Soviet. In February. Soviet officials said 140
prisoners were being released, and the same number of cases was
under review.

downtown shopping centers Thursday, killing at least two people
and wounding 11, authorities said.

supermarket, but one gunman was later taken into custody, said
Palm Bay Police spokeswoman Louise Brown. She did not know
the details of his arrest.

were stationed on rooftops, according to witnesses. Hundreds of
shoppers were evacuated from the area and many others were
lying on the ground, but in the confusion and panic it was not im
mediately clear how many had been shot.

Ms. Brown.

the shootings and treated 11 others for gunshot wounds, accord
ing to spokeswoman Mary Lu Tombleson.
Boesky pleads guilty
NEW YORK — Former stock speculator Ivan Boesky pleaded
guilty in federal court Thursday to taking part in a conspiracy to
rig stock purchases during a takeover raid against Fischbach
Corp.
Other participants in the conspiracy were not named in court,
but sources familiar with the case said corporate raider Victor
Posner and the investment banking firm of Drexel Burnham Lam
bert Inc. were involved.
Posner could not be reached for comment, but a spokeswoman
said, "No individual in our company or any of our companies has
been charged or accused of anything. Therefore, we have nothing
to say regarding Mr. Boesky's plea."
"We know of no arrangements of the type described regarding
Boesky's Fischbach shares." a Drexel spokesman said.
Thursday's disclosures made clear that the government's inves
tigation of corruption on Wall Street is headed in an important
new direction, focusing not only on illegal Insider stock trading
but also on improper collusion among corporate raiders. Invest
ment bankers and professional stock traders during hostile cor
porate takeovers.
