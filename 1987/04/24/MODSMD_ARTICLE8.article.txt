# Rudman criticizes scandal counsel

### 
WASHINGTON - Sen. Warren Rudman. R-
N.H., vice chairman of the Senate panel on the
Iran-contra affair, said yesterday that Indepen
dent Counsel Lawrence Walsh appears to be
pursuing a fruitless prosecution strategy and
chided Walsh for making demands that are
slowing congressional attempts to unravel the
full story.
Rudman said that Congress has an overrid
ing responsiblity to tell the American people
what happened as quickly as possible and that
the truth is more likely to come out through
congressslonal hearings than from any crimi
nal prosecutions brought by Walsh.
"There are too many important issues facing
the country for the American people to wait
while (Walsh's) investigation goes on ad
nauseum," Rudman said.
He said congressional investigators have
reviewed reams of documents. Interviewed
scores of witnesses and essentially have uncov
ered much of what happened. However, Rud
man said, key questions about the involve
ment of high-level officials, including Presi
dent Reagan, could not be answered without
the testimony of two witnesses, fired National
Security aide Lt. Col. Oliver North and former
National Security Adviser John Poindexter.
Congressional investigators will begin ques
tioning Poindexter next month after promis
ing to grant limited immunity that would
prevent his testimony being used against him.

and North will be examined in June under an
agreement worked out with Walsh.
"I'm not being critical of (Walsh)." Rudman
said. "I'm simply saying the train is leaving the
station. . . . We're ready to roll and Judge
Walsh has to understand that." Joint House
and Senate public hearings on the Iran-contra
affair will begin in less than two weeks.
Rudman's comments, which came in a
luncheon meeting with Washington Post
editors and reporters and in a later telephone
Interview, came a day after Walsh urged the
House Iran-contra committee not to grant im
munity to former CIA officer Thomas Clines.
Walsh also told reporters that his criminal in
quiry is being increasingly crimped by con
gressional attempts to grant limited immunity
from prosecution to figures in the Iran-contra
affair.
In a telephone interview yesterday, Walsh
said his request to the House committee on
Clines "had nothing to do with delay.
"I was asking that a particular person not be
given immunity at all," Walsh said. Walsh said
he believes other witnesses should be able to
supply the same information the committee
expects to get from Clines and that Clines is
not someone "to whom prosecution should be
quickly surrendered."
Once witnesses testify before the House and
Senate committees under immunity grants,
no information derived from what they say, in

public or In private sessions, may be used
against them In court unless they perjure
themselves. Walsh has repeatedly said that In
dependent evidence must be developed before
prosecutors and congressional Investigators
will know If what they are told by Immunized
witnesses Is really the truth.
"My underlying presentation (Wednesday)
was that the Illusion that Immunity can be
granted without damage to prosecution Is no
more than an Illusion," Walsh said.
Walsh In an Interview last month said that
he recognized that Congress has a responsibil
ity to move quickly but that while he and the
congressional committees have separate roles
they both share the same primary goal: "to find
the truth."
Walsh is known to be pursuing his Investiga
tion on the premise that a conspiracy to
defraud the government — perhaps two con
spiracies — took place In the course of the
Reagan administration's secret arms sales to
Iran and the related financing of the
Nicaraguan contras.
Rudman, a lawyer and former state attorney
general for New Hampshire, said he has con
cluded that the only significant crime likely to
arise from the Iran-contra affair is the charge
of obstruction of justice, which is In part
related to allegations that White House docu
ments were shredded or altered.
