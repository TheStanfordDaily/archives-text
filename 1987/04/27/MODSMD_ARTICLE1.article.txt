# Student drowns in lake
## Last spotted at Boathouse Rush party 
### MARK LAWRENCE Senior staff writer 
The body of 20-year-old junior David
Dunshee was recovered Friday from
Lagunita, more than two days after he
was last seen leaving a Zeta Psi Rush
party at the Boathouse.
The Santa Clara County Coroner's Of
fice concluded after performing an
autopsy Saturday that Dunshee died
from drowning.
A student who attended the party,
sophomore Phil Klein, said Friday that
Dunshee left the party at about 1 a.m.
after telling friends that he was going
home. Stanford Police Chief Marvin Her
rlngton speculated that Dunshee might
have stumbled into the lake and
drowned because he was disoriented
from drinking.
Results of blood tests taken by the
coroner's office to determine whether al
cohol was involved will not be available
for at least two weeks, according to Dep
uty Coroner Charles Newman.
Norm Robinson, acting dean of Stu
dent Affairs, said yesterday that the Uni
versity will organize an investigation to
morrow and will have a final report
sometime next week.
Klein, who said he was one of only two
other students remaining at the party
when Dunshee left, refused to comment
further until after he and others who at
tended the party make reports to the
police today. The other student who saw

Dunshee leave, Zete President Neil Han
son, traveled Saturday to Eugene. Ore.,
Dunshee's hometown, to visit Dun
shee's family and was unavailable for
comment.
Herrlngton said Dunshee's roommate
reported him missing at around 8 p.m.
Thursday. Police conducted a search of
the area around the lake Thursday
night.
After an unsuccessful daylight search
of the shore area Friday morning, police
called in a diving team and a California

Highway Patrol helicopter to assist in
searching the water.
At 4 p.m., after about 30 minutes of
circling the lake, the helicopter crew
spotted the body underwater between 20
and 30 feet offshore. Herrington said.
The diving team then used a boat to pull
the body onto the bank.
Herrington said police in Eugene,
Ore., contacted Dunshee's family
Friday.
