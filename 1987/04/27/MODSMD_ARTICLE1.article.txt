# Student drowns in lake
## Last spotted at Boathouse Rush party 
### MARK LAWRENCE Senior staff writer 
The body of 20-year-old junior David
Dunshee was recovered Friday from
Lagunita, more than two days after he
was last seen leaving a Zeta Psi Rush
party at the Boathouse.
The Santa Clara County Coroner's Of
fice concluded after performing an
autopsy Saturday that Dunshee died
from drowning.
A student who attended the party,
sophomore Phil Klein, said Friday that
Dunshee left the party at about 1 a.m.
after telling friends that he was going
home. Stanford Police Chief Marvin Her
rlngton speculated that Dunshee might
have stumbled into the lake and
drowned because he was disoriented
from drinking.
Results of blood tests taken by the
coroner's office to determine whether al
cohol was involved will not be available
for at least two weeks, according to Dep
uty Coroner Charles Newman.
Norm Robinson, acting dean of Stu
dent Affairs, said yesterday that the Uni
versity will organize an investigation to
morrow and will have a final report
sometime next week.
Klein, who said he was one of only two
other students remaining at the party
when Dunshee left, refused to comment
further until after he and others who at
tended the party make reports to the
police today. The other student who saw

Dunshee leave, Zete President Neil Han
son, traveled Saturday to Eugene. Ore.,
Dunshee's hometown, to visit Dun
shee's family and was unavailable for
comment.
Herrlngton said Dunshee's roommate
reported him missing at around 8 p.m.
Thursday. Police conducted a search of
the area around the lake Thursday
night.
After an unsuccessful daylight search
of the shore area Friday morning, police
called in a diving team and a California

Highway Patrol helicopter to assist in
searching the water.
At 4 p.m., after about 30 minutes of
circling the lake, the helicopter crew
spotted the body underwater between 20
and 30 feet offshore. Herrington said.
The diving team then used a boat to pull
the body onto the bank.
Herrington said police in Eugene,
Ore., contacted Dunshee's family
Friday.

With the help of a California Highway Patrol helicopter, a Santa Clara County Sheriffs
diving team recovered the body of junior David Dunshee in Lagunita on Friday. Dun
shee had been missing since late Tuesday night
Students who lived in Dun
shee's freshman dormitory,
Madera, will hold a memorial ser
vice at 6 p.m. Wednesday near the
Dish.
Dunshee. an anthropology
major, had an "exceptional inter
est" in archeology, said senior
Stewart Patrick, who traveled with
Dunshee and six other students
on an archeological expedition to
Peru last summer. "He was jovial,
wonderful, always cracking
jokes." Patrick said.
A member of the Stanford rugby
team for one year. Dunshee was
noted for his Involvement In intra
mural sports.
Dunshee was one of three chair
men of Rush activities held this

year by the Zetes, a fraternity that
has been In and out of trouble
with the University for the last six
years.
The Zetes lost their campus
house In 1981 after fraternity
members threw a Mills College
woman Into a cement pond near
their house. Later that year, two
Zete pledges were found with their
hands and feet bound In a pad
dock near the Stanford horse sta
ble.
The night after the fraternity's
suspension was announced, van
dals ransacked the Residential
Education office, and University
officials suspected that Zete mem
bers were involved.
The fraternity recently regained
University recognition, which
allows members to meet on
campus. Zete members said that
despite the sanctions, they have

held Ruob every year.
Because of rowdy fraternity par
ties last spring, Including one
during which a freshman was crit
ically Injured in a fight, the Inter
fraternity Council adopted new
Rush policies for this year.
Fraternities were allowed to
serve only beer and wine during
the first week of Rush, beginning
April 12. and no alcohol was per
mitted during the next week. Last
week, however, there were no re
strictions.
There have been at least three
drownings in Lagunita. In 1980. a
26-year-old worker at the Stanford
Research Institute drowned while
swimming after drinking on the
shore. In 1969. a 19-year-old SRI
worker drowned when his boat
overturned, and in 1943, a fresh
man drowned in a boating acci
dent.
