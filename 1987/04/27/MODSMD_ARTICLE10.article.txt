After three-and-a-half years of debate, the
Reagan Library controversy finally has been
put to rest. The Ronald Reagan Library
Foundation has chosen to locate the library
elsewhere, and the Stanford community is
better off for it.
As the planning process progressed, it
became clear that the Hoover Institution was
exercising far too much control over the
process — and the University itself. Stan
ford's non-partisan standing, already in
question because of the presence of Hoover,
was further jeopardized when Hoover Direc
tor W. Glenn Campbell proudly wrote in the
institution's annual report that the entire
University would soon be able to "boast" of a
"Reagan connection."
In addition, questions arose about the size
and location of the library. The proposal
called for a structure that would have been so
large as to dominate the foothills of the
campus, and the landscape would have been
forever changed for the worse by the pres
ence of the library.
These problems were further compounded
by the fact that the Reagan Library would
have become a tourist attraction, as have all
other presidential libraries. No plans were
made to handle the tens of thousands of ad
ditional visitors who would come to Stanford
each year just to see the Reagan Library.
Perhaps this lack of planning stems from
the fact that the foundation and its Hoover

cohorts continued to peddle the myth that
the library would primarily be visited by the
few hundred scholars that would come each
year to do research. They made little of the
fact that the 20-acre library site would serve
as a monument to Ronald Reagan and his
presidency, a fact that invoked much ire as it
became more widely known.
In recent months, it became quite obvious
that there was opposition to the library on
many fronts. Area residents signed a petition
opposing the site, the Faculty Senate called
on the University Board of Trustees to scale
down the proposal or move it farther from
the center of campus and a student referen
dum overwhelmingly endorsed the relocation
of the libraiy.
The foundation claims that the relocation
was due to a desire that a public affairs cen
ter affiliated with the library be located adja
cent to the library — a request denied by the
University long ago. It is likely, though, that
the foundation was tired of all the protests
and their detrimental effects on Reagan's
already tarnished reputation.
The absence of the library will improve
Stanford's image. Now, the rest of the
country might begin to realize that Stanford
is not actively pushing a conservative
agenda, but is a university at which open
ness to new ideas and the cultivation of a
lively intellectual environment are
paramount.
