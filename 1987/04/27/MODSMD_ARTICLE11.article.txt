# Fun Friday: A new holiday?
## 
### 
This column is not just about daylight
saving time — it is about our national attitude.
America is accused of losing its competitive
edge. We plod along with bureaucratic solu
tions and forget about the Yankee ingenuity
that took us from colony to superpower.
Politicians preach about new ideas but rarely
come up with any. My fellow Americans, 1 am
here to offer a novel concept that will return
Uncle Sam to the forefront of world leadership.
I call it Fun Friday.

A timely column on daylight-saving time
should appear at the end of April when we
traditionally turn our clocks forward, should it
not? Not this year, apparently, since the clocks
got turned forward at the beginning of April,
for some unexplained reason. Some contend
that merchants lobbied for the earlier extra
daylight to improve business. If so, they are
thinking too small. They have obviously not yet
heard about Fun Friday.
Daylight-saving time has become an Ameri
can institution — a way of life. An extra hour of
daylight is preserved during the summer
months which conserves energy, makes rush
hour safer and provides greater leisure oppor
tunity during the waking hours. The concept
is brilliant but the implementation has
sucked. Every kindergarten student can tell
you when Christmas and the Fourth of July oc
cur. Most people can correctly identify Hallo
ween and Thanksgiving. Groundhog Day and
Veteran's Day (a holiday that the Stanford
community seems to ignore) are a bit more
obscure. Easter admittedly can get a bit tricky.
But nobody knows for certain when we turn
the clocks back and forth. It is hard enough to
remember which direction to turn them. Fun
Friday will change all that.
The current system works well in autumn,
when the clock is turned back. To reduce con
fusion, the one-hour adjustment is made at 2
a.m. on a Sunday morning and most people
sleep through it. The entire nation is treated to

an extra hour of sleep and the only penalty for
not remembering is to arrive an hour early for
whatever Sunday morning activity happens to
be scheduled.
Some unenlightened, unimaginative bu
reaucrat who showed up for work to collect her
paycheck declared that the reverse procedure
should work in the spring. (Notice how I am in
cluding both genders in my column now. Stan
ford has made me more sensitive and aware.)
As a result, we all turn our clocks forward one
hour at 2 a.m. on some unspecified Sunday in
the spring because it is the obvious thing to
do. No other legislative act denies 200 million
people that supreme expression of life, liberty
and the pursuit of happiness — a hard-earned
hour of sleep. It is the ultimate form of govern
ment oppression.
Furthermore, the penalty for forgetting is se
vere. Honest citizens forfeit Softball games,
miss church or lose tee times because they for
got to set the clock forward. Every spring,
somebody misses her favorite television evan
gelist or political pundit. Some people live for
George Will and Sam Donaldson trading barbs
on a Sunday morning. It just isn't fair.
Fun Friday is the solution. Congress should
choose an appropriate Friday afternoon in
April and designate it Fun Friday. At 3 p.m. on
Fun Friday, all clocks would be turned forward
one hour to 4 p.m. and everyone would be
allowed to go home an hour early. The govern
ment would be compensating rather than
punishing citizens for the inconvenience it
imposes. It would add variety to an otherwise
dull month. (Although between the Moscow
Marines, Jim Bakker, Fawn Hall, Baby M and
Playboy's Vanna White, this April has been
anything but dull. It just really seems sad,
though, that John Hinckley didn't get home
for Easter dinner — but I digress.)
Advertising Fun Friday would be easy, as
merchants would fill the newspapers and tele
vision screens with Fun Friday happy hour
specials and once-in-a-lifetime Fun Friday
sales. Restaurants, bars and massage parlors
would offer two-for-one specials to make up for
the hour that got away. The airwaves would be
saturated with Fun Friday messages to ensure
nobody forgot to turn the clock forward. Fun
Friday office parties would monitor the
countdown from Times Square.
Spring is a giddy season that celebrates the

end of a long winter (three straight days of rain
in Palo Alto). Birds sing, young men fall in love
and the California hills catch fire. Yet we have
no holiday or festivity that adequately
celebrates the arrival of spring. It was hard
enough getting a holiday for Martin Luther
King Jr.; I doubt the lawmakers would give us
one to honor springtime. A holiday costs mil
lions in lost revenue.
For the solution, we have to return to child
hood. When does spring start in the mind of a
little kid? It is not March 21, the vernal equi
nox. There is still snow on the ground. Easter
is a religious holiday that just happens to oc
cur in spring. For a little kid. the first real day
of spring is daylight-saving time day. That is
the first day it is light enough to go out and
play after dinner. For Stanford students,
spring starts when you no longer have to ride
your bike home in the dark. In other words.
Fun Friday is the true beginning of spring and
should be treated as such.
Fun Friday is a holiday that the nation does
not have to pay for. Rather than a day off. it is
an hour off on a day when the general popula
tion can rest on the following day. The hour
lost is the final hour on a Friday afternoon —
in general, the least productive hour of the
week. The boost in employee morale and in
creased holiday revenue should more than
compensate for the hour lost.
Some industries, such as the airlines, may
object, but with a little effort, they too should
be able to devise some clever solutions. Two
years ago, Amtrak's solution for autumn
daylight-saving time was to stop all trains on
the tracks and wait an hour for the clock to
catch up. If that is the best we can do, we
deserve to get our butts kicked by the
Japanese.
New customs and rituals grow up around
holidays. The Fun Friday beagle would bring
candy to small children the instant the clock
changes. Any woman fortunate enough to be
kissing an engineer as the clock moves from 3
to 4 p.m. would have good luck for the rest of
the year. It could be the big break that en
gineers have been waiting for. Songs, legends
and folklore would evolve around the mystical,
magical, mysterious "hour that never was."
People would no longer have to remember
"spring ahead, fall behind." Fun Friday would
occur only once a year. It's time for America to
break out of her shell and do something wild
and crazy. As the American lifestyle intensifies
and we approach our existence with increased
seriousness and efficiency, Fun Friday is ne
cessary for preservation of our national sanity.
Telegraph the president. Call you congress
man. Write The Daily. We want Fun Friday!
