CIR should
have student
participants
I am disappointed to learn that
John van Loben Sels has resigned
from the Committee on Invest
ment Responsibility and am sorry
the ASSU Senate endorsed his
proposal against appointing fu
ture CIR student representatives.
I understand van Loben Sels's
frustrations; It can be disappoint
ing to have one's views overridden
by the majority, or to have one's
committee decisions overridden
by a higher authority. However,
we should not withdraw from a
democratic process just because

we do not always get our way.
The ASSU Senate has boycotted
the CIR before. When the CIR was
created, nearly a decade ago. the
senate declined to appoint stu
dent representatives. So the first
student representatives were
appointed from about a dozen
students who had been randomly
selected by Dean of Student Af
fairs James Lyons.
It Is clearly Inappropriate for
students to set University Invest
ment policy, but It Is desirable for
students to study and Influence
that policy. The CIR Is. on the
whole, a good forum for that, but
the Board of Trustees must work
harder to assure student mem
bers that their participation Is
effective.
