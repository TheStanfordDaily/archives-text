# Diversity needed

Until recently, we were fairly
sure that the Western Culture re
quirement was in need of reform.
After reading Adam Lieberman's
letter (Daily, April 21), we are now
thoroughly convinced.

CHEN, ET AL

The mere existence of view
points such as Lieberman's make
it obvious that the University
needs a program with wider vi
sion. So long as his type of eth
nocentricity returns to haunt us,
we should all be on our alert.
Let's take a look at his letter:
He writes, "Africa has no Dante,
Latin America no Homer." First of
all, as we learned in Western Cul
ture, the existence of Homer as an
individual is very questionable.
"The Iliad" and"The Odyssey"
were passed down for generations
as oral tradition before they were
ever written down.
Does he mean to imply that
cultures outside the West have no
such oral traditions? Or that
somehow they don't stack up to
Homer? We, unfortunately, didn't
ever get the chance to study
African oral tradition — so we
wouldn't know.
We continue. Lieberman writes.
"Although it is important to have
knowledge of other cultures, the
priority should be knowledge of
one's own background." Good
then! Asians, Hispanlcs, blacks,
native Americans, Eastern
Europeans, etc. don't have to take
Western Culture anymore!
Lieberman also proclaims, "To
instruct students in our culture's
flaws with equal fervor as they are

instructed in its virtues is to
impress upon their minds that
what they are learning 16
meaningless."
Besides the appalling grammar
of his statement, we must point
out this fact: The great thinkers of
the Western world themselves ex
amined the flaws and the virtues
of their cultures; therein lies their
importance. Are we not to study
Galileo, Rousseau, Voltaire and
Darwin — to name very few — be
cause they dared to question the
established order?
I
His next statement we find the
most difficult to stomach: "Who is
to say that one culture is better
than another? The answer is:
reality. . . . The West has trie
greatest degree of material af
fluence and political freedom
(including women's rights) in the
world, and this is not mere coinci
dence."
Indeed it is not coincidence. Tlie
West gained much of its "material
affluence" and "political freedom"
through the exploitation of not
only other cultures but its own
people as well. Slavery, coloni
alism, forced religious conversion
— the list is endless.
Stanford prides itself on its di
versity. The student body and fac
ulty are composed of people from
widely varied backgrounds. What,
then, does Lieberman mean when
he refers to "our culture?" One
needs only to look around this
campus to realize that we are not
simply one homogeneous mass.
