## Poland program offers glimpse behind Iron Curtain 
### DAVID LIPPEATT Editorial staff 
Poland is a land of paradoxes.
Possessing a rich cultural heritage
and a long, colorful history, the
country now falls under the gray
shadow of the Soviet Union. Beau
tiful. distinctive architecture,
lively mountain resorts and
nightclubs blaring jazz Into the
early morning hours all contrast
sharply with the stark uniforms of
the national mllltla and the heavy
hand of the government. Only a
few years ago, the Solidarity labor
union called massive strikes and
led thousands of protesters
through the streets; now once
again dissent is voiced In
whispers.
Stanford students have a
unique opportunity to see these
paradoxes for themselves, to live
for a while in a land where hope
and despair are balanced against
a backdrop of government repres
sion. After a successful pilot pro
gram last summer, the Stanford
Overseas Studies Office is once
again offering students a chance
to live, study and learn at the
Jagiellonian University in
Krakow. Poland.
This summer, 25 Stanford stu
dents will travel to Krakow, where
they will live in dormitories with
Western Europeans and other
foreign students, and will take
courses — from English-speaking

Polish professors — on topics
such as East/West relations, the
economics of socialism, and
Polish history, literature and lan
guage.
Beginning in 1988, the program
will be offered spring quarter,
which will allow Stanford stu
dents to meet and interact with
Polish students before they leave
the Jagiellonian for the summer.
The purpose of the Stanford
center in Krakow is "to initiate a
dialogue with voices long inacces
sible" and to study both "the dif
ferences and the potential for
reconciliation" in East/West rela
tions, according to an Overseas
Studies bulletin.
Janet Schmidt, academic pro
gram adviser for Overseas
Studies, explained that the center
has taken as its focus the aca
demic theme of Poland between
East and West.
"American education is
egocentric," said Jagiellonian Uni
versity Sociology Prof. Andrzej
Kapiszewski. the director of Stan
ford's program. "Americans think
of everything in terms of a
U.S./U.S.S.R. conflict - but the
world is wider than that. For small
nations it's important to be appre
ciated by the superpowers and
world public opinion" and the
Stanford program in Krakow at
tempts to address this issue, he
said.
Students studying at the Jagiel

lonian can use Poland as a case
study to discuss the question of
what role small countries can play
in world affairs, Kapiszewski
added.
The program is also useful to
students because Poland contrib
uted part of the European cultural
heritage that the United States
was built upon, he said. "By learn
ing about Poland and Polish cul
ture, Americans can learn about
themselves."
The Poland program differs
from other Stanford overseas pro
grams in several ways, according
to senior Chip Atterbury, who
spent last summer in Krakow. "I
could talk about the quality of the
courses and the professors in the

program, but you can find this in
any overseas program. In Poland,
you were very definitely not in a
Western country. The other
(Stanford) programs are just like
mini-Stanfords' overseas. In
Krakow, we were far removed from
the everyday experience of Stan
ford students.
"Also, Americans don't realize
that our news media carries cer
tain biases. In Poland, we were
away from (this) Western ideologi
cal tunnel vision.' " he said.
Among Eastern bloc countries,
Poland is particularly appropriate
for this program because of the
relative lack of restrictions on stu
dents entering the country, Kapis
zewski explained.

"The Polish government is
peculiar among those of Eastern
Europe because It places very few
obstacles" in the path of Western
students wishing to study here,
he said.
The large number of Polish ex
patriates in Europe and the
United States, and a strong Polish
historical connection with the
West are the primary reasons for
the ease of student entry, he said.
Stanford cooperation with the
Jagiellonian University is not just
one-sided; it will also involve
bringing Polish professors to
Stanford to teach, Kapiszewski
said.
The Jagiellonian University has
a tradition of intellectual ex
change with the West dating from
the university's founding in 1364,
he said. "We believe that any ex
change of ideas is beneficial to
both (parties)."
"Every year for the past several
years, 600 to 700 American stu
dents have come to Krakow to
study for the summer. Out of
3,000 faculty in Krakow, about
900 (faculty members) have
visited the West, as have several
hundred Polish students." he
said.
The Stanford program is a logi
cal outgrowth of this exchange.
Kapiszewski explained.
The Overseas Studies Office is
delighted with the cooperation of
the Poles, according to Schmidt.

"It's unusual for American univer
sities to have programs in Eastern
bloc countries . . . because the
universities usually won't accept
the restrictions Communist gov
ernments place on bringing in
academic material — but the
Jagiellonian will allow us to bring
books in," she said.
Faculty from the Jagiellonian
want and need scholarly interac
tion with the West in order to keep
aware of advances in their fields,
and the government, recognizing
this, has allowed Western stu
dents to bring academic materials
into the country, Schmidt ex
plained.
Overseas Studies officials say
they are excited about the pro
gram's move to spring quarter,
beginning in 1988. Schmidt said
she feels that this represents an
important opportunity for Stan
ford students to study with Polish
students, which is not possible
during the summer.
In addition, the Krakow curric
ulum has been matched with that
offered in Berlin so that Stanford
students at the Berlin center
during winter quarter may move
to Krakow for the spring to com
plete a unified course of study in
East/West issues, Schmidt added.
Students participating in the
program this summer will have
opportunities to go on field trips
similar to those undertaken last
summer, Schmidt said.
