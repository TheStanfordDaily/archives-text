# Reagan group wanted united library and center

### CLINT HIGHFILL MARY YUH Senior staff writers 
While not denying that opposition at Stanford
played a part in their decision, trustees of the
Ronald Reagan Presidential Foundation repeated
Friday that the primary motivation for moving the
Reagan library to Southern California was a
desire to recouple the library and policy center.
In 1983, Stanford's Faculty Senate and Board of
Trustees voted unanimously that a policy center
would have to be governed by the University, not
the Hoover Institution.
"We were never interested in that (Stanford
governance), so we n~ver even asked for it," Gary
Jones, executive director of the foundation, told
the San Jose Mercury News. "But as things began
to evolve, as new members came on, a consensus
emerged that we really have to have them both to
gether."
The most recent additions to the foundation's
nine-member board of trustees were publisher
Walter Annenberg and recording industry execu
tive Lew Wasserman, according to Hoover Senior
Fellow Martin Anderson, who is secretary of the
board. Former presidential adviser Michael
Deaver recently resigned from the board.
At Thursday's board meeting, only Campbell
and Anderson wanted the library to remain at
Stanford, the Mercury News reported.
University President Donald Kennedy said he

was disappointed by the foundation's decision. He
said the foundation "very likely" would have made
the same decision in the absence of recent faculty
dissent.
The Reagan Library, like other presidential li
braries, will be a major academic resource, Ander
son said. "Southern California's gain is going to
be Northern California's loss," he said.
Anderson said former President Carter's use of
his library/policy center at Emory University in
Atlanta helped convince the foundation to reunite
the library and policy center.
Carter has been attracting top policy officials to
conferences at his center, Anderson said. For ex
ample, "everybody came" to a recent joint confer
ence held by Carter and former President Ford,
Anderson said.
Reagan foundation trustee John Herrington,
secretary of Energy, told the Mercury News: "The
driving force was having both the center and the
library in proximity to each other. . . . And of
course putting it in Southern California means
the president will be much closer to it — and that
was a consideration too."
Reagan, who owns a ranch near Santa Barbara
and has reportedly purchased a house in Los An
geles, plans to retire in Southern California.
Anderson said that he had been contacted
Friday about a number of potential sites for the li
brary/public policy center complex, and "virtually
all of them are major universities
or colleges in Southern Califor
nia."
Although he would not divulge
the number or location of the sites
he had been contacted about, he
said a major consideration will be
available space.
"When you get to Southern Cali
fornia, they measure property in
square feet and square inches,
and the needs we're talking about
are acres." Anderson said. "It's
possible, but it's not as likely that
it's going to be an urban library."
And although the foundation
favors a university or college site.

Anderson said it is "entirely possi
ble that a site would become
available without a university."
USC Provost Cornelius Pings
said that USC's president had
been approached several weeks
ago by individuals close to the
White House.
This week, USC will assess pos
sible sites and scholarly support
for a library and contact the foun
dation if a USC site seems
plausible, Pings said.
Although UC-Santa Barbara
and Reagan representatives dis
cussed in 1984 the possibility of
locating the complex at the uni
versity, UCSB officials said Friday
they are not seeking it.
The chancellor of UCLA, an
other school rumored to be a pos
sible site, told the Los Angeles

Times that there has been no pro
posal to locate the library there.
Both UCLA and UCSB officials
cited a shortage of available land
and potential traffic problems.
Officials at Pepperdine Univer
sity in Malibu, another site
reportedly under consideration,
could not be reached for com
ment.
Officials at Occidental and
Pomona colleges said there was no
indication that the library and
policy center would come to their
schools.
Several public university repre
sentatives said they doubted a
public university would be selec
ted as the site.
The approval process for a state
university would be too time
consuming and difficult.
