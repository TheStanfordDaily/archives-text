## McEnroe captures Pac-10 singles title 
### KEN STEVENS Senior staff writer 
OJAI â€” Patrick McEnroe took a
page out of Luke Jensen's book
yesterday and served his way to
the 1987 Pacific 10 Conference
men's singles title at the 88th an
nual Ojai Valley Tennis Tourna
ment.
The Stanford junior frustrated
the aggressive Jensen with a deep
serve that kept his counterpart off
the net enough to post a 4-6, 6-3,
7-6 (7-4) victory over the USC
standout before a standing-room
only crowd of almost 1.000 at Lib
bey Park.
"It's a great title," Stanford
Coach Dick Gould said. "I'm very
happy for Patrick. He's been
through a lot this year."
"It's nice to be able to win here
and salvage somewhat the
season." McEnroe said. "I haven't
had a great year."
Jensen has had a great year, but
not against McEnroe, his former
partner in junior doubles.
McEnroe has bested him all three
times they have met this season.
It was Jensen who captured the
first set yesterday, using his pow
erful ambidextrous serve and his
soft touch at the net to win 6-4. "It
took awhile for me to get going,"
McEnroe said. "I wasn't moving
my feet well."
McEnroe began to move more in
the second set, following short
balls into the net more frequently
to put pressure on Jensen. In the
second game of the set, Jensen
uncharacteristically double
faulted to lose his serve. McEnroe
then held to go up 3-0 and coasted
in for a 6-3 victory that evened the
match.
The third set was a test of which
player would crack first. But true
to their billing, neither gave in on
his service. With the score 4-4,
Jensen trailed 1-3 on his service.

but two resounding serves later,
he was even at 3-3. McEnroe then
blasted a backhand wide of the
chalk, and Jensen had held.
After McEnroe held to even the
score at 5-5, he forced another 3-
all point on Jensen's serve. But
Jensen thwarted McEnroe's first
passing shot on the next point,
and McEnroe's next crosscourt
forehand failed wide.
McEnroe sent the match to a
third-set tiebreaker with another
quick service game. "I felt that 1
was holding my serve pretty easily,
so 1 had an advantage going into
the tiebreaker," McEnroe said.
Jensen's serve was also healthy,
and he took a 3-2 lead early in the
12-point tiebreaker by virtue of
three service winners. McEnroe
held on the next two points to take
a 4-3 lead.
The crucial point came next, as
Jensen pushed McEnroe deep into
the corner and came to the net.
McEnroe responded with a siz
zling forehand down the line that
Jensen lunged for but volleyed
high into the stands.
Serving at 5-4, McEnroe got a
match point when he caught Jen
sen halfway and passed him down
the line to go up 6-4. McEnroe
then pulled Jensen wide with his
next serve, Jensen returned it into
the bottom of the net, and
McEnroe raised both fists in vic
tory.
On the other side of the court,
the Trojan star slammed his
racket on top of the net in disgust.
The big serve on match point
was a fitting way for McEnroe to
capture the championship. "I
think the key to today's match was
Pat serving very well," Gould said.
McEnroe's victory not only
salvaged his season, but it gave
the Cardinal an upbeat ending to
what might otherwise have been a
