The final day of this weekend's inaugural Avis
Swimming Championships at UCLA may have
caused some women's swimming fans to experience
a great sense of deja vu; that is, until the outcome.
Yesterday marked a rematch between NCAA cham
pion Texas and runner-up Stanford, but this time
the Cardinal prevailed, beating the Longhorns 59-54
to win the meet. Stanford held a comfortable 52-36
lead going into the diving competition and last few
events, and held on to pull off the win.
"It was a pretty good meet." Stanford Coach George
Haines said. "We swam great. This meet was impor

season."
The freestyle events were particularly strong for
the Cardinal. In the 50-meter freestyle, sophomore

56.76. The two flip-flopped in the 200, with Gillespie
first with a time of 1:59.45 and Berzins second in
2:01.02.
Texas finished first and third in the 800 freestyle,

the race in 8:37.74 and earn second place. Stanford
also placed second in the freestyle relay with a mark
of 55.54.
The 200 medley relay was a totally different story.
Due to the disqualification of Texas, the Cardinal
took the event 7-0. "We were disqualified in the relay
yesterday (Saturday), so I guess we're even." Haines
added.
In the 200 individual medley, Texas' Betsy
Mitchell, the 1986 United States Swimmer of the
Year, won the race. Stanford senior Susan Rapp
finished second in 2:14.51, and freshman Michelle
Griglione's 2:15.05 was good enough for third.
Rapp also earned a second place in the 100
breaststroke, clocking in at 1:10.02 after the start-
