# Women beat Texas for revenge
## 
### EVAN TUCHINSKY Staff writer 
The final day of this weekend's inaugural Avis
Swimming Championships at UCLA may have
caused some women's swimming fans to experience
a great sense of deja vu; that is, until the outcome.
Yesterday marked a rematch between NCAA cham
pion Texas and runner-up Stanford, but this time
the Cardinal prevailed, beating the Longhorns 59-54
to win the meet. Stanford held a comfortable 52-36
lead going into the diving competition and last few
events, and held on to pull off the win.
"It was a pretty good meet." Stanford Coach George
Haines said. "We swam great. This meet was impor
tant to us. a good way to kick off the summer
season."
The freestyle events were particularly strong for
the Cardinal. In the 50-meter freestyle, sophomore
All-America Jenna Johnson not only won the race,
but broke an American record in the process, finish
ing in 25.31 seconds.
The 100 free was also lucrative for Stanford, with

sophomore Aimee Berzins's placing second in 55.99
seconds and freshman Lisa Gillespie's third in
56.76. The two flip-flopped in the 200, with Gillespie
first with a time of 1:59.45 and Berzins second in
2:01.02.
Texas finished first and third in the 800 freestyle,
but junior Stacy Shupe swam well enough to finish
the race in 8:37.74 and earn second place. Stanford
also placed second in the freestyle relay with a mark
of 55.54.
The 200 medley relay was a totally different story.
Due to the disqualification of Texas, the Cardinal
took the event 7-0. "We were disqualified in the relay
yesterday (Saturday), so I guess we're even." Haines
added.
In the 200 individual medley, Texas' Betsy
Mitchell, the 1986 United States Swimmer of the
Year, won the race. Stanford senior Susan Rapp
finished second in 2:14.51, and freshman Michelle
Griglione's 2:15.05 was good enough for third.
Rapp also earned a second place in the 100
breaststroke, clocking in at 1:10.02 after the start-
ing gun. Freshman Susan Lenth came in a few
seconds later, taking third with a 1:13.53 race time.
The 100 backstroke race was yet another hotbed of
competition. Sophomore Michelle Donahue fin! *hed
second In 1:02.55 and junior Jennifer Pokluda
placed third in 1:03.44, but the race clearly belonged
to Texas' Mitchell, who set a new American record en
route to the victory.
The title in the first Avis Swimming Champion
ship. however, went to Stanford. The meet was de
signed to find the best team rather than the best col
lection of swimmers.
'It's a good concept," Haines said. "It's outstanding
that Avis is a corporate sponsor interested in swim
ming. This could mean more money coming in for
swimming programs."
The meet should also serve as a morale booster for
the Stanford swimmers in their off-season training.
"We train all spring. This should give them the in
centive to train hard for the Pan American Games."
Haines added.
