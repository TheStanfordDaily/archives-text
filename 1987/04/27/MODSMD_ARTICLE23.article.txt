# ASU takes two from Card
## 
### ROBERT PORTNOY Staff writer 
TEMPE, Ariz.— For only the
second time all season, the No. 4
Stanford Cardinal lost a Pacific 10
Southern Division series.
Stanford was defeated here yes
terday 5-2 by Arizona State to
drop two of three to the Sun Devils
and fall to 34-14 on the season.
16-7 In conference play. The Card
inal did. however, maintain a 1
1/2-game lead over second-place
UCLA in the Six-Pac, as California
took two of three from the Bruins
In Berkeley.
The key play in yesterday's con
test came In the Cardinal fourth.
After ASU picked up three runs in
the third to grab the early lead.
Stanford rallied. With one out.
Junior designated hitter Jeff
Saenger crushed one up the rlght
centerfleld alley for the first triple

of his Stanford career. Junior
catcher Doug Robbins singled
him home for the Cardinal's first
run.
After a Frank Carey single and a
walk by David Esquer, the bases
were loaded for senior left fielder
Ruben Amaro, a clutch hitter
throughout his career. Amaro
worked the count to 2-2 against
ASU starter Gordy Farmer, then
ripped the next pitch to right. The
Devils' Dan Rumsey charged in on
the sinking liner to make a spec
tacular diving catch to end the in
ning.
"He came with a change-up and
thought he could fool me. 1 hit" it
right on the screws with a little
topspin. I was surprised he was
playing so shallow after the balls I
hit to the wall yesterday
(Saturday). But he made a great
play, you have to give him credit."
Amaro said.

"If he misses It and It gets by
him. three runs score," Stanford
Coach Mark Marquess added.
ASU went up 4-1 In the bottom
of the Inning, and Stanford could
muster only an RBI double from
Carey In the sixth against the
Devils' Llnty Ingram, who replaced
Farmer earlier in the inning with
a two-ball count on Robbins. In
gram. whom Stanford roughed up
as a starter the day before, saved
the win for Farmer, while Cardinal
ace Jack McDowell went the dis
tance, giving up five earned runs
and falling to 6-4 on the season.
The key play of the series was
not made by a player. With ASU
trailing 6-4 in the ninth Inning of
Friday's game, Devils' center
fielder John Finn stroked a two
out single against Cardinal bull-
pen standout Steve Chltren. One strike
from defeat, shortstop Mike Benjamin sin
gled him to third.
Second baseman Tim Esmay. who had a
key two-run single yesterday, then delivered
a grounder up the middle. Stanford's senior
center fielder Toi Cook charged the ball and
tried to barehand It. He mishandled it. then
threw carefully to the second baseman
Carey. Finn scored, and Benjamin, now
rounding third, caught sight of ASU third
base coach Jeff Pentland emphatically
waving him home. Benjamin never stopped
and barely beat Carey's throw to the plate to
tie it.
"I was thinking I wanted to charge it be
cause I knew he was going to try for three
(bases). I took my eye off it and bobbled it.
Then I was thinking just get the ball to
Frankie. It was a good, aggressive play by
the third base coach," Cook said.
After an intentional walk to the first
baseman Ted Dyson, Carey lost Rumsey's
looper in the lights for an error to load the
bases. Designated hitter Tony Mattia,
whose two-run homer in the eighth cut the
margin to 6-4, saw Chltren fall behind In
the count 3-0. After getting it back to 3-2,
Chltren came with the heat, his bread-and
butter fastball. Mattia fouled off two, then
drilled the next one deep over the rightfield
fence for the 10-6 win, dropping Chltren,
who had saved all three games against ASU
at Sunken Diamond, to 5-2.
Junior Lee Plemel. the Cardinal's hottest

pitcher of late, had another excellent out
lng, going 7 2/3 Innings, giving up four
runs — two earned — and getting no deci
sion. The late-lnnlng heroics made a win
ner of ASU starter Mike Schwabe, who went
nine and allowed six runs, five earned.
Game two of the series was all Stanford.
The Cardinal batters turned a tight 3-3 ball
game — they knocked out the starter In
gram with three in the third — into a 13-5
rout with their most productive inning of
the year, a 10-run outburst in the fourth
against relievers David Cassidy and Matt
Shiflett. Cassidy gave up seven earned runs
and took the loss, while Shiflett finished
the game for ASU. The inning was high
lighted by a grand slam from freshman
right fielder Paul Carey, a two-run homer by
first baseman Ron Witmeyer and a three
run shot by Cook.
"When I was on deck. I was hoping Ed
(third baseman Sprague) would get on with
a walk, becuase I knew that I'd get fastballs.
With first base open, it would've been all
curveballs. It felt good coming off the bat."
Carey said.
A 1 Osuna, the Cardinal's senior lefty, was
the surprise starter because of all the left
handed bats in ASU's lineup. Osuna got out
of a bases-loaded, one-out jam in the third
by striking out third baseman Bob
Dombrowski and getting Finn to fly to cen
ter, and settled down to pitch the first com
plete game of his Stanford career, fanning
six and walking two.
"I knew I had to bear down with the bases
loaded and one out. I was thinking
strikeout. I didn't really throw Finn a good
pitch. He hit a flat slider and and Cook was
positioned well." Osuna said.

Devils' Llnty Ingram, who replaced
Farmer earlier in the inning with
a two-ball count on Robbins. In
gram. whom Stanford roughed up
as a starter the day before, saved
the win for Farmer, while Cardinal
ace Jack McDowell went the dis
tance, giving up five earned runs
and falling to 6-4 on the season.
The key play of the series was
not made by a player. With ASU
trailing 6-4 in the ninth Inning of
Friday's game, Devils' center
fielder John Finn stroked a two
out single against Cardinal bull-
pen standout Steve Chltren. One strike
from defeat, shortstop Mike Benjamin sin
gled him to third.
Second baseman Tim Esmay. who had a
key two-run single yesterday, then delivered
a grounder up the middle. Stanford's senior
center fielder Toi Cook charged the ball and
tried to barehand It. He mishandled it. then
threw carefully to the second baseman
Carey. Finn scored, and Benjamin, now
rounding third, caught sight of ASU third
base coach Jeff Pentland emphatically
waving him home. Benjamin never stopped
and barely beat Carey's throw to the plate to
tie it.
"I was thinking I wanted to charge it be
cause I knew he was going to try for three
(bases). I took my eye off it and bobbled it.
Then I was thinking just get the ball to
Frankie. It was a good, aggressive play by
the third base coach," Cook said.
After an intentional walk to the first
baseman Ted Dyson, Carey lost Rumsey's
looper in the lights for an error to load the
bases. Designated hitter Tony Mattia,
whose two-run homer in the eighth cut the
margin to 6-4, saw Chltren fall behind In
the count 3-0. After getting it back to 3-2,
Chltren came with the heat, his bread-and
butter fastball. Mattia fouled off two, then
drilled the next one deep over the rightfield
fence for the 10-6 win, dropping Chltren,
who had saved all three games against ASU
at Sunken Diamond, to 5-2.
Junior Lee Plemel. the Cardinal's hottest

pitcher of late, had another excellent out
lng, going 7 2/3 Innings, giving up four
runs — two earned — and getting no deci
sion. The late-lnnlng heroics made a win
ner of ASU starter Mike Schwabe, who went
nine and allowed six runs, five earned.
Game two of the series was all Stanford.
The Cardinal batters turned a tight 3-3 ball
game — they knocked out the starter In
gram with three in the third — into a 13-5
rout with their most productive inning of
the year, a 10-run outburst in the fourth
against relievers David Cassidy and Matt
Shiflett. Cassidy gave up seven earned runs
and took the loss, while Shiflett finished
the game for ASU. The inning was high
lighted by a grand slam from freshman
right fielder Paul Carey, a two-run homer by
first baseman Ron Witmeyer and a three
run shot by Cook.
"When I was on deck. I was hoping Ed
(third baseman Sprague) would get on with
a walk, becuase I knew that I'd get fastballs.
With first base open, it would've been all
curveballs. It felt good coming off the bat."
Carey said.
A 1 Osuna, the Cardinal's senior lefty, was
the surprise starter because of all the left
handed bats in ASU's lineup. Osuna got out
of a bases-loaded, one-out jam in the third
by striking out third baseman Bob
Dombrowski and getting Finn to fly to cen
ter, and settled down to pitch the first com
plete game of his Stanford career, fanning
six and walking two.
"I knew I had to bear down with the bases
loaded and one out. I was thinking
strikeout. I didn't really throw Finn a good
pitch. He hit a flat slider and and Cook was
positioned well." Osuna said.
TEMPE, Ariz.— For only the
second time all season, the No. 4
Stanford Cardinal lost a Pacific 10
Southern Division series.
Stanford was defeated here yes
terday 5-2 by Arizona State to
drop two of three to the Sun Devils
and fall to 34-14 on the season.
16-7 In conference play. The Card
inal did. however, maintain a 1
1/2-game lead over second-place
UCLA in the Six-Pac, as California
took two of three from the Bruins
In Berkeley.
The key play in yesterday's con
test came In the Cardinal fourth.
After ASU picked up three runs in
the third to grab the early lead.
Stanford rallied. With one out.
Junior designated hitter Jeff
Saenger crushed one up the rlght
centerfleld alley for the first triple

of his Stanford career. Junior
catcher Doug Robbins singled
him home for the Cardinal's first
run.
After a Frank Carey single and a
walk by David Esquer, the bases
were loaded for senior left fielder
Ruben Amaro, a clutch hitter
throughout his career. Amaro
worked the count to 2-2 against
ASU starter Gordy Farmer, then
ripped the next pitch to right. The
Devils' Dan Rumsey charged in on
the sinking liner to make a spec
tacular diving catch to end the in
ning.
"He came with a change-up and
thought he could fool me. 1 hit" it
right on the screws with a little
topspin. I was surprised he was
playing so shallow after the balls I
hit to the wall yesterday
(Saturday). But he made a great
play, you have to give him credit."
Amaro said.

"If he misses It and It gets by
him. three runs score," Stanford
Coach Mark Marquess added.
ASU went up 4-1 In the bottom
of the Inning, and Stanford could
