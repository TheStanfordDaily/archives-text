# Gymnasts falter at NCAAs
## 
### MARK SMOYER Staff writer 
LOS ANGELES — After a season
of Injuries and disappointments
that had the team looking toward
next year halfway through this
year, the Stanford men's gymnas
tics team sent three representa
tives to this weekend's NCAA
championships at UCLA's Pauley
Pavilion looking to break the Jinx
that seemed to have been put on
It.
The national championships
went right along with the trend.

however, as none of the Cardinal
trio performed up to his ranking.
Junior Mike Matzek. considered
as a contender for the all-around
title, turned in what Stanford
Coach Sadao Hamada called a
"mediocre" performance, finish
ing 21st.
Chuck Gerardo came Into the
pommel horse competition ranked
No. 2 in the nation but failed to
make the event's finals, finishing
23rd with a 9.35 score he felt was
unfair, though Hamada disa
greed.
Scott Schaffer was unable to

train two of the last three weeks
for his event, the vault, because of
Injuries to both feet and finished
59th at 9.1.
But don't turn to Bloom County
yet; It's not all that depressing.
Those few thousand who attended
the weekend's festivities. Includ
ing the three Cardinal, could not
have had anything but a thrilling
time as UCLA's clutch perfor
mance gave It 285.30 points and
the victory In a team competition
that saw runners-up Nebraska
and Penn State finish over 284 points, a first under
the present men's gymnastics scoring system.
Nebraska juniors Tom Schlesinger and Kevin
Davis took first and second in the individual compe
tition. Schlesinger's astounding 58.15 optlonals
score combined with a meet-leading 55.10 to take
the title by over a point.
Although the Stanford gymnasts were not terribly
happy with their performances, they did not allow
that to stop them from enjoying themselves. "I came
here to have a good time, and I did, Matzek said.
"The gymnastics are incredible here." Schaffer
said, "I've been meeting old friends; hopefully we're
going to Disneyland tomorrow."
"That's the Disneyland of the South, not quite as
good as the Disneyland of the North, Matzek added.
In his charge for the individual championship,
Matzek faced some major obstacles not encountered
by his former teammate Jon Louis, who won the title
last year. Both he and Hamada said that the NCAAs
are definitely a team competition and those individ
uals who receive bids at-large are at a clear disadvan
tage.
"The circumstances are. really hard for individ
uals," Matzek said. "You're not set up by your
teammates and nobody's cheering for you. When
people are yelling, 'Good set, good set,' it definitely af
fects the judges' scoring."
Gerardo was slated to compete all-around as well,
something that would have helped to alleviate Mat
zek's tough situation. However, he decided not to en
ter the six eVents. Gerardo was ready for the pommel
horse, though, and after throwing a routine that he
said was barely distinguishable from the same sets
that had given him a 9.8 average through the
season, was very disappointed with his 9.35 score.
