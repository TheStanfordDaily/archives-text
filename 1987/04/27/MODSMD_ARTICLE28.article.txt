OJAI â€” Playing her fourth
match in as many days, a tired
Elenl Rossides lost yesterday to
UCLA's Wendy Ouwendijk in the
finals of the Women's Invitational
Collegiate Singles at the 88th an
nual Ojai Valley Tennis Tourna
ment.
Despite Rossides' 6-0, 7-6 loss,
the weekend was deemed a suc
cess by Stanford Coach Frank
Brennan and Rossides, who saw
her first singles action in over a
year.
"I felt fine." said Rossides, who
was recovering from a double
stress fracture injury. "My strokes
were good. ... I'd like to play in
the matches next week. This was a
perfect warm-up."
"I'm very encouraged," Brennan
said. "She's not hurt; she's not
having any pain. As far as I'm con
cerned, it's a total success, be
cause she got to play the maxi
mum number of matches. She
came back a lot faster than I
thought."
Brennan said that if Rossides
responds well physically to this
weekend's action, she will be In
the Cardinal lineup Wednesday
against U.S. International and
Friday at California.
The full weekend of play took its
toll on Rossides yesterday. Her
mobility was less than it had been
during her 7-5, 4-1 (default) vic
tory over Cal's Tiffany Silveria and
her 6-1, 4-6, 7-5 win against
UCLA's Debbie Ceccato in Satur
day's semifinal.
Rossides won just five points in
the first set yesterday, but she
climbed back into the match In
the second set. Though she began
to hit her groundstrokes with
more velocity and accuracy, it was
ultimately her serve that undid
Rossides. She double-faulted

several times and had to resort to
spinning her serve to get It In.
"I don't really like to do that,"
Rossides said. "My serve was
shaky. It's usually the first thing
to go. It's always been really weak
(during my rehabilitation), and I
haven't done enough with it.
Throughout the week, it was OK.
Maybe it (yesterday's perfor
mance) was a culmination of the
week."
The weekend was not as fruitful
as the Cardinal had hoped. For
the first time in four years, Stan
ford did not win the team title, as
Cal captured the Pacific 10 Con
ference trophy.
The Cardinal was eliminated
from the Pac-10 singles tourna
ment single-handedly by UCLA's
Jane Thomas, who captured the
title yesterday. In Friday's quarter
final. Thomas outlasted Kay
Tittle. 6-4, 5-7, 7-6 (7-5). Tittle
held a 5-1 lead in the tiebreaker
but netted a couple of critical vol
leys as Thomas came back to win.
"She (Tittle) pl'ayed really well,"
Brennan said. "She had opportu
nities, but she missed a couple of
sitters. She got tight at the end,
which is unusual for Kay."
Saturday. Thomas took out
Cardinal freshman Lisa Green In
the semifinals. 7-6 (7-2), 6-2. "The
first set really took the starch out
of her (Green)," Brennan said.
"Lisa had a lot of 3-3 games she
couldn't win in the second set."
Thomas served as well as she
did all tournament against Green.
"Lisa's at a disadvantage when the
girl serves that well," Brennan
said. "Lisa's not going to hold
serve all the time."
The Cardinal doubles teams
were also out of the Pac-10 tourna
ment by yesterday. Freshman
Valerie Wilson and sophomore
Cindy Buchsbaum lost in Friday
morning's first round to Lupita
Novelo and Ginny Purdy of USC, 4-
6, 6-3, 6-0. Tittle and Green were

also taken out in the first round,
as Arizona State's No. 1 team of
Carol Coparanis and Laura Glitz
prevailed. 6-4. 6-4.
Seniors Patty Fendlck and
Stephanie Savides won twice
Friday to advance to the semi
finals, but Saturday the No. 2
seeds were upended by Purdy and
Novelo, 6-3, 6-3. It was the Stan
ford duo's first loss since
February.
"They were just a little flat,"
Brennan said. "You can't peak
every day. The other team played
very well. I was happy that they
(Fendick and Savides) kept trying
and didn't lose control."
