# Card track prepares for Cal meet at SLO
## 
### ERIK STEN Editorial staff 
Saturday's six-team track meet at Cal
Poly-San Luis Obispo was low-key, yet it
Just may have resulted in some critical
developments for Stanford.
The verdict will be in next week.
Next Saturday, the Cardinal will take on
California in what promises to be the
closest meet between the two rivals in
nearly 10 years. If Stanford hopes to realize
its season-long goal of upsetting the Bears,
it will need strong performances from the
second and third runners in each event.
With early forecasts putting either team's
margin of victory at less than 10 points, a
few surprise placers could change the
outcome of the meet.
Assuming the star athletes live up to their
potential, the second- and third-place win
ners could make the difference. The Stan
ford coaches were looking to get those ath
letes ready Saturday.
After Saturday's meet was over, the signs
looked good. The Cardinal walked away
with a score of personal and season bests
and for the first time this year put together
women's sprint and mile relays. The Stan
ford coaches were pleased, but as usual,
they were looking forward to Cal.
"The bottom line is that this was the last
meet of the regular season," Asst. Coach
Scott Chisam said. "The championship
season starts next week with Cal.
"(This weekend) we didn't get quite as
many people qualified for Pac-lOs as we
would have liked to, but we did have a lot of

good individual performances, and the
women's team is really starting to come to
gether. Overall we're quite excited."
One performance that excited Chlsam
was that of middle distance runner Nora
Williams. The junior posted a season-best
time of 2:14.3 in the 800 meters and then
returned in the mile relay to run an impres
sive 400 in which she spent the entire lap
holding off a fast-charging Cal Poly runner.
"Nora made a big breakthrough," Chisam
said. "It was her most gutsy effort of the
season. That kind of performance could be
Important against Cal."
Two more Important performers for the
Cardinal were long jumper Henry Green
and shotputter Andy Papathanasslou. Both
football players, Green and Papathanssaiou
had missed the last couple weeks of practice
because of conflicting spring football drills.
At San Luis Obispo, Green jumped 23
feet, 7 inches, and Papathanasslou threw
55-0, both marks that indicate that the duo
should be ready to return to the track in full
form.
Other Stanford winners were Marc
Oleson, who won the 1,500 in a Pacific 10
Conference qualifying time of 3:47.46, and
sophomore Patty Purpur who won both the
shot put and the discus with throws of 47-3
and 159-2, respectively.
Olesen was followed in the 1,500 by
junior Steve Schadler in second at 3:51.43
and freshman Bill Crowley in fourth at
3:55.10. Also in fourth behind Purpur was
sophomore Morgyn Warner, who set a per
sonal record with a toss of 40-9.
