# Policies may change
## 
### CLAY CALVERT Staff writer 
The drowning death of 20-year-old
junior David Dunshee last week in
Lagunita is causing University officials
to re-examine several policies, including
the University's alcohol policy, the fra
ternity Rush process and guidelines for
parties at Lagunita.
"I think everything will probably have
to be examined," said Norm Robinson,
acting dean of Student Affairs. He added
that "it's almost inevitable that the
(alcohol) policy will change."
Police speculate that Dunshee, who
was not of legal California drinking age,
consumed alcohol at a Tuesday night

Zeta Psi Rush party by the lake and
stumbled into the water about 1 a.m.
Police said it was likely that Dunshee, a
Zete, became disoriented after entering
the water and drowned.
Robinson, however, would not spec
ulate on what specific changes will take
place until all the facts of the incident
are made clear. He said he hopes to
know the complete story behind the
drowning early this week.
Robinson said he will meet today with
Diana Conklin and other student affairs
officers to discuss the investigation.
Robinson said Conklin, assistant
dean of Student Affairs and director of
the Row, has requested a report
on the incident.
Conklln agreed with Robinson
that a number of policies will be
reviewed.
"Once we find out enough about
what happened, we're going to
have to re-examine everything,"
including the Rush and alcohol
policies, she said.
The University's alcohol policy is
a simple and straightforward
statement, borrowing from state
laws and Including guidelines es
tablished by Residential Educa
tion.
The policy states that
"California law prohibits the con
sumption of alcohol by persons
under 21 and makes It Illegal to
buy for or supply alcohol to per
sons under 21." In addition, the
alcohol policy "requires that alco
hol not be the focus of an event
and that food and equally attrac
tive and abundant non-alcoholic
beverages be provided at residence
functions when alcohol is served."
However, hundreds of Stanford
students under the state drinking
age are regularly served alcohol at
campus parties, including those
in dormitories and fraternities.
Often, all that is needed to enter
and drink at a Stanford party is a
student identification card or a
room key.
A Res Ed booklet distributed to
resident assistants at the start of
the school year states that "while
the law regarding the legal drink
ing age is rarely enforced on col
lege campuses, it nonethless
applies. The fact that alcohol had
been provided to underage stu
dents would very likely be an im
portant issue in a [lawsuit]."
At a spring quarter meeting to
discuss party policies with house
presidents and officials, Robinson

passed out guidelines for party
planning and control. Also In at
tendance was Stanford Police
Chief Marvin Herrington, accord
ing to two dorm presidents at the
meeting.
One house president, who
asked not to be identified, called
the meeting "a joke" and said that
University officials are well aware
that students under 21 are served
alcohol at parties here.
"It's so hypocritical. They tell
you it's illegal to serve alcohol to
people under 21 and then they try
to tell you how to do It safely or
without getting caught," the stu
dent said.
Robinson said the alcohol policy
is In line with the "basic approach
to student conduct" at the Univer
sity, as it places the individual
student In charge of his own be
havior and the consequences of
that behavior.
He stressed, however, that no
policy will stop a student from
drinking.
"The policy isn't going to
prevent somebody who wants to
get drunk from getting drunk,"
Robinson said. Regarding the
Dunshee case, Robinson said,
"Was it (the alcohol policy)
working that night? I don't
know." He added that more facts
on the case are needed before
policies can be re-evaluated.
The incident also calls into
question the University's Rush
policy, which was restructured
this year to include a week of par
ties without alcohol and special
cards that Rushees had to show
when entering parties.
Interfraternity Council Presi
dent Steve Singleton said the
Dunshee incident "will probably
definitely effect" Rush policies and
that the IFC will begin re
examining its present policy.
Tony Burgos, president of the
Delta Kappa Epsilon fraternity,
said he anticipates that Rush will
become alcohol-free next year.

"The first thing we see coming
is a dry Rush, but we don't see
that as a problem," Burgos said.
He added that he didn't expect
"any major thing to occur with the
(fraternity) system as a whole."
Charles Moody, Kappa Alpha
fraternity president, said he
"wouldn't be surprised" if there
was a mandatory dry Rush next
year.
The new policy, developed by the
IFC, seemed to be working well
until the revelation of the Dun
shee drowning.
Last week before Dunshee's
body was discovered, Conklin said
she was "very pleased with this
year's Rush."
Also likely to be called into ques
tion are the rules and regulations
for parties at the lake, according
to David Ligon, Boathouse
facilities manager.
"I'm sure it's going to be ex
amined. I'm not sure if it will be
changed," Ligon said.
Ligon said that he didn't think
the present rules were at fault in
this case.
Margaret Ann Fidler, associate
dean of Student Affairs, said the
rules should be reviewed, but "not
under an eye that there is any
thing necessarily wrong" with
them.
Fidler called the present rules
"very sound."
A contract containing Boat
house rules for parties by the lake
must be signed by groups wanting
to have a party there. While the
rules do not prohibit the con
sumption of alcohol by the lake,
they do state that "all parties must
have a designated sober monitor
to serve as liaison with Boathouse
staff and ensure that rules are fol
lowed."
Among the rules in the contract
are the University's party
guidelines and a policy prohibit
ing swimming during or after the
parties.

was not of legal California drinking age,
consumed alcohol at a Tuesday night

Zeta Psi Rush party by the lake and
stumbled into the water about 1 a.m.
Police said it was likely that Dunshee, a
Zete, became disoriented after entering
the water and drowned.
Robinson, however, would not spec
ulate on what specific changes will take
place until all the facts of the incident
are made clear. He said he hopes to
know the complete story behind the
drowning early this week.
Robinson said he will meet today with
Diana Conklin and other student affairs
officers to discuss the investigation.
Robinson said Conklin, assistant
dean of Student Affairs and director of
the Row, has requested a report
on the incident.
Conklln agreed with Robinson
that a number of policies will be
reviewed.
"Once we find out enough about
what happened, we're going to
have to re-examine everything,"
including the Rush and alcohol
policies, she said.
The University's alcohol policy is
a simple and straightforward
statement, borrowing from state
laws and Including guidelines es
tablished by Residential Educa
tion.
The policy states that
"California law prohibits the con
sumption of alcohol by persons
under 21 and makes It Illegal to
buy for or supply alcohol to per
sons under 21." In addition, the
alcohol policy "requires that alco
hol not be the focus of an event
and that food and equally attrac
tive and abundant non-alcoholic
beverages be provided at residence
functions when alcohol is served."
However, hundreds of Stanford
students under the state drinking
age are regularly served alcohol at
campus parties, including those
in dormitories and fraternities.
Often, all that is needed to enter
and drink at a Stanford party is a
student identification card or a
room key.
A Res Ed booklet distributed to
resident assistants at the start of
the school year states that "while
the law regarding the legal drink
ing age is rarely enforced on col
lege campuses, it nonethless
applies. The fact that alcohol had
been provided to underage stu
dents would very likely be an im
portant issue in a [lawsuit]."
At a spring quarter meeting to
discuss party policies with house
presidents and officials, Robinson

passed out guidelines for party
planning and control. Also In at
tendance was Stanford Police
Chief Marvin Herrington, accord
ing to two dorm presidents at the
meeting.
One house president, who
asked not to be identified, called
the meeting "a joke" and said that
University officials are well aware
that students under 21 are served
alcohol at parties here.
"It's so hypocritical. They tell
you it's illegal to serve alcohol to
people under 21 and then they try
to tell you how to do It safely or
without getting caught," the stu
dent said.
Robinson said the alcohol policy
is In line with the "basic approach
to student conduct" at the Univer
sity, as it places the individual
student In charge of his own be
havior and the consequences of
that behavior.
He stressed, however, that no
policy will stop a student from
drinking.
"The policy isn't going to
prevent somebody who wants to
get drunk from getting drunk,"
Robinson said. Regarding the
Dunshee case, Robinson said,
"Was it (the alcohol policy)
working that night? I don't
know." He added that more facts
on the case are needed before
policies can be re-evaluated.
The incident also calls into
question the University's Rush
policy, which was restructured
this year to include a week of par
ties without alcohol and special
cards that Rushees had to show
when entering parties.
Interfraternity Council Presi
dent Steve Singleton said the
Dunshee incident "will probably
definitely effect" Rush policies and
that the IFC will begin re
examining its present policy.
Tony Burgos, president of the
Delta Kappa Epsilon fraternity,
said he anticipates that Rush will
become alcohol-free next year.

"The first thing we see coming
is a dry Rush, but we don't see
that as a problem," Burgos said.
He added that he didn't expect
"any major thing to occur with the
(fraternity) system as a whole."
Charles Moody, Kappa Alpha
fraternity president, said he
"wouldn't be surprised" if there
was a mandatory dry Rush next
year.
The new policy, developed by the
IFC, seemed to be working well
until the revelation of the Dun
shee drowning.
Last week before Dunshee's
body was discovered, Conklin said
she was "very pleased with this
year's Rush."
Also likely to be called into ques
tion are the rules and regulations
for parties at the lake, according
to David Ligon, Boathouse
facilities manager.
"I'm sure it's going to be ex
amined. I'm not sure if it will be
changed," Ligon said.
Ligon said that he didn't think
the present rules were at fault in
this case.
Margaret Ann Fidler, associate
dean of Student Affairs, said the
rules should be reviewed, but "not
under an eye that there is any
thing necessarily wrong" with
them.
Fidler called the present rules
"very sound."
A contract containing Boat
house rules for parties by the lake
must be signed by groups wanting
to have a party there. While the
rules do not prohibit the con
sumption of alcohol by the lake,
they do state that "all parties must
have a designated sober monitor
to serve as liaison with Boathouse
staff and ensure that rules are fol
lowed."
Among the rules in the contract
are the University's party
guidelines and a policy prohibit
ing swimming during or after the
parties.
The drowning death of 20-year-old
junior David Dunshee last week in
Lagunita is causing University officials
to re-examine several policies, including
the University's alcohol policy, the fra
ternity Rush process and guidelines for
parties at Lagunita.
"I think everything will probably have
to be examined," said Norm Robinson,
acting dean of Student Affairs. He added
that "it's almost inevitable that the
(alcohol) policy will change."

was not of legal California drinking age,
