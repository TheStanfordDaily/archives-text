'Rock's moral leaders'

-9:16 p.m. — Expectant gazes
are rewarded with moving shapes
in the dimmed lights. Stagehands
frantically make last-minute ar
rangements. A hush falls.
Shadows begin to take shape in
the form of Bono. The Edge. Larry
Mullen Jr. and Adam Clayton.
Sound and lights explode In the
performance of "Where the Streets
Have No Name." The newly
released song springs to life in the
passionate pleas of Bono's voice.
Maintaining the tempo, the
group continues with "I Will Fol
low" — one of the earliest, most
easily recognizable anthems of the
group that is now touted as
"rock's moral leader" — and "Trip
Through Your Wires," a soul
searching exploration for the
limits of morality.
Now that the audience is com
pletely awed. Bono begins drawing
the listeners in. making them feel
truly needed and appreciated. He
states plainly. "The band and I
have found our way through
rock'n'roll music — you need to
find vour own wav. But even

though I've found my way. 1 still
haven't found what I'm looking
for."
Performing all of the songs off
their new album with the excep
tion of "Red Hill Mining Town"
and "One Tree Hill." the group in
cludes the many great hymns
which have become their
trademark. From "October" to
"Sunday. Bloody Sunday" and
"Pride (In the Name of Love)," the
standards keep the audience on
their feet throughout the concert.
During each number Bono plays
the crowd like a musical instru
ment. Where other performers
make sweeping motions to cause
the audience to clap along. Bono
moves a single hand. With a
Christ-like gesture of outstretched
hands he creates utter silence in
an stadium filled with thousands.
Without a word of command, he
gains complete control.
Bono dons an acoustic guitar
and the crowd is treated with the
band's rendition of an English
folksong called "Spring Hill Min
ing Disaster." The audience lis

tens with almost participatory at
tention to the all-too-true tale of
the English mining district. The
feeling of participation is intense
and not at all simply imagined.
During "Pride," Bono signals for
a young girl to come on the stage.
While the audience sings the
refrain, she reads from an Am
nesty International plug in a mag
azine.
Confirming once again the
band's belief that each person
should play a part in the reforma
tion of the world and the freedom
of the thousands of political
prisoners. Bono cries "It's not up)
to us (the members of the band).
It's up to you, too."
In the first encore, several for
tunate members of the audience,
including Stanford sophomore
Don Burdette, are brought on
stage to sing along with "Mothers
of the Disappeared."
11:05 p.m. — The house lights
raise slowly as the audience con
tinues singing along to "40." the
last song in the second and final
encore.


Bassist Adam Clayton looks
on as lead singer Bono per
forms during U2's two-hour
concert Saturday night at the
Cow Palace.


The Edge, U2's lead guitarist,
excites the audience with his
distinctive brand of bold,
jangling guitar rhythms.


Bono, whose passionate per
formance style and soaring
vocals have become a U2
trademark, didn't disappoint
the crowd Saturday night


Larry Mullen Jr.. whose hard-driving drumming holds the
band's music together onstage, is also a stabilizing presence
offstage. He is the founding member of U2.


As the concert ends at 11:05
p.m., the sellout crowd of
14.000 streams out of the
Cow Palace and into the
night
