### MARTHA MOODY Staff writer 
At least 35 Stanford students marched in San
Francisco Saturday as part of a bicoastal demonstra
tion against U.S. intervention in Central America
and the Caribbean, U.S. support of South African
apartheid, the nuclear arms race and unemploy
ment.
The demonstration, billed as the Mobilization for
Peace, Jobs and Justice, was held simultaneously in
San Francisco and Washington, D.C. According to
the Los Angeles Times, 30,000 people pai ticipated in
the San Francisco demonstration, while 75,000
people marched on Washington. D.C.
Initiated by a consortium of religious and labor
leaders, the march brought together a "broad spec
trum" of causes, according to Stanford demonstrator
Pat Jean-Pierre. The groups marched together be
cause they share a common concern that "by putting

conflicts into an East/West context, you're going to
bring an end to the world through nuclear war,"
Jean-Pierre said.
Mary Navarro, volunteer coordinator for the Palo
Alto-Stanford Medical Aid Committee for Central
America (PASMAC), said that 35 Stanford students
representing various campus groups attended the
demonstration. Besides the members of PASMAC,
students from Stanford Out of South Africa, Stan
ford Action for Nuclear Disarmament and the Stan
ford Student El Salvador Project marched in the
rally, she said.
The march began at Spear and Howard streets and
continued down Market Street to city hall, where the
demonstrators gathered to hear several speeches.
Stanford student Tom Lee said that one of the
most powerful speakers was a woman from a Central
American group called Comadres, whose children
have disappeared, presumably because of their poli
tical views.
