# Slate is in, Plan is out

### MONIQUE SCHEER Senior staff writer 
The Slate of the Union came out
65 votes ahead of The Plan in the
recount of ASSU election ballots
yesterday and will be in the runoff
against the Equalizers, according
to Elections Commissioner Brett
Jarvis.
However, the Administration
and Rules Committee will present
a bill to the ASSU Senate tomor
row recommending a new election
for the COP using a preferential
voting system.
Blaming the error in the first
tabulation of votes on the
Scantron machine used to count
the ballots, Jarvis said, "There will
definitely be some changes made
(in the election system)."
The elections commission
counted the ballots by hand twice
yesterday, coming up with 1,211
votes for the Slate of the Union
and 1,146 for The Plan.
In the original tabulation. The
Plan finished ahead of the Slate of
the Union, 1,115 votes to 1,062.
Jarvis said the discrepancy be
tween the original results and the
recount came from the fact that
many voters marked their choices
in ways that were illegible to the
Scantron machine but clear to the
human eye.
Some voters shaded in the
wrong ovals on the computerized

ballots, or shaded them too lightly
or with a pen. "It was still clearly a
vote for (a particular slate), but
the machine didn't read it." Jarvis
said.
Members of the Slate of the Un
ion were present at the recount,
for which they were required by
the ASSU bylaws to post a $250
bond. The money was retrievable
only in the event that they won.
"We're really glad we took the
risk," said Slate of the Union
member Grant Winfrey.
Members of The Plan were less
enthusiastic about the results of
the recount. "I can't say we're
overly thrilled." Lori Abert said.
The senate will vote today on a
bill from the Administration and
Rules Committee recommending
that 1) all the original election
results except for the COP be cer
tified by the senate and 2) the
runoff be canceled and new elec
tions for the COP be held using
the preferential voting system,
similar to that used in the senior
class presidents election.
At this point, new elections are
nothing more than a recommen
dation to the senate, but if they
are held, "the whole thing could be
settled by early Saturday morn
ing," Soukup said.
The Slate of the Union is not in
favor of a new election. "We'd
rather have a runoff." Winfrey
said. "We feel if it's obvious who

the person voted for you should
count it."
Abert said she thinks The Plan
would support a new election. "My
slate believes we'd really like an
other chance at it." she said.
Jarvis said there will definitely
be changes made in the way ASSU
elections are run. "Basically we
need to get a system that no voter
can screw up," he said.
"We will find a workable, fail
safe system." COP member Carey
White said. "There will never be
another ASSU election held using
this system and this machine. I
guarantee it."he said.
White said that a better system
is possible and that he knows of
other colleges that are able to
produce election results quickly
and accurately.
White and Jarvis both believe
that most of the problems with the
election have been the fault of the
machine used to count the ballots.
Jarvis also indicated that it would
not be used in future elections.
Jarvis said there is no chance
The Plan will ask for another
recount. "We've already counted
(the ballots) twice," he said.
Jarvis also said the fee assess
ments and the senate results will
remain uncontested. "I think
everything is accurate enough."
he said, but added that if there Is
a runoff for the COP the ballots
will be counted by hand.
