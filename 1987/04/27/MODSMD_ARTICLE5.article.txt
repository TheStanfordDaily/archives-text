# Nine arrested in protest
## 
### MARK LAWRENCE Senior staff writer 
Nine area residents were ar
rested peacefully Friday after they
climbed onto the roof of a Stan
ford research laboratory while pro
testing the use of animals in medi
cal and psychological research.
About 100 persons took part in
the demonstration, which focused
on research conducted by Dr.
Seymour Levine. professor of psy
chiatry and behavioral sciences.
Protesters said Levine's use of
monkeys in experiments on
mother-infant separation and fear
in infants is especially cruel and
repetitive of previous research.
Levine said the protest dis
rupted work in his l&b for the
entire day and charged that the
demonstrators had an "unen
lightened" view of his research,
which he said is breaking new
ground in the study of hormones
relating to stress.
The demonstration was a small

part of a nationwide "World Labo
ratory Animal Liberation Day."
More than 80 protesters were ar
rested peacefully at three other
university campuses in Califor
nia.
The Stanford protest began
when the demonstrators marched
from the Stanford Shopping Cen
ter to the office of University Presi
dent Donald Kennedy. There
animal rights activist Lisc Giraud.
a librarian in Green Library, read
a letter Kennedy had written in
response to a list of demands
issued earlier this month by the
Mid-Peninsula Animal Rights
Coalition.
The coalition had demanded an
eventual end to the use of animals
in research, unscheduled inspec
tions of laboratories by trained
people chosen by the animal
rights community, an end to the
use of lost or abandoned pets in
research, and an immediate end
to psychological experimentation
on animals. The coalition had also

requested that Stanford ask the
National Institutes of Health for
more money to develop research
techniques that do not harm
animals.
Kennedy said in the response
read by Giraud that vital research
cannot be performed "now or In
the forseeable future" without
animal subjects. "Abandoning re
search with animals would mean
foregoing new medical treatments
and cures, and would surely In
crease human and animal suffer
ing." Kennedy wrote.
Chanting "shame" and toting
black balloons, the protesters
then demonstrated briefly in front
of the Anatomy Building before
moving on to Levine's laboratory,
a one-story building located be
hind the Stanford Museum.
Police stopped several protesters
from climbing onto the roof of the
building, but nine people evaded

police and scrambled up trees and
fences onto the roof.
After about 30 minutes, police
went up to the roof and immedi
ately arrested the nine protesters;
none resisted, and all descended
by ladder. All of those arrested
were taken to a police substation
near Sunken Diamond, where
they were cited for trespassing
and then released.
Giraud said Saturday that
Levine's work is an especially vivid
example of cruel and useless
animal research. She criticized
two of Levine's experiments — one
project that involves placing boa
constrictors on top of monkeys'
cages to assess their fear and an
other that separates infant
monkeys from their mothers for
varying lengths of time to assess
the stress produced by the separa
tion.
"This is work that has been con
ducted since the '505." Giraud
said. "It's been conducted ad
nauseum. and It proves noth

tng. . . . It's objectionable from
every point of view."
Levlne said Saturday, however,
that his research on monkeys Is
advancing the study of hormones
relating to stress — research, he
said, that could have applications
to human life. He said his work is
providing a better understanding
of the stress children may feel
when they are frightened or left by
their parents at a daycare center.
Levlne said that although much
research has been done on the
overt effects of mother-infant
separation, his lab is one of very
few that Is investigating the bioc
hemical aspects of stress.
He said that the maximum time
mothers and infants are separated
is 24 hours, and that the average
time is six to eight hours, "less
time than humans and infants
spend In day care."
Levlne also defended his re
search with monkeys and snakes,
saying that the snake is placed in
a jar above the monkey cage, not
in the cage with the monkeys.
The two experiments that were
singled out by the protesters are
among four projects Levlne is con
ducting on a five-year, $3.5 mil

lion grant from the National In
stitutes of Health. The other two
experiments will yield information
on puberty and the role of the
central nervous system under
stress, Levine said.
Those arrested Friday were
Lorna Jaynes of Palo Alto, Sally
Klinke of Cupertino, Susan Wolfe
of San Jose, Nelly Davoust of Los
Altos, Robert Davis of Los Altos.
Franklin Hirsch of Los Altos, Viki
Markham of East Palo Alto, Cole
McFarland of San Rafael and an
18-year-old woman who was not
identified because of her age.
In a protest at UC-Berkeley, 49
persons, including three stu
dents, were arrested for trespass

UCLA police arrested 23
protesters who tried to take over
the office of Dr. Kenneth Shine,
dean of the school of medicine.
About 1,000 persons participated
in the demonstration there.

versity of California's veterinary

constrictors on top of monkeys'
cages to assess their fear and an
other that separates infant
monkeys from their mothers for
varying lengths of time to assess
the stress produced by the separa
tion.
"This is work that has been con
ducted since the '505." Giraud
said. "It's been conducted ad
nauseum. and It proves noth

tng. . . . It's objectionable from
every point of view."
Levlne said Saturday, however,
that his research on monkeys Is
advancing the study of hormones
relating to stress — research, he
said, that could have applications
to human life. He said his work is
providing a better understanding
of the stress children may feel
when they are frightened or left by
their parents at a daycare center.
Levlne said that although much
research has been done on the
overt effects of mother-infant
separation, his lab is one of very
few that Is investigating the bioc
hemical aspects of stress.
He said that the maximum time
mothers and infants are separated
is 24 hours, and that the average
time is six to eight hours, "less
time than humans and infants
spend In day care."
Levlne also defended his re
search with monkeys and snakes,
saying that the snake is placed in
a jar above the monkey cage, not
in the cage with the monkeys.
The two experiments that were
singled out by the protesters are
among four projects Levlne is con
ducting on a five-year, $3.5 mil

lion grant from the National In
stitutes of Health. The other two
experiments will yield information
on puberty and the role of the
central nervous system under
stress, Levine said.

In a protest at UC-Berkeley, 49
persons, including three stu
dents, were arrested for trespass
ing when they blocked the en
trance to an administration build
ing.
UCLA police arrested 23
protesters who tried to take over
the office of Dr. Kenneth Shine,
dean of the school of medicine.
About 1,000 persons participated
in the demonstration there.
At UC-Davis, home of the Uni
versity of California's veterinary
school, seven protesters were ar
rested for trespassing during a sit

Nine area residents were ar
rested peacefully Friday after they
climbed onto the roof of a Stan
ford research laboratory while pro
testing the use of animals in medi
cal and psychological research.
About 100 persons took part in
the demonstration, which focused
on research conducted by Dr.
Seymour Levine. professor of psy
chiatry and behavioral sciences.
Protesters said Levine's use of
monkeys in experiments on
mother-infant separation and fear
in infants is especially cruel and
repetitive of previous research.
Levine said the protest dis
rupted work in his l&b for the
entire day and charged that the
demonstrators had an "unen
lightened" view of his research,
which he said is breaking new
ground in the study of hormones
relating to stress.
The demonstration was a small

part of a nationwide "World Labo
ratory Animal Liberation Day."
More than 80 protesters were ar
rested peacefully at three other
university campuses in Califor
nia.
The Stanford protest began
when the demonstrators marched
from the Stanford Shopping Cen
ter to the office of University Presi
dent Donald Kennedy. There
animal rights activist Lisc Giraud.
a librarian in Green Library, read
a letter Kennedy had written in
response to a list of demands
issued earlier this month by the
Mid-Peninsula Animal Rights
Coalition.
The coalition had demanded an
eventual end to the use of animals
in research, unscheduled inspec
tions of laboratories by trained
people chosen by the animal
rights community, an end to the
use of lost or abandoned pets in
research, and an immediate end
to psychological experimentation
on animals. The coalition had also

requested that Stanford ask the
National Institutes of Health for
more money to develop research
techniques that do not harm
animals.
Kennedy said in the response
read by Giraud that vital research
cannot be performed "now or In
the forseeable future" without
animal subjects. "Abandoning re
search with animals would mean
foregoing new medical treatments
and cures, and would surely In
crease human and animal suffer
ing." Kennedy wrote.
Chanting "shame" and toting
black balloons, the protesters
then demonstrated briefly in front
of the Anatomy Building before
moving on to Levine's laboratory,
a one-story building located be
hind the Stanford Museum.

from climbing onto the roof of the

About 100 people took part in Friday's demonstration against Stanford Prof. Semour Levine's experi
ments on animals. Nine were arrested when they pushed past police and climbed onto a labratoiy roof.
police and scrambled up trees and
fences onto the roof.
After about 30 minutes, police
went up to the roof and immedi
ately arrested the nine protesters;
none resisted, and all descended
by ladder. All of those arrested
were taken to a police substation
near Sunken Diamond, where
they were cited for trespassing
and then released.
Giraud said Saturday that
Levine's work is an especially vivid
example of cruel and useless
animal research. She criticized
two of Levine's experiments — one
