Nine area residents were ar
rested peacefully Friday after they
climbed onto the roof of a Stan
ford research laboratory while pro
testing the use of animals in medi
cal and psychological research.
About 100 persons took part in
the demonstration, which focused
on research conducted by Dr.
Seymour Levine. professor of psy
chiatry and behavioral sciences.
Protesters said Levine's use of
monkeys in experiments on
mother-infant separation and fear
in infants is especially cruel and
repetitive of previous research.
Levine said the protest dis
rupted work in his l&b for the
entire day and charged that the
demonstrators had an "unen
lightened" view of his research,
which he said is breaking new
ground in the study of hormones
relating to stress.
The demonstration was a small

part of a nationwide "World Labo
ratory Animal Liberation Day."
More than 80 protesters were ar
rested peacefully at three other
university campuses in Califor
nia.
The Stanford protest began
when the demonstrators marched
from the Stanford Shopping Cen
ter to the office of University Presi
dent Donald Kennedy. There
animal rights activist Lisc Giraud.
a librarian in Green Library, read
a letter Kennedy had written in
response to a list of demands
issued earlier this month by the
Mid-Peninsula Animal Rights
Coalition.
The coalition had demanded an
eventual end to the use of animals
in research, unscheduled inspec
tions of laboratories by trained
people chosen by the animal
rights community, an end to the
use of lost or abandoned pets in
research, and an immediate end
to psychological experimentation
on animals. The coalition had also

requested that Stanford ask the
National Institutes of Health for
more money to develop research
techniques that do not harm
animals.
Kennedy said in the response
read by Giraud that vital research
cannot be performed "now or In
the forseeable future" without
animal subjects. "Abandoning re
search with animals would mean
foregoing new medical treatments
and cures, and would surely In
crease human and animal suffer
ing." Kennedy wrote.
Chanting "shame" and toting
black balloons, the protesters
then demonstrated briefly in front
of the Anatomy Building before
moving on to Levine's laboratory,
a one-story building located be
hind the Stanford Museum.
Police stopped several protesters
from climbing onto the roof of the
building, but nine people evaded
