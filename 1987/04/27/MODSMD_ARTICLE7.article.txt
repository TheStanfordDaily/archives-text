Brazilian finance minister quits
SAO PAULO, Brazil — The architect of Brazil's moratorium on
payment of Its foreign debts. Finance Minister Dilson Funaro, an
nounced his resignation last night, paving the way for Important
changes In President Jose Sarney's policies.
The shift could signal an early end to Brazil's confrontation with
foreign creditors and a an eventual rapprochement with the Inter
national Monetary Fund.
Funaro, 53, told a news conference that he had Informed the
ruling Brazilian Democratic Movement Party of his departure and
would formally resign after meeting with Sarney today. Predic
tions of the change have been forthcoming for almost two months,
as political support for Funaro's measures has withered.
A businessman and friend of the president, Funaro took over
Brazil's most powerful Cabinet post In September 1985. He
launched a bold anti-inflation program last year that produced do
mestic growth and an eventual balance-of-payments crisis. But It
did provide Sarney with important support just prior to congres
sional elections.
Funaro provoked widespread Irritation among creditors in
February when he announced the suspension of interest pay
ments on *68 billion worth of commercial loans and then insisted
on a renewal of lending by banks without offering domestic ad
justments in response. He rejected IMF monitoring and persuaded
Sarney to do the same.
In his talks with creditor governments, Funaro pressed the
ruling party's Insistence that they share responsibility for the debt
burden and that Brazil not sacrifice economic growth in order to
pay interest. But he lost the party's support when its younger fac
tion said his post-moratorium economic policies induced reces
sion.
Salvadoran aliens may get refuge
WASHINGTON — El Salvador's President Jose Napoleon Duarte
has asked President Reagan to bend the new U.S. immigration
law to provide temporary refuge for perhaps half a million Sal
vadorans who have entered this country Illegally, a State Depart
ment official confirmed yesterday.
The official, who asked to remain anonymous, said Duarte
argued In a letter to Reagan that deportation of the illegal immi
grants would further cripple the already limping Salvadoran eco
nomy because so many Salvadorans working here send money
home.
The bulk of the affected immigrants arrived in this country after
Jan. 1, 1982, the cutoff date for the amnesty extended to Illegal
immigrants under the Immigration Reform Act of 1986. The law
gives legal status to individuals able to prove that they have lived
here continuously since that date, but more recent arrivals face
deportation.
The official said that Duarte's letter maintained that political
conditions in El Salvador do not justify granting the immigrants
the status of refugees from persecution, but proposed instead that
their deportation be deferred by granting them a special status
called "Extended Voluntary Departure," known in government as
EVD. Such status can be granted to citizens of nations where
there is disorder, as well as persecution.
Holocaust memorial controversial
JERUSALEM — Yesterday was Holocaust Martyrs' and Heroes'
Remembrance Day, an annual day of mourning in Israel. Just to
the north of the Western Wall, Judaism's most revered site, a new
glass and stainless steel monument to the 6 million Jews who died
in Hitler's Europe spouted flames and water in their memory.
It has also spouted a heated controversy. On one side are the
colorful rabbi and flamboyant architect who commissioned and
built the new sculpture and who view it as their tribute to the
Jewish spirit. On the other are art critics and other prominent
residents who consider it a crass travesty that demeans the most
tragic and horrific event in modern Jewish history as well as the
holy site it overlooks.
Tamar Goldschmidt, art adviser to Mayor Teddy Kollek, called
the sculpture "ugly and tasteless kitsch." Amos Elon, the noted Is
raeli author and journalist, compared it to the famous smoking
advertisement in New York's Times Square. Its builders, he sug
gested, should be behind bars because they neglected to obtain
the necessary city permits before constructing it.
In response, Shlorno Goren, the former chief Ashkenazi rabbi of
Israel who commissioned the sculpture, calls his opponents "a
very few noisy people" who are his long-time enemies and are
jealous of the monument's designer, Yaacov Agam. "When you do
something new, you have to be ready for criticism," he said.
Chernobyl: A result of blunders
WASHINGTON — One year after the Chernobyl nuclear disaster,
the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission has concluded that the
causes of the Soviet accident have little direct bearing on the
safety of U.S. nuclear power plants, but they serve as yet another
reminder that complacency is dangerous with a technology as un
forgiving as nuclear power.
Based on detailed reports that the Soviet Union has supplied to
the International Atomic Energy Agency in Vienna, government
and industry analysts have concluded that the accident April 26,
1986, was the unique product of egregious blunders by Soviet
operators and a novel reactor design with inherently dangerous
features that would have been unacceptable in the West.
"People think there Is no clear-cut nexus between the specific
occurrence of this accident and our plants," Harold Denton, a
senior official of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission.
Yet, Denton noted, while "that particular accident can't happen
(in the United States), it does not say that we can't have severe
accidents. . . . This is basically a hazardous technology if not
properly operated. This means you have to have discipline in the
control room, detailed procedures and a knowledgeable staff that
doesn't go bypassing safety systems in the dark of the night to run
a test."
Study links welfare to education
SACRAMENTO — Examining the link between education and
welfare dependency, a new California study has found that more
(ban half of the state's aid recipients lack the basic skills that
would enable them to find and keep a job.
The state, undertaking what Is believed to be the nation's most
extensive literacy testing of welfare recipients, found that 57 per
cent of those surveyed needed remedial education in reading,
writing or math.
"The welfare system Is a holding area for people who did not get
a good enough education." said Carl Williams, a Department of
Social Services deputy director who heads the state's new
Workfare program. "The message Is pretty clear that we have one
heck of a population out there that's In need of remediation."
The study, released last week, gives officials concrete evidence
that the educational needs of welfare recipients are far greater
than they had anticipated when the Workfare program began. It Is
also likely to focus attention on the shortcomings of the state's
school system and make education a top priority In the effort to
get recipients off public aid.

Brazilian finance minister quits
SAO PAULO, Brazil — The architect of Brazil's moratorium on
payment of Its foreign debts. Finance Minister Dilson Funaro, an
nounced his resignation last night, paving the way for Important
changes In President Jose Sarney's policies.
The shift could signal an early end to Brazil's confrontation with
foreign creditors and a an eventual rapprochement with the Inter
national Monetary Fund.
Funaro, 53, told a news conference that he had Informed the
ruling Brazilian Democratic Movement Party of his departure and
would formally resign after meeting with Sarney today. Predic
tions of the change have been forthcoming for almost two months,
as political support for Funaro's measures has withered.
A businessman and friend of the president, Funaro took over
Brazil's most powerful Cabinet post In September 1985. He
launched a bold anti-inflation program last year that produced do
mestic growth and an eventual balance-of-payments crisis. But It
did provide Sarney with important support just prior to congres
sional elections.
Funaro provoked widespread Irritation among creditors in
February when he announced the suspension of interest pay
ments on *68 billion worth of commercial loans and then insisted
on a renewal of lending by banks without offering domestic ad
justments in response. He rejected IMF monitoring and persuaded
Sarney to do the same.
In his talks with creditor governments, Funaro pressed the
ruling party's Insistence that they share responsibility for the debt
burden and that Brazil not sacrifice economic growth in order to
pay interest. But he lost the party's support when its younger fac
tion said his post-moratorium economic policies induced reces
sion.
Salvadoran aliens may get refuge
WASHINGTON — El Salvador's President Jose Napoleon Duarte
has asked President Reagan to bend the new U.S. immigration
law to provide temporary refuge for perhaps half a million Sal
vadorans who have entered this country Illegally, a State Depart
ment official confirmed yesterday.
The official, who asked to remain anonymous, said Duarte
argued In a letter to Reagan that deportation of the illegal immi
grants would further cripple the already limping Salvadoran eco
nomy because so many Salvadorans working here send money
home.
The bulk of the affected immigrants arrived in this country after
Jan. 1, 1982, the cutoff date for the amnesty extended to Illegal
immigrants under the Immigration Reform Act of 1986. The law
gives legal status to individuals able to prove that they have lived
here continuously since that date, but more recent arrivals face
deportation.
The official said that Duarte's letter maintained that political
conditions in El Salvador do not justify granting the immigrants
the status of refugees from persecution, but proposed instead that
their deportation be deferred by granting them a special status
called "Extended Voluntary Departure," known in government as
EVD. Such status can be granted to citizens of nations where
there is disorder, as well as persecution.
Holocaust memorial controversial
JERUSALEM — Yesterday was Holocaust Martyrs' and Heroes'
Remembrance Day, an annual day of mourning in Israel. Just to
the north of the Western Wall, Judaism's most revered site, a new
glass and stainless steel monument to the 6 million Jews who died
in Hitler's Europe spouted flames and water in their memory.
It has also spouted a heated controversy. On one side are the
colorful rabbi and flamboyant architect who commissioned and
built the new sculpture and who view it as their tribute to the
Jewish spirit. On the other are art critics and other prominent
residents who consider it a crass travesty that demeans the most
tragic and horrific event in modern Jewish history as well as the
holy site it overlooks.
Tamar Goldschmidt, art adviser to Mayor Teddy Kollek, called
the sculpture "ugly and tasteless kitsch." Amos Elon, the noted Is
raeli author and journalist, compared it to the famous smoking
advertisement in New York's Times Square. Its builders, he sug
gested, should be behind bars because they neglected to obtain
the necessary city permits before constructing it.
In response, Shlorno Goren, the former chief Ashkenazi rabbi of
Israel who commissioned the sculpture, calls his opponents "a
very few noisy people" who are his long-time enemies and are
jealous of the monument's designer, Yaacov Agam. "When you do
something new, you have to be ready for criticism," he said.
Chernobyl: A result of blunders
WASHINGTON — One year after the Chernobyl nuclear disaster,
the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission has concluded that the
causes of the Soviet accident have little direct bearing on the
safety of U.S. nuclear power plants, but they serve as yet another
reminder that complacency is dangerous with a technology as un
forgiving as nuclear power.
Based on detailed reports that the Soviet Union has supplied to
the International Atomic Energy Agency in Vienna, government
and industry analysts have concluded that the accident April 26,
1986, was the unique product of egregious blunders by Soviet
operators and a novel reactor design with inherently dangerous
features that would have been unacceptable in the West.
"People think there Is no clear-cut nexus between the specific
occurrence of this accident and our plants," Harold Denton, a
senior official of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission.
Yet, Denton noted, while "that particular accident can't happen
(in the United States), it does not say that we can't have severe
accidents. . . . This is basically a hazardous technology if not
properly operated. This means you have to have discipline in the
control room, detailed procedures and a knowledgeable staff that
doesn't go bypassing safety systems in the dark of the night to run
a test."
Study links welfare to education
SACRAMENTO — Examining the link between education and
welfare dependency, a new California study has found that more
(ban half of the state's aid recipients lack the basic skills that
would enable them to find and keep a job.
The state, undertaking what Is believed to be the nation's most
extensive literacy testing of welfare recipients, found that 57 per
cent of those surveyed needed remedial education in reading,
writing or math.
"The welfare system Is a holding area for people who did not get
a good enough education." said Carl Williams, a Department of
Social Services deputy director who heads the state's new
Workfare program. "The message Is pretty clear that we have one
heck of a population out there that's In need of remediation."
The study, released last week, gives officials concrete evidence
that the educational needs of welfare recipients are far greater
than they had anticipated when the Workfare program began. It Is
also likely to focus attention on the shortcomings of the state's
school system and make education a top priority In the effort to
get recipients off public aid.
