# Working to improve relations
## Soviets active in Middle East 
### 
AMMAN. Jordan — Long forced into a sub
sidiary role behind the United States in the
Middle East, the Soviet Union is taking major
strides to improve its standing in the region,
according to Arab officials and Western
diplomats.
The success of a Palestinian reconciliation
meeting in Algiers this weekend was carefully
brokered with the help of the Soviets and is
but the latest Soviet advance in the area, ac
cording to Arab officials.
While the overall impact of the reconciliation
talks is still hard to gauge, according to West
ern diplomats, it is clear that the Kremlin will
now have far greater influence in the Palestine
Liberation Organization than in the recent
past.
New signs of the Soviet Union's increasing
concern about the Middle East also emerged
over the weekend, following a visit to Moscow
by Syrian President Hafez Assad.
Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev, while as
suring Syria of continuing support in the mili
tary field, gave the strongest indication yet
that the Soviets are prepared to resume
diplomatic relations with Israel, which were
severed in 1967 after the Six Day War.
Speaking about diplomatic ties with Israel,
Gorbachev said, "The absence of such rela
tions cannot be considered normal."
Arab officials are predicting that, as early as
June, the Soviets will establish consular ties
with Israel while at the same time allowing up
to 20,000 Soviet Jews to emigrate as part of
the bargain.
Another Soviet initiative frequently men
tioned by diplomats and Arab officials was the

decision by Moscow to forgive debt payments
by Egypt on military purchases.
The move was notable because the Soviets
are still demanding payments from Syria,
which is widely considered to be Moscow's
closest Arab ally. By easing Egypt's payments
problem, the Soviets have undoubtedly risked
strained relations with Damascus, illustrating
how much importance Moscow now places on
improving relations with Cairo.
The Soviet move was also notable because
the United States and Western financial insti
tutions have been unyielding in their demands
that Cairo meet its financial obligations,
giving the appearance that the Soviet Union is
more flexible than Egypt's supposed allies in
the West.
On a broader scale, the Soviets have won
considerable admiration in the Arab world by
consistently supporting the notion of an inter
national conference to settle the Arab-Israeli
dispute.
Jordan, which has been actively promoting
the conference idea, has blamed Israel and the
United States for blocking such a conference,
which would be attended by, among others,
the five permanent members of the U.N. Secur
ity Council — the United States, the Soviet Un
ion, Britain, France and China.
The Soviets have also recently undertaken
initiatives to settle the long-running Iran-Iraq
War, an issue of considerable concern to
moderate, pro-Western Arab countries in the
Persian Gulf region.
In contrast, the Reagan administration is
still suffering from loss of credibility owing to
disclosures about American arms shipments

to Iran in the last two years.
American policy in the region is also in dis
array because of the failure to deliver on
promised arms sales to moderate Arab states
such as Jordan and Kuwait. The countries
have turned to the Soviet Union and Western
Europe as their primary arms suppliers.
"The less cooperative the Americans are. the
greater the role that can be played by the Soviet
Union," one Western diplomat said.
The meeting of the Palestine National Coun
cil in Algiers over the weekend provided con
siderable evidence of the Soviet Union's new
influence in the area.
The Soviets reportedly provided the initial
encouragement for a rapprochement following
the breakdown of talks between Jordan's King
Hussein and the PLO's Yasser Arafat in
February, 1986. The two leaders signed an
agreement in 1985 to seek joint negotiations
with Israel, but the arrangement collapsed
when Arafat refused to endorse U.N. Security
Council Resolutions 242 and 338, which guar
antee Israel's right to exist within secure
boundaries.
Having set the reconciliation in motion, the
Soviets reportedly exerted extreme pressure on
two radical factions — the Democratic Front
for the Liberation of Palestine led by Nayef
Hawatmeh and the Popular Front for the
Liberation of Palestine led by George Habash
— to moderate their demands on Arafat.
Hawatmeh and Habash had settled ifi
Damascus after a bitter schism in 1983 left the
PLO scattered throughout much of the Arab
world.
