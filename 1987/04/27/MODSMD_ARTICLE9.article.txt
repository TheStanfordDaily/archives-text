The poor performance of black schoolchildren can
often be traced to the disturbing dichotomy between
their education and their personal experience, ac
cording to poet Arniri Baraka. the keynote speaker at
Saturday's symposium, "Black America: Breaking
the Bonds of Our Miseducation."
"Education is the rationalization of human experi
ence for use in social development," said Baraka,
who teaches at the State University of New York at
Stony Brook. "One cannot be educated by ignoring
one's real experience and trying to rationalize — i.e..
making sense of someone else's experience as a cover
for your own.
"It's why our children begin to fail in the third
grade." he said. "The gradually widening gap be
tween their real experience and anti-scientific train
ing based on white supremacy and the needs of a
divorced minority to exploit the world leaves them
alienated, miseducated or, mostly, uneducated, and
continually enslaved."
The 10-hour symposium was attended by repre
sentatives of colleges and universities around the na
tion who are committed to changing the direction of
American education at all levels of study.
The symposium, which was held at the Stanford
Law School and co-sponsored by the Stanford Black
Law Students Association (BLSA) and the

African/Black Student Statewide Alliance (A/BSSA),
•was held for the following purposes:
□ "To recognize and understand the struggles for
changing education in this country to make it more
relevant to Third World peoples, specifically black
people."
□ "To link up with other campus and community
motions to improve the quality of our education."
□ "To make concrete demands for change."
□ "To learn how to implement plans for change
through sustained struggle."
In addition to Baraka's address, the conference
featured a morning panel entitled "Education as a
Tool for Socialization, Oppression and Change" and
three afternoon workshops focusing on ways to
strengthen the fight for a quality education.
The symposium centered around concrete con
cerns, including the acquisition of more tenured
black faculty and a more representative proportion of
black students at American universities and col
leges.
But it also addressed more general issues, such as
the oppression of blacks socially, economically, poli
tically and artistically by the "fascist" elements of
capitalist society.
Baraka characterized the cyclical gains and losses
of the struggle for education and liberation as "the
struggle of the black Sisyphus" and condemned the
Reagan administration for its efforts to roll the
mythical stone back down the mountain.
