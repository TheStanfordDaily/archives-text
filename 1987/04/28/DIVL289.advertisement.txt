Rowel I
Speaking on his experiences as a photographer,
conservationist and mountain climber.
Mr. Rowell has pioneered a special brand of participatory
landscape photography, in which the photographer is a
direct participant in the events being photographed. In
1984, he received the Ansel Adams Award for his
contributions to the art of wilderness photography.
Mr. Rowel I's most recent book, Mountain Light, utilizes a
combination of imagination, action, and understanding of
nature to create spectacular images he calls "dynamic
landscapes"
The multi-media presentation includes slides
and documents the historical, geological and
geographical distinctions of one of the most
remote regions of the world.
