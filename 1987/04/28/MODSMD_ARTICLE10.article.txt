### DIANE BISGEIER Senior staff writer With wire reports 
Observance of "Pioneer Days" at Chico State Uni
versity resulted in the arrest of 37 persons who were
among those throwing bottles, rocks and beer cans
and burning furniture in downtown Chico Friday
night.
Chico officials believe much of the disturbance was
caused not by students but rather by people from out
of town. "Of the arrests made Friday night, about
half were people from out of town and the other half
were Chico residents, but not necessarily students,"
said Kevin Mansfield. Chico Police dispatcher.
In addition to the arrests. Chico hospitals treated
32 people for injuries.
As a result of this weekend's Incidents, Chico State
University President Robin Wilson announced the
likely cancellation of "Pioneer Days" for the next few
years.
"The President said that as far as he's concerned
the university will not sponsor or have any part of
Pioneer Days,' " said Robert Pentzer of the Chico
Public Affairs Office.
Out-of-towners were attracted to the celebration by
Chico's rating as the No. 1 party school by Playboy
magazine and MTV, said Joe Rojas of the university
police. "People in town believe that It's mostly
outside people who don't care about the town." he
said.
Neither the university nor Chico Police have as
sessed the extent of the damage. "I would venture to

say that the Insurance companies are not going to be
too happy." Rojas said.
In addition to flying objects, there was a bonfire
fueled by couches and chairs in the town's main in
tersection. Most windows In the city's businesses
were broken. "It's those kinds of things that get out
of hand," said Mansfield, who explained that Chlco
Police had to call in backup assistance from districts
as far south as Sacramento and as far north as the
Oregon border.
"This year's celebration was worse than those of
the last two years." said Rojas. who recounted an in
cident where an ambulance was unable to get
through the mob to assist an injured woman.
"People were getting hurt that weren't even in
volved."
According to Pentzer, the university will no longer
sponsor events such as competitions and skits or
provide facilities, including a western town, for
"Pioneer Days."
University officials shortened "Pioneer Week" to
"Pioneer Days" in order to prevent interference with
student's academics, Rojas said. "The week started
with a 'keg-off on Friday and continued until the fol
lowing Saturday. It created quite a bit of drunken
ness and failure to attend class," Rojas said.
The Old West festival that was originally scheduled
to continue next weekend was canceled because of
the disruption.
Similar festivities called "College Days" at Colorado
State University led to the arrest of at least 56 per
sons and more than 50 injured people, including
four police officers, according to Lt. Bud Reed of the
Fort Collins Police Department.
Unlike the Chico incident, the one at Colorado
State was not an annual one, although a similar
event took place just last year.
"The word was that there would be a party at the
Baystone area and that is basically how it got
started," Reed said.
Colorado State revelers incurred only "moderate
damage" according to Reed.
Both incidents involved bonfires and objects such
as bottles and cans being thrown in the air. "It's
scary when you've got a couple thousand people in
one city block," Pentzer said.
