Just when you thought it was safe to forget
about the ASSU. . . .
The ASSU Senate yesterday voted to hold a
new election for the Council of Presidents of
fice. This is a stupid idea.
It's a stupid idea for a lot of reasons. A new
election is unfair to the Equalizers, unfair to
the Slate of the Union and — most impor
tantly — unfair to the voters. A new election
makes a mockery of the entire electoral
process. And a new election only reinforces
the idea, already entrenched in the minds of
many students, that the ASSU is incom
petent.
Last week, the Slate of the Union asked for
a recount because its margin of defeat was
less than 5 percent. After posting a #250
bond — something they shouldn't have had
to do, but that's another story — they got
their recount. The ASSU Elections Commis
sion counted the ballots twice, and the Slate
of the Union came out ahead of the Plan slate
both times.
The voters have spoken, and the verd'ct is
in. There's no reason for another election.
The fact that the Slate of the Union received
more votes than the Plan is clear.
The next logical step is to hold a runoff be
tween the two slates with the largest num
bers of votes — namely, the Equalizers and
the Slate of the Union. Unless the ASSU Elec
tions Commission can find that something

was wrong with the way ballots were cast,
there is no justifiable reason to invalidate
them.
The ASSU Elections Commission, in ex
plaining the ASSU decison to call another
COP election, has hinted that some of the
candidates may have violated election rules.
It refuses, however, to explain the circum
stances of these supposed "violations."
Election fraud is a serious charge. If the
ASSU feels the violations are grave enough to
warrant a new election, some kind of open
hearing of the facts is needed. Vague
suspicions are not enough.
In addition, the way the new election will
be held is also stupid. Voters will be asked to
"rank" slates in order of preference. While
this system may make things easier for the
ASSU by eliminating the possibility of a
runoff, it's not very democratic. Whatever
happened to the "one person, one vote"
ideal? Students should vote for the slate of
their choice, not rank the slates in order of
preference. This is an election, not a market
research survey.
Thus far, the ASSU Elections Commission
has proven neither that the twice-counted
results of the COP race are invalid, nor that
any candidate misconduct occurred. Unless
the ASSU is prepared to come up with hard
evidence, it has no right to nullify the results
of a legitimate student election.
