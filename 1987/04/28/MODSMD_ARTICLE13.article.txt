I would like to thank all of those
who supported the Jorge
Valasquez ASSU Senate cam
paign In the recent elections.
Although 298 write-in votes were
not enough to win a seat, some-

thing significant came about
from the election in the fact that
this many people remembered
and wrote in a name that was not
in front of them on the ballot.
For some reason, 298 people
felt that someone running on a
platform of "needing a good
resume" and building a bowling
alley on the second floor of Sweet
Hall would be at least as effective
as others promising everything
from better doctors at Cowell to
more change machines.

Anyway, I think that the Uni
versity should be required to
install hot tubs every 200 yards.
Forget the change machines.
Fortunately, from my present
standpoint, I will be able to more
effectively carry out my promise
that I will do nothing of signifi
cance in the senate next term. No
doubt, other senators will try to
copy. They usually do.
