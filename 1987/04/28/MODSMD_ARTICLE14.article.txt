# Blacks feel unwanted
## 
### 
I've put off writing for as long as any responsible
progressive person can In good conscience. The
vociferous and vicious response of members of the
Stanford faculty have sent me reeling with surprise
and pain. The Dally editorial board's recent editorial
(Dally, April 20) and the column by Daily Managing
Editor David Risser (Daily, April 17) have given me
cause to wonder if these are the same people that
wrote the editorial about the persistence of racism
(Daily, Jan. 16) or if they really understood my
message on Martin Luther King Jr.'s birthday.

Finally, the column by Scott Lyon (Daily, April 20)
— who might be excused by his youth — and the let
ter from Adam Lleberman, a research assistant at
Hoover (Daily, April 20), have pushed me over the
edge. These Individuals are sending me, women and
all people of color a message that says loud and clear:
"Niggers go home."
That was the battle cry at Howard Beach, N.Y., and
that is what the Klan puts out everyday. "We don't
want you or your kind challenging our
predominance or supremacy." Now, I do not say
these words lightly. They are strong words, angry
words — but truth is not always a balm. Sometimes
it must cut like a knife.
Why do I feel unwanted and unappreciated as a
black woman at this University? Let's take the argu
ments one at a time. First, The Dally has intimated
that, by mandating the study of at least one culture
outside the European family of cultures, the Area
One Task Force has forgotten the real purpose of the
area one requirement — namely, to teach students to
think critically.
Does this mean that looking at Haiti and France,
for instance, and the French Revolution will some
how disallow students to learn how to analyze works
or that their previously conceived notions will not be
challenged? What is it about the works of non-
Europeans that make them inferior to the works of
Western Europeans?
I think that students will be challenged to think
harder and more critically about the world around
them and the themes that their tracks treat if they
study Western European culture through contrast
and comparison with traditions outside of it. How
white something looks when placed side by side with
something black.
Critics may say that was not their intention. But I
question that. Perhaps The Daily editorial board
members did not consciously think through the im
plications of their statements, but they are respon
sible for their editorial's impact and implicit conclu
sions.
Subtly, their own educational processes — of
which Western Culture classes are a part — have
taught them to believe that the works of European
white men are those most worthy of study, consider
ation and debate. The other literatures and histories
of women. American minorities or Third World
peoples are peripheral. These works, through a
process of natural selection, are non-existent or In
significant to the course of human advancement.
Lleberman probably stated It best when he
proclaimed that "Africa has no Dante; Latin America
no Homer." We. the non-Western Europeans, have
no greatness, no culture, no explanations, no
beauty, perhaps no humanity. "Niggers go home."
Second, others have argued that the faculty, as ed
ucated and scholarly as thev are, lack the academic

backgrounds to teach an Area One course that re
quires students to consider one culture outside the
European family of cultures.
Lyon and the editorial expressed profound concern
over the feasibility and integrity of material that men
of the stature of Profs. Ronald Rebholz and William
Chace cannot teach. The edltoral even went so far as
to say that the Area One might become a "ghetto of
unproven junior faculty." Interesting word usage
aside, this view is insidiously racist. It presumes
that those able to teach in a program along the lines
of the proposal would be Inferior to those unable to
teach in it precisely because they have a knowledge of
both cultures within the European family and one or
more outside of it.
Again — why is the study of non-Western
Europeans stigmatized? Why do not our highly es
teemed professors seek to team-teach with others
perhaps more versed in an area where they are
weak? Prof. Chace might have a difficult time teach
ing VTSS, as well, by himself. But not if he looked to
his colleagues in the sciences or the history of sci
ence for help.
Furthermore, if there are not enough professors or
lecturers presently to teach in the program as con
ceived by the task force, then we surely have the
funds to hire them. We are engaging in a *1 billion
fund-raising effort in honor of the University's cen
tennial. Perhaps a portion could be targetted for the
program.
This will perhaps give us reason to reflect on the
education that Prof. Chace, et al., received. Did they
have a coursework that demanded the study of a cul
ture outside the European family? Were there even
courses or departments existing that considered the
world outside of Western Europe at their undergrad
uate institutions? I think not. Did most Americans
in their generation have the opportunity to study
women's history or African history? No, but this Uni
versity has the obligation- to encourage and facilitate
our doing so. What was life like for African-
Americans then? To what extent did sexism pervade
our society, warping the lives and dreams of women?
Through Immense social turmoil and struggle we
tried to change society in the '60s and '70s and
moved a step forward In making real the sentiments
of the Declaration of Independence. We can now
either help to further that process or contribute to its
stagnation and reversal.
I made a plea for a rainbow Stanford and America
on Jan. 15, 1987 at the Black Student Union's com
memoration of King. Many people stood up to ap
plaud the Idea in the abstract. Won't you come for
ward and stand now In the particular? We belong
here — in the classroom, on the faculty, on the
decision-making bodies and in the curriculum. All of
us have a right to be here and to wield power in
making decisions that influence our lives.
I'm not scared to fight for that because I come from
an American tradition that includes Harriet Tubman
and Sojourner Truth, both ex-slave women who died
fighting for my right to self-realization and the right
of all of us to a just society.
"Niggers go home" isn't anything new. But let's put
It to rest on this campus for good by writing letters to
The Dally and the Faculty Senate. I began this letter
furious and end It hopeful that, if nothing else, at
least the students of our generation of various races
can stand together and push forward the community
despite those who would have us stand still or go
backward to the days of old.

women's history or African history? No, but this Uni
versity has the obligation- to encourage and facilitate
our doing so. What was life like for African-
Americans then? To what extent did sexism pervade
our society, warping the lives and dreams of women?
Through Immense social turmoil and struggle we
tried to change society in the '60s and '70s and
moved a step forward In making real the sentiments
of the Declaration of Independence. We can now
either help to further that process or contribute to its
stagnation and reversal.
I made a plea for a rainbow Stanford and America
on Jan. 15, 1987 at the Black Student Union's com
memoration of King. Many people stood up to ap
plaud the Idea in the abstract. Won't you come for
ward and stand now In the particular? We belong
here — in the classroom, on the faculty, on the
decision-making bodies and in the curriculum. All of
us have a right to be here and to wield power in
making decisions that influence our lives.
I'm not scared to fight for that because I come from
an American tradition that includes Harriet Tubman
and Sojourner Truth, both ex-slave women who died
fighting for my right to self-realization and the right
of all of us to a just society.
"Niggers go home" isn't anything new. But let's put
It to rest on this campus for good by writing letters to
The Dally and the Faculty Senate. I began this letter
furious and end It hopeful that, if nothing else, at
least the students of our generation of various races
can stand together and push forward the community
despite those who would have us stand still or go
backward to the days of old.

I've put off writing for as long as any responsible
progressive person can In good conscience. The
vociferous and vicious response of members of the
Stanford faculty have sent me reeling with surprise
and pain. The Dally editorial board's recent editorial
(Dally, April 20) and the column by Daily Managing
Editor David Risser (Daily, April 17) have given me
cause to wonder if these are the same people that
wrote the editorial about the persistence of racism
(Daily, Jan. 16) or if they really understood my
message on Martin Luther King Jr.'s birthday.

Finally, the column by Scott Lyon (Daily, April 20)
— who might be excused by his youth — and the let
ter from Adam Lleberman, a research assistant at
Hoover (Daily, April 20), have pushed me over the
edge. These Individuals are sending me, women and
all people of color a message that says loud and clear:
"Niggers go home."
That was the battle cry at Howard Beach, N.Y., and
that is what the Klan puts out everyday. "We don't
want you or your kind challenging our
predominance or supremacy." Now, I do not say
these words lightly. They are strong words, angry
words — but truth is not always a balm. Sometimes
it must cut like a knife.
Why do I feel unwanted and unappreciated as a
black woman at this University? Let's take the argu
ments one at a time. First, The Dally has intimated
that, by mandating the study of at least one culture
outside the European family of cultures, the Area
One Task Force has forgotten the real purpose of the
area one requirement — namely, to teach students to
think critically.
Does this mean that looking at Haiti and France,
for instance, and the French Revolution will some
how disallow students to learn how to analyze works
or that their previously conceived notions will not be
challenged? What is it about the works of non-
Europeans that make them inferior to the works of
Western Europeans?
I think that students will be challenged to think
harder and more critically about the world around
them and the themes that their tracks treat if they
study Western European culture through contrast
and comparison with traditions outside of it. How
white something looks when placed side by side with
something black.
Critics may say that was not their intention. But I
question that. Perhaps The Daily editorial board
members did not consciously think through the im
plications of their statements, but they are respon
sible for their editorial's impact and implicit conclu
sions.
Subtly, their own educational processes — of
which Western Culture classes are a part — have
taught them to believe that the works of European
white men are those most worthy of study, consider
ation and debate. The other literatures and histories
of women. American minorities or Third World
peoples are peripheral. These works, through a
process of natural selection, are non-existent or In
significant to the course of human advancement.
Lleberman probably stated It best when he
proclaimed that "Africa has no Dante; Latin America
no Homer." We. the non-Western Europeans, have
no greatness, no culture, no explanations, no
beauty, perhaps no humanity. "Niggers go home."
Second, others have argued that the faculty, as ed
ucated and scholarly as thev are, lack the academic

backgrounds to teach an Area One course that re
quires students to consider one culture outside the
European family of cultures.
Lyon and the editorial expressed profound concern
over the feasibility and integrity of material that men
of the stature of Profs. Ronald Rebholz and William
Chace cannot teach. The edltoral even went so far as
to say that the Area One might become a "ghetto of
unproven junior faculty." Interesting word usage
aside, this view is insidiously racist. It presumes
that those able to teach in a program along the lines
of the proposal would be Inferior to those unable to
teach in it precisely because they have a knowledge of
both cultures within the European family and one or
more outside of it.
Again — why is the study of non-Western
Europeans stigmatized? Why do not our highly es
teemed professors seek to team-teach with others
perhaps more versed in an area where they are
weak? Prof. Chace might have a difficult time teach
ing VTSS, as well, by himself. But not if he looked to
his colleagues in the sciences or the history of sci
ence for help.
Furthermore, if there are not enough professors or
lecturers presently to teach in the program as con
ceived by the task force, then we surely have the
funds to hire them. We are engaging in a *1 billion
fund-raising effort in honor of the University's cen
tennial. Perhaps a portion could be targetted for the
program.
This will perhaps give us reason to reflect on the
education that Prof. Chace, et al., received. Did they
have a coursework that demanded the study of a cul
ture outside the European family? Were there even
courses or departments existing that considered the
world outside of Western Europe at their undergrad
uate institutions? I think not. Did most Americans
in their generation have the opportunity to study
women's history or African history? No, but this Uni
versity has the obligation- to encourage and facilitate
our doing so. What was life like for African-
Americans then? To what extent did sexism pervade
