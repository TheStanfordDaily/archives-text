# Don't 'Just Say No'
## 
### 
Once I spent an afternoon stuffing envelopes at the
Hoover Institution. I was mailing leaflets on SDI.
Believe it or not, I got a paper cut and proceeded to
bleed on the envelope of the Honorable Edwin Meese
111. They gave me a Band-Aid. It was all worth it be
cause of a wonderful comment someone at the office
made. I quote: "It's harder to get a good education at
a liberal university." Harder, that is, than at a con
servative institution.

Now my Idea of a conservative school is Oral
Roberts University. The degree I'm working toward is
in the liberal arts. There is no such thing as the con
servative arts.
The opinion of this person at Hoover is one side of
the multifaceted question of the teaching of ethics.
At Stanford, you see this issue in the attempts to
reform the Western Culture program, which I'll talk
more about later. In elementary and secondary
schools, you can see how confused the teaching of
ethics is by the "Just Say No" campaign.
The "Just Say No" movement originated, I believe,
in speeches made by Nancy Reagan. It then spread
into the schools. The slogan itself is an interesting
twist on the history of the word "no." Through the
ages, saying no has been the first and ultimate act of
rebellion. The First Lady seems to have switched
things neatly around. Starting with the idea that
people use drugs to rebel, by "just saying no" you can
get the feeling of rebellion while maintaining social
order. This does seem to be the Reagan administra
tion's "moral equivalent of war."
As an educational program aimed at young
children, "Just Say No" focuses on teaching them to
refuse specific substances or acts In specific situa
tions. This reminds me of the see-and-say method of
teaching people how to read, a method notorious for
producing slow readers — even Illiterates. The other
teaching method, phonics, trains children to put to
gether sounds and letters and so on, which prepares
them to read any text — not just the page of con
trolled and limited content before them.
So while "Just Say No" has its obvious merits of
keeping children physically sound, its effectiveness
as a means of teaching moral decision-making is
doubtful. I would guess that the kids in "Just Say
No" clubs aren't very likely to grow up to "just say no"
to the MX missile. The kids are being taught to con
form to a safe standard of behavior. And how will
they decide when to ever say yes to anything?
The politically conservative who claim to be inter
ested in the teaching of ethics simply want to ensure
that their values are transmitted to the younger gen
eration. The last thing they want to question is the
educational process. So really a conservative school
would be engaged in indoctrination — not educa
tion.
Whether or not right-wing charges of a leftist bias
among professors are well-founded, the accusations
suggest that any kind of educational system is capa
ble of instilling an ideology rather than teaching stu
dents to think. Also, some students are never going
to think. Therefore, any rattling of the cage will be
useful — if only as an attention-getter.
The discussion here about the Western Culture

program is a lot of cage rattling. The actual question
is quite simple. Either you support the program as it
is, with a concentration on the "great works" of
Europe and the classical world, or you want to ex
pand the program to include the study of non-
Western cultures and minority voices.
Those in the first group can be called
traditionalists who'd like to keep to safely inter
pretable works — safe in the sense Marx meant when
he said that by the time men get around to philoso
phy, the time for action has passed.
Some people in this group support the status quo
for practical reasons like the limitations on the scope
of the curriculum and the amount of class time.
Others, including a surprising number of freshmen,
seem unwilling even to consider reforming the pro
gram. Why? Because if the program is broadened to
include minorities and non-Western voices, they will
have to decide what new texts to put on the reading
lists. I suspect that if faced with such a project, not
only will some in the traditionalist camp be unable to
defend their choices, they might also be able to jus
tify the presence of some of the classics. As for stu
dents, new texts would be threatening because they
wouldn't know how to interpret them — there might
not be any Cliff Notes.
The other group, the reformers, can be called
revolutionary and idealistic, as opposed to the con
servative. practical traditionalists. The reformers
believe in the power of ideas to change minds
through education and society through action. This
is a lesson they've learned from the study of Western
culture, actually. Now they want to remove the safety
factor, to put the principles into action. Surely this is
a constructive act, a synthesis of reading assign
ments into an ethical program.
The traditionalists occasionally seem to be "just
saying no" to the introduction of new texts because
this will disrupt the orderly system of Western Cul
ture. For the Western Culture program is really the
only area in which Stanford has the power to shape a
student's ethical development.
Now for an incredible leap of logic: Stanford is
known for its "teachy" programs, and obviously all
those EEs and MEs have taken Western Culture. It
may be that the rationalist side of Western Culture
(the side that studies Darwin and that organizes the
tracks) is peculiarly tied to the system of teaching the
sciences, which doesn't allow students much
freedom to shape their own educations. A student of
math can hardly question the choice of algebraic
symbols. Such a student is especially vulnerable to
accepting a traditional study of culture that happens
to make reasonable the position he's actually in vis
a-vis math or engineering.
Instead of worrying that students aren't getting a
good education because they aren't being served up a
total ethical package, perhaps we should allow the
study of cultures to be fragmented as a contrast to
the rigid study of sciences. One point in favor of the
present Western Culture program is that the texts
are authored by individuals whose personal influ
ence is recognized. It's interesting that a reformed
program might choose secondary sources that move
away from the individual to the group. I can see a sit
uation where freshmen are ingesting hard-to
criticize more accessible literature by historical indi
viduals.
Something had better be done with the Western
Culture program to get ready for the "Just Say No"
generation. Meanwhile, keep rattling the cage.
Making noise is better than dead silence.

Once I spent an afternoon stuffing envelopes at the
Hoover Institution. I was mailing leaflets on SDI.
Believe it or not, I got a paper cut and proceeded to
bleed on the envelope of the Honorable Edwin Meese
111. They gave me a Band-Aid. It was all worth it be
cause of a wonderful comment someone at the office
made. I quote: "It's harder to get a good education at
a liberal university." Harder, that is, than at a con
servative institution.

Now my Idea of a conservative school is Oral
Roberts University. The degree I'm working toward is
in the liberal arts. There is no such thing as the con
servative arts.
The opinion of this person at Hoover is one side of
the multifaceted question of the teaching of ethics.
At Stanford, you see this issue in the attempts to
reform the Western Culture program, which I'll talk
more about later. In elementary and secondary
schools, you can see how confused the teaching of
ethics is by the "Just Say No" campaign.
The "Just Say No" movement originated, I believe,
in speeches made by Nancy Reagan. It then spread
into the schools. The slogan itself is an interesting
twist on the history of the word "no." Through the
ages, saying no has been the first and ultimate act of
rebellion. The First Lady seems to have switched
things neatly around. Starting with the idea that
people use drugs to rebel, by "just saying no" you can
get the feeling of rebellion while maintaining social
order. This does seem to be the Reagan administra
tion's "moral equivalent of war."
As an educational program aimed at young
children, "Just Say No" focuses on teaching them to
refuse specific substances or acts In specific situa
tions. This reminds me of the see-and-say method of
teaching people how to read, a method notorious for
producing slow readers — even Illiterates. The other
teaching method, phonics, trains children to put to
gether sounds and letters and so on, which prepares
them to read any text — not just the page of con
trolled and limited content before them.
So while "Just Say No" has its obvious merits of
keeping children physically sound, its effectiveness
as a means of teaching moral decision-making is
doubtful. I would guess that the kids in "Just Say
No" clubs aren't very likely to grow up to "just say no"
to the MX missile. The kids are being taught to con
form to a safe standard of behavior. And how will
they decide when to ever say yes to anything?
The politically conservative who claim to be inter
ested in the teaching of ethics simply want to ensure
that their values are transmitted to the younger gen
eration. The last thing they want to question is the
educational process. So really a conservative school
would be engaged in indoctrination — not educa
tion.
Whether or not right-wing charges of a leftist bias
among professors are well-founded, the accusations
suggest that any kind of educational system is capa
ble of instilling an ideology rather than teaching stu
dents to think. Also, some students are never going
to think. Therefore, any rattling of the cage will be
useful — if only as an attention-getter.
The discussion here about the Western Culture

program is a lot of cage rattling. The actual question
is quite simple. Either you support the program as it
is, with a concentration on the "great works" of
Europe and the classical world, or you want to ex
pand the program to include the study of non-
Western cultures and minority voices.
Those in the first group can be called
traditionalists who'd like to keep to safely inter
pretable works — safe in the sense Marx meant when
he said that by the time men get around to philoso
phy, the time for action has passed.
Some people in this group support the status quo
for practical reasons like the limitations on the scope
of the curriculum and the amount of class time.
Others, including a surprising number of freshmen,
seem unwilling even to consider reforming the pro
gram. Why? Because if the program is broadened to
include minorities and non-Western voices, they will
have to decide what new texts to put on the reading
lists. I suspect that if faced with such a project, not
only will some in the traditionalist camp be unable to
defend their choices, they might also be able to jus
tify the presence of some of the classics. As for stu
dents, new texts would be threatening because they
wouldn't know how to interpret them — there might
not be any Cliff Notes.
The other group, the reformers, can be called
revolutionary and idealistic, as opposed to the con
servative. practical traditionalists. The reformers
believe in the power of ideas to change minds
through education and society through action. This
is a lesson they've learned from the study of Western
culture, actually. Now they want to remove the safety
factor, to put the principles into action. Surely this is
a constructive act, a synthesis of reading assign
ments into an ethical program.
The traditionalists occasionally seem to be "just
saying no" to the introduction of new texts because
this will disrupt the orderly system of Western Cul
ture. For the Western Culture program is really the
only area in which Stanford has the power to shape a
student's ethical development.
Now for an incredible leap of logic: Stanford is
known for its "teachy" programs, and obviously all
those EEs and MEs have taken Western Culture. It
may be that the rationalist side of Western Culture
(the side that studies Darwin and that organizes the
tracks) is peculiarly tied to the system of teaching the
sciences, which doesn't allow students much
freedom to shape their own educations. A student of
math can hardly question the choice of algebraic
symbols. Such a student is especially vulnerable to
accepting a traditional study of culture that happens
to make reasonable the position he's actually in vis
a-vis math or engineering.
Instead of worrying that students aren't getting a
good education because they aren't being served up a
total ethical package, perhaps we should allow the
study of cultures to be fragmented as a contrast to
the rigid study of sciences. One point in favor of the
present Western Culture program is that the texts
are authored by individuals whose personal influ
ence is recognized. It's interesting that a reformed
program might choose secondary sources that move
away from the individual to the group. I can see a sit
uation where freshmen are ingesting hard-to
criticize more accessible literature by historical indi
viduals.
