# Drowning investigation under way
## 
### MARCUS MABRY Senior staff writer 
Acting Dean of Student Affairs Norm
Robinson announced yesterday that Mi
chael Jackson, assistant to the provost,
will head the investigation into the
drowning death of 20-year-old David
Dunshee.
The purpose of the investigation Is to
discover "the facts" behind Dunshee's
death early Wednesday morning, he
said.
Robinson expects a final report from
Jackson either late this week or early
next week.
Robinson stated that he does not yet
know whether the University alcohol

policy will change.
He emphasized that any change would
be based on the specific circumstances
surrounding the death. "We really need
to know the facts." Robinson said. "I'm
sure that any (potential) changes would
be discussed reasonably widely."
Though Robinson said Sunday that
"it's almost inevitable that the (alcohol)
policy will change," he ruled out the pos
sibility that the drowning could result in
a University policy mandating a dry
campus. "I do not think that is a possi
bility." he said.
Current University policy states that
"California law prohibits the consump
tion of alcohol by persons under 21 and
makes it illegal to buy for or supply alco

hoi to anyone under 21." In addition,
the alcohol policy "requires that alcohol
not be the focus of an event and that
food and equally attractive and abun
dant non-alcoholic beverages be pro
vided at residence functions when alco
hol is served."
Steve Singleton, Interfraternity Coun
cil president, said the IFC will begin re
examining its Rush policy after the in
vestigation is complete and a final report
has been issued. Dunshee, a member of
Zeta Psi fraternity, drowned in Lagunita
after a Rush party at the Boathouse.
"We are going to wait until we hear
from the Zetes and the University and
