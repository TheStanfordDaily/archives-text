## Bug muses on gate-crashing, fondling and smokeless guns 
### KATHRYN VER PLOEG Staff writer 
Dear Bug Me:
There Is an electronically con
trolled gate In between Sweet
Hall and CERAS which Is de
signed to keep cars from coming
onto our beloved campus lawns
and bike paths. Apparently, too
many people enjoy using this en
trance to the vehicle exclusion
zone, because the gate Is often
lying shattered In splinters after
a car or person has decided to
remove the obstacle. Hours later,
the wood barrier Is replaced and
ready for the next gate-crasher.
My question Is, why not Just leave
the thing alone? How much does
each gate crash cost, given the
exorbitant price of University
labor and materials? Are other
campus gates the victims of this
treatment as often?
- Crawling from the wreckage
Surprisingly enough, Stanford's
bureaucracy Is not as woeful as
you might have expected. A pine,
pre-palnted, pre-shaped, ready-to
lnstall gate arm goes for a
relatively meager *18.50. The
police officers assigned to replace
them earn about *10 an hour and
replace each gate In either 15 to
20 minutes (If you listen to the
Cpt. William Wullschleger) or 30 to
45 minutes (the estimate of Sgt.
Rick Tipton of the department's
Parking Enforcement Program).
So, all told, a replacement gate
arm costs between *21 and *26.
Recently, however, there has
been a rash of shatterings. Says
Tipton, "Lately it's been twice a
day."
And so why not just keep the
fool thing open? Because it's
guarding a motor vehicle exclu
sion zone, and would exclude even
fewer motor vehicles if it were left
open.
The other two campus
electronic gates, behind Mem Chu
and Varlan Hall, are less fre
quently hit, probably due to lack
of recent construction and ab

sence of activity of the type to be
found around Sweet Hall.
Fear not, for although he'd
rather not see them in print, Wull
scheleger says that he's got "a lot
of big plans" for getting the motor
vehicle exclusion zone to live up to
its name.
Dear Bug Me:
As I was chatting with a Stan
ford police officer the other day, I
noticed a rather interesting bulge
beneath his uniform. When he
noticed my staring, he offered to
let me feel his bullet-proof vest.
(What did you think the bulge
was?!) Considering the possibil
ity that ourfearless law enforcers
could actually be in danger on a
job, I thought of a question for the
omniscient, erudite Bug Me to an
swer. How many times a year
does the average Stanford cop
shoot his gun in the line of duty? I
would'ue asked the cop myself,
but fondling his vest left me
speechless.

Stanford police just about never
discharge their guns in the line of
duty. Says Stanford Police Chief

Marvin Herrington, "I don't recall
any instances when they've been
fired." He's been here for 16 years.
Although every sworn-in officer
(not the parking ticket writers)
carries a gun. the weapons have
been used for protection and pre
vention.
Happily enough, Stanford's
record is pretty typical, even of
larger cities. "Most police officers
go through their entire careers
without firing their guns, 7 ' says
Herrington.
So what about Starsky and
Hutch, Miami Vice, and all those
other cop shows? "Well, they're
stupid."
And remember, you too could
enjoy the instant gratification of
hitting the public hard with the
crucial issues of our time, by
sending your always-wanted-to
know-but-never-had-the-guts-to-
ask questions to Bug Me, c/o The
Daily, Storke Publications Build
ing, Stanford, Calif., 94305, or
through any one of the top four
Shakespeare tragedies to the
"Bug-Me" account. Mind you,
that's "Bug-Me," not "B.Bug-Me"
or "Bug Me."
