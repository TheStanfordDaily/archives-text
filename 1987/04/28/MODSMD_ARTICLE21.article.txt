# Anthropologist ties development of human sexuality to cognition

It was an unusual trial.
Owen Lovejoy, an expert In homlnld biome
chanics from Kent State University, put the devel
opment of human cognitive ability on trial
Thursday in a speech entitled "Human Sexuality:
Myth and Facts."
Lovejoy declared himself as the prosecutor, the
audience as the jury, Homo sapiens as the
accused, the development of cognition as the
crime and eastern Africa, where many early fossils
have been discovered, as the crime site for the
trial.
One of Lovejoy's opening questions to the jury
was: "Is Intelligence a direct result of natural se
lection, or is It due to some chance event in his
tory?"
Using slides of animals and graphs to illustrate
his points, Lovejoy methodically examined each
piece of evidence relating to man's evolution from
an apelike creature with a small brain to modern
man.
Among the points he covered were the adaptive
radiation of man's hominld ancestors, the devel
opment of bipedality, the dietary shift, weight and
skeletal dimorphism and the cryptlcism of female

reproductive status.
Arguing that reproductive success is the major
factor in natural selection, Lovejoy described how
various animals Increase their energy for
reproduction by accomplishing other essential ac
tivities, such as feeding, with a lower amount of
energy.
According to Lovejoy, there are two reproductive
strategies — the 'R' method and the K' method. In
R animals, many offspring are produced and are
provided with little parental care, while in K
animals, a small number of offspring is provided
with a great deal of parental attention. Human
beings are the most extreme K animal.
At one point, Lovejoy stressed the "striking
similarity between man and apes in terms of
anatomy." He said there are only five real differ
ences between men and apes — brain size,
method of locomotion, dental structure,
reproductive strategy and familiarity with ma
terial culture, tools and technology.
After the slide presentation, which lasted about
an hour, Lovejoy answered questions from stu
dents and faculty members.
This lecture Is the second in a series of talks on
human origins offered by the Anthropology De
partment.
