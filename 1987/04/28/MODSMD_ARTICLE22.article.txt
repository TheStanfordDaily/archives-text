## Take cover! Can Card nine repeat 35-run attack today? 
### TOM SENF Senior staff writer 
Thirty-five to nothing.
When one looks over Stanford's
1986 results, the Feb. 11 entry
still seems like a misprint. Come
on, is it a three or is it a five? Was
the score 3-0 or 5-0?
Unbelievably, it was neither.
Stanford actually beat Stanislaus
State 35-0 at Warrior Stadium last
season. The Cardinal scored five
touchdowns and kicked all the ex
tra points to come within one of
the all-time Pacific 10 Conference
run-scoring record, set in 1985 by
Oregon State.
It was the Tragedy in Turlock,
and today may be the Slaughter at
Stanford, as the Cardinal hosts
the Warriors in a 2:30 p.m. game
at Sunken Diamond. The No. 6
Cardinal brings a 34-14 record
into today's contest, while the Di
vision 111 Warriors are 20-22.
Stanislaus State Coach Jim
Bowen was on a one-year leave of
absence last season, but he wit
nessed the debacle. "Stanford did
everything right, we did every
thing wrong, and the whole thing
just got out of hand," he said. "It
can happen to the Giants or A's or
at any level of baseball."
Maybe it can in spirit, but the
Warriors' collapse was pretty
unique in its magnitude. In 62 at
bats, Stanford banged out 34 hits
for a .547 average. The Stanislaus
State pitchers contributed 10
walks to the cause, and, not to be
outdone, the defense committed
five errors.
Led by Doug Robbins' six RBIs,
13 Cardinal players drove in at
least one run, and nine either

matched or exceeded the Warriors'
hit total of two. Stanford scored in
seven different innings. Including
two nine-run uprisings.
For the Warriors, the game was
a forgettable moment in an other
wise memorable season. Stanis
laus State finished with a 24-20-1
record and qualified for the Divi
sion 111 College World Series with a
regional victory over UC-San
Diego. The Warriors have reached
the Series seven times in the last
11 years.
"They (the players) really put it
(the loss to Stanford) behind
them," Bowen said. "We all have
those days."
If Stanislaus State is to avoid
another one of those days, it will
need to get offense from outfielder
Don Muniz (.409) and shortstop
Adam Hilpert (.367). But more im
portantly. the Warriors will need
some decent pitching.
According to Bowen, this is
unlikely. "We've been lacking on
the hill. We graduated all our wins
from last year," he said, poten
tially dashing the hopes of any
fans wanting to see a whole game
and still make dinner.
Bowen had not decided who
would pitch as of yesterday but
did say that the game would be
split up between a few pitchers.
Don Cabral is one candidate to
throw a few innings, if Bowen can
pry him out of the dugout. Last
year against Stanford Cabral
threw 2 2/3 innings, giving up 14
hits and 12 runs â€” all of them
earned.

Linebacker David Wyman is a possible first-round pick in today's National Football
League draft, but the fifth-year senior will more likely be chosen in the second round.
