# Card soccer not kicking back
## 
### ROBERT PORTNOY Staff writer 
"They haven't fulfilled their promise" is
one. "They haven't lived up to their poten
tial" is another.
Anyone who's ever played an organized
sport of any kind at any level has heard
something close to one of these prized sports
cliches. It may have been from a coach, a
friend, another player, maybe a parent. In
fact, sometimes axioms like these are used
so often to describe the sports world we feel
like someone has turned on a cassette player
with auto-reverse.
Coming off a difficult and disappointing
year, Stanford men's soccer has put Its own
personal stamp on the spring exhibition
season — next fall the Cardinal will start to
fulfill some of its promise.
Stanford is a young team. Last season,
youth meant inexperience. Now it means re
turning players. While other teams are losing
their top players to graduation, as the Card
inal did last season, Stanford welcomes back
all but four starters. A team that last year
had more than half its roster filled with un
derclassmen is now a year older and a year
smarter.
At the risk of conjuring up another
overused phrase, the proof is in the pudding.
The spring has proved a very fertile time for
the Cardinal. You might call it a spring mid
term. How has Stanford done?
"It was a better-than-passing grade on the
midterm, but we can't breeze into the final.
There are always some trick questions on the
final," Stanford Coach Sam Koch said.
Those tricks translate into one of the
toughest regular season schedules in recent
years. The team will have the opportunity to

prove itself against some of the top teams in
the country, and if the spring season is any
indication, it will be prepared to do just that.
The trend began with a great second half
in the final game of the regular season
against U.S. International. After trailing 3-0
at the half, Koch inserted some of the
younger players Into the lineup, and the
results were tremendous. The Cardinal
dominated the second half, running every
loose ball down and playing the kind of in
tense, aggressive soccer that has been a
trademark of Stanford soccer since Koch
arrived on the Farm. The result was a losing,
albeit encouraging, 3-2 decision.
The first exhibition game was a 4-0
whitewashing of a club team from Sydney,
Australia. The outcome was never in doubt,
only the score. That was followed by two
games against teams from Argentina, Both
of those were equally impressive. The first
was a meeting with a collection of Argentine
college students, who fell to a well-rested
Cardinal 4-0. Then Stanford took a 2-0 deci
sion from the Universidad Catolica, the only
loss it suffered on its U.S. tour.
"We had some good chances offensively.
We weren't as strong as we have been. Ross
Torres, Chris Porch and Mark Semioli all had
good chances. We could've put more in early,
maybe it could've been 4-0, but this team
was a much stronger one than the last. The
defensive effort was the key," Koch said.
That victory was followed by a scoreless tie
with Santa Clara, which showed that the
three consecutive shutouts against interna
tional teams were not simply routs of out-of
shape teams. The defense is every bit as good
as it hinted during the regular season and

will be the backbone of the Stanford team
next year.
The Cardinal next came up with a tremen
dous effort in a 2-0 loss to the San Jose
Earthquakes. Yes, Stanford played tough
against a professional team.
"We're not going to play anybody better
next year, but we'll play plenty of teams just
as good," Koch said.
Then the Cardinal traveled to Southern
California for the pivotal portion of the
spring schedule. Stanford met UC-Santa
Barbara on April 10, tied 3-3, and didn't play
very well. The performance was encouraging,
though, because Stanford tied a decent team
while not playing Its best soccer, and the
Cardinal proved it with a 1-1 tie against na
tional power UCLA on April 12.
"It was one of our best efforts of the spring
season. Everyone was In tune and in sync.
We were able to get passing combinations to
gether because we had the intensity for off
the-ball runs. We played with them except for
20 minutes where they dominated. We had
plenty of excellent chances and two goals dis
allowed by offsides," freshman midfielder
Jeff Rona said.
On April 15. Stanford fell 2-1 to Santa
Clara. Not to worry, considering the emo
tional and physical drain from UCSB and
UCLA.
"We played about the worst we could play,
and only lost 2-1. That's not much consola
tion, but 1 think it was a kind of letdown
from the great weekend down south." junior
forward Ross Torres said.
All the signs are encouraging. The talent is
there. The game experience should now be
there. If any team can live up to its potential,
this one can, but It still has to do it come
September.

the country, and if the spring season is any
indication, it will be prepared to do just that.
The trend began with a great second half
in the final game of the regular season
against U.S. International. After trailing 3-0
at the half, Koch inserted some of the
younger players Into the lineup, and the
results were tremendous. The Cardinal
dominated the second half, running every
loose ball down and playing the kind of in
tense, aggressive soccer that has been a
trademark of Stanford soccer since Koch
arrived on the Farm. The result was a losing,
albeit encouraging, 3-2 decision.
The first exhibition game was a 4-0
whitewashing of a club team from Sydney,
Australia. The outcome was never in doubt,
only the score. That was followed by two
games against teams from Argentina, Both
of those were equally impressive. The first
was a meeting with a collection of Argentine
college students, who fell to a well-rested
Cardinal 4-0. Then Stanford took a 2-0 deci
sion from the Universidad Catolica, the only
loss it suffered on its U.S. tour.
"We had some good chances offensively.
We weren't as strong as we have been. Ross
Torres, Chris Porch and Mark Semioli all had
good chances. We could've put more in early,
maybe it could've been 4-0, but this team
was a much stronger one than the last. The
defensive effort was the key," Koch said.
That victory was followed by a scoreless tie
with Santa Clara, which showed that the
three consecutive shutouts against interna
tional teams were not simply routs of out-of
shape teams. The defense is every bit as good
as it hinted during the regular season and

will be the backbone of the Stanford team
next year.
The Cardinal next came up with a tremen
dous effort in a 2-0 loss to the San Jose
Earthquakes. Yes, Stanford played tough
against a professional team.
"We're not going to play anybody better
next year, but we'll play plenty of teams just
as good," Koch said.
Then the Cardinal traveled to Southern
California for the pivotal portion of the
spring schedule. Stanford met UC-Santa
Barbara on April 10, tied 3-3, and didn't play
very well. The performance was encouraging,
though, because Stanford tied a decent team
while not playing Its best soccer, and the
Cardinal proved it with a 1-1 tie against na
tional power UCLA on April 12.
"It was one of our best efforts of the spring
season. Everyone was In tune and in sync.
We were able to get passing combinations to
gether because we had the intensity for off
the-ball runs. We played with them except for
20 minutes where they dominated. We had
plenty of excellent chances and two goals dis
allowed by offsides," freshman midfielder
Jeff Rona said.
On April 15. Stanford fell 2-1 to Santa
Clara. Not to worry, considering the emo
tional and physical drain from UCSB and
UCLA.
"We played about the worst we could play,
and only lost 2-1. That's not much consola
tion, but 1 think it was a kind of letdown
from the great weekend down south." junior
forward Ross Torres said.
All the signs are encouraging. The talent is
there. The game experience should now be
there. If any team can live up to its potential,
this one can, but It still has to do it come
September.
