Stanford Women's Basketball
Coach Tara VanDerveer rounded
out what she termed "the best
recruiting class In the nation" yes
terday when Sonja Hennlng, a 5-
foot-8 All-America guard from
Racine, Wis., announced she has
signed a letter of intent to attend
Stanford next fall.
Henning averaged 28.3 points,
10.1 rebounds, 6.5 assists, 4.8
steals and 1.6 blocks per game in
leading William Horlick High
School to a second-place finish in
the Wisconsin state tournament.
In the classroom she managed a
4.3 GPA with several weighted
honors courses.
Henning received first-team All-
America honors from Parade mag
azine and Converse, second-team
recognition from USA Today, and
made the preseason All-America
teams of McGregor and Street &
Smith's.
"Sonja is the best player I've ever
coached and the best player ever
to come out of the state of Wiscon
sin," Horlick Coach Barb Wilson
said. "That's the consensus
opinion. She's mature, self
disciplined and motivated — just
a tremendous all-around person."
Henning was named Miss Bas
ketball in Wisconsin and was the
unanimous choice as the Associ
ated Press and United Press Inter
national Player of the Year.
"I'm very excited," Henning
said. "Basically, it came down to

three reasons for choosing Stan
ford. First, there was the aca
demic reputation of the school.
Second, there was the basketball
program itself. Stanford's pro
gram is very much on the up
swing. And third, there was the
environment. I felt very comforta
ble with the basketball staff and
all the players during my visits to
Stanford. I think there was a
feeling of respect by all concerned
for all the women's programs."
Henning joins four others who
signed with Stanford during the
early signing period in November:
5-11 guard/forward Ann Adkins of
Huntington, W.Va.; 6-1 forward
Celeste Lavoie of Nashua, N.H.; 6-
2 center/forward Trisha Stevens
of Philomath, Ore.; and 6-3 center
Tammy Svoboda of Cincinnati.
"With the addition of Sonja Hen
ning, I feel that we can now
proclaim this as the best recruit
ing class in the nation," VanDer
veer said. "Some other schools
have had a good recruiting year,
but I wouldn't trade this class
straight up for anyone else's."
Henning is Stanford's third top
recruit at guard in as many years.
Last year, freshman Jennifer Azzi
moved into the starting point
guard position and was named to
the Pacific 10 Conference All-
Newcomer team. Redshirt sopho
more Emily Wagner was named
Miss Basketball in the state of Mi
chigan two years ago.
