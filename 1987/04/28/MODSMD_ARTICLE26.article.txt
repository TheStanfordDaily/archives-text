# Golfers aim for Pac-10 crown
## 
### ROBERT PORTNOY Staff writer 
The Oro Valley Country Club in
Tucson, Ariz.. Is the site of the
first-ever women's Pacific 10 Con
ference golf championships.
Despite the addition of some new
teams, the favorites in the three
day tournament, which gets un
der way with 36 holes today, are
all very familiar.
And No. 9 Stanford Is one of
thcin. With four players playing
"very, very well," according to
coach Tim Baldwin, the Cardinal
will vie for the title of Pac-10
champion primarily with four
other top-ranked teams, the most
notable of which is No. 1 Arizona
State.
The four Baldwin was talking
about include seniors Kathleen
McCarthy and Adrienne Gilmar
tin, junior Trish McGonigle and
sophomore Clare Dolan. McCarthy
is a sure bet to be first-team All-
America for the second time in her
college career. The fifth Cardinal
competitor will be junior Kay Cor
nelius. who has been "sick off and
on the past couple months,''
Baldwin explained. "Hopefully
she'll be at full strength for the
tournament," he added.

The Sun Devils are led by 1985
NCAA champion Danielle Am
macapane (a name you may have
heard on a women's professional
golf telecast), Pearl Sinn, who's
Been their hottest player recently,
and Pam Wright, last year's con
ference champion. Each of those
players will contend for the Indi
vidual title as well. No. 6 USC
sports two players who will be cer
tain first-team All-Americas, Kim
Saiki and Tracy Nakamura, and
lOth-ranked Arizona has two ex
cellent foreign players, Martina
Koch and Kathryn Imrie. Koch
was the European Amateur
Champion and Imrie was the
amateur champion in the cradle of
golf. Scotland.
UCLA, ranked 12th, also will be
among the leaders, led by Kristal
Parker, who has "been playing
outstanding," Baldwin said.
Unranked Washington is the
only other team with even a
chance to surprise the tourna
ment powerhouses, as all the
other teams participating have
start-up programs at this stage.
"It's the strongest golf confer
ence in the country with the top
five and Washington. Any one of
these girls has the ability to win

the Pac-10 championship,"
Baldwin said.
The Cardinal has all but locked
up a bid to the NCAA tournament
May 27 to 30. but Baldwin won't
let his team look ahead.
"We've pretty much got it under
control, but we're not taking any
thing for granted. We're trying to
win the conference champion
ship. Last year we were fourth in
the country and last in the confer
ence," Baldwin noted.

Stanford will be battling more
than just the opposing teams this
week. Playing in Arizona as
opposed to the Bay Area poses
many problems.
"We're going down into hot (90
degrees plus) Arizona. The grass
is different, there are different
conditions. That's part of the
great experience. The Arizona
teams are tough down there, and
will be the favorites," Baldwin
commented.
