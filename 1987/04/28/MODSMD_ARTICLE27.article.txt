# Sailors gain national berth
## 
### HUGH R. BETHELL Editorial staff 
For most of this season, the Stanford sailing team
has fought against California In the North and UC-
Irvine in the South in the battle for West Coast
sailing supremacy.
This weekend, that fight ended in a split decision
at the Pacific Coast Championships, as Stanford
finished third in dinghy racing and first in team
racing. As a result, the Cardinal will compete in at
least one division at this year's national champion
ship.
Stanford earned a 7-1 record In the team racing
regatta yesterday, which left them tied for first place
with Irvine. Cal finished well behind with a 3-5
record on the day. As the top two, Stanford and
Irvine will go on to represent the Pacific region In
Kings Point, N.Y., at the national championships
later this spring.
Though the Cardinal scored a much closer third
place in dinghy racing — finishing just four points

behind second-place Cal — only Irvine and Cal will go
to the nationals in that division.
In dinghy racing, one boat from each school com
petes in races against the entire fleet of opponents.
In team racing, three boats from one school compete
against three boats from another, and the trio with
the best record wins.
"Stanford really proved Its team racing expertise
yesterday. The schools that were giving us trouble
yesterday (in the dinghy racing) were no match for us
today." Stanford sailing team coach Blake Middleton
said.
Teams came from all over the Pacific region to com
pete at the season-ending championships. The
teams that qualified for nationals had to beat eight
other squads, including the traditionally strong
teams from USC. UCLA and Hawaii.
All 11 schools found the regatta's conditions test
ing, as Berkeley's usually heavy winds and waves
grew during the weekend into near gale-force gusts
and rolling, whitecapped swells.
By the end of the regatta, most
boats aimed at simply finishing
the race without capsizing in the
Bay's cold waters.
Sailing for the Cardinal were
juniors Dan Buckstaff and Kath
leen Mallery, junior Drew Gashler
and senior Kristen Boyles, senior
Tom Kuhnle and sophomore Rita
Snape, and freshman A 1 Sargent
and junior Gina Ottoboni.
"The competition was extremely
tough at this regatta. We made
some mistakes, but I give a lot of
credit to Irvine and Cal. They
sailed really well, and they deserve
to be going to nationals. I'm just
glad we could go along with
them,'' Boyles said.
