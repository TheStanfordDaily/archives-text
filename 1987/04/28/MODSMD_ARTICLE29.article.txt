## Stanford rugby gets experience in Bahamas 
### 
For most club sports, a road
trip usually consists of piling
players into cars and driving up
and down the California coast,
trying to stretch a limited travel
budget to Its limit. For the Stan
ford rugby team, that habitual
scenario took a change for the
better last week.
The Cardinal returned Satur
day from Freeport, Bahamas,
where It played In the Interna
tional Rugby Festival in a field
consisting of teams from Great
Britain, Canada, the Bahamas
and the United States.

"We were able to watch a
foreign style of rugby." Stanford
captain Xavler Brlggs said,
"while bringing our own distinc
tive California game to the pitch
In weather that was perfect for
rugby competition."
The Cardinal's fortunes on the
field were not as perfect as the
weather, though, as Stanford
failed to qualify for the champi
onship matches.
The matches were played at
the Freeport Rugby Club, which
also sponsored social events for

the teams. Including scuba,
snorkellng, windsurfing, flying
and sunning. "Rookies and vet
erans alike enjoyed the beauty of
the Bahamas and the warmth of
its people." Stanford Coach
Dave Fujlmoto said.
"The fun and the sun were
great," senior John Moore said.
"But the game experience was
even better. We played against
some high-caliber rugby teams."
The Cardinal ends Its season
this weekend at the 27th annual
Monterey Rugby Tournament.
