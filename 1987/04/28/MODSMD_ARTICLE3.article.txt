### LORI SILVER Staff writer 
Student minority groups and the ASSU
voiced strong support for proposed reforms
of the Western Culture program at a press
conference yesterday.
Representatives of the Black Student Un
ion (BSU), MEChA, the Asian American
Students' Association (AASA), students
from History Prof. Clay Carson's alternative
Western Culture track and an ASSU senator
presented statements to an audience of ap
proximately 25 people.
In a draft proposal, the Task Force on the
Area One requirement, headed by History
Prof. Paul Seaver, recommended that the
purpose of Area One be the study of diverse
cultures. The proposal has drawn sharp
criticism from some faculty members and
students.
Tonya Rhodes, representing the BSU,
called the criticism "premature, pejorative

"We need to study complex facts like the
contributions of people of color, women and
the working class to Western culture and
equally the impact that developing Western
civilization had on them. Otherwise the
story remains incomplete and incorrect,"
Rhodes said.

no Dante, Latin America, no Homer,"

Rhodes said: "Italy had no Gandhi. Greece
no Malcom X."
In an Interview after the press confer

the reforms go further and "relate historical
ideas, values and concepts to our lives
today."
For example, she said that classes should
explore "how Aristotle's works played into
slavery In America."
Both Jerilyn Lopez Mendoza, speaking
for Stanford MEChA, and AASA representa
tive Richard Suh called the Task Force's
proposal "a step In the right direction," and
called for even greater reforms.
"Stanford can no longer freely silence the
voices of minorities and women in the
classroom. It is time for Stanford to recog
nize that people of color outside of Europe
have made intellectual and artistic contri
butions to the world we live in." Mendoza
said.
A world culture course "would give us a
better appreciation of our fellow students'
heritage" and "would promote tolerance
and help dispel racism," she said.
Suh said that Stanford should "attempt
to inculcate its students with a fundamen
tal appreciation for diversity, which I think
is totally lacking on the Stanford campus."
In this respect, "AASA believes the task
