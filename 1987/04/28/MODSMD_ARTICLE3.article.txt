### LORI SILVER Staff writer 
Student minority groups and the ASSU
voiced strong support for proposed reforms
of the Western Culture program at a press
conference yesterday.
Representatives of the Black Student Un
ion (BSU), MEChA, the Asian American
Students' Association (AASA), students
from History Prof. Clay Carson's alternative
Western Culture track and an ASSU senator
presented statements to an audience of ap
proximately 25 people.
In a draft proposal, the Task Force on the
Area One requirement, headed by History
Prof. Paul Seaver, recommended that the
purpose of Area One be the study of diverse
cultures. The proposal has drawn sharp
criticism from some faculty members and
students.
Tonya Rhodes, representing the BSU,
called the criticism "premature, pejorative
and racist."
"We need to study complex facts like the
contributions of people of color, women and
the working class to Western culture and
equally the impact that developing Western
civilization had on them. Otherwise the
story remains incomplete and incorrect,"
Rhodes said.
In response to charges that "Africa had
no Dante, Latin America, no Homer,"

Rhodes said: "Italy had no Gandhi. Greece
no Malcom X."
In an Interview after the press confer
ence, Rhodes said that she would like to see
the reforms go further and "relate historical
ideas, values and concepts to our lives
today."
For example, she said that classes should
explore "how Aristotle's works played into
slavery In America."
Both Jerilyn Lopez Mendoza, speaking
for Stanford MEChA, and AASA representa
tive Richard Suh called the Task Force's
proposal "a step In the right direction," and
called for even greater reforms.
"Stanford can no longer freely silence the
voices of minorities and women in the
classroom. It is time for Stanford to recog
nize that people of color outside of Europe
have made intellectual and artistic contri
butions to the world we live in." Mendoza
said.
A world culture course "would give us a
better appreciation of our fellow students'
heritage" and "would promote tolerance
and help dispel racism," she said.
Suh said that Stanford should "attempt
to inculcate its students with a fundamen
tal appreciation for diversity, which I think
is totally lacking on the Stanford campus."
In this respect, "AASA believes the task
force does not go far enough in re
quests for change," he said.
Citing increasing Incidents of
racism at Stanford and in Palo
Alto, ASSU Senator Vivian Wu
said that the senate "fully sup
ports the recommendations made
by the Western Culture Task
Force."
Both the ASSU and the task
force are planning to co-sponsor a
public forum that will allow stu
dents and faculty to express their
views. The forum will probably
take place within the next couple
of weeks, Wu said.
Freshmen Lloyd Metz and Brian
Bonnlande, students in the al
ternative Western Culture track

that focuses on the contributions
of women and minorities to West
ern culture, said that they "resent
the implication that what we are
learning is not valuable."
"At an elitist university like
Stanford, students need to be
reminded to question their cul
tural elitism and the effects that
type of elitism has had on other
peoples," they said.
"We demand to see the diversity
in our curriculum and the true
liberal education that Stanford
has promised us." they said.
Sophomore Barbara Voss, a
member of the task force, said in
an interview much of the reaction
to the task force's proposal has
been "out of line."
"I don't foresee any significant
revision in the substance of the
proposal's final draft," Voss said.
She said that the task force,
which is composed of faculty and

students, has a "strong consen
sus" In favor of the draft.
"We all feel very strongly towards
the proposal at this point." she
said.
Responding to the criticism and
the press conference. Carson, a
member of the task force, said
that "the quality of discussion
that has gone on so far does not
suggest to me that the task force's
report has been getting the careful
consideration that it deserves.
"I just hope that we won't get
into a battle that will prevent us
from addressing concerns that
lead us to the task force," he said.
At this point, the task force is
prepared to draft a final proposal
on the Area One requirement,
which It will present to the Com
mittee on Undergraduate Studies
(CUS). The legislation needs the
approval of the CUS and the Fac
ulty Senate to take effect.
