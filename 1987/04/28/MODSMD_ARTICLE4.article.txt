# Ballot dispute sparks second COP election

### MONIQUE SCHEER Senior staff writer 
This year's ASSU election just won't go
away.
The ASSU Senate voted in a noon
meeting yesterday to hold new elections for
the Council of Presidents late this week
after voting not to certify the results of the
first election.
Several COP slate members said they dis
agree with the senate decision and plan to
take action against it, according to Leonard
Adler, a member of the Equalizers slate.
"I think the election is satisfactory the
way it stands," Adler said at yesterday's
meeting. But the Administration and Rules
Committee (A-R) was dissatisfied with the
election procedure and therefore presented
the bill recommending new elections, ac
cording to committee member Scott
Doering.
Senate Chair Jeff Soukup said the senate
certifies the results by approving the con
duct of the candidates and the fairness of
the election. The senate voted today to cer
tify all the results of the election except for
those of the COP race.
According to Soukup, the senate refused
to certify the COP election because there
was a question as to which ballots would be
considered valid â€” specifically, whether to
include ballots that the Scantron machine
could not read but which were included in a
vote recount.
Doering cited another reason for not cer
tifying the COP election. He said the A-R felt
"the proper procedure had not been fol
lowed" in the investigations of charges of
misconduct In the COP slates' campaigns.
He did not elaborate on the charges against
the slates.
The recount played no part in the A-R
decision, according to Elections Commis
sioner Brett Jarvis. The A-R had made its

decision to recommend new elections
before the recount results were released, he
said.
"I thought it was an incredibly biased
meeting," said Mike Cahill, a member of the
Slate of the Union. He said the senators
that belong to the People's Platform "were
all rallying behind the slate they endorsed
(The Plan)."
Adler also accused The Plan of "having
friends in the senate, the (current) COP and
the Elections Commission.
"This is clearly a case of partisan politics
in the ASSU," he said. "If The Plan had been
in the runoff, there would have been no call
for a new election."
"In order to preserve the integrity of the
office, we should hold new elections with a
preferential ballot," COP member Carey
White said. In a preferential ballot, such as
the one used for Senior Class President
voting, students rank each slate on a scale
of one to four. The voting method precludes
a runoff between two slates.
COP member Mary Thurber was among
the dissenters. "We should respect the stu
dents' opinion. They want the Equalizers
and the Slate of the Union," she said.
The senate voted 11-3-1 not to certify the
COP elections and to hold new elections,
with all four slates, using a preferential bal
lot.
Cahill said the Equalizers, the Slate of the
Union and the Philosopher Kings are
"coming together on this" to approach the
University ombudsman and perhaps the
provost and dean of Student Affairs regard
ing what they consider misconduct by the
ASSU.
"The senate can essentially do whatever it
wants," said Jim Durkin, a member of the
Equalizers. "The question is whether it's
