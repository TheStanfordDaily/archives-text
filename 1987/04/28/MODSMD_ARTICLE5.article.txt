# Concert Network in quandary over rejection of fee request
## 
### HARU CONNOLLY 
Concert Network board mem
bers might ask the ASSU Senate
to loosen the restrictions on the
fee assessment that students ap
proved for the network two weeks
ago.
Students approved the first part
of the fee assessment — allotted
for operation expenses — but
voted down the second part,
which would have paid the net
work's staff adviser salary. Funds
from the first part cannot be used
to pay the salary of the adviser, a
position required by the Univer
sity.
The senate divided the Concert
Network fee request in two parts
"to give students the opportunity
to vote on the salary alone." said

Senate Chair Jeff Soukup. Ac
cording to Soukup, the adviser
salary comprised one-third of the
total budget.
Concert Network board mem
bers say they will do whatever is
necessary to keep the network
afloat. They are holding a special
meeting today, according to
senior Carey White, who
represents the Council of Presi
dents on the Advisory Board. "We
will decide to either pay the salary
from existing reserves, additional
income generated from shows, or
from the special fee (students ap
proved in the election)."
The board will consider making
a special appeal to the senate, ac
cording to Scott Davis, advisory
board chairman. "We will ask for
line-item modification of our

budget to pay for our adviser from
other funds," he said.
"Our charter requires us to have
an adviser, and we are required by
the University to pay a share of
that salary," Davis said.
According to graduate student
Vinnie Freda, the board will
decide today whether the network
will pay the adviser's salary and
thereby forfeit the first portion of
fees approved by students in the
election or "make a case to the
ASSU and pay both the adviser
and get the money."
Junior Jeff Sloan, a member of
the ASSU Senate Appropriations
Committee, said that the senate
felt that students "would not ap
prove a fee request (for th£ Con
cert Network) If the adviser salary
were In it."

"The senate couldn't be sure (If
the adviser salary would fall) so
they put It on the ballot and gave It
a chance," said White. "It is a valid
concept to split out fees and sepa
rate an issue (from the main re
quest)."
But, he added, "The second
parts of fee requests usually don't
pass."
The fee assessment for the advi
ser's salary was * 13,000.
"We wanted to send a strong sig
nal to the University that students
are willing to fund the network,
not an employee of the Univer
sity," Soukup said.
Sloan hopes to use the students'
defeat of the second part of the fee
request "as leverage to get the Uni
versity to pay (the adviser)."
"It would be optimal if the Unl

verslty could consider a student
vote and reopen the budgeting
process, but that hasn't been done
before," White said. Budget
preparations for the coming fiscal
year began in fall quarter, he ex
plained.
"While it is true that the salary
is a tremendous amount of fixed
costs, it is difficult to get money
from the University for this fiscal
year," White added.
"I think the University should
make a sign to the Concert Net
work and the ASSU which shows
movement on the issue," Freda
said. "It takes months for a budget
to be approved, and the University
is now talking about 1988-1989."
Freda has sent a letter to acting
Dean of Student Affairs Norm
Robinson stating that the Univer

sity and the Concert Network can
work toward an agreement. "I'd
like the University to take a leader
ship role in making an offer (to
pay the adviser)."
The adviser's role has been a
controversial one. When the Con
cert Network charter was imple
mented in the early '80s, it was
decided that a staff adviser would
be helpful and would contribute
professional expertise and conti
nuity. Davis said.
The adviser's role is to work
with the staff of the Concert Net
work, help put on shows and act
as a liaison between the network
and the University.
"The University and some stu
dents think that |the adviser]
