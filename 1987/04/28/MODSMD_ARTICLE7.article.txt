Protest at CIA headquarters
WASHINGTON — More than 550 demonstrators — including
several familiar figures from the anti-war movement of the 1960s
— were arrested yesterday as they tried to block entrances to CIA
headquarters in a five-hour protest against Reagan administra
tion policies in Central America and South Africa.
Among those arrested In the non-violent protest, which began
before dawn at the agency's headquarters in suburban Langley.
Va., were anti-war activists Daniel Ellsberg, a former Pentagon
employee who provided the classified Pentagon Papers to the news
media during the Vietnam War, and Philip Berrigan, a defrocked
Catholic priest Imprisoned for his anti-war activities.
For about an hour, morning rush-hour traffic near the facility
was backed up about a mile in all directions as protesters massed
at the gates. Fairfax County Police officer Bill Coulter estimated
the total crowd at 1,250, and described it as "very orderly."
Arrests were carried out by the county police, U.S. Park Police
and Federal Protective Service. Those who were arrested had come
forward in a succession of small groups to block the facility's three
entrances.
CIA spokeswoman Kathy Pherson said the protesters had little
effect on work Inside the headquarters. "It's pretty much business
as usual," she said.
U.S. arms control stance shifts
WASHINGTON — Veering sharply from administration policy,
Edward Rowny, President Reagan's arms control adviser, said yes
terday the United States should seriously consider insisting on
major changes in the nuclear arms reduction agreement being
negotiated with the Soviet Union.
Rowny called criticism by former President Nixon and Henry
Kissinger of the proposed agreement "refreshing and helpful." He
said the former president and his chief foreign policy adviser had
made strong arguments that the United States should not sign
the agreement unless the Soviets agree to two changes in the pact.
Nixon and Kissinger, in a column for the Los Angeles Times
Syndicate that was published Sunday, wrote that it would be a
"profound mistake" to sign the agreement now being worked out
by U.S. and Soviet negotiators unless the pact provided for:
□ Linking the withdrawal of intermediate-range missies from
Europe to the elimination of the Sovets' overwhelming advantage
in conventional forces.
□ Eliminating all these missiles instead of allowing the Soviets to
retain 100 nuclear warheads In Asia, balanced by 100 U.S. war
heads on medium-range missiles in the United States.
Rowny, while conceding that the administration has been
pursuing an accord on medium-range missiles without linking it
to a reduction In conventional Soviet forces, insisted that "what
I'm saying is what President Reagan has been saying."
Other administration officials, flatly rejecting the criticism by
Nixon and Kissinger, have said the conditions the two former offi
cials outlined could kill hopes for an arms control agreement.
But Rowny, Interviewed during a breakfast session with
reporters, said he agreed with the Nixon-Kissinger argument that
the agreement endorsed in principle by Reagan could eventually
leave Western Europe vulnerable to conventional Soviet forces or
to blackmail with Soviet-based nuclear weapons.

Airline flights should be cut
WASHINGTON — The head of the National Transportation
Safety Board said yesterday that in order to insure air safety
during the peak summer travel season that begins June 1, the
government must cut the number of flights the airlines are per
mitted to operate.
Chairman Jim Burnett said that a forced reduction in the num
ber of flights is a necessary short-term step to offset the recent rise
in air traffic controller errors and near collisions.
"The issue is what level of protection should the American flying
public have this summer, and what can they expect to have with
the system we have, and how serious Is the gap between them?"
Burnett explained in an Interview.
He declined to measure the width of this gap, but said: "I think
there is one, and I don't think there has to be. But the remedy is
going to be unpleasant. It will be a bitter pill."
Operational errors by controllers increased 18 percent and near
collisions in midair increased 13 percent in the first three months
of this year as measured against the same period last year, Bur
nett said, citing statistics compiled by the Federal Aviation Ad
ministration.
The FAA maintains that last year was the safest year In the his
tory of aviation because no U.S. carriers crashed, while the num
ber of flight operations rose to a record high.
Israel withholds Iran data
WASHINGTON — The Israeli government has balked at turning
over financial data It collected on secret sales of U.S. arms to Iran
without first getting limited immunity for its citizens from any
criminal prosecution and control over public disclosure of any of
the information, according to congressional and administration
sources.
The material was promised by the Israeli government to con
gressional probers looking into the Iran-contra affair. Inves
tigators from the House and Senate select committees reviewed
the material at the Israeli Embassy yesterday but were given
"some terms and conditions they could not agree on for its use," a
spokesman for the House committee said.
"We are still negotiating on its terms," he said.
A spokesman for the Israeli Embassy. Yossi Gal. confirmed that
negotiations are under way but would not discuss any details
other than to say committee staff members had looked at the doc
uments.
"We are in touch with the committees and hopefully this will be
resolved." Gal said.
According to informed sources, the Israelis have asked that they
be allowed to veto the public release of any of the materials they
propose to turn over to the committees. They have also asked for
an assurance that the committees will not provide the material to
independent counsel Lawrence Walsh.
Afghans march for peace
KABUL, Afghanistan — Thousands of people paraded here yes
terday in support of a government program of "national reconcili
ation" aimed at attracting more than 3 million refugees back to Af
ghanistan from Pakistan and Iran.
But a senior Afghan government official, speaking at the
massive rally and parade honoring the ninth anniversary of the
' April Revolution." said that so far only 44.000 refugees had ac
cepted the Soviet-backed government's offer of amnesty, compen
sation and a chance to take part in a coalition government.
Defense Minister Mohammad Rafl said that the number who
have returned represent less than 2 percent of the people listed as
refugees by the United Nations. Among those who have come
back, he said, are 21.000 guerrillas who have been fighting gov
ernment and Soviet forces here since 1979.
Rafi and other Afghan leaders have blamed the low response on
what they say is interference by Pakistan and the United States at
the frontiers.

Protest at CIA headquarters
WASHINGTON — More than 550 demonstrators — including
several familiar figures from the anti-war movement of the 1960s
— were arrested yesterday as they tried to block entrances to CIA
headquarters in a five-hour protest against Reagan administra
tion policies in Central America and South Africa.
Among those arrested In the non-violent protest, which began
before dawn at the agency's headquarters in suburban Langley.
Va., were anti-war activists Daniel Ellsberg, a former Pentagon
employee who provided the classified Pentagon Papers to the news
media during the Vietnam War, and Philip Berrigan, a defrocked
Catholic priest Imprisoned for his anti-war activities.
For about an hour, morning rush-hour traffic near the facility
was backed up about a mile in all directions as protesters massed
at the gates. Fairfax County Police officer Bill Coulter estimated
the total crowd at 1,250, and described it as "very orderly."
Arrests were carried out by the county police, U.S. Park Police
and Federal Protective Service. Those who were arrested had come
forward in a succession of small groups to block the facility's three
entrances.
CIA spokeswoman Kathy Pherson said the protesters had little
effect on work Inside the headquarters. "It's pretty much business
as usual," she said.
U.S. arms control stance shifts
WASHINGTON — Veering sharply from administration policy,
Edward Rowny, President Reagan's arms control adviser, said yes
terday the United States should seriously consider insisting on
major changes in the nuclear arms reduction agreement being
negotiated with the Soviet Union.
Rowny called criticism by former President Nixon and Henry
Kissinger of the proposed agreement "refreshing and helpful." He
said the former president and his chief foreign policy adviser had
made strong arguments that the United States should not sign
the agreement unless the Soviets agree to two changes in the pact.
Nixon and Kissinger, in a column for the Los Angeles Times
Syndicate that was published Sunday, wrote that it would be a
"profound mistake" to sign the agreement now being worked out
by U.S. and Soviet negotiators unless the pact provided for:
□ Linking the withdrawal of intermediate-range missies from
Europe to the elimination of the Sovets' overwhelming advantage
in conventional forces.
□ Eliminating all these missiles instead of allowing the Soviets to
retain 100 nuclear warheads In Asia, balanced by 100 U.S. war
heads on medium-range missiles in the United States.
Rowny, while conceding that the administration has been
pursuing an accord on medium-range missiles without linking it
to a reduction In conventional Soviet forces, insisted that "what
I'm saying is what President Reagan has been saying."
Other administration officials, flatly rejecting the criticism by
Nixon and Kissinger, have said the conditions the two former offi
cials outlined could kill hopes for an arms control agreement.
But Rowny, Interviewed during a breakfast session with
reporters, said he agreed with the Nixon-Kissinger argument that
the agreement endorsed in principle by Reagan could eventually
leave Western Europe vulnerable to conventional Soviet forces or
to blackmail with Soviet-based nuclear weapons.

Airline flights should be cut
WASHINGTON — The head of the National Transportation
Safety Board said yesterday that in order to insure air safety
during the peak summer travel season that begins June 1, the
government must cut the number of flights the airlines are per
mitted to operate.
Chairman Jim Burnett said that a forced reduction in the num
ber of flights is a necessary short-term step to offset the recent rise
in air traffic controller errors and near collisions.
"The issue is what level of protection should the American flying
public have this summer, and what can they expect to have with
the system we have, and how serious Is the gap between them?"
Burnett explained in an Interview.
He declined to measure the width of this gap, but said: "I think
there is one, and I don't think there has to be. But the remedy is
going to be unpleasant. It will be a bitter pill."
Operational errors by controllers increased 18 percent and near
collisions in midair increased 13 percent in the first three months
of this year as measured against the same period last year, Bur
nett said, citing statistics compiled by the Federal Aviation Ad
ministration.
The FAA maintains that last year was the safest year In the his
tory of aviation because no U.S. carriers crashed, while the num
ber of flight operations rose to a record high.
Israel withholds Iran data
WASHINGTON — The Israeli government has balked at turning
over financial data It collected on secret sales of U.S. arms to Iran

sources.
The material was promised by the Israeli government to con
gressional probers looking into the Iran-contra affair. Inves
tigators from the House and Senate select committees reviewed
the material at the Israeli Embassy yesterday but were given
"some terms and conditions they could not agree on for its use," a
spokesman for the House committee said.
"We are still negotiating on its terms," he said.
A spokesman for the Israeli Embassy. Yossi Gal. confirmed that
negotiations are under way but would not discuss any details
other than to say committee staff members had looked at the doc
uments.
"We are in touch with the committees and hopefully this will be
resolved." Gal said.
According to informed sources, the Israelis have asked that they
be allowed to veto the public release of any of the materials they
propose to turn over to the committees. They have also asked for
an assurance that the committees will not provide the material to
independent counsel Lawrence Walsh.
Afghans march for peace
KABUL, Afghanistan — Thousands of people paraded here yes
terday in support of a government program of "national reconcili
ation" aimed at attracting more than 3 million refugees back to Af
ghanistan from Pakistan and Iran.
But a senior Afghan government official, speaking at the
massive rally and parade honoring the ninth anniversary of the
' April Revolution." said that so far only 44.000 refugees had ac
cepted the Soviet-backed government's offer of amnesty, compen
sation and a chance to take part in a coalition government.
Defense Minister Mohammad Rafl said that the number who
have returned represent less than 2 percent of the people listed as
refugees by the United Nations. Among those who have come
back, he said, are 21.000 guerrillas who have been fighting gov
ernment and Soviet forces here since 1979.
