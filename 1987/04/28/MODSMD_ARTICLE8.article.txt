# U.S. bars Waldheim from country
## 
### 
WASHINGTON - The Reagan
administration yesterday barred
Austrian President Kurt
Waldheim from entering the
United States after concluding
there Is sufficient evidence to
suspect him of Involvement in
Nazi war crimes.
Waldheim, the former secretary
general of the United Nations, was
put on the Justice Department's
"watch list" of prohibited people,
the first time in U.S. history the
head of a friendly country has
been branded an undesirable
alien suspected of crimes Includ
ing murder.
The decision by Attorney Gen
eral Edwin Meese 111. following
more than a year of charges
against Waldheim by Jewish
groups, caused Austria to recall
its ambassador here, Thomas
Klestil, for consultations.
Austrian officials and public
opinion consistently have rejected
the charges against Waldheim,
who served as U.N. secretary gen
eral from 1972 to 1982, and
resentment among Austrian
voters is regarded as having been
a major factor in Waldheim's elec
tion last year to the largely

ceremonial president's office.
Waldheim became the object of
International controversy early
last year when the World Jewish
Congress announced it had dis
covered evidence showing that he
had concealed his role in 1942-45
as a lieutenant serving in the
Balkans with Nazi army units that
were involved in atrocities against
Yugoslav partisans.
The charges led to disclosure of
a secret 1948 finding by the U.N.
War Crimes Commission that
there was sufficient evidence to
prosecute Waldheim for "murder"
and "putting hostages to death." A
former Yugoslav Intelligence offi
cer also charged that the Soviet
Union learned about Waldheim's
wartime record after the war when
he was serving in Austria's
diplomatic service and might have
used the information to enlist him
as a Soviet agent.
In summoning its ambassador
back to Vienna, Austrian Foreign
Minister Alois Mock said the U.S.
action "causes Austria deep con
sternation and is firmly
rejected. . . . Such action by the
American administration is all the
more regrettable In view of the

decades of excellent Austro-
American relations, characterized
on the Austrian side by deep grati
tude and sympathy with regard to
the American people."
The angry Austrian reaction
came despite official U.S. efforts to
stress that the decision "deals
with Mr. Waldhelm as an Individ
ual" and that the United States
values "our relationship with
Austria highly and will work to
strengthen our friendship."
This point was stressed in a
statement made by spokesmen for
the White House and the Justice
and State departments. In addi
tion. Klestll, who went to the
White House yesterday for a previ
ously scheduled event, was taken
aside for a 20-minute meeting
with President Reagan.
Walter Grelnert, spokesman for
the Austrian Embassy, said
Reagan had reaffirmed hopes for
continued close U.S./Austrian re
lations. "He told the ambassador
that the decision was based on the
requirements of American law and
the mandate of Congress and in
no way reflects on the Austrian
people," Grelnert added.
Waldhelm has denied all the

charges against him, saying they
are based on false testimony from
unreliable witnesses. During his
presidential campaign, he struck
a sympathetic chord among
Austrian voters, who dislike
reminders of Austria's wartime as
sociation with Germany, by ar
guing that he was being perse
cuted for having done his duty
and appealing to the voters to
reject outside Interference.
The situation posed a difficult
problem for the Reagan adminis
tration, which had to balance
demands that Waldhelm be
treated in accordance with U.S.
law against the diplomatic prob
lems of antagonizing a friendly
country. Neal Sher, head of the
Justice Department's Office of
Special Investigations, which in
vestigates war crimes, recom
mended a year ago that Waldhelm
be put on the watch list, but
Meese, despite his initial pledges
to deal with the matter quickly,
delayed acting until yesterday.
The watch list, maintained by
the Immigration and Naturaliza
tion Service, contains the names
of about 40,000 people.
