# USC may get Reagan Library
## 
### MARY YUH Senior staff writer 
The University of Southern Cali
fornia could be chosen as the site
of the Ronald Reagan Presidential
Library and policy center, accord
ing to USC Provost Cornelius
Pings.
"Basically, yes, the library is
plausible," Pings told The Daily
yesterday from Washington, D.C.,
where he is participating in a
panel of the National Academy of
Engineering. "There is consider
able discussion within the
campus about how plausible it
really is."
Pings stressed, however, that it
is too early to be definite.
USC and the Washington-based
Ronald Reagan Presidential foun
dation have had only "informal
contact" about the library com
plex, he said.
After assessing possible loca
tions and faculty support, USC
will contact the Reagan founda
tion within a week if the school
wishes to be formally considered
as a site for the library and policy
center. Pings said.
Following the Reagan founda
tion's announcement last
Thursday that the library would
be built in Southern California in
stead of at Stanford, there has
been a flurry of speculation about
precisely where it would go. The
media have reported that USC,
UCLA, UC-Irvine, Pepperdine, Oc
cidental and the Claremont Col
leges are among the sites under
consideration, but officials at the
schools and the Reagan founda
tion generally have been tight
uppeci. *■»«
Officials at UCLA, Occidental
and the Claremont Colleges said
yesterday that there have been no
official inquiries about bringing
the Reagan library and policy cen
ter to their schools. They declined
to comment further.
At Pepperdine, the offices of the
president and public information
were closed yesterday and Mon
day, and school officials could not
be reached.
Reagan foundation trustee Mar
tin Anderson, a senior fellow at
the Hoover Institution, declined to
name the sites under considera
tion. "We just want to make a deci
sion as soon as possible," he said.
Gary Jones, executive director
of the Reagan foundation, was un-
available for comment yesterday.
UC-Irvine Chancellor Jack Pel
tason has had "one very informal
discussion" with the foundation
about bringing the library to the
school, according to Irvine Asst.
Vice Chancellor Cathy Jones. "No
formal proposal" resulted from the
discussion, which took place
about a month ago. she said.
Jones declined to comment on
whether the university would like
to have the library complex, but
said that discussion at Irvine
"would probably echo the kind of
debate that took place at Stan

ford" over governance of a policy
center.
About five years ago when Irvine
discussed the possibility of taking
a Nixon presidential library,
debate focused on university con
trol of a combined policy center
and library. Jones said. "I expect
we'd see those kinds of issues
come up again (if a Reagan library
at Irvine were proposed)," she
said.
The Reagan foundation has said
it wants an autonomous policy
center connected with the library.
The policy center may be an
issue at USC as well.
"Of course we would want to
have strong faculty support
(before we proposed bringing the
library and policy center to USC)."

said Provost Pings.
"I would guess that the faculty
would not like an autonomous
policy center in the middle of
campus," he said. "But if it were
to have joint appointments and be
partially controlled by the univer
sity, well, perhaps."
The library and policy center
would be structured around USC's
School of Public Administration,
Pings said. Public Administration
Dean Ross Clayton has circulated
a memo to his faculty to gauge
support for the complex.
The memo proposes that the
school be renamed the Reagan
School of Public Administration
in exchange for partial control of
the policy center, according to

Shawn Pogatchnik, the reporter
covering the Reagan Library story
for the Daily Trojan, USC's stu
dent newspaper.
Along with faculty support for
the library complex, space is an
important consideration. USC is
located in a heavily urban area,
and campus space is limited.
USC 'student leaders are
opposed to any construction on
the "green space" that remains,
Pogatchnik said.
Anderson said the complex
would need "acres of land."
"We may have to look at land ad
jacent to the campus." Pings said.
"To the east and to the north — we
may look at buying land."
