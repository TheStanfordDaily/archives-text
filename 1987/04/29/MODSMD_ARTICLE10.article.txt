# Press gets chance to query Reagan
## President defends Poindexter, discusses values in education 
### 
WASHINGTON — President Reagan said yes
terday that former national security adviser
John Poindexter may have withheld informa
tion from him about diversion of Iran arms
sales proceeds to the Nicaraguan contras be
cause "maybe he thought he was being, in
some way. protective of me."
In a rambling 26-minute interview with six
reporters in the Oval Office, the president said
he does not expect Poindexter to implicate him
in the diversion when Poindexter testifies
before congressional committees investigating
the Iran-contra affair.
Asked whether he is "worried" about being
implicated, Reagan said:
"No, John Poindexter's an honorable man.
And since I was not informed — as a matter of
fact, since I did not know that there were any
excess funds until we. ourselves, in that check
up after the whole thing blew up, and that was,
if you'll remember, that was the incident in
which the attorney general came to me and
told me that he had seen a memo that indi
cated that there were more funds."
Reagan told the Tower special review board
that investigated the arms sale that Attorney
General Edwin Meese 111 had informed him of
the contra diversion last Nov. 24, the day
before Meese made the information public.
The president repeated this assertion yester
day.
According to reports by The Washington
Post and other publications, Poindexter has
told friends that he twice discussed the diver
sion with Reagan, saying it was a "side bene
fit" of the Iran arms sale.
Poindexter declined to talk to the Tower

board and has invoked his Fifth Amendment
right against self-incrimination in refusing to
answer questions by congressional commit
tees last December.
Despite these reports. White House officials
have said Poindexter will not implicate Reagan
when Poindexter testifies under a grant of lim
ited immunity before the House and Senate
select committees investigating the Iran
contra affair.
According to the panels' agreement with in
dependent counsel Lawrence Walsh. Poindex
ter will not be called to testify before June 15.
In the interview, Reagan also elaborated on
his statement April 10 in Los Angeles that
"something should be done about value-free
education." The president was responding
then to a question about conduct of Marine
Corps guards at the U.S. Embassy in Moscow.
He was asked yesterday to comment on his
assessment of the condition of society's values.
"I hope that the imprint would be one of high
morality," he said, repeating in almost Identi
cal form a story he had told in Los Angeles
about a "value-free" counselor who refused to
tell students that they should return a lost wal
let containing $1,000 to its owner.
Reagan was then asked what schools should
teach about acquired immune deficiency
syndrome (AIDS).
"Well, I'm sure that . . . AIDS is probably
going to somewhat tie in with the prevalence of
sex education in the schools today," he replied.
"And I have been very disturbed that under
this same theory of no values being taught —
value-free education — that how do you . . .
start talking about sex to children and to

young people without the moral side of that
question being brought up? Just treat It like a
physical thing such as eating a ham sand
wich? And too much of this is going on."
Reagan said he was "shocked" when he read
that a Unitarian Church, which he did not
identify by denomination, had Issued con
doms as part of an effort to reduce the spread
of AIDS. He referred to them as "preventives"
and said children also should be taught
"abstinence" from sex.
"There is one of the Ten Commandments
that deals with that particular problem," he
said in an apparent reference to the one
prohibiting adultery.
White House spokesman Marlln Fltzwater
said after the Interview that Reagan did not
have anything specific in mind when he said
Polndexter might be trying to be "protective" of
him.
Fitzwater noted that Reagan had first said
that he did not know why Polndexter withheld
information, and Fltzwater said Reagan's an
swer was speculative because "the president
genuinely doesn't know" why Polndexter had
not kept him informed.
The interview yesterday revived an experi
ment, first tried in the White House four years
ago. to make Reagan available to the media
without subjecting him to the rigors of a na
tionally televised prime-time news conference.
The interview was conducted by reporters
representing The Baltimore Sun, the Chicago
Sun-Times, The Cleveland Plain Dealer,
Knight-Ridder newspapers, the Los Angeles
Times and The Washington Times.
