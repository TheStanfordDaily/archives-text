# Coffee House seeing a new clientele
## 
### JAY FRY Staff writer 
Sales are up at the Coffee House, which was
remodeled this past summer to attract a more
diverse student group, and. according to one
student manager, the clientele has shifted con
siderably.
"There are a lot more generic Stanford stu
dents in there now." said senior Maria Botte. a
Coffee House student manager. "There's a lot
less tie-dye."
According to Sue Tatum, senior food service
director of Tresidder Memorial Union, Coffee
House business is up since last year, when
some students boycotted the restaurant after
control of its operations was transferred from
the student-run Coffee House Inc. to Saga
Corp., which operates food service industries
on many college campuses.
The customer count has increased 110 per
cent over the 1985-86 figures and sales to date
are up 26.4 percent over the same period,
Tatum said.
The increase in sales and customers over
last year's boycott-caused slump has in turn
put the Coffee House into a "much better" fin
ancial position, said Nanci Howe, assistant di
rector of Tresidder. "It's probably running
close to a break-even operation."
Though she declined to cite specific figures,
Tatum called the Coffee House "financially
sound," even though it lost money last year.
"Our approach is that the Coffee House is here
to provide a service to the community," rather
than running a budget surplus, she said.
Jeff Lougee, Coffee House food service

manager, attributes its broader appeal and the
resurgence of student interest to an increase
in the quality and consistency of service. Also,
he said, "the place looks a whole lot nicer."
"The idea of a typical coffee house isn't real
appealing to the '80s student." said Lougee.
"(Now) it's the same concept, just up-to-date
for the students."
An inside paint job. new signs and increased
entertainment programming were all part of
the changes since Saga took over about 18
months ago, according to Lougee. The Coffee
House now features comedy nights, open
mikes, weekly jazz nights and other special
programming.
Botte, who "absolutely loved" the Coffee
House of several years ago. said "it was much
cozier before. It's way too generic now â€”
frighteningly so," she said. She said the new
Coffee House caters to a wider variety of stu
dents and "makes a lot of people happier, but
it's lost some of its charm."
"I'd like to see a more radical, off-beat place,"
said Botte. "It's changing, people say, to meet
the needs of the times. I'm not sure this is
where I want to go or if I should be the one to
hold the Coffee House back," she said.
Botte, however, said Saga is not solely re
sponsible for the ways in which the Coffee
House has changed. "We are the managers,"
Botte said of the student managers. "It's not
just a token name."
According to Howe, the five student
managers and the Coffee House advisory

board, which also consists of students, control
policy decisions and are guiding the changes.
"(Saga) acts more in a counselor mode than
as a driving force." said Tatum.
"The Coffee House has a lot of overarching
goals to maintain the social atmosphere."
Howe said. Both Saga and the student
managers have to meet the overall goals the
Coffee House Advisory Board creates in order
to retain "the same kind of ambiance and
flavor" the Coffee House previously had.
Tatum said she believes this year the Coffee
House "will meet or exceed" its past financial
levels because of the current efforts toward
"universal appeal. The broad base of Interest is
reflected In the increase in customers."
Botte agreed that "the change has brought
in a lot more people to try the Coffee House.
The fear was that they (Saga) were going to
turn it into a McDonald's. That's not the
story."
According to Tatum, "once everyone found
out that we weren't corporate ogres, they
realized we were not as bad as they thought."
Changes Saga has implemented include an
increase in student responsibilities through
the student managers, more student input
through the advisory board, speedier service,
stable prices, a more varied menu, larger por
tions and an increase in starting wages from
$3.50 to $4.75 an hour, according to Lougee.
The Coffee House contract will be open again
for bidding in 1990 when Saga's current term
expires, said Howe. Tresidder accepts bids for
the contract every five years.
