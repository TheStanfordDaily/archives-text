## THE 						STANFORD DAILY An Independent Newspaper Dry Rush now 
### 
Last week, 20-year-old David Dunshee
drowned in Lake Lagunita. Police think he
probably fell accidently into the water be
cause he was disoriented from drinking. He
was on his way home from a fraternity Rush
party at the Boathouse.
For the second year in a row, fraternity
Rush was marked by a life-and-death crisis.
Last spring freshman David Curry was criti
cally injured in a drunken fight that capped a
night of Rush partying. He survived, but suf
fered a collapsed lung and spent five nights
in intensive care.
Death is perhaps hardest to understand
when it strikes someone young. It seems so
pointless and leaves us feeling especially
helpless to do anything about it.
There is a natural desire to blame someone
or something, for to admit that tragedy can
happen to anyone at any time means we
must admit our own mortality. Some people
respond by calling for drastic or draconian
actions because "something must be done."
Undoubtedly some will now urge the Univer
sity to ban drinking on campus or disband
fraternities. These are extreme measures
that are both unwarranted and not desired.

Nevertheless, it is proper that we pause
and think about how we do things and about
how we can avoid such horrible incidents in
the future. To do otherwise would be not only
callous but irresponsible.
Of all the ideas that will be considered in
the next few weeks, one stands out as
notably constructive — a dry Rush. Rush
parties — more so than other campus parties
or even other fraternity parties — breed a
climate where excessive drinking is encour
aged and even expected. They promote a cul
ture 'of alcohol abuse that invites
catastrophe.
While not all fratemites promote alcohol
abuse, too many do. Thus far, neither the
University nor the fraternities themselves
have been able to control the problem by
selective monitoring.
It would certainly be wrong to say that
Rush caused last year's violent incident or
this spring's tragic death. But if we refuse to
recognize the connection between the Rush
atmosphere and excessive drinking, with all
its attendant risks, we would commit a grave
error.
