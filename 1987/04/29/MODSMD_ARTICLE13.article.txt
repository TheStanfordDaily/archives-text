The loss of the Reagan Library
Is a great loss for the Stanford
community. Surely, everyone will
agree that the papers document
ing the great change this country
has undergone since Reagan took
office is a treasure for any univer
sity to have. In addition, many,
Including myself, consider the
additional Stanford-Reagan tie to
be a boon to Stanford's already
great name.
I had expected that those In
volved In leading the fight against
the foothills location would have
been remorseful at the loss of the
Reagan Library. Rather, judging
from the comments made by
several of the faculty — most
notably Political Science Prof.
John Manley — many of the fac
ulty have not learned the value of
putting aside their petty political
views in favor of what is truly
good for the University.
A recent editorial expressed
relief with the move, claiming
that Stanford no longer is in
jeopardy of being known as a
partisan institution (Daily, April
27). On the contrary, the "slap
across-the-face" that we dealt our
president can only serve to iden
tify the University with Its far-left
"Manley contingent."
In order to avert this partisan
association, I think we should
move the offices of this "Manley
contingent" away from the center
of campus, perhaps to a less con

spicuous location in the vacant
area just beyond SLAC — the site
the "Manley contingent"
originally proposed for the
Reagan Library.

Last week the proposed Reagan
Presidential Library was moved.
Unfortunately, this decision
brings celebration to some mem
bers of our community. They
were opposed to the library be
cause it is, obviously, a tribute to
President Reagan and they
oppose the man and the philoso
phy he represents.
It doesn't matter that the li
brary is more than a tribute. It
doesn't matter that it will be an
extremely valuable public
repository of eight important
years of American history. It
doesn't matter that it will be a
place at which lasting judgments
of the Reagan years will be
researched. It doesn't matter that
the Bay Area Is denied this pri
mary source of information.
Reagan and his Impact on this
society will Intrigue historians,
economists, sociologists and
political scientists for the rest of
this century and well into the
next. As we celebrate 100 years of
being a university, It's sad that
we are shutting doors rather than
opening new ones.
The mistakes are scattered

widely. The University Board of
Trustees lacked foresight and
leadership in regard to the pro
posed sites. The complaint about
putting the bookhouse near the
Dish should be directed toward
these guardians of our alma
mater. I find it not a little
depressing that they think our
foothills are simply more land
upon which to build.
President Kennedy's office
lacked initiative and wound up in
a defensive, reactionary position
throughout the embarrassing
ordeal.
The Faculty Senate — Political
Science Prof, John Manley and
English Prof. Ronald Rebholz
being two of the more simple
minded examples — behaved like
spoiled children. They were con
cerned about losing academic
freedom with a few Republican
bookworms nearby. For a bunch
of dedicated liberal thinkers, I
would assume the Senate would
jump at the chance to have more
conservative-bashing opportuni
ties.
They were also fearful about
tourists for a campus that already
sees 125,000 visitors a year.
Noble thoughts to be sure.
For the last six years our com
munity has been less than gra
cious with this scholarly contri
bution. I am puzzled by those
who feel victory this week. Amid
the stench of self-congratulation,
I have one last question for the
Ronald Reagan Presidential Foun
dation about its decision to bug
out of Stanford: What the hell
took you so long?
