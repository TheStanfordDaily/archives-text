# Comes a time to floss
## 
### 
I decided today that I was going to start flossing my
teeth. I know, I know, I should already be doing this,
but truth be told, I don't. I brush my teeth, yes
Indeed. I brush them before I go to bed at night and
after I get up In the morning. The logic In this pat
tern of dental care Is not exactly clear, because I don't
get up In the middle of the night and eat things. But
just when I have breakfast, my teeth are really clean.

Teeth are the unsung heroes of the body. Think of
how important teeth are in daily life. Without teeth,
what would keep your lips from flopping back and
forth? The English language would suffer greatly.
You couldn't speak through clenched teeth; you
couldn't pass a class by the skin of your teeth; you
couldn't fight tooth and claw. Baring your teeth
would be simply out of the question.
The Bible wouldn't be the same without teeth. "An
eye for an eye. a nose for a nose" just doesn't have the
right ring. Would medieval knights have been armed
to the ears? People who became angry would be
forced to gnash their lips?
Teeth are big business too. You pay a dentist a lot
of money to look in your mouth and poke at you with
a sharp metal instrument. Orthodontists also have a
good racket going. My parents paid one •1,500 to
submit me to three years of unspeakable pain. It was
their idea: the appearance of my mouth didn't bother
me at all. Still. I visited him monthly so he could
twist my teeth away from their God-given position.
Dentures prove how Important teeth are. There are
few other body parts that are commonly replaced
with plastic. In olden days, false teeth were made of
wood. A fiber-rich diet was no problem with these in
your mouth, but splinters were.
Teeth are made of a mineral called apatite. (Yup,
that's pronounced the same as the word associated
with eating). Teeth have the chemical formula Ca-5

Teeth are the unsung
heroes of the body.

(PO-4)-3 (F, CI, OH). In humans, the -OH group is the
proper ending. But apatite Is much stronger and
tougher if it ends in F (Huorine) or CI (chlorine).
That's why you're supposed to rinse with fluoride.
Isn't science neat? Don't try rinsing with bleach. It
might make your teeth strong, but it has some nasty
side effects.
On the Mohs hardness scale, teeth rate a five. This
means that your teeth are harder than a penny and
just a little softer than a knife blade. I have a
geologist friend who tells me all this fascinating in
formation. Not everyone is so lucky — geology majors
are few and far between.
Anyhow. I'm going to floss my teeth. I've come to
this momentous decision not because I've been
struck by a bolt of hygienic lightning, but because
I'm taking an anthropology class this quarter. I've
been learning exactly how important teeth are. I
never before spent so much time discussing den
tistry. Paleoanthropologlsts go wild over the dis
covery of early human teeth. Fossil teeth are
scrutinized, catalogued and interpreted. These teeth
tell scholars what was eaten, how old the individual
was when It was still eating and what kind of
animals the individual would attend family reunions
with. Canines, incisors, pre-molars. molars — teeth
are hot items.
These teeth are approximately four-million-years
old! I can't even picture four million years. Teeth last
longer than any other bone structure in your body.
So I'm going to take better care of mine. In four mil
lion years. I can see some anthropology student ex
amining my teeth. How embarrassing this would be
if I had cavities! It would be like dying in a car acci
dent with dirty underwear on. The shame, the
shame.
