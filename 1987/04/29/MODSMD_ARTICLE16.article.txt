# Re-examining racism
## 
### 
Racism in America is clearly not dead, as the
events earlier this year in Howard Beach, N.Y. and
Forsythe County, Ga. graphically demonstrate. Inci
dents like these should not blind us, however, to the
difficulty in determining the motives for many other
incidents in which the charge of racism is raised. An
action against a member of a minority group is not,
in and of itself, evidence for a claim of racism.

Specifically, we have noticed that claims of this na
ture can often ignore relevant extenuating circum
stances. As a result, individuals frequently make ar
bitrary, and, we believe, premature claims of racist
treatment.
Therefore, when we consider claims of racism in
guises less blatantly hateful than it assumed in For
sythe County, it Is important to be sure that the
charge has been adequately thought out â€” both to
accurately verify its occurrence and to protect the
word from the sort of misuse that is bound to eventu
ally destroy its considerable emotional impact.
Recently, some members of the Stafford commu
nity have seemed especially prone to jump to the con
clusion that an action is racist without considering
other possible motivating factors. This sort of activ
ity can only obscure rational discussion about rac
ism on campus.
For example, a recent article dealt with the Univer
sity's attempt to dissociate itself from claims that it
discriminates against Jews in Its admissions proce
dures (Daily, April 16). As far as we were able to tell,
the principle evidence for any such claim in the first
place is the fact that Jews make up approximately 10
percent of Stanford's student body, as opposed to
more than a third of the student bodies of compara
ble Institutions on the East Coast.
The fact that California has a lot fewer Jews than
New York should be enough to convince anyone,
after a moment's reflection, that this relatively low
percentage of Jewish students is due more to a lack
of Jewish applicants than to a conscious effort to ex
clude them.
Even Incidents that seem blatantly racist at first
glance may have more acceptable explanations. A
friend recently claimed that upon reporting for a job
interview at a local firm, he was told that the position
for which he was applying had already been filled.
After he returned home he called the secretary of the
firm and was told that the position was still open.
Since the friend was Hispanic, he assumed that the
interviewer had simply gotten rid of him by telling
him that the job was closed rather than admitting a
racist bias. Even though this sounded plausible, a

call back to the secretary's supervisor revealed that
the secretary simply didn't know what she was
talking about, and the job was really filled after all.
The controversy over the Western Culture series Is
another area In which rational debate has suffered
from the consequences of premature charges of rac
ism. We cannot count the number of times we have
heard the charge that the current system unfairly
and consciously discriminates against the works of
women and minorities.
As far as we can tell, however, the professors in
volved in the current system are making a valiant ef
fort to stimulate discussion of feminism and
minority issues. They are severely limited by two
simple facts. First, the faculty available to teach
these courses has not, as a rule, been trained to
lecture on minority issues. They have been trained to
lecture on philosophy, history or literature, and that
is what they teach. The University simply does not
have the faculty available to offer a required yearlong
series of cultural anthropology classes.
Second, during most of the time period covered by
the Western Culture series, the second-class status
of women ensured that they could not produce major
works of art or literature, and the lack of contact
with cultures outside of Western Europe ensured
that very few of the works of such cultures would be
transmitted intact. Sure, It would be nice to have a
series on major feminist works of the 13th century or
on the poetry of Zimbabwe and Baluchistan, but
there would certainly be no overabundance of
reading material.
These facts have a sad tendency to be overlooked in
the mad rush to deny that the course Is racially
biased, as everyone scrambles to fix something that
just isn't broken.
The point we want to make is that it should be con
sidered a very serious matter to accuse something or
someone of being racist. The claim should not be
made lightly. Many situations which seem racist at
first glance may not be racist at all or may have sub
tleties that can be lost easily in the emotional ten
sions which often result from a claim of racism.
We certainly don't want to deny that racism is, un
fortunately. alive and well. We do want to ask. please,
that people consider situations from many angles
before they jump to the conclusion that an action Is
motivated solely by racial bias.
This sort of restraint is not easy, considering the
gratifying response one can generate by such a
claim. In the long run. however, we believe that
making accusations of racism only after other possi
ble factors have been ruled out will ensure that the
charge keeps its emotional punch, and isn't diluted
by vain repetition. In the words of George Orwell,
"Don't kill a mosquito with an elephant gun."
