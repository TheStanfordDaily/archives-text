## The 						Store balances convenience with high prices 
### DAWN SHEGGEBY 
Most people visiting The Store
at Tresidder to buy anything other
than Cracker Jacks or a Cherry
Coke have noticed that the prices
seem higher than at off-campus
stores. In fact, they're quite a bit
higher. The same basket of 12
non-food items, randomly chosen,
that costs *34.71 at Woolworth's
will empty your pockets of *43.96
at the Store.
"It's outrageous." said graduate
student Stephen Neale. "They
charge us poor hay fever sufferers
•4.39 for Sudafed and it's only
*2.79 at Walgreens." Many stu
dents feel that The Store is able to

charge high prices because of its
prime location and feel that
they're being ripped off.
"1 only go there for drinks and
maybe a yogurt sometimes," said
senior Emily Ellison, "because It's
just too expensive. It's a
monopoly."
It is true that most students
limit their use of The Store to
snacks and emergencies, accord
ing to sophomore Lisa Martinez, a
cashier at The Store.
"Most people just buy sodas and
little snack items. Penny candy
goes fast, but groceries are at the
bottom of the list," she said.
It is not true, however, that The
Store is making huge profits from

its campus clientele. Rather than
making profits for the Saga corpo
ration. as many believe. The Store
is actually a non-profit division of
the Dean of Student Affairs Office.
As part of Tresidder Memorial Un
ion. which is self-supporting, it
exists to benefit the campus com
munity. not to take advantage of
It.
Why then were the prices in the
informal comparison prepared for
this article 21 percent higher at
The Store? Store manager Cesar
Cervantes gave this explanation:
"We're dealing with a very limited
space — 1.200 square feet — and
so we have limited buying power."
Larger chain stores, like Wool
worth's, can order goods by the
pallet directly from vendors and
get huge discounts, Cervantes
said.
The Store orders by the case
from distributors, who are
"sometimes the third man down."
Cervantes said. Each middleman
adds to the price, he added.
Some items do move fast
enough for The Store to get
volume discounts, however.
"Sodas. That's what we do best,"
Cervantes said. "We all have our
little niche, our forte."
A soda at The Store is 50 cents,
according to Cervantes. Most soda
vending machines on campus sell
the elixirs for 60 cents. Cervantes
also said that condoms are rea
sonably priced.
"At first the Trojan Company
wouldn't have anything to do with
a little account like us. Then they
saw all the awareness training
that's going on down here and
decided to deal with us," he said.
A 12-pack of Trojan Enz costs
•4.59 at The Store, and $3.99 at
Woolworth's.
Beyond The Store's specialties.

Cervantes believes variety is more
important than low prices. "If you
go into a convenience store, they'll
have maybe two kinds of sham
poo. The Store has half an aisle,"
he said.
According to George Davis, a
Store cashier, students tend to
agree. He said he hears com
plaints about high prices only oc
casionally. Students "are just
happy to have someplace on
campus."
Some Store items may be priced
lower than suggested retail price,
since Cervantes said he tries to

offset price changes in each de
partment. He cited candy and
cigarettes as two Items with which
he has resisted price hikes for as
long as possible.
Cervantes does not try to keep
necessities lower priced than
luxuries. "I would feel like I'm
cheating the public. Where would
you draw the line? Some people
think snack items are a neces
sity," he said.
Unquestionably, students with
difficulty in traveling away from
campus to shop are at a disadvan

tage. They will definitely end up
paying more for things they need.
Senior Rob Weitzner, an eco
nomics major who recently went
into The Store Intending to buy
razors and found them too expen
sive. called the high price a matter
of "convenience."
"If you live on campus without a
mode of transportation and you're
unwilling to spend the time biking
all the way to Palo Alto, your only
other choice is to give up shaving
and washing and deodorizing and
all social contact." Weitzner said.
