# SAS: Improving academic life
## 
### MARTHA MOODY Staff writer 
Wouldn't it be great if. . .
You could watch a video of the
class you missed instead of
reading lecture notes?
A computer could drill you on
your German vocabulary?
You could access Socrates using
one of the Apple Macintoshes in
Meyer?
Next fall students may be able to
do these things as a result of the
Students Authoring Software
Project, a new program developed
by IRIS, the Computer Science De
partment, LOTS and Carolyn
Lougee, the dean of undergradu
ate education.
The Students Authoring
Software Project (SAS) gives an in
centive to student programmers
who have a good idea about how to
improve some aspect of Stanford
academics. In addition to a >500
stipend provided by Lougee's of
fice, students receive technical as
sistance from Instruction and Re
search Information Systems
(IRIS).
All programs sponsored by SAS
must somehow "enhance the aca
demic life at Stanford," according
to David Finkelstein, a research
associate at IRIS. Many of the cur

rent projects will be used as teach
ing aides by Stanford professors.
Others will be used by students for
their own Independent study.
Eight student projects are cur
rently supported by SAS. Some
students are writing original
software programs, while others
are adapting existing programs
for a specific purpose.

All programs sponsored by SAS must some
how "enhance the academic life at Stan
ford, " according to David Finkelstein, a
research associate at IRIS.

For example, freshman David
Mennlnger is using a software
package called Amiga, which he
describes as "like Macintosh, but
with sound and color," to make
animated videos. In the fall he
hopes to make videos of an intro
ductory engineering class. At the
beginning of each class, Men
nlnger wants to show what was
covered in the last class.
Greg Bail, a junior in human bi
ology whose area of concentration
is "Forces and Issues Influencing
Human Decision-making," ap
plied to the SAS program for sup-

port of a project he was working
on with Human Biology Prof.
David Sutton. They are working to
develop a graphic model of group
decision- making. Bail said the
project will ultimately produce a
software program that will be used
for educational or public policy
purposes outside of Stanford.
The program has many aca-

demic applications, however. The
main ideas that the model will
contain are commonly used in the
teaching of organizational behav
ior, economics, sociology, psychol
ogy and operations research, as
well as in human and conserva
tion biology.
All of these disciplines are con
cerned with some aspect of the
basic problem that Bail's model
will address: If all members of a
group try to use the group's re
sources in a way that is best for
them as individuals, they may
deplete or destroy the resources of

the group. Thus members of a
group are actually better off If they
cooperate and preserve their re
sources. but they may not realize
this. Ball's model will be a graphi
cal represention of this dilemma,
so that users can see on a graph
how an Individual's decision
changes the set of choices facing
the group.
When completed, the model
could have real-world applications
to problems like disputes over
water rights between Northern
and Southern California. Bail
said.
Senior Kevin Hornbaker. who is
majoring in industrial engineer
ing, is writing a Macintosh
software program that will drill
students In German vocabulary.
The software will contain a
"dictionary" of about 200 words to
which students can add at least
300 more words, Hornbaker said.
The program will give students
words in English or German, and
the student will type the meaning
Into the computer. Then the cor
rect meaning will appear on the
screen. Each German word will
contain all its German meanings.
Similar programs already exist,
Hornbaker said, but they do not
allow students to insert their own
dictionaries.
