# ASSU REAGAN NEWS
## REAGAN "NOT FULLY INFORMED" ABOUT LIBRARY 
### 
President Reagan appeared at the COP office early Friday afternoon. He asked COP member
Carey White (R-Ohio) to take him up to see the site of the Reagan library. White did not want to
disappoint the President by telling him the site was no longer here, so he took him to happy hour
at Ujamaa instead. The President, who had never been surrounded by so many blacks in his life,
said "Well ... you know I never did vote for bussing."
After a few drinks, however, Reagan was much more at ease, and was reportedly getting down
with the " Jammin' B Wing Bruhs." He was later found passed out in the room of former Stanford
Objectivist leader Donna Regenbaum.
Regenbaum informed the President on the removal of the library from the Stanford campus.
Reagan; puzzled, asked how they could remove an entire building and asked for a phone to call
the Hoover Institution to speak to some "real Americans —God-loving, God-fearing, and finan
cially solvent!"
Informed sources say that Reagan and Regenbaum then went on a raid to the Stanford Demo
crats club, where Reagan apparently peed all over the Gary Hart posters and spray-painted "Bush
is Great in '88" all over.
Reagan later met up once again with Carey White, who asked him to help write this week's edi
tion of the ASSU NEWS. Sure, Carey," Reagan said, "anything to help a fellow president."
