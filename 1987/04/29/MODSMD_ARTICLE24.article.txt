# REPUBLICANS GET INVOLVED, TOO
## 
### 
WHO Kim Crawford (R-Illinois), a member of the Council of Presidents, has been
working hard, as all Republicans are told to do, on a resource called "A Guide to Student
Involvement at Stanford." It will be an A to Z directory that lists every student activity
and group available at Stanford.
WHAT The Guide will be divided into separate sections, including Student Govern
ment (ASSU, COP, The Reaganites); Politics (SOSA, BSU, Stanford College Republicans,
Reagan Fan Club, Republicans for Nuclear War, Republicans for Less Financial Aid, etc.);
Publications; Religion; and many, many others. I can't remember them all, you know.
The mind's just not what it used to be when I was governor of. . . uhh. . . California. Yep.
WHY Well .. . what Kim needs from you folks are the student activities, clubs, and
groups she hasn't collected yet, so she can go ahead and put it in the Guide. She told me
herself, that she's looking for the "best-kept secrets" on campus. I told her some of my
own best-kept ones, but I think I embarrassed her a little when I told her about the night
before with Nancy.
WHEN Now, more than ever before.
HOW Drop by the COP office, or give them a call. The number is 725-1465.
