# CLEAN ADMINISTRATION

### 
Pick one:
□ No one in the current Administration has ever been indicted
for any major crime. They are very nice.
□ Jim Bakker is a virgin.
□ ASSU will get off its bum and start this project.
Okay it's time for an ASSU Student Poll. We're now entering
the tinal stages of the laundry & dry-cleaning service idea — we
now have a space for it — and we need to convince some
holdouts in the Serious Budget Constraints Committee (Serßud
Con Com) that it's a decent idea. Gotta have some market survey
data, you know?
Call Kim Crawford at the Council of Presidents Office,
725-1465, and leave a message. Make it nasty. She loves words
like "dirty underwear", and "smelly socks." Or drop this off at
the COP office in the ASSU. Or don't. It's your decision! We
believe in the free market.
———————Clip and bring in to the ASSU!————
I would use an ASSU laundry & dry-cleaning service:
□ Once a month.
□ To clean my blue plaid suit to wear to IBM interviews.
□ When I run out of quarters.
□ For my $5,000 dresses.
□ Maybe, like, for serveral garments a week.
□ Because I am too cheap to buy new condoms each time.
□ Probably several times an hour.
I would trust ASSU to handle my clothes
□ The hell you say.
□ Yeah maybe.
I would use the ASSU laundry service if it were:
□ 10% cheaper than the real world.
□ 10% more expensive (I just love student-run services).
□ Free.
