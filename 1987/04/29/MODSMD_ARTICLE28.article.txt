# REAGAN SPEAKS FOR HIMSELF
## 
### 
icsk ent Reagan spoke to the ASSU Senate recently on the topic of student involvement and how a few ded
icated students with patience and balls (or ovaries) can make a tremendous impact on the University when
they see things going wrong. Here are excerpts from his remark:
now w ! iat h a PP er, ded with the inner Quad was right after I was shot and before I sent the
Marines to Beirut. In the early '80s the Stanford planners decided to do something about the unsightly inner
Quad which used to be only gravel as asphalt. The staff developed a million-dollar plan, approval was gained,

Now I know you think you can't change a million-dollar project just because one student objects. But you
can. He worked long and hard to make his case, and the University administration changed their plans. So,
lour years ago, when the inner Quad renovations went through — brick-surfaced floor, planters, and lighting
- t icy were able to do it with great beauty because he had spoken up. That's what America needs. You
know, when I see young people like that speaking up, it warms my heart."
LHere the President took a question from ASSU Senator Ben Garcia: Did the President support those speaking
up in White Plaza for gay rights, peace in Central America, and a diverse Stanford curriculum.]
"Well, Ben, I guess 1 was referring to real Americans.
Anyway, then there was the law students' recreation center —that huge new building obscuring the Cro
Mem courtyard. When the first set of ideas went to the Trustees for their approval, a young man named
Chris, who was a student member on the Trustee Committee on Finance and Administration, looked at them
and said. You know, I know buildings, and I really don't think these plans will do. You have several prob
ems which will make this building a mistake . .." And he listed them. The Trustees listened, sent the plans
back, and changed the whole design.
"Now I know some of you out there are wondering about my library and what happened there. Well, I
think that s a darn good example of student involvement there, also. There is a University Committee on
Land and Building Development which loooks at things like my library, and even though the Foundation and
some University adminstrators were able to railroad the initial siting decision past just about everybody that
committee still looked at it. 1 Y
Of course, they didn't do anything about it because the two students who served on it were radically
outvoted. But those two courageous students. Heather and Jane, kept up with the issue. They went to every
meeting, absorbed every bit of information they could get, and met with administrators outside of meetings
to learn even more. They asked the ASSU for help. They kept the issue alive, and soon the Faculty Senate
caught on Then there was a referendum. The students voted against the site. Now my library won't he here
Sort of makes you wonder . . . Why won't it be here? Was it Khadaffy? Was it Bush? Was it Oliver North?
Was it Gary Hart? Was it Heather and Jane?
"But that's okay, because we know who they are. I think their student loans are about due. And even if I
don t have many real men on the National Security Council anymore, I know where to find them. George
Bush is a real man. Isn't he? We're not going to let this one by, are we? You be your little Stanford A.B. we're
not! ..."
What do you think the moral of this story is?
Students who care can change things - and if they're on a University committee, they can REALLY chanqe thinqs
Knowledge, status, contacts, man.
Okay, students dtdn t move the library all by themselves. But they sure helped.
How many times did you hear people say the Reagan Library was a dead issue, a closed issue, or no longer an issue? Stu
i™d%%sion' community members didn 't Relieve that. They believed it is never too late to do something to change a
