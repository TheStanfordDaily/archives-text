# Coed squad planned
## Cheerleaders get go-ahead 
### LAURA REED 
The Athletic Department has approved the organi
zation of a new coed cheerleading squad indepen
dent of the Stanford Band or Dollies.
According to sophomore Kris Jessen, the squad
would perform routines with gymnastic stunts to
excite and inspire the crowd â€” in a style similar to
that of other college cheerleading organizations.
Jessen, an All-America cheerleader in high school,
said she decided to organize the group after realizing
during Dollie tryouts that she wanted to cheer with a
squad that competed nationally and performed with
a more athletic, crowd-interactive style.
"Our purpose wouldn't be only to yell during the

game, but to add another element to the games by
performing competitive routines with partner
stunts, mounting techniques and possibly tum
bling," she said.
Although he said he doubted students would ini
tially support the idea, Geiger said he was enthusias
tic about the effort to "inspire" Cardinal athletes.
"If people will welcome cheerleaders who ask for
more crowd participation, I think this could add a lot
to athletic events," Geiger said. "It would be good to
see a change in the contemplative, observing ap
proach of the fans. The crowd really responds to our
teams when they do well, but sometimes we need to
get excited (even) when it's hard
to."
Jessen said the squad would
supplement the traditional spirit
raising activities of the Band and
the Dollies.
"We would cheer at basketball
games only, and maybe we could
work out something with the
Band and the Dollies for Big
Game," Jessen said. "The Band
and the Dollies currently only per
form at some of the home basket
ball games and not very many of
the away games."
But Band Manager Todd Olsen

said the Band and the Dollies
already attend all men's and most
women's home basketball games.
"We were surprised when we
heard about It because we are
already doing all those things like
entertaining and interacting with
the fans." he said.
Olson said the Band wished Jes
sen success and would be happy
to coordinate with her group. He
cautioned, however, that Stanford
students have exhibited an "anti
rah-rah" mentality in the past.
Jessen said tryouts for the new
squad will be held at the end of the
quarter. The group of 10 to 14
males and females will be selected
based on their performance of a
cheer set, Jessen said.
