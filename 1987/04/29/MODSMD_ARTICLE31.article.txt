## Savoyards return in witty form with 'Ida' 
### ANDREW BERKOWITZ Staff writer 
There are two distinct images
that the word "opera" brings to my
mind. The first is the Bugs Bunny
cartoon In which Bugs leaves his
white glove in midair, directing a
particularly high note, and
causing a rather portly opera star
to Implode on the Saturday morn
ing cartoons. The other Image,
not nearly as destructive but
equally horrid, is the recurring
nightmare I have as the result of
an Italian opera to which I was
subjected last year after accidently
winning free tickets on the radio. I
occasionally awake during the
night screaming lines from "La
Travlata" at the top of my lungs;
although, on the bright side, my
roommate now professes the abil
ity to order a pizza in two lan
guages.
Luckily, the Stanford Savoy
ards' production of "Princess Ida,"
which continues this weekend at
Dinkelspiel Auditorium, is neither
horrid nor, for that matter, an
opera. "It's light opera, an
operetta," says cast member Tracy
Grey. "It's not Wagner." And for
me, just cultured enough to
realize that Wagner Is not a brand
of power tools, this came as a
great relief.
As it turns out, Gilbert and Sul
livan's "Princess Ida" is both
delightful and in English (Do you
know any Italians named Gilbert
or Sullivan?) Although not as well
known as other Gilbert and Sul
livan operettas such, as "The
Pirates of Penzance" and "H.M.S.
Pinafore," "Princess Ida" contains
the same familiar, lovely melodies
and witty lines.
The plot could be described as a
19th-century sitcom. Set in Vic
torian England, "Princess Ida"
tells the tale of Prince Hilarion

(Dan Gensemer) and Princess Ida
(Cheryl Blalock), who were
married to each other by their
regal fathers at the ages of two and
one respectively. Twenty years
later, Prince Hilarion is waiting
for a first glimpse of his bride,
who he has not seen since the
wedding day. But, as his luck
would have it, Princess Ida has
founded a "for-women-only" col
lege In Castle Adamant, where she
teaches her beautiful young stu
dents about the evils of men. "A
man, however well-behaved, at
best is only a monkey shaved,"
sings the Princess to the gathered
ladles.
Doing what any Prince whose
wedding night has been delayed

for 20 years would do, Prince
Hilarion and his two close friends
Cyril (Martin Tobias) and Florian
(BUI Rehor) sneak into Castle
Adamant, dressed as women, in
order to reclaim Ida as his rightful
bride. The ending, which will not
be revealed here, is somewhat
more reserved than one would ex
pect from the typical "guys sneak
into an all-girls school" plot.
One of the primary reasons this
production succeeds Is that most
of the players are not from Stan
ford. Operas, whether light, regu
lar or grand, are not the sort of
thing that can be thrown together
with the usual "Yo, dude, let's put
on an opera" sort of attitude that
makes many Stanford produc

tions so energetically successful.
Singing Is a very demanding dis
cipline. While concentrating on
stage movements, "sometimes you
forget to do the fundamentals like
breathe," notes the female lead
Blalock. Virtually all of the leads
are experienced singers from
around the Bay Area, many of
whom have been seen in previous
Savoyards productions. Gen
semer, whose Prince Hilarion
bears both a dramatic and facial
resemblance to Mickey Dolenz of
the Monkees, brings a charming
and funny demeanor — and a
strong voice — to his role, while
Blalock, who was last seen as
Mabel in the Savoyards' "Pirates of
Penzance," shows off her consid
erable vocal abilities as Princess
Ida.
Equally Impressive is the or
chestra (yes, Dink has an or
chestra pit), which accompanied
the cast flawlessly on opening
night, a rarity for musical produc
tions on campus. An advantage of
Dinkelspiel is that both the or
chestra and the players can be
heard clearly throughout the
auditorium, a welcome change
from the cavernous expanses of
Memorial Auditorium.
Certainly this production of
"Princess Ida" is not for everyone.
Opera buffs who have been raised
on professional opera should note
that this is not the San Francisco
Civic Opera and realize that they
will probably be able to pick out
some flaws. However, if you are a
fan of light opera, or wish to
become one (a fan, not a light
opera), then this is a fun and inex
pensive way to fool your date into
thinking you have some culture,
and it's classier than the Flicks.
Tickets are available at Tresid
der for "Princess Ida," which plays
May 1 and 2 at 8 p.m. and May 3 at
2:30 p.m. in Dinkelspiel Audi
torium.

Certainly this production of
"Princess Ida" is not for everyone.
Opera buffs who have been raised
on professional opera should note
that this is not the San Francisco
Civic Opera and realize that they
will probably be able to pick out
some flaws. However, if you are a
fan of light opera, or wish to
become one (a fan, not a light
opera), then this is a fun and inex
pensive way to fool your date into
thinking you have some culture,
and it's classier than the Flicks.
Tickets are available at Tresid
der for "Princess Ida," which plays
May 1 and 2 at 8 p.m. and May 3 at
2:30 p.m. in Dinkelspiel Audi
torium.

It's fun to be in a light operetta; just ask any of the three gentlemen
above, who star in "Princess Ida." From 1-r: John Musgrave, Ed
Glazier (kneeling) and Macduff Hughes.
There are two distinct images
that the word "opera" brings to my
mind. The first is the Bugs Bunny
cartoon In which Bugs leaves his
white glove in midair, directing a
particularly high note, and
causing a rather portly opera star
to Implode on the Saturday morn
ing cartoons. The other Image,
not nearly as destructive but
equally horrid, is the recurring
nightmare I have as the result of
an Italian opera to which I was
subjected last year after accidently
winning free tickets on the radio. I
occasionally awake during the
night screaming lines from "La
Travlata" at the top of my lungs;
although, on the bright side, my
roommate now professes the abil
ity to order a pizza in two lan
guages.
Luckily, the Stanford Savoy
ards' production of "Princess Ida,"
which continues this weekend at
Dinkelspiel Auditorium, is neither
horrid nor, for that matter, an
opera. "It's light opera, an
operetta," says cast member Tracy
Grey. "It's not Wagner." And for
me, just cultured enough to
realize that Wagner Is not a brand
of power tools, this came as a
great relief.
As it turns out, Gilbert and Sul
livan's "Princess Ida" is both
delightful and in English (Do you
know any Italians named Gilbert
or Sullivan?) Although not as well
known as other Gilbert and Sul
livan operettas such, as "The
Pirates of Penzance" and "H.M.S.
Pinafore," "Princess Ida" contains
the same familiar, lovely melodies
and witty lines.
The plot could be described as a
19th-century sitcom. Set in Vic
torian England, "Princess Ida"
tells the tale of Prince Hilarion

(Dan Gensemer) and Princess Ida
(Cheryl Blalock), who were
married to each other by their
regal fathers at the ages of two and
one respectively. Twenty years
later, Prince Hilarion is waiting
for a first glimpse of his bride,
who he has not seen since the
wedding day. But, as his luck
would have it, Princess Ida has
founded a "for-women-only" col
lege In Castle Adamant, where she
teaches her beautiful young stu
dents about the evils of men. "A
man, however well-behaved, at
best is only a monkey shaved,"
sings the Princess to the gathered
ladles.
Doing what any Prince whose
wedding night has been delayed

for 20 years would do, Prince
Hilarion and his two close friends
Cyril (Martin Tobias) and Florian
(BUI Rehor) sneak into Castle
Adamant, dressed as women, in
order to reclaim Ida as his rightful
bride. The ending, which will not
be revealed here, is somewhat
more reserved than one would ex
pect from the typical "guys sneak
into an all-girls school" plot.
One of the primary reasons this
production succeeds Is that most
of the players are not from Stan
ford. Operas, whether light, regu
lar or grand, are not the sort of
thing that can be thrown together
with the usual "Yo, dude, let's put
on an opera" sort of attitude that
makes many Stanford produc

tions so energetically successful.
Singing Is a very demanding dis
cipline. While concentrating on
stage movements, "sometimes you
forget to do the fundamentals like
breathe," notes the female lead
Blalock. Virtually all of the leads
are experienced singers from
around the Bay Area, many of
whom have been seen in previous
Savoyards productions. Gen
semer, whose Prince Hilarion
bears both a dramatic and facial
resemblance to Mickey Dolenz of
the Monkees, brings a charming
and funny demeanor — and a
strong voice — to his role, while
Blalock, who was last seen as
Mabel in the Savoyards' "Pirates of
Penzance," shows off her consid
erable vocal abilities as Princess
Ida.
Equally Impressive is the or
chestra (yes, Dink has an or
chestra pit), which accompanied
the cast flawlessly on opening
night, a rarity for musical produc
tions on campus. An advantage of
Dinkelspiel is that both the or
chestra and the players can be
heard clearly throughout the
auditorium, a welcome change
from the cavernous expanses of
Memorial Auditorium.
Certainly this production of
"Princess Ida" is not for everyone.
