# The
						new Bowie album: Surprise! It's good!

It really looked like it was all over this
time. David Bowie seemed truly hell-bent
on destroying himself. There are a lot of
contenders for the title of Most Boring
Man in Rock, but it looked like Bowie
would capture the prize, no sweat. Ever
since he sang himself into a corner with
"Let's Dance," he has milled around un
certainly, unsure of which way to go. And
then he — how to put this gracefully? —
decided to commit artistic "hari-kari" and
signed a deal with Pepsi-Cola. Pepsi will
sponsor Bowie's upcoming tour and he.
In turn, will do some fancy hustling on
the company's behalf in an upcoming
commercial.
As someone once moved to tears by

Bowie's every hairstyle, I could only
respond with a loud, sustained raspberry.
Not, of course, that he would ever notice.
Bowie's got the money tone, a double
glaze against time and weather. Multi
million dollar contracts can do that to
you; they tend to make whining, resentful
fans look pretty trivial by comparison.
"Fans? Let them drink soda pop."
But did Bowie really gain a huge audi
ence with "Let's Dance" just so he could
sell out his mystique for cold hard cash?
The god of mirrors has become a lowly
slave to Mammon. Twas not always so.
No, in the '70s, David Bowie was an idea
in motion, rock's sleek avatar of moder
nity. His Ziggy Stardust character was a
virtual slap in the face to progressive
rock, to the boring slobs who thought
rock music should ape classical music In

order to be taken seriously. Bowie
pranced through the ruins of '60s coun
terculture: "Ziggy Stardust" parodied the
notion of rock-star-as-messiah while the
"Diamond Dogs" album, with its famous
opening line "This ain't rock and roll, this
is genocide!", painted a broader picture of
social decay.
Bowie then concentrated on his own
personal disintegration, as his wigged
out lifestyle caught up with him.
Throughout all the changes of music and
image, though, he remained a compelling
figure. Once you met his weird, perma
mently dilated gaze you couldn't turn
away. Certainly the British rock world
couldn't, for Bowie's every hiccup was
widely copied by a horde of trendies and
poseurs. Culture Club, The Human
League, Duran Duran — the early '80s

saw the Invasion of the Bowie People.
After 1980's "Scary Monsters" album.
La Bowie dropped out of sight for a while,
only to come back with a completely dif
ferent set of priorities. There is a theory
that Bowie has always been a mirror for
the times, that every age gets the Bowie it
deserves. Accordingly, Bowie was the per
fect rock star for the Me Decade '70s be
cause so much of his music was self
obsessed. Then In the age of Thatcher
and Reagan, he became an aristocratic
entertainer, musically conservative
despite all his lip-service to liberal causes.
I don't think Bowie is quite as obvious
as that, but there's no denying that In '83
he didn't want to be arty, he wanted to be
big. Instead of releasing "Let's Dance." he
could've saved himself the trouble and
taken out newspaper ads saying "send

money now." Some of the music was
good ("Modern Love," the title song), but
you couldn't help but hear a cash register
merrily clinking away underneath the big
band,sound.
Then came 1984's "Tonight." the quasi
album nobody remembers. Bowie him
self, doing some furious backpedaling.
now calls it "a desperate mistake." Which
brings us back up to 1987 and the Pepsi
deal. Maybe in his commercial he'll
wander into Michael J. Fox's apartment
looking for something to drink. With his
new "rocker" image, Bowie looks like an
advertiser's idea of a rock star. Or more
precisely, a Pepsi marketing executive's
idea of one.
So it was with very low expectations
