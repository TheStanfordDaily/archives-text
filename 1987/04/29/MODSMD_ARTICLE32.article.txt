# The 						new Bowie album: Surprise! It's good!
## 
### MARK TOMPKINS Editorial staff 
It really looked like it was all over this
time. David Bowie seemed truly hell-bent
on destroying himself. There are a lot of
contenders for the title of Most Boring
Man in Rock, but it looked like Bowie
would capture the prize, no sweat. Ever
since he sang himself into a corner with
"Let's Dance," he has milled around un
certainly, unsure of which way to go. And
then he — how to put this gracefully? —
decided to commit artistic "hari-kari" and
signed a deal with Pepsi-Cola. Pepsi will
sponsor Bowie's upcoming tour and he.
In turn, will do some fancy hustling on
the company's behalf in an upcoming
commercial.
As someone once moved to tears by

Bowie's every hairstyle, I could only
respond with a loud, sustained raspberry.
Not, of course, that he would ever notice.
Bowie's got the money tone, a double
glaze against time and weather. Multi
million dollar contracts can do that to
you; they tend to make whining, resentful
fans look pretty trivial by comparison.
"Fans? Let them drink soda pop."
But did Bowie really gain a huge audi
ence with "Let's Dance" just so he could
sell out his mystique for cold hard cash?
The god of mirrors has become a lowly
slave to Mammon. Twas not always so.
No, in the '70s, David Bowie was an idea
in motion, rock's sleek avatar of moder
nity. His Ziggy Stardust character was a
virtual slap in the face to progressive
rock, to the boring slobs who thought
rock music should ape classical music In

order to be taken seriously. Bowie
pranced through the ruins of '60s coun
terculture: "Ziggy Stardust" parodied the
notion of rock-star-as-messiah while the
"Diamond Dogs" album, with its famous
opening line "This ain't rock and roll, this
is genocide!", painted a broader picture of
social decay.
Bowie then concentrated on his own
personal disintegration, as his wigged
out lifestyle caught up with him.
Throughout all the changes of music and
image, though, he remained a compelling
figure. Once you met his weird, perma
mently dilated gaze you couldn't turn
away. Certainly the British rock world
couldn't, for Bowie's every hiccup was
widely copied by a horde of trendies and
poseurs. Culture Club, The Human
League, Duran Duran — the early '80s

saw the Invasion of the Bowie People.
After 1980's "Scary Monsters" album.
La Bowie dropped out of sight for a while,
only to come back with a completely dif
ferent set of priorities. There is a theory
that Bowie has always been a mirror for
the times, that every age gets the Bowie it
deserves. Accordingly, Bowie was the per
fect rock star for the Me Decade '70s be
cause so much of his music was self
obsessed. Then In the age of Thatcher
and Reagan, he became an aristocratic
entertainer, musically conservative
despite all his lip-service to liberal causes.
I don't think Bowie is quite as obvious
as that, but there's no denying that In '83
he didn't want to be arty, he wanted to be
big. Instead of releasing "Let's Dance." he
could've saved himself the trouble and
taken out newspaper ads saying "send

money now." Some of the music was
good ("Modern Love," the title song), but
you couldn't help but hear a cash register
merrily clinking away underneath the big
band,sound.
Then came 1984's "Tonight." the quasi
album nobody remembers. Bowie him
self, doing some furious backpedaling.
now calls it "a desperate mistake." Which
brings us back up to 1987 and the Pepsi
deal. Maybe in his commercial he'll
wander into Michael J. Fox's apartment
looking for something to drink. With his
new "rocker" image, Bowie looks like an
advertiser's idea of a rock star. Or more
precisely, a Pepsi marketing executive's
idea of one.
So it was with very low expectations
indeed that 1 crawled to Tower Records, a
funeral march playing in my head, to pick
up "Never Let Me Down." Bowie's new al
bum. I wasn't cheered by the news that

Peter Frampton was the album's
guitarist, proving that old guitar heroes
never die. they just go on to become hack
sidemen. The horrible, horrible cover
didn't help much: A confounding exercise
in silliness and trashy taste, it shows
Bowie playing in a stylistic romper room.
A cover like this is probably Bryan Ferry's
worst nightmare.
But then I played the damn thing, and
somehow, with the diamond dogs of
credibility yapping at his heels, Bowie has
produced something of worth. "Never Let
Me Down" isn't exactly a masterpiece, but
it's a quantum leap forward from "Let's
Dance" and "Tonight." And hey,
Bowiephiles have to take what they can
get nowadays, baby spiders and all.
The first song, "Day-In Day-Out," is by
no means one of the album's finer mo
ments. The mix here is slightly tougher
than the dance version heard on the
radio, but I still cringe at the histrionic
vocals which announce: David Bowie
has gotten concerned. Specifically, con
cerned about the homeless in America, no

doubt a burning concern of his up there
in his Swiss chateau. Lyrically, the one
interesting thing about the song is that
its homeless female protagonist, who is
also an addict, ultimately decides to get a

shotgun — apparently she's going to vent
her frustration and blow somebody away
— and Bowie shows no sign of condemn
ing her for doing so. Musically, there's
some nice piano buried in the mix, but

those "Oo oo's don't help matters any.
"Time Will Crawl" Is where things get
Interesting. The music Is deceptively
light, although a lonely horn creeps In
now and then. Bowie recounts Images of
disaster In terms that are both fantastic
and chillingly literal. There's a nasty little
parable hiding in one verse: "You were a
talented child/You came to live in our
town/We never bothered to scream/When
your mask went on/We only smelt the
gas/As we lay down to sleep." When he
sings about his own past, things are no
better: "I got a bad migraine/That lasted
three long years/And the pills that I
took/Made my fingers disappear."
Somewhat similarly, Bowie litters "Beat
of Your Drum" with references to himself;
the song, if I may be so bold, could either
be him expressing a weariness with his
own past or dismissing his many im
itators. The swinging chorus finds our
hero delighted to find someone new,
presumably because she doesn't remind
him of himself.
The title song Is inspired by Bowie's

long-term relationship with his personal
assistant Coco Schwab who, according to
lurid music-biz gossip, is Mrs. Bowie in
all but name. Evidently Schwab's task, for
some time now, has been to see that
Bowie puts his jammies on each night
and doesn't do himself any lasting
damage, as he threatened to do with his


chemical adventuring in the mid
'7os. The song is gentle, even
wispy; Bowie sounds like he'd
break if you so much as tapped
him. What's refreshing is that he
sounds almost feminine, whereas
on all his other recent love songs
he's used a pompous croon, des
perate to prove that he wasn't at
all limp-wristed any more.
Side one ends with "Zeroes," a
hilarious '60s parody and stylistic
tour-de-force. Opening with the
sound of screaming teenybopper
fans, a la the Beatles at Shea
Stadium, Bowie giddily runs
through every Monkees and
flower-power cliche imaginable,
the insipid vocals creating a
feeling of sugary optimism. The
song ends in a pyramid of sitar ef
fects and spacey backing vocals;
you'd think the ghost of John Len
non paid Bowie a visit in the re
cording studio. Groovy, as they
said at the time.
"Glass Spider" opens with a dra
matic reading, some solemn non

sense about an ancient glass
spider that abandons its babies.
Thanks. David. You'd think we
were back in the days of his first
few albums, with their laughably
bad science-fiction imagery. Still,
the song works better than you'd
expect, creating an image of a god
less Heaven (and, knowing that,
"Is there anyone in Hell?").
Bowie's up to something in
"Shining Star (Makin' My Love),"
syrupy title aside. The song is
mainly about failed lives, a litany
of drug addiction and death by
disaster — "Eddie Boy lit like
paraffin spending two weeks in a
crack house" (yeah, 1 know, what
would Bowie know about crack
houses?). Bowie and Mickey
Rourke, of all people, team up for a
mid-song rap; when I first heard
about it, I was hoping for Rourke
to growl out something along the
lines of "Now this here boy David
B/Wants to be in the movies all
night and all day/But he ain't like
me/So there ain't no way!" But I
digress. What Bowie and Rourke
actually do is tell the ugly story of a
group of mercenaries who will
"blow heads outta shape for the
name of Trotsky, Sinn Fein, Hitler

cashdown," describing violence
with all the emotion of someone
reading a shopping list. In con
trast, during the chorus Bowie
sings about love with eyes wide

open ("1 could be your great mis
fortune"). It's all very clever, a
tricky balancing act between the
sleek pop surface and what's
going on in the lvrics.

For a dilettante. Bowie has al
ways known his funk and on "New
York's In Love" he proves it with a
backing groove so constricted it
seems to tie itself into knots. A
cool bass knows no banality. The
lyrics find Bowie contemplating
the city, bored with the club scene
and war)' of Mafia killings, and
each line is punctuated by an irre
sistible organ riff.
Unfortunately, the album pretty
much goes p[[fi after that. "87 and
Cry" is about modern-day Eng
land. supposely. but it's stuck in a
numbskull hard-rock crunch and
the lyrics never add up to much.
Even worse is "Too Dizzy." the one
actively bad song on the album.
For the first time the sloppy horns
which will be the death of David
Bowie make an appearance; the
whole thing should've been left to
the likes of Huey Lewis. The finale,
a cover of Iggy Pop's "Bang Bang"
is better, if a bit cryptic.
"Never Let Me Down" fizzles on
the second side, and Bowie has
still sold out. to use a quaint
phrase, to Pepsi. I've always
believed that things go better with
a Coke, and Lord knows there's no
reason to change brands now. But

still, he's snatched a victory from
the jaws of defeat, and with Bowie
promising big things for his up
coming tour I reckon maybe he's
got a few more tricks up his sleeve.
He'd better.
Look on the bright side. It
could've been worse. If Bowie were
really the trendy opportunist he's
made out to be. he would've filled
his new album with Christian
mysticism, and we all know how
bad that could've been. It might be
said that he's trying to have it
both ways on "Never Let Me
Down." with the disparity be
tween the words and the
commercial-sounding music. But
it's easy to set dark lyrics to
gloomy music, like the Cure or any
number of other bands. It's a
tradition Bowie practically in
vented with his Berlin trilogy
(without Bowie, there could be no
Live 105). On his new album
there's an intriguing distance, a
tension even, between the lyrics
and the music. It may not grab
radio programmers or the main
stream audience too much, but
what do they know? Bowie's
showing some backbone again.
It's about time.
