# Walter Hill's 'Prejudice' is a bad thing
## 
### JAMES LUJAN Editorial staff 
"Extreme Prejudice" is a movie
that goes to the extremes with vio
lence. cliches and incoherence.
Director Walter Hill ("The War
riors," "48 Hrs.," "Streets of Fire")
has never been known for his sub
tlety, but at least in films like "48
Hrs." he wisely balanced the
bloodshed with a sense of humor.
In his latest endeavor, however, he
ends up with a film so heavy
handedly serious and so
monotonously deadpan that the
only laughs induced are uninten
tional.
The movie tells the story of . . .
well, it's kind of hard to explain. I
think it would be best if I Just
quote the plot summary given in
the press kit: "Extreme Prejudice
is an action adventure thriller
about six ex-soldiers officially clas
sified as killed-in-action, who are
very much alive and involved in a
covert mission. This special forces
unit clashes with a modern day
Texas Ranger. Jack Benteen (Nick
Nolte), when they infiltrate his
home town. Powers Boothe plays
Cash Bailey. Jack's childhood best
friend now turned worst enemy as
he controls the local drug trade.
To complicate matters. Jack is
haunted by the fact that his
girlfriend, Sarita (Maria Conchita
Alonso), a roadhouse singer, was
at one time Cash's lover." Whew. 1
couldn't have said it any better
than that.
"Extreme Prejudice" aspires to
be an allegoric, modern-day West
ern where the caricatured good
guys are good and the bad guys
are bad. Actually, this movie
might have actually succeeded at
this attempt if it had centralized
its concerns on the relationship
and the rivalry between the char
acters played by Nolte and Boothe.
Instead, the plot becomes so
ridiculously convoluted with the

Involvement of the special forces
unit that the movie loses Its focus
as well as our Interest.
As in any Walter Hill movie, the
story and characters take a back
seat to the action. The film is
riddled with so many bullet
ridden corpses and Mexican
villages that, at times, it looks like
Walter Hill, who went to the Sam
Peckinpah school of filmmaking,
is trying to stage a remake of "The
Wild Bunch." The action scenes
are well done, however, but they

aren't enough and shouldn't be
enough to sustain a film and they
certainly can't sustain this one.
A leaner, meaner Nick Nolte,
who looked a lot better when he
was husky, does nothing more
than prove that he looks silly
wearing a cowboy hat. His stilted,
one-dimensional performance as
Benteen is akin to Clint Eastwood
with a Texas accent. His love in
terest in the film, played by
Alonso, has little to do here, which
is probably good since she can't

act.
On the other hand, Powers
Boothe delivers good support as
Cash and Michael Ironside is ef
fective as the special forces unit
leader, but the performance that
steals the film is given by Rip
Torn, who appears all too briefly
as a long-time friend of Beneen's.
On the whole, as far as action
pictures go, "Extreme Prejudice"
is technically very well done. As far
as good movies go, "Extreme Prej
udice" is extremely unsatisfying.

Nick Nolte can't even face Maria Conchita Alonso, she's such a bad
actress. Nolte is probably wondering when the next shoot-out will be;
there are a lot of them in Walter Hill's new film "Extreme Prejudice."

It used to be that good guys wore white and bad guys black. How times have changed. Above, Powers
Boothe plays a drug kingpin with the improbable name of Cash Bailey while Nick Nolte plays Texas Ranger
Jack Benteen in "Extreme Prejudice."
