Talk about dedication?! As candidates for Council
of Presidents, SLATE OF THE UNION
demonstrated determination and perseverance. We
put $250 on the line to defend the principle of what
we thought was an unfair election policy. Stanford
students need a COP that will go one step further
and give that extra effort.
SLATE OF THE UNION is determined to make
changes that will help the Stanford student today.
We have experienced the ASSU bureaucracy. We
have seen the frustration of our fellow students. We
recognize the divisions that exist in our student
body. And we are committed to making the neces
sary changes.
Our goal is to attack the following:
Quality of Student Life
► Redesign current student IDs;
A laminated picture student IDs.
A use it as your meal card.
A use your excess meals at Tresidder.
A use your ID to charge purchases at the
Bookstore.
► Extend the hours of Meyer and Green Libraries
and explore the possibility of installing
electronic checkout.
► Improve the quality of health care attention at
Cowell.
► Increase student accessibility to dorm based
computer facilities (especially laserwriters!).
► Create an all-campus celebration in the Spring to
unify the student body.
Student Involvement
► Allow students to voice their opinions at Senate
meetings.
► Improve the diversity and quantity of student
representation in the ASSU.
► Continue and expand student involvement in
task forces, intern positions and special
legislative committees.
► Increase student awareness of funding available
for student organizations.
Student Issues
► Work to increasing the quantity and variety of
fields represented by outside firms recruiting on
campus.
► Sponsor a Stanford Awareness Week to provide
groups a forum to express their views on student
concerns.
► Continue pressuring the administration to take
an active stance against apartheid in South Africa.
► Continue to support the suggested renovation of
the Western Culture program.
► Continue to advocate AIDS Awareness and in
crease the accessibility of contraceptives.
► Promote ethnic and academic diversity. Remem
ber that unity is the fusion of different
components; it is NOT conformity of the parts.
SLATE OF THE UNION will implement changes
that will improve student life as well as address stu
dent concerns. We will listen to your ideas and do
our best to incorporate them. We want to see
changes that will benefit students who are here
now. SLATE OF THE UNION believes that our
concerted effort will result in a united student
body.

ate Associate; Intern to Vice-Chair, Black Student Union;
General Representative, Black Student Union; Minority
Admissions Chair, Black Student Union; Vice-President,
Kappa Alpha Psi; Co-Coordinator SWOPSI Class on
Minority Admissions
Over the past few years, Lori Abert, Eric Allen,
Julie Martinez, and Ira Williams have learned,
through a wide range of activities, what it takes to
make things happen at Stanford. We have the know
how and the know-who to convey student concerns
to the administration responsibly and effectively.
Anyone can claim experience and qualification, but
our past involvements and activities speak for them
selves. The COP isn't a job that can be entered with
the intention of "learning the ropes" for the first
few months. The new COP should be ready to take
action right from the start.
* ERICS concentration as an ASSU senator on the
Student Affairs Committee has been to revise the
current Dead Week policy.
* IRA'S position as BSU General Representative has
led him to co-found a SWOPSI class on minority
admissions, which includes training for student
recruiters who will encourage students from
diverse backgrounds to apply to Stanford.
* As Student Activities Coordinator at El Centro
Chicano, JULIE works with student groups on
funding processes, office space problems, and
event planning.
* As Administrative Manager, LORI has gained
inside-ASSU experience by overseeing all new
and existing service projects.
The PLAN'S Plan ...
BUSINESS PROJECTS:
* install video vending machines in Tresidder Un
ion.
* support the opening of Frog's, the lakeside snack
shop at Elliott Program Center
* provide guidance for the new drycleaning service
to ensure its early success.
SERVICE PROJECTS:
* provide financial and managerial guidance to the
SURE Escort Service, in order for this important
project to continue functioning.
* continue Lori's work to bring back the Course
Guide with a new on-line format.
* push for the speedy renovation of the Old
Firehouse and Tresidder Union, as this is critical
to the effective functioning of student groups.
* continue efforts to make Tresidder a better stu
dent union with longer hours, a television lounge
and a study area.
STUDENT CONCERNS:
* address the administration with your concerns
about the lack of preparation time for finals with
the current Dead Week policy.
* provide a previously lacking, yet important voice
for all Greek groups to the administration.
* promote Stanford's true diversity by recruiting
students from a variety of ethnic and economic
backgrounds.
* respond to the overwhelming student vote for di
vestment.
THE PLAN FOR COP ...
DIVERSITY, INNOVATION AND EXPERIENCE.

PHILOSOPHER KINGS

ence

Editor
After three years at Stanford, the Philosopher
Kings feel in touch with the wants and needs of the
diverse student body. We are also aware of the
limitations of the C.O.P.'s power in terms of
shaping university policy. Therefore, our campaign
focuses on issues that we feel are both important
and reasonable. Every project we initiate will be
completed: YOU CAN'T RECORK A BOTTLE. In ad
dition, we are personable, easy to work with, and
bold. Our presence in student government would
help alleviate the massive amounts of stress sur
rounding the bureaucracy, and make students want
to participate in the decision making process. Only
with full student support will the senate ever be
able to achieve its large-scale goals.
Philosopher Kings' Main Policy Goals:
1) Reform the university damage system. For ex
ample, the university charges much more than fair
market value to fix a broken window.
2) Integrate the study of women and minorities
into the Stafford curriculum outside of the already
crammed Western Culture requirement.
3) Establishment of all-night study areas. Study
ing in Lots is not adequate.
4) Longer Winter holiday. It's way too short, man,
and school always starts too late (on Jewish Holy
days every year, coincidentally).
5) Creation of a real (gratefiil) Dead Week. The
current Dead Week system is non-existent and far
too stressful.
6) General student parking permits. PARKING
ANARCHY. For $15,000 a year, you ought to be able
to park anywhere on campus without fear of the
souped-up blue golf carts tracking you down.
6) Accessability. Who are those current C.O.P.
people anyway, and where do they hide? Everyone
knows where the Green Bench in front of Tresid
der is, and that's where we'll be. Regularly.
In conclusion, we would like to thank the elec
tions commission for perfectly illustrating our
contention that the ASSU is inefficient and takes it
self much too seriously. To go through this whole
elections process and then start over again shows
how little gets done under the current bureaucratic
system. The PHILOSOPHER KINGS believe that
much more could be accomplished through the in
fusion of a new positive attitude and the creation of
an enjoyable work atmosphere which we would
surely bring to the ASSU.
Hey, the issues have scarcely changed over the
years, but its about time that the attitudes did. The
PHILOSOPHER KINGS are the only slate that pos
sesses the ability to transform student government
and hopefully get some things accomplished.
Remember, a vote for us is a vote for humanity.
DFOTPK
Total disregard and reckless abandon!

Every year, a handful of C.O.P. slates run for of
fice promising the same old things, and every year
when one is finally elected the same thing happens:
nothing. The EQUALIZERS are different for several
reasons.
• First, we've done our homework. In preparing
to run for office, we talked with over 50 student
group leaders and 1,000 students to find out what
you want done in the ASSU.
• We used this knowledge to develop a compre
hensive program designed to solve the major prob
lems in the ASSU and to make life at Stanford a little
better. Here are some of the problems and our so
lutions;
■ STUDENT SERVICES. We'll be working for
change in several areas of campus life.
i* Entertainment — the ASSU will spon
sor more campus-wide parties and concerts as well
as form a new Entertainment Bureau to assist
dorms and student groups in event planning.
Food Service Task Force — will at
tempt to lower the cost and increase the meal plan
alternatives in the Food Service System.
Change Machine Program — this pro
gram will work to get change and vending
machines into all dorms.
i* Minority Task Force — will investigate
issues such as minority admissions & ethnic studies
and push for necessary change.
■ COMMUNICATION. Each year the ASSU takes in
over $600,000 in student money. Yet students are
rarely asked what they think the ASSU should be
doing. You never even see the C.O.P. or the
senators. We want to make the ASSU more ac
countable and visible. Some of our solutions:
v* White Plaza Office Hours — we'll be
out there once a week, every week.
V Straw Poll — a new organization that
will telephone survey random samples of students
to find out their opinions before the senate makes
its decisions.
u* Dorm Outreach Program — each
C.O.P. member will speak at at least one house
meeting/week.
■ ASSU INEFFICIENCY. Like us, you're probably
sick of the bureaucracy of the ASSU. We'd like to
change it:
Red Tape Task Force — will evaluate
ASSU processes and projects and look for ways to
make them more efficient.
Committee Coordination Commis
sion — will organize the many committee mem
bers into an organization that can more effectively
lobby for student concerns on University commit
tees.
• We're not a bunch of ASSU geeks. We'll be
bringing a wide range of experience and a varied
cultural background into the office.
• Lastly, because it will take a great deal of work
to accomplish our goals, we've made an enormous
commitment. We 11 not only be staying here the
entire summer in order to get a head start, we'll
also be taking classes half-time (9 units max) next
year. No other C.O.P. slate, past or present, has
been this committed to the job.
The EQUALIZERS for COP. It's about time.
