## Seahawks tab Wyman in 2nd Five picked in NFL draft 
### JOHN LIS Editorial staff 
Linebacker David Wyman headed a list of five Stan
ford football players selected In yesterday's annual
National Football League draft. Wyman was a second
round pick of the Seattle Seahawks. the 46th player
chosen overall.
Quarterback John Paye, expected to be tabbed In
the fourth or fifth round, surprised many by staying
on the board until the 10th round. The San Fran
cisco 49ers traded their 11th- and 12th-round picks
to the Los Angeles Raiders for the right to draft Paye.
Wide receiver Thomas Henley and cornerback Toi
Cook will likely remain teammates in the NFL with
the New Orleans Saints. Henley was chosen In the
sixth round. Cook in the eighth.
And defensive tackle Tony Leiker was picked in the
seventh round by the Green Bay Packers, who expect
to use him as a pass rusher at defensive end in a 4-3
alignment.
The Seahawks were expected to look for help at
linebacker, and used their first-round choice to grab
outside linebacker Tony Woods from Pittsburgh. "We
wanted to upgrade our defense," Asst. Public Rela
tions Director Dave Newbert said. "We were looking
for some people who could 'run and hit,' as Coach
Chuck Knox put it."
Pro-Bowler Fredd Young is entrenched at one
linebacking spot in Seattle, but lOth-year man Keith
Butler and special-teamer Sam Merriman are the
only other inside linebackers.
For Paye. his selection by the hometown team was
the only consolation of the day. The Atherton resi
dent had begun the year as a probable first-rounder,
and at one point was being touted for the Heisman
Trophy, but recurring problems from a separated
shoulder sustained in the 1985 season caused his
stock to drop, and he missed the final six quarters of
the 1986 season because of it. . 1
"I thought I was going to go earlier." Paye said,
"though it's some consolation getting drafted by the
49ers. Coach (Bill) Walsh said he knew I was disap
pointed, but he told me other players who were
drafted late have gone on to have great careers, like
Dwight Clark. He said I'll get every chance to make
the team."
