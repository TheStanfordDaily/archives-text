# Card nine avoids loss to humble Stanislaus
## 
### TOM SENF Senior staff writer 
A funny thing happened on the
way to the blowout yesterday.
It never happened.
After beating Stanislaus State
35-0 last year. Stanford needed
four double plays and some clutch
pitching from Rob Wassenaar and
Steve Chitren to squeeze out a 3-2
win over the Division 111 Warriors
at Sunken Diamond.
The victory raised the Cardinal's
record to 35-14, but not before the
Warriors, now 20-23, threw quite
a scare into the nation's No. 6
team.
"We definitely knew the game
wouldn't be like that (last year's),"
said losing pitcher Jeff Noe, who
held Stanford to just four hits and
one unearned run in six innings
of relief. "We wanted to come out
and swing the bats, and we
wanted to have a good game
defensively," he added.
They did both. After mustering
just two hits to the Cardinal's 34
in last year's debacle, Stanislaus
State outhit Stanford 9-8 yester
day, and the Warrior outfield, par
ticularly centerfielder Don Munlz,
made several fine catches.
"I don't think we swung the bat
well in general," Stanford Coach
Mark Marquess said. "We didn't
put enough pressure on them, but
you have to give them credit. He
(Noe) did a good job of mixing his
pitches and getting his breaking
ball over."
"They say don't be flat, but
everybody wants to raise their bat
ting average in these games.
Nobody wants to go 0-for-4,"
centerfielder Toi Cook said. "But
it's a . . . cold day, there are no
fans. It's not like UCLA, with the
whole world here, fading (Alex)
Sanchez or (Randy) Hennis."
Muniz led off the game with a
single off Jim Price, but was
quickly erased by a double play. In
the bottom of the first, Ruben
Amaro laid down starter John
Christian's first pitch for a bunt
single, then Cook pumped his
third offering over the left-field
fence for his eighth homer of the
year and a 2-0 Stanford lead.
Christian walked the next two
hitters, Ed Sprague and Paul
Carey, and the rout appeared to be
on, but Christian managed to
retire the next three batters.
"I was thinking, 'Here we go
again,' but then he gets out of it,
holds us the next inning, and they
get their confidence going," Cook
said.
After two singles and a walk
loaded the bases with no outs,
Price walked Joe Porter to force in
a run and bring Wassenaar out of
the Cardinal bullpen. Adam Hil
pert greeted Wassenaar with an
RBI single to tie the game, but
Wassenaar struck out Dom
Pedretti and started a 1-2-3
double play off the bat of Derk
Damon to end the inning.
"I was just mainly trying to
focus on one hitter, not look at the
whole situation and try to get
ahead," Wassenaar said.
Marquess did not have an expla
nation for Price's fourth straight
rocky outing. "I wish I did," he
said. "His velocity hasn't been
good. He throws some good
pitches, but he hasn't been con
sistent. We have a lot of non

conference games coming up. so
hopefully we can get him back in a
groove."
Price, a tight end on the Card
inal football team, indicated that
spring practice may have affected
his pitching shoulder but that it
did not bother him yesterday.
"Today everything felt good. I was
just erratic." he said.
Stanford pushed the winning
run across in the fifth. With run
ners at the corners and two outs,
Doug Robbins punched a single to

right to score Sprague, who had
reached on an error.
The Warriors made their one
serious threat in the ninth. Pinch
hitter John Frutoz singled with
one out to bring Chitren on for
Wassenaar. Ken Hanf struck out
for the second out, but Craig
Baize kept Stanislaus State alive
with a single to left before Chitren
fanned Muniz to end it and record
his 11th save.
Stanford travels to Buck Shaw
Stadium today for a 2:30 p.m.
contest against Santa Clara.

Stanislaus State Coach Jim Bowen is ejected after arguing a strike
two call on Craig Baize with two outs in the ninth inning. Baize later
singled to keep the inning alive, but Steve Chitren then ended the
Warrior rally.
