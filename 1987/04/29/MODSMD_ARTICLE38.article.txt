# USIU netters visit Stanford needing win for NCAA hopes
## 
### KEN STEVENS Senior staff writer 
Though Stanford is ranked in the top five and U.S.
International Is in the bottom half of the top 20 of the
collegiate women's tennis rankings, it is the Card
inal that might be playing the role of spoiler when
the two teams meet this afternoon at 1:30 at the
Stanford Tennis Stadium.
USIU is on the borderline of qualifying for the
NCAA team championships, which begin May 14 at
the Los Angeles Tennis Center. The Cardinal, 17-3
overall, has secured its spot in the national cham
pionships and is looking to improve its seeding.
"It will be huge for them (USIU)," said Stanford
Coach Frank Brennan, referring to today's dual
match. "A loss won't hurt them, but a win might get
them into the NCAAs."
True to its name, USIU's squad consists almost en
tirely of players from outside of the United States.
Two of the Gulls' top singles performers are Clare
Thompson from Australia and Kefi Binyamini, a
native of Israel.
After sitting out of the singles draw at the Pacific
10 Conference tournament last weekend in Ojai,
senior Patty Fendick will be back in action today to
lead the Cardinal. With wins today and Friday at Cal
ifornia, the defending NCAA singles champion would
complete an undefeated 1987 regular season.
As usual, Fendick will be followed in the Stanford
lineup by senior Stephanie Savides, freshman Lisa
Green and Junior Kay Tittle. Green was a semifinalist
and Tittle a quarterfinalist last weekend in the Pac
-10 singles tournament.
Sophomores Cindy Buchsbaum and Eleni
Rossides will fill out the Cardinal lineup. Rossides
will be playing singles in a dual match for the first
time since March 5 of last season. She advanced to

the finals of the Women's Invitational Collegiate
Singles at Ojai before losing 6-0. 7-6 to UCLA's
Wendy Ouwendijk.
"She's still feeling pretty good," Brennan said.
"Un brtunr.tely, she has a little bit of a groin pull
from her last match. She wasn't warmed up enough.
So we haven't been able to work on her mobility."
Senior Leigh Anne Eldredge, who had to withdraw
from the Ojai tournament due to soreness in her
legs, Is scheduled to play doubles today with
Buchsbaum. Brennan said that Eldredge most likely
would only be able to play a set of singles, so he is
holding her out.
Junior Cari Hagey will also be out of the lineup
again. Hagey, who last played April 4 when she
sprained her left knee, is out for the rest of the regu
lar season but may return for the NCAAs. "She's
moving a little bit more," Brennan said. "I'm kind of
encouraged."
Brennan and Stanford men's coach Dick Gould
have announced the Cardinal lineup for the Cal-
Stanford indoor exhibition Saturday at 7 p.m. at
Maples Pavilion. Fendick will be in the women's
singles match, and freshman Jeff Tarango is sched
uled to play men's singles.
Pac-10 singles champion Patrick McEnroe will
team with Scott Moody in the men's doubles, while
Eldredge and Tittle will play together in the women's
doubles.
Green and Geordie McKee are scheduled to play in
one of the mixed doubles matches, and Savides and
Mark Jacobson will team in the other.
The Cal coaches have yet to announce their
lineups.
