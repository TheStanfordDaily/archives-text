## McCarthy, Cornelius at even-par 150 
### CHRIS CRADER Staff writer 
Few things shine hotter than
the Tucson sun, but the Stan
ford women's golf team was able
to beat the 95-degree heat on the
first day of the inaugural Pacific
10 Conference championships.
After 36 holes the Cardinal is
tied with Arizona State in
second place, only seven shots
behind USC.
The ninth-ranked Cardinal
shot a 310 yesterday morning
on the par-75 Oro Valley
Country Club course in Tucson,
good for a tie for third, but came
back with a 302 in the afternoon
to catch the top-ranked Sun
Devils. The No. 7 Trojans were a
bit more consistant, turning in
rounds of 304 and 301, thanks,
in part, to the play of Tracy
Nakamuri and Kim Saiki. whose
scores of 147 and 149,
respectively, were good enough
to take the top two individual
spots.
Leading the way for Stanford
were senior Kathleen McCarthy
and junior Kay Cornelius who
both carded 150s, putting them
in a three-way tie for third with
Arizona's Kathiyn Imrie.
"Kathleen played her usual

great golf," said Stanford Coach
Tim Baldwin, "and Kay played
her best golf of the year."
McCarthy's 74 in the morning
was one of the day's best, and
she followed it with a one-over
76, while Cornelius was the
model of consistency, shooting a
pair of even-par 755. Also
scoring for Stanford were junior
Trish McGonigle with a 77 and a
79 for a total of 156, sophomore
Clare Dolan at 159 after rounds
of 85 and 74, and senior
Adrienne Gilmartin who posted
rounds of 84 and 77, to finish at
161.
"It was a heck of a comeback
we made," Baldwin said,
"especially Clare and Adrienne.
It showed a lot of intestinal for
titude. It was a really good per
formance by the team."
He was especially impressed
with McGonigle, who was
playing on a ankle she sprained
Saturday night. "I only expected
her to go 18 holes today, so I
thought that was just outstand
ing (that she played two solid
rounds)," he said.
In the team competition, No.
12 Arizona is nine strokes off
the pace at 614 after rounds of
310 and 304 on its home course,
13th-ranked UCLA shot a 311

and a 319 for a total of 630 and
Washington rounded out the
challengers at 637, with marks
of 317 and 320.
Also competing are Washing
ton State, Oregon State and
Oregon, but all have very young
golf programs and cannot keep
up with the nation's top powers.
"The Pac-10 conference Is very
strong," Baldwin said. "It (the
tournament) looks very competi
tive."
He wasn't suprlsed by the
Trojans' great play, and despite
ASU's lofty ranking, he said, "I
think USC has the best balanced
team In the country."
The format calls for 18 holes
each today and Thursday, fol
lowing yesterday's marathon
double round on the 6,300-yard
course, a day Baldwin described
as "very difficult."
The Cardinal is at least
assured of not repeating last
year's performance, when It
came into the conference tourn
ament ranked fourth in the
country and took last in the
event.
With only the NCAA cham
pionships remaining after this.
May 27 to 30 in Albuquerque,
N.M., Stanford is hoping to es
tablish some momentum.
