# CIR proposes policy changes
## Could boost pace of divestments 
### MARK LAWRENCE Senior staff writer 
The Committee on Investment
Responsibility (CIR) has recom
mended unanimously that the
University Board of Trustees
adopt a new selective divestment
policy that could lead to automatic
divestiture of nearly *3 million of
Stanford stock in 10 companies
that do business in South Africa.
In a report to the trustee Special
Committee on Investment Re
sponsibility (SCIR), the CIR said
Stanford should automatically
divest from companies that have
not signed the Sullivan Principles
or have shown poor performance
according to that standard. The
CIR also recommended that Stan
ford not buy new stock in compan
ies that have recently opened
operations in South Africa until
they are given Sullivan ratings.
Stanford now makes divestment
decisions on a case-by-case basis.
In evaluating a company's perfor
mance in South Africa, the CIR
uses a variety of information that
includes — but is not limited to —
adherence to the Sullivan Prin
ciples, a set of standards used to
assess the conduct of companies
doing business in South Africa.
The SCIR, which makes Stan
ford's final investment decisions,
will meet with the CIR May 10 to
discuss the proposal, and the
trustees will vote on the new
guidelines the next day. The CIR
is a 12-member committee of stu
dents, faculty, staff and alumni
that advises the SCIR.
CIR Chairman Frederick Hillier
said he is "hopeful" that the trus
tees will adopt the guidelines. "We
feel we've made a very good case,"
he said.
The trustees In the past have
resisted adopting a divestment

policy based on an objective for
mula. The board has consistently
said Stanford should make invest
ment decisions based on the par
ticular circumstances of a com
pany in question.
SCIR Chairman James Gaither
said last night that he would not
comment on the the proposal un
til the board meets to discuss the
issue next month. "I'll say that I'm
very sympathetic to the problems
they're addressing," Gaither said.
"It's very hard to figure out exactly
what these companies are doing."
ASSU Senator Stacey Leyton
said yesterday that the guidelines,
if adopted by the trustees, might
represent a bold enough step by
the CIR for the senate to change
its recent decision not to appoint
students to the committee for next
year. The senate voted last week
not to appoint the three student
members to the CIR, charging
that the CIR is ineffective in im
plementing Stanford's selective di
vestment policy.
Hillier had asked that the senate
delay its vote on the matter, but
the senate rejected his appeal,
reasoning that it could later vote
to appoint students if the CIR
were to become more effective.
The CIR said in its report of the
proposal that it is unable
"consistently and confidently" to
determine whether a company is
causing social damage in South
Africa using its current evaluation
process, which relies heavily on
information supplied by the com
pany.
"The principles that the CIR
uses vary with the views of the CIR
members who are present and
voice their views at a given
meeting," the CIR report said.
"They also vary with the
