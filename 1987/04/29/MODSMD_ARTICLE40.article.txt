# Card softball sweeps pair from Gilroy JC

### EVAN TUCHINSKY Staff writer 
This weekend's Softball doubleheader
at Palo Alto's Baylands Field, which
pitted the Gavilan Junior College Rams
against Stanford, was reminiscent of the
U.S. invasion of Grenada: There was
some resistance, but the contest was ba
sically a lopsided affair.
In this conflict, however, the neigh
boring force prevailed, with Stanford
beating the Giiroy residents 3-0 and 5-3,
The Cardinal is now 20-2 on the season.
Needless to say, Stanford Coach Taml
Brown was quite pleased. "They stayed
together and played well together," she
said.
"As a team on Saturday we didn't hit
as well in the first or second game as well
as against USC," Brown added. "You
tend to drop to the level of the competi
tion."
The first game clearly belonged to the
Stanford squad, which held the Rams
scoreless behind the pitching of Lisa Bu
chanan. The first inning of the second
game looked equally promising as the

Cardinal scored the first run of that
game.
Then Gavilan came up to bat again,
and scored two runs off a Stanford error
to lead 2-1. The Cardinal rallied back in
a series of turnabouts to give pitcher
Dawn Becker another win.
"Lisa and Dawn pitched very well,"
Brown said. Buchanan is a veteran of
the Cardinal squad, but Becker, a law
student, is a rookie. Graduate students
are eligible for club sports like softball.
"Dawn has come in.and she's like a
blessing." the coach added. "She mixes
speeds very well. She doesn't look hard
to hit but then when you get in the box
she is."
Leading the squad in hitting is Barcy
Fisher, who switched from catcher to
shortstop this weekend due to Injury.
Fisher has a .377 average with 26 hits
and 13 RBI. Vlja Brookshire Is right be
hind her at .315, 23 hits and 9 RBI.
Stanford will need another strong of
fensive effort this weekend, when the
club team plays Santa Clara in another
home doubleheader. "They're going to be
tough." Brown said.
