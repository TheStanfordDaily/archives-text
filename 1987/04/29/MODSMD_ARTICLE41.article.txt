# NCAA gymnasts: True thrillers
## 
### MARK SMOYER Staff writer 
Last weekend, UCLA's Pauley Pavilion
was the site of the 1987 NCAA Men's Gym
nastics Championships, the top
showcase of U.S. gymnasts outside of the
national championships. Leaving the
arena after Saturday night's closing ses
sion, a sort of all-star meet where the top
eight gymnasts in each of the six events
provide almost three hours of continuous
highlight film, one felt extremely un
satisfied.
Elite gymnasts pack so many super
human feats into just a couple minutes of
performance that you never get a chance
to reflect on the last trick, to run it
through in your mind again, lest you miss
the next, perhaps more dazzling, work of
magic. It Is as though you were reading a
great passage from a great novel as the
words moved across a television screen.
Taking a moment to understand the sen
tence that Just ran off the screen would
mean missing the sentence that followed.
When a gymnast moves quickly through a
final set of movements meant to end his
brief passage with an exclamation point,
it takes your breath away; In absorbing
the mastery of his body's strength and
agility, you have no time nor need to take
care of the most involuntary of actions.
To describe to the average person —
i.e., somebody who has never seen world

class gymnastics in person — what ex
actly these athletes do that is so stunning
is impossible. But let's avoid disclaimers
and just go on to certain moments in the
competition that are most vivid in a clut
tered memory of 10 hours of acrobatics.
Early in Friday night's session — the
competition that determines who ad
vances to the team and individual event
championships — Arizona State's Paul
Llnne begins his high-bar routine. The
defending champion Sun Devils did not
qualify for the team competition this year
but Linne did qualify in his specialty.
As Linne begins swinging around the
bar, all knowing eyes turn from the other
five routines being performed to watch
Llnne. who Is ranked No. 2 nationally on
gymnastics' most exciting apparatus.
Having attained the correct speed to
perform the first of two back-to-back
release moves, Llnne lets go of the bar
and. now about 12 feet off the ground,
does a half-twist and a back flip simulta
neously, then a full-twist. So far all he has
done is release the bar at Just the right
time, done a somersault and one-and-a
half twists in midair, so that he is facing
the bar again, and oriented himself after
all this to catch the bar. Seconds later he
will release again, this time flinging him
self from one side of the bar to the other,
and as some of the crowd anticipates this,
so does Llnne. too soon.
After three weeks of training mainly for

this two minutes of gymnastics that will
lead to perhaps a national title in the high
bar, Linne does not make his catch,
something that may have happened one
other time this season, and falls to the
mat in a haze of chalk. With a gasp from
the audience, Linne recommences his
routine, but he has lost all chance to
make the event finals.
Over to the floor exercise now, where
Paul O'Neill, a still-rings expert from
Houston Baptist, prepares for his
specialty's antithesis. Fortunately for the
barrel-chested O'Neill, the floor exercise
does require a strength move among its
many flips. Lying flat on his stomach,
O'Neill puts his arms by his sides, with
his palms down.
The average competitor, at this point,
would slide his hands toward his head to
start a handstand. Not O'Neill, with his
arms straight, he lifts himself less than
inch off the floor and holds there for over
three seconds. This single feat gets loud
applause from his fellow gymnasts and
the fans alike. Now is a good time to try it
yourself.
It's Saturday night. An hour before the
meet is to start, the best of the best go
through their routines at half-speed with
music from U2's latest release playing
softly in the background, giving you a
"Chariots of Fire" kind of feeling.
The meet starts with a bang, as
former World Tumbling Cham
pion Chad Fox of New Mexico ef
fortlessly performs the most diffi
cult floor exercise and places first
with a 9.9.
Midway through the night,
O'Neill easily overcomes the com
petition to win the rings event,
also with a 9.9. Later, he says the
victory is for his brother, who died
of cancer in 1983. Like Fox, who
also won his second consecutive
vaulting title, O'Neill Is only a
sophomore.
The meet saves its best for last,

though. Three very original, al
ways unbelievable high-bar
routines, each also by underclass
men. provide the circus finale.
NCAA all-around champion Tom
Schlesinger, of Nebraska, scores a
9.9, UCLA's David Moriel follows
with a 9.95. The stage is now set
for Houston Baptist's Alphonso
Rodriguez, who averaged over 9.9
on the high bar through the
season, and has scored a perfect
10 more than once.
Rodriquez "disappoints" with a
9.9, but finishes the meet off
right. Whipping around the bar,
Rodriguez accelerates as the
crowd hushes for the final amaze
ment of the 1986-87 college
season. Releasing the bar. he flies
a good 15 feet above the mats, per
forms one, two. three somersaults
before landing, perfectly, without

a shudder, to a standing ovation.
Now comes that unsatisying
feeling. You want to ask them to
do their routines just one more
time. Sure, many will be going
after a spot on the Olympic team,
and you can watch them on TV
then, or May 2, when CBS airs two
of the 10 hours it taped during the
NCAA competition, but it won't be
the same.
If you work on it, maybe you can
actually do these tricks everyday,
like they do. Simply assume the
correct height of around 5-foot-4,
get your body fat down to 4 or 5
percent, then make each muscle
in your body stronger than all
your muscles combined are now.
Then practice these tricks for four
hours a day for 10 to 15 years.
No, it's easier just to watch.
