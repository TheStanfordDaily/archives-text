# NCAA gymnasts: True thrillers
## 
### MARK SMOYER Staff writer 
Last weekend, UCLA's Pauley Pavilion
was the site of the 1987 NCAA Men's Gym
nastics Championships, the top
showcase of U.S. gymnasts outside of the
national championships. Leaving the
arena after Saturday night's closing ses
sion, a sort of all-star meet where the top
eight gymnasts in each of the six events
provide almost three hours of continuous
highlight film, one felt extremely un
satisfied.
Elite gymnasts pack so many super
human feats into just a couple minutes of
performance that you never get a chance
to reflect on the last trick, to run it
through in your mind again, lest you miss
the next, perhaps more dazzling, work of
magic. It Is as though you were reading a
great passage from a great novel as the
words moved across a television screen.
Taking a moment to understand the sen
tence that Just ran off the screen would
mean missing the sentence that followed.
When a gymnast moves quickly through a
final set of movements meant to end his
brief passage with an exclamation point,
it takes your breath away; In absorbing
the mastery of his body's strength and
agility, you have no time nor need to take
care of the most involuntary of actions.
To describe to the average person —
i.e., somebody who has never seen world

class gymnastics in person — what ex
actly these athletes do that is so stunning
is impossible. But let's avoid disclaimers
and just go on to certain moments in the
competition that are most vivid in a clut
tered memory of 10 hours of acrobatics.
Early in Friday night's session — the
competition that determines who ad
vances to the team and individual event
championships — Arizona State's Paul
Llnne begins his high-bar routine. The
defending champion Sun Devils did not
qualify for the team competition this year
but Linne did qualify in his specialty.
As Linne begins swinging around the
bar, all knowing eyes turn from the other
five routines being performed to watch
Llnne. who Is ranked No. 2 nationally on
gymnastics' most exciting apparatus.
Having attained the correct speed to
perform the first of two back-to-back
release moves, Llnne lets go of the bar
and. now about 12 feet off the ground,
does a half-twist and a back flip simulta
neously, then a full-twist. So far all he has
done is release the bar at Just the right
time, done a somersault and one-and-a
half twists in midair, so that he is facing
the bar again, and oriented himself after
all this to catch the bar. Seconds later he
will release again, this time flinging him
self from one side of the bar to the other,
and as some of the crowd anticipates this,
so does Llnne. too soon.
After three weeks of training mainly for

this two minutes of gymnastics that will
lead to perhaps a national title in the high
bar, Linne does not make his catch,
something that may have happened one
other time this season, and falls to the
mat in a haze of chalk. With a gasp from
the audience, Linne recommences his
routine, but he has lost all chance to
make the event finals.
Over to the floor exercise now, where
Paul O'Neill, a still-rings expert from
Houston Baptist, prepares for his
specialty's antithesis. Fortunately for the
barrel-chested O'Neill, the floor exercise
does require a strength move among its
many flips. Lying flat on his stomach,
O'Neill puts his arms by his sides, with
his palms down.
The average competitor, at this point,
would slide his hands toward his head to
start a handstand. Not O'Neill, with his
arms straight, he lifts himself less than
inch off the floor and holds there for over
three seconds. This single feat gets loud
applause from his fellow gymnasts and
the fans alike. Now is a good time to try it
yourself.
It's Saturday night. An hour before the
meet is to start, the best of the best go
through their routines at half-speed with
music from U2's latest release playing
softly in the background, giving you a
