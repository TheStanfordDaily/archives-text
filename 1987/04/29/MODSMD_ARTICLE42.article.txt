Though the Stanford cyllng
team placed second in both races
hosted by UC-Santa Barbara this
past weekend, the team returned
clearly upset by Its performance.
The Cardinal lost little ground
on Its quest for the seasonal
championships but failed to show
its strength in the final two regu
lar season races.
On Saturday, the Cardinal was
caught off guard by a strong
seven-man break with two laps to
go. Even with a strong chase pro

vided by Mike Collins, the team
could do no better than an eighth
place finish by John Coyle and an
11 th place by Tom Moyer.
The B team, continuing a long
string of successes, won its race
with riders Brock La Porte. Hank
Dart and Tim Weiss In second,
third and sixth places.
Laura Rodman placed third
while Lisa-Sue Gitkin finished
12th in a women's race marred by
a crash that felled Stanford riders
Jennifer Hubbert and Michelle
Schwartz.
On Sunday the Cardinal fared
even worse. Collins looked strong

off the front of the pack with 10
laps to go but was later caught
and dropped by a UCSB rider.
The rest of the Stanford riders
made the mistake of tiring them
selves by trying to chase down the
breakaway. Coyle held on for sixth
while Moyer, who led Coyle out for
the sprint, finished 10th.
The B team won again with La
Porte, Dart and Weiss in second,
fifth and sixth. In the women's
race, Hubbert placed second —
only an inch from her first-ever
victory — while Rodman also
finished in the field.
