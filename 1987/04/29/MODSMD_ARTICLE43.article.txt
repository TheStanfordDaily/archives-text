# Card shot putter Purpur: Hard work pays off again
## 
### SCOTT ROTH Staff writer 
To most at Stanford, hard work is no stranger.
Long hours in the library become a way of life. But
for sophomore Patty Purpur, hard work in the
classroom is only half of the game.
Purpur, considered by many to be one of the na
tion's best shot putters and discus throwers, has
learned that success comes to those who want to
work for it. And judging by her results. Purpur's
maxim is right on. Since her freshman year in
high school. Purpur has been at the top of the
standings in virtually every meet she entered. One
would think that she has tremendous talent. Pur
pur herself is not so sure.
"When I first started (throwing), it was the sug
gestion of my cross-country coach, and I was im
mediately better than everybody by a few inches,"
the Grand Forks, N.D., native said. "Although I
was competing for our high school team and went
on to win the state title in ninth grade, 1 didn't see
myself as being very good — especially since I was
from North Dakota."
While talking to Purpur, one quickly gets the
Idea that she is a very modest young woman. She
is. indeed, and that is just what her shot coach.
Dave Wollman wants.
"Patty's been the top thrower for her class in the
nation since about her junior year in high school.
This year could be no exception, so I think she
realizes that she's pretty good," Wollman said.
"But being modest is just fine with me. There
are some people who can do well in the ring and
not brag about it, and there are some who do well
and let the whole world know. Usually though,
people just can talk a lot and not perform. Patty's
personality is perfect. It's the most coachable."
"Patty doesn't have the physical gifts that some
one like (former Stanford star) Pam Dukes has.
Pam's six feet tall, and Patty's not, so she makes
up for it through discipline, hard work and by
having a big heart. Often desire is more important
than talent." Wollman said.
Judging by this season's results, Purpur must

be benefiting from her four to five daily hours of
throwing, weightlifting and running. After just
three meets, she has qualified for the national
championships in both the shot and the discus.
According to Wollman. that puts Patty somewhere
in the top 20 in the country.
Part of her success may stem form the fact that
Purpur has two coaches. In addition to her shot
coach, Purpur is also under the tutelage of Olym
pic discuss thrower John Powell. Both Purpur
and Wollman see this as a tremendous plus.
"They're able to keep my mind straight and give
me different perspectives," Purpur said.
Wollman feels the same way. "She's getting the
best of both worlds. Both of her coaches are very
competent people." he said.
With the 1988 Olympics in Seoul. South Korea,
drawing close, one might think that Purpur is
trying to develop a taste for kim chee, but. for Pur
pur. today is more important.
"My goal is to take one day at a time and throw
as well as I can each time." Purpur said. "If I was
able to go, that would be super, but I just want to
be the best I can. Each year I try to improve. It's
not that important to me to win meets if I don't
improve or win over lesser competition."
It may be possible to credit Dukes with some of
Purpur's success. According to Purpur. her rela
tionship with Dukes, an Ail-American herself,
helps her throwing immensely.
"We keep each other up," Purpur said. "This
sport can be very mental. Pam and I can read each
other's moods and say just the perfect thing to get
us going again. She's great to have around."
Discipline in training has carried over to Pur
pur's classwork. The psychology major says that
the key lies in proper time management.
"I'm no Einstein, so I can't cram the night
before a test. I try to do a little everyday and not fall
behind," Purpur said. "Also Coach (Brooks)
Johnson always stresses academics first. If you
need to be late to a practice or miss it altogether,
he understands. After all, part of my attraction to
Stanford was the fact that it's such a good school.
The beautiful campus didn't hurt, either."
