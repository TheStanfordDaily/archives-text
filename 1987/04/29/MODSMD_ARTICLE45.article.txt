One of the nation's foremost nature photog
raphers. in a slide presentation last night of
his ascent to the top of a mountain peak In the
Patagonia region of Argentina, described how
the slip of a foot had swung him onto the face
of a vertically dropping mountain side — and
how he simply took out his camera when he
realized that the cliffs above would not cut the
rope around his waist.
Recounting incidents like this one. photog
rapher Galen Rowell spoke to a crowd of about
150 people at Branner Hall last night about his
experiences as a photographer, conser
vationist and mountain climber.
Rowell, who in 1984 received the Ansel
Adams Award for his wilderness photography,
recently traveled to Patagonia on an assign
ment for the National Geographic Society.

The assignment took Rowell through the
grassy lowlands of Argentina to the scenic but
dangerous heights of Mount Fltzroy In the
Andes. He said he attempted to capture the
beauty of this vanishing wilderness area.
Provincial governments are destroying Ar
gentine national parks by laying out new
towns, knowing that the national government
Is not strong enough to prevent it. Rowell ex
plained.
In his photography. Rowell said he used a
combination of three special filters. He added
that he always kept his lightweight camera
ready in a chest pouch attached to a band
around his neck.
On his trip to South America, Rowell shot
over 200 rolls of film — more than 7,000
pictures.
Rowell started mountain climbing at the age
of 16 in the Sierra Nevada mountains. At first
he took pictures only to show them to family

and friends. Rowell said, but soon he wanted
to make his pictures of nature look not only as
good as the real thing, but better than the real
thing.
After six years of switching majors at UC-
Berkeley. he sold his small business and
became a professional photographer.
Since 1972. he has made more than 35 jour
neys to places Including Nepal. Pakistan,
Tibet, India, Norway, New Zealand and
Patagonia.
Rowell's slides, presented to music along
with Rowell's own narrative, showed the stun
ning color and variety of South American na
ture: three condors circling a mountain peak
against a deep blue sky, horses running across
the green pampas with the Andes in the back
ground. the sun sparkling over the top of a
snowy ridge, clouded mountain tops Illumi
nated by that distinct "alpine glow" and white
clouds swirling in the "fastest moving sky in
the world."
