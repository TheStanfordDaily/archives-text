# Library headaches not unique to Stanford
## 
### TODD PIERCE Staff writer 
Although last week's announcement that
the Reagan Library would be relocated came
as a surprise to many in the Stanford com
munity. the apparent problems leading up
to the decision are similar to those that
have arisen in choosing sites for libraries of
previous presidents.
Duke's involvement with the proposed
Richard Nixon Library bears resemblance
to Stanford's Reagan Library controversy in
that faculty opposition, raising both practi
cal and political concerns, played a key role
in the university's decision to turn down

the library proposal.
Duke University officials rejected an ini
tial offer for a Richard Nixon Library com
plex in 1982, citing "concern about the
museum and traffic" as its major considera
tions.
"A meeting between the university presi
dent and attorneys for Mr. Nixon apparently
took place during the summer of 1981, so
the normal faculty groups were not there,"
said Susan Mac Donald, executive assistant
to the Duke provost. "The faculty came back
in September and was quite upset. A faculty
committee examined it and voted against
it."
"It was not just a research library but also

a museum with Nixon memorabilia. There
was concern about the museum and traffic"
coming to the campus. "The University
stopped negotiating and the plan basically
died," she said.
Stanford opponents of the Reagan Li
brary reacted along similar lines, stressing
the question of political bias and the threat
of increased traffic as potential problems.
Area residents protested that the library
would congest traffic along Sand Hill Road
and Junipero Serra Boulevard.
The largest presidential libraries all have
ties with or are located near universities:
Boston's John F. Kennedy Library is adja
cent to the University of Massachusetts

campus, Austin's Lyndon B. Johnson Li
brary is at the University of Texas, Ann Ar
bor's Gerald Ford Library is at the Univer
sity of Michican and Atlanta's James E.
Carter Center is at Emory University. They
are all operated by the National Archives.
Traffic problems were also a point of con
tention in the construction of the John F.
Kennedy Library in Massachussetts.
Originally, planners had hoped to build the
library in Cambridge, Mass., but residents
of that already congested city protested.
The library was eventually constructed in
the Boston area on a site more suitable for
heavy traffic.
"There were two sites that were
considered in and around Harvard
Square. The site (In Cambridge)
was chosen around 1965 but we
had to give up on It because people
in Cambridge were worried about
traffic. We had a big dispute with
the people of Cambridge." said
John Stewari. director of the Ken
nedy Library.
In contrast to the problems in
the placement of the Nixon and
Reagan, and to some degree Ken
nedy. libraries, the relationship
between between Emory Univer
sity and the recently completed
Carter Library has been com
paratively harmonious.
The Carter Library is the only
presidential library to contain an
affiliated public affairs center and
its success has been mentioned as
the motivating factor behind the
Reagan Foundation's insistence
on a similar joint library and
policy center in Reagan's name.
According to Emory spokesman
Tom Bertrand, "The complex that
contains the library also contains
the Carter Library of Emory Uni
versity, a public policy center. We
have an extaordinarlly close con
nection . . . one the university is
proud of."

At Emory as well, faculty played
a key role, this time in expressing
a desire to bring the library to
campus. The Carter Library was
opened in October 1986.
"There was a unanimous wish
among the scholarly community
In Atlanta to get the library in At
lanta. The faculty made the first
approach to President Carter
when he was still president,"
Bertrand said.
The site of the library met with
little opposition because the land
was condemned and had lain fal
low for many years before the
Carter center was built. Bertrand
added.
Commenting on the presiden
tial library controversies at Duke
and Stanford, Bertrand said the
"undercurrent of reaction against
the tone of the Nixon administra
tion and against the policies of the
Reagan administration is not
found here and does not compl
icate the location of the library."
The Johnson Library, situated
on the University of Texas campus
in Austin, ran into trouble be
cause it was built during the Viet
nam War in the early '70s. Accord
ing to Harry Middleton, the direc
tor of the library, there was a
"feeling that was not realistic that
the funds used to build the library
might be diverted from teachers'
salaries."
