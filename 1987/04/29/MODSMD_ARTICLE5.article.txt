# Library headaches not unique to Stanford
## 
### TODD PIERCE Staff writer 
Although last week's announcement that
the Reagan Library would be relocated came
as a surprise to many in the Stanford com
munity. the apparent problems leading up
to the decision are similar to those that
have arisen in choosing sites for libraries of
previous presidents.
Duke's involvement with the proposed
Richard Nixon Library bears resemblance
to Stanford's Reagan Library controversy in
that faculty opposition, raising both practi
cal and political concerns, played a key role
in the university's decision to turn down

the library proposal.
Duke University officials rejected an ini
tial offer for a Richard Nixon Library com
plex in 1982, citing "concern about the
museum and traffic" as its major considera
tions.
"A meeting between the university presi
dent and attorneys for Mr. Nixon apparently
took place during the summer of 1981, so
the normal faculty groups were not there,"
said Susan Mac Donald, executive assistant
to the Duke provost. "The faculty came back
in September and was quite upset. A faculty
committee examined it and voted against
it."
"It was not just a research library but also

a museum with Nixon memorabilia. There
was concern about the museum and traffic"
coming to the campus. "The University
stopped negotiating and the plan basically
died," she said.
Stanford opponents of the Reagan Li
brary reacted along similar lines, stressing
the question of political bias and the threat
of increased traffic as potential problems.
Area residents protested that the library
would congest traffic along Sand Hill Road
and Junipero Serra Boulevard.
The largest presidential libraries all have
ties with or are located near universities:
Boston's John F. Kennedy Library is adja
cent to the University of Massachusetts

campus, Austin's Lyndon B. Johnson Li
brary is at the University of Texas, Ann Ar
bor's Gerald Ford Library is at the Univer
sity of Michican and Atlanta's James E.
Carter Center is at Emory University. They
are all operated by the National Archives.
Traffic problems were also a point of con
tention in the construction of the John F.
Kennedy Library in Massachussetts.
Originally, planners had hoped to build the
library in Cambridge, Mass., but residents
of that already congested city protested.
The library was eventually constructed in
the Boston area on a site more suitable for
