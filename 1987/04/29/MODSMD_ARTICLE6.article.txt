# Concert Network to seek new fee assessment terms
## 
### HARU CONNOLLY Staff writer 
The Concert Network Advisory Board has decided
to ask the ASSU Senate to amend the terms of its fee
assessment, approved by students two weeks ago.
According to Deputy Senate Chair Larry Bloch, the
advisory board will ask the senate to transfer a por
tion of the Concert Network's reserves to pay part of
staff adviser Suzanne Becker's salary for the coming
year.
"We felt it was in our best interest to have a staff
adviser," said ASSU Financial Manager Mariah
Dixon, who represents the ASSU on the advisory
board.
"After talking it over, we will go the the senate ap
propriations committee and bring up the idea of
paying for the adviser's salary out of Concert Net
work reserves," Bloch said.
According to Bloch. who also represents the senate
on the advisory board, the appropriations committee
will consider the Concert Network request at its
meeting Thursday night.
"After (the request) is passed out of the appropria
tions committee with a negative or positive recom
mendation, the issue will reach the senate floor
Tuesday night." Dixon said. "The (appropriations
committee) recommendation will have some impact,
but not much, since the issue will be debated again
Tuesday."

"It is difficult to say (whether the senate will ap
prove the Concert Network's request) because it is a
balancing act." Bloch said. "The senate will really
have to take a chance, (since) students pretty
soundly rejected (the fee request to pay the adviser's
salary)."
Dixon said the Concert Network intends to seek
other funding sources to replace the failed fee assess
ment.
"I've talked to the (acting) Dean of Student Affairs
(Norm Robinson) about the University paying for the
rest of the adviser salary, and he was fairly encourag
ing." Dixon added. "But the budgeting process is al
most completed for this coming year and there are
very few loopholes."
According to Dixon, outside funding options for
next year are not "readily" available.
"If the senate doesn't approve (our request to use
our reserves), we'll have to refuse the first fee assess
ment. and the Concert Network would fall back to the
level of this year." Dixon said.
The Concert Network claimed in its 1987 elections
handbook sponsor statement that rejection of the
second part of the fee assessment would leave the or
ganization in a "vulnerable position" because the
Concert Network charter requires the organization
to contribute one-third of the adviser salary.
