U.S. rejects Soviet negotiations
WASHINGTON — The Reagan administration yesterday rejected
a Soviet demand for removal of U.S. nuclear warheads from short
range missiles owned by West Germany. It said the Soviets, by
raising the issue, put a new obstacle in the way of arms control in
Europe.
State Department spokesman Charles Redman said the United
States had never agreed to talk about "third-country systems" as
part of the intermediate-range nuclear forces negotiations, which
both Washington and Moscow have said are on the verge of suc
cess.
In its latest detailed bargaining position, submitted Monday at
the arms control talks in Geneva, the Soviet Union insisted on
removal of the U.S.-owned warheads for 72 aging Pershing 1-A
short-range missiles that were sold by the United States to West
Germany years ago.
Redman said the Geneva talks were aimed at a reduction of
missiles and launchers on both sides. The number of warheads
carried by the missiles, he said, has not directly been a subject of
the negotiations, although the objectives of the talks are usually
expressed in terms of numbers of warheads that each side may
retain.
In its latest proposal, Moscow did not challenge directly the U.S.
refusal to include weapons owned by allied countries in the nego
tiations. But it called for removal of the U.S. warheads, without
which the West German missiles would be useless. Under the nu
clear non-proliferation treaty, which West Germany signed, that
country is prohibited from obtaining nuclear weapons.
Walsh continues Iran inquiry
WASHINGTON — Independent counsel Lawrence Walsh said
yesterday that he had turned up "ample basis" for pushing ahead
with a broad criminal investigation of the Iran-contra affair and
he warned Congress that additional grants of Immunity to key fig
ures could have "a devastating effect on possible prosecutions."
At a news conference at the U.S. Courthouse here, Walsh said
he hopes the Senate and House Iran-contra committees will
change their position and decide against granting immunity to
Lt. Col. Oliver North, the fired National Security Council staff
member who is a key target of all the investigations.
He also refused to rule out the possibility that he might seek
some indictments before congressional hearings begin next week.
Walsh, under congressional criticism for his determination to
pursue the scandal under federal conspiracy law, made most of
his remarks in a 17-page "interim report," the first issued by any
special prosecutor or independent counsel under the Ethics in
Government Act.
Congressional discontent with the scope and pace of Walsh's in
quiry became public last week when Sen. Warren Rudman, R-
N.H., accused Walsh of pursuing a fruitless strategy of "some
grand, wild conspiracy" at "ad nauseam" speed. Rudman sugges
ted that Walsh narrow his inquiry to obstruction of justice, such
as may have occurred when documents were altered and others
shredded in North's office last November.
Falwell remains as PTL chief
FORT MILL, S.C. — The Rev. Jerry Falwell, remaining firmly in
command of the scandal-wracked PTL religious empire, yesterday
cut off the $1.6 million in salaries for the ministry's fallen leaders
Jim and Tammy Bakker, and removed the Rev. Richard Dortch,
Bakker's right-hand man, from all PTL leadership.
At the same time. Falwell acknowledged that PTL money, not
Bakker's personal funds, had been used to hush a sexual tryst
Bakker has admitted.
"I'm convinced that these dark days (for PTL) can be turned
around," Falwell said at a press conference after a tense meeting of
the board that he appointed last month to take charge of PTL.
Falwell said that Bakker. who was not present at yesterday's
four-hour board meeting in the PTL's Heritage Grand Hotel, had
written him last week, threatening "a holy war" if Falwell inter
fered with Bakker's return to power.
Rumors of an imminent Bakker comeback prompted Chat
tanooga. Tenn., television evangelist John Ankerberg to make
public new charges last weekend alleging that Bakker had used
prostitutes and engaged in homosexual acts, and that high-level
PTL leaders had indulged in wife-swapping. Bakker, in a state
ment from his Palm Springs home, later denied those charges.
Canada films called propaganda
WASHINGTON — The Supreme Court yesterday upheld the
power of the federal government to label certain foreign films, in
cluding three from Canada involving nuclear war and acid rain, as
"political propaganda." rejecting claims that such labeling in
fringed on freedom of speech.
The 5-to-3 decision, written by Justice John Paul Stevens, said
the government's registration and labeling program has not lim
ited viewing of foreign films. "Congress' use of the term
propaganda in the 1938 law," Stevens said, "has no pejorative
connotation."
The film ruling was made in a challenge to a section of the
Foreign Agents Registration Act. passed in part as a result of
prewar Nazi propaganda activities.
The Justice Department ignited a furor here and in Canada in
1983 when it ordered that the films, including the Academy
Award-winning documentary "If You Love This Planet," could not
be shown in the United States without a disclaimer saying the
federal government did not approve of them.
California state Sen. Barry Keene. who supported showing the
films, challenged the law. saying their classification as
propaganda had a "chilling effect" on his First Amendment rights,
especially because of the pejorative connotation usually given the
term "propaganda."
S. African ban invalidated
JOHANNESBURG, South Africa — In another politically embar
rassing legal setback for South African President Pleter Botha, a
provincial supreme court justice yesterday declared invalid regula
tions that prohibit many anti-government protests that are con
sidered subversive under the national state of emergency.
Justice R.N. Leon ruled in Durban, which is In Natal province,
that despite the state of emergency, the police do not have the au
thority to define as subversive — and thus illegal — whatever they
choose. He also ruled that they may not prohibit campaigns
seeking the release of political detainees.
The government, which contends that it needs virtual martial
law powers to cope with continuing civil unrest, said that it will
appeal Leon's decision In what could become a landmark case on
freedom of speech in South Africa.
Two other Natal judges, generally regarded as the country's
most liberal, ruled Friday in Pletermaritzburg that key emergency
regulations restricting press reporting of the civil unrest were in
valid. The government will appeal that decision.
With whites-only parliamentary elections only a week away, on
May 6. Botha might issue new regulations, written to comply with
the courts' objections, in order to overcome the humiliation of
being told again by the courts that his government has acted un
lawfully In cracking down on political dissent.
