# COP slates hold forum
## 
### MONIQUE SCHEER Senior staff writer 
In what resembled more of a
forum than a debate, the four
slates running for the Council of
Presidents told students in the
Branner Hall lounge last night
who they are and what they stand
for.
In their introductory statement,
the Philosopher Kings described
themselves as concerned with "the
attitudes, not the issues."
"Some people think we're not
serious," Philosopher King Wayne
Cooperman said. "But you can get
a lot more done if you're laid-back
about it."
The slate told an audience of 50
that they intend to reform parking
damage-repair policies and
work with the University on
making changes in the academic
calendar.
The Plan, minus one member
who is overseas this quarter, said

their "experience and innovation"
will help them in their effort to
develop a student-run bar and
grill called Frog's.
The group would also attempt to
renovate the Boathouse and the
Old Firehouse to create office
space for student groups and start
a dry-cleaning service on campus,
Plan member Ira Williams said.
"The power of the COP lies as a

liaison between students and the
University," Williams said, adding
that the Plan has "not just know
how, but know-who."
The Equalizers described them
selves as "knowledgeable," "exper
ienced" and "dedicated" to the
task. Equalizer Jim Durkin noted
that only one of the slate members


Andy Efron/Dally
Philosopher Kings (Greg Carlson, Darren Schneider, Wayne Cooperman and Steve Baer) sit and reflect
upon their chances for the COP election taking place today and tomorrow. This slate stressed attitude
over issues in last night's forum at Branner Hall. The three other slates, also present last night at Bran
ner, are the Equalizers, the Plan and the Slate of the Union.
