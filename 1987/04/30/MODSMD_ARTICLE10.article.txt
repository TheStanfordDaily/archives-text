# Public policy major restructured
## 
### ELAINE LU 
The University has announced a reshaping
of the program of studies for the undergradu
ate major in public policy.
The new program structure defines 13 areas
of policy concentration, establishes intern
ship-related seminars and expands the senior
seminar to a full-year workshop.
According to Economics Prof. Roger Noll, di
rector of the Public Policy program, the
changes make the major "educationally
stronger and will "better prepare" seniors for
graduate school and careers in government.
In the past, many public policy majors who
were all tooled up" after completing the
rigorous core curriculum felt as if they "had
nowhere to go." Noll said.
Although a desire to increase student enroll
ment did not influence the decision to
restructure the program, Noll said he suspects
that more students will be attracted to the
public policy major now that it is better
defined.
Noll said many students, particularly those
In the social sciences, have not recognized that
the public policy major provides good prepara
tion for graduate school.
The number of seniors who graduate with
degrees in public policy has varied from seven
to 25. This year approximately 12 to 15 stu
dents will graduate with public policy degrees.
The major has a core requirement of three
classes in economics, two in political, science,
two In sociology, three in statistics and one in
philosophy. In addition, students have always

been required to concentrate in a specific
policy area.
The new concentration areas provide list
ings of approved courses in a particular field of
focus. According to Anthropology Prof. Ber
nard Slegel. coordinator of the "Developing
Areas" concentration, a committee of three fac
ulty specializing in a concentration area will
serve as faculty advisers, define relevant topics
and select course curriculum.
Rather than eliminating the opportunity for
students to design their own concentration,
the new structure provides the option of fol
lowing "some guideposts thought up by fac
ulty" to keep each student's curriculum from
being "a random set of courses." according to
Engineering-Economic Systems Prof. James
Sweeny, coordinator of the "Resources and En
vironment" track.
According to Civil Engineering Prof. Leonard
Ortolano, the new system will bring "a lot more
faculty into the advising system." Ortolano Is
coordinator for the urban policy track.
The three members who serve on the area
committees will also serve as faculty advisers
and could potentially provide references for
jobs and graduate schools.
The new structure will also integrate intern
ship experience with a definite curriculum to
resolve past problems of correlating intern
ships with academic credit.
Under the new system, entire courses will be
built around internships whose participants
will include public policy majors. For example,
Public Service Center Director Catherine Mil
ton. Education and Business Prof. Michael

Kirst and Owen House Internship Coordinator
Timothy Stanton are developing new courses
specifically related to internships.
Internships can now be yearlong research
experiences culminating in a major paper or
thesis.
Before a public policy major embarks on an
internship, the student will be given a list of
suggested readings. After completing intern
ships. students can continue independent
study and research in the particular field.
The new yearlong seminar will enable all
public policy majors to "operate as a unit (and)
explore their common interests." Noll said.
Faculty members will supervise discussions,
oral presentations and reports of student in
ternship experiences.
Students have frequently complained that
the required core curriculum offerings have
been dominated by students from other
majors, particularly economics and political
science.
With public policy majors in the minority in
most of the courses, discussions would rarely
focus on policy issues.
According to senior Cecilia Mamby, public
policy is "the greatest major on the planet" and
the department "has never had a director who
has believed so strongly In the program as
Roger Noll."
Mamby said she thinks students will appre
ciate the changes in the program's structure.
"One problem in the past was establishing
what path to take, (but) Noll has mapped (that)
out pretty definitively now."
