## THE
						STANFORD DAILY An Independent Newspaper Vote Equalizers 
### 
In the initial ASSU spring election for
Council of Presidents, The Daily recom
mended a vote for the Equalizers because it
is the slate with the level of energy and the
concrete ideas necessary to improve the
ASSU. The Daily stands by that endorse
ment.
In addition, fairness demands that only
the two legitimate slates in today and tomor
row's election be considered.
The rules for a COP election call for a gen
eral election followed by a runoff between the
two slates with the highest vote totals â€” if no
slate initially wins a majority. Those two
slates are the Equalizers and the Slate of the
Union.
After the first vote count placed them in
third place, less than two percentage points
behind the Plan, the Slate of the Union
posted a *250 bond and was granted a

recount. The ballots were recounted by hand
twice, and both times the Slate of the Union
finished ahead of the Plan. Thus, the Slate of
the Union should undoubtedly be in the
runoff with the Equalizers, the slate that gar
nered the highest vote total.
But wait one minute. Someone changed
the rules in the middle of the game. Citing
the general confusion and unspecified elec
tions violations, and using a ridiculous argu
ment over the validity of hand-counted bal
lots, the ASSU Senate voted for a new elec
tion with all the slates involved.
The new election is completely unfair to
the Slate of the Union and the Equalizers.
But since the senate's dastardly deed cannot
be undone, the student body has only one
recourse: Go out and vote today and tomor
row, and vote for one of the two slates that
belongs in the second election.
