# The
						fairest decision
## 
### 
We are all current ASSU senators who voted
against certifying the Council of Presidents elections
and for a four-way preferential ballot. We are also all
supporters of the Plan. In recent statements to The
Dally, members of the Equalizers and Slate of the
Union have questioned our objectivity (Daily, April
28) and we feel It is appropriate to explain ourselves.

CUEVAS, et al.

First, let us explain the basis for our decision.
There were two questions concerning the COP elec
tion which caused us to refuse to certify the results.
First of all, there was a question as to whether 200
incorrectly marked ballots should be counted or not.
If they were counted. Slate of the Union would be
in the runoff. If they were not counted, the Plan
would be in the runoff. Since we knew the results
either way, we felt it would be difficult for us to make
an objective decision about the 200 ballots.
Second, there were numerous charges of unfair
campaign practices made against two of the COP
slates. All of the charges were dismissed. We agree
with the recent editorial that states charges of elec
tion fraud are serious and should be aired openly
(Dally, April 28). But that's just the problem â€” the
charges were all dismissed so we will never have a
chance to consider their merit, though they may
have affected the results of the election.
In response to those who claim it was Plan sup
porters that made the decision, Elections Commis
sioner Brett Jarvis points out that the Administra
tion and Rules committee (A-R) initiated the idea of
refusing to certify the results while it was still
thought that the Plan had finished second.

Moreover, the A-R does not contain a majority of
Plan supporters and did not recommend a refusal to
certify the election on that basis.
We take our responsibility to be objective senators
very seriously. We would never use our position to try
and push a slate through that we preferred. If the
Plan had finished second, we would have made the
same decision.
We can understand the anger and the suspicion of
the Equalizers and the Slate of the Union, and we
take their charges very seriously. However, we feel
that they should speak with us if they question our
objectivity instead of making accusatory statements
to The Daily.
We would welcome the challenge to explain the
reasons behind our votes and invite all of the COP
slates to discuss the matter with us.
Finally, letting all of the slates stay in the race
shouldn't hurt anybody. Everyone still has a chance
and since it's preferential balloting someone will still
get a majority. Given that there are substantial ques
tions about the handling of the COP elections, we feel
that the only fair decision would be to let all of the
slates into the runoff election.
There are many accusations being thrown out
now, and animosity abounds between the slates and
between this year's senators. We feel that it is under
standable why people would question the decision
but believe that people should talk to each other and
work it out.
Instead, some COP slates feel they must go to the
administration to override the senate's decision.
Let's stop the accusations, talk to each other, try to
work It out and let the students decide which slate
they prefer. This doesn't need to be a mess.
George Cueuas, Don Gagliardl, Ben Garcia, Stacey
Leyton and Vivian Wu are ASSU senators.
