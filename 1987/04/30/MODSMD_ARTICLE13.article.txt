# Policy on Nicaragua is flawed
## 
### 
Oh. those evil Sandinistas. They're at it
again. This week, they've proposed a plan to
grant self-government to the Mosquito Indians
of Nicaragua's Atlantic coast. The policy would
give autonomy to a minority group that has
actively opposed the Nicaraguan government.
Now we wait to see how the Washington
propaganda machine will turn what appears to
be an innovative and enlightened move by the
Ortega government into part of a nefarious
communist plot. Sigh.

The United States is willing to support
totalitarian, repressive regimes in Iran, Chile,
South Korea, etc.; the socialist government of
the little nation of Nicaragua is singled out by
the Reagan administration as evil, threaten
ing. a target for elimination.
The government of Nicaragua is not perfect.
Daniel Ortega is not Ozma of Oz. But let's try to
employ a sense of perspective here. Compared
to other Latin American nations, Nicaragua
does pretty well when it comes to civil liberties.
Amnesty International and other such
agencies have accused the Sandinistas of
violating basic human rights. But these same
groups also point out that the contras. the
American-backed invaders, are guilty of many
more human rights abuses. In a report pub
lished in February, the human rights group
Americas Watch reported that the contras
make systematic use of rape, murder and
mutilation to terrorize, the Nicaraguan
peasants.
In the last two months, two moderate contra
spokesmen. Arturo Cruz and Alfonso Robelo.
have resigned from the leadership of the
United Nicaraguan Opposition, the contra
front. Why? They were upset by the terrorist
tactics used by their own forces.
"Aha," cry my American friends. "What
about the fact that the Sandinistas have shut
down La Prensa. the biggest opposition news
paper? And how do you excuse the persecution
of the Roman Catholic Church?"
Well. I can't excuse those things. Except to
say that Nicaragua is fighting a war against
the richest, most powerful nation in the world.
Human rights are often the first casualties of
war.
Look at the flip side. The Sandinistas shut
down La Prensa but they have not stopped free
speech. They recently started a radio phone-in
show. Contacto 6-20. a program devoted to lis

tener complaints about government policies
and life in Nicaragua. It's the most popular
radio program in the country, with about
600,000 listeners daily.
Ortega announced this spring that the gov
ernment would allow the Catholic Church to
reopen Its own official radio station, closed by
the government in October 1985. Prominent
clerical critics of the government, who had
been exiled, were invited home.
In the past few months. Ortega has tried to
heal the break between the Sandinistas and
the Catholic Church, once allies in the over
throw of the Somoza regime. And there are 14
active opposition parties in Nicaragua. For a
country under siege, that's not bad.
The government of Nicaragua is not demo
cratic. It can be repressive. It is flawed. But
many of its imperfections have been caused,
indirectly, by the policies of the United States.
The U.S. government has a terrible tendency
to push away possible moderate allies and turn
them into enemy states. Before they turned to
the Soviet Union. Ho Chi Minh. Mao Tse Tung
and Fidel Castro all looked to America for aid.
The United States could have had strong
friends in Vietnam, China and Cuba. Instead,
the United States blackballed these new na
tions, did its best to thwart them and forced
them into the Soviet camp.
When President Reagan came to power he
cut off grain sales to Nicaragua. The Soviets
immediately shipped in wheat. The Reagan
government blew up Nicaraguan oil tanks. The
Soviets sent replacement fuel and built new
fuel storage tanks. In May of 1985. Washing
ton put an embargo on Nicaragua's main ex
ports — bananas, coffee and seafood — crip
pling the country's economy. Is it any wonder
the Sandinistas looked elsewhere for support?
Nicaragua has tried to work with the United
States. In 1984. the Sandinistas accepted a
treaty drafted by the Contadora Group
(Columbia. Mexico. Panama and Venezuela)
and agreed to expel Soviet and Cuban advisers,
stop imports of Soviet weapons, end support
for leftist groups in El Salvador and reduce the
size of its army. In exchange, the treaty pro
posed that Washington stop supporting the
contras.
The Contadora treaty is still on the table.
The United States has refused to sign it — or
indeed, to give it serious consideration.
Instead, it is building an extensive military
complex Just across the border in Honduras.
The United States now has six airbases In the
area — including one enormous *19 million
airfield — designed to accommodate the larg
est military transport planes. The Pentagon is
using Honduras for a military exercise, named
"Big Pine." involving more than 6,000 Ameri
can troops. American military commanders

The United States
must give up the
Monroe Doctrine.

have gone on record saying that they are ready
to invade Nicaragua with 100,000 American
troops should the need arise.
The history of post-World War II Europe
clearly shows that carrots are more effective
than sticks in the fight against communism.
The Marshall Plan, a program of aid for na
tions facing the "temptation" of Soviet spon
sorship, made Western Europe productive and
free.
It was the brainchild of George Kennan. the
U.S. ambassador to Moscow and author of the
doctrine of "containment." and Gen. George
Marshall, the former U.S. Army chief of staff.
Kennan and Marshall realized that the way to
keep struggling young nations free was to help
them financially on the condition that they
maintain democratic governments.
The United States must give up the Monroe
Doctrine. It is not a valid policy in the 20th
century. The Americas are now made up of in
dependent nations, not European colonies.
The United States has no right to use force
to interfere with the popularly supported gov
ernments of autonomous nations. Such ac
tions are immoral and self-defeating. It should
instead use the philosophy of Marshall and
Kennan to win friends and influence people.
If Reagan Is really interested in the welfare of
Nicaraguans. he should encourage their gov
ernment to make human rights reforms. He
should not paint the Sandinistas into a cor
ner, into the politics of desperation.
And if we, as Stanford students, care about
the future of Nicaragua and the future of the
United States, we should be bloody angry that
Stanford faculty members — people supported
by our tuition dollars — have been implicated
in the ridiculous plot to sell arms to Iran in or
der to fund the contras.
You see. this column is not simply me ran
ting and raving about events happening
thousands of miles away. It's also me being
embarrassed and outraged that people associ
ated with the University are involved in the
misguided, murderous attempt to destroy the
government of a sovereign nation.
No matter how messed up the Sandinlsta
regime might be. the United States has no
excuse for its treachery and bad manners.

cut off grain sales to Nicaragua. The Soviets
immediately shipped in wheat. The Reagan
government blew up Nicaraguan oil tanks. The

fuel storage tanks. In May of 1985. Washing

ports — bananas, coffee and seafood — crip

the Sandinistas looked elsewhere for support?
Nicaragua has tried to work with the United
States. In 1984. the Sandinistas accepted a
treaty drafted by the Contadora Group
(Columbia. Mexico. Panama and Venezuela)
and agreed to expel Soviet and Cuban advisers,
stop imports of Soviet weapons, end support
for leftist groups in El Salvador and reduce the
size of its army. In exchange, the treaty pro
posed that Washington stop supporting the
contras.
The Contadora treaty is still on the table.
The United States has refused to sign it — or
indeed, to give it serious consideration.
Instead, it is building an extensive military
complex Just across the border in Honduras.
The United States now has six airbases In the
area — including one enormous *19 million
airfield — designed to accommodate the larg

using Honduras for a military exercise, named
"Big Pine." involving more than 6,000 Ameri
can troops. American military commanders

to invade Nicaragua with 100,000 American
troops should the need arise.
The history of post-World War II Europe
clearly shows that carrots are more effective
than sticks in the fight against communism.
The Marshall Plan, a program of aid for na

It was the brainchild of George Kennan. the
U.S. ambassador to Moscow and author of the
doctrine of "containment." and Gen. George
Marshall, the former U.S. Army chief of staff.
Kennan and Marshall realized that the way to
keep struggling young nations free was to help
them financially on the condition that they
maintain democratic governments.
The United States must give up the Monroe
Doctrine. It is not a valid policy in the 20th
century. The Americas are now made up of in

The United States has no right to use force

instead use the philosophy of Marshall and
Kennan to win friends and influence people.
If Reagan Is really interested in the welfare of

should not paint the Sandinistas into a cor

And if we, as Stanford students, care about
the future of Nicaragua and the future of the

Oh. those evil Sandinistas. They're at it
again. This week, they've proposed a plan to
grant self-government to the Mosquito Indians
of Nicaragua's Atlantic coast. The policy would
give autonomy to a minority group that has
actively opposed the Nicaraguan government.
Now we wait to see how the Washington
propaganda machine will turn what appears to
be an innovative and enlightened move by the
Ortega government into part of a nefarious
communist plot. Sigh.

The United States is willing to support
totalitarian, repressive regimes in Iran, Chile,
South Korea, etc.; the socialist government of
the little nation of Nicaragua is singled out by
the Reagan administration as evil, threaten
ing. a target for elimination.
The government of Nicaragua is not perfect.
Daniel Ortega is not Ozma of Oz. But let's try to
employ a sense of perspective here. Compared
to other Latin American nations, Nicaragua
does pretty well when it comes to civil liberties.
Amnesty International and other such
agencies have accused the Sandinistas of
violating basic human rights. But these same
groups also point out that the contras. the
American-backed invaders, are guilty of many
more human rights abuses. In a report pub
lished in February, the human rights group
Americas Watch reported that the contras
make systematic use of rape, murder and
mutilation to terrorize, the Nicaraguan
peasants.
In the last two months, two moderate contra
spokesmen. Arturo Cruz and Alfonso Robelo.
have resigned from the leadership of the
United Nicaraguan Opposition, the contra
front. Why? They were upset by the terrorist
tactics used by their own forces.
"Aha," cry my American friends. "What
about the fact that the Sandinistas have shut
down La Prensa. the biggest opposition news
paper? And how do you excuse the persecution
of the Roman Catholic Church?"
Well. I can't excuse those things. Except to
say that Nicaragua is fighting a war against
the richest, most powerful nation in the world.
Human rights are often the first casualties of
war.
Look at the flip side. The Sandinistas shut
down La Prensa but they have not stopped free
speech. They recently started a radio phone-in
show. Contacto 6-20. a program devoted to lis

tener complaints about government policies
and life in Nicaragua. It's the most popular
radio program in the country, with about
600,000 listeners daily.
Ortega announced this spring that the gov
ernment would allow the Catholic Church to
reopen Its own official radio station, closed by
the government in October 1985. Prominent
clerical critics of the government, who had
been exiled, were invited home.
In the past few months. Ortega has tried to
heal the break between the Sandinistas and
the Catholic Church, once allies in the over
throw of the Somoza regime. And there are 14
active opposition parties in Nicaragua. For a
country under siege, that's not bad.
The government of Nicaragua is not demo
cratic. It can be repressive. It is flawed. But
many of its imperfections have been caused,
indirectly, by the policies of the United States.
The U.S. government has a terrible tendency
to push away possible moderate allies and turn
them into enemy states. Before they turned to
the Soviet Union. Ho Chi Minh. Mao Tse Tung
and Fidel Castro all looked to America for aid.
The United States could have had strong
friends in Vietnam, China and Cuba. Instead,
the United States blackballed these new na
tions, did its best to thwart them and forced
them into the Soviet camp.
