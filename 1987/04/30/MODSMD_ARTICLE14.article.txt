# Just partisan politics

### 
Our campus government nurses a festering illu
sion of democracy. The students voted in the recent
ASSU election, and the ASSU Senate overturned the
results. By calling for a new Council of Presidents
election, they have provided their favorite slate an
other shot at the win.

MILLER, et al.

The computer-tabulated results placed the
Equalizers first in the race for the COP. The Plan and
the Slate of the Union were placed second and third,
respectively. The difference between them was 53
votes.
The Slate of the Union wisely requested a hand
recount, which moved them into second, ahead of
the Plan by 65 votes. This would not be much of an
issue, but the ASSU bylaws mandate that the top two
slates in this COP election participate in a runoff
election. With the recounted votes, the Slate of the
Union — not the Plan — would have contested the
Equalizers in the COP runoff.
But the senate voted not to certify this COP elec
tion and to hold a whole new election involving all
four slates. This time, people will vote for a COP slate
through the preferential system, whereby voters
rank their choices one, two. three and four.
The two arguments presented against certification
were spurious. The first claim was that the different
methods of counting — by computer and by hand —
resulted in different interpretations for what con
stituted a valid vote. The computer Scantron ma
chine did not accept ballots marked lightly, illegibly
or in ink, whereas the human counters could recog
nize the original intention.
If we accept this argument — and a valid concern it
is — the proper procedure should be to recount all
the COP ballots, following an accepted standard. Be
cause the student body has already cast their ballots,
the senate should respect the collective will already
put forth.

The second argument is petty in nature. It was
brought up that all COP slates were involved in cam
paign irregularities, thereby effectively disqualifying
all slates and requiring that a new election be held.
The cited irregularities included the placement of
fliers on top of other fliers and the photographing of
each other in public, and were originally brought up
by the COP slates in an attempt to disqualify each
other.
These allegations did not have any bearing on the
results of the election. The ASSU Hearings Commit
tee, an independent board in charge of recommend
ing punishments, dismissed all charges as inconse
quential. The senate validated the election on April
21, thereby lending their support to the Hearings
Committee. It is hypocritical for the ASSU to sud
denly charge that the COP election was run without
integrity.
The decision to hold a new election was forwarded
as the fairest resolution to the above imagined prob
lems. In truth, it will render the election more unfair.
Because not as many issues are at stake, fewer
people will vote, which will narrow the margin. The
preferential voting system will further divide up the
already small number of voters.
What this means is that the election will be a toss
up. The Philosopher Kings, who took 15 percent of
the first vote, could well end up the winners. Such a
scenario does not preserve the will of the original
voters.
The only plausible explanation for this insistence
on new elections is partisan politics. The Plan was
endorsed by the People's Platform Committee, and
its friends in the senate want to see the slate given a
second chance. \
To have another election is double jeopardy for the
Equalizers and the Slate of the Union. We call for cer
tification of the election results as they were
originally presented, allowing just a runoff election
between the Equalizers and the Slate of the Union.
