Thanks to the
fraternities
The movie "Animal House"
portrays college fraternities un
fairly and inaccurately. We at the
City of Palo Alto Recreation De
partment would like to help cor
rect this image.
On April 18, we organized the
Annual Easter Egg Hunt for
nearly 200 children. Twenty-eight
members of Kappa Sigma and Phi
Delta Theta fraternities volun
teered their services at this city

sponsored event to make sure it
was a huge success for everyone
involved.
Fraternity members worked
hard and demonstrated leader
ship qualities to help our five
staff members put on a high
quality event for more than 1,000
parents and children.
The fraternities are a valuable
resource to our community and
we are very fortunate to have
their members interact with the
recreation department to put on
special events for the community.
