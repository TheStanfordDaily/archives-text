## Instead of jail: Vision Quest 
### DENISE CLARK 
Michael has been arrested 15
times. He's been assigned to three
different foster homes and a 24-
hour school. He is allowed one
more chance before he is placed
behind bars. The judge sentences
him to a year with Vision Quest.
Vision Quest is an alternative to
juvenile incarceration. It is a na
tional child-care organization that
offers a challenging outdoor ex
perience to troubled youths aged
13 to 18. Program recruiters will
be on campus today seeking stu
dents who are interested in help
ing these kids to re-enter their
own homes and communities.
In the first stage of the program,
the juveniles spend three months
in a wilderness camp learning out
door skills and getting in shape.
The boot-camp atmosphere is
rigorous and allows a positive out
let for the youths' high energy
level.
"The kids have all been sitting
around the neighborhood, on
street corners, and are in very bad
shape physically," according to
Anne Marks, Vision Quest's head
recruiter.
In addition to the daily exercises
and wilderness classes, the camps
allow the juveniles to actively par
ticipate in a community, a tepee
village based on the Plains Indian
tradition.
The next stage of the program is
the yearlong journey on the wagon
train. The tightly structured trip
offers morning classes, daily
chores such as caring for the

mules and horses and a 15- to 20-
mile trek. The safe limits of the
wagon train and the ratio of one
staff member for every three
youths creates a stable environ
ment.
"We have a staff-secure facility
as opposed to a building-secure
facility. We make the environment
safe for kids, because kids strike
out when they're scared. When a
staff person sleeps in the tepee
with you and rides down the road
with you, you begin to trust
them. . . . You build bonds," ex
plains Regina Murphy-Darling, a
spokesperson for Vision Quest.
This personal interaction has
been the goal of Vision Quest since
the program was created in 1973.
The founder. Bob Burton, was
frustrated with the correctional
institutions provided for ju
veniles. He realized that the large
state-run institutions are self
defeating.
These institutions do not pro
vide positive role models for the
juveniles, according to Burton.
The youths form poor self images
and have a greater chance to
repeat criminal activity, he said.
The staff is the crucial element
in the program. Murphy-Darling
says, "We believe in parenting the
kids in a place where there are no
barriers or walls."
The 650 employees of Vision-
Quest are committed to helping
troubled youth. The average age of
the staff is 24, and most are col
lege graduates. They go through
an extensive training program in
which they learn to intervene im

mediately when a youth begins to
push the limits or exhibit
problematic behavior. According
to the program's literature,
'Mutual respect between staff and
juveniles takes the 'game playing'
out of treatment."
Every Vision Quest youth makes
a commitment that he or she
must keep throughout the pro
gram. The juvenile must complete
at least two wilderness programs
and must participate in Vision-
Quest for at least one year. In ad
dition, the youth must abstain
from drugs, sex and alcohol while
in the program. He or she must
not run away from the issues
which arise within the juvenile's
Vision Quest family.
"The program guarantees suc
cess," Marks says. For the first
time, these kids are fulfilling a
commitment.
The kids learn cooperation and
control, and when they return to
their natural families and to
school, Marks says, "they won't be
at the bottom of the barrel."
