# Election controversial
## 
### MONIQUE SCHEER Senior staff writer 
The long, complicated affair of
this year's election for the ASSU
Council of Presidents has
generated a great deal of confu
sion and controversy.
Many of the complications stem
from the fact that there were four
slates running for the office,
which virtually precluded any

clear majority from emerging after
the first ballot. From the begin
ning, those involved with the elec
tion expected a runoff between
two slates.
But no one anticipated the close
race for second place that oc
curred between the Plan and the
Slate of the Union. Both slates
finished well behind the Equal
izers in the first election, but the
Plan edged the Slate of the Union
by 53 votes.
Nor did anyone anticipate the
cliiliculties with the Scantron ma
chine used to count the ballots.
Official results were delayed for
several days, and after the Slate of
ihe Union demanded a recount,
the Elections Commission discov
ered that the machine had also
failed to count the votes on several
improperly marked ballots.
During the recount," which was
done by hand, the commission in
eluded those ballots that were
ignored by the machine because of
improper marking.
"It was still clearly a vote for (a
particular slate), but the machine
didn't read it." Elections Commis
sioner Brett Jarvis said.
The Slate of the Union outdis
tanced the Plan by 65 votes in the
recount, a turnaround of 118
votes, some of which had not been
counted by the machine the first
time.

During the course of the cam
paign and election, the four slates
had filed numerous complaints
against each other alleging cam
paign misconduct. ASSU bylaws
require these allegations be heard
after the election by Hearings Offi
cer Susan Starritt and her com
mittee.
According to Starritt. "many of
the charges were retaliatory."
She said slates zealously filed
charges against their competitors,
but "were surprised when similar
charges were brought against
them."
Most of the more substantial
charges heard by the committee
last Friday Involved the Equalizers
and the Plan, Starritt said. The al
legations included reports of
tearing down posters and placing
signs in restricted areas.
Because the Hearings Commit
tee could neither attribute alleged
violations to anyone in particular,
nor ascertain that they were mali
ciously perpetrated, the charges
were dismissed, Starritt said.
The dismissal of the charges
and the question of whether bal
lots that were not read by the ma

chine would be considered valid
led the Administration and Rules
Committee to recommend to the
full senate on Monday that an en
tirely new election for the COP be
held this week.
The senate quickly certified all
of the election results except the
COP tallies and voted to hold new
elections. As a result, all of the bal
loting. including the results of the
recount, and the charges of cam
paign misconduct in the first elec
tion will be completely disregarded
by the Elections Commission and
the senate.
The Equalizers and the Slate of
the Union led failed efforts to
block this action in the senate. Ac

cording to Equalizer Leonard Ad
ler. they sought help from Univer
sity officials, including the Om
budsperson, and attempted to call
a special meeting of the senate to
reverse its decision and reinstate
the runoff between the Equalizers
and the Slate of the Union.
Today the entire process begins
anew. Students will vote, hope
fully for the last time, on the COP
for next year. A preferential voting
system will be used to preclude a
runoff and the results will be
counted by hand.
New campaign rules are in ef
fect. and one alleged violation has
already been filed with the
Hearings Officers. Cate said.
