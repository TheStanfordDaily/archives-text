# Dancing, playing in the City
## 
### MICHAEL GOFF 
It could only happen in The
City. New York is too big. Los
Angeles is too exclusive. Wash
ington D.C. is too stuffy.
The 1987 Black and White
Ball to benefit the San Francisco
Symphony happens tomorrow
night, and if you have the cash
you should not miss it.
San Francisco shows its true
colors during the biannual
Black and White. Young, old.
punkers, society matrons and
every shade of gray in between
turn out to experience the ball's
subtitle, "I could have danced all
night." A "special" price of $ 100
for those 21 to 30 brings out the
Bay Area young set to dance to
waltzes, big band, jazz and
rock'n'roll music at the seven
public buildings around City
Hall and the Civic Center. Ticket
price includes donated wine and
food.
The range of music spans all
listening tastes. The San Fran
cisco Symphony, Tito Puente,
New Riders of the Purple Sage,
Freaky Executives, and the
Count Basie and Guy Lombardo
Orchestras will all perform at
different points in the night.
Over 30 orchestras and bands
are definitely scheduled, as are a
number of special guest appear
ances which include the likes of
David Crosby and Pete Sears. In
addition, a Stanford favorite,
the Zazu Pitts Memorial Or
chestra. is scheduled to "jam"
from 1:15 to 2:45 a.m. Rumor
has it that Bob Weir of the
Grateful Dead will be joining
them for at least part of this
time. A full listing of bands and
scheduled times was published
in last Sunday's Chronicle and
will be available at the ball.
Charlotte Mailliard, chairman
of the ball and San Francisco's
reigning queen of party plan
ning, says the thing she likes
best about the ball is that the
age groups do not stay seg

regated according to the types of
music they are used to. Young
people waltz and swing, and
most older couples take a look, if
not a try, at moving to the
"younger" sounds in the Civic
Center.
"I love seeing people arm-in
arm, dancing in the hallways of
all the buildings," Mailliard
said. Her words of advice for
Stanford students attending the
ball were to "bring your dancing
shoes and take your vitamins."
The last band is scheduled to
stop playing in the Civic Center
at 4 a.m.
The stages and the hallways
are not the only places where
things happen. The streets
around the ball's venues are a
party in themselves. Spotlights
cross the sky, black and white
Shetland ponies pull carriages
around the square, and perfor
mances happen outside all
night. One of the planned events
is an appearance by the Stan
ford Band and the Dollies. A few
years ago they sat in the Opera
House after their performance

and played "battle of the bands"
with a big band orchestra. Once
the conductor figured out what
was going on, he played along
and the crowd loved it, Mailliard
said. "1 love the Stanford Band,"
she added.
Since the inception of the "21-
30 club" by Mailliard to broaden
the appeal of the event, more
Stanford students have taken
part.
Senior Diana Zock, who atten
ded the last ball two years ago,
says, "Yes. I would recommend
this to all my friends." Despite
the fact that Stanford students
have taken to the stage with
Zazu Pitts and have tried to
crash the gates in the past, Mail
liard said, "All of you are
invited."
The price of a ticket is steep,
but the evening is an experience
not to be missed. It's a unique
chance to see San Franciscans
doing what they do best â€”
playing.
Tickets are still available at
BASS.
