## Infinite Q: Engineers turn to jazz fusion 
### MORTY POSNER Editorial staff 
One day. a guy who was In your fraternity at Stan
ford years ago calls you up and asks if you'd like to
Join a band he's forming. After work you leave your
day job at Hewlett-Packard and meet a group of
musicians in a garage in San Jose. Strangely
enough, it turns out that not only do they share your
taste in music, they're all Silicon Valley engineers —
just like you.
Such was the beginning of the jazz fusion group
Infinite Q, which makes a repeat performance at the
Coffee House tonight as part of the Coffee House's
Thursday night jazz series.
"Sometimes we have to shake the stigma of being
engineers," said Infinite Q saxophone player Greg
Lowitz, although he doesn't consider his technical
background an Impediment to playing good jazz. In
fact, he's surprised that more engineers aren't
musicians.
"A lot of engineers are interested in stereo systems
and CD players and their technology. That's what
gets them Interested in music," Lowitz noted.
And it's their engineering backgrounds that
brought these musicians together.
"There's a larger and larger following of this kind of
music," said Lowitz who — with Stanford alum
Derek Granath on bass, Raleigh Estrada on guitar.
Rich McCauley on keyboards and Dave Hawthorne
on drums — plays a collection of songs that form "a
bridge between the jazz era and the rock era."
While critics cringe, jazz fusion tends to take more
liberties with jazz chord structures and inversions,
occasionally using synthesizers and computers.
Lowitz said that when people his age think about
going to a club to hear some jazz, many expect to
hear Weather Report. Spyro Gyra or David Sanborn.
Infinite Q caters to this audience, while frequently

offering jazz standards which they play with equal
alacrity.
Lowitz pointed out that when he attended Stan
ford there were few jazz concerts and even fewer jazz
classes offered by the Music Department. Today,
Stanford is cultivating a taste for jazz, which Lowitz
credits to the addition of Stan Getz and the Commit
tee for Jazz on campus.
Coffee House manager Jeff Lougee concurs that
more people on campus are interested in jazz than
ever before. In addition to the Thursday night jazz

series, which is more than a year old, Lougee has
booked the Stanford Jazz Summer Workshops into
his corner of Tresidder Union.
"Jazz really just needed a home at Stanford and
the Coffee House is a really good room to do it,"
Lougee observed.
Infinite Q has had pretty steady work (at least two
shows a month, Lowitz said), and has opened for
such well-known fusion artists as Billy Cobham,
Larry Carlton and Joe Sample. In order to enhance
its versatility, however, the band is considering add
ing a vocalist.

"We're starting to run out of clubs that want
instrumental-only bands," Lowitz said, observing
that many people won't dance to songs without
words. As a practical matter, he said, people don't
buy many drinks if they don't stay to dance.
The addition of a vocalist would enable Infinite Q
to integrate some top-40 songs along the lines of
music heard on KBLX 102.9 FM into its repertoire,
Lowitz said.
But the motive is not money.
"We're not trying to make a fortune in this busi
ness, thank goodness," said Lowitz. Luckily, he and
his fellow engineers are making Silicon Valley
salaries that can support their habit, which he said
was "probably a losing proposition" in itself. But a
record wouldn't be out of the question if they can
find some financial backing.
"I feel that we're getting very close to having
enough material for an album," which Lowitz called
a repertoire of seven to 10 original songs. However,
he warned, "to put together a decent album costs
*10,000 to $15,000 — and that's low-budget."
The name Infinite Q was actually chosen by the
group's co-workers. A list of possible names was circ
ulated to the various high-tech firms in which the
five work and "Infinite Q" came up the obvious win
ner among the engineering crowd.
"It's a term in electrical engineering that means
resonance," explained Lowitz. Suppose your car was
out of alignment and at a certain speed it started to
shake and resonate. If your car did this on its own all
the time without you stepping on the gas, you would
have infinite Q — "a lot of energy in a concentrated
place."
Lowitz and friends provide the concentrated en
ergy. and it's a lot more enjoyable than a wheel align
ment.
Infinite Q plays at the Coffee House today from 9 to
11 p.m.

The audience for jazz at Stanford is expanding, and the fusion group Infinite 9 hopes to satisfy that audi
ence tonight at the Coffee House. The group is made up of Silicon Valley engineers; hence the group's
name, an engineering term meaning "resonance."
