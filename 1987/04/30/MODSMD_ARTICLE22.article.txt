Vladimir Ashkenazy
Tchaikovsky Symphony No. 6
(London 411 615-2)
Tchaikovsky's most popular and most
recorded symphony, the No. 6 ("Path
etique"), was the last thing he wrote, and
its gloomy, anguished ending has sup
ported the rumors that his death, less
than two weeks after the premiere, was a
suicide. With arguments and evidence on
both sides, we will probably never know
for sure, but we do know that
Tchaikovsky regarded it as "quite the best
— and especially the most sincere — of my
works." He also said that it was a program
symphony (one that tells a story), but that
the story "should remain an enigma to
everyone," as it has for almost 100 years.
It is recorded often, because of its mys
tique and popularity, and because it of
fers many challenges to both the conduc
tor and the recording engineer. The third
movement is perhaps the most spirited in
any symphony and the sudden loud at

tacks in both the first and last move
ments are a challenge to any stereo sys
tem.
We compared the Ashkenazy recording
to the Giulini (DG 400 029-2) and the
most recent Karajan version (DG 415 095-
2). The Giulini is very lyrical but almost
not serious enough? while the Karajan is
overly dramatic with the 5/4 movement so
slow as to be heavy. Both of these record
ings are marred by inconsistent sound
quality and balance problems, the brass
being in another room when you want
them up front and then totally alone and
too bright when a homogenous sound is
required.
The Ashkenazy version suffers from
none of these problems. The sound of
Kingsway Hall gives this recording a very
warm sound that still has plenty of clarity
and edge. For example, the low bassoon
parts in the last movement are more clean
and realistic than any we have ever heard
before. Ashkenazy's reading is emotional
and dramatic and the punctuated chords
are brilliant without being harsh. It is a
performance that is not likely to be bet
tered soon, but if you simply must have
the latest thing, there are two new record
ings from Chandos (Janson with the Oslo
PO) and Telarc (Dohnanyi in Cleveland).
They are just coming out, and the Jan
sons series for Chandos has been really
good so far. All of these recordings feature
only the Symphony 6: about 47 minutes
of music.
Lorin Maazel
Hector Berlioz — "Harold in Italy"
(Deutsch Grammoph 415 109-2)
"Harold in Italy" is both Hector Berlioz's
second symphony and his only concerto.
It is his own reading of Byron's "Childe
Harold," with himself (thinly disguised as
viola soloist) as the protagonist. The
movements are in the order of a classical
symphony but the comparison ends
there. The solo is not quite prominent

enough to call it a concerto either. (It is
said that Paganini refused to play it be
cause it did not feature him enough.
Upon hearing the work, however,
Paganini declared Berlioz "the heir of Bee
thoven.") It is almost impossible to believe
that this music was composed in 1834; it
sounds at least as late as Tchaikovsky.

Berlioz was an immensely gifted, im
aginative and unorthodox composer who
— except for a few flute lessons — never
even learned to play an instrument. He
was a unique composer way ahead of his
time and is often neglected merely be
cause he is difficult to place.
There have only been two new record
ings of "Harold" made in the last 12 years
and this 1985 version for DG with
Wolfram Christ as the viola soloist is the
easy winner. It is a well-paced and elegant
performance, and also very exciting: The

beginning of the "Orgy of Brigands" will
knock you back a few feet.
"The Roman Carnival Overture," which
ends the disc, is more than just filler. It is
a dazzling performance by Lorin Maazel
and the Philharmonic. The entire disc is
very well-recorded and if you are inter
ested in discovering more Romantic sym
phonies, "Harold" is a great place to start.
"Portraits"
(New Albion Catalogue NA 009-CD)
New Albion is a company to be ap
plauded for its efforts to put new music
on CD. They have concentrated primarily
on composers with excellent minimalist
tendencies, and "Portraits" contains se
lections by six different composers from
as many different albums. Samplers are
like going out for Chinese food with a
crowd — it's OK if you are not sure what
you like but want to try everything. In this
case, getting a little taste first is a very
good idea. Although you get a limited
sample of each composer, you will get a
good feel for what is now called mini
malism (and sometimes "New Age" music
when it is closer to pop or jazz, as with
Windham Hill or Mannheim Steamroller).
It is music that unfolds slowly, using
small repeated units and introducing new
elements one at a time.
There are several different types of
people who might enjoy this music. If you
like the other types of background music
mentioned above, you may find this even
better. If you decide to listen closely, many
of the pieces are very interesting. The
most percussive and therefore possibly
annoying if you are trying to sleep is Paul
Dresher's "Channels Passing." You will
either find the slowly introduced har
monic and rhythmic changes interesting
or you may get a headache.
The last three pieces were the most in
teresting to us. "Rainbows, Part One" by
Stephen Scott is from his album "New
Music for Bowed Piano." Ten players

stand around the piano and bow the
strings, producing very unusual effects.
"O-KE-WA" by Daniel Lentz is a beautiful
piece for 12 voices and bells which is
marred only by the unnecessary disco-like
bass drum on every beat. John Adams,
former composer-in-residence with the
San Francisco Symphony, closes this disc
with a section of his "Light Over Water,"
which as the liner notes put it is very
"translucent and meditative." Although
neither of us is a big fan of minimalism,
this is a good introduction to it that may
win you over. Some people take this
music very seriously and others not at all;
with this disc you can decide for yourself.
There are 50 minutes of new and unusual
sounds.
Robert Schumann
Bernard Haitnik
"The Four Symphonies"
Obtaining a satisfactory set of complete
symphonies by most composers is a diffi
cult and often unnecessary undertaking,
but with Schumann it is easy and worth
doing. Schumann is known primarily for
his piano music, songs and his attempt to
commit suicide by throwing himself into
the Rhine in 1852, but he also wrote four
symphonies that are all still in the reper
toire. The same can be said for very few
composers.
Although there are other recordings of
the individual symphonies worth having
(most notably Furtwangler's classic ver
sion of the fourth in mono but now
reissued on CD), Bernard Haitink con
ducts very sensible and beautiful read
ings of all four symphonies. The sound is
good throughout, although a little less
ambiance and a little more clarity might
have suited Schumann's thick textures a
little better. The best part is that you get
130 minutes of great music on two CDs.
This set also appears on three records
(with two additional short overtures),
making the CDs an outstanding buy.
