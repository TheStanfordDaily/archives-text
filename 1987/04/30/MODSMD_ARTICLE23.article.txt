Rachell Ingalls
Mrs. Caliban
Cambridge: Harvard Common Press, 1983
"Mrs. Caliban" isn't a new book; in fact it
was written four years ago by the American au
thor Rachel Ingalls. But the novel, which was
first published in England and then finally ac
cepted by the Harvard Press, was recently cited
by the British Book Council as one of the 20
greatest American novels written since World
War 11. The resulting uproar — obscure books
from small presses are not usually given such
recognition — has caused "Mrs. Caliban" to be
reprinted, rediscovered and thoroughly re
reviewed by American readers and critics.
Once you've read Ingalls' novel, you'll under
stand what the fuss is about. The tale of a sub
urban housewife who falls in love with an
eight-foot-tall lizard named Larry, the book
isn't representative of what's been going on in
American fiction since the 50's, rather, it's a
welcome exception. Simple, direct and not self
conscious. "Mrs. Caliban" is the most matter
of-fact book about interaquatic romance you're
likely to come across.
The heroine of the novel. Dorothy Caliban, is
married to a man who has long ago lost inter
est In marriage. Fred is the type of man who
takes the paper from Dorothy before she
finishes reading It, because it's his paper and
he's on his way to work in the morning. The
book's opening is reminiscent of the dark sub
urban tales of John Cheever or Evan S. Con
nell; but we are quickly transported beyond
even the fantastic realm of Cheever's "The
Enormous Radio."
Like Irene Westcott in Cheever's story,
Dorothy has begun to hear voices on the radio;
however, these speak directly to Dorothy, tel
ling her that "everything will be OK." As she's
In the kitchen cooking one evening, she ner
vously turns on her radio and hears a very real
news broadcast: "Aquarius the Monsterman"

has escaped from the local Oceanographic Re
search Center. This doesn't concern her too
much; she wonders if it's another audio hal
lucination, then dismisses it as mere fact.
Later that evening, as Dorothy toasts cheese,
Aquarius "shoulders his way into the house."
Dorothy's initial reaction Is predictable as
"waves of horripulation flee across her skin."
But Instead of panicking, Dorothy composes
herself and decides that whatever is standing
in front of her is probably hungry: she offers
him celery.
Thus begins a relationship between Dorothy
and Aquarius (Larry, really — it's the closest
version of his name she can pronounce) that is
more human than anything previous in her
life. Larry is part lover, part replacement for
Dorothy's lost child. Most important, he's a
way out of an existence that's been entirely
drained of meaning. Dorothy devotes all of her
time and attention to her lizard love. One
wonders what she did with her life beforehand,
and one wonders at the fact that aside from a
few vague comments from a girlfriend, no one
seems to notice that Dorothy has opted out of
the human race.
Throughout the novel Ingalls is riding a very
thin line — were Larry not an entirely
believable character, the story would
degenerate to the level of simpleminded sci-fl
or soft-core porn. But everything about Larry
seems plausible: his craving for avocados, his
foot size, his concerns about being away too
long from his own people and lifestyle. Fred
Caliban, by contrast, seems vapid; perhaps a
bit too vapid, actually, becuase It's hard to un
derstand Dorothy's continued attentions to
him.
Larry and Dorothy live for months in a state
of suspended animation, only occasionally
troubled by unexpected visitors or Larry's In
creasing restlessness. But one night when
Larry is out on the town (humanized by spec
tacles and a wig. driving Dorothy's car) he kills

a group of thugs. Things go from bad to worse:
Dorothy is torn between worrying about Larry,
worrying about her friend Estelle (whose son
Larry has killed) and realizing that she isn't
the only one in her marriage having an affair.
There's no happy ever-after in this suburban
fairytale, but I won't go into detail. "Mrs.
Caliban'' is one of the few books in the past
year that has an ending I've particularly cared
about— and making the reader care about a
murderous lizardman is no small feat.
I don't have much to say about Ingalls as a
stylist, because she's an incredibly under
stated writer. There's something British about
the sparsity of her prose, which may have had
something to do with its instant recognition in
Britain. But the lifestyle she is chronicling —
and dissecting — is distinctly American. At the
end of the book, we're left wondering how so
few details — half of them surreal — could so
accurately convey the hyperdetalled essence of
suburban banality,'but that's what "Mrs.
Caliban" does. Too bad the producers of "The
Man From Atlantis" never read this book.
