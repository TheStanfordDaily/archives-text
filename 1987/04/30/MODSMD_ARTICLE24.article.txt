# Who can possibly replace Shelley Long on 'Cheers'?
## 
### ANDREW BERKOWITZ Staff writer 
The announcement by Shelley Long
that this will be her final season on the
popular TV sitcom "Cheers" has led many
to believe that the show is doomed for
cancellation: it will have lost the spark
that results from the caustic chemistry
between Sam (Ted Danson) and Diane
(Long). However, careful selection of a
new female lead to replace Long could
result in a resurgence in the popularity of
"Cheers" after Long departs on next
week's episode.
I suggest Cybill Shepherd.
Because the last episode of
"Moonlighting" ended with David and
Maddie entwined in her bed —
presumably not to apprehend a criminal
who had removed those little tags from
the sheets — the rampant sexual tension

that existed between the two detectives is
lost forever. What a career move it would
be for Cybill Shepherd to find a new guy to
have sexual tension with. She and Dan
son could still have those Emmy-winning
arguments that have made "Cheers" so
enjoyable, but think about the added di
mension she would bring to the show.
Compared to Long, Shepherd packs
enough sexual tension to melt the picture
tube in your television.
This, unfortunately, would leave a
rather large gap in the "Moonlighting"
cast that would need to be filled.
The obvious choice is Lisa Bonet.
Bonet is Bill Cosby's fashionable
daughter on "The Cosby Show," and
Mickey Rourke's X-rated mate in the con
troversial "Angel Heart." Bruce Willis
would finally meet his match. One minute
she would be a demure teenage girl, inno
cently overlooking his sexual double en

tendres with a blush and a turn of the
head, the next minute a sexual dynamo,
waiting topless behind Miss DiPesto's
desk to grab Willis for a bloody orgy on the
floor of the Blue Moon Detective Agency.
America's favorite question: "Will they or
won't they?" would be replaced by: "What
will they or what won't they?" Besides,
Bruce Willis even looks kinda like Mickey
Rourke.
Of course this leaves a space that needs
to be filled on "The Cosby Show." Where
can we find a young, talented, black
female on such short notice?
I nominate Debi Thomas.
You've loved her as a world-champion
ice skater and a Stanford pre-med under
grad, but think of how great she'd be as
the new Cosby daughter. Although Debi
wouldn't be able to film episodes for the
show while competing in the '88 Olym
pics, the producers could probably hire

Oprah Winfrey as Debi's double — and
film her through a very unfocused lens.
However, this would mean that Stan
ford would have to find a new star to bring
fame and publicity to our otherwise un
known school.
I can think of no one better than
Madonna.
I know, she's not an Olympic hopeful,
but hey. if Princeton has Brooke Shields,
shouldn't we have someone even better?
Besides bringing instant notoriety to
Stanford, think of how much fun it would
be to meet her at parties: dance with her
to her own music: kiss her in the Quad
under a full moon.
We wouldn't expect Madonna to con
tinue her recording career while she was
busy plowing through Aeschylus and
Aristophanes, so I suspect we would have
to nominate a new candidate for the title
of Recording Superstar.

Why not Sam Donaldson?
I'm sure he's sick of his career walking
aimlessly on the White House lawn, and
would relish the opportunity to be famous
all over the world. What a challenge for
him to slink around onstage in lace un
derwear and fishnet stockings. 1 he al
bums would go platinum: The self-titled
"Donaldson," the follow up "Like a Ver
min," the triumphant third album True
Boob."
So this leaves us with one more prob
lem — who can we find to replace Sam
Donaldson as the White House correspon
dent for ABC News? We need somone who
is smart and hard-working, but at the
same time brash and obnoxious. Some
one the public respects for brains instead
of looks. A person who doesn't object to
being blunt and to the point.
I wonder what Shelley Long is doing
