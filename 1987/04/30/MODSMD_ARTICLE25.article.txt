## Delayed reaction Card offense explodes a day late at SCU 
### JOHN LIS Editorial staff 
SANTA.CLARA — Sure, there was a
blowout. It just came a day late.
Tuesday. Stanford hosted Stanislaus
State, a Division 111 team it had
devastated 35-0 the year before, and
escaped with a 3-2 win. Yesterday, Stan
ford traveled south to Buck Shaw
Stadium to face a decent Santa Clara
team and scored in each of the first seven
innings to take home a 21-7 victory.
It was a two-touchdown win in a con
verted football stadium, and the hot bat
for the Cardinal belonged to a new mem
ber of the New Orleans Saints. Center
fielder Toi Cook did his best Bo Jackson
Impersonation — going 4-for-5 with a
third-Inning grand slam over the 385-foot
sign in left center that made the score 11-
0 — and couldn't help but improve his
bargaining position after having been se
lected in the eighth round of Tuesday's
National Football League draft.
'Nah," Cook said when asked if con
tract negotiations were in the back of his
mind during the five-RBI afternoon. "I
was just trying to work my way back to
hitting the ball hard. For us to be success
ful, I've got to be more consistent. We're
making our big push now. This is the
time."
Third baseman Ed Sprague helped the

Cardinal off to a 5-0 start after two In
nings with back-to-back two-run homers
with Cook aboard. The first was an
opposite-field shot to right, the second a
blast over the left-field fence estimated at
420 feet. The ball surprised spring foot
ball practice on the neighboring field.
"It feels good to get back in the groove,"
said Sprague, whose 13 homers this
season tie him for third in the Stanford
record book. "I didn't swing the bat good
at Arizona State last weekend. I took some
extra batting practice this week and got
back in the groove." It was the first time
Sprague has homered in consecutive at
bats this season.
Lee Plemel, 7-4, got the win for the
Cardinal, 35-14, hurling six innings of
six-hit ball while only allowing one earned
run. Brian Keyser was touched for five
unearned runs in the eighth but finished.
Matt McCormlck, 4-5, started and took
the loss for the Broncos, 22-25. McCor
mick was hammered for seven runs, all
earned, on six hits in 2 1/3 innings.
With two men on and one out in the
third, Ron Vogt was summoned to put out
the fire. He might consider a career as an
arsonist. Vogt proceeded to walk Frank
Carey, David Esquer and Ruben Amaro —
who went 3-for-4 with three RBIs — then
watched Cook's ninth homer of the year
land at the base of the scoreboard in left
center.

Vogt escaped the third, but in the
fourth was responsible for the first four
batters scoring. In two-thirds of an in
ning, Vogt allowed eight earned runs on
four hits, four walks and one hit
batsman. His ERA for the game was
108.00.
By the sixth inning, Stanford Coach
Mark Marquess decided his starters had
gotten enough exercise circling the bases
en route to a 16-2 lead and decided to
show some mercy on the Santa Clara
pitchers, who were risking serious cases
of whiplash. The problem was, no one told
the Cardinal reserves that Stanford had
scored enough.
Scott Delucchi was the first replace
ment, and he drilled an offering from
Greg Gohr over the center-field fence for
his second home run of the season. Kevin
Tahan, in his first varsity plate appear
ance in three seasons, and backup
catcher Eric Cox both walked, and then
came home on singles by Ron Witmeyer
and Esquer to make it 19-2.
Delucchi came back the next inning
with a single to score Gary Sawka, who
had walked, and then Tahan got his first
collegiate hit on a single to right. Delucchi
scored on the play on an error by right
fielder Vince Machi. but Tahan died at
third.

Toi Cook responded to his selection by the New Orleans Saints in Tuesday's NFL
draft by going 4-for-5 yesterday, including a third-inning grand slam, his ninth
homer of the year.
Santa Clara picked up five runs
in the eighth, none of them
earned thanks to errors by third
baseman Glenn Stevenson —
making his first appearance of the
season — and left fielder Eric
DeGraw. Ironically, DeGraw had
made the defensive play of the
game In the sixth, a diving grab of
a fading liner by Chris McCall.

"It's just one of those things
that happen In a baseball game,"
Marquess said of the explosion.
"Some days you come out and hit
the ball like that, other days you
can't. We're not this good, and
they're a better team than that.
They're usually pretty tough on
us."
Stanford has the week off In
conference play, but will host
Santa Clara at Sunken Diamond
Sunday at 1 p.m. The Cardinal
returns to conference play a week
from today at California.
