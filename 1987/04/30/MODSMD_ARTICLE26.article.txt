# Heiden: From Olympic star to med student
## 
### AIMEE BERG 
The world has witnessed what
he's done. Few know where he is
now, however, because keeping
up with Eric Heiden isn't easy.
Athletically, it never has been.
But now, after two Olympics, five
gold medals at Lake Placid, N.Y.,
in 1980, and several world cham
pionships, Heiden has retired
from speed skating.
He bid good riddance to post
meet banquets "where you have to
go hang out with the mayor if you
do well, while all your friends are
in back throwing food around," he
said.
Unprecedented amounts of free
time soon followed. "It was nice to
wake up in the morning and say,
'What do I want to do today?' I fi
nally didn't have to worry about
missing a workout, jeopardizing
my career. . . . My time was my
own," he said.
However, he said he still misses
the people and camaraderie most
of all, which is partly why has cho
sen to be a TV commentator at the
1988 Winter Olympics in Calgary,
Alberta.
After hanging up his skates, all
six of his world records were bro
ken, but his momentum wasn't.
He shifted to competitive cycling.
Though he said last year was his
final year of serious bike racing,
Heiden will continue to enter
small criteriums across the U.S.
as a member of the elite 7-Eleven
Professional Men's Team.
His athletic schedule shrunk
primarily for medical reasons. He
plans to be a doctor, and life as a
first-year med student at Stanford
takes up a lot of his time.
In the long run, he plans to
pursue either orthopedics, like his

father, or sports physiology. The
28-year-old Heiden admits that
the toughest thing about Stanford
med school, so far, is the hyper
sonic pace at which the material is
covered — an ironic confession
from the former speed-skating
king.
Nonetheless, he likes life at the
Farm, even if he's never seen Big
Game.
He first came to Stanford as an
undergraduate and earned his
bachelor s degree in biology in
1984 after having transferred here
from Wisconsin. UC-San Diego
and a university in Norway.
Compared to other campuses,
he finds that at Stanford, "It's
easier to fit in. There are so many
people who are outstanding in
something."
He was once particularly averse
to public attention, but has since
slimmed his trademark tree-trunk
thighs, shed his gold speedsuit
and lost his boyish cheeks. "A lot
of times, people don't recognize
me. When people know who you
are . . . it's no fun. You can't let
loose," he lamented.
For Heiden, letting loose is more
than learning how to play basket
ball — a game in which he claims
to have "little body coordination."
"I need high thrill-factor en
deavors. I walk planks, hang out
over dams. . . In a word, he
calls himself extreme.
Sating his lust for adventure re
quires a lot of risks and a "go till
you blow attitude, (but) injuries
are the one thing I worry about,"
he said.
In competition, he knows pain
well. He thrives on it."I know how
to suffer. During a race, there's a
