# Cornelius in fifth at par
## Golfers in 3rd, 18 strokes behind ASU, USC

And Stanford Coach Tim
Baldwin was worried about her
health.
Cardinal junior Kay Cor
nelius, who's been sick "off and
on for the last couple months."
according to Baldwin, shot a
team-low 75 yesterday in the
third round of the inaugural
Pacific 10 Conference cham
pionships. Her third con
secutive even-par 75 of the
tournament led the Stanford
women's golf team to a 305,
good for a third-place tie with
Arizona behind USC and
Arizona State. The Cardinal's
three-round total of 917 puts
Stanford 18 shots behind the
tournament co-leaders.
Cornelius' two-day total of 225
at Oro Valley Country Club is
just three shots off the individ
ual lead. She trails Kim Saiki of
USC at 222. ASU's Pam Wright,
who shot 69 yesterday, at 223,
and USC's Tracy Nakamura and
Danielle Amacapane of ASU at
224.
"I played pretty well, pretty
consistently. I could've been a
few shots lower. I was two under
with 4 to go and bogeyed 15 and
17. I've putted a lot better this

week than 1 have the whole
season. 1 got some help In
Phoenix (the Cardinal's last
tournament site) from Kerry
Graham, a pro at McCormick
Ranch. She helped me with
some mental things. She's kind
of a sports psychologist, but she
knows the game, too," Cornelius
explained.
Cornelius started slowly, then
picked up her game at the turn.
After making an up-and-down
for par on the first hole, Cor
nelius birdied the second. She
waded through the rest of the
front nine without another
birdie, but started the back side
with a flurry.
"I didn't start very well. 1 was
really tired when 1 teed off.
That's really strange. I was
thinking. You've just got to go
out and keep the good tempo.'
After my start, it was really great
to get up-and-down on the first
green," Cornelius said.
She got a bit of a bad break on
the 15th hole. After a solid drive,
her approach shot hit the green
in excellent shape, but the put
ting surface was so hard that
the action on her ball did not
take and it slipped into the back
bunker. She made a good effort,
but could not get down in two
for par.

"It's a good course, but it's not
in very good condition. It's dry
and they've let it go a little bit.
They're not taking care of it very
well. Apparently they plan big
renovations soon." Cornelius
said.
She was being kind. The
course is in Tucson. It's dry. It's
brown. It's bermuda and rye.
After the plush conditions at the
Stanford Golf Course, leaving
the Bay Area for the desert is
brutal. The course, as do most
in Arizona at this time of year,
resembles a piece of used
sandpaper.
"You get a lot of lies in the fair
way that you're not used to,"
Cardinal senior Kathleen
McCarthy said.
Luckily, despite being narrow
in some areas, the course is not
harshly set up. and the par 75.
6.300-yard layout has permitted
some fantastic scoring.
"We had a good round as a
team, but we didn't gain any
ground. Everyone else played
really well. too. The 305 today
was one of our best scores of the
year," Cornelius said.
McCarthy had a disappointing
78 yesterday to go with her 36-
hole total of 150 after the first
