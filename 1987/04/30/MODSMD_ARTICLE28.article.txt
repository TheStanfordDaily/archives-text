### CHRIS CRADER Staff writer 
Some things always remain a constant during
spring quarter. The days get longer, the lake fills up,
people start thinking they're really cool just because
they got into windsurfing class and the Stanford
women's tennis team wins.
The team finished up its home dual-match
schedule yesterday with a 6-3 victory over U.S. Inter
national. on a windy day at Stanford Tennis
Stadium, running its record to 18-3 in the process.
The No. 16 Gulls came into the match looking to
improve their chances at an NCAA berth, but came
out soundly defeated and are now 19-13, while the
fifth-ranked Cardinal looked only to better its
seeding in the tournament.
Stanford Coach Frank Brennan was fairly happy
with the result. "I was pleased we won; I thought they
put up a good fight." he said. "They played well."
The scoring began in just over an hour when three
time All-America Patty Fendick posted a 6-1. 6-1 win
over Clare Thompson in No. 1 singles, running her
record to 29-0 on the year. Including the end of last
season. Fendick has now won 46 straight matches
on the collegiate level and, despite her No. 1 1
ranking, will likely be favored to defend her NCAA in
dividual title at the championships in two weeks.
Within a minute. Stanford's lead went to 2-0 as
sophomore Cindy Buchsbaum defeated Bettina
Wteneeke in the No. 5 singles by a 6-2. 6-0 score.
Buchsbaum. a transfer from Harvard, has been on a
roll of late, winning four of her last five matches and
moving up to the No. 5 spot.
"I thought Patty played her usual solid match at
No. 1." said Brennan. "(And) Cindy's been doing
great. It's nice to get those good matches out of her."
"If you play the wind just right, you can really drive

your opponent nuts," Buchsbaum said.
The Cardinal's lead was short-lived, however, as
two other International Gulls avenged the losses of
their Australian and German teammates. Sylvie
Tetreault beat Senior Stephanie Savides in the No. 2
match 6-3, 6-1 to cut the margin, then Kefi
Binyamini triumphed over freshman Lisa Green at
No. 3. 7-5. 6-1.
Brennan wasn't too happy with the two straight
set losses, saying, "1 was pleased with some things; I
was not pleased with some things. Those are not
matches we should be losing at this point."
Things were a little tight at this time, as in the No.
6 match where Eleni Rossides was tied in the second
set with Carolyn Reed after losing the first, and, at
No. 4, Kay Tittle was down 5-2 in the second set after
taking the first from Elizna Nortje.
Things got better quickly, though. Tittle, a junior,
was able to get two service breaks back to even the
score at 5-5, but then was broken again and Nortje
was serving to reach a third set. Tittle got the break
at a 3-3 point to go to a tiebreaker, and then fought
off two more set points, at 6-5 and 7-6. before ending
the tiebreaker and the match. 6-2. 7-6 (9-7).
This left Rossides with the opportunity to send the
Cardinal into the doubles at 4-2. Rossides. consid
ered one of the best recruits in the country a year
ago, was playing her first singles in a dual match in
over a year due to stress fractures in both legs, and
was up to the task, coming up with a 5-7, 6-4. 6-2
win after more than two hours of play.
"Rossides is getting a little better every time out,"
said Brennan. "That was a great win for her."
"I wasn't moving too well but managed to pull it
out." Rossides said. "In two weeks (at the NCAAs) I'll
be much better."
The doubles matches were
quicker, with none lasting much
more than an hour, and Stanford
again had the Gulls' number,
taking two of three.
Fendlck and Savides continued
to play well, scoring a 6-1, 6-2 vic
tory at No. 1 while Green and
Tittle won at No. 3. 6-2, 6-3.
Buchsbaum and senior Leigh
Anne Eldredge. who is still getting
back into the swing of things after
her own bout with a stress
fracture, lost a tough match at No.
2 by a 6-1. 6-3 margin, to a team
Brennan called "very probably
their best."

The team's only remaining
match is Friday at California,
where Stanford will look to avenge
its loss March 4. The NCAA cham
pionships begin May 14 at UCLA,
and the Cardinal will try to defend
its national title.
"We've spent the whole year with
one person or another hurt,"
Buchsbaum said. "Now everyone's
healthy; that's a good confidence
builder. Having all those names,
that has to say something to the
other teams."
