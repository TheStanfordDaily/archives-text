# Men golfers look for turnaround at ASU
## 
### ROBERT PORTNOY Staff writer 
After "something of a setback"
in the Western Intercollegiate, the
Stanford men's golf team takes a
new look into this week's Sun
Devil Intercollegiate in Tempe,
Ariz., according to Stanford
Coach Tim Schaaf.
National power Arizona State,
the host of the tournament, is led
by the No. 1 collegiate player in the
country. Bill Mayfair. He won both
the events held at the Stanford
golf course this season.
The Cardinal sends a group of
six that may not be familiar to
many who have followed Stanford
golf this year. The names they will
recognize are freshmen Mark Fun
seth, Steve White and sophomore
Roger Miraglia. The others have
played very few tournaments this
year as part of the Cardinal six:
freshmen Brad Joondeph, Brad
Benbrook and Josh Zander.
Funseth is the top player in the
group at present. He shot a final
round 76 for a 220 total that tied
him for eighth place in the West
ern. It was the best performance
by a Stanford individual in a
tournament with such a high
quality field.
Yet the performance of the team
as a whole was not what the team
had hoped for at this stage in the
season. The year has been less
than fulfilling, and the Cardinal
golfers have just two tournaments
remaining, the other being the
Pacific 10 Championships, in
which to turn things around.
"We have two tournaments left.
We need to play better, if only for
what it'll do for next year, so we
can put a little better taste on this

(season)," Schaaf said. "We're
young and we have little experi
ence. We have had trouble on the
road. We'll know the courses bet
ter next year. All the reasons are
not enough to explain why we
haven't played better. The next
couple weeks we have to regroup
and get ourselves pulled together.
"The Sun Devil Is one of the top
tournaments In the country and
Pac-lOs will be the top conference
tournament In the countiy. There
are only Oregon State and Wash
ington State that we can be con
sidered ahead of. and that's a new
position for us."
