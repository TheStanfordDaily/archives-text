# No Western Culture vote until fall
##

The Faculty Senate will not vote on any
changes in the Area One requirement before
next fall, according to Marsh McCall, chair of
the Committee on Undergraduate Studies
(CUS) and professor of classics.
In order to reach the senate, the final pro
posal of the Area One Task Force must first be
recommended by the CUS, McCall said. Con
sidering the short time remaining in the quar
ter, it will be very difficult for the CUS to make
more than a brief evaluation of any final task
force proposal, he said.
"At the CUS level, the people taking formal
action will not be on this year's committee, but
next year's committee," McCall said.
History Prof. Paul Seaver, chairman of the
Area One Task Force, recognized that the CUS
"may only have time to receive the proposal"
and may put off formal evaluations until next
fall. But Seaver said the task force will still try
to complete its draft before May â– - the date
of CUS's last official meeting of the quarter.

In an attempt by the task force to gather as
much input as possible before completing a
final proposal, forums for faculty and students
to discuss the draft have been organized for
next week.
The task force will meet with lecturers from
the entire Western Culture program next Tues
day to hear faculty reaction to the draft. Ac
cording to Bill King, a student member of the
task force, there will also be an "issues forum"
next Wednesday for students to get informa
tion and comment on the Western Culture
debate.
King also said that a group of concerned stu
dents intends to sponsor a debate between
those in favor of going beyond the proposal
and those who desire more limited changes.
According to King, one of the problem's with
the current Western Culture debate has been
the misinterpretation of the task force's
proposals. While the faculty have perceived the
proposal as a "revolution," the proposal is ac
tually an "evolution" of the current reforms
being Implemented by the various Western
Culture tracks. King said.

When completed, the final proposal will keep
many of the Innovations of the current draft,
Seaver said, adding that he has not yet heard
any public criticism that would lead him to
discard the proposal. In fact, many of the
public responses have demonstrated why a
course emphasizing "cultural diversity" is ne
cessary, he said.
People fail to realize that "when we're talking
about diversity of culture, we're talking about
America," Seaver said. "The West is a combina
tion of different cultures and we need to find
some way to present this."
The task force must further clarify appropri
ate methods for "looking at another culture in
its own terms," Seaver said.
For example, the task force intends to design
several sample syllabi that demonstrate an ap
propriate treatment of another culture, he
said.
Both the provost and the CUS will receive a
final copy of the Area One Task Force proposal.
The CUS asked University Provost James
Rosse to establish the AreaXDne Task Force last
year.
