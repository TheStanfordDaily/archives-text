# Stanford to host cycling races
## 
### WITOLD J. HENISZ Staff writer 
The Stanford Cycling team has
finished a 15-race regular season
that dates back to the second
week in February. The Cardinal
raced more than a dozen schools
each weekend and never finished
below third place. Yet It has had
one conspicuous disadvantage: It
has yet to host a meet.
This weekend the Cardinal will
stay at home to host the WCCC
Championships. Over 300 cyclists
from 22 schools across the state of
California will parcipate in this
two-day, three-race championship
series.
After a tremendous 100-point
victory on its home course last
weekend, UC-Santa Barbara has
taken the league lead with 846
points. Cal Poly-San Luis Obispo,
which held first place from Feb. 8
until April 26, has slipped into
second with a score of 836.5. Once
seemingly swept aside by this
private feud, the Cardinal
rebounded in the second half of

the season and now sits in third
place with 783.5 points.
There are three races spread out
over this championship weekend.
An individual time trial will test
riders' stamina and pain thresh
old on Saturday morning. This
will be followed by a road race
course that features 3.200 vertical
feet of climbing for the top cate
gory riders.
On Sunday, the championship
series moves from the town of Pes
cadero to the Stanford campus. A
tricky 0.6-mile loop with a 180-
degree turn has been selected for
the championship criterium. The
first race begins at 9 a.m. by the
tennis courts across from Encina

gymnasium.
The winner of the league cham
pionship will most likely not be
decided until the final sprint of
the A' race at about 5 p.m.
Spectators should keep an eye
on several riders:
□ Junior Tom Moyer has finished
in the top 12 in all 15 A' division
races.
□ Freshman John Coyle took off
his skates and began riding for
the A' squad only two weeks ago.
□ Graduate student Jennifer
Hubbert will be in her last race for
the Cardinal and hungry for her
first victory after the judges
awarded a photo-finish to a UCSB
rider last weekend.
