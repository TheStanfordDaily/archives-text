# Anti-Semitic fliers found on campus
## 
### DIANE BISGEIER Senior staff writer 
Packets of anti-Semitic liter
ature were found placed on stu
dents' cars and bicycles around
campus Tuesday night, according
to Stanford Police Chief Marvin
Herrington.
The literature accuses the
Justice Department's Office of
Special Investigations (OSI) and
world Jewry of "using" the
Holocaust as "a weapon against
the conscience of the non-Jewish
masses."
"1 think its just some local anti-
Semitic group," Herrington said,
adding that racist literature was

recently found in high schools in
Palo Alto, Mountain View and Los
Altos.
Herrington said there have not
been similar incidents at Stanford
"for a long time." and that the dis
tribution was "apparently not
widespread."
He said he suspects the fliers
might be a response to the current
public television miniseries
"Shoah," which features firsthand
reports of Auschwitz concentra
tion camp survivors.
Herrington said he would try to
identify and locate whoever dis
tributed the literature. It is tech
nically illegal to leave literature on
private vehicles without a permit

to do so, he said.
But Law Prof. Robert Weisberg
said the literature itself would be
protected under the First Amend
ment. "I don't even see an issue,"
he said.
Lisa Neeley, who found
literature on her car outside of El
Centro Chicano, said she had
"never seen anything like this on
campus before." The incident
"definitely represents the whole
rise in white supremacy youth
groups," she said. "It's appalling."
Neeley thinks the fliers might
also be a response to the interna
tional week in memory of the
Holocaust.
The leaflets attack the OSI for

its recent deportment of American
John Demjanjuk to Israel for trial
on Nazi war criminal charges.
They call Demjanjuk a "pawn in
the game" to "keep the Holocaust
alive."
The literature attests that books
and essays about the Holocaust
serve to build a "Holocaust myth"
that "encourages the memory as
an excuse for one more nation
unifying ritual and not as a tool
for understanding."
The leaflets also advocate sup
port for Ernst Zundel, author of
"Did Six Million Really Die?" who
was acquitted of spreading false
news in Canada in January. The
literature also includes several
news clippings about other Nazi
war criminals.
Freshman Brian Bonnlander
found leaflets on his bike outside
of the Math Department."l didn't
know how to react," he said. "I
hope that people will be able to see

and understand the flier. I was
shocked at the disgusting things
that were in there."
Both Neeley and Bonnlander
were attending a meeting con
cerning the Western Culture task
force report when the fliers were
distributed. They left the meeting
at about 9 p.m.
Neeley said she saw leaflets on a
bike near her car. Bonnlander did
not see other fliers in the area
where his bike was parked.
