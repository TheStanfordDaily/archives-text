# Charges unlikely in drowning death
## 
### JOHN LIS Editorial staff 
The lawyer for the Zeta Psi
fraternity said yesterday that
no criminal or civil charges are
expected against the fraternity
or any of its members as a
result of the drowning last
week of junior David Dunshee.
Meanwhile, Stanford police
are continuing their investiga
tion of the drowning, which oc
curred early April 22 following a
Zete rush party at the Boat
house next to Lagunita.
"Absolutely not," said Mike
Klinn, the Zeta Psi lawyer,
gal action against the frater
nity. "There's no fear of any
thing at all," he said. The Zetes
"just wanted to see that when
the Stanford police interviewed
them, they had an attorney
available," he noted.
Speculation that legal action
might be taken against those
responsible for serving alcohol
to Dunshee, who at 20 was un
derage in California, appears to
be groundless. Asst. District
Attorney Ron Rico said through
his secretary he can make no
comment until he receives the
police report, but Stanford
Police Chief Marvin Herrington
said the likelihood of such ac
tion being taken is small.
"There was alcohol, but no
one was selling it," Herrington
said. "The laws on sale are
much more stringent than the

laws on providing alcohol to
minors."
Herrington had speculated
Friday, when Dunshee's body
was discovered in the lake, that
the Zete member had fallen
into the water and drowned be
cause he was disoriented from
being intoxicated. He said he
expects to confirm his prelimi
nary finding with a later report.
"All we're waiting for is
verification of what we already
know," Herrington said. Her
rington could not say when the
report will be released.
Zeta Psi President Neil Han
son and Zete active Phil Klein
are believed to be the last
people to have seen Dunshee
alive around 1 a.m. last Wed
nesday morning, when Dun
shee had told them he was
going home. Both have made
statements to the police, but on
Klinn's advice are waiting until
the police report is made public
before making any further
statements.
"I don't think it's appropriate
for me to comment at this
time," Klinn said. "The story
will come out indue time."
Both Klein and Hanson have
said they have nothing to hide,
but are simply acting on
Klinn's advice.
Students who lived in
Lagunita Court with Dunshee
last year will be holding a spe
cial sunrise memorial service at
the Dish Friday morning. Stu
dents are asked to meet in front
of Lagunita Court at 5:45 a.m.
