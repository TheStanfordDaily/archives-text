### CLAY CALVERT Staff writer 
A new dean of undergraduate studies will
be named within two weeks to replace out
going Carolyn Lougee, according to Norman
Wessells, dean of Humanities and Sciences.
Wessells, chair of the search committee
charged with selection of the new dean,
said the list of candidates has been
narrowed from about 40 to 15. All the can
didates are now tenured faculty from one of
the University's three undergraduate
schools, he said, noting that no effort was
made to attract people from other institu
tions.
"The top half-dozen (candidates) would
do extremely well." Wessells said. The can
didates have not been Informed they are
being considered for the job. he added.
Wessells said the search committee is
looking for a scholar and teacher with
managerial skills and the ability to meet
and communicate with staff and student
groups.
"The person has got to be the intellectual
leader of undergraduate education at this
University. They have to have ideas about

undergraduate education and what it
ought to be in a research university." Wes
sells said. "A job like this, in part, is defined
by the qualities of the individual — the in
terests, the capability."
Wessells said he and other committee
members are gathering information and
opinions from other faculty and staff about
the candidates. University President
Donald Kennedy is serving as an adviser in
the process, Wessells said.
In addition to James Gibbons, dean of
the School of Engineering, and George
Thompson, dean of the School of Earth
Sciences, other committee members in
clude Council of Presidents members Carey
White and Kim Crawford. Also on the com
mittee is Joan Lane, an official in
Humanities and Sciences. Wessells said.
An associate professor of history. Lougee
announced in early March that she would
return to regular academic duties. She has
served as dean of undergraduate studies for
the past five years.
"It's time to go back to research and
teaching." Lougee said at the time her res
ignation was announced.
Wessells said he was pleased
with Lougee's performance and
does not anticipate a major
change in the structure of the po
sition or the agenda for under
graduate education.
"We're quite committed to the
kinds of things Carolyn has been
working on. in providing more op
portunities for honors work and
giving juniors and seniors more
options in the curriculum. There
has got to be more of a thrust
there . . . within the next five

years." Wessells said.
He said most students are gen
erally happy with their freshman
year, but more emphasis needs to
be placed on the upperclass years.
"I would suspect that would
turn out to be a primary agen
dum." he said.
Crawford said she wants a dean
with a "demonstrated commit
ment to the maintenance and im
provement of the quality of under
graduate teaching."
Crawford also wants the dean to
have "a good grasp of the many
things that comprise undergradu
ate education." including the cur
riculum. residential education
and extracurricular activities.
