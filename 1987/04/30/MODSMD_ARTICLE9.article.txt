Contra supporter pleads guilty
WASHINGTON — In the first criminal case of the Iran-contra af
fair, conservative fund-raiser Carl (Spitz) Channell pleaded guilty
yesterday to conspiring to defraud the government by soliciting
contributions for military aid to the Nicaraguan contras under the
cover of a tax-exempt charitable foundation.
At a brief hearing in U.S. District Court here, Channell said that
he conspired with Lt. Col. Oliver North, the fired National Security
Council aide, and "others known and unknown" in a scheme that
began in April 1985 to give the contras "non-humanitarian aid"
with tax-deductible donations.
Charges filed Wednesday morning by independent counsel
Lawrence Walsh described contributions of >2,120,000 illegally
collected from three contributors in 1986 alone by Channell's Na
tional Endowment for the Preservation of Liberty (NEPL).
Prosecutors did not say whether President Reagan might be one
of the "others known or unknown" with whom Channell allegedly
conspired or whether Reagan is involved in the case in any way.
Sen. Daniel Inouye, D-Hawaii, chairman of the Senate select
committee looking into the Iran-Contra affair, told CBS yesterday
that Reagan was "very much knowledgeable" about private fund
raising for the contras.
"He was not just a peripheral player, but he was involved very
deeply," Inouye said. "People have suggested that he was getting
old and he didn't know what was happening. What we're saying is
that from what we have seen, for example in some of the notes (in
his diary), he knew what was happening," he added.
Letters to NEPL donors obtained by The Washington Post last
month referred to two meetings between Channell and Reagan in
March 1986. Other NEPL records show that Channell and his
fund-raisers made liberal use of the White House's name in
wooing donors.
Contras may have killed American
MANAGUA, Nicaragua — A year and a half ago, American en
gineer Ben Linder said, he had been told that he and other mem
bers of his crew on the El Cua hydroelectric project were targeted
for death by the U.S.-funded rebels known as contras.
"The end of '85 or the beginning of '86, one of the workers on
the crew of the power plant, his sister, was kidnapped by the con
tras," Linder, 27, said in an Interview two weeks ago in Managua.
"And then, six days or seven days later, she escaped. And one of
the things the contras told her was that all of the people on the
crew had become targets of the contras."
According to the Nicaraguan government, Linder and two
Nltaraguans were killed Tuesday when they and four other men
apparently were surprised by contra guerrillas while surveying a
hydroelectric site near the northern Nicaraguan town of San Jose
de Bocay. Linder was the first American citizen working with the
Sandinista government to be killed by the rebels during the 5-
year-old war.
A contra official in Washington, Bosco Matamoros, yesterday
denied that Linder had been targeted. Matamoros said Linder was
killed during combat between contra forces and "Sandinista
regulars." There have been frequent clashes between the two sides
in the area In recent weeks, he said.
Nicaraguan journalists who said they arrived at the scene of the
attack by helicopter said it appeared Linder and the six other men
had been ambushed from a copse of trees above a stream where
they had been working. Linder, who suffered a shrapnel wound to
the head, apparently from a grenade, died at the scene, they said.
Israel-Jordan talks possible
JERUSALEM — The United States is involved in a new Middle
East diplomatic initiative to press Israel and Jordan into direct
peace talks under the auspices of an international conference, a
move that could lead to the breakup of Israel's fragile coalition gov
ernment.
The initiative, which threatens to thrust the United States into
the middle of an intense political squabble here between Israel's
leaders, Includes a letter from President Reagan urging Prime
Minister Yitzhak Shamir to consider the conference proposal and
a possible visit — now postponed — to the region by Secretary of
State George Shultz.
The American effort is being pursued with the strong support of
Foreign Minister Shimon Peres, leader of Israel's more dovish
Labor Alignment political bloc, who sees U.S. mediation as a way
of forcing his rightist Likud governing partners either to accept
the conference proposal or to call for early national elections.
The conference proposal is strongly opposed by Shamir, leader
of the Likud, and his supporters. To thwart what increasingly
looks like a joint Peres-American effort, Shamir last weekend dis
patched Cabinet minister Moshe Arens, the former Israeli ambas
sador to the United States, to Washington to tell Shultz that Likud
leaders were firm In their opposition to such a conference, accord
ing to Israeli government sources.
Protectionist bill passes House
WASHINGTON — Despite a veto threat, the House narrowly ap
proved a controversial amendment to its trade bill yesterday that
would require U.S. retaliation against countries that use unfair
tactics to maintain huge trade surpluses with the United States.
The provision, sponsored by Rep. Richard Gephardt. D-Mo.,
with the strong support of organized labor, passed 218 to 214. Al
though President Reagan has called the amendment dangerously
protectionist, Gephardt won the support of 17 of the 177 House
Republicans.
The vote came hours before the arrival here of Japanese Prime
Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone, whose country is a major target of
the Gephardt provision. Nakasone will hold two days of meetings
with Reagan, other administration leaders and key members of
Congress.
The Gephardt amendment drew 201 Democratic votes. But 55
Democrats, led by Ways and Means Committee Chairman Dan
Rostenkowski, D-111., voted against the Gephardt proposal.
Gephardt, who has made trade policy a cornerstone of his cam
paign for the 1988 Democratic presidential nomination, said he
was pleased by his victory even if the margin was narrower than
anticipated.
Dukakis declares candidacy
BOSTON — Michael Dukakis, a Greek Immigrant's son seeking
to capitalize on Massachusetts' reputation for social policy inno
vation and high-tech economic prosperity, formally declared his
candidacy yesterday for the Democratic presidential nomination.
Standing on Boston Common, the 53-year-old. third-term
governor said the policies he has pursued demonstrate the path to
"vibrant and sustained economic growth" and "genuine opportu
nity for every American."
Dukakis said Wednesday that he faces "long odds . . . but no
longer than anyone else's. ... I really think the race is wide
open." Two recent newspaper polls have shown him even with or
slightly ahead of Hart in the Jeadoff primary state of New
Hampshire, where Boston television has given him high name
recognition. But he faces a far tougher struggle eight days earlier
in the lowa caucuses, where his late-starting campaign has yet to
develop significant momentum.
Dukakis repeated his announcements yesterday in Manchester.
N.H.. Atlanta and Des Moines, stressing at each stop not only the
economic success story of Massachusetts but the reputation for
competence and honesty which gave him impressive election vic
tories here in 1982 and 1986.
