Early in his career Albert
realized that his life's dream of
improving Lowenbrau's formula
was a futile one.
Bottle by bottle, he would
examine and discuss the sub
atomic particles of Lowenbrau's
rich taste. He would often theorize
that Bavarian supervision, plus
tlte richness of Bavarian hops
brewed fresh and smooth, was the
best way in the world to brew beer.
And at about ten o'clock on
any given Thursday, he and the
other professors in his department
would gather at tlte Cyclotron
Tavern where they would obtain
hard evidence to support their
findings. Usually a tournament of
quarter bounce would evolve, dur
ing which Albert and his friends
would lose all track of time and
space. Finally, by evening's end,
he would further theorize that
Lowenbrau's mass appeal would
grow exponentially in an ever
expanding universe, and in all the
great beer drinking countries,
because... it's the best way in tlte
world to brew beer.
