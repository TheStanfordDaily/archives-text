# Additional undergrad housing is years off
## 
### CHRIS MYERS Editorial staff 
With Draw results expected
within weeks and the un
guaranteed year still alive and well
at Stanford, undergraduates
could be excused for fantasizing
about an on-campus housing sys
tem sufficient to meet the
demands of all students.
The elimination of the un
guaranteed year, however, won't
become a reality during the under
graduate careers of current Stan
ford students, according to
Rodger Whitney, assistant dean of
Student Affairs and director of
student housing.
The completion of the last incre
ment of undergraduate housing
"is going to happen at some point,
but as yet there are no specific
plans," Whitney said. Regardless
of the form that new undergradu
ate housing takes, Whitney esti
mated the project would probably
not get under way until 1991 "at
the earliest."
"The goal of the University is to
house all undergraduates on
campus who want to live here."
Whitney said. "That's a high ideal,
a big priority."
At present, roughly 4,200 stu
dents enter the Draw each year. Of
these, 700 to 800 are left unas
signed after Round II results are
announced, according to Whitney.
Many of the students In the unas
slgned pool decide to go overseas,
while others either stop out or
prefer to find off-campus housing.
The remaining pool of unas
aigned students usually numbers
between 400 and 500, Whitney
said. This number reflects what
Whitney called "pure unmet
demand" — those students who
want to live on campus but who
are forced off by the unavailability
of housing.
The alms of any new housing
project will be the elimination of
the unguaranteed year by satisfy
ing that "pure unmet demand."
and the creation of enough new
spaces to relieve overcrowding
problems in existing housing.
The overcrowding problems, ac
cording to Whitney, include
Lagunlta Court's freshman "mini
doubles" (rooms that are or
dinarily singles for upperclass
men. but which serve as doubles
for freshmen), as well as some
triples the University would like to
see converted into doubles.
Whitney said the University
must be careful not to overbuild
undergraduate housing. He ex
plained that overbuilding would
create vacancies in campus
housing, which in turn would
force the University to raise board
rates campuswlde in order to meet
costs.
Much attention will be focused
on plans for new housing, because
the next project will be "the last
shot" at undergraduate housing.

according to Whitney. "We want to
be sure that we're meeting all the
needs of students" when the next
round of construction is com
pleted. he said.
Whitney pointed out that
"students already have an enor
mous range of housing options."
but In planning new undergradu
ate structures, the University "will
be asking the question. 'Is there
any type of housing that is miss
ing in the campus housing
pool?' "
Funds for the new housing will
come from the University's Cen
tennial capital campaign, and
once the requisite money Is
available, the University will begin
"some real hard studies" of poten
tial undergraduate housing pro
jects. Whitney said.
The most recently built under
graduate housing facility is Gover
nor's Corner, completed in 1983
and accommodating 800 stu
dents. Immediately after the com
pletion of the facility, the demand
for campus housing increased.
"The minute you build a highly
desirable place, demand goes up,"
Whitney said. "When we built
Governor's Corner, the demand at
the end of the Draw was almost as
much as before it was built."
"But there's a finite number of
people who remain to be housed."
Whitney said.
