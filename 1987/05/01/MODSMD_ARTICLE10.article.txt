# House passes tough trade bill
## 
### 
WASHINGTON — The House passed by a
strong majority yesterday a tough trade reform
package that mandates retaliation against
many U.S. trading partners, ignoring adminis
tration veto threats and objections that it
could provoke a trade war.
Despite a late move by House GOP leaders to
derail the bill, 44 Republicans supported it,
which could give the majority just enough
votes to override a presidential veto.
Only six Democrats opposed the measure,
which in its final form was heavily backed by
organized labor, industries suffering from
foreign imports and a Democratic leadership
scenting a potent Issue for the 1988 presiden
tial campaign.
The legislation, which passed 290-137.
nevertheless faces an uncertain future.
The Senate Finance Committee is working
on a separate trade bill that committee Chair
man Lloyd Bentsen, D-Texas, has said will not
contain any provision resembling the House
bill's most controversial section, which
mandates tough sanctions against exporting
nations that have large trade surpluses with
the United States.
That provision, pushed by Rep. Richard
Gephardt, D-Mo., was adopted Wednesday by
only a four-vote margin, suggesting it will not
survive a Senate-House conference to
negotiate a compromise.
Nevertheless, House Speaker Jim Wright. D-
Texas. implored members to use the bill to

send a clear message to America's trading
partners that It will no longer tolerate unfair
practices that restrict foreign markets to U.S.
goods and undercut American Industries.
He called the legislation "a product of the
House at its best." that he said would force for
eigners to "treat American goods exactly as we
treat their goods."
The vote came as Japanese Prime Minister
Yasuhiro Nakasone was conferring with Presi
dent Reagan about the two nation s trade con
flicts.
The bill includes:
□ A "buy America" provision that bars the
U.S. government from buying any products
from countries that restrict their government's
purchases of American goods.
□ Trade adjustment assistance benefits that
would automatically be available to companies
and workers once the government determines
an industry has been hurt by imports. Benefits
now are granted at the president's discretion.
Benefits also would be improved by granting
workers up to *4,000 each for retraining and
provide temporary supplemental wages if they
take a new job that pays less than their old
one.
□ Strengthened laws to protect U.S.
trademarks, patents and copyrights.
□ The Gephardt amendment, which re
quires countries that export much more to the
U.S. than they import from it to eliminate their
trade barriers and cut their trade surpluses by

10 percent annually. Those falling to comply
would face stiff tariffs or quotas.
□ More funding for export promotions and
agriculture export subsidies.
□ Provisions for the Treasury Department to
negotiate a "competitive dollar exchange rate"
against other major currencies and establish a
Council on Industrial Competitiveness.
□ A requirement that foreign investors hold
ing at least 10 percent Interest in any U.S.
company, bank or farm worth more than *5
million file annual reports with the Depart
ment of Commerce.
Japan, Taiwan. West Germany, South
Korea, Italy and Brazil would be the countries
most hard hit by the sanctions.
The administration has vigorously opposed
the punitive portions of the bill, charging that
they would improperly restrict the president's
flexibility to negotiate trade solutions and
would invariably provoke retaliation against
U.S. products by other nations.
Before the final vote, GOP leaders, including
Minority Leader Robert Michel of Illinois, in
troduced a substitute bill that stripped away
the most stringent features. After it was
defeated 268-156, the Republicans relented
and branded the tougher measure a ill-fated
mistake.
The Gephardt amendment is "a lightning
rod for a veto," Michel said. "I want something
that can be signed into law."
