## THE 						STANFORD DAILY An Independent Newspaper Decisions unjust 
### 
Last week the U.S. Supreme Court made
two irresponsible decisions concerning the
death penalty. First, the court extended the
penalty so that it can be imposed upon all
participants in a felony that results in mur
der — even if they neither killed nor intended
to kill. The next day, the justices practically
closed the door to opponents of the death
penalty by rejecting a challenge that argued
capital punishment is racially discrimina
tory. The court has unwisely extended and
entrenched the death penalty in American
jurisprudence.
The first decision involved two young
brothers, Ricky and Raymond Tison, who
sprung their father, a convicted murderer,
out of an Arizona state prison. After develop
ing car trouble in the desert, they flagged
down a passing car carrying a young couple,
their daughter and their neice. The sons
took the car — leaving their father with the
family — and drove off in order to fill a water
jug that would have been left for the the fam
ily had their father not killed them.
In a 5-4 opinion written by Justice Sandra
Day O'Connor and joined by Chief Justice
William Rehnquist and justices Byron White,
Lewis Powell and Antonin Scalia, the court
upheld the Arizona Supreme Court's ruling
that the sons' actions had constituted "major
participation" in the murders and thus
merited the death penalty.
This is absurd. Clearly the Tison brothers
didn't want harm to come to the family and
intended to help them by providing water in
stead of just leaving them behind.

But the court went further than merely
disregarding the obvious facts of the case; it
broadened the scope of the death penalty and
undercut the trend of recent rulings that lim
ited its application.
Capital punishment is simply wrong. In
the last several months Amnesty Interna
tional has pointed out that the United States
is one of the few democracies that puts its
citizens to death. The court has decided to do
more of that, justifying their opinion in an
argument that an American Civil Liberties
Union spokeperson correctly called
"brainless."
The court acted just as brainlessly when it
dismissed the argument that a penalty that
discriminates by race should be eliminated.
Blacks who kill whites get the death penalty
far more often than others.
In the same 5-4 split, Justice Lewis Powell
argued for the majority that more solid
evidence of racially motivated intent in apply
ing the death penalty — not statistics — had
to be shown in order to prove the penalty is
discriminatory.
Proving intent, however, is nearly
impossible and Powell knows it. The court
has therefore closed the book on statistical
challenges to capital punishment, which
have recently been seen as best way to have
the death penalty ruled unconstitutional.
In both cases, Justices William Brennan,
Thurgood Marshall, John Paul Stevens and
Harry Blackmun dissented strongly. Hope
fully, one of the others soon will come to his
or her senses and join them. The sad thing is
that in the meantime, people will die.
