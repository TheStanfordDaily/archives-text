Res Ed needs
to improve
dorm diversity
How could I have been so
naive? I kept repeating this
phrase over and over again while I
was remembering how far I had
come since fall quarter. I used to
be one of those Chicanos who
thought Casa Zapata was simply
another obstacle in the way of
Mestizo assimilation into Ameri
can society. The seriousness of
this ignorant belief did not occur
to me until I became a troubled
Chicano with no place to turn.
What about my resident fellows,
the resident assistants and my
fellow residents?
Well, when you live in Cedro
{Wilbur Hall), with only five
Hispanics. three blacks and seven
Asians for a grand total of 15
minority residents, the avenues
of cultural support and motiva
tion do not abound. Residential
Education, which could have
regulated the number of minority
students admitted to Cedro, ap
parently failed to check the
surnames of those who drew into
the dorm and assign minority
freshmen accordingly.
To make matters worse, close
examination of the Hispanic
contingent reveals an even more
startling fact: It turns out that
only three are Mestizo while the
other two are Creoles. What? You
mean there is a difference? My RF
didn't seem to think so. He was
surprised that I could feel cul
turally isolated since there were
quite a few students with
Hispanic surnames in the dorm.
What he and others fail to under
stand is that there is a glaring
difference. Creoles are American
born Spaniards and are (by and
large) white. Mestizos, on the
other hand, are a hybrid of
Spanish and Indian, resembling
in most cases the latter in skin
tone (brown). Furthermore, these
two ethnic groups have a history
of racial tension and strife not
unlike that between the blacks
and whites in the South.
Therefore, it should come as no
surprise that I received no sup
port from these individuals. In
fact, even one of the Mestizos, the
RA. helped about as much as the
Creoles. Now I can take a cold
shoulder from a white, black or
Asian, but when one of La Raza
shows no concern for the welfare
of one of his own, my heart is
torn. I am fortunate that God put
two Chicanos in my path who
helped by sharing their common
experiences with me.
I hope that in the future Res Ed
will be more responsible about
the distribution of ethnicity
among the different residences to
ensure cultural support for all
groups. Also. I hope that all Mes
tizos at Stanford who have stayed
away from El Centro Chicano and
Casa Zapata because of arrogance
and low esteem for their heritage
will benefit from my mistake and
realize that although there are

good people of all races, the only
group that will come through for
them during good times and bad
is La Raza Mestiza. I wish there
could be true assimilation and
more warmth extending beyond
racial and social classification,
but unfortunately theory and
dreams are opiates; reality is a
terrible disappointment.

Fun Friday is
a great idea
Bravo! Allen Estes has done it
again. His innovative solution to
a practical problem has the ele
gant simplicity of true genius —
and a clever exposition into the
bargain. I for one intend to
celebrate Fun Friday every year
for the rest of my unnatural life,
and the rest of the country be
damned. It just makes me sorry
that I'm not an engineer; I may
never get kissed at this rate.

Remarks made
by Kennedy
were ignored
We were distressed that The
Daily chose not to cover some very
Important and timely remarks
made by University President
Donald Kennedy at last week's
ASSU Senate meeting in regard to
the draft proposals of the Task
Force on the Area One Require
ment. In contrast to the vast
majority of statements that have
appeared in The Dally — from
columns to editorials to news
quotes — the president's state
ments supported toleration for
the task force's draft proposal and
respect for the thought that went
into them. Perhaps this is why
the statement was not covered.
We agree with Kennedy that
most responses to this point have
been overreactions: Specifically,
the authors have missed the key
word in the proposal. That word
Is draft, and it means that the
task force's first report Is de
signed to elicit suggestions from
the community to help the group
prepare a final report. There is a
long way to go in the commu
nity's analysis of what must be
done with the Western Culture
program, and the only way to
assist the task force's work and
contribute to the positive change
that must come Is to offer well
reasoned arguments to them.
Working to make the report better
is a mature and viable option;
reactively attacking it and
seeking to discard it is not. We.
as a student body, have waited
too many years to let that happen
to the report.
While not wanting to pretend to
be reporters ourselves, we can
certainly say that we. and every
one else who listened at that

meeting, certainly read Kennedy's
remarks as strongly supporting
the hard work of the task force
and the goals it sought to
achieve. Support by the officers of
the University is crucial because
it gets things moving; change is
only possible when people agree it
Is possible to change. It was news
when a year ago Kennedy said on
KZSU that Western Culture
should change; Is it not news
now, or has a different Daily edi
torial board merely changed the
parameters of the discussion?
There were two very profes
sional Daily staff members at that
meeting, one a former editor in
chief. We turned around and saw
neither of them taking a note
during Kennedy's talk on Western
Culture. This is unfortunate,
because as we all know there is
but one daily newspaper on
campus which could have covered
the remarks. So it goes.

Freshmen, undeclared
Americans are
more biased
than we know
I support Amanda Kemp in her
recent letter (Daily, April 28) for
her efforts to Inform the Stanford
community of how little we might
really understand our own biases.
I believe that It is a struggle to
really see these biases and that
we need to open our eyes for our
own education as well as for the
freedom of all our brothers and
sisters.
I am a Stanford graduate who.
for about one-fifth of my life, has
been involved in peace and race
and women's issues. Yet I am
beginning to realize only now.
after spending two-and-a-half
months in Nicaragua, how little I
really know about everything in
general, and about oppression of
people of color and the In
doctrination that goes on to sup
port those in power in the United
States in particular.
In Nicaragua, I realized how
very white and western-o-centric I
am; I was Inspired by the beauti
ful pride and brilliant creativity of
"even" the sometimes barely
literate campeslnos with whom I
worked and by how incredible
some of the gains their govern
ment has recently made against
all odds — in spite of the fact that
I believe myself to be much less
blind to what really exists in the
world than many around me. If
my eyes keep opening, how much
more I will see that I don't now
know.
If I choose to shut my eyes,
though. It could be easy In a soci
ety that values whiteness and
education not to see. for I have
both of these. And yet If I choose
not to see. how very lost and
uneducated and dangerous to the
rainbow I should be.

Asians for a grand total of 15
minority residents, the avenues
of cultural support and motiva
tion do not abound. Residential
Education, which could have
regulated the number of minority
students admitted to Cedro, ap
parently failed to check the
surnames of those who drew into
the dorm and assign minority
freshmen accordingly.
To make matters worse, close
examination of the Hispanic
contingent reveals an even more
startling fact: It turns out that
only three are Mestizo while the
other two are Creoles. What? You
mean there is a difference? My RF
didn't seem to think so. He was
surprised that I could feel cul
turally isolated since there were
quite a few students with
Hispanic surnames in the dorm.
What he and others fail to under
stand is that there is a glaring
difference. Creoles are American
born Spaniards and are (by and
large) white. Mestizos, on the
other hand, are a hybrid of
Spanish and Indian, resembling
in most cases the latter in skin
tone (brown). Furthermore, these
two ethnic groups have a history
of racial tension and strife not
unlike that between the blacks
and whites in the South.
Therefore, it should come as no
surprise that I received no sup
port from these individuals. In
fact, even one of the Mestizos, the
RA. helped about as much as the
Creoles. Now I can take a cold
shoulder from a white, black or
Asian, but when one of La Raza
shows no concern for the welfare
of one of his own, my heart is
torn. I am fortunate that God put
two Chicanos in my path who
helped by sharing their common
experiences with me.
I hope that in the future Res Ed
will be more responsible about
the distribution of ethnicity
among the different residences to
ensure cultural support for all
groups. Also. I hope that all Mes
tizos at Stanford who have stayed
away from El Centro Chicano and
Casa Zapata because of arrogance
and low esteem for their heritage
will benefit from my mistake and
realize that although there are

good people of all races, the only
group that will come through for
them during good times and bad
is La Raza Mestiza. I wish there
could be true assimilation and
more warmth extending beyond
racial and social classification,
but unfortunately theory and
dreams are opiates; reality is a
terrible disappointment.

Fun Friday is

Bravo! Allen Estes has done it

celebrate Fun Friday every year

that I'm not an engineer; I may

Remarks made
by Kennedy
were ignored
We were distressed that The
Daily chose not to cover some very
Important and timely remarks
made by University President
Donald Kennedy at last week's
ASSU Senate meeting in regard to
the draft proposals of the Task
Force on the Area One Require
ment. In contrast to the vast
majority of statements that have
appeared in The Dally — from
columns to editorials to news
quotes — the president's state
ments supported toleration for
the task force's draft proposal and
respect for the thought that went
into them. Perhaps this is why
the statement was not covered.
We agree with Kennedy that
most responses to this point have
been overreactions: Specifically,
the authors have missed the key
word in the proposal. That word
Is draft, and it means that the
task force's first report Is de
signed to elicit suggestions from
the community to help the group
prepare a final report. There is a
long way to go in the commu
nity's analysis of what must be
done with the Western Culture
program, and the only way to
assist the task force's work and
contribute to the positive change
that must come Is to offer well
reasoned arguments to them.
Working to make the report better
is a mature and viable option;
reactively attacking it and
seeking to discard it is not. We.
as a student body, have waited
too many years to let that happen
to the report.
While not wanting to pretend to
be reporters ourselves, we can
certainly say that we. and every
one else who listened at that

meeting, certainly read Kennedy's
remarks as strongly supporting
the hard work of the task force
and the goals it sought to
achieve. Support by the officers of
the University is crucial because
it gets things moving; change is
only possible when people agree it
Is possible to change. It was news
when a year ago Kennedy said on
KZSU that Western Culture
should change; Is it not news
now, or has a different Daily edi
torial board merely changed the
parameters of the discussion?
There were two very profes
sional Daily staff members at that
meeting, one a former editor in
chief. We turned around and saw
neither of them taking a note
during Kennedy's talk on Western
Culture. This is unfortunate,
because as we all know there is
but one daily newspaper on
campus which could have covered
the remarks. So it goes.

Freshmen, undeclared
Americans are
more biased
than we know
I support Amanda Kemp in her
recent letter (Daily, April 28) for
her efforts to Inform the Stanford
community of how little we might
really understand our own biases.
I believe that It is a struggle to
really see these biases and that
we need to open our eyes for our
own education as well as for the
freedom of all our brothers and
sisters.
I am a Stanford graduate who.
for about one-fifth of my life, has
been involved in peace and race
and women's issues. Yet I am
beginning to realize only now.
after spending two-and-a-half
months in Nicaragua, how little I
really know about everything in
general, and about oppression of
people of color and the In
doctrination that goes on to sup
port those in power in the United
States in particular.
In Nicaragua, I realized how
very white and western-o-centric I
am; I was Inspired by the beauti
ful pride and brilliant creativity of
"even" the sometimes barely
literate campeslnos with whom I
worked and by how incredible
some of the gains their govern
ment has recently made against
all odds — in spite of the fact that
I believe myself to be much less
blind to what really exists in the
world than many around me. If
my eyes keep opening, how much
more I will see that I don't now
know.
If I choose to shut my eyes,
though. It could be easy In a soci
ety that values whiteness and
education not to see. for I have
both of these. And yet If I choose
not to see. how very lost and
uneducated and dangerous to the
rainbow I should be.

Res Ed needs

How could I have been so
naive? I kept repeating this
phrase over and over again while I
was remembering how far I had
come since fall quarter. I used to
be one of those Chicanos who
thought Casa Zapata was simply
another obstacle in the way of
Mestizo assimilation into Ameri
can society. The seriousness of
this ignorant belief did not occur
to me until I became a troubled
Chicano with no place to turn.
What about my resident fellows,
the resident assistants and my
fellow residents?
Well, when you live in Cedro

Hispanics. three blacks and seven
