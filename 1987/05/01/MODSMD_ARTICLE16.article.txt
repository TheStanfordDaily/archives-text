# Sensitivity is necessary
## 
### 
Death is not an easy matter to deal with — for
anyone. When a young, friendly, funny and intelli
gent person such as Dave Dunshee dies, the hurting
is acute. For a newspaper, especially a college news
paper, death is not an easy subject to cover.

Since January, there have been three incidents of
death or near-death involving members of the Stan
ford community: the suicide of Allan Cox in January,
the attempted suicide of a Branner freshman in
February and the drowning of Dunshee last week. In
all of these cases, The Daily faced some difficult ques
tions on how to present the news to the public.
It seems that each incident brings its own set of
thorns. It is impossible to set a general policy on an
issue that is so emotional and sensitive; I hope to
give a glimpse, however, into how The Daily consid
ered each of the cases listed above.
With Dunshee's death. Daily photographers and
reporters arrived at Lagunita when the Santa Clara
County and Stanford Police where still searching for
the body. Since a police barricade had not yet been
set up, the photographers were able to move up close
to the water; close enough to get some rather graphic
pictures of the recovery.
A picture can often tell a story better than the story
that appears with it. However, in a case such as a
drowning, publishing explicit pictures would add
little to the reporting but upset a great number of
people. The Daily eventually decided on a picture
that showed the search before anything was found.
Friends of students and faculty who have died in
variably criticize The Daily for reporting the deaths
at all, especially if there are unpleasant circum
stances involved. Many people do not want to see
their friends' names associated with such acts. The
problem for The Daily is that the Stanford is large
enough that if The Daily did not report a death, it
could very well go unnoticed by a large majority of the
community. Yet. if The Daily does report on the inci
dent. the University is small enough that many will
know the subject.
There are two reasons why The Daily publishes ar
ticles when students die. The first reason is to in
form the community. Friends and people who know
the deceased have a right to know that they have lost
a friend, and The Daily has a duty to inform them.
The second reason has to do with rumors. In Dun
shee's case, for example, by late Friday night, most
people on campus new about the tragedy, although
many had heard different facts. Even without news
paper coverage, rumors of death circulate quickly.
The Daily has the responsibility to provide the com
munity with factual information. In Dunshee's case.
The Daily provided a valuable service by printing the

facts after a weekend of rumors.
Many times, criticism focuses on the extent of
coverage. For example, the day that Dean of the
School of Earth Sciences Allan Cox died, The Daily
ran a simple obituary. However, within a few days, it
was revealed that Cox had committed suicide
(although some still dispute this) and had possibly
done so because of his involvement with a neighbor's
son.
Quite a few people complained that the charges
against Cox were spurious and that since he was
dead, Cox had no chance of vindicating himself.
These are valid concerns. However, Cox was a public
figure, and much serious new information came to
light after his death. The Daily had an obligation to
print it.
Perhaps the most difficult questions involve at
tempted suicides.
Earlier this year, a Branner freshman tried to com
mit suicide by ingesting sodium cyanide crystals.
The Daily covered the incident, upsetting some
members of the community in general and Branner
in particular.
Some argue that since suicide attempts affect no
one but the individuals involved, they should not be
reported to the public at large. However, it is too easy
to look at suicides as isolated events. Dr. Vincent
D Andrea, associate director of Counseling and Psy
chological Services, told The Daily in February that
there are about 55 students who are seriously con
sidering suicide at any one time on campus. He also
said there is an average of 1.2 successful suicides per
year among Stanford students.
Suicide, or at least the psychological problems that
lead up to it. is an important issue that must be ad
dressed. Individual suicides or suicide attempts may
affect only a small group of people, but their implica
tions affect the whole community.
Suicide springs from deep-seated psychological de
pression. And although coverage of such events has
important ramifications for the community as a
whole, there is also the concern that The Daily, in in
forming the public, will impede the recovery of the
victim by making it impossible for him to return to a
normal existence.
The problem boils down to a single question. Do
you print the names of those who try to kill them
selves? In the Branner case, The Daily decided not to
print the name. In that way. it was felt that an impor
tant issue could be presented to the community with
the minimum amount of harm to the particular indi
vidual.
For one thing, most suicides or suicide attempts
on campus every year go unreported. Most cases are
known only to the dormitory staff and residents.
Only occasionally does The Daily receive word that a
student has or has tried to kill himself.
Death is a difficult topic for a newspaper; editors
must balance the need — indeed, the duty — to in
form the community with a sensitivity and sympathy
for the individuals involved. It is not always an easy
balance to strike.
