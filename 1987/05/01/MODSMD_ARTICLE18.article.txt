# Tracks must implement suggestions

### 
On the eve of its Centennial, a Stanford task force has fi
nally made a commitment to bring the curriculum into the
20th century. The Western Culture Task Force report is a
long, long overdue acknowledgement that Stanford's aca
demic offerings are dangerously anachronistic.
I was part of a group — the BSU's African History — that
raised this argument in 1983. We wrote at that time that
the mutual study of one's own and other cultures is the
first step toward eliminating the misunderstanding be
tween cultures that spawns racism" (C.R., April 20. 1983).

Four years later, we have won the intellectual battle. We
have not, however, reached the end of the journey. In fact,
we are far from it. While conceding the intellectual point,
the task force report does not go far enough in its recom
mendations to remedy the problem. The sum total of the
report remains intellectually inconsistent.
While acknowledging the importance of developing an
appreciation for the diversity of cultures that comprise
America, the recommendations fail to call for actual study
of those cultures themselves. Instead, they limit themselves
to study of the parent societies for the multiplicity of
cultures that make up the rainbow that is America. At last,
someone has recognized that one cannot understand
African-Americans without an appreciation of African his
tory. But studying Africa alone is insufficient.
We are not Africans, but descendants of Africa who have
evolved a distinct — though related — culture in this
country. The dynamic of oppression, resistance and strid
ing toward freedom that make up the black American
drama must all be understood to really be equipped to live
in a multicultural society. Similarly, Chicanos and Asian-
Americans have distinct historical and cultural experi
ences that must be studied in their own right.
Which brings me to the reason why this study is so im
portant. The experience of America's people of color has
been one of oppression and resistance. Failure to under
stand the attempted genocide of the native Americans, the
betrayal of Reconstruction, the annexation of the South
west and the Chinese Exclusion Act means one is culturally
illiterate and ill-equipped to participate in a diverse society.
It is ignorance of the history of people of color that leads to
the attitude that we don't belong here. Such attitudes, bred
of ignorance, are the gunpowder for explosions such as the
ones at Howard Beach, Forsyth County and the University
of Michigan at Ann Arbor.
In short, students need to understand that racism is as

American as apple pie. baseball and A 1 Campanis.
Critics of the task force contend that there are no teach
ers to teach what is suggested. With all due respect, that is
perhaps one of the most pathetic and inexcusable argu
ments I have ever heard. Do you really mean to tell me as a
black American that I am supposed to pay • 18,000 to come
to what is supposedly the best school in the country, and
yet there is nobody here to teach my history and culture?
Shouldn't 1 then be entitled to a refund of my money?
Perhaps Stanford should stop playing word games and
call — pardon the expression — a spade a spade. If this Uni
versity is truly incapable of teaching the history and cul
ture of minorities, the working class and women (who. by
the way. comprise a majority of this country), it should ad
mit that its purpose is to educate rich, white men about
their culture, heritage and how to maintain a society that
has produced this sad state of affairs.
A large part of the reason that we originally fought to
change the program was that we thought that the people
whose heritage is covered in the program are the very
people who most need to understand that this is not a
white country.
This reality has been painfully illustrated by the response
to the task force's report. Let's be blunt. Every published
critic to date of the Area One Task Force's recommen
dations is a white male. I am not attacking white males
(some of my best friends are white males). Rather, I am
trying to show that the academic curriculum represents a
relic of a bygone era when it was assumed that white men
were more qualified and intelligent. Today we know better
— although the comments and columns in The Daily cause
me to wonder.
It is truly pitiful that a university that aspires to great
ness would allow itself to be dragged down for 100 years by
racial arrogance, intellectual myopia and racist disregard
for the ideas, culture and history of the majority of the
world.
For activists, there are two important lessons to learn
from this struggle. First, it takes masses and public pres
sure to get changes at this university. I have served on the
University's Western Culture Program Commitee and I have
also led demonstrations and rallies outside the president's
office. The tactics that were most effective were those that
put the most pressure on those who make the decisions.
Isn't it a law of physics that objects at rest tend to remain at
rest? The status quo is securely resting and will not be dis
lodged solely by polite petitions and behind-closed-door
meetings. The storm of haughty criticism that has accom
panied the release of the report proves that point. Change
only comes to the extent that refusal to change is more un
comfortable for those in power.

The second lesson is that the race will go not to the
strong or the swift, but to those that hold on. The Univer
sity's main strategy for dealing with protests and petitions
for change is to set up a committee and wait until you
graduate, forget or get tired of the struggle. In 1983. I first
got involved in this effort, and its genesis dates back to the
conception of the program in 1981. At every point along the
way. University administrators have tried to retreat from
their commitment to changing the program whenever we
turned our backs. My advice: Don't ever turn your back and
keep fighting for a more democratic university, so that the
students have a say in the development of the decisions.
Never forget that it was students, led by the BSU, who
fought for changes in the program.
The University acts like a force for social progress and an
agent for an enlightened society only to the degree that stu
dents have a say in the process. Stanford did not let people
of color in here of its own volition; it did not begin review
ing its investment policies of its own initiative; and it did
not hire faculty of color of its own initiative. Yet. today, all
agree that these were enlightened and humane courses of
action. One would think that eventually they would get the
hint and give students an actual voice in the decision
making process. In most places, that's called democracy.
But. as an educated person. I know that they will not grant
democracy of their own volition. It must be demanded by
the students.
It is not too late to salvage the report. It's basic premise is
correct. The mission of a university is to teach its students
to understand and appreciate the world in which they live.
To do that, they must actually study the world in its con
temporary form. One road to that goal is to revamp the oft
ridiculed non-Western culture requirement. Rather than
tossing in the majority of the world as an afterthought, the
requirement could mandate the coverage of people of color
in America. That would complement the historical knowl
edge gained in the new Area One requirement by complet
ing the picture with knowledge about what has happened
to people from the Third World as they developed and
struggled in this country.
Stanford should not shirk from the challenge of provid
ing multicultural education. Weeks away from a major
celebration of the first 100 years, what better way for a
great university to celebrate its birthday than to show that
it has the courage and maturity to admit its shortcomings
and lead the way into a second century that will see demo
graphic changes making this state a "majority minority"
state. It only makes sense that our education should
prepare us to live in and meet the needs of that society.

We are not Africans, but descendants of Africa who have
evolved a distinct — though related — culture in this
country. The dynamic of oppression, resistance and strid
ing toward freedom that make up the black American
drama must all be understood to really be equipped to live
in a multicultural society. Similarly, Chicanos and Asian-
Americans have distinct historical and cultural experi
ences that must be studied in their own right.
Which brings me to the reason why this study is so im
portant. The experience of America's people of color has
been one of oppression and resistance. Failure to under
stand the attempted genocide of the native Americans, the
betrayal of Reconstruction, the annexation of the South
west and the Chinese Exclusion Act means one is culturally
illiterate and ill-equipped to participate in a diverse society.
It is ignorance of the history of people of color that leads to
the attitude that we don't belong here. Such attitudes, bred
of ignorance, are the gunpowder for explosions such as the
ones at Howard Beach, Forsyth County and the University
of Michigan at Ann Arbor.
In short, students need to understand that racism is as

American as apple pie. baseball and A 1 Campanis.
Critics of the task force contend that there are no teach
ers to teach what is suggested. With all due respect, that is
perhaps one of the most pathetic and inexcusable argu
ments I have ever heard. Do you really mean to tell me as a
black American that I am supposed to pay • 18,000 to come
to what is supposedly the best school in the country, and
yet there is nobody here to teach my history and culture?
Shouldn't 1 then be entitled to a refund of my money?
Perhaps Stanford should stop playing word games and
call — pardon the expression — a spade a spade. If this Uni
versity is truly incapable of teaching the history and cul
ture of minorities, the working class and women (who. by
the way. comprise a majority of this country), it should ad
mit that its purpose is to educate rich, white men about
their culture, heritage and how to maintain a society that
has produced this sad state of affairs.
A large part of the reason that we originally fought to
change the program was that we thought that the people
whose heritage is covered in the program are the very
people who most need to understand that this is not a
white country.
This reality has been painfully illustrated by the response
to the task force's report. Let's be blunt. Every published
critic to date of the Area One Task Force's recommen
dations is a white male. I am not attacking white males
(some of my best friends are white males). Rather, I am
trying to show that the academic curriculum represents a
relic of a bygone era when it was assumed that white men
were more qualified and intelligent. Today we know better
— although the comments and columns in The Daily cause
me to wonder.
It is truly pitiful that a university that aspires to great
ness would allow itself to be dragged down for 100 years by
racial arrogance, intellectual myopia and racist disregard
for the ideas, culture and history of the majority of the
world.
For activists, there are two important lessons to learn
from this struggle. First, it takes masses and public pres
sure to get changes at this university. I have served on the
University's Western Culture Program Commitee and I have
also led demonstrations and rallies outside the president's
office. The tactics that were most effective were those that
put the most pressure on those who make the decisions.
Isn't it a law of physics that objects at rest tend to remain at
rest? The status quo is securely resting and will not be dis
lodged solely by polite petitions and behind-closed-door
meetings. The storm of haughty criticism that has accom
panied the release of the report proves that point. Change
only comes to the extent that refusal to change is more un
comfortable for those in power.

The second lesson is that the race will go not to the
strong or the swift, but to those that hold on. The Univer
sity's main strategy for dealing with protests and petitions
for change is to set up a committee and wait until you
graduate, forget or get tired of the struggle. In 1983. I first
got involved in this effort, and its genesis dates back to the
conception of the program in 1981. At every point along the
way. University administrators have tried to retreat from
their commitment to changing the program whenever we
turned our backs. My advice: Don't ever turn your back and
keep fighting for a more democratic university, so that the
students have a say in the development of the decisions.
Never forget that it was students, led by the BSU, who
fought for changes in the program.
The University acts like a force for social progress and an
agent for an enlightened society only to the degree that stu
dents have a say in the process. Stanford did not let people
of color in here of its own volition; it did not begin review
ing its investment policies of its own initiative; and it did
not hire faculty of color of its own initiative. Yet. today, all
agree that these were enlightened and humane courses of
action. One would think that eventually they would get the
hint and give students an actual voice in the decision
making process. In most places, that's called democracy.
But. as an educated person. I know that they will not grant
democracy of their own volition. It must be demanded by
the students.
It is not too late to salvage the report. It's basic premise is
correct. The mission of a university is to teach its students
to understand and appreciate the world in which they live.
To do that, they must actually study the world in its con
temporary form. One road to that goal is to revamp the oft
ridiculed non-Western culture requirement. Rather than
tossing in the majority of the world as an afterthought, the
requirement could mandate the coverage of people of color
in America. That would complement the historical knowl
edge gained in the new Area One requirement by complet
ing the picture with knowledge about what has happened
to people from the Third World as they developed and
struggled in this country.
Stanford should not shirk from the challenge of provid
ing multicultural education. Weeks away from a major
celebration of the first 100 years, what better way for a
great university to celebrate its birthday than to show that
it has the courage and maturity to admit its shortcomings
and lead the way into a second century that will see demo
graphic changes making this state a "majority minority"
state. It only makes sense that our education should
prepare us to live in and meet the needs of that society.

On the eve of its Centennial, a Stanford task force has fi
nally made a commitment to bring the curriculum into the
20th century. The Western Culture Task Force report is a
long, long overdue acknowledgement that Stanford's aca
demic offerings are dangerously anachronistic.
I was part of a group — the BSU's African History — that
raised this argument in 1983. We wrote at that time that
the mutual study of one's own and other cultures is the
first step toward eliminating the misunderstanding be
tween cultures that spawns racism" (C.R., April 20. 1983).

Four years later, we have won the intellectual battle. We
have not, however, reached the end of the journey. In fact,
we are far from it. While conceding the intellectual point,
the task force report does not go far enough in its recom
mendations to remedy the problem. The sum total of the
report remains intellectually inconsistent.
While acknowledging the importance of developing an
appreciation for the diversity of cultures that comprise
America, the recommendations fail to call for actual study
of those cultures themselves. Instead, they limit themselves
to study of the parent societies for the multiplicity of
cultures that make up the rainbow that is America. At last,
someone has recognized that one cannot understand
African-Americans without an appreciation of African his
tory. But studying Africa alone is insufficient.
