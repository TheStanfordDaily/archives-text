Stanford, is a
liberal fort
The Stanford community is to
be congratulated on its success at
driving away the threat to its
image, the Reagan Library.
Of course, it wasn't just the
library' that went south. We can
also wave bye-bye to any last
pretensions that the Farm either
understands or tolerates aca
demic freedom or objective schol
arship.
Now mai stanioru s creuenuais
as a bastion of advocacy have
been entrenched, it can abandon
the sham of masquerading as an
educational institution and come
out honestly as a trade school for
liberals â€” its degrees testifying
that the recipients have proven
their political reliability.

A vision of
refreshment
The appearance of the campus
has been greatly improved in
recent years by the greening of
the Oval and the bricking of the
Inner Quad courtyard. Night
lighting in many areas is quite
dramatic, but there is nothing
that compares with the western
approach to Meyer Library. There,
a scowling Rodin statue turns his
back on a brightly lit Pepsi ma
chine shining forth in red, white
and blue splendor from the locked
and darkened lobby. It is a vision
of unattainable refreshment.
