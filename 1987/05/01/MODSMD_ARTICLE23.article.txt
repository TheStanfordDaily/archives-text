## Rudolfo's Ristorante: A 						bit of Italy on El Camino 
### 
Rudolfo's Ristorante
4020 El Camino
Palo Alto
This 32-year-old family-owned
and operated restaurant reflects
the best elements in casual Italian
dining. Its mural, red lighting,
outside tables and checkered
tablecloths combine to create the
impression of a pleasant Italian
cafe.
Now that spring has arrived
(hopefully for good), the picnic
style outside tables are well worth
a try. Although the scenic view of

El Camino is easily topped, this
outdoor experience Is still quite
pleasant. After all, it has been
satisfactory for decades of diners,
including the likes of Blng Crosby
and astronaut Ed Mitchell.
The cooking area is visible to all
the diners inside, and watching
the preparation of the food pro
vides some unusual dinner enter
tainment.
Known for both its sit-down
dining and take-out, Rudolfo's cel
ebrated pizzas are made from a
recipe that has been in the family
for over 100 years and was

brought from Naples to California
in 1936.
Rudolfo's also supplies a tradi
tional supper menu that's certain
to please. The service Is so quick
that the entrees are often served
before the appetizers are finished.
Our soup and salad, provided
with most entrees, were perfect
examples of homemade dishes.
The minestrone was served in a
large bowl and contained
generous slices of carrots, onions
and celery in a rich broth. The
salad was just as large and was
garnished with beets, tomatoes,
pepperoni and red beans.
Generous portions of linguinl
with clams — my selection — and
lasagne — my guest's — soon
arrived. Each dish contained
easily enough food for more than
one diner.
The linguinl with white clam
sauce proved to be delicious. The
sauce was piping hot, the clams
were tender and juicy, and the
spices added just enough bite to
the dish.
The incredibly fresh lasagne
was an excellent traditional dish,
sure to please any palate. It was
thick, cheesy and incredibly rich.
The garlic bread and Chantl
Classico La Ripa '83 that we chose
to accompany our meal added
substantially to our enjoyment.
The bread had only a hint of garlic
and herbs. The wine was a light,
dry Italian red that suited the lin
guinl and lasagne equally well.
Our dessert choice was the
chocolate Kahlua cake. The cake
was light and fluffy and prepared
with generous amounts of Kah
lua. It was dressed with layers of
rich chocolate icing and cream.
Any dinner selection will un
doubtedly leave the average
restaurant-goer with a sizable por
tion of leftovers and the Chinese
style take-out containers supplied
upon request seldom go unused.
However, if for some reason the
entree and appetizer supplied are
not enough, owner Art Alfinlto
recommends the broccoli or
Sicilian salads for fillers. Ciao!
