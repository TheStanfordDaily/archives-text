### 
How many projects do you consult on for Stan
ford?
I am the oil and gas adviser to the Board of Trus
tees. We have hundreds of projects now, as Stan
ford has tremendous acreage.
What activities were you Involved in in your
Stanford undergraduate years?
I was chairman of the Men's council, on the Axe
Committee and an RA at Encina Commons, the
freshman men's hall. I also organized an intra
mural basketball team of intellectuals. We were
beaten by the Phi Delts, 102-3.
If you could go back in your life, what would you
change?
Selling my wife's Buick — she never forgave me!
Also, I wouldn't have tried to become an indepen
dent oil producer, as I tried In Half Moon Bay in
1983 and lost my shirt.
What other academic area would you like to be
involved with?
World peace studies is important and I don't
mean arms control. I want to see better under
standing among people.
Do you ever get tired of teaching P.E. 103?
No, my only worry is whether I'm doing the right
thing in my teaching. My business changes every
day, so it stays interesting.

What is yourfavorite kind of ethnic food?
How about if I said Kansas?! Mexican, but not
too hot.
Are you for divestment in South Africa?
Absolutely not. I think a non-violent path using
influence through the American corporate entity
and American government policy is a better route
than a violent bloody revolution with the
withdrawal of American companies.
When you graduated from Stanford, where did
you see yourself career-wise in 10 years?
Without a doubt I saw myself in the oil busi
ness.
What period of your life do you remember most
fondly?
I guess it was when (I was) shooting rabbits to
stay alive when Dad drilled his sixth dry hole.
Which is more fulfilling, teaching or your private
work?
They are complementary, especially because
most of my consulting now is for the University.
What is a great Joy in your life?
Having a low golf score — and students. I really
love the students.
