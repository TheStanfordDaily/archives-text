## Do or die for defending NCAA champs Card men need victory to boost chance for berth 
### JON WEISMAN Staff writer 
When It faces California at 1:30
p.m. today at Stanford Tennis
Stadium, the Stanford men's ten
nis team will know it is ending the
regular season. At the same time,
the squad is counting on the
match being the beginning of an
other season.
Stanford stands a good chance
of gaining the 20th and final
NCAA championship berth to
defend its national title May 16 at
Athens, Ga. if it can defeat the
13th-ranked Bears for the first
time in three tries this year. A
loss, according to Stanford Coach
Dick Gould, would leave the Card
inal only a " 100 to one shot.
"It's a significant match for us,
that's all there is to it," Gould
said. "The way I look at it. it's a
chance to get in the nationals as
the 20th team. If we beat Cal, we
will practice next week as if we
were going. Other than national
championship matches, it's prob
ably one of the biggest matches of
my 21 years at Stanford."
NCAA tournament bids are
awarded to the top teams in eight
regions, followed by at-large bids
to the nation's next best 12 teams.
Stanford's chances look to be
about as borderline as they can
get — the Cardinal is currently in
a three-way tie with Southwestern
Louisiana and Alabama for 19th
place in the latest poll.
Further complicating matters is
the fact that bids must go to at
least two teams that may end the

season out. of the top-20: Colum
bia University In the Eastern
region, and either Brlgham Young
or Utah In the Inner-Mountain
region. Top-ranked USC has
already cinched the Western
regional birth.
These factors are definitely on
the Stanford players' minds as
they take on the Bears, who upset
No. 3 UCLA two weekends ago
before losing two close matches to
USC and No. 8 Pepperdlne.
"Student support for this match
might make a big difference over
whether we make nationals or
not," Gould said. "I'm serious — I
can't overemphasize that."
Cal boasts three of the nation's
top-100 players in No. 6 Steve
DeVrles, No. 12 Woody Hunt and
No. 71 Kurt Streeter. (Streeter will
be playing Stanford's Jeff Tarango
Tuesday in Berkeley for the NorCal
Intercollegiate singles title.)
"I think we're capable of win
ning at any of the positions,"
newly crowned Pacific 10 Confer
ence champion Patrick McEnroe
said. "I don't like playing up (in
Berkeley) that much. It's kind of a
hard place to go in and play. I
think we have a real advantage
playing here."
Singles is where the Cardinal
hopes to build up a lead, because
Cal is the only team in the country
with two doubles teams among
the nation's top 10: DeVrles and
Ted Scherman at No. 5, and Brian
Flowers and Hunt a notch below
them.


Veterans Scott Moody and Patrick McEnroe will lead Stanford into its
most important match of the year this afternoon. The Cardinal hosts

California, and a loss to the Bears would almost certainly doom Stan
ford's chances for a berth in the national championships.
