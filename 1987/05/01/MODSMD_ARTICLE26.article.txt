# Men look to stop 16-year losing streak
## Stanford track team shoots to end California domination at Big Meet 
### ERIK STEN Editorial staff 
Unless you're cooling your heels
on death row, or maybe expecting
an I.R.S. audit, 16 years can be an
awfully long time to wait.
Well, it's been 16 years since the
Stanford men's track team beat
the California Golden Bears in the
Big Meet. Tomorrow at Stanford
Stadium. Coach Brooks Johnson
and his troops are hoping the wait
will end.
For the first time in about a de
cade. the Cardinal matches up
well with the perennially strong
Bears, and although Cal is still the
favorite to win. an upset is a real
possibility.
Earlier in the week, someone
burned the word "Cal" into the
grass field surrounded by the
stadium track. Instead of getting
too upset about the incident,
Johnson is hoping the prank may
backfire in the vandals' faces. The
coach thinks that the constant
reminder provided by the mark
may be just the motivation the

team needs.
"We will respond in every posi
tive way to that kind of transgres
sion." Johnson said. "They (the
Bears) may find themselves in the
midst of guerilla warfare."
Johnson probably refers to his
team's tactics as "guerilla warfare"
because in order to beat Cal, the
Cardinal will have to grab as many
points as possible in a variety of
events. A second place here and a
third place there could potentially
make the difference,
"If they make a mistake or take
us too lightly, they could be in for
a big suprise," Johnson said.
In the women's meet, the series
has been a lot closer. Two years
ago, Stanford won the Big Meet;
last year at Berkeley, the Bears en
gineered a seven-point victory. To
morrow's outcome is anyone's
guess. What could have been po
tentially an easy Stanford win has,
because of injuries to three dis
tance runners, become a meet
that's hard to call.
Instead of potental sweeps in
the distance races, usually Stan-

strength, the team will "tti*-
looking for just first place, as only
freshman Carol Gray, an All-
America cross country selection,
will be entered. Gray will be
pushed by the Bears' Marilyn
Davis in the 1,500 meters and
Kristin O'Hara in the 3,000. A vic
tory in those races could do a lot to
further the Cardinal's hopes.
Highlight events in what looks
to be a meet full of good matchups
will probably be the men's 1,500
and the women's discus. In the
discus. Cardinal sophomore Patty
Purpur. one of the nation's best,
will run into Cal's Kim Kesler. Pur
pur has a season best of 169 feet,
10 inches, and a lifetime mark of
177-7. So far this year. Kepler has
thrown 178-10.
In the 1,500. Stanford's Marc
Olesen will battle the Bear's David
Ottaway. Joining the duo In the
race will be a number of strong
runners from each squad. With
such a deep field, either team
could sweep the event.
Other key events will be the
men's 800 — in which Stanford's

' Christian Skoog, who has -a
season best of 1:49.41, will meet
Ottaway, who has run 1:50.3 —
and the women's 400 hurdles, in
which Cardinal team captain Pam
Board will run against Cal's
Roberta Eccles. Both athletes are
sub-60-second hurdlers.
The only negative development
this week for Stanford has been
that the Cardinal will be without
the services of Henry Green and
Gus Envela, two athletes expected
to score against Cal. Green, a
long- and triple-jumper, will be ab
sent because of knee problems:
Envela, a sprinter and anchor of
both the 400 and mile relays, will
be out due to a nagging hamstring
pull.
Field events are scheduled to
begin at 11 a.m. with the ham
mer; running events will to follow
at 1 p.m. In an effort to make the
meet more exciting for the fans,
the Cardinal coaches have had the
fences surrounding the track
taken down, a move designed to
make the audience feel closer to
the action.
