round of the Pacific 10 Conference
championships In Tuscon. Ariz.,
to vault into fifth place Individu
ally and lead Stanford to a third
place finish In the team competi
tion.
On the basis of her conference
low season scoring average.
McCarthy was named the No. 1
player on the 1986-87 All-Pac-10
team in a ceremony follwing the
event.
"Three of the four rounds were
representative of Kathleen," Stan
ford Coach Tim Baldwin said.
"The 78 in the third round was
not. She got into some trouble on
one particular hole and didn't putt
like Kathleen."
The Cardinal shot 306 over the
final 18 holes to finish at 1,123
and edge out Arizona bv a single
stroke. The Wildcats shot 306 for
a three-day total of 1,124. Arizona
State carded a scintillating 298 to
win the tournament at 1,197,
three shots better than second-
place USC. which posted a final
round 301.
'ASU and USC in my opinion
are the top two teams in the
country. They fought it out neck
and neck. They both have tremen
dous depth." Baldwin said.
"We were looking at them all at
the end of 36 holes (Tuesday).
I Wednesday) in the third round
there was no wind and the course
was playing easy. It caught us
napping, and that's when they
made their move."
Cardinal junior Kay Cornelius
stood in fifth place entering the
final round of play, just three
shots off the lead. After three con
secutive even-par 75s on the
6.300-yard Oro Valley Country
Club course, she dropped to a 77
yesterday to wind up ninth at 301,
a stroke behind Arizona's Kathryn
Imrie.
"Kay played a very consistent
tournament. She was in position
to win the Pac-10 championship
and just didn't play today as well
as she possibly could," Baldwin
said.
ASU's Danielle Ammaccapane.
two strokes behind leader Kim
Saiki of USC. shot a 5-under par
70 to finish at 294 and capture
the individual title by two strokes.
USC's Tracy Nakamura. tied with
Ammaccapane entering the final
round, finished second with a 72
tor a 296 total. Saiki slipped to a
75 to finish another stroke back
in third, while UCLA's Krystal
Parker shot 71 to beat McCarthy
by one shot at 298.

Ammaccapane was the No. 2
player selected to All-Pac 10 team.
ASU's Pam Wright, who finished
with a 77 and carded 300. a shot
behind McCarthy, was third.
Baldwin said that he was "very
happy with our finish. We beat
two very good teams in Arizona
and UCLA. The girls are confident
going into the NCAA (champ
ionships) Our goal this year is not
to finish in the top 10 or top live,
but to win the NCAA champion
ship. That's what we're striving
for."
The rest of the Stanford scores
included sophomore Clare Dolan's
79 for a 313 total, junior Trish
McGonigle's 81 and 314 total, and
senior Adrienne Gilmartin's 79 for
a 317.
"1 was really proud of Trish. She
played the whole tournament with
a sprained ankle. She had to use a
pull cart and limped around the
course. It was all swollen. She was
real gutsy." Baldwin said.
The Cardinal has qualified for
the NCAA championships May 27
to 30 as the team with the ninth
best scoring average. ASU. not
surprisingly, is the top team in
the country, with the Oklahoma
State at No. 2 and San Jose State
third. The rest of the 112 ield is fairly
set: Florida is fourth, Furman
fifth. Miami sixth, USC seventh.
New Mexico eighth, Texas 10th,
U.S. International University —
led by the nation's top collegian,
Laurette Maritz — 11th, Arizona
12th, UCLA 13th and Indiana
14th. These teams, barring large
moves by other teams that still
have other tournaments left, will
make up the 14 that will vie for the
NCAA title at the end <>112 the
month.
