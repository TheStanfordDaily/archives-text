# Women netters finish season against Bears
## 
### KEN STEVENS Senior staff writer 
Take two of the hottest teams in the country,
throw in a cross-Bay rivalry, and the result is what
should be a tremendous finale to the 1987 collegiate
women's tennis regular season.
Stanford. 18-3 overall, and California. 22-3. meet
at Berkeley today at 1 p.m. Both teams are looking to
continue the pace that has seen them go undefeated
over the last month of play. "It would be nice to con
tinue our winning streak and go in (to the NCAA
championships) with a full head of steam." Stanford
Coach Frank Brennan said.
Knowing that they might be pitted against Cal in
the NCAA team tournament. Brennan and the Card
inal players also have other reasons for wanting to
win today's match. "It's nice not to be down 2-0
against a team you might have to face." he said.
The prospect of being swept in the season series by
the Bears is an altogether new notion for the Card
inal. Up until this season. Cal had never defeated
Stanford, let alone sweep the series. But on March 4
at the Stanford Tennis Stadium, the Bears took two
of the three doubles matches to record a 5-4 victory.
And Cal has proven to be no fluke. Last weekend at
the Pacific 10 Conference Championships In OJai.
the Bears placed four players in the singles quarter
finals.
California fields a lineup with depth that matches
any other team in the country. Alissa Finerman. who
played No. 4 singles in the match at Stanford, ad
vanced to the finals of the Pac-10 singles, and
Caroline Scherman. the Bears No. 5 player, was a
quarterfinalist.

The Cardinal dropped the bottom three singles
matches in its loss to Cal, but since then Stanford's
depth has been strengthened by the Improved play of
sophomore Cindy Buchsbaum and the return from
injuries of senior Leigh Anne Eldredge and sopho
more Eleni Rossides.
Rossides, who won a key three-set singles match
against U.S. International University Wednesday, is
scheduled to play today. "I'm planning on her
playing." Brennan said. "She feels fine."
Senior Patty Fendick, who ran her 1987 record to
28-0 with a victory Wednesday, will be up against
Cal's Karen Shin today. Fendick has dominated Shin
recently, beating her 6-0. 6-0 in last year's NCAA in
dividual tournament and losing just one game
against her in their previous match this season.
Senior Stephanie Savides and freshman Lisa
Green also won their singles matches against the
Bears in March, but both have dropped their last two
matches. Savides. the Cardinal's No. 2 player, had
trouble at the end of last season, but Brennan does
not believe she will suffer the same fate this time
around.
"I think Stephanie's problem right now is realizing
we need her to win." Brennan said. "She's a very
good pressure player. We Just have to let her know
this is a tough match."
Brennan indicated that Green's drop-off has been
a result of illness and fatigue. "Lisa's had a tough
week," he said. "I'm not concerned about her. She
has had a good year. She's just been a little sick and a
little tired."
Junior Kay Tittle, who came up with a fever a day
before the match against Cal earlier this season and

line today against California's Karen Shin.
was forced to sit it out, has been
hot in a different way recently.
Tittle. 17-4 overall, was a Pac-IO
singles quarterfinalist, narrowly
losing in a third-set tiebreaker to
eventual champion Jane Thomas
of UCLA.
Tittle will be in her customary
No. 4 singles spot today. The last
time the teams met. junior Cari

Hagey played No. 4 for the Card
inal and was upended by Finer
man in a three-set duel that was
critical to the outcome of the team
match. Hagey, however, has
missed Stanford's last five
matches with a knee injury and
will be out of commission again
today.
After resting tomorrow after
noon, the Bears and Cardinal will
square off again tomorrow at 6:30
p.m. at Maples Pavilion in the
traditional mixed indoor tourna
ment.
