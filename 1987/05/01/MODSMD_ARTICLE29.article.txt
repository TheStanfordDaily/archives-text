# A 						vacation from Pac-10: Card tussles with Broncos
## 
### JOHN LIS Editorial staff 
After a stretch of six consecutive
series in the Pacific 10 Southern
Division dating back to mid-
March, Stanford will finally get a
weekend off. The Six-Pac
scheduler has allowed the Card
inal a break before next weekend's
four-game series with California.
The Cardinal has responded by
scheduling three straight non
conference games starting Sun
day at Sunken Diamond at 1 p.m.
against Santa Clara. Stanford
then hosts Sacramento State
Monday and travels to St. Mary's
Tuesday, before opening the Cal
series Thursday in Berkeley.
The Broncos have to be wonder
ing who is the sadist who slated
them to face the Cardinal five
times this season. Stanford has
won all of the first four meetings
and has a five-game winning
streak dating back to last season.
The most recent Bronco
busting was Wednesday, when Ed
Sprague cracked two homers and
Toi Cook went 4-for-5 with a
grand slam in leading the Card

inal to a 21-7 triumph. Stanford
scored in each of the first seven in
nings. while Lee Plemel and Brian
Keyser combined to allow the
Broncos just one earned run.
Things don't look to get any
easier for Santa Clara, as Jack
McDowell is expected to start for
the Cardinal. McDowell, however,
has had his problems of late, win
ning only one of his last four deci
sions as his record has fallen to 6-
4.
"They're usually pretty tough on
us." Stanford Coach Mark
Marquess said of the Broncos.
"We've had some close games with
them earlier in the year. We really
haven't dominated these guys."
After the three-game non
conference stretch, the four-game
series with Cal will alternate sites,
with the games Friday and Sun
day at Sunken Diamond. Stanford
hosts USC the following weekend
to close out the Six-Pac season.
With seven games left, five at
home, the Cardinal enjoys a 1 1/2-
game lead over UCLA in the Six-
Pac. Stanford is 16-7, while UCLA
is 15-9. The Bruins are at Arizona
this weekend for a three-game set,

then close out the season with a
three games with USC the follow
ing weekend. A May 10 meeting at
Jackie Robinson field with the
Trojans Is the only Bruin home
game remaining.
Stanford's magic number — the
number of Stanford wins and
UCLA losses that will give the
Cardinal Its fourth Six-Pac pen
nant in the last five years —
stands at six.
Playing five games at home will
also give a big edge to Stanford.
The Cardinal is 9-1 in Six-Pac
games at Sunken Diamond.
Card notes
Stanford was ranked sixth this week
in both the ESPN/Collegiate Baseball
and the Baseball America polls. Texas,
at 49-8, is No. 1 in both polls. In the
ESPN poll. UCLA is No. 11 and Arizona
State No. 24, while the Bruins are No.
7 and the Sun Devils unranked by
Baseball America.
Wednesday's win was only the
second for Stanford when the oppon
ent has scored seven runs or more.
Stanford is 2-10 when that happens,
33-4 when its pitchers hold the oppo
sition to six runs or less.
