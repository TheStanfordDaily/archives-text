# Land use plan developing
## 
### JOHN POLLACK Senior staff writer 
The Stanford foothills are the subject of a new
regional land use plan now under development in the
University Planning Office.
"The purpose of the plan is not to encourage devel
opment, but to provide a means for making deci
sions in the future, so that we can use the land
wisely and preserve the open-land characteristic
which we all love," said Tom Richman, a campus
planner in the Planning Office.
The plan will include a detailed description and
analysis of the area's topography, vegetation and
wildlife.
Currently, the only major building project planned
for the foothills region is the Westin Hotel scheduled
for construction at the intersection of Interstate 280
and Page Mill Road. Richman said the University is
merely thinking ahead.
The foothills plan, which is currently in draft form,
will be submitted for review next week to the Univer

sity Committee on Land and Building Development,
according to Judy Chan, associate director of the
Planning Office. The plan will then be reviewed by
the long-term land use group within the Planning Of
fice. Eventually, the plan will be released to the
public.
While acknowledging the foothills' significant
recreational value to the Stanford community, Rich
man emphasized the University's prerogative in the
development of the area.
"All of Stanford's lands ultimately are for academic
use," he said.
However, Richman said no major development in
the foothills is likely in the near future. "In the
lifetime of our children, the foothills won't look much
different than they do today," he said.
Development of the foothills region is a particularly
sensitive subject m the Stanford community because
of controversy surrounding the recently departed
Reagan Library. The presidential archive's proposed
site in the foothills overlooking
Junipero Serra Boulevard sparked
heated debate here over the na
ture of development in the foot
hills.
Critics of the proposed library
argued that it would attract signif
icant tourist traffic, thereby
violating Santa Clara County's
"low intensity" land use require
ment for the foothills, an area des
ignated as "academic reserve and
open space."
According to Valerie Veronln.
assistant provost in the Office of
Management and Budget, a land
use plan for the foothills did not
exist at the time the library's site
was selected.
Veronln said she didn't think
the Reagan Library controversy
would influence the development
of the foothills plan.
Phil Williams, director of the
Planning Office, agreed with
Veronin's assessment. He said the
land use decision-making process
that led to the selection of the li
brary's site was "pretty good," but
acknowledged that the foothills
plan will insure "more confidence
In our decision-making process."
The plan Is being developed
with input from many sources, in
cluding foothills homeowners.

Anthony Slegman. professor of
electrical engineering and a foot
hills homeowner, was among
those consulted by the Planning
Office.
A leading opponent of the
Reagan Library's proposed site In
the foothills. Slegman called the
land use plan "reasonable."
He also said the recent contro
versy surrounding the library will
not significantly affect the foot
hills plan or the land use decision
making process affecting the area.
The Reagan Library controversy
may. however, cause the Faculty
Senate to play a greater role In fu
ture land use decisions. Many fac
ulty members have said they felt
excluded from the decision
making process which led to the
selection of the proposed library's
site, and that they should be con
sulted more often in such matters.
It is not known, however,
whether the senate Is going to ad
dress this issue anytime soon.
Senate Chair Kenneth Arrow
could not be reached for comment
last night.
Chan said the Planning Office
values faculty opinion in the plan
ning process and cited the Near
West Campus project as an exam
ple of cooperation between the fac
ulty and her office.
"We have always welcomed fac
ulty Involvement, and that will
continue." she said.
