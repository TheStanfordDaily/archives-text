The Stanford foothills are the subject of a new
regional land use plan now under development in the
University Planning Office.
"The purpose of the plan is not to encourage devel

wisely and preserve the open-land characteristic
which we all love," said Tom Richman, a campus
planner in the Planning Office.
The plan will include a detailed description and
analysis of the area's topography, vegetation and
wildlife.
Currently, the only major building project planned
for the foothills region is the Westin Hotel scheduled
for construction at the intersection of Interstate 280

The foothills plan, which is currently in draft form,
will be submitted for review next week to the Univer

according to Judy Chan, associate director of the
Planning Office. The plan will then be reviewed by
the long-term land use group within the Planning Of
fice. Eventually, the plan will be released to the
public.
While acknowledging the foothills' significant
recreational value to the Stanford community, Rich
man emphasized the University's prerogative in the
development of the area.
"All of Stanford's lands ultimately are for academic
use," he said.

the foothills is likely in the near future. "In the
lifetime of our children, the foothills won't look much
different than they do today," he said.
Development of the foothills region is a particularly
sensitive subject m the Stanford community because
of controversy surrounding the recently departed
Reagan Library. The presidential archive's proposed
