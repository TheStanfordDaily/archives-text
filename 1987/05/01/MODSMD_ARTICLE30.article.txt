" Twarn't so good."
rhat was Stanford Men's Golf
Coach I ini Schaafs assessment of
his team's play in the Sun Devil
Intercollegiate yesterday in Seot
tsdale, Ariz. The Cardinal's
opening-round 393 puts it in last
place in the tournament.
I would just as soon be spared
making observations. There aren't
many good ones to make," Schaaf
said.
About the only bright spot in an
otherwise dismal day was the play
of Ireshman Steve White, who
shot 74 on the par 72 McCormick
Ranch Gull Course, "a course of
substantial yardage." according to
Schaaf.
The rest of the scores were not
good. Sophomore Roger Miraglia
and freshman Brad Benbrook
were the only other two to break
HO. and they had to play the final
holes in superior fashion to do so.
Miraglia and Benbrook each shot
79. Freshman Mark Funseth. the
hottest Cardinal coming into the
tournament, shot 80. while fresh
men Brad Joondeph and Josh
Zander shot 81 and 83.
respectively.
"The positive things would be
White's round, and the best news
may be tomorrow, or so we hope."
Schaaf said.

Brigham Young leads the tourn
ament. one that history shows Is
the team's favorite of the year. In
fact, the Cougars have done so
well, they've won nearly half the
Sun Devil Intercollegiates ever
played; they've won six of 14, in
cluding last year's. They're well on
their way to defending their title
with a lead that can be considered
fairly substantial after only one
round of play. The Cougars lead
second-place UCLA by eight
strokes. BYU is at 353, UCLA at
361. Arizona State and Arizona
share third at 363. with Florida at
365.
"BYU played great. They started
the year tied for No. 1 with Okla
homa State and slipped to ninth.
They are the defending cham
pions here and have a great record
here. They won their tournament
before this and are starting to pick
up what for them. I'm sure they'd
say. has been a subpar year."
Schaaf said.
The field is one of the finest as
sembled in the country this
season. There are five of the top 10
teams competing. What's more,
two others in the group of 15 are
in the next 10.
Mikael Kuntz of New Mexico
State leads the individuals with a
68. while Brent Franklin and
