# Marquess ropes yet another top crop
## 
### TOM SENF Senior staff writer 
Three years ago. Stanford
signed Jack McDowell, then re
garded as the nation's top high
school pitcher, to a letter of Intent.
Now that the Cardinal may lose
the hard-throwing right-hander
in this year's professional draft,
the Stanford coaching staff has
once again landed the nation's top
prep pitcher in Mike Mussina of
Montoursville, Pa. "He's the best
pitching prospect in the nation,"
Stanford Coach Mark Marquess
said.
Like McDowell, Mussina can
bring it. "He's strictly a power
pitcher with a good breaking ball,"
Marquess said of the right-hander
named by Collegiate Baseball as
the top prep player in the country.
"He's gonna come after you with
the fastball, and he'll overpower
you."
Mussina is the brightest but by
no means only star in the Stan
ford recruiting class. "They are all
great athletes who are capable of
playing more than one position."
Marquess said.
Indeed, four of the seven Card

inal recruits may play more than
one position before their careers
are over. Mussina may see time at
shortstop, and two other players,
outfielder Mike Eicher of San
Diego and shortstop Scott Weiss
of Palmdale, were recruited as po
sition players before outstanding
senior seasons on the mound
made them pitching prospects as
well. Both are right-handers.
Outfielder/pitcher Jeff Light is
another player whose permanent
position is yet to be determined.
The right-hander attended
Montclair Prep in Canoga Park,
the same high school as current
Cardinal center fielder Toi Cook.
Stanford also added two more
thoroughbreds to its already well
stocked stable of pitchers in
righties Stan Spencer of Van
couver. Wash., and David Ver
duzco of Santa Cruz.
The Cardinal's only recruit who
is strictly a position player is hard
hitting third baseman Greg
Colbrunn of Fontana. The 6-foot.
195-pounder hit .550 as a sopho
more at Fontana High, but
slumped to an anemic .454 last
season.
