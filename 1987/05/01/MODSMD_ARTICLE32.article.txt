# Card softball hosts Santa Clara
## 
### EVAN TUCHINSKY Staff writer 
Sunshine, Saturday and
softball — the perfect combina
tion. or so the Stanford softball
team hopes when it faces the
Santa Clara Broncos in a
doubleheader. beginning at
noon tomorrow at Baylands Field
in Palo Alto.
"They're going to be tough,"
Stanford Coach Tami Brown
said. "They're Division 1 with
scholarships." In addition, the
Broncos are sitting in fifth in the
Western Coast Athletic Confer
ence. The Cardinal, 20-2 this

year, is a club team with no con
ference affiliation.
Stanford is coming off a sweep
of Gavilan Junior College in Gil
roy last weekend. The Cardinal
handily defeated the Rams 3-0
and 5-3. The task will be much
greater this weekend.
"They don't pitch that tough,
but they hit well and defense well
and are smart," Brown said.
"We're going to be smarter and
hit harder.
"We want to come out with a
barrage of hits," she added.
Pitchers Lisa Buchanan and
Dawn Becker will have their

work cut out for them to stop the
Broncos' brute batters. "Their
pitcher hits the ball well, and
their catcher is fast when she
gets on base." Brown said.
"We're going to pitch around the
pitcher and catcher.
"We'll pitch them, but we'll
make them hit bad pitches. We'll
pitch a lot of off-speeds. If the
catcher gets on base, we'll watch
for steals," Brown said.
Two of the Stanford squad —
catcher/shortstop Barcy Fisher,
who leads the Cardinal with her
.377 average, and second
baseman Terri Silliman — have

been plagued by strep throat this
week, which could reduce the
team to eight players. Brown,
however, believes that they will
be back in practice Friday, en
abling the Cardinal to meet the
Broncos without rescheduling.
Saturday's games will be
played at Stanford's home turf.
Bavlands Softball Field, located
about three miles east of
campus. To get there, take Em
barcadero to Ceng Road, the
second stoplight after the 101
overpass, and turn left. Once at
the athletic center, the softball
field will be to the left, behind the
baseball field.
