# Manager calls system 'state-of-the-art'
## RF: Alarms are a potential danger 
### RUSSELL KOROBKIN Editorial staff 
A rash of false fire alarms has
created a "potentially dangerous
situation" in Florence Moore Hall,
according to Resident Fellow Bill
Ramsey.
In a letter to Asst. Dean of Stu
dent Affairs Alice Supton, Ramsey
wrote that repeated malfunctions
of Flo Mo's new fire alarm system
have lulled residents into ignoring
alarms.
"When a 'real* emergency arises,
I fear that no one will respond," he
wrote.

"During the first alarms, all the
residents of the dorm vacated the
premises. But six false alarms at
all hours of the night has now
caused all of us to be skeptical and
not respond," Ramsey stated.
The new system was installed in
response to a new Santa Clara
County ordinance that requires a
smoke detector between the sleep

residences in unincorporated
parts of the county, according to
Terry McGovern, project manager
of Housing Facilities. Similar sys
tems were installed earlier this
year in Escondido Village, Stern

Hall, Wilbur Hall and Lagunlta
Court. Crothers Hall and Crothers
Memorial Hall will receive new
alarm systems this spring.
McGovern attributed the false
alarms to a combination of defec
tive smoke alarms and alarms that
are oversensitive to common
odors such as glue, burning pop
corn and cigarette smoke.
He said that although the sys
tem in Flo Mo consists of "state-of
the-art" equipment, it is not per
fect.
"None of this is low-bid stuff,
but It can fail." McGovern said.
"We know with these systems

we're going to have an occasional
unwanted alarm. We're trying to
analyze and evaluate every alarm
we get."
He added that everything possi
ble is being done to correct the
problems with the Flo Mo system.
McGovern was not overly dis
turbed by the reports that many
dorm residents were not evacuat
ing the building during alarms.
He said the alarm at least wakes
up residents and alerts them to
the possibility of danger. "Your
own senses then are going to
