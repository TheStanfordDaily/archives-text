# LeVant decision may be dissolved
## 
### ANN MARSH Staff writer 
Attorneys representing Simone
LeVant have agreed to an NCAA re
quest to dissolve a Santa Clara
County court order that allowed
LeVant to compete on the Stan
ford women's diving team despite
her refusal to submit to manda
tory drug tests, according to
Susan Harrlman, one of Levant's
attorneys.
Since LeVant's attorneys are not
disputing the NCAA's motion, the
Santa Clara County Superior
Court will grant dissolution, ac
cording to Jack Friedenthal, Stan
ford's faculty athletic representa
tive to the NCAA and the Pacific 10
Conference.
"The parties (attorneys
representing LeVant and the
NCAA) have both stipulated that
the only reason for vacating the
injunction is that Simone no
longer needs It," said Bob Van
Nest, also an attorney for LeVant.
LeVant obtained a preliminary
injunction March 11 which would
have allowed her to compete in the
NCAA diving championships, had
she qualified. She had been bat
tling the NCAA since October,
when she refused to sign a con
sent form agreeing to random
drug testing, which is required of
all intercollegiate athletes.
The NCAA will formally present
a motion to the Santa Clara
County Superior Court next week
asking that the preliminary in
junction be eliminated now that
LeVant is graduating and can no
longer take part In college ath

letics.
In a brief submitted to Superior
Court Judge Conrad Rushing, the
NCAA argued that because LeVant
failed to qualify for the NCAAs, the
injunction shoud be dissolved,
and because she never claimed to
represent all NCAA athletes, the
precedent of the case should be
negated.
"The basic premise of the plain
tiffs complaint for relief is that, as
a diver, she competes in a sport
which is not typical." NCAA attor
neys wrote.
"The plaintiff is not asserting a
general question but a narrow
one, Evolving the validity of the
NCAA's drug test as it pertains to
her particular sport of diving."
Attorneys for the two parties
disagree about whether the deci
sion will serve as precedent in fu
ture suits against the NCAA.
According to George Gangwere,
one of the attorneys representing
the NCAA against LeVant, "once
dissolved (the injunction) should
no longer serve as much of a pre
cedent" in other drug testing
cases.
One of those cases involves Jen
nifer Hill, captain of the Stanford
women's soccer team.
Harriman disputes Gangwere's
claim. "[The LeVant decision] still
sets a precedent, even if it's dis
solved. It's my opinion that (Santa
Clara County Superior Court
Judge Peter) Stone's reasoning
still stands." she said.
Doug Johnson, director of
legislative services for the NCAA,
said. "It is still our association's
position that our drug testing pro
gram is legitimate and legal and
we will continue (our efforts) until
the question has been heard and
decided on by the courts."
According to ' Friedenthal,
despite the move to dissolve the
injunction. "The logic (from the
LeVant case) still exists" and will
be applicable in future cases. "The
precedent of the case is just as
good whether its been dismissed
or not," he said.
"(The injunction) decided noth
ing except that there was enough
of a chance that Simone would
win," that it allowed her to com
pete in the interim. Friedenthal
added.
LeVant is represented by the
San Francisco law firm of Keker &
Brockett on behalf of the Ameri
can Civil Liberties Union of North
ern California.

Earlier this month. University
President Donald Kennedy hinted
that the University is exploring
ways to support LeVant, Hill and
other Stanford athletes in the
dispute with the NCAA.
Athletic Director Andy Geiger
has been a long-time critic of the
NCAA's drug testing policy. "I hap
pen to be in support of Simone's
case and think there needs to be a
great deal of work done on the
NCAA's drug testing policy," he
said.
The University voted against the
program when it was proposed,
but has complied with its
guidelines since it has been in ef
fect.
The drug test under question
requires that an athlete urinate
into a cup in full view of an NCAA
official. The urine is then tested
for traces of drugs.
The tests, however, cannot dis
tinguish between therapeutic and
performance-enhancing drugs,
according to a memorandum for
Levant's case on file at the Santa
Clara Superior Court.
