# Traffic justice, California-style
## 
### CHARLIE GOFEN Senior staff writer 
Rick, a student, was caught
speeding on Stanford Avenue.
He said he was racing to Old
Union to pay his tuition.
Old Man Jim. now retired,
was ticketed for signaling a
slow driver to get out of his
way. He cited a life-long aver
sion to people who drive under
the speed limit.
Francine. a technical writer,
was nabbed for running a stop
sign. She said she was listen
ing to a tape of Tibetan chant
ing when the powerful over
tones disturbed her concentra
tion.
Welcome to California's Im
proved Traffic Safety Course,
Level One. Location: Palo Alto

High School. Room 607. Date:
Saturday. April 25.
This is a tale of traffic justice
— how 41 scofflaws gave eight
hours of their lives to the state
just to keep a moving violation
off their driving records, and
what one of those offenders
gleaned from the experience.
"Traffic justice," said in
structor Wendell, a 6-foot-6.
250-lb. former truck driver, "is
the only system in America
where you are guilty until you
can prove yourself innocent."
"How about the 1.R.5.?"
chimed in one white-haired
man.
Wendell looked mildly
annoyed. "Traffic justice," he
said, "is one of the very Jew
systems in America where you
are guilty until proven Innocent."
Wendell, good-natured and
likable, paced around the room
most of the day, soliciting our
opinions and then offering his
own. seldom insisting that he had
all the ans vers simply because he
was our teacher. In return, the
class let some of Wendell's argu
ments slide, even when they
seemed a bit strained. Early on,
for example, there was his defense
for wearing seat belts.
"Studies have shown that if
you're killed in a car crash, and
you were wearing your seat belt,
then if you had been in the same
crash and you hadn't been
wearing your seat belt, you would
have been really dead. You would
have been crushed."
Later came the Big Theory, the
key lesson of the entire day. Wen
dell told us that if Americans
could stay in touch with their
values, they would never risk their
lives by violating traffic laws.
"What value do Americans
cherish most?" he asked us.
"Our lives!" shouted an interior
designer sitting against the back
wall, clutching her Louis Vuitton
purse.
"That's right," Wendell replied.
"Life! And what value do Am

ericans cherish second most?"
"Liberty!" yelled an attorney.
"No." said Wendell. "That's not
it. What do we Americans value
even more than liberty?"
"Our cars!" screamed a Stanford
student behind me.
"No, no," said Wendell, grin
ning. "Our health! We value life
and then health. And we only
speed when we lose touch with
those values and put temporary
concerns ahead of real concerns."
Perhaps Wendell was on to
something. Shelly, an engineer,
told the class how he had gotten
his first ticket 37 years ago, rush
ing to a burlesque show.
The eight hours went quickly,
with three movies and what I call a
"sharing session." Wendell asked
the 41 of us to Introduce ourselves
to the group and give our occupa
tions, explanations of how we got
our tickets and a five-year history
of our driving violations, Includ
ing any serious traffic accidents.
One Stanford student listed his
occupation as "hasher."
A woman whose job I didn't
catch broke into tears as she
recounted the family tragedy that
preceded her speeding violation.
An insurance broker claimed he
hadn't been ticketed at all but
merely "came to see what this was
all about."

There was Ruby the florist.
Linda the nurse and Carole the
professor. There was Dave the en
gineer. Greg the engineer and Bill
the engineer. There were eight
bleary-eyed Stanford students
who looked as if they'd never
before been awake at 8 a.m. And
there were two attorneys, who
over the course of the day
managed to disagree on every legal
question raised.
It was an odd mixture of people
indeed, linked only by their com
mon delinquency. The scene
brought back memories of "The
Breakfast Club." Today we dis
covered that we are all part
brain, princess, jock, basket case
and criminal.
Around 10 a.m. I offered my
own story.
"I was charged with running a
stop sign at the corner of Stanford
and Yale," I began. "The police of
ficer walked up to my car and
asked me, 'Do you know what you
did wrong?' and I said. 'Yes I do; I
ran the stop sign back ther^.'
"The officer gave me a quizzical
look, so I added, 'God told me to do
it.'
"The officer asked. And why did
God tell you to do it?' and I said,
'God told me that for symbolic
purposes, I should never yield to
cross-traffic from Yale when

driving on Stanford Avenue.'
"And then the officer said, 'Can I
see your license and registration?'
and I replied. 'Well, you can ticket
me if you want, but I've been vind
icated by a higher authority.' "
I have three observations I
ought to share at this point.
First, most people are students
at heart. I had laughed as I walked
into the Paly High classroom at 8
a.m. and saw a group of adults sit
ting at small desks lined up
against walls covered with
chalkboards, a large American flag
and silly signs that said things
like, "Don't be afraid to ask dumb
questions." But everyone fit right
in, raising hands, taking notes
and even asking permission to go
to the bathroom.
Second, if a film projector is
going to break, as ours did, it
might as well happen in a room
full of engineers, as ours was. I
was reminded of a Thanksgiving
dinner I had a couple years ago at
the home of a thoracic surgery
professor. Upon arriving, I was in
troduced to a man from pediatric
surgery and a man from car
diovascular surgery. I had no
worry that we'd be able to find
someone to carve the turkey.
Third, traffic school instructors
who have Stanford students in
their classes had better maintain

a good sense of humor. The stu
dents in my group got funnier as
the day went on. When Wendell
asked the class to vote on one of
three topics for our afternoon dis
cussion, the students, sitting to
gether in the back of the room,
decided to vote as a bloc, rallied
the rest of the class to vote with
them and then demanded a runoff
after losing the initial contest. The
Stanford students' role play was
so silly I can't even describe it.
I also picked up a few driving
tips.

The area's chief speed traps are
along Alma, at the Embarcadero
underpass and, of course, on
Stanford Avenue, where a tall
blond woman terrorizes drivers
with her radar gun.
I already miss some of the
people I met Saturday. As the class
was filing out at 4 p.m.. an elderly
woman accidently knocked my
notebook off my desk. She didn't
lean down to pick it up. She just
smiled and explained, "God told
me to do it."

seemed a bit strained. Early on,
for example, there was his defense
for wearing seat belts.
"Studies have shown that if
you're killed in a car crash, and
you were wearing your seat belt,
then if you had been in the same
crash and you hadn't been
wearing your seat belt, you would
have been really dead. You would
have been crushed."
Later came the Big Theory, the
key lesson of the entire day. Wen
dell told us that if Americans
could stay in touch with their
values, they would never risk their
lives by violating traffic laws.
"What value do Americans
cherish most?" he asked us.
"Our lives!" shouted an interior
designer sitting against the back
wall, clutching her Louis Vuitton
purse.
"That's right," Wendell replied.
"Life! And what value do Am

ericans cherish second most?"
"Liberty!" yelled an attorney.
"No." said Wendell. "That's not
it. What do we Americans value
even more than liberty?"
"Our cars!" screamed a Stanford
student behind me.
"No, no," said Wendell, grin
ning. "Our health! We value life
and then health. And we only
speed when we lose touch with
those values and put temporary
concerns ahead of real concerns."
Perhaps Wendell was on to
something. Shelly, an engineer,
told the class how he had gotten
his first ticket 37 years ago, rush
ing to a burlesque show.
The eight hours went quickly,
with three movies and what I call a
"sharing session." Wendell asked
the 41 of us to Introduce ourselves
to the group and give our occupa
tions, explanations of how we got
our tickets and a five-year history
of our driving violations, Includ
ing any serious traffic accidents.
One Stanford student listed his
occupation as "hasher."
A woman whose job I didn't
catch broke into tears as she
recounted the family tragedy that
preceded her speeding violation.
An insurance broker claimed he
hadn't been ticketed at all but
merely "came to see what this was
all about."

There was Ruby the florist.
Linda the nurse and Carole the
professor. There was Dave the en
gineer. Greg the engineer and Bill
the engineer. There were eight
bleary-eyed Stanford students
who looked as if they'd never
before been awake at 8 a.m. And
there were two attorneys, who
over the course of the day
managed to disagree on every legal
question raised.
It was an odd mixture of people
indeed, linked only by their com
mon delinquency. The scene
brought back memories of "The
Breakfast Club." Today we dis
covered that we are all part
brain, princess, jock, basket case
and criminal.
Around 10 a.m. I offered my
own story.
"I was charged with running a
stop sign at the corner of Stanford
and Yale," I began. "The police of
ficer walked up to my car and
asked me, 'Do you know what you
did wrong?' and I said. 'Yes I do; I
ran the stop sign back ther^.'
"The officer gave me a quizzical
look, so I added, 'God told me to do
it.'
"The officer asked. And why did
God tell you to do it?' and I said,
'God told me that for symbolic
purposes, I should never yield to
cross-traffic from Yale when

driving on Stanford Avenue.'
"And then the officer said, 'Can I
see your license and registration?'
and I replied. 'Well, you can ticket
me if you want, but I've been vind
icated by a higher authority.' "
I have three observations I
ought to share at this point.
First, most people are students
at heart. I had laughed as I walked
into the Paly High classroom at 8
a.m. and saw a group of adults sit
ting at small desks lined up
against walls covered with
chalkboards, a large American flag
and silly signs that said things
like, "Don't be afraid to ask dumb
questions." But everyone fit right
in, raising hands, taking notes
and even asking permission to go
to the bathroom.
Second, if a film projector is
going to break, as ours did, it
might as well happen in a room
full of engineers, as ours was. I
was reminded of a Thanksgiving
dinner I had a couple years ago at
the home of a thoracic surgery
professor. Upon arriving, I was in
troduced to a man from pediatric
surgery and a man from car
diovascular surgery. I had no
worry that we'd be able to find
someone to carve the turkey.
Third, traffic school instructors
who have Stanford students in
their classes had better maintain

a good sense of humor. The stu
dents in my group got funnier as
the day went on. When Wendell
asked the class to vote on one of
three topics for our afternoon dis
cussion, the students, sitting to
gether in the back of the room,
decided to vote as a bloc, rallied
the rest of the class to vote with
them and then demanded a runoff
after losing the initial contest. The
Stanford students' role play was
so silly I can't even describe it.
I also picked up a few driving
tips.

The area's chief speed traps are
along Alma, at the Embarcadero
underpass and, of course, on
Stanford Avenue, where a tall
blond woman terrorizes drivers
with her radar gun.
I already miss some of the
people I met Saturday. As the class
was filing out at 4 p.m.. an elderly
woman accidently knocked my
notebook off my desk. She didn't
lean down to pick it up. She just
smiled and explained, "God told
me to do it."

Rick, a student, was caught
speeding on Stanford Avenue.
He said he was racing to Old
Union to pay his tuition.
Old Man Jim. now retired,
was ticketed for signaling a
slow driver to get out of his
way. He cited a life-long aver
sion to people who drive under
the speed limit.
Francine. a technical writer,
was nabbed for running a stop
sign. She said she was listen
ing to a tape of Tibetan chant
ing when the powerful over
tones disturbed her concentra
tion.
Welcome to California's Im
proved Traffic Safety Course,
Level One. Location: Palo Alto

High School. Room 607. Date:
Saturday. April 25.
This is a tale of traffic justice
— how 41 scofflaws gave eight
hours of their lives to the state
just to keep a moving violation
off their driving records, and
what one of those offenders
gleaned from the experience.
"Traffic justice," said in
structor Wendell, a 6-foot-6.
250-lb. former truck driver, "is
the only system in America
where you are guilty until you
can prove yourself innocent."
"How about the 1.R.5.?"
chimed in one white-haired
man.
Wendell looked mildly
annoyed. "Traffic justice," he
said, "is one of the very Jew
systems in America where you
are guilty until proven Innocent."
Wendell, good-natured and
likable, paced around the room
most of the day, soliciting our
opinions and then offering his
own. seldom insisting that he had
all the ans vers simply because he
was our teacher. In return, the
class let some of Wendell's argu
ments slide, even when they
seemed a bit strained. Early on,
for example, there was his defense
for wearing seat belts.
"Studies have shown that if
you're killed in a car crash, and
