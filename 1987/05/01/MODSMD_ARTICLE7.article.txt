"We seem to be becoming a nation of
poor and rich, with the middle class
squeezed out of existence," former Cali
fornia Supreme Court Assoc. Justice
Cruz Reynoso argued last night in a
speech delivered at the Law School.
Reynoso, a justice until he was voted
off the bench last November, noted that
less than 2 percent of the population
owns half the wealth in the United
States. Meanwhile, he added, more than
80 percent of the population owns
practically nothing.
Reynoso, who grew up in Orange
County and began working as a fruit
picker at the age of eight, can identify
well with the situation of the poor, and
especially well with the neglected
Chicano communities in California.
In the lecture sponsored by the
Chicano Research Center, he pointed
out that in per capita expenditure on
public education, the state of California
ranks "49th. if not 50th" In the nation.

Addressing what he called "the prob
lem of the undocumented." in reference
to the Increasing number of illegally
working Latinos living in rural parts of
the United States. Reynoso described
the situation of those who "can't go to
hospitals for fear that they will be re
ported." who "can't call the police for
protection against crime." and who can
not speak out against unfair wages and
working conditions. Reynoso is a co
founder of California Rural Legal Assis
tance.
Reynoso praised the recently passed
Simpson-Rodino Act, which has initi
ated the process of legalization for the
previously illegal residents of the United
States. According to Reynoso. the act
will make "hundreds of thousands, if
not millions" of new Americans, which
will add to the diversity of culture in the
United States.
Reynoso. who received his law degree
from the Boalt School of Law at UC-
Berkeley in 1958. repeatedly returned to
the themes of diversity and community,
and how these fit into a constitutional
democracy. "Diversity means nothing

outside the context of democracy," he
asserted.
Saying that the diversity of race, eth
nicity, culture, language and religion
have "helped make the United States
stronger," Reynoso argued that great di
versity is "not to be tolerated but to be
enjoyed" and that the "notion of commu
nity is central to the theme of
democracy."
Americans are by definition a diverse
people, he said, stressing the danger of
what he called "cultural genocide."
"In democracy, agreement is not es
sential; participation is," he said,
quoting Thomas Jefferson.
"We need participation to make
democracy work." Reynoso emphasized,
noting that the young and poor partici
pate less in politics today than the older
and wealthier. And the homeless cannot
participate at all. he added — "no ad
dress, no vote."
Reynoso suggested that he was voted
off the California Supreme Court last
November, along with Chief Justice
Rose Bird and Associa'° Justice Joseph
Grodin. because "the people who could
have helped us did not."
