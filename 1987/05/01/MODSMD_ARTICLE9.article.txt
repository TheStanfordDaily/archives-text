Reagan met with supporters
WASHINGTON — Carl "Spitz" Channell, who pleaded guilty to
tax-fraud conspiracy In connection with the Iran-contra scandal.
In 1985 paid President Reagan's former personal assistant. David
Fischer, a *20.000-a-month retainer primarily to arrange seven
private meetings between the president and Channell's major con
tributors, according to a source close to Channell.
The ♦20,000-a-month arrangement replaced an original agree
ment to pay the former aide <50,000 for each meeting with the
president, according to this source, who is familiar with the ma
terial Channell provided special counsel Lawrence Walsh.
Fischer was Reagan's personal aide — "his right-hand man, his
door opener," according to one associate — from 1977 through
the 1984 campaign. He left his job at the White House on April 7,
1985, but did not hand in his White House pass until Nov. 24,
1986 — the day before Attorney General Edwin Meese disclosed
that funds from arms sales to Iran had been diverted to the
Nicaraguan contras.
In late 1985, Channell hired Fischer to perform consulting
services. His White House pass allowed Fischer access to the White
House and he continued to have authority to bring visitors in for
quick sessions and "photo opportunities" with the president, ac
cording to four past and present White House officials.
Ronald Precup, Fischer's lawyer, said "no comment" when
asked about the financial arrangement between Fischer and
Channell.
Asked to provide dates of meetings between the president and
contributors to Channell's organizations, a White House spokes
man declined, saying "these matters are under investigation. All
the material has been turned over to the independent prosecutor."
The private meetings between the president and contributors to
Channell's tax-exempt foundation are part of a growing body of
evidence showing that Reagan and other key members of his ad
ministration had numerous dealings with participants in the
criminal conspiracy to which Channell pleaded guilty Wednesday.

meetings with contributors to Channell's tax-exempt foundation,

Customs overlooked weapons
WASHINGTON — The independent counsel in the Iran-contra
scandal is probing the U.S. Customs Service's failure to inspect a
358-ton shipload of smuggled arms unloaded in North Carolina
last fall by associates of Lt. Col. Oliver North, Customs Commis
sioner William von Raab said yesterday.
The Polish and Portuguese rifles, mines and bullets were part of
a covert network of arms deliveries controlled by North and his as
sociates, Richard Secord and Albert Hakim, during a period when
U.S. military aid to the Nicaraguan rebels was banned.
The arms, most of which were described on customs forms as
oil-drilling equipment, originally were destined for Central
America for delivery to the Contras. But for reasons that are unex
plained, the weapons instead were sent to Wilmington, N.C., last
October, where they were unloaded and delivered to the CIA and a
Georgia munitions dealer.
The lack of a thorough inspection is a matter of concern, von
Raab said. He said that the cargo escaped the legally required ex
amination because of "negligence" by a customs inspector at the
scene.
Von Raab said he did not know whether those at fault had been
disciplined because independent counsel Lawrence Walsh had
taken over the investigation of the matter.
Soviet labor law takes effect
MOSCOW — A much-heralded law goes into effect tomorrow
that will allow thousands of Soviet citizens for the first time to
work for themselves instead of the state.
Announced last November, the new law expanding legal
"individual labor" has already been put into practice in scattered
areas of the Soviet Union, as craftsmen, handymen, hairdressers
and cafe managers experiment with concepts of profit, loss, com
petition and risk.
Under the new law, people can register with local authorities
and offer their services to the public — if necessary, with credit
and premises provided by the state. In some cases, the entrepre
neur pays a fee for a license; In others, the state gets its share
through progressive taxes.
Experts here say that by itself, the new law — restricted to about
40 job classifications — is not likely to have a big economic impact
since lt will mostly legitimize work that is now being done illegally.
The bigger effect, they note, will be psychological, as work once re
garded with suspicion becomes part of the economic mainstream.
Also, the "individual labor" law promises to be one of the most
tangible features of Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev's package of
reforms, and one that could have the most direct impact on
people's lives by Improving the now-dismal state of consumer
services.
Soviet spokesmen are quick to protest that the new law does not
allow private ownership and is not a step away from socialist prin
ciples. But they concede that It will challenge old stereotypes and
require a rethinking of concepts about work.
Soviets to buy American wheat
WASHINGTON — The Soviet Union, enticed by the promise of a
U.S. government subsidy, has agreed to buy 4 million metric tons
of American bread-quality wheat this year. Agriculture Secretary
Richard Lyng announced yesterday
The sale — equivalent to about half of last year's crop in Kansas,
the No. 1 wheat state — will be carried out under a U.S. export
subsidy program designed to recapture markets lost to subsidized
competition, principally from the European Economic Commu
nity.
Lyng said he found it "troublesome" that the United States was
forced to resort to subsidization of farm exports. But. he added,
"the important thing here to me is that we are being competitive
... in order to sell to the Soviets we must be competitive."
The secretary would not speculate on the size of the subsidy,
but at current prices the sale could mean roughly >376 million to
U.S. farmers. The deal will be carried out by private exporters who
will be given grain from Agriculture Department surpluses to
make up for lower prices they offer the Soviets.
Kremlin wheat buyers rejected a similar subsidized sale offer
from the Reagan administration last fall, contending that the U.S.
price remained higher than the world market. France, a member
of the EEC, subsequently made a major deal with the Soviets at
more favorable rates.
Although Moscow is obligated to buy 4 million tons of wheat
each year under a long-term grain agreement with this country,
Soviet buyers have complained about high prices here and refused
to buy. Last year they bought only 200.000 tons of wheat and this
year they had bought none.

Experts here say that by itself, the new law — restricted to about
40 job classifications — is not likely to have a big economic impact

The bigger effect, they note, will be psychological, as work once re
garded with suspicion becomes part of the economic mainstream.
Also, the "individual labor" law promises to be one of the most
tangible features of Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev's package of

Soviet spokesmen are quick to protest that the new law does not
allow private ownership and is not a step away from socialist prin

require a rethinking of concepts about work.
Soviets to buy American wheat
WASHINGTON — The Soviet Union, enticed by the promise of a
U.S. government subsidy, has agreed to buy 4 million metric tons
of American bread-quality wheat this year. Agriculture Secretary
Richard Lyng announced yesterday
The sale — equivalent to about half of last year's crop in Kansas,
the No. 1 wheat state — will be carried out under a U.S. export
subsidy program designed to recapture markets lost to subsidized
competition, principally from the European Economic Commu
nity.
Lyng said he found it "troublesome" that the United States was
forced to resort to subsidization of farm exports. But. he added,
"the important thing here to me is that we are being competitive
... in order to sell to the Soviets we must be competitive."
The secretary would not speculate on the size of the subsidy,
but at current prices the sale could mean roughly >376 million to
U.S. farmers. The deal will be carried out by private exporters who
will be given grain from Agriculture Department surpluses to
make up for lower prices they offer the Soviets.
Kremlin wheat buyers rejected a similar subsidized sale offer
from the Reagan administration last fall, contending that the U.S.
price remained higher than the world market. France, a member
of the EEC, subsequently made a major deal with the Soviets at
more favorable rates.
Although Moscow is obligated to buy 4 million tons of wheat
each year under a long-term grain agreement with this country,
Soviet buyers have complained about high prices here and refused
to buy. Last year they bought only 200.000 tons of wheat and this
year they had bought none.

Reagan met with supporters
WASHINGTON — Carl "Spitz" Channell, who pleaded guilty to
tax-fraud conspiracy In connection with the Iran-contra scandal.
In 1985 paid President Reagan's former personal assistant. David
Fischer, a *20.000-a-month retainer primarily to arrange seven
private meetings between the president and Channell's major con
tributors, according to a source close to Channell.
The ♦20,000-a-month arrangement replaced an original agree
ment to pay the former aide <50,000 for each meeting with the
president, according to this source, who is familiar with the ma
terial Channell provided special counsel Lawrence Walsh.
Fischer was Reagan's personal aide — "his right-hand man, his
door opener," according to one associate — from 1977 through
the 1984 campaign. He left his job at the White House on April 7,
1985, but did not hand in his White House pass until Nov. 24,
1986 — the day before Attorney General Edwin Meese disclosed
that funds from arms sales to Iran had been diverted to the
Nicaraguan contras.
In late 1985, Channell hired Fischer to perform consulting
services. His White House pass allowed Fischer access to the White
House and he continued to have authority to bring visitors in for
quick sessions and "photo opportunities" with the president, ac
cording to four past and present White House officials.
Ronald Precup, Fischer's lawyer, said "no comment" when
asked about the financial arrangement between Fischer and
Channell.
Asked to provide dates of meetings between the president and
contributors to Channell's organizations, a White House spokes
man declined, saying "these matters are under investigation. All
the material has been turned over to the independent prosecutor."
The private meetings between the president and contributors to
Channell's tax-exempt foundation are part of a growing body of
evidence showing that Reagan and other key members of his ad
ministration had numerous dealings with participants in the
criminal conspiracy to which Channell pleaded guilty Wednesday.

Customs overlooked weapons
WASHINGTON — The independent counsel in the Iran-contra
scandal is probing the U.S. Customs Service's failure to inspect a
358-ton shipload of smuggled arms unloaded in North Carolina
last fall by associates of Lt. Col. Oliver North, Customs Commis
sioner William von Raab said yesterday.
The Polish and Portuguese rifles, mines and bullets were part of
a covert network of arms deliveries controlled by North and his as
sociates, Richard Secord and Albert Hakim, during a period when
U.S. military aid to the Nicaraguan rebels was banned.
The arms, most of which were described on customs forms as
oil-drilling equipment, originally were destined for Central
America for delivery to the Contras. But for reasons that are unex
plained, the weapons instead were sent to Wilmington, N.C., last
October, where they were unloaded and delivered to the CIA and a
Georgia munitions dealer.
The lack of a thorough inspection is a matter of concern, von
Raab said. He said that the cargo escaped the legally required ex
amination because of "negligence" by a customs inspector at the
scene.
Von Raab said he did not know whether those at fault had been
disciplined because independent counsel Lawrence Walsh had
taken over the investigation of the matter.
Soviet labor law takes effect
MOSCOW — A much-heralded law goes into effect tomorrow
that will allow thousands of Soviet citizens for the first time to
work for themselves instead of the state.
Announced last November, the new law expanding legal
"individual labor" has already been put into practice in scattered
areas of the Soviet Union, as craftsmen, handymen, hairdressers
and cafe managers experiment with concepts of profit, loss, com
petition and risk.
Under the new law, people can register with local authorities
and offer their services to the public — if necessary, with credit
and premises provided by the state. In some cases, the entrepre
neur pays a fee for a license; In others, the state gets its share
through progressive taxes.
