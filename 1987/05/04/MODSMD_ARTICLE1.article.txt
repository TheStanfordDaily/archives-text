# Kennedy pressured to appear at forum
## 
### STEPHEN KASIERSKI Senior staff writer 
A group of concerned faculty
and students is pressuring Uni
versity President Donald Kennedy
to reconsider his decision not to
appear later this month in an
open campus forum on social re
sponsibility.
Kennedy and other University
officials faced a barrage of
criticism from students and fac
ulty at a similar event last May.
Organizers of the latest effort say
the event is in jeopardy without
Kennedy's participation.
Students and faculty plan to
circulate a petition asking Ken
nedy reconsider his decision.
According to freshman Johanna
Rodgers, a member of Stanford
Out of South Africa (SOSA). con
cerned students and faculty had a
"very pleasant" meeting with Uni
versity officials about 10 days ago
to discuss the forum and Ken
nedy's participation.
University administrators at the
meeting were Robert Freelen, vice
president for Public Affairs, and
Stephen Peeps, director of Univer
sity Relations.
Following the meeting, Kennedy
sent a letter to forum organizers
saying he would assist in plan
ning the event, but he intended to
"sit this one out."
In addition to an unusually
busy schedule of Centennial
Celebration events, Kennedy said
in the letter he was "troubled by
the notion that at Stanford, a
meaningful. Intellectual exchange
of views among a sizeable portion
of this community cannot be
guaranteed without the presi
dent's presence."
According to Rodgers, Kennedy
had already been invited to take
part in a forum specifically on in
vestment policy. The invitation
was extended through the Univer
sity Board of Trustees about two
months ago, she said.
A group of faculty, students and
community members had also
been asking Kennedy to partici
pate in a forum since the fall, said
Biology Prof. Dow Woodward, who
attended the meeting along with
English Prof. Ronald Rebholz. Al

though Kennedy had encouraged
the organization of the forum.
Woodward said Kennedy consis
tently indicated that he would not
attend the event.
The recent meeting was the first
time the two requests for Ken
nedy's presence at a forum were
addressed at the same time.
Woodward said.
Rodgers said Freelen and Peeps
indicated at the recent meeting
that Kennedy's participation in a
forum this spring was "iffy."
Freelen told The Daily that the
meeting was held precisely be
cause he knew that Kennedy was
not interested in participating in
the forum.
Freelen added, however, that
Kennedy was not attempting to

avoid confrontations or questions
by concerned students and fac
ulty.
"I don't think people can make a
good case that Kennedy hasn't
been an open president," he said,
citing numerous appearances
before student audiences in dor
mitories, as well as faculty
meetings and representatives of
the campus media.
According to Rebholz, however,
the very "fragmentation" of these
meetings indicates that Kennedy
prefers to "divide and conquer"
critics rather than face a spec
trum of University constituencies.
According to Rodgers. Kennedy
had verbally promised last year to
be "accessible" in a large public
forum.

Council of Presidents member
Carey White said Kennedy has
since declined to participate in a
number of proposed forums with
different campus groups.
But Freelen said Kennedy had
indicated that University officials,
rather than himself personally,
would certainly participate.
Although Kennedy has said in
the past that University officials
are willing to participate in
similar events. Freelen said this
agreement didn't mean that only
the president could represent the
University.
Kennedy's presence on a panel
would bring "legitimacy to the
issue" and would emphasize that
it needs to be taken care of imme
diately. Rodgers said.

ASSU Senator Stacey Leyton
said the forum would give con
cerned students and faculty an op
portunity for "face-to-face discus
sion" with Kennedy and the trus
tees rather than the more typical
meetings with assistants.
Freelen said efforts by respon
sible community leaders to
coomunlcate their concerns
through a public forum will al
ways be heard by the Administra
tion.
"In my view, the community is
not disserved by Don Kennedy not
participating in this forum," he
said.
Although a forum may still take
place without Kennedy, Wood
ward said the event "will be lack
ing the voice of the University"

and would not necessarily have
the same effect as last year's
forum.
Freelen said the Administration
would assist organizers In their ef
forts to invite trustees to partici
pate In an open discussion of com
munity concerns.
Although he acknowledged that
"you tempt peril" by seemingly
avoiding petition efforts. Freelen
said that he personally would not
by particularly "sympathetic" to
such attempts to pressure Ken
nedy to change his mind because
of the president's past commit
ment to community discussions.
White said the ASSU Senate will
discuss the forum and the Ken
nedy letter at Its meeting on Tues
day.

the organization of the forum.
Woodward said Kennedy consis
tently indicated that he would not
attend the event.
The recent meeting was the first
time the two requests for Ken
nedy's presence at a forum were
addressed at the same time.
Woodward said.
Rodgers said Freelen and Peeps
indicated at the recent meeting
that Kennedy's participation in a
forum this spring was "iffy."
Freelen told The Daily that the
meeting was held precisely be
cause he knew that Kennedy was
not interested in participating in
the forum.
Freelen added, however, that
Kennedy was not attempting to

avoid confrontations or questions
by concerned students and fac
ulty.
"I don't think people can make a
good case that Kennedy hasn't
been an open president," he said,
citing numerous appearances
before student audiences in dor
mitories, as well as faculty
meetings and representatives of
the campus media.
According to Rebholz, however,
the very "fragmentation" of these
meetings indicates that Kennedy
prefers to "divide and conquer"
critics rather than face a spec
trum of University constituencies.
According to Rodgers. Kennedy
had verbally promised last year to
be "accessible" in a large public
forum.

Council of Presidents member
Carey White said Kennedy has
since declined to participate in a
number of proposed forums with
different campus groups.
But Freelen said Kennedy had
indicated that University officials,
rather than himself personally,
would certainly participate.
Although Kennedy has said in
the past that University officials
are willing to participate in
similar events. Freelen said this
agreement didn't mean that only
the president could represent the
University.
Kennedy's presence on a panel
would bring "legitimacy to the
issue" and would emphasize that
it needs to be taken care of imme
diately. Rodgers said.

ASSU Senator Stacey Leyton
said the forum would give con
cerned students and faculty an op
portunity for "face-to-face discus
sion" with Kennedy and the trus
tees rather than the more typical
meetings with assistants.
Freelen said efforts by respon
sible community leaders to
coomunlcate their concerns
through a public forum will al
ways be heard by the Administra
tion.
"In my view, the community is
not disserved by Don Kennedy not
participating in this forum," he
said.
Although a forum may still take
place without Kennedy, Wood
ward said the event "will be lack
ing the voice of the University"

and would not necessarily have
the same effect as last year's
forum.
Freelen said the Administration
would assist organizers In their ef
forts to invite trustees to partici
pate In an open discussion of com
munity concerns.
Although he acknowledged that
"you tempt peril" by seemingly
avoiding petition efforts. Freelen
said that he personally would not
by particularly "sympathetic" to
such attempts to pressure Ken
nedy to change his mind because
of the president's past commit
ment to community discussions.
White said the ASSU Senate will
discuss the forum and the Ken
nedy letter at Its meeting on Tues
day.
