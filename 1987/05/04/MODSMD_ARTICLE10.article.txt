# Centennial adds festivity to fund raising
## 
### STEPHEN KASIERSKI Senior staff writer 
With next week's Cornerstone Weekend fes
tivities, Stanford begins to celebrate the Uni
versity's Centennial in grand style. When the
Centennial ends in 1991. University officials
hope to have celebrated more than just a suc
cessful string of ceremonies and forums
marking the University's 100 th birthday.
As they wrap up the five-year Centennial per
iod in 1991, University fund-raisers also will
be celebrating the completion ol the Centen
nial Campaign, the most ambitious fund
raising effort in Stanford history. If successful,
the campaign will raise • 1. 1 billion in gifts and
continuing support.
Although the events of Cornerstone
Weekend, to be held May 14 to 16. were
mapped out only in the last six months,
preparations for the giant fund-raising drive
began over five years ago. Despite the disparity
in advance planning, there is some "linkage''
between the campaign and the celebration, ac
cording to Stephen Peeps, executive director of
the Centennial Celebration and coordinator of
Cornerstone Weekend.
Cornerstone Weekend and other Centennial

events are designed to involve the entire Stan
ford community, including current faculty,
staff and students as well as alumni. Peeps
said.
The stream of gala events and conferences
will help "re-ignite" alumni interest in the Uni
versity and "leave a legacy around the Centen
nial that will draw attention to Stanford and
its accomplishments." Peeps said.
The fact that the Centennial will be a
University-wide celebration makes this period
a particularly appropriate time for a fund
raising campaign with diverse objectives, said
Bruce Hinchliffe. associate vice president for
development and director of the campaign.
"The Centennial celebrates the institution
as a whole, and it seemed to us most appropri
ate that a campaign during the period be for
the entire institution." he said.
But having a Centennial celebration never
meant necessarily that Stanford would auto
matically conduct a special fund-raising cam
paign, Hinchliffe said. A select committee of
senior administrators and Development Office
staffers met in 1982 to discuss the merits of
developing a campaign in conjunction with the
Centennial period.
According to Hinchliffe. there were no
"classic reasons" for Stanford to launch a cam

paign. For example, rather than reaching a
fund-raising "plateau." Hinchliffe said dona
tions to Stanford were continuing in an up
ward trend.
But the committee decided that certain in
stitutional needs could be best addressed in
this period. Hinchliffe said. After deciding to
include a campaign during the Centennial, ad
ministrators then choose to pursue a
"comprehensive" campaign with diverse
rather than limited objectives.
The far-reaching goals of the campaign are
in keeping with the University's past fund
raising experience. In 1961, Stanford
launched a »100 million Plan of Action for a
Challenging Era campaign.
Surpassed by >14 million In 1964, this tar
get was the highest amount ever sought by a
public or private university in the United
States.
From 1972 to 1977, a second major drive,
the Campaign for Stanford, again surpassed
expectations with >304 million in donations.
After deciding to conduct a comprehensive
campaign. Hinchcliffe said faculty and admi
nistrators attempted to define specific Institu
tional needs. "Development priorities" were
then selected by matching these needs with
fund-raising potential, he said.
