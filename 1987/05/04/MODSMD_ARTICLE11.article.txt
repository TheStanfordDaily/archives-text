## THE 						STANFORD DAILY An Independent Newspaper Heed student vote 
### 
ASSU elections are the one time each year
when student opinion on a variety of issues,
candidates and groups can be quantifiably
measured. In this past election, students
clearly supported the existence of a Concert
Network by approving the network's operat
ing budget. The support was less enthusias
tic, however, for the group's request that stu
dents fund $17,707 of the salary of the net
work's faculty adviser.
According to its bylaws — approved by the
University in 1984 — the Concert Network
must have a faculty adviser. In addition, the
network is required to pay one-third of the
adviser's University salary. If funds for the
adviser cannot be found, the network will not
be able to operate.
Now, the Concert Network has asked the
ASSU to approve an alternate method of pay
ment for their faculty adviser. Given the stu
dent vote on the matter, any decision by the
ASSU that provides student funds for the ad

viser would call into question the purpose of
holding elections in the first place.
In response to recent student opinion, per
haps the ASSU should center its efforts on
finding a way to eliminate student payment
for the newtork's adviser.
The ASSU should acknowledge student
preference and ensure the continuation of
the Concert Network. It shouldn't do this,
however, by diverting funds to pay the advi
ser. The senate should work with the Con
cert Network to change the network's bylaws
and remove the position of University advi
ser.
There is little reason that students should
fund a portion of the salary of a University
employee. For one thing, it is hard to believe
that the University does not have the re
sources to pay fully its own staff.
In no way should the ASSU fund the net
work faculty adviser's salary. Other avenues
must be explored and opened.
