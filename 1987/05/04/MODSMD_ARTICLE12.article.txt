# Kennedy makes policy

Donald Kennedy has publicly
criticized the Faculty Senate for
its late opposition to the Reagan
Library.
The senate may be fairly
accused of certain things, but
being kept fully and regularly in
formed during the Reagan Library
decision process is not one of
them.

JOHN MANLEY

Assuring the senate that Stan
ford is not an institution in "grave
crisis," Kennedy nonetheless cau
tioned senators before the April 2
vote to be mindful of their
"reputation for bringing careful,
realistic and thorough analysis to
difficult problems" (Campus
Report, April 8).
Kennedy asked whether some
senators were voting on the facts
or on "environmental and political
concerns." Given the unconvinc
ing arguments of the Reagan Li
brary opponents, and the senate's
many opportunities to express its
reservations before then, Kennedy
suggested that unnamed outside
observers might see the senate ac
tion as "acute buyer's remorse."
This was a vote, Kennedy
seemed to say, not only on the
Reagan Library, but on the sen
ate's probity.
Such words from the president
of the University deserve replies
from the Faculty Senate and mem
bers of the Stanford community.
Far from being involved in the
Reagan Library decision, the sen
ate was totally shut out. The presi
dent of the University decided
early on that he favored the library
(on scholarly grounds), and
quickly assumed a leadership role.
Administration planning and dis
cussions with the Hoover Institu
tion and the White House went
forward for over two years before
members of the Stanford commu
nity knew about the project. Ken
nedy consulted the faculty after
the fact. Consider the following:
□ President Kennedy met with
Hoover Director W. Glenn Camp
bell in February 1981. after which
meeting Campbell wrote President
Reagan inviting him to have his
"Presidential library on the Stan

ford campus close to the Hoover
Institution."
□ Word of the library did not
leak out until the spring of 1983,
by which time Administration
planning included consideration
of potential sites.
□ Kennedy announced the pro
ject in the summer of 1983. At
this time, he established the
Rosse Committee to look into the
scholarly value of the library, ask
ing for a report by Oct. 1.
□ On the day the senate met to
discuss the project, Kennedy told
the senators he had already sent
an offer to the White House: Stan
ford would accept the Ronald
Reagan Library, including an ex
hibit area for archival displays,
and would accept the Ronald
Reagan Center for Public Affairs,
if run by Stanford, not Hoover.
There is disagreement between
Kennedy and the Reagan adminis
tration over exactly what Kennedy
agreed to during the closed dis
cussions. Edwin Meese, citing an
unreleased letter from W. Glenn
Campbell to Kennedy, claims the
University president accepted the
library, museum and center for
public affairs (Campus Report,
Nov. 16, 1983). The University Ad
ministration notes that Kennedy
did not publicly agree to such a
package, and that the Hoover
proposals kept expanding during
negotiations.
Whatever version is correct,
warnings were heard that unless
public hearings were held on the
Reagan Library, the results could
be "disastrous." The Stanford
community would be divided.
Stanford's name would be linked
to Ronald Reagan's, further
threatening the University's repu
tation for nonpartisanship, on
which the University's legitimacy
rests. Nine faculty members wrote
the Rosse Committee asking for
full and open hearings on the
proposals, but Provost James
Rosse, chairman of the commit
tee. saw no reason why the evalua
tion process "should become a ve
hicle for the expression of political
approval or disapproval."
As a matter of fact, numerous
calls fof community involvement
were rejected as the Rosse Com
mittee and the senate followed

Kennedy's plan for speedy ap
proval. After an unprecedented
outpouring of letters, the Rosse
Committee urged Kennedy to con
sult with the Faculty Senate
before reaching a final decision,
but this he failed to do.
Some senators who approved
the library did not fully realize
that presidential libraries are part
shrine and part library, with
strong attractions to tourists. A
former chair of the Faculty Sen
ate, following Kennedy's empha
sis. felt he was endorsing a library
and archive, declaring later:
"We've been had" (Los Angeles
Times. Feb. 20). Public hearings
and a more open process would
have helped prevent such misun
derstandings.
On the evidence. President Ken
nedy excluded the senate from the
decision-making process, but the
senate is hardly blameless in this
affair. To its shame, the Faculty
Senate ignored public warnings
that the Kennedy/Rosse schedule
presented Stanford with a fait ac
compli. In partial defense of his
actions, Kennedy cites a meeting
of the senate at which only two
professors made presentations
against the Reagan Library, claim
ing that he would have been
responsive to more than
"scattered opposition" (Campus
Report, April 8).
In truth, when the senate met to
discuss the Reagan Library in De
cember 1983, most of the meeting
was consumed by then-Provost
Hastorfs presentation of the Uni
versity budget. When the time fi
nally arrived for the Reagan Li
brary discussion, few senators
had the patience for it. Library op
ponents were not permitted to
present their arguments in full,
Kennedy left the meeting early for
a previously announced engage
ment and the senate adjourned
without full discussion of the is
sues.
What, if anything, can be
learned from the Reagan Library
fiasco?
The main lesson is that under
Donald Kennedy, the Stanford
community has little real say in
key University dec'sions.

litical science.
