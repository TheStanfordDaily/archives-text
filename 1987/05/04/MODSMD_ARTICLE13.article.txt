Cheerleaders
will ruin fun
at Stanford
Rarely do I become enraged to
the point of writing to The Daily,
but the recent decision of the
Athletic Department to institute
new cheerleaders "in a style
similar to that of other college
cheerleaders" (Daily. April 29) is a
mistake that needs to be stopped
as soon as possible. Traditional
cheerleaders smack of a neo
fascist approach to college sports
that one finds in the more tradi
tional Big Ten-tvpe of school. I
don't think many at Stanford
would like to see Purdue become
our model. Stanford sports are
associated with LSJUMB and its
anti-establishmentarianism. To
allow such a traditional form of
cheerleading to sully our proud
and defiant past is to set a dan
gerous precedent. Soon we may
be hearing some Stanfordized
version of "On Wisconsin" rather
than our beloved "All Right Now."

and be wearing "Stanford is Nice"
T-shirts instead of "White Punks
on Dope." Granted, the football
team did break the recent Stan
ford mold by winning more games
than it lost, but this may not
always be the case. This holds for
the basketball team as well. It
would be a shame to wake up one
year with losing teams and a
boring, antiquated cheerleading
system that will not add any
excitement, if the games aren't
exciting to begin with.

Savoyards
have places
for students
In reading the recent review of
"Princess Ida "(Daily, April, 29), I
was left with the Impression that
the Stanford Savoyards is an
entirely non-student organiza
tion. Most, but not all. of the lead
performers in "Princess Ida" are
not from Stanford, but most of

the chorus members are Stanford
undergraduates, graduate stu
dents or staff members. We have
had students cast in some of the
best-known roles In our shows,
and many of our prominent pro
duction staff positions are occu
pied by students. The Savoyards
is a voluntary student organiza
tion with a board of directors
composed entirely of Stanford
students and staff members.
We are always looking for more
students to Join the Savoyards as
technical crew, production staff
and performers. While one maybe
less likely to be given a major role
in a Savoyards' production than
in a dorm show, when it happens
you can be assured that you were
cast over some of the best talent
the Bay Area has to offer.
