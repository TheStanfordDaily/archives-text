# Talking is the best cure
## 
### 
I rarely get the chance to read current periodicals,
but every so often a magazine will grab my attention
and I just have to read it. The May 4 issue of
Newsweek was such an issue; it featured a big cover
story on depression. The cover caught my eye be
cause of an interesting subtitle: "The Bad News: It's
Striking More Young Adults. The Good News: Almost
All Can Be Helped." Talk about a grabber.
I was curious to see what made the editors of
Newsweek decide that depression was a subject of
national interest that merited cover-story treatment
this week — as opposed to last week or even next
week. And I was just dying to know what this "help"
was.

The story cites some disturbing statistics. Depres
sion accounts for 60 percent of all suicides. An esti
mated 30 to 40 million Americans will experience
depressive illness at least once. Most notably, the Na
tional Institutes of Mental Health tell us that the
average age of first onset of the disease (it is now con
sidered a disease, "not to be confused with the 'blahs'
that most people encounter") has dropped dramati
cally since World War 11, from late middle age to
people in their mid-20s to early 30s. In other words,
people like you and me.
Well, OK, I've known for a long time that people like
you and me have problems — big problems — and
probably no set of statistics would surprise me. In
fact, I'm surprised the numbers aren't higher. It's
the guy who never stops smiling that makes me stop
and wonder. But enough of the diagnosis. What's the
cure?
What a disappointment. I couldn't even muster up
a good chuckle. There's a picture of a lady from Texas
being fitted with electrodes for sleep monitoring.
There's a picture of doctors preparing to demon
strate shock therapy with "sophisticated monitoring
equipment." They've even got some fancy
photographs of "dynamic brain mapping," which
measures changes in brain waves prior to and after
treatment. The magazine discussess antidepres
sants such as Elavil and Parnate. On and on: Science
is just making leaps and bounds on this terrible ill
ness. Wrong, wrong, wrong.
The piece lists an impressive array of numbers and
personal instances in which researchers have been
successful. But no matter how well the drugs work
and no matter how well the "dynamic brain map
ping" works, you will not convince me that this is the
right way to go about it.
The problem is that in their haste to discover a
new drug or invent a new machine, these research
ers forgot about us. They forgot about why you and I
get depressed in the first place. They don't mention
that we're scared to death about our futures. They
don't talk about how our parents belittle us, or

worse, ignore us. They don't understand that it's
hard as hell to find a date for the party Friday night
and it's even harder to make lasting relationships.
Peer pressure. School pressure. 1 could go on forever.
So could you.
It's so frustrating to see the reporters of the story
lay out a nice beige box called "Common Symptoms
of Depression." Things such as "thoughts of suicide
and death" and "low self-esteem or guilt" are among
the items. When they notice that Johnny is exhibit
ing one of these symptoms, they whisk him away to
the hospital or shove a drug down his throat. What a
pity that they couldn't take the time to sit down with
Johnny and ask him how his day at school went.
Granted, Johnny might not be able to give a ra
tional reason for his depression. "Well Dad, I got a 'B'
on a math test today and I feel disappointed" or "Yes
Mom, it's true; they decided not to have the Reagan
Library built here at Stanford." The reasons are infi
nitely complex. Sometimes I get depressed just be
cause something isn't as good as I'd like it to be.
Nothing wrong, just maybe nothing particularly
right either. Who knows? But I know that it makes a
difference when someone stops to listen to what I
have to say. Just knowing that someone honestly
gives a damn means more to me than any electrode
ever will.
Now. to be fair, I believe the article is correct when
it presses the point about inheritance and genetic
links. They've got it down to markers on
chromosomes, which is a little outrageous, but I con
sider myself to be a pretty moody person and I'd like
to think that it's all my dad's fault. I am certainly glad
the article was written, even if it did miss the boat. At
least people will talk about it. A scary thought is that
for some people this will be the first time they realize
that depression is such a widespread problem.
That's depressing.
I'll probably be accused of overreacting on this one,
which is probably a legitimate claim. But this is
something that I feel strongly about and I'm going to
go with my stance. By all means, go and seek profes
sional help if you think it will be helpful. There are a
lot of trained people out there who will devote consid
erable time and energy to helping you with your
problems, whatever they may be. (Stanford has a
particularly strong network — everyone from resi
dent assistants to the Bridge is excellent). But it
burns me to no end to hear people jubilantly discuss
this new research that can do wonders once a person
is affected but doesn't do anything for the person
before he's actually diagnosed. It's what Richard
John Neuhaus would call "policy by pathology." or
treatment after the fact.
Perhaps the most depressing thing about the arti
cle is found on page 54. To quote: "A more widely
used treatment is interpersonal therapy. . . . The
basic assumption is that depression, whatever its
cause, takes place in the context of relationships be
tween people. 'The aim is to help patients recognize
their complex, mixed feelings of anger, fear and sad
ness and devise strategies for handling them.' " That

being fitted with electrodes for sleep monitoring.
There's a picture of doctors preparing to demon
strate shock therapy with "sophisticated monitoring
equipment." They've even got some fancy
photographs of "dynamic brain mapping," which
measures changes in brain waves prior to and after
treatment. The magazine discussess antidepres
sants such as Elavil and Parnate. On and on: Science
is just making leaps and bounds on this terrible ill
ness. Wrong, wrong, wrong.
The piece lists an impressive array of numbers and
personal instances in which researchers have been
successful. But no matter how well the drugs work
and no matter how well the "dynamic brain map
ping" works, you will not convince me that this is the
right way to go about it.
The problem is that in their haste to discover a
new drug or invent a new machine, these research
ers forgot about us. They forgot about why you and I
get depressed in the first place. They don't mention
that we're scared to death about our futures. They
don't talk about how our parents belittle us, or

worse, ignore us. They don't understand that it's
hard as hell to find a date for the party Friday night
and it's even harder to make lasting relationships.
Peer pressure. School pressure. 1 could go on forever.
So could you.
It's so frustrating to see the reporters of the story
lay out a nice beige box called "Common Symptoms
of Depression." Things such as "thoughts of suicide
and death" and "low self-esteem or guilt" are among
the items. When they notice that Johnny is exhibit
ing one of these symptoms, they whisk him away to
the hospital or shove a drug down his throat. What a
pity that they couldn't take the time to sit down with
Johnny and ask him how his day at school went.
Granted, Johnny might not be able to give a ra
tional reason for his depression. "Well Dad, I got a 'B'
on a math test today and I feel disappointed" or "Yes
Mom, it's true; they decided not to have the Reagan
Library built here at Stanford." The reasons are infi
nitely complex. Sometimes I get depressed just be
cause something isn't as good as I'd like it to be.
Nothing wrong, just maybe nothing particularly
right either. Who knows? But I know that it makes a
difference when someone stops to listen to what I
have to say. Just knowing that someone honestly
gives a damn means more to me than any electrode
ever will.
Now. to be fair, I believe the article is correct when
it presses the point about inheritance and genetic
links. They've got it down to markers on
chromosomes, which is a little outrageous, but I con
sider myself to be a pretty moody person and I'd like
to think that it's all my dad's fault. I am certainly glad
the article was written, even if it did miss the boat. At
least people will talk about it. A scary thought is that
for some people this will be the first time they realize
that depression is such a widespread problem.
That's depressing.
I'll probably be accused of overreacting on this one,
which is probably a legitimate claim. But this is
something that I feel strongly about and I'm going to
go with my stance. By all means, go and seek profes
sional help if you think it will be helpful. There are a
lot of trained people out there who will devote consid
erable time and energy to helping you with your
problems, whatever they may be. (Stanford has a
particularly strong network — everyone from resi
dent assistants to the Bridge is excellent). But it
burns me to no end to hear people jubilantly discuss
this new research that can do wonders once a person
is affected but doesn't do anything for the person
before he's actually diagnosed. It's what Richard
John Neuhaus would call "policy by pathology." or
treatment after the fact.
Perhaps the most depressing thing about the arti
cle is found on page 54. To quote: "A more widely
used treatment is interpersonal therapy. . . . The
basic assumption is that depression, whatever its
cause, takes place in the context of relationships be
tween people. 'The aim is to help patients recognize
their complex, mixed feelings of anger, fear and sad
ness and devise strategies for handling them.' " That
was found under a section titled, "Touchy Issue."

I rarely get the chance to read current periodicals,
but every so often a magazine will grab my attention
and I just have to read it. The May 4 issue of
Newsweek was such an issue; it featured a big cover
story on depression. The cover caught my eye be
cause of an interesting subtitle: "The Bad News: It's
Striking More Young Adults. The Good News: Almost
All Can Be Helped." Talk about a grabber.
I was curious to see what made the editors of
Newsweek decide that depression was a subject of
national interest that merited cover-story treatment
this week — as opposed to last week or even next
week. And I was just dying to know what this "help"
was.

The story cites some disturbing statistics. Depres
sion accounts for 60 percent of all suicides. An esti
mated 30 to 40 million Americans will experience
depressive illness at least once. Most notably, the Na
tional Institutes of Mental Health tell us that the
average age of first onset of the disease (it is now con
sidered a disease, "not to be confused with the 'blahs'
that most people encounter") has dropped dramati
cally since World War 11, from late middle age to
people in their mid-20s to early 30s. In other words,
people like you and me.
Well, OK, I've known for a long time that people like
you and me have problems — big problems — and
probably no set of statistics would surprise me. In
fact, I'm surprised the numbers aren't higher. It's
the guy who never stops smiling that makes me stop
and wonder. But enough of the diagnosis. What's the
cure?
What a disappointment. I couldn't even muster up
a good chuckle. There's a picture of a lady from Texas
being fitted with electrodes for sleep monitoring.
