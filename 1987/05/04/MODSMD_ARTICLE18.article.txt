promised to be different than a
conventional Stanford party."

attracted some of the 480 guests.
Others attended as an excuse to
reunite with Stanford-in-Oxford
friends. Senior Sarah Russell and
junior Chris Page began the even
ing with a champagne reunion for
their friends from the 1986-87

guests.

Charlotte Jimenez, dressed in
costumes, displayed this kind of
enthusiasm. "We knew it would be
a great party." said the couple.
"We need some new traditions
at Stanford." said junior C.R.
Douglas. "I hope this catches on."
By 11 p.m., most guests had
arrived. The majority bopped to

the music of The Fugitive Guys, a
campus band with a strong
popular repertoire and a lot of
charisma. Junior Carol Demattei
could not stop dancing long
enough to comment on the band,
and her date Don Lee agreed that
"dancing like a madman was the
evening's strong point."
Others sampled ale. vinegar
crisps and mulled wine in the pub
while listening to Four Shillings
Short, a talented madrigal group
whose authentic sound enter
tained the crowd until after mid
night. The hungry partiers made
their way to the cafe, where the
costumed staff served fresh straw
berries, cream and scones on
candlelit tables. Junior Becky
Slipe admitted that she "came for
the scones."
The success of the ball can be at
tributed to the commitment of
Svalstad and her staff. Svalstad
decided to plan the event after at
tending a May extravaganza at St.
Edmund's College, culminating
her three quarters at Oxford.
Svalstad said, "It was the best
party I had ever attended."
While hoping to bring a favorite
Oxford tradition home, Svalstad
emphasized that her aim was not
to relive old memories but to
create a party uniquely Stanfor
dian.
"We tried to make it authentic,
retaining the sense of history and
authenticity by choosing a Re
naissance theme, while ensuring
that a diverse group would enjoy
themselves," explained Svalstad.
Thus, the appropriate attire in
cluded black tie. suits or Renais
sance costume. Svalstad elimin
ated the idea of formal dancing to
add to the relaxed atmosphere.
Publicity proved to be Svalstad's
most difficult challenge. "I wanted
to maintain the sense of secrecy
and surprise while trying to pro
vide an explanation of the tradi
tion of an Oxford ball. People don't
want to buy tickets without
knowing what to expect." Svalstad
noted.
Yet, the high attendance,
though less than that of the Vien
nese Ball, proved that students

were enthused about the new
event.
"We don't know whether or not
this was authentic, but it was a
great party," said freshmen Bren
dan Kelly and Kendra Wisler.
Junior Patrick Walravens
added: "This is something you
don't see around here very often.
There's more of this on the East
Coast. I think it's great." Dressed
as the pope. Walravens won a
prize in the costume contest.
The mood during the costume
pageant exemplified the cama

raderie that pervaded the evening.
Guests seemed willing to overlook
the ball's shortcomings.
Criticism focused on the num
ber of performers and the size of
the event. Freshman Hope
McCarthy commented. "I wished
there had been more performers."
Freshmen Lynne Goldfarb and
Todd Feldman felt that the fortune
teller's predictions were "a bit
generic."
However, freshmen Evan Lurie
and Jacques Slaughter's work on

entertainment added immensely
to the overall atmosphere and
theme. Junior Dawn Sheggeby
congratulated the staff on the
overall success of the event, but
added: "I hope the idea catches on
so that next year, there is less
space and more people."
Svalstad and sophomore Katy
Sarhaindo, the ball's decorations
chairperson, enclosed the ball
area with a fence, to add intimacy
to the large space used, but at
times the party grounds did seem

vast. In general, compliments
outweighed criticisms and
romance as well as enthusiasm
pervaded. One costumed couple
remained embraced on the dance
floor until the music stopped at 2
a.m. Other "survivors" left with
long-stemmed roses from
Svalstad, who handed them to
guests throughout the night. One
of the last to leave the dance floor,
Svalstad waved goodbye to her
guests. Her smile seemed to be the
best gauge of the evening's suc

junior Chris Page began the even
