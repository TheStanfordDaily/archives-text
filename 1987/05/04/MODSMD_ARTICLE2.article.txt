# Equalizers win new COP race
## 
### MONIQUE SCHEER Senior staff writer 
The results are finally in. The
Equalizers won election last week
to the ASSU Council of Presidents,
edging out the second-place Slate
of the Union by 54 votes.
The Plan came in third, followed
by the Philosopher Kings.
The Equalizers had also come
out on top in the original COP
election held April 14 and 15. The
Equalizers ran on a platform
stressing improved communica
tion between students and the
ASSU and greater efficiency
within the senate.
By decision of the ASSU Senate,
the new COP election last week
was conducted using a preferen
tial voting system. According to
the rules of this system, voters
ranked the slates in order of pref
erence, from first to fourth.
The Equalizers were ranked
first by 657 voters, followed by the

Slate of the Union, which received
468 first-place votes. The Plan was
close behind, with 445 votes for
first place.
Ballots for this new election
were counted by hand in three
rounds. In the first round of
counting, the first choice on each
ballot was tallied. The slate with
the fewest number of first-choice
votes was dropped.
Because no slate had received
over a majority the total votes after
this first round of tallying, count
ing continued into a second round
in which the second choice on
each ballot was counted. After this
second round, however, still no
slate had captured over one-half of
the vote, so counting continued
into a third round.
The Philosopher Kings were
eliminated after the first round, in
which they were the first choice of
234 voters.

Members of the Equalizers, Leonard Adler, Maria Canas, Jim Durkin and Roechelle Smith, celebrate soon
after hearing of their victory in the new Council of Presidents election, held Thursday and Friday.
The Equalizers maintained
their strong lead in the second
round of counting. The Plan lost a
little ground in their close race
with the Slate of the Union after
the second round, falling behind
by 49 votes.
In the third and final round of
counting The Equalizers totaled
929 votes and the Slate of the Un
ion totaled 875.
Less than half of those who cast
a vote for a COP slate in the first
election turned out for the second
election.
The ASSU Senate must approve
the results of the election before
they become official, but
Equalizers member Leonard Adler
said, "There should be no reason
on this green earth why the senate
shouldn't approve it."
"I'm glad that if it wasn't us, It
was The Equalizers," said Slate of
the Union member Grant Winfrey.
"I was in favor of having a runoff
between us and The Equalizers
(after the first election) anyway."
Ira Williams, a member of The
Plan, said he felt that the contro
versy over the first election and
the recount might have swayed
the opinions of the voters some
what. "The entire background of
the election was a factor
Adler, Williams and Winfrey all
felt the second election was con
ducted fairly. There is little chance
a recount would produce different
results since the ballots were
counted several times by hand.
