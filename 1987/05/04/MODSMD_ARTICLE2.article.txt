# Equalizers win new COP race
## 
### MONIQUE SCHEER Senior staff writer 
The results are finally in. The
Equalizers won election last week
to the ASSU Council of Presidents,
edging out the second-place Slate
of the Union by 54 votes.
The Plan came in third, followed
by the Philosopher Kings.
The Equalizers had also come
out on top in the original COP
election held April 14 and 15. The
Equalizers ran on a platform
stressing improved communica
tion between students and the
ASSU and greater efficiency
within the senate.
By decision of the ASSU Senate,
the new COP election last week
was conducted using a preferen
tial voting system. According to
the rules of this system, voters
ranked the slates in order of pref
erence, from first to fourth.
The Equalizers were ranked
first by 657 voters, followed by the

Slate of the Union, which received
468 first-place votes. The Plan was
close behind, with 445 votes for
first place.
Ballots for this new election
were counted by hand in three
rounds. In the first round of
counting, the first choice on each
ballot was tallied. The slate with
the fewest number of first-choice
votes was dropped.
Because no slate had received
over a majority the total votes after
this first round of tallying, count
ing continued into a second round
in which the second choice on
each ballot was counted. After this
second round, however, still no
slate had captured over one-half of
the vote, so counting continued
into a third round.
The Philosopher Kings were
eliminated after the first round, in
which they were the first choice of
234 voters.
