## Baseball busts Broncos, ups Pac-10 lead 
### TOM SENF Senior staff writer 
All is well in the world of Stan
ford baseball.
It's not just that the Cardinal of
fense scored runs like people used
to vote In Chicago — early and of
ten — in a 19-2 shelling of Santa
Clara yesterday at Sunken Dia
mond.
It's not Just that Jack McDowell
threw six shutout innings and
took a no-hitter into the fifth to
raise his record to 7-4.
And it's not Just that the Card
inal reserves got their second
chance to play in the last week and
once again took advantage of it.
The real reason for Stanford
fans to celebrate yesterday was
that, without lifting a finger, the
Cardinal now has a stranglehold
on the Pacific 10 Southern Divi
sion race, thanks to the Arizona
Wildcats.
While Stanford was dismantling
the Broncos for the second time in
five days, Arizona was completing
a three-game sweep of UCLA with
a 12-4 win in Tucson. The Bruins
(15-12) now trail the 16-7 Card
inal by three games and. more im
portant. by five in the loss
column.
Stanford's magic number for
clinching its fourth Six-Pac title in
the past five years is now three,
meaning that any combination of
three Cardinal wins and UCLA
losses gives the pennant to Stan
ford.
And considering that the Card
inal's last seven games are against
the league's worst two teams (10-
16 California and 10-14 USC) and

that five of those games are at
home, where Stanford has a 10-1
conference record this year, the
Cardinal Is definitely In the
driver's seat. In fact, nobody else
is even in the car, although UCLA
is still hanging onto the bumper.
"It's kind of amazing, but we'll
take it," McDowell said of the
weekend action in Tucson.
The Wildcats' success was not
completely unexpected by the
Stanford right-hander. "We had a
little vote during the week (about
how the UCLA-Arizona series
would come out)," McDowell said.
"I was the only one who voted for a
sweep, so I guess I'm the winner. I
just had a feeling Arizona would
play well."
One Arizona player had
promised that the Wildcats would
do just that. "When we left
Arizona. (Arizona third baseman)
Chip Hale said to us, 'Don't worry,
we'll take care of UCLA for you,' "
Stanford left fielder Ruben Amaro
said. "I'll have to give him a call
and thank them for picking us
up."
Despite its commanding edge.
Stanford will probably not be able
to back into the title. UCLA closes
its Six-Pac schedule next weekend
against USC, and the Bruins
swept the Trojans earlier in the
season.
"We're gonna have to win some
games. We can't coast into it."
Amaro said. "We need to have
some pretty good momentum
going into regionals."
Inertia did not seem to be a
problem for Stanford yesterday, as

Stanford's Mark Jacobson downed California's Brian Flowers 6-4, 6-4 in singles action
last Friday, and then paired with Jeff Tarango to beat Flowers and Woody Hunt at No. 2
singles, clinching Stanford's 5-4 win.


The Stanford baseball team had more to celebrate than Jeff Saenger's
solo home run in the first inning. With an Arizona sweep of UCLA this

weekend, the Cardinal is now up by three games in the Pacific 10
Southern Division.
