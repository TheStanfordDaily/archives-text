# Men's tennis downs Bears
## 
### JON WEISMAN Staff writer 
Last year, the Stanford men's tennis
team's season ended in victory with a 5-
2 win over Pepperdine in the NCAA
championship title match game at Ath
ens. Ga. While the Cardinal wishes its
fate to be similar this year, it's hoping
that the season-ending victory was not
Friday.
Stanford kept its-slim national tourn
ament hopes alive when the unranked
team of Mark Jacobson and Jeff
Tarango won its No. 2 doubles match
over Woody Hunt and Brian Flowers
(ranked sixth nationally). 6-4. 6-2. to
give Stanford a 5-4 win over California
at Stanford Tennis Stadium.
The Cardinal, tied for 19th in the
latest poll, raised its record to 13-10 and
finished tied for third in the Pacific 10
Sout hern Division with the Bears at 5-5.
"We have a very small outside chance
(of being invited)," Stanford Caoch Dick
Gould said. "The thing that hurts us is
that there are three areas where there
are teams ranked behind us whose
regions will have a representitive."
Those schools, which figure to be Co
lumbia in the East. Utah in the Rocky
Mountains and Oklahoma State in the
Southwest, may push the Cardinal just
outside of the 20-team field that will be
invited. Stanford will continue to
practice as though it is going to Georgia,
however.
The two teams split the six singles
matches, which left Stanford needing to
get two wins against the nation's only
school with two top-10 doubles teams.
Even though Patrick McEnroe and Scott
Moody were easily handled by fifth
ranked Ted Scherman and Steve
DeVries, 6-1, 6-3, Stanford was able to
come back.
Jeff Cathrall. who normally partners

with Eric Peus in third doubles, was
hampered in his singles match by a knee
injury he suffered Thursday, and was
held out of the doubles. That meant
Barry Richards, whom Peus replaced at
No. 6 singles Friday, suddenly had to
step in at doubles.
After rushing to get his toes taped.
Richards teamed up with Peus to defeat
Gerald Yung and Dennis Propp (who
was replacing the flu-ridden Doug
Eisenmann) 6-3. 6-2,
"The first game we got to three-all and
lost a pretty good point," Richards said.
"And we knew after that that we could
just break their serve pretty easily. We
just got on top of their serves the next
three or four games."
"I was really proud of Barry Richards,"
Gould said. "He didn't play singles but
he came back to play solid doubles. It's
hard mentally to get yourself up espe
cially when you've been knocked down a
peg. Barry's done a great job for us all
year."
At that point. Jacobson and Tarango
were up a break in the second set of
their match, leading 3-2. Though Jacob
son downplays any effect the win at No.
3 might have had. he and Tarango did
not lose another game, winning when
Jacobson fired an unreturnable smash.
"Actually, I was trying to concentrate
more on this (match)," Jacobson said re
garding his reaction to Peus and Ric
hards' win. "In the back of my head I
guess I was thinking it was good that
they won. It pumped me up a little extra
bit. (but) if you get too pumped up
sometimes you overhit a lot."
Peus was relieved at the match's end
because after Stanford took a 3-2 lead in
singles, Peus. who was inserted into the
lineup due to his impressive showing at
last week's Pac-10 individuals, lost the
final four games of his match to fall to
Yung. 4-6. 6-3. 6-3.

"I played horribly." Peus said about
his singles performance. "I was tight
and there was no excuse for it â€” I played
terribly. All I can say is that I'm really
really glad that it didn't cost the team a
victory.
"I thought we would win pretty much
for sure at third doubles," he said.
"(But) at one and two. I was a little
worried about tt because they were so
highly ranked. All I can say is that I'm
glad [Jacobson and Tarango] came
through at second doubles because if
not it would have been my fault
definitely."
Stanford quickly fell behind 2-0 after
Cathrall, who was frozen to the baseline
due to his knee injury, was beaten by
Scherman. 6-1. 6-3. and Tarango
(ranked 24th). in his first match at the
No. 2 slot since January, was knocked
off by Hunt (ranked 12th), 6-2, 6-3.
The switch between Tarango and
McEnroe had been debated all week and
was not decided upon until three hours
before the match. Gould consulted
Tarango Friday morning before making
the final decision.
"I didn't want to move him without
getting his feelings on it, because it was
important he be right mentally for his
match," Gould said. "In fairness, except
for his serve, this is the best match I've
seen Woody play."
McEnroe provided justification for the
move by moving the Cardinal out to its
3-2 lead. The 28th-ranked junior won a
first-set tiebreaker over No. 6 Steve
DeVries in impressive fashion.
McEnroe lobbed from behind the
baseline of the ad-court to DeVries at the
net. McEnroe then made DeVries think
he was running to the other side,
causing DeVries to send his overhead
right to McEnroe. McEnroe fended off
the smash and a surprised
DeVrles volleyed into the net.
McEnroe then came back from
being down a break to take the
second set and the match. 7-6 (7-
4). 6-4,
"Pat's playing better and better
and better," Gould said. "It's very
satisfying to see. . . . He's fought
so much adversity this year."
Gould was worried that
McEnroe's singles win would be

lost among the wins by seniors
Moody and Jacobson, who came
out on top in the final home
match of their Stanford careers.
Jacobson played what both he
and Gould considered was his
best tennis In the last "two or
three weeks" In defeating Flowers,
6-4, 6-4. Then, seconds before
McEnroe's win, Moody captured a
tiebreaker against No. 71 Kurt
Streeter to win, 6-4, 7-6.
National tournament bids come
out early next week. The team
competition begins May 16, while
the individual tournament starts
May 21.
