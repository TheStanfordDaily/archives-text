# Track team falls short in Big Meet
## 
### ERIK STEN Editorial staff 
The streak continues.
Going into Saturday's Big Meet at Stanford
Stadium, it had been 16 years since the Card
inal men last beat the California Golden Bears
In the traditional dual-meet confrontation.
Now it will be at least 17 before it happens
again.
Hampered by a couple of key injuries, the
Cardinal put on a valiant effort, but in the end
It wasn't enough, as a stronger and deeper Cal
squad, paced by 12 out of 19 possible first
places and some sizzling sprint times by soph
omore Atlee Mahorn. marched to an easy 100-
63 victory.
In the women's competition the song was
about the same. The Cardinal started quickly,
getting the first two wins of the day as sopho
mores Patty Purpur and Erica Wheeler won the
discus and the Javelin with throws of 51 feet,
one Inch and 166-6 respectively. But. in
dicative of the day. Cal grabbed second and
third in those events and kept the score close
as Stanford's two victories earned the team
only a 10-8 lead.
And from there on out It was all Bears. Be
hind meet records In the long and triple jumps
(20-8 and 1/2 and 43-0 respectively) by the
Bears' Sheila Hudson, the Cal women went on
to win 13 of the remaining 15 events en route
to a decisive 93-50 victory.
After the meet was over, the Cal women
circled the track yelling. "This Is Bear terri
tory." It certainly was: The day belonged to the

Bears. The future, however, may just belong to
the Cardinal.
As one-sided as both meets turned out to be.
both were, nonetheless, improvements over
last year when the Cal had even an easier time
beating the Cardinal.
"Of course, we're not pleased with the
meets," Stanford Asst. Coach Scott Chisam
said. "We'll never be quite pleased unitl we win.
"There were, however, too many things
going right — too many things that say we're
coming back — to think it was all bad. I basi
cally think that we cut the distance in half."
Chisam continued. "From here on out. it will
be a good fight."
Traditionally, the Bears are the stronger
team in dual meets, in which depth counts at
least as much as individual performances,
while the Cardinal excels in bigger
championship-style events, in which a few
strong individuals can post an impressive
amount of points.
Saturday, the Cardinal was somewhere in
between the two extremes. As always, the
Stanford stars picked up expected points: the
distance runners, weight events and high
jumpers all contributed as usual. A key differ
ence. however, was the sprints. Last year, in
the men's competition, the Bears swept the
100. 200 and 400 meters.
Again on Saturday, the Bears, who won both
relays and all three sprints, were the dominant
short distance squad, but this year, the Card
inal scored. Sophomore Brian Small turned a
strong 10.92 to place second in the 100 right
after two other sophomores. Chris Barlow and
James Browne, combined to take second and

third in the 400 with times of 48.54 and 48.58
respectively.
Chisam said that next year, the trio, with
the addition of some sprint recruits and fresh
man Gus Envela (who sat out the meet because
of an injury), should be able to put a much
larger dent in Cal's sprint armor and possibly
open the door to a Stanford win.
"Next year, the meet will even up in a hurry."
Chisam said.
As usual, the Cardinal distance runners
were strong. Three of Stanford's wins and a
third of the team's points in the men's compe
tition came in the 800, 1,500 and 5.000.
Junior Christian Skoog won the 800 in
1:49.06. junior Marc Olesen took the 1.500 in
3:45.63 and senior Charles Alexander won the
5.000 in 14:41.56.
Other Stanford winners were Dave Pickett in
the javelin at 209-9; Deron Lord in the ham
mer at 182-7; Brian Boggess in the shot put at
56-6; and John Gash in the pole vault at 16-9.
In the women's competition, junior Lisa
Bernhagen and freshman Sheila Lenihan
joined Purpur and Wheeler as the only Stan
ford winners of the day. Lenihan won the 400
hurdles with a time of 64.60. Bernhagen tied
her outdoor school record and set a new Big
Meet record in the high jump with a leap of 6-
2.
In the men's high Jump, junior Brian Mar
shall Jumped 7-1 and 1/2. the same height as
Cal's John Morris and Mike Harris. Marshall,
however, was awarded third on misses as the
other two Jumpers didn't miss at the height.

Steve Schadler (center) placed third in the 1,500 meters Saturday
against California, with a time of 3:49.25, while teammate Marc
Olesen (right) won the race with a season-best 3:45.63.
Harris and Morris began a jump
off to determine the winner, but
after two misses at lower heights,
the pair decided to call it a tie.
The Bears also won all four
relays, though in the day's final
event, the men's mile relay, the
Cardinal just missed a victory as
Cal's anchor man, Miguel Tor
rente. stormed to a 47.6 last lap to
just catch Stanford freshman
Peter Kolotouros. It was typical for
the day; the Cardinal was close,
but not quite there.
