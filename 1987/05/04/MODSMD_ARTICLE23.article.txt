# 'Cocky' Cal defeats women's tennis
## 
### KEN STEVENS Senior staff writer 
BERKELEY â€” Seniors Patty Fendick and
Stephanie Savides finished their regular
season careers with a flurry Friday, but their
efforts went for naught as the California
women's tennis team outplayed Stanford at
the bottom of the lineup for the second time
this season to record a 5-4 victory at Helman
Stadium in Berkeley.
The Cardinal finished the regular season
with an 18-4 record. The Bears head into the
NCAA championships with a 24-3 record and
the praise of Stanford Coach Frank Brennan.
"Cal's going to be tough." he said. "I think
they're really getting cocky."
The Bears' confidence has been boosted this
season by a pair of victories against Stanford.
Prior to this year, the Cardinal held a 16-0
career advantage over its cross-Bay rival.
"I don't like to lose to them twice," Brennan
said. "More importantly, I don't like to lose to
them this late in the season."
The Cardinal had reason to be optimistic
heading into Friday's showdown. For the first
time this season, senior Leigh Anne Eldredge
and sophomore Eleni Rossides were in the
singles lineup together. And Kay Tittle, who

missed the match earlier In the year against
Cal, was back in her usual No. 4 spot.
Eldredge and Rossldes. however, were
nowhere near their best Friday. Cals Sharon
Fletcher routed Eldredge 6-2. 6-1 in the No. 5
singles match, and Rossides was beaten 6-2. 6-
3 by Mary Margaret Torres at No. 6 singles.
"I really thought they were a little further
along at this point." Brennan said. "It's really a
question of whether we can get them up to
speed in the next two weeks (before the nation
als begin May 14 in Los Angeles).
"We're still nursing Leigh Anne a little bit."
he added. "She has a little bit of a shoulder
problem now. It will still be another four or five
more days until she can hit serves and over
heads."
In between Eldredge and Rossldes losses,
Fendick and Savides were overwhelming the
Bears' top two players. Karen Shin normally
plays No. 1 for Cal, but she has had no luck
against Fendick, so Bears' Coach Jan Brogan
dropped her to second and matched Alissa
Finerman against Fendick.
"When I saw the lineup. I thought. 'Oh boy.
this is perfect,' " Brennan said. "That put a lot
of pressure on Shin."
Savides put even more pressure on Shin,
pounding her counterpart's high-arching

topspin shots deep into the court, often right
on the lines. The result was a quick 6-2. 6-1
victory in the No. 2 singles match.
Fendick was equally as convincing in her 6-
1. 6-1 win against Finerman. Finerman, a
Pacific 10 Conference singles finalist a week
ago, has been playing her best tenn's of the
year recently, but she was outclassed by the
undefeated Fendick Friday. "What more can
you say about Patty's singles?" Brennan
asked. "She's just cleaning everyone's
kitchen."
Tittle had a chance to give the Cardinal a 3-2
lead as she rebounded from a first-set loss to
take the second set in the No. 4 match against
Cal's Caroline Scherman. But Tittle was
unable to hold her serve throughout the third
set and fell 6-4, 2-6, 6-2. "I thought Kay would
have a better chance against Scherman."
Brennan said. "She just got a little tight. She's
one of my best pressure players."
For a while, the Bears looked like they would
take a 4-2 lead into doubles play. Linda
Oechsle rallied behind an enthusiastic crowd
from a 5-2 second-set deficit to push the Card
inal's Lisa Green to a third set in the No. 3
match. The Stanford freshman survived the
