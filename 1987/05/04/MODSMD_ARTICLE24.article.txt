LOS ANGELES — Wait, don't
be surprised — Stanford was
not In the men's intercollegiate
volleyball championships this
weekend.
UCLA, USC. Penn State and
Ohio State were in the Final
Four, however, and after two
days of competition. No. 1-
ranked Bruins claimed a 12th
national title for head coach A 1
Scates after an emotional 15-
11. 15-2. 16-14 win over the
rival Trojans in the champion
ship match..
No. 2 Penn State, seeded
second in the tournament but
upset by No. 4 USC in the first
semifinal, clinched third by
beating No. 11 Ohio State in

the consolation match.
The action started Friday
night at 5:30 p.m. when the
Trojans met the Nittany Lions
in the first semifinal match.
USC took the first game 15-12,
but the Trojan defense couldn't
handle the hitting of 6-foot-10
sophomore middle blocker
Chris Chase. Penn State pulled
out to a 2-1 1 ead after winning
games two and three 15-9 and
15-5.
USC came back in game four.
The combination of the Lions'
poor passing and the Trojans
tight defense worked in USC's
favor, and the fired-up Trojan
players came back to post 15-
12, 15-9 wins in games four
and five to clinch the match
and a spot in the finals.
