totaling the game scores to find a
winner, Cal had come up empty In
the six previous years of the
match. This time, however, the
Bears came in higher ranked on
both the men's (13th to 19th) and
the women's (4th to sth) sides and
showed that was no fluke by
taking five of six matches.
The match, with an emphasis
placed on fun then competition,
also started a new tradition as
Stanford Coach Dick Gould had to
forfeit his tie to the victors as ten
nis' version of the Axe.

now," he said. "They're expensive
to give away."
The match began with mixed
doubles, as freshman Lisa Green
and senior Geordle McKee took on
Tiffany Silveria and Gerald Yung.
McKee set a standard for fun early,
with a great behlnd-the-back lob
volley that could not be returned,
and after 12 evenly split games, it

was time for a tiebreaker. The
Stanford team started strong,
winning the first three points, but
the Cal team came back, ending
the match 7-6 (7-5) on a Yung
overhead.
Next was men's doubles, with
the No. 1 Cardinal team of senior
Scott Moody and junior Patrick
McEnroe facing Steve DeVries and
Ted Scherman. ranked sth In the
nation. Stanford got up a break at
4-3, but then the Bears broke
back twice for a 6-4 win.
In women's singles, third on the
program, Cal's No. 6 player, Mary
Margaret Torres, had the un
enviable task of taking on Stan
ford senior Patty Fendick. Fendick
Is ranked second nationally and
has lost only two sets on the way
to a 30-0 record this season. Fen
dick came out and Just out-played
Torres in her 6-2 victory. This put
the Cardinal on top 16-15 overall,
but that was Stanford's last hur
rah.
At this point, senior Leigh Anne
Eldredge and junior Kay Tittle
took on Sharon Fletcher and
Caroline Yao. The match was
close, but the Bear tandem pulled
it out in the end by a 7-5 score.
The next match proved the most
exciting as It pitted Stanford
freshman Jeff Tarango against
Woody Hunt. Hunt broke Tarango
In the first game, but Tarango
came back firing winner after win

ner from the baseline to break
back twice. Hunt was then serving
at 0-3, 4-5 but came back to hold
serve, break Tarango and win the
match 7-5.
With the score now 29-26, the
Cardinal needed to win the final
mixed doubles 6-3 to clinch a tie.

Seniors Stephanie Savides and
Mark Jacobson took the court
against Yao and Brian Flowers,
and while Jacobson saved three
break points in the ninth game.
Flowers held in the 10th to end
the 6-4 win and cost Gould his tie.
Despite the loss, Gould was

pleased after the match. "It was
fun," he said. "I enjoyed the match
and I think all the people (in the
stands) did too."
The evening marked the last
home match for seven seniors,
leaving Fendick, Savides and

Eldredge looking forward to the
NCAA tournament, and Jacobson,
Moody, McKee and Andy Sands
hoping for a tournament bid. Fen

the format's great. It's a lot of
fun."
