"Greeks and Romans didn't as
sign hierarchy to people according
to race," according to Howard Uni
versity Prof. Frank Snowden,
keynote speaker at an African
Studies Conference here Satur
day.
Snowden delivered his address,
"Blacks as Seen by Ancient Egyp
tian, Greek and Roman Artists:
An Illustrated Lecture." as part of
the seventh annual spring confer
ence of the Stanford/Berkeley
Joint Center for African Studies.
Stanford Anthropology Prof.
James Gibbs. Co-director of the
center. Introduced Snowden by
emphasizing his work's relevence
to the current Western Culture
debate. "We feel that there is no
one better suited to help sort out
some of the issues than Dr. Snow
den. because he will help us un

derstand the role of early blacks In
history and how and why that role
can be effectively incorporated
Into our University curriculum."
Gibbs said.
In his presentation. Snowden
traced representations of blacks
by Egyptian. Greek and Roman ar
tists from 3,000 B.C. onward, em
phasizing the significant role
blacks played in these cultures
and the ancients' attitudes toward
them.
During his one-hour show,
featuring slides of vases, statues
and other ancient items depicting
blacks, Snowden highlighted that
the physical characteristics of
these blacks of ancient times were
largely the same as those of blacks
today.
Snowden emphasized that
modern scholars often misin
terpret ancient images of blacks.
As an example. Snowden showed

a vase with a black and a white
head on opposite sides, noting
that typical modern interpretation
of this image is that it contrasts
the ugliness of the black with the
beauty of the white. Snowden
rejected such interpretation, in
sisting that such scholars are ap
plying modern prejudices to the
ancient world.
"In short, the pictorial evidence
supports the conclusion of
scholars who think that color and
prejudice did not jaundice the
eyes of ancient artists. There is
nothing to suggest that artists
placed any importance to color of
the skins. The burden of color
prejudice cannot be placed upon
the shoulders of the ancients."
Snowden said.
Discussing the potential Impact
Snowden's research could have on
the Western Culture debate here
at Stanford. Gibbs said. "His

(Snowden's) work focuses on the
role of blacks as a minority In the
classical world, which Is some
thing we need to see more."
Glbbs added that Snowden's
presentation confirmed that there
is a significant amount of material
on blacks in ancient times that
could be used In a Stanford West
ern Culture class.
"At that time, the Greeks and
Romans were aware of the differ
ences, but didn't attach hierarchy
In terms of race. Western Culture
could focus on where and when
prejudices originated. It hasn't al
ways been this way," Gibbs said.
Professor Snowden is the dean
of Howard's College of Liberal Arts
and has been the chairman of the
Classics Department there for 35
years. He has written several
books and has lectured and
researched on African topics
around the world.
