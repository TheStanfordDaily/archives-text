# Police force carding at three campus parties

### LESLIE HATAMIYA Staff writer 
In an attempt to crack down on the amount of underage
drinking on campus, Stanford police requested bartenders
at three campus parties this weekend to check driver's
licenses of all students being served alcohol.
According to Fraternal Affairs Adviser Joe Pisano, this
weekend's police activities were extremely unusual. Al
though it is common practice for the police to respond to
calls when parties become wild or get out of hand, "in the
last two years, I haven't heard of the police ever coming to a
party to check for IDs," he said.
Possible reasons for the crackdown may be connected to
the drowning two weeks ago of junior David Dunshee in
Lagunita. Police suspect that the 20-year-old may have
consumed alcohol at a Zeta Psi fraternity rush party.
When the police told Todd Smith, who organized Satur
day night's "Loro Hocks" party at Florence Moore Hall, to
have bartenders card all individuals being served alcohol,
he asked the police officers "if it had anything to do with
the drowning." The officers replied that it had to do with
that incident, an incident last year in which one freshman

was seriously injured in a fight with two other freshmen
after the three had attended campus Rush parties and "a
lot of other alcohol-related incidents on campus," Smith
said.
Stanford police were unavailable for comment yesterday.
Two police officers approached the bar at the Sigma Chi
fraternity party Friday night and told bartenders to ask for
California driver's licenses from all students being served
alcohol, according to Tom Shoaf, Sigma Chi Rush chair
man.
The police said they were concerned with the minors they
had seen carrying beer in open containers through the
Lasuen Mall area between Mayfield Avenue and the Braun
Music Building, Shoaf said.
At the Beta Theta Phi fraternity party that night, the
police entered the fraternity house just after midnight and
asked if bartenders there were carding to see if the stu
dents being served beer were over 21, said Tom Walsh,
pi'i aiuciit of the fraternity.
"They didn't directly ask us to start checking IDs, but we
closed the bar after they came, since we were running out
of beer,"he said.
When Walsh asked the police officers their reasons for

the sudden crackdown on carding minors, they expressed
concern about the legal liabilities involved with serving al
cohol to students under 21, he said. "But they weren't ter
ribly willing to talk about it," Walsh said.
Smith also said that at the Loro party the officers
reminded him of the legal ramifications involved with ser
ving alcohol to underage students. "They told us that if
anything happens (to a minor to whom they served beer).
'We're going to start citing the organizers of the party.' " he
said.
Using flashlights, police also stopped students who were
drinking alcohol in Lasuen Mall between the Beta and
Sigma Chi parties on Friday night, according to Andy
Schultz. a member of the Betas.
After two police officers carded him. Schultz said he
asked them why they suddenly resorted to carding stu
dents at parties. He said that they replied that "there
haven't been enough cops around to monitor all this un
derage drinking" on campus and that this was an attempt
to control it.
Several students expressed surprise at the police's ac-
tions. "I was a little surprised. It's
never happened since I've lived
here," Walsh said.
At the Loro party, Smith said
that the police "seemed con
cerned, but not aggressive. They
didn't have a vendetta against us.
They didn't try to shut the party
down."
The police "started hassling the
guy at the door about carding for
21 and not just for Stanford ID,"
Smith said.
The idea of having the police in
sist on bartenders checking stu
dent identification concerned
Walsh. "If the police are going to
make a point of doing this on a
regular basis, It'll affect some of
the things [the Betas) do. We'd
have to think pretty carefully
about serving alcohol, since most
students on campus are under
21," he said.
