# SCIR decisions target South African military
## 
### A.J. THOMAS Staff writer 
The Board of Trustees Special Committee
on Investment Responsibility (SCIR) voted
Friday to back shareholder resolutions ur
ging four companies in Stanford's portfolio
to stop selling to the South African police
and military
The resolutions called upon Ford. Chev
ron. Mobil and Texaco to quit selling
automobiles and petroleum products to the
South African government because they
were being used by the militarv and Dolice.
The SCIR also decided to support disin
vestment resolutions for Phelps Dodge.
Tenneco and USX. It voted to abstain on
disinvestment resolutionsby Chevron,
Mobil. Texaco and Sterling Drug and
opposed disinvestment by 3M.
On five of the eight disinvestment resolu
tions. the SCIR followed the unanimous
recommendations of the Committee on In

vestment Responsibility (CIR). The CIR had
recommended backing disinvestment by
Chevron. Mobil and Texaco.
The CIR, a 12-member committee of stu
dents, faculty, staff and alumni, advises the
SCIR on divestment-related matters. The
SCIR makes Stanford's final investment
decisions.
In supporting the Ford resolution, the
CIR said "the image of South African sol
diers killing innocent victims of apartheid
from vehicles produced by American corpo
rations is so appalling that Stanford is
morally obligated to take all steps necessary
to avoid such a tragic scenario."
SCIR Chairman James Gaither said the
decision to follow the ClR's recommenda
tion agrees with past trustee actions.
"Consistently over the last several years
the trustees have been opposed to any of
our portfolio companies giving support to
the enforcers of apartheid laws,"
he said.
Ford's sales to the South African
government consisted mostly of
sedan cars and "not military
equipment." Gaither added.
Typically the government will
order a block of 50 or more cars
without specifying how they will
be used, Gaither explained. "In or
der to stop selling to the police and
military, it's necessary to stop sel

ling to the government."
In a report to the trustees, the
CIR noted with "great alarm" the
"high probability" that Chevron.
Mobil, and Texaco were selling pe
troleum products to the police and
military.
CIR student member Bart
Narter said that because Chevron
and Texaco have been designated
National Key Point companies by
the South African government,
they are required to sell their
products to the government.
The South African government
terms companies National Key
Points that are members of indus

tries deemed crucial to the South
African economy.
Although such firms are not
permitted to disclose the extent of
their sales, it is "widely assumed"
that all three oil companies sell
fuel to the police and military,
Narter said.
Narter said the CIR routinely
considers both a company's ad
herence to the Sullivan Principles
and its strategic Importance to the
South African economy when
making recommendations.
The Sullivan Principles, named
after Rev. Leon Sullivan, are
standards of corporate activity

that promote racial equality. Sul
livan ratings are given on a scale
of I to IV, with I being the best.
Although the oil companies all
have reasonably good Sullivan
ratings, "the oil industry is one
key area where America has
leverage" with South Africa, since
South Africa has no oil reserves of
its own, Narter added.
Because petroleum is so Impor
tant. any company that sells oil to
the South African government is
"enabling that country to main
tain its apartheid regime," said
CIR member Ernie Young, who is

also associate dean of Memorial
Church.
Galther said the SCIR's decision
not to follow all of the ClR's disin
vestment recommendations was
not unusual. While both commit
tees adhere to a policy that "asks
portfolio companies to strongly do
what they can to mitigate the ef
fects of apartheid." they some
times disagree on companies
whose performances are mixed,
he said.
"The differences are on compan
ies that are kind of In the middle
— ones that get lis and Ills on the
Sullivan Principles," Galther said.
