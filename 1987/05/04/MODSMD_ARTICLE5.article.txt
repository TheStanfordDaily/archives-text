# Rap session on gay issues starts off GALA Week
##

Organizers kicked off Gay and Lesbian
Awareness (GALA) Week last night with a
rap session open to the public in the Old
Firehouse.
About 40 people met to talk about oppres
sion. stereotypes and how to survive in a so
ciety that doesn't appreciate gay people. By
week's end. organizers predict that several
hundred students and community mem
bers will sample the GALA Week's program.
It includes films, gay comedy and entertain
ment. and a faculty and alumni reception.
For the past 13 years. GALA Week organi
zers have designed events such as last
night's rap session and a Gay Blue Jeans

Day. scheduled for Thursday, to raise com
munity awareness about gays and lesbians
and to celebrate their sexuality.
"We want to make ourselves visible," said
sophomore Joyce Adams, co-chair of GALA
Week. "In a lot of ways gays and lesbians are
an invisible minority. We want people to
know that we're here and we're OK and
we're normal people."
"Raising consciousness may not be as
fashionable these days, but we mean it in
the old sense of the word." said junior
Daniel Bao. GALA Week co-chair. "We want
people to be understanding of us."
GALA Week is as much an internal
celebration within the gay community here
as it is an outreach project. The
program will end Saturday with a
dance overlooking Lagunita at the
Elliott Program Center, featuring
Eurowave and progressive dance
music. In addition, the Office of
the President will co-sponsor a
faculty and alumni happy hour
Friday, to be followed by a cabaret
group.
"You can have fun and have
awareness at the same time," Bao
said. "Hopefully we'll end with a
blast."
The Stanford Lesbian and Gay
Archives Project is sponsoring two
exhibits to coincide with GALA
Week.
"A Contemporary History of
AIDS at Stanford," a monthlong
exhibit that opened at the Walt
Whitman Bookshop In San Fran
cisco yesterday, features photo
graphs and clippings document
ing responses to the AIDS crisis
on campus since 1981.

Also, books autographed by gay
and lesbian authors who have
visited Stanford are on display at
Meyer Library for the next two
weeks.
Compared with other
campuses, the Stanford commu
nity treats gays better than some
and worse than others, according
to Bao. Discrimination here is not
unusual, he said.
Last quarter, someone put trash
outside Bao's dormitory room. A
sign posted on his door read "Die
faggot," according to Bao, and
across the hallway on the black
board, someone had scrawled "Kill
all homos now."
"That happens every year," Bao
said. "We're lucky we get very few
physical assaults on campus."
Bao said that more people
should know about gays and les
bians, that they exist and that
they have feelings.
"A lot of people on campus have
never met a gay person, and they
should know we're nice people
too," Bao said.
