Organizers kicked off Gay and Lesbian
Awareness (GALA) Week last night with a
rap session open to the public in the Old
Firehouse.
About 40 people met to talk about oppres
sion. stereotypes and how to survive in a so
ciety that doesn't appreciate gay people. By
week's end. organizers predict that several
hundred students and community mem
bers will sample the GALA Week's program.
It includes films, gay comedy and entertain
ment. and a faculty and alumni reception.
For the past 13 years. GALA Week organi
zers have designed events such as last
night's rap session and a Gay Blue Jeans

Day. scheduled for Thursday, to raise com
munity awareness about gays and lesbians
and to celebrate their sexuality.
"We want to make ourselves visible," said
sophomore Joyce Adams, co-chair of GALA
Week. "In a lot of ways gays and lesbians are
an invisible minority. We want people to
know that we're here and we're OK and
we're normal people."
"Raising consciousness may not be as
fashionable these days, but we mean it in
the old sense of the word." said junior
Daniel Bao. GALA Week co-chair. "We want
people to be understanding of us."
GALA Week is as much an internal
celebration within the gay community here
