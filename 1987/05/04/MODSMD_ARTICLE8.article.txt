Nakasone pursues tax reform
MAUI. Hawaii — Prime Minister Yasuhlro Nakasone will return
to Tokyo today Intent on pursuing a tax reform that already has
snarled debate In Parliament for three months, he told reporters
traveling with him here.
Nakasone also disclosed for the first time that he will seek enact
ment "by around August" of a supplementary budget, the center
piece of a 5 trillion yen (*35.7 billion) fiscal expenditure program
designed to expand domestic demand in the economy. The
demand-stimulus package forms the core of promises he made to
President Reagan to cut what the two leaders agreed was a
"politically unsustainable" imbalance in U.S./Japan trade.
The Prime Minister, however, attached priority to tax reform.
"I want very much to achieve it." said Nakasone. whose term as
president of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party expires Oct. 30.
The party post, by tradition, is considered a prerequisite to ser
ving as prime minister.
Nakasone refused to say what he would do to implement the
•35.7 billion program of expansion of growth at home in the likely
event of debate over tax reform again snarling parliamentary
deliberations.
Opposition parties have demanded that Nakasone scrap bills to
Implement a 5 percent value-added sales tax and have Insisted
that any new indirect tax be debated "for two or three years'*
before enactment.
Cuts in income and corporate taxes that he told Reagan he
would carry out will be implemented only as part of overall tax
reform. Including increases in tax revenue through indirect taxes.
Nakasone said. He added that he had made this point clear to ad
ministration leaders in two days of talks in Washington on
Thursday and Friday.
Jordan agrees to peace talks
JERUSALEM — Jordan's prime minister yesterday announced
that his country has agreed to participate in an international
peace conference and challenged Israel's badly divided coalition
government to come to a decision about whether it too is willing to
attend such a forum.
The statement marked Jordan's first official acknowledgement
of reports from Israel that Jordan's King Hussein and Israeli
Foreign Minister Shimon Peres have, through American media
tion efforts, reached some agreement on guidelines for holding
such a conference.
Although it left ambiguous many key issues — among them the
composition of a Palestinian delegation and the participation of
the Soviet Union — the statement was welcomed by sources close
to Peres, who has championed the international conference pro
posal as a vehicle for holding direct peace talks with Jordan.
Those sources said Peres yesterday notified Prime Minister
Yitzhak Shamir in writing that he Intends to raise the issue at
Wednesday's meeting of the 10-member "inner cabinet," Israel's
chief decision-making body.
Peres reportedly hopes to force the national unity government
either to accept the proposal or to break up and hold new elections
that would serve as a referendum on Israel's willingness to enter
such talks.
-. Shamir has. consistently opposed the peace conference plan,
saying such a forum waS designed by Hussein and other Arab
leaders to force Israel into territorial concessions that would
weaken the security of the Jewish state.
Last night's announcement by Prime Minister Zeid Rifai left un
certain whether the Palestine Liberation Organization would play
a role in the proposed conference.
Peace plan showdown looms
JERUSALEM — The Israeli government edged closer to a show
down on the issue of a Middle East peace conference yesterday as
Foreign Minister Shimon Peres formally notified Prime Minister
Yitzhak Shamir that he intends to bring a conference plan to the
Cabinet Wednesday.
In Jordan, meanwhile, Prime Minister Zaid Rifai. in an appar
ent challenge to the Israeli leadership, said that it is "futile" to
continue preparations for such a conference without an Israeli
commitment to participate.
Rifai's statement was quoted in a Jordanian television news
broadcast last night, and was monitored here.
It followed reports by Israeli government sources late last week
that Jordan had agreed to bilateral peace negotiations with Israel
in the context of a Middle East conference, provided that the Is
raeli government formally approve a U.S.-brokered framework for
the talks worked out after months of shuttle diplomacy.
The extent of Jordan's commitment to the American plan was
unclear from Rifai's statement. While he said specifically that
"reports about agreements and contacts recently made are
untrue." he also outlined key positions on an international confer
ence that correspond with the earlier Israeli reports of Jordanian
concessions.
Asked to comment on Rifai's remarks, a senior official close to
Peres said last night: "It's an encouraging statement, and. I think,
evidence for progress. We. too. are of the opinion that Israel has to
take a decision now."
Peres and Shamir are at odds on the conference Issue, and If it
is brought to a Cabinet vote it could break up the fragile coalition
government joining their two major parties.
A meeting between the two men originally scheduled for yester
day was postponed until tomorrow. But a Peres spokesman con
firmed that the Foreign Minister had sent a letter to Shamir an
nouncing that he intends to raise the issue before senior govern
ment ministers in the so-called "inner Cabinet" Wednesday.

news team that staked out Democratic presidential front-runner
Gary Hart's Capitol Hill town house determined that a young
woman from Miami spent Friday night and Saturday with him
while his wife was in Denver.

deal with questions of alleged "womanizing.'' denounced the story
as "preposterous" and "inaccurate." He said he is the victim of

nalism that is "reduced to hiding in bushes, peeking in windows
and personal harassment."

page, said that a team of five Herald and Knight-Ridder reporters
kept the front and rear entrances of Hart's town house under sur
veillance for more than 24 hours from Friday evening until Satur
day night. They said they saw Hart and the woman enter the
house about 11:15 p.m. Friday and saw no one leave or enter until
Hart and the woman came out at about 8:40 p.m. Saturday.
Approached by the reporters later Saturday night. Hart denied
having any "personal relationship" with the woman, denied that
she had spent the night at his house and said that she had come
to Washington to visit friends He said that the woman, identified
by the Hart campaign as Donna Rice, was In his town house for
only a few minutes and that she and a female friend from Miami
had stayed at the home of William Broadhurst. a Washington at
torney and friend of Hart. Telephones at Broadhurst's office and
home were not answered vesterdav.
