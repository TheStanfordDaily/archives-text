# Reagan appeals for contra support
## 
### 
NEW YORK — President Reagan launched a
fresh appeal yesterday for support for the
Ntcaraguan "freedom fighters." but shifted his
emphasis away from military conflict with the
Sandinista regime, stressing Instead the goals
of free elections and democracy.
Bracing for this week's congressional
hearings that are expected to document the
administration's secret role In providing mili
tary aid to the Nicaraguan rebels, known as
contras. Reagan used a speech to the Ameri
can Newspaper Publishers Association to
outline a redefined approach based on
diplomacy, regional economic assistance and
continued support for the rebels.
Speaking on Ellis Island against a backdrop
of the Statue of Liberty. Reagan said. "This ad
ministration's support of the Nicaraguan
freedom fighters in their struggle for peace and
democratic government will not change unless
the regime In Nicaragua accedes to the demo
cratic aspirations of the Nicaraguan people.
"The democratic Nicaraguan resistance, in
cluding the freedom fighters, today offers the
only political alternative to the dictatorship of
the past and the communism of today: that al

ternative Is democracy and it is winning in
creasing support from the people of
Nicaragua." he said.
While stressing the democratic goals of the
contras. Reagan renewed his harsh criticism
of the Sandinista regime, saying that Soviet
weapons shipments "have made the small
country of Nicaragua an aggressor nation with
the largest military machine in Central
America, threatening the security of the entire
region."
In his address, the president described the
rebels as "contras" only once, referring to them
instead as "freedom fighters." He generally
steered clear of their military role, a sharp con
trast to his description of them last year as
giving "their blood and courage" to have
"pinned down the Sandinista army."
This change In tone was described by White
House officials as a deliberate effort to rebuild
support for the rebels in Congress, which last
year approved 8 105 million for them. The
money expires Oct. 1 and officials said the out
look for renewal in the Democratic-controlled
Congress is bleak, particularly with a summer
of hearings on secret administration efforts to

bypass the prohibitions on aid in earlier years.
Reagan has not said how much money he will
seek for the rebels next year.
White House national security adviser Frank
Carlucci said Congress should weigh the
"merits" of supporting the contras aside from
the Iran-contra affair and described them as
"innocent victims. . . . They themselves were
not accused of any wrongdoing.
The congressional hearings are expected to
show that top White House officials attempted
to defy the Boland amendment barring direct
military aid to the rebels by directing a private
supply network and using proceeds from the
Iran arms sales to finance at least pan of It.
Money was also raised from private American
donors, and one fund-raiser, Carl (Spitz)
Channell. last week pleaded guilty to conspir
acy to defraud the government in connection
with the effort.
While Reagan had in the past suggested that
he wanted to overthrow the Sandinistas, yes
terday he defined his goals as a restoration of
democratic principles — including free speech,
free elections and free assembly.
