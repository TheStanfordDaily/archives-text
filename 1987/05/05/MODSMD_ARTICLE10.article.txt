# Larkin dorm funds won't go toward purchase of alcohol

### FRANK QUARATIELLO Staff writer 
Larkin Resident Fellow Bruce
Rosenstock announced a new dor
mitory policy last week stipulating
that dorm funds will no longer be
used to purchase alcohol.
Rosenstock said he was
frustrated by the old alcohol
policy, which allowed alcohol
bought by the all-freshman dorm
at parties. He said the move was
catalyzed by what police believe
was an alcohol-related drowning
of a Stanford junior two weeks
ago.
"We no longer could square it in
our consciences that we would
both be looking on, participating
in and, in some instances, even
purchasing the alcohol for the
party when it was very clear that
that's completely illegal in a fresh
man dorm," Rosenstock said.
Rosenstock announced the new
policy in a letter to all residents.
He said he and the Larkin resident
assistants made the decision after
reaching a consensus on the issue
Wednesday.
The policy restricts how stu
dents can spend their own house
dues, but Rosenstock didn't put
the issue to a house vote because
he and the RAs felt "invested with
responsibility for the entire com
munity's welfare," according to
the letter.
"For a long time, I've been very

upset about the way in which the
alcohol policy has been enforced
in this dorm and in those dorms
that I have some familiarity with,"
Rosenstock said.
Rosenstock said he was worried
about his own liability as well as
the health of students. In the let
ter Rosenstock cited a passage
from a Residential Education pub
lication which states: "It is possi
ble that in the event of a lawsuit
based on a claim that Injury or
death resulted from alcohol use in
the residences, the RFs and RAs
would be sued as individuals act
ing as agents of the University."
The University is also re
examining the campus alcohol
policy in the wake of the student
drowning in Lagunita. Norm Rob
inson, acting dean of student af
fairs, declined to say whether
Larkin's new policy should be a
model for others.
"Raising the issue of alcohol
policy is a very good thing to do,"
Robinson said. "Alcohol policies
are talked about a lot. They are not
concrete and fixed things.
"A balance has to be struck be
tween individual freedom, how
responsibly an individual acts,
and what type of environment the
University wants to maintain," he
said.
Larkin residents expressed
mixed reactions to the policy deci
sion.
Twenty-nine students signed a

statement written by Rosenstock
saying that they supported the
policy decision.
"For the time being, I'm acting
as an advocate for the one-third of
the dormitory that feels it's not
right for dorm funds to be spent
on alcohol," Rosenstock said. "If
we were to go back to the old sys
tem now, I can tell you that a lot of
students will be unhappy."
Many other students were
simply opposed to the fact that
they didn't have a voice In the
decision.
"A lot of people were upset by
the fact that our RF just told us
what to do." said freshman Leah
Clark. "If he had brought it about
the right way, people would have
gone along with it more easily."
"A lot of people were pleased
with the policy," said RA Doug
Bunnell, a junior. But "most
people were annoyed with the ap
proach."
Some students find the new
policy itself insulting. "I don't
really like the policy," said fresh
man David Martinez. "I think
people are responsible enough
that the RF and his staff shouldn't
have to do something like this."
Rosenstock said he wants to
reach an agreement with all stu
dents in the dorm. He is now ask
ing residents for their Input in for
mulating a dorm alcohol policy to
