Up to now, Stanford's selective divestment
policy has been a spotty process at best. Now
the University Board of Trustees has an op
portunity to change that.
Last week the Committee on Investment
Responsibility (CIR) proposed a new policy
that is both more objective and more force
ful. The CIR unanimously recommended
that the trustees automatically divest from
companies that have not signed the Sullivan
Principles or have performed poorly by the
Sullivan standards.
If implemented, the new guidelines could
lead Stanford to sell over $3 million worth of
stock in 10 companies that do business in
South Africa.
In the past, both the CIR and the trustees
have relied on a wide variety of information
and standards in making case-by-case deci
sions on divestment. Because the results ap
pear arbitrary and the process is so slow,
Stanford speaks not with a strong, clear
voice against apartheid but rather with a
muted mumble.
The University's rationale for selectively
divesting instead of making a total break is
that certain companies make a positive dif

ference in South Africa by employing blacks
and actively opposing apartheid.
Adherence to the Sullivan Principles
represents the minimum acceptable stan
dard of performance for companies operating
in South Africa. Companies that don't mea
sure up to even these criteria surely do more
harm than good.
Using objective standards to make these
evaluations would send a much stronger
message to companies in Stanford's
portfolio. It would be unmistakably clear that
the University takes the Sullivan Principles
seriously and that it is not afraid to take a
stand.
Adopting the ClR's suggestions might also
speed the pace of divestment decisions,
which in itself would indicate Stanford is
more concerned.
The trustees' Special Committee on Invest
ment Responsibility (SCIR) will discuss the
ClR's proposals at a meeting Sunday. The
SCIR should decide to take a stronger stand
against apartheid by adopting the ClR's re
commendation â€” a more objective and con
sistent approach to divestment.
