# 'Unwanted' sense hurts
## 
### 
Until I read Amanda Kemp's recent viewpoint
(Daily, April 28) I hadn't fully realized how deep the
feeling of being "unwanted" as a minority under
graduate student went.

AARON JACKSON

It's a bit different being a graduate student. I have
family and friends here with me to ease that feeling
of being alone. I'm not 18 or 19 or away from home
for the first time. And when I was, I was at Howard
University, a black school in Atlanta. Things were
very different at Howard.
While Kemp's article moved me, the real clincher
came when I read the recent viewpoint by Ugo Colella
and Brian Walser (Daily. April 29) on re-examining
racism. I began to understand, at least in part, what
was causing the unwanted feelings.
Colella and Walser made three points that made
me realize why it's difficult to be a minority under
graduate. First, their statement that "the fact that
California has a lot fewer Jews than New York should
be enough to convince anyone, after a moment's
reflection, that this relatively low percentage of
Jewish students is due more to a lack of Jewish ap
plicants than to a conscious effort to exclude them."
That statement implies that Stanford looks for
Jewish applicants but when they don't enroll,
demographics is considered a viable excuse. What
about the unconscious assumptions within the sys
tem that prevent those minority applicants from ap
plying? At Howard, the term was institutionalized
racism — racism without thinking. Which is worse,
conscious racism or unconscious racism? I contend
a tie.
In answer to the argument that nothing requires
Stanford to go beyond demographics, I say that as
the No. 1 undergraduate educational center and re
search institution, Stanford bears a greater obliga
tion to educate all segments of American society.
Second, Colella and Walser stated, "The faculty
have not been trained to lecture on minority issues,
but they have been trained to lecture on philosophy,
history and literature." My problem with this asser
tion is that it implies there is no philosophy, history
or literature in "minority issues."
As a graduate of Howard University, I know differ
ently. Howard is an institution dedicated to making
students aware of how today's culture evolved from
the many others.

Third, they argue, "the second-class status of
women ensured that they could not produce major
works of art or literature, and the lack of contact
with cultures outside of Western Europe ensured
that very few of the works would be transmitted in
tact." Basically they are saying that very little was
done that was worthwhile. And if anything of signifi
cance was done, we don't have a record of it. In short:
unless it's Western European, it's not worth study
ing.

What about the unconscious
assumptions within the sys
tem? Which is worse, con
scious racism or uncon
scious racism?
I contend a tie.

I dispute this claim. The Moreland-Springarn Re
search Center at Howard University has a collection
of books, transcripts and other articles describing
the Afro-American, Caribbean and African experi
ence. The collection has approximately 110,000
items and the earliest book is dated 1573.
Imagine human beings with different values,
beliefs, customs, dreams and philosophies. Do they
not hold value to an intellectual human being? Don't
these works, no matter what the time period, deserve
some study?
Many of you who read Kemp's viewpoint could not
understand the things she said. Her sense of being
unwanted is not often felt by a white student on
Stanford's campus.
Stanford is supposed to be an innovative campus,
so I challenge a task force of white students to enroll
in the Stanford/Howard exchange program for a
year. Study what it is like to be a minority in a class
room and study things that do not involve your an
cestors. Only then will you have an appreciation of
emotional strain placed on the minority students at
this institution. Only then will you understand
Kemp's aching words, "Nigger go home."
