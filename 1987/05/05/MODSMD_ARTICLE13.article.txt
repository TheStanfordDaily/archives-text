# RFs told students to avoid frat
## 
### 
Amid much concern over the proper repre
sentation of minority groups on campus, we at
the Sigma Chi house would like to call the stu
dent body's attention to a most disturbing in
cident involving some of our rushees.
After our three-week Rush process and a
long bid meeting we presented bids to 20 men
we felt would build a diverse, and therefore
strong, pledge class for 1987. On Monday,
April 27, we celebrated with our new group.

Wednesday afternoon, our Rush chairman
had lunch with one of our soon-to-be pledges.
Apparently, he was having second thoughts
about taking his bid and two of his bidded
dormmates shared in his ambivalence. Never
having met with such an occurrence, we sent
some concerned brothers to his dorm.
Trancos. to find out what was going on. What
they discovered was remarkable.
The resident fellows. Tom Bauman and
Martha Feldman. were attempting to convince
their freshmen not to accept their bids. Here is
how they did it:
The day bids came out. two attached fliers
were circulated to the men in Trancos. One
flier was a personal letter from Bauman and
Feldman stating why Trancos residents should
not join a fraternity. One-sided, displaying a
great lack of understanding of fraternities, and
marred with stereotypes and cliches, the text
— to an Insider's eyes — is laughable at best.
The attached flier was Luke Cole's
monumental letter to The Daily last year enti
tled "Fraternities at Stanford are indefen

sible." In propagandic suspension of fair play,
the RFs failed to include the many letters that
answered and discredited much of what Cole
said. Cole claimed he had the right to
"categorically comment" on fraternities be
cause he had been president of Delta Upsilon
Psi.
A friend of mine who is a DU would be the
first to admit major dissimilarities between
our fraternities. We wish Bauman and
Feldman would get to know our fraternity bet
ter so that we can be objectively represented.
Future myopia on their part will only lead to
more close-mindedness.
As if this literature were not enough, the RFs
instructed the resident assistants to convince
the freshmen not to accept their bids. For
three hours, the RAs pressured three future
Sigma Chis to not Join our house.
Their methods were fascinating. The talk
was held behind a closed door. Trancos resi
dents firmly committed in their direction
toward joining Sigma Chi were excluded from
the room. What extremists!
If the RFs were so concerned about the
welfare of their students, why did they not
invite some Sigma Chis to Trancos? We would
have been eager for a proper forum to present
everyone's viewpoints, for a chance to taste
long-forgotten 18th-century liberalism.
After such a forum the freshmen's decision
would have been informed, mature and Judi
cious. Without such a forum, their choices
were tainted by the biases of the RFs.
Another serious problem with this tech
nique of dissuasion is that it was not univer
sally applied. If the RAs are going to talk to one
bidee. thev should talk to them all. Onlv those

Was there any method or
reason behind these dis
suasions?

not completely convinced about joining were
approached.
In addition, only receivers of Sigma Chi bids
were accosted. Two other fraternities gave out
bids in Trancos but their pledges were not
bothered. Is there any method or reason be
hind these dissuasions? We think coercion is
the only one.
The last and most inexcusable problem was
the slanderous misrepresentation of our fra
ternity and its members. "You won't grow as a
person. The Sigma Chls are a homogeneous
and elitist group. Once you join, you're locked
in for good." These were some of the things
said to the concerned freshmen. Childish and
Inaccurate, these labels call to mind a tail
pinned on a donkey's nose. They are not worth
the little bit of ink necessary to refute them.
RFs and RAs. who are some of the most in
fluential people on campus, should avoid such
blatant misuse of their power. A wider perspec
tive of campus life would go a long way toward
arresting such misuses in the future.
We would like to publicly invite Bauman and
Feldman to come by our house to meet us and
to see why we are so proud of what we have
here. Members of fraternities are a residential
minority. Like the members of all minority
groups on campus, we seek fair representa
tion.
