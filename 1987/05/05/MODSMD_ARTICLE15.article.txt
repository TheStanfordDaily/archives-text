# Challenge the faculty

Kudos to Dean of Admissions Jean Fetter and the
new Jordan Scholars Program. It is time for Stanford
to establish such programs that promote the diver
sity and excellence of our undergraduate classes in
important ways.

NORMAN WESSELLS

The faculties of Stanford's three undergraduate
schools — Humanities and Sciences, Engineering
and Earth Sciences — have improved dramatically
since the 19605. More secondary school students in
all sections of the country recognize Stanford's at
tractiveness, so that our 16,000 or so applications
for recent entering classes include a broader spec
trum of applicants than ever before.
But application and admission do not equal
matriculation, especially for that rare group of young
persons with the greatest intellectual and creative
capabilities. The Jordan Scholars Program is one
means — and there should be more — of addressing
this issue.
We continue to assemble on the faculty a group of
persons who are among this country's — and indeed
the world's — leading scholar/teachers. Those per
sons deserve to have the strongest possible under
graduate students in their classrooms, ones who will
challenge and stimulate such faculty and who will be
best able to take advantage of seeing scholarly
creativity at work so that the students' creativity may
be nurtured and disciplined.
Faculty of this sort have among their responsibili
ties the training of scholar/teachers of the future.
That includes attracting a proportion of Stanford's

brightest undergraduates to careers in academia.
Stanford still sends only a small number of our un
dergraduates into the learned disciplines. The Jor
dan Scholars Program, and other such thrusts, may
assure the presence in entering classes of truly gifted
young persons who might consider careers of schol
arship and teaching.
Stanford's undergraduate body still has. perhaps
unjustly, a reputation for nonintellectuallsm. Like it
or not, such an image exists. The Jordan Scholars
Program and other such efforts we design in the fu
ture can help correct that mistaken impression.
Hence, the Jordan Scholars Program joins the mar
velous efforts of Mathematics Profs. Bradley Efron
and Russell Lyons as a means of attracting the very
best undergraduate talents to Stanford.
This university's undergraduate body is elite by
anyone's standards. Egalitarianism is so much a
fabric of our undergraduate culture that the identifi
cation of a subset of entering students as especially
able intellectually or creatively seems threatening.
But the efforts of Jean Fetter and her staff offer the
chance of enriching our undergraduate classes in
ways that will benefit all undergraduate students as
well as our faculty. To be in the presence of minds
just discovering the limits of human knowledge and
how new thoughts can be brought to bear on old
problems is exciting and rewarding for the faculty
and it surely will be for other undergraduates too.
So from this vantage point, congratulations to
Dean Jean Fetter and to ourselves if we are so for
tunate as to attract a significant number of young
persons offered Jordan Scholars positions.
Norman Wessells is the dean of Humanities and
Sciences.
