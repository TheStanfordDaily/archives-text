Remember the
foothills in
the future
Now that the Ronald Reagan
Library Foundation has decided
to leave our beloved shallow swale
to be burnished by the summer
sun, the powers that be should
take this opportunity to reflect on
the Reagan Library fiasco and
come up with policies to ensure
that history is not repeated.
After all, presidents come and
go, but Stanford University
remains. The Stanford faculty,
students and community have
indicated their desire in clear
terms to preserve the foothills in
their current bucolic form until
absolutely required for genuine
academic use.
If these groups had been
thoroughly informed of plans
from the beginning and had their

desires been taken into account,
much time and money would
have been saved and embarrass
ment avoided.
Prof. John Manley's recent
letter (Daily, May 4) shows how
easy it was to keep the planning
process closed to any possible
dissent.
I call upon the Administration
to seize this opportunity to re
think land development policy
and to build into that policy bet
ter opportunities for faculty,
student and community partici
pation.

In memory of
David Dunshee
That there exist many fabulous
memories of Dave Dunshee and
his life at Stanford goes without
saying, and to those who knew

him, things such as hat collec
tions, Pop Tarts, Billy Joel,
Dunkin' Donuts and rugby (just
to name a few) may elicit the
recall of many happy and perhaps
amusing situations.
For each person, the situations
differ, and in consequence, the
memories differ as well. Per
sonally. I wish to remember Dave
for his good humor, but also for
his sharp mind, his passion for
anthropology and archeology and
his respect and kindness toward
other people.
In my opinion, keeping Dave's
memory alive in the hearts of his
friends and in a positive and
lighthearted way is the ideal way
to maintain a pleasant
"connection" with him and
respect what would most likely be
the way in which he would wish
his death to be handled by those
left after him. What elicits much
sadness at present will hopefully
evolve into pleasant nostalgia and
reminiscence.
