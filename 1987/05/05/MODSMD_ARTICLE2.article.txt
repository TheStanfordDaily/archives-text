# Kennedy again says 'no' to forum
## 
### TRACIE THOMPSON Staff writer 
University President Donald
Kennedy said in an interview yes
terday that there-is -"no chance"
that he will change his mind
about participating in a campus
forum on social responsibility
scheduled for later this month.
Kennedy's response to forum
planners was part of a wide
ranging discussion in which he
expressed his views on alcohol
consumption on the campus, the
new Jordan scholars distinction
for incoming freshmen and na
tional press reaction to the loss of
the Reagan Library. The 30-
minute interview will be broadcast

on KZSU today at 7:30 p.m.
On his participation in the
forum. Kennedy said his intention
to sit it out was "made absolutely
clear" to forum organizers during
discussions last fall. "I don't know
why in the world they would resort
to a petition instead of reasoning
it through when it was up for
grabs."
Students and faculty are circu
lating a petition that asks Ken
nedy to reconsider his decision
not to participate in the forum.
Last May, Kennedy and other Uni
versity officials were deluged with
criticism at a similar event, which
was highly critical of the Univer
sity's governance structure.
Regarding the progress of di

vestment from South Africa, Ken
nedy expressed disappointment
with the ASSU Senate's decision
to suspend student participation
in the Committee on Investment
Responsibility (CIR). "I think it's a
little unfortunate that the senate
reacted strongly to a short succes
sion of issues in which the
[Trustees' Special Committee on
Investment Responsibility] didn't
do exactly what it wanted," he
said.
Kennedy also criticized the sen
ate for being vague in its request
that the University improve the
ClR's role. "They say, 'Make the
CIR more meaningful." That's one
of those useful general instruc
tions like Buy low, sell high.' I

don't know how to make [the CIR)
more meaningful. The fact is the
vast majority of the ClR's recom
mendations to the SCIR have been
accepted," Kennedy noted.
On the controversial designa-
Tion of some Stanford applicants
as Jordan scholars, Kennedy did
not give a personal opinion on the
merits of the new program. But he
said that, having taken "straw
votes" at several recent dormitory
appearances, he was struck by the
strongly negative reaction of stu
dents to the selection of a special
group of incoming students.
Asked about the status of the
University's alcohol policy in the
aftermath of the drowning death
of junior David Dunshee. Kennedy
refused to speculate on what
changes might be made.
He did express concern about
campus alcohol consumption in
general. "I still am worried about
the amount of drinking that's
done at some parties at Stanford
and I am worried about the lack of
attention of hosts of parties to
clearly underage drinkers, in par
ticular underage drinkers from off
campus who are coming to those
functions," Kennedy stated.
"We've just got to do something
about that. If carding and making
hosts more responsible doesn't
work then I suppose we're going to
have to find something more
serious," he continued.
On Stanford's loss of the Reagan
Library, Kennedy said that
negative national press reaction
might adversely affect fund
raising for the Centennial cam
paign.
"I think that there are probably
some donors who have a fairly
conservative political persuasion
and who might be themselves in
fluenced by things like the April
30th editorial in The Wall Street
Journal, which is really quite an
inflammatory attack on the
process, accusing us of having
hewn to a liberal orthodoxy in get
ting rid of the library," Kennedy
said.
The newspaper's editorial char
acterized Stanford's faculty as in
tolerant for having criticized the
Reagan Library proposal.
