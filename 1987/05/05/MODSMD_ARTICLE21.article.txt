## Open-mike program successful Road to stardom begins at the Coffee House 
### BRYAN COOPERRIDER 
Stanford students do not have to go far to test their
performing abilities.
It may not be "Star Search" with Ed McMahon, but
open-microphone night at the Coffee House offers
students the chance to share their talent under the
spotlight. Once a month people fill the Coffee House
to hear a mixture of new talent and experienced
performers.
"Open mike has become so popular that we're
thinking of doing it every other week instead of once
a month," said Jeff Lougee. the food service manager
at the Coffee House.
The idea of an open microphone at the Coffee
House arose last year. "We are constantly bombarded
with requests to play." said Lougee. "So we decided
to have a night where anybody can perform.
"We first tried open mike last year during winter
quarter," he said. "It was a dismal failure."
Lougee blamed the failure on lack of promotion
and advertising. In contrast, he said, this year's
open-mike series is highly publicized.
The performances begin at 8:30 p.m. and end at
11 p.m. Sign-up sheets are posted one week in ad
vance. and students who aren't quick have a tough
time getting one of the 20-minute spots.
"The sign-up sheets are usually filled the next
day," Lougee said.
According to Lougee, the talent on any given night

varies greatly. "We get some great stuff and we get
some people who aren't too good," he said.
"We had some guys play the bongos at one open
mike and the place just went crazy. People were
dancing on the tables and going wild. We wanted the
players to come back but we haven't been able to get
hold of them again."
Most of the performers are musicians; there are
very few comedians at open mike. Lougee explained
that it is difficult to be funny in an environment in
which people are not prepared to laugh.

"The only thing we charge (a cover) for is comedy
night, because a comedian needs an audience that is
there specifically to laugh," he said.
The participants, as well as the audience, enjoy the
open-mike nights.
"We like getting up in front of people and singing,"
said Tom Richards, who provided outstanding per
formances both alone and with the group The Bot
tlecaps Wednesday night.
"When I first started performing at open mikes it

was really terrifying. I wondered If all those people
would be happier if I'd just quit singing," said Ric
hards. a senior in economics.
And from a business standpoint, open mike is an
entertaining idea. "People don't want to perform to
an empty room." Lougee said. "So they tell their
friends to come along.
"The Coffee House is pretty much an open stage
anytime," Lougee said. "We're looking for diversity.
We don't want to compete with parties on campus,
but we're trying to offer entertainment for everyone."
However, the open-mike sessions are hampered
somewhat by the fact that there isn't much of a stage
at the Coffee House. There's no equipment for perfor
mances other than one spotlight, which has to
brought in and set up for each performance.
Nevertheless, the program is successful and only
one of a series of events management has designed to
increase student interest in the Coffee House.
Besides open-mike night, the Coffee House spon
sors special performances, comedy nights, a jazz se
ries and — every once in a while — a dance, when all
the tables are cleared out and a rock band is brought
in.
"We're trying to make it a place where the students
can just hang out," Lougee said.
A faculty talent show, to feature a 13-piece jazz
band, is one of the events planned for May. "I've
heard there will be a hard rock band too," Lougee
said.
