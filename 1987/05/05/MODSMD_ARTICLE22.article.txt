## Bug investigates the secret of Chuck Taylor 
### KATHRYN VER PLOEG Staff writer 
Dear Bug Me:
Is this the great coincidence of modern
times, or is there some big-time relationship
between the following:
□ Chuck Taylor Grove on our own Stanford
campus, by the stadium.
□ The guy oj the same name from Stanford
who invented the jump shot (or so claimed
the slide show at Memorial Auditorium
during Orientation).
□ Chuck Taylor on the logo of hi-top canvas
Converse shoes that everybody has in the
weird colors?
- Chuckie T.
What a heroic effort. Very unfortunately, all
three are completely unrelated.

□ Stanford's Chuck Taylor Grove is named
after its football player-turned-head football
coach-turned-athletic director of the early '70s.
□ As Steve Raczynski, co-director of sports in
formation for the Athletic Department, ex
plains, it was in the mid-'3os when Stanford's
three-time Ail-American Hank Luisetti (and
not Chuck Taylor) "almost invented the one
hand push shot — the predecessor to the jump
shot."
□ The Chuck Taylor of Converse fame was a
young fellow in Indiana who worked part time
as a Converse salesperson while moonlighting
as an amateur basketball star. Impressed by
Taylor's on- and off-court loyalty to Converse
All-Stars, Marcus Converse signed Taylor's
name to the All-Stars in 1923, setting Taylor
up for his reign as "Converse's ambassador of
basketball." Taylor went on to a notably non
illustrious career with the Buffalo Germans

and the original New York Celtics.
Dear Bug Me:
My roommate once took that "Earthquakes
and Man" class, and now he's got an attitude
problem - he thinks he's an earthquake god
or something. Yesterday he boldly said that if
you were Jlying over an earthquake in an
airplane you would feel all kinds of tur
bulence and stuff in the airplane. That
sounds just plain silly to me - I mean heck,
the plane's not even in direct contact with the
ground. So what's the word, Bug? If you're in
an airplane Jlying over an earthquake, will
you feel anything?
- Irwin Allen
"Absolutely not," says Dr. Yasu Tasumi, a
visiting scholar at the Blume Earthquake En
gineering Center. So there you go.
