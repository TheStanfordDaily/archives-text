## Baseball stings Division II Hornets, 11-3 
### TOM SENF Senior staff writer 
Continuing to build momentum for Its
stretch run at the Pacific 10 Southern Divi
sion title. Stanford rolled over Sacramento
State 11-3 yesterday at Sunken Diamond.
As it did in its previous two games with
Santa Clara, the Cardinal put this one away
early by spurting to a 9-0 lead after five in
nings and cruising to the victory, its 38th of
the season against 14 losses.
Yesterday's win was more impressive
than it might first appear. Sacramento
State entered the game with a 37-21 record
and a No. 7 national ranking among Divi
sion II schools.
The Hornets had also compiled a 18-11
mark against Division I competition, in
cluding four wins in five games against
Santa Clara, a three-game sweep of St.
Mary's (today's Stanford opponent at 2:30
p.m. in Moraga) and a two-game split with
the No. 2 team in the nation, Pepperdine.
But despite the fact that Pepperdine is
ranked higher than Stanford (the Cardinal
is rated third by Baseball America and sixth
by ESPN/Collegiate Baseball), Sacramento
State Coach John Smith believes that the
superior team resides in Sunken Diamond.
"They're the class of the Division I teams
we've played," Smith said. "We hadn't been
thrashed by a Division I team all year until
today."
"The last couple of days we've swung the
bat well, played good defense and thrown
the ball over the plate," Stanford Coach
Mark Marquess said. "Today we did every
thing right, so we're real pleased."
An unlikely source sparked a two-run
Cardinal uprising against Hornet starter
Dennis Tafoye in the first.
Because center fielder Tol Cook was
taking a midterm, reserve sophomore out
fielder Garry Sawka got the first start of his
Stanford career. He made the most of it,
lashing a leadoff triple to right-center and
scoring on David Esquer's single. Esquer
later scored on a Jeff Saenger base hit.
"I was real surprised to be starting my
first game in the leadoff spot," said Sawka,
who didn't find out he was in the lineup un
til just before game time. "I had some big
shoes to fill."

He didn't have to fill them for long be
cause Cook returned in time to play in the
top of the third. In the bottom of the inning.
Cook hit a double just to the right of where
Sawka's ball went to ignite a four-run rally.
First baseman Ron Witmeyer. as has
become his custom, delivered a key hit — a
two-out, two-run single to right on the first
pitch from reliever Mike Frame that put
Stanford ahead 6-0.
A 1 Osuna kept the Hornets in check for
the first five innings, but it was not easy.
The senior left-hander gave up six hits and
a walk but kept Sacramento State off the
scoreboard with the help of three double
plays.
"I wasn't real sharp, but the double plays
saved me," Osuna said. "If I hadn't had
those, they probably would have gotten
three runs off me."
"He got the ground ball when he needed it
and came up with the big pitch when he
needed it," Marquess said.
In the fourth and fifth innings, the big
pitch was the changeup, as Osuna got two
right-handed batters to pull the ball to
Esquer at short. "If you can throw some
thing different than a fastball on a fastball
count, sometimes you can get a roller or a
groundball." Osuna said.
After the Cardinal got three more in the
bottom of the fifth, the Hornets finally
broke through against Osuna when hefty
first baseman Kevin Creamer reached him
for a solo homer to center. Still, Osuna
finished the inning to raise his record to 7-
2 before turning things over to Rob Was
senaar, who pitched two scoreless innings.
Steve Chitren closed things out, but not
before allowing a two-run double in the
ninth to Tony Hill.
Osuna's second-straight winning perfor
mance as a starter — the first came April 25
against Arizona State — may have earned
him a spot in the Stanford rotation, but
Marquess would confirm only Jack
McDowell and Lee Plemel as starters for this
weekend's four-game series with California.
Osuna indicated he would like to get a
start this weekend but that, being Stan
ford's only southpaw, it is likely he will be
called on a couple times in relief against

left-handed batters.
"Cal's got a lot of lefties, and
with UCLA losing (three straight
to Arizona last weekend), we're
gonna try to win as many we can
as quick as we can, so we may just

throw everybody at them," Osuna
said.
Marquess is not planning to
throw everybody at St. Mary's
today, but a number of pitchers
should see action.
Card notes
Like Sawka, senior Dave Nelson was
in the starting lineup for the first time
yesterday, which would have been

great had he been at the ballpark.
Because Saenger was taking the
same test as Cook. Marquess didn't
want to risk losing his starting desig
nated hitter If Saenger did not arrive
before his first at-bat, so Marquess
penciled in Nelson instead. Saenger
did end up making it in time to bat in
the first.
The Hornets were impressive of
fensively. banging out 11 hits.
Creamer had three of them to push
his average over .400, a remarkable

feat considering his bulk makes it vir
tually Impossible for him to get a
cheap hit.
An example of this came in the
eighth when Creamer was thrown out
on a chopper to third that most
players would have beaten out easily.
Third baseman Brian Johnson did
make a good scoop and throw, but
Creamer would have been safe had he
not been running like he was carrying
a piano, which, in terms of weight, he
may have been.

and a No. 7 national ranking among Divi
sion II schools.
The Hornets had also compiled a 18-11
mark against Division I competition, in
cluding four wins in five games against
Santa Clara, a three-game sweep of St.
Mary's (today's Stanford opponent at 2:30
p.m. in Moraga) and a two-game split with
the No. 2 team in the nation, Pepperdine.
But despite the fact that Pepperdine is
ranked higher than Stanford (the Cardinal
is rated third by Baseball America and sixth
by ESPN/Collegiate Baseball), Sacramento
State Coach John Smith believes that the
superior team resides in Sunken Diamond.
"They're the class of the Division I teams
we've played," Smith said. "We hadn't been
thrashed by a Division I team all year until
today."
"The last couple of days we've swung the
bat well, played good defense and thrown
the ball over the plate," Stanford Coach
Mark Marquess said. "Today we did every
thing right, so we're real pleased."
An unlikely source sparked a two-run
Cardinal uprising against Hornet starter
Dennis Tafoye in the first.
Because center fielder Tol Cook was
taking a midterm, reserve sophomore out
fielder Garry Sawka got the first start of his
Stanford career. He made the most of it,
lashing a leadoff triple to right-center and
scoring on David Esquer's single. Esquer
later scored on a Jeff Saenger base hit.
"I was real surprised to be starting my
first game in the leadoff spot," said Sawka,
who didn't find out he was in the lineup un
til just before game time. "I had some big
shoes to fill."

He didn't have to fill them for long be
cause Cook returned in time to play in the
top of the third. In the bottom of the inning.
Cook hit a double just to the right of where
Sawka's ball went to ignite a four-run rally.
First baseman Ron Witmeyer. as has
become his custom, delivered a key hit — a
two-out, two-run single to right on the first
pitch from reliever Mike Frame that put
Stanford ahead 6-0.
A 1 Osuna kept the Hornets in check for
the first five innings, but it was not easy.
The senior left-hander gave up six hits and
a walk but kept Sacramento State off the
scoreboard with the help of three double
plays.
"I wasn't real sharp, but the double plays
saved me," Osuna said. "If I hadn't had
those, they probably would have gotten
three runs off me."
"He got the ground ball when he needed it
and came up with the big pitch when he
needed it," Marquess said.
In the fourth and fifth innings, the big
pitch was the changeup, as Osuna got two
right-handed batters to pull the ball to
Esquer at short. "If you can throw some
thing different than a fastball on a fastball
count, sometimes you can get a roller or a
groundball." Osuna said.
After the Cardinal got three more in the
bottom of the fifth, the Hornets finally
broke through against Osuna when hefty
first baseman Kevin Creamer reached him
for a solo homer to center. Still, Osuna
finished the inning to raise his record to 7-
2 before turning things over to Rob Was
senaar, who pitched two scoreless innings.
Steve Chitren closed things out, but not
before allowing a two-run double in the
ninth to Tony Hill.
Osuna's second-straight winning perfor
mance as a starter — the first came April 25
against Arizona State — may have earned
him a spot in the Stanford rotation, but
Marquess would confirm only Jack
McDowell and Lee Plemel as starters for this
weekend's four-game series with California.
Osuna indicated he would like to get a
start this weekend but that, being Stan
ford's only southpaw, it is likely he will be
called on a couple times in relief against

Marquess is not planning to

today, but a number of pitchers
should see action.

on a chopper to third that most

Third baseman Brian Johnson did
make a good scoop and throw, but
Creamer would have been safe had he
not been running like he was carrying

may have been.
Continuing to build momentum for Its
stretch run at the Pacific 10 Southern Divi
sion title. Stanford rolled over Sacramento
State 11-3 yesterday at Sunken Diamond.
As it did in its previous two games with
Santa Clara, the Cardinal put this one away
early by spurting to a 9-0 lead after five in
nings and cruising to the victory, its 38th of
the season against 14 losses.
