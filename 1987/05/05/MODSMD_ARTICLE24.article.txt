# With two rounds complete, men's golf in eighth place
## 
### ROBERT PORTNOY Staff writer 
If the Cardinal men's golf team
had only played in the afternoon
yesterday at the Pacific 10 Confer
ence Championships in Eugene,
Ore., it would be right up there
with the leaders.
Unfortunately, everyone played
36 holes, and Stanford will spend
the final two rounds attempting to
recover from the first 18.
"The morning was the key. We
played really poorly in the morn
ing. After we got through the
original bit. we played a lot better
and everyone played a lot worse.
Brad Benbrook shot even-par and
Roger Miraglia and Steve White
shot 2-over-par in the afternoon,"
Stanford Coach Tim Schaaf said.
The Cardinal shot 760 over the
two rounds, good for eighth place,
12 strokes behind seventh-place
California. UCLA leads the tourna

ment by eight strokes over ASU, a
lead that would've been 14 were It
not for strange circumstances in
volving Stanford freshman Mark
Funseth.
Both Funseth and UCLA's Kevin
Leach were disqualified for the
second round because they mis
reported scores on their
scorecards. Leach reported both
the golfers' scores, as the two
played the second 18 together. Yet
Leach neglected to check his own
scorecard, and Funseth did not
check his over before it was
turned in. It cost Stanford only
one stroke, but UCLA wound up
having to count a 77 instead of the
actual 71 that Leach shot in the
second round. The disqualifica
tion eliminates the two from the
individual competition, though
they both may still post scores for
their respective teams. That is sig
nificant for Leach, who with a 71
would have been only five strokes

off the lead.
"He just signed an incorrect
scorecard on the second round.
He had the right score for the
round, but the wrong score for
one hole. It's the players' responsi
bility to check them." Schaaf said.
Bob Laskin is atop the individ
ual heap at 141, with Cal's John
Hummelt at 143. Steve Rintoul of
Oregon also carded 143, while
Robert Gamez of Arizona. Jim
Strickland of ASU and Ben Furth
of Cal all shot 144. In the team
competition, Arizona trails
second-place ASU by three shots,
and USC is another six back tied
with Oregon. Washington is an
other two shots behind.
The Cardinal leads the two
teams it was expected to lead,
Oregon State and Washington
State, but it has also played even
with Cal, Washington and Oregon

After the first day of the Pacific 10 Conference Championships in Eugene, Ore., the men's golf team is cur
rently in eighth place. After playing two rounds yesterday the Cardinal is 33 strokes behind tournament
leading UCLA
on several occasions this season.
"I'm relatively happy with the
second round, and I'm fairly opti
mistic about catching all those
teams. It's just a question of self
respect. These are the teams that
will be around without graduating
anybody next year. It's the confer
ence tournament, the most impor
tant tournament of the year
outside of the nationals, and it's
the best conference in the
country. A top-five finish here
would be an excellent accomplish

ment." Schaaf said.
Stanford's individual scores
were topped by freshman Steve
White's 149. Brad Benbrook, also
a freshman, shot 151, as did
sophomores Brad Geer and Roger
Miraglia. Sophomore John Mahon
posted 151 and Funseth shot 84
and the disqualified 77. The iour
scores of 151 or better is the first
time that's happened this season.
The tournament will continue
tomorrow with the final round
scheduled to take place on Wed
nesday. At this point, even with
the six-stroke loss due to dis
qualification. UCLA looks hard to
beat.
