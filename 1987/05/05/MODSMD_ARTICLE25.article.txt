# Sailing ends season with seventh-place finish
## 
### HUGH R. BETHELL Editorial staff 
Although the Stanford women's
sailing team did not qualify for the
national championships at this
weekend's Pacific Coast Women's
Championship, its performance
did leave Stanford Coach Blake
Middleton excited about the fu
ture.
"We went in with two relatively
inexperienced skippers who
hadn't had much practice this
spring, but we turned in a very im
pressive performance anyway.
Our women's team has tremen
dous potential for the future."
Middleton said.
The Card women's team placed
seventh in the San Diego regatta,
a respectable finish in what Mid
dleton termed "a really talented
fleet." San Diego State won the
regatta, followed by Orange Coast
College. UC-Irvine and California.
Sailing for Stanford were two
pairs, sophomore D.J. Bernstein
and junior Gina Ottoboni. and
freshman Kim Grose and sopho
more Amy Baltzer. Neither duo
had sailed together in a regatta
before this weekend, and neither
skipper had much time to practice
before sailing with the new crews.
Grose only Joined the team this
spring, and Bernstein had not
sailed with the team since last fall.
Still. Middleton was impressed
with both pairs. After a slow start,
in which the crews and skippers
grew accustomed to each other,
both groups, he said, improved
rapidly.

"D.J. and Gina started out
looking a little rusty, but came on
strongly through the whole
regatta. By the end of the weekend
D.J. was sailing even better than
she was last fall, and Gina was
showing that she's one of our top
crews.
"For Kim and Amy, their relative
inexperience was a problem. Kim
had never skippered before the
week prior to the regatta. Despite
that, she and Amy spent a lot of
time in the lead during their
races, and only lost to skippers
who are on the All-America level.
They had a lot of top-five finishes."
Middleton said.
The top two or three finishers at
this weekend's event will go on to
compete at the national cham
pionships in King's Point. N.Y., at
the end of this month. In Grose's
mind, there was no shame in
finishing behind those that will be
heading east. Overall, the fresh
man was pleased with the team's
performance.
"1 was really impressed by the
competition. It was obvious that
most of them had been sailing in
these type of boats for a long time.
With a year's more practice. I
think we will be more on their level
next time." Grose said.
Middleton agreed. "I'm excited
about the future of our women's
team. D.J. had a really good
regatta, and Kim looks like a
rising star in our program. To
gether they represent real poten
tial for the future. They were inex
perienced sailors racing in a top
flight fleet, but they still did very
well," Middleton said.
