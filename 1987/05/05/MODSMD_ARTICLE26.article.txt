### 
PHILADELPHIA (AP) - Ilkka
Sinisalo's second goal of the game,
coming 9:11 Into overtime, gave
the Philadelphia Flyers a 4-3 vic
tory over the Montreal Canadiens
in last night's opening game of
their NHL semifinal playoff series.
The best-of-seven Wales Confer
ence final resumes with Game 2
tomorrow in Philadelphia.
Sinisalo scored his winning goal
when he jammed the puck
through a mass of bodies in front
of the net. Peter Zezel had brought
the puck around from behind the
net and took two shots that were
stopped by goaltender Brian
Hayward. Sinisalo drove the puck
under the sprawled bodies of
defenseman Chris Chelios and
Hayward where it just managed to
trickle over the goal line.
The Canadiens apparently felt
the play should have been
whistled dead and protested vehe
mently to referee Terry Gregson,
but the protest was to no avail as
Gregson held firm on his ruling.
Bobby Smith scored at 7:15 of

the third period to give the defend
ing Stanley Cup champion
Canadiens a 3-2 lead. But Derrick
Smith tied It with 3:51 left in
regulation time. After taking a
pass from Don Nachbaur, Smith
scored from the top of the left
faceoff circle with a slapshot into
the far side of the net.
Smith's goal came just minutes
after the Flyers brought the crowd
of 17.222 at The Spectrum to its
feet on the goal by Sinisalo at 5:49
on a classic 2-on-l break with
Brian Propp.
Defenseman Mark Howe had
cleared the puck from his zone to
Sinisalo as Montreal defenseman
Petr Svoboda dived to stop the
pass. Sinisalo came roaring down
the right side and passed to
Propp. who faked Hayward out of
the net and fed across the slot to
Sinisalo. who put the puck into an
open net.
Propp had scored a first-period
goal for Philadelphia, and Shane
Corson had countered for
Montreal in this first playoff

meeting between the teams since
1976. The Canadiens. who hold
two playoff series triumphs over
the Flyers, came into the game
with eight straight postseason vic
tories over Philadelphia, dating
back to 1973.
The teams, who had met only
three times during the regular
season — for the last time on
March 14 — both played
tentatively in the first period as
they appeared to be feeling each
other out like boxers.
It wasn't until late in the period
that any goals were scored, and
the Flyers, who had a 2-0-1 record
against Montreal this season,
struck first on a power play.
With Corson off the ice for
roughing. Propp gave the Flyers a
lead with a 25-footer from the
right faceoff circle at 17:51. Propp
scored his sixth goal of the
playoffs after taking a cross-ice
pass from Doug Crossman,
beating Hayward with a hard shot
over his left shoulder.
The Canadiens tied it at 19:26

on a power-play goal by Corson.
The Montreal left wing did most
of the work on the play when he
retrieved the puck behind the net
and passed out to Mats Naslund
along the right boards. Naslund
flipped the puck to Chelios at the
blue line as Corson swung toward
the net.
Chelios moved in a couple of feet
and fired a shot that Corson
deflected from the side of the net
for his sixth goal of the playoffs.
It wasn't until 18:25 of the
second period that another goal
was scored. This one came on a
shot from the slot by Walter, who
got his seventh goal of the
playoffs.
Svoboda had shot from the left
faceoff circle and Hextall came out
to make the stop. However, Hextall
was tangled in a mass of bodies in
front of the net and tripped trying
to get back into position. When
Walter shot, the puck hit Marsh
and bounced over Hextall into the
net.
