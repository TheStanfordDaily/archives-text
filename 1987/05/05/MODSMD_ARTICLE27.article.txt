# Bronco batters deadly to Card
## 
### EVAN TUCHINSKY Staff writer 
Last weekend. Lady Luck
seemed to be on vacation for
the Stanford Softball team.
The Cardinal, 20-2 before a
doubleheader against Santa
Clara last Saturday at Baylands
Field, was beaten by the
Broncos 10-3 and 8-3 In two
contests in which the visiting
team held the monopoly on
good fortune.
Santa Clara Is currently In
fifth place in the West Coast
Athletic Conference. Since
Stanford is an unaffiliated club
team, this weekend's competi
tion had no bearing on the
Broncos' league status.
For Stanford, the defeats
meant disruption of the club's
seven-game winning streak.
The previous series of con
secutive victories was 13 at the
start of the season.
"We kind of had a hard time
this week," Stanford Coach
Tami Brown said. "We had a
bad day, we didn't execute as
well as usual.
"It's just one of those things.
You can't win every time."
The outlook seemed promis
ing for the Cardinal at the start
of the first game. "We were
ahead 2-0. There was an error
in the outfield, and two runs
scored," freshman short
stop/catcher Barcy Fisher said.
"From there it went downhill."
Santa Clara won the game
10-3 and held an 8-0 lead until
the bottom of the ninth inning
in the second game, when
Stanford averted the shutout
by scoring three runs. "They
never gave up to the very last,"
Brown said of her players.
"That shows a lot of character."
"In the last inning we really
rallied," Fisher said. "I had a
triple, and someone else hit me
in."
The bottom line Saturday
was, in fact, offense. "We didn't
hit the ball and they did,"

pitcher Dawn Becker, a law stu
dent, said. "A lot of the breaks
went their way. They were hit
ting a lot of balls that took bad
hops and finding open spots to
hit the ball."
"We had some bad breaks
and bad calls that went against
us," Brown added. "They hit
some Texas leaguers and dinks
that landed in."
The Cardinal hit a good num
ber of balls as well, but unfor
tunately not many counted.
"Laura Buchanan hit a home
run in the first game (her
second this year as well as In
her college career)," said Fis
her, the Cardinal's leading hit
ter. "Via Brookshire kept hit
ting these amazing bullets, but
somehow they kept grabbing
them."
"Their batting averages don't
show how well they hit," Brown
added. "We hit shots all day,
but Santa Clara came up with
them."
The coach chalked the losses
up to experience, and is eager
to move on. "It shows we have a
lot of work to do, but it gave us
good experience. We'll do better
against St. Mary's."
The Gaels come to Stanford
today for a doubleheader at
Baylands Field. "We don't know
much about St. Mary's," Brown
said. "We're going to go in and
play our game. We want to
come out with a great attitude
and put pressure on them early
on."
This afternoon's contest
could be the last of the season
for the Stanford softballers.
"People won't play us," Brown
noted. "I would like to play
more games but people keep
canceling.
"We have never won 20
games before. The most we've
won in a year, when we played
67 games, Is 10. Now we've won
20 out of 24.
"Teams won't play us be
cause they know how well we
play and that we hit well," the
rookie coach added.
