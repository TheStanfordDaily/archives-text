The best weather of the year.
The gorgeous Stanford Golf
Course. Local and national
celebrities for all tastes. The Stan
ford women's golf team. And al
most >40,000 for Stanford
women's athletics.
That's what could be found yes
terday at the eighth annual Card
inal Club Jim Plunkett Celebri
ty/Amateur Benefit Golf Tourna
ment.
With a cast of characters headed
by the likes of John Madden,
Willie McCovey, Tom Flores, Gerln
Veris, Ken Margerum, Rich Kelley,
Dave Dalby and Delvin Williams,
Plunkett put on his yearly show in
grand fashion.
"I have a tournament of my own.
I know what it takes to put one of
these on, and Jim does a terrific
job," McCovey said.
After a full day of golf, which
was held In a scramble format in
which each foursome is a team
and all the players play their next
shot from the position of the best
previous ball, speakers, prizes, an
auction and a raffle were the order
of business over a prime rib din
ner. Madden, the main speaker for
the evening, was as irrepressible
as ever.
"Golf is a dumb game. The big
guys hit dribblers and the little
guys hit it a long way. How do they
do it? Something called rhythm. If
they took that down into a stance
in the NFL, they'd come out with
their rhythm in their ear," Mad
den quipped.
Flores was very brief — he had
to catch a plane — but equally en
tertaining in talking about his
quarterback Plunkett.

"You'd think a quarterback who
wants to come back and play this
year would have let me win the
goddamn tournament," Flores
joked.
The actual winners of the tourn
ament were Cardinal senior Kath
leen McCarthy and her three
playing partners. The group shot
55 to best Stanford Coach Tim
Baldwin's team, which ended with
a 59 for the tournament.
"I think I'm going to adjust my
score," kidded Plunkett about his
team's 61 mark after learning the
score of McCarthy's team.
"I can't believe they're walking
up here in the daylight (to get
their trophies)," he mused while
handing out prizes for the top 16
places.
Prizes for the tournament and
the raffle included tennis and golf
lessons, a Sony watchman and
portable compact disc player and
copies of John Madden's book,
"One Knee Equals Two Feet."
When Plunkett asked Madden why
the book was so hard to find, Mad
den said, "They're going like
hotcakes." Auctioned off was a
limousine tour of the wine
country.
The tournament was conceived
by Plunkett. Peg Phelps, who
founded the Cardinal Club 10
years ago, and Nancy Ditz, a
former Stanford track star. The
goal was to provide funding for
women's athletic scholarships.
"It's turned into one of the real
happenings on the Peninsula. It's
the most successful one-day fund
raiser in the Bay Area. There are
always great celebrities — '49ers,
Madden, Dinah Shore a few years
ago. The (Stanford) girls play in it
as celebrities, and all the people
treat them as such," Baldwin said.
