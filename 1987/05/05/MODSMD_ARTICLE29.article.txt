# Old tickets return to haunt drivers
## 
### DIANE BISGEIER Senior staff writer 
Stanford parking scofflaws
are in double jeopardy.
Due to an old accounting
mix-up, Vertical Management
Systems, Inc., has been send
ing parking violators notices
which request payment of fines
already paid.
To top it off, most of the
notices pertain to tickets
received over a year ago and
demand excessive late fees. All
Fotowat-Ahmady. a graduate
student in electrical engineer
ing. said he received a notice
requesting *110 for two tickets
he received 16 and 13 months
ago.
"I originally did pay *11 for
each of them," Fotowat-
Ahmady said. "I sent a letter to
them asking them to check
their records. If that doesn't
work, I have to pay the Stanford
Credit Union *3 for each can
celed check in order to prove
that I paid the citations."
According to Kim Carlyom of
Vertical Management, the prob
lem can be attributed to

Datacom, the agency Stanford
used until last September.
"Datacom never credited these
people and now we are trying to
clear up the backlog of
records."
Carlyom also said that the of
ten illegible handwriting of the
police officers on the citations
causes confusion. "This can
lead to incorrect data entry."
she said.
Fotowat-Ahmady said that a
similar situation occurred on
campus about five years ago. "I
think they don't have good
computers over there. They just
don't know what they're doing,
and the computers don't
preserve good records." he said.
Carlyom urged that
recipients of citations mail
checks along with a copy of the
citation. "We've had numerous
complaints because of this."
she said. "A payment comes in
and we have to determine if it is
on time or late. Unless we have
their copy with the date of is
suance, we have to put the
money into a bogus account,
and then they will get a late
notice."
