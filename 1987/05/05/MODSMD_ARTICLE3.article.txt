## 
### JOHN LIS Editorial staff 
Stanford police yesterday released a composite
drawing of a man suspected of having assaulted two
women on campus last month in separate incidents
near the Physics Tank.
According to Sgt. Timothy Hanrahan, the victim of
the first assault saw the assailant again April 23
walking on the service road between Branner Hall
and Manzanita Park that connects the Toyon Eating
Clubs with Escondido Road. She was then able to
help police put together the composite sketch, which
was produced using a computer at the Los Altos
Police Department.
The first assault took place April 8 between the
Tank and the Earth Sciences Building around 6:45
p.m. The victim, a Stanford student, was grabbed
from behind and suffered a minor stab wound on her
arm in the ensuing struggle. She also suffered a
bloody nose, but managed to escape from the as
sailant's grasp and call police 25 minutes later from a
Stanford dormitory.
The second assault happened between 9:30 and 10
p.m. on April 14. only 120 feet from the first attack.
The victim, a University employee, was also grabbed
from behind and threatened with "some kind of
sharp instrument." but escaped without injury.
The suspect is described as a white male in his
early to mid-20s, 5-foot-11, 160 pounds, with light
brown hair, brown eyes, and a large freckle in front
of his left ear in the sideburn area. He was last seen
wearing a plaid shirt, blue jeans and Adidas shoes.

Stanford police are currently searching for this
man, who is the primary suspect in two cases of as
sault that occurred near the Physics Tank last
month.
Hanrahan said police are "99 percent sure" the
same man is responsible for both attacks. The first
victim originally described him as in his 30s. but
revised that after seeing him again. The description
provided by the second victim coincides with the
first victim's.
Hanrahan said police don't know if the suspect is a
student or if he has any connection to the University.
If apprehended, he would be charged with two
counts of assault with a deadly weapon, a felony.

Both cases are being treated as
attempted rapes. Hanrahan said,
"but we don't know for sure, be
cause it never got to that point,
fortunately." The assailant did not
demand money from either vic
tim. he added.
Stanford Police Chief Marvin
Herrington told The Daily two
weeks ago that the police are
unsure whether the individual is
still in the area. "He's tried
(assaulting someone) twice and
hasn't been successful."
Police ask anyone seeing the
suspect to call 911 immediately.
Anyone with information about
the case is asked to call 723-9633
or 911.
