## 
### SUHA JHAVERI Staff writer 
Resident fellows at Trancos issued a letter to
the dorm's male residents last Monday warn
ing them about fraternity life and praising
dorm life as more diverse and personally chal
lenging.
Trancos RFs Martha Feldman and Tom
Bauman distributed the letter the morning
after fraternity bids were issued. Accompany
ing the letter was a copy of an April 1986 Daily
viewpoint written by former Delta Upsilon
president Luke Cole criticizing fraternities as
sexist, intolerant and anti-intellectual.
The'RFs' letter states: "At this time of year
it's easy to get down about low draw numbers
and wrapped up in the quest for bids. We hope
you have given thought to how being in a frat
full time will affect your experience at Stan
ford.
"How many exciting people will you meet?"

the letter continues. "How many truly inspira
tional ideas will you encounter? How much of
a forum will it give you for taking advantage of
Stanford, or qualifying yourself to be an RA
(resident assistant)?"
Fraternal Affairs Adviser Joe Pisano said he
supported any efforts to share information and
opinions on Greek life. "Let people draw their
own conclusions. The fraternity system is not
for everybody," he said.
Following the general distribution of the let
ter, Trancos RAs talked in particular with
those freshmen who had received bids from
the Sigma Chi fraternity. On Tuesday evening
all four Trancos RAs engaged two Sigma Chi
bidees, Timur Colak and Ole Tustin. in an
hourlong discussion on how Sigma Chi life
would affect their personal growth.
"We were all caught up in Rush and the RAs
realized this. We had seen the best side of fra
ternities for three weeks. They talked to us as
friends," Colak said.

Both pledges agreed that they were glad the
RAs confronted them. "For anyone to make an
Informed decision he must know all sides. In
the end, 1 feel I made a better decision, stated
Colak. who accepted his bid.
Other pledges said they were disappointed in
the apparent bias of the RAs and HFs. They
gave us a very negative opinion of lraternities
in general and Sigma Chi in particular, said
freshman pledge Bob Burlinson. Burlinson
noted that the RFs did not include the
response letters to Cole's article, and that the
RAs talked only to Sigma Chi bidees.
Feldman responded that she was unaware
that response letters had been printed. She
added that "we weren't attempting to present
all points of view.
"We were encouraging them to think care
fully of the choices they were about to make
and to look at the sides they might not see
during the Rush process," Feldman said.
