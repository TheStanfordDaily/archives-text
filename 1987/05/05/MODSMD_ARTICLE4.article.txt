# Drinking laws to be enforced
## 
### JOHN LIS Editorial staff 
Stanford Police said yesterday
that enforcement of California's
drinking-age law on campus is not
a new policy and that underage
students should not be surprised
by incidents like those last
weekend, when police entered
three parties and requested that
bartenders check IDs of students
being served.
Police Capt. Marvin Moore also
hinted at stricter enforcement in
the future. "We could get even
more strenuous," he said. "If I had
the staff, I wouldn't hesitate to go
into parties and begin citing
people under 21 who were drink
ing alcohol. It could get a lot
worse.
"(People who serve minors)
should be sweating. People don't
realize the risk they take serving
alcohol to underage minors. If
something happens to that indi
vidual, you could be held
criminally liable.
"One of our problems is that
people assume because they're at
Stanford, anything goes. Being
underage is the only thing that
matters. People think that be
cause it's a college environment,
it's cool. That doesn't matter. I
was surprised by the reaction of
people when I told them they have
to be 21 to drink."
Police entered bid-acceptance
parties at the Sigma Chi and Beta
Theta Pi fraternity houses Friday
night and told bartenders to check
driver's licenses of students being
served. Moore indicated that was
due to underage students walking
across Lasuen Mall between the
two parties and obstructing traf
fic.
"With some cases, there's just a
blatant disregard for the law,"
Moore said. "There were kids out
in the streets who weren't even
close to 21. They were clearly un
derage with beer in their hands."
Saturday night, police entered
the "Loro Rocks" party in Florence
Moore Hall and again requested
that bartenders card anyone being
served alcohol. "Some students
were dancing on the roof of
Florence Moore," Moore said.
"When officers arrived it was really
a safety issue."
Moore said that if police are
summoned to a party or find

cause to enter — such as students
milling in the street with open
containers or dancing on the roof
— they will take whatever action is
necessary to restore order, includ
ing cracking down on underage
drinking if that is a cause.
"We don't go out of our way to go
into a party," Moore said. "There
are parties here all the time —
we're not concerned with that. If
we're called with a problem, we'll
assess the cause of the problem,
and if it's underage drinking, we'll
have to address that. If a party's
spilling out into the street like this
weekend, we can see on view that
they're impeding traffic with beer
in their hands.
"It's not a new policy. It's one of
the things we've been really
adamant about for years: People
have to be 21 to drink. That's the
California law.
"We've closed down parties in
the past when too many underage
people were served. You have to be
21 to be served alcohol, and check
ing Stanford IDs just doesn't cut
it." Many groups already check
Stanford IDs to prevent local high
school students from entering
parties.
"I was not aware the police
would come in," said Fraternal Af
fairs Adviser Joe Pisano. "It seems
the police were not threatening,
but helpful. Part of it is that Stan
ford is not a vacuum, we're not in
dependent of the law. People were
not arrested, but simply asked to
comply with the law."
Pisano speculated that recent
police actions indicate a more ac
tive role in enforcing drinking
laws. "I wouldn't be surprised if
this is part of an effort to be more
visible on campus. I hope people
appreciate that the police were
cooperating with the party organi
zers, but they have a law to en
force."
Moore said the death of David
Dunshee two weeks ago had no ef
fect on the police action. Dunshee,
a 20-year-old junior, drowned in
Lagunita after a Zeta Psi rush
party. Police have indicated that
Dunshee was intoxicated and
unable to swim to safety after fall
ing in the lake.
"David Dunshee is just one in a
long line of alcohol-related inci
dents on campus. What we've seen
