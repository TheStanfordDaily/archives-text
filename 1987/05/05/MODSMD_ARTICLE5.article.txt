# Talks assess human rights
## Speakers review conditions in South Africa, Ethiopia 
### DIANE BISGEIER Senior staff writer 
A forum on the condition of human rights in
South Africa and Ethiopia last night at Tresidder
Union marked the beginning of Human Rights
Awareness Week, sponsored by the Stanford chapter
of Amnesty International.
Aweto Simesso, a doctoral candidate in political
science from Ethiopia, and Ron September, a
graduate student in education from South Africa,
described human rights conditions in their
respective countries.
September described the current South African
state of emergency, under which all constitutional
laws and rights have been suspended. The current
state is "only an extension and combination of his
torical phenomena" in South Africa, he said.
"Blacks in South Africa have never had the rights
that one thinks about when one thinks of human
rights." he said. "It's not as if the state of emergency
is an aberration: The same things have occurred
before or have been in lesser versions."
South Africa has placed much of its power in the
central government, which also is becoming increas
ingly influenced by the military. "The military has
become extremely important in running everyday life
in South Africa." he said. "The administrative
powers of appointed officials have also increased
while the powers of the judiciary have decreased."
"Rights of black people are getting to be fewer and
fewer." he continued. "There are now a lot more poli
tical trials and the onus of proof is now on the
accused."
September said that most of the anti-government
protests have taken place in black schools. "Since
1984 it's basically been one kind of spontaneous but
sustained protest," he said.
Simesso broke down the problems in Ethiopia into
three areas: its new constitution, its judicial
structure and "recent problems" such as the govern

merit's program of citizen relocation, which is de
signed to alleviate the famine problem.
"The new constitution is a direct copy of the Soviet
constitution," said Simesso, who explained that the
new two-structure government with a workers party
and a central committee is "very much In keeping
with the Soviet structure."
Ethiopia's similarities with the Soviet Union stop,
however, with the increasing military control of the
government, according to Simesso. "What we have in
Ethiopia is a central structure that reflects the Soviet
state with the added twist of a military-dominated
structure," he said.
Simesso said human rights exist more in theory
than in real life. "Rights of habeas corpus and war
rants for arrest theoretically exist, but there is still
an extra-judicial organization, the Revolutionary
Operations Coordinating Committee, that was es
tablished in 1977 to move against the unrest."
He explained that the organization, a "very tight
security network trained by the East Germans," was
probably responsible for the tortures, state assassi
nations and disappearances that have been reported
this last year.
"It's a continuing problem," he said. "Although the
freedom of assembly and the freedom of protest are
in the constitution, you never hear of the exercise of
such freedoms within the state itself."
"One key problem is that it is a very closed system
in which people are experiencing feelings of power
lessness," Simesso continued. "There are clearly no
mechanisms for input from the outside. We are now
faced with a four-fold civil war due to the hostility
that has been generated within the masses."
The Ethiopian government has recently acted to
relocate and "villagize" many of the peasants, moving
most of them to villages. This further Increases the
political tension in the country, according to
Simesso.
"The totality of relocation and villagizatlon has
deepened the civil discontent," he said.
