Kuwait and U.S. near agreement
KUWAIT — The United States and Kuwait are close to an agree
ment to put up to half of this nation's fleet of supertankers under
the U.S. flag and the protection of the U.S. Navy, sources here
said, significantly raising the U.S. profile in the Persian Gulf war
zone.
According to Kuwaiti officials and Western diplomatic sources,
the two countries have agreed in principle to transfer up to 11 of
the 22 ships owned by the government-run Kuwait Oil Tankers
Co. to a U.S. corporation, whose stock would be controlled by
Kuwait. Kuwaiti negotiators were in Washington last week
working toward a goal of completing the corporate arrangements
In 30 days, sources said.
Such an agreement would represent a significant policy change
for one of the key Persian Gulf states, a group whose collective
defense strategy has opposed any military involvement in the
region by the superpowers.
Last month, Kuwait completed a similar but more modest
agreement to lease three small tankers from the Soviet Union,
which will provide a naval escort to and from Kuwaiti ports.
The agreements could increase the prospect that U.S. or Soviet
warships might find themselves in hostile confrontations with
Iranian gunboats or warplanes, which have mounted 21 attacks
on Kuwaiti oil tankers since September.
Court upholds anti-sexism law
WASHINGTON — The Supreme Court, striking a blow at tradi
tional male-only clubs, yesterday upheld a California anti
discrimination law and barred Rotary International from ousting
local chapters that admit women as members.
In a 7-0 ruling, the justices said that private groups whose activ
ities are public and linked to business have no constitutional
right to exclude women.
The decision, which was hailed by women's rights advocates,
cast doubt on the legality of the men-only policies of a host of
private organizations, ranging from Lions Clubs and Kiwanis to
the Boy Scouts. It also significantly narrowed the acceptable
grounds for a private right to discriminate.
"If I were representing Kiwanis, the Lions, the Junior League or
the Boys Scouts, I would be very nervous about this decision."
said Chicago attorney William Sutter, who represented Rotary In
ternational in the case. "Maybe if you're a men's golf club, with no
service activities and you exist only for social purposes, you're OK.
That might be all."
In the ruling, the court said that sex discrimination may be
banned even in clubs that are "highly selective" in their member
ship, a key argument cited by Rotary International in defending
its policy.
Nixon papers released to public
WASHINGTON — Less than two months after the 1972
Watergate break-in. President Nixon directed his aides to search
for embarrassing Information in the income tax files of Demo
cratic presidential nominee George McGovern and the chairman
of the Democratic National Committee, Lawrence O'Brien, accord
ing to Nixon White House papers released yesterday by the Na
tional Archives.
It was O'Brien's office that had been burglarized at the
Watergate complex June 17 by operatives of the Committee for the
Re-election of the President. Nixon's order, which the Internal
Revenue Service apparently rebuffed, appears in notes taken Aug.
3 by White House counselor John D. Ehrlichman at a meeting
with the president.
Ehrlichman's neatly lettered jottings showed that Nixon was
deeply concerned about appealing to his Republican supporters
and countering campaign moves by the Democrats, especially
McGovern, whom he defeated later that year in his bid for re
election.
"Check McGovern's Internal Revenue Service files . . . check his
(O'Brien's) returns," read the Ehrlichman notes on yellow legal
size paper, quoting Nixon.
Later notes by Ehrlichman, however, show that Nixon was un
happy with the agency's performance, suggesting that the IRS
rejected his request on McGovern and O'Brien.
"IRS — all appointees out after the election," Ehrlichman wrote
after a meeting with the president in the fall of 1972.
His notes were among 252,000 documents released by the ar
chives from among the most sensitive files kept by the Nixon
White House. About 1.5 million were previously made public, and
Nixon has objected to the release of about 75,000 others, which
are undergoing further review by an archives panel.
The latest papers, from the files of aides Ehrlichman, John
Dean, Gordon Strachan, Harry Dent and Egil Krogh, provide fas
cinating new glimpses into the workings of the Nixon presidency.
However, they shed no light on a central question of the Watergate
scandal: whether Nixon knew in advance about the break-in.
Engineer indicted after crash
TOWSON, Md. — Conrail engineer Ricky Gates was indicted for
manslaughter Monday in the fiery deaths of 16 Amtrak pas
sengers killed Jan. 4 in Amtrak's worst rail disaster.
Gates. 32, was charged with operating a string of locomotives in
a "grossly negligent" manner when they rolled into the path of a
speeding Washington-to-Boston passenger train near Baltimore.
If convicted. Gates faces a maximum penalty of five years' im
prisonment and a • 1.000 fine for each of the 16 counts of
manslaughter.
Conrail brakeman Edward Cromwell was not indicted in con
nection with the accident that injured 176 people, sent fires rush
ing through at least two cars and left twisted metal and other
debris strewn along the track bed. Prosecutors said Cromwell was
not the primary operator of the Conrail locomotives.
Amnesty program begins today
WASHINGTON — As the Immigration and Naturalization Ser
vice prepares for today's opening of an alien-legalization program
expected to draw up to 4 million applicants, critics are predicting
"chaos and confusion'' because of Inadequate government
preparations.
"Up to this point, no public education has taken place," said
Wade Henderson of the American Civil Liberties Union. "There's a
lot of confusion, of people not understanding the program. It will
be chaotic. . . . (The INS is) ill-prepared . . . with Insufficient staff.
Inadequate training."
Under the new immigration law, signed Nov. 6 by President
Reagan, illegal aliens who have lived in the United States since
before Jan. 1, 1982. may apply for legalization during a one-year
period starting today.
INS Commissioner Alan C. Nelson acknowledged last week that
he expects problems as the program begins, with rental furniture
and temporary workers in some of the 107 new INS legalization
offices and shortages of some necessary forms.
Final INS regulations did not appear in the Federal Register un
til Friday, and several issues. Including whether aliens will be re
quired to undergo a test for AIDS, have not been resolved.

lot of confusion, of people not understanding the program. It will
be chaotic. . . . (The INS is) ill-prepared . . . with Insufficient staff.
Inadequate training."
Under the new immigration law, signed Nov. 6 by President
Reagan, illegal aliens who have lived in the United States since
before Jan. 1, 1982. may apply for legalization during a one-year
period starting today.
INS Commissioner Alan C. Nelson acknowledged last week that
he expects problems as the program begins, with rental furniture
and temporary workers in some of the 107 new INS legalization
offices and shortages of some necessary forms.
Final INS regulations did not appear in the Federal Register un
til Friday, and several issues. Including whether aliens will be re
quired to undergo a test for AIDS, have not been resolved.

Kuwait and U.S. near agreement
KUWAIT — The United States and Kuwait are close to an agree
ment to put up to half of this nation's fleet of supertankers under
the U.S. flag and the protection of the U.S. Navy, sources here
said, significantly raising the U.S. profile in the Persian Gulf war
zone.
According to Kuwaiti officials and Western diplomatic sources,
the two countries have agreed in principle to transfer up to 11 of
the 22 ships owned by the government-run Kuwait Oil Tankers
Co. to a U.S. corporation, whose stock would be controlled by
Kuwait. Kuwaiti negotiators were in Washington last week
working toward a goal of completing the corporate arrangements
In 30 days, sources said.
Such an agreement would represent a significant policy change
for one of the key Persian Gulf states, a group whose collective
defense strategy has opposed any military involvement in the
region by the superpowers.
Last month, Kuwait completed a similar but more modest
agreement to lease three small tankers from the Soviet Union,
which will provide a naval escort to and from Kuwaiti ports.
The agreements could increase the prospect that U.S. or Soviet
warships might find themselves in hostile confrontations with
Iranian gunboats or warplanes, which have mounted 21 attacks
on Kuwaiti oil tankers since September.
Court upholds anti-sexism law
WASHINGTON — The Supreme Court, striking a blow at tradi
tional male-only clubs, yesterday upheld a California anti
discrimination law and barred Rotary International from ousting
local chapters that admit women as members.
In a 7-0 ruling, the justices said that private groups whose activ
ities are public and linked to business have no constitutional
right to exclude women.
The decision, which was hailed by women's rights advocates,
cast doubt on the legality of the men-only policies of a host of
private organizations, ranging from Lions Clubs and Kiwanis to
the Boy Scouts. It also significantly narrowed the acceptable
grounds for a private right to discriminate.
"If I were representing Kiwanis, the Lions, the Junior League or
the Boys Scouts, I would be very nervous about this decision."
said Chicago attorney William Sutter, who represented Rotary In
ternational in the case. "Maybe if you're a men's golf club, with no
service activities and you exist only for social purposes, you're OK.
That might be all."
In the ruling, the court said that sex discrimination may be
banned even in clubs that are "highly selective" in their member
ship, a key argument cited by Rotary International in defending
its policy.
Nixon papers released to public
WASHINGTON — Less than two months after the 1972
Watergate break-in. President Nixon directed his aides to search
for embarrassing Information in the income tax files of Demo
cratic presidential nominee George McGovern and the chairman
of the Democratic National Committee, Lawrence O'Brien, accord
ing to Nixon White House papers released yesterday by the Na
tional Archives.
It was O'Brien's office that had been burglarized at the
Watergate complex June 17 by operatives of the Committee for the
Re-election of the President. Nixon's order, which the Internal
Revenue Service apparently rebuffed, appears in notes taken Aug.
3 by White House counselor John D. Ehrlichman at a meeting
with the president.
Ehrlichman's neatly lettered jottings showed that Nixon was
deeply concerned about appealing to his Republican supporters
and countering campaign moves by the Democrats, especially
McGovern, whom he defeated later that year in his bid for re
election.
"Check McGovern's Internal Revenue Service files . . . check his
(O'Brien's) returns," read the Ehrlichman notes on yellow legal
size paper, quoting Nixon.
Later notes by Ehrlichman, however, show that Nixon was un
happy with the agency's performance, suggesting that the IRS
rejected his request on McGovern and O'Brien.
"IRS — all appointees out after the election," Ehrlichman wrote
after a meeting with the president in the fall of 1972.
His notes were among 252,000 documents released by the ar
chives from among the most sensitive files kept by the Nixon
White House. About 1.5 million were previously made public, and
Nixon has objected to the release of about 75,000 others, which
are undergoing further review by an archives panel.
The latest papers, from the files of aides Ehrlichman, John
Dean, Gordon Strachan, Harry Dent and Egil Krogh, provide fas
cinating new glimpses into the workings of the Nixon presidency.
However, they shed no light on a central question of the Watergate
scandal: whether Nixon knew in advance about the break-in.
Engineer indicted after crash
TOWSON, Md. — Conrail engineer Ricky Gates was indicted for
manslaughter Monday in the fiery deaths of 16 Amtrak pas
sengers killed Jan. 4 in Amtrak's worst rail disaster.
Gates. 32, was charged with operating a string of locomotives in
a "grossly negligent" manner when they rolled into the path of a
speeding Washington-to-Boston passenger train near Baltimore.
If convicted. Gates faces a maximum penalty of five years' im
prisonment and a • 1.000 fine for each of the 16 counts of
manslaughter.
Conrail brakeman Edward Cromwell was not indicted in con
nection with the accident that injured 176 people, sent fires rush
ing through at least two cars and left twisted metal and other
debris strewn along the track bed. Prosecutors said Cromwell was
not the primary operator of the Conrail locomotives.
Amnesty program begins today
WASHINGTON — As the Immigration and Naturalization Ser
vice prepares for today's opening of an alien-legalization program
expected to draw up to 4 million applicants, critics are predicting
"chaos and confusion'' because of Inadequate government
preparations.
