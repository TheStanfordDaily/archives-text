# Hart prepares to squelch rumors
## 
### 
WASHINGTON - Democratic
presidential front-runner Gary
Hart, "totally outraged" by a news
paper story reporHng that he
spent most of last weekend in his
Capitol Hill town house with a 29-
year-old model and aspiring
actress, will issue a full and fight
ing denial today, aides said.
Confronted with an episode that
political professionals said could
destroy his candidacy if not
rebutted. Hart spent the day in
seclusion here. He canceled a
fund-raising reception in New Jer
sey last night so he could prepare
his remarks, which he is expected
to deliver at a speech or fund
raiser in New York today.
In Miami, the woman named in
the story. Donna Rice, denied in
an interview with The Associated
Press that she was romantically
involved with Hart. She called
their weekend activities "all very
innocent," said she had not spent
the night in Hart's house, and
added, "There is nothing between

Hart officials uniformly ex
pressed outrage over the story.
"We are flat-out livid about this.
We think The (Miami) Herald went
flat-out beyond the bounds." said
national political director Paul
Tully. "We have got to deal with it.
try to get past it."
"It's character assassination,"
said Hart campaign manager
William Dixon.
The Miami Herald reported Sun
day that Hart and Rice, a former
beauty queen and Phi Beta Kappa
graduate of the University of
South Carolina, were together
Friday night and much of Satur
day while Hart's wife, Lee. was in
Denver. The newspaper account
was based on a surveillance by a
team of four reporters, who were
acting on a tip from an uniden
tified source in Miami, where Rice
lives.
But Hart's spokesman said the
paper engaged in a shoddy jour
nalistic practice, was erroneous in
its reports on Rice's visit to the
house because reporters failed to

watch a rear entrance she used,
and published a story without
talking first to Rice. They ac
knowledged that Hart socialized
with Rice and two other friends
during the weekend, but said Hart
and Rice were never alone to
gether in his apartment except for
a few moments.
Hart has acknowledged he first
met Rice last New Year's Eve in
Aspen. Colo., saw her on one other
occasion in Miami and phoned
her several times during his cam
paign travels — but denied he had
any personal relationship with
her.
As Hart prepared his point-by
point rebuttal, and as editors at
The Herald stood by their story,
political leaders around the
country tried to assess the fallout
from the episode. The story was
published at a time when Hart's
campaign has been dogged by
rumors of his womanizing.
"To take the full denial route
and blast the news organizations
invites every journalist in America

to go after the story and keep after
it," said a press secretary for a
rival Democratic candidate. "They
have invited intense press
scrutiny of the particulars of the
story. If they can't hold the details
together, they're cooked."
"I think it would appear to be
mortal,'" Bob Neuman said of the
effect on Hart's campaign.
Neuman served as a press secre
tary to Rep. Morris Udall and now
is an informal adviser to former
Arizona governor Bruce Babbitt's
presidential campaign.
Other political figures expressed
sympathy for Hart and attacked
the press.
"I think the attacks on him are
unfair and — what do they
produce?" said New York Gov.
Mario Cuomo. "I would dislike to
be a candidate who has to assume
that his home is under press
stakeout 24 hours a day," said
former secretary of state and 1972
Democratic presidential con
tender Edmund Muskie.
