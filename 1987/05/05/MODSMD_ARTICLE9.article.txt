# Secord to testify in Iran hearings
## 
### 
WASHINGTON - On the eve of the long
awaited Iran-contra hearings, congressional
investigators continued meeting privately with
their lead-off witness, retired Maj. Gen. Rich
ard Secord, whom they expect to reveal
publicly new details of the Reagan administra
tion's most controversial foreign policy in
itiatives.
Speaking of the months of testimony ahead.
Rep. Lee Hamilton, D-Ind., chairman of the
House select committee, said that much of it
would be familiar to the news media and the
public. But he added that a "good deal of the
testimony" will be new, beginning with
Secord's appearance this afternoon.
In related matters. Hamilton disclosed that:
□ The committee will vote at a later date on the
release of classified documents and classified
testimony of some 300 witnesses given to in
vestigators in private over the course of the
four-month prehearings inquiry. Rep. Dick
Cheney, R-Wyo., vice chairman of the select
committee, said he expected that "the (amount
of) material that will remain classified will be
relatively small."
□ The House committee does not anticipate
calling President Reagan as a witness at this

time, but there has been no final judgment on
this and it "depends on how the hearings
develop," Hamilton said.
□ The private, preparatory questioning of
Rear Adm. John Poindexter, former national
security adviser, which lasted almost eight
hours Saturday, will continue, but probably
not until the weekend because of the hearings.
Poindexter is considered the most knowledgea
ble witness concerning what the president
knew of the secret funding of the contras
during the cutoff of U.S. military aid, and the
diversion of U.S/Iran arms-sale funds to the
Nicaraguan rebels.
□ Congressional investigators still have not
reached agreement with the Israeli govern
ment over the release of a "financial chronol
ogy" of the Iran-contra events compiled by offi
cials in Jerusalem. Hamilton described the fin
ancial material as extensive and called the
cooperation of Israeli officials "very good."
The handling of classified information took
up most of a meeting yesterday of members of
the House select committee.
Sources said the members decided that
during the public hearings, witnesses would
be alerted if the questioning was expected to

take them into classified areas. Of particular
sensitivity is the subject of other nations that
allegedly supported the contras.
The most prominent example is Saudi
Arabia, which is widely believed to have pro
vided $33.5 million to the contra forces imme
diately before and after Congress stopped
direct U.S. military aid. Testimony concerning
the alleged Saudi contribution is expected to
come up during Secord's appearance.
Saudi officials repeatedly have denied that
their government was the source of the funds,
which were paid into a secret contra bank ac
count in the Cayman Islands and which pro
vided a crucial lifeline for the anti-Sandinista
rebels.
Also, the State Department has never offi
cially acknowledged that a large donation to
the contra cause was solicited from the sultan
of Brunei. However, the Senate intelligence
committee released a report earlier this year
that said Assistant Secretary of State Elliott
Abrams "reportedly" met with a Brunei repre
sentative last Aug. 8, and later sought as
surance that Brunei was donating $10 million.
