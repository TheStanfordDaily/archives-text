The Task Force on the Area
One Requirement is sponsor
ing an open forum tonight on
Western Culture at Stanford.
The forum, which will be at
tended by task force members,
will be held at 7 p.m. in the
Meyer Library forum room.
According to task force chair
man and History Prof. Paul
Seaver, the task force "wants to
hear student opinions" on the
three-week-old task force
report, before it is sent to the
Committee on Undergraduate
Studies (CUS) for considera
tion.
According to Seaver, the task
force has previously heard
opinions only from students
who "have expressed interest"
in the proposed changes, and
now would like to listen to the
views of "the rest of the student
body," Seaver said.
The forum will allow students
to question the task force di
rectly. Questions will follow a

brief presentation by Seaver.
He said he hopes all members
of the task force will be present
at the meeting.
Seaver added that he doesn't
"know at this point" if the
forum would have an impact on
the task force's final report.
He added, however, that the
"task force recommendations
will be rewritten soon to make
them clearer."
The task force report, in its
present draft form, calls 011
Western Culture tracks to In
clude study of a non-European
culture, as well as primary texts
by women and minorities. It
also calls for the elimination of
the core reading list, currently
common to all tracks.
Seaver said he hopes to have
the final version of the report
ready by May 20 in time for the
final meeting of the CUS.
He does not forsee CUS ac
tion on the report this year, al
though he expects it to be the
"first item on the agenda next
year."
