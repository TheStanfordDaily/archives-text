## THE 						STANFORD DAILY An Independent Newspaper Gephardt's follies 
### 
Last week Japanese Prime Minister Yus
hiro Nakasone was in Washington to talk
with President Reagan about the trade im
balance between the United States and
Japan. Nakasone promised to stimulate the
domestic economy, which will mean an in
crease in American exports to Japan. In ad
dition. he said he would take steps to remove
some of Japan's trade barriers, which make
it nearly impossible for foreigners to sell cer
tain products — agricultural goods in partic
ular — in Japan.
Since Nakasone has made these promises
before and nothing has come of them,
Congress has decided to take matters into its
own hands. During Nakasones visit, the
House of Representatives passed its version
of a trade bill designed to cut the massive
U.S. trade deficit. The ill-conceived bill is
nothing short of protectionism and its most
egregious feature by far is the Gephardt
amendment.
Richard Gephardt, D-Mo., is a 1988 presi
dential candidate. Since he is a relative un
known, he is using the trade issue to gain
notoriety. However, his efforts to further
himself politically may be very dangerous to
the economic health of this country.
The amendment calls for trade sanctions
and other severe measures to be taken

against any country that has a large trade
surplus with the United States. There is little
doubt that other countries would retaliate
against these measures; the result would be
a trade war that would leave the global eco
nomy in shambles. The name Gephardt
would join the names of Hawley and Smoot,
whose tariff bill is recognized as a major
cause of the Great Depression of the 19305,
in the history books.
Instead of signing this protectionist mea
sure into law, it behooves the United States
to keep the pressure on Nakasone to live up
to his promises. Instead of sanctions against
Japanese televisions we should be working
to improve our own competitiveness in the
international arena.
The decline in the dollar has masked the
fact that the situation is improving. The
volume ratio of exports to imports has begun
to turn in favor of the United States. The
trade deficit will disappear only when Ameri
can companies can manufacture goods that
are of high quality and as inexpensive as
their foreign counterparts.
The House bill and the Gephardt amend
ment are a quick fix that will result in an eco
nomic catastrophe. The Senate and Presi
dent Reagan must do whatever is necessary
to prevent them from becoming law.
