# Area One is Eurocentric

### 
We applaud the efforts of the Western Culture Task
Force and Its recommendations to reform the West
ern Culture requirement Into a study of diverse
cultures and their impact on the creation of Western
society. We support the direction the task force has
taken because it is critical that people understand
the multicultural society we face.

ASSU COP

Some of the negative responses since the release of
the draft report demonstrate clearly the need for an
Area One requirement to educate the whole Stanford
community, not just the students. Take the example
of Hoover Research Assistant Adam Lieberman, who
In his recent letter (Daily, April 21) demonstrated
what comes from teaching Western Culture through
a narrow Eurocentric perspective. Mr. Lieberman
was apparently taught, as Stanford students are
taught today, that "Africa has no Dante; Latin
America has no Homer. . . . These 'ethnocentric'
writers and thinkers have said it better than anyone
else so far." This is the kind of frightening tunnel vi
sion that the current Western Culture program
breeds.
There were great and intellectually rich cultures
and societies in Africa. Asia and Latin America long
before the intrusion of European culture and people
onto these continents. The limited presentation
given in Western Culture promotes this dangerous
and inaccurate view. In addition, it does not awaken
students' curiosity about the valuable lessons and
ideas that can be discovered in the study of less ac
cessible cultures.
We support the flexibility that would be given to
professors by the new proposal. The proposal allows
professors to draw from a variety of works that go
beyond the limiting core list. Surely if the works of
Plato, Aristotle. Dante and Homer are essential, they
do not need to be on a required core list in order to
assure their use.
Let there be no doubt that we live in a multicul
tural nation, a Western civilization that was formed
through significant contributions of a variety of
cultures. As a simple example, by the year 2000
minority communities in California will become the
majority. It is surprising to find that in 1987, Stan
ford University is still presenting the culture of our
society through a Eurocentric perspective.

English Prof. William Chace asks, "Who is going to
teach this course?" Stanford prides itself on possess
ing one of the most liberally educated and diverse
faculties in the nation. It would seem logical that
there are qualified and interested faculty members
who would be eager to accept the challenge of organ
izing and/or teaching these courses. We can draw
from the existing Afro-American program, the Asian
Studies Department, the Latin American Studies De
partment and others. Granted, we may not have an
abundance of professors in these fields; this is a sep
arate problem in itself which perhaps can be ad
dressed when considering the Centennial faculty ap
pointments. What we can conclude from the strong
and immediate reaction by several faculty members
is that there is a lack of educational background on
the subject matter — not a good statement on the
quality of education at Stanford — or an unwilling
ness to draw on the expertise of professors in other
departments.
We disagree with the Western Culture Program
Committee, which feels that the concerns raised by
the task force could be more effectively addressed
through the non-Western requirement. It is our
opinion that by attempting to divide the West and
non-West, the relationships and interaction of
cultures, ideas and events cannot be accurately pre
sented. In addition, the works of minority and
women writers must be included in a study of the
West In order to represent their impact on our soci
ety. Furthermore, there are very few people who can
in good conscience argue that we have a strong non-
Western Culture program that satisfies this need. If
time Is a critical Issue, the WCPC could seriously
consider combining both programs, allowing four
quarters to present an effective course in the pro
posed "Cultures. Ideas and Values" program.
Students have met the challenge to question au
thority and have responded with a critical and
legitimate analysis of their experience in the Western
Culture program.
We know that the proposal will be revised in
response to many concerns, but the direction of
reformulating the Area One requirement is a respon
sibility we must face as a leading educational Institu
tion. It is also a responsibility that we have to the
diverse student community at Stanford and the
diverse society that we will eventually serve.
