# Anything but a Californian
## 
### 
While discussing plans for spring break. I in
advertently referred to New York as "back
East." As the words left my lips, I felt a cold
thrill of fear. "Ohmlgod!" I thought. "1 have
become a Californian."

You see, even as a freshman I knew there
was a profound difference between Califor
nlans and normal people. One of the easiest
ways to tell was that Callfornlans referred to
everything east of Tahoe as "back East." For us
normal people, "back East" was simply reality,
and this curious land in which I was living was
"out West." People who live "out West" are, by
definition, not living in reality. It's only natu
ral. then, that Callfornlans have a slightly
warped view of the real world.
Here's a typical California statement: "Oh.
you're from Iowa? That's, like, back East, isn't
it? Do you like New York?" Contrary to popular
opinion, everything east of the Rockies is not a
two-hour drive from New York. In fact, if you
are unfortunate enough to live in the Midwest
you could drive for two hours or even two days
and still not be anywhere significant.
Callfornlans also do not understand
weather. They have no experience with bliz
zards. thunderstorms, ice storms, hail, tor
nadoes or any of the other natural disasters
that are routinely hurled against people dumb
enough to live In the Midwest. (Of course.

people In the Midwest do not have to deal with
earthquakes or whole states catching fire in
the summer.) Callfornlans are especially un
clear on the concept of snow. Sure, it is nice
fluffy white stuff that falls in the mountains so
you can ski on it. But snow is also wet, cold,
heavy stuff that you must shovel off your
driveway. It is slick, icy stuff that makes
driving horrendous. (In the Midwest, people
don't use chains. They simply crash into each
other — it's more macho.) It is dreary, slushy
stuff that lays on the ground from November to
April like a dead thing. Try to explain this to
someone from Los Angeles and you will get a
blank stare. In fact, Callfornlans have no ex
perience with coldness in general. As a fresh
man. I was delighted that frost on a mud
puddle was a rare enough sight to warrant a
front-page picture in the Times Tribune.
To be fair, many people like myself who are
originally from the real world find it equally dif
ficult to understand California and its culture.
The real-world view of California was aptly
captured in the California Cooler "I hate Cali
fornia'" ads: A land of brain-dead, blond surfers
with an unnatural concern for whales. Imag
ine a cross between Venice Beach. Berkeley
and Mars, and you get the idea. As I packed my
suitcases for California. I braced myself for
every conceivable form of radical welrdness.
Hence. I was slightly disappointed to find
nothing but yuppies in Palo Alto. (I later
learned, however, that there are really two
types of Callfornlans: Northern and Southern.
The really weird people are required by law to
live in Southern California.)
Not only the people, but the whole California
atmosphere was alien and unsettling: Why do
the trees look like they are from outer space?

What's salsa? What's tofu?

Why can't anyone pronounce J's? Why is the
Pacific so cold? Why do people listen to the
Grateful Dead? What's salsa? What's tofu?
What's sushi? What part of speech is "like"?
Why are the squirrels black? Why is the grass
brown? Why is the air brown?
Ah, but that was four years ago. I have sub
sequently grown accustomed to black squirrels
and sushi, although I'm still struggling with
the air and the Grateful Dead. 1 now look for
ward to snow — as long as it stays in the
mountains where it belongs. I eat food that
would appall people back home. I think 50
degrees is cold. And. ominously, my hair has
been getting dangerously close to becoming
blond.
In short. I have slowly mutated into a Califor
nian. Now, there is nothing wrong with being
a Californian. I suppose, but it is still a rude
shock to look in the mirror one day and see a
Californian staring back.
It's not as if I ever had any loyalty to my Mid
western background. The perceptive reader
will have noted that I have failed to say exactly
where I am from. This is because I am too em
barrassed to admit that I used to live near
Detroit (Oops). I never had any delusions
about returning to the Midwest after leaving
Stanford. After all. I like California — tofu and
all — and I plan to stay here. It's just being a
Californian that bothers me.

suitcases for California. I braced myself for
every conceivable form of radical welrdness.
Hence. I was slightly disappointed to find
nothing but yuppies in Palo Alto. (I later
learned, however, that there are really two
types of Callfornlans: Northern and Southern.
The really weird people are required by law to
live in Southern California.)
Not only the people, but the whole California
atmosphere was alien and unsettling: Why do
the trees look like they are from outer space?

What's salsa? What's tofu?

Why can't anyone pronounce J's? Why is the
Pacific so cold? Why do people listen to the
Grateful Dead? What's salsa? What's tofu?
What's sushi? What part of speech is "like"?
Why are the squirrels black? Why is the grass
brown? Why is the air brown?
Ah, but that was four years ago. I have sub
sequently grown accustomed to black squirrels
and sushi, although I'm still struggling with
the air and the Grateful Dead. 1 now look for
ward to snow — as long as it stays in the
mountains where it belongs. I eat food that
would appall people back home. I think 50
degrees is cold. And. ominously, my hair has
been getting dangerously close to becoming
blond.
In short. I have slowly mutated into a Califor
nian. Now, there is nothing wrong with being
a Californian. I suppose, but it is still a rude
shock to look in the mirror one day and see a
Californian staring back.
It's not as if I ever had any loyalty to my Mid
western background. The perceptive reader
will have noted that I have failed to say exactly
where I am from. This is because I am too em
barrassed to admit that I used to live near
Detroit (Oops). I never had any delusions
about returning to the Midwest after leaving
Stanford. After all. I like California — tofu and
all — and I plan to stay here. It's just being a
Californian that bothers me.
