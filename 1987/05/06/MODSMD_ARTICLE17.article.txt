Monitor deems
Durkin dumb
I am writing in response to a
recent column by Jim Durkin in
which he listed the 10 things he
hated most (Daily, April 21).
As one of the targets of this
lightheaded piece, I admit a bit of
chagrin at this junior's attitude
concerning what he refers to as
"library monitors." Satire has its
place, even in so august a publi
cation as The Daily, even perhaps
in the dubious "tradition of David
Letterman."
But why pick on portal
monitors (the accurate term)? In
Green Library (his chosen exam
ple), there are seven of us — plus
student assistants. These stu
dents are given the task because
of demonstrated responsibility
and proven hard work. Even a
cub reporter checks his facts.
Here's a few you missed, Master
Durkin:
□ One applies for this job as a
position. I interviewed for portal
monitor and knew going into it
what the job was.
□ A Dewey Decimal System li
brary still exists as part of the
collection, but Green's main hold
ings are in Library of Congress, a
much more current use of library
organization and fitted to our
large collection.
□ I agree with Durkin's com
ments about the need for skilled
workers. We have to be, so we can
identify the many different IDs
presented to us, verify book
checkout, insure backpack secur
ity and — one of our primary
functions — give information.
□ My boss, and hers as well, is a
she, not a he.
□ No one works full days here. We
work four-hour stints, simply
because all day would drive a
person to the Bridge rather
quickly. The pace is so fast all I
can read are short stories.
□ A "baboon" could not do this
job — bananas or any other
foodstuffs are not allowed here.
□ The Japanese might make

better cars, but we can add a
personal touch in an automated,
confused world. For example: We
can tell you where the bathroom
is. This has saved no end of em
barrassment to many.
In fact, we'd probably help you,
Jim Durkin. . . . It's part of the
job. Next time a bit of research
might help you to do yours. Keep
it up, but get the cold facts
straight.

Death penalty
deserves to
be considered
"Capital punishment is simply
wrong." This statement appeared
in a recent editorial (Daily, May
1), after a discussion of the recent
U.S. Supreme Court ruling up
holding the death penalty for
Ricky and Raymond Tison. There
are a number of aspects of this
editorial that I find quite disturb
ing and I hope The Daily will
consider these points when
writing in the future.
First of all, the editorial moves
from a review of a specific case
before the Supreme Court to the
declarative statement that capital
punishment is "simply wrong"
without explaining why capital
punishment is wrong a priori.
Quite to the contrary, the
pejorative use of the word
"simply" dismisses the need to
even question the "fact" that it is
wrong. But is capital punishment
really so simple?
The question of whether society
has the right or even the duty to
ask of a murderer the same price
he or she extracted from a victim
involves deep beliefs based often
on religious convictions and cul
tural values concerning the rela
tive importance of the individual
and his societal rights. To dis
miss such a complex issue as

"simply wrong" is irresponsible at
best.
What bothers me even more,
however, is that the editorial goes
on to defend its position, not by
providing sound reasons, but by
attacking the people with whom
the editorial disagrees. Twice the
editorial labels the U.S. Supreme
Court as "brainless" and then
attacks Justice Lewis Powell per
sonally. "Powell argued for the
majority that more solid evidence
of racially motivated intent in
applying the death penalty is
discriminatory. Proving intent,
however, is nearly impossible and
Powell knows it."
Are readers to infer that Justice
Powell is racist, that he desires
that "blacks who kill whites get
the death penalty far more often
than any others"? What is "and
Powell knows it" supposed to
mean? Or is it not supposed to
mean anything, but rather to
associate Powell with racism, a
very effective way to discredit
whatever the man says?
After thus labeling the bad guys
(still without discussing the con
tent of their argument), the edito
rial names the justices who
"dissented strongly" and records
its pious hope that "one of the
others will soon come to his or
her senses and join them." To top
this invective and to close out the
editorial The Daily adds that "the
sad thing is that in the
meantime, people will die." This
final emotional appeal, however,
still fails to touch upon the
central problem of how society
should deal with those that kill.
Yes, people will die. Thousands of
people are murdered every year. A
handful of their murderers
receive the death penalty, many
more go to jail and are later freed.
Is this justice?
I hope that in the future The
Daily will discuss issues and
defend its positions with sound
reasoning, not by resorting to
declarations of truth, abusive
language and shallow emotional
appeals.

After thus labeling the bad guys
(still without discussing the con
tent of their argument), the edito
rial names the justices who
"dissented strongly" and records
its pious hope that "one of the

Yes, people will die. Thousands of
people are murdered every year. A
handful of their murderers
receive the death penalty, many
more go to jail and are later freed.
Is this justice?
I hope that in the future The
Daily will discuss issues and
defend its positions with sound
reasoning, not by resorting to
declarations of truth, abusive
language and shallow emotional

Monitor deems
Durkin dumb
I am writing in response to a
recent column by Jim Durkin in
which he listed the 10 things he
hated most (Daily, April 21).
As one of the targets of this
lightheaded piece, I admit a bit of
chagrin at this junior's attitude
concerning what he refers to as
"library monitors." Satire has its
place, even in so august a publi
cation as The Daily, even perhaps
in the dubious "tradition of David
Letterman."
But why pick on portal
monitors (the accurate term)? In
Green Library (his chosen exam
ple), there are seven of us — plus
student assistants. These stu
dents are given the task because
of demonstrated responsibility
and proven hard work. Even a
cub reporter checks his facts.
Here's a few you missed, Master
Durkin:
□ One applies for this job as a
position. I interviewed for portal
monitor and knew going into it
what the job was.
□ A Dewey Decimal System li
brary still exists as part of the
collection, but Green's main hold
ings are in Library of Congress, a
much more current use of library
organization and fitted to our
large collection.
□ I agree with Durkin's com
ments about the need for skilled
workers. We have to be, so we can
identify the many different IDs
presented to us, verify book
checkout, insure backpack secur
ity and — one of our primary
functions — give information.
□ My boss, and hers as well, is a
she, not a he.
□ No one works full days here. We
work four-hour stints, simply
because all day would drive a
person to the Bridge rather
quickly. The pace is so fast all I
can read are short stories.
□ A "baboon" could not do this
job — bananas or any other
foodstuffs are not allowed here.
□ The Japanese might make

better cars, but we can add a
personal touch in an automated,
confused world. For example: We
can tell you where the bathroom
is. This has saved no end of em
barrassment to many.
In fact, we'd probably help you,
Jim Durkin. . . . It's part of the
job. Next time a bit of research
might help you to do yours. Keep
it up, but get the cold facts
straight.

Death penalty
deserves to
be considered
"Capital punishment is simply
wrong." This statement appeared
in a recent editorial (Daily, May
1), after a discussion of the recent
U.S. Supreme Court ruling up
holding the death penalty for
Ricky and Raymond Tison. There
are a number of aspects of this
editorial that I find quite disturb
ing and I hope The Daily will
consider these points when
writing in the future.
First of all, the editorial moves
from a review of a specific case
before the Supreme Court to the
declarative statement that capital
punishment is "simply wrong"
without explaining why capital
punishment is wrong a priori.
Quite to the contrary, the
pejorative use of the word
"simply" dismisses the need to
even question the "fact" that it is
wrong. But is capital punishment
really so simple?
The question of whether society
has the right or even the duty to
ask of a murderer the same price
he or she extracted from a victim
involves deep beliefs based often
on religious convictions and cul
tural values concerning the rela
tive importance of the individual
and his societal rights. To dis
miss such a complex issue as

"simply wrong" is irresponsible at
best.
What bothers me even more,
however, is that the editorial goes
on to defend its position, not by
providing sound reasons, but by
attacking the people with whom
the editorial disagrees. Twice the
editorial labels the U.S. Supreme
Court as "brainless" and then
attacks Justice Lewis Powell per
sonally. "Powell argued for the
majority that more solid evidence
of racially motivated intent in
applying the death penalty is
discriminatory. Proving intent,
however, is nearly impossible and
Powell knows it."
Are readers to infer that Justice
Powell is racist, that he desires
that "blacks who kill whites get
the death penalty far more often
than any others"? What is "and
Powell knows it" supposed to
mean? Or is it not supposed to
mean anything, but rather to
associate Powell with racism, a
very effective way to discredit
whatever the man says?
After thus labeling the bad guys
(still without discussing the con
tent of their argument), the edito
rial names the justices who
"dissented strongly" and records
its pious hope that "one of the
others will soon come to his or
her senses and join them." To top
this invective and to close out the
editorial The Daily adds that "the
sad thing is that in the
meantime, people will die." This
final emotional appeal, however,
