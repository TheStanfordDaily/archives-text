# Minority groups present demands
## 
### MARK LEMLEY Staff writer 
Representatives of four campus minority
organizations issued a set of demands yes
terday to University President Donald Ken
nedy which they called "vital to the partici
pation of minorities at Stanford."
At a noon press conference outside Ken
nedy's office, representatives of the Black
Student Union (BSU), th« Asian-American
Students Association (AASA), the Stanford
American Indian Organization (SAIO) and
MEChA, the Chicano student organization,
called for an immediate Administration
response to their demands. They said the
timing of the demands was influenced by
the upcoming Stanford Cornerstone
celebration May 14 to 16.
AASA spokeswoman Vivian Wu said the
groups had five immediate demands:
□ The appointment of an outside commis
sion to study racism and the quality of
minority life at Stanford, with the stipula
tion that the commission's recommen
dations be binding upon the University.
□ The development of an ethnic studies de
partment at Stanford.
□ The establishment of a vice provost for
minority affairs, a position which, accord
ing to the demands, "must be filled by a per
son of color."

□ The initiation of changes in University
admissions policies. Such changes would
include increased recruitment of low
income students, a requirement that the
percentage of each minority group admitted
to Stanford reflect "at least the state or na
tional average of each respective commu
nity" and a stipulation that the newly
created Jordan Scholars program be
eliminated.
□ The creation of a campus multicultural
center built and funded by the University.
Kennedy said last night that he had no
immediate comment on the demands. He
said, however, that he intends to issue a
response "in a day or two."
Speakers at the press conference called
for the immediate acceptance of these
demands. They also issued a set of
demands that Wu said represented the
long-range goals of the organizations.
These goals include an increase in the ap
pointment of minority faculty and staff, an
increase in University financial aid. a reaf
firmation of support for ethnic theme
houses, adoption of the draft proposal by
the Task Force on the Area One Require
ment, total divestment from companies
that do business in South Africa and sup
port of an ongoing United Farm Workers
