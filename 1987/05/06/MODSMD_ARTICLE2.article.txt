# Minority groups present demands
## 
### MARK LEMLEY Staff writer 
Representatives of four campus minority
organizations issued a set of demands yes
terday to University President Donald Ken
nedy which they called "vital to the partici
pation of minorities at Stanford."
At a noon press conference outside Ken
nedy's office, representatives of the Black
Student Union (BSU), th« Asian-American
Students Association (AASA), the Stanford
American Indian Organization (SAIO) and
MEChA, the Chicano student organization,
called for an immediate Administration
response to their demands. They said the
timing of the demands was influenced by
the upcoming Stanford Cornerstone
celebration May 14 to 16.
AASA spokeswoman Vivian Wu said the
groups had five immediate demands:
□ The appointment of an outside commis
sion to study racism and the quality of
minority life at Stanford, with the stipula
tion that the commission's recommen
dations be binding upon the University.
□ The development of an ethnic studies de
partment at Stanford.
□ The establishment of a vice provost for
minority affairs, a position which, accord
ing to the demands, "must be filled by a per
son of color."

□ The initiation of changes in University
admissions policies. Such changes would
include increased recruitment of low
income students, a requirement that the
percentage of each minority group admitted
to Stanford reflect "at least the state or na
tional average of each respective commu
nity" and a stipulation that the newly
created Jordan Scholars program be
eliminated.
□ The creation of a campus multicultural
center built and funded by the University.
Kennedy said last night that he had no
immediate comment on the demands. He
said, however, that he intends to issue a
response "in a day or two."
Speakers at the press conference called
for the immediate acceptance of these
demands. They also issued a set of
demands that Wu said represented the
long-range goals of the organizations.
These goals include an increase in the ap
pointment of minority faculty and staff, an
increase in University financial aid. a reaf
firmation of support for ethnic theme
houses, adoption of the draft proposal by
the Task Force on the Area One Require
ment, total divestment from companies
that do business in South Africa and sup
port of an ongoing United Farm Workers
boycott of grapes.
Speaking before a crowd of
about 60 press and supporters,
BSU Chairperson Amanda Kemp
insisted that minorities at Stan
ford had a right to the changes
they had demanded. She also
claimed that, despite recent
criticisms of ethnic theme houses.
Ujamaa, Zapata and Okada were
"the most integrated dorms on
campus."

Kemp said that "those in power
often need to be jarred," and that
campus minority groups had
learned from the campus protests
of the 19605, as well as recent
divestment-related protests at
Brown University and the Univer
sity of Wisconsin at Madison. "We
follow a long tradition of acting
upon great ideals by any means
necessary." she said.
Sophomore Jay Choi of the
AASA challenged University
leaders to be "a force for social
change."
SAIO representative Joey

Thomas agreed, claiming that
"Stanford students could not
receive the greatest education un
less they were made fully aware of
all our cultures."
John Enda, representing
MEChA, noted that so-called
"Third World" peoples will be a
majority in California within 15
years. He complained that the en
rollment of Chicanos at Stanford
has "dropped dramatically." that
Casa Zapata, the hispanic theme
house, was under attack and that
Stanford has no department or
faculty designed specifically for

(he study of Chicano affairs.
Kim Liem, an intern for AASA.
noted that although there are
2,000 Asian students at Stanford
and that 17 percent of the fresh
man class is of Asian descent,
there exists nonetheless "tremen
dous pressure to assimilate" into
the majority culture here.
Liem also complained that the
AASA was forced to keep its offices
in the Old Firehouse. a once
condemned building she des
cribed as "home to many rats and
a cat."
