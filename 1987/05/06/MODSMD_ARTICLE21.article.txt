## An alternative to layoffs 
### VIVIAN FU Staff writer 
Because of increased foreign
competition In the high-tech field
and other factors, many Silicon
Valley companies have been forced
to streamline their operations
recently. Often, employers opt to
lay off workers. But are there
other, more effective ways to cut
costs?
According to research con
ducted by Economics Prof. Victor
Fuchs and Joyce Jacobsen of the
National Bureau of Economic Re
search, there appears to be a
much more favorable alternative
for both employers and employees.
In response to a decrease in
demand, businesses usually cut
back on output and input — labor
in particular. These cutbacks
have traditionally been layoffs or a
reduction in the overall work
force. But some firms, instead of
having fewer people work, have
the same amount of people work
fewer hours. Called short-time
compensation or work-sharing,
such a program shortens the
hours of all or most employees.
In an attempt to determine how

employees felt about uncom
pensated forced time off, over
1,500 employees who had experi
enced a 10 percent reduction In
pay and In hours of work were
questioned. The result of Fuchs
and Jacobsen's research Is a
working paper entitled "Employee
Response to Compulsory Short-
Time Work."
About 50 percent of the workers
surveyed reacted favorably to the
program. Married women and
older workers (those over age 45)
responded most favorably, with
married men and workers age 35
to 44 citing the most negative
responses.
Favorable reactions were attrib
uted to the increased leisure time
that workers could spend with
their families or on other activi
ties. Those employees who went in
to work anyway or worked on com
pany projects at home were the
least happy with the work-sharing
arrangement.
The Hewlett-Packard Corpora
tion Implemented a work-sharing
program from August 1985 to
March 1986 when employees were
forced to take off two days per
month without pay.

"People seemed to feel that type
of program (was) more suited to
the collective good. Everyone
shares when times are good as
well as when times are bad," ac
cording to Gene Endicott, senior
press relations representative at
H-P.
Because H-P has traditionally
tried to avoid layoffs, the manage
ment found the work-sharing pro
gram preferable to reducing the
number of its employees. Other
companies have different ideas on
the matter.
Sentry, a manufacturer of test
ing systems in San Jose, does not
have any sort of forced short-time
work policy.
"Some positions aren't worth it
to retain the same number of
workers. We would prefer having
three people work full-time to five
people each coming In a few times
a week," a spokesman said.
Because of the overall positive
reaction toward work-sharing
that Fuchs and Jacobsen encoun
tered, their paper suggests that
"other firms might give serious
consideration to compulsory
short-time work as an alternative
to layoffs."
