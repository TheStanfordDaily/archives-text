## Coming to the end of ‘Hill Street’ A 						'Blues' retrospective 
### JAMES LUJAN Editorial staff 
After seven years, the television
series that changed the face of the
medium has finally come to an
end. "Hill Street Blues" will air its
last original episode May 12 with
an episode called "It Ain't Over Till
It's Over."
"Hill Street Blues" premiered in
January 1981 and looked like it
was going to be a cops-and
robbers show, but it turned out to
be much more than that. "Hill
Street" belonged to the crime
drama genre, but it wasn't like
"Starsky and Hutch" or "Hawaii
Flve-O," which were also crime
dramas. It had a little more di
mension, a little more depth. In
stead of investigating and solving
a murder of the week, "Hill Street"
took the time to explore the per
sonal lives of police officers in
ways that we had never seen them
shown before-
Much more than that and more
importantly, "Hill Street" was, in
itself, revolutionary television.
From the very first time viewers
got a look at the grimy, chaotic
Hill Street station through the
lens of a bouncy hand-held
camera, they knew they were in
for something different. The
dialogue was often rapid-fire, hard
to hear, and overlapping. The
plots were a collection of five or six
stories interwoven throughout the
episode which were complex,
sometimes hard to follow, and
usually unresolved.
Ultimately, "Hill Street" offered
a real challenge to the television
viewing audience — to pay atten
tion to what was going on. As was
reflected in the Nielsen ratings,
most viewers didn't take up the
challenge. As a result, "Hill Street"
precariously hovered near the bot
tom of the prime-time program
ratings sheet during its first
season — despite favorable critical
reaction. Third-place network

NBC (which still had several years
to go before Cosby was on the air)
had nothing to lose by keeping its
only critically praised show on the
air, so NBC stuck with it, and
eventually people began to take
notice.
After sweeping a record eight
Emmy awards for Its first season,
"Hill Street" finally caught on. It
skyrocketed In the ratings and
became one of only three top-rated
shows for NBC. and was in
strumental in the network's even
tual climb to No. 1. At the peak of
its popularity, "Hill Street" was
the "Moonlighting" of its day.
Every Thursday night people
would be glued to their sets and
wouldn't miss "Hill Street" for
anything.
Understandably, "Hill Street
Blues" was not always able to sus
tain its standards of quality, but it
was always staggering to think
about how much worse "Hill
Street" would have to get before it
was as bad as everything else on
television. In its later years, "Hill
Street" suffered mainly because
there was no more new ground for
It to break. It subsequently began
to rely heavily on car crashes and
stunts to fill time; the plots
became tidy, neatly resolved
morality plays, and many of the
characters were getting stale and
weren't so interesting anymore.
There wasn't the sense of danger
or excitement that prevailed for
the first four years of the series.
There also came the correspond
ing decline in ratings.
But "Hill Street" never stopped
trying. The introduction of the
unorthodox, tough Lt. Norman
Buntz character (played by Dennis
Franz) injected fresh life into the
series. He became, by far, the
most interesting personality on
the show. (Indeed, his character
has become so successful that he's
being spun off into his own half
hour comedy-drama series next
season). In addition, this year's

scripts included significant con
tributions by Pulitzer prize
winning playwright David Mamet
and journalist Bob Woodward.
Overall. "Hill Street's" greatest
accomplishment will always be
that it dared to be different and
challenged its audience. "Hill
Street's" legacy will live on in such
series as "L.A. Law" and"St. Else
where." and, of course. "Hill
Street" reruns will live forever in
the heaven of syndication.
