# Quality TV in the '80s

### MARK TOMPKINS Editorial staff 
"Hill Street Blues" gets the axe next week, and
as an admirer of the show I have mixed feelings
about it biting the dust. In my formative years I
was something of a "Hill Street" junkie, and would
blab away about its virtues to anyone within ear
shot. Since then, as "Hill Street" has waned some
what and various pretenders to the throne have

grabbed the spotlight. I've become a bit more
guarded in my enthusiasm. It's a question of the
live Marlon Brando vs. the dead James Dean:
Whether 'tis nobler to stagger forward, becoming
a tired old fatty, showing occasional flashes of
brilliance, or to go out in a blaze of youthful glory,
leaving behind a good-looking corpse and a spot
less reputation.
Closet tube rat that I am, I often speculate that
all TV shows should be canceled after two or three
years. That way, bad shows would be put out of
everyone's misery and good shows would never
grow moldy, never lose that certain something
which made them stand out in the first place.
"Hill Street" did more than stand out; it grabbed
an entire industry up by the diapers, rewriting the
rules for quality along the way. It'd be easy to rag
on pre-"Hill Street" network TV, but it might be
rather pointless — everyone knows it was bad.
(Although I sometimes think network TV is like
the Holocaust: We should never lose sight of its
true horror.)
There's a lot that can be said about "Hill Street":
How it assumed that viewers were more than
slack-jawed dotards, how it showed '60s idealism
about social problems giving way to '80s realism,
how it made violence on TV ugly and upsetting for
the first time, and so on and so forth. The show's
dark, Charles Dickens-meets-Joseph Wambaugh
milieu found its moral center in Capt. Frank
Furillo, and actor Daniel Travanti was almost al
ways interesting, even when the show as a whole
hit the skids. The other actors, too, held up their
end even when the scripts seemed like the result
of someone leaving the word processor on over
night. All told, the various actors, writers and
directors — those boys with the marvelous hand
held cameras — can take a bow for their ac
complishments on "Hill Street." We've got a lot to
thank them for.
But also a lot to blame them for. In particular,
that crime against humanity, "L.A. Law."
Writer/producer Steven Bochco is the parent of
both "Hill Street" and "L.A. Law." On the latter,
he's gone over the top with all his worst '70s hang
over mannerisms. Bochco's characters bleed all
over each other; with their incessant touchie
feelie dialogue, they're a reminder that a lot of
what's considered "quality" writing on TV is sen
timental glop. Even in the heyday of "Hill Street,"
