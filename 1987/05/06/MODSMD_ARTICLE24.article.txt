# Quality TV in the '80s
## 
### MARK TOMPKINS Editorial staff 
"Hill Street Blues" gets the axe next week, and
as an admirer of the show I have mixed feelings
about it biting the dust. In my formative years I
was something of a "Hill Street" junkie, and would
blab away about its virtues to anyone within ear
shot. Since then, as "Hill Street" has waned some
what and various pretenders to the throne have

grabbed the spotlight. I've become a bit more
guarded in my enthusiasm. It's a question of the
live Marlon Brando vs. the dead James Dean:
Whether 'tis nobler to stagger forward, becoming
a tired old fatty, showing occasional flashes of
brilliance, or to go out in a blaze of youthful glory,
leaving behind a good-looking corpse and a spot
less reputation.
Closet tube rat that I am, I often speculate that
all TV shows should be canceled after two or three
years. That way, bad shows would be put out of
everyone's misery and good shows would never
grow moldy, never lose that certain something
which made them stand out in the first place.
"Hill Street" did more than stand out; it grabbed
an entire industry up by the diapers, rewriting the
rules for quality along the way. It'd be easy to rag
on pre-"Hill Street" network TV, but it might be
rather pointless — everyone knows it was bad.
(Although I sometimes think network TV is like
the Holocaust: We should never lose sight of its
true horror.)
There's a lot that can be said about "Hill Street":
How it assumed that viewers were more than
slack-jawed dotards, how it showed '60s idealism
about social problems giving way to '80s realism,
how it made violence on TV ugly and upsetting for
the first time, and so on and so forth. The show's
dark, Charles Dickens-meets-Joseph Wambaugh
milieu found its moral center in Capt. Frank
Furillo, and actor Daniel Travanti was almost al
ways interesting, even when the show as a whole
hit the skids. The other actors, too, held up their
end even when the scripts seemed like the result
of someone leaving the word processor on over
night. All told, the various actors, writers and
directors — those boys with the marvelous hand
held cameras — can take a bow for their ac
complishments on "Hill Street." We've got a lot to
thank them for.
But also a lot to blame them for. In particular,
that crime against humanity, "L.A. Law."
Writer/producer Steven Bochco is the parent of
both "Hill Street" and "L.A. Law." On the latter,
he's gone over the top with all his worst '70s hang
over mannerisms. Bochco's characters bleed all
over each other; with their incessant touchie
feelie dialogue, they're a reminder that a lot of
what's considered "quality" writing on TV is sen
timental glop. Even in the heyday of "Hill Street,"
it seemed like at least two charac
ters had to break down every
episode, there had to be at least
one scene of two men hugging and
everybody went around asking
each other how they felt.
What tempered these excesses
on "Hill Street" was a certain
world-weariness in the charac
ters. They knew that no matter
how bad the world was today,
they'd still have to deal with it to
morrow. so let's get on with it, OK
partner? Not so in "L.A. Law." In
the two-hour premiere of this se
ries. it seemed as if the legal pro
fession were being viewed from a
certain critical distance — Bochco
apparently had something to say
about "the system." as he did on
"Hill Street." But since then, the

show seems to be about
glamorous characters who just
happen to work at a law firm.
Once renowned for bringing a
cinema verite feel to TV. Bochco's
current notion of hard-hitting
realism is to have characters hold
ing a conversation in the men's
room. What grit!
Part of the original appeal of
"Miami Vice" was that it offered an
antidote to the Bochco/'Hill
Street" school of writing. (We're
taking a little tour of "quality" TV
in the '80s here, in case you were
wondering.) If the grimy world of
"Hill Street" was best captured in
claustrophobic close-ups, "Miami
Vice" was best characterized by
panoramic long shots, where
everyone kept a certain distance
from one another, trying to main
tain their spaced-out equilibrium.
What made the show distinctive
was its potent and evocative mise
en scene: In more ways than one,

southern Florida Is the end of
America, where corruption and
striking displays of violence are
glossed over with equally striking
displays of wealth. Miami seems
overrun with an all-star cast of
hipsters and flipsters, all of whom
seem to be auditioning for bit
parts in the latest Robert Stone or
Elmore Leonard novel. The only
person untouched by the drug
induced rot is that existential sad
sack. Lt. Castillo (Edward James
Olmos).
The latest entry in TV's quality
sweepstakes is, of course,
"Moonlighting." You didn't think
we'd leave out Maddie and Dave,
did you? ("St. Elsewhere" might
be in here if it had maintained the
standards of its first season. After
that it went streaking down the
path of least resistance).
"Moonlighting" is currently TV's
best high-wire act; no other series

constantly tries — and pulls off
so much. New episodes have
replaced the possibility ol a third
Boston album as conversational
laugh-getters, but they're worth
the wait. This season has seen a
brilliant "Taming of the Shrew''
parody, a lengthy Stanley Donen
dance number in one episode, and
a rewrite of "It's A Wonderful Life."
with Cybill Shepherd in the
Jimmy Stewart role, to name just
a few high points. The future of
"Moonlighting" is a little unclear
— I'm not sure how long a series
that laughs at everything, includ
ing itself, can be sustained. For
now. though, it's easily the best
example of what TV can be.
"What TV can be"; that sounds
lofty and Impressive, but only a
handful of shows have lived up to
the medium's potential. "Hill
Street nines" was the first. It was
— and it may sound strange — a
TV show that mattered.
