# Michael J. Fox finds the fast track of 'Success'
## 
### KAI KEASEY 
The new Michael J. Fox movie:
Would it be another dirge, like
"Light of Day," or the reason for
Fox's stardom, "Back to the Fu
ture"? Well, I liked it and think it's
about two-thirds the quality of the
latter, making it worthwhile en
tertainment.
Fox plays Brantley Foster, a
Kansas boy who has just finished
college and sets off for New York,
where he has a (dare I say it?)
yuppie job waiting for him. Unfor
tunately. he loses this job due to
an unforeseen hostile takeover.
Brantley must now find another
job. and after being turned down
by everyone — a scene probably
painfully familiar to graduating
seniors — he finally convinces an
obscure uncle, who happens to be
president of a huge corporation,
to give him a job. Brantley ends up
as a mail delivery boy, but longs
for a chance to "make" it, since he
won't be promoted quickly enough
for his liking.
While delivering mail to a
recently vacated office, Brantley

gets his big break when the phone
rings. On the line is a disgruntled
Midwestern client who does not
know about the recent firing and
needs a quick decision to be
made. Brantley provides the deci
sion and decides to assume the
identity of the fired worker. By
manipulating the memos he has
to deliver, Brantley finagles his
way into getting a secretary,
supplies and even a name plate on
his office door.
Brantley now has to juggle being
a mail delivery man and a top ex
ecutive, and since each dresses
differently and works in a differ
ent section of the building, he's re
quired to perform quick changes
that lead to many funny scenes;
he's caught with his pants down
in some interesting places. Fox
plays these scenes with a cute yet
self-assured poise that was irre
sistible to the teenage girls in the
audience. While I didn't find it ir
resistible. I liked it.
This part of the movie turns
into the when-is-he-going-to-get
caught double role, reminiscent of
Dustin Hoffman in "Tootsie." I

must give credit to script writers
Jim Cash and Jack Epps ("Top
Gun" and "Legal Eagles"), who
provide Brantley with many
original ways of escaping detec
tion when it seems certain he'll be
caught. The script as a whole is
good, with quite a few unexpected
plot twists, but it drags a little in a
few spots, such as when
Brantley's first look at Christine
(Helen Slater) turns into a fantasy,
and in the musical-beds scene
before Brantley's final detection —
but I digress.
Brantley, as suspected, comes
up with the correct answers to the
company's problem — a takeover
bid. His idea goes against the
president's and leads the presi
dent to believe that Brantley is a
spy from the takeover company.
The pres assigns Christine, with
whom he's having an affair, to
befriend Brantley and spy on him.
This leads to a love affair between
Brantley and Christine, which is
unpredictable because we don't
know if she is using him or is
really in love, and is a sharp con
trast to the other affair Brantley

has with, as he later finds out, the
boss' wife and Brantley's aunt
(Michelle Novak).
After Brantley compliments her
on her young looks, she seduces
him in her swimming pool in what
is the funniest scene in the movie
and definitely the most original
seduction scene I've ever wit
nessed. Anyway, these four char
acters battle it out for each other
and the control of the company,
which is resolved in the end, but I
won't give it away.
I liked Fox as Brantley because
he plays him with an energy that
was absent from his character in
"Light of Day," but reminiscent of
McFly in "Back to the Future."
He's also mastered facial express
ions, knowing when to wink, raise
an eyebrow or set a certain feeling
in his face. This light comedy
suits his wry acting ability much
better than the so-called drama of
"Light of Day." I still can't picture
Fox as any older than 18, but
that's a small complaint.
Although Brantley is the main
character, the most interesting
person here is Christine. At differ
ent times during the movie she's
an obedient puppet for the boss,
an intelligent businesswoman, a
beautiful lover and a defiant, inde
pendent woman. Slater plays all
these roles with ease, slipping in
and out of each as the plot
proceeds. The thing 1 like most
about her is her eyes, though. At
times they're beautiful, large
puppy eyes that can melt with a
look, while at other times they
become focused orbs of anger that
frighten. Fox and Slater also have
a great chemistry on screen.
The one character I had prob
lems with was Prescott, the uncle
and president (Fred Kinch). Even
though he gives Brantley a job,

he's really a manipulating, one
dimensional doofus. He's closed to
the ideas of the other executives,
encourages spying and blames
others for his mistakes. He also
neglects his wife and has an affair.
A real winner. 1 know he's
supposed to be the major antagon
ist. but he's unbelievable. To be a
successful business president,
you've got to have some good
qualities. Anyway. 1 hated him.
The movie is also well-made.
The plot flows easily without any
abrupt cuts or breaks. The camera
angles are original and varied. The
opening credits feature a back
ground of interesting, pleasing
and artsy shots of New York. Even
the music fits in well and is never
forced on us, as it is in so many
movies of the post-"Footloose" era.
All in all. "The Secret of My Suc
cess" is a well-made film with good
acting that might be just a little
weak in character development.
