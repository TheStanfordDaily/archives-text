## Baseball edges St. Mary's 5-4 
### JOHN LIS Editorial staff 
MORAGA — Somehow it all seemed too easy.
The Stanford Cardinal had rolled up three
straight non-conference wins by a combined
score of 51-12 before yesterday's non
conference finale at St. Mary's. The Cardinal
was lucky to escape the East Bay with its
fourth in a row.
It took a fluke bad-hop single by Scott Deluc
chi in the top of the 10th Inning to score Paul
Carey and give Stanford a 5-4 victory over the
Gaels here on a 96-degree afternoon at Louis
Guisto Field.
A tight game was not what the Cardinal. 39-
14. needed going into a four-game series with
California starting tomorrow. Another
blowout, a chance to let the starters rest before
trying to clinch the Pacific 10 Southern Divi
sion title, was what Stanford Coach Mark
Marquess would have liked.
"I'm hoping we'll win 10-0 every time, but I'll
take it," Marquess said.
Instead Marquess had to use six pitchers to
nail down the win. calling on sophomore Mike
Zuercher to shut the door on the Gaels in the

bottom of the 10th. Zuercher had pitched all of
one inning in his collegiate career, and that
came last May in a 14-4 blowout at St. Mary's.
"I was nervous a little bit." Zuercher said. "It
felt good to get in there and compete. It was the
first time since high school. I wasn't even plan
ning to pitch today, but (Dave) Reis didn't go
as far as they had hoped. Coach Marquess
said. 'Just do the job. throw strikes and trust
your stuff.' "
Reis had followed Brian Keyser's three
shutout innings by walking two with one out
in the seventh, but Steve Chitren came on to
get an inning-ending double play, then set the
Gaels down in order in the eighth.
In the 10th, Zuercher surrendered a one-out
walk to center fielder Pat Brady, who reached
second on a come-back chopper by Jerry
Cifarelli. With two outs and the tying run in
scoring position. Deron Johnson, the Gaels'
top hitter, stepped up to the plate.
"I just wanted to throw strikes and make
him hit my pitch," Zuercher said. "I had a base
open, so I wasn't worried about walking him."
Johnson made solid contact on a drive to
right-center, but It hung up long enough for
center fielder Toi Cook to run it down and give

Zuercher his first career save.
Rob Wassenaar pitched a flawless ninth in
ning to raise his record to 6-1 and record his
24th career win, fourth on the all-time Stan
ford list. Wassenaar struck out two of the three
hitters he faced.
Paul Carey was the hitting hero of the day,
going 4-for-5 with an RBI and the one-out
double off loser Dan Ward, 10-7, that started
Stanford's game-winning rally in the 10th.
Ward then walked Moraga native Doug Rob
bins, and Kevin Tahan came on to run for Rob
bins.
Delucchi then hit a three-hopper to Welsh
for what appeared to be the Gaels fourth
inning-ending double play, but instead of com
ing up to Welsh waist-high, the ball kicked
over his head and into center field.
The Cardinal had tied it in the seventh,
when Cook singled in the hole off Welsh's glove
to score Ron Witmeyer, who had reached on an
error by second baseman Brett Smith on an
other would-be double play and had advanced
to second on a poor bunt by Frank Carey that
saw pinch-runner Gary Sawka cut down at
third. It was the only unearned run for Stan
ford despite five St. Mary's errors.
