### ROBERT PORTNOY Staff writer 
Roger Miraglla shot an even-par
72 yesterday to place six shots be
hind leader Jim Strickland of
Arizona State after three rounds
of the Pacific 10 Conference
Championships in Eugene. Ore.
Strickland stands at 217, with
Mlraglia at 223 In 15th place. The
Cardinal dropped from seventh to
eighth place overall, one shot be
hind Oregon State. Stanford trails
California by 11 shots.

After shooting 364 yesterday,
UCLA still leads the team competi
tion with a two-day total of 1,091.
Arizona trails the Bruins by just
three shots, while ASU has a slim
shot at the team title, trailing
UCLA by 15. Host Oregon is at
1,111.
"Both UCLA and Arizona are
playing really well, and ASU is
good, but Bill Mayfair (the No. 1
collegian) isn't playing his best,"
Stanford Coach Tim Schaaf said.
The individual race is even

tighter. Tony Joyner of Oregon
trails Strickland by just a shot, as
do Cal's Jon Hummelt and Bruin
David Rhorer.
Stanford freshman Brad
Benbrook and sophomore Brad
Geer each shot 77 yesterday and
share identical 2285. Freshman
Steve White, the low Cardinal after
36 holes Monday, fell to 81 yester
day and is currently at 230. Soph
omore John Mahon rebounded
yesterday with a 76 and stands at
234. Freshman Mark Funseth,
who was disqualified from the

second round Monday and
therefore eliminated from the in
dividual competition, shot 80.
"Roger and Benbrook have been
the most consistent players for us
the past few tournaments,"
Schaaf said. "John played a little
better with 76. Brad Geer has just
come back for us and he's really
played only once, the front nine
yesterday when he was 8-over
during a five-hole stretch. He was
3-under the rest of the day. He's
getting a lot of confidence back in
his game."
