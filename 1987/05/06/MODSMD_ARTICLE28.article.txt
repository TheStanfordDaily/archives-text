# Stanford cyclists finish 3rd in league
## 
### WITOLD J. HENISZ Staff writer 
The Stanford cycling club
retained its third-place ranking
in the 22-team Western Col
legiate Cycling Conference after
a tough weekend of champion
ship competition.
The Cardinal entered the
three-race weekend with a
chance for a comeback victory
and an overall seasonal cham
pionship, but ended with a bit
ter taste left by an overwhelm
ing victory by last year's cham
pions, the Mustangs of Cal
Poly-San Luis Obispo.
A strong second-place perfor
mance by Stanford in the 4.8-
mile time trial on Saturday
morning moved It ahead of
former league-leader UC-Santa
Barbara. Cal-Poly, however,
won the race by a 25-point mar
gin to move into first place.
Olympic Training Center
graduate John Moffet rode ex
ceptionally well for a fourth
place finish. Tom Moyer placed
sixth to cap off an impressive
Stanford finish in the men's 'A'
division.
Other squads also fared well.
In the B' race. Hank Dart took
third while Andy Fitzhugh and
Tim Weihs also placed in the
top 20. Steve Miller and John
Shinn tied for fourth place In
the 'C' race and Laura Rodman
scored In the women's competi
tion.
Arcadio Ramirez finished
10th in a breakaway group,
while Tom Moyer took second
in the field sprint for 14th in
the men's 'A' race. Tim Weihs
placed second in the 'B' race by
outclimbing and outsprinting
an experienced field in only his
fifth race of the year. Sopho
more Steve Miller won the 'D'
race for yet another fine finish
in his first year of racing. Laura
Rodman and Jennifer Hubbert

both placed in the women's
field.
Stanford had dipped back
into its third-place position
only 28.5 points behind UCSB
but an overwhelming 234
points behind Cal Poly. The
criterlum had become
meaningless as the Mustangs
essentially clinched the league
championship for the second
year in a row.
The criterlum circled the
Maples Pavilion parking lot In
the shape of an inverted 'L' that
included a 180-degree hairpin
turn. The course was a virtual
heaven for a fast-paced
sprinter, a fact that should
have favored the Cardinal. Un
fortunately, the pace continued
at an unheard-of level through
out the race and none of the
Cardinal sprinters remained
strong at the finish.
The women's race proved to
be the Cardinal highlight for
the afternoon. Laura Rodman
broke away from the field and
was caught only by a single
rider on the last lap. Rodman
placed second, while Jennifer
Hubbert and Eileen La Porte
finished fifth and sixth after
blocking to help Rodman stay
off the front.
Brock La Porte placed third
in the B' race to cap off yet an
other fine first-year racing per
formance. The La Portes were a
welcome addition to this year's
team as they provided consis
tent top-five placlngs despite
having never raced previously.
Cal Poly rider Robert En
zerink lapped 62 of his 69 com
petitors in the toughest 'A' race
of the season to bring him the
individual title for the
weekend. Tom Moyer was the
only Stanford rider not to be
lapped by Enzerink as he
placed ninth.
