# Sabbaticals at Stanford
## Knight journalism fellows chosen 
### JAY BHATTACHARYA Staff writer 
Twelve American and seven
foreign journalists have received
John S. Knight journalism fellow
ships to spend the 1987-88 aca
demic year at Stanford.
The main purpose of the pro
gram is to give "working jour
nalists a chance to spend time
away from daily pressures" and
take advantage of the "resources
available at a university like Stan
ford," said Harry Press, managing
director of the program.
A Knight fellow receives free tui
tion and a $20,000 stipend, and
often continues to draw his salary
from his employer, according to
Peter Mancusi, a participant in
the Knight program this year.
During their year at Stanford,

Knight fellows audit classes and
attend weekly seminars. Fellows
"can study whatever they want."
Press said.
' Knight fellows give back much
to the University." Press said.
"They lead seminars in many dif
ferent areas and often participate
in many ways."
The American recipients and
their papers include Paul Ad
dison, Honolulu Advertiser; Kath
leen Burke, Smithsonian Maga
zine; John Epperheimer, San
Jose Mercury News; Joyce Gem
perlein, Philadelphia Inquirer;
Rick Gore, National Geographic.
Also among the American
recipients are Neil Henry, Wash
ington Post; Paul Jacobs. Los An
geles Times; Cynthia Loose,
Detroit News; Georgia Tasker,
Miami Herald; Karyn Taylor, ABC
News' "20/20"; Barbara Vroman,

The Mercury (Pottstown. Pa.);
Larry Whiteside, Boston Globe.
Foreign journalists receiving
the award are Piergiorgio Ac
quaviva. II Giorno (Milan, Italy):
Chen Hansheng, World Economic
Herald (Shanghai, China); Jerzy
Dzieciolowski. Zycie Gopodarcze
(Warsaw, Poland): Rosario Garcel
lano, Manila Standard (Manila,
Philippines): Norma Marcos,
Abeer (Jerusalem): Cornelia von
Wrangel, Frankfurter Allgemeine
Zeitung (Frankfurt, West Ger
many): Kook-Hee Yon. Dong-A
Libo (Seoul, Korea).
The 12 American winners were
chosen out a pool of 82 applicants
from across the country for their
"demonstrated professionalism."
"Diversity was stressed in the
selection process." Press said.
The American awards are
funded by a grant from the Knight

Foundation, set up in memory of
newspaper publisher John
Knight. The foundation receives
funds from the newspaper chain
that Knight formerly owned.
International recipients are
supported by the Reuter Founda
tion, the Asia Foundation, the
German Marshall Fund of the
United States and the John J.
McCloy Fund.
The Knight fellowship program
is now in its 22nd year.
Peter Mancusi, a Knight fellow
for the current academic year
from The Boston Globe, observed
that the grant was a great oppor
tunity to "come out to Stanford for
a year and study whatever."
Mancusi said that while many
Knight fellows focus on areas of
study related to their jobs back
home, many also look into totally
unrelated fields.
