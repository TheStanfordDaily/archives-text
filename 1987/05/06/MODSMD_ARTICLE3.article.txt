# Jordan Scholars plan draws harsh criticism
## 
### ANN MARSH Staff writer 
The University's decision this year to
name 200 admitted freshmen as academi
cally exceptional "Jordan Scholars" has
sparked protest among members of the
Stanford community.
The program was implemented to help
Stanford offset a nationwide trend toward
merit-based financial awards thai threat
ens the continuation of Stanford's need
based financial aid policy, according to
Dean of Undergraduate Admissions Jean
Fetter.
While granting that "there are good argu
ments on both sides of this issue." Univer
sity President Donald Kennedy expressed
concern about the program.
"Once you do a program like this that is
merit-based you are only one step from fin
ancial awards." said Kennedy, who empha
sized that he hasn't yet decided where he
stands on the issue.
Amanda Kemp, chairperson of (he Black
Student Union, argued that the Jordan
Scholar designation is a "marketing device"

that would pick "not necessarily the most
intelligent people, but the best-prepared"
students.
Current Council of Presidents member
Kim Crawford said: "I think that Stanford
recognizes that there's a great disparity be
twei i the opportunities that exist for stu
dents in high school. The Jordan scholar
ships favor those who've had better oppor
tunities."
But Robert Eustis, chairman of the Fac
ulty/Student Committee on Admissions
and Undergraduate Financial Aids,
defended what he called the "academic
awards."
"Not everybody who comes to Stanford
has equal opportunities. That's the beauty
of this place," Eustis said, adding that
people should understand that "the pur
pose of the scholarships is to attract the
brightest students."
One of this year's Jordan Scholars, who
preferred to remain anonymous, said the
award had little effect on her decision to
come to Stanford although said she enjoyed
the recognition.
"They didn't define the goals ot
the program very well," she said.
"I don't intend to play it up In
any way (after arriving at Stan
ford)," she added.
Others expressed concern that
the program will foster divisive
elitism among members of the
freshman class.
"A number of people see (the
program) as a way of labeling
people," Kennedy said.

"I would worry if it could be
demonstrated that they (the Jor
dan Scholars) were coming from
more advantaged backgrounds."
he added.
"I'm not convinced that it's not
going to be divisive," COP member
Carey White said.
According to Fetter, the Jordan
Scholar program emerged out of
concern over the amount of stu
dents Stanford loses to schools of
fering large financial awards to in
coming freshmen.
Janet Irons, associate director
of financial aid at Harvard, said
Stanford's Jordan Scholarships
"probably won't have a significant

effect" on Harvard's admissions
returns.
According to Irons, the Harvard
National Scholarship Program,
which is similar to the Jordan
Scholar program, "is both a
recognition and an award, but it
is also a recruiting tool."
Along with Princeton, Yale and
M.1.T., Harvard and Stanford tend
to compete for the same students,
yet all five institutions maintain a
need-based financial aid policy,
according to Robert Huff, Univer
sity director of Financial Aids.
A move to merit-based financial
awards may "result in students
being bought," said Huff.
