# Senate supports grape boycott
## 
### MONIQUE SCHEER Senior staff writer 
After a debate lasting nearly two
hours, the ASSU Senate voted last night
to support a statewide grape boycott led
by the United Farm Workers.
The senate also approved a bill asking
University President Donald Kennedy to
respond to a set of demands issued
today by a coalition of campus minority
groups. (See related story, this page.]
Approximately 30 students, primarily
from the Hispanic community, came to
the meeting to support UFW representa
tives. who were also present.
In the open forum portion of the
meeting, spokespersons from both

groups protested the use of toxic pes
ticides by grape farmers.
In support of the boycott, the senate
bill recommends that "all University
Food Service groups and Tresidder Un
ion remove fresh table grapes from
campus until the UFW officially calls an
end to the boycott."
Five types of pesticides are targeted by
the UFW, according to Marion Moses of
the National Farm Workers Health
Group. These chemicals, which are used
on nearly all agricultural products, have
increased the incidence ofÂ«cancer and
birth defects among farm workers and
present a significant risk to the con
sumer, according to Moses.
Boycotting table grapes would be a
step toward the end goal of "getting the

pesticides banned from all crops." ac
cording to senator
"It's not an issue with grapes, it's an
issue with the governor (and regulatory
agencies)." a representative for the
grape farmers said.
Senator Danny Berns said he was
against the boycott because he felt the
UFW had singled out table grapes be
cause the industry has "had its prob
lems with the UFW and therefore (the
issue) has become political."
Berns was one of five senators who
walked out of (he meeting when a vote
was called in order to prevent a quorum.
Leyton called (heir action "profoundly
undemocratic" and said it showed dis-
respect for the students who came
to the meeting in support of the
boycott.
When the walkout failed to
prevent a vote on the bill, the ob
jecting senators attempted to
push through an amendment that
would change the bill to a boycott
of "all fresh agricultural products
which have been treated with one
or more of the five pesticides."
The senate passed the bill in its
original form, 11-4, with two
abstentions.
There was considerably less
debate regarding the bill asking
Kennedy to consider and respond
to demands issued by minority
communities "in an open state
ment to the University" before the
Centennial Cornerstone Weekend
May 14 to 16.
Senator Fred Cate asked the
senate to postpone voting on the
bill until after Kennedy receives a
proposal for a five-year study of
minorities on campus that is
being prepared by Dean of Under
graduate Studies Carolyn Lougee.
Leyton said the study and the
recent requests of minorities were
not directly related.
The senate passed the bill, 10-5.
In other business, the senate
validated and certified the second
Council of Presidents election held
last week. It also allocated funds to
the Program Board for continued
funding of student groups.
