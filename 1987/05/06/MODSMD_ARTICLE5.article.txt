# Fear of police shutdown
## Donner likely to cancel street dance 
### LAURA REED 
Donner residents may cancel this year's
Donner Street Dance because they are con
cerned police enforcement of alcohol policy at
three parties last weekend indicates that the
police would be likely to shut down the party,
according to a Donner resident assistant.
According to Donner RA Matt Fingerhut,
Donner residents will vote on the issue today,
but at a meeting last night attended by most of
the residents, the majority thought the risk of
having the party closed down was too great to
justify the time and expense of the undertak
ing.
"The events of last weekend, with the police
carding people at other parties, made us think
that there is a strong possibility of a shut

down. We don't want to take the risk of was
ting $3,000 in dorm funds and spending
hours of effort organizing the party, only to
have it shut down a few minutes after it
starts." Fingerhut said.
Last weekend, police entered parties at
Sigma Chi, Beta Theta Pi and Loro and asked
bartenders to check IDs of students being
served alcohol.
Fingerhut also noted that members of the
resident staff of Donner were concerned about
their possible liability for illegally purchasing
alcohol for minors. (See related story, this
page.)
"Students were also worried that a party or
ganized by freshmen, with freshmen serving
alcohol and freshmen being responsible for
carding other students, not to mention drink

ing, would probably be closed down by the
police." Fingerhut explained.
Stanford Police Sgt. Nick Brunot denied that
police enforcement of the alcohol policy on
campus has recently become stricter than it
was in the past. "There has been no change in
our attitude toward enforcing the law against
alcohol consumption by people under 21. Last
weekend was normal enforcement. We've
closed parties and carded students before and
will continue to do so," he said.
Brunot declined to comment on police
criteria for closing down campus parties.
Acting Dean of Student Affairs Norm Robin
son said police enforcement of alcohol policy
last weekend — and possibly in the future —
could have positive effects on stu
dent life.
"If it makes people behave more
responsibly and safely, good will
come out of it. I hope this kind of
action makes people aware that
they're not living in a vacuum
here." he said.
Robinson attributed the police
actions last weekend to the behav
ior of some students attending the
parties.
"Students were walking outside
with open containers of alcohol,
parties are not being controlled,
and hosts are not taking responsi
bility for what happens." he said.
According to Donner resident

Scott McManigal, one of the main
organizers of the street dance,
freshmen in Donner are disap
pointed that what they consider to
be a new policy will probably force
them to cancel the annual all
campus party.
"We've already spent hours
making arrangements and getting
donations from dorms, and people
really wanted to have the party. It
seems unfair because the school
hasn't been this strict before. But
tonight at the meeting the general
consensus was that it just wasn't
worth the risk to have the party,"
McManigal said.
McManigal and Fingerhut said
the dorm will discuss tonight the
possibility of having an alcohol
free street dance after residents
vote on whether to cancel their
original plans.
