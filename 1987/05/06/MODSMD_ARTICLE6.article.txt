## 
### MARK ROGOWSKY Staff writer 
The lack of minorities and
women among the Law School fac
ulty is a problem that must be ad
dressed soon, according to a pro
posal debated yesterday by a six
person panel at the Law School.
The panel consisted of members
of the Student Coalition on
Women and Minority Hiring,
members of the Law School's Fac
ulty Hiring Committee and other

professors at the Law School.
The coalition submitted the pro
posal to Law School faculty on
April 23. The proposal calls for
changes in the way the applicant
pool is created and specific
timetables and numbers for ac
complishing these hiring goals.
Law student Charic Daniels, a
member of the coalition, began
yesterday's debate by outlining
the proposed changes to the
search process for new faculty
members.

The changes highlighted by
Daniels include:
□ Formulating a statement of al
ternative hiring processes which
will expand contact with women
and minorities, drawing on ideas
not only from the Stanford com
munity but also from other law
schools with more success In
hiring women and minorities.
□ Creating a position with spe
cific responsibility for enlarging
the pool of potential minority and
women candidates.

□ Requiring that at least one
woman and one minority profes
sor sit on every faculty hiring com
mittee.
Law student Peter Haviland,
also a coalition member, ex
plained at the debate the hiring
goal recommended by the coali
tion for the Law School. Of the six
faculty positions currently open,
and of every six positions that
subsequently become available.
