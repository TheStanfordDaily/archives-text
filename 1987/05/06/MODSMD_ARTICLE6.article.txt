# Law panel urges minority hiring increase
## 
### MARK ROGOWSKY Staff writer 
The lack of minorities and
women among the Law School fac
ulty is a problem that must be ad
dressed soon, according to a pro
posal debated yesterday by a six
person panel at the Law School.
The panel consisted of members
of the Student Coalition on
Women and Minority Hiring,
members of the Law School's Fac
ulty Hiring Committee and other

professors at the Law School.
The coalition submitted the pro
posal to Law School faculty on
April 23. The proposal calls for
changes in the way the applicant
pool is created and specific
timetables and numbers for ac
complishing these hiring goals.
Law student Charic Daniels, a
member of the coalition, began
yesterday's debate by outlining
the proposed changes to the
search process for new faculty
members.

The changes highlighted by
Daniels include:
□ Formulating a statement of al
ternative hiring processes which
will expand contact with women
and minorities, drawing on ideas
not only from the Stanford com
munity but also from other law
schools with more success In
hiring women and minorities.
□ Creating a position with spe
cific responsibility for enlarging
the pool of potential minority and
women candidates.

□ Requiring that at least one
woman and one minority profes
sor sit on every faculty hiring com
mittee.
Law student Peter Haviland,
also a coalition member, ex
plained at the debate the hiring
goal recommended by the coali
tion for the Law School. Of the six
faculty positions currently open,
and of every six positions that
subsequently become available.
two should go to women and two
to minorities, Haviland said.
Haviland noted that only three
members of the current 36-
member faculty are women and
that only four are either black or
Latino.
If the coalition-backed proposal
were implemented as written for
the next 12 hires, only 14 percent
of the faculty would be female and

only 16 percent would be black or
Latino, Haviland explained.
"These figures are dramatically
lower than percentages in the Law
School student population,"
Haviland said. "And in response to
the question 'Are these goals un
reasonable?' I answer with a flat
no."
Law Prof. Ron Gilson, a member
of the hiring committee, said that
"the proposals are focused on the
wrong problem. The problem is
less with numbers than with the
kind of person the Law School is
looking to hire.
"We're looking for people who
have promise to be one of the best

people In their field," Gilson ex
plained. "Across the board I per
ceive It being more difficult to hire
people who fit the characteristics
we're looking for. The problem Is
broader than just minorities."
Incoming Law School Dean Paul
Brest agreed with Gilson, noting
that the proposal offers "little dis
cussion about hiring criteria. The
criteria are normed after white
males. Something we ought to
consider is whether these criteria
are gendered and ethnocentric
and parochial in a certain way.
There are notions of what counts
as excellence that we are simply
not considering."
