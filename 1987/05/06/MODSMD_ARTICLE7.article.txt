# RF reconsiders dorm alcohol ban
## 
### FRANK QUARATIELLO Staff writer 
A resident fellow who last
weekend informed residents
that no dorm funds could be
used for the purchase of alcohol
has now concluded that RFs
and resident assistants are
probably not liable for damages
when alcohol is served to
minors in dorm-sponsored
events.
Larkin RF Bruce Rosenstock
spent part of last week search
ing out legal precedent in an ef
fort to determine his role and
responsibility as an RF under
the University's current alcohol
policy. He said his research was
catalyzed by the recent death,
apparently alcohol-related, of
junior David Dunshee.
In a letter issued to Larkin
residents and Residential Edu
cation officials Friday,
Rosenstock cites some legal
cases which seemed to indicate
that RFs and RAs were not
legally responsible for the ac
tions of intoxicated, underage
students.
Rosenstock's letter states fur
ther that he is willing to recon

sider his earlier position that
dorm funds not be used to buy
alcohol. "I am . . . not sure I
still want to exercise that right
(prohibiting alcohol in the
dorm), if I have it."he states.
"Let's all ponder this together."
Rosenstock cites the Califor
nia court case of Bradshaw v.
Rawlings, in which the court
observed that "the auth
oritarian role of college admi
nistrators is gone. Students
have demanded rights which
have given them a new status
anil abrogated the role of in
loco parentis of college admi
nistrators."
In Bradshaw v. Rawlings. the
court further noted: "College
administrators no longer con
trol the general area of general
morals. . . . Today students
vigorously claim the right to
define and regulate their own
lives," according to Rosen
stock's letter.
In his letter. Rosenstock also
cited the California State Ap
pellate Court case of Baldwin v.
Zoradi. in which the court said:
"Only by giving them responsi
billties can students grow into re
sponsible adulthood. Although
the alleged lack of supervision had
a disastrous result to this plain
tiff, the overall policy of stimulat
ing student growth Is in the
public interest."
Rosenstock also mentioned a
1978 amendment to the Califor
nia Civil Code on alcohol which,
according to Rosenstock.
"explicitly states that someone
who furnishes alcohol to another
who then Is injured or causes in
jury to another, is not liable for
those Injuries."
Examining the text of this
amendment, Stanford Law Prof.
Robert Rabin said the ap

plicability of the statute was not
clear In the case and that the per
son who consumed the alcohol
was a minor.
"If the Intoxicated student was
above the age of 21, then the
residence staff would not be liable
for the student's actions accord
ing to California state law. If,
however, the intoxicated student
is below the age of 21, then the
courts could go either way," Rabin
added.
"With respect to the liability of
persons who sell or furnish liquor
to intoxicated minors, the statute
seems to apply only to tavern
owners and people with liquor
licenses. Therefore, it sounds as
though the University (including
the RFs and RAs) would not be
liable," Rabin concluded.
A Res Ed publication issued at
the beginning of this year to all

RFs and RAs would seem to dis
agree with Rabin's and
Rosenstock's conclusions.
The publication states, "It Is
possible that In the event of a law
suit based on a claim that Injury
or death resulted from alcohol use
In the residences, the RFs and
RAs would be sued as Individuals
acting as agents of the Univer
sity."
Norm Robinson, acting dean of
Student Affairs, said the Res Ed
publication was not meant to im
ply that RFs and RAs could be held
legally responsible for the actions
of Intoxicated students.
"That's an ambiguous area and
there are many different circum
stances," Robinson said.
Robinson said the Res Ed publi
cation was merely warning RFs
and RAs that their names might
come up In the event of a lawsuit.
