# RF reconsiders dorm alcohol ban
## 
### FRANK QUARATIELLO Staff writer 
A resident fellow who last
weekend informed residents
that no dorm funds could be
used for the purchase of alcohol
has now concluded that RFs
and resident assistants are
probably not liable for damages
when alcohol is served to
minors in dorm-sponsored
events.
Larkin RF Bruce Rosenstock
spent part of last week search
ing out legal precedent in an ef
fort to determine his role and
responsibility as an RF under
the University's current alcohol
policy. He said his research was
catalyzed by the recent death,
apparently alcohol-related, of

students.
Rosenstock's letter states fur

dorm funds not be used to buy
alcohol. "I am . . . not sure I

(prohibiting alcohol in the
dorm), if I have it."he states.
"Let's all ponder this together."
Rosenstock cites the Califor
nia court case of Bradshaw v.
Rawlings, in which the court
observed that "the auth

nistrators is gone. Students
have demanded rights which
have given them a new status
anil abrogated the role of in
loco parentis of college admi
nistrators."
In Bradshaw v. Rawlings. the
court further noted: "College
administrators no longer con
trol the general area of general
morals. . . . Today students
vigorously claim the right to
define and regulate their own
lives," according to Rosen
stock's letter.
In his letter. Rosenstock also
cited the California State Ap
pellate Court case of Baldwin v.
Zoradi. in which the court said:
