Secord begins contra testimony
WASHINGTON — The Nlcaraguan rebels received only *3.5 mil
lion of the *18 million diverted from Iran arms sale profits — far
less than originally estimated — retired Air Force Maj. Gen. Rich
ard Secord said yesterday on the opening day of congressional
hearings into the Iran-contra affair.
Secord, who operated a tiny fleet of airplanes that delivered
privately funded arms to the rebels and supplied logistical help for
the Reagan administrations Iran arms sale, provided Congress
and the American public with the first nearly complete accounting
of money that was siphoned from profits generated by the ship
ments to Iran.
Breaking a six-month silence, the one-time Department of
Defense official insisted that his multimillion-dollar contra-supply
effort was intended to carry out President Reagan's Central Ameri
can policy and had explicit support from top administration offi
cials — including former CIA Director William Casey.
Casey was said by Secord to have conceived the idea of asking
an unnamed country — believed to be the tiny, oil-rich sultanate
of Brunei — to contribute *10 million to the contras. Casey told
Secord at a meeting in May 1986 that he would ask Secretary of
State George Shultz to solicit the contribution.
Secord also offered a second-hand account of a meeting in
which Vice President George Bush allegedly discussed details of
the contra-supply network.
Speaking without visible emotion under the glare of television
lights and the stern gazes of the 26 members of the House and
Senate investigating committees, Secord flatly insisted that he
had done nothing wrong — even though his contra-supply effort
was clearly designed to circumvent a law on the books in 1985 and
1986 that prohibited direct U.S. military aid.
While he praised Lt. Col. Oliver North and former national se
curity adviser John Poindexter, both key White House players in
the Iran-contra affair, Secord condemned Attorney General Edwin
Meese for his "grossly inaccurate" and "unforgivable" disclosure
last November that profits from the Iranian arms sales had been
diverted to the Nlcaraguan rebels.
Hart denies immoral actions
NEW YORK — Fighting for survival as a presidential candidate,
Gary Hart conceded yesterday that he made "a mistake" by behav
ing in a way that could be misunderstood during his encounter
last weekend with actress Donna Rice. But he declared he
"absolutely did not" do anything "immoral."
In his first public appearance since the Miami Herald's account
of the episode was published. Hart refused to provide his own ver
sion of the events. Instead, after acknowledging error, he sought
to quell the furor that threatens his front-running candidacy for
the Democratic nomination by focusing on the newpaper's hand
ling of the story. He branded it as "false and misleading."
"Did I make a mistake by putting myself in circumstances that
could be miscontrued? Of course I did. That goes without saying,"
Hart said in a six-minute statement on the affair at a luncheon
meeting of the American Newspapers Publishers Association.
"But did I do anything immoral? I absolutely did not," he said.
In attacking the Herald's handling of the episode, Hart charged
that the story was based on "spotty surveillance" of his and Rice's
movements in and out of his town house in Washington's Capitol
Hill section. And, "most outrageously," Hart declared, the
reporters had refused an offer to interview "the very people who
could have given them the facts before filing their story, which we
asked and urged them to do."
Answering Hart's charge that the Herald had refused an offer to
interview the other participants in the episode. Herald political
editor Tom Fiedler, who wrote the story, said Hart himself refused
a request by the Herald team to interview Rice and a woman com
panion.
Fiedler acknowledged he later received a call from Hart's friend
and political associate William Broadhurst, who accompanied
Hart and Rice and her companion during part of the weekend and
contends that Rice actually spent the night at his Washington
home with himself and the companion. Broadhurst offered a pos
sible chance to interview the two women, but Fiedler said the offer
was conditioned on the Herald's delaying publication of the story.
Few aliens seeking legal status
WASHINGTON — The huge national network formed to grant le
gal status to millions of illegal immigrants eased into operation
yesterday, with the flow of applicants at most sites more a trickle
than a flood.
Several private groups that are assisting the Immigration and
Naturalization Service process immigrants attributed the low
turnout to aliens' fears of arrest and of having their families bro
ken up if some members fail to qualify for legal status.
But an INS spokesman in Washington called the first-day turn
out "intentionally light," saying immigrant counseling agencies
were encouraged to allow the INS staff to gain expertise.
Both INS and the private groups predicted that the numbers
would rise as the one-year period of legalization goes on.
Meese-Wedtech ties to be probed
WASHINGTON — The anti-corruption unit of the Department of
Justice is looking into Attorney General Edwin Meese ties with
Wedtech Corp., a New York defense contractor now under federal
investigation, as a first step in determining whether an indepen
dent counsel should be appointed, officials said yesterday.
Disclosure of the "threshold inquiry" into Meese's conduct was
made by James McKay, the independent counsel investigating
conflict-of-interest charges against Lyn Nofziger, President
Reagan's former political adviser, who lobbied for Wedtech after
he left the White House.
Wedtech is under investigation for allegedly seeking to obtain
government contracts and influence a congressional inquiry by
giving illegal fees to several local and federal officials in New York
and Maryland.
Questions about Meese's role were raised by Sen. Joseph Biden,
D-Del., and Rep. Peter Rodino. D-N.J., chairmen of the Senate
and House Judiciary committees, in a letter to McKay.
Biden and Rodino asked about steps Meese took when he was
counselor to President Reagan to help Wedtech obtain a contract
let by the Department of Defense without competitive bidding.
They also posed questions about Meese's investment of *60,000
in a company whose president is involved with Wedtech and his
failure to remove himself until April 8 from the federal Wedtech
probe.
Reagan may have misquoted Lenin
MOSCOW — The words of Vladimir Lenin, the founding father
of Bolshevism and the closest thing to a saint in the officially a
theistic Soviet Union, are venerated In this part of the world.
So it was only natural that the Kremlin would wince when Presi
dent Reagan invoked Lenin's name, and what he said were his
words, in a specrh Sunday at the Statue of Liberty in New York.
Vowing to support the anti-government forces in Nicaragua as
long as he is president, Reagan said the Soviet goal in Central
America is clear, and he quoted Lenin as saying:
"The road to America leads through Mexico."
According to Pravda, the Soviet Union's most authoritative in
terpreter of Communist thinking. Lentn did not say and could not
say what Reagan said he said. Pravda accused the president of dis
torting history.
