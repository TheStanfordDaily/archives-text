## THE
						STANFORD DAILY An Independent Newspaper Avoid overreaction 
### 
Last weekend Stanford police entered on
campus parties and began to crack down on
underage drinking. On Monday Police Capt.
Marvin Moore stated that enforcement could
expand in the future to include citing un
derage drinkers. The weekend also saw
Larkin Resident Fellow Bruce Rosenstock
ban the purchase of alcohol with dorm
funds.
Rosenstock has since offered to reconsider
the ban, but his initial action must be listed
among the others as one overreaction to the
recent death, apparently alcohol-related, of
20-year-old David Dunshee.
By entering parties and requesting that
those being served show identification, the
police are making an unwarranted and vile
intrusion into student life. Perhaps more im
portant, the new police policy — and it is a
new policy — works against the rational alco
hol policy developed by the Residential Edu
cation that teaches responsible drinking to
those who choose to drink. If the police

decide to take a heavy-handed posture
toward campus drinking, they won't succeed
in preventing underage drinking but will
only destroy the responsible attitudes toward
it.
The decision to end dorm alcohol purchase
in Larkin is yet another example of a knee
jerk reaction that assumes students are ir
responsible. But it is the officials who are ir
responsible in declaring positions without
first considering the ramifications of them or
openly discussing concerns with students.
Before jumping to conclusions, officials
should more carefully consider the problems
of acting without thinking. Undermining the
Res Ed alcohol policy, unduly attempting to
prevent students from making their own
decisions and asserting authority over dorm
funds are all ill-advised in that they show no
respect for individual responsibility and in
fringe upon students' rights. They are, fur
thermore, unlikely to even achieve the goal of
preventing another tragedy.
