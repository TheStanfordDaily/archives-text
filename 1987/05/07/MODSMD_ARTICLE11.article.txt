# Policy will backfire

### 
We, the students at Stanford,
are on the threshold of having our
University make an unfortunate
and Irrevocable mistake. I am
speaking about the recent im
petus for stronger enforcement of
drinking laws on our campus,
possibly touched off by the stu
dent drowning in Lake Lagunita
during Rush. I do sympathize
with the family and friends of
David Dunshee, but I do not think
that stricter regulation on un
derage drinking is in any way the
right response to such an event.

RICK WEISBERG

This past fall I transferred to
Stanford from Rutgers University,
a school locked into enforcing a
strict drinking policy upon its
many undergraduates. One of the
first and best thing I noticed upon
arriving at Stanford was its much
more effective drinking policy, in
which credit is placed into the
hands of the student to moderate
his own activities. I fear now that
our University will soon follow the
steps taken by my former school,
thereby increasing, rather than
decreasing the problem.
The route Stanford is heading
down sounds like good sense, but
so does the Rutgers policy. In ac
tuality neither is a good idea. At
Rutgers nobody under the age of
21 is permitted to have or
consume any alcohol, which Is in
concurrence with the state law. In
addition, heavy regulations about
what kind of alcohol, how much
and where it may be consumed
(closed rooms only) are placed
upon the students who are of age
in order to make it less available to
the underagers. Furthermore, the
overwhelming task of enforcing
these restrictions falls for the
most part upon the preceptors
(positions equivalent to Stanford's
resident assistants), who are
much closer to their dormmates
on a daily basis than the police.
And finally, every party, from

three guests to campus-wide,
must be registered beforehand
with the Office of Residential Edu
cation and the person registering
assumes full responsibility for the
actions of all students attending
that party from the time they
arrive and through the night
(including after they leave and un
til they awake the next morning).
These regulations appear to be
almost a proper and reasonable
way of limiting a student-body
drinking problem, but instead
they serve to enhance it.
First of all, policies like this do
not stop underage students from
drinking; they merely make the
matter more inconvenient. Be
cause alcohol is less readily
available, students go overboard.

These regulations appear to be almost
a proper and reasonable way oj limit
ing a student-body drinking problem,
but instead they serve to enhance it.

Social drinking virtually disap
pears. Instead, on those less fre
quent occasions that underage
students find alcohol available,
they then drink to get drunk. No
more wasting time because there's
no telling how much time they will
have or when they will have the
opportunity again.
Rutgers has an incredibly high
drunk-driving rate and nearly
every dorm on campus faces
weekly vomit disasters. Also, in or
der to avoid getting caught, stu
dents drink in more secluded and
closed situations, leading them in
the direction of a secretive, alco
holic way of drinking.
Inasmuch as the preceptors are
mostly responsible for patrolling
their own dorms, the
preceptor/student relationships
have much less quality than the
RA/student relationships I've ob
served here. The preceptor Is
someone to hide from, not turn to

(like an RA).
And finally, because of this
"drink-to-get-drunk" attitude of
most of the Rutgers students, only
the housed fraternities are willing
to take enough chance to register
a party; and they do it merely for
image, not for fun. Thus, the
major party/social scene revolves
around and is limited to the frat
parties, leaving all students out in
the cold who don't enjoy that sort
of party.
Now I'm not saying that if Stan
ford adopts similar zeal in enforc
ing the drinking laws, the same
exact consequences will necessar
ily result. However, this much I
feel is certain if alcohol is made
harder to come by for underage
students:

□ Casual drinking will give way to
"drinking-to-get-drunk";
□ Alcohol will become more of a
mystery and thus increase the
chances of its misuse:
□ Since alcohol and EANABs will
no longer be side-by-side at a party
(either the legitimate party will
have only EANABs. or the illegiti
mate gathering will offer only alco
hol, not wanting to waste time
with EANABs on one of the rare
alcohol-available occasions); and
□ Greater differentiation will be
made and barriers will develop be
tween "drinkers" and "non
drinkers" thereby disunifying the
student body.
Rutgers cannot change its
policies without a long transition
period of chaos (the students are
too used to not being trusted to
moderate themselves). Let's stop
Stanford before it's too late.

These regulations appear to be
almost a proper and reasonable
way of limiting a student-body
drinking problem, but instead
they serve to enhance it.
First of all, policies like this do
not stop underage students from
drinking; they merely make the
matter more inconvenient. Be
cause alcohol is less readily
available, students go overboard.

Social drinking virtually disap
pears. Instead, on those less fre
quent occasions that underage
students find alcohol available,
they then drink to get drunk. No
more wasting time because there's
no telling how much time they will
have or when they will have the
opportunity again.
Rutgers has an incredibly high
drunk-driving rate and nearly
every dorm on campus faces
weekly vomit disasters. Also, in or
der to avoid getting caught, stu
dents drink in more secluded and
closed situations, leading them in
the direction of a secretive, alco
holic way of drinking.
Inasmuch as the preceptors are
mostly responsible for patrolling
their own dorms, the
preceptor/student relationships
have much less quality than the
RA/student relationships I've ob
served here. The preceptor Is
someone to hide from, not turn to

(like an RA).
And finally, because of this
"drink-to-get-drunk" attitude of
most of the Rutgers students, only
the housed fraternities are willing
to take enough chance to register
a party; and they do it merely for
image, not for fun. Thus, the
major party/social scene revolves
around and is limited to the frat
parties, leaving all students out in
the cold who don't enjoy that sort
of party.
Now I'm not saying that if Stan
ford adopts similar zeal in enforc
ing the drinking laws, the same
exact consequences will necessar
ily result. However, this much I
feel is certain if alcohol is made
harder to come by for underage
students:

□ Casual drinking will give way to
"drinking-to-get-drunk";
□ Alcohol will become more of a
mystery and thus increase the
chances of its misuse:
□ Since alcohol and EANABs will
no longer be side-by-side at a party
(either the legitimate party will
have only EANABs. or the illegiti
mate gathering will offer only alco
hol, not wanting to waste time
with EANABs on one of the rare
alcohol-available occasions); and
□ Greater differentiation will be
made and barriers will develop be
tween "drinkers" and "non
drinkers" thereby disunifying the
student body.
Rutgers cannot change its
policies without a long transition
period of chaos (the students are
too used to not being trusted to
moderate themselves). Let's stop
Stanford before it's too late.
