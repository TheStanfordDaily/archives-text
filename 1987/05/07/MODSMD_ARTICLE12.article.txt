# Reaganauts can't grasp reality
## 
### 
To the reader who finds a restless political
column decidedly out of sync with the tem
peraments of spring: Do not turn this page! 1
assure you this is no polemical grind. His
torians and political scientists may turn the
page if they wish.
By now the epithets of the Iran fiasco are,
well, settled in the American conscious. What
do we have so far? Contragate, Reagangate,
Irangate, Iranscam, Iranamok, etc. I know. I
know, the issue is graying. But indulge me
this one last time and permit me to add one
more phrase to the list: Realityamok.

Is there a phrase that more aptly characteri
zes the current state of affairs in the White
House? I think not. Realityamok is. in fact, an
accurate summation of the past six years in
what has become a surreal zoo on the shores of
the Potomac.
Don't worry. I'm not going to Join the ranks
of critics like Alexander Haig. David Stock
man. other previous high-level officials who've
since departed the administration and cer
tainly many in the national press corps who in
sist that President Reagan seems dangerously
out of touch with reality.
I have nothing else to say about the summit
in Reykjavik that wasn't really a summit, or
the hostage trade (Danlloff for Zakharov) that
wasn't really a hostage trade, or the press con
ferences that are never press conferences

(however infrequent they may occur) or the
arms transfer to Iran to free American
hostages that wasn't really "dealing" with the
terrorists (even if the evidence cited in the
Tower Report does contradict how the presi
dent perceives the events).
I will, however, mention that Reagan's
public reactions to the AIDS epidemic have left
much to be desired. For some strange reason, I
expected a little more than a 20-minute speech
six years into the crisis from the man consid
ered to be the leader of the Western world.
As a result, the medical community and
grass-roots organizations have risen to the oc
casion. I think someone is going to have to tell
the president that a refusal to publicly and
resolutely acknowledge the reality and the ur
gency of the AIDS crisis is not going to make
the epidemic disappear.
But Reagan is not the only one in the current
administration whose perceptions of reality
border on the bizarre. Consider the behavior of
State Department Legal Adviser Abraham
Sofaer and his unabashedly manipulative in
terpretations of the Antiballistic Missile (ABM)
Treaty. This is the same treaty that poses cer
tain limitations on the development of systems
for the Strategic Defense Initiative (more
popularly known as Star Wars).
Apparently he and Assistant Secretary of
Defense Richard Perle have decided to rein
terpret the treaty. They call it a "broader inter
pretation." a phrase that is vague enough to
shield the obvious lack of substance in their
position.
According to them, the United States has the
right — if not the mandate — to develop and
test precisely those space-based, exotic tech
nologies the treaty explicitly bans. The treaty.

Realityamok is, in
fact, an accurate sum
mation of the past six
years in what has
become a surreal zoo
on the shores of the
Potomac.

mind you, is one of the few things our govern
ment has done right in the arms control arena.
Whether or not you believe in the substance
of the treaty, however, is ultimately beside the
point. Despite the fact that the drafters of the
treaty agreed "not to develop, test or deploy
ABM systems which are sea-based, air-based,
space-based or mobile land-based," Sofaer
manages to find some Justification for his
dogged insistence that the administration has
some recourse in the language of the treaty.
How he manages to say all this with a straight
face is another one of those mysteries stitched
into the fabric of life.
Sofaer's obvious misperceptions are. at best,
an embarrassing reminder that the American
people know better. And 1 wonder if our col
lective discontent signals the need for a new
breed of political adviser: Send in the reality
consultants!
