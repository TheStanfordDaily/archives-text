# Discuss homosexuality

### 
I visited my high school last week to talk to com
puter science classes. Returning for the first time in
10 years brought back many good and bad
memories, but I was preoccupied with one strong
feeling and the memory of one distant weekend.

STUART REGES

What gave me enough determination to aim my car
at a concrete wall doing 90? And when I somehow
escaped from that accident intact, how did I calmly
move on to the next plan: enduring three hours of
muscle spasms brought on by the strychnine before
my family found me and called an ambulance? Such
strength of purpose comes once in a lifetime, if at all,
and I wanted to remember why it came to me as a
desire to die.
Senior year was a turning point. I had been un
popular for so long that I believed my personality was
defective, that I wasn't meant to be liked. But sud
denly I had drinking buddies and women wanted to
date me.
I should have been incredibly happy, but I found
myself miserable. I started socializing normally, but I
couldn't fit in. Dating women felt like going to the
dentist, while spending time with my drinking
buddies felt wonderful. In short, I was a young gay
person desperately trying to be a young non-gay per
son and I couldn't accept my failure.
The memories came flooding back as I walked
through the halls between classes. Someone behind
me said, "He acts so gay," and a chill came over me.
Were they talking about me? I pretended not to hear,
as I had done so many times before. Later I heard
someone yell, "You fag!" This time I did what I had
never done before: I turned to look at the person. He
was shouting at a friend.
I heard similar remarks five more times that day,
and I looked each time to find the remark meant for
someone else. But when I was a senior, every gay
remark reminded me of the struggle inside of me, so
that every day was filled with pain.
Things went from depressing to bleak as I

searched for books on gay issues In the school li
brary, the town library and two local bookstores. I
found a few ancient books on homosexuality in the
town library and nothing anywhere on AIDS. I
argued with the manager of a "family bookstore."
Don't gay people have families? Wouldn't all families
be happier if their children had the information they
need to avoid AIDS?
I was now vividly remembering what high school
was like. In order to "save the children," the adults
censored any mention of gay issues. Only jokes fil
tered through and those only reminded me of the in
tense hatred of gay people. I was dying in the dark
ness of that silence. Only luck saved me.
My memories of high school still stir up deep emo
tion, but now I try to channel that energy into more
constructive acts. This week is Gay and Lesbian
Awareness Week and I am making my annual plea for
people to take the opportunity to discuss gay Issues.
We are all trained to be nervous about the subject, so
it takes some effort.
The topic of homosexuality is stickier than any
other topic. Everyone thinks, "If you talk about it,
you must be one." That's why the fraternities never
invite the Gay and Lesbian Speaker's Bureau to give
presentations ("It would hurt Rush"). When non-gay
people discuss the issue they always end their com
ments with, "But don't get me wrong; I'm not gay."
Why is everyone so nervous? It's silly. A university
is supposed to stimulate discussion of all topics. But
so often young gay people are nervous about seeming
ignorant or insensitive, so neither group brings up
the subject even though everyone wants to talk about
it.
I hope we can all find the opportunity this week to
break down the normal barriers. For those of you
who are gay, talk about yourself with that friend
you 've been dying to open up to. For those of you who
aren't, ask your gay friends those burning questions
you've been too nervous to bring up. And everyone,
take the opportunity to attend some of the fine GALA
Week events. Only through informed discussion can
we break the silence and save the gay children who
are dying in the dark.
