Cheerleaders
a great idea
The only organized chants
heard at last season's football
games were "Flo Mo is our home."
At the basketball games they were
"Bubblehead!" Occasionally, eight
daring fans spelled out "Stanford"
on pieces of cardboard. Neverthe
less, in light of such pathetic
support, many people question
the recent establishment of cheer
leaders.
Cheerleaders are a long-overdue
step in restoring enthusiasm to

the Stanford fans. They will be
entertaining and inspiring. Stan
ford's true fans — and there are
many — will shake off their lack
luster reputation and unite.
Cheerleading is no panacea and
our teams will not magically
achieve victory. However, a bois
terous, supportive crowd can
inspire exceptional play (does Big
Game '86 ring a bell?). Moreover,
lethargy alienates the players and
the fans. Cheerleaders will help
bridge the gap between them.
The Band, an extremely
talented and entertaining group,
fails miserably in this respect.

Chanting "White Punks on Dope"
and singing "All Right Now" does
little to relay fan support to the
players.
We must not bow down to the
elitist malcontents who will in
evitably dismiss cheerleading as a
crime against intellectualism.
Cheerleaders will not retard stu
dent ingenuity, devastate Stan
ford's reputation or incite a fas
cist uprising. Fans will simply
appreciate their talent and effort.
Hopefully, next year we will really
be able to give the opposition the
Axe.
