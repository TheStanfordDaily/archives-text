## Sites and sounds of the City 
### 
Hotel Californian
405 Taylor St.
San Francisco
On a dark city skyway, cool Jog
curls my hair. The warm smell of
the city rises up through the air.
Up ahead in the distance. I saw
the neon light. My pen was
ready, my time was slim. 1 had to
stop for the night. . . .
But wait, this is the Hotel
Californian. not California. This
hotel is actually the extreme oppo
site of the desert inn depicted by
the Eagles in their famous ballad.
The name, the Hotel Californian,
is really quite puzzling, consider
ing that the hotel advertises
"European charm in the heart of
San Francisco." Despite the inap
propriate title, the Hotel Califor
nian is a delightful place to stay
for any length of time.
Located only a few blocks from
Union Square on Taylor, this old
Victorian hotel was not exactly
what I expected. Upon entering
the charming lobby, 1 was struck
by the ornate decorations of this
spacious common room. The mul
ticolored marble, high ceiling and
antique furniture welcomes one in
from the bustle of the city.
It's true that Hotel Californian
does not offer many of the modern
day amenities that many others
supply. There is no sauna, hot
tub, game room, pool or even
HBO. Instead, the Hotel Califor
nian concentrates on other com
forts to make your stay enjoyable.
Considering that the prices
range from ®52 a night and up, I
wasn't expecting much, but the
rooms were actually quite nice. My
room, however, was sparse on
decoration. The stark white walls
could have used some wallpaper or
a new coat of paint, and the fur
nishings were not by any means
lavish. But it was spacious and

comfortable. There was plenty of
closet space, the bathroom had a
tub and the bed was firm. More
Important, the bath towels were
large enough to fit around your
waist and the water pressure was
strong, even on the 14th floor.
These small comforts made up for
the lack of HBO.
Hotel Californian, being in the
heart of San Francisco, has no
need for the entertainment that
other hotels provide. Your night
life will be found in the city, not in
the pool or game room. The hotel
offers comfortable rooms at a very
reasonable price, a great combina
tion considering its location.
Fisherman's Wharf
Fisherman's Wharf should not
be missed by the first-time
tourist, but returning to the
Wharf lacks the excitement of your
original visit.
Fisherman's Wharf may be the
largest tourist trap on the West
Coast. Riddled with gawdy
souvenir shops, overpriced res
taurants and freak-show
museums, the wharf offers little
for the native San Franciscan.
For a new visitor, the activity on
the wharf is captivating, but after
experiencing it once, the wharf
loses its charm. Being bumped
about in the midst of thousands of
photo-snapping tourists for a
second time is not my idea of fun.
Despite these negatives,
however, there are some positive
aspects of the wharf. Here are just
a few of the things one can enjoy
in the wharf area that are all in the
heart of the tourist attractions. Of
course, the crowds are still in
excess, but these activities are
worthwhile.
For anyone who hasn't taken
the tour of "The Rock", it is a

must. The Alcatraz tour is one of
the few tours leaving i>om t'ie pier
that is worth your money. The
one-hour trip is both informative
and fun. The tour guides are well
prepared and have many tales of
famous convicts and attempted
escapes. For those who have taken
the tour, it may be worthwhile to
return only to spend a few more
moments in solitary confinement.
Pier 39 is both crowded and ex
pensive, but it also has some of
the most unique shops you will
find anywhere. Almost every store
is a specialty shop, and the goods
range from hobby horses to
Christmas ornaments. Just wan
dering around the pier you are
sure to find something that inter
ests you, from a kite store, to an
NFL shop, to a chocolatier.
Ghiradelli Square is also a
must. The shops are interesting
and the restaurants are above
average. The renovated chocolate
factory still produces some excel
lent chocolate in its fountain
shop, and despite the prices,
chocolate lovers should not miss
the hot chocolate.
I also would recommend, believe
it or not, the Haunted Gold Mine.
Entering this ghost house at
10:30 p.m. as it was closing con
tributed to the effect of this attrac
tion, and I thoroughly enjoyed
myself. Anticipating a kiddie ride.
I entered confident that I had just
wasted $3.75. To my surprise, I
was quite scared by the numerous
attractions they had. As I walked
through the mine, I would
cautiously check what was beyond
each corner in fear of something
dropping from the ceiling. If you
venture into this establishment,
make sure you are the only one
there, if possible, and don't miss
the electric chair; it's quite a
shock.

"European charm in the heart of
San Francisco." Despite the inap
propriate title, the Hotel Califor
nian is a delightful place to stay
for any length of time.
Located only a few blocks from
Union Square on Taylor, this old
Victorian hotel was not exactly
what I expected. Upon entering
the charming lobby, 1 was struck
by the ornate decorations of this
spacious common room. The mul
ticolored marble, high ceiling and
antique furniture welcomes one in
from the bustle of the city.
It's true that Hotel Californian
does not offer many of the modern
day amenities that many others
supply. There is no sauna, hot
tub, game room, pool or even
HBO. Instead, the Hotel Califor
nian concentrates on other com
forts to make your stay enjoyable.
Considering that the prices
range from ®52 a night and up, I
wasn't expecting much, but the
rooms were actually quite nice. My
room, however, was sparse on
decoration. The stark white walls
could have used some wallpaper or
a new coat of paint, and the fur
nishings were not by any means
lavish. But it was spacious and

comfortable. There was plenty of
closet space, the bathroom had a
tub and the bed was firm. More
Important, the bath towels were
large enough to fit around your
waist and the water pressure was
strong, even on the 14th floor.
These small comforts made up for
the lack of HBO.
Hotel Californian, being in the
heart of San Francisco, has no
need for the entertainment that
other hotels provide. Your night
life will be found in the city, not in
the pool or game room. The hotel
offers comfortable rooms at a very
reasonable price, a great combina
tion considering its location.
Fisherman's Wharf
Fisherman's Wharf should not
be missed by the first-time
tourist, but returning to the
Wharf lacks the excitement of your
original visit.
Fisherman's Wharf may be the
largest tourist trap on the West
Coast. Riddled with gawdy
souvenir shops, overpriced res
taurants and freak-show
museums, the wharf offers little
for the native San Franciscan.
For a new visitor, the activity on
the wharf is captivating, but after
experiencing it once, the wharf
loses its charm. Being bumped
about in the midst of thousands of
photo-snapping tourists for a
second time is not my idea of fun.
Despite these negatives,
however, there are some positive
aspects of the wharf. Here are just
a few of the things one can enjoy
in the wharf area that are all in the
heart of the tourist attractions. Of
course, the crowds are still in
excess, but these activities are
worthwhile.
For anyone who hasn't taken
the tour of "The Rock", it is a

must. The Alcatraz tour is one of
the few tours leaving i>om t'ie pier
that is worth your money. The
one-hour trip is both informative
and fun. The tour guides are well
prepared and have many tales of
famous convicts and attempted
escapes. For those who have taken
the tour, it may be worthwhile to
return only to spend a few more
moments in solitary confinement.
Pier 39 is both crowded and ex
pensive, but it also has some of
the most unique shops you will
find anywhere. Almost every store
is a specialty shop, and the goods
range from hobby horses to
Christmas ornaments. Just wan
dering around the pier you are
sure to find something that inter
ests you, from a kite store, to an
NFL shop, to a chocolatier.
Ghiradelli Square is also a
must. The shops are interesting
and the restaurants are above
average. The renovated chocolate
factory still produces some excel
lent chocolate in its fountain
shop, and despite the prices,
chocolate lovers should not miss
the hot chocolate.
I also would recommend, believe
it or not, the Haunted Gold Mine.
Entering this ghost house at
10:30 p.m. as it was closing con
tributed to the effect of this attrac
tion, and I thoroughly enjoyed
myself. Anticipating a kiddie ride.
I entered confident that I had just
wasted $3.75. To my surprise, I
was quite scared by the numerous
attractions they had. As I walked
through the mine, I would
cautiously check what was beyond
each corner in fear of something
dropping from the ceiling. If you
venture into this establishment,
make sure you are the only one
there, if possible, and don't miss
the electric chair; it's quite a
shock.
