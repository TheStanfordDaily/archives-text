# Senior survey
## Stanford popular with grads 
### LESTER BASKIN 
Last year's seniors gave their Stanford
education — and the Western Culture
program in particular — high marks in
a wide-ranging annual survey released
by the Registrar's Office Tuesday.
Ninety percent of seniors polled —
one-third of the 1.615 graduating —
rated the general quality of their under
graduate education as "very good" or
"excellent."
While they were only the third
graduating class subject to the Western
Culture requirement, more than six out
of 10 felt the yearlong course had made a
"great" or "very great" contribution to
their knowledge and skill level, by far the
largest such response for any academic

requirement.
The Western Culture program has
come under intense fire from student
groups who claim the current curricu
lum fails to address the contributions of
non-Western societies, women and
minorities.
In contrast, students gauged their
knowledge of non-Western culture as
"fair" to "poor," the lowest ranking
among all distribution requirements.
More than four out of 10 students said
six other course requirements had made
"great" or "very great" contributions to
their knowledge or skill level.
The six top-ranking academic areas
included social processes and institu
tions, technology and applied sciences,
natural sciences, writing, human devel

opment, behavior and language and
foreign language.
Faculty were rated "very good" or
"excellent" in teaching by nearly 70 per
cent of students, but only one-third gave
these ratings to instruction by teaching
assistants.
Students were mpst enthusiastic
about the overseas program. Two-thirds
said this experience was "excellent," and
23 percent said it was "very good."
About one-third of all Stanford under
graduates study overseas at some point
in their college careers.
Almost one-half of last year's seniors
did not work in public service while at
Stanford. Only one in nine said they had
volunteered through the Public Service
Center — even less than those who
became involved through fraternities
and sororities, academic courses,
campus voluntary organizations and
student residences.
Responding to personal questions,
seniors said other students affected
their personal growth the most. Stu
dents said their Stanford education
greatly encouraged their intellectual
achievement and autonomy, but did not
foster creativity or risk-taking as much.
