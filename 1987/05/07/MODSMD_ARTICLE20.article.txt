Jim Steyer
Lecturer in political science
When you graduated Jrom
Stanford as an undergraduate,
where did you see yourself in
10 years?
I either saw myself on a beach
in Tahiti selling coconuts or
doing work on poverty.
Why did you choose civil rights
and civil liberties as your area
of law?
It was what I cared about.
Since I was 16, I had been
working in Harlem teaching
basic reading. I like kids.
Is Stanford racially diverse
enough in your opinion?
There is room for tremendous
improvement, and I think more
focus should be on socioeco
nomic factors.
Which is more fulfilling, private
or academic work?
I love them both. I am a civil
rights lawyer for the only nation
ally based civil rights firm. I also
teach little kids to read in East
Oakland once a week.
What has teaching at Stanford
taught you?
I learn from students every
day. This generation has
reached a zenith in being career
focused which I think has
bottomed out with Reagan.
What are the goals you want to
accomplish as a lawyer and a
teacher?
I don't think of myself as a
lawyer, rather as an advocate.
Thus, I'd like to make a signifi
cant contribution to making a
more fair and just society for all.
As a teacher I would like to in
spire others to care about the
same things by coming to their
own independent conclusions.
Do you agree with divestment

in South Africa?
Yes I do because it is an im
portant symbolic statement for a
center of higher learning like
Stanford to make.
What was your major at Stan
lord?
Having a good time. Actually
political science was, but I didn't
think of it as my major because
Stanford makes you learn more
about yourself.

What is your opinion on the
Reagan Library?
I was one of the original people
who opposed it. I think it would
have given the appearance of
partisanship, especially with
Hoover's role already here.
Are you happy?
Yes, and Stanford students
contribute to my happiness. I
hope they know that.
