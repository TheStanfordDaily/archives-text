Foreward
"Rubber Soul" came out on disk
last week. You must get It immedi
ately. even if you don't have a CD
player. If you don't know why, I
refer you to our "Please Please Me"
review from March. Surely you've
clipped it and put it on your
refrigerator door?
Well, I don't have much else to
say. Just wanted to get my name
in the paper.
Reviews this week are In popular
misspellings of Stanford's student
union.
REM - "Dead Letter Office"
Tressider, Tresslder, Tressider,
Tressider
I was hobbling around Tower

Records getting the usual no help
from the cashiers, who were
trying to tell me how great the Iron
Maiden concert was, when lo and
behold, drop my eyes in a bucket,
there was another REM album sit
ting right there, and I thought
back to what a radio announcer
said a week or so ago. He said that
REM was releasing an album of B
sides and singles. I checked and
Indeed, that was the case. I took It
right home and put It on my
phonograph and listened to it all
the way through, and went out to
a barbecue thinking, well, this is a
weird album.
See, what you get for your *6.99
Is 15 B-sides and outtakes from
everything from their first piece of
major vinyl, "Chronic Town," to
last year's "Lifes (sic) Rich
Pageant." Predictably, It is a mish
mash of lighthearted covers and
spoofs together with a coupla
seriously Impressive songs. Be
cause It is all over the place, I can't
really review it as an album, but
more as Individual singles. As
Peter Buck writes in the liner
notes, this album Is more like
browsing in a junk shop than any

thing else.
Well, there are certainly some
treasures with "Crazy," a Pylon
cover; "Pale Blue»Eyes," one of
three Velvet Underground covers;
and "Wlndout" and "Bandwagon,"
two out-takes from albums,
making you remember that
songwriting and playing in a band
are supposed to be fun as well as
moving. The best thing about this
album Is its songs In which REM
recaptures the sound of the
band's first three records, where
the production sounds like the
Athens, Ga. boys they were record
ing in an empty bar. Sometimes
you gotta like cruddy production.
This is no album to blow you
away, but it's got some good stuff
and If It's REM, that's pretty damn
good stuff.
For REM fans, this album is a
must-get, and for new REM fans. 1
would recommend the previous al
bums first. Nevertheless, anyone
who has a CD player should pick
up the CD of this album not only
because of the sound but because
it includes "Chronic Town." That
alone makes it well worth the *87
or whatever you people pay for the

things.
Husker Du — "Warehouse:
Songs and Stories"
Old Union, Old Union, Old Union,
Old Union
Reviewing records for KZSU
Picks Is an easy job Indeed. It's
never necessary to review a bad
record, except to satisfy the oc
casional vindictive urge. It gives
one a good excuse to listen to loud
music instead of doing real work.
And since no one ever reads the
reviews, we don't get a lot of hate
mail — it's hard to complain when
you've never even heard of the
band in question.
Well, If you haven't heard of
Husker Du, it's about time you
pricked up your ears. Hailing from
Minneapolis, but named after a
Scandinavian board game, the
band consists of Bob Mould (loud,
great guitar), Greg Norton (bass)
and Grant Hart (drums). All three
members sing. Mould and Hart
share songwriting and production
duties: This egalitarian ethos ex
tends even to the order of the
songs on the album: the two pen

songs individually but the band is
careful to alternate between
songwriters. The band got its
start on SST Records, the original
home of speed metal, and cranked
out four or five great LPs in rapid
succession before being picked up
by Warner Brothers for the release
of "Candy Apple Grey," their last
album.
Husker Du has come a long way
since the early days with SST.
Their first album, "Land Speed
Record," proudly featured about
20 songs, not one of which was
longer than two minutes. One of
my favorites from that album,
"Gilligan's Island," clocked in at
less than 60 seconds. Screaming,
supersonic guitar playing, and
super-short songs have all disap
peared. "Warehouse" has 20
songs, but this time on two discs
— some of the tunes clear the four
minute mark.
Yet, for all the changes, Bob
Mould's trademark "wall of sound"
guitar is still the heart of the
band's sound, and Grant Hart's
drums still drive the songs,
keeping Mould's guitar-working

hard to keep up. The main differ
ence is that. gasp, these guys have
gotten good at writing pop tunes
to go with their lyrics. There
simply isn't a bad song on this al
bum. The band has developed Its
original sound without losing its
distinctive style: the songs are
now fit for casual listening, but
It's safe to say they won't make it
onto commercial radio's AOR for
mat. Behind the guitar lurk bells,
snippets of conversation and
other additions that enhance the
album and testify to the increas
ing sophistication of Hart and
Mould as producers as well as
songwriters.
Well, I ask you to trust me one
last time. Buy the new Husker Du
album. The last time 1 checked It
cost a measly eight bucks — *8 for
20 songs! You have damned little
to lose, because even If you don't
like it you can use Mould's blaring
guitar to bother your entire dorm.
Think of it as a powerful deterrent
to stereo wars.
