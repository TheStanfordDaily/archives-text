# 'Malone': Burt's latest stinker
## 
### JAMES LUJAN Editorial Staff 
Another strike for Burt Reynolds. He keeps trying
to appear In a film that will once again make him a
major star, but he unfortunately keeps ending up in
one lousy film after another. Needless to say, his
latest flick, "Malone," Is not going to be his comeback
film.
Burt Reynolds films seem to be falling into two
categories lately. There's the "God, I can't believe this
is so bad" Reynolds film, epitomized by such greats
as "Stroker Ace." "Cannonball Run II" and "Stick."
Then there's the "Not good, but nice try, Burt" films
represented by "Sharky's Machine." "The Man Who
Loved Women" and "Heat." "Malone" falls into the
latter category. It's an almost respectable effort, but
It is so unenthusiastically directed and there are so
many holes, lapses and contrivances in the boring
plot that it never quite comes together into the
suspense thriller that it should have and could have
been.
The movie Is based on a novel, "Shotgun," which is
part of a continuing series of apparently popular ac
tion thrillers by Curtis Brown. In "Malone." Reynolds
plays an aging hit man who has had enough of his
job and simply wants to be free and alone to travel
the countryside. Of course, fate — and the
screenwriter — have other plans. His car ends up
breaking down In a small, deteriorating rural town
where he meets and befriends the owner of the only

garage in town (Scott Wilson) and his pretty, adoles
cent daughter (Cynthia Gibb). While he waits for his
car to be fixed, he becomes unwittingly caught up in
a dispute involving a plot to takeover the town by a
super-patriot, survivalist millionaire (Cliff
Robertson) who wants to use the town as a base for
his band of patriotic assassins. It's all less interest
ing than it sounds, believe me.
Burt Reynolds has shown us before that he can.
indeed, act if given the right material as he proved in
"Deliverance" and "Starting Over." In "Malone" he
actually turns in a halfway decent performance as a
big. strong, grim, silent type, but we've seen this type
of character so many times before in films from
"Dirty Harry" to "Extreme Prejudice" that the overall
effect of the character is uninteresting and dull.
The rest of the talented supporting cast is similarly
wasted. The fine character actor Ken McMillan
("Ragtime," "True Confessions") seems to be tossed
in as an afterthought as the corrupt sheriff, and Cliff
Robertson ("Charly," "Brainstorm") seems truly out
of place and disinterested as the psychotic mil
lionaire. The only other member of the cast who
comes out with an OK performance is Cynthia Gibb.
who is ga-ga eyed for macho Burt, which probably
wasn't much of an act anyway.
Don't bother to waste your time on "Malone."
Reynolds has a new movie "Rent A Cop" coming out
out pretty soon. If Burt's lucky, maybe that flick will
fall into the little-used category of "A good Burt
Reynolds movie." We'll have to wait and sec.
