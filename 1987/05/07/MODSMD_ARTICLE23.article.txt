" Pictures From The Water
Trade"
John David Morley
New York, Harper and Row,
1986.
There are two ways to write a
travel book. I know it's opening
a Pandora's box to call them
feminine and masculine ap
proaches, but I will anyway.
Writers can either adopt the
feminine approach and immerse
themselves entirely in a descrip
tion of place, or assert their
presence in that place and write
about how it affected them, or
they it.
John David Morley's "Pictures
From the Water Trade" fits into
the latter, masculine category.
His is not so much a book about
Japan as a book about a brood
ing, introspective man coming
to terms with himself and Asia.
Morley, an Oxford graduate,
goes to Japan on a Japanese cul
tural exchange scholarship.
With only minimal command of
the native language, he is sent
to Waseda University in Tokyo to
learn more Japanese and to
engage in "cross-cultural
studies", although he isn't really
sure what those studies are. For
months, Morely leads the in
sular existence of an uncon
nected foreigner, having
"isolated his own world without
really gaining access to the
other, remaining uneasily
suspended between the two."
Everything changes when he's
introduced to the "water trade"
through a random encounter in
a restaurant. The water trade, or
mizu-shobai, is one of the 40 or
so words Morley glossaries in
the back of the book; mizu
shobai is defined as "the vulgar
term for any precarious form of
trade yielding an income en
tirely dependent on the
patronage of its customers."
Simply put. bars and bordellos.
Through his experiences with
the water trade, Morley meets
the friends and lovers that
people his stories, and much of

the book is a progression from
cabaret to geisha bar.
Not that the entire book is one
bar brawl; Morely writes at
length about his attempts at cal
ligraphy, his home life and his
visits with Japanese families.
But he feels he can define some
thing essential about the
Japanese through a study of
Japanese night life. "The water
trade is a valve." he says. "This
was where the strain of
Japanese society was born,
more or less everything finds a
reflection or an echo here."
In order to study the water
trade, Morely becomes com
pletely involved with its activi
ties. His narrative alternates be
tween philosophical rumina
tions on Japan and the
Japanese, and tales of good old
times had in Tokyo geisha bars.
In these accounts, he's refresh
ingly up-front about what he
and others are doing: There is
no moralizing here or any at
tempt to "objectify" his action.
This close perspective can be
wonderfully appealing; in fact,
Morely is weakest when he at
tempts to be distanced and ob
jective.
The biggest problem I have
with "Water Trade" is that
Morely doesn't write in the first
person, but creates a character
named "Boon" to tell his story.
Boon? As in Daniel? Writing
about one's self in the third per
son is a tricky business; I can't
completely trust this Boon char
acter because I don't know what
his relationship is to the author.
The ambiguity that derives from
this lack of trust is annoying in
a travel essay, however accep
table in other types of writing. I
find myself asking, are these
really Morely's experiences? And
are we really getting Morely's re
action to Japan and the
Japanese, or the reaction that
he wished he had. or imagined
he had?
This criticism of the author's
chosen point of view is particu
larly pertinent in Morley's ac

count of his relationship with
the geisha, Mariko. Morley's at
titude toward Japanese women
in general is thoroughly macho;
though he describes his male
friends in some detail, his des
criptions of women seem to run
together. Granted, the women
one meets in the water trade
may bear a certain resemblance
to one another, but "Boon"
catalogs them curtly, as one
would postage stamps or rare
flowers. This kind of detective
novel chauvinism is, I imagine,
difficult to avoid in the circles
Morley frequents in Japan, but
it isn't mandatory.
Mariko stands out in the
water-trade-girl crowd, if only
because she becomes the topic
of about 70 pages of obsession.
Perhaps Morely's trying to give
us a closer look at the
"mysterious" Japanese women
he has so far glossed over; and if
he's being honest, much of his
time in Japan was spent brood
ing over Mariko. Still, I wish
he'd left the whole section out of
the book. The use of third per
son here seems to have been
either exploited as a device to
mask Morely's true feelings and
responses, or used as a kind of
therapy for the author — a cat
harsis — that isn't worth our
subjection. Morely is writing
this section of the book for him
self, not for us.
Actually, viewing the book in
its two writing modes —
Morely's writing for himself and
Morely's writing for his readers
— is a good way to distinguish
the parts of the book I liked from
those 1 disliked. When Morely
writes for his readers, and
describes what he's seeing,
doing and thinking in a way
that furthers our understanding
of Japan, he can be a powerful,
poetic writer. But when Morley
tries to further our understand
ing of Morley (Boon?), he's too
self-indulgent to maintain my
interest. After all, this is a book
about Japan, isn't it?

was where the strain of
Japanese society was born,
more or less everything finds a
reflection or an echo here."
In order to study the water
trade, Morely becomes com
pletely involved with its activi
ties. His narrative alternates be
tween philosophical rumina
tions on Japan and the
Japanese, and tales of good old
times had in Tokyo geisha bars.
In these accounts, he's refresh
ingly up-front about what he
and others are doing: There is
no moralizing here or any at
tempt to "objectify" his action.
This close perspective can be
wonderfully appealing; in fact,
Morely is weakest when he at
tempts to be distanced and ob
jective.
The biggest problem I have
with "Water Trade" is that
Morely doesn't write in the first
person, but creates a character
named "Boon" to tell his story.
Boon? As in Daniel? Writing
about one's self in the third per
son is a tricky business; I can't
completely trust this Boon char
acter because I don't know what
his relationship is to the author.
The ambiguity that derives from
this lack of trust is annoying in
a travel essay, however accep
table in other types of writing. I
find myself asking, are these
really Morely's experiences? And
are we really getting Morely's re
action to Japan and the
Japanese, or the reaction that
he wished he had. or imagined
he had?
This criticism of the author's
chosen point of view is particu
larly pertinent in Morley's ac

count of his relationship with
the geisha, Mariko. Morley's at
titude toward Japanese women
in general is thoroughly macho;
though he describes his male
friends in some detail, his des
criptions of women seem to run
together. Granted, the women
one meets in the water trade
may bear a certain resemblance
to one another, but "Boon"
catalogs them curtly, as one
would postage stamps or rare
flowers. This kind of detective
novel chauvinism is, I imagine,
difficult to avoid in the circles
Morley frequents in Japan, but
it isn't mandatory.
Mariko stands out in the
water-trade-girl crowd, if only
because she becomes the topic
of about 70 pages of obsession.
Perhaps Morely's trying to give
us a closer look at the
"mysterious" Japanese women
he has so far glossed over; and if
he's being honest, much of his
time in Japan was spent brood
ing over Mariko. Still, I wish
he'd left the whole section out of
the book. The use of third per
son here seems to have been
either exploited as a device to
mask Morely's true feelings and
responses, or used as a kind of
therapy for the author — a cat
harsis — that isn't worth our
subjection. Morely is writing
this section of the book for him
self, not for us.
Actually, viewing the book in
its two writing modes —
Morely's writing for himself and
Morely's writing for his readers
— is a good way to distinguish
the parts of the book I liked from
those 1 disliked. When Morely
writes for his readers, and
describes what he's seeing,
doing and thinking in a way
that furthers our understanding
of Japan, he can be a powerful,
poetic writer. But when Morley
tries to further our understand
ing of Morley (Boon?), he's too
self-indulgent to maintain my
interest. After all, this is a book
about Japan, isn't it?

" Pictures From The Water
Trade"
John David Morley
New York, Harper and Row,
1986.
There are two ways to write a
travel book. I know it's opening
a Pandora's box to call them
feminine and masculine ap
proaches, but I will anyway.
Writers can either adopt the
feminine approach and immerse
themselves entirely in a descrip
tion of place, or assert their
presence in that place and write
about how it affected them, or
they it.
John David Morley's "Pictures
From the Water Trade" fits into
the latter, masculine category.
His is not so much a book about
Japan as a book about a brood
ing, introspective man coming
to terms with himself and Asia.
Morley, an Oxford graduate,
goes to Japan on a Japanese cul
tural exchange scholarship.
With only minimal command of
the native language, he is sent
to Waseda University in Tokyo to
learn more Japanese and to
engage in "cross-cultural
studies", although he isn't really
sure what those studies are. For
months, Morely leads the in
sular existence of an uncon
nected foreigner, having
"isolated his own world without
really gaining access to the
other, remaining uneasily
suspended between the two."
Everything changes when he's
introduced to the "water trade"
through a random encounter in
a restaurant. The water trade, or
mizu-shobai, is one of the 40 or
so words Morley glossaries in
the back of the book; mizu
shobai is defined as "the vulgar
term for any precarious form of
trade yielding an income en
tirely dependent on the
patronage of its customers."
Simply put. bars and bordellos.
Through his experiences with
the water trade, Morley meets
the friends and lovers that
people his stories, and much of

the book is a progression from
cabaret to geisha bar.
Not that the entire book is one
bar brawl; Morely writes at
length about his attempts at cal
ligraphy, his home life and his
visits with Japanese families.
But he feels he can define some
thing essential about the
Japanese through a study of
Japanese night life. "The water
trade is a valve." he says. "This
was where the strain of
Japanese society was born,
more or less everything finds a
reflection or an echo here."
In order to study the water
trade, Morely becomes com
pletely involved with its activi
ties. His narrative alternates be
tween philosophical rumina
tions on Japan and the
Japanese, and tales of good old
times had in Tokyo geisha bars.
In these accounts, he's refresh
ingly up-front about what he
and others are doing: There is
no moralizing here or any at
tempt to "objectify" his action.
This close perspective can be
wonderfully appealing; in fact,
Morely is weakest when he at

jective.
