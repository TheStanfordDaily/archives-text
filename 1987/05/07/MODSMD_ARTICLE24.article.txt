# A 						'Star Trek' quiz for Sunday's Flick
## 
### ANDREW BERKOWITZ Staff writer 
In preparation for this Sunday's
Flick. "Star Trek IV." here is every
thing you ever needed to know
about the world of Star Trek:
What were some oj the other
ways they were considering to
bring Spock back to life in "Star
Trek III?"
□ Spock climbs out of Victoria
Principal's shower. "Trek II" was
all a dream sequence.
□ Spock wasn't really dead, but
instead was doing his impression
of a fan at a Grateful Dead concert.
□ All the rest of the cast die too.
Thus, they are reunited with
Spock in the afterlife. (Problem:
filming in the afterlife is
prohibitively expensive, and it's
hard to get fresh vegetables).

□ Instead of bringing him back
to life, they simply prop Spock's
dead body on the bridge. No one
notices.
□ Superman flies around the
Enterprise at the speed of light,
thus turning back time and en
abling the crew to save Spock.
(Problem: Superman mistakes
Bones for Lois Lane and tries to
get too personal. Bones tells Su
perman where he can insert a
Tricorder).
□ "Star Trek III: Enterprise of
the Living Dead." Spock returns
as the undead. Walks like a
zombie. Makes strange sounds.
Eats human and Romulan flesh.
Bonus!!: Dr. McCoy can occasion
ally say "Jim, he's undead."
□ Spock climbs out of Vanna
White's microwave. "Trek II" was
all a dream sequence.
□ Spock is rebuilt as the Six
Million Dollar Vulcan: "Steve

Spock, a Vulcan barely alive. We
can rebuild him. He will run
faster, jump higher, eat more
politely." (Problem: When trying to
run faster and jump higher,
Spock accidentally flies through
the hull of the Enterprise, causing
all the crew members to be sucked
out to their deaths in space).
□ Spock was struck down, but
returns even more powerful than
before as a shadowy apparition
along with Obi-Wan Kenobi, Yoda,
Darth Vader and Maclean Steven
son. Spock tells Nurse Chappel to
use the Force, and she in turn
tells Spock to beam himself into a
lake.
□ Spock climbs out of Nancy
Reagan's hair. "Trek II" was all a
dream sequence, as was the
Reagan administration.
If Captain Kirk were to die, how
would it happen?

Kirk would die of a horrible in
tergalactic social disease. As we
know, in each episode Kirk has a
short but meaningless relation
ship with an alien female (such as
Tammy Bakker), so Lord knows
what he may have caught. He
brings new meaning to the con
cept of exploring strange new
worlds, of seeking out new life and
new civilizations, of boldly going
where no man has gone before, of
jumping the first scaly, horned
female alien that. . .
What are the Jive stupidest "Star
Trek" names you could give a
child?
5. Spock.
4. Bones.
3. Sulu.
2. Uhura.
1. DeForrest.
We know about Red Alert and
Yellow Alert, but what are some
oj the other alerts on the Enter
prise?
Mauve Alert — Unknown alien
has a Tribble stuck in its throat.
All hands report to bridge. Feet
and torsos need not report to
bridge.

Chartreuse Alert — All
lavatories are occupied. Any offi
cers needing to go wee-wee will
have to go out a window.
Purple Alert — Short rock star
from Minneapolis preparing to
board ship.
Indigo Alert — No real alert, but
Kirk and Bones just dropped some
acid and want to watch that little
Indigo light flash on and off, on
and off, on and off . . .
Orange Alert - TV Evangelist
and wife approaching ship at close
to the speed of light. Prepare Vir
gin Torpedoes.
When Spock looks into that little
device on the bridge to "get read
ings," what is he really seeing?
The Playboy Channel.
What were the most frequently ut
tered lines on the show?
"He's dead, Jim." — Leonard
"Bones" McCoy.
"I'm responsible for the safety of
this entire crew." — James T.
Kirk.
"Jim, he's dead." — Lenny
"Bony" McCoy.
"I'm giving her all I've got, Cap

tain." — Mr. Scott.
"He's dead." — Leonard "Sleepy"
Floyd.
"That would be highly illogical"
— Mr. Spock.
"Jim, he's a stiff." — Leonard
"Touch me, I wanna feel your
body" McCoy.
"Gee, Captain Kirk. 1 sure ap
preciate you letting me come down
to this mysterious and potentially
dangerous planet even though I've
never been on the show before." —
Attributed to more than 90 crew
members.
"No, he's not sleeping, Jim." —
Leonard "the real" McCoy.
What's that thing sticking out oj
Uhura's ear?
A piece of raw broccoli. It
became lodged there during a par
ticularly rowdy bridge party, and
she hasn't been able to remove it
since. On the bright side, it
receives the sound from MTV in
stereo, so she can see her favorite
videos on Spock's little doodad on
the bridge. When she claims that
all circuits are jammed, actually
she's just trying to get Mark Good
man's hair into focus.
