## Great day for great rivalry: Card vs. Cal 
### CHRIS MYERS Editorial staff 
Perfect.
Perfect baseball weather —
sunny and hot enough to fry an
egg on home plate. The perfect col
lege rivalry — Stanford and Cali
fornia. The perfect situation —
Stanford poised to clinch the
league title with a few wins over
the resurgent Golden Bears. In
fact, this weekend's four-game se
ries between the Cardinal and Cal
ifornia is nothing short of a per
fect opportunity for college
baseball fans on both sides of the
Bay to Indulge themselves.
The series opens this afternoon
at Evans Diamond in Berkeley
with a 2:30 p.m. game, comes to
Stanford tomorrow at 2:30 p.m.,
hops back to Berkeley for a 1 p.m.
game Saturday and closes Sunday
at 1 p.m. at Sunken Diamond.
Going into this afternoon's se
ries opener, the Cardinal would
seem to have a lock on the Pacific
10 Southern Division crown.
Stanford has a three-game lead
over second-place UCLA in the
Six-Pac standings, and any com
bination of Cardinal wins and
Bruin losses totalling three will
clinch Stanford's fourth confer
ence title in the last five years.
The Cardinal, ranked sixth na
tionally by ESPN/Collegiate Base
ball and third by Baseball
America, has won Its last five
games at Evans Diamond. The
last time Stanford lost to the
Bears in Berkeley was April 6,
1985. Since 1982, Stanford is 25-
7 against Cal — 14-2 in Sunken
Diamond and 11-5 in Berkeley.
California, however, won't just
lie down and play Bear rug to the
league-leading Cardinal. The
Bears, In the midst of what Cal

Coach Bob Milano called a
"rebuilding year," struggled early
in the season, but have come on
strong In the last few weeks. Cal
has won four of its last six league
games, taking two of three from

both UCLA and Arizona State.
Stanford, meanwhile, is on a
hot streak of its own. The team
has rattled off a winning streak of
five games, all against non-league
opponents. In victories over Cal

State-Stanislaus. Santa Clara
(twice), Sacramento State and St.
Mary's, the Cardinal rang up a
total of 59 runs while allowing
only 18. The team should find the
going, both offensively and

defensively, a bit tougher against
the Bears.
"The key with them (Cal) is that
they're a very young team, and
they're getting better," Stanford
Coach Mark Marquess said.
Indeed, the Golden Bears are
such a young team that they
might more aptly be called the
Cubs. Mllano said that youth was
a big factor In the Bears' early
problems. "We began fairly
tentatively, especially against
league opponents," he said. "But
now they've started to believe in
themselves."
Mllano credited the Bears' Im
proved fortune to pitching, which
he said will also be a key to the
Stanford series. "We definitely
have to pitch well," he said.
The Bears' scheduled starter for
this afternoon's game is freshman
right-hander Travis Willis, who
sports an 8-4 record and 5.17
ERA. Tomorrow's scheduled
starter is junior righty Ted
Eldredge, 5-5 on the year with a
5.66 ERA.
The Cardinal will counter with
the aces of its staff, sending out
junior Lee Plemel today and Jack
McDowell, also a junior, tomor
row. Plemel is the team's hottest
hurler, with a 3-0 record and 2.19
ERA in his last five starts. He
struck out 25 and allowed a
measly nine earned runs in 37 In
nings of work. On the year, Plemel
is 7-4, with a 3.08 ERA. "If
Plemel's got good stuff, and has
good location, he is very difficult
to hit," Mllano said.
McDowell has an 7-4 season
record to go with a 4.58 ERA. He
recorded a win in both of the pre
vious Cal-Stanford meetings this
season.

The Cardinal offensive attaek
will be spearheaded by seniors
Ruben Amaro and Tol Cook, and
young sluggers Ed Sprague and
Paul Carey. Left fielder Amaro
leads the regulars with a .348 bat
ting average and a sterling .454 on
base percentage from the leadoff
spot. Cook, recently drafted by the
NFL, has continued his two-sport
stardom, posting a .328 average
with 50 runs batted in and nine
home runs. In his three previous
seasons with the Cardinal, Cook
has hit only four homers.
Cook's slugging is symptomatic
of a team-wide power surge that
has already accounted for 53
home runs and 387 RBls this
year, compared to season totals of
36 and 350 last year. Leading the
assault on the fences, along with
Cook, are sophomore third
baseman Sprague and freshman
right fielder Carey. Sprague, cur
rently riding a 14-game hitting
streak, has 13 home runs this
year, tying him with five others for
third place on the all-time Stan
ford single season list. He also has
58 RBIs, putting him just nine
short of fifth place on the Stanford
all-time single season list.
Carey has also put up some im
pressive numbers. Batting .344
on the year, the lefthanded
swinger has hit 10 homers and
driven in 40 runs. Another pleas
ant surprise for the Cardinal has
been the play of senior shortstop
David Esquer. A utility inflelder
for the past three years, Esquer
stepped into a star role this year
and is batting .310 with 29 RBIs
and 14 stolen bases.
All three games will be broad
cast on KZSU. Announcing the
contests will be the ever-popular
and witty duo of David Fisher and
Susan Slusser.

looking to put the tag on the Pacific 10 Conference Southern Division pennant Any combination of three
Stanford wins or UCLA losses will accomplish the task.
Perfect.
Perfect baseball weather —
sunny and hot enough to fry an
egg on home plate. The perfect col
lege rivalry — Stanford and Cali
fornia. The perfect situation —
Stanford poised to clinch the
league title with a few wins over
the resurgent Golden Bears. In
fact, this weekend's four-game se
ries between the Cardinal and Cal
ifornia is nothing short of a per
fect opportunity for college
baseball fans on both sides of the
Bay to Indulge themselves.
The series opens this afternoon
at Evans Diamond in Berkeley
with a 2:30 p.m. game, comes to
Stanford tomorrow at 2:30 p.m.,
hops back to Berkeley for a 1 p.m.
game Saturday and closes Sunday
at 1 p.m. at Sunken Diamond.
Going into this afternoon's se
ries opener, the Cardinal would
seem to have a lock on the Pacific
10 Southern Division crown.
Stanford has a three-game lead
over second-place UCLA in the
Six-Pac standings, and any com
bination of Cardinal wins and
Bruin losses totalling three will
clinch Stanford's fourth confer
ence title in the last five years.
The Cardinal, ranked sixth na
tionally by ESPN/Collegiate Base
ball and third by Baseball
America, has won Its last five
games at Evans Diamond. The
last time Stanford lost to the
Bears in Berkeley was April 6,
1985. Since 1982, Stanford is 25-
7 against Cal — 14-2 in Sunken
Diamond and 11-5 in Berkeley.
California, however, won't just
lie down and play Bear rug to the
league-leading Cardinal. The
Bears, In the midst of what Cal

Coach Bob Milano called a
"rebuilding year," struggled early
in the season, but have come on
strong In the last few weeks. Cal
has won four of its last six league
games, taking two of three from

both UCLA and Arizona State.
Stanford, meanwhile, is on a
hot streak of its own. The team
has rattled off a winning streak of
five games, all against non-league
opponents. In victories over Cal

State-Stanislaus. Santa Clara
(twice), Sacramento State and St.
Mary's, the Cardinal rang up a
total of 59 runs while allowing
only 18. The team should find the
going, both offensively and

defensively, a bit tougher against
the Bears.
"The key with them (Cal) is that
they're a very young team, and
they're getting better," Stanford
Coach Mark Marquess said.
Indeed, the Golden Bears are
such a young team that they
might more aptly be called the
Cubs. Mllano said that youth was
a big factor In the Bears' early
problems. "We began fairly
tentatively, especially against
league opponents," he said. "But
now they've started to believe in
themselves."
Mllano credited the Bears' Im
proved fortune to pitching, which
he said will also be a key to the
Stanford series. "We definitely
have to pitch well," he said.
The Bears' scheduled starter for
this afternoon's game is freshman
right-hander Travis Willis, who
sports an 8-4 record and 5.17
ERA. Tomorrow's scheduled
starter is junior righty Ted
Eldredge, 5-5 on the year with a
5.66 ERA.
The Cardinal will counter with
the aces of its staff, sending out
junior Lee Plemel today and Jack
McDowell, also a junior, tomor
row. Plemel is the team's hottest
hurler, with a 3-0 record and 2.19
ERA in his last five starts. He
struck out 25 and allowed a
measly nine earned runs in 37 In
nings of work. On the year, Plemel
is 7-4, with a 3.08 ERA. "If
Plemel's got good stuff, and has
good location, he is very difficult
to hit," Mllano said.
McDowell has an 7-4 season
record to go with a 4.58 ERA. He
recorded a win in both of the pre
vious Cal-Stanford meetings this
season.

The Cardinal offensive attaek
will be spearheaded by seniors
Ruben Amaro and Tol Cook, and
young sluggers Ed Sprague and
Paul Carey. Left fielder Amaro
leads the regulars with a .348 bat
ting average and a sterling .454 on
base percentage from the leadoff
spot. Cook, recently drafted by the
NFL, has continued his two-sport
stardom, posting a .328 average
with 50 runs batted in and nine
home runs. In his three previous
seasons with the Cardinal, Cook
has hit only four homers.
Cook's slugging is symptomatic
of a team-wide power surge that
has already accounted for 53
home runs and 387 RBls this
year, compared to season totals of
36 and 350 last year. Leading the
assault on the fences, along with
Cook, are sophomore third
baseman Sprague and freshman
right fielder Carey. Sprague, cur
rently riding a 14-game hitting
streak, has 13 home runs this
year, tying him with five others for
third place on the all-time Stan
ford single season list. He also has
58 RBIs, putting him just nine
short of fifth place on the Stanford
all-time single season list.
Carey has also put up some im
pressive numbers. Batting .344
on the year, the lefthanded
swinger has hit 10 homers and
driven in 40 runs. Another pleas
ant surprise for the Cardinal has
been the play of senior shortstop
David Esquer. A utility inflelder
for the past three years, Esquer
stepped into a star role this year
and is batting .310 with 29 RBIs
and 14 stolen bases.
All three games will be broad
cast on KZSU. Announcing the
contests will be the ever-popular
and witty duo of David Fisher and
Susan Slusser.
