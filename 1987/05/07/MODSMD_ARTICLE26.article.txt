# Will NCAA invite men's tennis to championships?
## 
### 
Last year, Georgia men's tennis coach Dan
Magill was asked if he thought Stanford Coach
Dick Gould could rebuild his team fast enough to
defend the national title in 1987.
"Gould doesn't rebuild," Magill responded, "he
reloads."
Well, with a 13-10 regular season record, Gould
may have come up a few bullets short of getting a
bid to the national championships, which begin
next weekend in Athens, Georgia.

Twenty teams go to the tourney, and the Card
inal is tied at No. 19 in the latest rankings. The
problem, however, is that eight teams will get au
tomatic regional bids — so unranked teams like
Columbia and Oklahoma State will receive berths
before Stanford.
Thus the Cardinal stands in a unique position
— Coach Gould's squad has only a slim chance of
getting into the tournament, but if the team does
get a bid it could be one of the favorites to win it
all.
Remember, since the championships moved to
Georgia in 1977, Stanford has won the NCAA title
six times and finished second once. Last year in
Athens, as a Cardinal team which had sputtered
throughout the regular season rolled to the
crown, opposing coaches spoke In admiring but
puzzled tones about how Gould always gets his
teams to peak in the Peach state.
Sure enough, Stanford started a season-ending
charge last month by defeating No. 2 Long Beach
State, putting a scare into No. 1 USC and defeat
ing No. 13 California.
So, will It be unfair if Stanford is excluded when
the bids come out on Monday?

"I think the top-20 teams should go," Long
Beach Coach Larry Easley said yesterday."It
shouldn't be based on last year's performance or
on automatic regional bids — that's silly."
Cal Coach Scott McCain agrees. "They (the
NCAA) should look to reduce the number of auto
matic regional bids from eight to four so that
more higher-ranked teams can go."
But in any case, should the defending national
champions get an automatic bid every year, as
some people argued when the NCAA didn't give
the Louisville basketball team a post-season berth
this year?
The answer is no. And UCLA Asst. Coach Roger
Knaptells said why yesterday:
"A lot of times the national champions have a lot
of seniors who are gone the next year. I really don't
think it would be fair to other teams. You should
have to earn It."
All right then, did Stanford play well enough
this year to earn a berth?
"It'll be tough for them (Stanford) to get In,"
Knapp said. "But based upon the name and since
they've been there so often, there's a chance they'll
get the benefit of the doubt."
"The structure is such that there really is no
benefit of the doubt," McCain countered. "I'd like
to see Stanford go. Definitely at this point in the
year they are playing better than some other
teams that are being considered."
Easley had this to say: "I would think Stanford
probably won't go on record — they lost to too
many weak teams. Because they're Stanford
though, they have a good shot — Georgia didn't
deserve to go last year but they did."
Knapp and Easley think the Cardinal name and
reputation might get Stanford in this year. But if
it's the name that gets Stanford in, isn't that un
fair also?
Ah, forget all this speculation. All that matters
is if the Cardinal team does go to Athens, don't be
surprised if Gould and his players have a couple
extra bullets up their sleeves.
