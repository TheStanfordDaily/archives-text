# Golf team finishes eighth at Pacific 10 tournament
## 
### EVAN TUCHINSKY Staff writer 
Patience is a virtue, and it ap
pears that the Stanford men's golf
team will be filled with saints,
since the squad will have to wait
until next year for another chance
to qualify for NCAA championsips.
The Cardinal concluded its season
yesterday at the Pacific 10 Confer
ence championships in Eugene,
Ore., with an eighth-place finish
at 1,529 strokes.
Arizona won the tournament by
a slim two point margin with its
1,463 finish. Arizona State, tied
for first with three holes to play,
saw Jim Strickland, its best gol
fer, bogie the 16th and 17th holes
to place himself and his team in
second. This gave the individual
victory to Wildcat Larry Silveira,
who shot 289 to Strickland's 290.
Stanford beat Oregon State, but
fell short in the race with Califor
nia as the Golden Bears prevailed
by 8 strokes. "Cal played poorly,"
Stanford Coach Tim Schaaf said
of the Bears' 391 Wednesday ef
fort. "They left the door open for
us, and we didn't take it."
Leading the Cardinal, as has
been par for the course this week,
was Roger Miraglia, who finished
the tournament at 299, just four
strokes back of the tenth place
finishers and 10 behind Silveira.
"Whenever you shoot under 300
at a tournament like this it's
pretty good," Schaaf said.
Brad Benbrook came in second
for Stanford with 305 strokes, fol
lowed by Brad Geer at 306. Steve
White's scorecard read 307, while
John Mahon had a 315 under his
name.
Despite the poor showing,
Schaaf said he is not ashamed of
his players. "Looking back on the
season, they worked hard and did
their best every game. They were
just thoroughly outclassed.
"We never beat Arizona. Arizona
State and UCLA," Schaaf said.
"We didn't beat Oregon or USC,
but we were close to these teams
at times.
"One of the biggest disappoint
ments is that this year was the
best year for the conference," the
coach continued. "This is the
strongest conference. Five out of

10 teams are going to nationals,
and in a field of 30. that's some
thing."
The Pac 10's national domin
ance should continue into next
year, and Schaaf hopes that Stan
ford will be at the forefront. "Next
year the conference remains as
strong," Schaaf noted. " Only two
players of any significance are

graduating. If anything, the con
ference will be as hard next year.
However, next year we will be more
experienced."
Now that the season is over,
1987 may be looked back on as a
building year for the Cardinal.
"That's accurate, but I hope we
don't have too many of them,"
Schaaf added.

what disappointing eighth.
