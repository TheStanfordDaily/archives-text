Well, maybe now some schools will reschedule.
Tuesday, the Stanford softball team — whose
schedule has been severely diminished by cancella
tions of schools literally afraid to play it — lost two
heartbreakers to St. Mary's. The games may have
been the season finale for the Cardinal.
"It's a killer." Stanford Coach Tami Brown said.
"We should have had the first game. We were win
ning 3-0 until the bottom of the seventh.
"They loaded the bases somehow and hit a triple,"
Brown added; the Gaels won the game 4-3.

The situation was the same in the first half of
game two. "It was 3-0 until the sixth, and then they
came back again," Brown said. "We came back with
another run, but then they came back with another
run." The end result was a 5-4 loss for the Card.
"They hit the ball well." Brown said of the Gaels.
"Our pitchers pitched behind them, and they really
smacked it.
"We played very good defense and hit the ball better
in the second game, but they Just outhit us," she
noted. "They hit our pitchers."
Brown is currently trying to reschedule a
doubleheader with San Jose City College. If SJCC
declines to meet the Cardinal. Stanford's season will
end at 20-6.
