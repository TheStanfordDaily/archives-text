# Alcohol policy under scrutiny
## 
### CLAY CALVERT Staff writer 
Stanford Police Capt. Marvin Moore
said earlier this week that people Serving
alcohol to those under the legal Califor
nia drinking age of 21 "should be sweat
ing."
They are.
One resident fellow in an all-freshman
dormitory moved last week to prohibit
spending house funds on the purchase
of alcohol; RF Bruce Rosenstock is now
reconsidering his action. He met with
Larkin residents and the dorm's resi
dent assistants last night to try to reach
a compromise on the issue.
Last weekend, police entered parties
at Loro, Sigma Chi and Beta Theta Pi,
asking bartenders to check IDs of par
tygoers being served alcohol.
In Donner, an all-freshman dorm, res-

idents canceled the dorm's street dance,
fearing that the party might be shut
down by police if alcohol is served to
minors.

police speculate was the apparently
alcohol-related drowning in Lagunita of
20-year-old junior David Dunshee two
weeks ago, call into question the Univer

who purchase alcohol for residence

Norm Robinson, acting dean of Stu
dent Affairs, said the University's alco-

hoi policy is "educational because it
places responsibility on the individual to
know what the law is and to be informed
about the issue of alcohol in general."
The policy is consistent with the Uni
versity's philosophy of allowing students
to be resposible for the consequences of
their actions and allows more freedom of
choice than at other universities, Robin
son added.
"Other places tend to regulate" the
consumption of alcohol. Robinson said,
noting that some universities set limits
on the amount of alcohol that can be
served at a party and prohibit students
from keeping alcohol in their rooms.
Apparently, many Stanford students
under the age of 21 have made the deci

many dorms and fraternities have
