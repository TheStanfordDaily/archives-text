# Alcohol policy under scrutiny
## 
### CLAY CALVERT Staff writer 
Stanford Police Capt. Marvin Moore
said earlier this week that people Serving
alcohol to those under the legal Califor
nia drinking age of 21 "should be sweat
ing."
They are.
One resident fellow in an all-freshman
dormitory moved last week to prohibit
spending house funds on the purchase
of alcohol; RF Bruce Rosenstock is now
reconsidering his action. He met with
Larkin residents and the dorm's resi
dent assistants last night to try to reach
a compromise on the issue.
Last weekend, police entered parties
at Loro, Sigma Chi and Beta Theta Pi,
asking bartenders to check IDs of par
tygoers being served alcohol.
In Donner, an all-freshman dorm, res-

idents canceled the dorm's street dance,
fearing that the party might be shut
down by police if alcohol is served to
minors.
These events, coupled with what
police speculate was the apparently
alcohol-related drowning in Lagunita of
20-year-old junior David Dunshee two
weeks ago, call into question the Univer
sity's alcohol policy — both its enforce
ment and the liability of RFs and RAs
who purchase alcohol for residence
related events.
The alcohol policy here is simple, com
bining state law with guidelines from
the Office of Residential Education. It
states that "California law prohibits the
consumption of alcohol by persons un
der 21 and makes it illegal to buy for or
supply alcohol to persons under 21."
Norm Robinson, acting dean of Stu
dent Affairs, said the University's alco-

hoi policy is "educational because it
places responsibility on the individual to
know what the law is and to be informed
about the issue of alcohol in general."
The policy is consistent with the Uni
versity's philosophy of allowing students
to be resposible for the consequences of
their actions and allows more freedom of
choice than at other universities, Robin
son added.
"Other places tend to regulate" the
consumption of alcohol. Robinson said,
noting that some universities set limits
on the amount of alcohol that can be
served at a party and prohibit students
from keeping alcohol in their rooms.
Apparently, many Stanford students
under the age of 21 have made the deci
sion to drink alcoholic beverages and
many dorms and fraternities have
likewise decided to serve those students.
Often, no ID or only a Stanford ID card
is required for students to drink at
campus parties here. Rarely do police
enter a party and require that
bartenders check for ID showing a stu
dent's age.
Robinson and Stanford police,
however, say enforcement of the alcohol
policy at last weekend's parties was
nothing new.
Moore said that police will take
whatever action necessary to restore or
der at a party if they are called in or if the
party is spilling out into the streets.
"We don't go out of our way to go into a
party." Moore said Monday. "There are

parties here all the time — we're not con
cerned with that. If we're called with a
problem, we'll assess the cause of the
problem, and if it's underage drinking,
we'll have to address it."
Also under question is the liability of
those purchasing alcohol for underage
drinkers, as many dorms and fraterni
ties serve alcohol to students under 21.
That issue initially prompted
Rosenstock to issue a letter to Larkin
residents stating that he "can no longer
oversee the welfare of the students in the
dormitory and at the same time su
pervise an illegal activity."
Rosenstock has since decided to
reconsider the action after finding what
he believes is legal precedent indicating
that RFs and RAs would not be held
legally responsible for the actions of in
toxicated. underage students.
But the issue of liability persists. In

formation distributed to RAs at the
beginning of the school year states that
"in the event of a lawsuit based on a
claim that injury or death resulted from
alcohol use in the residences, RFs and
RAs would be sued as individuals acting
as agents of the University.
"The RFs and RAs may be held ac
countable for parties and programs
which take place in the residence,
whether or not they were planned by the
residence staff."
Despite this warning to RAs and RFs,
Robinson said the University does not
specifically tell them not to purchase al
cohol for students and residence par
ties.
He said that residence staffs are en
couraged to determine their own
policies regarding the purchase of alco
hol for students during Orientation in
September.
