### HARU CONNOLLY Staff writer 
AIDS experts strongly disagreed last
night as to whether community educa
tion or quarantining AIDS patients is
the best way to arrest the spread of the
deadly virus.
The three-member panel discussion
here was headed by Mervyn Silverman,
president of the American Foundation
for AIDS Research. Nearly 100 people at
tended.
"What we have to do is educate people,
not quarantine nor isolate people with
AIDS,'' Silverman said. "Only an ed
ucated, honest response to the disease
will be the best thing to do."
But William O'Connor, associate pro
fessor of medicine at UC-Davis, did not
agree. Some AIDS patients are
"criminally irresponsible. We must is

olate them because you can't stop them
from spreading the disease." he said.
While the other two speakers did not
back O'Connor's position, he cited
several studies to support his conten
tion. including one which reported that
20 percent of blood donors who tested
positive for ARC (AIDS-related complex)
did not change their daily habits.
"The blood supply is not safe because
of that kind of behavior," said O'Connor.
Silverman said the blood supply is
safe and only "an Incredibly small
percentage" of donations slip through
tests for AIDS contamination. Silver
man disputed O'Connor's evidence,
saying it relied upon editorial opinion
rather than scientific fact.
The way to contain AIDS Is through
educating people in avoiding risk, Sil
verman said. "People will change and
respond to life and death Issues," he

said, citing the success of AIDS educa
tion started in 1982 in San Francisco
that lowered the frequency of high-risk
sex practices.
Matthew Coles, a civil rights attorney
and the third panel member, argued
that the government can't constitution
ally quarantine AIDS patients and has
no money to do so.
"We can't build a San Diego in the
middle of the desert and run such a
place," he said, adding that there are
more than 1 million AIDS patients in the
United States.
The panelists also disagreed as to
whether people should be tested for
AIDS, discussing possibilities from
selective mandatory testing to no testing
at all.
The forum was sponsored by the Fam
ily Medicine Group of the Medical
School.
