# Task force defends Area One report
## 
### STEVE STREED 
The Task Force on the Area One Require
ment defended its recommendations to
revamp the Western Culture program in a
forum last night.
"(The reform of the Western Culture re
quirement) can be done, and its got to be
done soon if its to be done at all, and Stan
ford is not in the vanguard of this, either,"
said Barry Katz, a member of the task force
and a lecturer in VTSS. Katz cited univer
sities such as UC-Berkeley and Harvard
that have already considered diversifying
their Western culture programs.
Questions from the audience of 20
people focused on the proposed loss of a
core reading list and the requirement to
study a non-European culture. Members of
the audience argued that such legislation
would hinder freshmen from having a uni
fying academic experience.
Members of the task force said students
can learn a common set of ideas without a
core reading list.
"Defining a common intellectual experi
ence by a set of books causes many more
problems than it solves." said History Prof.
Paul Seaver, head of the task force.
He said, however, that the reforms do
not expressly prevent the continuation of a
core reading list. In any Area One se
quence, "it ought to be possible to use a
core list," he said.
"We value a common intellectual experi
ence, but we have broadened the way that
is defined. We think a student can have a
common intellectual experience even when
not reading the same book, or even the
same author," Katz said.
The proposal would not dismantle the
current Western Culture tracks, Seaver
said. The draft calls for a maximum of 10
tracks and presupposes the opportunity

for all of the existing tracks to continue, he
Indicated.
The task force draft calls for the study of
"at least one culture outside the European
family of cultures."
"To say Western culture means Western
Europe Is Insupportable. A lot of commun
ities outside non-Western Europe should
be included in a study of Western culture
because they have contributed to Western
culture," Seaver said.
Egyptians contributed to ancient Greek
culture and Muslims provided the
groundwork for numeric studies in
Europe in the Middle Ages, argued Bill
King, one of two student members on the
task force.
The task force hopes that members of
the senior faculty will support the proposal
after having viewed the draft and the task
force's explanations over a longer length of
time, Katz said. Post-doctoral students on
the Western Culture teaching staff have
supported the proposed changes, he said.
"Despite the fact that most of the opposi
tion comes from members of the English
department, their proposal for a track next
year has changed the most," Seaver said.
"It is supposed to encourage proposals
from faculty members. Most departments
will want to offer a track because it will be a
pipeline to get majors," he said.
Seaver said that the traditional model
for Western Culture course is outmoded
and unjustified. "We have a peculiar vision
of the West, which is largely a product of
19th-century Germany. We are trying to
break up a very peculiar construct of West
ern Europe."
"We're trying to start from a different
place so people are aware that there Is di
versity," he added.
Katz cited a recent change In one Area
One track as an example of how the West
ern Culture program can benefit from di
versity. The track has shifted Its emphasis
on the study of creation in Genesis, to the
creation myths of the Egyptians. Africans,
native Americans and Hebrews,
"The difference that the change makes
from there on is great. I think you get an
Idea of what can happen in terms of expec
tations/'
The task force is prepared to draft a final
proposal on the Area One requirement,
which It will present to the Committee on
Undergraduate Studies (CUS). The legisla
tion needs the approval of the CUS and the
Faculty Senate to take effect.
The task force's original draft proposal
stated: "Courses that study the traditions
and values of diverse cultures . . . enable
students to appreciate and understand the
United States as a multicultural society."
