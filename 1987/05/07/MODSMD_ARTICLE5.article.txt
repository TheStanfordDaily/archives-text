# Fraternities react to crackdown on drinking

A fraternity that was told by police to card
those attending its bid-acceptance party
Friday is unlikely to have any more open
parties this year, its president said yester
day.
Meanwhile, members of other fraternities
speculated that open fraternity parties
would disappear if stringent enforcement of
the drinking age continues.
"There is a good chance we will probably
not have any more open parties this year,"
said Tom Walsh, president of Beta Theta Pi.
"We might do some private, in-house
things, but with no posters, no open
doors."
Walsh said there were other factors in
volved in the decision, such as the cost and
effort associated with the recently com
pleted Rush process. But he said the inci
dent Friday, when police entered the Beta
house and told bartenders to check driver's
licenses to ensure people were of legal
drinking age, was the final motivation
toward closing future Beta parties.
The Betas have traditionally had an open
"bar night" every Thursday. Walsh said that
practice would be discontinued.
Theta Delta Chi president Robin Vasan
said open parties may become too much of a
liabilty for fraternities, especially for the
presidents, who as house officers could be
held personally liable for any incidents
stemming from parties.
"I can see (closed parties) happening

within the next year." Vasan said. "By and
large, I don't think the social life here would
be half — more than that — of what it is. I
think the social life at Stanford revolves
around the fraternities. Where else at Stan
ford can you party in such masses at our ex
pense?"
Vasan said the Theta Delts would not be
closing any parties because the only event
the fraternity has remaining before its
spring formal is an outdoor luau party. It
would be difficult to limit the luau to Invited
guests because of its location outside the
Theta Delt house, he said.
Interfraternity Council President Steve
Singleton said he hasn't heard any talk of
open parties being in danger, but added
that there hasn't been an IFC meeting since
last weekend, when police entered three
open parties on campus and asked that the
sponsors check IDs.
Singleton said of closed parties, "I think
across the country that's the policy of most
fraternities and sororities. It would prob
ably be the best course to take. It would pro
vide more control of parties and alcohol
consumption — problems and risks for all
fraternities. I think that's the direction
we're headed; how soon we get there, I don't
know."
The issue will be addressed at the next
IFC meeting a week from today, Singleton
said.
Stanford Police Capt. Marvin Moore said
the police entered parties at the Beta and
