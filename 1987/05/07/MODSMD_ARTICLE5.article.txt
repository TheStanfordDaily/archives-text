# Fraternities react to crackdown on drinking
## 
### JOHN LIS Editorial staff 
A fraternity that was told by police to card
those attending its bid-acceptance party
Friday is unlikely to have any more open
parties this year, its president said yester
day.
Meanwhile, members of other fraternities
speculated that open fraternity parties
would disappear if stringent enforcement of
the drinking age continues.
"There is a good chance we will probably
not have any more open parties this year,"
said Tom Walsh, president of Beta Theta Pi.
"We might do some private, in-house
things, but with no posters, no open
doors."
Walsh said there were other factors in
volved in the decision, such as the cost and
effort associated with the recently com
pleted Rush process. But he said the inci
dent Friday, when police entered the Beta
house and told bartenders to check driver's
licenses to ensure people were of legal
drinking age, was the final motivation
toward closing future Beta parties.
The Betas have traditionally had an open
"bar night" every Thursday. Walsh said that
practice would be discontinued.
Theta Delta Chi president Robin Vasan
said open parties may become too much of a
liabilty for fraternities, especially for the
presidents, who as house officers could be
held personally liable for any incidents
stemming from parties.
"I can see (closed parties) happening

within the next year." Vasan said. "By and
large, I don't think the social life here would
be half — more than that — of what it is. I
think the social life at Stanford revolves
around the fraternities. Where else at Stan
ford can you party in such masses at our ex
pense?"
Vasan said the Theta Delts would not be
closing any parties because the only event
the fraternity has remaining before its
spring formal is an outdoor luau party. It
would be difficult to limit the luau to Invited
guests because of its location outside the
Theta Delt house, he said.
Interfraternity Council President Steve
Singleton said he hasn't heard any talk of
open parties being in danger, but added
that there hasn't been an IFC meeting since
last weekend, when police entered three
open parties on campus and asked that the
sponsors check IDs.
Singleton said of closed parties, "I think
across the country that's the policy of most
fraternities and sororities. It would prob
ably be the best course to take. It would pro
vide more control of parties and alcohol
consumption — problems and risks for all
fraternities. I think that's the direction
we're headed; how soon we get there, I don't
know."
The issue will be addressed at the next
IFC meeting a week from today, Singleton
said.
Stanford Police Capt. Marvin Moore said
the police entered parties at the Beta and
Sigma Chi houses and instructed
bartenders to begin carding be
cause underage minors were
drinking and obstructing traffic
as they walked between the two
houses. Police did the same at a
party at the Loro dormitory in
Florence Moore Hall on Saturday
because students were dancing on
the roof.
Moore said that police would not
enter a party for the sole purpose
of citing underage drinkers, but
hinted that it remained a pos
sibity and might occur in the fu
ture. He said that currently police
only enter parties when they are
called concerning a disturbance or
can spot a problem on sight.
Police denied that the drowning
death of David Dunshee, a 20-
year-old Zeta Psi member, in
Lagunita two weeks ago prompted
last weekend's incidents, but
some students remain skeptical.

"It's been a long time since three
Stanford parties were entered in
one weekend," Walsh said. "If it's
related to the Dunshee incident, I
wish the police would say it. We'd
like to know what's going on."
Vasan, however, said there was
an open toga party at the Theta
Delt house the next night that
went without incident until it
ended at 2 a.m. He said police
spoke to him about an occurrence
that evening not concerning the
Theta Delts, but did not interfere
with the party.
There was also speculation that
the police actions last weekend
were a result of a change in Uni
versity policy, which was denied
by Moore and Norm Robinson,
acting dean of student affairs.
Diana Conklin, assistant dean
of Residential Education, has said
that there will be no change in
University alcohol policy until the
University's internal investigation
into the Dunshee case has been
completed.
According to Fraternal Affairs

Adviser Joe Pisano, "It's my obser
vation that some groups are cut
ting down on the number of open
parties they have." He added that
fraternities might consider
invitation-only parties or mixers
between a fraternity and a
sorority.
Stanford fraternities were un
der heavy attack two years ago for
being elitist groups, and there is
some fear closed parties solely
among Greek organizations may
bring back pressure to eliminate
fraternity housing.
"There are ways around that,"
Pisano said. "People could invite
other groups on campus, other
residences, as part of their social
program. The stigma of being
elitist can be overcome."
"That's always a potential prob
lem," Walsh said, "but I don't
think anything inherent in the
fraternal system here results in
elitism. One thing about the
fraternal system at Stanford is it's
diverse — there are a lot of differ
ent kinds of houses here."
