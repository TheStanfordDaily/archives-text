# Low-tar just as dangerous, Med Center study shows
## 
### KLAUS KJAER-PEDERSEN Editorial staff 
Smokers who use cigarettes low
in tar and nicotine are just as
likely to suffer from heart disease
as those who smoke regular
cigarettes, according to a new
study by researchers at the Stan
ford Medical Center.
The study, conducted by Dr.
David Maron, director of the
Preventive Medicine Clinic of
Stanford, and Dr. Stephen
Fortmann. associate director of
the Stanford Center for Research
in Disease Prevention, will be pub
lished in the June issue of the
American Journal of Public
Health.

The study shows that smokers
who normally smoke regular
cigarettes tend to engage in
"compensatory behavior" when
they smoke low-yield cigarettes —
most slgnficantly. they tend to
smoke more cigarettes per day. In
addition, these low-yield cigarette
smokers tend to inhale more
deeply, smoke to a shorter butt
length and block the ventilation
holes on the filter designed to
dilute the inhaled smoke with air.
"People smoke cigarettes differ
ently than machines," said the
study, observing that the machine
tests used by the Federal Trade
Commission to rate the health
risks of different cigarette brands
are misleading.

According to Fortmann, the
greatest achievement of the study
has been to confirm the results of
smaller-scale studies which had
suggested that smokers of low
yield cigarettes get the same kind
of exposure to harmful chemicals.
But while the study indicates
that low-yield cigarettes do not
lower the smoker's risk of coro
nary heart disease — which ac
cording to Maron is the "number
one cause of death in the United
States"— low-yield cigarettes do
seem to lower the risk of cancers,
especially lung, throat and mouth
cancers. Maron emphasized,
however, that the risk of cancer is
still "much higher" than for non
smokers.

The study kept track of close to
1,000 regular smokers in five Cali
fornia cities: Modesto, Monterey.
Salinas, San Luis Obispo and
Santa Maria.
The smokers studied first gave
up their high-yield brands in favor
of low-yield brands, and the study
then monitored the levels of car
bon monoxide and thiocyanate In
their blood. The carbon monox
ide. along with cyanide gas.
passes directly from the inhaled
smoke into the blood stream,
while thiocyanate forms in the
blood as the cyanide decomposes.
Based on the levels of carbon
monoxide and thiocyanate in the
blood, it could not be determined
whether people smoked low-yield

or high-yield brands, according to
the study.
"My personal feeling is that
smoking should be banned."
Maron said, looking toward a
smoke-free environment by the
year 2000.
Maron considers it "highly
unlikely," however, that Congress
will pass laws prohibiting the use
of high-yield cigarette brands as a
first move to phase out smoking
completely.
According to Maron, the three
major harmful components of cig
arette smoke are nicotine, carbon
monoxide and tar. Nicotine and
carbon monoxide seem to be con
nected to a condition called ath
erosclerosis — the buildup of

cholesterol deposits on the inside
of arteries — which in turn results
in heart disease.
"Tar," according to Maron. is "a
vague term for particulate matter,
consisting of lots of different
chemicals." Tar contains the
various carcinogens of cigarette
smoke, but does not have any
known Influence on the risk of
heart disease. Maron said.
The study on cigarettes is only
one study to come out of the Five-
City Project, a 14-year inves
tigative project on cardiovascular
disease conducted by researchers
at the Medical Center.
The project began in 1978, and
Fortmann took over as project di
rector in 1979.
