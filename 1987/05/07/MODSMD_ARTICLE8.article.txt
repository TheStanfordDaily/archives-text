North told Reagan of diversion
WASHINGTON — Former White House aide Oliver North said
that he informed President Reagan several times that profits from
U.S. arms sales to Iran were being funneled to the Nicaraguan
contra rebels during 1985 and 1986, retired Maj. Gen. Richard
Secord testified yesterday.
In his second day of testimony before Senate and House com
mittees investigating the Iran-contrascandal, Secord also dis
closed that the diversion of Iran arms sales profits to the contras
had earlier roots than previously disclosed. As early as November
1985, he said, the contras received *800,000 from an Israeli
weapons shipment to Iran.
But the 28-year Air Force veteran, who was recruited by North to
operate the Iran arms sales and to supply weapons to the contras,
insisted that the diversion of funds violated no law. He argued
that profits from the Iran arms sales were not the property of the
U.S. government even though they came from the sale of Ameri
can weapons taken from U.S. stocks with the approval of the pres
ident.
Congress had banned U.S. military aid to the contras for much
of 1985 and 1986, and Reagan has repeatedly denied knowing
that Iran arms profits were used to buy military hardware for the
rebels. White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater, calling Secord's
testimony "hearsay," reiterated yesterday:"The president has said
he was not aware, and he was not aware."
Secord admitted that he had never talked personally to Reagan,
even though he demanded an oportunity to do so last November
when the diversion of funds was about to be made public by Attor
ney General Edwin Meese 111. Secord also disclosed that he also
was present in a hotel room on Nov. 25 when North, who had just
been fired by the White House, received farewell telephone calls
from Reagan and Vice President George Bush.
Hart stands by account
HANOVER, N.H. — Submitting to a tense, awkward 45-minutes
of questioning. Democratic presidential candidate Gary Hart yes
terday stood by his account that he did not have a sexual relation
ship with a 29-year old Miami model but also said that he consid
ered broader inquiries about adultery to be off-limits.
Struggling to save his candidacy from being destroyed over
reports of his relationship with Donna Rice, Hart said he had so
cialized with her in broad daylight last weekend and had accom
panied her and two others as they went sightseeing Saturday af
ternoon in Alexandria and picnicking along the Potomac.
Hart acknowledged repeatedly, as he did Tuesday, that he had
made a "serious mistake" in political judgement in socializing
with the model at a time he was battling rumors of womanizing,
but insisted reports in the Miami Herald on Sunday that he has
spent the night with Rice were wrong. Hart's wife, Lee, said in a
news conference before joining him on the campaign trail here
that she believes his version, and added of his association with
the model. "If it doesn't bother me. I don't think it ought to bother
anyone else."
The differences between Hart's account of his weekend move
ments and the one published in the Herald sharpened Wednesday
when he said that on at least four different occasions last Satur
day afternoon and evening, he, Rice, and two friends — or some
combination thereof — entered and left the front door of his
Capitol Hill townhouse.
These movements occurred during a time when the paper
claims it was maintaining a five-person stakeout of the home, and
made no sightings of anyone coming or going. The Herald
reporters concluded Hart and Rice spent Friday night and all day
Saturday together in Hart's house, a conclusion Hart said is to
tally in error.
Contra supplier pleads guilty
WASHINGTON — Richard Miller, head of a Washington public
relations firm that promoted the cause of the Nicaraguan contras,
pleaded guilty in federal court yesterday to conspiring to supply
military equipment to the rebels financed by tax-deductible con
tributions.
Miller. 34. who last week "categorically" denied his involvement,
admitted complicity in a scheme with fired National Security
Council aide Lt. Col. Oliver North and conservative fund-raiser
Carl (Spitz) Channell to defraud the government by raising the
money to arm the contras under the cover of a tax-exempt founda
tion.
U.S. District Court Judge Stanley Harris postponed sentencing
indefinitely, pending his cooperation with independent counsel
Lawrence Walsh. Miller faces a maximum sentence of five years in
prison and a *250,000 fine. The charges filed by Walsh's office
listed ®3.12 million in illegal contributions during 1985 and
1986.
Prosecutors from Walsh's office declined to comment on the
likelihood of charges against North, but said their investigation
was "accelerating and expanding." They said five people, three
employees of Channell and two associates of Miller, also have for
mally agreed to cooperate.
Casey dies of pneumonia
WASHINGTON — William Casey, World War II spymaster and
self-made millionaire tax lawyer who served as director of the
Central Intelligence Agency at the height of the Iran-contraaffair.
died yesterday of pneumonia. He was 74.
Casey died in a Long Island. N.Y., hospital hours after retired
Air Force Maj. Gen. Richard Secord told Congress that he had met
three times with Casey in 1985 and 1986 to get help for his private
airlift for the Nicaraguan contra rebels during a time when gov
ernment aid was illegal.
Sen. Patrick Leahy. D-Vt., former vice chairman of the Senate
Intelligence Committee, said that Casey's death meant that his
role in the Iran-contra affair might never be fully known. Casey.
Leahy said, "probably knew the most of anybody — with the possi
ble exception of Oliver North — and of course that we'll never
know, because he didn't really tell us much about it."
Sen. Daniel Inouye. D-Hawali, chairman of the Senate select
committee investigating the Iran affair, said that regardless of the
final determination of Casey's role in the scandal, "it should not
obscure Mr. Casey's distinguished record of commitment to this
country. . . . Mr. Casey served his nation with dedication, pur
pose and energy."
Landslide victory for Botlia
JOHANNESBURG. S. Africa — The ruling National Party of
President Pleter Botha headed toward a landslide victory in South
Africa's whites-only election for Parliament early today, crushing
the liberal opposition Progressive Federal Party in many key races
and holding the far-right Conservative Party at bay.
Results early this morning were incomplete, but trends in key
districts in the vote-heavy Transvaal Province and in urban areas
elsewhere in the country Indicated that the Nationalists, who have
held power since 1948, would retain their 127-seat majority In the
178-seat white chamber of Parliament.
They were seen possibly gaining some seats at the expense of
both the Progressives and the Conservatives.
More than 1 million blacks stayed away from work nationwide
in the biggest anti-apartheid demonstration since a state of emer
gency was declared 11 months ago. according to the independent
Labor Monitoring Group.

self-made millionaire tax lawyer who served as director of the
Central Intelligence Agency at the height of the Iran-contraaffair.
died yesterday of pneumonia. He was 74.
Casey died in a Long Island. N.Y., hospital hours after retired
Air Force Maj. Gen. Richard Secord told Congress that he had met
three times with Casey in 1985 and 1986 to get help for his private
airlift for the Nicaraguan contra rebels during a time when gov
ernment aid was illegal.
Sen. Patrick Leahy. D-Vt., former vice chairman of the Senate
Intelligence Committee, said that Casey's death meant that his
role in the Iran-contra affair might never be fully known. Casey.
Leahy said, "probably knew the most of anybody — with the possi
ble exception of Oliver North — and of course that we'll never
know, because he didn't really tell us much about it."
Sen. Daniel Inouye. D-Hawali, chairman of the Senate select
committee investigating the Iran affair, said that regardless of the
final determination of Casey's role in the scandal, "it should not
obscure Mr. Casey's distinguished record of commitment to this
country. . . . Mr. Casey served his nation with dedication, pur
pose and energy."
Landslide victory for Botlia
JOHANNESBURG. S. Africa — The ruling National Party of
President Pleter Botha headed toward a landslide victory in South
Africa's whites-only election for Parliament early today, crushing
the liberal opposition Progressive Federal Party in many key races
and holding the far-right Conservative Party at bay.
Results early this morning were incomplete, but trends in key
districts in the vote-heavy Transvaal Province and in urban areas
elsewhere in the country Indicated that the Nationalists, who have
held power since 1948, would retain their 127-seat majority In the
178-seat white chamber of Parliament.
They were seen possibly gaining some seats at the expense of
both the Progressives and the Conservatives.
More than 1 million blacks stayed away from work nationwide
in the biggest anti-apartheid demonstration since a state of emer
gency was declared 11 months ago. according to the independent
Labor Monitoring Group.

North told Reagan of diversion
WASHINGTON — Former White House aide Oliver North said
that he informed President Reagan several times that profits from
U.S. arms sales to Iran were being funneled to the Nicaraguan
contra rebels during 1985 and 1986, retired Maj. Gen. Richard
Secord testified yesterday.
In his second day of testimony before Senate and House com
mittees investigating the Iran-contrascandal, Secord also dis
closed that the diversion of Iran arms sales profits to the contras
had earlier roots than previously disclosed. As early as November
1985, he said, the contras received *800,000 from an Israeli
weapons shipment to Iran.
But the 28-year Air Force veteran, who was recruited by North to
operate the Iran arms sales and to supply weapons to the contras,
insisted that the diversion of funds violated no law. He argued
that profits from the Iran arms sales were not the property of the
U.S. government even though they came from the sale of Ameri
can weapons taken from U.S. stocks with the approval of the pres
ident.
Congress had banned U.S. military aid to the contras for much
of 1985 and 1986, and Reagan has repeatedly denied knowing
that Iran arms profits were used to buy military hardware for the
rebels. White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater, calling Secord's
testimony "hearsay," reiterated yesterday:"The president has said
he was not aware, and he was not aware."
Secord admitted that he had never talked personally to Reagan,
even though he demanded an oportunity to do so last November
when the diversion of funds was about to be made public by Attor
ney General Edwin Meese 111. Secord also disclosed that he also
was present in a hotel room on Nov. 25 when North, who had just
been fired by the White House, received farewell telephone calls
from Reagan and Vice President George Bush.
Hart stands by account
HANOVER, N.H. — Submitting to a tense, awkward 45-minutes
of questioning. Democratic presidential candidate Gary Hart yes
terday stood by his account that he did not have a sexual relation
ship with a 29-year old Miami model but also said that he consid
ered broader inquiries about adultery to be off-limits.
Struggling to save his candidacy from being destroyed over
reports of his relationship with Donna Rice, Hart said he had so
cialized with her in broad daylight last weekend and had accom
panied her and two others as they went sightseeing Saturday af
ternoon in Alexandria and picnicking along the Potomac.
Hart acknowledged repeatedly, as he did Tuesday, that he had
made a "serious mistake" in political judgement in socializing
with the model at a time he was battling rumors of womanizing,
but insisted reports in the Miami Herald on Sunday that he has
spent the night with Rice were wrong. Hart's wife, Lee, said in a
news conference before joining him on the campaign trail here
that she believes his version, and added of his association with
the model. "If it doesn't bother me. I don't think it ought to bother
anyone else."
The differences between Hart's account of his weekend move
ments and the one published in the Herald sharpened Wednesday
when he said that on at least four different occasions last Satur
day afternoon and evening, he, Rice, and two friends — or some
combination thereof — entered and left the front door of his
Capitol Hill townhouse.
These movements occurred during a time when the paper
claims it was maintaining a five-person stakeout of the home, and
made no sightings of anyone coming or going. The Herald
reporters concluded Hart and Rice spent Friday night and all day
Saturday together in Hart's house, a conclusion Hart said is to
tally in error.
Contra supplier pleads guilty
WASHINGTON — Richard Miller, head of a Washington public
relations firm that promoted the cause of the Nicaraguan contras,
pleaded guilty in federal court yesterday to conspiring to supply
military equipment to the rebels financed by tax-deductible con
