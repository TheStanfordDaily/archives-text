# Donner votes against having street party
## 
### LESTER BASKIN Staff writer 
Donner House residents voted unani
mously last night to cancel plans for the
Donner Street Dance for the second year in
a row.
Calling the party too risky, residents cited
the death of junior David Dunshee. in
which police said alcohol may have been in
volved, and the recent increase in police
regulation of parties where alcohol is
served.
Donner Resident Assistant Matt Finger
hut voiced his and other RA's concerns that
the party would be shut down early, defeat
ing their organizational efforts.
"In light of the police actions over the
weekend, and despite what the police say
that they are doing, we know what they are
doing . . . it's clear that the attitude at
Stanford is changing," he said.
"If we serve (alcohol) to people who are
under 21, we're going to be breaking the
law. . . . We're an all-freshman dorm having
a party with a lot of kegs, and we'll just be a
perfect target for (police) to come down
hard," he added.
Student reaction to the decision was
mixed. Most said that there was no other
choice; the risk of spending much money
and time only to have the party shut down

by police was not worth the possible
rewards of again holding one of Stanford's
most popular parties, they said.
"I think that it's sort of a shame, but in
light of all the events that have happened. I
guess there's not really much else we could
do," said Mark Davies. dorm treasurer.
"The way the University's policies are
heading right now. it would be pretty bla
tant for us to try to hold the party. The Uni
versity probably wouldn't look favorably on
an all-freshman dorm serving alcohol," he
added.
Many said the recent police crackdown is
unprecedented. One freshman speaking
anonymously said, "It's kind of a shame
that the police are all of a sudden deciding
to crack down â€” I mean, they say it's not a
reaction to the death in Lake Lag. but it ob
viously is. I haven't heard of any police en
forcement or carding at parties."
"While it may be the right thing to do, it's
just not something that's been held in pre
cedent lately," he added.
The small group of Donner residents or
ganizing the party stressed that canceling
the party was the best alternative, despite
that a great deal of planning had already
taken place.
Linda Paulson, resident fellow at Donner,
said the students "made a wise decision."
