"'RATBOY' SWIMS AGAINST MAINSTREAM.
Sondra Locke's 'Ratboy' is a fairy tale with a cutting edge.. .a fable about beauty
and ugliness, success, love and exploitation. Locke tells this charming story
swiftly, with a delicate, breezy touch. Making her directorial debut—she gets
something really unusual: Grimm Brothers-style, mixing wonder with rough
edges, undertones of pain beneath the fantasy.
The movie, was a critical sensation
about 'Ratboy.' Its moral is natural and
affecting; it resonates with that old
storybook chime:' Once upon a time..
—LOS ANGELES TIMES, Michael Wilmington
