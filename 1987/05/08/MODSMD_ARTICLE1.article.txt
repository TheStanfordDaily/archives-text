Drug testing isn't just for NCAA
athletes anymore. At least not this
quarter.
Political Science Lecturer Jim
Steyer Wednesday told students in
his civil rights course that they
must sign a waiver consenting to
drug testing In order to play In
today's class softball tournament.
Fifty students will be randomly
selected from the approximately
300 class members and tested
Monday for drugs banned by the
National Collegiate Athletic Asso
ciation. which instituted a drug
testing program this academic
year for Its student/athletes,
Steyer said.
"This is an educational experi
ment," Steyer told the startled
class. "Drug testing is a national
issue, one we're going to look at
when we get to right of privacy,
and it's an issue that's relevant to
Stanford. ... I want us to go
through this before we discuss the
issue in class."
But one reliable source who
refused to be named said that no
drug testing will actually take
place â€” students will be walked
through the testing area but will
not have to produce a urine
sample.
The protocol for the drug testing
is deliberately modeled after the
NCAA program. Under NCAA
rules, student/athletes who fail to
sign the drug consent forms will
become ineligible for all intercol
legiate competition that year.
They may also lose their athletic
scholarships, although that Is
decided on a case-by-case^basis.
In Steyer's program, students
who refuse to sign will not be
allowed to compete in the class
softball tournament. Steyer's con
sent forms echo the language of
the NCAA consent forms, conclud
