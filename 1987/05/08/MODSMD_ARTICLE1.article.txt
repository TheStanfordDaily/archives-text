# Class to test for drug use
## 
### MARY YUH Senior staff writer 
Drug testing isn't just for NCAA
athletes anymore. At least not this
quarter.
Political Science Lecturer Jim
Steyer Wednesday told students in
his civil rights course that they
must sign a waiver consenting to
drug testing In order to play In
today's class softball tournament.
Fifty students will be randomly
selected from the approximately
300 class members and tested
Monday for drugs banned by the
National Collegiate Athletic Asso
ciation. which instituted a drug
testing program this academic
year for Its student/athletes,
Steyer said.
"This is an educational experi
ment," Steyer told the startled
class. "Drug testing is a national
issue, one we're going to look at
when we get to right of privacy,
and it's an issue that's relevant to
Stanford. ... I want us to go
through this before we discuss the
issue in class."
But one reliable source who
refused to be named said that no
drug testing will actually take
place — students will be walked
through the testing area but will
not have to produce a urine
sample.
The protocol for the drug testing
is deliberately modeled after the
NCAA program. Under NCAA
rules, student/athletes who fail to
sign the drug consent forms will
become ineligible for all intercol
legiate competition that year.
They may also lose their athletic
scholarships, although that Is
decided on a case-by-case^basis.
In Steyer's program, students
who refuse to sign will not be
allowed to compete in the class
softball tournament. Steyer's con
sent forms echo the language of
the NCAA consent forms, conclud
ing:
"I further understand that this
consent and my test results will
become a part of my educational
records subject to disclosure only
In accordance with my written
Buckley Amendment consent and
the Family Education Rights and
Privacy Act of 1974."
Steyer assured the students,
however, thai the results of the
tests would not become a part of
their educational records. For stu
dent/athletes. result s of drug tests
do become part of their records.
"All of this is strictly confiden
tial. If you test positive, no one will
know except yourself, me and
(Athletic Director) Andy Geiger.
This will not become part of your
educational file." he said.
NCAA athletes who test positive
become ineligible for postseason
competition. Students in Steyer's
class who test positive must per
form 15 hours of community ser
vice in East Palo Alto.
The Stanford Athletic Depart
ment will administer the drug
testing, just as it does for Stan
ford's student/athletes.
Geiger and Stan Scott, head
athletic trainer, explained the
NCAA program and the logistics of
drug testing.
The 50 randomly selected stu
dents will each be accompanied at
Encina Gym by a monitor of the
same sex, who will observe the
production of a urine specimen.

rhe specimen will be numbered
and sent to the Olympic laboratory
at UCLA to be tested using the
mass chromatography technique,
according to Geiger. The proce
dure is 99 percent accurate, he
said.

The lab will report which num
bers. if any, test positive for
banned substances, and Geiger
will match those numbers with
the names of students. The indi
vidual students and Steyer will
then be notified of the results.
"This is exactly what the stu
dent/athletes go through under
the NCAA program." Geiger said.
Reaction among students was
low-key, although most were
surprised and a few asked chal
lenging questions. At least 10 stu
dents were observed signing the
consent forms.

The list of banned drugs — ln
eluding cocoa and ehocolate, eola
soft drinks. Morning Thunder tea
and over-the-counter cold medica
tion such as Robitussin — elicited
the most comment, largely
derisive.
"Chocolate?" whispered one
woman to another. "This list is
ridiculous."
The NCAA bans substances con
sidered to be performance
enhancing drugs, as well as illegal
drugs such as marijuana and
cocaine, according to Geiger.
"What's the purpose of this (the
drug testing)?" senior Tracy Pan
nell asked Steyer. "What right do
you have to do this to us?"
Steyer repeated that it is an edu
cational experiment, but he did
not answer Pannell's second ques
tion. "It's a question whether the
NCAA has that right." he said.
Several students stated that
they would not sign the waiver.
"I'm definitely not signing." said
Pannell. "It may be educational,
but I think he's doing the same
thing the NCAA is doing. . . . It's
discriminatory."
"It's crap and I'm pissed." said
freshman David Hornik. "I'm not
sure if I'm going to sign. I just
might miss the softball tourna
ment."
Most students, however, were
less upset.
"I'm not sure what I really think.
Drug testing is something that
should be done, but it can be an
invasion of privacy," said fresh
man Bruce Elvin. "I'm just signing

"This is an educational experi
ment," Steyer told the startled
class. "Drug testing is a national
issue, one we're going to look at
when we get to right of privacy,
and it's an issue that's relevant to
Stanford. ... I want us to go
through this before we discuss the
issue in class."
But one reliable source who
refused to be named said that no
drug testing will actually take
place — students will be walked
through the testing area but will
not have to produce a urine
sample.
The protocol for the drug testing
is deliberately modeled after the
NCAA program. Under NCAA
rules, student/athletes who fail to
sign the drug consent forms will
become ineligible for all intercol
legiate competition that year.
They may also lose their athletic
scholarships, although that Is
decided on a case-by-case^basis.
In Steyer's program, students
who refuse to sign will not be
allowed to compete in the class
softball tournament. Steyer's con
sent forms echo the language of
the NCAA consent forms, conclud
ing:
"I further understand that this
consent and my test results will
become a part of my educational
records subject to disclosure only
In accordance with my written
Buckley Amendment consent and
the Family Education Rights and
Privacy Act of 1974."
Steyer assured the students,
however, thai the results of the
tests would not become a part of
their educational records. For stu
dent/athletes. result s of drug tests
do become part of their records.
"All of this is strictly confiden
tial. If you test positive, no one will
know except yourself, me and
(Athletic Director) Andy Geiger.
This will not become part of your
educational file." he said.
NCAA athletes who test positive
become ineligible for postseason
competition. Students in Steyer's
class who test positive must per
form 15 hours of community ser
vice in East Palo Alto.
The Stanford Athletic Depart
ment will administer the drug
testing, just as it does for Stan
ford's student/athletes.
Geiger and Stan Scott, head
athletic trainer, explained the
NCAA program and the logistics of
drug testing.
The 50 randomly selected stu
dents will each be accompanied at
Encina Gym by a monitor of the
same sex, who will observe the
production of a urine specimen.

rhe specimen will be numbered
and sent to the Olympic laboratory
at UCLA to be tested using the
mass chromatography technique,
according to Geiger. The proce
dure is 99 percent accurate, he
said.

The lab will report which num
bers. if any, test positive for
banned substances, and Geiger
will match those numbers with
the names of students. The indi
vidual students and Steyer will
then be notified of the results.
"This is exactly what the stu
dent/athletes go through under
the NCAA program." Geiger said.
Reaction among students was
low-key, although most were
surprised and a few asked chal
lenging questions. At least 10 stu
dents were observed signing the
consent forms.

The list of banned drugs — ln
eluding cocoa and ehocolate, eola
soft drinks. Morning Thunder tea
and over-the-counter cold medica
tion such as Robitussin — elicited
the most comment, largely
derisive.
"Chocolate?" whispered one
woman to another. "This list is
ridiculous."
The NCAA bans substances con
sidered to be performance
enhancing drugs, as well as illegal
drugs such as marijuana and
cocaine, according to Geiger.
"What's the purpose of this (the
drug testing)?" senior Tracy Pan
nell asked Steyer. "What right do
you have to do this to us?"
Steyer repeated that it is an edu
cational experiment, but he did
not answer Pannell's second ques
tion. "It's a question whether the
NCAA has that right." he said.
Several students stated that
they would not sign the waiver.
"I'm definitely not signing." said
Pannell. "It may be educational,
but I think he's doing the same
thing the NCAA is doing. . . . It's
discriminatory."
"It's crap and I'm pissed." said
freshman David Hornik. "I'm not
sure if I'm going to sign. I just
might miss the softball tourna
ment."
Most students, however, were
less upset.
"I'm not sure what I really think.
Drug testing is something that
should be done, but it can be an
invasion of privacy," said fresh
man Bruce Elvin. "I'm just signing
