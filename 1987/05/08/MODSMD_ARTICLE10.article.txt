# Faculty Senate meeting
## CUS retains control of Overseas Studies 
### JOHN POLLACK Senior staff writer 
Back in session yesterday after a
five-week layoff, the Faculty Sen
ate decided not to institute a new
oversight system for the Univer
sity's Overseas Studies Program,
renewed the degree-granting au
thority of the International Policy
Studies program and received a
report from the dean of the School
of Engineering.
The senate, acting on recom
mendations from the Committee
on Committees (CoC), reaffirmed
that the Committee for Under
graduate Studies (CUS) is respon
sible for the oversight of the Over
seas Studies program.
Concern had been expressed in

recent months regarding the abil
ity of CUS to govern the Overseas
Studies Program in light of com
mittee's workload. But the senate
gave the CUS a vote of confidence,
although it did make several
procedural recommendations to
the committee.
"The newly restructured over
sight system for Overseas Studies
through CUS has not yet been
fully tested, and it should be put
to the test before yet another sys
tem is put in place," the CoC re
ported to the senate.
While the CoC recommen
dations were approved unani
mously. serious debate erupted
over whether to renew the degree
granting authority of the Interna

tional Policy Studies (IPS) pro
gram.
The IPS program, which grants
about 15 master's degrees each
year, was criticized for not requir
ing courses about the ethics of in
ternational policy-making.
"There seems to me to be an ab
sence of any serious concern with
moral issues raised by the the wil
lingness of other governments
and other groups who use force,
deception and coercion to pursue
international goals," said Michael
Bratman. professor of philosophy.
"Are such issues really less es
sential to the study of interna
tional policy than a course in ac
counting? The implicit message
in this program is that they are,"
Bratman said.

History Prof. John Wirth, chair
of the Committee on Graduate
Studies, defended the IPS pro
gram. He said the program's rt
quired core seminar — taught by
History Prof. Barton Bernstein
fulfilled the shortcomings pei
ceived by Bratman.
The allocation of limited fund
ing was another facet of the IPS
program debate. Questions were
raised as to the cost effectiveness
of funding interdisciplinary pro
grams not based in one depart
ment.
After debate, however, the
degree-granting authority of the
IPS program was renewed by tin
senate through the 1991-92 aca
demic year.
