In these days before the first major celebra
tion of the University's Centennial — Corner
stone Weekend begins Thursday — the air is
rife with reflections on the past and specula
tions about the future. One is regaled with
tales about Stanford's noble history and in
undated with ambitious and detailed
blueprints for its second century.
Sadly, these Centennial looks backward
and forward are sorely lacking in one impor
tant area: Nowhere in the University's long
and storied past — or in the bright and noble
plans for its future — does one hear mention
of ice cream. Stanford somehow endured its
first 100 years without an ice cream fountain
on campus; the University would be lucky to
survive into next week without one.
The need for such an institution is ob
vious. Currently, the only form of ice cream
consistently available on campus is that of
the pre-packaged, foil-wrapped variety at The
Store. Oh, Food Service occasionally offers
ice cream or sherbet as part of its dessert
menu, but all too often it is rough and taste
less. And frozen yogurt is available practi

cally 24 hours per day somewhere on campus
(this is, after all, California), but it's just not
the same.
The mouth-watering presence of ice cream
on campus will solve many problems. No
longer will there be a need to woo prospective
freshman with pseudo scholarships. The
police will not harass innocent, God-fearing
ice cream-eaters on late weekend nights. Ice
cream will serve as a smooth, creamy pacifier
of campus life. With ice cream at Stanford, all
will be well.
And there is no need to create a Task Force
on the Lack of Ice Cream at Stanford, no
need to assign the problem to some random,
issue-killing University committee, no need
to have a special ASSU election with prefer
ential balloting for different flavors, no need
to call a press conference to heighten aware
ness of the issue.
All that needs to be done is for the campus
community to demand the installation of an
ice cream fountain in Tresidder.
Let there be ice cream. Now.
