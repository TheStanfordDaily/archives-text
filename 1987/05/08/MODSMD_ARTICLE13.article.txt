Cheerleaders
will put an
end to apathy
Andy Schwartz's recent article
condemning the efforts of the
Athletic Department to Incor
porate cheerleaders Into Stanford
sports (Dally, May 5) Is mislead
ing at best. His claim that cheer
leading will "sully our proud and
defiant past" is curious. What has
"anti-establlshmentarianism," if
that is truly what we believe in,
done for us at Stanford? At Big
Game. I felt embarrassed for
Stanford, and Its fans, who could
do nothing in the stands but
whine about our team's errors
and boo at our team's kicker
(however poor performance. . o ,f
was). Even the efforts of the Axe
Committee to start the "Axe Yell"
failed to raise Stanford's morale.
Was this "antl-establlshment
arianism" or simple apathy?
Around Stanford there seems to
be such an effort to be non
conformist, particularly at sport
ing events, that It Is out of the
pale to "conform" — that is, cheer
together. It is strange that non
conformity has become the rule to
live by. Perhaps you who demand
non-conformity should kick off
your Reeboks and reconsider
what It means to be "proud and
defiant."
In addition, cheerleading need
not be "antiquated and boring,"
as Schwartz claims. Perhaps he is
imagining high school girls in
miniskirts. No. In fact, college
cheerleading is a complex series
of acrobatics and tumbling. It
requires a great deal of balance
and coordination, and is poten
tially dangerous. Certainly, un
trained, non-conformist, "white
punks on dope" should not at
tempt these feats. The routines
require months of training, and

the performers should be
respected for their work, not
classified as "neo-fascist."
I envision Stanford cheerlead
ing as having its own personality
that will appeal to students while
retaining that uniquely Stanford
character. We will still have
LSJUMB to show us a good time.
Cheerleaders won't ruin any fun,
they will only give people a chance
to cheer together in support of
the team. And yes, you don't have
to cheer if you don't want to.
And lastly, in response to
Schwartz's closing argument: A
game should not be "boring"
simply because the team is
losing. Perhaps if our athletes felt
that we supported them, win or
lose, they would fare better on the
fields and courts.

Fraternities
will have to
be disbanded
Spring is here once again, and
with it, fraternity Rush.
Ordinarily dignified black
pledges parade around campus in
cute red and white outfits, other
pledges hide in the rear of lecture
halls, desperately trying to stay
awake after sacrificing their sleep
to predawn Rush silliness, and a
most-likely drunk fraternity offi
cer stumbles into Lagunita and
drowns.
Everywhere I have observed
them (Stanford, UC-Berkeley and
San Diego State University) fra
ternities have been clearly organi
zations dedicated to the encour
agement of drunkenness, promis
cuity, Intimidation and violence.
Dissenters from this view who are
not fraternity members have
always been few.
I fail to understand why the
University tolerates and condones

these pernicious organizations on
campus. Clearly, no Stanford
chapter of other organizations
with similar goals and activities
— for example the Hell's Angels —
would be similarly tolerated.
I applaud the University Admin
istration's recent efforts to apply
normal civilized and legal stand
ards of behavior to the fraterni
ties. I believe the future will show
that the fraternities will have to
be eliminated from the campus
before they abandon their un
civilized and illegal lifestyle.

10 years later
and still no
divestment
This Saturday, members of the
Stanford Committee for Respon
sible Investment Policy (SCRIP)
will gather at Stanford for a 10-
year reunion of the Old Union
sit-in that led to 294 arrests and
galvanized campus anti-apartheid
protesting that continues to this
day. Over 51 colleges and univer
sities have totally divested their
holdings in companies with sig
nificant investments in South
Africa. Many cities, even states,
have done the same.
Sadly, Stanford University is
not among them. We are return-,
ing to Stanford not just to renew
old friendships but also to ask
why this is.
Ten years ago, a statement
made by over 250 of us who were
arrested at the Old Union was
printed in The Daily. We noted
that:
"The trustees now have a tre
mendous obligation to prove their
contention that American corpo
rations are playing a progressive
role in South Africa. Our research
and the research of their own
consultant, has shown this con
tention to be untrue."

Ten years of bloody history have
only reinforced the conclusions
we reached long ago; conclusions
that propelled us to risk a little of
ourselves to try and break Stan
ford's chain of complicity with
apartheid.
To those who would wonder
with what right we return to
protest at Stanford. I would first
say it is both a right and a re
sponsibility. We have the right to
demonstrate because we are still
part of the Stanford community,
and even more we have the right
to reach out and take control of
our own lives, which is what
protesting is, in both moral and
physical ways. We have the re
sponsibility to protest what the
University Board of Trustees does
in the name of all of Stanford,
because to oppose what is
wrong is to condone ffand to J $
become a de facto $

Elitist group
won't improve
student body
I couldn't imagine a more
simple-minded statement than
Dean of Humanities and Sciences
Norman Wessells' letter on the
Jordan Scholars program (Daily,
May 5). His thinking is in
sensitive both to the issue of
academic potential and to the
needs of undergraduate educa
tion at Stanford.
First, it is extremely pre
sumptuous to attribute a special
intellectual or creative capacity to
a few undergraduates. I don't
doubt that those selected as Jor
dan Scholars would be particu
larly fit for academic success.
What annoys me is that students
who will end up performing just
as well will be pre-classified as
second-rate on the basis of lower

SAT scores, inferior high school
education or perhaps inevitably,
lower socio-economic back
ground.
One cannot readily estimate
factors like desire, compassion
and concentration, which in my
experience are more important
for academic success, and for
good scholarship and teaching,
than being "truly gifted"
(whatever that means). When
Dean Wessells speaks of selecting
truly gifted high school students
to eventually become teachers in
universities, does he have any
insight at all into what consti
tutes a truly gifted teacher?
Finally, I am wary of the
premature estimation of some
thing as deep-set as creativity. I
do know, however, that anyone
with an ounce of it will not be
"discoverlrfg the limits of human «
knowledge" right out of high
school.
Second, if Stanford has to give
extra incentives to outstanding
students to come here, it is ad
mitting to a problem that can't be
solved so easily. The Jordan
Scholars program is purely cos
metic. According to Wessells, it
intends to change Stanford's
"image" by attracting a few stu
dents who wouldn't come here
otherwise. Wessells seems to
envision a sort of philosopher
king set up, with the Jordan
Scholars lifting the rest of us into
the light of true giftedness. I don't
see this happening. Images must
be changed from the bottom, not
from the top. While an elitist
crust is applied to the student
body, the general situation
remains the same. The answer
might well lie in seriously recon
sidering the bases upon which
students are admitted to Stan
ford. In any case, the University
should seek remedies that ad
dress the complexity of the issue
and not merely attempt to save
face.

Drinking laws
discriminate
I am a minority, discriminated
against and worried by a recent
about the enforcement of drink
ing laws (Daily, May 1). The Cali
fornia law making 21 the legal
drinking age discriminates
against people from 18 to 20,
tax-paying adult citizens who are
held in limbo and denied the
same rights as other citizens. I do
not question the authority of
police to enforce the drinking age,
just as no one could question the
authority of police in the South
enforcing racially discriminatory
laws in an era not long passed. I
merely question the con
stitutionality of age discrimina
tf tion and its place at Stanford.
Stanford has a smarter rule —
responsibility. Students here,
whether 18 or 21, pride them
selves on following it and with
excellent results. Stanford is
relatively safe from alcohol and
drug problems, rape and suicide
— one need only look at other
universities and communities to
see that we have better controlled
such problems without enforcing
laws of questionable con
stitutionality. But no one is
immune to society's vices — Re
publican Sen. Robert Hasten from
Wisconsin, a staunch supporter
of Mothers Against Drunk
Driving, was arrested in Washing
ton D.C. about a year ago for
driving intoxicated.
The death of David Dunshee
should remind us all of our re
sponsibilities for our actions and
to watch out for others to prevent
another tragedy. A police crack
down and a policy of resident
assistants as fun police (like UC-
Berkeley) will ruin our commu
nity based on responsibility and
intelligence which distinguishes
us from the rest.
