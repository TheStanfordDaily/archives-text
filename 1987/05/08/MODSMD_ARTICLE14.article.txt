# Don't ban alcohol at Stanford
## 
### 
The University, with several developing
policies, threatens to damage its own thought
fully and rightfully designed stand toward stu
dent freedom and independent decision
making.
Stanford has received national praise for al
lowing students to be reponsible for the conse
quences of their own actions. University offi
cials correctly recognize that the right to con
sider consequences and act according to one's
own choice is extremely important to a per
son's education.

The latest events that contradict this stance
Involve the choice to use alcohol. Norm Robin
son. acting dean of Student Affairs and Resi
dential Education guru, recently reiterated
what he and other officials have always said,
that University alcohol policy is "educational
because it places responsibility on the individ
ual to know what the law is and to be informed
about the issue of alcohol in general."
The first example of the disturbing trend
away from Robinson's fine words is the nearly
Inevitable upcoming decision to ban alcohol in
Stanford Stadium. The primary reason given
by Athletic Director Andy Geiger Is that there
were too many fights in the student section,
and too many alcohol-related "incidents"
during football games this year. One
"incident" cited is the h'ttlng of a Dollle by a
pomegranate. With all due sympathy to which
ever one of our beautiful Dollies was hit by the

fruit of original sin, that kind of thing is
bound to happen at an emotional sporting
event attended by more than 30,000 people;
the right to drink beer and in turn uphold a
reasonable alcohol policy is simply worth an
occasional pomegranate hurling.
The University wishes to foster responsible
attitudes toward drinking. A responsible atti
tude allows people to drink a few beers during
a football game if they wish. Sure, a few people
choose to drink too much at the stadium.
Sure, if we ban alcohol, the one guy who was
hit in the head with a full beer can last season
might not have been. But so what. A ban
assumes that students are irresponsible
drinkers, when in fact most are responsible
and do not deserve to suffer the inconvenience.
In addition, and in contradiction of Univer
sity goals, a ban on alcohol actually encourages
irresponsible drinking. People will resort to
sneaking in alcohol. Drinking before the game
at tailgaters cannot be regulated, and those
who find it desireable to get drunk at football
games will drink much more before the game
and be just as drunk, if not more so. People will
also go back to tailgating at halftlme. Halftime
"pass-outs" may acquire a new meaning.
A ban may also create a police state in the
stands; this will be necessary to enforce such a
policy, and it will result in a lack of comfort
and ugly scenes, such as witnessed in USC's
stadium.
The other disturbing development in
campus alcohol policy is more complex, as it
involves the police, who are responsible for en
forcing state law and not University residential
policy.
I refer to the events of last weekend, when
the police entered three major open parties on

campus and asked bartenders to be sure they
were serving people over 21.
The police argue that they are not doing any
thing different, and the University says its
policy has not changed, but most are highly
skeptical. The police said they entered the Beta
and Sigma Chi parties because there was great
pedestrian/beer traffic between the two par
ties. However, these two houses have held
similar parties on Thursday nights for years,
with just as much traffic and no police intru
sion. There was no change in state alcohol
laws during those years, so students say the
police are "cracking down" and the police offer
absurd denials. The University and the police
owe students a better explanation of what is
going on.
Every student I have talked to. with a few
fringe-element exceptions, is against the ban
ning of alcohol in Stanford Stadium. But who
has called or written Andy Geiger and told him
that it is a stupid idea? (Similarly, the vast
majority of students is against the creation of
the Jordan Scholars program, but who calls
Dean of Admissions Jean Fetter to register op
position?) Who has complained to the police
and President Kennedy's office about what
most students consider unwarranted and in
timidating intrusions by police into University
residences? Fortunately, students and alumni
will have a chance to protest the upcoming
stadium alcohol ban at an open forum to be
held at Encina Gym on May 18 at noon.
If students do not act to prevent these
policies. Stanford will be a worse place and the
University will be falsely confident that it has
solved something.
