## It's a party—the Brazilian way 
### FLAVIO FEFERMAN 
The Stanford colors this Satur
day will be green and yellow rather
than cardinal and white. The
Brazilian Carnaval Ball returns to
the Farm for the second year in a
row after a seven year absence.
The event was first organized in
1968 by Maria Bun, director of the
Office of International Visitors
and Carnaval enthusiast from
Brazil. By the late 19705, the ball
had moved from the Bechtel Inter
national Center to Roble Gym and
finally to Maples to accomodate
the increasing crowds. Some
1,200 people attended the fes
tivities in 1977.
Approximately 600 people cele
brated the rebirth of the event last
year and even more "folioes" (a
Brazilian term for Carnaval party
animals) are expected at the I-
Center this Saturday.
But what's the philosophy be
hind the ball? Why do Brazilians
hold this festival? Everything that
could have gone wrong with the
country over the past year did:
Brazil had economic chaos, food
shortages, and crime and debt to
cap it off. But Carnaval in Brazil
(held in early March) was as
animated as ever this year. Is
Brazil "not a serious country," as
Charles DeGaulle once said?
There are two explanations for
this party-as-the-ship-sinks atti
tude. First, Carnaval is the means
of releasing all the frustrations ac

cumulated during the year in
Brazil. It also provides motivation
to keep battling one more year un
til Carnaval arrives again. The
second explanation for this
seemingly "Irresponsible" behav
ior is that Brazilians know how to
separate work and play. There is
an unwritten philosophy that
business and pleasure-seeking ex
ist side but side but don't mix. or
else neither works — you can't
work when you think about play
and most of all you can't play
when you think about work.
Carnaval is a sort of hedonistic
Thanksgiving for Brazilians. Be
tween bottles of beer and frantic
dancing, they are thankful for sur
viving one more year of economic
crisis. But they are also thankful
for still knowing how to have fun
in spite of it all.
Just like Brazil. Stanford stu
dents tend to live in a permanent
state of crisis: midterms, grades,
graduate school exams, job
searches, etc. Perhaps, by organ
izing the Carnaval Ball, the
Brazilian Students Association
(BSA) wants to transmit Brazil's
philosophy of a good time by using
"applied methods." Stanford stu
dents could surely use this.
So, can Carnaval and Stanford
match? "Sure," says Gustavo
Valenca, president of the BSA.
"Stanford is a culturally diverse
community — so people are at

tracted to international events liKe
the Carnaval Ball."
"Plus, we all need to let off some
steam." he added.
Valenca is optimistic about the
success of this year's event: Last
year's experience made organiza
tion easier; things are coming out
more smoothly."
Returning from last year is
Brasil Ja (Brazil Now), perhaps
the best samba band in the Bay
Area. Notably, the band has pro
vided live music for San Fran
cisco's giant Carnaval Ball in early
March for the past two years. It
must be said that ball in Brazil
does not imply waltz. Hard samba
is (he mode.
"People were having so much
fun last year that we decided to ex
tend the ball this year, so we're
starting one hour earlier (at 8
p.m.)," Valenca said, adding that
costumes are not mandatory but
are highly recommended. Any
"festive wear" is appropriate.
Prizes will nonetheless be awarded
for the most original attire. As
sorted refreshments will also be
available.
The Brazilian Carnaval Ball is
co-sponsored by the Bechtel Inter
national Center, the Center for
Latin American Studies and the
ASSU. Tickets are on sale in ad
vance at Bass Ticket Outlet and
the I-Center for $8 (students and
staff) and $10 (general). Tickets
will cost $10 to $13 at the door.
