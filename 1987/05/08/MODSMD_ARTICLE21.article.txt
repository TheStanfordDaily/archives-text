## Bears thump Card in series opener, 19-9 
### CHRIS MYERS Editorial staff 
BERKELEY — Yesterday afternoon at Cal
ifornia's Evans Diamond, the Stanford
baseball team got a taste of its own
medicine. And It didn't taste good. Yuck.
The Pacific 10 Southern Division-leading
Cardinal spent the last week pummeling
non-league pipsqueaks like Sacramento
State and Santa Clara by scores like 21-7,
19-2 and 11-3. But yesterday Stanford got
picked on by someone its own size, as the
red-hot Golden Bears piled up 18 hits on
the way to a 19-9 victory in the opener of a
four-game series with the Cardinal.
With the loss, Stanford dropped a half
game to UCLA in the Six-Pac standings, but
the Cardinal still holds a two-and-a-half
game lead over the second-place Bruins.
Stanford's magic number remains at three,
meaning that any combination of Cardinal
wins and Bruin losses totaling three will
clinch the Six-Pac championship for Stan
ford.
Yesterday's game was a nightmare from
which the Cardinal could not awake. Stan
ford spotted the Bears eight runs in the
first inning, then came roaring back to
within two runs at one point, only to be
buried beneath another barrage of Cal runs
in the sixth and seventh innings.
Although Stanford missed a few scoring
opportunities and made a couple ill-timed
fielding gaffes, the real story in this game
was the Golden Bear bats.
The Cal batters showed no respect for
Cardinal starter Lee Plemel. sending 14
men to the plate in the first inning. Before
the frame was over, the Bears had capi
talized on four singles, a grand slam home
run by Rich Aldrete and a two-run homer by
Darryl Vice, two walks, a wild pitch, a hit
batter and a crucial muffed double-play ball
to put eight runs on the board.
"[California] did a great job of swinging
the bat, especially when we got behind (in
the count) and they could sit on the fast
one," Stanford Coach Mark Marquess said.
Plemel settled down and blanked the
Bears in the second and third frames. But

Bear starter Travis Willis did him one bet
ter. no-hitting the Cardinal through three.
Stanford was far from dead, however.
"With the score 8-0, everybody thinks the
game's over, but not against Stanford."
Aldrete said.
In the fourth, the Cardinal showed signs
of life with five singles. But a double-play
ball quelled the Cardinal attack and Willis
escaped the inning with only two runs
worth of damage done.
Stanford finally unloaded on Willis in the
fifth. A triple by Ruben Amaro, a double by
Toi Cook and consecutive singles by Ed
Sprague, Paul Carey and Jeff Saenger made
the score 9-6 with two men on and no outs,
by which time Willis had been replaced by
left-hander Fred Corral. Stanford catcher
Doug Robbins struck out. but with one out,
first baseman Ron Witmeyer drilled a
double into the rightfield corner. Carey
scored easily from second, and third base
coach Dean Stotz waved Saenger home
from first. But the ball arrived at the plate
earlier than anyone expected. Saenger. and
the Stanford rally, were as dead as Gary
Hart's presidential campaign.
"That was unfortunate. I really thought
he (Saenger) would score." Marquess said.
"They did a great job of getting the ball out
of the corner."
Stanford scratched out another run in
the sixth to climb within two runs at 9-7.
Before Cal fans' ulcers even had a chance
to start bleeding, however, the Bears fought
back with five runs in the bottom of the
sixth. They enjoyed that experience so
much they decided to add another five in
the seventh. By the end of that frame Stan
ford was in such dire straits that freshman
Brian Johnson was brought in as the
team's fifth pitcher of the game. Johnson
threw a no-hitter in his last pitching ap
pearance — in the final game of his high
school career last spring.
The Stanford-Cal series continues this af
ternoon with a 2:30 start at Sunken Dia
mond. The series returns to Berkeley for a 1
p.m. game Saturday and closes back at the
Farm on Sunday at 1 p.m.
