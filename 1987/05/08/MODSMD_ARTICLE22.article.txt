# Stanford tracksters head south for Modesto Relays

### ERIK STEN Editorial staff 
With the Pacific 10 Conference championships
only two weeks away, Stanford track and field will
travel to Modesto, where tomorrow the Cardinal will
take part in the Modesto Relays. As always at this
time of year, the emphasis will be on qualifying and
preparing.
Those who haven't qualified for the Pac-lOs will at
tempt to do so, while those who have will concentrate
on fine-tuning their specialities.
"The whole team is going to both solidify the
events each athlete is running, and add to the Pac-10
(qualifying) team," Asst. Coach Scott Chisam said.
"We're working on the events in which we can place
at conference."
At this point, 12 men and 18 women have bettered
the Pac-10 standards. The women's team, for the
most part, has already qualified all the athletes it was
expected to, Chisam said. The men's team, however,
will need some more participants if it hopes to im
prove on last year's seventh place finish at the confer
ence meet.
Key to the Cardinal's chances will be getting shot
putters Andy Papathanassiou and Brian Boggess.
hammer thrower Deron Lord, hurdler Kraig Sanders
and javelin throwers Dave Pickett and Fred
Mondragon admitted to the Pac-10 meet.

Papathanassiou, however, is also a football player
and will consequently be involved in this weekend's
football drills, so his qualifying attempts will have to
wait another week. And because there is no Javelin
competition in Modesto, Chisam will be accompany
ing Pickett, Mondragon and women's team member
Erica Wheeler to Occidental where they will be able to
compete.
There are obstacles in the way, but Chisam is still
optimistic about the team's chances. "Everyone is
real close, real close to knocking it (the standard)
down," he said. "It's just a matter of going out and
doing it."
In Modesto, the Cardinal will be concentrating on
both the men's and women's sprint and mile relays.
In the last few weeks, both groups have improved
steadily and if the trend continues, they could score
at the conference meets. With that end in mind, the
team's sprinters will spend the next two weeks con
centrating on relay, instead of individual work.
Missing from the team this weekend will be
hurdler Pam Board and freshman sprinter Gus En
vela. as both will be resting sore hamstrings. Board
was injured last weekend against California when
the senior slipped in the blocks at the start of the
100-meter hurdles. Envela, who just this week began
working out at full speed again, is still recovering
from a hamstring pulled three weeks ago at the
Bruce Jenner Classic in San Jose.

Pacific 10 and NCAA championships. The Cardinal squad travels to Modesto tomorrow in search of quali
