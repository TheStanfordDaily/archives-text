# Card women netters given tough NCAA draw
## 
### KEN STEVENS Senior staff writer 
When Stanford and USC were
ranked first and second in the
1987 preseason women's tennis
poll, many observers must have
figured that the traditional rivals
would once again meet when the
NCAA team championships rolled
around.
Few, however, would have
predicted that the two teams that
have split the last six national
titles would be matched up in the
first round this year. Yet. when
the pairings were announced yes
terday. fourth-seeded Stanford
was scheduled to meet 13th
seeded USC next Thursday in the
opening round at the UCLA/Los

Angeles Tennis Center.
The Trojans, riddled by Injuries,
had to scramble to qualify for the
team tournament this season. But
they will still mark a departure
from the cushy first-round oppo
nents that the Cardinal has drawn
the past few years. "You can't look
ahead of the first round — espe
cially when the match Is like that."
Stanford Asst. Coach Caryn
Copeland said yesterday.
If Stanford were to look past the
first round. It would find that the
draw gets no easier. Should It get
by USC. the Cardinal would then
play the winner of the UCLA-
Kentucky match Friday. The fifth
seeded Bruins are hosting the
tournament and were 20-0 this
season before plummeting during

the final month of the season.
Stanford's semifinal opponent
would likely be top-seeded Florida,
which is undefeated this season.
In the finals, the Cardinal could
face No. 2 Miami (Fla.) or No. 3
California, which defeated Stan
ford twice this season.
The Stanford-USC contest will
mark a rematch of last year's
NCAA final, which saw the Card
inal win 5-4 in Austin. Tex.
Despite an off-season this year,
the Trojans gave the Cardinal two
tough matches, splitting the
singles on both occasions before
being swept in doubles.
Copeland said Stanford is confi
dent despite the challenging first
round draw. "We have to remem
ber that we beat them (USC)

twice," she said.
With regard to the overall draw.
Copeland said: "It will make the
victory even sweeter — if we win. If
we can do it, we'll know we did it
the hard way."
Copeland gave several reasons
why the Cardinal is optimistic
about its chances of repeating as
champion. The continuing im
provement of senior Leigh Anne
Eldredge and sophomore Eleni
Rossides. and the return to action
of junior Cari Hagey, bode well for
the team, she said.
' With Eleni and Leigh Anne,
every day helps them." Copeland
said. "We're going to be much bet
ter at nationals than we were
against Cal (in last Friday's 5-4
loss at Berkeley). They're both so

tough in their past history. You
can't doubt they have the ability to
do it again.
"I think we're going to have
Cari," Copeland added, indicating
that Hagey will play No. 3 doubles
when she returns. "She's been out
every day. She's been playing
well."
The Cardinal's experience —
three seniors and two juniors —
will help offset the tough draw
also. "Our seniors have played on
two championships teams,"
Copeland said. "That's a lot of ex
perience."
And. though the road to the
championship looks to be an up
hill one, Stanford does not figure
to be intimidated by the other
highly rated teams. "Florida is No.

1, but they haven't played us on
the West Coast." Copeland said.
"(And) we beat UCLA at home (at
the L.A. Tennis Center)."
Stanford is not the only team
that received an unusual draw. In
two other sections, teams trom
the same region are matched in
the first round. Texas and Trinity
play in the lower half of the
bracket, and Northwestern and
Indiana meet in the first round in
the upper half of the bracket.
The names of the players who
qualified for the NCAA individual
tournament (May 18 to 21) will be
announced today. The Stanford
men's team finds out Sunday it it
received a spot in the NCAA team
championships in Athens. Ga..
May 16 to 24.
