# Stanford faces Cal in Big Row
## 
### 
The Big Jim Reynolds Cup Is
not a new brand of cigarettes.
Rather, It Is the reward for win
ning the annual Big Row, and the
Stanford men's varsity will be
looking to regain the cup for the
first time since 1972 when the
Cardinal faces California tomor
row beginning at 9 a.m. at Red
wood Shores.
The Stanford women varsity has
fared better against the Golden

Bears, having won four of the last
five Big Rows.
The dual meet will be the last of
the season for the Cardinal
rowers, who will be competing in
the Pacific Coast Championships
next weekend In Sacramento.
The Cardinal, however. Is not
looking past the Bears.
"Cal looks good," Stanford
Women's Coach John Davis said.
"They're rowing better than I've

seen in a few years."
Stanford men's coach Ken
Dreyfuss has similar concerns.
"We haven't raced Cal since we
beat them at the San Diego Crew
Classic when they had two people
out with injuries," he said. "This
weekend's Cal crew team will be a
whole new crew. It's going to be a
good hard race."
"The seniors in the boat really
want to beat Cal," Cardinal varsity
sophomore Tyler Simonton said.
"It's a big race for everyone. We've
lost a few shirts to them in the
past few years. We're focusing on
the race and not looking ahead to
next week."
The Big Row was first held in
1904 and has become an annual
event ever since, excepting the
war years when Stanford had no
crews.
Last weekend, the Stanford
crews had mixed results. The men
won the team trophy at the New
port Regatta by defeating Long
Beach State', UC-Irvine, San Diego
and Santa Clara. Meanwhile the
women lost to a tough UCLA crew.
