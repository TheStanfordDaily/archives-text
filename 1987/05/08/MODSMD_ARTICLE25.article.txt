## 'Repression fosters democracy' 
### ASHLEY GRIFFIN 
Democracy in Latin America will be easier to estab
lish in countries that suffer from severe governmen
tal repression and poor economies, according to a
leading expert on Latin American politics who spoke
here Wednesday.
Guillermo O'Donnell, an Argentinian scholar who
is currently teaching at the University of Notre
Dame, addressed what he termed "the paradoxes of
success." saying that those countries that are better
off economically are less likely to establish democracy
because economic success makes the bourgeois
more ambivalent about change.
O'Donnell told a group of 75 people in History Cor
ner that a rapid change from authoritarian to more
liberal forms of governments does not significantly
affect the middle sector of those Latin American
societies.
"The unpleasant conclusion is that it (the con
solidation of democracy) is an elite affair," he said.

adding that the elites do not place priority on al
leviating social inequality.
According to O'Donnell. Latin American people
have a "Utopian hope" that democracy will solve their
societies' problems. This hope is "the major driving
force" behind the consolidation of democracy, he
said.
But wi.thout results, the people rapidly become dis
illusioned: they return to a "non-heroic business as
usual'. " attitude.
Addressing the issue of government efficacy,
O'Donnell said Latin American governments must
convey the notion that they are trying to help the
people.
The timing of government programs is also a prob
lem. Political leaders must act rapidly or their gov
ernments will degenerate into "politics of despair,"
he said.
O'Donnell said the economic crises and debt prob
lems of Latin America also pose questions that "are
too important to be left to politicians."
