# KZSU won't broadcast parties
## 
### JOHN LIS Editorial staff 
Campus radio station KZSU will no
longer publicize campus parties over the
air in response to fears by officials of
Residential Education that doing so
would make Stanford parties more ac
cessible to non-students.
"We don't want to take any chances at
this point." Station Manager Scott Mar
tin said. "To be honest, we have quite a
few listeners at Paly (Palo Alto High
School) and Menlo-Atherton (High
School)."
The KZSU feature, billed as the "Party
Warrior" by disc jockeys Jono Oliver and
Tom McConville, solicited phone calls
from party organizers, then publicized
the events during their 9 p.m. to mid
night show last Friday.

Acting Dean of Student Affairs Norm
Robinson had earlier complained about
the feature while noting the growth of
open parties on campus. "KZSU's now
broadcasting where parties are, so any
semblance of a closed party has disap
peared," he said. "All-campus parties are
now in effect South Peninsula parties,
that's what you're talking about with
KZSU."
"We pretty much thought we were pro
viding a service." Oliver said. "We
thought it would be fun. We did it for
one week and thought it worked out
well. " Oliver said organizers of parties at
Loro house in Florence Moore Hall,
Okada house in Wilbur Hall. Phi Psi
House and the Beta Theta Pi fraternity
contributed to last week's premier
feature.
"High school kids have always come to

Stanford parties," Oliver said. "Last
week was the first time we did this. It's
not like all of a sudden high school kids
started flocking to parties. We're both in
the SAE (Sigma Alpha Epsilon) house,
so we know what it's like when they start
showing up and we don't want that. We
understand the rationale involved â€” we
just think it's unfortunate."
"It was (Oliver's and McConville's) in
terest to provide a public service about
what was going on on campus besides
wind ensembles," Martin said. "I talked
with a couple of people from Res Ed who
said it was a poor idea, and I said I
agreed it was a poor idea."
The Loro and Beta parties, along with
a Sigma Chi party, were entered by
police last weekend and bartenders were
instructed to begin checking driver's
licenses for underage drinkers.
