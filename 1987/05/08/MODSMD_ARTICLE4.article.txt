# Minorities attack Kennedy response
## Statement called 'very disrespectful' 
### RUSSELL KOROBKIN Editorial staff 
University President Donald Kennedy and
Provost James Rosse said in a joint state
ment yesterday that they were sending
demands made by minority groups earlier
this week to "the appropriate destination
within Stanford" for study.
Representatives of campus minority or
ganizations were quickly and angrily
blasted the Kennedy/Rosse response.
Asian American Students Association
(AASA) representative Vivian Wu called the
statement a "very disrespectful
response. ... He (Kennedy) didn't make
any type of commitments to take any of
things seriously."
Black Student Union (BSU) representa
tive Kathryne Gambrell said she "took his
letter as one big no comment.' "
At a press conference Tuesday, a coalition
of campus minority groups demanded a
commission to study the quality of minority
life at Stanford, the development of an eth
nic studies department, the establishment
of a vice provost for minority affairs, in
creases in the number of minority students
admitted to the University and the creation
of campus multicultural center.
The Administration statement said the
demands would be sent to different Univer
sity offices for "comments on what is being
done now, what would be required addi
tionally to meet these requests, and what
would be the cost and feasibility of doing so.
"Collecting these responses will take
time," the letter went on to state. "It Is not
realistic to expect a substantive response

within a week or two. Clearly the authors of
the proposals would expect them to be
taken serously. We expect responses will be
developed in a way that is constructive and
responsive to their purpose."
The letter stated that, "The material (the
minority groups) have developed is impor
tant, and many of the points they make
merit serious thought and discussion
within the Stanford community."
But minority leaders expressed disap
pointment at the lack of concrete commit
ments offered by the Administration.
MEChA representative George Cuevas
called the statement an example of the Uni
versity "brushing these issues under the
table." He suggested that by at least propos
ing a timeline, Kennedy could have shown
good faith.
Wu said the lack of definite action makes
her feel Kennedy is "questioning the
legitimacy of our demands. . , . We repre
sent one-third of this campus and we
deserve more," she said.
According to Gambrell, Kennedys
"inaction is a sign of his unwillingness to
validate or even respond to our demands."
She added that his "insensitivity promotes
his inactivity."
Members of the minority organizations
will meet with Rosse at noon today.
Wu said the groups will present Rosse
with a list of demands they feel can be met
this week. It includes immediate presiden
tial support for the report of the Task Force
on the Area One Requirement, a commit
ment to create a minority recruitment
budget within the Office of Admis
sions, a statement by Kennedy at
the Cornerstone Day celebration
about the importance of ethnic
theme houses at Stanford and a
statement to alumni that the In
dian will never be reinstated as
the Stanford mascot.
In addition, the group will
reiterate its demands for the ap
pointment of a commission on the
quality of minority life at Stanford
and a vice provost for minority af
fairs.
Cuevas said "all the minority
groups are mobilizing at this mo
ment." Wu added that minority
groups at other universities had
to "shutdown parts of the univer
sity to get action" toward their
demands.
