# Geiger proposes ban on alcohol in stadium
## 
### JOHN LIS Editorial staff 
Athletic Director Andy Geiger said yester
day that he is proposing to prohibit alco
holic beverages in Stanford Stadium for the
upcoming football season.
"I believe people should be responsible for
their own actions, not regulated by us,"
Geiger said. "Unfortunately, I'm becoming
convinced that doesn't work."
Geiger said he is also considering ban
ning bottles and cans from the stadium in
light of Incidents last season where one
woman was injured by a tossed can of beer
and a Dollie was hit in the face by a
pomegranate thrown from the student sec
tion. Fights in the stands also marred an
otherwise exemplary 8-4 season for the foot
ball team.
Geiger did away with an existing ban on
alcohol when he took his post at Stanford in
1979. "I don't want to be in the business of
regulating what people bring into the
stadium." he said yesterday.
Geiger said his action is only a proposal
and not yet policy. The University Commit
tee on Athletics, Physical Education and
Recreation will meet May 18 at 11:45 a.m.
to discuss the proposal. Geiger said the
meeting is open to the public, and he en
couraged interested members of the com
munity to attend or submit written com
ments to his office.
Many University administrators, includ

ing President Donald Kennedy and Dean of
Student Affairs James Lyons, have said a
dry stadium policy is likely for next season.
Currently, fans are allowed to bring
coolers into the stadium as long as they fit
under the seats; stadium personnel usually
do not check the contents of the coolers.
Few other stadiums allow alcohol, bottles or
cans to be brought in.
Many stadiums that prohibit fans from
bringing their own alcohol in bottles or
cans sell beer in paper cups. Geiger said
Stanford would not begin this practice. "I
don't want to be in the position of having to
card the student body," he said.
"I don't think it's life-threatening to ask
people to abstain from drinking for three
hours. There'll still be plenty of opportuni
ties to have parties before and after games,"
Geiger said. Tailgate parties in campus
parking lots on game days are popular
among fans, especially alumni.
Geiger said the current proposal will not
affect baseball games at Sunken Diamond.
Currently, stadium and diamond policies
are identical. Stanford Stadium holds al
most 86,000 fans, while Sunken Diamond
seats approximately 3,500.
Alcohol is served in the stadium only at
the annual East/West Shrine Game in mid-
January. That game is organized by the
Shriners to support their hospitals for
crippled and burned children. Alcohol was
also served when Stanford hosted Super
Bowl XIX in January 1985.
