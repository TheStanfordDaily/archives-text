# Scandal forces Hart out of race for presidency
## 
### MARK ROGOWSKY Staff writer With wire reports 
Gary Hart, his front-running
campaign crippled by questions
about his personal life, will an
nounce his withdrawal from the
race for the 1988 Democratic pres
idential nomination today, ac
cording to party sources.
The sources, who asked not to
be identified, said Hart campaign
manager Bill Dixon and other
aides were telephoning supporters
of the former Democratic senator
from Colorado with the news of
the decision to withdraw yester
day.
In a statement released by his
staff in Groveton. N.H. Wednes
day. Hart said: "While running for

president is important, right now
my family is more important. . . .
This campaign, and the ideals and
ideas it represents, will continue
and our cause will succeed."
Kathy Bitzer. a spokeswoman
for the campaign, said nothing
was certain and that Hart would
make an announcement at 10
a.m. today at his home.
Stanford junior Mark Lemley,
state student coordinator for the
Hart campaign, expressed "shock,
anger and disappointment" at the
news. Lemley said it was unfor
tunate that a candidate's personal
life is "what stands for issues in
the 1980s." He added that Hart is
one of the "few people 1 consider
tremendously qualified." Lemley
said Hart still had his "unreserved
support."

The demise of the Hart cam
paign began Sunday when the
Miami Herald reported that he
had spent the night at his Wash
ington townhouse with 29-year
old actress/model Donna Rice.
Before word spread of Hart's deci
sion to withdraw from the race,
rumors swept Washington that
news organizations were prepar
ing stories concerning other in
discretions.
Hart has been the prohibitive
front-runner in the early man
euvering for the party's presiden
tial nomination. His withdrawal
creates a political vacuum that the
remaining seven contenders will
rush to fill and may prompt other
Democrats to enter the campaign.
Coit Blacker, a senior research
associate at the International

Strategic Institute at Stanford
and Hart's adviser on national se
curity issues, said the news was
shocking since he had no advance
warning about Hart's decision.
Blacker, who is also a lecturer in
the Political Science Department,
added that it was unfortunate
that candidates can be forced
from the race because of
suspicions concerning their per
sonal life.
Hart and Rice have denied that
she stayed with him or that they
had a sexual relationship. Hart's
wife, Lee, who said Wednesday
that she accepts her husband's
word, joined him in New
Hampshire but did not appear at a
51-minute news conference at
which reporters doggedly ques
tioned Hart about his weekend.

The decision to put the cam
paign on hold came hours after a
town meeting in Littleton, N.H.,
where voters in the nation's first
primary state did not raise any
questions about Hart's personal
life.
Hart then broke off campaign
ing to return home with his wife.
He said nothing as the couple
arrived at the Jefferson County
airport, northwest of Denver.
They went directly to their home
in Troublesome Gulch. Colo.
Aides in Hart's national cam
paign headquarters in downtown
Denver apparently learned the end
was near as early as yesterday
morning. Several were in tears
after an early-morning call from


Gary Hart
Plans to withdraw from race
other staffers with the candidate
in New Hampshire.
Stanford senior Michael Bunzel,
student coordinator in California
for the campaign of Delaware Sen.
Joseph Biden, another Demo
cratic hopeful, said members of
the Biden campaign were sad
dened by the news. Bunzel said it
was "tragic that this had to hap
pen to a fine political leader."
He added that the Biden sup
porters felt particularly sorry for
those who had worked so hard for
the Hart campaign. Bunzel
declined to comment on the possi
ble effects of Hart's withdrawal on
the Biden effort.
Blacker said, however, that he
thought that Hart's decision will
cause Democratic party leaders to

press someone else to enter the
race. Blacker cited three senators
— Edward Kennedy of Massachu
setts, Bill Bradley of New Jersey
and Sam Nunn of Georgia — as
most likely to be drafted to run. He
said he did not think any of the
current candidates would be
helped by Hart's exit.
The candidate's effort to con
front rumors he was a "wom
anizer" only added prominence to
the issue. In an interview that was
published in last Sunday's New
York Times Magazine, Hart defied
reporters to check up on him.
"If anybody wants to put a tail
on me. go ahead. They'd be very
bored," he said.
Hart has said he accepts the
scrutiny that comes with his can
didacy, but contends the Herald's
reporters saw only part of his com
ings and goings over the weekend
and drew the wrong conclusions.

Citing Hart's challenge to the
press. Communication Prof. Jim
Risser called the Miami Herald's
actions "fully justified from a jour
nalistic standpoint.
"I don't think the media over
stepped its role," he said.
However, he did note that he
"might quarrel a little bit with
how well they executed (their sur
veillance)."
Hart's standing in the polls has
plummeted in the past few days as
news of his alleged indiscretions
with Rice has become public. A
poll in New Hampshire shows that
Massachusetts Gov. Michael
Dukakis, who was tied with Hart
there a week ago, has pulled ahead
by 10 percentage points. Another
poll in lowa shows Hart's support
slipping there. The primary
process is kicked off by the lowa
caucuses and is followed one week
later by the New Hampshire pri
mary.

she stayed with him or that they
had a sexual relationship. Hart's
wife, Lee, who said Wednesday
that she accepts her husband's
word, joined him in New
Hampshire but did not appear at a
51-minute news conference at
which reporters doggedly ques
tioned Hart about his weekend.

The decision to put the cam
paign on hold came hours after a
town meeting in Littleton, N.H.,
where voters in the nation's first
primary state did not raise any
questions about Hart's personal
life.
Hart then broke off campaign
ing to return home with his wife.
He said nothing as the couple
arrived at the Jefferson County
airport, northwest of Denver.
They went directly to their home
in Troublesome Gulch. Colo.

for the campaign of Delaware Sen.
Joseph Biden, another Demo
cratic hopeful, said members of
the Biden campaign were sad
dened by the news. Bunzel said it
was "tragic that this had to hap
pen to a fine political leader."
He added that the Biden sup
porters felt particularly sorry for
those who had worked so hard for
the Hart campaign. Bunzel
declined to comment on the possi
ble effects of Hart's withdrawal on
the Biden effort.
Blacker said, however, that he
thought that Hart's decision will
cause Democratic party leaders to

press someone else to enter the
race. Blacker cited three senators
— Edward Kennedy of Massachu
setts, Bill Bradley of New Jersey
and Sam Nunn of Georgia — as
most likely to be drafted to run. He
said he did not think any of the
current candidates would be
helped by Hart's exit.
The candidate's effort to con
front rumors he was a "wom
anizer" only added prominence to
the issue. In an interview that was
published in last Sunday's New
York Times Magazine, Hart defied
reporters to check up on him.
"If anybody wants to put a tail
on me. go ahead. They'd be very
bored," he said.
Hart has said he accepts the
scrutiny that comes with his can
didacy, but contends the Herald's
reporters saw only part of his com
ings and goings over the weekend
and drew the wrong conclusions.

actions "fully justified from a jour

"I don't think the media over
stepped its role," he said.

"might quarrel a little bit with
how well they executed (their sur
veillance)."
Hart's standing in the polls has
plummeted in the past few days as
news of his alleged indiscretions
with Rice has become public. A
poll in New Hampshire shows that
Massachusetts Gov. Michael
Dukakis, who was tied with Hart
there a week ago, has pulled ahead
by 10 percentage points. Another
poll in lowa shows Hart's support
slipping there. The primary
process is kicked off by the lowa
caucuses and is followed one week

Gary Hart, his front-running
campaign crippled by questions
about his personal life, will an
nounce his withdrawal from the
race for the 1988 Democratic pres
idential nomination today, ac
cording to party sources.
The sources, who asked not to
be identified, said Hart campaign
manager Bill Dixon and other
aides were telephoning supporters
of the former Democratic senator
from Colorado with the news of
the decision to withdraw yester
day.
In a statement released by his
staff in Groveton. N.H. Wednes
day. Hart said: "While running for

president is important, right now
my family is more important. . . .
This campaign, and the ideals and
ideas it represents, will continue
and our cause will succeed."
Kathy Bitzer. a spokeswoman
for the campaign, said nothing
was certain and that Hart would
make an announcement at 10
a.m. today at his home.
Stanford junior Mark Lemley,
state student coordinator for the
Hart campaign, expressed "shock,
anger and disappointment" at the
news. Lemley said it was unfor
tunate that a candidate's personal
life is "what stands for issues in
the 1980s." He added that Hart is
one of the "few people 1 consider
tremendously qualified." Lemley
said Hart still had his "unreserved
support."

The demise of the Hart cam
paign began Sunday when the
Miami Herald reported that he
had spent the night at his Wash
ington townhouse with 29-year
old actress/model Donna Rice.
Before word spread of Hart's deci
sion to withdraw from the race,
rumors swept Washington that
news organizations were prepar
ing stories concerning other in
discretions.
Hart has been the prohibitive
front-runner in the early man
euvering for the party's presiden
tial nomination. His withdrawal
creates a political vacuum that the
remaining seven contenders will
rush to fill and may prompt other
Democrats to enter the campaign.
Coit Blacker, a senior research
associate at the International

Strategic Institute at Stanford
and Hart's adviser on national se
curity issues, said the news was
shocking since he had no advance
warning about Hart's decision.
Blacker, who is also a lecturer in
the Political Science Department,
added that it was unfortunate
that candidates can be forced
from the race because of
suspicions concerning their per
sonal life.
Hart and Rice have denied that
she stayed with him or that they
had a sexual relationship. Hart's
