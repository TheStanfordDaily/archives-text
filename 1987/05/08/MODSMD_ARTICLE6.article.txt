# Scandal forces Hart out of race for presidency
## 
### MARK ROGOWSKY Staff writer With wire reports 
Gary Hart, his front-running
campaign crippled by questions
about his personal life, will an
nounce his withdrawal from the
race for the 1988 Democratic pres
idential nomination today, ac
cording to party sources.
The sources, who asked not to
be identified, said Hart campaign
manager Bill Dixon and other
aides were telephoning supporters
of the former Democratic senator
from Colorado with the news of
the decision to withdraw yester
day.
In a statement released by his
staff in Groveton. N.H. Wednes
day. Hart said: "While running for

president is important, right now
my family is more important. . . .
This campaign, and the ideals and
ideas it represents, will continue
and our cause will succeed."
Kathy Bitzer. a spokeswoman
for the campaign, said nothing
was certain and that Hart would
make an announcement at 10
a.m. today at his home.
Stanford junior Mark Lemley,
state student coordinator for the
Hart campaign, expressed "shock,
anger and disappointment" at the
news. Lemley said it was unfor
tunate that a candidate's personal
life is "what stands for issues in
the 1980s." He added that Hart is
one of the "few people 1 consider
tremendously qualified." Lemley
said Hart still had his "unreserved
support."

The demise of the Hart cam
paign began Sunday when the
Miami Herald reported that he
had spent the night at his Wash
ington townhouse with 29-year
old actress/model Donna Rice.
Before word spread of Hart's deci
sion to withdraw from the race,
rumors swept Washington that
news organizations were prepar
ing stories concerning other in
discretions.
Hart has been the prohibitive
front-runner in the early man
euvering for the party's presiden
tial nomination. His withdrawal
creates a political vacuum that the
remaining seven contenders will
rush to fill and may prompt other
Democrats to enter the campaign.
Coit Blacker, a senior research
associate at the International

Strategic Institute at Stanford
and Hart's adviser on national se
curity issues, said the news was
shocking since he had no advance
warning about Hart's decision.
Blacker, who is also a lecturer in
the Political Science Department,
added that it was unfortunate
that candidates can be forced
from the race because of
suspicions concerning their per
sonal life.
Hart and Rice have denied that
she stayed with him or that they
had a sexual relationship. Hart's
wife, Lee, who said Wednesday
that she accepts her husband's
word, joined him in New
Hampshire but did not appear at a
51-minute news conference at
which reporters doggedly ques
tioned Hart about his weekend.

The decision to put the cam
paign on hold came hours after a
town meeting in Littleton, N.H.,
where voters in the nation's first
primary state did not raise any
questions about Hart's personal
life.
Hart then broke off campaign
ing to return home with his wife.
He said nothing as the couple
arrived at the Jefferson County
airport, northwest of Denver.
They went directly to their home
in Troublesome Gulch. Colo.
Aides in Hart's national cam
paign headquarters in downtown
Denver apparently learned the end
was near as early as yesterday
morning. Several were in tears
after an early-morning call from
