Secord formed CIA-like network
WASHINGTON — Retired Maj. Gen. Richard Secord, the chief
middleman in the Iran-contra affair, acknowledged yesterday that
he created a private covert network patterned after CIA operations
at a time when the agency was barred from aiding the Nicaraguan
rebels.
But under a barrage of challenges to his contention that he was
operating strictly out of patriotic duty, he denied that he later
tried to sell his operation to the CIA for profit.
In Secord's third day before Senate and House investigating
committees, Democrats expressed outrage that the Reagan ad
ministration had allowed the retired Air Force major general, now
a private arms dealer, to operate the U.S. government's arms sales
to Iran and to circumvent the law prohibiting CIA support for the
contras.
Secord confessed that he aspired to be appointed as the CLA's
chief of covert operations. And he admitted under questioning by
Arthur Liman, chief counsel of the Senate select committee, that,
with the encouragement of top White House officials, he had
created a covert operation with all of the earmarks of the U.S. in
telligence agency — secret accounts, employees using code names,
classified communications equipment and profits generated by
the sale of U.S. goods.
But he denied a suggestion by Rep. Louis Stokes, D-Ohio, that
he had created a shadow version of the CIA simply to circumvent
the Boland Amendment, which during most of 1985 and 1986
prohibited the CIA from aiding the contras.
His attorney. Thomas Green, resisted efforts by Sen. Warren
Rudman, R-N.H., to get Secord to pledge that he would return
whatever sum is left after paying the bills to the U.S. Treasury.
Rudman said the committee had estimated that those expenses
would total less than *500,000, leaving more than *7 million in
the account.
Botha takes victory as mandate
JOHANNESBURG, South Africa — President Pieter Botha yes
terday described the victory of his National Party in South Africa's
whites-only parliamentary elections this week as an overwhelming
mandate to make security the government's primary objective in
the wake of nearly three years of civil unrest.
The country's white voters had "given the government a very
clear mandate on the question of security," Botha said, implying
that white fears aroused by months of political violence and by
Nationalist warnings of a communist-led revolution had been
decisive in the party's victory and the white electorate's broad
shift to the right.
Botha, who declared a national state of emergency last June to
quell the unrest and gave the police what amounted to virtual
martial-law powers, warned of a further governmental crackdown
on anti-apartheid groups In the near future.
But Botha, apparently concerned by the election gains of the
far-right Conservative Party, put his main emphasis on security
concerns and was vague about Nationalist plans for reform, al
though these were the original reason for the election. He added
that the election results constitute a firm rejection by white South
Africans of international pressure to replace apartheid with a poli
tical system based on majority rule.
The size of the Nationalist victory and of the increased support
for the Conservative Party aroused grave concern, however,
among leading anti-apartheid campaigners, who interpreted the
election results as a further polarization of the country and pos
sibly a serious step toward a racial civil war.
Budget links defense to taxes
WASHINGTON — In a direct challenge to President Reagan, the
Democratic-controlled Senate tentatively approved a budget
resolution yesterday that promises more money for defense only if
Reagan accepts higher taxes.
The spending plan by Senate Budget Committee Chairman
Lawton Chiles, D-Fla., which passed 57-42 in an Initial vote, calls
for *18 billion in tax increases from sources other than higher
rates for individuals or corporations. That would likely mean a
hike in the federal gasoline tax or in levies on cigarettes and alco
hol.
A final vote on the measure, expected to mirror the initial tally,
was expected late yesterday.
With final passage, the Senate resolution will go to a conference
session Tuesday with the House, which adopted a spending plan
with lower outlays for defense, and more money for education and
job training. Both chambers share the same tax target of *18 bil
lion in new revenues.
The compromise budget resolution that emerges will set limits
for broad categories of government spending during the 1988 fis
cal year, beginning Oct. 1. The specific allocations for individual
programs will be established later by congressional appropria
tions committees. The tax measures, too, must be adopted sepa
rately by Congress, and are subject to a presidential veto.
The budget resolution approved yesterday cohtains total spend
ing of * 1.1 trillion and a deficit of * 134 billion.
Plot to murder Ortega uncovered
TULSA, Okla. — Two Oklahoma men have been charged with
plotting to murder Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega by recruit
ing several former military officials for an attack to be launched
from Honduras, according to federal indictments unsealed yester
day.
FBI agents early yesterday arrested John Norris, 30, a self
described multimillionaire from Purcell, Okla., who told inves
tigators he had attended "survivalist" schools. Donnell Howard.
35. a Vietnam veteran and former private investigator from Mays
ville, Okla.. was arrested later in the day in Oakland.
Norris spoke to Rep. Philip Crane, R-Ill., last December about
his plan to travel to Honduras with military equipment and asked
Crane to give him the name of "contacts" in Honduras, the indict
ment said. Norris also sought advice from Crane's office on ob
taining "supplies for covert operations and long-range patrols."
Crane cooperated with the Federal Bureau of Investigation and
was unaware of the purpose of Norris' mission. U.S. Attorney Layn
Phillips said yesterday from Tulsa.
Crane said yesterday that he called Norris Dec. 23. after Norris
had repeatedly called his office, because Norris said he had been a
student at a private school where Crane was headmaster in the
late 1960s.
China, India near conflict
BEIJING — China and India, with two of the world's largest
armies, are nearlng a military confrontation in their decades-old
border dispute in the Himalayas.

spokesman for the Chinese Foreign Ministry repeated recent com
plaints that Indian troops had intruded on Chinese territory. This
time the Chinese spokesman added a warning that India should
wlthdrawrmm Its forces immediately if it wishes ease tension
along the border and to avoid "the possible occurrence of an un

foundation." It Issued a statement that said India "has no Inten
tion of seeking a conflict with China."

populous countries could affect other countries in Asia. India has
defense ties with the Soviet Union and Vietnam, while China has
a close relationship with Pakistan.
