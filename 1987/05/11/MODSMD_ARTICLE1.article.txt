# 558 edges Storey in housing lottery
## 
### TOM OSCHERWITZ Staff writer 
The Draw is truly an event with
traditions.
According to Round One results
released today. Toyon and Roble
continued their tenure as the
most popular campus dorms, the
Row houses again battled for the
lowest cutoff number and several
co-ops, such as Kairos and
Synergy, again failed to attract
residents.
The biggest surprise of the
Draw was the Suites' rise in
popularity, said Rodger Whitney,
assistant dean of Student Affairs
and director of the Housing Cen
ter. Last year, the cutoff for four
and six-person Suites hovered
around 3,000 after the end of
Round One. This year, the suites
were filled by the middle numbers
of the guaranteed assignment
pool.
In an upset victory, 558
Mayfield — with a cutoff of 241 for
men and 159 for women —
dethroned Storey House from its
traditional position as the most
popular residence on campus. The
cutoff for Storey was 366 for men
and 480 for women.
Roble had the lowest average
cutoff number of the large dorms.
The cutoff for men was 534 and
556 for women. Toyon had a
cutoff of 392 for men, but over
1,000 for women.
Whitney said it will be a little
harder for unguaranteed students
to get housing this year because
the Draw pool increased by 150
students and the number of
available spaces did not change.
The percentage of students who
entered the draw and received a
Round One assignment declined
from 74 to 70 percent, according
to Whitney.
Whitney attributed the in
creased Draw pool to the un
usually large size of this year's
freshmen and junior classes.
While there are more people
competing for campus housing,
co-ops and theme houses have 77
vacancies, the highest total in
recent years. According to Whit
ney, if a co-op or theme house
does not fill 90 percent of its as
signable spaces by the end of
Round Two and historically has
had difficulties in attracting stu
dents. the Housing Center will ter
minate the program and integrate
the residence into the general
housing draw.
Whitney said he was most
"concerned" about the number of
unfilled spaces at Synergy. Out of
33 spaces available in Synergy,
only 13 have been filled, Whitney
said.
While co-ops and theme houses
are restricted to students with
priorities in Round One, those
who selected the house as a choice
will also be eligible to enter the
house by Round Two, Whitney
said.
Priorities that were not ob
tained for residences listed by stu
dents on their draw cards can still
be earned betweeen Rounds One
and Two, Whitney added.
Students have three options
after Round One, Whitney said. By

Thursday, they can accept the
housing assignment, decline it or
do nothing and enter Round Two,
Whitney explained.
Draw numbers ranged from 2 to
4,998 according to Val Crltes, stu
dent Draw coordinator. The
housing draw staff picked 2 on be
half of Frank Beadle, a sophomore
studying overseas in Italy.
Crites said they earned Beadle a
second year in the Italian House.
According to Whitney, cutoff
numbers will rise substantially by
Round Two because fraternities
and resident assistant positions
will remove 300 students from the
draw.
Summer waiting list openings
will depend on the size of the in
coming freshman class, Whitney
said. The housing center reserves
1,590 spaces for freshmen and
any unused spaces are given to
upperclassmen. In recent years,
the class has been larger than ex
pected, leaving fewer housing
spaces for upperclassmen, Whit
ney said.
The Housing Center will an
nounce the results of Round II
May 26.
