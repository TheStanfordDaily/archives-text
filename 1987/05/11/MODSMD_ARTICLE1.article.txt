The Draw is truly an event with
traditions.
According to Round One results
released today. Toyon and Roble
continued their tenure as the
most popular campus dorms, the
Row houses again battled for the
lowest cutoff number and several
co-ops, such as Kairos and
Synergy, again failed to attract
residents.
The biggest surprise of the
Draw was the Suites' rise in
popularity, said Rodger Whitney,
assistant dean of Student Affairs
and director of the Housing Cen

Roble had the lowest average
cutoff number of the large dorms.
The cutoff for men was 534 and
556 for women. Toyon had a
cutoff of 392 for men, but over

the Draw pool increased by 150
students and the number of
available spaces did not change.
The percentage of students who
entered the draw and received a
Round One assignment declined
from 74 to 70 percent, according
to Whitney.
Whitney attributed the in
creased Draw pool to the un
usually large size of this year's
freshmen and junior classes.
While there are more people
competing for campus housing,
co-ops and theme houses have 77
vacancies, the highest total in
recent years. According to Whit
