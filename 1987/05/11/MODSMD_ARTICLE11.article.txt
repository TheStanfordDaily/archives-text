# Tempers riled by unsigned fliers

### MARK ROGOWSKY Staff writer 
A series of fliers publicizing a forum
on affirmative action angered members
of the Stanford community this
weekend.
The publicity was put out by a Stan
ford Workshop on Political and Social Is
sues (SWOPSI) group in charge of the
forum to be held In Cubberley
Auditorium Wednesday night.
The fliers were distributed in the
dining rooms of Wilbur, Florence Moore
and Stern Halls beginning on Friday
night and contained brief statements on
affirmative action that were designed to
provoke thought and discussion on the
issue, according to Subodh Chandra, a
member of the SWOPSI group in charge
of the forum.
Trouble resulted because the fliers
were unsigned and the first ones distrib
uted contained messages opposed to af
firmative action. These initial fliers con
tained such statements as "the only
blacks, Hispanics and American Indians

admitted to institutions of higher edu
cation are admitted through affirmative
action."
Chandra admitted. In hindsight, that
some of the statements were "unreas
onable" and "extremist."
Among those most angered by the
publicity were the residents of Casa
Zapata, an ethnic theme house located
in Stern Hall. According to Resident Fel
low Jose Burciaga, the house has been
victimized by racist Incidents recently
which caused residents to assume the
fliers were another case of racism.
When Cecilia Burciaga, also a Zapata
RF, discovered the fliers yesterday morn
ing she notified the police and Residen
tial Education. She also spoke with
Chandra, who was Identified by a
Zapata resident as one of those respon
sible for passing out the fliers.
After Burciaga spoke to Chandra they
were able to straighten out the misun
derstanding, according to Chandra,
An apologetic Chandra said, "It was a
mistake in judgment on our (the
SWOPSI group's) part."

He said the group tried "to word them
(the statements) so that they would
promote discussion." but he acknowl
edged that they could easily be con
strued in another way.
Jose Burciaga said. "The people who
did it. did it with good intentions, but
they didn't use common sense."
The SWOPSI group has attempted to
rectify the matter by printing an expla
nation on the latest set of fliers, which
includes an apology and encourages stu
dents to think about affirmative action
and to attend the forum.
In addition to SWOPSI. the forum is
being sponsored by various ethnic
groups on campus, the Stanford Demo
crats, the Stanford College Republicans
and the Greek community. The organi
zers hope to have experts speak both for
and against affirmative action and then
have members of the sponsoring groups
express their personal feelings on the
issue. After that, they hope to break the
audience into small groups to talk about
what the speakers have said and about
their personal views regarding ethnic re
lations on campus. Chandra said.
