## THE 						STANFORD DAILY An Independent Newspaper Consider divesting 
### 
In the ASSU elections almost one month
ago. students supported a referendum call
ing on the University Board of Trustees to
vote on a proposal for total divestment. The
trustees meet tomorrow, and It Is about time
the board stops giving mere lip service to di
vestment and finally and unequivocally takes
a stand on the matter.
The referendum, proposed by Stanford
Out of South Africa (SOSA), passed by a mar
gin of 1,942 votes. Last year, students sup
ported total divestment by a two-to-one mar
gin.
According to the sponsors statement in the
ASSU elections handbook, the referendum
asked the trustees "to discuss and vote on
total divestment. Although there have been
repeated shows of student support for total
divestment for more than 10 years, the trus

tees have never taken a public vote on total
divestment.
The referendum does not demand that the
trustees support total divestment. It simply
requests that they vote on the matter.
The trustees have the final say in a wide
spectrum of issues that affect the University.
Divestment is an important issue and one
that has generated a good deal of student
and faculty support. That the board has
never even taken a definite public stand on
total divestment is inexcusable: It is certain
that the trustees would make clear their sup
port or disapproval of a major fund-rasing
campaign or construction project.
Regardless of whether the board supports
total divestment, it should make its stand a
matter of public record. The trustees should
value student concerns enough to consider
the SOSA proposal.
