Letter was
unfair to the
Trancos RAs
In response to Greg Kennedy's
letter regarding Trancos and the
Sigma Chis (Daily. May 5), I
would like to offer a few points of
clarification. But, in doing so I
run the risk of assigning impor
tance to the issue he raises. Let
me make myself perfectly clear.
Kennedy's opinions and con
cerns about the Sigma Chis are
completely insignificant to me.
However, the facts he uses to
express those opinions are false
and the ramifications of the state
ments he made affect me in a very
personal wav.
My role as resident assistant is
the most important commitment
that I have made in my senior
year. The responsibility to look
after the well-being of the resi
dents in Trancos is one which I
do not take lightly. Kennedy has
gone on the record with several
incorrect statements about our
resident fellows and RAs. In doing
so, he has negatively influenced
the dorm's perception of our staff
and therefore, has interfered with
my ability to carry out my respon
sibilities.
Here are a few of the quotes
from his letter:
□ "Tom Bauman and Martha

Feldman (the Trancos RFs) were
attempting to convince their
freshmen not to accept their bids
. . . [by circulating]... a personal
letter . . . stating why Trancos
residents should not join a frater
nity."
□ "The RFs instructed the RAs to
convince the freshmen not to
accept their bids."
□ "For three hours, the RAs pres
sured three future Sigma Chis to
not join our house."
I don't want to belabor the
issue with additional incorrect
statements made in the letter.
Here are the real facts.
First, Tom and Martha's letter
was not meant to convince fresh
men to turn down their bids, but
rather to have them think about
all the options available to them.
As RFs their interest in dorm life
is clear and the opinions they put
forth are their own. It would,
however, be wrong to characterize
them as anti-Greek. Of the RAs
they chose last year, three of four,
including myself, are members of
a fraternity or sorority and we
freely express our individual
opinions and experiences within
the dorm.
Second, Tom and Martha don't
"instruct" the RAs on any matter.
In our staff, there is no hierarchy.
The RAs are trusted to use their
best judgment, and the decision
to talk to four people who got bids
in our dorm was initiated and
discussed among the RAs only.

Third, we spoke to two people
for about an hour (the other two
weren't home). We approached
them as concerned friends and
asked them to consider how their
decision would affect their life
style at Stanford and their
relationships with other close
friends who they had drawn with,
and who had tried, but did not
receive bids at the Sigma Chis.
Three of the four we spoke to felt
that our discussion was con
structive and each person under
stood that we acted out of con
cern for their best interests.
The inaccuracy of Kennedy's
letter undermines the dorm's
self-confidence and makes it
difficult for me to do my job as
RA. Kennedy should get his facts
straight before he shoots off his
mouth in a public forum.

Sigma Chi's
actions as bad
as the DU's
Fraternities have been getting a
bad rap on campus lately, but it
may not be unjustified. In his
recent viewpoint (Daily, May 5),
Greg Kennedy is correct in
stating that fraternities
(particularly the Sigma Chis)

have a right to be fairly
represented. People should not
judge fraternities based on
stereotypes, but should base their
views on the actions exhibited by
these groups.
For this reason, I would like to
call attention to an Incident that
occurred on May 6. At 11:15
p.m., three women were walking
on the bike path in front of the
Sigma Chi house when men on
the roof of the house threw beer
bottles that smashed on the
ground a few feet in front of the
women.
As Kennedy states, it is obvious
to see that there are "major dis
similarities" between the Delta
Upsilons and the Sigma Chis.
The DUs threw couches off their
roof and the Sigma Chis only
throw bottles. I think that Tom
Bauman and Martha Feldman
(resident fellows at Trancos)
should accept the Sigma Chi
invitation for a visit so they can
see why the Sigma Chis are
"so proud" of what they have, as
Kennedy said. But, they should
go unexpected, preferably during
a party. A planned visit to the
house with its members ready
and waiting would only give them
a myopic view of the fraternity
and we all know that "future
myopia on their part will only lead
to more close-mindedness."

was not meant to convince fresh
men to turn down their bids, but
rather to have them think about
all the options available to them.
As RFs their interest in dorm life
is clear and the opinions they put
forth are their own. It would,
however, be wrong to characterize
them as anti-Greek. Of the RAs
they chose last year, three of four,
including myself, are members of
a fraternity or sorority and we
freely express our individual
opinions and experiences within
the dorm.
Second, Tom and Martha don't
"instruct" the RAs on any matter.
In our staff, there is no hierarchy.
The RAs are trusted to use their
best judgment, and the decision
to talk to four people who got bids
in our dorm was initiated and
discussed among the RAs only.

Third, we spoke to two people
for about an hour (the other two
weren't home). We approached
them as concerned friends and
asked them to consider how their
decision would affect their life
style at Stanford and their
relationships with other close
friends who they had drawn with,
and who had tried, but did not
receive bids at the Sigma Chis.
Three of the four we spoke to felt
that our discussion was con
structive and each person under
stood that we acted out of con
cern for their best interests.
The inaccuracy of Kennedy's
letter undermines the dorm's
self-confidence and makes it
difficult for me to do my job as
RA. Kennedy should get his facts
straight before he shoots off his
mouth in a public forum.

Sigma Chi's
actions as bad
as the DU's
Fraternities have been getting a
bad rap on campus lately, but it
may not be unjustified. In his
recent viewpoint (Daily, May 5),
Greg Kennedy is correct in
stating that fraternities
(particularly the Sigma Chis)

have a right to be fairly
represented. People should not
judge fraternities based on
stereotypes, but should base their
views on the actions exhibited by
these groups.
For this reason, I would like to
call attention to an Incident that
occurred on May 6. At 11:15
p.m., three women were walking
on the bike path in front of the
Sigma Chi house when men on
the roof of the house threw beer
bottles that smashed on the
ground a few feet in front of the
women.
As Kennedy states, it is obvious
to see that there are "major dis
similarities" between the Delta
Upsilons and the Sigma Chis.
The DUs threw couches off their
roof and the Sigma Chis only
throw bottles. I think that Tom
Bauman and Martha Feldman
(resident fellows at Trancos)
should accept the Sigma Chi
invitation for a visit so they can
see why the Sigma Chis are
"so proud" of what they have, as
Kennedy said. But, they should
go unexpected, preferably during
a party. A planned visit to the
house with its members ready
and waiting would only give them
a myopic view of the fraternity
and we all know that "future
myopia on their part will only lead
to more close-mindedness."
