# Columns that weren't written

### 
With only two columns standing between me
and graduation, my crusade Is coming to an
end. My tour as The Stanford Daily's token en
gineer, token grad student and token fascist Is
almost over. Thousands of topics have com
peted biweekly for the glorious chance to ap
pear In an A 1 Estes column. Here are a few that
didn't make the cut.

Column 1: "After Hours" told how a simple
first date could turn into a night of horror.
"Apocalypse Now" featured a soldier who asked
for a mission after which he never wanted an
other. "The Voyage of the Mobro 4000" is a
similar tale of hell on Earth — except this one
is true.
The journey started as a simple trip from Is
lip. N.Y., to Morehead City, N.C. — the result of
a business deal to transport 3,168 tons of the
country's finest Yankee garbage. The Idea was
to dump the precious cargo In North Carolina
landfills and convert the resulting methane
gas to electricity. Lowell Harrelson, founder of
National Waste Contractors Inc., was paid by a
Long Island company to deliver the trash.
The Mobro 4000, a leased barge, departed
Long Island on March 22. When New York
refused to certify that no harmful or hazardous
materials were present in the garbage. North
Carolina refused to allow disposal. Neither Ala
bama nor Mississippi would accept the
100.000 cubic yards of stench and slime so the
Mobro 4000 headed for Venice, La.,
presumably with the Intent to dump and run.
When the barge tried to enter the Mississippi
River delta on April 16. state police and envi
ronmental officials ordered the vessel back to
sea.
Harrelson's barge tried Mexico next and was
chased away by the Mexican Navy. Too bad. it
would have been a fair fight. Even the tiny
country of Belize alerted defense forces as the
Mobro contemplated landing there. The Ameri
can government has acted irresponsibly and
offered no help In a situation which is a glaring
embarrassment to the United States. The gov
ernment has threatened prosecution If the
waste Is dumped at sea but has thwarted every
other alternative. By pretending to disown the
garbage, the United States Is an accomplice in
this folly. At long last. It appears the garbage

will be vacationing in the Bahamas.
Landfills, especially on the East Coast, are
becoming full. So far, the local, state and
federal governments have done little to avert a
garbage crisis. The first step should be an
incentive-based recycling program. I used to
believe that only people who ate granola and
wore earth shoes recycled their garbage. When
I finally tried separating my Budwelser cans
from my whiskey bottles from my National
Lampoons, I saw how little was left for pure
disposal. Now I believe.
Some communities, such as Palo Alto, are
currently very supportive and pick up
recycleable garbage at the doorstep. Other
communities, such as Menlo Park, offer only
lip service and expect every citizen to bring the
paper, bottles and cans to a central point.
Other cities do nothing. Considering the
simplicity, low cost and effectiveness of recy
cling, governments without programs are
guilty of negligence.
Column 2: Midterms and finals are distaste
ful enough without having to take them on
tiny 6-by-12-inch surfaces that the University
passes off as desks. For #16,000 per year,
Stanford should provide a minimally accep
table testing environment. An open-book exam
in a typical number-crunching class requires
that the textbook, class notes, problem sets, a
calculator and the exam Itself be readily acces
sible. A delicate, contorted balancing and flip
ping act is required — especially In a one-hour
midterm where time is critical. Jugglers on the
pier wonder how we do it. Should we protest?
Nah. students only protest issues that don't ef
fect them personally and over which they have
no control.
Column 3: For the second year In a row, I've
discovered to my dismay that wearing blue
jeans supposedly demonstrates my support for
gay rights. The annual Gay Blue Jeans Day
serves more to alienate fellow students than to
drum up support. While a week devoted to gay
issues Is a good idea. I prefer to choose for
myself whether or not I support it. By the way.
next Friday Is Military Shirt Day. Wearing a
shirt will demonstrate your firm support for
tripling the defense budget.
Column 4: I finally went to see "Hooslers"
last weekend. After reading the columns in
The Daily accusing the movie of being racist. I
expected to encounter at least a shred of
evidence. I found none.
The explanation for not seeing any black
players until the state finals has already been
aptly articulated by other letters to the paper.
In the early 19505. It seems realistic that rural
teams would be predominantly white and

would not encounter any black players until
meeting an urban school In the finals.
The Hickory's struggle through the regular
season, sectionals and regionals featured
pushing, fighting and hacking. The state
championship, however, was the cleanest
game of the entire movie. No black player took
a cheap shot or demonstrated play that was
even remotely unsportsmanlike. They played
on raw talent. The white teams they had played
previously resorted to brawling to compensate
for their lack of ability. During the game, the
opposing team's black and white cheerleaders
laughed and embraced.
Reporters interviewed the coach (Gene Hack
man) about his concerns before the state
finals. He mentioned the massive field house,
the noise of the crowd and the effect of the big
city on his farm-boy players. He did not men
tion the color of the other team, which was also
radically different from anything previously
encountered. Likewise, none of the players
ever mentioned it.
The movie was attempting to relate how an
outnumbered, obscure Indiana high school
defied the odds and won the state basketball
championship. The producers had ample op
portunity to create racial conflict and con
sciously declined. They appeared to take every
precaution to avoid any potential charges of
racism. Still, some Stanford students seem
willing to use the chip on their shoulder to dig
deep enough to find racism in anything.
Column 5: Puppies are among God's
greatest triumphs. They are perhaps the most
loving, playful, grateful creatures on the
planet. Unfortunately, when Rover gets to be
almost a year old, his sex drive becomes un
controllable. Spot accldently mistakes the fam
ily couch or Uncle Marvin's sleeve for a
potential partner. Most owners get embar
rassed and find it necessary to have Fido fixed.
Sadly, Spike goes off to the vet without ever
having a taste of the good life. It seems so un
fair. Where are the animal rights protesters
when you need them?
My solution for owners who really care about
Bowser's well being is a doggie house of pros
titution. For a nominal fee. presumably less
than the vet bill that will follow, Rex could be
treated to life's ultimate pleasure before being
doomed to "it" status for his remaining days. I
have worked out all the legal details, the choice
of suitable partners and tangible benefits to
society of such a service. Unfortunately. I'm
out of space and The Dally hates It when my
columns are too long.
Allen Estes is a graduate student In engineer
ing. His column appears every other Monday.
