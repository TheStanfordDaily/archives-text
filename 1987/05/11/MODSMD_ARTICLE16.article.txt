# Unmask Reagan
## 
### 
Recent letters to The Daily
lamenting the great academic and
historical resource that Stanford
has lost in the Reagan Library
have more of a point than many of
my liberal colleagues might
believe. Reagan, one of the most
popular presidents in modern
American history, will never be
impeached for his role in the Iran
contra scandal. Not even his most
severe critics seriously consider
the possibility. Therefore, it is
likely that Reagan's full complicity
in the subversion of American
democracy will only come to light
after he has completed his term.
Who knows, the Reagan Library
might just contain useful
evidence.

DAVID PARKER

Those who will accuse me of
convicting Reagan before we have
all the facts on the Iran-contra af
fair are, or course, correct. Con
sider, however, the following: It
has been documented that
Reagan personally met with con
tributors to (now convicted)
"Spitz" Channell's National En
dowment for the Preservation of
Liberty, the illegally tax-exempt
operation that sent arms to the
contras during a time that
Congress banned any U.S. aid.
Reagan has admitted this, but
says that he did not know Chan
nell's NEPL was sending arms to
the contras. Yet Reagan has also
admitted that he was aware of
private funding efforts for the con
tras, but did not know that ad
ministration personnel were in
volved.
This stretches the imagination,
to say the least, especially when
those who were implementing the
policy in the field, from former Na
tional Security Adviser John Poin
dexter to Eugene Hassenfus, have
all claimed to have believed they
were obeying the president's
wishes.
As the hearings on the Iran
contra scandal continue, it is ex
pected that the debate will not be

'The end justifies
the means' isn't a
democracy's finest
slogan.

about whether or not the private
funding effort was explicit admin
istration policy (it will become
clear that it was), but whether or
not Reagan's active support of
private contra funding actually
violated the letter of the Boland
Amendment (the Congressional
ban on aid to the contras). That it
violated the spirit of the law seems
obvious, but the legal details are
much more complicated — com
plicated enough that the adminis
tration asked its legal oversight
board (which, as The Daily re
ported, includes Hoover Institu
tion scholars) to provide the ad
ministration with a sufficiently
narrow interpretation of the law
in order to justify private funding.
It is ironic that while Edwin
Meese tours the country arguing
that the Constitution should be
interpreted according to the
original intentions of our Found
ing Fathers, his boss shows such
a blatant disregard for the inten
tions of the legislative branch.
Reagan's professed desire to bring
the wonders of American demo
cracy to the poor, oppressed
people of Nicaragua is not
balanced by a similar respect for
democratic principles at home.
"The end justifies the means" is
not a democracy's finest slogan,
especially when "the means" in
clude disregarding Congress in or
der to arm a band of terrorists
who murder Nicaraguan civilians
(and recently, an American tech
nician).
In losing the Reagan Library,
Stanford may lose its chance to
play a role in the eventual un
masking of the Reagan mystique,
but at least we will also miss the
testimonial dinners to Adolfo
Calero and Ollie North. It's a price
we'll just have to pay.
