After UCLA's loss Saturday to USC brought Stan
ford to the brink of the Pacific 10 Southern Division
crown, the Cardinal shunned any help the Trojans
might have provided yesterday, destroying California
11-4 at Sunken Diamond to earn a berth in the
NCAA Regionals for the seventh straight season.
With a three-game series remaining at home next
weekend against USC, Stanford is 41-16 overall, 18-
9 in conference play. Cal finished its season at 36-25,
12-18 in the Six-Pac.
Junior Lee Plemel, who lasted only three innings
as the starter of Thursday's game in Berkeley,
rebounded to shackle the Bears on just four runs
and eight hits. Plemel walked two and hit one batter
while striking out six in going the distance to raise
his record to 8-5, 4-1 in the Six-Pac.
Plemel kept California off-balance with an assort
ment of off-speed breaking pitches and a fastball that
he spotted well all day. This Lee Plemel was a far cry
from the one that Cal rocked three days earlier at
Evans Diamond.
"The big difference was I didn't feel right on
Thursday, didn't have the good breaking ball and
they were able to sit on fastballs. I had the good
breaking ball today, and good location on the
fastball," Plemel said.
In only two innings was Plemel really in trouble. In
the seventh, a lead-off double by Cal left fielder Rich
Aldrete, a walk to shortstop Jeff Kent and a pitch
that grazed the helmet of third baseman Charlie
Bonney left the bases loaded with one out. Plemel
fanned right fielder Brad DeJardin and then surren
dered a two-run ground-rule double to pinch hitter
Wayne Chai. In the eighth, after consecutive singles

by Todd Mayo, Bart Frets and Aldrete left men at first
and second with nobody out and one run across,
Plemel retired the next three batters on a strikeout
and two groundouts to squelch the threat.
"I went out to talk to him (in each inning). He said
he wanted to finish the ballgame. I said, 'If you want
to finish it, get this guy out,' and he did," Stanford
Coach Mark Marquess said.
The star of the day at the plate was Cardinal left
fielder Ruben Amaro. He was a perfect three for three
on the day with a single, a double, three runs scored
and a three-run home run in the fifth that pushed
Stanford's lead to 11-1.
"It was a fastball up and away. I was trying to stay
calm up there. Sometimes I have the tendency to get
over the top of it and pull it on the ground. I was con
centrating on driving it up the middle or maybe the
opposite way," Amaro said.
Stanford jumped out to an early 4-0 lead in the
first inning with the aid of two Cal errors on the
same play. Amaro and Toi Cook singled, then third
baseman Ed Sprague singled in Amaro, sending
Cook to third. Ron Witmeyer walked to load the
bases.
Designated hitter Eric Cox. replacing the injured
Jeff Saenger. hit a sacrifice fly to deep center. Cook
scored and Sprague advanced to third, but the throw
in from center fielder Mayo was dropped by Kent.
Sprague barreled to the plate and Kent's throw was
there, but catcher Paul Ellison mishandled it, and
Witmeyer, who'd moved to second on the throw,
sprinted to third. He scored on a wild pitch by start
ing pitcher Travis Willis. Four runs, two earned.
Cardinal shortstop David Esquer tripled, and Willis
was gone. Reliever Mike Mathews retired catcher
Doug Robbins, who contributed an RBI-double in
the fifth, to stop the bleeding.
