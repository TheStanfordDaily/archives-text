# Card clinches pennant
## SPORTS 
### ROBERT PORTNOY TOM SENF Staff writers 
After UCLA's loss Saturday to USC brought Stan
ford to the brink of the Pacific 10 Southern Division
crown, the Cardinal shunned any help the Trojans
might have provided yesterday, destroying California
11-4 at Sunken Diamond to earn a berth in the
NCAA Regionals for the seventh straight season.
With a three-game series remaining at home next
weekend against USC, Stanford is 41-16 overall, 18-
9 in conference play. Cal finished its season at 36-25,
12-18 in the Six-Pac.
Junior Lee Plemel, who lasted only three innings
as the starter of Thursday's game in Berkeley,
rebounded to shackle the Bears on just four runs
and eight hits. Plemel walked two and hit one batter
while striking out six in going the distance to raise
his record to 8-5, 4-1 in the Six-Pac.
Plemel kept California off-balance with an assort
ment of off-speed breaking pitches and a fastball that
he spotted well all day. This Lee Plemel was a far cry
from the one that Cal rocked three days earlier at
Evans Diamond.
"The big difference was I didn't feel right on
Thursday, didn't have the good breaking ball and
they were able to sit on fastballs. I had the good
breaking ball today, and good location on the
fastball," Plemel said.
In only two innings was Plemel really in trouble. In
the seventh, a lead-off double by Cal left fielder Rich
Aldrete, a walk to shortstop Jeff Kent and a pitch
that grazed the helmet of third baseman Charlie
Bonney left the bases loaded with one out. Plemel
fanned right fielder Brad DeJardin and then surren
dered a two-run ground-rule double to pinch hitter
Wayne Chai. In the eighth, after consecutive singles

by Todd Mayo, Bart Frets and Aldrete left men at first
and second with nobody out and one run across,
Plemel retired the next three batters on a strikeout
and two groundouts to squelch the threat.
"I went out to talk to him (in each inning). He said
he wanted to finish the ballgame. I said, 'If you want
to finish it, get this guy out,' and he did," Stanford
Coach Mark Marquess said.
The star of the day at the plate was Cardinal left
fielder Ruben Amaro. He was a perfect three for three
on the day with a single, a double, three runs scored
and a three-run home run in the fifth that pushed
Stanford's lead to 11-1.
"It was a fastball up and away. I was trying to stay
calm up there. Sometimes I have the tendency to get
over the top of it and pull it on the ground. I was con
centrating on driving it up the middle or maybe the
opposite way," Amaro said.
Stanford jumped out to an early 4-0 lead in the
first inning with the aid of two Cal errors on the
same play. Amaro and Toi Cook singled, then third
baseman Ed Sprague singled in Amaro, sending
Cook to third. Ron Witmeyer walked to load the
bases.
Designated hitter Eric Cox. replacing the injured
Jeff Saenger. hit a sacrifice fly to deep center. Cook
scored and Sprague advanced to third, but the throw
in from center fielder Mayo was dropped by Kent.
Sprague barreled to the plate and Kent's throw was
there, but catcher Paul Ellison mishandled it, and
Witmeyer, who'd moved to second on the throw,
sprinted to third. He scored on a wild pitch by start
ing pitcher Travis Willis. Four runs, two earned.
Cardinal shortstop David Esquer tripled, and Willis
was gone. Reliever Mike Mathews retired catcher
Doug Robbins, who contributed an RBI-double in
the fifth, to stop the bleeding.

Third baseman Ed Sprague (33) is congratulated by teammates and Coach Mark Marquess (9) after
scoring in the first inning. The Cardinal beat the dirty Golden Bears yesterday to clinch the Pacific 10
Southern Division Championship.
In the Cardinal fourth, center
fielder Cook singled In Amaro,
who led off with a double. First
baseman Witmeyer then crushed
a two-run homer to put the Card
inal up 7-0.
After the two teams had com
pleted nine innings on Saturday
tied at six, the public address an
nouncer at Evans Diamond
relayed a score from Los Angeles.
"UCLA six," he said, then after
pausing for dramatic effect, he
added, "USC seven."
The Bruins' loss put Stanford
just one victory away from the Six-
Pac title, but Mayo's lOth-inning
single plated catcher Anthony
Crudele from second to give the
Bears a 7-6 win and keep the
Cardinal's champagne on Ice for
one more day.
Steve Chitren hit DeJardin with
a pitch to begin the inning.
Crudele then bunted the ball to
Witmeyer, who made just the fifth
error of his Stanford career with a
low throw to second base.
Cal second baseman Daryl Vice
tried to sacrifice as well, but
Chitren made a nice play to cut
down DeJardin at third. It was
only a temporary reprieve for the
Cardinal relief ace, however, as
Mayo drilled one between Paul
Carey and Cook in right-center to
end it.
Neither an extra Inning nor a
Cal win seemed likely early, as
Sprague led a quick assault
against Bears' starter Will Schock.
After being ejected following a
first-inning beaning on Friday,
Sprague came back with a ven
geance, drilling an RBI double in
the first before blasting a tremen
dous two-run homer on top of the
recreation center behind the left
field fence that put the Cardinal
up 3-0.
The Bears got an unearned run

off starter A 1 Osuna in the third,
but Stanford went ahead 5-1 in
the fourth. The Cardinal could
have had more, but with runners
at the corners and one out, Cook
popped up and Amaro was retired
trying to bunt for a hit.
The missed opportunity proved
costly as Fred Corral came on to
hold Stanford to just one un
earned run over the last five in
nings to run his record to an im
pressive 10-0 on the year.
Cal scored three in the fourth
and one in the fifth off Osuna to
tie it, then took the lead on a Vice
single off Rob Wassenaar in the
sixth. Corral took that advantage
into the eighth, but Stanford
knotted the game when — guess
who — Kent booted Sprague's
sharp grounder to score Esquer. It
was Kent's third error of the game.
Friday's battle was an exciting
one for the 1,133 fans at Sunken
Diamond — and the baseball
wasn't too bad either. Stanford's
come-from-behind 7-6 victory was
marred by a bench-clearing brawl
and a beanball war in which no
one was seriously hurt, but easily
could have been.
With two on in the first, Aldrete
crushed a Jack McDowell pitch
well over the right-centerfield
fence and showed his pleasure
with a fist-pumping jog around
the bases that didn't sit too well
with the Cardinal.
According to Sprague, Aldrete's
actions were the initial cause of
the subsequent trouble. "No ques
tion that's what it was," he said.
"He was trying to show us up. He
hit two (Thursday) and we're the
first-place team. I know he was
excited, but he doesn't have to be
doing that stuff."
"There was no real need,"
Amaro said of Aldrete's ex

After being hit in the batting helmet by a pitch from California's Ted Eldredge on Friday, the Cardinal's Ed
Sprague charged the mound and started a bench-clearing brawl. Sprague was ejected from the contest,
but Eldredge was allowed to remain. Sprague, however, got his revenge on Saturday. The sophomore
returned to the series and rocked the Bears for an RBI double and a two-run homer.
überance. "He had already done
his job."
"It's just a game of emotions,"
Aldrete said. "I have no regrets. I
have a lot of friends on that team
(Stanford), but when you get be
tween the lines you forget about
those things."
Aldrete may not have regretted
his actions, but Kent probably
did. On the first pitch to the
Bears' shortstop, McDowell un
leashed a fastball that nailed Kent
in the back.
Cook said that Kent had been
crowding the plate against
McDowell all year and that the
junior right-hander was just
trying to move him back. "Jack let
it be known that guys wouldn't be
able to sit around the plate and get
the hacks they want," he said.

Marquess was not so generous.
"I think Jack threw at the guy," he
said. "I went out and told him I
don't want him doing that, but he
said he was just trying to get in on
the guy." McDowell made a quick
exit after the game.
After McDowell was warned by
the home plate umpire, Cal starter
Ted Eldredge planned the Bears'
retaliation. According to
Marquess and the Cardinal
players, Eldredge told Sprague
from the dugout that he would hit
the Cardinal third baseman in the
head.
When Sprague came to bat with
two outs in the first, Eldredge
kept his promise, bouncing the
first pitch off the sophomore's bat
ting helmet. Sprague immediately
dropped his bat, charged the
mound, wrestled Eldredge to the
ground and the benches emptied.
Only Sprague was kicked out.
"I'm surprised anybody got
ejected," Sprague said. "If

anybody, it should have been both
of us. That's something that hap
pens in baseball. You feel you have
to protect your players, but I'm not
gonna take that."
Marquess was upset that Cal
was not warned about retaliating
after McDowell hit Kent, giving
Eldredge in essence a free shot at
a Cardinal player. "The umpire
should have warned both teams,
and if it happened again, the
pitcher is out and the coach is
out," Marquess said.
Aldrete broke a 5-5 tie with a
solo homer to right in the seventh,
but it lasted exactly one pitch into
the bottom of the seventh, as Cook
rocked Eldredge's first delivery, an
inside fastball, deep to left-center
for his 10th homer of the year.
"He threw it to me the inning
before and I let it go," Cook said.
The next batter, Amaro, jacked
one as well, his blast disappearing
into the trees beyond the fence in
right-center for the game-winner.

into the trees beyond the fence in
right-center for the game-winner.
After UCLA's loss Saturday to USC brought Stan
ford to the brink of the Pacific 10 Southern Division
crown, the Cardinal shunned any help the Trojans
might have provided yesterday, destroying California
11-4 at Sunken Diamond to earn a berth in the
NCAA Regionals for the seventh straight season.
With a three-game series remaining at home next
weekend against USC, Stanford is 41-16 overall, 18-
9 in conference play. Cal finished its season at 36-25,
12-18 in the Six-Pac.
Junior Lee Plemel, who lasted only three innings
as the starter of Thursday's game in Berkeley,
rebounded to shackle the Bears on just four runs
and eight hits. Plemel walked two and hit one batter
while striking out six in going the distance to raise
his record to 8-5, 4-1 in the Six-Pac.
Plemel kept California off-balance with an assort
ment of off-speed breaking pitches and a fastball that
he spotted well all day. This Lee Plemel was a far cry
from the one that Cal rocked three days earlier at
Evans Diamond.
"The big difference was I didn't feel right on
Thursday, didn't have the good breaking ball and
they were able to sit on fastballs. I had the good
breaking ball today, and good location on the
fastball," Plemel said.
In only two innings was Plemel really in trouble. In
the seventh, a lead-off double by Cal left fielder Rich
Aldrete, a walk to shortstop Jeff Kent and a pitch
that grazed the helmet of third baseman Charlie
Bonney left the bases loaded with one out. Plemel
fanned right fielder Brad DeJardin and then surren
dered a two-run ground-rule double to pinch hitter
Wayne Chai. In the eighth, after consecutive singles

by Todd Mayo, Bart Frets and Aldrete left men at first
and second with nobody out and one run across,
Plemel retired the next three batters on a strikeout
and two groundouts to squelch the threat.
"I went out to talk to him (in each inning). He said
he wanted to finish the ballgame. I said, 'If you want
to finish it, get this guy out,' and he did," Stanford
Coach Mark Marquess said.
The star of the day at the plate was Cardinal left
fielder Ruben Amaro. He was a perfect three for three
on the day with a single, a double, three runs scored
and a three-run home run in the fifth that pushed
Stanford's lead to 11-1.
"It was a fastball up and away. I was trying to stay
calm up there. Sometimes I have the tendency to get
over the top of it and pull it on the ground. I was con
centrating on driving it up the middle or maybe the
opposite way," Amaro said.
Stanford jumped out to an early 4-0 lead in the
first inning with the aid of two Cal errors on the
same play. Amaro and Toi Cook singled, then third
baseman Ed Sprague singled in Amaro, sending
Cook to third. Ron Witmeyer walked to load the
bases.
Designated hitter Eric Cox. replacing the injured
Jeff Saenger. hit a sacrifice fly to deep center. Cook
scored and Sprague advanced to third, but the throw
in from center fielder Mayo was dropped by Kent.
Sprague barreled to the plate and Kent's throw was
there, but catcher Paul Ellison mishandled it, and
Witmeyer, who'd moved to second on the throw,
sprinted to third. He scored on a wild pitch by start
ing pitcher Travis Willis. Four runs, two earned.
Cardinal shortstop David Esquer tripled, and Willis
was gone. Reliever Mike Mathews retired catcher
Doug Robbins, who contributed an RBI-double in
the fifth, to stop the bleeding.

Third baseman Ed Sprague (33) is congratulated by teammates and Coach Mark Marquess (9) after
scoring in the first inning. The Cardinal beat the dirty Golden Bears yesterday to clinch the Pacific 10
Southern Division Championship.
In the Cardinal fourth, center
fielder Cook singled In Amaro,
who led off with a double. First
baseman Witmeyer then crushed
a two-run homer to put the Card
inal up 7-0.
After the two teams had com
pleted nine innings on Saturday
tied at six, the public address an
nouncer at Evans Diamond
relayed a score from Los Angeles.
"UCLA six," he said, then after
pausing for dramatic effect, he
added, "USC seven."
The Bruins' loss put Stanford
just one victory away from the Six-
Pac title, but Mayo's lOth-inning
single plated catcher Anthony
Crudele from second to give the
Bears a 7-6 win and keep the
Cardinal's champagne on Ice for
one more day.
Steve Chitren hit DeJardin with
a pitch to begin the inning.
Crudele then bunted the ball to
Witmeyer, who made just the fifth
error of his Stanford career with a
low throw to second base.
Cal second baseman Daryl Vice
tried to sacrifice as well, but
Chitren made a nice play to cut
down DeJardin at third. It was
only a temporary reprieve for the
Cardinal relief ace, however, as
Mayo drilled one between Paul
Carey and Cook in right-center to
end it.
Neither an extra Inning nor a
Cal win seemed likely early, as
Sprague led a quick assault
against Bears' starter Will Schock.
After being ejected following a
first-inning beaning on Friday,
Sprague came back with a ven
geance, drilling an RBI double in
the first before blasting a tremen
dous two-run homer on top of the
recreation center behind the left
field fence that put the Cardinal
up 3-0.
The Bears got an unearned run

off starter A 1 Osuna in the third,
but Stanford went ahead 5-1 in
the fourth. The Cardinal could
have had more, but with runners
at the corners and one out, Cook
popped up and Amaro was retired
trying to bunt for a hit.
The missed opportunity proved
costly as Fred Corral came on to
hold Stanford to just one un
earned run over the last five in
nings to run his record to an im
pressive 10-0 on the year.
Cal scored three in the fourth
and one in the fifth off Osuna to
tie it, then took the lead on a Vice
single off Rob Wassenaar in the
sixth. Corral took that advantage
into the eighth, but Stanford
knotted the game when — guess
who — Kent booted Sprague's
sharp grounder to score Esquer. It
was Kent's third error of the game.
Friday's battle was an exciting
one for the 1,133 fans at Sunken
Diamond — and the baseball
wasn't too bad either. Stanford's
come-from-behind 7-6 victory was
marred by a bench-clearing brawl
and a beanball war in which no
one was seriously hurt, but easily
could have been.
With two on in the first, Aldrete
crushed a Jack McDowell pitch
well over the right-centerfield
fence and showed his pleasure
with a fist-pumping jog around
the bases that didn't sit too well
with the Cardinal.
According to Sprague, Aldrete's
actions were the initial cause of
the subsequent trouble. "No ques
tion that's what it was," he said.
"He was trying to show us up. He
hit two (Thursday) and we're the
first-place team. I know he was
excited, but he doesn't have to be
doing that stuff."
"There was no real need,"
Amaro said of Aldrete's ex

After being hit in the batting helmet by a pitch from California's Ted Eldredge on Friday, the Cardinal's Ed
Sprague charged the mound and started a bench-clearing brawl. Sprague was ejected from the contest,
but Eldredge was allowed to remain. Sprague, however, got his revenge on Saturday. The sophomore
returned to the series and rocked the Bears for an RBI double and a two-run homer.
überance. "He had already done
his job."
"It's just a game of emotions,"
Aldrete said. "I have no regrets. I
have a lot of friends on that team
(Stanford), but when you get be
tween the lines you forget about
those things."
Aldrete may not have regretted
his actions, but Kent probably
did. On the first pitch to the
Bears' shortstop, McDowell un
leashed a fastball that nailed Kent
in the back.
Cook said that Kent had been
crowding the plate against
McDowell all year and that the
junior right-hander was just
trying to move him back. "Jack let
it be known that guys wouldn't be
able to sit around the plate and get
the hacks they want," he said.

Marquess was not so generous.
"I think Jack threw at the guy," he
said. "I went out and told him I
don't want him doing that, but he
said he was just trying to get in on
the guy." McDowell made a quick
exit after the game.
After McDowell was warned by
the home plate umpire, Cal starter
Ted Eldredge planned the Bears'
retaliation. According to
Marquess and the Cardinal
players, Eldredge told Sprague
from the dugout that he would hit
the Cardinal third baseman in the
head.
When Sprague came to bat with
two outs in the first, Eldredge
kept his promise, bouncing the
first pitch off the sophomore's bat
ting helmet. Sprague immediately
dropped his bat, charged the
mound, wrestled Eldredge to the
ground and the benches emptied.
Only Sprague was kicked out.
"I'm surprised anybody got
ejected," Sprague said. "If

anybody, it should have been both
of us. That's something that hap
pens in baseball. You feel you have
to protect your players, but I'm not
gonna take that."
Marquess was upset that Cal
was not warned about retaliating
after McDowell hit Kent, giving
Eldredge in essence a free shot at
a Cardinal player. "The umpire
should have warned both teams,
and if it happened again, the
pitcher is out and the coach is
out," Marquess said.
Aldrete broke a 5-5 tie with a
solo homer to right in the seventh,
but it lasted exactly one pitch into
the bottom of the seventh, as Cook
rocked Eldredge's first delivery, an
inside fastball, deep to left-center
for his 10th homer of the year.
"He threw it to me the inning
before and I let it go," Cook said.
The next batter, Amaro, jacked
one as well, his blast disappearing

right-center for the game-winner.

one as well, his blast disappearing
into the trees beyond the fence in
right-center for the game-winner.
After UCLA's loss Saturday to USC brought Stan
ford to the brink of the Pacific 10 Southern Division
crown, the Cardinal shunned any help the Trojans
might have provided yesterday, destroying California
11-4 at Sunken Diamond to earn a berth in the
NCAA Regionals for the seventh straight season.
With a three-game series remaining at home next
weekend against USC, Stanford is 41-16 overall, 18-
9 in conference play. Cal finished its season at 36-25,
12-18 in the Six-Pac.
Junior Lee Plemel, who lasted only three innings
as the starter of Thursday's game in Berkeley,
rebounded to shackle the Bears on just four runs
and eight hits. Plemel walked two and hit one batter
while striking out six in going the distance to raise
his record to 8-5, 4-1 in the Six-Pac.
Plemel kept California off-balance with an assort
ment of off-speed breaking pitches and a fastball that
he spotted well all day. This Lee Plemel was a far cry
from the one that Cal rocked three days earlier at
Evans Diamond.
"The big difference was I didn't feel right on
Thursday, didn't have the good breaking ball and
they were able to sit on fastballs. I had the good
breaking ball today, and good location on the
fastball," Plemel said.
In only two innings was Plemel really in trouble. In
the seventh, a lead-off double by Cal left fielder Rich
Aldrete, a walk to shortstop Jeff Kent and a pitch
that grazed the helmet of third baseman Charlie
Bonney left the bases loaded with one out. Plemel
fanned right fielder Brad DeJardin and then surren
dered a two-run ground-rule double to pinch hitter
Wayne Chai. In the eighth, after consecutive singles

by Todd Mayo, Bart Frets and Aldrete left men at first
and second with nobody out and one run across,
Plemel retired the next three batters on a strikeout
and two groundouts to squelch the threat.
"I went out to talk to him (in each inning). He said
he wanted to finish the ballgame. I said, 'If you want
to finish it, get this guy out,' and he did," Stanford
Coach Mark Marquess said.
The star of the day at the plate was Cardinal left
fielder Ruben Amaro. He was a perfect three for three
on the day with a single, a double, three runs scored
and a three-run home run in the fifth that pushed
Stanford's lead to 11-1.
"It was a fastball up and away. I was trying to stay
calm up there. Sometimes I have the tendency to get
over the top of it and pull it on the ground. I was con
centrating on driving it up the middle or maybe the
opposite way," Amaro said.
Stanford jumped out to an early 4-0 lead in the
first inning with the aid of two Cal errors on the
same play. Amaro and Toi Cook singled, then third
baseman Ed Sprague singled in Amaro, sending
Cook to third. Ron Witmeyer walked to load the
bases.
Designated hitter Eric Cox. replacing the injured
Jeff Saenger. hit a sacrifice fly to deep center. Cook
scored and Sprague advanced to third, but the throw
in from center fielder Mayo was dropped by Kent.
Sprague barreled to the plate and Kent's throw was
there, but catcher Paul Ellison mishandled it, and
Witmeyer, who'd moved to second on the throw,
sprinted to third. He scored on a wild pitch by start
ing pitcher Travis Willis. Four runs, two earned.
Cardinal shortstop David Esquer tripled, and Willis
was gone. Reliever Mike Mathews retired catcher
Doug Robbins, who contributed an RBI-double in
the fifth, to stop the bleeding.

Third baseman Ed Sprague (33) is congratulated by teammates and Coach Mark Marquess (9) after
scoring in the first inning. The Cardinal beat the dirty Golden Bears yesterday to clinch the Pacific 10
Southern Division Championship.
In the Cardinal fourth, center
fielder Cook singled In Amaro,
who led off with a double. First
baseman Witmeyer then crushed
a two-run homer to put the Card
inal up 7-0.
After the two teams had com
pleted nine innings on Saturday
tied at six, the public address an
nouncer at Evans Diamond
relayed a score from Los Angeles.
"UCLA six," he said, then after
pausing for dramatic effect, he
added, "USC seven."
The Bruins' loss put Stanford
just one victory away from the Six-
Pac title, but Mayo's lOth-inning
single plated catcher Anthony
Crudele from second to give the
Bears a 7-6 win and keep the
Cardinal's champagne on Ice for
one more day.
Steve Chitren hit DeJardin with
a pitch to begin the inning.
Crudele then bunted the ball to
Witmeyer, who made just the fifth
error of his Stanford career with a
low throw to second base.
Cal second baseman Daryl Vice
tried to sacrifice as well, but
Chitren made a nice play to cut
down DeJardin at third. It was
only a temporary reprieve for the
Cardinal relief ace, however, as
Mayo drilled one between Paul
Carey and Cook in right-center to
end it.
Neither an extra Inning nor a
Cal win seemed likely early, as
Sprague led a quick assault
against Bears' starter Will Schock.
After being ejected following a
first-inning beaning on Friday,
Sprague came back with a ven
geance, drilling an RBI double in
the first before blasting a tremen
dous two-run homer on top of the
recreation center behind the left
field fence that put the Cardinal
up 3-0.
The Bears got an unearned run

off starter A 1 Osuna in the third,
but Stanford went ahead 5-1 in
the fourth. The Cardinal could
have had more, but with runners
at the corners and one out, Cook
popped up and Amaro was retired
trying to bunt for a hit.
The missed opportunity proved
costly as Fred Corral came on to
hold Stanford to just one un
earned run over the last five in
nings to run his record to an im
pressive 10-0 on the year.
Cal scored three in the fourth
and one in the fifth off Osuna to
tie it, then took the lead on a Vice
single off Rob Wassenaar in the
sixth. Corral took that advantage
into the eighth, but Stanford
knotted the game when — guess
who — Kent booted Sprague's
sharp grounder to score Esquer. It
was Kent's third error of the game.
Friday's battle was an exciting
one for the 1,133 fans at Sunken
Diamond — and the baseball
wasn't too bad either. Stanford's
come-from-behind 7-6 victory was
marred by a bench-clearing brawl
and a beanball war in which no
one was seriously hurt, but easily
could have been.
With two on in the first, Aldrete
crushed a Jack McDowell pitch
well over the right-centerfield
fence and showed his pleasure
with a fist-pumping jog around
the bases that didn't sit too well
with the Cardinal.
According to Sprague, Aldrete's
actions were the initial cause of
the subsequent trouble. "No ques
tion that's what it was," he said.
"He was trying to show us up. He
hit two (Thursday) and we're the
first-place team. I know he was
excited, but he doesn't have to be
doing that stuff."
"There was no real need,"
Amaro said of Aldrete's ex

After being hit in the batting helmet by a pitch from California's Ted Eldredge on Friday, the Cardinal's Ed
Sprague charged the mound and started a bench-clearing brawl. Sprague was ejected from the contest,
but Eldredge was allowed to remain. Sprague, however, got his revenge on Saturday. The sophomore
returned to the series and rocked the Bears for an RBI double and a two-run homer.
überance. "He had already done
his job."
"It's just a game of emotions,"
Aldrete said. "I have no regrets. I
have a lot of friends on that team
(Stanford), but when you get be
tween the lines you forget about
those things."
Aldrete may not have regretted
his actions, but Kent probably
did. On the first pitch to the
Bears' shortstop, McDowell un
leashed a fastball that nailed Kent
in the back.
Cook said that Kent had been
crowding the plate against
McDowell all year and that the
junior right-hander was just
trying to move him back. "Jack let
it be known that guys wouldn't be
able to sit around the plate and get
the hacks they want," he said.

Marquess was not so generous.
"I think Jack threw at the guy," he
said. "I went out and told him I
don't want him doing that, but he
said he was just trying to get in on
the guy." McDowell made a quick
exit after the game.
After McDowell was warned by
the home plate umpire, Cal starter
Ted Eldredge planned the Bears'
retaliation. According to
Marquess and the Cardinal
players, Eldredge told Sprague
from the dugout that he would hit
the Cardinal third baseman in the
head.
When Sprague came to bat with
two outs in the first, Eldredge
kept his promise, bouncing the
first pitch off the sophomore's bat
ting helmet. Sprague immediately
dropped his bat, charged the
mound, wrestled Eldredge to the
ground and the benches emptied.
Only Sprague was kicked out.
"I'm surprised anybody got
ejected," Sprague said. "If

anybody, it should have been both
of us. That's something that hap
pens in baseball. You feel you have
to protect your players, but I'm not
gonna take that."
Marquess was upset that Cal
was not warned about retaliating
after McDowell hit Kent, giving
Eldredge in essence a free shot at
a Cardinal player. "The umpire
should have warned both teams,
and if it happened again, the
pitcher is out and the coach is
out," Marquess said.
Aldrete broke a 5-5 tie with a
solo homer to right in the seventh,
but it lasted exactly one pitch into
the bottom of the seventh, as Cook
rocked Eldredge's first delivery, an
inside fastball, deep to left-center
for his 10th homer of the year.
"He threw it to me the inning
before and I let it go," Cook said.
The next batter, Amaro, jacked
one as well, his blast disappearing
into the trees beyond the fence in
right-center for the game-winner.
