## Stanford affairs: Married faculty and staff 
### KATHY LACHENAUER Staff writer 
Spring fever causes the birds and bees
to come out and Stanford students to
couple off. But not all Stanford romances
consist of evening strolls around Lake Lag
or eye-gazing over fro yo.
Although most faculty couples rarely
see their spouses on campus, they agree
that their mutual Interest in Stanford en
riches their married life.
For example, Audrey Bernfield, director
of Undergraduate Advising at Stanford,
said that working at the same university
as her husband. Human Biology Prof.
Merton Bernfield, has made her marriage
and job more meaningful.
Married 28 years ago, the Bernfields
were high school sweethearts. They grew
up in Chicago and moved to California in
1967 when Merton Bernfield accepted a
teaching position with Stanford's Human
Biology Department.
Audrey Bernfield started working for
Stanford in 1977 after her husband

brought some graduate students home
for dinner. "I talked about my interests in
career planning with them," Audrey said.
Word about her enthusiasm got back to
the University. She was soon hired as an
adviser.
For three years, both Bernfields worked
in the Human Biology Department. Ac
cording to Audrey Bernfield, "Different
things came together with different
points of view" because Merton Bernfield
taught in the classroom and she worked
with students individually.
Now that Audrey Bernfield heads the
Undergraduate Advising Center, Merton
Bernfield often becomes the adviser for
the pre-meds his wife initially counsels.
Their schedules are equally hectic and
Audrey Bernfield said, "We've learned to
appreciate each other's time commit
ments."
Understanding busy schedules is es
sential to another Stanford marriage as
well. "We almost never see each other
during the day," Physics Prof. Alexander
Fetter said about his wife Jean.

The Fetters met on a ski trip in Austria.
Alexander Fetter Is now chairman of the
Physics Department, and his well-known
wife is Stanford's dean of Undergraduate
Admissions.
Alexander Fetter said their jobs do not
overlap and that they rarely discuss their
work. "Jean bends over backwards not to
discuss applicants." explained her hus
band.
Rather than shared work experiences,
athletics is their common interest. They
are both avid tennis players, and Alexan
der Fetter is a runner as well. The Fetters
escape to England for their summers. Al
exander Fetter said that last vacation they
biked about 50 miles a day through the
countryside.
Unlike the Fetters' meeting in the Alps,
the romance between Denis and Val Phil
lips blossomed right on campus. Her fu
ture husband was a professor at the
School of Education when Val began
working there as the assistant director for
faculty affairs.

According to Val Phillips, Denis first
asked her on a date at a Stanford faculty
party. "We shared a similar sense of
humor and so we went to the movies," she
said.
But she explained that after they were
married seven years ago, it became too
difficult for them to work at the same
school. "We could not work so closely be
cause I had access to all the faculty files,"
Val Phillips said.
She now works as a coordinator for the
Stanford Linear Accelerator, but Val Phil
lips said she makes a real effort to meet
her husband for lunch on campus.
Although they rarely have time for
lunch together, David and Carolyn
Lougee are another visible Stanford
couple. Acquaintances since the seventh
grade, they married after graduating from
college.
The Lougees went on to get their
graduate and doctoral degrees together.
They both concentrated on the 17th and

18th centuries. David's research was in
English and Carolyn's was in history.
"We always thought of teaching at the
same university." said Carolyn Lougee,
associate professor of history and associ
ate dean of Humanities and Sciences. In
1973, she accepted a teaching job with
Stanford's History Department. Three
years later, David Lougee also accepted
one with Stanford's technical communi
cation program.
Carolyn Lougee is especially busy. "I
can't even get an appointment with her,"
her husband said.
According to Carolyn Lougee. the
Lougee's marriage is based on mutual
support. "At different points we've each
been engrossed with our work and it
becomes complimentary over time," she
said.
Carolyn Lougee explained that she
juggled studying and raising their
daughters while David Lougee was teach
ing In Florida. But he boasted, "I do the
cooking now."
