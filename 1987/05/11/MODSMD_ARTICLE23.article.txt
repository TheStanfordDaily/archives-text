# ASSU bartending teaches a marketable skill
## 
### LISA BROOKS 
There are not many instructors
who can say they had to turn
people away from their class 15
minutes before sign-ups began.
But that was the case with Eric
Mathewson's Bartending 101
class, a course that was started up
again this spring after an absence
of two years.
Bartending 101 is an ASSU
sponsored class that was taught
for eight years before the professor
teaching it decided to stop.
Thanks to the efforts of Tony
Sanchez, project manager of Spe
cial Projects for the ASSU, the pro
gram was revived.
"Tony found the room, got the
instructor, did the paperwork and
even helps me set up," said
Mathewson. "All the credit for this
class should go to him."
Fifty students were allowed into
the course. Each student pays
♦ 135 to the ASSU. For this fee,
students learn the basics about
bartending. If students pass their
finals, they will receive a certifi

cate and a recommendation by
Mathewson.
The class includes all aspects of
bartending: general terms, proce
dures for mixed drinks, how
various liquors, beers and wines
are made, how to maintain one's
sanity and other useful informa
tion for future bartenders.
"The fun part is pouring the
drinks," said one student who
asked not to be identified. "But we
only get to use colored water most
of the time. There will be only two
times during the quarter that we
get to use any alcohol at all."
Mathewson spent a large part of
one class discussing types of alco
hol and how it affects people. Stu
dents are made aware of the legal
responsibilities of being a
bartender and learn how to recog
nize when someone is drunk. The
instructor takes this part of the
course seriously — some of his
friends in high school were killed
by a drunk driver.
"The state of California says
that you're not responsible for
someone who drinks in your bar

to excess and kills himself after
ward," Mathewson explained.
"But that doesn't mean your bar
won't get sued, and in any case
you don't want to let a drunk
driver out on the road," he said.
Besides learning the basics
about bartending, students also
receive equipment and a hand
book written by Mathewson. Each
receives a wine opener, pour
spouts and a mesh bag to hold the
equipment.
The handbook contains a list of
different brands of beer, cordials,
gin, bourbon, rum, scotch, te
quila and vodka. A second list of
over 150 mixed drinks with their
ingredients and tips about serving
them is included.
Mathewson estimates that
about 70 percent of the people en
rolled want to use the class to get a
job for the future. Several of the
people agreed with this obser
vation.
Graduating senior Dilys Bart
plans to work next year before
heading off to graduate school. "I

need a marketable skill to earn
some money," she explained.
Sophomore Christopher Illick
also plans to use his newly ac
quired skills to get a job. "I'm
going to go to Boston and will do
this next summer and fall," he
said.
The students seemed to be ap
preciative of both the content of
the class and the instructor him
self.

"He's teaching us useful things
that will be secrets," said sopho
more Jennifer Scotti. "It's really
good that they're having this class
again."
"The most important stuff is the
insider stuff he tells us," said
Bart. "The class as a whole Is a lot
of fun. It's not something you
want to blow off, especially after
paying *135."

Mathewson has roots at Stanford.
His grandfather went here, his
parents met here as students and
his sister was on the Council of
Presidents several years ago.
Mathewson went to UC-

started a business, At Your Ser
vice; his company specializes in
planning and producing parties
for corporations and government
officials.
