How sweet it Is.
The Stanford Cardinal has
clinched the Pacific 10 Southern
Division crown. Convincingly,
and against the Dirty Golden
Bear. Stanford is champion and
there's still a three-game series left
at home next weekend with USC.
It wasn't easy. The cellar
dwelling California Golden Bears
were up for the Big Series, and
each of the first three games of the
set was filled with intensity. Stan
ford could manage victory in only
one of them, Friday at Sunken
Diamond, but it got help Satur
day, as UCLA lost to USC to reduce
the magic number to one and set
the stage for yesterday's title
clincher.
The Cardinal did not waste the
opportunity. It quickly became ap
parent that the high drama that
surrounded the previous three
games would not be a part of this
contest. Cardinal starter Lee
Plemel set the tone by pitching
four perfect innings to start the
game. In the meantime, Stanford
bats rang up four runs in the first,
three in the fourth and four in the
fifth to bury the Bears.
Perhaps Plemel's grit typified
the type of season it has been for
the Cardinal. He spent three in
nings in Berkeley being humbled
by the worst bats in the confer
ence. After only two days rest, he
returned yesterday with his best
stuff, went the distance and
showed why he's been the Card
inal stopper all season.
"It feels great. I wanted to be
there at the end. The first goal was
a shutout, and then when they
scored a run, I just wanted to be
there at the end," Plemel said.
"We wanted to do it this
weekend so we could have an easy
week at practice. It takes the pres
sure off the coaches, too. They
don't have to worry so much about
getting us ready for that one big
win," Plemel said.
It was fitting that Plemel be
there at the end. He has been the
man to pitch Stanford to key wins
all season. In both the UCLA and
Arizona series at home, he came

back after the Cardinal had lost
the opener to pick up an impor
tant victory.
"It was nice to do it (clinch) our
selves. Lee pitched a great game.
He gives us four shutout innings.
He's tough to beat when he gets a
lead," Stanford Coach Mark
Marquess said.
The Cardinal has been tough to
catch all season. Much of the
credit can go to the Cardinal's
number one and two hitters,
Ruben Amaro and Toi Cook,
who've been setting the table for
Ed Sprague, Paul Carey, Doug
Robbins and Jeff Saenger all
season. In typical fashion yester
day, the two led off the first with
back-to-back singles, igniting a
four-run rally that killed the Bears
before they came out of hiberna
tion.
"I'm happy for the younger guys.
They get a taste of it (winning the
title). They'll be able to do this for
a few more years. I'm really happy

we got a chance to do it my senior
year. It's a really good feeling,''
Amaro said.
Sprague, who's been the leading
RBI-man on the team all season,
sums up the attitude of a squad
that has truly defined the words
"team concept" in its march to the
crown.
"We have the type of team where
everybody contributes. I take
some satisfaction from being a
team leader . . . but no more than
anybody else. This (the title) is
what we all shoot for," Sprague
said.
It hasn't been all rosy. The Card
inal, a team favored to win the
conference by many, opened the
Six-Pac season in UCLA and was
shell-shocked in the first two
games, eeking out a victory in the
third.
The work has paid off. A much
needed week of rest awaits the
Cardinal.
