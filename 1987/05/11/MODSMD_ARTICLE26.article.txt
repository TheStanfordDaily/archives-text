# Annual Card/White scrimmage brings spring football to close
## 
### SCOTT ROTH Staff writer 
Saturday's annual Cardinal vs. White
scrimmage, which marks the end of
spring football practice, may have raised
more questions for Stanford Coach Jack
Elway and his staff than it answered.
Because a number of key players went
down early in the spring season, forcing
many young, inexperienced players to
step in, most of the questions concern
the health and depth of the squad for
next season. Although reserve players
were able to gain valuable playing time,
the injuries put an added strain on the
coaches who had hoped to refine skills
and install new plays with the regulars.
"We had no real continuity this
spring," defensive coordinator Dick
Mannini said. "There were just too many
injuries, but I think we'll be fine in the
summer," he added.
This year's scrimmage was conducted
in different fashion than years past. For
the first time, different defensive teams,
dressed in all-red uniforms, scrimmaged
various combinations of offensive
players for a set number of plays, with

the offense trying to score as many times
as possible. At the end of the day, the
final tally was Offense 17, Defense 0.
Considering the players who did not
suit up for the activities, the defense has
to be credited with an outstanding ef
fort. Out of action were linebackers
Barry McKeever and Kurt Colehower, de
fensive end Lester Archambeau and de
fensive backs Rick Theder and Pat Kel
ley. On the offensive side of the ball,
standout tight end Eric Snelson and
lineman Andy Papathanassiou were
sidelined.
Greg Ennis started off at quarterback
and appears the man to beat out for the
the job in the fall. Ennis quickly demon
strated his strength in the short passing
department. On the offense's third pos
session, Ennis continually kept the of
fense moving by drilling quick turn-ins
and delays to senior wide receiver Spen
cer Cotten. The ball-control passing at
tack was complemented by the tough
inside running of fullback Marshall Dil
lard and redshirt tailback Charlie
Young.
Despite Young's sly running and Cot
ten's acrobatic grabs, the drive stalled at

the Red team's 11 yard line when Dlllard
hobbled a third-down shuffle pass and
fell on it short of the first. The White
team opted to try a field goal, and the
200 parents and onlookers present suf
fered an ugly case of deja vu when David
Sweeney's 28-yard attempt was rejected
by junior linebacker Darron Bennett's
outstretched body.
The drive, although covering 69 yards,
was characteristic of the day the offense
had. Ennis was consistently pressured
from the right side by defensive end
Sean Scheller and linebacker Bruce
Lang and therefore put up several in
completions and bad laterals. Ennis,
however, had some valid excuses.
The offense played the whole
scrimmage in a formation that Elway
usually pulls out of the back of the
playbook for special occasions. The
formation consisted of three wideouts,
two backs and no tight ends. This set
was used because there are no healthy
tight ends in camp. Snelson is out with
a pulled muscle and Jim Price is hurling
fastballs for Mark Marquess and the

Cardinal baseball team. As a
result, Ennls had the defense
spread out, but didn't have the
protection to drop back and wait.
To compound the problem, the
Cardinal's biggest weapon, tall
back Brad Muster, did not play.

Magazine. Muster was named to
Playboy's preseason All-America
team this week.
After the game, just about every
one was cautiously optimistic. "I
felt we had a good spring," Elway
told his team after the scrimmage.
"The offense is behind the
defense, but that Is normal," he
said.
On the day, Dillard, who is ex
pected to be a perfect complement
to Muster, had 9 carries for 23
yards. Volpe was 7 for 10 with one
touchdown. Jeff James snagged
four passes for 80 yards and Cot
ten grabbed 5 for a total of 47
yards.

"1 think a lot of good things
came out of spring," Ennls said.
"Everyone Improved In my
opinion. We had a lot of Injuries,
but that's not an excuse. We
haven't been playing as well as we
could have." he added.
Mannini was more reserved in
his comments. "I think we got
what we expected. We weren't
surprised by too much.
Defensively, we're going to have to
work extra hard. Last year, we had
a lot of experience and ran only a
few sets so we became very good at
what we did. Now, we do a lot
more on defense, so It will take
longer to get proficient." he said.
During the spring, Mannini also
experimented with a "46" type
defense reminiscent of the
Chicago Bears. "It's not part of our
defense yet. We just ran It to give
the offense a look. I don't think
you'll see us use It in a game," he
said with a wry smile, as if he
wanted it to be kept a secret.
The Cardinal will resume
practice the third week of August
and open Its 1987 campaign on
the road Sept. 5 In Seattle against
the Washington Huskies.
