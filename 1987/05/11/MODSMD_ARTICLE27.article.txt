# Bernhagen injured at Modesto Relays
## 
### ERIK STEN Editorial staff 
It was a weekend of mixed
emotions for Stanford track.
Competing in Saturday's
Modesto Relays, the Cardinal
had simply hoped to qualify
more athletes for the Pacific 10
Conference championships,
which will be held two weeks
from now in Corvallis, Ore.,
and in the process give the
team another chance to per
form.
That was exactly what hap
pened. The only hitch was that
Stanford's Lisa Bernhagen, the
nation's top high jumper,
injured her take-off foot in
warm-up and will now be on
crutches for at least 10 days.
The junior will definitely sit out
the upcoming conference meet
and at this point is question
able for the NCAA champion
ships. in which she was ex
pected to be one of the Card
inal's top scorers.
"1 just went up and some
thing rolled inside. It took a
weird turn." Bernhagen said.
For now the coaches and doc
tors are taking it slow. The key
Is that Bernhagen. the national
college indoor record holder at
6-foot-5 and 1/4. doesn't come

back too soon. At this point, It's
too early to know exactly when
that we'll be.
"We've got to make sure that
her take-off foot Is back 100
percent before she jumps
again," Stanford Asst. Coach
Dave Wollman said. "If that's
NCAAs, great. Right now we
have to think long term."
For Bernhagen's part, the
junior is taking it well. "That's
about all I can do," she said. "I
just hope that 1 can make it
back for NCAAs and senior na
tionals. Those (meets) are what
I've really been training for."
Better news for the Cardinal
came from John Gash, Glenn
Schneider and Steve Schadler.
Gash, the school record holder
In the pole vault, won his event
at Modesto with a jump of 17-0.
Schneider turned in the best
performance of his career in
the discus, capping the day
with a lifetime best of 189-9,
and Schadler placed fourth in
the 1,500 with a time of
3:47.25, a mark that qualifies
the junior for Pac-lOs.
For Schadler. the qualifying
time was as much a relief as
anything else. After qualifying
the last two years, Schadler was
just waiting to break through.
"I've been training really well."
he said. "I've just been waiting for
It to show on the track. I think the
big difference was that I felt
relaxed on the last lap. I really
finished up strong."
In the discus, the only disap
pointment for Schneider was that
his personal record throw came
up just three inches short of the
NCAA standard.
"That (189-9) has got to be one
of the best throws in the country
for a sophomore," Wollman said.
Other notable performances on
the day: Charles Alexander placed
third in the men's 3.000. a rarely
Contested event, with a strong
time of 8:09.1. Freshman Peter
Kolotoros bettered a personal
record in the high hurdles with a
clocking of 14.41 and long
jumpers Tess Adams and Vanessa
Henlon turned in an impressive
double with marks of 18-10 and
18-2 respectively.
