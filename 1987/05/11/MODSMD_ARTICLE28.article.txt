# Men come up short in crew's Big Row
## 
### DON HOGUE 
Saturday at Redwood Shores
Lagoon, the California men's var
sity crew held off a late Stanford
surge to claim its 15th con
secutive Big Row victory by two
and-one-half seconds.
Stanford's varsity women
avenged the men's defeat by
clearly dominating the Bears en
route to winning by more than a
boat length. Exploding off the
start, the women held a five
second lead at the halfway mark.
With the exception of the
women's varsity and the men's
frosh, Cal dominated the 1987 Big
Row, winning six of eight races.
The Bear's capped the perfor
mance with the victory over the
men's varsity.
"We haven't raced for three
weeks and this was a chance to
check out the boat and work out
some bugs before Pac-lOs next
weekend." Cal men's Coach Tim
Hodges said. "This was the first
time this crew has been able to
race together this year."
After the race, the Stanford men
had mixed emotions. "I thought if
we rowed our hardest, we'd win,"
said captain Andy Rebele after
Stanford's near comeback in the
varsity race. "We ll have to get bet
ter to beat them next week."
"We were 1 1 seconds behind
them last year and It Just didn't

make sense that we'd be dead even
at this time this year," Stanford
Men's Coach Ken Dreyfuss said.
Stanford Women's Coach John
Davis did some last-minute shuf
fling in his varsity boat to beat a
strong Cal crew. Saturday's race
was the first opportunity for the
shuffled crew to race together.
"We're back on track after some
injuries and some struggling."
Davis said. "We've got the first var
sity boat going well â€” I'm happiest
with how they blew off the start
and then held them (the Bears)
off."
The Stanford men's frosh boat,
currently ranked first on the West
Coast, was stopped early in the
race after catching a crab, but still
managed to beat Cal by 10
seconds.
"The crew is really fresh," fresh
man coxswain Scott Evans said.
"Every stroke we take is centered
toward beating Washington next
week."
Stanford Frosh/Novice Coach
Jiri Zapletal Is optimistic about
facing a consistently strong Wash
ington crew in the upcoming
Pacific Coast Championships.
"We haven't met Washington and
they're supposed to be fast this
year," Zapletal said. "We beat the
second and third fastest crews
(Orange Coast and Cal). but well
have to race well next weekend."

boat lost the Big Row by a mere two-and-one-half seconds.
