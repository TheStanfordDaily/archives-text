# Trustees meet
## Divestment plan to be considered 
### MARK LAWRENCE Senior staff writer 
The Board of Trustees' Special
Committee on Investment Re
sponsibility (SCIR) may vote today
to make sweeping changes in the
University's selective divestment
policy — changes that could lead
to nearly $3 million of divestment
and stricter guidelines on invest
ment in companies that do busi
ness in South Africa.
The SCIR indicated last night
during a meeting with the Com
mittee on Investment Responsibil
ity (CIR) that it would at least "go a
long way toward adopting" the
proposals, which were submitted
last month by the CIR, according
to CIR Chairman Frederick Hillier.
The SCIR will meet again today to
make its final decision on the
issue, but the full board may not
make a final decision on the new
policies until next month's board
meeting, Hillier cautioned.
The proposals call for automatic
divestiture of stock in any com
pany in Stanford's portfolio that
has an unacceptable rating ac
cording to the Sullivan Principles.

a set of standards used to assess
the conduct of companies doing
business in South Africa.
The CIR also proposed that
Stanford automatically divest
from any company that has not
signed the principles. The third
proposal urged Stanford not to
buy any new stock in companies
that have recently opened opera
tions in South Africa until they
are given Sullivan ratings.
Stanford now makes divestment
decisions on a case-by-case basis.
In evaluating a company's perfor
mance in South Africa, the CIR
uses a variety of information that
includes — but is not limited to —
adherence to the Sullivan Prin
ciples. In the past, the trustees
have resisted proposals like the
ones now under consideration, ar
guing that each company in
South Africa faces particular cir
cumstances and may contribute
to racial equality in South Africa
despite a low Sullivan rating.
The CIR, a 12-member commit
tee of students, faculty, staff and
alumni that advises the trustees
on investment policy, developed
the proposals during fall and win
ter quarters and sent them two
weeks ago to the members of the
SCIR.
Hillier said the trustees last
night still seemed concerned
about placing too much emphasis
on the Sullivan Principles by
making them the sole indicator of
a company's performance in
South Africa. He said the trustees
may insist that companies be
given a short period of time to
prove to the trustees that they are
making a positive contribution in
South Africa despite their low Sul
livan ratings. No trustees could be
reached for comment last night.
In meetings today and tomor
row. the trustees will consider a
slate of other matters, including
proposed facility improvements at
Green Library, Sunken Diamond
and the tennis courts.
The board will consider final ap
proval of a *5.5 million plan to
brace the stacks in Green to make
them safer in case of earthquake.
The proposal also calls for con
struction of a new environmental
control system that would regu
late the temperature in the stacks
to help preserve the books stored
there.
The Sunken Diamond proposal.

which the trustees will also con
sider for final approval, calls for
construction of a team locker
room and meeting area adjacent
to the baseball park. Now. baseball
players use the locker facilities at
Encina Gym, across Campus
Drive from the park.
The >725.000 proposal also
calls for construction of restrooms
for spectators and players, new
ticket-sales facilities and new con
cession stands. The only
restrooms now available are
outside Sunken Diamond, near
Stanford Stadium.
The trustees will also consider
preliminary approval of a plan to
build new tennis facilities, includ
ing an Indoor practice court, a
new 900-seat grandstand for the
existing outdoor facility, new
restrooms and a new locker area.
The Athletic Department has
raised gifts and pledges totaling
about *900,000. The trustees will
consider project and design ap
proval of the project once the rest
of the money has been raised,
probably by the end of this year.
The trustees will also consider
giving preliminary approval for
buying land for Stanford's pro
posed campus in Washington.
D.C. University officials are con
sidering several locations in the
city, according to Robert Freelen.

The campus is scheduled to open
in spring quarter, 1988.
