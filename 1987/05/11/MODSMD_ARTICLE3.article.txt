# Trustees meet
## Divestment plan to be considered 
### MARK LAWRENCE Senior staff writer 
The Board of Trustees' Special
Committee on Investment Re
sponsibility (SCIR) may vote today
to make sweeping changes in the
University's selective divestment
policy — changes that could lead
to nearly $3 million of divestment
and stricter guidelines on invest
ment in companies that do busi
ness in South Africa.
The SCIR indicated last night
during a meeting with the Com
mittee on Investment Responsibil
ity (CIR) that it would at least "go a
long way toward adopting" the
proposals, which were submitted
last month by the CIR, according
to CIR Chairman Frederick Hillier.
The SCIR will meet again today to
make its final decision on the
issue, but the full board may not
make a final decision on the new
policies until next month's board
meeting, Hillier cautioned.
The proposals call for automatic
divestiture of stock in any com
pany in Stanford's portfolio that
has an unacceptable rating ac
cording to the Sullivan Principles.

a set of standards used to assess
the conduct of companies doing
business in South Africa.
The CIR also proposed that
Stanford automatically divest
from any company that has not
signed the principles. The third
proposal urged Stanford not to
buy any new stock in companies
that have recently opened opera
tions in South Africa until they
are given Sullivan ratings.
Stanford now makes divestment
decisions on a case-by-case basis.
In evaluating a company's perfor
mance in South Africa, the CIR
uses a variety of information that
includes — but is not limited to —
adherence to the Sullivan Prin
ciples. In the past, the trustees
have resisted proposals like the
ones now under consideration, ar
guing that each company in
South Africa faces particular cir
cumstances and may contribute
to racial equality in South Africa
despite a low Sullivan rating.
