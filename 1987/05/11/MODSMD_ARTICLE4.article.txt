### DIANE BISGEIER Senior staff writer 
Provost James Rosse reaffirmed
Friday the University's commit
ment to investigating the
demands made last week by the
Rainbow Agenda, a coalition of
four minority organizations.
in a meettng with eight stu
dents representing the Black Stu
dent Union (BSU), the Asian
American Student Association
(AASA), the Stanford American In
dian Association (SAIA) and
MEChA, the campus Chicano or
ganization, Rosse emphasized the
University's need to look further
into the possible effects of the
proposals submitted by the
groups last week before any defi
nite action can be taken.
The meeting came after stu
dents from the groups expressed

versity President Donald Ken
nedy's reaction Thursday to a let
ter outlining the agenda's
proposals. Representatives of the
minority organizations said they
felt that the joint statement
released by Rosse and Kennedy
represented an unwillingness to
make a strong commitment to is
sues of minority concern.
According to junior Bill King of
the BSU. Friday's meeting
brought little in the way of new
commitments. "We realize that he
has to study (the proposals), but
he didn't make a commitment in
support of them. He only made a
commitment to study and not to
implement them," he said.
"The job of the provost is to set a
tone for the University and what
he seems to be setting is a tone of
disregard," King said. "He should
make it clear to the rest of the Uni
versity that they are committed."
I Rosse had a more positive reac
' tion to the meeting, saying, "It
provided an opportunity to better
j understand the consensus of the
' four student organizations."
Freshman Jerilyn Lopez Men
doza, who represented MEChA,
also spoke favorably of the
meeting. "That he took the time to
listen to us and that he thinks our
demands are justified shows that
someone is listening," she said.
According to Mendoza, one of
the key purposes of the meeting
was to convey a sense of urgency
on the part of the minority
groups.
Rosse said he understands "the

urgency of these requests" and
added that "Don Kennedy and I
will do all we can to meet that ur
gency."
"1 think the level of frustration
among the minority communities
is building up," Mendoza said.
She attributed the frustration to
both attacks on the recent West
ern Culture Task Force report and
the need for minorities to defend
the existence of ethnic theme
houses.
Mendoza pointed to incidents
where white students told black
students to "go back to Africa" if
they wish to study black heritage.
"That is the same slogan that the
Ku Klux Klan uses," she said.
"Every year there are letters and
editorials in The Daily with people
that feel that we are segregating
ourselves. People in the Stanford
community are feeling a bit more
defensive," she added.

"It's that attitude that we don't
belong here that heats people up,"
said senior Steve Phillips, former
chairman of the BSU.
Among the immediate demands
made Friday by the Rainbow
Agenda are:
□ The establishment of a vice
provost in charge of ethnic
minority life at Stanford.
□ The creation of an operating
budget in both the graduate and
undergraduate admissions offices
for minority recruitment.
□ Statements supporting the
recent Western Culture Task
Force recommendations and
stating that the American Indian
will never be reinstated as the Uni
versity mascot.
□ The appointment of an outside
commission to study racism and
the quality of minority life at Stan
ford.

□ Immediate divestment from all
corporations that do business in
South Africa and support of the
United Farm Workers' grape
boycott.
ASSU Senator Stacey Leyton.
who supports the agenda's
proposals and attended the
meeting, said:
"We're (the ASSU) going to be
more involved because this is not
an issue that just minorities are
concerned about." She added
that, "We will continue to be pres
ent at these kinds of meetings,
and also at rallies and other ac
tions, to put pressure on the Uni
versity to respond to these
demands."
The next step the agenda will
take to promote its proposals will
be a rally today at noon in White
Plaza along with Stanford Out of
South Africa (SOSA).
