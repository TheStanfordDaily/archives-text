Development of a company vision, op
timism and personal expertise are crucial to
the success of new business ventures, the
founder of the nation's largest discount
brokerage firm told a conference here Sat
urday.
Charles Schwab, chairman of Charles
Schwab & Co., delivered the keynote ad
dress at this weekend's "Perspectives on
Entrepreneurship" conference held at the
Graduate School of Business.
A Stanford graduate, Schwab discussed
his own entrepreneurial experiences and
explained how some ventures can succeed
while others fail.
Addressing the conference's theme of
"Starting Out. Building Up, Moving On."
Schwab emphasized that schooling, knowl
edge of people, optimism and "company
directing vision" were essential to
entrepreneurial success.
"Certainly education — schooling is fun
damental." Schwab said. "You've got to
know the fundamentals of business.
"A successful entrepreneur has to develop
at least one functional level of expertise,
whether it be in a financial area, (or)
whether it be in some technology, com
puters and information ... or marketing or
operations/manufacturing." Schwab said.
Relating these ideas to his own situation.
Schwab described the work experiences he
had while still in school. These included
pulling a tractor, working on a railroad and
selling insulation door-to-door. He called

the latter "the worst experience I've ever
had.''
In these jobs, Schwab said, "The funda
mental thing that served me really well was I
learned about people, learned about the di
versity of people."
After earning a degree in economics from
Stanford and a masters in business from
the Stanford business school in 1961,
Schwab said he spent 13 years working in a
variety of financial areas ranging from
portfolio management to setting up mutual
funds. As a customer of 50 different
brokerage firms, Schwab said he saw how
Wall Street companies think: "very much in
terms of the company and very little in
terms of the customers."
In 1974, Schwab started his own firm.
Calling the early days of the firm "modest
beginnings," Schwab said he "had >90,000
in capital and . . . was going to take on Wall
Street."
Schwab said his company wanted to be
fast, efficient, cdst-effective, timely, accu
rate and price-competitive. These charac
teristics were part of Schwab's larger
"vision of customer empathy"— building
the firm around the interests of the custom
ers.
"The same philosophy is holding today."
Schwab said of his company. "I think it's
remarkable, but I think it's pretty impor
tant for the successful entrepreneurial com
pany to maintain its visions."
Finally. Schwab attributes his business
