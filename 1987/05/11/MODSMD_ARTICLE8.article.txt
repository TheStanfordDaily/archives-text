CDC backs voluntary AIDS testing
NEW YORK (AP) — A confidential report by the federal Centers
for Disease Control recommends a major increase in voluntary
AIDS testing but opposes an increase in mandatory testing, ac
cording to a published report.
The 99-page report calls for strong laws to protect the secrecy of
test results and the civil rights of those infected with the virus, ac
cording to an article in Monday editions of The New York Times.
The report by Dr. James O. Mason, CDC director, said manda
tory testing was not justified by current knowledge of how the
virus spreads.
But it said testing should be encouraged for certain groups, in
cluding patients at venereal disease clinics, intravenous drug
users and pregnant women in areas with high rates of AIDS infec
tion, the newspaper said.
The report said the presence of antibodies against AIDS "is tan
tamount to a diagnosis of current and persistent infection" with
the virus "even though many infected people have no clinical
evidence of disease." according to the Times.
The report's recommendations run contrary to the positions of
many in the Reagan administration, including Education Secre
tary William J. Bennett and White House aide Gary L. Bauer, who
are proponents of increased mandatory testing.
Poll criticizes media coverage
NEW YORK (AP) — About two-thirds of those polled by
Newsweek and Time expressed disapproval of media coverage of
Gary Hart's meetings with Donna Rice, the magazines reported
Sunday.
Newsweek reported that 64 percent of those polled said the
media have been unfair in its "treatment of marital infidelity
charges against" Hart, while 22 percent said coverage was fair.
Seventy percent said they disapproved of stakeouts or other sur
veillance if there are questions about a candidate's private life,
with 23 percent approving.
In the Time poll, 67 percent said it is wrong for the press to
write stories about the sex life of a presidential candidate and 27
percent said It was right.
Meanwhile, a Los Angeles Times poll found that 41 percent of
those surveyed had a less favorable impression of the news media
than before the Hart incident, while 9 percent had a more favor
able impression.
According to the newspaper poll, those surveyed were divided al
most equally over whether "a presidential candidate's extramari
tal affairs should be reported in the media," but the newspaper
did not give percentages.
The Newsweek poll by the Gallup Organization of 812 adults
Wednesday and Thursday showed that 52 percent felt candidates'
private lives should be off-limits, while 42 percent said private
lives are a good thing to investigate.
IBM: Superconductor discovery
Yorktown Heights. N.Y. — IBM scientists have increased the
current-carrying capacity of a new family of superconductors by a
hundred-fold, thus overcoming perhaps the largest barrier to
widespread use of the potentially revolutionary materials, the
company announced.
The inability of such materials to actually carry large amounts
of current had loomed large as, in recent months, researchers
around the world made stunning progress in coming up with ma
terials that are capable of carrying electricity virtually without
resistance.
The latest breakthrough means the materials could be used "for
most foreseeable applications," said Praveen Chaudhari, vice
president for science at the IBM Research Laboratory in Yorktown
Heights, N.Y.
Those uses might include long-distance transmission of
electricity, compact high-speed computers, smooth-riding mag
netically levitated trains and smaller magnetic imaging devices for
medical diagnosis.
Murphy praises Iraqi courage
BAGHDAD, Iraq — Assistant Secretary of State Richard
Murphy, arriving in Iraq on the third leg of a Gulf tour aimed at
explaining U.S. policies on the Iran-Iraq war and threats to
freedom of navigation in the oil-rich region, said yesterday that
the U.S. regretted Iran's refusal to negotiate with Iraq.
Murphy said Iraqis had shown courage during the seven-year
old war and"the time has come to reward this courage with
peace."
Murphy's talks here are expected to center on the backlash of
the recent U.S. arms-to-Iran scandal and on mounting dangers to
ships created by Iraqi air raids on Iranian tankers and retaliatory
Iranian attacks on Arabian ship traffic.
Iraq, which restored diplomatic relations with the U.S. in 1985
after a 17-year break, claims that the United States has violated
its declared neutrality on the war by last year's clandestine at
tempt to trade weapons for American hostages held in Lebanon.
Murphy arrived here from the United Arab Emirates where he
emphasized the need for a negotiated settlement to "this tragic
(Gulf) war which is threatening U.S. strategic interests and the se
curity of all countries in the area."
Iranian gunboats heavily damaged a Soviet cargo ship last week
in what was seen as a response to an agreement to lease three
Soviet-flag tankers to Kuwait. Iran says it is willing to stop attacks
on ships commuting between Arab ports if Iraq stops its raids on
Iran's tankers.
Reagan encourages black scientists
TUSKEGEE. Ala. — President Reagan paid tribute yesterday to
black scientists, businessmen and military heroes and said that
"if black Americans are to progress socially and economically" they
must become part of "the great technological changes now sweep
ing our country and the world."
In his first speech to a black institution of higher learning, the
president told a commencement audience at Tuskegee University
that it was "crucial" for young black Americans to become scien
tists, physicists and mathematicians.
Reagan said that instead of focusing on the achievements of
black athletes and entertainers, as he has sometimes done, "it is
high time the media and the rest of America began paying more
attention" to the successes of black professionals.
"We must be concerned about the perception children of every
race are developing about themselves and about others." Reagan
said. "Certainly, problems in the black community cannot be cov
ered up or ignored, yet rather than dwelling almost exclusively on
the negative, let's make certain our children see stories of black
successes and triumphs."
Reagan, who as a conservative spokesman opposed the
landmark Civil Rights Act of 1964, said yesterday that "great
strides were made through political action" in achieving civil
rights in the 1950s and 19605.
"The civil rights movement earned the respect and gratitude of
all good and decent Americans, even some who may at first have
had reservations about what was happening." the president said,
without mentioning his own reservations.
