# Alleged Nazi war criminal will challenge France
## Klaus Barbie to stand trial 
### 
LYON, France — Klaus Barbie, a 73-year-old
former Gestapo lieutenant known as "the
Butcher of Lyon." will go on trial today for
"crimes against humanity" In a case that
comes out of one of the darkest, most unsavory
periods in French history.
Barbie's defense attorney. Jacques Verges,
has vowed to put France itself on trial for Its
World War II record, but the limited scope of
the proceedings may make this difficult.
Serge Klarsfeld. a lawyer for the families of
some of the alleged victims of Barbie and the
husband of Beate Klarsfeld, the German-born
woman who disclosed that Barbie was living
under an assumed name in Bolivia, said in an
interview on the eve of the trial:
"We are not going to tell the story of French
collaboration at this trial. We are not putting
Nazi Ideology on trial. We are making sure that
an injustice is punished."
Throughout France, Barbie Is usually
denounced as the Lyon Gestapo chief who ar
rested the French Resistance leader Jean
Moulin in 1943 and allegedly tortured him to
death. But he will not face any charges in con
nection with this.
Under French law, the killing of Moulin is re
garded as a war crime, and prosecution for war
crimes must be undertaken within 10 years.
But there is no time limit for what French law
defines as "crimes against humanity." As a
result, most of the charges against Barbie
grow out of the arrest and deportation of Jews
from the Lyon area to the gas chambers of Nazi
extermination camps.
Among other things. Barbie is charged with
ordering the roundup April 6, 1944, of 44
Jewish children from a dormitory in the village
of Izleu in a mountainous area 40 miles east of
Lyon. The children were living there because
their parents had been transported to the
Auschwitz concentration camp in Poland. All
the Izleu children followed their parents to
Auschwitz and died there.
Barbie has denied ordering the roundup of

these children, or other Jews, and Insists that
a telex message signed by him ordering the
Izleu arrests Is a forgery.
The trial of Barbie will echo with embarrass
ment for the United States as well, for Ameri
can officials are largely responsible for his
avoiding French justice for 40 years. The U.S.
Army Counter Intelligence Corps harbored
him In Germany after World War 11, consider
ing him a specialist In the struggle against
communism. When French demands for him
became incessant, U.S. Army officers provided
him with a false passport, under the pseudo
nym Klaus Altmann, and helped him and his
family settle In Bolivia in 1951.
Twenty years later, the Klarsfelds, dogged
Nazi hunters, Identified Altmann as Barbie.
Beate Klarsfeld flew to Bolivia in 1972 to
proclaim the identification and demand that
Barbie be extradited to France. But under the
protection of right-wing military governments.
Barbie continued to live comfortably and with
Impunity in Bolivia.
Barbie was trapped by the combination of a
Socialist government coming to power In
France in 1981 and a democratic, leftist gov
ernment coming to power in Bolivia in 1982.
Bolivian authorities arrested Barbie in 1983
and expelled him to French Guiana. French of
ficials there took him into custody and
returned him to Lyon.
The trial will focus attention on an epoch
that many French find difficult to assess and
accept. During World War 11, France was ad
ministered by a collaborationist, fasclstic gov
ernment In Vichy led by Marshal Philippe
Petain. Many scholars agree that the Vichy
government, which had a great deal of popular
support, enacted anti-Semitic legislation even
before the Germans asked for it. Barbie could
not have run his Gestapo (Geheime
Staatspolizei — Secret State Police) operation
in Lyon without French collaborators.
France was then a bitterly divided nation,
and even today television discussion programs

about the role of the French during the war
tend to end In angry, arm-waving, shouting
matches.
Taking advantage of the interest In the trial,
Premier Jacques Chirac has ordered all French
public schools to have special classes this
month on the measures taken by the Vichy
government against Jews.
"I hope that young people will be Informed of
a certain number of facts that occurred and
which were so profoundly opposed to human
rights and respect for human beings," Chirac
said.
Aside from the roundup of the children from
Izieu, Barbie is charged with:
□ Ordering a 1943 raid on the Lyon
headquarters of the General Union of French
Israelites and the deportation of 86 Jews after
the raid.
□ Ordering the deportation of 650 people on
the last train to leave Lyon for the extermina
tion camps before the liberation of the city in
August 1944.
□ Torturing and deporting individual Jews
In 1943 and 1944.
□ Torturing and deporting individual Resis
tance fighters during the same period.
Much attention has been focused on
Barbie's lawyer, the 62-year-old Verges, who
has a long record of defending unpopular
causes. Asked about his reasons for taking the
case, Verges replied recently: "That's my job. I
do not have to defend Albert Schweitzer,
Mother Teresa or Elie Wiesel. They do not have
any need for me."
Verges appears determined to shift the focus
of the trial and the guilt from Barbie to France.
Barbie, according to Verges, will deny all the
charges, insisting that he neither tortured
prisoners nor ordered the deportation of Jews.
But the defense will go beyond mere denial.
Verges told a group of foreign correspondents
recently that he will explore the questionable
record of France during the war.

the last train to leave Lyon for the extermina

LYON, France — Klaus Barbie, a 73-year-old
former Gestapo lieutenant known as "the
Butcher of Lyon." will go on trial today for
"crimes against humanity" In a case that
comes out of one of the darkest, most unsavory
periods in French history.
Barbie's defense attorney. Jacques Verges,
has vowed to put France itself on trial for Its
World War II record, but the limited scope of
the proceedings may make this difficult.
Serge Klarsfeld. a lawyer for the families of
some of the alleged victims of Barbie and the
husband of Beate Klarsfeld, the German-born
woman who disclosed that Barbie was living
under an assumed name in Bolivia, said in an
interview on the eve of the trial:
"We are not going to tell the story of French
collaboration at this trial. We are not putting
Nazi Ideology on trial. We are making sure that
an injustice is punished."
Throughout France, Barbie Is usually
denounced as the Lyon Gestapo chief who ar
rested the French Resistance leader Jean
Moulin in 1943 and allegedly tortured him to
death. But he will not face any charges in con
nection with this.
Under French law, the killing of Moulin is re
garded as a war crime, and prosecution for war
crimes must be undertaken within 10 years.
But there is no time limit for what French law
defines as "crimes against humanity." As a
result, most of the charges against Barbie
grow out of the arrest and deportation of Jews
from the Lyon area to the gas chambers of Nazi
extermination camps.
Among other things. Barbie is charged with
ordering the roundup April 6, 1944, of 44
Jewish children from a dormitory in the village
of Izleu in a mountainous area 40 miles east of
Lyon. The children were living there because
their parents had been transported to the
Auschwitz concentration camp in Poland. All
the Izleu children followed their parents to
Auschwitz and died there.
Barbie has denied ordering the roundup of

these children, or other Jews, and Insists that
a telex message signed by him ordering the
Izleu arrests Is a forgery.
The trial of Barbie will echo with embarrass
ment for the United States as well, for Ameri
can officials are largely responsible for his
avoiding French justice for 40 years. The U.S.
Army Counter Intelligence Corps harbored
him In Germany after World War 11, consider
ing him a specialist In the struggle against
communism. When French demands for him
became incessant, U.S. Army officers provided
him with a false passport, under the pseudo
nym Klaus Altmann, and helped him and his
family settle In Bolivia in 1951.
Twenty years later, the Klarsfelds, dogged
Nazi hunters, Identified Altmann as Barbie.
Beate Klarsfeld flew to Bolivia in 1972 to
proclaim the identification and demand that
Barbie be extradited to France. But under the
protection of right-wing military governments.
Barbie continued to live comfortably and with
Impunity in Bolivia.
Barbie was trapped by the combination of a
Socialist government coming to power In
France in 1981 and a democratic, leftist gov
ernment coming to power in Bolivia in 1982.
Bolivian authorities arrested Barbie in 1983
and expelled him to French Guiana. French of
ficials there took him into custody and
returned him to Lyon.
The trial will focus attention on an epoch
that many French find difficult to assess and
accept. During World War 11, France was ad
ministered by a collaborationist, fasclstic gov
ernment In Vichy led by Marshal Philippe
Petain. Many scholars agree that the Vichy
