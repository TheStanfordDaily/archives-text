The Making of the Editor, Volume 192:
From the first caucus to the final electoral college
tally, catch all the action as the cool, cerebral Kansan
liberal and the fiery New Jersey reactionary duke it out
for the highest office in the land.
The action begins tomorrow at 5 p.m., with platforms
available from then until the voting.
Meet the candidates up-close-and-personal Friday at
a happy hour, 5 p.m. in The Daily office.
Watch The Miami Herald for full campaign coverage.
