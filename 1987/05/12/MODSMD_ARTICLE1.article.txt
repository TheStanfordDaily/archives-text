# Thieves target cars on campus
## 
### JAY FRY Staff writer 
Fifteen cars were broken into
around the Stanford campus last
weekend, probably by an experi
enced group of stereo thieves,
Stanford police said yesterday.
Most of the break-ins are
believed to have occurred Satur
day between 9 and 11 p.m. at
various locations on campus, ac
cording to Stanford Police Chief
Marvin Herrington. in all but one
of the cases the thieves stole
stereo equipment, he said.
Noting that no witnesses
phoned in reports of thefts in
progress, Herrington said he
believes that experienced thieves
are responsible for the break-ins.
Last weekend's car break-ins
were the latest in a rash of car
stereo thefts that have plagued the
campus over the past few months,
according to police.
"We've had a number of these
cases on and off over the past two
or three months. There's no pat
tern, no particular time, no partic
ular location." said Herrington.
"They (the thieves) move around
on us," Herrington said. "They
change their days, they change
their times."
He added that the Tresidder
parking lot "seems to be hit the
hardest."
Six of last weekend's 15 car
break-ins took place in or adjacent
to the Tresidder parking lot. Other
isolated break-ins took place in
the Cowell Cluster, Branner, Wil
bur and Stern parking lots. Her
rington said he believed all or
most of the break-ins were con
nected.
There are an average of three to
four car break-ins on campus per
week, according to Herrington.
"We get hit (by car thieves) all the
time, but frequencies are just up.
Somebody's really working us," he
said.
He said he believes part of a
group of thieves "keeps a pretty
close eye" on the area where a car
is parked, while others work on
removing the stereo.
"Whoever's doing it is pretty
careful." Herrington said. "They
must be experienced."
The thieves "must be able to
(remove the stereos) very quickly"
because the crimes took place
"during the time when a lot of
people are around," Herrington
explained.
In most of last weekend's break-
Ins, the cars' vent windows were
smashed to help gain entry, he
said.
Because the police "can't do
much (to thwart break-ins) with a
patrol car," Herrington said offi

cers run undercover stakeouts
"from time to time."
Herrington said a stakeout of
the Escondido Village parking lot
three weeks ago had to be called
off to search for a man who at
tacked two women near the
Physics Tank. Several cars were
broken into at Escondido later
that evening, he added.
"It's a frustrating type of crime,"
he said. "We need any assistance
we can get" from the community
concerning the break-ins.
