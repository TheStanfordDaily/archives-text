# McFarlane accepts responsibility
## 
### 
WASHINGTON - Three
months and two days after he
attempted suicide in anguish
over the Iran-contra affair,
Robert McFarlane told Con
gress in measured monotones
yesterday he accepts responsi
bility for major parts of the
wayward policies that led to the
greatest crisis of Ronald
Reagan's presidency.
Reagan's former national se
curity adviser, in his first sub
stantive public appearance
since taking an overdose of
Valium on Feb. 9, spent five
hours testifying before House
and Senate investigating com
mittees as they opened their
second week of hearings on the
arms sales to Iran and the di
version of funds to the
Nicaraguan rebels.
"I have to accept responsibil
ity. ... I am responsible for
what happened," McFarlane
said in describing a critical
juncture in the avalanche of
events and policy decisions. At
another point, when asked if he
felt "caught in the middle," he
replied slowly, through tightly
pressed lips:
"No. It was my responsibil
ity."
McFarlane ended his day of

testimony visibly drained,
walking from the hearing room
hand-in-hand with his wife. "It
was a long day for him," said
Senate counsel Arthur Liman,
who conducted yesterday's
questioning. "It's not easy for
him to revisit all these events."
Liman. whose questioning
lacked the aggressive edge he
had employed last week in
briskly examining retired Air
Force Maj. Gen. Richard Se
cord, allowed McFarlane at
times to give rambling ans
wers. "Well. I guess I'm wander
ing off the point," McFarlane
acknowledged once.
After Liman led McFarlane
through a chronology of events
involving both the complex set
of arms sales to Iran and the
flow of aid to the contras, he
concluded the day's questions
by asking: "How did it happen?
What's the lesson?"
"You deserve a thorough an
swer that is utterly missing
from any that's been made
today," McFarlane responded.
". . . And I'll be glad tomorrow,
if you have the time, to provide
some context that I think
doesn't mitigate, but makes
more clear just why this did
happen." Los Angeles Times
