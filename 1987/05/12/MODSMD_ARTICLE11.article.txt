When It comes to recruiting faculty. Stan
ford has many selling points — its pres
tigious reputation, 90-degree weather in
May and a new University program that
helps make housing in the Palo Alto area af
fordable.
1 hrough a co-investment program (COIN)
launched last year, the University has been
able to neutralize high housing costs as a
negative factor in recruiting and retaining
faculty, said Richard Whitmore, deputy di
rector of the University's Real Estate Pro
grams and Lands Management office.
According to Whitmore, COIN and other
real estate programs have successfully met
the needs of faculty members recruited in
this year's recruiting season.
COIN uses a housing allowance program
and a down-payment assistance program to
provide income supplements and low inter
est loans to faculty members.
Because of COIN, Whitmore said, the
threat of expensive housing near Stanford
"is not a problem anymore" in recruiting
prospective faculty members. He noted,
however, that high area housing costs
remain a factor in the University's ability to
retain current faculty.
"Faculty members get a good offer from
another university with a better salary and
lower-cost housing. They come to us to find

out what we can do for them," Whitmore
said.
"We can get them another COIN loan and
get them into a bigger house," he added.
For new faculty "there is still a psycholog
ical barrier when they come out here and
see how little they get for so much money,
(but) we're usually able to break that down,"
Whitmore said.
To participate in the COIN program, a
faculty member first gets a mortgage on his
home through the commercial market.
Then the University puts in a second
mortgage for 50 percent of the house price,
Whitmore said.
The University charges a low interest rate
on the mortgage, normally 5 or 6 percent,
he said. The faculty member does not owe
anything else until he sells the house,
Whitmore said.
In return, the University assumes a share
in the appreciation of the house.
"We earn a reasonable return of the loan.
The COIN program is really an investment
of the University," Whitmore said.
Expensive local housing is not a problem
unique to Stanford, according to Whitmore.
He said Harvard, MIT, Columbia and the
University of Wisconsin have similar
housing problems.
"The housing costs in Boston are out of
control," Whitmire said. "Harvard and MIT
are interested in what we're doing,"
Whitmore said.
