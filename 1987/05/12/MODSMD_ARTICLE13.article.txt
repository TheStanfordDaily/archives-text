During fraternity Rush. Trancos' resident
fellows passed out letters to all the men in the
dorm. The letters, admittedly biased toward
dormitory living, were written to provide
freshmen with a negative perspective on
joining fraternities.
The theory was that Rush provides a one
sided positive view of fraternity life. The goal
of the RFs was to balance the information
pool by handing out fliers that would provide
freshmen with information that Rush did
not — both on supposed negative aspects of
fraternal life and positive advantages of
dorm-based education. With balanced infor
mation. freshmen could then make a more
informed choice as to whether fraternity life
was really for them, according to the RFs.
Tom Bauman and Martha Feldman have
received a lot of criticisms for their one-sided
actions. However, it is well within the role of
RFs to provide information on an aspect of

University life about which they profess to
have considerable knowledge to their
residence members. In addition, the RFs did
not exert undue pressure on any members of
their dorm as has been argued. The letters
stressed options, information and careful
decision-making.
In the future, to avoid controversy and es
pecially in the name of fairness, RFs should
avoid giving unsolicited arguments that
blatantly favor one point of view. The RFs in
Trancos were only trying to counteract what
they considered to be the lopsided picture
being given by Rush; nonetheless, their in
fluence as RFs should not be underes
timated. Next time they have a point of view
they want to get across, it would be more ap
propriate — and more educational — to have
a program and invite participants from both
sides of the fraternity issue into the dorm to
speak to prospective rushees.
