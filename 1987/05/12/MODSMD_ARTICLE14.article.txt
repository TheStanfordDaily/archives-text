# Is democracy a hoax?
## 
### 
As a teaching assistant in Prof. John Manley's
American Government course, I have to constantly
answer the question: "Is American representational
democracy a hoax?" Confronted by the fact that the
majority of people do not find their interests
represented by their elected leaders, I ask my stu
dents who or what is responsible for this situation.
Does the fault lie with the masses for not making
their views known and/or not ensuring that their
representatives act upon these interests? Are the
elite leaders to blame for not discovering their con
stituents' thoughts on the myriad of issues these
leaders decide on behalf of the citizens? Or is the
problem that the representational democratic sys
tem, in which we have placed our trust and blind
faith, operates only on paper and in our minds but
not in our daily lives?

NATHAN HOCHMAN

In trying to work through the different responses
to these questions, I focused one section's attention
on the recent Council of Presidents election. Clearly,
if representational democracy were to prove more
than a myth, we should see it operating successfully
on the campus level. Here, our representatives are
our fellow students. They do not work far away, just a
few minutes walk. Most issues they decide affect us
directly and we have the abilty to monitor their ac
tions closely (e.g. by attending meetings).
What I found out through the discussion was most
interesting. First, most of the students, with the ex
clusion of those actually in government, had no idea
what the COP or ASSU Senate do and what issues
they cover. Most did not know when or where the
senate meetings are or who their representatives are.
Second, when told that COP members are paid
$5,000, that they have roughly $700,000 to spend
and that they sit on important University commit
tees. most eyebrows in the class were raised — prob
ably for the first time.
Third, everyone in class had some grievance with
the present system — from overpriced dorm meal
contracts to paying money to bring Dr. Ruth here —
yet few thought of directly contacting their ASSU
senators to voice their concerns. They had heard
these leaders address these problems before and
nothing had been accomplished in the past — why
would the future be any different?
The most difficult question then arose. Did the
fault for the fact that these students' interests had
gone unheard lie with the students, their representa
tives or the system itself?
One student contended that the process was
available to be used. If the students did not employ it,
then they had no one to blame but themselves. Sort

of like the arguments we hear for equal opportunity
rather than affirmative action.
Another student echoed the conduit theory of rep
resentation, that the leaders' sole responsibility con
sisted in seeking out the students' views and con
cerns and channeling them into policy and action; if
the majority of the campus' wishes remained unful
filled, then the elected representatives had evidently
failed in their jobs.
But then a student posited that not only the
leaders but the system was responsible for voter
apathy and general dissatisfaction with the whole
governmental process. He drew his support from the
confusion in the senate over when to have an elec
tion, how to have it, who won it and how who won it
really had not won it so another election had to be
held. If our representatives cannot even organize
their own affairs and our constitution only seems to
produce pandemonium, then why should we believe
student government will do anything constructive
for us?
Dwelling over this last student's words, I went to
vote in the second election for the Council of Presi
dents. I was confronted by a preferential ballot where
I was told to mark the numbers one to four depend
ing on my order of preference.
Thinking that the vote counters were going to add
all the numbers together and the one with the lowest
score would win the election, I marked a "1" for one
slate and a "4" for all the others. After I did this, I was
told my ballot was void.
Then I went to the senate and they said it wasn't
void but that preferential voting meant that there
were really three rounds of voting. The top three win
ners of the first round receive the redistributed "2"
markings of the first round loser, thereby resulting
in a winner. "That's the way they do it in parliamen
tary procedure," it was explained to me.
1 was outraged. We don't have Robert's Rules of Or
der lying around at the polling stand; we don't even
have the incentive of getting an ASSU refund for this
second election. Why have our elected leaders chosen
possibly the most confusing system for us to make
our voices heard through the ballot?
As it turns out, the voting did go all three rounds
before a winner was announced. Most people did not
vote. In the bicentennial year of the U.S. Constitu
tion, the question my sections will have to answer is:
Would James Madison, the Constitution's proud
father, view our representational campus democracy
as truly representational? Democratic? Or would
Karl Marx be laughing vindictively from the grave,
denouncing our democracy of the students as the
true hoax it appears to be?

and that they sit on important University commit
tees. most eyebrows in the class were raised — prob
ably for the first time.
Third, everyone in class had some grievance with
the present system — from overpriced dorm meal
contracts to paying money to bring Dr. Ruth here —
yet few thought of directly contacting their ASSU
senators to voice their concerns. They had heard
these leaders address these problems before and
nothing had been accomplished in the past — why
would the future be any different?
The most difficult question then arose. Did the
fault for the fact that these students' interests had
gone unheard lie with the students, their representa
tives or the system itself?
One student contended that the process was
available to be used. If the students did not employ it,
then they had no one to blame but themselves. Sort

of like the arguments we hear for equal opportunity
rather than affirmative action.
Another student echoed the conduit theory of rep
resentation, that the leaders' sole responsibility con
sisted in seeking out the students' views and con
cerns and channeling them into policy and action; if
the majority of the campus' wishes remained unful
filled, then the elected representatives had evidently
failed in their jobs.
But then a student posited that not only the
leaders but the system was responsible for voter
apathy and general dissatisfaction with the whole
governmental process. He drew his support from the
confusion in the senate over when to have an elec
tion, how to have it, who won it and how who won it
really had not won it so another election had to be
held. If our representatives cannot even organize
their own affairs and our constitution only seems to
produce pandemonium, then why should we believe
student government will do anything constructive
for us?
Dwelling over this last student's words, I went to
vote in the second election for the Council of Presi
dents. I was confronted by a preferential ballot where
I was told to mark the numbers one to four depend
ing on my order of preference.
Thinking that the vote counters were going to add
all the numbers together and the one with the lowest
score would win the election, I marked a "1" for one
slate and a "4" for all the others. After I did this, I was
told my ballot was void.
Then I went to the senate and they said it wasn't
void but that preferential voting meant that there
were really three rounds of voting. The top three win
ners of the first round receive the redistributed "2"
markings of the first round loser, thereby resulting
in a winner. "That's the way they do it in parliamen
tary procedure," it was explained to me.
1 was outraged. We don't have Robert's Rules of Or
der lying around at the polling stand; we don't even
have the incentive of getting an ASSU refund for this
second election. Why have our elected leaders chosen
possibly the most confusing system for us to make
our voices heard through the ballot?
As it turns out, the voting did go all three rounds
before a winner was announced. Most people did not
vote. In the bicentennial year of the U.S. Constitu
tion, the question my sections will have to answer is:
Would James Madison, the Constitution's proud
father, view our representational campus democracy
as truly representational? Democratic? Or would
Karl Marx be laughing vindictively from the grave,
denouncing our democracy of the students as the
true hoax it appears to be?
