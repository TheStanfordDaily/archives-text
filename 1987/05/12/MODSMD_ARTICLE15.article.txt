"The problem of the 20th century," W.E.B.
Dußois wrote more than 80 years ago. "is the
color line." The development of laws and
governmental action notwithstanding, his ob
servation remains as true now as then. And
the problem of which Dubois speaks may con
tinue to plague us well into the 21st century.

With this in mind, I've observed the Western
Culture debate with great interest, not in the
sense of who's right and who's wrong, but in
terms of the controversy's symbolic signifi
cance. Attention to the symbolic significance
of such a controversy can, I think, yield more
insight and do more to deepen our under
standing of people than can focusing solely on
the specific facts of discussion.
When we talk about fundamental change in
the content and focus of the Western Culture
sequence, we're talking about history, about
changing history. In this regard, the works of
the acclaimed writer James Baldwin come to
mind: "History, as nearly no one seems to
know, is not merely something to be read. And
it does not refer merely or even principally to
the past. On the contrary, the great force of
history comes from the fact that we carry it
within us and are unconsciously controlled by
it in many ways. History is literally present in
all that we do. It could scarcely be otherwise,
since it is to history that we owe our frames of
reference, our identities and our aspirations."
The acrimony of the Western Culture debate
indicates, it seems to me. that the issue here
runs much deeper than simply what is the rel

evant content of the course sequence or what
are the parameters of practicality in terms of
leaching the sequence.
We're talking about changing history. And
as Baldwin points out, history refers to more
than simply the past. Of course, history is the
past, but through the power of the past it gives
meaning and direction to our lives today. Our
very sense of who we are is intricately and inex
tricably bound to our perception of history and
our role and place in that history.
To change the presentation of history
through altering the Western Culture se
quence is not merely to make minorities feel
good because their role is recognized, nor to
give all students a broader view of the world.
Rather, when we talk about changing history,
we are talking about destroying white
America's image of itself, an image which is so
tenuous and fragile, yet to which most white
Americans cling so desperately. Thus, the im
plications of a fundamental change in the Area
One requirement are great.
The debate represents the struggle to control
history, which has until now been regulated
and manipulated almost exclusively by white
men. Through their control of history, white
men in America have not only defined them
selves, but others as well. In this light, we see
that the struggle over history, in this particu
lar case the debate about the Area One require
ment. is really a struggle to define and deter
mine the self.
Unfortunately, only one history can prevail
and the sense of self for which blacks and
others are trying to gain legitimation by neces
sity erodes the sense of self to which white
America clings. A zero-sum game, I think it's
called.

When we talk about fun
damental change in the
content and focus of the
Western Culture se
quence, we're talking
about history.

Thus, the strident opposition to the Western
Culture change comes not from careful intel
lectual scrutiny of the facts, but rather from
the desire of a group of people to maintain the
history that they have used so effectively to
glorify themselves and degrade others.
Similarly, the fervent support of the change is
more emotional than intellectual, expressive of
a group's understandable desire for a history
that not only includes but legitimates their
role and uplifts their identity, nurturing the
sense of self and history necessary to succeed
in this world.
Embedded in the two groups' different goals
for the Area One sequence are drastically dif
ferent conceptions of themselves and the his
tory from whence they've come, identities and
perceptions of history which, in my opinion,
are fundamentally opposed. As long as this
fundamental conflict of identities remains,
and I don't see it diminishing, a central prob
lem in America will remain, as Dußois put it.
