Walking out
was not right
As an ASSU senator and chair
man of the appropriations com
mittee, I am constantly forced to
speak out — and eventually vote
— on difficult, emotional issues.
Moreover, as a participant in a
democratic process, there is an
implicit assumption that I recog
nize and support the ideals of the
democratic process.
In the May 5 meeting of the
ASSU Senate I displayed serious
disrespect for the process of dem
ocratic student government by
walking out of the senate meeting
during debate on the grape
boycott issue.
Though I can't speak for the
other five senators who also
walked out, I admit that I left the
chamber in an attempt to deny
the senate the quorum necessary
for a vote to be taken on an issue.
I walked out of the senate
meeting to indefinitely stall con
sideration of the grape boycott.
My intention at the time was to
postpone a vote on the bill so that
it could be sent back to commit
tee and discussed at length in a
smaller, more specialized and
more rational decision-making
body.
The debate on the senate floor
had become so charged with
emotional irrationality that I
feared the senate would pass a
bill that might not address the
real issue — the danger of farm
pesticides. I therefore felt (past
tense!) justified in walking out.
Now, however, I realize that my
behavior is unjustifiable. By
walking out of a senate meeting
with the intention of denying the
senate a quorum, I showed a
disturbing disregard for the dem
ocratic process.
Rather than stalling the issue
and attempting to prohibit the
other senators from voting on
this issue, I should have
remained in the chamber and
simply abstained from the roll-call
vote. By abstaining I could voice
my discomfort with the bill while
still allowing the other senators to
decide the issue democratically.
Again, I'd like to express my
sincere apologies for the injustice
I committed against the senate,
the students and especially the
farmworkers and their families

who are involved in the grape
boycott issue.
That the senate eventually
passed the boycott resolution is a
credit to those individuals who
showed up at the senate meeting
to lobby passionately for the
grape boycott. It is to them,
primarily, that I extend my apol
ogy-

Officials are
only trying to
avoid lawsuits
The definition of "overreact" is
to react in a highly emotional
way, beyond what seems called
for.
What does this mean to the
Stanford community? How about
these headlines: "Police force
carding at three campus parties"
(Daily, May 4); "Drinking laws to
be enforced," "Larkin dorm funds
won't go toward purchase of alco
hol" and "RFs told students to
avoid frat" (Daily, May 5); "Fear of
police shutdown: Donner likely to
cancel street dance" (Daily, May
6); "Fraternities react to crack
down on drinking," "Alcohol
policy under scrutiny" and
"Donner votes against having
street party" (Daily, May 7).
This definition of "overreact"
seems very apt. The catalyst for
all of the events reported under
these headlines is undeniably the
drowning of Dave Dunshee — a
highly emotional issue.
The actions being taken, espe
cially by the police, certainly ap
pear to be beyond what's called
for. Rather than controlling the
amount of drinking at the par
ties, they are simply covering
themselves in case of a lawsuit.
The issue at stake here is not
underage drinking, it's irrespon
sible drinking. As Rick Weisberg
pointed out in a recent viewpoint,
these new procedures by the
police are not solving the problem
at all (Daily, May 7). Couldn't
someone fall into the lake after
being cited and sent home from a
large party? The answer is "yes,
but the police are certainly not to
blame."
Unquestionably there's a major
problem when tragedies are
allowed to happen. However, in
this case, the proper solution to

the problem is not to try to elimi
nate the parties or the drinking
(underage or otherwise) on
campus, but rather to use this
incident as an illustration of just
how dangerous irresponsible
drinking really is. Let's solve this
problem, not just cover ourselves.

The police are
just enforcing
the state law
I was both disappointed and
embarrassed by the recent edito
rial concerning the police crack
down on underage drinking at
Stanford (Daily, May 7). The edi
torial expressed a disturbing
opinion which has come to be
held by the student body as an
inalienable right: that Stanford
should be a haven from the law.
Rather than arguing against
the injustice of the California
state drinking age. the editorial
faulted police officials for at
tempting to enforce it — "an
unwarranted and vile intrusion
into student life."
Police were also accused of
undermining the rational alcohol
policy developed by Residential
Education. I wonder on whose
authority Res Ed surpasses a
California police department in
the hierarchy of law enforce
ment?
While the intention of the edito
rial may have been to warn
against overgeneralization based
on an isolated incident, this point
was lost in the emphasis on
"irresponsible officials."
The argument became anal
ogous to protesting a speeding
ticket based on the fact that
"everybody does it." Work to
change the law. then, but don't
condemn the police for enforcing
it.
In spite of the debate over
whether or not individuals under
the age of 21 should have the
right to drink, the fact remains
that legally, they don't. On no
rational grounds can it be argued
that Stanford students are — or
should be — immune from the
law.
