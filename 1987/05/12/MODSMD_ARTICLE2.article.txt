# Students rally against racism
## 
### DIANE BISGEIER Senior staff writer 
Members of University minority
groups and Stanford Out of South
Africa (SOSA) yesterday staged a
White Plaza rally advocating di
vestment and a "non-racist Stan
ford."
"This rally is to challenge and
expose {University President
Donald) Kennedy's claim that
Stanford is the best or among the
best of the universities," said
senior Jeff Lowenstein of SOSA,
who added that Stanford's views
are "disrespectful and racist."
The Board of Trustees, mean
while, yesterday considered a se
ries of proposals that would, if
passed, lead to an increase in di
vestment and restrict University
South Africa-related investment
to companies that have high
ratings according to the Sullivan
Principles, a set of standards used
to assess the conduct of compan

ies doing business in South
Africa. The trustees will announce
their decision on the proposals
today.
Yesterday's rally featured
speakers from the Black Student
Union (BSU), the campus Chicano
group MeCHA and the Stanford
American Indian Organization
(SAIO). The event also included a
poetry reading by interactive poet
Rachel Bagby, who is also an asso
ciate director of the Martin Luther
King Papers Project.
"The rally is a great idea to get
people aware of the ideas the Rain
bow Agenda has put forth," said
junior Laura Bonk. The Rainbow
Agenda refers to a set of demands
made last week by a coalition of
campus minority groups.
At a press conference last Tues
day, the coalition demanded a
commission to study the quality of
minority life at Stanford, the de

velopment of an ethnic studies de
partment, the establishment of a
vice provost for minority affairs.
Increases in the number of
minority students admitted to the
University and the creation of a
campus multicultural center.
Freshman Lloyd Metz of the
BSU called Rainbow Agenda
demands for increased minority
enrollment and divestment
"echoes from the past."
"An echo of change Is haunting
Stanford," he said. "We must chal
lenge the hypocrisy and apathy
that the Centennial is all about."
Members of the Rainbow
Agenda were told in a meeting
with Vice Provost James Rosse
Friday that minority demands
would require further Investiga
tion by University officials.
"I think the rally will clear up
the misunderstandings in the
Stanford community," said fresh
man April House of the BSU.
"The rally is so the Administra
tion will take us seriously," she
said. "Some of the statements of
Kennedy and Rosse have led me to
believe that they will not make
changes." House said she worried
that University officials might not
pay attention to minority de
mands until "something ridicu
lous happens, similar to the Mar
tin Luther King assassination,
and that is really absurd."
"Stanford must change from a
University where students tell

blacks to go back to Africa' to one
where cultures are embraced and
celebrated." said Lowenstein, who
characterized Stanford's first cen
tury as one of "denial and disem
powerment" for minorities.
"Stanford has been filled with
actions which contradict quality
education and ethical standards
of behavior," he said.
After the rally about 50 people
marched to the Hoover Institu
tion. where the Board of Trustees
will meet today and tomorrow,
shouting slogans such as "Racism
here, apartheid there, we want
freedom everywhere."
"I find it very Ironic that a Uni
versity of this stature in the edu
cational area is afraid to learn
something," said Leslie Jackson
of the SAIO. "Our effort is going to
endure because the needs won't
go away unless (University offi
cials] get in the court with us and
play the same ball game," she
said.
"We're up against an en
trenched bureaucracy of the
Board of Trustees and the corpo
rations." said 1978 philosophy
graduate Kim McCall, who led the
Stanford Committee for a Respon
sible Investment Policy 10 years
ago In a campaign for divestment.
"The effect that I see is the sig
nificance of people taking each
other's issues seriously," said
McCall.
"These demands are immediate
and must be met along with a fun
damental shift in vision,"
Lowenstein said. "They should be
taken as a beginning, rather than
an end."
