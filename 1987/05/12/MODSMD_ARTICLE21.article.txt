### FELICIA PAIK Editorial staff 
When there is a celebration, everyone
likes to take part. And KRON-TV in San
Francisco is no different. KRON-TV is
joining in the festivities of this week's
Cornerstone Weekend and Centennial
celebration by airing a special one-hour
documentary about Stanford's history,
alumni and faculty.
"Stanford: A Sentimental Journey" is
the title of the program, which will be
shown tonight at 8 p.m. on Channel 4.
"The program is a history of Stanford
told in two different ways. It will include
the early history of Stanford with old file
photos and stills plus profiles of
graduates and faculty," said Pam Rorke-
Levy, producer of the documentary.
"The show does not look to the future,
but instead it's a look at the past — a look
at where the University has come from."
said Rorke-Levy.
The program features Interviews with
some of Stanford's more notable alumni,
such as Bill Hewlett, '34, and Sally Ride,
'73. Crews traveled extensively in order to
gather the necessary interviews, accord

lng to Rorke-Levy. Crews visited Washing
ton. D.C. to Interview Sandra Day
O'Connor, '50, and Alan Cranston. '36.
and traveled as far as Indonesia to talk to
one alumnus.
The production staffers spent literally
"hundreds of hours in Interviews around
the country, and they even took a special

trip to Jakarta to talk with one of our
alumni," according to Stephen Peeps, ex
ecutive director of the Centennial Operat
ing Committee and director of University
relations.
"We profiled people who had a strong
tradition in public service but we also
wanted to include someone who was not

doing it for the glory of the headlines,"
Rorke-Levy said.
Russ Dilts. who graduated from Stan
ford in 1974, went to Indonesia with the
Volunteers-in-Asia program and has
remained there, according to Rorke-Levy.
"He (Dilts) has lived and worked there
ever since [his graduation] — for 13 years,

so we went to Indonesia to talk to him
about his work," she said.
The documentary will also Include the
reminiscences of Stanford faculty, includ
ing Carl Djerassi, Clay Carson. Norman
Shumway and Sidney Drell.
The research for the program began in
December 1986 and is the culmination of
four months of work on the part of five
full-time staff members for the project.
"We spent every day for weeks and
weeks down there at Stanford," Rorke-
Levy said.
Rorke-Levy said it was a challenge to
decide the content of the program be
cause "we wanted the program to be in
formative for alumni — for those who
know a lot about the University — but we
also have to appeal to the mass audience
who may know little or nothing about
Stanford."
After the broadcast, the station will
donate to Stanford all rights to the docu
mentary for the University's future use as
well as valuable tape footage not Incor
porated into the documentary, according
to KRON-TV executive producer Robert
Klein.
