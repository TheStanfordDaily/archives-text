# More behind the scenes
## 
### 
What other career completely out
oj your field would you have
liked to pursue?
I would have liked to play
baseball, but my arm wasn't
strong enough. A sportscaster
would have been great, but I didn't
have any connections.
Who is a character in literature
you would like to be?
It would have to be the wife of
Bathe. She lived her life to the full
est with five spouses.
Are you happy?
Yes, especially since the Reagan
Library has gone to Southern Cali
fornia.
Do you have any regrets in your
life?
The ongoing regret I have is that
I don't keep up with my friends in
St. Louis and London.
What are your best and worst
qualities?
My best is that I have the
capacity to listen to people. My
worst is that I love martinis and
rich foods, especially Italian.
What is the most difficult part of

your job?
The fact that my work demands
seven days per week leaves me
with no genuine day off. Besides
preparing for class and research,
there seems to alv/ays be another
letter of recommendation (to
write).
What do you do for exercise?
I'm learning to swim in my 50s.
In addition I do aerobics and play
tennis.
Were you politically active in col
lege?
No, I was politically unaware.
Once I had to write an article for
the school newspaper on the out
set of the Korean War, and I had to
look up where Korea was. I was in
terested in trade unions, though.
What is the biggest joy in your
life?
Friendship and teaching. I love
it when class goes well.
What contemporary music do you
like?
Keith Jarrett, Charles Winston
as far as jazz goes. Certainly I still
love the Beatles.

Do you like English food?
It's abominable, especially food
in Oxford colleges. I don't envy the
Stanford students there.
What period of your life was most
enjoyable?
I'm a steadily enjoying person,
but I suppose the first two years I
spent studying at Oxford were the
most enjoyable.
What do you do in your leisure
time?
I go to ballets, concerts and
baseball — I can't resist a good
Giants game on TV. Of course I
also read.
What have Stanford students
taught you?
They teach me something
everyday. For instance, just the
other day a student showed me
that Shakespeare's Sonnet 73 had
a progression of light, something I
hadn't noticed before.
How has the Stanford undergrad
uate personality changed?
The students of the '60s were so
politically active. It is distressing
to see the students of the '70s and

'80s so depoliticized. Nothing ex
cept SOSA has happened politi
cally.
Would you ever leave Stanford
and go to another university?
I wouldn't rule out leaving Stan
ford. I would like to go to Colum
bia to be in New York City.
Do you feel Stanford is racially
integrated?
Definitely not. Chicanos are
vastly underrepresented.
In your opinion, what is Stan
ford's greatest asset?
A great teaching staff in
humanities.
Why did you choose to concen
trate on Shakespeare?
Shakespeare is the wisest
dramatist I have ever encoun
tered.
What do you think of the pres
sures to publish that are put on
teachers?
I find it very unfortunate be
cause it inevitably detracts from
teachers' commitments to teach
— it's a question of time.
