## Sunken Diamond to host West Regional 
### TOM SENF Senior staff writer 
Stanford will host the West 1 Regional
baseball tournament May 22 to May 25, the
NCAA announced today.
It will be the third time in the past five
years that Sunken Diamond has been a
regional site. In both 1983 and 1985, the
Cardinal made the home-field advantage
pay off by winning the regional and advanc
ing to the College World Series. This year's
Series will be played May 29 to June 7 in
Omaha, Neb.
Because the regional is an NCAA event,
students will not be admitted frc? as they
are during Stanford regular-season Co..
tests. All-session passes will go on sale
Friday at the Athletic Department ticket of
fice and can also be bought at Sunken Dia
mond during this weekend's series between
Stanford and USC.
The passes are *20 for adults and $ 12 for
students, faculty, staff, senior citizens and
children. Single-game tickets can only be
purchased prior to that particular game
and will cost >5 for adults and $3 for stu
dents.
On the first three days of the six-team,
double-elimination tournament, there will
be games at 9 a.m., 12:30 p.m. and 4 p.m.
The championship games will be played
Monday (Memorial Day) at noon and at 4
p.m., if necessary.
Stanford Coach Mark Marquess joined
the other five members of the selection com
mittee — Robert Hannah of Delaware, Larry
Cochell of Oral Roberts, David Hall of Rice,
Mike Martin of Florida State and Gene
McArtor of Missouri — in a conference call
yesterday morning.

In addition to Stanford, the committee
chose four other regional sites. Top-ranked
Texas will host the Central regional, and
Florida State, ranked eighth by Baseball
America and 14th by ESPN/Collegiate
Baseball will have the Atlantic.
The University of New Orleans, the No. 16
team in the nation, will host the South II
regional. The South 1 will be played in
Huntsville, Ala.
The 48-team NCAA tournament field and
the other three regional sites will be an
nounced next Monday after the final
weekend of regular-season play throughout
the country. Stanford assured itself of its
seventh consecutive berth by clinching the
Pacific 10 Southern Division last weekend.
The C? r dinal is currently ranked second by
Baseball America and sixth by
ESPN/Collegiate Baseball.
There will be probably be a West II
regional, and the most likely candidates to
host it are Arizona and Arizona State. The
Wildcats and Sun Devils are currently tied
for third in the Six-Pac at 13-14 and meet
this weekend in a three-game series in
Tempe.
The winner of that series will in all
likelihood get a regional berth, probably at
home. The loser will also go home, but
won't be playing. Last year Arizona finished
third in the Six-Pac, then rolled through
the Central regional at Texas en route to the
national title.
Card notes
Amid all the good news for Stanford in the past
few days came the sobering report that junior
designated hitter Jeff Saenger has been
sidelined for the season.
