# NCAA snubs netters
## Individual bids to McEnroe, Tarango 
### JON WEISMAN Staff writer 
With the New York Mets and
Louisville Cardinals having fal
tered in 1987, the Stanford men's
tennis team can find some com
pany to share its latest news with.
The defending national cham
pions were not invited to the
NCAA Championships in Athens,
Ga.. that begin Saturday, the first
time the Cardinal has been denied
a bid since 1982.
Two Stanford players made the
64-player field for the individual
singles championships, which
begin in Athens a week from
today, however: freshman Jeff
Tarango and junior Patrick
McEnroe. No Cardinal doubles
teams were selected for the 32-
team bracket.
Stanford was tied for 19th in
the latest poll and went on to
defeat California for the first time
in three tries, but was hurt be
cause the selection committee was
obliged to invite the top teams in
eight regions. Four of those teams
were ranked below the Cardinal.
"It looks like if we had beaten

Kentucky in the National Team In
doors (Feb. 21 in Louisville) we
would be in," Stanford Coach Dick
Gould said. "We had two of our top
four players injured. ... It just
really hurt us."
"Also, if we had beaten Cal one
of the other times we probably
would have made it," Gould said.
Overall, Stanford was 13-10 but
it had a 3-9 record against teams
invited to nationals. Five of those
matches Stanford played with two
starters out, and in only three
matches did Stanford lose by more
than two matches.
The seedings for the tourna
ment are as follows (with scores
against Stanford in parentheses):
1. USC (6-3, 6-3), 2. Long Beach
State (3-6), 3. Southern Method
ist, 4. Georgia, 5. Pepperdine, 6.
UCLA (8-1. 8-1), 7. South
Carolina, 8. Louisiana State, 9.
Texas. 10. Tennessee.
The second 10 are: Texas Chris
tian (5-3), California (5-4, 6-3, 4-
5), Clemson, Miami, UC-Irvine (5-
2), Kentucky (5-4), Michigan.
Colombia. Utah (3-6), Kansas.
Gould believes that Stanford
was probably the "21st team" on

that list, meaning that the Card
inal probably lost its chance at a
bid by not picking up one more
win against one of those teams.
"I guess it wasn't too unex
pected," senior Mark Jacobson
said about not receiving an invita
tion. "There's some disappoint
ment but we were pretty pessimis
tic (after the season ended). Maybe
it would have been more of a
surprise if we did get in."
The 1982 season, in which the
team finished 14th nationally,
was the first time Stanford had
finished out of the top-10 since
1968 (the second year of Gould's
tenure here), when it ended up
33rd.
Stanford ranks third in total
NCAA team championships won
with eight (UCLA has 15 and USC
has 12), and had captured the na
tional crown four of the last seven
years and six of the last nine.
McEnroe (14-6), a 1986 Ail-
American who was plagued by in
juries in 1987, was ranked 28th in

his third straight win over fourth
ranked Luke Jensen of USC. He
then defeated sixth-ranked Steve
DeVries in Stanford's last dual
match, against California May 1.
Tarango (23-8), who played at
the No. 1 slot for most of the

season, has beaten third-ranked
Rick Leach of USC and DeVries
this year. The Manhattan Beach
native, currently ranked 24th in
the nation, was also a finalist in
the Northern California Intercol
legiate singles at Berkeley.
Although McEnroe and Scott
Moody were ranked 21st and Jeff
Cathrall and Eric Peus were
ranked 41st in doubles competi
tion, neither team was invited to
Georgia.
