# Saenger makes the jump to major-college baseball
## 
### LINDA DODGE 
For Jeff Saenger. this year has been a
time to both swallow his pride and gain it
back again. As a junior in his first year on
the Stanford baseball team. Saenger
learned that on a team overflowing with
talent, confidence is the first thing to go.
He overcame his initial problems,
though, and was doing fine until he met
Paul Ellison. Ellison is the California
catcher with whom Saenger collided in
Thursday's game against the Golden
Bears. The result of the collision was that
Saenger was out — on the play and prob
ably for the rest of the season.
He was not visibly injured on the play,
but he noticed on his next trip to the plate
that he had no power in his left arm. The
coaches convinced him to see a doctor the
next day, and the diagnosis was a neck in
jury that will keep him from playing for at
least two weeks.
As a left-handed power hitter, Saenger
has been starting this season as the des
ignated hitter when Stanford faces right
handed pitching. He started 44 of Stan
ford's 54 games before he was injured,
hitting .353 overall, and. among the
regulars, a team-leading .415 in confer
ence play.
A pair of freshmen. Eric Cox and Brian
Johnson, will probably take Saenger's
place in the lineup while he is out. But
looking toward the weekend against USC
and the Regionals next week. Saenger's
experience against Pac-10 pitching will be
missed.
Originally from Alamo in the East Bay.
Saenger spent the first two years of his
college career at Occidental College in Los
Angeles, a Division 111 school with a
strong academic reputation. But the
baseball program was by no means com
parable to what he saw when he first
arrived at Stanford, and he didn't quite
know what to expect.
Defensive plays that would have
amazed coaches In Division 111 seemed
routine at Stanford. In Saenger's first day

of practice here, sophomore Ed Sprague
was at third base and Saenger was cover
ing first. The hitter during batting
practice hit a line shot over Sprague's
head, or so Saenger thought.
"I said to myself. 'No way is he going to
make that play,' but Sprague gets to the
ball, throws it, and I'm standing there five
feet off the bag," Saenger recalls with a
sense of self-admonition.
He cites this as one of his first experi
ences with the higher quality of baseball
that is played at Stanford. He began fall
practice with no hopes at all of starting,
an opinion that the coaches evidently
shared. He was given a coach's number,
which at first he "thought was neat," un
til he realized that It was only because he
could not expect to play.
It was also hard, because, he says:"The
team doesn't accept you at first, until you
come into your own. They ignore you in
the beginning, until you prove yourself.
But then. 1 started to get ribbed, and it
was OK."
Saenger enjoyed a surprisingly produc
tive fall season, which he attributes
mostly to luck, and the coaches realized
that they had to play him. "I wanted to be
in the position where I wanted them to
have to play me." he says. "Like most of
the guys who come here. I've never been
benched in my life."
At a slender 6-foot-4, Saenger has a first
baseman's reach, and originally he was
projected to challenge sophomore Ron
Witmeyer for the job at first base. But this
year he never took the field-
According to Coach Mark Marquess,
"DH is really his best position. In order for
him to be at first, we would have to move
Witmeyer to the outfield. I do not know if
we are ready to do that, but the bottom
line is. Saenger has to have a place in the
lineup."
Like all players, Saenger would like to
be out there on defense too. but, he ex
plains: "I realize my position on the team,
but DH-ing is hard, because you are only
in half of the game. If you strike out. you

go back to the bench and think about it. If
you are out playing defense, you have to
forget about it."
And this may explain Saenger's slight
violent streak He appears articulate and
rational, the kind of guy who spends his
spare time thinking about things instead
of watching them idly go by. But action
takes the place of thought when it Is his
turn at bat.
Take last Thursday's collision, for ex
ample. Saenger rounded third, on his way
to the plate, and he was clearly out by at
least 10 feet. So he did the best thing he
could do — hit the catcher, not with his
shoulders turned toward him, but. like
the most feared car accident, he hit him
head — and neck — on.
The result was a pinched nerve in his

neck that will keep him out for at least
two weeks, and maybe for the rest of the
season. This means that, at best, Saenger
will be out of the lineup until the College
World Series, which begins May 29.
But even before his accident. Saenger
had been known to punch things —
dugout walls in particular — after rough
trips to the plate. But. he adds seriously:
"I know I have to stop doing that (when I
come back). I don't want to end up with a
broken hand too. but I'm just a very emo
tional. aggressive ballplayer. I get mad be
cause I am still not used to the peaks and
valleys of hitting."
Which, looking at his stats at Occiden
tal. is understandable.
Saenger was a Division 111 All-America
his freshman year when he hit .450. His

sophomore year he hit .400 as well, which
does not leave much room for valleys be
tween the peaks.
Instead of being satisfied with his suc
cess. Saenger began looking elsewhere,
and it was during his sophomore year at
"Oxy" that he realized he had outgrown
the system. His role on the team had
progressed to that of a fourth coach, and
he was not left with much room to grow.
Marquess says that Saenger recruited
Stanford, instead of the other way
around. "He is my great recruiting coup,"
Marquess says."He called me up after he
was admitted, and asked about being on
the team. We had a first baseman who

Jeff Saenger had reason to celebrate when he was healthy and leading the Cardi ,ial in hitting in the Six-Pac.
