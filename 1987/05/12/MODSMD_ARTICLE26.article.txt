# Fencing Coach Hurst fired despite successful record
## Cites personality clash with AD 
### CHRIS CRADER Staff writer 
The Stanford fencing program, which has twice
fought off severe funding cutbacks in the past four
years, has now lost Coach Buzz Hurst, whose con
tract was not renewed for next year.
The decision came as a shock to all, as Hurst had
been at Stanford for eight years and was no stranger
to success. He has compiled a 121-23 record in his
four years as head coach for a .840 winning
percentage and took his teams to top-10 national
finishes five times and had six NCAA Western
Regional championships.
Athletic Director Andy Geiger refused to comment
on the reasons for the firing, saying only that Hurst
"will not be reappointed." He added that fencing will
continue as a sport here and that the department is
running a search for a replacement, but that the
search will "take some time."
Geiger did not name any candidates being consid
ered for the opening.
Hurst said he thought the firing was due to a
"personality conflict" between him and Geiger. He
said he was told of his dismissal in a conference he
had requested with Geiger to discuss the idea of bid
ding to host the NCAA championships next year and
the fencing program's funding. "This is not a cul
mination of interviews," said Hurst, saying that the
news came "out of the blue.
"I find it distressing, that, given the record that my
fencing teams have established, and through the
awareness for minor sports that the fencing program
has engendered, that really the least I, or anyone else
in my position, could expect is that an honest, pro

fessional effort to resolve the personality conflict
should have been attempted before a death sentence
was imposed," he said.
Hurst added he has not been given a reason for the
action, but that he suspected Geiger had reacted to
complaints from a fencer a few years back. "His view,
as I see it. is I brutalized and emotionally ravished
most of the fencers," Hurst said, noting that he
hasn't heard directly of these complaints. He also
wondered about the validity of any criticism, and
how he would be able to achieve so much success
with a supposedly disgruntled team.
Due to the lateness of the Athletic Department s
notice, Hurst will receive next year's salary as
severance pay. He plans to take some time off, but
thinks he will eventually work in fencing again in
some capacity.
Hurst said he will miss Stanford. "You can't work
with a program and take it from where it was to our
present level and not feel a certain attachment to it
and care for it, as well as the school it represents,' he
said. However, he added that "Given the circum
stances, it is the best solution we could arrive at."
This year, the women's team won the regional title
for the fourth straight year and advanced to the
NCAAs, as did seniors Holly Taylor and Alyson Yarus
in the individual competition. On the men's side,
seniors Steve Levitan and Larry Murk, and junior
Mike Cramer all advanced to nationals.
In 1985-86, the men went 21-1 and the women
were 14 0 and both won regionals on their way to
14th- and sixth-place finishes, respectively, at na
tionals. The women were also undefeated in 1983-
84, and the year before. Hurst's first year as head
coach, both teams placed in the top eight at NCAAs.
