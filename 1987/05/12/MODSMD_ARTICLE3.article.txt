# Police complete investigation of drowning

### JOHN LIS Editorial staff 
Stanford police have finished their inves
tigation into the drowning death three
weeks ago of junior David Dunshee and
have turned the results over to the Santa
Clara District Attorney's Office, Chief Mar
vin Herrington said yesterday.
Herrington said Dunshee drowned in
Lagunita around 1 a.m. April 22 after
having attended a Rush party of the Zeta
Psi fraternity, of which he was a Rush
chairman. He apparently fell into the lake
while intoxicated and was unable to swim

to safety.
"We've predicated that assumption on the
basis of statements made to us," Her
rington said. "We won't know for certain
until the coroner's report with his blood al
cohol count is released. That won't change
anything. It will just verify that he was un
der the influence," he said.
A spokeswoman for the Santa Clara
Coroner's Office said Friday a coroner's
report in the case will be completed in two
to four weeks.
Herrington said the police investigative
report contains the names of the persons
who purchased the alcohol that the 20-year

old Dunshee consumed at the party.
"If there are any charges, the DA will han
dle it," Herrington said. "If the DA chooses
not to charge anyone, that's the end of it."
Asst. District Attorney Ron Rico could not
be reached for comment yesterday. Both
Herrington and Mike Klinn, the lawyer for
Zeta Psi, have said charges are unlikely.
Any criminal charges filed in the case would
be for providing alcohol to a minor, a much
less serious charge than selling alcohol to a
minor.
California law prohibits sale or consump
tion of alcohol by anyone under 21 years of
age, and also forbids providing alcohol to

such an individual.
Dunshee was first reported missing by
his roommate April 23 around 8 p.m., 43
hours after he was last seen by Zete Presi
dent Neil Hanson and Zete member Phil
Klein. His body was removed from the lake
at 4 p.m. the next day, after police called in
a California Highway Patrol helicopter to
aid in the search.
The University has commissioned its own
report on Dunshee's death, which is being
conducted by Assistant to the Provost Mi
chael Jackson. That report is expected to
cause University officials to review and pos
sibly amend Stanford's alcohol policy.
