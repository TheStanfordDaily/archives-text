# Won't affect bid acceptances, officers say
## Fraternities assess impact of drowning 
### MARCUS MABRY Senior staff writer 
Campus fraternity officers do not believe the
alcohol-related drowning of a Stanford frater
nity member last month and the recent in
crease in enforcement of California drinking
laws by Stanford Police will have a direct effect
on the ability of Greek houses to fill their
residence quotas. But the officers disagree on
more subtle, long-term effects of the recent
events.
Each fraternity has a University-imposed
quota of men that it must pledge in order to
retain University housing. At this point, not all
of the fraternities have filled this quota.
Junior David Dunshee drowned April 22 in
Lagunita shortly after he left a Zeta Psi Rush
party. A police report issued Friday confirmed
that he had been drinking heavily prior to the
drowning.
Police enforcement of state laws prohibiting
those under 21 from drinking alcohol has in
creased subsequent to the drowning. Stanford
Police entered campus parties May 1 and 2 and
instructed bartenders to serve only those stu
dents with identificaton proving they are of le
gal age. In addition, police have more fre
quently asked students walking on campus
with drinks to prove their age.
Beta Theta Pi President Tom Walsh said bid
acceptance at the Betas "has been a little off
this year." He was not willing to release the ex
act number of bids issued or accepted, and
cautioned that "at this point it's kind of hard
to tell" how many men will take their bids.
"Here, the bid acceptance doesn't usually
happen right away. Right now it's at 25 per
cent, but I'm sure that will increase a lot."

Walsh said he was not sure why bid accep
tance was down and would not attribute it
completely either to the drowning or to in
creased police enforcement of alcohol laws on
campus.
However. Walsh said, "I would think that
(both factors) would have some influence on
people considering fraternities. 1 don't think
they've helped any."
According to Theta Delta Chi President
Robin Vasan, bid acceptance at his fraternity
is keeping pace with last year. He reported that
17 men have accepted bids and that the Theta
Delts would make their quota.
Vasan said that any low bid-acceptance rates
reported at other fraternities are "surprising."
He said, however, that the drowning and
police enforcement have affected the fraternity
system greatly. "You would think that any
negative media would put people against it
(the fraternity system)," he said.
"I don't feel that current members were as af
fected as someone who was thinking about
joining a house," Vasan said.
He added that uncertainty over the future of
a fraternity would make a student less likely to
join it.
Other fraternities report that bid acceptance
rates have not been affected at all by the
drowning or increased alcohol enforcement.
Sigma Alpha Epsilon (SAE) President John
Palmer said his fraternity issued bids to 32
rushees last week and has thus far received 30
acceptances.
"1 don't think those issues have affected our
bid acceptance because I don't think people
join our fraternity on those grounds," he said.
"People who join (our fraternity) use other

criteria. They don't particularly look at the al
cohol policy.'*
"It comes down to whether they think its
going to be a good place to live. Alcohol does
not play a large role in that decision," Palmer
said.
He said potential SAE members take into ac
count several "secondary"' considerations
before joining, including the types of activities
in the house, its location and the living condi
tions.
Although SAE has not been affected this
year, Palmer said it is still too early to deter
mine what the ultimate effect of the student
death and police alcohol enforcement will be
on fraternities as a whole.
Fraternal Affairs Adviser Joe Pisano said it
will be difficult to assess the long-term impact
of the drowning on the fraternity system at
Stanford until the end of the summer when all
fraternities have reported final bid acceptance
figures to the Office of Fraternal Affairs.
If a fraternity fails to fill its quota in three of
four consecutive years University officials un
dertake a review of the future housed status of
that fraternity, according to Pisano.
He emphasized that if any one fraternity fails
to meet its quota it will not be penalized if the
fraternities as a whole do not fall below their
total aggregate "housing burden" of 13 percent
of existing male guaranteed students.
Pisano added that the drowning and subse
quent police measures to crack down on
campus underage drinking have had an effect
on fraternities "in that they have driven home
the facts to people and have made them more
aware of the reality of having alcohol on
campus."
