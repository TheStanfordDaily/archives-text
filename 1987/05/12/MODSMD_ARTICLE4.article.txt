Overseas Studies organizers are
choosing a site somewhere in
Latin America for Stanford's first
campus in the Third World, ac
cording to Anthropology Prof.
George Collier.
The new program could open as
early as 1988, said Collier, direc
tor of Latin American Studies. Or
ganizers are considering sites in
Mexico City, Santiago, Caracas,
Quito and Sao Paulo.
The "problems that Latin
America faces are immediate to

us," said Medical School Prof.
Elois Berlin, who is a member of
the Latin America Panel, a Univer
sity committee formed to plan the
Latin American campus.
"Where else can Stanford pro
vide a better education on prob
lems of underdevelopment," said
William Durham, panel chair and
associate professor of anthropol
ogy and human biology.
The Latin America Panel, which
was appointed by the University
last September, is polling stu
dents in Spanish and Portuguese
classes about their preferences re
garding a site for the campus.

After considering the "vast
regional differences in Latin
America,"the panel will choose a
site, hopefully by the end of this
year, according to Thomas Heller,
director of Overseas Studies.
The panel wants student and
faculty input on the proposals and
will host an all-campus forum
Wednesday at Yost House.
The site decision will be based
on the availability of "human and
institutional resources" at each
possible location. Collier said.
Heller said the creation of a
Latin American center is not tied

to the closing of Stanford's Vienna
campus. That closing is designed
to help improve the quality of
centers within Europe, particu
larly Berlin, by concentrating re
sources, Heller said.
Heller said the creation of a
Latin American center represents
a new University commitment to
student opportunity for study in
other parts of the world.
"The idea is to encourage as
many Stanford students as possi
ble to spend parts of their careers
overseas," he said.
Students in the program will
live in the community, either with

local families or in dormitories.
They will definitely not live in "an
enclave," Heller said. The cost of
the program should be the same
as regular Stanford tuition. Heller
said.
Unlike most other Stanford
overseas programs, study at the
Latin America center would in
clude coursework for graduate as
well as undergraduate students.
About 10 of the 35 to 40 partici
pants would be graduate stu
dents, Collier added.
