# Latin America campus moves toward reality
## 
### ELAINE LU Staff writer 
Overseas Studies organizers are
choosing a site somewhere in
Latin America for Stanford's first
campus in the Third World, ac
cording to Anthropology Prof.
George Collier.
The new program could open as
early as 1988, said Collier, direc
tor of Latin American Studies. Or
ganizers are considering sites in
Mexico City, Santiago, Caracas,
Quito and Sao Paulo.
The "problems that Latin
America faces are immediate to

us," said Medical School Prof.
Elois Berlin, who is a member of
the Latin America Panel, a Univer
sity committee formed to plan the
Latin American campus.
"Where else can Stanford pro
vide a better education on prob
lems of underdevelopment," said
William Durham, panel chair and
associate professor of anthropol
ogy and human biology.
The Latin America Panel, which
was appointed by the University
last September, is polling stu
dents in Spanish and Portuguese
classes about their preferences re
garding a site for the campus.

After considering the "vast
regional differences in Latin
America,"the panel will choose a
site, hopefully by the end of this
year, according to Thomas Heller,
director of Overseas Studies.
The panel wants student and
faculty input on the proposals and
will host an all-campus forum
Wednesday at Yost House.
The site decision will be based
on the availability of "human and
institutional resources" at each
possible location. Collier said.
Heller said the creation of a
Latin American center is not tied

to the closing of Stanford's Vienna
campus. That closing is designed
to help improve the quality of
centers within Europe, particu
larly Berlin, by concentrating re
sources, Heller said.
Heller said the creation of a
Latin American center represents
a new University commitment to
student opportunity for study in
other parts of the world.
"The idea is to encourage as
many Stanford students as possi
ble to spend parts of their careers
overseas," he said.
Students in the program will
live in the community, either with

local families or in dormitories.
They will definitely not live in "an
enclave," Heller said. The cost of
the program should be the same
as regular Stanford tuition. Heller
said.
Unlike most other Stanford
overseas programs, study at the
Latin America center would in
clude coursework for graduate as
well as undergraduate students.
About 10 of the 35 to 40 partici
pants would be graduate stu
dents, Collier added.
The inclusion of graduate stu
dents will allow for a larger pool of
student applicants. Collier said.
Whereas undergraduates major
ing in fields such as international
relations, biology, anthropology
and history have expressed a defi
nite interest in a Latin American
overseas center, there are very few
undergraduates specifically ma
joring in Latin American studies,
Collier said. "So many of the
people interested in Latin Ameri
can studies are at the graduate

level," he said.
Heller said that the graduate
students who participate in the
program will not replace under
graduates, but rather will receive
"advantageous ways to pursue
their own work."
Heller further noted that
graduate students "can be ex
tremely useful in improving un
dergraduate education" as tutors,
section leaders or mediators be
tween undergraduates and staff.
The panel has proposed that the
undergraduate curriculum at the
center be centered around the
theme of "Dilemmas of Develop

ment in the Third World." Follow
ing this theme, most courses
would be taught by native profes
sors in three basic areas: the
causes of poverty and under
development, the consequences of
poverty and underdevelopment
and the society and culture of
Latin America.
The program will consist of
three quarters of coursework at
the center and an optional exten
sion of one quarter of fieldwork.
internships or research with fac
ulty. Heller said the small-group
focus of the fieldwork will help to
bring students out of the class

room.
Heller said introductory courses
would also be offered on Latin
American history and culture.
The panel carefully designed the
curriculum to make it broad and
as attractive to as many students
as possible, Berlin said.
Heller said that the establish
ment of a Stanford overseas center
in Latin America carries unique
difficulties, especially in the area
of politics. In creating the center,
a major American institution like
Stanford can become the object of
political discussion in Latin
America, Heller said.
