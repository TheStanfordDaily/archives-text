# Stanford Engineering attracts top students
## Seeks to boost female and minority enrollment 
### JOHN POLLACK Senior staff writer 
Stanford's School of Engineering has
been attracting a large proportion of the na
tion's top engineering students and faculty
for the past several years, but women and
minorities remain underrepresented in the
school, according to a recent report.
In the report. Dean James Gibbons, a
professor of electrical engineering, said the
quality of the school compares favorably
with other top engineering schools, such as
the University of Illinois, the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology and UC-Berkeley.
For each of the past five years, over 80
percent of the nation's top 50 engineering
students have enrolled in Stanford engi
neering graduate programs. Gibbons said.
He attributed this in part to heavy recruit
ing efforts.
As a measure of the Stanford engineering
faculty's high quality. Gibbons cited the
number of senior faculty members in the
school who belong to the prestigious Na
tional Academy of Engineers (NAE).
"We have the largest percentage of (NAE)
membership of any university in the
country," Gibbons said. According to the
report. 21.9 percent of the Stanford engi
neering faculty belonged to the NAE in
1985. Gibbons said this figure will increase

to almost 26 percent this year.
"We have a senior faculty of extraor
dinarily high quality, a very valuable and
precious resource," he said.
Gibbons, who presented his report at last
Thursday's Faculty Senate meeting, also
praised the engineering school's junior fac
ulty. many of whom have been selected as
Presidential Young Investigators (PYls).
Gibbons said the PYI distinction is only
awarded to "the most extraordinary faculty
in universities and schools of engineering
across the country."
He noted, however, that there are too few
women on the engineering faculty here. Ac
cording to the report, there are only eight
fully tenured female professors in the
school, comprising only 5.9 percent of the
school's faculty. This figure is significantly
lower than the 10.3 percent of fully tenured
female professors in the University as a
whole.
Gibbons told the senate that the engi
neering school hopes to correct this prob
lem.
"We share with you the goal of increasing
the number of women and minority faculty
across the University and within the school
(of engineering) in particular," he said.
The School of Engineering is slightly
