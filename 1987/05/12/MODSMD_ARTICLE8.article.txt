Thatcher to run for third term
LONDON — Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, seeking to
become the first British prime minister in more than a century to
win a third consecutive term, announced yesterday that a general
election will be held June 11.
Opinion polls give Thatcher's Conservative Party a comfortable
lead over the Labor Party, its principal opposition, and she is re
garded as more than likely to succeed.
"1 hope to go on and on." Thatcher, 61. told a television inter
viewer following the election announcement. "I believe pas
sionately in our policies, and I believe they are right for Britain."
Her three-sentence announcement, issued to reporters waiting
outside the prime minister's residence on Downing Street, ended
months of speculation about the timing of the election.
The election comes almost exactly a year before the end of her
present five-year term. She decided on an early election after
meeting Sunday with her political advisers and reviewing her
party's strength after last week's convincing showing in local elec
tions.
She informed her cabinet of the decision yesterday morning and
then, just after midday, traveled the short distance across St.
James's Park to Buckingham Palace to inform Queen Elizabeth 11.
She then issued the public statement.
Campaigning will begin in earnest after Parliament is officially
dissolved next Monday.
Klaus Barbie trial opens in France
LYON, France — Former Gestapo lieutenant Klaus Barbie iden
tified himself at the opening of his trial yesterday as Klaus
Altmann, the name given to him by the U.S. Army almost 40 years
ago to protect him from prosecution.
There were some low whistles, in Europe a sign of derision,
from the packed courtroom, and lawyers for the plaintiffs quickly
arose to challenge Barbie.
But it was soon clear that Barbie was not trying to hide the fact
that he was head of the Gestapo, the Nazi secret police, in Lyon
during World War 11. Speaking softly in both German and French,
he acknowledged that his father's name was Nikolaus Barbie, that
he had used the name Altmann only since 1951, and that it had
become his legal name only in 1957 when he was naturalized as a
Bolivian citizen.
Pierre Truche, the prosecutor, quickly cut short the argument
by telling the court:"I understand why carrying the name Barbie
is such a heavy burden for him now. But he is not denying that he
is the same person who carried the name of Klaus Barbie in 1943
and 1944."
Barbie, 73. who is expected to speak out in his defense later in
the week, listened attentively as a clerk of the court began to read
out a long statement of charges and evidence against him. The
reading, which may take six hours to complete, is expected to be
finished today.
Council probes Meese-Wedtech ties
WASHINGTON — An independent counsel yesterday launched a
probe of the ties between Attorney General Edwin Meese and
scandal-torn Wedtech Corp., and investigators told the Los An
geles Times that a key question is whether Meese received any
money or other special consideration for helping the defense con
tractor.
Meese himself called for such an investigation shortly before
court-appointed special counsel James McKay announced that he
was beginning it. The attorney general said that he was confident
that it will show that he has acted "entirely properly and lawfully."
McKay's probe came at the request of Deputy Attorney General
Arnold Burns, who has been serving as acting attorney general in
connection with the Wedtech matter since Meese removed himself
from any official role in the case April 8.
Burns cited Meese's "personal and/or financial relationships"
with several people connected with the New York company in
seeking the outside examination. Wedtech has been accused in
both federal and state investigations of using illegal inducements
to get federal contracts.
"In fairness to Mr. Meese, I should state that the reports we have
received concerning Mr. Meese's relationships with Wedtech
associated individuals and entities are only fragmentary and do
not show that Mr. Meese ever received any compensation" from
the company, "nor that he ever invested" in Wedtech stock, Burns
said.
Genscher discusses arms proposal
WASHINGTON — West German Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich
Genscher conferred here yesterday about a Soviet proposal to
eliminate medium-range nuclear missiles from Europe and said
the United States and its North Atlantic Treaty Organization allies
still are weighing a response.
West Germany's views are pivotal to further progress on an
agreement because the Reagan administration, while reportedly
eager for a deal, has delayed a commitment pending full consulta
tions with NATO allies.
However, West Germany's center-right coalition government is
divided about the Soviet call for eliminating from East and West
Europe all missiles with a range of 600 to 3,000 miles — a cate
gory covering Soviet SS-20s and U.S. cruise and Pershing II
missiles.
Genscher's Free Democratic Party, the coalition's junior
partner, supports an accord. But Chancellor Helmut Kohl's
majority Christian Democrats are uneasy about a part of the So
viet proposal calling for elimination of missiles with a range of 300
to 600 miles.
They have expressed concern that this would leave West Ger
many. whose territory forms NATO's front line, especially vulner
able to the Soviet-led Warsaw Pact's overwhelming superiority in
conventional forces. Other NATO members, including Britain and
France, also have reservations about the shorter-range missile
provisions.
Philippine election very peaceful
MANILA, Philippines — The Philippine nation turned out in
near-record numbers yesterday in what both President Corazon
Aquino and her opponents agreed was the country's most peaceful
and orderly national election in more than two decades.
Sketchy and unofficial returns today indicated that most of
Aquino's 24 pro-administration candidates for a new national
senate were leading over two opposition coalition slates, one led by
popular right-wing leader Juan Ponce Enrile and the other by
prominent political leftists.
National Election Commissioner Ramon Felipe, however, said
yesterday evening that the candidates will not be officially
proclaimed for at least a week, and schoolteachers and election of
ficials nationwide labored through the night and into today morn
ing. manually tabulating the more than 20 million handwritten
ballots for a senate elected at-large and 200 locally elected House
seats.
Felipe said voter turnout exceeded 80 percent, and as early as
yesterday night, most political analysts and Aquino herself were
proclaiming that the national legislative elections were a major po
litical victory for the president.
