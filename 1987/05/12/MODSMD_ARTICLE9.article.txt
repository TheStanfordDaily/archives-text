# North planned document-shredding

WASHINGTON - Fired White
House aide Oliver North confessed
last year that he attempted to
destroy every official document
that could have revealed the diver
sion of Iran arms sale profits to
the contras — but that he missed
one. former national security advi
ser Robert McFarlane said yester
day.
McFarlane told the House and
Senate investigating committees
that North realized last November,
as the Reagan administration's
secret arms deals with Iran began
to unravel, that the diversion of
money to Nicaragua's contra
rebels could damage President
Reagan if it were revealed.
Before other officials discovered
the diversion. North told him that
he planned to hold a "shredding
party" to destroy the evidence,
McFarlane said.
"He thought that the president
was in a very solid position, and
that there was only one matter
that concerned him — and it was
the matter of the channeling of
funds to the contras," McFarlane
said.
"What did he tell you about a
shredding party?" asked Arthur
Liman, chief counsel for the Sen
ate select committee on the scan
dal.
"Just that there had to be one,"
McFarlane answered.
Later, after Attorney General
Edwin Meese publicly revealed the
diversion of funds and President
Reagan abruptly fired North,
McFarlane said that he telephoned
North and asked him what had
gone wrong.
"Ollie, it was approved, wasn't
it?" McFarlane quoted himself as
asking.
"Yes, Bud, it was approved. You
know I wouldn't do anything that
wasn't approved," North replied,
according to McFarlane.
"Then don't worry," McFarlane
said. "You did the right thing.
Just tell it like it was."
McFarlane then asked North
how the diversion had been dis
covered.
"They must have found the
memo," he quoted North as
saying.
"Did he say, 'I missed one'?"

asked Liman.
"Yes." McFarlane answered.
The document that disclosed
the diversion was a memo that
North wrote in April 1986 propos
ing a sale of weapons to Iran to
generate >12 million in "residual
funds" for the contras.
The memo was discovered by
Justice Department officials who
searched the National Security
Council files on Nov. 22 — one day
after North and his secretary.
Fawn Hall, destroyed thousands of
other documents in North's office,
according to knowledgeable
sources.
Hall has already told inves
tigators that North ordered her to
shred some documents and to
alter others, the sources have
said. McFarlane's testimony cor
roborated the secretary's account
and appeared to strengthen any
possible criminal case against
North for obstructing justice
through destroying the evidence.
McFarlane said that he did not
ask North who had approved the
diversion of funds to the contras.
McFarlane had left the govern
ment in December 1985, before
the diversion occurred, but his
successor. Rear Adm. John Poin
dexter, who was North's boss, has
acknowledged approving the di
version, according to the
presidentially appointed Tower
commission. Reagan has denied
giving his approval.
McFarlane said that he did not
mention the diversion or North's
reference to a "shredding party" to
anyone else — even though he was
interviewed about the scandal by
Meese on Nov. 21, hours before
North and Hall destroyed the doc
uments.
"(Meese) was asking the ques
tions," McFarlane explained.
"Perhaps it was something I
should have told him. We dis
cussed it two days later" — after
the documents had been
destroyed.
McFarlane described North as a
man who "ran very far with the
ball" and sometimes exceeded or
ders in carrying out a mission.
McFarlane said that North had
devised several potentially illegal
schemes for funding the contras.

written "lurid" memos to promote
his proposals and sometimes mis
represented his own wishes as
coming from McFarlane or Reagan
himself.
North "always responded to firm
guidance," McFarlane said, but
also would "probably, on occasion,
go beyond. I could foresee that."
In 1985, North told McFarlane
that he had not solicited any
private funds for the contras — an
assertion that has since been
proven false. But on the basis of
North's promises, McFarlane per
sonally assured Congress that the
NSC staff was not soliciting aid.
"Looking back, I think that . . .
suspicions that I had ought to
have led me to be more probing," a

chastened McFarlane admitted.
But McFarlane still had warm
words for his former protege. "1
thought surely Ollie was probably
the most mission-oriented, can-do
professional on the staff." he said.
In 1986, McFarlane wrote to
North: "If the world only knew how
many times you have kept a
semblance of gumption and integ
rity to U.S. policy, they would
make you secretary of state."
Asked about that message Mon
day. McFarlane appeared to wince.
"Some of these communications
were to build morale." he said. "It
involves a certain amount of hy
perbole. Los Angeles Times
