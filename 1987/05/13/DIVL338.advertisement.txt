GRADSI^i
Drive into your
future in a
brand new
Buick!
Mo credit necessary?
Graduating within 6 months?
Or did you graduate within the past
Buy a brand new Smythe Buick without
established credit!
Here's the fine print: (1) No credit record is no problem
—a bad credit record is a no-no. (2) You need a firm
commitment for a job. (3) The monthly payment
must not exceed 20% of your monthly net income.
That's it!
Then, choose either a
$400 "Graduate Rebate"
(In addition to any other applicable GMAC rebate!
Use as part of your down payment or anyway you
wish!)
or make no payment for
90 days!
For a personal appointment,
call: (408) 983-5300
You don't have to make an appointment, of course.
Just drop in. But, call ahead, and we'll have a sales
representative available just for you. Learn about
Graduate First Time Buyer Program and which
new Buick is just right for you.
