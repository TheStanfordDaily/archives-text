# McFarlane: Reagan set up funding
## 
### 
WASHINGTON - Former White House na
tional security adviser Robert McFarlane said
yesterday that President Reagan personally in
tervened with a foreign leader to ensure that
the Nlcaraguan contras received weapons at a
time Congress had barred U.S. military aid.
His testimony also suggested that a private
conversation with Reagan prompted King
Fahd of Saudi Arabia to double his secret con
tribution to the contras during the same per
iod.
McFarlane's account, before House and Sen
ate committees investigating the Iran-contra
scanal, called into question Reagan's repeated
denials that he was Involved in obtaining
private military aid for the rebels or that he
knew his aides were involved.
In fact, it was at Reagan's insistence that the
administration continued to help the contras
after Congress cut off aid, McFarlane said. "He
did not intend to break faith with the contras.
He directed that we make continued efforts to
bring the movement into the good graces of
Congress and the American people and that we
assure the contras of continuing administra
tion support — to help them hold body and

soul together — until the time when Congress
would again agree to support them."
McFarlane's five hours of testimony provided
the most direct evidence to date implicating
the president In the network of private aid that
sustained the contras after Congress cut off
U.S. funds In October 1984. Soliciting military
aid would have violated the Boland Amend
ment, which barred direct or indirect military
aid by U.S. intelligence agencies.
McFarlane also said that Reagan personally
approved a plan to pay millions of dollars in
ransom to free the American hostages being
held in Beirut. The ransom was provided by
Texas billionaire Ross Perot, with some funds
for "expenses" of Drug Enforcement Agency of
ficials involved being donated by the contras.
The scheme failed, and the money was
returned to Perot.
At the time, Reagan was publicly denounc
ing the idea of paying ransom or even negotiat
ing with the kidnappers.
Most damaging of all was McFarlane's dis
closure that Reagan called the leader of a
Central American country — identified by con

gressional sources as Honduras — to ask for
release of a warehouse of weapons the contras
had purchased that had been seized by a mili
tary commander. The weapons were then sent
to the rebels, he said.
In addition, McFarlane suggested that
Reagan's private conversation In February
1985 with King Fahd of Saudi Arabia resulted
In the Saudis' doubling their secret *1 million
a-month contribution to the contras.
McFarlane's assistant, Lt. Col. Oliver North,
had reported that most of the Saudi money
was being used for weapons, although they
had contributed it ostensibly as a
humanitarian gesture.
McFarlane said that he didn't know whether
Reagan discussed the contras' funding prob
lems during the one-on-one meeting with the
king. But the Saudis called McFarlane a day or
so afterward to advise him their contribution
would be increased. And when the national se
curity adviser told the president, "His reaction
(was). . . one of. . . gratitude and satisfaction,
not of surprise," McFarlane said.
