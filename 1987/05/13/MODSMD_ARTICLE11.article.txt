# Japan program delayed one year
## 
### MARK ROGOWSKY Staff writer 
Putting an end to months of speculation
about the Stanford center in Japan, Overseas
Studies Director Thomas Heller announced
yesterday that the center in Kyoto will open for
the 1988-89 academic year.
The program was scheduled to begin next
year, but was delayed because of cost consider
ations and problems with selecting a site. Hel
ler said.
Heller elaborated on several specific reasons
for the delay.
The first problem was cost, he said. The 40
percent decline in the value of the dollar
against the yen has made it more expensive
than ever before for countries to do business in
Japan.
The second obstacle was finding an appro
priate site, given the scarcity of available land
in Japan, according to Heller. Kyoto was cho

sen over Tokyo because students may find the
size of Tokyo intimidating, he said. Land is
also less expensive in Kyoto.
Heller also said students in Kyoto will have a
better opportunity to see the historical and
cultural side to Japan, while having easy
access to the technologically-advanced Japan
of today.
The center will be divided Into two parts: the
Kyoto Center for Japanese Studies (KCJS) and
the Stanford Center for Technology and Inno
vation (SCTI). The programs will have different
goals and different requirements for admis
sion.
The KCJS program will open in autumn
1988. It will be a yearlong program for stu
dents with at least one year of study in
Japanese, Heller said.
Thirty students from nine American univer
sities — including Stanford. Harvard and Yale
— will study a wide range of topics in the
humanities and social sciences, Heller said.

The SCTI program will be very different. It
will begin In spring 1989, and students will
need only two quarters of Japanese to be eligi
ble. In the spring, they will study issues such
as the behavior of Japanese firms. Japanese
perspectives on the international political eco
nomy and the relationship between technol
ogy, culture and the economy In Japan.
The program, which will be open to Stanford
students only, will also include summer In
ternships. Heller has contacted Japanese and
American multinational corporations in many
fields, including computer science, biotechnol
ogy and investment banking.
These companies have expressed much in
terest in the program and will probably provide
housing and meals for students who partici
pate. However, the salaries will not be substan
tial, Heller said.
Besides considerations about cost and loca
tion, the center was also delayed by questions
about student housing and facilities.
