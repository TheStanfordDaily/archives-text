Early last week, a coalition of campus
minority groups issued a set of demands for
the University's consideration.
The demands include the establishment of
a commission to study the quality of
minority life at Stanford, the development of
an ethnic studies department, the establish
ment of a vice provost for minority affairs, in
creases in the number of minority students
admitted to the University and the creation
of a campus multicultural center.
Many of these demands are quite
reasonable, and without question worthy of
adoption by the University.
Campus minority leaders immediately
blasted the first University response to the
demands.
In that first response, University President
Donald Kennedy and Provost James Rosse
stated that they were sending the demands
to "the appropriate destination within Stan
ford" for study. Different University offices
will give "comments on what is being done
now, what would be required additionally to
meet these requests and what would be the
cost and feasibility of doing so," according to
the joint statement issued only three days
after the "Rainbow Agenda" demands were
presented. The statement also said answers
to the demands "will take time" and that it
"is not realistic to expect a substantive
response within a week or two. Clearly the
authors of the proposals would expect them
to be taken seriously. We expect responses

will be developed in a way that is constructive
and responsive to their purpose."
Minority leaders immediately charged that
the response was "very disrespectful" and
represented a example of the University
"brushing these issues under the table." One
minority leader said she believed Kennedy
was "questioning the legitimacy of our
demands."
While Kennedy's response is unduly vague
and lacks a timetable for answering the
demands, the criticism of the initial
response is premature and, as of yet, un
founded.
It cannot reasonably be expected that such
demands can be proposed early in the week
and substantially accepted (or rejected, for
that matter) by Friday of the same week.
Weighty changes like the development of a
new academic department, a major shift in
admissions policy and the creation of an im
portant Administration office do require
some time-consuming study and discussion
before being implemented, no matter how
desireable the changes are.
However, Kennedy must see to it that these
responses to the demands are quick in com
ing. In addition, he should personally come
down in favor of or against each specific
demand. If that does not happen, minority
leaders and all other students can say that
the University is "brushing these issues un
der the table."
