Culture and
race confused
I strongly oppose one of the
demands made last week by the
four ethnic student organizations
(the Black Student Union, the
Asian American Student Associa
tion, the Stanford American In
dian Organization and MEChA)
and would like to voice my
feelings.
One of their demands calls for
the "development of an ethnic
studies department at Stanford."
I believe what these groups in fact
desire is a department devoted to
the study of different cultures
within the United States, espe
cially those shared by many
American blacks, Asians, Ameri
can Indians and Chicanos.
Such a department would cer
tainly be academically worthy. In
fact, it would help organize
several cultural studies programs
that already exist at Stanford.
By calling this department
"ethnic studies," however, these
groups unfortunately confuse
ethnicity, or race, with culture.
To establish a department that
studies groups distinguished
solely by ethnicity is tantamount
to saying that it is race that
makes American minorities dif
ferent from one another. This is.
in short, racism.
As a theme associate at East
House, I am very conscious of the
difference between race and cul
ture and feel that it is a very im
portant one. I therefore call on
the leaders of these ethnic stu
dent organizations to re-examine

their demand and remove this
racial bias from it.

Scholars idea
is a big waste
As a Stanford alumna and a
Stanford parent, I would like to
join those who have already ex
pressed feelings of skepticism
regarding the new David Starr
Jordan Scholarships to be
selectively awarded to entering
Stanford freshmen. My objections
are as follows:
□ To be a Stanford freshman is
distinction enough. The achieve
ments of any Stanford freshman
are stellar by any standards. All
should begin their college careers
on an equal basis, with equal
expectations, hopes and encour
agement. Why denigrate by com
parison the status of those
freshmen who are not named as
Jordan Scholars?
□ To select a few in this manner
would seem to foster non
productive competition where
there should be mutual support
and sharing of ideas and informa
tion among students. Such open
ness and lack of synthetic
hauteur could be said to be one of
Stanford's present positive char
acteristics.
□ Let Stanford reward the
achievements of its students
while they are at Stanford, if such
incentives be necessary, rather
than the achievements earned
elsewhere and previously.
□ The resources consumed in the
selection, notification and record

ing of these scholars expend
someone's time and someone's
money. I would like to see a
rationale for such a process. As of
now, it seems to be gilding a few
lilies.

Thank you for
your concern
It's unfortunate that it
sometimes takes a crisis before
one fully appreciates the value of
his community. Two weeks ago,
after the announcement of the
• death of Dave Dunshee, many
people — ourselves included —
were stunned, overwhelmed and
quite confused. Dealing with the
death of a close friend can never
be easy, but at this stage of our
lives it is exceptional. We were
astounded.
Administrators, faculty and
student groups were quick to
provide us with both assistance
in planning the memorial service
and the moral support we
desperately needed as longtime
friends of Dave's.
We would like to thank past
residents of Madera and Lagunlta
who knew Dave and the Office of
Residential Education for all of
their support and concern. We
would especially like to thank
acting dean of the Chapel
Thomas Ambrogi, Residential
Dean Juan Yniguez and Fraternal
Affairs Adviser Joe Pisano.
