# Teach alcohol's societal history
## 
### 
While we quibble over Residential Education
rules, police action and stadium restrictions,
we get lost In the platitudes of policy and forget
why we have so many rules governing alcohol
in the first place. We forget that the real issue
is not policy, but the attitude that most Stan
ford students — and indeed most Americans
— have toward alcohol: that alcohol is a party
toy. an escape, a path toward peer acceptance.

JILL GILBERT

Impressionable freshmen learn early that
one should drink to get drunk and that getting
wasted is not only fun and "cool" but com
pletely normal. The alcohol education received
through sparsely attended Res Ed program
ming is powerless next to the alcohol educa
tion we receive at a dorm or fraternity keg.
When it comes to liquor, television gives us
Budweiser commercials, our friends urge us to
get blasted and our parents ground us. This,
combined with happy hours and parties, is the
only perspective we get.
Students should know that their counter
parts in other countries do not necessarily
share the "get wasted" attitude. In Italy, for ex
ample. alcohol Is more often associated with
good conversation and good food than with
getting sloshed and acting stupid. In an Italian
bar. the people drinking too many beers and
talking too loudly are the Americans, not the
Italians who think getting drunk is worthless.
They think, correctly, that alcohol is too good
to be treated with such disrespect.
Like philosophy, technology or literature, al
cohol Is an integral part of our heritage. We al

ways hear the evils of alcohol but never hear
about Its role in history or in other cultures.
Alcohol has been quenching the thirst of West
ern culture ever since that first glass of grape
juice accidentally fermented.
Wine goes hand-in-hand with philosophy.
Plato himself offered bountiful quantities of it
at his Symposia. Wine is mentioned in the
Bible no less than 165 times. More than a few
of Chaucer's pilgrims enjoyed a swig on the
way to Canterbury. We read "The Rule of St.
Benedict." but learn nothing of the famous
Benedictine monk. Dom Pierre Perignon. Fur
thermore. who can guess at how many of the
"great works" we read were written under the
influence?
While I'm not exactly proposing a
"Fermented Culture" program. I am calling on
the academic world to give us some perspective
on alcohol's place in our American society. Li
quor is not merely a party accessory but a sub
ject with a history worth thinking about.
An education on the history of alcohol can't
hurt and can. like sex education, allow us to
make more informed decisions. If there were to
be a Western Culture lecture on alcohol's his
tory. I'm sure it would be very well-attended.
I know academia is already burdened with
other save-the-world type issues that seem
much more pressing than alcohol education,
but nowhere else in our society can we gain
perspective on this issue. Bud and Michelob
commercials only tell us that a beautiful
woman lives in every bottle of beer.
Alcohol education, however minimal, should
take place at the college level simply because
the drinking age Is 21. and students are 18
when they leave home. Most students start

Liquor is not merely a party
accessory but a subject with
a history

drinking in college during their freshman
year.
I am the resident assistant in a dorm that's
had its share of beer- and margarita-related
problems, and I've seen enough people who, in
the name of fun. nearly poison themselves,
seriously Injure themselves or others and
destroy property. They do this not because
Stanford is too lenient, but because they learn
to do this.
As Stanford bickers over policy, we see a Uni
versity more concerned with liability than with
education, with paperwork than enlightened
understanding. The more policy is discussed,
the more real issues are ignored.
So teach us. Teach us about vodka, Chianti,
ale, grappa and tequila. Some perspective,
seeing alcohol from the point of view of anthro
pology. biology, history and other disciplines,
can only help us.
Since my proposal — that alcohol is worthy
of some academic consideration — is not very
Harvard-esque (as are Jordan Scholars), I
doubt it will be taken seriously by the Univer
sity. I also doubt that a lecture or two will do
much to shape attitudes. But I hope that stu
dents who are tired of Stanford's narrow
minded policy approach to alcohol will teach
themselves to think critically on this subject
and about how alcohol landed its starring role
on the American campus.
