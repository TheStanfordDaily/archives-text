# Living life on the edge

I wrote this column in a car coming back from
Yosemite Valley. My mother shudders over the phone
whenever I tell her I'm going there. She and I know
that I'm going rock-climbing.
"It's dangerous," she says. "You'll break your
neck." She imagines her eldest daughter falling to
her death before I've paid off my college loans. Well,
I'll give her some credit; rock-climbing does involve
risk. However, for my defense, I decided to research
some other, perhaps more common, activities that
are also risky.

I read all of this information in the April 17 issue of
Science magazine. The articles are pretty interest
ing, so you should check it out.
Among one of the most toxic substances known is
aflatoxin. Aflatoxin has caused cancer in laboratory
rats and is generally a very nasty chemical. And
guess what food contains this toxin? Peanut butter.
Yup, good old peanut butter that my mom fixed for
me when I was little. Aflatoxin is a natural sub
stance, too. It's just in peanuts. Maybe peanuts are
plotting against us. And if you hate peanut butter,
you can get your daily dose of aflatoxin in wheat,
corn and other nuts.
We ingest natural pesticides about 10,000 times
more by weight than man-made ones. Some that
have shown potency in rodents are common, like
peanut butter. Basil, natural root beer, mushrooms
(heaven knows about the psychedelic variety) and
brown mustard are all on a list of possible car
cinogens for rodents.
The way researchers calculate inherent risks is
fairly complicated. It has to be. The problem with
risk assessment is just that — risks are possibilities
of danger and the estimates of risk involve
probabilities and error figures. One way to test for
carcinogens is to use rats. Rats, however, aren't a lot
like human beings.
Possible risks are calculated by feeding the rats the
suspect substance. TD(SO) is the daily dose in mil
ligrams per kilogram of rat that causes 50 percent of
the rats to grow tumors. Daily human exposure is
measured in milligrams per kilogram of person. The
ratio of the human exposure over the TD(SO) is the
HERP — Human Exposure/Rodent Potency dose.
Confused? Picture this. There is a bunch of one
kilogram rats. If they consume five milligrams of
substance 'A' daily, half of them get tumors —
TD(5O)=5. Our hypothetical 50 kilogram human
eats 50 milligrams of substance 'A' daily — exposure
percentage= 1. The HERP for substance 'A' is one
fifth or 0.2.
The higher the HERP, the higher a substance is
rated on a possible carcinogen scale. Aflatoxin has a

HERP of 0.03. Mushrooms are rated at 0.1. Mobile
home air has a HERP of 2.1 and beer has a HERP of
2.8.
Anyhow, that's how they decide things cause can
cer. Another easier method of risk assessment is his
torical data. Using past information, we can project
into the future just how risky something will be.
Each year, two in every 10,000 people will be in a
serious car crash. One in every 10,000 people have
major home accidents annually. I don't know —
maybe the toaster explodes. Seven thousand people a
year in the United States die falling down stairs.
Cigarette smoking and cancer are both high in sta
tistics, with one pack a day giving four out of 1,000
smokers a year cancer. Cancer has a lifetime risk of
25 percent for the entire U.S. population.
Five in 100,000 frequent flyers are harmed — not
by falling out of the sky, but by the increased expo
sure to cosmic radiation. Mountaineering goes badly
for six out of every 10,000 mountaineers. See, Mom,
it's relatively harmless!
An interesting aspect of all this is what people
think is risky. In one example, groups of people were
asked to rank activities according to risk. These
rankings were compared to the rankings of experts.

In Jact, some people
would not be happy to
discover how risky plain
old walking can be

College students were one group of people polled.
College students thought that nuclear power was the
most hazardous, flying was In the middle and swim
ming was at the bottom of the list.
The experts disagree. They found that motor
vehicles were the riskiest, bicycles fell In the middle
of the rankings and skiing was the least risky. And
even though others perceived mountain-climbing as
dangerous, the experts ranked it 29th out of the 30
risky activities.
Of course, none of this Information will calm my
mother s nerves. In fact, some people would not be
happy to discover how risky plain old walking can be.
We encounter risks every day and don't blink an eye.
The risk that 1 will not get this column in on time is
becoming great.
However, when I sat on the top of a rock, pulled my
peanut butter and jelly sandwich out of my backpack
and gazed at the cliffs and waterfalls, risks were the
furthest things from my mind. And though I know
my saying so won t do any good — Mom, don't worry.
