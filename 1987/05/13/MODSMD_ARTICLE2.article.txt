# Divestment plan approval delayed
## 
### MARK LAWRENCE Senior staff writer 
Stanford will adopt a new, more aggressive selective divestment policy later this year,
after the Committee on Investment Responsibility (CIR) slightly revises a series of
proposals the Board of Trustees considered at Its meetings Monday and yesterday, the
trustees' Special Committee on Investment Responsibility (SCIR) announced yesterday.

In a meeting Monday, the SCIR approved
In principle three CIR proposals that would
lead to more stringent guidelines on invest
ment in companies that do business in
South Africa. The proposals may bring
about divestment of nearly $3 million of
stock in companies that do not meet the
new criteria.
But the SCIR said In a statement that it
would not give the proposals final approval
until the CIR adds a provision that compan
ies failing to meet the objective criteria be
allowed to explain extenuating circum
stances that may justify their operations In
South Africa.
During its next few meetings, the CIR will
decide how to incorporate the trustees' re
quest into a final proposal, CIR Chairman
Frederick Hillier said. When the final pro
posal is complete, possibly by late May, the
SCIR will meet by teleconference to vote on
the issue, he said.
The CIR proposals, which were submitted
to the SCIR last month, called on Stanford
to divest automatically of all stock in com-
panies with an unacceptable
rating according to the Sullivan
Principles, a set of guidelines used
to assess a company's conduct in
South Africa. The CIR also pro
posed that Stanford automatically

divest of stock in companies that
have not signed the Sullivan Prin
ciples. A third proposal urged
Stanford not to buy any new stock
in companies that have recently
opened operations in South Africa
until they are given Sullivan
ratings.
The SCIR said it is in "general
agreement with the need to clarify
the standards and expedite the

review of companies in these
categories." But the trustees said
divestment decisions should not
be made automatically, on a com
pletely objective basis.
"The trustees feel strongly that
. . . any company is entitled to due
process and nothing should be
completely automatic," Hillier
said. "We should then be willing to
wait a short period of time to dem
onstrate that their situation really
is extraordinary" and should be
exempted from Stanford's criteria.
Despite the trustees' reserva
tions about the CIR proposals, Hil
lier said the new policies represent
a "major, very important shift in
policy."

"A strong burden of proof is
placed on the company to prove
persuasively as to why they don't
meet the acceptable categories,"
Hillier said.
Stanford currently makes di
vestment decisions on a case-by
case basis. In evaluating a com
pany's performance in South
Africa, the CIR and the SCIR con
sider a variety of information that
includes — but is not limited to —
adherence to the Sullivan Prin
ciples.
Critics of University divestment
policy have complained that the
trustees' Insistence on case-by
case review slowed the process of
reviewing the performance of corn

panles operating in South Africa
so much that the policy was inef
fective.
The ASSU Senate voted last
month not to appoint student
members to the CIR for next year,
charging that the existence of the
CIR gave the false impression that
Stanford had an effective divest
ment policy.
Senior John van Loben Sels, a
senator who resigned from the
CIR last month in protest of the
ClR's role In divestment decisions,
said last night that the trustee's
decision on the CIR proposals
might be significant enough that
the senate would reverse its deci
sion and appoint students.
