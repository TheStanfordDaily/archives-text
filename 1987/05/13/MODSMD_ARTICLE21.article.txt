## Sunday movies make big profits There's more to the Flicks than paper fights 
### MIKE SHAY 
For some, the ASSU Sunday
Flicks mean a good paper fight.
For others, they represent the last
party of the weekend. For the
ASSU, the Sunday Flicks is its
single most profitable project —
and its popularity is still growing.
The Flicks, in its second
straight year of growth, is ex
pected to make over >50.000 in
profits this year. Attendance has
increased and season-pass sales
have risen steadily over the last
three quarters.
Originally budgeted to make
only • 19,433 in profits for the
year, it appears that the Flicks will
double last year's profits.
"I underbudgeted," said Flicks
Manager Steve Sinclair. "We are
doing significantly better this
year."
ASSU Financial Manager Maria
Dickson estimated the Flicks will
c ontribute one-sixth of the ASSU's
total Income, or half of its income
from special projects.

The Flicks, in its second straight year of
growth, is expected to make over $50,000 in
profits this year. Attendance has been
increasing and season-pass sales have
risen steadily over the last three quarters.

The Increase In profits must be
attributed, in part, to the increase
in admission prices, up from
*1.50 last year to *1.75. Even
with the increase in price,
however, attendence has grown.
The Flicks sold 2,400 passes this
spring quarter, up from 2,200
winter quarter and 1,800 the
quarter before.

Memorial Auditorium has a
capacity of 1,700 people. This
means only 3,400 can see the
Flicks on a given week. According
to Sinclair, if the maximum
capacity of Memorial Auditorium
is reached before all the pass
holders arrive there could be prob
lems.
"The pass holders have to have
room," he said, noting that sales
would have to be cut off to one
time ticket purchasers until all
pass holders have been admitted.
Sinclair said this has
sometimes worried him on nights
when sales were particularly good.
On a slow night, attendence is
around 1,500 people. On a good
night, it can reach as high as
3.000.
Another reason for the increase
in profits is due to the better
quality films the Flicks has shown
this year. Sinclair said. "We bring
in the very best films.
"We did a good job advertising,"
he added. At the beginning of the
year, the Flicks workers tried to

put a flier on every freshman's
door.
The films shown are chosen by
the Flicks manager based on what
he feels will attract an audience.
"For fall and spring (quarters) I
chose the films with the help and
advice of friends," Sinclair said.
"Winter we did a fairly large sur
vey." The survey included stu

dents in Roble, Branner and
Schiff House in Sterling Quad.
The results were pretty much as
expected. "We didn't need a survey
to tell us that Top Gun' would be a
hit," Sinclair said.
Keeping track of finances is the
Flicks manager's most important
job.
"The costs, except for the films,
are fixed by the number of films
per quarter," Sinclair said.
The Flicks spend around * 1,300
per quarter for clean up of Mem
Aud, *700 for the use of an ASSU
office and about *975 for advertis
ing and fliers.
The project also spends *50 per
hour for the projectionist from
University Events and Services,
plus an additional 11 percent Uni
versity Incidental cost recovery
fee. The 11 percent is assessed on
the projectionist's bill and serves
to cover damage and use of the
facilities.
The films the Flicks show cost
50 percent of the gross admission
income for the night of the film.
The more money the box office
takes in, the more the film costs to
rent.
Sinclair tries to schedule at
least one older film per season.
"Something we know we can get
cheaply and the pass holders will
enjoy," he said. Older films can be
had for a flat fee, sometimes for as
little as *200.
But not everything at the Flicks
runs smoothly.
According to Buy Baily, a projec
tionist for Events and Services,
the projectors at the Flicks are a
problem. They were made in 1945
and frequently break down. There
are no electronic parts; everything
is manual. The light is produced
not by a bulb, but rather from two
charged carbon rods that are
brought together.

When the rods are close to
gether, they arc and release light.
The rods must constantly be
checked, Baily said, because if
they are too close or too far apart
they won't give off any light. He
also said that different rods act
differently, so keeping up a projec
tor that sits for a week and is then
run for four or five hours is diffi
cult.
"(The projectors] won't take a
splice real well," Baily said. The

film that comes from the distribu
tors is rarely checked before it is
run. A splice that wouldn't cause a
newer projecter problems often
has problems at the Flicks, Baily
added.
The ASSU and the University
are currently negotiating the
replacment of the equipment at
Mem Aud.
The Flicks remain rowdy, al
though Sinclair and his staff
agree that things have calmed

down, with less paper and beer
clean-up to contend with than in
prior years.
"Lowering the emotional level is
a priority," Sinclair said.
Security at the Flicks tries to
keep things under control. The
early show has eight security per
sonnel. while the late show has
around 14.
"Mainly we go around looking
for beer and people sneaking in,"
one Flicks staffer said.

means only 3,400 can see the
Flicks on a given week. According
to Sinclair, if the maximum
capacity of Memorial Auditorium
is reached before all the pass
holders arrive there could be prob
lems.
"The pass holders have to have
room," he said, noting that sales
would have to be cut off to one
time ticket purchasers until all
pass holders have been admitted.
Sinclair said this has
sometimes worried him on nights
when sales were particularly good.
On a slow night, attendence is
around 1,500 people. On a good
night, it can reach as high as
3.000.
Another reason for the increase
in profits is due to the better
quality films the Flicks has shown
this year. Sinclair said. "We bring
in the very best films.
"We did a good job advertising,"
he added. At the beginning of the
year, the Flicks workers tried to

put a flier on every freshman's
door.
The films shown are chosen by
the Flicks manager based on what
he feels will attract an audience.
"For fall and spring (quarters) I
chose the films with the help and
advice of friends," Sinclair said.
"Winter we did a fairly large sur
vey." The survey included stu

dents in Roble, Branner and
Schiff House in Sterling Quad.
The results were pretty much as
expected. "We didn't need a survey
to tell us that Top Gun' would be a
hit," Sinclair said.
Keeping track of finances is the
Flicks manager's most important
job.
"The costs, except for the films,
are fixed by the number of films
per quarter," Sinclair said.
The Flicks spend around * 1,300
per quarter for clean up of Mem
Aud, *700 for the use of an ASSU
office and about *975 for advertis
ing and fliers.
The project also spends *50 per
hour for the projectionist from
University Events and Services,
plus an additional 11 percent Uni
versity Incidental cost recovery
fee. The 11 percent is assessed on
the projectionist's bill and serves
to cover damage and use of the
facilities.
The films the Flicks show cost
50 percent of the gross admission
income for the night of the film.
The more money the box office
takes in, the more the film costs to
rent.
Sinclair tries to schedule at
least one older film per season.
"Something we know we can get
cheaply and the pass holders will
enjoy," he said. Older films can be
had for a flat fee, sometimes for as
little as *200.
But not everything at the Flicks
runs smoothly.
According to Buy Baily, a projec
tionist for Events and Services,
the projectors at the Flicks are a
problem. They were made in 1945
and frequently break down. There
are no electronic parts; everything
is manual. The light is produced
not by a bulb, but rather from two
charged carbon rods that are
brought together.

When the rods are close to
gether, they arc and release light.
The rods must constantly be
checked, Baily said, because if
they are too close or too far apart
they won't give off any light. He
also said that different rods act
differently, so keeping up a projec
tor that sits for a week and is then
run for four or five hours is diffi
cult.
"(The projectors] won't take a
splice real well," Baily said. The

film that comes from the distribu
tors is rarely checked before it is
run. A splice that wouldn't cause a
newer projecter problems often
has problems at the Flicks, Baily
added.
The ASSU and the University
are currently negotiating the
replacment of the equipment at
Mem Aud.
The Flicks remain rowdy, al
though Sinclair and his staff
agree that things have calmed

down, with less paper and beer
clean-up to contend with than in
prior years.
"Lowering the emotional level is
a priority," Sinclair said.
Security at the Flicks tries to
keep things under control. The
early show has eight security per
sonnel. while the late show has
around 14.
"Mainly we go around looking
for beer and people sneaking in,"
one Flicks staffer said.

For some, the ASSU Sunday
Flicks mean a good paper fight.
For others, they represent the last
party of the weekend. For the
ASSU, the Sunday Flicks is its
single most profitable project —
and its popularity is still growing.
The Flicks, in its second
straight year of growth, is ex
pected to make over >50.000 in
profits this year. Attendance has
increased and season-pass sales
have risen steadily over the last
three quarters.
Originally budgeted to make
only • 19,433 in profits for the
year, it appears that the Flicks will
double last year's profits.
"I underbudgeted," said Flicks
Manager Steve Sinclair. "We are
doing significantly better this
year."
ASSU Financial Manager Maria
Dickson estimated the Flicks will
c ontribute one-sixth of the ASSU's
total Income, or half of its income
from special projects.

The Flicks, in its second straight year of
growth, is expected to make over $50,000 in
profits this year. Attendance has been
increasing and season-pass sales have
risen steadily over the last three quarters.

The Increase In profits must be
attributed, in part, to the increase
in admission prices, up from
*1.50 last year to *1.75. Even
with the increase in price,
however, attendence has grown.
The Flicks sold 2,400 passes this
spring quarter, up from 2,200
winter quarter and 1,800 the
quarter before.
