## 'Shuffle' laughs at Hollywood's black stereotypes 
### CHRIS HART 
Before seeing "Hollywood Shuffle," I
had heard and read good things about the
film and its creator, co-writer-producer
director and star Robert Townsend. In or
der to finance his film, Townsend used
his own money and credit cards.
Whenever he had money from small film
roles (he appeared in "Ratboy," "A Sol

dler's Story" and "Streets of Fire") or
stand-up comedy routines, he would film
more scenes until the money ran out.
This was a brave way to make a movie, so I
was anxious to see the result.
There was, however, an additional
aspect of "Hollywood Shuffle" that made
me curious: Townsend is an independent
black filmmaker, and his film's subject is
the difficulty blacks have in getting good
parts in Hollywood films. Before seeing
the film, a friend of mine said he was
worried because he thought a lot of the
critical acclaim for the film was based
more on its subject than its entertaim
nent value. There had been a similar reac
tion to Spike Lee's "She's Gotta Have It,"
he said.
Fortunately, all of my speculations were
rewarded by a hilarious, quirky movie.
Because some of the scenes were filmed
before the film's plot had been firmly
decided upon, the movie jumps suddenly
from style to style and place to place, and
it doesn't flow smoothly. But it works
anyway, because the audience cares
about the characters and because
Townsend's comic ideas are so funny.
"Hollywood Shuffle" revolves around a
struggling young black actor named
Bobby Taylor (Townsend), who is trying
to resolve his dilemma over whether he
should play the part of a street hood and

reinforce demeaning black stereotypes.
Interspersed with scenes of his audition
and subsequent rehearsals are Taylor's
daydreams about his problems. The real
life scenes Involving the film's plot are of-

ten slow and drive home the film's point
— that most of Hollywood's roles for
blacks are junkies and pimps — with a
sledgehammer. A scene in which Taylor's
uncle, a failed singer who now sweeps the
floor of a barber shop, tells him not to give

up acting ("Because I gave up singing,
and look at me now"), goes on far too long
and is standard melodrama.
What makes the film are the inspired
daydream sequences. For example, Taylor
imagines two black kids taking over for
Siskel and Ebert in "Sneakin" the
Movies." The movies reviewed include
"Amadeus Meets Salieri," the title of
which neither kid can pronounce, and
the hilariously exaggerated "Attack of the
Zombie Pimps." Townsend's wit can be
biting, but at times there's also a mis
chievousness to his humor, as in another
dream scene where he envisions himself
winning an Oscar for best actor, beating
out Robert Redford, Dustin Hoffman and
Meryl Streep.
Townsend does show some shrewd
ness, too, when Taylor finally begins film
ing his cheap hood role. The film he's in
also features a Hispanic street gang, and
we see that the Latin roles are just as
stereotypical as those of the blacks: The
Hispanic gang leader has to speak lines
like "Joo jep back, mon," which is cliche
Latinese for "You get back, man."
The film is not without flaws. Some
scenes, such as when Townsend poses in
front of a mirror before going off to his
audition, need editing. But one gets the
feeling while watching "Hollywood
Shuffle" that when the money ran out at

last. Townsend had to use everything he'd
shot; cut anything out and the picture —
only 80 minutes long as It is — would be
too short to be a feature film.
In the end, this raw feeling makes the
film that much more enjoyable. If you
want to see a good movie that someone
made because he wanted to make a point
— not because he wanted to make a buck
— go see "Hollywood Shuffle."
