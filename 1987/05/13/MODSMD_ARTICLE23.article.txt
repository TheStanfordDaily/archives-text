# S.F. Ballet, Cunningham top Bay Area dance
## 
### CHRISTINA LEPNIS 
The most prominent dance events in the Bay Area
during the past month were performances by the
touring Merce Cunningham Dance Company and
the annual repertory season of the San Francisco
Ballet. There has been no shortage of diverse offer
ings in dance this spring, but these two companies
represent the most eminent contributions to that di
versity.
Appearing at UC-Berkeley's Zellerbach Audi
torium, the Cunningham Dance Company presented
works from recent years, all of which feature aspects
of the characteristic Cunningham style: arbitrari
ness, balletic earthiness, spacial experimentation,
purity of movement and intellectual undertones. The
almost translucent calm of the dancers further in
creases the ascetic elegance of each piece.
Most compelling was "Shards" (1987), a disturb
ing yet unemotional depiction of fragmentary exis
tence. the title suggesting a figurative "shattering."
With calculated randomness, Cunningham's gray
clad dancers and David Tudor's roaring sound
collage evoke tension and alienation.
Relationships overlapping and changing is the
basis for "Pictures," a study of motion that periodi
cally pauses for still moments. Moving through space
in complex patterns, figures merge to form a frozen
image. When the lighting changes briefly, the image
is viewed in silhouette with the energy temporarily
residing in tautness until movement resumes. Each
"snapshot" is a poetic, reflective portrait.
Although now 68 years old and beset by advancing
arthritis. Cunningham himself appears in the last
minutes of the dance, making his way slowly and
sparely across the stage. His mere presence there,
however, transfigures him. The final darkened
outline of Cunningham supporting a woman's limp
body is a powerful, lasting image.
One of several mixed programs performed by the
San Francisco Ballet this season consisted of George
Balanchine's "Agon," Paul Taylor's "Sunset" and Mi
chael Smuin's "Hearts."
Now that former New York City Ballet principal
dancer Helgi Tomasson is artistic director, it is not
surprising that the Balanchine repertoire is creeping
into the San Francisco Ballet's agenda. What is sur
prising is how stunningly the company can match
the brazen perfection of the New York City Ballet,

something even the American Ballet Theatre has
failed to accomplish when presenting a Balanchine
piece.
"Agon" (1957) is an abstract work that reflects the
dynamics and complexity of Stravinsky's score while
challenging the agility and precision of 12 dancers as
though they were in contest. Stylishly authoritative
and occasionally bizarre, it moves with intensity

through each of its many sections and groupings.
The precarious "Pas De Deux," flawlessly executed
by Tracy Kai-Maier and Mark Spradling, is like an
unconventionally alluring, moving sculpture,
smoothly twisting its way through a series of contor
tions.
In contrast, Taylor's "Sunset" was an unexpected
disappointment and could be described as forget

table if it hadn't been quite so dreadful. Taylor's
modern dance pieces typically sparkle with boldness,
originality, wit and a conceptually integrated design,
all of which are plaintively absent in "Sunset."
"Sunset" begins as a naive flirtation between sol
diers sporting red berets and four women in maiden
white frocks, then is inexplicably transformed into a
danced dirge accompanied by a soundtrack of loon
calls. Balletic cliches and uninspired choreography
persist as the piece closes to Elgar's somber "Elegy
for Strings."
The loon calls emerge as the only interesting ele
ment "Sunset" has to offer. Why the company will
reprise the piece next year is puzzling.

The flawlessly executed 4 Pas
De Deux' is like an alluring,
moving sculpture.

Michael Smuin, former artistic director of the San
Francisco Ballet, achieved great success with his
sweeping full-length "Romeo and Juliet" and
"The Tempest," largely because of his theatrical flair.
This same vigor is apparent in his elaborately
costumed narrative "Hearts" ("Le Ballet des
Coeurs ), danced to the orchestrated music of
French chansons, sung by Raquel Bitton in the
manner of Edith Piaf.
The episodic story is woven around the passion be
tween Baptiste, who is a version of the mime Pierrot,
and the quietly beautiful Garrance. Eloquently
portrayed by Christopher Stowell and Evelyn Cis
neros, these two figures play out their drama among
a colorful cast of characters in a stylized, French
period setting.
The use of gestural acting and the mingling of
pathos and humor occur comfortably within this
vivid, emotional composition. The totality of the
piece is enhanced by shifts in tone — ranging from
Baptiste's anguished airborne solo to the park
keeper's rhythmic exit while flourishing a feather
duster. There are also moments when Smuin seems
to create a tableau uivant, and indeed by opening
and closing the piece in this way he completes the
unity of his stylized design.

challenging the agility and precision of 12 dancers as
though they were in contest. Stylishly authoritative
and occasionally bizarre, it moves with intensity

through each of its many sections and groupings.
The precarious "Pas De Deux," flawlessly executed
by Tracy Kai-Maier and Mark Spradling, is like an
unconventionally alluring, moving sculpture,
smoothly twisting its way through a series of contor
tions.
In contrast, Taylor's "Sunset" was an unexpected
disappointment and could be described as forget

table if it hadn't been quite so dreadful. Taylor's
modern dance pieces typically sparkle with boldness,
originality, wit and a conceptually integrated design,
all of which are plaintively absent in "Sunset."
"Sunset" begins as a naive flirtation between sol
diers sporting red berets and four women in maiden
white frocks, then is inexplicably transformed into a
danced dirge accompanied by a soundtrack of loon
calls. Balletic cliches and uninspired choreography
persist as the piece closes to Elgar's somber "Elegy
for Strings."
The loon calls emerge as the only interesting ele
ment "Sunset" has to offer. Why the company will
reprise the piece next year is puzzling.

The flawlessly executed 4 Pas
De Deux' is like an alluring,
moving sculpture.

Michael Smuin, former artistic director of the San
Francisco Ballet, achieved great success with his
sweeping full-length "Romeo and Juliet" and
"The Tempest," largely because of his theatrical flair.
This same vigor is apparent in his elaborately
costumed narrative "Hearts" ("Le Ballet des
Coeurs ), danced to the orchestrated music of
French chansons, sung by Raquel Bitton in the
manner of Edith Piaf.
The episodic story is woven around the passion be
tween Baptiste, who is a version of the mime Pierrot,
and the quietly beautiful Garrance. Eloquently
portrayed by Christopher Stowell and Evelyn Cis
neros, these two figures play out their drama among
a colorful cast of characters in a stylized, French
period setting.
The use of gestural acting and the mingling of
pathos and humor occur comfortably within this
vivid, emotional composition. The totality of the
piece is enhanced by shifts in tone — ranging from
Baptiste's anguished airborne solo to the park
keeper's rhythmic exit while flourishing a feather
duster. There are also moments when Smuin seems
to create a tableau uivant, and indeed by opening
and closing the piece in this way he completes the
unity of his stylized design.
