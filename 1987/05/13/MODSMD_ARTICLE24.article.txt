# 3 new horror films are a real 'Creepshow
## 
### MARK TOMPKINS Editorial staff 
The 1980s have been something of a boom
time for horror movies. There is no delight the
equal of dread, writes author Clive Barker, and
apparently Tinseltown agrees. With directors
like George Romero, David Cronenberg and
Stuart Gordon ready to splatter their wildest
imaginings in theaters everywhere, the blood
sucking, slime-covered freaks who populate
the horror genre — once confined to passion
pit drive-ins — have become big stars. One im
agines Romero's zombies lounging by the pool
at the Beverly Hills Hotel, waiting for the call to
appear in the next "Living Dead" movie.
At the head of this particular pack is, of
course, Freddy Krueger, the "Nightmare on
Elm Street" villain whose memorable
manicure has scared the bejeezus out of mil
lions of moviegoers. To say that Freddy is just a
villain doesn't quite do him justice, though. In
the "Elm Street" trilogy he acts as hell's tour
guide, sure enough, but he's also the master of
ceremonies; he'd rather crack wise than any
thing else. The second movement in the "Elm
Street" trilogy was a disaster for a lot of
reasons, but mainly because Freddy was
shown to be a clumsy, witless dolt, with none
of his usual savoir-faire — a real hack, you
might say.
The newest "Elm Street" movie. "Dream
Warriors," is a veritable masterwork by com
parison (even though it can't touch the Olym
pian heights of the first "Nightmare"), partly
because Freddy has gone over the top. He's a
disfigured Puck, with razors for fingernails.
Stand-up comedians have long struck me as
being nightmarish, but Freddy goes them all
one better: Death Is always his punch line. It's
not just that he makes bad jokes over the
bodies of his victims, but that the nightmares
he creates are full of an eerie, demented wit.
And even the ways in which he kills people
have a ghoulish cleverness to them: One girl in
"Dream Warriors" who dreams of becoming a
star personality Is embedded in a TV set while
watching "The Dick Cavett Show." Give the
man points for style. He kills with flair.

The macabre wit of the "Elm Street" films
points to an increasingly obvious trait in all
modern horror movies: namely, their humor.
Ever since John Landis' "An American
Werewolf in London," the best horror flicks
have been a real roller coaster ride between
laughter and terror. In a film like Stuart Gor
don's "Re-Animator," it's impossible to say
where one ends and the other begins.
Another new horror movie, "Evil Dead II:
Dead By Dawn" (which makes the distribution
rounds to our area Friday), actually works bet
ter for its humor than anything else. Written
and directed by whiz-kid Sam Raimi, it's a
classic example of the can-you-top-this school
of filmmaking. The lead character (Bruce
Campbell) is a sort of schmuck Everyman out
on his own in a forest cabin, where he's tor
mented by a wood demon with a wicked sense
of humor. The poor galoot takes an amazing
amount of punishment; the goofy height of
slapstick comes when his own right hand
turns against him and starts beating him.
breaking plates over his head, et cetera.
Incidentally, those who fancy themselves
serious connoisseurs of film technique owe it
to themselves to see "Evil Dead II." The first 45
minutes of the movie feature some of the most
energetic. Innovative camera movements
yours truly has ever seen. As a director. Raimi
could be thought of as a punk filmmaker, al
though he doesn't so much throw the rulebook
out the window as seem to have never even
heard of conventional approaches. Watching
this movie, you realize that there is indeed a
strange, strange mind at work up there on the
screen.
Having said all that as a sort of preamble. I
must say that the just-released horror movie
"Creepshow 2" ("Good to the last gasp," the
ads say) is a thudding disappointment. The
original "Creepshow" by George Romero and
Stephen King, two creeps with outstanding
credentials in the horror genre, wasn't exactly
scary, but it did have its nauseating moments
and it was nothing if not humorous. (The Tas
manian Devil eating Adrienne Barbeau. Step
hen King being covered in meteor slime, the
cockroaches popping out of Eli Wallach's

mouth — come on, that was funny stuff, eh?
You know it was.)
"Creepshow 2" isn't exactly bad, but one ex
pects more, considering who's involved with it.
It's a sad day indeed when Stephen King can't
come up with some cheap laughs, at least.
Romero (mastermind behind the "Living
Dead" film cycle) wrote the screenplay, based
on three King stories, but didn't direct, which
indicates that maybe the material wasn't chal
lenging enough for him, or that he had some
thing better to do. Director Michael Gornick is
competent, but unlike Romero he doesn't
know how to use details well, or how to milk
the most suspense out of a given scene.
The three stories in the movie are framed by
an amusing, if silly, animated sequence which
features animation of a truly bargain
basement quality. The first story, "Old Chief
Wood'nhead," features the plodding George
Kennedy as a storeowner in a dried-up South
western town. His store is raided by three
young punks, and he gets his big ol" gut shot
in when he tries to stop them. Later the 7-foot
tall Indian statue in front of his store comes to
life and tracks down the three punks, exacting
a nasty revenge from them. The whole thing is
pretty mechanical, which may be why Stephen
King has never bothered to publish the
original story on which this part of the movie
is based.
Next up is "The Raft," from King's "Skeleton
Crew" collection. It's better, a grisly little num
ber about four college kids who decide to go
swimming in a lake during the off-season, only
to find something swimming with them. They
get trapped on a wooden raft, cut off from the
shore. The simplicity of the situation Js what
makes It frighteningly effective. Just what
would you do In that situation, especially when
you learn that It can suck people down through
the cracks between the raft's floorboards?
(This happens on-screen, in the movie's big
gross-out scene.) Screenwriter Romero gets ex
tra points for adding a nasty twist to the end
ing. not found in the original story.
