## Cook wanted by two sports 
### EVAN TUCHINSKY Staff writer 
Spring can be a very stressful time for
college seniors. Though nearly through
with their studies, many students
anxiously and actively canvass the job
market in search for some form of employ
ment to survive in the cold, hard business
world.
Stanford senior Tol Cook is not among
this group.
Cook, cornerback in the fall and center
fielder in the spring, waits for offers to
come to htm. Already selected by the New
Orleans Saints in the eighth round of the
National Football League draft and sure to
be a draft choice in Major League
Baseball, Cook is one individual with a
pretty good future.
"I'm happy to be drafted by the Saints."
Cook said. "It's one of the teams I was in
different to. I didn't want to get drafted by
Minnesota, Atlanta, Green Bay or In
dianapolis.
"Being drafted by the Saints Is good be
cause it's a relatively young team. They
dldn t make the playoffs last year, but
they did come on strong. They have a
good defense," he added.
"I went in the eighth round, and the
reason I think is that none of the teams
wanted to waste an early round pick, a
fourth or fifth round pick." Cook said.
"They thought I might play baseball, and
they didn't want to waste the pick."
This hesitance is certainly well
founded. The cornerback/center fielder is
currently batting .324 for the Pacific 10
Conference champion Cardinal and is
second on the team in home runs with 10
- two features likely to earn him All
America honors this year.
"Even in the seventh round, teams were
calling and asking me what I wanted to
do, Cook recalled. "Actually I was playing
baseball, so they were asking my dad,
'Does Toi want to play in the NFL? What's
the deal with baseball?'
"When the Saints drafted me, they
asked what I wanted to do about baseball.
They're still a little wary of it,"he added.
"Baseball-wise, I want to see who I get
drafted by and what are my chances of
shooting up to the majors. I want to see
what team drafts me, and I'll take it from
there."
Thus, the big question still remains:
Will Toi Cook aim for the Hall of Fame in
Canton, Ohio, or in Cooperstown, N.Y. ?
"My preference would be to be drafted

by the Dodgers," said the Los Angeles
county resident, "and then play profes
sional baseball because you can play for
so long. But then there's the chance that
you might not make it and end up In the
minors for a while. That's the only thing
that would hold me back."
Economics will prove to be the deciding
factor, however. "I like both sports
equally, but I look at it more financially:
What's going to benefit me, what do I
want to do with my life.
"I haven't gotten a money offer from the
Saints yet," Cook said. "But my prefer
ence would be either to make it into the
Saints, or If I play baseball to make it into
the bigs within two years. My preference
is to make some money,"
Cook's invitation to professional foot
ball is not a guarantee that he will play. As
in baseball, a player has to try out and
make the team In order to play, but there
are no farm teams in the NFL. "So, my
preference would be to actually play," the
senior added.
Whichever sport he chooses to pursue.
Cook sees the transition from two sports
to one as a positive change. "There's no
question," he said.
"In baseball, for instance, everyone
plays year-round. They play summer
league, then they come play winter ball
and then they play through the season.
"I, on the other hand, come out in Jan
uary and play January to June and then
that's it," Cook noted. "I don't play in the
summer because I'm lifting for football."
He is equally behind his football
teammates because of baseball. "After
season, everyone starts lifting for next
year, so its almost a nine-month lifting
(period), where I, with school and
baseball, don't have time to lift. I'm only
able to lift June into August, so I only get
two, three months of lifting in.
"Actually, I think it hurts me more in
baseball than it does in football," Cook
said. "In football I'm pretty sure I might be
a little stronger if I lifted all year round,
but I can't see myself being much of a bet
ter player, where I know that if I played
baseball all year round I'd be a better
player."
The conflict was even worse for him in
high school, where he was a three-sport
athlete. "I started playing football when I
was in ninth grade. I'd always been a
baseball player, a basketball player and a
bowler. I went to Montclair Prep (in Van
Nuys, Calif.) and played all three sports
there (not including bowling)."

Though Cook received a scholarship at
Stanford to play football, his passion
throughout high school was baseball. "It's
so funny when 1 go back to school and all
the players ask what you've got to do to
get a scholarship," he said, "When 1
played high school football 1 just played. 1
didn't care. I was more interested in doing
well baseball-wise.
"Going into senior year. I wanted to play
baseball, but I got an offer. Stanford
found me. liked me and gave me a chance
here.
"The reason I came to Stanford was be
cause I would have gotten a chance to play
on their baseball team," Cook continued.
"That's what I wanted to do. I was taking
the football scholarship to play baseball
here. That's how I came around to playing
two sports."
Though during his freshman year
baseball was his personal favorite — "I
couldn't wait to get out (of football) for
baseball" — his attitude progressively
changed. "When I first got here, baseball
was probably 70 percent and football was
30 percent, but each year it got to 60-40
and then 50-50," the senior stated. "Now
it really is just 50-50."
Baseball, however, was major deter
minant in Cook's college football deci
sions, as he looked at programs that
would allow him to participate in both
sports. Along with some Ivy League
schools, Oklahoma State was eager for
him to pursue both of his athletic inter
ests. "They were recruiting me for foot
ball, and once they found out I played
baseball they really started calling a lot,"
Cook recalled.
Washington and USC also recruited
him, but did not provide the proper bal
ance of football and baseball.
The Cook family helped Toi con
siderably in his college decisions, and is
providing the same support in his current
deliberation. "They played a big part, not
in the decision-making aspect because
the decisions are not over yet, but more in
just being there.
"I'm really close with my family," Cook
said. "They were just up here this
weekend, and my dad came up for the
draft."
In fact. Cook was with his father when
he learned that he'd been picked by the
Saints. "We were at Sizzler when New Or
leans called, so my roommate John drove
all the way to tell me.
"I was kind of peeved because it was the
eighth round and I wanted to go earlier."

Cook candidly continued. "But my dad
was excited. I think he would have been
excited if I got drafted in the 12th by
anybody. It just goes to show that he's
proud of me no matter what happens."
His family has not pressured him either
for football or for baseball. "I think that's
one of the reasons I get along with my par
ents. They stand behind me no matter
what I do.
"My mom thinks I should play baseball,
but she knows I like to play football and
she doesn't try to say, 'Play baseball, play
baseball.'

"I think coming from a strong family
unit has made me a stronger person,"
Cook added. "Whenever things go wrong.
I can go to them, which is a big plus."
Cook is also secure about his long-term
plans. The sport he plays will simply de
termine when the communication major
will join the beautiful people in the show
business world.
"I don't know which sport I'm going to
play, but I'll play either sport as long as I
can, make some money and then from
there go into the movie industry," Cook
concluded.

didn't care. I was more interested in doing
well baseball-wise.
"Going into senior year. I wanted to play
baseball, but I got an offer. Stanford
found me. liked me and gave me a chance
here.
"The reason I came to Stanford was be
cause I would have gotten a chance to play
on their baseball team," Cook continued.
"That's what I wanted to do. I was taking
the football scholarship to play baseball
here. That's how I came around to playing
two sports."
Though during his freshman year
baseball was his personal favorite — "I
couldn't wait to get out (of football) for
baseball" — his attitude progressively
changed. "When I first got here, baseball
was probably 70 percent and football was
30 percent, but each year it got to 60-40
and then 50-50," the senior stated. "Now
it really is just 50-50."
Baseball, however, was major deter
minant in Cook's college football deci
sions, as he looked at programs that
would allow him to participate in both
sports. Along with some Ivy League
schools, Oklahoma State was eager for
him to pursue both of his athletic inter
ests. "They were recruiting me for foot
ball, and once they found out I played
baseball they really started calling a lot,"
Cook recalled.
Washington and USC also recruited
him, but did not provide the proper bal
ance of football and baseball.
The Cook family helped Toi con
siderably in his college decisions, and is
providing the same support in his current
deliberation. "They played a big part, not
in the decision-making aspect because
the decisions are not over yet, but more in
just being there.
"I'm really close with my family," Cook
said. "They were just up here this
weekend, and my dad came up for the
draft."
In fact. Cook was with his father when
he learned that he'd been picked by the
Saints. "We were at Sizzler when New Or
leans called, so my roommate John drove
all the way to tell me.
"I was kind of peeved because it was the
eighth round and I wanted to go earlier."

Cook candidly continued. "But my dad
was excited. I think he would have been
excited if I got drafted in the 12th by
anybody. It just goes to show that he's
proud of me no matter what happens."
His family has not pressured him either
for football or for baseball. "I think that's
one of the reasons I get along with my par
ents. They stand behind me no matter
what I do.
"My mom thinks I should play baseball,
but she knows I like to play football and
she doesn't try to say, 'Play baseball, play
baseball.'

"I think coming from a strong family
unit has made me a stronger person,"
Cook added. "Whenever things go wrong.
I can go to them, which is a big plus."
Cook is also secure about his long-term
plans. The sport he plays will simply de
termine when the communication major
will join the beautiful people in the show
business world.
"I don't know which sport I'm going to
play, but I'll play either sport as long as I
can, make some money and then from
there go into the movie industry," Cook
concluded.

Stanford senior Toi Cook is currently a favorite with autograph collectors, but
after the season ends, the Cardinal center fielder and cornerback will be putting
his signature on either a professional baseball or football contract
Spring can be a very stressful time for
college seniors. Though nearly through
with their studies, many students
anxiously and actively canvass the job
market in search for some form of employ
ment to survive in the cold, hard business
world.
Stanford senior Tol Cook is not among
this group.
Cook, cornerback in the fall and center
fielder in the spring, waits for offers to
come to htm. Already selected by the New
Orleans Saints in the eighth round of the
National Football League draft and sure to
be a draft choice in Major League
Baseball, Cook is one individual with a
pretty good future.
"I'm happy to be drafted by the Saints."
Cook said. "It's one of the teams I was in
different to. I didn't want to get drafted by
Minnesota, Atlanta, Green Bay or In
dianapolis.
"Being drafted by the Saints Is good be
cause it's a relatively young team. They
dldn t make the playoffs last year, but
they did come on strong. They have a
good defense," he added.
"I went in the eighth round, and the
reason I think is that none of the teams
wanted to waste an early round pick, a
fourth or fifth round pick." Cook said.
"They thought I might play baseball, and
they didn't want to waste the pick."
This hesitance is certainly well
founded. The cornerback/center fielder is
currently batting .324 for the Pacific 10
Conference champion Cardinal and is
second on the team in home runs with 10
- two features likely to earn him All
America honors this year.
"Even in the seventh round, teams were
calling and asking me what I wanted to
do, Cook recalled. "Actually I was playing
baseball, so they were asking my dad,
'Does Toi want to play in the NFL? What's
the deal with baseball?'
"When the Saints drafted me, they
asked what I wanted to do about baseball.
They're still a little wary of it,"he added.
"Baseball-wise, I want to see who I get
drafted by and what are my chances of
shooting up to the majors. I want to see
what team drafts me, and I'll take it from
there."
Thus, the big question still remains:
Will Toi Cook aim for the Hall of Fame in
Canton, Ohio, or in Cooperstown, N.Y. ?
"My preference would be to be drafted

by the Dodgers," said the Los Angeles
county resident, "and then play profes
sional baseball because you can play for
so long. But then there's the chance that
you might not make it and end up In the
minors for a while. That's the only thing
that would hold me back."
Economics will prove to be the deciding
factor, however. "I like both sports
equally, but I look at it more financially:
What's going to benefit me, what do I
want to do with my life.
"I haven't gotten a money offer from the
Saints yet," Cook said. "But my prefer
ence would be either to make it into the
Saints, or If I play baseball to make it into
the bigs within two years. My preference
is to make some money,"
Cook's invitation to professional foot
ball is not a guarantee that he will play. As
in baseball, a player has to try out and
make the team In order to play, but there
are no farm teams in the NFL. "So, my
preference would be to actually play," the
senior added.
Whichever sport he chooses to pursue.
Cook sees the transition from two sports
to one as a positive change. "There's no
question," he said.
"In baseball, for instance, everyone
plays year-round. They play summer
league, then they come play winter ball
and then they play through the season.
"I, on the other hand, come out in Jan
uary and play January to June and then
that's it," Cook noted. "I don't play in the
summer because I'm lifting for football."
He is equally behind his football
teammates because of baseball. "After
season, everyone starts lifting for next
year, so its almost a nine-month lifting
(period), where I, with school and
baseball, don't have time to lift. I'm only
able to lift June into August, so I only get
two, three months of lifting in.
"Actually, I think it hurts me more in
baseball than it does in football," Cook
said. "In football I'm pretty sure I might be
a little stronger if I lifted all year round,
but I can't see myself being much of a bet
ter player, where I know that if I played
baseball all year round I'd be a better
player."
The conflict was even worse for him in
high school, where he was a three-sport
athlete. "I started playing football when I
was in ninth grade. I'd always been a
baseball player, a basketball player and a
bowler. I went to Montclair Prep (in Van
Nuys, Calif.) and played all three sports
there (not including bowling)."

Though Cook received a scholarship at
Stanford to play football, his passion
throughout high school was baseball. "It's
so funny when 1 go back to school and all
the players ask what you've got to do to
get a scholarship," he said, "When 1
played high school football 1 just played. 1
didn't care. I was more interested in doing
well baseball-wise.
"Going into senior year. I wanted to play
baseball, but I got an offer. Stanford
