### KEN STEVENS Senior staff writer 
The 1987 women's tennis
season is far from over for Stan
ford, as the Cardinal will open the
defense of its 1986 team title to
morrow morning at UCLA. But
preparations for the 1988 season
have already begun, as Stanford
Coach Frank Brennan announced
Monday that he has signed three
of the top five high school seniors
in the country to letters of intent
to play for the Cardinal next year.
Tami and Teri Whitlinger. twin
nieces of Stanford Men's Asst.
Coach John Whitlinger, and
Sandra Birch will help to fill the
void created by the graduation
this year of three seniors.
"We couldn't be more pleased
with our recruiting." Brennan
said Monday. "Tami Whitlinger is
considered the No. 1 recruit in the
land, her sister, Teri, the No. 4
recruit, and Sandra Birch the No.
5. We lose three seniors from the
starting lineup in Patty Fendick,
Stephanie Savides and Leigh
Anne Eldredge, so all three

recruits will have an opportunity
to step right In."
Taml Whitlinger, the older of
the twins by five minutes, was the
recipient of the 1986 Junior Na
tional Tennis Player of the Year,
awarded by the Maureen Connolly
Brlnker Tennis Foundation. She
won the girls' 18s National Out
doors in 1986 and just last
weekend won the Seventeen Mag
azine's Tournament of Cham
pions. She was ranked No. 1 in
the nation as a 16-year-old by the
United States Tennis Association
(USTA).
Teri Whitlinger won the girls'
16's National Outdoors in 1985.
The Whitlingers will also bring a
proven doubles combination to
Stanford. Last year in the girls'
18's division, they won the Na
tional Clay Courts Champion
ships and the National Outdoor
Championships.
Birch would be the top recruit
for most teams. She was victori
ous in the girls' 18's singles divi
sion of the National Indoors last
year. Birch is currently ranked No.
1 in singles in the East.
