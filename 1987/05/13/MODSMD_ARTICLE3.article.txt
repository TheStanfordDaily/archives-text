The Board of Trustees yesterday approved
measures that will make Green Library
safer and bring two of Stanford's athletic
facilities up to date.
The trustees also gave preliminary ap
proval for purchase of a building in Wash
ington, D.C., to house a branch campus
that Stanford plans to open there next
spring.
Stanford is currently searching for a cen
trally located facility that could house 30
students and a faculty member. The esti
mated cost of the Washington facility is *3
million to $4 million.
The trustees gave final approval to a *5.5
million plan to brace the tiered stacks in
Green Library to make it safer in case of an
earthquake. The trustees judged that Green
is one of the most dangerous buildings at
Stanford because there is no seismic
bracing.
The trustees also approved con
struction of a team locker facility
and new restrooms at Sunken
Diamond. Baseball players now
must use the locker facilities at
Encina Gym across Campus Drive
from the field, and both players
and spectators must use
restrooms outside Sunken Dia
mond, near Stanford Stadium.
The board gave preliminary ap
proval to a *2 million plan to build
new tennis facilities, including an
indoor practice court, a new 900-
seat grandstand for the existing
outdoor facility, new restrooms
and a new locker area. All the new
facilities would be added to the
tennis complex at the corner of
Campus Drive and Sam McDonald
Road.
