# Kennedy issues letter; minorities plan to protest
## Committee will study demands 
### RUSSELL KOROBKIN Editorial staff 
University President Donald
Kennedy and Provost James Rosse
have appointed a three-member
committee to study the demands
made by a coalition of campus
minority organizations last week.
In a joint statement sent to the
minority groups Monday, the ad
ministrators also reiterated the
message of a statement released
Thursday, saying the proposals
are worthy of careful considera
tion but more time is needed
before they can be approved or dis
approved.
"Although our response was
characterized as 'disrespectful' by
the proposers, our intent was
quite the opposite: We take a very
positive view of efforts to improve
minority representation at Stan
ford and to help the institution to
become more effective at fulfilling
their needs.
"It is still our position, however,
that these proposals require care
ful study before we can generate a
useful response," the statement
said.
The Rainbow Agenda, com
prised of the Black Student Union
(BSU), MEChA (the chicano stu
dent organization), the Asian

American Students Association
(AASA) and the Stanford Ameri
can Indian Organization, pre
sented a list of five demands at a
press conference last Tuesday. It
also presented a list of seven
"Immediate" demands to Rosse
Friday.
The lists included the establish
ment of a vice provost for minority
affairs and a commission to study
the quality of minority life at Stan
ford, an Admissions Office budget
for minority recruitment and Ad
ministration support for the West
ern Culture Task Force's recom
mendations. The list also
demanded that Kennedy make a
statement at the Cornerstone
Celebration supporting ethnic
theme houses and guaranteeing
the Indian will never return as the
Stanford mascot.
The Kennedy/Rosse statement
said: "On the whole, we see much
hope for constructive progress. To
that end, we have appointed a
small working committee that
represents the offices most af
fected by the new proposals. The
provost, the acting dean of Stu
dent Affairs and the dean of Ad
missions have each appointed
personal representatives to serve
on the committee. They are,
respectively, Jacyn Lewis, Mar

garet Ann Fidler, and John Bun
nell."
Fidler said she did not know the
timetable the committee will have
or how it will go about examining
the minority group demands, but
said she thought the group will
"get to work pretty hard and pretty
fast" and added that the Rainbow
Agenda's demands would be
"taken very seriously."
Lewis and Bunnell could not be
reached for comment last night.
Kennedy said yesterday that the
Administration was "taking their
(the Rainbow Agenda's) concerns
very seriously."
Representatives of the Rainbow
Agenda agreed that the statement
was a step in the right direction,
but not forceful enough.
AASA representative Vivian Wu,
who called last Thursday's state
ment "very disrespectful," said
Monday's statement was
"definitely better," but did not go
far enough.
She said the minority coalition
appreciates the fact that Kennedy
and Rosse are taking their
proposals seriously, but still ques
tions their commitment to
minority needs.
"Some of the basic things we
think they could have said 'Yes' to
immediately, and they didn't," she

said, adding that the demand for a
commission to study the quality of
minority life at Stanford was "easy
to say 'Yes' to."
She said the appointment of the
committee was "a good step" be
cause it will allow students some
imput in the decision-making
process, but that Kennedy and
Rosse are the top decision-makers
at the University and they should
be the officials considering these
issues.
MEChA representative George
Cuevas called the committee "a
step in the right direction" but
said he was disappointed with the
selection process. He said that
