# Demonstration will precede celebration
## 
### RUSSELL KOROBKIN Editorial staff 
Members of a coalition of
minority groups announced yes
terday plans for a demonstration
Thursday to protest Stanford's
Centennial Celebration and "100
years of racism."
The announcement followed by
five days a joint statement from
University President Donald Ken
nedy and Provost James Rosse in
which they appointed a committee
to study the recent proposals of
the minority groups and
reiterated their position that last
week's demands "require careful
study" before a "useful response"
can be generated.
The demonstration will be spon
sored by the Rainbow Agenda, the
coalition that presented a list of
five demands at a press confer
ence last Tuesday, and a list of
seven immediate demands to
Rosse Friday. The coaltion is
made up of the Black Student Un
ion (BSU), the Asian American
Students Association (AASA),
MEChA, the campus chicano or

ganization, and the Stanford
American Indian Organization.
Bill King, incoming chair of the
Black Student Union (BSU), said
the demonstration will not inter
fere with the Cornerstone Celebra
tion, scheduled to begin at 2 p.m.
in the Inner Quad.
"Right now we aren't planning
on any events that might impose
on the proceedings," he said.
"Nobody I've talked to is interested
in ruining the birthday party."
King qualified the guarantee,
however. He said the scale of the
demonstration will "depend on
Rosses statements and the tone
we're getting from the Administra
tion."
The Rainbow Agenda presented
a list of seven immediate demands
to Rosse on Friday. In a press
release, the group wrote "the scale
of the demonstration will depend
on how many of the demands are
met by Thursday."
Kennedy said yesterday there is
little chance that "we'll get much
more done by Thursday." He and
Rosse appointed a three-member
group Monday to study the
proposals of the coalition.
One of the coalition's demands
to Rosse called for Kennedy to
"actively support ethnic theme
houses" and "clearly state that
Stanford will never reinstate the

American Indian as Its mascot" in
his Centennial address.
In a Joint statement Monday
with Rosse. Kennedy said
"statements have been made in
the past (in support of ethnic
theme houses and in opposition
to the Indian) and we are both
happy to reiterate them here and
now."
But Kennedy said yesterday that
no statement will be made on
these issues during this
weekend's Cornestone Celebra

tlon. "Neither of those subjects is
related to the remarks I've already
prepared," he said.
According to King, the demon
stration will begin with a noon
press conference in White Plaza
and be followed by a rally and a
march to the Quad. He said the
march would be completed before
2 p.m.
King said he thought security
would be tight Thursday since
Secretary of State George Shultz
and other dignitaries will be on

campus, but he said he "hopes the
security will respect the students'
rights to assemble.
Rosse and Kennedy are working
under the assumption that every
one at Stanford is happy, King
added, "We're not happy at the
University and we don't feel like
we're involved."
AASA representative Vivian Wu
said the Centennial doesn't mean
the same things to minorities as it
does to other students. "The his
tory of Leland Stanford and Stan

ford University is racist." she said.
Wu went on to say the Univer
sity didn't admit minority stu
dents when it opened Its doors 96
years ago. and that Leland Stan
ford exploited Chinese railroad
workers and then, as governor,
passed laws excluding Chinese
people from the state.
Kennedy said he didn't object to
the timing of the protest, but
worried that it might hurt the
group in the eyes of the public.
