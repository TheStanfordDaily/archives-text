### RUSSELL KOROBKIN Editorial staff 
Members of a coalition of
minority groups announced yes
terday plans for a demonstration
Thursday to protest Stanford's
Centennial Celebration and "100
years of racism."
The announcement followed by
five days a joint statement from
University President Donald Ken
nedy and Provost James Rosse in
which they appointed a committee
to study the recent proposals of

made up of the Black Student Un

Students Association (AASA),
MEChA, the campus chicano or

American Indian Organization.

in the Inner Quad.
"Right now we aren't planning
on any events that might impose

"Nobody I've talked to is interested
in ruining the birthday party."
King qualified the guarantee,

demonstration will "depend on
Rosses statements and the tone
we're getting from the Administra
tion."
The Rainbow Agenda presented
a list of seven immediate demands
to Rosse on Friday. In a press
release, the group wrote "the scale
of the demonstration will depend
on how many of the demands are
met by Thursday."
Kennedy said yesterday there is
little chance that "we'll get much
more done by Thursday." He and
