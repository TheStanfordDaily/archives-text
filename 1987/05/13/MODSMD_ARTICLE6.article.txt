## 
### JOHN LIS Editorial staff 
An assistant district attorney
for Santa Clara County yesterday
called the Stanford Police report
on the drowning death of junior
David Dunshee "far from com
plete" and sent it back to Stanford
for more information.
Asst. District Attorney Ron Rico
returned the report to Stanford
Police Chief Marvin Herrington
because it contained "nothing on
the cause of death or the blood al
cohol level, basically." he said.
"Talk to Chief Herrington about
the rest," Rico said. "I'd like to get
the report from the police, not the
papers." Herrington was un
available for comment yesterday.
Herrington said Monday,
however, that the police had
finished the report and turned it
over to the district attorney's of
fice Friday. He added that the

report lacked only the findings of
the coroner's Investigation, which
the coroner's office said will be
released In two to four weeks.
Herrington said Dunshee had
been drinking at a Zeta Psi rush
party at the Boathouse, left the
party under the influence of alco
hol at about 1 a.m. on April 22, fell
Into Lagunita, and drowned be
cause he was too intoxicated to
swim to shore.
The Stanford Police report con
tains the names of the Individuals
who allegedly purchased the alco
hol that 20-year-old Dunshee
drank, Herrington said.
Rico said he will wait until he
receives a satisfactory report of
the incident before deciding
whether to charge those who
bought the alcohol with violating
California laws against providing
alcohol to anybody under the age
