Contra cash put in wrong account
WASHINGTON — A >10 million contribution from the sultan of
Brunei to the Nicaraguan contras ended up apparently by mistake
In the bank account of a wealthy Swiss businessman because the
sultan was given the wrong account number last year, officials of
the Senate Iran-contra committee said yesterdayy.
The unidentified businessman, described by Swiss authorities
as a 60-year-old executive Involved in shipping and other activi
ties. put the *10 million Into a certificate of deposit and has
earned *253.000 in interest. Jhe money has now been frozen by
Swiss authorities, according to Mark Belnick, executive assistant
to the chief counsel of the Senate Iran-contra committee.
Belnick said the Swiss are investigating whether criminal
charges should be lodged against the businessman, but have not
determined whether a crime was committed.
The businessman has told Swiss authorities he is accustomed
to handling large sums of money and assumed that the *10 mil
lion was owed to him from one of his transactions, Belnick added.
Congressional and State Department investigators have been
trying to determine what happened to the money since the contri
bution became public late last year. The *10 million represented
the largest secret contra donation unaccounted for in the ongoing
investigation.
When the sultan's donation became public, the contras denied
receiving the money, and Asst. Secretaiy of State Elliott Abrams,
who has acknowledged soliciting the contribution to "bridge the
gap" in U.S. aid to the rebels, said he didn't know where It ended
up.
Heart from living man transplanted
BALTIMORE — Surgeons here have implanted a heart and two
lungs into a desperately ill 28-year-old cystic fibrosis patient after
removing his own healthy heart and damaged lungs. Then they
Implanted the man's healthy heart into another patient who was
dying of heart failure, Johns Hopkins University said yesterday.
The controversial operations, which began Monday and did not
conclude until early yesterday morning, are believed to be the first
time that a heart from a living person has been used in a
transplant.
Most donor hearts come from victims of traffic accidents who
are declared brain dead. The donor of the heart and lungs was a
32-year-old traffic accident victim.
Both the cystic fibrosis patient and the recipient of his heart, a
38-year-old man, were in critical but stable condition, as to be ex
pected, the university said yesterday. The hospital did not identify
the three.
Dr. William Baumgartner, one of the Johns Hopkins surgeons,
said the surgical team removed the man's healthy heart as well as
his lungs because experience in the 1970s showed that lung
transplants alone had dismal results.
Transplanting a heart and two lungs, Baumgartner said in a
telephone interview yesterday, "was the best available therapy for
this patient."
Hope for Euromissile clouded
BRUSSELS, Belgium — Hopes for a Euromissile agreement by
this summer have faded in recent weeks, as West Germany has
equivocated on the latest Soviet proposal and Moscow has
muddied the waters with controversial and inconsistent
proposals at the arms talks In Geneva, according to U.S. and West
ern Alliance officials.
At the same time, new signs of movement have appeared in the
long-range strategic arms reduction talks, known as START, and
In the space defense area, which has long been viewed as the most
difficult. Among the signs:
□ In the START talks, the Soviets have responded to the U.S.
draft treaty presented last week by promising to submit their own
draft — "and sooner than you think," a Soviet official said — of a
proposed agreement that would reduce arsenals on both sides by
50 percent over five or seven years. Faster progress can be made,
officials said, by working with formal treaty language rather than
proposals.
□ In the missile defense area, Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev
has called for prohibiting deployment of a U.S. missile shield, in
contrast to Soviet negotiators at Geneva who want to stop the de
velopment of such a shield under President Reagan's proposed
Strategic Defense Initiative, known as "Star Wars."
The United States has already offered to forgo deployment for
seven years but refuses to bar research and development of missile
defenses. Gorbachev's choice of words could lead to progress in
the negotiations If they signal a shift in Moscow's opposition to
Soviets play new role to Afghans
KABUL, Afghanistan — The Soviet Union is establishing a vast
network of trade, aid and cultural relations with Afghanistan that
Is more elaborate than Its military presence and seems intended
to endure even if some or all of the Soviet soldiers are brought
home.
Afghan Prime Minister Sultan All Keshtmand recently put the
Soviet financial contribution at 40 percent of Afghanistan's civil
ian budget. Other experts estimated Moscow now spends more
than *300 million a year here to provide many day-to-day needs,
not counting military assistance or support costs for the 9.000
Soviet civilian advisers. The Soviets are also seeking to Inculcate
future loyalties by developing a core of Russian-speaking Afghans,
including thousands of youngsters educated in Soviet schools.
It is a far cry from those early days of the "great game" of the late
19th and early 20th century when British and Russian agents
vied for influence with the rulers In Kabul as part of the struggle
over this mountainous passageway to the riches of India and the
warm waters of the Indian Ocean.
Press comments on media's role
PARIS — Europeans often seem bewildered by Americans' fas
cination with the private lives of politicians, but for the most part
European commentators have shown a surprising degree of un
derstanding of the way politics worked in connection with the fall
of Gary Hart.
The French press, for example, regards stories dealing with poli
tical sex scandals with contempt, the province of Its Anglo-Saxon
colleagues in Britain and the United States.
Yet in the Hart case, French newspapers have been quick to cau
tion readers not to look on the former presidential candidate as a
victim of Anglo-Saxon purltanism. Character and truthfulness,
the newspapers say. are the real issues.
The British press, meanwhile, has tended to see the Hart affair
as a fascinating change of pace, a departure from domestic pec
cadilloes. West German publications have generally deplored the
press' peering into Hart's private life but at the same time have ob
jected to his behavior.
In Italy, where philandering has an honored history, a good bit
of sympathy has been expressed for Hart, along with criticism of
the "American madness" that permits such things to happen. The
Japanese press has reported the Hart incident but virtually with
out comment. Mistresses are not at all unusual among Japanese
political figures.
