Berkeley, September 25, 1902
Dear Mrs. Stanford:
I had today the great pleasure of visiting the new chapel which you
have added to the resources of Stanford University, and I cannot
forbear sending you a word of thanks in behalf of interests I
represent for this great good you have done the state. . . As the
generations pass through this building they will be uplifted and
inspired toward better and larger living, and all of us will share the
blessing.
