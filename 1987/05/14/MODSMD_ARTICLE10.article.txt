# Reagan acknowledges meeting with Fahd
## 
### 
WASHINGTON — President Reagan said yes
terday that his private diary shows he dis
cussed with King Fahd a contribution by
Saudi Arabia to the Nicaraguan rebels — but
he asserted that It was the king who raised the
subject at the end of a White House meeting
and that "there was no solicitation that I know
of or anything of the kind."
In testimony Monday before the congres
sional committees investigating the Iran
contra affair, former national security adviser
Robert McFarlane said that Reagan apparently
talked about the rebels' desperate need for
money when he met with the Saudi king in
February 1985.
Shortly after that, McFarlane said, he
learned that the Saudis had doubled their con

tribution to the contras to *2 million a month.
The meeting came at a time when both
direct and indirect U.S. goverment aid to the
Contras was banned by Congress.
Reagan, responding to reporters' questions
while posing for photographers with
Guatemalan President Vinicio Cerezo, said:
"My diary shows that I never brought it up
and it shows that the king, before he left, told
me that he was doing that, and that he was
going to increase the aid."
Asked how he responded, Reagan said, "Oh,
I think I expressed pleasure that he was doing
that."
Private contributions to the rebels have been
a key focus of the congressional hearings in
their second week, as committee members

have tried to determine the extent of Reagan's
possible involvement in helping to finance the
contras' cause during the period of the aid
ban.
His comments, and those by McFarlane over
the past several days, have also shed light on
Reagan's private, handwritten diary of his
time in office. Congressional investigators
have been given limited access to the material
in their effort to probe Reagan's thoughts and
actions during the time the Iran arms sale and
secret operations to aid the contras were under
way.
The subject of the *32 million Saudi contri
bution to the anti-Sandinista rebels is a
diplomatically sensitive subject.
