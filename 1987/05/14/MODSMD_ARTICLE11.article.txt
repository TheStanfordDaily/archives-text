# Twelve chosen for Soviet exchange
## 
### MONIQUE SCHEER Senior staff writer 
Twelve Stanford students have been selected
to take part in a two-week program in the So
viet Union next winter with students from
nine other U.S. colleges.
Called the Stanford-Soviet Exchange Project,
the program is coordinated nationally by the
Citizen Exchange Council but student-run
here, according to Dennis Matthies. Otero resi
dent fellow and program adviser.
Juniors Alma Derricks, James Driscoll.
Deborah Gilman, Kathy Healey, Michael Lu,
John Pollack. Harpal Sandhu. Lili Shaver,
freshmen Kim Grose and Nadeem Hussain and
senior David Kang were the 12 students cho
sen from 115 applicants. Matthies said. Travel
experience, involvement In activities, and di
versity across class and ethnic groups were
considered in the selection process, he said.
Language ability was not necessary for par
ticipation in the program, according to
Matthies. "Just a couple of people needed to

know Russian," he said.
John Pearson, director of the Overseas
Resource Center and a member of the selection
committee, said he was looking for "somebody
I thought would open up and be interesting In
a small group."
The students will spend two weeks at a So
viet university, where they will participate in a
variety of formal and informal debates and dis
cussions on current issues.
Soviet authorities have not yet chosen the
university that the students will visit, but "we
get the feeling the Soviets would like to pair us
with Novosibirsk (in Siberia), because it has a
strong technical bent like Stanford," said Kris
ten Edwards, a graduate student in history
who helped with the administration of the pro
gram.
Although the exact dates of the trip have not
been set, the group will probably leave at the
end of winter quarter next year, according to
Edwards.
Before students leave they must take at least
one five-unit class on some aspect of Soviet

culture and participate In a three- to five-unit
seminar designed specifically for them during
winter quarter.
Edwards said she feels the general purpose
of the program is to "raise consciousness." The
students should attempt to understand Soviet
culture and share their experiences with
others In order "to demystify the other
country," she said.
The exchange program is not intended to be
exclusively academic. "The program falls some
where between being extracurricular and aca
demic," Edwards said.
As part of the exchange, about 15 Soviet stu
dents will be visiting Stanford for about two
weeks either in the fall or winter, Edwards
said. The 150 students chosen by Soviet auth
orities to visit 10 colleges In the U.S. will prob
ably be leaders of the Communist Party Youth
Organization, Matthies said.
"This Is a very large first step for the Soviet
Union," Matthies said. "They only let out the
tiniest trickle of students before."
