# Roble RF finds injured resident
## 
### 
A seriously Injured Roble Hall
resident was found by a resi
dent fellow early Tuesday morn
ing and rushed to Stanford
Hospital, according to acting
Dean of Student Affairs Norm
Robinson.
According to Robinson. Resi
dent Fellow Ann Porteus found
the student between 6 and 7
a.m. in a Roble hallway and
called paramedics. Robinson
said the student was con
scious, but Stanford Police
Chief Marvin Herrington said
he was unconscious when
police arrived on the scene.
A hospital spokesperson said
the student is in stable condi
tion but suffered a fractured
lumbar one â€” a vertebra in the
lower back.

Robinson said last night he
has "no idea" how the student
was injured.
Earlier in the day Robinson
said he thought the student
had possibly Jumped, but cer
tainly fallen, from a window. He
later said he did not have the
facts straight when he made
his initial comments.
Debbie Ferdinandsen, a
nurse at Stanford Hospital,
said a fractured lumbar one
could cause permanent spinal
damage depending on the
seriousness of the fracture, but
usually does not.
Stanford Hospital would not
release details of the student's
condition.
Porteus refused to comment
on the incident, as did Roble
resident assistants.
