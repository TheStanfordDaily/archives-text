## THE
						STANFORD DAILY An Independent Newspaper Happy Birthday! 
### 
Today we celebrate the 100 th anniversary
of Stanford University. On this day in 1887,
Leland Stanford himself sealed the Corner
stone of what was to be the Quad. The 8,800
acres of Stanford are now home to dozens of
buildings, several businesses and 13,000
students. It is unlikely that anyone could
have imagined the spectacular growth that
has taken place on this Palo Alto farm in the
last century.
Memorial Arch marked the entrance to the
Quad before it was destroyed in the
earthquake of 1906. A frieze was carved into
the arch that illustrated the progress of
civilization. The ideal of progress has been
with Stanford ever since, and at a time like
this, it is easy to celebrate what has been ac
complished here.
Many great scientific discoveries have been
made here, and so many Stanford alumni
have gone on to do great things. The faculty
in the humanities and social sciences is
among the best in the world.
Still, during this time of celebration it is
very easy to forget what has yet to be accom
plished. The Centennial organizers are well
aware of this and as a result have made the

event not only a time to look back but also a
time to look forward.
The five-year fund-raising drive that has
been going on will ensure that Stanford's
growth will last well into the future. Major
portions of the campus will be rebuilt, chairs
will be endowed for 100 new professors and
an increase in funding for finanacial aid will
allow Stanford's need-blind admissions pro
gram to continue.
It would be easy for a university that has
done so much in such a relatively short time
to rest on its laurels. Stanford cannot let this
happen.
There remain specific improvements to be
made on the Farm, from the building of
enough housing to allow all undergraduates
to live on campus, to the increased recruit
ment of minority faculty, to the development
of better sports facilities. A myriad of issues
wait to be answered.
It would be wise to keep the past — and the
future — in mind for the next three days. It
would be equally wise to take advantage of
the speeches, forums and parties that will be
going on. The Centennial Celebration is a
once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. It should not
be missed.
