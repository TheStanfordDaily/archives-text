Priorities Jor
Draw unequal
I remember the eyes fixed upon
me. My hand caressed thousands
of little manlla envelopes. In one
lay my destiny and that of all my
close friends. It said "2954."
There's a cold shiver that runs
down your spine when you look at
Round One results and you're
unasslgned.
At least I'm not a freshman at
Cal; sleeping on park benches,
having bonfires in oil drums,
drinking the dregs of a broken
bottle of Jack Daniel's to forget
the rotten world. I'm guaranteed
at Stanford. And I'm only paying
♦ 10,000 more.
I think special priorities were
invented so everyone would have
to see how extravagantly the
other half lives before drawing
2954. Its hard to face up to the
reality that you'll probably never
live in Toyon. Life In such places
— the king-size beds, continental
breakfasts, multicolored food —
floats away like a distant memory.
How do I explain it back home?
Returning residencies? Special
priorities? It's difficult to explain
to a friend from Cal why you're
draining your family's life savings
to live in a trailer.
A senior in my house has lived
In the same place for all four
years. She gets a blank look on
her face when you mention
Toyon. We need a reverse priority
so that those of us who get
screwed one year get a better shot
next year.
Round Two will provide shelter
but still no opportunities to enjoy
the lifestyles offered by many
campus residences. Good friends
may be split. When some houses
have singles, saunas, pool tables
and projection televisions and

others have all of the architec
tural finesse of Alcatraz, equity In
housing must be more than the
luck of the Draw.

Freshman, undeclared
Fraternities
are elites,
not minorities
Recently. The Daily printed a
shrill attack by Greg Kennedy
(Dally, May 4) on us and the other
members of the Trancos staff for
attempting to coerce freshmen in
our house to decline bids from
his fraternity, Sigma Chi. Ken
nedy's description of our activi
ties is almost entirely erroneous.
As resident fellows, our only
involvement in the rush process
was the distribution of the letter
and article to which Kennedy
refers. Our letter stated that,
although in our opinion
residences offer "more diversity of
people and experience and,
therefore, more personal chal
lenges," we hoped students would
consider "all options and all sides
to the question" and make the
best choices for themselves.
At any rate, our bias is not
against fraternities butJor
residences, whose advantages can
be overlooked in the heat of the
rush process. We certainly never
"Instructed the resident assis
tants to convince the freshmen
not to accept bids" as Kennedy
claimed, nor did we confer with
them about their decision to
speak with members of the house
who had received bids.
Up to now we have only been
trying to clarify the facts of this
incident. But Kennedy's letter

raises a more important general
issue. It closes by saying that,
"like the members of all minority
groups on campus, we seek fair
representation." Many debates
now engaging members of the
Stanford community turn on the
issue of fair representation — the
Area One requirement, for exam
ple, or the concerns of ethnic
minorities. But for Kennedy to
wrap fraternal organizations on
this campus in the cloak of a
"minority group" — even if only
as a rhetorical ploy — shows
arrant insensitivity to the deep
concerns of ethnic minorities at
Stanford.
Fraternities are not a minority
except in the trivial sense that
applies to any sufficiently narrow
subset of a community. They are
an elite. An elite enjoys special
privileges not extended to all
members of a community. Frater
nities are the only residential
group on campus with the right
to decide who may and who may
not join their group. Further, the
privilege seems to carry no public
accountability for its exercise, so
to the community at large the
criteria used can appear as sub
jective and, in some cases, self
stereotyping. Since residence
staffs function as advocates for all
members of a residence, they
have a natural concern when
some students are denied oppor
tunities extended to others for no
explicit reason.
The privilege of self-selection at
a place like Stanford should carry
with it a special responsibility to
create a living group in sympathy
with our vital community goals of
diversity, responsibility, intellec
tual growth and sensitivity to
issues of ethnicity, gender and
sexuality.

issue. It closes by saying that,
"like the members of all minority
groups on campus, we seek fair
representation." Many debates
now engaging members of the
Stanford community turn on the
issue of fair representation — the
Area One requirement, for exam
ple, or the concerns of ethnic
minorities. But for Kennedy to
wrap fraternal organizations on
this campus in the cloak of a
"minority group" — even if only
as a rhetorical ploy — shows
arrant insensitivity to the deep
concerns of ethnic minorities at
Stanford.
Fraternities are not a minority
except in the trivial sense that
applies to any sufficiently narrow
subset of a community. They are
an elite. An elite enjoys special
privileges not extended to all
members of a community. Frater
nities are the only residential
group on campus with the right
to decide who may and who may
not join their group. Further, the
privilege seems to carry no public
accountability for its exercise, so
to the community at large the
criteria used can appear as sub
jective and, in some cases, self
stereotyping. Since residence
staffs function as advocates for all
members of a residence, they
have a natural concern when
some students are denied oppor
tunities extended to others for no
explicit reason.
The privilege of self-selection at
a place like Stanford should carry
with it a special responsibility to
create a living group in sympathy
with our vital community goals of
diversity, responsibility, intellec
tual growth and sensitivity to
issues of ethnicity, gender and
sexuality.
