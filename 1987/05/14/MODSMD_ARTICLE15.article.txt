# Depression has many causes
## 
### 
In a recent column (Daily, May 4), Scott Lyon
criticized a Newsweek article on depression.
Regarding the roots and treatment of depres
sion, he upbraided both the article and scien
tific researchers for putting too little emphasis
on human life experience and too much on sci
ence, drugs and "dynamic brain mapping."

TOM SCHUTZ

I applaud him for scolding the article be
cause Newsweek Is a dlshrag that should be
lambasted at every opportunity. Nevertheless, I
think his views on depression and medical re
search are poorly thought out. In response,
here is my understanding of the matter:
I think it is most accurate to view depression
as a symptom of an underlying disorder, and
not as a primary problem in itself (similar to
fever, for instance). There is more than one
kind of problem which causes depression and
therefore more than one appropriate treat
ment. Maybe you're "depressed" because your
dog ate your philosophy paper and now you'll
get a B- In the class. A sympathetic ear from a
friend, maybe a few choice words and little
sulking could be an effective way to handle it. If
you were born with genes that don't provide
your neurons with enough of some esoterlcally
named chemical, and this causes depression,
then the best recourse may be pharmacological
treatment to help tune your brain. If you've
been feeling deeply depressed ever since you
were fired from your job. you no longer find
much interest or pleasure in life and have no
energy or appetite, then you are dealing with
yet another type of underlying cause, and you

would try to find a trained counselor who can
address the roots of the problem with you. And
so on. (These were Intended as illustrations,
not as medical advice.)
But when are you simply bummed out, and
when do you have a "serious problem"? In the
case where an organic disorder Is causing the
depression, there is no controversy in labeling
the disorder a "disease" and the depression a
"symptom," and subjecting oneself to physical
treatment. But this is one extreme on the con
tinuum. There is difficulty in deciding where
to distinguish between healthy states and
disease states. "Healthy" can't be equated with
"normal" because it is certainly normal to
beome sick.
I think that any source of unhappiness is a
potential "disease." As soon as someone
recognizes a source of unhappiness, takes
steps to elucidate the mechanism and begins
to think about countermeasures, it's chalked
up to the "Illness" category. When you have It
you go to the doctor. Prior to this, the condi
tion was simply an unpleasant fact of life that
had to be toughed out, or worse. It was a weak
ness of character, a punishment for evil deeds.
Alcoholism, for Instance, is currently consid
ered a disease by many people now that some
social and hereditary precipitators have been
identified. My impression is that In former
years it was generally considered a weakness of
character. Who knows, maybe In two years
you'll go to the doctor to have your procrastina
tion treated.
Scott Lyon complained. "It burns me to no
end to hear people Jubilantly discuss the new
research that can do wonders once a person is
affected but doesn't do anything for the person
before he's actually diagnosed." Naturally, we

I think it is most accurate
to view depression as a
symptom

all agree that prevention Is the best policy but I
for one am not at all perturbed that resources
are being devoted to curative medicine. No
matter how many preventive precautions you
take, you will eventually get sick, and when
that happens you'll be the neighborhood's
most enthusiastic proponent of curative
medicine.
Who knows what the ideal balance is be
tween preventive and fixative medicine? Would
It be effective to pour more money Into the
former? Prevention sure encounters a lot of
resistance: Look at how many people still
smoke, still drive motorbikes without helmets
and cars without seat belts, still pork out on
grease and salt and cholesterol. ... It almost
looks like some of us actively seek out
catastrophe.
Finally, media nype (the two words are
nearly synonymous in our world) about hi-tech
breakthroughs and treatment protocols to
cure your ailments Is a mixed blessing. Many
suffering people can often be helped by a new
technique, and in this sense the big headlines
are a wonderful way to break the good news
and celebrate a little bit. On the other hand, all
the hoopla about advances in medical science
may create the false impression that technol
ogy can cure all woes, at which point we would
have not only a right to quality health care but
a right to a cure. That'll be the day.
