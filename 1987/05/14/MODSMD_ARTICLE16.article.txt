# Nothing like exercise
## 
### 
You sometimes hear pundits worrying that Stan
ford students have become too smug and elitist,
buoyed by their academic, intellectual success. Per
sonally, if I ever start to feel "too big for my britches" I
have a sure-fire self-cure. I take a gym class. Nothing
works better to remind me of my human frailty and
to put me in my place.

"A healthy mind in a healthy body" has never been
my motto. Since you can't see the body that goes un
der this charmingly pictured face, let me just say
that it hasn't taken too many victory laps round the
race track. (Although I did win a red ribbon in the
bicycle-decorating contest at my fifth-grade track
meet.) It so happens that I take after Elizabeth Taylor
and not Jane Fonda when it comes to body type.
I'm also a four-star klutz. I learned to read two
years before I learned to tie my shoes. Which is not to
say I was a reading prodigy. I tripped over loose laces
until the second grade.
But for some perverse reason, I was inspired this
spring to take a gym class. After all, I thought, this is
your last quarter at Stanford, take advantage. When
in Rome, do as the Romans. When in California . . .
practice body beautiful.
So, I signed up for Intermediate Swimming. Swim
ming, an exercise where no one can see you sweat.
An exercise where you stay cool and refreshed at all
times. My kind of exercise.
I went to Roble Gym to register. The nice girl in the
window said the class would be taught by a Skip
Kenney. I could see Skip in my mind's eye: a lanky
undergrad, a sophomore perhaps, trendy blond hair,
beat-up deck shoes. Some nice preppy kid, eager to
please. This would be a snap.
I go to class, my copy of The Daily in hand. After all,
I need something to read while I tan. For some rea
son, I turn to the sports section. My eyes widen with
horror. This class is not taught by some pimply-faced
prep. My teacher is the best men's swimming coach
in the United States? He's just been named NCAA
Coach of the Year for the third time? Oh God. Is it too
late to drown myself?
He strides out on the deck, master of all he sur
veys. His lip curls as he inspects our pale, fleshy
bodies from his lean, tanned face.
"I know why you're taking this course," he an
nounces. "You just sat around all winter, not doing
anything. You're flabby. Now you've got to go out in
public in a bathing suit. Well don't worry. I'm going
to get you into shape. Everyone into the pool!"
Forty-five blurred minutes whiz by. I drag myself

out of the water, a beached whale. I haven't drowned,
this time. I'm not dead, yet. I just want to be. I swear
I'll never come back.
I do go back of course. After a few more classes,
things get a bit easier. I no longer feel like throwing
up at the end of each class. Instead, I'm so scared of
Coach Kenney I feel like throwing up before each
class begins.
I arrive early one morning, giving myself time to
get psyched up. At the other end of the pool, the ad
vanced water polo class warms up. I watch two
aquajocks performing their stretching exercises on
the pool's edge. Every mondo-amazing muscle moves
silkily under their dark even tans. I take solace in the
thought that not everybody can be an athlete. Some
of us are, well, intellectuals. I mean, listen to these
guys, having some frat-boy argument about their
girlfriends.
Yup. They're fighting about "Hedda," "Nora" and
"Virginia." I suddenly realize that they're arguing
about Virginia Woolf and Henrick Ibsen, and what
Woolf would have thought of Ibsen's female charac
ters. My two "dumb jocks" finish their debate about
the portrayal of women in early modern fiction and
perform two perfect shallow dives into the pool. Their
bodies slice smoothly through the top of the water.
I am completely demoralized. I drop myself limply
over the side of the pool, float in a vaguely fetal posi
tion and muse about the terribly unfair way in which
God aportions her gifts. - -
But there's no time for self-pity. There's only time
to swim. In this environment no one cares about
your GPA, your job experience, your snazzy new blue
suit. All that matters is speed, endurance and tech
nique. None of which I have. In this class, I'm at the
bottom far left of the bell curve.
I like my swim class. Really. It's shrunk both my
flab and my ego. And the other day Coach Kenney,
Lord of deGuerre Pool, spoke to me.
"How's It going?" he barked, kindly.
"Better, better I think," I panted, squinting up at
him through chlorine-clouded eyes.
"Yes," he smiled, casting his eyes over my class
mates as they dried themselves down with gaudy
beach towels. He looked like God surveying creation
on the seventh day."The whole class is improving.
Much, much better."
I think I'm actually happy to be such a rotten ath
lete. The slightest improvement is as wonderful as
winning an Olympic gold medal. I gain immense
satisfaction simply from remembering not to inhale
the water.
I hope those aforementioned gorgeous Ibsen
reading water polo jocks have some weaknesses. I
hope there's something they still can't do. How dull it
would be if life held no challenges.
Hey, for me, life will never be dull. After I conquer
the pool, I can rejoice in the fact that I can't (yet) play
squash, speak Japanese, knit or change a tire.
