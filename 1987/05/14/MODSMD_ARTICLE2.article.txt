# ACLU may expand diver's NCAA suit
## 
### CLINT HIGHFILL Senior staff writer 
Diver Simone Levant's lawsuit against
the NCAA drug-testing program may be ex
panded into a class-action suit on behalf of
all collegiate athletes in California, accord
ing to attorneys for the American Civil
Liberties Union (ACLU).
If successful, such a suit would exempt all
California athletes from the National Col
legiate Athletic Association's testing pro
gram and would effectively destroy it
nationwide, said attorney Susan Harriman,
one of two attorneys handling Levant's
case.
The amended suit would be identical to
LeVant's except that the plaintiffs would be
a handful of athletes representing all col
legiate athletes in California.
But finding those athletes may be diffi
cult, according to University Athletic Direc
tor Andy Geiger. Geiger, who dislikes only
some aspects of the NCAA test, said an ath
lete joining a suit might strain relations
with his or her coach and face disapproval
from teammates in favor of testing.
"I think that first of all. some athletes
may be in favor of testing," Geiger said.
"And I think that some athletes may not be
willing to speak out."
Harriman said she will decide "certainly
within two weeks and probably in one
week" whether to expand the suit, which
she believes is the only one in the nation

challenging the NCAA drug-testing pro
gram.
For strategic reasons, Harriman said she
would not comment on the factors that will
influence her decision.
But even if the attorneys decide against a
class action, she said, "It's fair to say — and
1 think I've told the NCAA this — there cer
tainly will be additional plaintiffs."
Under the NCAA program, all athletes are
required to sign a form agreeing to be tested
should they qualify for postseason competi
tion. If a player is tested prior to a post
season meet or game — and not all are — he
or she must provide a urine sample in the
presence of a monitor.
Geiger estimates that 50 to 60 Stanford
athletes have taken the test this year.
LeVant's suit, prepared by Harriman and
Bob Van Nest, attorneys in the San Fran
cisco law firm of Keker & Brockett, claims
the testing intrudes on LeVant's right to
privacy, which is guaranteed under the Cal
ifornia constitution. In addition, the suit
claims violations of rules governing search
and seizure and due process.
The suit, organized by the ACLU, has not
gone to trial, but a January temporary
restraining order and a March temporary
injunction allowed LeVant to complete the
diving season without signing a consent
form.
Stanford soccer player Jennifer Hill
joined the suit in March.
Although a class-action victory
in California's courts would not
affect the legality of the NCAA's
test elsewhere, Harriman believes
it would make the program un
workable.
"The effect is more practical
than anything else," Harriman
said. "If the NCAA cannot enforce
its program in California, you
would think they'd have to rethink
things. . . . There are big schools
here, big conferences. ... It
seems the whole program would
have to go."
Frank Uryasz, one of three
NCAA officials who administer the
testing program, agreed. "I think
it would be quite difficult to test in

some states and not all of them,"
he said. California, he said, hosts
a number of postseason cham
pionships and sends a lot of parti
cipants to such events elsewhere.
The suit was filed in California
Superior Court because Califor
nia's constitution explicitly
guarantees an individual's right
to privacy. In addition. Harriman
said, the California constitution
protects against intrusion by both
private and public entities. The
U.S. Constitution and most state
constitutions only protect an indi
vidual against the government,
she said.
The U.S. Supreme Court ruled
three years ago that the NCAA is
not a quasi-governmental body,
said Stanford political science lec
turer Jim Steyer, who is assisting
with the lawsuit.
Harriman said the case was
originally filed only on behalf of
LeVant because, "Simone needed

instant relief. We had to get into
court very quickly, and because of
that we didn't want to bring in any
issues that would delay us."
But, she added. "In lots of ways,
the case cries out for legal relief for
all athletes."
Harriman and company are now
working to assemble male and
female athletes from a variety of
sports to represent symbolically
collegiate athletes in California.
Although the search for plain
tiffs has not focused exclusively on
Stanford, "most of the interest
generated has been from Stan
ford." she said.
Harriman said prospective
plaintiffs should be juniors or
younger who are "very opposed" to
the drug-testing program, willing
to submit to an NCAA deposition
and willing to testify in court.
The only cost would be the ath
lete's time — the attorneys are
donating their time to the ACLU.

And the ACLU pays all incidental
expenses, such as court fees and
travel costs.
Some Stanford athletes who
may be taking the test in coming
weeks said last night that they
would not join in such a suit.
"I probably would not get in
volved in it." said Doug Robbins. a
catcher on the baseball team. "It's
not that big a moral standpoint
for me. I have nothing to hide, so
I'll just get [to the College World
Series) any way I can."
Robbins said some team mem
bers may be tested before the
NCAA regional tournament,
scheduled to begin May 22 at
Sunken Diamond.
"I don't know if the NCAA's in
tentions are good or if they're
trying to make the NCAA look per
fect," Robbins said.
And.he added, "I see no possi
ble way to keep (the results]
private. ... If the guy's not there.

and he's a starting player, that's
the first thing people are going to
assume."
Nonetheless. Robbins said the
tests help make competition fair,
especially in football, where
steroid use is prevalent.
"I think the testing itself is
good." said freshman tennis
player Jeff Tarango, who will take
the test next week. "It rids a lot of
things from athletes, and athletes
are models for kids," said
Tarango. who will play in the up
coming NCAA tennis champion
ships.
