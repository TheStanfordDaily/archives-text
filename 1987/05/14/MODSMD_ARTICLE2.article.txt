# ACLU may expand diver's NCAA suit
## 
### CLINT HIGHFILL Senior staff writer 
Diver Simone Levant's lawsuit against
the NCAA drug-testing program may be ex
panded into a class-action suit on behalf of
all collegiate athletes in California, accord
ing to attorneys for the American Civil
Liberties Union (ACLU).
If successful, such a suit would exempt all
California athletes from the National Col
legiate Athletic Association's testing pro
gram and would effectively destroy it
nationwide, said attorney Susan Harriman,
one of two attorneys handling Levant's
case.
The amended suit would be identical to
LeVant's except that the plaintiffs would be
a handful of athletes representing all col
legiate athletes in California.
But finding those athletes may be diffi
cult, according to University Athletic Direc
tor Andy Geiger. Geiger, who dislikes only
some aspects of the NCAA test, said an ath
lete joining a suit might strain relations
with his or her coach and face disapproval
from teammates in favor of testing.
"I think that first of all. some athletes
may be in favor of testing," Geiger said.
"And I think that some athletes may not be
willing to speak out."
Harriman said she will decide "certainly
within two weeks and probably in one
week" whether to expand the suit, which
she believes is the only one in the nation

challenging the NCAA drug-testing pro
gram.
For strategic reasons, Harriman said she
would not comment on the factors that will
influence her decision.
But even if the attorneys decide against a
class action, she said, "It's fair to say — and
1 think I've told the NCAA this — there cer
tainly will be additional plaintiffs."
Under the NCAA program, all athletes are
required to sign a form agreeing to be tested
should they qualify for postseason competi
tion. If a player is tested prior to a post
season meet or game — and not all are — he
or she must provide a urine sample in the
presence of a monitor.
Geiger estimates that 50 to 60 Stanford
athletes have taken the test this year.
LeVant's suit, prepared by Harriman and
Bob Van Nest, attorneys in the San Fran
cisco law firm of Keker & Brockett, claims
the testing intrudes on LeVant's right to
privacy, which is guaranteed under the Cal
ifornia constitution. In addition, the suit
claims violations of rules governing search
and seizure and due process.
The suit, organized by the ACLU, has not
gone to trial, but a January temporary
restraining order and a March temporary
injunction allowed LeVant to complete the
diving season without signing a consent
form.
