## Exhibits look back at University's youth 
### CHRIS MYERS Editorial staff 
In the 100 years since builders
laid the cornerstone for Stanford
University amid the dust and
horse manure of Leland Stan
ford's Palo Alto stock farm, the
school has grown remarkably on
several fronts. Two exhibits, on
display In the west wing of Green
Library, examine the parallel de
velopment of the student body and
campus that grew up around that
cornerstone. The exhibits are pre
sented by the Department of Spe
cial Collections and the University
Archives.
"Student Life at Stanford, 1891-
1906: The Pioneer Years," charts
the "coming together of an In
trinsically western university
community and the formation of a
creative student community," ac
cording to Archives Curator
Roxanne Nilan, who compiled the
exhibit along with Archives photo
specialist Margo Davis.
The second exhibit, "Stanford
University: Always in Style,"
demonstrates the way in which

the architecture of the Univer
sity's public buildings, beginning
with the prototype design of the
Quadrangle, diversified but
retained a basic theme, while the
design of private faculty resi
dences "repeatedly stepped
beyond the quadrangle design to
reveal personal and unique ar
chitectural statements," accord
ing to Robin Chandler, University
archivist and curator of the ex
hibit.
Nilan said she and Davis had no
trouble rounding up material for
the student life display.
"In some ways, we had such rich
resources it was difficult to select
and narrow It down." she said.
"We put [the exhibit] together and
then we had to be even more
selective."
Nilan said that the emphasis in
compiling the exhibit was on gat
hering Items that "have a touch of
humanity" and "emanate from the
individual."
A definite touch of humanity Is
provided by the many personal let
ters in the exhibit. Most of the let
ters are originals, written by stu

dents to a parents or friends.
Excerpts show that the more
student life has changed, the
more it has remained the same.
Frederick Perry. Class of 1902, in
a hastily scribbled postcrlpt to a
letter dated May 21, 1899, im
plored his mother with a refrain
probably familiar to every under
graduate, past and present:
"Tell Papa to mail me *5. . . . I
am in dire straits! If not given as
sistance at once I shall be under
the painful necessity of begging
for a 'hand-out' and tramping the
ties to 'Frisco. Money almost gone!
Send >5 at once!"
A year earlier, in May 1898,
Perry had written to his mother
describing the agonies of finals
week:
"Examination week is upon us!"
he wrote. "Tomorrow ushers in
the five-days plague in which
fears, and worrying, and nervous
exhaustion, and palpitations of
the heart will be the chief lot of
this College humanity.
" 'Exams,' or 'exes,' as we
lovingly call them, will sail
through the week like a pirate ves
sel, with a skull and cross-bones
at its mast and destruction at its
prow," he continued.
In addition to letters, Davis and
Nilan used photos, posters, hand
outs and class materials to paint a
picture of the special character of
student activity in the pioneer
years. Some of the traditions
started in those years have contin
ued to the present day; others died
long ago.
One ritual which is highlighted
by the exhibit, but which merci
fully faded out of existence, was
the "plug-ugly" tradition. Each
class traditionally wore a distinc
tive hat — the freshmen, for exam
ple, donned beanies, the juniors
"plugs" (which look like slightly
squashed top hats) and the
seniors sombreros. All the hats
were elaborately decorated, as Is
evident in another letter from
Perry to his mother, this one
dated October 8, 1898, in which
he writes, "You should see my
plug — verily, it is a thing of
beauty and joy forever."
As rivalry between classes
heated up, the juniors and seniors
began staging an annual "hat
smashing melee for control of the
Inner Quadrangle," according to
the exhibit. Called the "plug ugly,"
this eventually evolved Into little
more than a glorified brawl. The
juniors' plugs, coated with several
layers of lead paint, were danger
ous weapons, so that "heads as
well as hats were smashed," ac
cording to the text of the exhibit.
The plug ugly was finally outlawed
by University sanction in 1917.
Other traditions born during
the pioneer years lasted longer,
however. The exhibit traces the
origin and development of The
Daily, The Chaparral, Big Game
and numerous other present-day
traditions.

For Davis and Nllan, the re
search done for this exhibit will
also serve them for a bigger project
they are working on — a book
about the Stanford community
from 1891 to 1949.
The two authors are making a
conscious effort to avoid writing
"yet another history of Stanford,"
Davis said.
"What we want to focus on is
how people felt about this place —
what traditions there were, what
was passed on," Nilan said.
Ironically, both Davis and Nilan
are graduates of UC-Berkeley. No
problem, they say. "I don't think
anybody understands Stanford as
well as Berkeley, and vice versa,"
Nilan said.
While their book will cover ma
terial up to 1949, the exhibit stops
at 1906. The death of Jane Stan
ford and the earthquake in 1906
marked the end of an era for the
University, Nilan said. With the
last of "the old family" gone and
devastating damage done to the
campus by the earthquake, Uni
versity officials "really had to re
think wffaf They were doing,"
Nilan said. The earthquake ush
ered in an era of "economic, physi
cal, administrative and financial
changes," she said.
But even though Jane Stanford
had joined her husband in the
grave, the Stanfords left behind a
vision, not only for the life of the
school, but for its physical plan as
well.
The second exhibit at the Ar
chives shows how that original
physical plan — focused primarily
on the Quad — played itself out in
numerous other public buildings
and was departed from in the
building of private residences.

All of the buildings and homes
featured in the exhibit are still
standing. Appropriately enough,
the exhibit begins with the Quad,
which was, according to the text
of the exhibit, "the core of a grand
and monumental architectural
plan which envisioned a commu
nity of university buildings and
residences capable of straightfor
ward expansion and stylistic
unity."
The Quad was designed in a
style that combined Richard
sonian Romanesque
(characterized by semi-circular
arches and rock-faced masonry)
with California Mission (charac
terized by courtyards surrounded
by an arched corridor and red-tile
roof adobe buildings).
Landscape architect Frederick
Law Olmsted, who developed the
master plan for the University,
originally intended the present
Quad to be the first of an eventual
seven quadrangles, according to
Chandler.
The second quad was to be cen
tered around what is now the west
wing of Green Library. The first
part of that quad was the Thomas
Welton Stanford Art Gallery.
However, as funding fell short and
other projects took priority, the vi
sion of a second quad went by the
wayside, according to Chandler.
Meanwhile, the original Rich
ardsonian Romanesque/Mission
Revival style was echoed and
modified in new University build
ings.
In 1913, John Bakewell and Ar
thur Brown were hired to serve as
University architects. Their first
assignment was the new library,
in which they integrated the Rich

ardsonian Romanesque/Mission
Revival and the French Beaux
Arts-Classical formula. Bakewell
and Brown went on to serve the
University until 1941, designing
the main building of the Stanford
Union (now Old Union), completed
in 1922, Roble Gymnasium
(1931), Lagunita Court (1934),
Memorial Auditorium (1937), the
School of Education (1938) and fi
nally, Hoover Tower (1941). Their
modification and development of
the University's original style can
be seen in all of those buildings.
Much of the diversity in campus
architecture comes from the
private residences. One point of
the exhibit is to show that while
the Stanfords "planned the public
buildings, they didn't so much
think about the private build
ings," Chandler said.
As a result, there was "a chance
for real diversity to come from fac
ulty residences," according to
Chandler. "(Faculty members]
could build anything they could
afford," she said.
A few of the more lavish faculty
productions were the Griffln-Drell
House (at the corner of Campus
Drive and Alvarado Row), the
oldest residence on campus, built
around 1892; the Dunn-Bacon
House (at the corner of Campus
and Mayfield), built In 1899; the
Lou Henry Hoover House, com
pleted in 1920; and the Hanna-
Honeycomb House, originally de
signed by Frank Lloyd Wright in
1935 for Education Prof. Paul
Hanna and now the residence of
the University Provost.

play in the University Archives.

amples of the latter is a letter from
Wright to Hanna, with handwrit

the honeycomb pattern of the
house's foundation and express
ing the architect's hopes that the
design meets with Hanna's ap
proval.
"Stanford University: Always in

Bender Room in Green Library
through July. "Student Life at
Stanford, 1891-1906: The Pioneer

and well worth a visit for students
or any interested party.

In the 100 years since builders
laid the cornerstone for Stanford
University amid the dust and
horse manure of Leland Stan
ford's Palo Alto stock farm, the
school has grown remarkably on
several fronts. Two exhibits, on
display In the west wing of Green
Library, examine the parallel de
velopment of the student body and
campus that grew up around that
cornerstone. The exhibits are pre
sented by the Department of Spe
cial Collections and the University
Archives.
"Student Life at Stanford, 1891-
1906: The Pioneer Years," charts
the "coming together of an In
trinsically western university
community and the formation of a
creative student community," ac
cording to Archives Curator
Roxanne Nilan, who compiled the
exhibit along with Archives photo
specialist Margo Davis.
The second exhibit, "Stanford
University: Always in Style,"
demonstrates the way in which

the architecture of the Univer
sity's public buildings, beginning
with the prototype design of the
Quadrangle, diversified but
retained a basic theme, while the
design of private faculty resi
dences "repeatedly stepped
beyond the quadrangle design to
reveal personal and unique ar
chitectural statements," accord
ing to Robin Chandler, University
archivist and curator of the ex
hibit.
Nilan said she and Davis had no
trouble rounding up material for
the student life display.
"In some ways, we had such rich
resources it was difficult to select
and narrow It down." she said.
"We put [the exhibit] together and
then we had to be even more
selective."
Nilan said that the emphasis in
compiling the exhibit was on gat
hering Items that "have a touch of
humanity" and "emanate from the
individual."
A definite touch of humanity Is
provided by the many personal let
ters in the exhibit. Most of the let
ters are originals, written by stu

dents to a parents or friends.
Excerpts show that the more
student life has changed, the
more it has remained the same.
Frederick Perry. Class of 1902, in
a hastily scribbled postcrlpt to a
letter dated May 21, 1899, im
plored his mother with a refrain
probably familiar to every under
graduate, past and present:
"Tell Papa to mail me *5. . . . I
am in dire straits! If not given as
sistance at once I shall be under
the painful necessity of begging
for a 'hand-out' and tramping the
ties to 'Frisco. Money almost gone!
Send >5 at once!"
A year earlier, in May 1898,
Perry had written to his mother
describing the agonies of finals
week:
"Examination week is upon us!"
he wrote. "Tomorrow ushers in
the five-days plague in which
fears, and worrying, and nervous
exhaustion, and palpitations of
the heart will be the chief lot of
this College humanity.
" 'Exams,' or 'exes,' as we
lovingly call them, will sail
through the week like a pirate ves
sel, with a skull and cross-bones
at its mast and destruction at its
prow," he continued.
In addition to letters, Davis and
Nilan used photos, posters, hand
outs and class materials to paint a
picture of the special character of
student activity in the pioneer
years. Some of the traditions
started in those years have contin
ued to the present day; others died
long ago.
One ritual which is highlighted
by the exhibit, but which merci
fully faded out of existence, was
the "plug-ugly" tradition. Each
class traditionally wore a distinc
tive hat — the freshmen, for exam
ple, donned beanies, the juniors
"plugs" (which look like slightly
squashed top hats) and the
seniors sombreros. All the hats
were elaborately decorated, as Is
evident in another letter from
Perry to his mother, this one
dated October 8, 1898, in which
he writes, "You should see my
plug — verily, it is a thing of
beauty and joy forever."
As rivalry between classes
heated up, the juniors and seniors
began staging an annual "hat
smashing melee for control of the
Inner Quadrangle," according to
the exhibit. Called the "plug ugly,"
this eventually evolved Into little
more than a glorified brawl. The
juniors' plugs, coated with several
layers of lead paint, were danger
ous weapons, so that "heads as
well as hats were smashed," ac
cording to the text of the exhibit.
The plug ugly was finally outlawed
by University sanction in 1917.
Other traditions born during
the pioneer years lasted longer,
however. The exhibit traces the
origin and development of The
Daily, The Chaparral, Big Game
and numerous other present-day
traditions.

For Davis and Nllan, the re
search done for this exhibit will
also serve them for a bigger project
they are working on — a book
about the Stanford community
from 1891 to 1949.
The two authors are making a
conscious effort to avoid writing
"yet another history of Stanford,"
Davis said.
"What we want to focus on is
how people felt about this place —
what traditions there were, what
was passed on," Nilan said.
Ironically, both Davis and Nilan
are graduates of UC-Berkeley. No
problem, they say. "I don't think
anybody understands Stanford as
well as Berkeley, and vice versa,"
Nilan said.
While their book will cover ma
terial up to 1949, the exhibit stops
at 1906. The death of Jane Stan
ford and the earthquake in 1906
marked the end of an era for the
University, Nilan said. With the
last of "the old family" gone and
devastating damage done to the
campus by the earthquake, Uni
versity officials "really had to re
think wffaf They were doing,"
Nilan said. The earthquake ush
ered in an era of "economic, physi
cal, administrative and financial
changes," she said.
But even though Jane Stanford
had joined her husband in the
grave, the Stanfords left behind a
vision, not only for the life of the
school, but for its physical plan as
well.
The second exhibit at the Ar
chives shows how that original
physical plan — focused primarily
on the Quad — played itself out in
numerous other public buildings
and was departed from in the
building of private residences.

All of the buildings and homes
featured in the exhibit are still
standing. Appropriately enough,
the exhibit begins with the Quad,
which was, according to the text
of the exhibit, "the core of a grand
and monumental architectural
plan which envisioned a commu
nity of university buildings and
residences capable of straightfor
ward expansion and stylistic
unity."
The Quad was designed in a
style that combined Richard
sonian Romanesque
(characterized by semi-circular
arches and rock-faced masonry)
with California Mission (charac
terized by courtyards surrounded
by an arched corridor and red-tile
roof adobe buildings).
Landscape architect Frederick
Law Olmsted, who developed the
master plan for the University,
originally intended the present
Quad to be the first of an eventual
seven quadrangles, according to
Chandler.
The second quad was to be cen
tered around what is now the west
wing of Green Library. The first
part of that quad was the Thomas
Welton Stanford Art Gallery.
However, as funding fell short and
other projects took priority, the vi
sion of a second quad went by the
wayside, according to Chandler.
Meanwhile, the original Rich
ardsonian Romanesque/Mission
Revival style was echoed and
modified in new University build
ings.
In 1913, John Bakewell and Ar
thur Brown were hired to serve as
University architects. Their first
assignment was the new library,
in which they integrated the Rich

ardsonian Romanesque/Mission
Revival and the French Beaux
Arts-Classical formula. Bakewell
and Brown went on to serve the
University until 1941, designing
the main building of the Stanford
Union (now Old Union), completed
in 1922, Roble Gymnasium
(1931), Lagunita Court (1934),
Memorial Auditorium (1937), the
School of Education (1938) and fi
nally, Hoover Tower (1941). Their
modification and development of
the University's original style can
be seen in all of those buildings.
Much of the diversity in campus
architecture comes from the
private residences. One point of
the exhibit is to show that while
the Stanfords "planned the public
buildings, they didn't so much
think about the private build
ings," Chandler said.
As a result, there was "a chance
for real diversity to come from fac
ulty residences," according to
Chandler. "(Faculty members]
could build anything they could
afford," she said.
A few of the more lavish faculty
productions were the Griffln-Drell
House (at the corner of Campus
Drive and Alvarado Row), the
oldest residence on campus, built
around 1892; the Dunn-Bacon
House (at the corner of Campus
and Mayfield), built In 1899; the
Lou Henry Hoover House, com
pleted in 1920; and the Hanna-
Honeycomb House, originally de
signed by Frank Lloyd Wright in
1935 for Education Prof. Paul
Hanna and now the residence of
the University Provost.

In the 100 years since builders
laid the cornerstone for Stanford
University amid the dust and
horse manure of Leland Stan
ford's Palo Alto stock farm, the
school has grown remarkably on
several fronts. Two exhibits, on
display In the west wing of Green
Library, examine the parallel de
velopment of the student body and
campus that grew up around that
cornerstone. The exhibits are pre
sented by the Department of Spe
cial Collections and the University
Archives.
"Student Life at Stanford, 1891-
1906: The Pioneer Years," charts
the "coming together of an In
trinsically western university
community and the formation of a
creative student community," ac
cording to Archives Curator
Roxanne Nilan, who compiled the
exhibit along with Archives photo
specialist Margo Davis.
The second exhibit, "Stanford
University: Always in Style,"
demonstrates the way in which

the architecture of the Univer
sity's public buildings, beginning
with the prototype design of the
Quadrangle, diversified but
retained a basic theme, while the
design of private faculty resi
dences "repeatedly stepped
beyond the quadrangle design to
reveal personal and unique ar
chitectural statements," accord
ing to Robin Chandler, University
archivist and curator of the ex
hibit.
Nilan said she and Davis had no
trouble rounding up material for
the student life display.
"In some ways, we had such rich
resources it was difficult to select
and narrow It down." she said.
"We put [the exhibit] together and
then we had to be even more
selective."
Nilan said that the emphasis in
compiling the exhibit was on gat
hering Items that "have a touch of
humanity" and "emanate from the
individual."
A definite touch of humanity Is
provided by the many personal let
ters in the exhibit. Most of the let
ters are originals, written by stu

dents to a parents or friends.
Excerpts show that the more
student life has changed, the
more it has remained the same.
Frederick Perry. Class of 1902, in
a hastily scribbled postcrlpt to a
letter dated May 21, 1899, im
plored his mother with a refrain
probably familiar to every under
graduate, past and present:
"Tell Papa to mail me *5. . . . I
am in dire straits! If not given as
sistance at once I shall be under
the painful necessity of begging
for a 'hand-out' and tramping the
ties to 'Frisco. Money almost gone!
Send >5 at once!"
A year earlier, in May 1898,
Perry had written to his mother
describing the agonies of finals
week:
"Examination week is upon us!"
he wrote. "Tomorrow ushers in
the five-days plague in which
fears, and worrying, and nervous
exhaustion, and palpitations of
the heart will be the chief lot of
this College humanity.
" 'Exams,' or 'exes,' as we
lovingly call them, will sail
through the week like a pirate ves
sel, with a skull and cross-bones
at its mast and destruction at its
prow," he continued.
In addition to letters, Davis and
Nilan used photos, posters, hand
outs and class materials to paint a
picture of the special character of
student activity in the pioneer
years. Some of the traditions
started in those years have contin
ued to the present day; others died
long ago.
One ritual which is highlighted
by the exhibit, but which merci
fully faded out of existence, was
the "plug-ugly" tradition. Each
class traditionally wore a distinc
tive hat — the freshmen, for exam
ple, donned beanies, the juniors
"plugs" (which look like slightly
squashed top hats) and the
seniors sombreros. All the hats
were elaborately decorated, as Is
evident in another letter from
Perry to his mother, this one
dated October 8, 1898, in which
he writes, "You should see my
plug — verily, it is a thing of
beauty and joy forever."
As rivalry between classes
heated up, the juniors and seniors
began staging an annual "hat
smashing melee for control of the
Inner Quadrangle," according to
the exhibit. Called the "plug ugly,"
this eventually evolved Into little
more than a glorified brawl. The
juniors' plugs, coated with several
layers of lead paint, were danger
ous weapons, so that "heads as
well as hats were smashed," ac
cording to the text of the exhibit.
The plug ugly was finally outlawed
by University sanction in 1917.
Other traditions born during
the pioneer years lasted longer,
however. The exhibit traces the
origin and development of The
Daily, The Chaparral, Big Game
and numerous other present-day
traditions.

For Davis and Nllan, the re
search done for this exhibit will
also serve them for a bigger project
they are working on — a book
about the Stanford community
from 1891 to 1949.
The two authors are making a
conscious effort to avoid writing
"yet another history of Stanford,"
Davis said.
"What we want to focus on is
how people felt about this place —
what traditions there were, what
was passed on," Nilan said.
Ironically, both Davis and Nilan
are graduates of UC-Berkeley. No
problem, they say. "I don't think
anybody understands Stanford as
well as Berkeley, and vice versa,"
Nilan said.
While their book will cover ma
terial up to 1949, the exhibit stops
at 1906. The death of Jane Stan
ford and the earthquake in 1906
marked the end of an era for the
University, Nilan said. With the
last of "the old family" gone and
devastating damage done to the
campus by the earthquake, Uni
versity officials "really had to re
think wffaf They were doing,"
Nilan said. The earthquake ush
ered in an era of "economic, physi
cal, administrative and financial
changes," she said.
But even though Jane Stanford
had joined her husband in the
grave, the Stanfords left behind a
vision, not only for the life of the
school, but for its physical plan as
well.
The second exhibit at the Ar
chives shows how that original
physical plan — focused primarily
on the Quad — played itself out in
numerous other public buildings
and was departed from in the
building of private residences.

All of the buildings and homes
featured in the exhibit are still
standing. Appropriately enough,
the exhibit begins with the Quad,
which was, according to the text
of the exhibit, "the core of a grand
and monumental architectural
plan which envisioned a commu
nity of university buildings and
residences capable of straightfor
ward expansion and stylistic
unity."
The Quad was designed in a
style that combined Richard
sonian Romanesque
(characterized by semi-circular
arches and rock-faced masonry)
with California Mission (charac
terized by courtyards surrounded
by an arched corridor and red-tile
roof adobe buildings).
Landscape architect Frederick
Law Olmsted, who developed the
master plan for the University,
originally intended the present
Quad to be the first of an eventual
seven quadrangles, according to
Chandler.
The second quad was to be cen
tered around what is now the west
wing of Green Library. The first
part of that quad was the Thomas
Welton Stanford Art Gallery.
However, as funding fell short and
other projects took priority, the vi
sion of a second quad went by the
wayside, according to Chandler.
Meanwhile, the original Rich
ardsonian Romanesque/Mission
Revival style was echoed and
modified in new University build
ings.
In 1913, John Bakewell and Ar
thur Brown were hired to serve as
University architects. Their first
assignment was the new library,
in which they integrated the Rich

ardsonian Romanesque/Mission
Revival and the French Beaux
Arts-Classical formula. Bakewell
and Brown went on to serve the
University until 1941, designing
the main building of the Stanford
Union (now Old Union), completed
in 1922, Roble Gymnasium
(1931), Lagunita Court (1934),
Memorial Auditorium (1937), the
School of Education (1938) and fi
nally, Hoover Tower (1941). Their
modification and development of
the University's original style can
be seen in all of those buildings.
Much of the diversity in campus
architecture comes from the
private residences. One point of
the exhibit is to show that while
the Stanfords "planned the public
buildings, they didn't so much
think about the private build
ings," Chandler said.
As a result, there was "a chance
for real diversity to come from fac
ulty residences," according to
Chandler. "(Faculty members]
could build anything they could
afford," she said.
A few of the more lavish faculty
productions were the Griffln-Drell
House (at the corner of Campus
Drive and Alvarado Row), the
oldest residence on campus, built
around 1892; the Dunn-Bacon
House (at the corner of Campus
and Mayfield), built In 1899; the
Lou Henry Hoover House, com
pleted in 1920; and the Hanna-
Honeycomb House, originally de
signed by Frank Lloyd Wright in
1935 for Education Prof. Paul
Hanna and now the residence of
the University Provost.
