Spring is in the air. A time for
volleyball, windsurfing, sunbath
li.g and. of course, spring musi
c Is. This quarter, several dorm
itory-sponsored musicals will pro-
Vide wonderful entertainment on
these warm weekend nights.
Trancos House in Wilbur Hall
u ill be presenting "The Wedding"
May 15 and 16.
"(This play] is an early, obscure
Â» iie-act written by Bertolt Brecht.
v. no is probably the best-known
'.'Oth-century German 'play
wright." said Martha Feldman,
iiancos resident fellow.
"The play is an expresslonistic
comedy of errors in one act," ex
plained Feldman, is the play's ex
ecutive producer. "Everything
that is supposed to happen one
v ay happens the other way. The
\ hole joyous atmosphere of a wed
ding banquet gets turned upside
clown."
The idea for the show grew out
< 112 a weekly play-reading group
which Feldman held at Trancos.
"The second week (of this quar
ter), the group read Wedding'

and something clicked," Feldman
said. "We knew that that was the
play we wanted to put on."
Feldman was very happy to be
able to get Suites RF Jim Cadena
to direct the show.
"He (Cadena) has a real vision
and he's tremendously experi
enced," she said. "He did a lot of
acting exercises with the actors
before even reading and blocking
the play and things went really
well."
Feldman was pleasantly sur
prised by the high caliber of acting
in the play.
"It's on a very high level of acting
for students in one dorm," she
said. "There is a tremendous
amount of talent and experience
in serious acting, which is really
unusual for a freshman dorm."
The costumes and the set will
also be excellent, according to
Feldman. The 19305-style cos
tumes are being borrowed from
the Drama Department and they
were the same ones used in a Uni
versity production of Brecht's
"Three Penny Opera."
Also this weekend. Twain House
in Stern Hall will be presenting
the musical "Li'l Abner."

'"Li'l Abner' Is a fun, light
hearted musical about hillbillies
living in the most unnecessary
little town in the United States,"
explained sophomore Russell Phil
lips, the musical's producer. "It is
based on the comic' strip and the
characters created by A 1 Capp."
In the story, the government
wants to do nuclear testing in this
"unnecessary" town and the
people do everything that they can
to save their home, according to

Phillips.
"The musical has good guys vs.
bad guys, romance, you name it,"
Phillips said. "It's got everything."
Phillips was very happy with the
cast, which includes sophomores
Julie Padilla as Daisy May and
Tom Geiger as Li'l Abner.
"We have a lot of talented people
and they're working hard," he
said. "We expect a really good
show.
"It will be a good show to go to

and just relax and have a good
time." Phillips added.
On May 21 to 24, Governor's
Corner and the Row will Jointly
sponsor a production of the musi
cal "Hair." The production will be
based on the original Broadway
musical script with the lyrics by
Gerome Ragni and James Rado
and the music by Gait MacDer
mot.
"The musical is about a young
man named Claude and his
friends," said senior Mitch
Rudominer, who is directing the
musical. "We meet them and learn
about their lives. As the musical
progresses, we become attached to
them and find out about certain
love triangles and things that af
fect them.
"Then, at the end of the musi
cal, Claude is drafted at serve in
the Vietnam War and he has to
leave his friends, who don't know
if they'll ever see him again," he
said.
"I'm extremely happy with the
cast and the staff," he said.
The musical includes many
popularly known songs such as
"Aquarius," "Good Morning Star
shine" and "Let the Sun Shine

In." Rudomlner said that he was
very pleased with the music as
well as the choreography.
Lagunlta Court will present
"Two Gentlemen of Verona." a mu
sical. May 25 to 27.
"The production is based upon
the Shakespearean comedy of the
same name, but it is a modernized
version with music added," said
senior Emily Breuner. who is the
producer.
"At the beginning of the musi
cal. a guy goes from Sicily to
Verona and falls in love with a new
woman giving up his old Sicilian
girlfriend," Breuner explained.
"Unfortunately, his Sicilian
girlfriend comes to Verona
dressed as a man to find him.
"There is a lot of irony in the
musical, and the plot is a little bit
complex." she added.
"The comedy has a multiracial
cast, and it features all different
kinds of music," Breuner said.
"That is how it has been
modernized."
Sophomore Allen Blue, who also
directed this year's Gaieties, will
direct the musical. West Lagunlta
