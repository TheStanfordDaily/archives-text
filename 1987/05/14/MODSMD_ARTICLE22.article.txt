## 'Ishtar': Is it the year's worst film? 
### JAMES LUJAN Editorial staff 
Anybody could've seen it com
ing. Anybody familiar with the en
tertainment industry — and even
those who are not — could have
seen that trouble was brewing In
the horizon for "Ishtar." The first
sign of trouble was the fact that
the distressed Columbia Pictures.

undergoing changes in manage
ment. was seemingly oblivious to
the millions of dollars that were
being poured into the project,
which eventually bloated the
budget to an excess of *40 million.
The next sign of trouble for the
Warren Beatty/Dustln Hoffman ef
fort was evident when the coming
attractions trailer of the comedy
first appeared in the summer of

1986 — it simply wasn't funny.
Subsequently. Columbia Pictures
pushed back the projected
Thanksgiving-Christmas release
date so that writer-director Elaine
May could go back and make some
more cuts in the picture. It doesn't
take a genius to guess that any
picture sent back into the editing
room probably wasn't that good in
the first place.
At any rate, any sane, rational
person would probably be immedi
ately inclined to bet the farm on a
picture starring Warren Beatty
and Dustin Hoffman, which is
what Columbia Pictures did for
♦40 million, but sadly. "Ishtar"
turns out ot be a minor comedy,
but an epic creative and financial
disaster of "Heaven's Gate" pro
portions.
"Ishtar" was conceived as a trib
ute to the old Hope and Crosby
road pictures in which Bob Hope
and Bing Crosby would always
end up in some far-away country
getting involved with foreign in
trigue and trying to get Involved
with Dorothy Lamour. The appeal
of those early movies was due not
so much to any good acting or in
teresting plots — there wasn't any
— but more to the wit. charm and
the genuine chemistry of Hope
and Crosby. Unfortunately, all
these elements are lacking in
"Ishtar" and the result is depress
ingly bad.
Beatty and Hoffman play Lyle
Rogers and Chuck Clarke, two
bumbling, incompetent singer
songwriters who are so bad that
the only places they can get
bookings for their act are in Hon
duras and Marrakech. The two opt
for Marrakech because Honduras
is "too dangerous." En route, at a
Middle Eastern airport, Chuck
meets Shirra (Isabelle Adjani in
the Dorothy Lamour role), a beau
tiful revolutionary who gets the
duo caught in the middle of politi
cal upheaval in a small country
called Ishtar. Soon, Lyle and
Chuck find themselves chased by
terrorists and CIA agents only to
end up on a journey through the
desert with a blind camel.
The more I think about this
movie, the more I can't believe
how bad it was. It was almost as if
the entire experience wasn't real.
Could this really be Warren Beatty
and my favorite actor, Dustin
Hoffman, actually on screen?
What the hell are stars the caliber
of Beatty and Hoffman doing in

crap like this? Warren Beatty, the
man who brought us and per
formed in "Bonnie and Clyde,"
"Heaven Can Wait" and "Reds,"
and Dustin Hoffman, the man
who was so good In"The
Graduate," "Kramer vs. Kramer"
and "Tootsie" — both of them
haven't appeared in a movie in
about five years and it boggles the
mind to try to figure out why they
would choose this to be their first
movie in so long and their first
movie together. Actually, the an
swer to this question is probably
Elaine May.
May helped write the script for
Warren Beatty's "Heaven Can
Walt" and she was the one who
put the finishing touches on Dus
tin Hoffman's "Tootsie." You can
probably see the connection. Her
only previous directorial credits
are "The Heartbreak Kid" and
"Mikey and Nicky," and her inex
perience shows. "Ishtar" is a com
plete mess. The chase scenes are
clumsily executed and, worse, the
comic scenes, what little there are,
are forced and 111-timed.

As bad as her direction is, her
script is even worse, mainly be
cause it isn't funny. The Hope and
Crosby movies relied heavily on
their mile-a-minute one-liners
and humorous banter. Here, the
emphasis is heavily on the badly
staged slapstick and the rotten
songs that Lyle and Chuck write.
It was the intention of Elaine May
and songwriter Paul Williams to
write songs that are so bad they're
good, and while some of the songs
are funny, most of them are so bad
that they are bad.
As hard as it was trying to figure
out why this movie was made it
was even harder to figure out what
it was supposed to be about. It
wasn't clear if Beatty and Hoffman
were making fun of the people
that they were supposed to be
playing or if they were trying to
capture the style of Hope and
Crosby, which they don't do. Hope
and Crosby always played every
thing for laughs. They never
played characters, they always
played themselves. Beatty and

Hoffman are too accomplished to
be taken seriously — or in this
case, humorously — as bumbling
incompetents. They take their
roles too seriously and therefore
lack the tongue-in-cheek ap
proach and wink-at-the-camera
style necessary to make this ma
terial work. As a result, you don't
believe them in their roles for a
second and the overall effect is un
pleasant and embarrassing. For
instance, it's truly pathetic to see
an actor of Beatty's stature rolling
around on the floor with a woman
thinly disguised as a boy, cupping
his hands around her chest and
naively asking, "Are these
breasts?"
God, I still can't get over how
bad this movie was. I really
wanted to like this movie. I really
did, but I just couldn't. It would be
impossible to like this movie.
Suffice to say, because "Ishtar"
fails to live up to the immense tal
ent and expense invested in it, it
is, by far, the worst movie I've seen
all year.

Isabelle Adjani despairs at the thought of being in "Ishtar." In the film
she plays a revolutionary who crosses paths with the duo of Warren
Beatty and Dustin Hoffman.
