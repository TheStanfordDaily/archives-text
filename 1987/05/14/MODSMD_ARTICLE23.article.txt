# A 						very bizarre 'Gothic'
## 
### JENNIFER REESE 
Lord Byron uncovers a platter of rice swarming
with leeches, and the hideous Dr. Polidori smirks
at his "prank." Percy Shelley runs naked on the
villa roof in a rainstorm, trying to make himself
into a human lightning rod. Later he confronts
his deepest fear: Nipples that are. in fact. eyes.
Byron's mistress crawls naked through the cellar,
smeared with mud. carrying a dead rat in her
mouth. What does it mean? It's hard to know. Ken
Russell's new movie "Gothic" is incoherent and of
ten absurd, but certainly fun to watch, if nothing
else.
The movie is about the night (June 16, 1816)
when Lord Byron, Percy and Mary Shelley, and
two other high-strung individuals got together in
Byron's villa, told each other ghost stories and
supposedly held a seance in which each person
brought out his or her worst fear. They got very
worked up. and it was from this eerie night that
Mary Shelley came up with the idea for her novel
"Frankenstein." This background is about all
that's clear in this movie. Everything else is
bizarre — often terrific — but very confusing.
The Shelleys and Byron's creepy mistress arrive
at the villa in the afternoon, dine with Byron and
his friend Dr. Polidori. and all start running
around in the enormous villa, stopping at inter
vals to have passionate conversations, make love,
and confront rats, ghouls and their fears. They
are extraordinarily odd people. Byron is cruel and
debauched: he has bloody sexual fantasies, and
makes love to a servant woman who wears a clay
mask of his sister s face. His mistress is a freaked
out epileptic.
Dr. Polidori. a repressed and masochistic
homosexual, gets off on drinking the liquid from
his bottle of leeches and then rhythmically jam
ming his hand on the nail from which he hangs
his crucifix. Outside there is a storm, and a
strange, viscous liquid forms puddles in the villa.
None of this makes much sense. Everything

happens quickly and casually. But it is bizarre
enough to keep you watching. The characters ex
plore their worst fears, and the movie loses its
logical progression completely. It takes on the
style of a dream, of the imagination; things come
from nowhere, have no explanation. Unfortun
ately this is just confusing, not exciting or inter
esting. It is the movie's largest flaw that it doesn't
catch the audience up in its dream-logic. Instead,
it alienates and baffles them.
The performances are exceptional. Natasha
Richardson is bland but attractive as the com
paratively sane Mary. Without her to keep it some
what down to earth, the movie would be com
pletely crazy. Julian Sands is a laughably feverish
Shelley, and Gabriel Byrne is a cool, demonic
Byron. As the fat monstrous and androgynous Dr.
Polidori, Timothy Spall is appropriately revolting.
The actors seem to have fun with the material.
They carry the movie.
"Gothic" is neither creepshow nor comedy nor
serious drama, though it has elements of all. It is
energetic, fun and grotesque, but ultimately fails
to satisfy. It would be a good parody, but it isn't
consistent or coherent enough. It is weird. Just
when you adjust to a scene's mood, it abruptly
shifts. This is interesting at first, but eventually it
becomes disorienting. There's no way to hook into
this movie; eventually I found myself watching it
curiously, alertly, but with absolutely no involve
ment.
What happened? What did the movie mean?
There are far too many unanswered questions. In
fact, the whole movie is one big unanswered ques
tion. The scenes are quirky, and fantastically
gross, but there is no thread binding them to
gether. The film does a good job of mimicking the
irrationality of an overheated imagination, but it
needs something to make It all matter more.
Everything begins to seem irrelevant and
ridiculous. There's a lot to be said for this movie,
but Its lack of an overall coherence makes it ulti
mately incomprehensible and forgettable.
