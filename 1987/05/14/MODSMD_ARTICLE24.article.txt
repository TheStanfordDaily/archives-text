"Late Night with David Letter
man" has hit the big time. The
show dominates the competition,
charms the critics, impresses the
advertisers (commercial slots are
booked months in advance) and,
of course, cultivates a respectably
large and loyal audience. For those
who have never watched the pro
gram much, or never at all, this
week would be an opportune time
to tune in and observe. For only
the third time since the show
began five years ago. the show will
not be broadcast from the New
York studio. This time it will come
live from Las Vegas.
This would seem to be an appro
priate site for Dave's coronation
into television stardom, after
having risen from the ashes of a
disastrous morning program to
the pinnacle of his current show
in only a seven-year span. Las
Vegas, however, is the epitome of
the sleazy, bombastic entertain
ment "Late Night" has both
parodied and rebelled against; it is
home to the pompous, egotistical,
phony buffoons who have been
unmercifully skewered on Dave's
show. "Late Night" should have a
field day. more of a royal hunt
than a coronation.
Much of the success of "Late
Night" derives from its adven
turous anything-goes style. The
material is unusual and eccentric.
Whether racing dog sleds down
the NBC corridors or attempting
to bribe Mayor Tom Bradley in or
der to "fix" some Los Angeles
parking tickets, both the gags
themselves and their results are
often original and unexpected.
This wild quality differentiates
"Late Night" from the multitude of
other talk shows, particularly the
calcified "Tonight Show" with
Johnny Carson.
The other factor that particu
larly enhances the cult-like
popularity of "Late Night" is the
familiarity the viewer gains with
the show. The prominence of the
show's crew and a few feature
players (like Larry "Bud" Mellman
and Chris Elliot) in skits and gags
gives the program a soap opera
quality. The use of standard gags
and lines develops a comedic
tradition.
The result of these two aspects
is to obscure much of the humor
to the uninitiated viewer; the
more one watches, the more one

understands. Nearly everything is
an "in" joke. A "Late Night" guide
may be appropriate at this time.
□ Camera — Technical innovat
ions have always been a major
aspect of the show's originality.
One episode featured the full slow
rotation of the picture on the TV
screen during the program. An
other was dubbed with the voices

of different actors. Each show,
however, features some standard
camera gimmick. Beginning with
the simple overhead "Late Night
Sky-Cam," the show progressed to
the moving "Late Night Sky-Cam
Plus" and finally now to the "Late
Night Thrill-Cam" which moves
its way over the audience, bounc
ing and jiggling to the accompani
ment of screaming voices. Other
camera stunts include attaching a
camera to various moving objects,
a la "Monkey-Cam I," "Monkey-
Cam II," "Cow-Cam." and "Guest-
Cam," worn by Tom Hanks.
□ Elliot, Chris — Once Larry
"Bud" Mellman (see Mellman,
Larry "Bud") reigned supreme as
the "Late Night" featured player.
His replacement. Chris Elliot, is

far more interesting. The charac
ter Elliot plays is mean-spirited,
shallow, vindictive, two-faced and
arrogant. Envious of David Letter
man's success, he suffers from the
delusion that Dave has both pan
dered to the NBC executives and
has conspired to limit Elliot's
amount of TV exposure. This far
out characterization is played by
Elliot to sneering and malevolent
perfection.
During his years on "Late
Night," Elliot's character has
developed both a personality and a
media history. Starting as the
Nervous Guy who would race
screaming from the audience at
the first sign of danger, he then
moved on to a segment called "The
Guy Under the Seats" where he
would emerge from a trap door in
the audience, claiming to be
"Zodar, king of the Mole People,"
or the captain of a German U-boat
run aground, inevitably venting
his violent rage at Letterman.
He then won a "series" of his
own, a '70s detective spoof called
"The Fugitive Guy," where he
played a man on the run, featur
ing such episodes as "Hold Me,
Kiss Me, Kill Me." This is where
the character leapt into the truly
bizarre, getting involved with "the
wrong crowd," forgetting lines,
threatening Dave and eventually
losing the "series" after a drunken
brawl with former NBC president
Grant Tinker. He has since
returned with such "series" as
"The Terminator Guy" (half Dr.
Strangelove, half Equalizer),
"Action Family" and "Night Time"
(a talk show).
□ Feuds — Bolstering Dave's im
age of meanness is the vindictive
ness of his feuds. By far, the
longest-lasting has been the tiff
with Joan Collins, despite the fact
that Dave recently admitted to Eva
Gabor that he had forgotten the
initial reason. (Collins had
promised to appear but then
backed down at the last minute.)
These feuds do not last forever;
Connie Chung atoned for her sin
of repossessing a Christmas fruit
basket she had accidentally sent
to "Late Night" by appearing on
the show to crack walnuts with
her bare hands.
Similarly, the once-serious feud
with Bryant Gumbel (Dave had in
terrupted an outdoor "Today"
show Interview by shouting from a
