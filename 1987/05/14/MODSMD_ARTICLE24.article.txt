# A 						guide to 'David Letterman'
## 
### JAMES KOSIC 
"Late Night with David Letter
man" has hit the big time. The
show dominates the competition,
charms the critics, impresses the
advertisers (commercial slots are
booked months in advance) and,
of course, cultivates a respectably
large and loyal audience. For those
who have never watched the pro
gram much, or never at all, this
week would be an opportune time
to tune in and observe. For only
the third time since the show
began five years ago. the show will
not be broadcast from the New
York studio. This time it will come
live from Las Vegas.
This would seem to be an appro
priate site for Dave's coronation
into television stardom, after
having risen from the ashes of a
disastrous morning program to
the pinnacle of his current show
in only a seven-year span. Las
Vegas, however, is the epitome of
the sleazy, bombastic entertain
ment "Late Night" has both
parodied and rebelled against; it is
home to the pompous, egotistical,
phony buffoons who have been
unmercifully skewered on Dave's
show. "Late Night" should have a
field day. more of a royal hunt
than a coronation.
Much of the success of "Late
Night" derives from its adven
turous anything-goes style. The
material is unusual and eccentric.
Whether racing dog sleds down
the NBC corridors or attempting
to bribe Mayor Tom Bradley in or
der to "fix" some Los Angeles
parking tickets, both the gags
themselves and their results are
often original and unexpected.
This wild quality differentiates
"Late Night" from the multitude of
other talk shows, particularly the
calcified "Tonight Show" with
Johnny Carson.
The other factor that particu
larly enhances the cult-like
popularity of "Late Night" is the
familiarity the viewer gains with
the show. The prominence of the
show's crew and a few feature
players (like Larry "Bud" Mellman
and Chris Elliot) in skits and gags
gives the program a soap opera
quality. The use of standard gags
and lines develops a comedic
tradition.
The result of these two aspects
is to obscure much of the humor
to the uninitiated viewer; the
more one watches, the more one

understands. Nearly everything is
an "in" joke. A "Late Night" guide
may be appropriate at this time.
□ Camera — Technical innovat
ions have always been a major
aspect of the show's originality.
One episode featured the full slow
rotation of the picture on the TV
screen during the program. An
other was dubbed with the voices

of different actors. Each show,
however, features some standard
camera gimmick. Beginning with
the simple overhead "Late Night
Sky-Cam," the show progressed to
the moving "Late Night Sky-Cam
Plus" and finally now to the "Late
Night Thrill-Cam" which moves
its way over the audience, bounc
ing and jiggling to the accompani
ment of screaming voices. Other
camera stunts include attaching a
camera to various moving objects,
a la "Monkey-Cam I," "Monkey-
Cam II," "Cow-Cam." and "Guest-
Cam," worn by Tom Hanks.
□ Elliot, Chris — Once Larry
"Bud" Mellman (see Mellman,
Larry "Bud") reigned supreme as
the "Late Night" featured player.
His replacement. Chris Elliot, is

far more interesting. The charac
ter Elliot plays is mean-spirited,
shallow, vindictive, two-faced and
arrogant. Envious of David Letter
man's success, he suffers from the
delusion that Dave has both pan
dered to the NBC executives and
has conspired to limit Elliot's
amount of TV exposure. This far
out characterization is played by
Elliot to sneering and malevolent
perfection.
During his years on "Late
Night," Elliot's character has
developed both a personality and a
media history. Starting as the
Nervous Guy who would race
screaming from the audience at
the first sign of danger, he then
moved on to a segment called "The
Guy Under the Seats" where he
would emerge from a trap door in
the audience, claiming to be
"Zodar, king of the Mole People,"
or the captain of a German U-boat
run aground, inevitably venting
his violent rage at Letterman.
He then won a "series" of his
own, a '70s detective spoof called
"The Fugitive Guy," where he
played a man on the run, featur
ing such episodes as "Hold Me,
Kiss Me, Kill Me." This is where
the character leapt into the truly
bizarre, getting involved with "the
wrong crowd," forgetting lines,
threatening Dave and eventually
losing the "series" after a drunken
brawl with former NBC president
Grant Tinker. He has since
returned with such "series" as
"The Terminator Guy" (half Dr.
Strangelove, half Equalizer),
"Action Family" and "Night Time"
(a talk show).
□ Feuds — Bolstering Dave's im
age of meanness is the vindictive
ness of his feuds. By far, the
longest-lasting has been the tiff
with Joan Collins, despite the fact
that Dave recently admitted to Eva
Gabor that he had forgotten the
initial reason. (Collins had
promised to appear but then
backed down at the last minute.)
These feuds do not last forever;
Connie Chung atoned for her sin
of repossessing a Christmas fruit
basket she had accidentally sent
to "Late Night" by appearing on
the show to crack walnuts with
her bare hands.
Similarly, the once-serious feud
with Bryant Gumbel (Dave had in
terrupted an outdoor "Today"
show Interview by shouting from a

window through a megaphone,
"This is the president of NBC and
I'm not wearing any pants") seems
to be abating. Dave's ongoing
criticism of NBC's parent com
pany RCA was simply transferred
to the new owners, General
Electric, after Dave was physically
removed from the GE building
while attempting to welcome them
with a large fruit basket.
□ Guests — There is an odd rela
tionship between Dave and his
guests. He is considered to be un
mercifully cruel and mean
spirited, yet very few celebrities
avoid his show. His rudeness is
greatly over-exaggerated. His
worst jibes are always directed at
the pompous and egotistical,
never at the small fries like Alma
Ballard, the woman who dresses
parrots, or the obvious, like
Llberace or Eva Gabor. This ram

pant egalltarlanism has prompted
his guests into strange stunts:
Tom Selleck sticking his head In a
tub of water, Lisa Bonet stuffing
her mouth full of grapes, Bill Mur
ray becoming blood brothers with
Dave or doing aerobics. Llberace
cooking omelettes. Muriel
Hemingway cleaning fish. Ted
Koppel imitating Richard Nixon
and Cybill Shepherd appearing
clothed only In a towel.
□ Mellman, Larry "Bud" — The
reason for the popularity of this
chubby, balding, bemused senior
citizen with the chirpy voice,
manic laugh and impeccably poor
delivery is difficult to establish.
Since the start he has been used
for the most outrageous of "Late
Night" stunts. Whether wander
ing the halls of NBC in a bear
costume asking for change for a
five, celebrating the start of spring
by passing out free cigarettes on a
New York street corner or greeting
tourists at the bus depot with hot
towels, the comedy of the situa
tion is enhanced by his obvious
lack of ability.

He has recently been featured
less frequently (he now also ap
pears in commercials and on "The
New Hollywood Squares," having
reached the semi-stardom of TV's
truly talentless), though he has
lately reappeared as "The Big
Guy," wearing a 30-foot suit.
□ Props — Physical humor is very
important on "Late Night." so the
number of standard props is
large. Besides the window behind
Dave, and the various camera
tricks, Dave has utilized a mini
ature fountain and a colored light
gizmo called "The Dancing
Waters" (a la Liberace). various ar
tifacts from the New York Museum
of Natural History, a Lotto number
dispenser and a variety of can
nons. The tennis cannon used
years ago to destroy Steve Martin's
collection of priceless vases or
bombard the local New York "Live
at Five" news studio has been
replaced by the ping-pong ball
cannon and the confetti cannon
which currently punctuate the
start of each program. A bowling
ball cannon was once postulated.

but considered too dangerous.
□ Remotes — Remotes are seg
ments shot outside the studio,
generally In the streets of New
York. Though clearly Dave's forte,
the number of these has declined
in recent years due to Dave's
growing fame — he is recognized
on the streets more and more —
and the loss of Merlll Markoe,
Dave's significant other, who di
rected many of them. The best
remotes feature what has been
called "found" humor. There are
no planned jokes, simply Dave's
reaction to things already in exis
tence.
In the past Dave has tried to buy
a lamp shade in a place called
"Just Bulbs," and a light bulb in a
store called "Just Shades," visited
an "Optician — Coffee Shop" and
a toupee maker. Other, more in
volved remotes made up the scien
tific experiment series: overinflat
ing things with an air compres
sor, smashing things under a
steam roller, crushing things un
der a hydraulic press and drop
ping things off an eight-story

tower (including pink balloons
filled with guacamole).
□ Schaefer, Paul — Schaefer in
many ways serves as both band
leader and co-host. His banter
with Dave is distinctive for its lack
of polish and substance. He is of
ten visibly clueless during con
versations or questions. This,
however, is balanced by his fine
musical direction and one of the
subtlest parodies on television.
Many people criticize Schaefer for
his Hollywood-style shallowness,
not realizing this is all simply a
characterization.
□ Staff — Members of the "Late
Night" crew appear in many of the
show's skits. Some are easily
recognizable and have clear per
sonalities: the laconic Hal Frlsch,
the hyperactive but shy Barbara
Gaines (who can often be heard
screaming backstage) and the
easygoing, imperturbable cue
card boy. Kevin. Some are utilized
in frequent gags, like the quiet
Jimmy Fitzgerald, who in
"Technician's Corner" recom
mends the use of firearms as the
solution to just about any prob
lem. No other show seems to
develop such staff camaraderie.
□ Stupid Pet Tricks — The most
famous of the standard segments,
which is pretty much self
explanatory. Stupid Human
Tricks is similar.

□ Top Ten List — A relatively new
tradition of "Late Night" is the
nightly reading of a top ten list,
these ranked lists can cover al
most any topic. Last week the top
ten pick-up lines used by Gary
Hart was topped by: "Can 1 have a
large Slurpee. . . . Say. are you a
model?"
□ Wendell, Bill — The vocally
adept announcer, who rings in
each show with a two-Joke intro
duction (e.g. "From New York, the
city of brotherly love — and if you
don't like it you can get the hell
out. it's "Late Night". . . and now
here's a man whose only piece of
leather apparel Is his catcher's
mitt, David Letterman!"). Wendell
often serves as a target for Dave's
jokes, especially about weight or
lascivious character. Under
utilized, he is generally found in
citing the audience to unspon
taneous applause at inappropriate
moments throughout the show.
□ Window — The standard back
ground for Dave's desk, sporting a
fake view of New York City. From
early on the habit developed of tos
sing pencils through the window
to the sound of shattering glass.
The thrown objects have been ex
panded to include blue note cards
and practically any small gag prop
that doesn't work, while the
sounds elicited now range from an
elephant's trumpet to a foghorn.
"Late Night with David Letter

show dominates the competition,
charms the critics, impresses the
advertisers (commercial slots are
booked months in advance) and,
of course, cultivates a respectably

priate site for Dave's coronation
into television stardom, after
having risen from the ashes of a
disastrous morning program to
the pinnacle of his current show
in only a seven-year span. Las
Vegas, however, is the epitome of
the sleazy, bombastic entertain
ment "Late Night" has both
parodied and rebelled against; it is
home to the pompous, egotistical,
phony buffoons who have been
unmercifully skewered on Dave's
show. "Late Night" should have a
field day. more of a royal hunt
than a coronation.
Much of the success of "Late
Night" derives from its adven
turous anything-goes style. The
material is unusual and eccentric.
Whether racing dog sleds down
the NBC corridors or attempting
to bribe Mayor Tom Bradley in or
der to "fix" some Los Angeles
parking tickets, both the gags
themselves and their results are
often original and unexpected.
This wild quality differentiates
"Late Night" from the multitude of

Since the start he has been used
for the most outrageous of "Late
Night" stunts. Whether wander
ing the halls of NBC in a bear
costume asking for change for a
five, celebrating the start of spring
by passing out free cigarettes on a
New York street corner or greeting
tourists at the bus depot with hot
towels, the comedy of the situa
tion is enhanced by his obvious
lack of ability.

He has recently been featured
less frequently (he now also ap
pears in commercials and on "The
New Hollywood Squares," having
reached the semi-stardom of TV's
truly talentless), though he has
lately reappeared as "The Big
Guy," wearing a 30-foot suit.
□ Props — Physical humor is very
important on "Late Night." so the
number of standard props is
large. Besides the window behind
Dave, and the various camera
tricks, Dave has utilized a mini
ature fountain and a colored light
gizmo called "The Dancing
Waters" (a la Liberace). various ar
tifacts from the New York Museum
of Natural History, a Lotto number
dispenser and a variety of can
nons. The tennis cannon used
years ago to destroy Steve Martin's
collection of priceless vases or
bombard the local New York "Live
at Five" news studio has been
replaced by the ping-pong ball
cannon and the confetti cannon
which currently punctuate the
start of each program. A bowling
ball cannon was once postulated.

but considered too dangerous.
□ Remotes — Remotes are seg
ments shot outside the studio,
generally In the streets of New
York. Though clearly Dave's forte,
the number of these has declined
in recent years due to Dave's
growing fame — he is recognized
on the streets more and more —
and the loss of Merlll Markoe,
Dave's significant other, who di
rected many of them. The best
remotes feature what has been
called "found" humor. There are
no planned jokes, simply Dave's
reaction to things already in exis
tence.
In the past Dave has tried to buy
a lamp shade in a place called
"Just Bulbs," and a light bulb in a
store called "Just Shades," visited
an "Optician — Coffee Shop" and
a toupee maker. Other, more in
volved remotes made up the scien
tific experiment series: overinflat
ing things with an air compres
sor, smashing things under a
steam roller, crushing things un
der a hydraulic press and drop
ping things off an eight-story

tower (including pink balloons
filled with guacamole).
□ Schaefer, Paul — Schaefer in
many ways serves as both band
leader and co-host. His banter
with Dave is distinctive for its lack
of polish and substance. He is of
ten visibly clueless during con
versations or questions. This,
however, is balanced by his fine
musical direction and one of the
subtlest parodies on television.
Many people criticize Schaefer for
his Hollywood-style shallowness,
not realizing this is all simply a
characterization.
□ Staff — Members of the "Late
Night" crew appear in many of the
show's skits. Some are easily
recognizable and have clear per
sonalities: the laconic Hal Frlsch,
the hyperactive but shy Barbara
Gaines (who can often be heard
screaming backstage) and the
easygoing, imperturbable cue
card boy. Kevin. Some are utilized
in frequent gags, like the quiet
Jimmy Fitzgerald, who in
"Technician's Corner" recom
mends the use of firearms as the
solution to just about any prob
lem. No other show seems to
develop such staff camaraderie.
□ Stupid Pet Tricks — The most
famous of the standard segments,
which is pretty much self
explanatory. Stupid Human
Tricks is similar.

□ Top Ten List — A relatively new
tradition of "Late Night" is the
nightly reading of a top ten list,
these ranked lists can cover al
most any topic. Last week the top
ten pick-up lines used by Gary
Hart was topped by: "Can 1 have a
large Slurpee. . . . Say. are you a
model?"
□ Wendell, Bill — The vocally
adept announcer, who rings in
each show with a two-Joke intro
duction (e.g. "From New York, the
city of brotherly love — and if you
don't like it you can get the hell
out. it's "Late Night". . . and now
here's a man whose only piece of
leather apparel Is his catcher's
mitt, David Letterman!"). Wendell
often serves as a target for Dave's
jokes, especially about weight or
lascivious character. Under
utilized, he is generally found in
citing the audience to unspon
taneous applause at inappropriate
moments throughout the show.
□ Window — The standard back
ground for Dave's desk, sporting a
fake view of New York City. From
early on the habit developed of tos
sing pencils through the window
to the sound of shattering glass.
The thrown objects have been ex
panded to include blue note cards
and practically any small gag prop
that doesn't work, while the
sounds elicited now range from an
elephant's trumpet to a foghorn.
"Late Night with David Letter
man" has hit the big time. The
show dominates the competition,
charms the critics, impresses the
advertisers (commercial slots are
booked months in advance) and,
of course, cultivates a respectably
large and loyal audience. For those
who have never watched the pro
gram much, or never at all, this
week would be an opportune time
to tune in and observe. For only
the third time since the show
began five years ago. the show will
not be broadcast from the New
York studio. This time it will come
live from Las Vegas.
This would seem to be an appro
priate site for Dave's coronation
into television stardom, after
having risen from the ashes of a
disastrous morning program to
the pinnacle of his current show
in only a seven-year span. Las
Vegas, however, is the epitome of
the sleazy, bombastic entertain
ment "Late Night" has both
parodied and rebelled against; it is
home to the pompous, egotistical,
phony buffoons who have been
unmercifully skewered on Dave's
show. "Late Night" should have a
field day. more of a royal hunt
than a coronation.
Much of the success of "Late
Night" derives from its adven
turous anything-goes style. The
material is unusual and eccentric.
Whether racing dog sleds down
the NBC corridors or attempting
to bribe Mayor Tom Bradley in or
der to "fix" some Los Angeles
parking tickets, both the gags
themselves and their results are
often original and unexpected.
This wild quality differentiates
"Late Night" from the multitude of
other talk shows, particularly the
calcified "Tonight Show" with
Johnny Carson.
The other factor that particu
larly enhances the cult-like
popularity of "Late Night" is the
familiarity the viewer gains with
the show. The prominence of the
show's crew and a few feature
players (like Larry "Bud" Mellman
and Chris Elliot) in skits and gags
gives the program a soap opera
quality. The use of standard gags
and lines develops a comedic
tradition.
The result of these two aspects
is to obscure much of the humor
to the uninitiated viewer; the
more one watches, the more one

understands. Nearly everything is
an "in" joke. A "Late Night" guide
may be appropriate at this time.
□ Camera — Technical innovat
ions have always been a major
aspect of the show's originality.
One episode featured the full slow
rotation of the picture on the TV
screen during the program. An
other was dubbed with the voices

of different actors. Each show,
however, features some standard
camera gimmick. Beginning with
the simple overhead "Late Night
Sky-Cam," the show progressed to
the moving "Late Night Sky-Cam
Plus" and finally now to the "Late
Night Thrill-Cam" which moves
its way over the audience, bounc
ing and jiggling to the accompani
ment of screaming voices. Other
camera stunts include attaching a
camera to various moving objects,
a la "Monkey-Cam I," "Monkey-
Cam II," "Cow-Cam." and "Guest-
Cam," worn by Tom Hanks.
□ Elliot, Chris — Once Larry
"Bud" Mellman (see Mellman,
Larry "Bud") reigned supreme as
the "Late Night" featured player.
His replacement. Chris Elliot, is

far more interesting. The charac
ter Elliot plays is mean-spirited,
shallow, vindictive, two-faced and
arrogant. Envious of David Letter
man's success, he suffers from the
delusion that Dave has both pan
dered to the NBC executives and
has conspired to limit Elliot's
amount of TV exposure. This far
out characterization is played by
Elliot to sneering and malevolent
perfection.
During his years on "Late
Night," Elliot's character has
developed both a personality and a
media history. Starting as the
Nervous Guy who would race
screaming from the audience at
the first sign of danger, he then
moved on to a segment called "The
Guy Under the Seats" where he
would emerge from a trap door in
the audience, claiming to be
"Zodar, king of the Mole People,"
or the captain of a German U-boat
run aground, inevitably venting
his violent rage at Letterman.
He then won a "series" of his
own, a '70s detective spoof called
"The Fugitive Guy," where he
played a man on the run, featur
ing such episodes as "Hold Me,
Kiss Me, Kill Me." This is where
the character leapt into the truly
bizarre, getting involved with "the
wrong crowd," forgetting lines,
threatening Dave and eventually
losing the "series" after a drunken
brawl with former NBC president
Grant Tinker. He has since
returned with such "series" as
"The Terminator Guy" (half Dr.
Strangelove, half Equalizer),
"Action Family" and "Night Time"
(a talk show).
□ Feuds — Bolstering Dave's im
age of meanness is the vindictive
ness of his feuds. By far, the
longest-lasting has been the tiff
with Joan Collins, despite the fact
that Dave recently admitted to Eva
Gabor that he had forgotten the
initial reason. (Collins had
promised to appear but then
backed down at the last minute.)
These feuds do not last forever;
Connie Chung atoned for her sin
of repossessing a Christmas fruit
basket she had accidentally sent
to "Late Night" by appearing on
the show to crack walnuts with
her bare hands.
Similarly, the once-serious feud
with Bryant Gumbel (Dave had in
terrupted an outdoor "Today"
show Interview by shouting from a

window through a megaphone,
"This is the president of NBC and
I'm not wearing any pants") seems
to be abating. Dave's ongoing
criticism of NBC's parent com
pany RCA was simply transferred
to the new owners, General
Electric, after Dave was physically
removed from the GE building
while attempting to welcome them
with a large fruit basket.
□ Guests — There is an odd rela
tionship between Dave and his
guests. He is considered to be un
mercifully cruel and mean
spirited, yet very few celebrities
avoid his show. His rudeness is
greatly over-exaggerated. His
worst jibes are always directed at
the pompous and egotistical,
never at the small fries like Alma
Ballard, the woman who dresses
parrots, or the obvious, like
Llberace or Eva Gabor. This ram

pant egalltarlanism has prompted
his guests into strange stunts:
Tom Selleck sticking his head In a
tub of water, Lisa Bonet stuffing
her mouth full of grapes, Bill Mur
ray becoming blood brothers with
Dave or doing aerobics. Llberace
cooking omelettes. Muriel
Hemingway cleaning fish. Ted
Koppel imitating Richard Nixon
and Cybill Shepherd appearing
clothed only In a towel.
□ Mellman, Larry "Bud" — The
reason for the popularity of this
chubby, balding, bemused senior
citizen with the chirpy voice,
manic laugh and impeccably poor
delivery is difficult to establish.
Since the start he has been used
for the most outrageous of "Late
Night" stunts. Whether wander
ing the halls of NBC in a bear
costume asking for change for a
five, celebrating the start of spring
by passing out free cigarettes on a
New York street corner or greeting
tourists at the bus depot with hot
towels, the comedy of the situa
tion is enhanced by his obvious
lack of ability.

He has recently been featured
less frequently (he now also ap

New Hollywood Squares," having
reached the semi-stardom of TV's
truly talentless), though he has
lately reappeared as "The Big

Waters" (a la Liberace). various ar
tifacts from the New York Museum
of Natural History, a Lotto number
dispenser and a variety of can
nons. The tennis cannon used
years ago to destroy Steve Martin's
collection of priceless vases or
bombard the local New York "Live
at Five" news studio has been
replaced by the ping-pong ball
cannon and the confetti cannon
which currently punctuate the
start of each program. A bowling

tower (including pink balloons
filled with guacamole).

gives the program a soap opera
quality. The use of standard gags
and lines develops a comedic
tradition.
The result of these two aspects
is to obscure much of the humor
to the uninitiated viewer; the
more one watches, the more one

understands. Nearly everything is
an "in" joke. A "Late Night" guide
may be appropriate at this time.
□ Camera — Technical innovat
ions have always been a major
aspect of the show's originality.
One episode featured the full slow
rotation of the picture on the TV
screen during the program. An
other was dubbed with the voices

of different actors. Each show,
however, features some standard
camera gimmick. Beginning with
the simple overhead "Late Night
Sky-Cam," the show progressed to
the moving "Late Night Sky-Cam
Plus" and finally now to the "Late
Night Thrill-Cam" which moves
its way over the audience, bounc
ing and jiggling to the accompani
ment of screaming voices. Other
camera stunts include attaching a
camera to various moving objects,
a la "Monkey-Cam I," "Monkey-
Cam II," "Cow-Cam." and "Guest-
Cam," worn by Tom Hanks.
□ Elliot, Chris — Once Larry
"Bud" Mellman (see Mellman,
Larry "Bud") reigned supreme as
the "Late Night" featured player.
His replacement. Chris Elliot, is

far more interesting. The charac
ter Elliot plays is mean-spirited,
shallow, vindictive, two-faced and
arrogant. Envious of David Letter
man's success, he suffers from the
delusion that Dave has both pan
dered to the NBC executives and
has conspired to limit Elliot's
amount of TV exposure. This far
out characterization is played by
Elliot to sneering and malevolent
perfection.
During his years on "Late
Night," Elliot's character has
developed both a personality and a
media history. Starting as the
Nervous Guy who would race
screaming from the audience at
the first sign of danger, he then
moved on to a segment called "The
Guy Under the Seats" where he
would emerge from a trap door in
the audience, claiming to be
"Zodar, king of the Mole People,"
or the captain of a German U-boat
run aground, inevitably venting
his violent rage at Letterman.
He then won a "series" of his
own, a '70s detective spoof called
"The Fugitive Guy," where he
played a man on the run, featur
ing such episodes as "Hold Me,
Kiss Me, Kill Me." This is where
the character leapt into the truly
bizarre, getting involved with "the
wrong crowd," forgetting lines,
threatening Dave and eventually
losing the "series" after a drunken
brawl with former NBC president
Grant Tinker. He has since
returned with such "series" as
"The Terminator Guy" (half Dr.
Strangelove, half Equalizer),
"Action Family" and "Night Time"
(a talk show).
□ Feuds — Bolstering Dave's im
age of meanness is the vindictive
ness of his feuds. By far, the
longest-lasting has been the tiff
with Joan Collins, despite the fact
that Dave recently admitted to Eva
Gabor that he had forgotten the
initial reason. (Collins had
promised to appear but then
backed down at the last minute.)
These feuds do not last forever;
Connie Chung atoned for her sin
of repossessing a Christmas fruit
basket she had accidentally sent
to "Late Night" by appearing on
the show to crack walnuts with
her bare hands.
Similarly, the once-serious feud
with Bryant Gumbel (Dave had in
terrupted an outdoor "Today"
show Interview by shouting from a

window through a megaphone,
"This is the president of NBC and
I'm not wearing any pants") seems
to be abating. Dave's ongoing
criticism of NBC's parent com
pany RCA was simply transferred
to the new owners, General
Electric, after Dave was physically
removed from the GE building
while attempting to welcome them
with a large fruit basket.
□ Guests — There is an odd rela
tionship between Dave and his
guests. He is considered to be un
mercifully cruel and mean
spirited, yet very few celebrities
avoid his show. His rudeness is
greatly over-exaggerated. His
worst jibes are always directed at
the pompous and egotistical,
never at the small fries like Alma
Ballard, the woman who dresses
parrots, or the obvious, like
Llberace or Eva Gabor. This ram

pant egalltarlanism has prompted
his guests into strange stunts:
Tom Selleck sticking his head In a
tub of water, Lisa Bonet stuffing
her mouth full of grapes, Bill Mur
ray becoming blood brothers with
Dave or doing aerobics. Llberace
cooking omelettes. Muriel
Hemingway cleaning fish. Ted
Koppel imitating Richard Nixon
and Cybill Shepherd appearing
clothed only In a towel.
□ Mellman, Larry "Bud" — The
reason for the popularity of this
chubby, balding, bemused senior
citizen with the chirpy voice,
manic laugh and impeccably poor
delivery is difficult to establish.
Since the start he has been used
for the most outrageous of "Late
Night" stunts. Whether wander
ing the halls of NBC in a bear
costume asking for change for a
five, celebrating the start of spring
by passing out free cigarettes on a
New York street corner or greeting
tourists at the bus depot with hot
towels, the comedy of the situa
tion is enhanced by his obvious
lack of ability.

He has recently been featured
less frequently (he now also ap
pears in commercials and on "The
New Hollywood Squares," having
reached the semi-stardom of TV's
truly talentless), though he has
lately reappeared as "The Big
Guy," wearing a 30-foot suit.
□ Props — Physical humor is very
important on "Late Night." so the
number of standard props is
large. Besides the window behind
Dave, and the various camera
tricks, Dave has utilized a mini
ature fountain and a colored light
gizmo called "The Dancing
Waters" (a la Liberace). various ar
tifacts from the New York Museum
of Natural History, a Lotto number
dispenser and a variety of can
nons. The tennis cannon used
years ago to destroy Steve Martin's
collection of priceless vases or
bombard the local New York "Live
at Five" news studio has been
replaced by the ping-pong ball
cannon and the confetti cannon
which currently punctuate the
start of each program. A bowling
ball cannon was once postulated.

but considered too dangerous.
□ Remotes — Remotes are seg
ments shot outside the studio,
generally In the streets of New
York. Though clearly Dave's forte,
the number of these has declined
in recent years due to Dave's
growing fame — he is recognized
on the streets more and more —
and the loss of Merlll Markoe,
Dave's significant other, who di
rected many of them. The best
remotes feature what has been
called "found" humor. There are
no planned jokes, simply Dave's
reaction to things already in exis
tence.
In the past Dave has tried to buy
a lamp shade in a place called
"Just Bulbs," and a light bulb in a
store called "Just Shades," visited
an "Optician — Coffee Shop" and
a toupee maker. Other, more in
volved remotes made up the scien
tific experiment series: overinflat
ing things with an air compres
sor, smashing things under a
steam roller, crushing things un
der a hydraulic press and drop
ping things off an eight-story

tower (including pink balloons
filled with guacamole).
□ Schaefer, Paul — Schaefer in
many ways serves as both band
leader and co-host. His banter
with Dave is distinctive for its lack
of polish and substance. He is of
ten visibly clueless during con
versations or questions. This,
however, is balanced by his fine
musical direction and one of the
subtlest parodies on television.
Many people criticize Schaefer for
his Hollywood-style shallowness,
not realizing this is all simply a
characterization.
□ Staff — Members of the "Late
Night" crew appear in many of the
show's skits. Some are easily
recognizable and have clear per
sonalities: the laconic Hal Frlsch,
the hyperactive but shy Barbara
Gaines (who can often be heard
screaming backstage) and the
easygoing, imperturbable cue
card boy. Kevin. Some are utilized
in frequent gags, like the quiet
Jimmy Fitzgerald, who in
"Technician's Corner" recom
mends the use of firearms as the
solution to just about any prob
lem. No other show seems to
develop such staff camaraderie.
□ Stupid Pet Tricks — The most
famous of the standard segments,
which is pretty much self
explanatory. Stupid Human
Tricks is similar.

□ Top Ten List — A relatively new
tradition of "Late Night" is the
nightly reading of a top ten list,
these ranked lists can cover al
most any topic. Last week the top
ten pick-up lines used by Gary
Hart was topped by: "Can 1 have a
large Slurpee. . . . Say. are you a
model?"
□ Wendell, Bill — The vocally
adept announcer, who rings in
each show with a two-Joke intro
duction (e.g. "From New York, the
city of brotherly love — and if you
don't like it you can get the hell
out. it's "Late Night". . . and now
here's a man whose only piece of
leather apparel Is his catcher's
mitt, David Letterman!"). Wendell
often serves as a target for Dave's
jokes, especially about weight or
lascivious character. Under
utilized, he is generally found in
citing the audience to unspon
taneous applause at inappropriate
moments throughout the show.
□ Window — The standard back
ground for Dave's desk, sporting a
fake view of New York City. From
early on the habit developed of tos
sing pencils through the window
to the sound of shattering glass.
The thrown objects have been ex
panded to include blue note cards
and practically any small gag prop
that doesn't work, while the
sounds elicited now range from an
elephant's trumpet to a foghorn.
"Late Night with David Letter
man" has hit the big time. The
show dominates the competition,
charms the critics, impresses the
advertisers (commercial slots are
booked months in advance) and,
of course, cultivates a respectably
large and loyal audience. For those
who have never watched the pro
gram much, or never at all, this
week would be an opportune time
to tune in and observe. For only
the third time since the show
began five years ago. the show will
not be broadcast from the New
York studio. This time it will come
live from Las Vegas.
This would seem to be an appro
priate site for Dave's coronation
into television stardom, after
having risen from the ashes of a
disastrous morning program to
the pinnacle of his current show
in only a seven-year span. Las
Vegas, however, is the epitome of
the sleazy, bombastic entertain
ment "Late Night" has both
parodied and rebelled against; it is
home to the pompous, egotistical,
phony buffoons who have been
unmercifully skewered on Dave's
show. "Late Night" should have a
field day. more of a royal hunt
than a coronation.
Much of the success of "Late
Night" derives from its adven
turous anything-goes style. The
material is unusual and eccentric.
Whether racing dog sleds down
the NBC corridors or attempting
to bribe Mayor Tom Bradley in or
der to "fix" some Los Angeles
parking tickets, both the gags
themselves and their results are
often original and unexpected.
This wild quality differentiates
"Late Night" from the multitude of
other talk shows, particularly the
calcified "Tonight Show" with
Johnny Carson.
The other factor that particu
larly enhances the cult-like
popularity of "Late Night" is the
familiarity the viewer gains with
the show. The prominence of the
show's crew and a few feature
players (like Larry "Bud" Mellman
and Chris Elliot) in skits and gags
gives the program a soap opera
quality. The use of standard gags
and lines develops a comedic
tradition.
The result of these two aspects
is to obscure much of the humor
to the uninitiated viewer; the
more one watches, the more one

understands. Nearly everything is
an "in" joke. A "Late Night" guide
may be appropriate at this time.
