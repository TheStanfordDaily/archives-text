Sinatra at The Sands
(Reprise, 1019-2)
A problem that plagues jazz CDs more
than classical ones Is short playing time
— a lot of old records contain only 30
minutes of music. The transfers to CD
don't make them sound any better, and
they cost three times as much. We were
going to recommend Getz/Gllberto (Verve
810 048), with its 33 measly minutes of
music, and Sinatra and Basle's "It Might
As Well Be Swing" (Reprise 1012-2), with
27 minutes of music. Both are absolute
jazz classics, but we recommend that you
buy them as albums. There is one
Slnatra/Basie recording we suggest you
buy on CD: "Sinatra at the Sands" (over
72 minutes of music), featuring the
Count Basle Band with Quincy Jones
conducting his own arrangements.
Taped live at The Sands in 1966, this
album captures the magic of the whole
performance. Everything is here — from
the introductions to Sinatra's mono
logues. If you are not interested in
hearing the talk, it is particularly easy to
skip on CD, but taken as a whole the disc
makes you feel like you are at the concert.

An exciting disc with surprisingly good
sound. Both Sinatra and the Basie Band
are at their best on this disc. "Sinatra at
The Sands" is still available as a two
album set but is a great buy with all 21
cuts on one CD.
Ella Fitzgerald
The Songbooks
(Verve 823 445-2)
Also in the "too-good-to-pass-up" cate
gory is this disc with Ella Fitzgerald sing
ing excerpts from six Verve songbook al
bums. recorded from 1956 to 1964. Com
posers and lyricists include George and
Ira Gershwin, Jerome Kern, Harold Arlen,
Johnny Mercer, Rogers and Hart, and Ir
ving Berlin. Ella is at her best; the tunes
represent highlights from the American
song tradition, including "Oh Lady Be
Good," " Fasclnatin' Rhythm," "All the
Things You Are," "Over the Rainbow,"
"My Funny Valentine" and "Have You Met
Miss Jones" (19 tunes in all). The ar
rangements by Nelson Riddle, Billy May,
Paul Weston and Buddy Bregman are ex
cellent.
If you are expecting songs in the up
tempo Ella Fitzgerald style, be warned
that this is a collection of her more quiet
and subtle tunes. There are not a lot of
high-energy numbers; the emphasis Is on
gentle swing and ballads. "Fasclnatin'

Rhythm" for instance is much slower
than you might expect, but it does swing
and you can hear every word. Under
standing the words is especially impor
tant on songs like "The Lady is a Tramp."
which no one does better than Ella.
You can buy these six albums sepa
rately or this collection of three cuts from
each LP. 65 minutes of music total.
Big Band Treasure Vol. 1 and 2
(Dunhill DZSO23 & DZSO24)
The most important thing to get
straight about these discs is that they are
big band treasure and not big band
favorites. If you want the classic hits that
everybody knows from the Big Band Era
— "In the Mood." "Satin Doll" and
"Sentimental Journey' — then these
discs are not for you. This collection con
sists primarily of previously unrecorded
versions of tunes from early '40s radio
broadcasts. Several of the radio voice
overs are included to give it the feel of an
old radio show.

The sound Is as good as can be ex
pected, but it won't sound like most of
your other CDs. In fact, it sounds a lot like
KCEA 89.1 FM (yeah, the one with the
"sounds of the sea" at night). Featured
are the bands of Harry James. Les Brown,
Duke Ellington. Woody Herman. Glen
Gray and Jimmy Dorsey. These discs. 45
minutes each, could have had a little
more music on them. Save yourself some
money and turn on the radio.
David Sanborn
A Change of Heart
(Warner Brothers 9 25479-2)
The high production quality of San
born's new release is at least as good as
his other recordings, making this a very
worthwhile choice for your CD collection.
Sanborn's cutting, high-energy sound
comes through full force on "Chicago
Song." and Marcus Miller's bass will blow
you away. Three different drummers are
featured on this album, including Steve
Gadd. and particular attention has been
paid to the digital drum style. Sanborn
has always surrounded himself with
players and engineers who help him
create the "Sanborn Sound." This CD
suggests that superproduced studio
music can be a medium unto itself.
"Tintin" and "Summer" emphasize this
point: The idea is no longer to imitate a

"live sound" in the studio. Michael
Brecker's EWI (Electronic Wind Instru
ment) solo on the title cut fits in perfectly
and Hiram Bullock's elastic guitar sound
can be heard throughout.
The only criticism we have is that with
all of the attention to production detail,
some of the tunes lack musical complex
ity. In general, the solos are short and
several of the cuts are similar. For San
born fans, however, these are details that
don't matter. 40 minutes of the new San
born sound.
