## Women netters set to defend national crown 
### KEN STEVENS Senior staff writer 
LOS ANGELES — For the past
six seasons, Stanford and USC
have ruled the women's tennis
kingdom, taking home three team
championship trophies apiece.
This year, though, the Cardinal
and Trojans will be hard pressed
to keep one of several upstart
teams from altering the NCAA
power structure for the first time
ever.
Fourth-seeded Stanford (18-4)
and 13th-seeded USC (14-12)
meet in the first round of the 1987
NCAA Women's Tennis Team
Championships today at 9 a.m. at
the UCLA/Los Angeles Tennis
Center, Last year in Austin,
Texas, the Cardinal defeated the
Trojans 5-4 to capture the team
trophy.
The winner of this morning's
match will have to travel a difficult
road to the title. If all goes as ex
pected, Stanford or USC would
have to beat, in succession, fifth
seeded host UCLA, top-seeded
Florida and No. 2 Miami or No. 3
California.
As if the draw does not present
enough problems, both the Card
inal and Trojans will be playing
without their full lineups. Stan
ford's Cari Hagey, who has not
played since injuring her left knee
in the Cardinal's April 4 match
against USC, reinjured the knee
last week in practice and did not
accompany the team here.
Hagey. one of the team's top
doubles performers, had been
practicing recently and was ex
pected to play No. 3 doubles this
week. "Physically she was doing
fine," Stanford Coach Frank Bren
nan said.

But the Cardinal junior
reinjured the knee while reaching
for a shot In practice. "We didn't
know how weak it was." Brennan
said. "She's going to have to get
surgery."
USC has been without its top
player for most of the season.
Caroline Kuhlman — last year's
No. 1-ranked player nationally un
til she lost to Stanford's Patty Fen
dick in the quarterfinals of the
NCAA singles tournament — has
been bothered by tendonitis in her
knees and will not play this week.
In addition. Mary Norwood, one of
USC's top three players, has ten
donitis in her right ankle and is
questionable for today's match.
Even though the Trojans have
several new faces in their lineup
this season, they played two tight
matches against the Cardinal,
and Brennan expects more of the
same this morning. "It will be a
tough one," he said. "They're al
ways tough, and they know how to
do It.
"I think we'll be OK," Brennan
added. "We beat them twice (this
season)."
USC has been led by Maeve
Quinlan at the No. 1 singles posi
tion. Though she does not possess
Kuhlman's talent. Quinlan was
the only player to extend Fendick
to three sets during the 1987
dual-match season.
The Trojans' No. 1 doubles team
of Ginny Purdy and Lupita Novelo
is the only squad to have beaten
Stanford's top team of Fendick
and Stephanie Savides since
February.
The Cardinal's lineup is set for
the first time this season, but
questions still remain: Have Leigh
Anne Eldredge and Eleni Rossides
progressed enough in the past two

weeks to give Stanford key vic
tories In the No. 5 and No. 6
singles matches? And will the
Cardinal's new doubles teams be
able to come through under pres
sure?
"Leigh Anne's feeling pretty
good, and Elenl's playing well,"
Brennan said Monday. He added,
however, that he Is "worried about
everything."
Brennan Is most concerned
about the doubles. "Our No. 1
team is very good. Our No. 2 team
(Eldredge and Junior Kay Tittle)
can play pretty well, (but) they
haven't got as much experience as
I would have liked," he said.
Without the services of Hagey,
Stanford will be particularly vul
nerable at the No. 3 doubles spot,
where sophomore Cindy
Buchsbaum and freshman Lisa
Green will play together.
Buchsbaum has been in and out
of the doubles lineup, and Green
has been inconsistent in doubles.
"Cindy is a good doubles
player," Brennan said. "She can
help Lisa a lot. It (the No. 3 team)
could be very good."
Brennan will not have to worry
about the No. 1 singles match.
Fendlck will put her 30-0 1987
record on the line against Quin
lan, whom she has already
defeated twice this season.
The team tournament con
cludes Sunday with the 1 p.m.
final. The NCAA singles and
doubles tournaments will follow
Monday through Thursday. Fen
dick, the defending national
singles champion, will likely be
the top seed this year. Joining
Fendick in the singles draw will be
Savides, Green and Tittle. Fendick
and Savides will also take part In
the doubles.

and Savides will also take part In
the doubles.

Today's first-round match against USC will be the first taste of NCAA championship competition for fresh
man Lisa Green, but not for most of her teammates, who hope to retain the title they won last season.
LOS ANGELES — For the past
six seasons, Stanford and USC
have ruled the women's tennis
kingdom, taking home three team
championship trophies apiece.
This year, though, the Cardinal
and Trojans will be hard pressed
to keep one of several upstart
teams from altering the NCAA
power structure for the first time
ever.
Fourth-seeded Stanford (18-4)
and 13th-seeded USC (14-12)
meet in the first round of the 1987
NCAA Women's Tennis Team
Championships today at 9 a.m. at
the UCLA/Los Angeles Tennis
Center, Last year in Austin,
Texas, the Cardinal defeated the
Trojans 5-4 to capture the team
trophy.
The winner of this morning's
match will have to travel a difficult
road to the title. If all goes as ex
pected, Stanford or USC would
have to beat, in succession, fifth
seeded host UCLA, top-seeded
Florida and No. 2 Miami or No. 3
California.
As if the draw does not present
enough problems, both the Card
inal and Trojans will be playing
without their full lineups. Stan
ford's Cari Hagey, who has not
played since injuring her left knee
in the Cardinal's April 4 match
against USC, reinjured the knee
last week in practice and did not
accompany the team here.
Hagey. one of the team's top
doubles performers, had been
practicing recently and was ex
pected to play No. 3 doubles this
week. "Physically she was doing
fine," Stanford Coach Frank Bren
nan said.

But the Cardinal junior
reinjured the knee while reaching
for a shot In practice. "We didn't
know how weak it was." Brennan
said. "She's going to have to get
surgery."
USC has been without its top
player for most of the season.
Caroline Kuhlman — last year's
No. 1-ranked player nationally un
til she lost to Stanford's Patty Fen
dick in the quarterfinals of the
NCAA singles tournament — has
been bothered by tendonitis in her
knees and will not play this week.
In addition. Mary Norwood, one of
USC's top three players, has ten
donitis in her right ankle and is
questionable for today's match.
Even though the Trojans have
several new faces in their lineup
this season, they played two tight
matches against the Cardinal,
and Brennan expects more of the
same this morning. "It will be a
tough one," he said. "They're al
ways tough, and they know how to
do It.
"I think we'll be OK," Brennan
added. "We beat them twice (this
season)."
USC has been led by Maeve
Quinlan at the No. 1 singles posi
tion. Though she does not possess
Kuhlman's talent. Quinlan was
the only player to extend Fendick
to three sets during the 1987
dual-match season.
The Trojans' No. 1 doubles team
of Ginny Purdy and Lupita Novelo
is the only squad to have beaten
Stanford's top team of Fendick
and Stephanie Savides since
February.
The Cardinal's lineup is set for
the first time this season, but
questions still remain: Have Leigh
Anne Eldredge and Eleni Rossides
progressed enough in the past two

weeks to give Stanford key vic
tories In the No. 5 and No. 6
singles matches? And will the
Cardinal's new doubles teams be
able to come through under pres
sure?
"Leigh Anne's feeling pretty
good, and Elenl's playing well,"
Brennan said Monday. He added,
however, that he Is "worried about
everything."
Brennan Is most concerned
about the doubles. "Our No. 1
team is very good. Our No. 2 team
(Eldredge and Junior Kay Tittle)
can play pretty well, (but) they
haven't got as much experience as
I would have liked," he said.
Without the services of Hagey,
Stanford will be particularly vul
nerable at the No. 3 doubles spot,
where sophomore Cindy
Buchsbaum and freshman Lisa
Green will play together.
Buchsbaum has been in and out
of the doubles lineup, and Green
has been inconsistent in doubles.
"Cindy is a good doubles
player," Brennan said. "She can
help Lisa a lot. It (the No. 3 team)
could be very good."
Brennan will not have to worry
about the No. 1 singles match.
Fendlck will put her 30-0 1987
record on the line against Quin
lan, whom she has already
defeated twice this season.
The team tournament con
cludes Sunday with the 1 p.m.
final. The NCAA singles and
doubles tournaments will follow
Monday through Thursday. Fen
dick, the defending national
singles champion, will likely be
the top seed this year. Joining
Fendick in the singles draw will be
Savides, Green and Tittle. Fendick
and Savides will also take part In
the doubles.
