Some say you can't combine strong academics
with a successful athletic program. But Stanford's
academic reputation was a key factor in attracting
three top recruits for the men's tennis team.
One day after his team was denied a invitation to
defend its national title at the NCAA Championships
in Athens, Ga., Stanford Coach Dick Gould an
nounced his 1987 recruiting class, which includes
three of the top six high school seniors in the
country.
"I wouldn't trade the guys I've got for anybody's
freshmen," Gould said.
The three Gould is especially excited about are
David Wheaton from Excelsior, Minn., Glenn
Solomon from Roslyn Heights, N.Y., and Martin
Blackman. from Barbados and Bronx. N.Y.
"Wheaton and Blackman are aggressive serve-and
volley players and have unlimited potential." Gould
said. "Solomon is very coachable, and I think he has
improved greatly over the last twelve months."
Also coming to Stanford will be Dan Turbow of
Santa Ana, Jason Yee of Orlando, Fla., and Peter
Johnson of Salt Lake City.
The only other class of recruits approaching the
caliber of Stanford's is that of Georgia. The Bulldogs
received letters of intent from A 1 Parker, the top
ranked player in the 18-and-under category. Chris
Garner, who is ranked third, and Francisco Mon
tana, who is ranked 10(h.
Between them. Georgia and Stanford have nine of
the top 12 players 18 and under. Current Georgia
freshmen are No. 4 Stephen Enochs and No. 6 John
Boytim. Stanford freshmen Jeff Tarango and Jeff
Cathrall are ranked fifth and 11th respectively, with
Wheaton currently ranking second and Solomon
12th. In addition. Blackman is the national cham
pion in the 16-and-under category and reached the
semifinals of the U.S. Open juniors.
"You can't say no one else is going to be any good."
Gould commented, "but Georgia and Stanford are
going to be very good next year."
All three players cited Stanford's dual offering of
strong academics and strong tennis program as a
reason for coming.
"I was debating between UCLA, Minnesota, Stan
ford and Pepperdine." said Wheaton. who will
partner this summer with Tarango in doubles for the
third consecutive year. "I looked at the campus, the
coach, the guys on the team and the academics. Ba
sically, everything overweighed everything else at any
other school. I've been wanting to go to Stanford for
over a year."
"I was looking for a top-10 athletic program and a
top academic program." Solomon said. "Stanford
was far and away the No. 1 school for that in the
country. 1 love California and the campus was just
beautiful, and I had a great time when I visited."
"Both my brothers went (to Stanford)." Blackman
said. "I went up to see their graduation and I liked
the campus. I was looking for a school from which I
could get good academics and a good tennis pro
gram."
The last time Stanford was denied a national
tournament bid. in 1982, the Cardinal came back to
recapture the national title the next year. This class,
combined with the emergence of several strong
rookies this season, figures to provide the depth to
attempt to repeat the past.
"I think we'll have a lot of competition for starting
positions on the team which will help us a lot." Gould
said.
