# Gawthrop leads crew into Pacific Coasts
## 
### DON HOGUE 
This weekend the Stanford crews
travel to Sacramento for the Pacific
Coast Rowing Championships Satur
day and Sunday at Lake Natoma.
For women's crew captain Lynn
Gawthrop. this year's championships
will be a homecoming, as she will row
just a few miles from her Sacramento
home.
In fact, her parents are organizing
the Cardinal's road trip to
Sacramento. The women's varsity
eight will stay with the Gawthrops.
while the other crews will stay with
neighbors and Stanford alumni in the
area.
"My mom — she loves it," Gawthrop
said with a smile. "She's done this for
the past four years."
Gawthrop is looking forward to
coming home to be with her parents
and 25-year-old brother. "This is the
first time my brother will be able to
see me row," she said.
But as a fifth-year senior, the ener
getic Gawthrop will be rowing for the
final time for what has become her
second home — the Stanford crew
program.
When Gawthrop first came to Stan
ford in the fall of 1982, she was deter
mined to become involved in sports
and thought about "walking on" to
the swimming or field hockey teams.
A sophomore friend, however, sugges
ted she attend a crew meeting during
the first week of school. She's been
rowing ever since.
"It's definitely been the focus of my
Stanford career." Gawthrop said. "I
don't think I'd have it any other way.".
Although constantly involved in
other sports. Gawthrop said she was
attracted to crew as the "ultimate in
team sports. Everyone has to be on
the same wavelength, mind-set and
physical movements to be success
ful."
Gawthrop and the Cardinal women
are hoping the momentum from last
weekend's victory over California will
enable Stanford to topple top seed
Washington. Stanford Is ranked
second on the West Coast, behind
only the Huskies.
"We'll just have to give it all we have
to get Washington," Gawthrop said.
"They might be No. 1 in the nation
this year, so it could be tough." As
captain this year. Gawthrop has been
the catalyst that Coach John Davis
needs to improve on last year's
second-place finish at the Pacific
Coast Championships.
"She's the epitome of the positive
Stanford Image." Davis said. "She's a
real delight to know. She make
friends easily and has a real sense of
team dynamics. She's dependable as
an athlete in the boat, as a captain
and. to the people who know her.
she's dependable as a friend."
Gawthrops alarm clock is set for
5:17 a.m.. "just early enough for me
to hit the snooze button once," she
said. She's on the team bus at 5:40.
and the 20-minute ride to the boat

house in Redwood City is just long
enough to shake off the last bit of
sleepiness. The crew is rowing by
6:30, usually finishing by 8 — when
most fellow students are starting to
hit their own snooze buttons.
Gawthrop is majoring in human bi
ology with an emphasis in psychology
and child development. She has
added teaching 3-year-olds at Bing
Nursery School on campus to an
already busy schedule this year.
"I was looking into being a teacher,
and maybe a coach, at a prep school,"
she said. Gawthrop stopped out fall
quarter and assisted Davis and
Novice Coach Charlotte Hollings with
coaching duties.
"It was great because all I did was
row and coach this fall." she said. She
was in charge of the land training for
the largest turnout ever for the
women's crew — including many
women who had never held an oar
before coming to Stanford. She
helped plan workouts with Davis and
Hollings. then rowed in many of them
with her teammates. She returned for
a second workout in the afternoon.
"The fun part, though." she said,
"is coaching on the water — when
you're in the launch (boat) with the
megaphone, doing what the head
honchos do. The great thing about

coaching is seeing the results of your
work."
Gawthrop gave Davis a scare when
she left the crew her junior year to
study at the Stanford Overseas
Studies center in Florence, Italy. "He
didn't want me to go." she said. "He
didn't know I'd be coming back for a
fifth year. However. I was glad I went.
It was the greatest experience."
Although half a world away.
Gawthrop didn't distance herself
from rowing. She joined the Rowing
Society of Florence and rowed on the
River Arno.
One of her more memorable mo
ments in crew was during her sopho
more year in the Big Row against Cali
fornia. The race was at Redwood
Shores when the course was only
1.000 meters, instead of the current
2.000.
"We knew It was going to be close."
she said. "We were neck and neck
with Cal the whole way. and we really
wanted to win this race. As we got
near the finish line at the bridge, we
heard the crowd cheering, and then
the Band began playing. It was just a
surge of adrenaline, and we won.
"It's sad to think that I might be
finishing my rowing career. I'd like to
think I'm not going to."
Last week's victory over Cal was

Gawthrop's last race at Redwood
Shores. The Pacific Coasts and next
week's Collegiate National Champion
ships in Sacramento will be her final
collegiate races. Gawthrop, however,
is maintaining a positive attitude
about the races.
"She's not taking time to
reminisce," Davis said. "With most
people, whether they row one year or
four years, they miss crew a lot. I'm
sure she'll have a whole barrel full of
fond memories. Lynn just keeps
looking ahead to her next races and
how well she can do."
After the Collegiate Nationals,
Gawthrop will travel to Indianapolis
for the Open Nationals. At last year's
Open Nationals in New York,
Gawthrop and her partner finished
second behind Stanford teammates
Kristin Dahl and Hlldegard
Elmslander in the pairs competition.
"It's going to be really hard to leave
Stanford, especially the crew pro
gram." Gawthrop said. "It's basically
been my life here. It's especially the
people in the program because we
spend so much time with each other.
We have our own little world that can
only be experienced if you're a rower.
"And it's a pretty special little
world."

on the Stanford crew will provide her with a fond memory of a "pretty special little world."
