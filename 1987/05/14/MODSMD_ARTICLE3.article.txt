### STEPHEN KASIERSKI Senior staff writer 
The pomp and pageantry of today's Cor
nerstone Celebration is expected to draw
up to 10,000 people to campus this after
noon.
But before spectators even think about
finding a place to sit in the Inner Qaud,
the foreign ministers of the United States,
Canada and Mexico wilhbe-emrelutiing in
formal diplomatic talks at an unan
nounced campus location.
The meeting between Secretary of State
George Shultz, Canadian External Affairs
Secretary Joseph Clark and Mexican
Foreign Relations Secretary Bernardo
Sepulveda Amor is the first gathering of

North American foreign ministers in his
tory.
Although a formal agenda for the talks
has not been released, the ministers are
expected to discuss trilateral issues such
as international economics and trade.
Despite the unfamiliar venue, the
players should be well-acquainted with
each other. The Secretary of State and the
Canadian Foreign Secretary have what is
considered to be one of the closest
working relationships on the world
diplomatic front. The Stanford meeting
has been added to a regular schedule of
quarterly meetings between Shultz and
Clark.
State Department officials in Washing
ton have said little about any specific top

ics that will be discussed at the meeting.
Shultz has not issued a statement about
the meeting, and his Stanford visit was
not mentioned at the regular State De
partment press briefing yesterday.
Clark mentioned his upcoming meeting
with Shultz in a Monday speech to the
Canadian House of Commons, according
to Alan Unger, a spokesman at the
Canadian Consulate in San Francisco. In
his speech, Clark said he intended to
raise the issue of agricultural subsidies
with his American counterpart, Unger
said.
Trade is considered one of the most im
portant topics at a diplomatic meeting of
this type. Trade between the U.S. and
Canada, for example, is the largest
bilateral arrangement in the world, total

ing $114 billion last year. The two govern
ments hope to conclude by October a
major trade accord that would virtually
end all tariffs and other trade barriers be
tween the countries.
According to a Canadian foreign mini
stry source, Clark will probably raise
several issues that were also discussed by
President Reagan and Canadian Prime
Minister Brian Mulroney at an Ottawa
summit in April.
Likely topics include the status of the
proposed trade aggreement. acid rain,
and the sovereignty of disputed territory
in the Arctic. Clark may also reiterate
Canadian concerns about U.S. policy in
Central America, the source said.
Clark will also be holding a special
meeting with Canadian students Friday

morning.
Spokespersons at the Mexican Em
bassy In Washington said they have no
idea what issues Shultz's counterpart
from that country, Sepulveda, plans to
address at the Stanford summit.
Clark and Sepulveda are appearing at
the personal invitation of Shultz, who is
on leave as the Jack Steele Parker profes
sor of international economics at the
Graduate School of Business.
Shultz was appointed Secretary of State
by President Reagan in 1982, replacing
Alexander Haig. His current Cabinet post
follows a long career in the executive
branch of the Federal government.
President Richard Nixon named Shultz
as his secretary of labor in 1969 and sec
retary of the treasury in 1972.
