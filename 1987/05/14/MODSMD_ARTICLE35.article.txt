# The 						ceremonies this weekend celebrate the historic event that took place 100 years ago
## 
### MORTY POSNER 
Cornerstone Weekend 1987
will include a look back at
Stanford history and a
reconstruction of the original
cornerstone-laying ceremony of a
century ago.
History Prof. Emeritus H.
Donald Winbigler, former dean of
students and current president of
the Stanford Historical Society,
will reconstruct the original 1887
ceremony. History Prof. David
Kennedy will provide the histori
cal backdrop for the ceremony
with a lecture entitled "The Cathe
dral and the Farm: A Parable from
the Foundry."
Of course, the ceremony re
enaction will not be exactly like
the original ceremony. For one
thing, the campus now is well
developed, while in 1887 it was a
merely a set of blueprints and a
few blocks of sandstone.
On May 14, 1887, according to
Winbigler, there were no buildings
on the present Stanford campus
— only stakes and the foundation
for Building 60, which is the loca
tion of the cornerstone.
The ceremony was attended by
"some trustees and a few personal
friends ... in addition, the public
was Invited," Winbigler says. All
told, between 300 and 800 on
lookers were present, including
200 workmen who were "digging
and grading" and stopped their
work to watch.
Originally intended as a private
ceremony, neighboring farmers
and schoolchildren expressed an
interest in observing the event.
They came "by cart, by buggy or
on foot," Winbigler says.
One of the schoolchildren at the
ceremony, George Crothers. went
on to attend Stanford and study
law. He eventually became Jane
Stanford's lawyer; Crothers
Memorial Hall is named in his
honor.
The trustees arrived on the 8:30
a.m. Southern Pacific train from
San Francisco. Senator Stanford
met the trustees himself at the
Menlo Park station and took them

to his summer home on the Palo
Alto farm, also known as his
"country seat," Wlnbigler says.
The home, which has since been
razed. Is located where Stanford
Children's Hospital Is today.
The choir form the First Presby
terian church In Menlo Park sang
the song "Heirs, Unending Life" at
the ceremony. The present mem
bers of that choir will repeat that
performance at today's celebra
tion.
The date of the laying of the cor
nerstone — May 14 — is the
birthday of Leland Stanford Jr.
Leland Jr. died in 1884 while
traveling with his parents in
Europe. "Things moved much
more slowly In those days," Wln
bigler says, and the Stanfords did
not return to California with
Leland's body for more than eight
months.
In the interim, the Stanfords
stopped In Paris and New York de
veloping their Idea of building a
university in their son's honor.
They also visited with the presi
dents of Harvard, Yale, the Massa
chusetts Institute of Technology
and Cornell soliciting ideas for the
university.
Senator Stanford always
claimed that his son was the in
spiration for the University, al
though he once said that he
awoke from a dream while In
Florence with the idea that "the
children of California shall be our
children," Winblgler says.
After the recess following his
election to the U.S. Senate, Stan
ford returned to Palo Alto eager to
lay the cornerstone by May 14,
what would have been Leland's
19th birthday.
Winblgler, who has studied
some of Leland's letters, says that
the namesake of the University
was "philanthroplcally inclined.
"He was amazingly precocious.
Leland never went to public
school, he had tutors. His trips to
Europe were regarded as part of
his education.
"He had a very privileged exis
tence, but he made the best of it,"
Winblgler says.
