reflect the character of each institution

As Stanford anticipates Its 100 th year, it nears an occasion that is
richer In opportunity than any milestone in its past. The University's
Centennial is notable not merely because it occurs only once, but be
cause It comes at a unique point in time: We are young enough for
Stanford's founding objectives to remain familiar, yet mature enough
to have evolved the quality of wisdom we require to fulfill the needs of
a complex contemporary society.
â€” from the Stanford Centennial Celebration
Statement of Opportunity and Purposes
Cornerstone Weekend is the first of two gala celebrations of the
Stanford Centennial. Culminating in 1991, the 100 th anniver
sary of the opening of the University, the five-year string of
forums, speeches and parties promises to be a unique opportunity for
the public to see how Stanford puts on a show.
But organizers insist that Cornerstone Weekend is more than cere
mony. In attempting to balance the intellectual and entertainment
purposes of the occasion, the University Centennial also reflects how
Stanford views itself.
Cornerstone Weekend and other Centennial events have been de
signed to reflect the particular institutional character of Stanford and
the special importance of celebrating a 100 th anniversary, said Stephen
Peeps, executive director of the Centennial Celebration.
"A centennial is probably the most significant milestone in a univer
sity's history ... so you need to treat it differently," he said.
Centennial planners looked not only to past instances of Stanford
celebrations, such as the University's 50th anniversary celebration in
1941 and the yearly Commencement exercises, but also to other exam
ples of college spectaculars.
They looked east.
Harvard University marked the 350 th anniversary of its under
graduate college with a four-day affair last September. Stanford
planners attended the event to see firsthand how an Institution
renowned for pomp and pageantry staged its celebration.
Although generally impressed with the Harvard festivities. Peeps said
the differences between the two universities in location and approach
will be clearly reflected in the Stanford events.
"The key point is that we're different institutions celebrating different
milestones, and by definition, the character of the occasion will be dif
ferent," he said.
According to Peeps, Stanford is a "youthful institution," while Har
vard is "a grand, old institution" with a "heritage of alumni and alumni
connections that's very different than Stanford's."
The Harvard celebration had a major academic processional each of
the four days. "It was a wonderful, colorful display of all the ceremony
that you can bring to bear in an academic environment," Peeps said.
An estimated crowd of 16,000 filled Harvard's Tercentenary Theater
Sept. 4 to witness the Foundation Day ceremonies. After 40 minutes of
academic processions, songs, prayers and invocations, even Britain's
Prince Charles, a guest speaker, found a tongue-in-cheek way to
describe the pageantry.
