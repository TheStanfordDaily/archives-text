reflect the character of each institution

As Stanford anticipates Its 100 th year, it nears an occasion that is
richer In opportunity than any milestone in its past. The University's
Centennial is notable not merely because it occurs only once, but be
cause It comes at a unique point in time: We are young enough for
Stanford's founding objectives to remain familiar, yet mature enough
to have evolved the quality of wisdom we require to fulfill the needs of
a complex contemporary society.

Statement of Opportunity and Purposes
Cornerstone Weekend is the first of two gala celebrations of the
Stanford Centennial. Culminating in 1991, the 100 th anniver
sary of the opening of the University, the five-year string of
forums, speeches and parties promises to be a unique opportunity for
the public to see how Stanford puts on a show.
But organizers insist that Cornerstone Weekend is more than cere
mony. In attempting to balance the intellectual and entertainment
purposes of the occasion, the University Centennial also reflects how
Stanford views itself.
Cornerstone Weekend and other Centennial events have been de
signed to reflect the particular institutional character of Stanford and
the special importance of celebrating a 100 th anniversary, said Stephen
Peeps, executive director of the Centennial Celebration.
"A centennial is probably the most significant milestone in a univer
sity's history ... so you need to treat it differently," he said.
Centennial planners looked not only to past instances of Stanford
celebrations, such as the University's 50th anniversary celebration in
1941 and the yearly Commencement exercises, but also to other exam
ples of college spectaculars.
They looked east.
Harvard University marked the 350 th anniversary of its under
graduate college with a four-day affair last September. Stanford
planners attended the event to see firsthand how an Institution
renowned for pomp and pageantry staged its celebration.
Although generally impressed with the Harvard festivities. Peeps said
the differences between the two universities in location and approach
will be clearly reflected in the Stanford events.
"The key point is that we're different institutions celebrating different
milestones, and by definition, the character of the occasion will be dif
ferent," he said.
According to Peeps, Stanford is a "youthful institution," while Har
vard is "a grand, old institution" with a "heritage of alumni and alumni
connections that's very different than Stanford's."
The Harvard celebration had a major academic processional each of
the four days. "It was a wonderful, colorful display of all the ceremony
that you can bring to bear in an academic environment," Peeps said.
An estimated crowd of 16,000 filled Harvard's Tercentenary Theater
Sept. 4 to witness the Foundation Day ceremonies. After 40 minutes of
academic processions, songs, prayers and invocations, even Britain's
Prince Charles, a guest speaker, found a tongue-in-cheek way to
describe the pageantry.

The suspense of this mam
moth occasion has been killing
me. he told the crowd. "You've
devised an exquisite form of
torture
Stanford will try to replicate the
image that only a grand academic
ceremony can create while retain
ing the peculiar Stanford flavor
prominent at events such as Com
mencement
Cornerstone Weekend begins
this afternoon in the Inner Quad
with an academic procession of
University leaders faculty, distin
guished alumni special guests
and students
In addition to the colorful robes
of the procession the Quad area
will be dressed up with streamers
and banners designed by Art Prof.
Gregory Lynch, who also designed
the banners and stage used at
Commencement
'.'sing Memorial Church as an
artistic focal point. Lynch's design
includes hanging white banners
with the Centennial logo from its
arches The Quad will also be
enblazoned with hundreds of red
banners interspersed with olet
and yellow streamers
A school like Harvard that is
steeped in history can do that four
days in a row while keeping in
the spirit of the place, h ? said.
Stanford couldn't do th it four
days in a row and it wouldn't be
in keeping with spirit of the place.
We were founded in a different
way. at a different time, as a very
different kind of institution As
wonderful as Harvard's cere
mony was it would be an ill
match with Stanford if that was
what we were trying to do the
entire time
Celebrating a milestone such as
a centennial, bicentennial or
tricentennial should probably be
considered a more "weighty" occa
sion than Harvard's 350 th was
meant to be. Peeps said
I think the 350 th was really
meant to be a birthday party for
the family, he said "And the fam
ily was primarily the alumni."
.Although the Harvard celebra
tion was planned primarily as a
family affair, the family included
faculty, students, staff and neigh
bors as well as alumni, said Step
hen Stephenson, general secre
tary of the Harvard 350 th commit
tee.
But the only 350 th event free
and open to the general commu
nity was a celebrated "Floating
Birthday Party" on the Charles
River. Marred by drizzle, partiers
could nonetheless marvel at the
extravaganza, which included a
600-foot rainbow arch, a 23-piece
women's samba band and a laser
light show on a 50-foot screen of
water.
The Harvard 350 th was first
conceived as a "balance between
the intellectual and the celebra
tion," Stephenson said. In 1980,
Harvard President Derek Bok es
tablished a university-wide 350 th
planning committee under the
leadership of the executive direc
tor of the Harvard Alumni Associa
tion.
By 1982, the Harvard Overseers
had approved broad goals pro
posed by the committee for the oc
cassion, Stephenson said, includ
ing a desire to have the celebra

tion be a university-wide affair
even though the date specifically
marks the founding of Harvard
College.
But even calling an event a
"celebration" can affect the atti
tude of both the planners and the
participants.
"'One of the big problems we
have with the term 'celebration' is
that it tends to mean one thing to
people here — having a big party,"
Peeps said.
According to Stephenson, the
Harvard celebration was designed
to have a wide appeal. "We
deliberately planned a 'smorgas
bord' of both the intellectual and
the entertainment," he said.
"People could (then) choose what
they wanted."
The Centennial Committee
decided early on that the Stanford
event would also celebrate the Uni
versity academic community and
intellectual life, Peeps said.
The entire Stanford community
has been invited to attend a series
of forums and discussions that
have a futuristic focus. Friday's of
ferings include panel discussions
on "The University and the 21st
Century" and a series on the

relationships between the Ameri
can West and education, politics
and the economy.
On Saturday two panels will dis
cuss the press and the public. All
of the panel discussions are free
and open to the public.
The Harvard event featured 106
symposiums on a wide variety of
topics reflecting on the events of
the past as well as the issues of the
future, Stephenson said.
Harvard required advance
reservations and small admission
fees to attend most of the 350 th
events. Despite this requirement,
all of the events were either sold
out or oversubscribed, he said.
According to Peeps, the partici
pation of students and faculty is
integral to the success of Corner
stone Weekend.
"It was very important that
Stanford faculty and students be
intimately involved in whatever
Centennial celebrations there
were." he said. "Harvard certainly
involved their faculty, (but) we'll
try to involve our faculty and stu
dents a little differently."
Harvard's Foundation Day hap
pens to fall on Sept. 4, two weeks
before the beginning of the regu
lar academic year. Although
celebrating the event on the day it
occurred was understandable.
Peeps said the "downside" of the
timing was that many faculty and
a majority of students were not
going to be in the area to partici
pate in the celebration.
"The effect was that the audi
ence for the 350 th was pre
dominantly an alumna audience,"
he said.
However. Peeps said Centennial
organizers considered Corner
stone Weekend falling within the
Stanford academic calendar "both
a blessing and a curse."
"In many ways, it makes us
work around the existence of stu
dents, faculty and a regular aca
demic program. Strictly from a
planners point of view, there is
some deliciousness in thinking of
putting on an event when the
dorms are empty, the Quad is
clear and space is not an issue."
But Centennial planners
quickly recognized the advantages
of having the event while the Uni
versity is in session. Peeps said.
"Given as young an institution
as we are and the significance of
the Centennial, it would be critical
to expand the definition of the au
dience." he said.
Stephenson said he didn't con
sider the timing of the 350 th
celebration a problem "in any
serious sense" because Harvard
needed almost all of its residential
houses available to accommodate
returning alumni.
"I suppose there were some dis
appointed (undergraduates), but
we simply couldn't accomodate
them," he said.
After realizing some students
would regret missing the fes
tivities, Harvard sponsored a spe
cial celebration for residents of
Harvard College in October. The
celebration culminated in a gala
350 th Ball, a black-tie affair atten
ded by 4,000 undergraduates.

The unique historical position
of Harvard as a leading educa
tional institution meant that the
Harvard 350 th would necessarily
be a subject of intense public in
terest, Peeps said.
"They knew that they were
going to be paid attention to in a
different way than we were. Being
Harvard, they couldn't avoid the
fact that the national media, par
ticularly the Eastern media, would
want something special made of
the 350 th, even if Harvard didn't."
Stephenson admitted the Har
vard 350 th "got more attention
from the media" than organizers
anticipated, but that "95 percent"
of it was positive.
"We did our very best to convey a
feeling of modesty," he said.
Despite concerns that the 350 th
may have soured under a heavy
dose of grandeur, the convoca
tions and the final ceremony in
Harvard Stadium were widely ac
claimed, said Harvard sophomore
Brooke Masters, who helped cover
the 350 th for the Crimson, the
Harvard student newspaper.
"Everybody was afraid it would
be too glitzy, but it turned out to
be wonderful," she said.

As Stanford anticipates Its 100 th year, it nears an occasion that is
richer In opportunity than any milestone in its past. The University's
Centennial is notable not merely because it occurs only once, but be

— from the Stanford Centennial Celebration
Statement of Opportunity and Purposes
Cornerstone Weekend is the first of two gala celebrations of the
Stanford Centennial. Culminating in 1991, the 100 th anniver
sary of the opening of the University, the five-year string of
forums, speeches and parties promises to be a unique opportunity for
the public to see how Stanford puts on a show.
But organizers insist that Cornerstone Weekend is more than cere
mony. In attempting to balance the intellectual and entertainment
purposes of the occasion, the University Centennial also reflects how
Stanford views itself.
Cornerstone Weekend and other Centennial events have been de
signed to reflect the particular institutional character of Stanford and
the special importance of celebrating a 100 th anniversary, said Stephen
Peeps, executive director of the Centennial Celebration.
"A centennial is probably the most significant milestone in a univer
sity's history ... so you need to treat it differently," he said.
Centennial planners looked not only to past instances of Stanford
celebrations, such as the University's 50th anniversary celebration in
1941 and the yearly Commencement exercises, but also to other exam
ples of college spectaculars.
They looked east.
Harvard University marked the 350 th anniversary of its under
graduate college with a four-day affair last September. Stanford
planners attended the event to see firsthand how an Institution
renowned for pomp and pageantry staged its celebration.
Although generally impressed with the Harvard festivities. Peeps said
the differences between the two universities in location and approach
will be clearly reflected in the Stanford events.
"The key point is that we're different institutions celebrating different
milestones, and by definition, the character of the occasion will be dif
ferent," he said.
According to Peeps, Stanford is a "youthful institution," while Har
vard is "a grand, old institution" with a "heritage of alumni and alumni
connections that's very different than Stanford's."
The Harvard celebration had a major academic processional each of
the four days. "It was a wonderful, colorful display of all the ceremony
that you can bring to bear in an academic environment," Peeps said.
An estimated crowd of 16,000 filled Harvard's Tercentenary Theater
Sept. 4 to witness the Foundation Day ceremonies. After 40 minutes of
academic processions, songs, prayers and invocations, even Britain's
Prince Charles, a guest speaker, found a tongue-in-cheek way to
describe the pageantry.

The suspense of this mam
moth occasion has been killing
me. he told the crowd. "You've
devised an exquisite form of
torture
Stanford will try to replicate the
image that only a grand academic
ceremony can create while retain
ing the peculiar Stanford flavor
prominent at events such as Com
mencement
Cornerstone Weekend begins
this afternoon in the Inner Quad
with an academic procession of
University leaders faculty, distin
guished alumni special guests
and students
In addition to the colorful robes
of the procession the Quad area
will be dressed up with streamers
and banners designed by Art Prof.
Gregory Lynch, who also designed
the banners and stage used at
Commencement
'.'sing Memorial Church as an
artistic focal point. Lynch's design
includes hanging white banners
with the Centennial logo from its
arches The Quad will also be
enblazoned with hundreds of red
banners interspersed with olet
and yellow streamers
A school like Harvard that is
steeped in history can do that four
days in a row while keeping in
the spirit of the place, h ? said.
Stanford couldn't do th it four
days in a row and it wouldn't be
in keeping with spirit of the place.
We were founded in a different
way. at a different time, as a very
different kind of institution As
wonderful as Harvard's cere
mony was it would be an ill
match with Stanford if that was
what we were trying to do the
entire time
Celebrating a milestone such as
a centennial, bicentennial or
tricentennial should probably be
considered a more "weighty" occa
sion than Harvard's 350 th was
meant to be. Peeps said
I think the 350 th was really
meant to be a birthday party for
the family, he said "And the fam
ily was primarily the alumni."
.Although the Harvard celebra
tion was planned primarily as a
family affair, the family included
faculty, students, staff and neigh
bors as well as alumni, said Step
hen Stephenson, general secre
tary of the Harvard 350 th commit
tee.
But the only 350 th event free
and open to the general commu
nity was a celebrated "Floating
Birthday Party" on the Charles
River. Marred by drizzle, partiers
could nonetheless marvel at the
extravaganza, which included a
600-foot rainbow arch, a 23-piece
women's samba band and a laser
light show on a 50-foot screen of
water.
The Harvard 350 th was first
conceived as a "balance between
the intellectual and the celebra
tion," Stephenson said. In 1980,
Harvard President Derek Bok es
tablished a university-wide 350 th
planning committee under the
leadership of the executive direc
tor of the Harvard Alumni Associa
tion.
By 1982, the Harvard Overseers
had approved broad goals pro
posed by the committee for the oc
cassion, Stephenson said, includ
ing a desire to have the celebra

tion be a university-wide affair
even though the date specifically
marks the founding of Harvard
College.
But even calling an event a
"celebration" can affect the atti
tude of both the planners and the
participants.
"'One of the big problems we
have with the term 'celebration' is
that it tends to mean one thing to
people here — having a big party,"
Peeps said.
According to Stephenson, the
Harvard celebration was designed
to have a wide appeal. "We
deliberately planned a 'smorgas
bord' of both the intellectual and
the entertainment," he said.
"People could (then) choose what
they wanted."
The Centennial Committee
decided early on that the Stanford
event would also celebrate the Uni
versity academic community and
intellectual life, Peeps said.
The entire Stanford community
has been invited to attend a series
of forums and discussions that
have a futuristic focus. Friday's of
ferings include panel discussions
on "The University and the 21st
Century" and a series on the

relationships between the Ameri
can West and education, politics
and the economy.
On Saturday two panels will dis
cuss the press and the public. All
of the panel discussions are free
and open to the public.
The Harvard event featured 106
symposiums on a wide variety of
topics reflecting on the events of
the past as well as the issues of the
future, Stephenson said.
Harvard required advance
reservations and small admission
fees to attend most of the 350 th
events. Despite this requirement,
all of the events were either sold
out or oversubscribed, he said.
According to Peeps, the partici
pation of students and faculty is
integral to the success of Corner
stone Weekend.
"It was very important that
Stanford faculty and students be
intimately involved in whatever
Centennial celebrations there
were." he said. "Harvard certainly
involved their faculty, (but) we'll
try to involve our faculty and stu
dents a little differently."
Harvard's Foundation Day hap
pens to fall on Sept. 4, two weeks
before the beginning of the regu
lar academic year. Although
celebrating the event on the day it
occurred was understandable.
Peeps said the "downside" of the
timing was that many faculty and
a majority of students were not
going to be in the area to partici
pate in the celebration.
"The effect was that the audi
ence for the 350 th was pre
dominantly an alumna audience,"
he said.
However. Peeps said Centennial
organizers considered Corner
stone Weekend falling within the
Stanford academic calendar "both
a blessing and a curse."
"In many ways, it makes us
work around the existence of stu
dents, faculty and a regular aca
demic program. Strictly from a
planners point of view, there is
some deliciousness in thinking of
putting on an event when the
dorms are empty, the Quad is
clear and space is not an issue."
But Centennial planners
quickly recognized the advantages
of having the event while the Uni
versity is in session. Peeps said.
"Given as young an institution
as we are and the significance of
the Centennial, it would be critical
to expand the definition of the au
dience." he said.
Stephenson said he didn't con
sider the timing of the 350 th
celebration a problem "in any
serious sense" because Harvard
needed almost all of its residential
houses available to accommodate
returning alumni.
"I suppose there were some dis
appointed (undergraduates), but
we simply couldn't accomodate
them," he said.
After realizing some students
would regret missing the fes
tivities, Harvard sponsored a spe
cial celebration for residents of
Harvard College in October. The
celebration culminated in a gala
350 th Ball, a black-tie affair atten
ded by 4,000 undergraduates.

The unique historical position
of Harvard as a leading educa
tional institution meant that the
Harvard 350 th would necessarily
be a subject of intense public in
terest, Peeps said.
"They knew that they were
going to be paid attention to in a
different way than we were. Being
Harvard, they couldn't avoid the
fact that the national media, par
ticularly the Eastern media, would
want something special made of
the 350 th, even if Harvard didn't."
Stephenson admitted the Har
vard 350 th "got more attention
from the media" than organizers
anticipated, but that "95 percent"
of it was positive.
"We did our very best to convey a
feeling of modesty," he said.

reflect the character of each institution

As Stanford anticipates Its 100 th year, it nears an occasion that is
richer In opportunity than any milestone in its past. The University's
Centennial is notable not merely because it occurs only once, but be
cause It comes at a unique point in time: We are young enough for
Stanford's founding objectives to remain familiar, yet mature enough
to have evolved the quality of wisdom we require to fulfill the needs of
a complex contemporary society.
— from the Stanford Centennial Celebration
Statement of Opportunity and Purposes
Cornerstone Weekend is the first of two gala celebrations of the
Stanford Centennial. Culminating in 1991, the 100 th anniver
sary of the opening of the University, the five-year string of
forums, speeches and parties promises to be a unique opportunity for
the public to see how Stanford puts on a show.
But organizers insist that Cornerstone Weekend is more than cere
mony. In attempting to balance the intellectual and entertainment
purposes of the occasion, the University Centennial also reflects how
Stanford views itself.
Cornerstone Weekend and other Centennial events have been de
signed to reflect the particular institutional character of Stanford and
the special importance of celebrating a 100 th anniversary, said Stephen
Peeps, executive director of the Centennial Celebration.
"A centennial is probably the most significant milestone in a univer
sity's history ... so you need to treat it differently," he said.
Centennial planners looked not only to past instances of Stanford
celebrations, such as the University's 50th anniversary celebration in
1941 and the yearly Commencement exercises, but also to other exam
ples of college spectaculars.
They looked east.
Harvard University marked the 350 th anniversary of its under
graduate college with a four-day affair last September. Stanford
planners attended the event to see firsthand how an Institution
renowned for pomp and pageantry staged its celebration.
Although generally impressed with the Harvard festivities. Peeps said
the differences between the two universities in location and approach
will be clearly reflected in the Stanford events.
"The key point is that we're different institutions celebrating different
milestones, and by definition, the character of the occasion will be dif
ferent," he said.
According to Peeps, Stanford is a "youthful institution," while Har
vard is "a grand, old institution" with a "heritage of alumni and alumni
connections that's very different than Stanford's."
The Harvard celebration had a major academic processional each of
the four days. "It was a wonderful, colorful display of all the ceremony
that you can bring to bear in an academic environment," Peeps said.
An estimated crowd of 16,000 filled Harvard's Tercentenary Theater
Sept. 4 to witness the Foundation Day ceremonies. After 40 minutes of
academic processions, songs, prayers and invocations, even Britain's
Prince Charles, a guest speaker, found a tongue-in-cheek way to
describe the pageantry.

The suspense of this mam
moth occasion has been killing
me. he told the crowd. "You've
devised an exquisite form of
torture
Stanford will try to replicate the
image that only a grand academic
ceremony can create while retain
ing the peculiar Stanford flavor
prominent at events such as Com
mencement
Cornerstone Weekend begins
this afternoon in the Inner Quad
with an academic procession of
University leaders faculty, distin
guished alumni special guests
and students
In addition to the colorful robes
of the procession the Quad area
will be dressed up with streamers
and banners designed by Art Prof.
Gregory Lynch, who also designed
the banners and stage used at
Commencement
'.'sing Memorial Church as an
artistic focal point. Lynch's design
includes hanging white banners
with the Centennial logo from its
arches The Quad will also be
enblazoned with hundreds of red
banners interspersed with olet
and yellow streamers
A school like Harvard that is
steeped in history can do that four
days in a row while keeping in
the spirit of the place, h ? said.
Stanford couldn't do th it four
days in a row and it wouldn't be
in keeping with spirit of the place.
We were founded in a different
way. at a different time, as a very
different kind of institution As
wonderful as Harvard's cere
mony was it would be an ill
match with Stanford if that was
what we were trying to do the
entire time
Celebrating a milestone such as
a centennial, bicentennial or
tricentennial should probably be
considered a more "weighty" occa
sion than Harvard's 350 th was
meant to be. Peeps said
I think the 350 th was really
meant to be a birthday party for
the family, he said "And the fam
ily was primarily the alumni."
.Although the Harvard celebra
tion was planned primarily as a
family affair, the family included
faculty, students, staff and neigh
bors as well as alumni, said Step
hen Stephenson, general secre
tary of the Harvard 350 th commit
tee.
But the only 350 th event free
and open to the general commu
nity was a celebrated "Floating
Birthday Party" on the Charles
River. Marred by drizzle, partiers
could nonetheless marvel at the
extravaganza, which included a
600-foot rainbow arch, a 23-piece
women's samba band and a laser
light show on a 50-foot screen of
water.
The Harvard 350 th was first
conceived as a "balance between
the intellectual and the celebra
tion," Stephenson said. In 1980,
Harvard President Derek Bok es
tablished a university-wide 350 th
planning committee under the
leadership of the executive direc
tor of the Harvard Alumni Associa
tion.
By 1982, the Harvard Overseers
had approved broad goals pro
posed by the committee for the oc
cassion, Stephenson said, includ
ing a desire to have the celebra

tion be a university-wide affair
even though the date specifically
marks the founding of Harvard
College.
But even calling an event a
"celebration" can affect the atti
tude of both the planners and the
participants.
"'One of the big problems we
have with the term 'celebration' is
that it tends to mean one thing to
people here — having a big party,"
Peeps said.
According to Stephenson, the
Harvard celebration was designed
to have a wide appeal. "We
deliberately planned a 'smorgas
bord' of both the intellectual and
the entertainment," he said.
"People could (then) choose what
they wanted."
The Centennial Committee
decided early on that the Stanford
event would also celebrate the Uni
versity academic community and
intellectual life, Peeps said.
The entire Stanford community
has been invited to attend a series
of forums and discussions that
have a futuristic focus. Friday's of
ferings include panel discussions
on "The University and the 21st
Century" and a series on the

relationships between the Ameri
can West and education, politics
and the economy.
On Saturday two panels will dis
cuss the press and the public. All
of the panel discussions are free
and open to the public.
The Harvard event featured 106
symposiums on a wide variety of
topics reflecting on the events of
the past as well as the issues of the
future, Stephenson said.
Harvard required advance
reservations and small admission
fees to attend most of the 350 th
events. Despite this requirement,
all of the events were either sold
out or oversubscribed, he said.
According to Peeps, the partici
pation of students and faculty is
integral to the success of Corner
stone Weekend.
"It was very important that
Stanford faculty and students be
intimately involved in whatever
Centennial celebrations there
were." he said. "Harvard certainly
involved their faculty, (but) we'll
try to involve our faculty and stu
dents a little differently."
Harvard's Foundation Day hap
pens to fall on Sept. 4, two weeks
before the beginning of the regu
lar academic year. Although
celebrating the event on the day it
occurred was understandable.
Peeps said the "downside" of the
timing was that many faculty and
a majority of students were not
going to be in the area to partici
pate in the celebration.
"The effect was that the audi
ence for the 350 th was pre
dominantly an alumna audience,"
he said.
However. Peeps said Centennial
organizers considered Corner
stone Weekend falling within the
Stanford academic calendar "both
a blessing and a curse."
"In many ways, it makes us
work around the existence of stu
dents, faculty and a regular aca
demic program. Strictly from a
planners point of view, there is
some deliciousness in thinking of
putting on an event when the
dorms are empty, the Quad is
clear and space is not an issue."
But Centennial planners
quickly recognized the advantages
of having the event while the Uni
versity is in session. Peeps said.
"Given as young an institution
as we are and the significance of
the Centennial, it would be critical
to expand the definition of the au
dience." he said.
Stephenson said he didn't con
sider the timing of the 350 th
celebration a problem "in any
serious sense" because Harvard
needed almost all of its residential
houses available to accommodate
returning alumni.
"I suppose there were some dis
appointed (undergraduates), but
we simply couldn't accomodate
them," he said.
After realizing some students
would regret missing the fes
tivities, Harvard sponsored a spe
cial celebration for residents of
Harvard College in October. The
celebration culminated in a gala
350 th Ball, a black-tie affair atten
ded by 4,000 undergraduates.

The unique historical position
of Harvard as a leading educa
tional institution meant that the
Harvard 350 th would necessarily
be a subject of intense public in
terest, Peeps said.
"They knew that they were
going to be paid attention to in a
different way than we were. Being
Harvard, they couldn't avoid the
fact that the national media, par
ticularly the Eastern media, would
want something special made of
the 350 th, even if Harvard didn't."
Stephenson admitted the Har
vard 350 th "got more attention
from the media" than organizers
anticipated, but that "95 percent"
of it was positive.
"We did our very best to convey a
feeling of modesty," he said.
Despite concerns that the 350 th
may have soured under a heavy
dose of grandeur, the convoca
tions and the final ceremony in
Harvard Stadium were widely ac
claimed, said Harvard sophomore
Brooke Masters, who helped cover
the 350 th for the Crimson, the
Harvard student newspaper.
