Recently, the University has spilled gallons of ink
in sketching a portrait oj the greatest university In
the American West. But the transition from race
horses and their pastures to scholars and their li
braries has not been as smooth and regular as
Stanford would have its dazzled audience believe.
Although the University will not be calling attention
to the following blemishes, they, like Stern Hall
and Manzanita Park, are as much a part of Stan
ford as Nobel Prizes and Jordan Scholars.
Central to maintenance of a university's reputa
tion is academic freedom â€” the freedom of its
scholars to study what they want and reach
whatever conclusions they feel are Justified.
Stanford's first, but not last, difficulty with this
tenet was in 1900, when Prof. Edward Ross was
forced to resign for publicly expounding beliefs that
offended Jane Stanford, the wife of then-deceased
Leland Stanford.
Ross, appointed professor of economic theory and
finance in 1893, was then hailed by Stanford Presi
dent David Starr Jordan as the "most effective"
American scholar in his field and "one of the ablest,
most virile and clear classroom lecturers" he had ever
known.
But Ross upset Mrs. Stanford once too often.
First, in 1896, Ross wrote a series of articles advo
cating free coinage of silver to increase the U.S. cur
rency supply and end the nation's economic depres
sion. The articles were reprinted by the Democratic
National Convention and distributed as campaign
literature.
According to Jordan's biographer, Mrs. Stanford
felt Ross "had violated a cherished principle of her
husband that the University should never be dragged
into partisan political activity."
With Stanford enduring tough times financially.
Jordan's biographer believes the president felt that
"the future progress, and perhaps the very existence,
of the University depended upon the good will of Mrs.
Stanford."
To appease her, President Jordan reappointed
Ross with the provision that he resign in August
1897 if it were deemed to be in the University's inter
est. The deadline passed, though, and Ross stayed
on.

Although University co-founders Leland (right) and
Jane Stanford (left) and alum Herbert Hoover
(center) are probably the three most distinguished
figures in the University's 100-year history, each of
the three was involved in incidents that are now re
garded with some embarrassment by Stanfordites.
