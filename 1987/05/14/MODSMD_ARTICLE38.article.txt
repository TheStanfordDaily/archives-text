Recently, the University has spilled gallons of ink
in sketching a portrait oj the greatest university In
the American West. But the transition from race
horses and their pastures to scholars and their li
braries has not been as smooth and regular as
Stanford would have its dazzled audience believe.
Although the University will not be calling attention
to the following blemishes, they, like Stern Hall
and Manzanita Park, are as much a part of Stan
ford as Nobel Prizes and Jordan Scholars.
Central to maintenance of a university's reputa
tion is academic freedom — the freedom of its
scholars to study what they want and reach
whatever conclusions they feel are Justified.
Stanford's first, but not last, difficulty with this
tenet was in 1900, when Prof. Edward Ross was
forced to resign for publicly expounding beliefs that
offended Jane Stanford, the wife of then-deceased
Leland Stanford.
Ross, appointed professor of economic theory and
finance in 1893, was then hailed by Stanford Presi
dent David Starr Jordan as the "most effective"
American scholar in his field and "one of the ablest,
most virile and clear classroom lecturers" he had ever
known.
But Ross upset Mrs. Stanford once too often.
First, in 1896, Ross wrote a series of articles advo
cating free coinage of silver to increase the U.S. cur
rency supply and end the nation's economic depres
sion. The articles were reprinted by the Democratic
National Convention and distributed as campaign
literature.
According to Jordan's biographer, Mrs. Stanford
felt Ross "had violated a cherished principle of her
husband that the University should never be dragged
into partisan political activity."
With Stanford enduring tough times financially.
Jordan's biographer believes the president felt that
"the future progress, and perhaps the very existence,
of the University depended upon the good will of Mrs.
Stanford."
To appease her, President Jordan reappointed
Ross with the provision that he resign in August
1897 if it were deemed to be in the University's inter
est. The deadline passed, though, and Ross stayed
on.

Although University co-founders Leland (right) and
Jane Stanford (left) and alum Herbert Hoover
(center) are probably the three most distinguished
figures in the University's 100-year history, each of
the three was involved in incidents that are now re
garded with some embarrassment by Stanfordites.
Ross again aggravated Mrs.
Stanford when he spoke to the
Socialist Club of Oakland, but the
climax came in 1900 when Ross
told a San Francisco audience
that he opposed unrestricted
Oriental immigration.
According to The Daily Palo Alto
(later to become The Stanford
Daily), Ross argued that "the
coolie, though he cannot outdo
the American, can underlive
him. ... If Orientals are allowed
in this country before they have
raised their standard of living . . .
California might easily experience
the same famines as India and
China."
By November of 1900, Mrs.
Stanford had prevailed, and Jor
dan, who had absolute power to
remove faculty members, forced
Ross to resign.
Several faculty members re
signed in protest, hostile letters
were written to local newspapers
and a San Francisco alumni group
demanded an investigation.
The response of the student
newspaper: "Out of respect to Mrs.
Stanford and her wishes they (the
alumni) could do far more good by
acquiescing to her action and that
of Dr. Jordan by letting any plans
for an investigation drop."
Matters of academic freedom
arose again in March
1960, when The Daily
revealed the purpose of the newly
established Hoover Institution:
"by its research and publications,
to demonstrate the evils of the
doctrines of Karl Marx."
The statement, quietly approved
by the Stanford Board of Trustees
in 1959, was contained in the
charter that converted the Hoover
Library into the Hoover Institu
tion — a "think tank."
The changes were originally pro
posed by Herbert Hoover, who had
been a trustee for decades and was
the University's most famous
alumnus.
The faculty cried out.
"The trustees last May took an
action of which they were appar
ently so ashamed that it was kept
secret even from persons in the
administration . . . (and of course
from the faculty)," wrote Assoc.
Prof. David Nivison in one of many
angry faculty responses printed in
The Daily. "We should see to it
that Mr. Hoover's statement of
purpose is explicity repudiated,"
Nivison said.
But W. Glenn Campbell, then
the institution's newly appointed
director, responded in a charac
teristic manner that still ex
acerbates Hoover-related contro
versy today. "I see nothing wrong
with it, do you?" he asked a Daily
reporter in an interview. "There
are evils in Marxism, and I hope
we expose them."
The issue withered after the
trustees refused to replace the
statement with one on academic
freedom prepared by an ad hoc
committee of the full faculty.
More spectacular, but of less
academic consequence,
was a gruesome 1933 mur
der of Allene Thorpe Lamson,
class of 1926, by her husband
David, '25.
The couple, married in
Memorial Church in 1928, "had
been prominent as undergradu
ates," according to The Daily.
Mrs. Lamson was a member of
Delta Delta Delta sorority and the
Cap and Gown honor society and
served as women's editor of The
Daily. Mr. Lamson had been a
member of Alpha Sigma Phi fra
ternity and edited the Stanford
Chaparral. At the time of the mur
der, he worked as a sales manager
for the Stanford University Press.
On the morning of Tuesday,
May 30, Mrs. Lamson was found
sitting in a blood-filled bathtub at
the couple's home on Salvatierra

Street, one block north of Mayfield
Avenue.
According to The Daily, the only
wound on her body was "a deep
gash in the back of the head,
claimed by doctors to have been
caused by a large, blunt instru
ment."
Mr. Lamson admitted to the
murder during his trial in the
summer of 1933. but pleaded tem
porary insanity as his defense.
The jury found him guilty and
sentenced him to death.
But while on death row, Lamson
wrote a book about the feelings of
a death row inmate. "For We Who
Are About to Die" caused a stir,
and several years later, Lamson
was given a new trial.
This time, the trial resulted in a
hung jury. Lamson. now free,
moved to a ranch in the Sierra
foothills, where he lived until his
death in 1954.
But perhaps the best-known
member of Stanford's Hall of
Infamy is the founder him
self. Leland Stanford.
Yes, the millions used to build
and fund the University in its
early years were acquired through

graft and corruption. (Ironically,
Stanford's gift might not be ac
cepted were It offered today; the
University trustees' guidelines on
giving stipulate that gifts must
have been obtained by legal
means.)
The bulk of the Stanford's
fortune came from his involve
ment with the Southern Pacific
Railroad, of which he was presi
dent.
Stanford and three others or
ganized the railroad in 1861, but
initially had difficulty raising
money for what was to become the
western portion of America's
transcontinental railroad. After
tapping federal, state and local
governments along the route, they
were swimming in money - none
of it their own.
According to the 1934 book
"The Robber Barons," Stanford
and his cohorts raised about *79
million from government sources
and investors to build the rail
road. "Of this sum, experts later
estimated that upward of *36 mil
lion was in excess of a reasonable
cost of the affair, and was lost en
tirely, that is, 'lost' to the same
principals [Stanford, et al]."

and his cohorts raised about *79
million from government sources
and investors to build the rail
road. "Of this sum, experts later
estimated that upward of *36 mil
lion was in excess of a reasonable
cost of the affair, and was lost en
tirely, that is, 'lost' to the same
principals [Stanford, et al]."
Recently, the University has spilled gallons of ink
in sketching a portrait oj the greatest university In
the American West. But the transition from race
horses and their pastures to scholars and their li
braries has not been as smooth and regular as
Stanford would have its dazzled audience believe.
Although the University will not be calling attention
to the following blemishes, they, like Stern Hall
and Manzanita Park, are as much a part of Stan
ford as Nobel Prizes and Jordan Scholars.
Central to maintenance of a university's reputa
tion is academic freedom — the freedom of its
scholars to study what they want and reach
whatever conclusions they feel are Justified.
Stanford's first, but not last, difficulty with this
tenet was in 1900, when Prof. Edward Ross was
forced to resign for publicly expounding beliefs that
offended Jane Stanford, the wife of then-deceased
Leland Stanford.
Ross, appointed professor of economic theory and
finance in 1893, was then hailed by Stanford Presi
dent David Starr Jordan as the "most effective"
American scholar in his field and "one of the ablest,
most virile and clear classroom lecturers" he had ever
known.
But Ross upset Mrs. Stanford once too often.
First, in 1896, Ross wrote a series of articles advo
cating free coinage of silver to increase the U.S. cur
rency supply and end the nation's economic depres
sion. The articles were reprinted by the Democratic
National Convention and distributed as campaign
literature.
According to Jordan's biographer, Mrs. Stanford
felt Ross "had violated a cherished principle of her
husband that the University should never be dragged
into partisan political activity."
With Stanford enduring tough times financially.
Jordan's biographer believes the president felt that
"the future progress, and perhaps the very existence,
of the University depended upon the good will of Mrs.
Stanford."
To appease her, President Jordan reappointed
Ross with the provision that he resign in August
1897 if it were deemed to be in the University's inter
est. The deadline passed, though, and Ross stayed
on.

Although University co-founders Leland (right) and
Jane Stanford (left) and alum Herbert Hoover
(center) are probably the three most distinguished
figures in the University's 100-year history, each of
the three was involved in incidents that are now re
garded with some embarrassment by Stanfordites.
Ross again aggravated Mrs.
Stanford when he spoke to the
Socialist Club of Oakland, but the
climax came in 1900 when Ross
told a San Francisco audience
that he opposed unrestricted
Oriental immigration.
According to The Daily Palo Alto
(later to become The Stanford
Daily), Ross argued that "the
coolie, though he cannot outdo
the American, can underlive
him. ... If Orientals are allowed
in this country before they have
raised their standard of living . . .
California might easily experience
the same famines as India and
China."
By November of 1900, Mrs.
Stanford had prevailed, and Jor
dan, who had absolute power to
remove faculty members, forced
Ross to resign.
Several faculty members re
signed in protest, hostile letters
were written to local newspapers
and a San Francisco alumni group
demanded an investigation.
The response of the student
newspaper: "Out of respect to Mrs.
Stanford and her wishes they (the
alumni) could do far more good by
acquiescing to her action and that
of Dr. Jordan by letting any plans
for an investigation drop."
Matters of academic freedom
arose again in March
1960, when The Daily
revealed the purpose of the newly
established Hoover Institution:
"by its research and publications,
to demonstrate the evils of the
doctrines of Karl Marx."
The statement, quietly approved
by the Stanford Board of Trustees
in 1959, was contained in the
charter that converted the Hoover
Library into the Hoover Institu
tion — a "think tank."
The changes were originally pro
posed by Herbert Hoover, who had
been a trustee for decades and was
the University's most famous
alumnus.
The faculty cried out.
"The trustees last May took an
action of which they were appar
ently so ashamed that it was kept
secret even from persons in the
administration . . . (and of course
from the faculty)," wrote Assoc.
Prof. David Nivison in one of many
angry faculty responses printed in
The Daily. "We should see to it
that Mr. Hoover's statement of
purpose is explicity repudiated,"
Nivison said.
But W. Glenn Campbell, then
the institution's newly appointed
director, responded in a charac
teristic manner that still ex
acerbates Hoover-related contro
versy today. "I see nothing wrong
with it, do you?" he asked a Daily
reporter in an interview. "There
are evils in Marxism, and I hope
we expose them."
The issue withered after the
trustees refused to replace the
statement with one on academic
freedom prepared by an ad hoc
committee of the full faculty.
More spectacular, but of less
academic consequence,
was a gruesome 1933 mur
der of Allene Thorpe Lamson,
class of 1926, by her husband
David, '25.
The couple, married in
Memorial Church in 1928, "had
been prominent as undergradu
ates," according to The Daily.
Mrs. Lamson was a member of
Delta Delta Delta sorority and the
Cap and Gown honor society and
served as women's editor of The
Daily. Mr. Lamson had been a
member of Alpha Sigma Phi fra
ternity and edited the Stanford
Chaparral. At the time of the mur
der, he worked as a sales manager
for the Stanford University Press.
On the morning of Tuesday,
May 30, Mrs. Lamson was found
sitting in a blood-filled bathtub at
the couple's home on Salvatierra

Street, one block north of Mayfield
Avenue.
According to The Daily, the only
wound on her body was "a deep
gash in the back of the head,
claimed by doctors to have been
caused by a large, blunt instru
ment."
Mr. Lamson admitted to the
murder during his trial in the
summer of 1933. but pleaded tem
porary insanity as his defense.
The jury found him guilty and
sentenced him to death.
But while on death row, Lamson
wrote a book about the feelings of
a death row inmate. "For We Who
Are About to Die" caused a stir,
and several years later, Lamson
was given a new trial.
This time, the trial resulted in a
hung jury. Lamson. now free,
moved to a ranch in the Sierra
foothills, where he lived until his
death in 1954.
But perhaps the best-known
member of Stanford's Hall of
Infamy is the founder him
self. Leland Stanford.
Yes, the millions used to build
and fund the University in its
early years were acquired through

graft and corruption. (Ironically,
Stanford's gift might not be ac
cepted were It offered today; the
University trustees' guidelines on
giving stipulate that gifts must
have been obtained by legal
means.)
The bulk of the Stanford's
fortune came from his involve
ment with the Southern Pacific
Railroad, of which he was presi
dent.
Stanford and three others or
ganized the railroad in 1861, but
initially had difficulty raising
money for what was to become the
western portion of America's
transcontinental railroad. After
tapping federal, state and local
governments along the route, they
were swimming in money - none
of it their own.
According to the 1934 book

and his cohorts raised about *79
