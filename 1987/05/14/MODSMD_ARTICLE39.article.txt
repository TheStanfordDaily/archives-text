### CHRIS MYERS 
Much of the emphasis of this
weekend s Cornerstone
celebration :s on the fu
ture — looking forward to what
Stanford will and should be doing
in the next 100 years But Corner
stone Weekend and the ensuing
four years of Centennial festivities
are also a celebration of the Uni
versity's past, and no doubt will
stir the memories and nostalgia of
many members of the Stanford
community.
One of the most colorful events
in the University's splendid his
tory was the yearlong celebration,
46 years ago, of Stanford's 50th
anniversary.
By the time the birthday year of
1941 approached. University offi
cials had already planned 12
months worth of shindigs and
shenanigans But the party
started sooner than anyone ex
pected — on the very first day of
the year. The Stanford football
team — the "Wow Boys.'' as that
year's edition was nicknamed —
played Its way Into the 1941 Rose
Bowl, so that on New Year s Day.
"Ninety thousand people came to
Stanford's 50th birthday party,"
according to The Stanford Dally.
"A number of 111-wlshers from
Nebraska crashed the brawl." The
Dally continued, "but those con-

team did formation swimming in
the form of a large, living "S" fol
lowed by the numeral 50.'

cemed agreed that the hosts had
chosen a beautiful setting (the
Rose Bowl, for the celebration,
and that the presence of the
Cornhuskers (both team and
rooters; added a necessary tang to
the occasion."
Stanford followers rang in the
new year with a huge party and
rally at the Ambassador Hotel in
Los Angeles, then converged on
Pasadena the next morning.
"While most of Stanford arrived
intact and and only a little weary
at game time, the Farm crowd who
turned up at 9:15 o'clock for the
Tournament of Roses parade was
regarded with awe by their more
slothful fellows." The Dally said,
going on to comment that in the
parade "the Stanford float, a
gigantic birthday cake honoring
the 50th year, received third prize
in the educational units."
Meanwhile, in the game, the In
dians. led by halfback Pete "Kmet"
Kmetovic and quarterback
Frankie Albert, thumped the Hus
kers 21-13 to complete an unde
feated season and get the Univer
sity's anniversary year off to a
shining stan.
On Monday, Jan. 6. "Farm stu
dents sloshed back to classes in a
winter-quarter rain to open offi
cially a full year's round of celebra
tions,' The Daily reported.

The first official event of the
50th anniversary was the
Ninth Alumni Conference
held February 8 and 9 on campus.
The conference, attended by over
400 alums, featured panel
lectures, talks and exhibits. The
highlight of the weekend was a
panel discussion titled "Where
Does America Go From Here?"
moderated by History Prof.
Thomas Bailey.
A month later, on March 9.
Founder's Day was celebrated.
Students had observed the
birthday of Leland Stanford Sr.
since the University's youth,
honoring both Senator and Mrs
Stanford. Coincidentally. March 9
had also been the day in 1885
when the California legislature
adopted an act enabling Leland
Stanford to found his university
with an ordinary deed of trust.
In the Golden Jubilee year of
1941. the usual Founder's Day ex
ercises — principally a march by
the senior class from Memorial
Church to the Mausoleum — were
augmented by a speech from Uni
versity President Ray Lyman Wil
bur and a concert in the evening
by the San Francisco Symphony
Orchestra.
In his address. Wilbur
(celebrating his 25th year as presi
dent) said. "The Stanfords were
both acutely conscious of that
characteristic American urge to
educate children in the very best
way. regardless of economic
status, but in accordance with in
tellectual capacity.
"Each year, as president of the
University." he continued. " I have
grown in admiration of Senator
Stanford in the broad and signifi
cant outlines which he drew for
the new University."
The San Francisco Symphony
presented an evening concert in
Memorial Church, performing
composer Roy Harris's "Ode to
Truth." specially written for the
Stanford 50th anniversary
celebration.
Forty-six years ago this weekend
— on May 14, 1941 — the Univer
sity celebrated the 50th anniver
sary of the laying of Stanford's cor
nerstone (although it had actually
been 54 years since the corner
stone was laid in 1887).
The highlight was an
"Aquacade" held in the evening on
Lagunita. "Against a starlit back
drop, the program unfolded with
an excellent display of formation
swimming, high diving and com
edy," The Daily reported.
"Spectacular lighting augmented
the show for the 4,000 spectators
who watched the extravaganza
from the Boathouse and the
banks of the lake.
"A perfectly co-ordinated
swimmming team of eight men
and eight women wearing
phosphorescent-treated suits did
formation swimming in the form
of a large, living'S' followed by the
numeral '50.' The Stanford Band
played for the accompaniment for
the swimming," The Daily contin
ued.
The Aquacade featured floats
entered by fraternities, sororities
and other residences. Some were
more laudatory of the University
than others. Sequoia Hall won the
award for the best float by a men's

residence with a huge birthday
cake with 50 candles and topped
by a gigantic red 'S,' according to
The Daily. The women's winner,
entered by Lagunita Court,
featured the University seal in red
and white flowers. The Chi Psi fra
ternity, taking a more cynical ap
proach to the celebration, entered
a float "topped by a large sign
reading 'They've Been Milking
• •••for Fifty Years and We're Still
the Goat.' Below was a formally
garbed gentleman milking a very
truculent goat," according to The
Daily.
The Aquacade. The Daily re
ported, "was rated by all as the
best water show ever held on
Lagunita."
The Golden Jubilee continued
with Commemoration Week
June 15 to 21. The week
began with Commencement, at
which representatives of the Uni
versity's first 49 graduating
classes marched in the procession
with faculty and the Class of 1941.
Addresses were given by Wilbur,
Lou Henry Hoover and Charles
Beardsley. Class of '06 and former
president of the American Bar As
sociation.
The day after Commencement,
the University commenced a four
day symposium on "The Univer
sity and the Future of America."
With the nation on the brink of

war and the world torn by already
raging conflict, many of the
speeches dealt either directly or
indirectly with the clash between
totalitarianism and democracy.
The opening lecture, delivered by
UC-Berkeley physicist Ernest
Lawrence, made a passing refer
ence to the nuclear arms race that
was still a few years off. "Splitting
the atom, converting its matter
into energy, is one of the current
objectives of science whose possi
bilities stagger the imagination."
Lawrence said.
Johns Hopkins President Isaiah
Bowman struck an interesting
counterpoint to Lawrence's
lecture: "Science is not the cause
of war. What man wills to have or
to do is the cause of war. Science
and invention provide tools, scien
tific discovery identifies natural
causes, the mind devises or dis
covers rationalities — all of which
may be betrayed in purpose by a
mistaken belief or a mistaken so
cial will, even in a democracy."
Other speakers at the sympo
sium included author Lewis Mum
ford, Caltech Chairman Robert
Millikan, Harvard Physiology Prof.
Walter Cannon, Librarian of
Congress Archibald MacLelsh and
the omnipresent Herbert Hoover.
The Symposium Dinner was
held on June 18 in Lagunita

A centerpiece of the University's 50th anniversary celebration in 1941 was the re-enactment of the opening day
ceremonies of October 1, 1891 (above). Costumed professors and students portrayed Leland Stanford Sr., University
President David Starr Jordan and other principals of the 1891 ceremony.
Court. Tickets to the dinner could
be had for all of *1.55. Sympo
sium guests and observers, mean
while. were offered lodgings in
Lagunita Court, then an all
women's dormitory. A four-page
glossy pamphlet was produced to
extoll the virtues of the hall's ac
comodations, which could be had,
complete with meals, for *5 a day.
"Although convenient to the
Quad, (Lagunita's) location
insures quiet and restful sur
roundings," the pamphlet
proclaimed.
Most of the academics visiting
campus were brought together on
the morning of the 20th for the
Formal Academic Convocation.
Representatives from 308 col
leges, universities and learned
societies in 45 states plus Hawaii
and Canada gathered in Memorial
Church for the event.
Given the climate and events
of the times, it was all too
appropriate that Com
mcmoration Week be capped by
the June 20 dedication of the
newly built Herbert Hoover Li
brary on War, Revolution and
Peace.
The dedication took place in
Memorial Auditorium, with
speeches delivered by Harvard
History Prof. Sidney Fay and Yale
President Charles Seymour.
"The significance of the collec
tions here housed cannot be over
stated, for they will serve not
merely historians but mankind."
Seymour said of the library. "The
chief dangers now threatening
civilization proceed from ignor
ance, from disease and from war."
After the dedication, the audi
ence streamed out into the plaza
in front of Hoover Tower to hear a
concert on the tower carillon. The
carillon had been given to Stan
ford and Hoover by the Belgian-
American Educational Founda
tion at the close of the New York
World's Fair, where it had been a
feature of the Belgian Pavilion.
The Carillon concert was fol
lowed by the formal dedication of
the new library building. Speakers
at the dedication included Leland
Cutler of the University Board of
Trustees, Hoover Library Director
Ralph Lutz and Hoover himself.
Hoover, The Daily reported,
"told the 2,000 persons gathered
in front of the building that unless
the documents within it were
used as examples of the failure of
the last peace, and were explored
as guides for future meetings
around peace tables, the library
was useless 'except for the
curious.' "
This big day ended with an
evening concert by the San Fran
cisco Symphony. In its second
performance of the 50th Anniver
sary, the symphony entertained
7,000 people gathered under the
stars in Frost Amphitheater.
While dark clouds formed on
the world political horizon
and the United States
inched toward the brink of war,
the celebration at Stanford went
on through the summer of 1941.
As involuntary conscription
went into effect, President Wilbur
encouraged draft-age students to
take maximum advantage of their
remaining time as civilians by at
tending summer session at Stan
ford.
Meanwhile, University planners
got set for the climax of the 50th
Anniversary observance. As 50th
Anniversary Chairman Robert
Eckles Swain said, "Hitler or no
Hitler, war or no war," the celebra
tion of the birthday year would go
on.
The last candles were put in
Stanford's birthday cake during
the week of Oct. 1, a time that Wil
bur referred to as the ' festive
phase" of the Golden Jubilee. The
week began with a gathering in
the Inner Quad Oct. 1 to com
memorate the opening of Stanford
on Oct. 1, 1891. The star of the
day was none other than Herbe
Hoover, a member of the first class
of Stanford.
"A university is more than Just
to help you," Hoover said on t 9
occasion. "It is a great living
thing, radiating truth. Justice,
service and freedom. And if y°
work for it and care for it an
serve It in these next 50 years, it
will give even greater service to
mankind."
The day ended with a gala black
tie dinner at the Garden Court
Restaurant in the Palace Hotel in
San Francisco. One thousand per
sons paid *2.58 per plate to at
tend the dinner. The festivities
began with a dramatization, writ
ten by Prof. Norman Philbrick, of
the University's motto, "The
Winds of Freedom Blow."
That motto, which had special
significance during the war years,
was also the theme of the even
ing's keynote address, delivered by
Raymond Fosdlck, president of
the Rockefeller Foundation.
"Fifty years from now, in 1991,
your children and grandchildren
will celebrate the centenary of
Stanford," Fosdick said.
"Compared with Leyden or Oxford
or Paris, it will still be a young uni
versity — young in its promise,
young in its vigor, young in its
hope.
"In 1991," he continued, "if
liberty has re-established in the
places where now it is gone, if
democracy is a living, growing
force, it will be in no small part be
cause institutions like Stanford
have led the way to new light and
have dared to dream of greater
days to come. It will be because
you, like your fathers of 40 years
ago and your sons after you, have
dedicated Stanford as a center of a
intellectual ferment, where the
winds of freedom blow."
The next day, Oct. 2, offered
visitors the opportunity to visit
classes during the morning. In the
afternoon, nearly 1,000 persons
attended a panel discussion on
"Future Aims of the Nations in the
World Conflict." Stanford profes
sors from Great Britain, France,
Japan, China, Germany, Russia
and several other countries partic
ipated in the discussion, which
was moderated by President Wil
bur and organized by Prof. H.
Donald Winbigler, now president
of the Stanford Historical Society.
The highlight of the October
festivities (and arguably, of
the entire Golden Jubilee)
was the Festival and Promenade
in the Inner Quad on the night of
Oct. 3.
The evening's festivities began
with an exact re-enactment of the
University's opening day exercises
of Oct. 1, 1891. An estimated
5,000 persons flocked to the re
enactment, held, as the original
event had been, under the west
arch of the Inner Quad. Faculty
members and graduate students
dressed to resemble the original
speakers, complete with beards,
moustaches and morning coats.
English Prof. John Dodds
played the part of David Starr Jor
dan, the University's first presi
dent; graduate student A. Grove
Day portrayed Senator Stanford
and Atha Hillback his wife. Jane.
The opening day reenactment
was followed by a narrative of the
University's early history by
Charles Field, a member of Stan
ford's "pioneer" class of 1895.
Field's narrative was accompanied
by a show of 98 slides of Stanford
in the early days. The slide
presentation, projected onto a
giant screen on the side of the In
ner Quad, ended with a slide of
Jordan and his beloved dog. Jock.
As this picture was put on the
screen, a recording, made in
1916, of Jordan analyzing the
"Stanford spirit" was played.
"No one who saw and heard it
could fail to feel some of the same
exuberance and optimism that
had swept over the Quad on
opening day," Peck said of the
event.
As the slide presentation ended,
Ernie Hecksler, Class of 1938.
struck up his orchestra, and all
assembled began to dance in the
middle of the Quad. As Peck said,
"Stanford had gone back five
decades and everyone was young
again."
The next day. Oct. 4. the Stan
ford football team set the same
kind of tone for the end of the
Golden Jubilee as it had for the
beginning, routing the UCLA
Bruins at Stanford Stadium. "It is
beginning to look as if life was just
a Bowl of Roses for the Stanford
football team," The Daily
proclaimed.
As its triumphant 50th birthday
party drew to a close the next day
with a service of thanksgiving and
commemoration in Memorial
Church, things were looking
pretty rosy for the University, too.
