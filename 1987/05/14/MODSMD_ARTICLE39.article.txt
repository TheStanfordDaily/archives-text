Much of the emphasis of this
weekend s Cornerstone
celebration :s on the fu
ture — looking forward to what
Stanford will and should be doing
in the next 100 years But Corner
stone Weekend and the ensuing
four years of Centennial festivities
are also a celebration of the Uni
versity's past, and no doubt will
stir the memories and nostalgia of
many members of the Stanford
community.
One of the most colorful events
in the University's splendid his
tory was the yearlong celebration,
46 years ago, of Stanford's 50th
anniversary.
By the time the birthday year of
1941 approached. University offi
cials had already planned 12
months worth of shindigs and
shenanigans But the party
started sooner than anyone ex
pected — on the very first day of
the year. The Stanford football
team — the "Wow Boys.'' as that
year's edition was nicknamed —
played Its way Into the 1941 Rose
Bowl, so that on New Year s Day.
"Ninety thousand people came to
Stanford's 50th birthday party,"
according to The Stanford Dally.
"A number of 111-wlshers from
Nebraska crashed the brawl." The
Dally continued, "but those con-

cemed agreed that the hosts had
chosen a beautiful setting (the
Rose Bowl, for the celebration,
and that the presence of the
Cornhuskers (both team and
rooters; added a necessary tang to
the occasion."
Stanford followers rang in the
new year with a huge party and
rally at the Ambassador Hotel in
Los Angeles, then converged on
Pasadena the next morning.
"While most of Stanford arrived
intact and and only a little weary
at game time, the Farm crowd who
turned up at 9:15 o'clock for the
Tournament of Roses parade was
regarded with awe by their more
slothful fellows." The Dally said,
going on to comment that in the
parade "the Stanford float, a
gigantic birthday cake honoring
the 50th year, received third prize
in the educational units."
Meanwhile, in the game, the In
dians. led by halfback Pete "Kmet"
Kmetovic and quarterback
Frankie Albert, thumped the Hus
kers 21-13 to complete an unde
feated season and get the Univer
sity's anniversary year off to a
shining stan.
On Monday, Jan. 6. "Farm stu
dents sloshed back to classes in a
winter-quarter rain to open offi
cially a full year's round of celebra
tions,' The Daily reported.

The first official event of the
50th anniversary was the
Ninth Alumni Conference
held February 8 and 9 on campus.
The conference, attended by over
400 alums, featured panel
lectures, talks and exhibits. The
highlight of the weekend was a
panel discussion titled "Where
Does America Go From Here?"
moderated by History Prof.
Thomas Bailey.
A month later, on March 9.
Founder's Day was celebrated.
Students had observed the
birthday of Leland Stanford Sr.
since the University's youth,
honoring both Senator and Mrs
Stanford. Coincidentally. March 9
had also been the day in 1885
when the California legislature
adopted an act enabling Leland
Stanford to found his university
with an ordinary deed of trust.
In the Golden Jubilee year of
1941. the usual Founder's Day ex
ercises — principally a march by
the senior class from Memorial
Church to the Mausoleum — were
augmented by a speech from Uni
versity President Ray Lyman Wil
bur and a concert in the evening
by the San Francisco Symphony
Orchestra.
In his address. Wilbur
(celebrating his 25th year as presi
dent) said. "The Stanfords were
both acutely conscious of that
characteristic American urge to
educate children in the very best
way. regardless of economic
status, but in accordance with in
tellectual capacity.
"Each year, as president of the
University." he continued. " I have
grown in admiration of Senator
Stanford in the broad and signifi
cant outlines which he drew for
the new University."
The San Francisco Symphony
presented an evening concert in
Memorial Church, performing
