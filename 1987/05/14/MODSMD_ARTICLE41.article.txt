Some problems always exist at a university: How
do you register large numbers of students?
Where do you house them? How do you handle
underage student drinking?
History Prof. Emeritus H. Donald Wlnblgler, who
was registrar from 1945 to 1950 and served until
1967 as dean of students, has seen these problems
as they have recurred at Stanford over the years.
Faced with the problems of running a university
after World War 11, many of Winblgler's actions have
had an Impact on current students.
As registrar before the advent of computers — and
before even the phenomenon of pre-registratlon, for
that matter — Wlnblgler Immediately faced the enor
mous task of accomodating a Stanford enrollment
that ballooned following World War 11.
"We were simply not prepared for our first registra
tion," he says. The largest pre-war enrollment was
4,385 students in 1941. In the fall of 1946, his first
registration in his new position, 4,500 underclass
men were enrolled — in addition to the 1,500 veter
ans who had left the University in good standing and
were returning to finish school. Add to all this the
fact that Stanford had just accepted 1,000 freshmen,
and the administrative nightmare Wlnblgler had to
face gains some perspective.
Registration was conducted in Old Pavilion
(Maples Pavilion was not even a blueprint at that
time). Coupon books, perhaps borrowing from the
ration books of the war, were distributed to all stu
dents as their permits to register.
The books consisted of "stubs — kind of like a
checkbook. One was your fee card, one was your
study list, one was your library card" and so on. Wln
blgler says. Years later, as dean of students, Wln
blgler Introduced pre-registration.
But the real problem, just as it is today, was
housing.
"How did we accomodate [all the students)? asks
Wlnblgler. "What saved us was Dibble General Hospi
tal in Menlo Park. It was an army hospital which was
used for a year and a half and was suddenly surplus
property."
The University bought the hospital, renamed it
Stanford Village, and was able to house 1,000 single
men, 275 single women and provide apartments for
335 undergraduates, graduate students and faculty.
Stanford Village provided a large portion of stu
dent housing until the construction after the war of
Stern and Wilbur Halls, which were built during
Winblgler's tenure, and later Escondido Village.
Wlnblgler acknowledged the unpopularity of Stern
and Wilbur with students. "I don't think they were all

that Inspired. We were just glad to get something
done," he says.
Wlnbigler Is responsible In large part for the devel
opment of the Office of Residential Education, which
was started in the 1950s while he was dean.
"We did some real pioneering" by putting faculty
members Into the student residences, he says. "Coed
housing was just at the brink when 1 left." Stanford
housing became coeducational in 1967.
While involved only in preliminary discussions
about the Draw. Winbigler says he thinks that it is a
good idea and that the University cannot realistically
build more student residences.
"When you have the option of living off campus,"
Winbigler notes, the University cannot be absolutely
certain of how much housing is needed. Stanford ef
fectively creates its own demand by offering the op
tion of on-campus housing.
"The University has to keep housing just short of
what is needed." he says, or living on campus would
not be as desireable and a housing surplus would
result.
Another recurring headache at Stanford is the
shortage of classroom space. Winbigler faced this
problem because he had to accomodate all the re
turning veterans.
In order to have enough classrooms, Winbigler
converted the academic schedule from "essentially a
four-hour day to a nine-hour day" with some classes
on Saturday.
"[The students] resented it, but for basic freshman
classes they didn't have any choice," notes the prag
matic former administrator.
The University's alcohol policy — currently under
scrutiny — is also an area over which Winbigler had
some influence. Winbigler was one of the architects
of the current policy, and then — as now — the Uni
versity has stressed responsibility in drinking.
"The policy was. No drinking on campus,' and it
was being flouted." Winbigler recalls. On Friday af
ternoons, students would drive off-campus to a local
bar, "get tanked up on beer,"and drive back to
campus Intoxicated. Many automobile accidents
resulted from the ban on alcohol.
Deciding the ban was not feasible because the Uni
versity could not guarantee that students would be
responsible drinkers, Winbigler recommended to the
trustees in the early 1960s to lift the ban. He says he
hoped this policy would make students more respon
sible.
Winbigler maintains that, even in light of recent
events, the policy remains sound.
"I suspect there'll be some effort to tighten up. but
I don't think it'll be as rigid as It once was. 1 don't
think Just banning liquor (on campus) is going to
change this."
