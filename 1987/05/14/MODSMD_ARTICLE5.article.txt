Stanford Police Chief Marvin Herrington said yes
terday that the department's report on the drowning
death of junior David Dunshee is as complete as it
can be until the coroner's report is available in one to
three weeks.
But Herrington said he understood the sentiments
of Ron Rico, assistant district attorney for Santa
Clara County, who Tuesday characterized the report
as "far from complete" and sent it back to the Stan
ford police after having received it Friday.
"I understand his frustration," Herrington said.
"He can't do anything without a complete report.
He's frustrated because he can't go forward without
the coroner's report."
That report will not be available until next week at
the earliest, said Nadine Mackey. a secretary in the
coroner's office. Mackey added that the coroner's of
fice has determined the cause of death as drowning,
which appeared on the death certificate.

Rico had cited the lack of a cause of death and the
lack of a blood alcohol count as the major omissions
In the police report. The blood alcohol count will not
be available until the autopsy report is released.
That information Is important because Dunshee
had been drinking at a Zeta Psi fraternity rush party
before leaving around 1 a.m. April 22. Herrington
said Dunshee fell into Lagunita and was unable to
swim to safety because he was intoxicated.
Rico could file charges against the individuals who
provided the 20-year-old Dunshee with alcohol, but
will not decide whether to do so until he receives the
coroner's report. California law prohibits providing
alcohol to anyone under 21 years of age.
Herrington said his statements were based on
what he was told by those who were at the party with
Dunshee and the coroner's finding of drowning as
the cause of death.
Herrington said Stanford police will take no fur
ther action until the coroner's report is released.
"Once we receive that information, it may lead us to
do some other things." he said.
