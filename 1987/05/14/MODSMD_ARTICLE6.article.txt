What is affirmative action and
how do different individuals feel
about it?
A panel consisting of a Univer
sity administrator, a law profes
sor and members of various eth
nic and political groups at
tempted to answer that question
in a forum held in Cubberley
Auditorium last night.
In his introductory remarks,
Lewie Ford, student director of
the Stanford Workshop on Poli
tical and Social Issues, said the
sponsors of the forum hoped the
discussion "would encourage
people to talk about their own
ideas on affirmative action."
"The legal and philosophical
basis for affirmative action . . .
assumes systemic discrimina
tion against a class of people,"
said Santiago Rodriguez, Uni
versity affirmative action officer.
"One cannot justify any affirma
tive action program unless a
(group] can be classified as dis
advantaged."
Rodriguez explained that
blacks, hispanlcs. Native
Americans, Asian Americans,
women and disabled persons
were examples of disadvantaged
groups in the United States.
Rodriguez said many people
are opposed to affirmative ac
tion because they say that every
one should be treated the same.
"We as Americans need to
focus on fair treatment." he
said.
Rodriguez cited the example
of an employer trying to choose
between a man and a woman. If
the man is "clearly more

qualified, it (the question of
whom to hire) becomes race or
sex neutral," he said. "You hire
the man."
However, if the applicants are
"comparably qualified . . . you
can hire the woman." He added
the woman may even be more
qualified because she can bring
her "womanness" to the posi
tion. which would allow the goal
of diversity to be obtained.
Speaking on behalf of the
Stanford College Republicans,
Tanya Ferencko and Jason
Dominguez said affirmative ac

tlon Is preventing the goal of
equal opportunity from being
achieved. Ferencko said the law
should not be used to punish
majority groups for past societal
wrongs.
"Affirmative action creates a
host of Its own unfairnesses,"
Dominguez said.
But Subodh Chandra, a mem
ber of the Stanford Democrats,
said the Constitution was never
"colorblind or gender-blind" as
many people have asserted.
