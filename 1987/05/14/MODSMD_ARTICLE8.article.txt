Israel says no to peace talks
JERUSALEM — Israel's policy-making Inner Cabinet refused
yesterday to endorse a proposal to convene an International con
ference on Middle East peace, a move that dealt the plan a serious
setback and plunged this coalition government into a new crisis.
The refusal was a victory for Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir,
who opposes such a conference, and a major blow to Foreign Mini
ster Shimon Peres, who has been a prime mover of the proposal as
a means of paving the way for direct talks between Israel and a
joint delegation composed of Jordan and moderate Palestinians.
Peres, confident he had enough votes to break up the coalition,
had declared In advance that he would call for new elections if the
10-member inner Cabinet failed to act. But yesterday morning, he
and his supporters discovered they had been outmaneuvered by
Shamir's men and lacked the parliamentary votes needed to bring
down the 32-month-old government.
Peres' Labor Alignment announced last night that it would
remain in the government until it comes up with enough votes to
bring down the coalition, a task Peres said might take a month or
more. Until then, the government stands immobilized, with Peres
and his more dovish Labor Alignment insisting it should dissolve
and submit the international conference proposal to parliamen
tary elections, while Shamir and his rightist Likud bloc contend
that the plan has been rejected and should be abandoned.
FAA urged to reduce flights
WASHINGTON — The nation's transportation safety watchdog
yesterday urged the Federal Aviation Administration to reduce the
number of flights at the country's busiest airports during the
peak summer travel season to guard against "a catastrophic acci
dent."
In formal recommendations, the National Transportation Safety
Board said that the county's air traffic control system is at times
overburdened, causing an "erosion of safety" that may worsen
with increased summer traffic and unpredictable summer
storms.
Flight reductions would mean even more delays for the traveling
public, NTSB chairman Jim Burnett acknowledged in an inter
view.
"It will be a bitter pill," he said. "In highly saturated areas, It
may mean the planes cannot fly at the times scheduled."
Burnett informally made a similar call for restrictions In an in
terview April 28, but yesterday's formal recommendations mark
the first time the agency has asked the FAA to reduce commercial
air traffic in the name of safety. Burnett said yesterday that the
recommendations should not be viewed as an attack on the FAA,
but added that they "reflect a lessening of (the board's) confidence
in the job the FAA is doing."
The NTSB declined to specify which areas are overcrowded, and
where traffic should be frozen or reduced. However, the board's re
commendation covers peak hours at all 35 airports monitored by
FAA headquarters for overcrowding. Earlier this year the board
conducted investigations in Chicago, Cleveland, Boston and Los
Angeles.
"We're talking about saturated sectors at peak times. The total
traffic may be able to grow," Burnett said.
Barbie refuses to watch trial
LYON, France — In the face of angry accusations of cowardice,
Klaus Barbie, the former Gestapo chief in Lyon, refused yesterday
to attend any more sessions of his trial for "crimes against
humanity."
Barbie's withdrawal, permissible under French law, drained the
trial of much of its drama, ensuring that Barbie will not have to
face his alleged victims and their families in the weeks ahead.
Reading a written statement in German on the third day of the
trial, Barbie said he was refusing to attend any more sessions be
cause he is "a kidnapped Bolivian citizen" expelled illegally from
Bolivia to France four years ago.
"My expulsion was not legal," Barbie said. "It was a violation of
the Bolivian constitution, of Bolivian civil rights and of interna
tional human rights. I regard myself as a hostage and not a legally
detained prisoner."
He described his withdrawal as "a legal matter (that) has noth
ing to do with cowardice."
Barbie's lawyer, Jacques Verges, told the court that two Bolivian
lawyers had filed suit in the Bolivian Supreme Court challenging
the expulsion of Barbie to French Guiana in 1983. Verges said
Barbie had been delivered to France without an extradition
hearing in Bolivia.
Barbie is withdrawing, Verges said, because he does not believe
that the French court has any right to try him.
House extends U.S. debt limit
WASHINGTON — The House yestesday easily approved a tempo
rary *20 billion extension of the national debt limit that will allow
the federal government to meet financial obligations through July
17. The measure faces a more serious hurdle in the Senate, where
it is likely to become embroiled in a fight over budget reform.
By a vote of 296 to 124, the House agreed to raise temporarily
the debt ceiling to >2.32 trillion, an action that would avert a gov
ernment financial crisis that Treasury officials said could lead to a
U.S. default by May 28. The approval came after the House
defeated. 259 to 162. a Reagan administration request to raise the
ceiling to almost *2.6 trillion, a level that would have covered fu
ture borrowing costs until Sept. 30. 1988.
Despite efforts of Democratic and Republican leaders in the
Senate to guarantee that the debt limit is passed unencumbered
by amendments, the legislation is expected to be used for a
renewed attempt to tighten the 1985 law mandating deficit reduc
tions.
Sen. Phil Gramm. R-Texas, has promised to attach to the debt
limit bill a measure replacing the automatic spending cut mecha
nism struck from the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings balanced-budget
law by the Supreme Court last year. Gramm on Tuesday said he
would only be dissuaded from his course If President Reagan can
come up with compelling new arguments against it.
Should Gramm succeed there will likely be a high-stakes con
frontation with the House that Treasury Secretary James Baker
warned could lead to an "unthinkable and Irresponsible" default
by the United States. The Senate backed a similar attempt by
Gramm last year.
Military coup in Fiji
SUVA. Fiji — Fiji's army took over the government in a coup
d'etat Thursday, the Information Ministry said.
Witnesses said an army colonel and about 10 masked and
armed soldiers burst into Parliament and kidnapped the prime
minister and his Cabinet.
They drove off In an army truck to an unknown destination.
The action came nearly four weeks after the election of Fiji's first
Indian-majority government, a coalition of the National Federa
tion Party and the Fiji Labour Party.
Since then, demonstrations including protest marches have
been organized by Fijlans demanding constitutional changes to
guarantee Fijian leadership of the country.
