# McFarlane: Casey was in charge

WASHINGTON - Former White
House aide Oliver North, the chief
operative in the Iran-contra affair,
appears to have taken his orders
directly from the late CIA Director
William Casey, former national se
curity adviser Robert McFarlane
testified yesterday.
McFarlane, who sometimes
responded with angry outbursts
and rambling discourses during
his third day before congressional
committees investigating the af
fair. said that North had "more
contact than I realized" with
Casey, who died last week.
Committee members agreed. "I
think it's rather clear that Oliver
North was acting under the aegis

of Mr. Casey," Sen. William
Cohen. R-Maine, said.
Some committee members said
that Casey may have channeled
his orders through North as a
means of escaping a ban Imposed
by Congress on CIA support for
the contras, as the rebels are
known. But Sen. David Boren, D-
Okla.. speculated that it was the
other way around: The Marine of
ficer may have gone to Casey
seeking authorization for his pos
sibly illegal activities.
The CIA director was one of
President Reagan's closest con
fidants and one of the strongest
backers of Reagan's policy of sup
porting the contras. Only hours

before he was scheduled to dis
cuss the Iran-contra affair before a
congressional panel last Decem
ber, a brain seizure stemming
from a cancerous tumor left him
disabled until his death from
pneumonia.
As evidence of North's central
role in the Iran-contra affair has
mounted, committee members
said, they have begun to have mis
givings about their original plan
to offer North limited immunity
from prosecution in exchange for
his testimony.
The panels are currently sched
uled to consider approving the
grant of immunity on June 4 and
to take his public testimony as

early as June 23. So far. North has
refused to testify before congres
sional Investigators, citing his
Fifth Amendment protection
against self-incrimination.
McFarlane testified that Reagan
administration officials were un
der orders from Reagan to help the
Nicaraguan rebels "hold body and
soul together" during the period
when official U.S. aid was banned.
He said that North's activities
appear to have stretched the law's
vague boundaries. Several ver
sions of the law banning military
aid to the contras were in effect
from mid-1984 until late last year.
