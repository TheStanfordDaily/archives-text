# Student performers entertain, delight
## 
### BRYAN COOPERRIDER Staff writer 
This afternoon will start on a
good note — literally, with all
the student musical and sing
ing groups wandering about
campus.
And much of the thanks for
this afternoon's happenings
must go to Kevin Reidy. who
has organized the gamut of stu
dent musical and theatrical
performances around campus.
Starting at 2 p.m., there will be
student performances at six
different locations on campus.
The performances will range
from the Band in White Plaza to
poetry reading in the Rodin
Sculpture Garden.
The organization of this af
ternoon's events is no easy task

— especially when there are 30
groups performing In six differ
ent locations. But Reidy Is no
stranger to the perils of the job.
Reidy, a graduate student at
the Stanford Graduate School
of Business, performed in 15
shows as an undergraduate, as
well as writing the script and
directing for Big Game
Gaieties.
Reidy's one quarter as an un
dergraduate In Florence, Italy
fostered a love of the Italian cul
ture that motivated him to
pursue a graduate degree in
drama in Florence. Along with
extensive experience in per
forming arts, Reidy has been a
press agent for actors at the
Marines Memorial Theater in
San Francisco and assisted in
organizing conferences on
campus.
Right now Reidy is making a
comedy movie about Wall Street
with a friend and has just
finished a movie about the
GSB, which will be premierlng
in June.
Reidy said he sees his organi
zation of today's performances
as an "opportunity to get back
in touch with Stanford. It's real
easy to do your own thing and
get out of touch when you're at
the business school because all
your classes are in the same
building."
Stephen Peeps, director of
University relations in the Of
fice of Public Affairs, offered
Reldy the challenge of organiz
ing a "showcase of student tal
ent" In January. Reidy has
been planning for today's
events ever since.
Originally, the University
wanted a return to the old days,
when the different academic
classes competed against each
other in song. "That's just a
little to tough to organize in the
amount of time I had." Reidy
said.
Instead, Reidy took it upon
himself to find out who had
ever performed anywhere on
campus. He contacted
STARTS, Student Organiza
tion Services and such places
as Bechtel International Cen
ter. "I wanted to give some of
the little-known groups a
chance to perform," Reidy said.
Among Friday's performers,
there will be a Swiss alphon
horn duet and a country fiddle
player at Tresidder, Black Per
forming Arts and native Ameri
can Indian dancers in White
Plaza, and even the Renais
sance Wind Band in the Rodin
Sculpture Garden. "I tried to
place the less-known groups in

the more popular locations."
Reidy said. "There are a lot of
groups I've never seen before
and I'm really excited they're
performing."
Student open houses and
tours are included in Friday's
attractions. They will include a
display of student engineering
projects in Terman Engineer
ing Center and backstage tours
of Memorial Auditorium.
The six different perfor
mance locations will be
"basically separate events" and
each location has a separate co
ordinator. There will be roving
performances by the Fleet
Street Singers, the Mendicants
and Mixed Company. "They'll
stop and sing whenever they
get a crowd," Reidy said.
Reldy pointed out some of the
problems with organizing
today's event. "Just to get a
piano moved to the lawn be
tween Crothers and Green we
had to go through Events and
Services, the Music Depart
ment and even the Police De
partment so a vehicle could be
driven on campus," Reidy said.
"Just to rent one of the
auditoriums you have to fill out
eight forms. Actually, politics
are at a minimum, which is
surprising," he added.
Reidy refers to what he calls
the "shoestring effect" in ex
plaining how he expects today's
events to turn out.
"Things always look like they
are about to fall apart, you just
have to go back and tie things
together again. That's what
keeps it exciting. In general,
people are pretty pumped about
the whole thing, " Reidy said.
5,000 people are expected on
campus for the festivities. "Now
we just have to pray for no
rain," Reidy concluded.
