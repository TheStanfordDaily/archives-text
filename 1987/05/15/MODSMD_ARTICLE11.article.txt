## THE 						STANFORD DAILY An Independent Newspaper Due process

For months, the story of the Reagan ad
ministration's involvement in the Iran
contra affair has been emerging in frustrat
ingly small bits and pieces. For a time, it
seemed as though the true story of the
dealings would never be fully known.
Finally. Congress last week began the
laborious process of systematically unravel
ing the affair's complicated web of deceit and
hypocrisy. It's a process long overdue and
welcome.
The testimony of the first two witnesses,
retired Air Force Major General Richard
Secord last week and former national secur
ity advisor Robert McFarlane, has done
much to confirm mounting suspicion that
the scandal may run deeper than was previ
ously thought.
Since November, when the first details of
the scandal became known, the American
public has only had a fragmentary under
standing of the extent of possible wrongdo
ing. By systematically probing the extent of
possible wrongdoing, congressional hear

ings will hopefully establish once and for all
exactly what happened and who knew about
it.
As unpleasant and embarrassing as these
revelations may prove to be. the fact that they
are being publicly aired is confirmation that
the American system of checks and balances
remains alive and well.
The thoroughness with which Congress is
pursuing its investigation is demonstrating
to the nation that if an administration
exceeds the limits of constitutional power, it
must pay the price.
Watching congressional investigators grill
the scandal's principal players day after day
well into the summer will be a usefully ca
thartic experience for the nation.
In the wake of a scandal that has seriously
tarnished the credibility of the American
presidency, the start of congressional
hearings last week is a reassuring sign that
the American system of government will
weather this crisis and perhaps grow
stronger from it.
