Last week, a group of minority students calling it
self the "Rainbow Agenda" presented University
President Donald Kennedy with a list of "demands"
to improve minority life on campus. Yesterday, the
Rainbow Agenda held a rally in White Plaza and the
Quad to protest what they called "100 years of rac
ism." The group interrupted University President
Donald Kennedy's opening remarks by letting black
balloons fly up in the air, and members walked out of
the Quad, single file, at the beginning of U.S. Secre
tary of State George Shultz's speech.
These actions undoubtedly have caused much
resentment on the part of many students and
alumni. Yesterday in the Quad. I overheard one stu
dent complaining that the black balloons and protest
banners "ruined the celebration." This student went

on to say that the minority groups should respect the
occasion, and further, that their "demands" to Ken
nedy earlier in the week were "ridiculous." One
group of students even went so far as to circulate a
reactionary "reply" to the Rainbow Agenda's
demands. After reading it. I understand why the
group decided to remain anonymous.
But the tactics and demands of the Rainbow
Agenda aren't ridiculous. It's the reaction of others
that is ridiculous.
Members of the Rainbow Agenda had every right to
protest in the Quad yesterday; indeed, they would
have been foolish not to. It's not often that such a
huge public event occurs at Stanford, and to miss
the opportunity to voice their concerns would have
been stupid. And the protest was well-organized and
effective: they clapped and chanted and filed out. It's
not as if they destroyed the stage or threw rotten
fruit at George Schultz and Donald Kennedy. If any
thing. the protest was 100 civil; maybe the protesters
could have raised awareness of their concerns even
more by creating more of a stir.
Others may have problems with the posture of the
Rainbow Agenda and its "demands." Well. I don't
think the University Administration would be very
responsive if members of the group went quietly
about their business, politely requesting that their
suggestions be taken into consideration. Quite
simply, if the Rainbow Agenda wants change, it has
to be aggressive in reaching for it. The group is

working against the status quo, and it will not get
anywhere trying to work within the system because
it's not part of the system.
And the group's demands are not as extreme as
most think. The creation of an Office of Minority Af
fairs is a good idea, and would go a long way toward
making minorities more a part of Stanford. That the
Asian-American Students Association needs new of
fice space is obvious. Expanding the University's
academic departments by establishing programs to
study more and different cultures will add to the Uni
versity's diversity and improve Stanford's overall aca
demic standing. On balance, the agenda is fair.
But the attitude of the majority of Stanford stu
dents — and alumni, I suspect — is that the Rainbow
Agenda is marring an otherwise pleasant weekend.
Too many people find so much right with Stanford
that they cannot even comprehend someone who is
unhappy here. Invariably, some would tell those dis
satisfied with the University to go elsewhere.
This is the wrong attitude. If Stanford is to be a
great university, a collection of diverse, talented and
intelligent students and faculty, it cannot simply
brush malcontents aside. When there are so many
who do not feel comfortable here — and almost 300
students protested today — it is more likely the insti
tution is flawed, not that the protesters are quib
bling with minor details. If Stanford is truly commit
ted to providing a broad liberal education to as wide
a range of students as possible, then the Administra
tion should listen to students' concerns.
The University's 100 th birthday is a cause for
celebration — but not for everybody. Sure, Stanford
can bask in its successes, but the University should
also focus on improvements for the future — and not
overlook failures in its past. Those who criticize
Stanford this weekend are not simply trying to cast a
pail over the giddy celebrations; I'm sure they would
much rather be participants in the party than
protesters at it. They're pointing out real, serious
problems with the University.
If Stanford were truly serious about improving it
self and setting an agenda for the next century, it
would listen to those unhappy with the University in
stead of being embarrassed by them.
