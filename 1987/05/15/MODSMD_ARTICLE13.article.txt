# Scandal behooves policy change
## 
### 
The current congressional hearings on the
Iran-contra scandal invite further criticism of
one of the larger issues indirectly connected to
the controversy: U.S. policy in Central
America. The following critique flows from the
assumption that the liabilities of the Reagan
administration's militarization of the region —
for example, supporting the contras, funneling
billions of dollars in military aid into neighbor
ing El Salvador and Honduras, and staging
periodic military maneuvers provocatively
close to Nicaragua's northern border — far out
weigh any appreciable assets of such a course.

From the ideological right s perspective, the
principal benefit of Reagan's program has
been to show the Sandinistas and their Soviet
bloc patrons that America still maintains the
ability and resolve to contain (and ultimately
roll back) the red menace, especially in its own
backyard. However, this slow but sure
militarization of Central America reflects an
overreaction by the present administration.
Our military buildup remains unwarranted
since it stems from the unsubstantiated no
tion of a "communist conspiracy." For exam
ple. there is no definitive confirmation that the
Sandinistas attempted to "export revolution"
into El Salvador in 1981 — the key event upon
which Reagan bases his claim of conspiracy.
The costs of our present policy are excessive.
First, we are alienating ourselves from our
erstwhile allies in the region, especially
Mexico. Honduras and Panama. There Is
evidence that the Reagan administration has

in the past coerced these countries, through
the threat of withholding precious economic
assistance, into opposing any proposals for the
United States to abandon the contras as a
prerequisite to peace.
Second, our "high-handedness" in the
region, our penchant for bully tactics, ironi
cally opens the door to our enemies. Our bellig
erent policy in Central America parallels Soviet
behavior in the Far East during the closing
years of the Brezhnev era. Moscow's military
buildup frightened China into forging closer
relations with the United States. Similarly,
Washington's growing military presence
threatens Nicaraguan security, so Nicaragua
has turned to the Soviet bloc for protection-
Third. we are traveling down a road that log
ically ends in direct confrontation with
Managua. At present, the advisers are train
ing. the troops are maneuvering and the infra
structure for war is expanding. Barring
Nicaraguan expansion across its borders
(which would be tantamount to suicide and is,
therefore, a slim prospect) no American presi
dent could ever Justify or sustain a war with
the Sandinistas — especially in the wake of
Vietnam.
Consequently, the normative approach in
Central America is to abandon brute force as
the cornerstone of our policy and. Instead,
build a program around our economic might
which focuses on stabilizing the regional
economies, including Nicaragua's.
If our administration truly fears the rise of
radicalism in Central America, then the most
prudent policy would be to attack the disease

surgency. In order to take the wind out of the
radicals' sails, the United States must use its

economic power to improve the status quo, es
pecially in the relatively more unstable
countries like El Salvador and Guatemala.
Otherwise, insurrection will remain the most
compelling alternative. Remember the words
of President Kennedy: "When peaceful change
is made impossible, violent revolution is made
inevitable."
As we should have learned in Vietnam, the
real battle is political, not military: the compe
tition for the hearts and minds of the vic
timized masses. Therefore, in order to gain
truly their allegiance, U.S. capital should go
toward improving their quality of life through
relief projects rather than destroying their
homes through counterinsurgency efforts. A
policy of more bread and less bullets would be
the most prudent means toward pacifying the
region.
In sum. in this atmosphere of mounting ex
ecutive instability generated by the Iran-contra
affair, it would behoove Reagan to reverse his
policy in Central America and to champion the
causes of peace and progress. Presumably, a
change in policy from belligerence to
benevolence would help salvage Reagan's
rapidly dwindling prestige, both domestically
and abroad.
