No relevance
I am a citizen of a democracy
and a beneficiary of that system
of government. I am therefore
obligated to take my turn in
speaking out.
In his recent viewpoint(Daily,
May 12), Nathan Hochman sug
gested that Karl Marx might be
"laughing vindictively from the
grave, denouncing our democracy
of the students as the true hoax it
appears to be." Hochman appar
ently feels that the recent student
elections on campus were not
representative enough of the
students' wishes.
Marx might laugh at
democracy. I won't argue with
that. But the implementation of
Marx's recommendations for
government have invariably
produced little or no citizen in
volvement in the decision-making
process. Nor will his recommen
dations ever be able to produce
representative government, I
suggest. So I don't believe Marx's
ideas are relevant to a discussion
of whether our student govern
ment (or national government) is
representative enough.
I was employed for a year in
Beijing. China has a less than
optimally representative form of
government. While I was there. I
became close friends with about
15 or 20 of my acquaintances and
associates. Privately I learned a
lot about how important repre
sentation is to people who don't
have very much of it.
Most frustrating is that when
government owns the means of
production — a condition that
Marx promoted — representative
government is virtually
impossible to guarantee. A gov
ernment that presides over a
centrally planned economy can
simply say to an individual "we're
having problems paying your
salary unless you. ..."
If government owns the means
of production, it has a most pow
erful tool for exerting control over
an unwilling constituency. People
can't fight if they can't eat. To
insure representative govern
ment, a society must, at a mini
mum, have multiple employers
instead of one state employer as
Marx preferred.
I agree that we should improve
many aspects of our imperfect
representative government at

Stanford and in the country as a
whole. But Marx has little to offer
us in this regard. I think we
should leave Marx in his grave to
laugh alone. Democracy should
be able to endure his uncreden
tialed cynicism.

Director lacks
sincerity
Last week the ASSU Senate
voted to support the grape
boycott organized by the United
Farm Workers and called on Uni
versity Food Service to remove
grapes from the Stanford
campus. Yet Food Service Direc
tor Jim Keeton continues to
refuse to take the boycott
seriously. Keeton responded to
the vote by telling a MEChA repre
sentative that the senate does not
represent the Stanford students.
Keeton's statement appears
both ill-informed and conde
scending. Who, we wonder, does
represent the students? What
right does he have to claim to
know better than the students
themselves who represents their
interests?
Keeton's patronizing attitude
has been apparent since MEChA
and Student Labor Support Com
mittee representatives first ap
proached him last quarter with a
request to consider the issue of
the grape boycott. Although he
declined to take a firm stance,
Keeton promised to conduct his
own research on the issue.
Six weeks later, when we met
with him again, he had failed to
carry out his promise. Although
he admitted that he had obtained
no further information on the
boycott, Keeton now stated that
he did not find the evidence
documenting the harmful effects
of the pesticides used on grapes
to be conclusive.
That Keeton could make such a
claim while simultaneously ad
mitting to have done no research
on the matter demonstrates his
lack of respect for the intelligence
of the students supporting the
boycott. His failure to find any
information after six weeks
demonstrates his lack of sin
cerity.

We are tired of Keeton's conde
scending attitude. The issue of
the grape boycott is a serious one:
The pesticides used on grapes
threaten the health of
farmworkers and consumers
alike. Keeton or his superiors
must take a firm stand on the
issue once and for all.

Bad attitude
During the last 10 days, I have
been very distressed by the gen
eral reaction to the police crack
down on alcohol consumption by
underage students.
My concern is not whether the
drinking age is just or whether
students at Stanford should be
allowed to make their own deci
sions about alcohol. Rather, my
concern is with the common
attitude that without alcohol, we
can't have parties anymore and
Stanford won't be any fun.
Don't get me wrong — I'm not
some teetotaler on a crusade
against drinking. I just don't
think it should be. or must be,
the center of our social life. Too
many people here feel that with
out a few drinks they can't have a
good time.
David Dunshee's death il
luminates the fact that alcohol is
a serious problem at Stanford.
The damage it creates in terms of
health and property is pervasive
— think of the fight during Rush
in front of the Delta Upsilon
house last year, the damage to
dorms and fraternities caused by
drunk students and the number
of students whose lives are af
fected by alcoholism. Offhand. I
could name about 10 people I
know at Stanford who have
serious drinking problems, and if
you look carefully at your friends
and acquaintances you'll probably
find a similar situation.
I wouldn't want to see alcohol
banned at Stanford — I don't
think that would stop it from
being a problem — but I do think
we should stop overreacting to
the stricter alcohol policy. We
need to address the problems
alcohol causes and learn to keep
partying and having a great time
with or without it.
