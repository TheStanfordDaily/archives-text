### MORTY POSNER Editorial staff 
In the presence of the foreign
ministers of North America, a
crowd of 7,000 endured 100-
degree heat in the Quad yesterday
to commemorate the 100 th an
niversary of the laying of the Uni
versity's cornerstone.
U.S. Secretary of State George
Shultz, Canadian Secretary of
State for External Affairs Joe
Clark and Mexican Secretary of
Foreign Atiairs Bernardo Sepul
veda Amor each warned of com
placency in relations with the
Pacific Rim.
Citing the importance of com
mitments to sustaining competi
tion. economic growth, peace and
stability in the Pacific Rim, Shultz
said, "The dramatic nature of
change in today's world makes
complacency dangerous."
This sentiment was echoed by
Clark, who noted that North
America economic power had
created the "dangerous illusion
that we are invulnerable. . . . The
most fundamental economic chal
lenge modern Asia offers North
America is the challenge to our
complacency."
Shultz, who is currently on
leave from his appointment as
Jack Steele Parker professor of in
ternational economics at Stan
ford's Graduate School of Busi
ness, emphasized the diminish
ing role of the United States in the
world economy.
"In years past, a vigorous and
open American economy served as
the major engine of global
growth," Shultz said. "The United
States cannot continue to perform
this function alone."

Shultz mentioned several ways
in which the nations of the Pacific
Rim could contribute to continu
ing economic growth.
Singling out Japan, he noted
that Japanese leaders recognize
that "it is especially important
that Japan move away from ex
cessive reliance upon exports and
to domestically led growth."
Korea and Taiwan could also
help economic growth in the
region by "changing their own
policies of restricted financial
markets, closed import regimes
and managed exchange rates."
Shultz said.
In addition, Shultz placed re
sponsibility with the American
people to open markets.
"We have to resist energetically
unwise efforts with the Congress
to impose protectionist measures
on trade," he said. "We, as a na
tion. must reduce our federal
budget deficit and encourage
greater domestic savings and in
vestment."
Shultz also reaffirmed Amer
ica's commitment to encouraging
"democratic political forces
throughout the region."
"The United .States believes that
democratic rights and forms of
government are both an incentive
for and guarantor of stability and
growth," Shultz said. "We will not
meddle in the internal affairs of
others." He added that the United
States "will remain concerned
about persistent violations of
human rights, wherever and
whenever they occur."
Sepulveda stressed that the best
interests of the region "may be
better served bv the establishment

of a peace area as a system of
cooperation, peace and security."
As examples, Sepulveda referred
to nuclear-free zones established
in the South Pacific and Latin
America by the Rarotonga and
Tlatelolco treaties and the recent
proposal to make the South
Pacific a "peace zone."
Expressing dismay at the
"massive buildup of Soviet nu
clear and conventional forces in
Asia," Shultz stated, "It's only
through strength and solidarity
that democracies are able to con
vince expansionist powers that
adventurism and excessive mili
tary buildups offer no easy
rewards."
Clark was the only speaker in
terupted by applause when he
spoke on Canada's military role in
the Pacific Rim.
"We share the concern of our
friends about the Soviet buildup
in the Pacific, and are seeking to
improve our ability to meet our re
sponsibilities in all three of
Canada's oceans," he said.
Demonstrators peacefully held
up signs in protest of U.S. policy
in Central America. Noting
placards with slogans like "Close
Down the Contras" and "Mr.
Shultz: U.S. Out Of Central

America," Clark joked that he was
thankful for Shultz's "inviting me
to a meeting where the protest
signs are for somebody else."
The three foreign ministers met
yesterday morning at Shultz'
home at 776 Dolores on the Stan
ford campus in a first-ever joint
meeting of the diplomats.
Shultz characterized the
meeting as "a very informal ses
sion with none of the usual
diplomatic trappings. Just sitting
around in the Stanford sunshine.
Just good friends sitting down to
talk frankly and seriously."
Shultz said he was struck that
the occasion of the Centennial
brought the three countries to
meet "without the constraints of
protocol."
"Perhaps we should just call
ourselves 'The Stanford Trio,' and
get together unofficially under
that name," he mused.
No statement has been released
on the content of the discussions
of the three diplomats.
The ceremony, which com
memorated the centennial of the
laying of the University's corner
stone, included the presentation
of a commemorative centennial
plaque. Stanford Historical Soci
ety President H. Donald Winbigler
presented the plaque to Board of
Trustees President Warren Chris
topher.
The plaque will be installed on
Sunday, May 31.

ford campus in a first-ever joint
meeting of the diplomats.
Shultz characterized the
meeting as "a very informal ses
sion with none of the usual
diplomatic trappings. Just sitting
around in the Stanford sunshine.
Just good friends sitting down to
talk frankly and seriously."
Shultz said he was struck that
the occasion of the Centennial
brought the three countries to
meet "without the constraints of
protocol."
"Perhaps we should just call
ourselves 'The Stanford Trio,' and
get together unofficially under
that name," he mused.
No statement has been released
on the content of the discussions
of the three diplomats.
The ceremony, which com
memorated the centennial of the
laying of the University's corner
stone, included the presentation
of a commemorative centennial
plaque. Stanford Historical Soci
ety President H. Donald Winbigler
presented the plaque to Board of
Trustees President Warren Chris
topher.
The plaque will be installed on
Sunday, May 31.
In the presence of the foreign
ministers of North America, a
crowd of 7,000 endured 100-
degree heat in the Quad yesterday
to commemorate the 100 th an
niversary of the laying of the Uni
versity's cornerstone.
U.S. Secretary of State George
Shultz, Canadian Secretary of
State for External Affairs Joe
Clark and Mexican Secretary of
Foreign Atiairs Bernardo Sepul
veda Amor each warned of com
placency in relations with the
Pacific Rim.
Citing the importance of com
mitments to sustaining competi
tion. economic growth, peace and
stability in the Pacific Rim, Shultz
said, "The dramatic nature of
change in today's world makes
complacency dangerous."
This sentiment was echoed by
Clark, who noted that North
America economic power had
created the "dangerous illusion
that we are invulnerable. . . . The
most fundamental economic chal
lenge modern Asia offers North
America is the challenge to our
complacency."
Shultz, who is currently on
leave from his appointment as
Jack Steele Parker professor of in
ternational economics at Stan
ford's Graduate School of Busi
ness, emphasized the diminish
ing role of the United States in the
world economy.
"In years past, a vigorous and
open American economy served as
the major engine of global
growth," Shultz said. "The United
States cannot continue to perform
this function alone."

Shultz mentioned several ways
in which the nations of the Pacific
Rim could contribute to continu
ing economic growth.
Singling out Japan, he noted
that Japanese leaders recognize
that "it is especially important
that Japan move away from ex
cessive reliance upon exports and
to domestically led growth."
Korea and Taiwan could also
help economic growth in the
region by "changing their own
policies of restricted financial
markets, closed import regimes
and managed exchange rates."
Shultz said.
In addition, Shultz placed re
sponsibility with the American
people to open markets.
"We have to resist energetically
unwise efforts with the Congress
to impose protectionist measures
on trade," he said. "We, as a na
tion. must reduce our federal
budget deficit and encourage
greater domestic savings and in
vestment."
Shultz also reaffirmed Amer
ica's commitment to encouraging
"democratic political forces
throughout the region."
"The United .States believes that
democratic rights and forms of
government are both an incentive
for and guarantor of stability and
growth," Shultz said. "We will not
meddle in the internal affairs of
others." He added that the United
States "will remain concerned
about persistent violations of
human rights, wherever and
whenever they occur."
Sepulveda stressed that the best
interests of the region "may be
better served bv the establishment

of a peace area as a system of
cooperation, peace and security."
As examples, Sepulveda referred
to nuclear-free zones established
in the South Pacific and Latin
America by the Rarotonga and
Tlatelolco treaties and the recent
proposal to make the South
Pacific a "peace zone."
Expressing dismay at the
"massive buildup of Soviet nu
clear and conventional forces in
Asia," Shultz stated, "It's only
through strength and solidarity
that democracies are able to con
vince expansionist powers that
adventurism and excessive mili
tary buildups offer no easy
rewards."
Clark was the only speaker in
terupted by applause when he
spoke on Canada's military role in
the Pacific Rim.
"We share the concern of our
friends about the Soviet buildup
in the Pacific, and are seeking to
improve our ability to meet our re
sponsibilities in all three of
Canada's oceans," he said.
Demonstrators peacefully held
up signs in protest of U.S. policy
in Central America. Noting
placards with slogans like "Close
Down the Contras" and "Mr.
Shultz: U.S. Out Of Central

America," Clark joked that he was
thankful for Shultz's "inviting me
to a meeting where the protest
signs are for somebody else."
