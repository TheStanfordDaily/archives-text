## A
						video to write home about 
### BRYAN COOPERRIDER Staff writer 
It's been a century in the making, but now
you can relive Stanford's first 100 years in 45
minutes of videotape.
Two Stanford sophomores. Brad Geer and
Casey Pittock, plan to market a video showing
Stanford's first 100 years.
Geer, an economics major, came up with the
idea while filming a video of the campus for his
grandparents. "My grandparents have never
been to Stanford. They were curious what It
was like, so I made them a video," Geer said.
"It went over well with the relatives, so I
thought that other students might be inter
ested in sending a video of Stanford to their
relatives. This time we've hired a professional
team to do the filming," Geer said.
The video will include material from the Ar
chives, such as old pictures of the Quad —
before and after the earthquake of 1906 — old

sports pictures, video footage of the Band and
the Dollies, and of course, The Play of the 1982
Big Game.
Interviews with Nancy Young, a 1961 Dollle.
Bob Murphy, the Stanford basketball and foot
ball sports announcer, a "500" woman (before
1933 only 500 women were admitted per year),
other alumni and students will also be In
cluded In the video.
"We're trying to capture Stanford from a stu
dent's prospective." Geer said. "We're also
trying to capture what Stanford is really like
and how it has changed."
"There's a lot of interesting stuff that used to
go on around here," Pittoch said about Stan
ford's history.
"It's a lot more work than we anticipated,
though," Geer said. "There's so many people to
go through to get what you need."
An advertisement has already been placed in
the Stanford Magazine, and fliers are up
around campus. "We're committed, so we have

to make something," Pittoch said. "They'll be
done by graduation."
Pittoch also pointed out that making the
video has given them the opportunity to
promote the school. "We're hoping that high
school guidance counselors will buy the videos
to show prospective freshmen."
Geer and Pittoch are both members of the
varsity golf team. Plttock recalls that they first
met at a golf tournament In Vermont after
their junior year in high school. "It's funny we
ended up at the same university." Pittock said.
Between golfing and studying, Geer and Plt
tock have formed a partnership they've named
"Peer Promotions." Geer explained: "His name
is Pittock and mine's Geer. Put them together
and you get Peer." Pittock added. "It's also
about and for peers."
The partners said they hope to make some
thing of their business venture and keep it
going. "We're looking for promotion-marketing
in the long run," Pittoch said.
