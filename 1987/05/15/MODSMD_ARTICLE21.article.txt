# From country boys to band members
## 
### MARCUS MABRY Senior staff writer 
There once was a simple
country boy from Ames. lowa who
grew up with one hope, one dream
that occupied his every waking
moment and became reality every
time he lay his head down to rest.
The dream was to play in a rock
band.
Well, that's not exactly the way it
happened — but it's close enough.
Stanford sophomore John Lee
does call the Hawkeye State home,
but he's hardly a country
bumpkin. And as proof of his
wordly chic and all-around good
taste, he offers "The Fugitive
Guys."
Lee's own original conception,
The Fugitive Guys, is one of the
hottest new bands on campus and
brings a fresh and unassuming
attitude to the Stanford band
scene.
Bringing to the stage a highly
interactive style, an extremely
youthful and energetic perfor
mance and clean-cut members
whose good looks are fresh and in
nocent, The Fugitive Guys seem to
be just what Stanford has been
waiting for.

The real success of the band
comes from the combination of its
"junior-high-school excitement"
and energy, and Its power and tal
ent.
They may look young and fresh,
but all the members of this band
are experienced musicians. All of
them played in bands in high
school and began their musical
training during the early years of
elementary school.
Bass player Jim Eliassen, a
junior who hails from Houston,
Tex., began his training in the
violin and the classical bass, while
lead vocalist Casey Corum, a soph
omore from Hanover, N.H., has
training in classical guitar. Lee
has also received training in clas
sical piano since kindergarten.
The rest of the band roster con
sists of freshman Bob Burlinson,
lead guitar; senior Jeff Wang,
guitar; sophomore Warren Pack
ard, drums; junior Louis Adamo,
sound; and a recently added
saxophonist, sophomore Scott
Murdoch.
Founder Lee said he wanted to
start a band at Stanford before he
even arrived. He was in a band at
Ames High as a junior, and he

wanted to continue with the en
deavor.
His high-school band played
only four shows, had a core of 40
songs and received *100 per
show. By contrast. The Fugitive
Guys Is booked every weekend this
quarter, has an ever-increasing
repetoire of dance music (ranging
from The Beatles to Aztec Camera)
that now totals 70 songs and
receives at least >250 per show.
Lee says he founded the band
freshman year because there was
an emptiness in his life at Stan
ford. He put himself in the Stan
ford Musicians Directory.
After two attempts at joining
bands, Lee decided to use the
directory to find members for his
own band.
From there, he discovered all
the members except freshman
Burlinson and newly acquired
Murdoch.
Lee asserts that cohesion Is of
crucial Importance to the band,
and Burlinson says that because
they like one another they can
overcome the difficulties that
result from having different indi
vidual musical tastes.

"Cohesion is positive valuation
of the group, and a desire to
remain within," Lee says. He later
said this definition was from Asst.
Industrial Engineering Prof. Kath
leen Eisenhart.
The Fugitive Guys was not or
ganized into its present member
ship until November 1986. The
band played its first show, Flo
Mo's Winter Wasteland, in
February in front of about 300
people.
Predictably, starting out was
difficult. "We got relly reamed the
first few gigs we played," Lee says.
"Early on, because we needed a
chance to play, we were getting of
fers that were dirt."
He says for their first show the
band received only *200 for a
three-hour performance.
"It takes a lot to get any respect
as a campus band. It takes a lot of
experience and performance," Lee
says. "Maybe we come across as
guys who can get reamed. None of
us are big, except Jim (Eliassen),
and he's quiet."
But after a rocky start, the
group took off. It began spring
quarter by playing the surpris
ingly successful Quadrophenia
Party at Sterling Quad and now
boasts a booking every weekend
this quarter, including a perfor
mance at the Oxford Ball a few
weeks ago.
Burlinson says much of the
band's success is attributable to
the fact that it does not put up a
wall of ego between Itself and its
audience.
A distinctive aspect of the band
is its interaction with the audi
ence. he says, noting that it does
not present a pretentious atti
tude. He says the band and the au
dience have fun "together."
"We enjoy dancing to the music
as much as they do." says Pack
ard.
"The best (professional) bands
interact a lot with the audience.
You can't achieve the same type of
interaction playing for dances,
but I think it's key to play to, not
with, the audience,'' Lee said.
Lee says that some other
campus bands may play "cleaner,"
but they seem "to be playing for a
different reason, more like, 'We're
playing because you hired us to
play, rather than we're playing be
cause we love to play.' "
Lee says the band had a
decreased level of composure
during winter quarter. "But we're
now a lot more comfortable and a
lot more confident and can enjoy
what we're doing more. You come
out and no one's ever heard you
before and maybe we all look like a

bunch of lreshmen, so people say.
'Why should we pay you. you guys
should play for free."
"It takes a lot of time to settle
yourself into a foundation where
you can say, 'Hell, we've played
here and here and here. This is
how much we want, you pay us
that or else we're not going to
play, Lee says. "We're almost
there."
He says monetary reward has
been a strong point of disagree
ment within the band because
some members would like to play
where they can. regardless of fin
ancial return.
Burlinson says the enjoyment of
playing is all that matters, but
Eliassen claims, "It's the money."
All members agree that the band
is the most Important thing in
their Stanford lives — after
classes. They say they do resent
the amount of time that classes
keep them from practicing and
improving their collective sound,
but no one says he would sacrifice
coursework for music.
None of the members plan to
become professional musicians,
though Oorum will be wandering
around Europe performing street
shows with a (riend this summer.
"If I thought I had the chance to
make It writing and playing music
professionally, I would do it." Lee
says. "But not only don't I know if
I have the talent, the whole field is
so ridiculous — it's so screwed up
— that you don't know who's
going to make it."
Other members echo this
lecling that more secure careers
are in their future. One member
says that ii academics didn't come
first, he wouldn't be at a school
like Stanford.
