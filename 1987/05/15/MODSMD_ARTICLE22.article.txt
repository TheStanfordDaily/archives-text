Those who find the role of starving student
wearing thin should try living the good life for a while
at Corintia. the fabulous dining experience at the
Ramada Renaissance Hotel in downtown San Fran
cisco.
The maitre d'hotel quickly and subtly sets the tone
for the evening by welcoming each guest personally
and courteously.
Service and quality are the watchwords of this es
tablishment. Having opened just three years ago, it
is clear that the Corintia is out to make a name for it
self.
The guests can choose from a wide variety of ap
petizers and entrees. The entrees range from filet of
Veal Rosemarv at *19.50 to Chateaubriand at $38.
Our selection for the evening — the specialty of the
house, the experience not to be missed — was the
Vintner's Dinner. At $40 per person, this five-course
meal is truly incredible.
The specially prepared Vintner's Dinner, changed
every two weeks, consists of five dishes and four Call

fornia wines. The wines and foods have been selected
for their style, taste and complementary nature.
The meal began with fresh lobster cocktail in
tomato mousseline. This was accompanied by
Robert Pecota's 1985 Sauvignon Blanc. The tomato
and cream sauce nicely balanced the lobster and was
excellent with the rich, full-bodied flavor of the wine.
Next we were treated to the double chicken con
somme — without a doubt the best broth I have ever
tasted. The consomme was topped with a grilled
lemon sauce and was served with Domaine Laurier's
1985 Chardonnay. The combination was pleasantly
surprising, and even following the lobster cocktail,
left plenty of room for the delicacies to come.
The entree was delicious but unusual - sauteed
filet of veal, sweetbread and kidney with mushroom
risotto and sauce chanterelle. Like most Americans. I
am less than fond of dining on strange animal or
gans. but I was astonished by the flavor and texture
of both the sweetbread and the kidney. The veal was
as delicious as I had hoped. After the meal, the chef
assured us that after this menu (which ends May
16), he will be preparing less esoteric dishes.
The sauce was perfect and the vegetables served on
a separate dish were nice touches. The third wine,

Pine Ridge's 1984 Merlot, was nicely woody and quite
superb in combination with the entree.
The salad, a light follower to the main course, con
sisted of hearts of butter lettuce with thin slices of
artichokes covered in a fresh vinaigrette. It served
well as the precursor to the dessert.
Accompanied by J. Lohr's 1985 Johannesberg
Riesling, the crepes stuffed with pear and straw
berries were every bit as good as expected. The fruity,

crisp flavor of the Riesling mixed well with the fruits
and sauce of the crepes. They were light and fluffy -
in a word, perfect.
The courteous and attentive yet never overbearing
service did not end with the meal. Our coffee and
apertifs were served while we leisurely took in the
muted sounds from the piano bar as they floated
past the velvet-covered walls and marble accents of
the restaurant, the perfect end to a perfect evening.
