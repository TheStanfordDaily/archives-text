## Stalking Cardinal whitewashes USC, 9-0 UCLA next for defending champs 
### KEN STEVENS Senior staff writer 
LOS ANGELES — Ho-hum victories are common
for the Stanford women's tennis team In the first
round of NCAA tournament play.
But not even Frank Brennan, the Cardinal head
coach and eternal optimist, could have expected
what happened yesterday at the UCLA/Los Angeles
Tennis Center: a 9-0 whitewash of USC that served
notice to the rest of the 16-team field that the Card
inal will not easily surrender its NCAA crown this
weekend.
"1 cannot believe we clinched in singles." Stanford
sophomore Eleni Rossides said as she watched the
Cardinal doubles teams complete the shutout.
USC Coach Dave Borelli probably could not believe
what he saw yesterday either. In 13 years at the helm
oi the Trojans. Borelli had never lost by a 9-0 score.
While earlier in the week Stanford had bemoaned
its tough tournament draw. Borelli does not think
that the Cardinal should lose any sleep while defend
ing its title. "1 tell ya. I bet my money on Stanford." he
said. If they play like this the rest of the tourna
ment, I don't think it's even going to be close."
The fourth-seeded Cardinal improved to 19-4 on
the season and will meet fifth-seeded UCLA today at
4 p.m. in one quarterfinal. Thirteenth-seeded USC, a
finalist in eight of the last 10 seasons, finished the
year at 14-13.
If Rossides and (Leigh Anne) Eldredge are playing
up to their ability, here's the trophy and why play?"
Borelli said.
"Obviously we've been struggling with Eleni and
Leigh Anne, and now I think we might have just
made it," Brennan said.
Rossides and Eldredge were the Cardinal's two
question marks in singles going into the tourna
ment. Both have been fighting back from stress
fracture injuries, and both were defeated handily in
Stanford's last dual match on May 1 at California.
Yesterday, however, both gave very encouraging
performances. Rossides looked like a completely dif
ferent player than the one who lost two weeks ago at
Berkeley. She came out strong and bested USC's
Luplta Novelo 6-1. 6-4 in the No. 5 singles match.
"I felt really good moving — my legs were fine,"
Rossides said. "I felt a little tentative on my strokes. I
was a little nervous. I want to be a little more aggres
sive than I was."
Eldredge was pitted in the No. 6 match against
Trojan Mary Norwood, who is normally USC's
second-best player but has been injured for most of

the season. Norwood got a step on Eldredge, but the
Cardinal senior rebounded for a 3-6. 7-6 (7-4), 6-2
victory.
Freshman Lisa Green gave the Cardinal a quick 1-
0 lead yesterday, pounding Ginny Purdy 6-2, 6-2 in
the No. 3 singles. Junior Kay Tittle extended the
Stanford advantage with a 6-2, 6-3 win over USC's
Anya Kochoff in the No. 4 match.
"According to Karyn (Stanford Asst. Coach
Copeland). Kay played a great, great match," Bren
nan said.
Patty Fendick did not play up to her usual stand
ards, but still outclassed the Trojans' Maeve Quinlan
for a 6-3, 6-2 victory in the No. 1 singles. Quinlan is
one of only two players to have won a set off of Fen
dick so far this season, accomplishing that on April 4
at Stanford.
Rossides' win put the Cardinal up 4-0, and Stepha
nie Savides clinched the match with a 6-1, 5-7, 6-4
victory against Stephanie Harges in the No. 2
singles.
Savides lost all four of her singles matches in last
year's NCAA team tournament, but she tried not to
think about that yesterday."I was trying to think of
the match." she said. "1 knew 1 could beat her. Ever
since the Berkeley match I've felt a lot better. I'm hit
ting my strokes harder."
The senior tri-captain held a lead before losing the
second set, but she refused to crumble in the final
set. "I was definitely pretty mad," she said. "I knew I
played very well the first set. At first I was a little
worried. The difference was I felt better. I felt I was
playing better than her."
After Eldredge's victory finished the singles
matches, the Cardinal captured all of the doubles
without much of a challenge. It was the third time in
as many matches this season that Stanford has
swept the Trojans in doubles.
The Cardinal's new No. 3 team of Green and Cindy
Buchsbaum rolled past Kathy McGarrigle and Kath
leen Reed 6-1. 6-2 for their first win of the season.
Eldredge and Tittle also posted their first victory of
the season, knocking off Quinlan and Harges 6-0, 6-
3 in the No. 2 doubles. Fendick and Savides com
pleted the shutout with a 6-3, 7-6 (7-3) win over
Purdy and Novelo at the No. 1 doubles spot.
Looking to today's match, during the regular
season, UCLA and Stanford split. The Bruins won 5-
4 at Stanford, while the Cardinal returned the favor
in Los Angeles, winning 5-4.
If Stanford should win today, Brennan and com
pany will probably face No. 1 Florida in the semi

finals on Saturday, with No. 3 California looming in
the finals on Sunday.
In other matches yesterday, in Stanford's half of
the draw Florida defeated No. 16 Harvard 8-1. No. 9
Northwestern beat Indiana 5-4, and UCLA downed
No. 12 Kentucky 5-1.

In the lower half of the draw, No. 15 Georgia upset
No. 2 Miami 5-4, and No. 7 Trinity defeated No. 10
Texas 5-3. No. 11 Southern Methodist beat Brigham
Young 6-3 and the Golden Bears of Berkeley defeated
No. 14 Oklahoma State 5-1.
The Individual competition begins Monday.
