# Card nine preps for regional by hosting Trojans
## 
### TOM SENF Senior staff writer 
At the beginning of the Pacific
10 Southern Division season, this
weekend's season-closing series
between Stanford and USC
figured to be a crucial one. It is,
but not for the team most would
have thought.
It was expected that Stanford
would be battling for the Six-Pac
title while USC. picked to finish
toward the middle or the back of
the conference pack, would be
trying to bring the crown south
for UCLA. The Cardinal, however,
will be the team playing spoiler
this weekend at Sunken Dia
mond. The series begins today at
2:30 p.m. and continues with 1
p.m. contests tomorrow and Sun
day.
Stanford (18-9, 41-16) has
already clinched the division title
and will host the West I Regional
over Memorial Day weekend. USC,
though, still has something to
play for. One win this weekend
will allow the fifth-place Trojans
(12-15, 32-25) to escape the con
ference cellar, and USC also has
an outside shot at grabbing an at
large regional berth.
"If they swept us. and Arizona
State won two out of three
(against Arizona), they would be
In third place." Stanford Coach
Mark Marquess said. "They've got
a lot riding on this weekend, so we
expect them to come out and play
hard."
Because of the Slx-Pac's reputa
tion as the nation's toughest con
ference. Marquess, a member of
the NCAA selection committee, ex
pects three teams to reach the
tournament. Last year Arizona
finished third in the Six-Pac and
won the College World Series.
Sweeping Stanford at Sunken
Diamond, where the Cardinal is
11-1 in league play, will be no easy
task. Stanford is the only Six-Pac
team that has not been swept this
year.
"We've played very consistent
baseball." Marquess said. "We
haven't been way up or way down.
When we've had to win a big game,
we've won it. All season we've been
consistent In all phases of the
game, and that has been the key
to our season."
And don't expect the Cardinal to
take it easy this weekend. "We
don't want to go into regionals
after a losing weekend." Marquess
said. "Even though we don't have

to win these games, we want to
make sure we're playing our best
baseball going into regionals."
Despite the team's success this
season. Marquess believes the
Cardinal can raise its level of play
a notch higher, especially on the
mound. "Based on past perfor
mances. we can pitch better than
we have, and I think we will," he
said. "We're not playing our best
baseball right now, and that's
something for us to shoot for this
weekend."
One Cardinal who has quietly
been playing his best baseball of
late is senior shortstop David
Esquer. Esquer is making himself
a serious candidate for All Six-Pac
honors — he has a nine-game hit
ting streak and has eight straight
multiple-hit games, which raises
his average to .328. Esquer has
also committed just 12 errors in
55 games, a figure that compares
very favorably with other Six-Pac
shortstops.
Jack McDowell (8-4, 4.73 ERA)
will start today for the Cardinal. In
his last outing against USC.
McDowell threw a two-hit
shutout. Should he repeat that
April 3 performance, which in
cluded 13 strikeouts. McDowell
will move to within one strikeout
of Jeff Ballard's school record of
315.
Lee Plemel (8-5. 3.34) will get
the call tomorrow, but Sunday's
starter will depend on whom the
Cardinal coaches feel will fare best
after watching the Trojans the
first two games.
"We've got a lot of flexibility
there," Marquess said, listing A 1
Osuna, Rob Wassenaar, Jim Price
and Brian Keyser as possible
starters. Marquess plans to rotate
his No. 3 starter throughout
postseason play as well.
USC's strength is its pitching
staff, which leads the Six-Pac with
a 3.98 ERA to Stanford's 4.02.
The Trojans will probably send
Randy Powers (6-5. 3.65) to the
mound today with Darrin Beer (6-
7. 4.06) throwing tomorrow. Like
Stanford. USC's Sunday starter
has not been decided.
Stanford would be well-advised
to take the lead early against USC.
because the Trojans boast prob
ably the nation's top reliever in
Brian Nichols. Nichols is 4-0 with
17 saves and has a 0.72 ERA this
year. In his only start of the
season, he threw a complete game
to beat Stanford 3-1 on April 5.
KZSU will broadcast all three of

(his weekend's games, with David
Fisher calling the action.
Card notes
Marquess said that designated hit
ter Jeff Saenger, originally thought to
be out for the year with a neck injury,
may be able to begin working out late
next week and could be ready to play at
the College World Series should Stan
ford get there.
Arizona and Arizona State, tied for

third In the Slx-Pac at 13-14. meet
this weekend for a three-game series
In Teinpe. Not only will the winner of
that series likely get a regional berth.
It could host a regional as well.
"Both of them put In competitive
bids." Marquess said. "It depends on
how many other teams In the West
make it. If there's only about six. they
probably wouldn't put another
regional out there, but If 10 or 12
make It, you could see one of them
host."

Stanford moved up to the No. 2 slot
In the Baseball America poll this week,
while staying at No. 6 In the Collegiate
Baseball/ESPN rankings. The Trojans
are not ranked In either poll. UCLA Is
the only other Slx-Pac team In the
rankings, at No. 15 In Baseball
America and No. 19 In Collegiate
Baseball/ESPN.
All session passes for next
weekend's West I Regional at Sunken
Diamond go on sale today at the Athle

Arizona and Arizona State, tied for

third In the Slx-Pac at 13-14. meet
this weekend for a three-game series
In Teinpe. Not only will the winner of
that series likely get a regional berth.
It could host a regional as well.
"Both of them put In competitive
bids." Marquess said. "It depends on
how many other teams In the West
make it. If there's only about six. they
probably wouldn't put another
regional out there, but If 10 or 12
make It, you could see one of them
host."

Stanford moved up to the No. 2 slot
In the Baseball America poll this week,
while staying at No. 6 In the Collegiate

are not ranked In either poll. UCLA Is

Cardinal hurler Jack McDowell will take to the mound this afternoon against the Trojans of USC.
McDowell and his teammates have already clinched the Six-Pac title and will be hosting the West I
Regional next weekend.
At the beginning of the Pacific
10 Southern Division season, this
weekend's season-closing series
between Stanford and USC
figured to be a crucial one. It is,
but not for the team most would
have thought.
It was expected that Stanford
would be battling for the Six-Pac
title while USC. picked to finish
toward the middle or the back of
the conference pack, would be
trying to bring the crown south
for UCLA. The Cardinal, however,
will be the team playing spoiler
this weekend at Sunken Dia
mond. The series begins today at
2:30 p.m. and continues with 1
p.m. contests tomorrow and Sun
day.
Stanford (18-9, 41-16) has
already clinched the division title
and will host the West I Regional
over Memorial Day weekend. USC,
though, still has something to
play for. One win this weekend
will allow the fifth-place Trojans
(12-15, 32-25) to escape the con
ference cellar, and USC also has
an outside shot at grabbing an at
large regional berth.
"If they swept us. and Arizona
State won two out of three
(against Arizona), they would be
In third place." Stanford Coach
Mark Marquess said. "They've got
a lot riding on this weekend, so we
expect them to come out and play
hard."
Because of the Slx-Pac's reputa
tion as the nation's toughest con
ference. Marquess, a member of
the NCAA selection committee, ex
pects three teams to reach the
tournament. Last year Arizona
finished third in the Six-Pac and
won the College World Series.
Sweeping Stanford at Sunken
Diamond, where the Cardinal is
11-1 in league play, will be no easy
task. Stanford is the only Six-Pac
team that has not been swept this
year.
"We've played very consistent
baseball." Marquess said. "We
haven't been way up or way down.
When we've had to win a big game,
we've won it. All season we've been
consistent In all phases of the
game, and that has been the key
to our season."
And don't expect the Cardinal to
take it easy this weekend. "We
don't want to go into regionals
after a losing weekend." Marquess
said. "Even though we don't have

to win these games, we want to
make sure we're playing our best
baseball going into regionals."
Despite the team's success this
season. Marquess believes the
Cardinal can raise its level of play
a notch higher, especially on the
mound. "Based on past perfor
mances. we can pitch better than
we have, and I think we will," he
said. "We're not playing our best
baseball right now, and that's
something for us to shoot for this
weekend."
One Cardinal who has quietly
been playing his best baseball of
late is senior shortstop David
Esquer. Esquer is making himself
a serious candidate for All Six-Pac
honors — he has a nine-game hit
ting streak and has eight straight
multiple-hit games, which raises
his average to .328. Esquer has
also committed just 12 errors in
55 games, a figure that compares
very favorably with other Six-Pac
shortstops.
Jack McDowell (8-4, 4.73 ERA)
will start today for the Cardinal. In
his last outing against USC.
McDowell threw a two-hit
shutout. Should he repeat that
April 3 performance, which in
cluded 13 strikeouts. McDowell
will move to within one strikeout
of Jeff Ballard's school record of
315.
Lee Plemel (8-5. 3.34) will get
the call tomorrow, but Sunday's
starter will depend on whom the
Cardinal coaches feel will fare best
after watching the Trojans the
first two games.
"We've got a lot of flexibility
there," Marquess said, listing A 1
Osuna, Rob Wassenaar, Jim Price
and Brian Keyser as possible
starters. Marquess plans to rotate
his No. 3 starter throughout
postseason play as well.
USC's strength is its pitching
staff, which leads the Six-Pac with
a 3.98 ERA to Stanford's 4.02.
The Trojans will probably send
Randy Powers (6-5. 3.65) to the
mound today with Darrin Beer (6-
7. 4.06) throwing tomorrow. Like
Stanford. USC's Sunday starter
has not been decided.
Stanford would be well-advised
to take the lead early against USC.
