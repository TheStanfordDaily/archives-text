# Card track travels to Sacramento
## 
### EVAN TUCHINSKY Staff writer 
Divide and conquer is the motto
of the Stanford track team this
weekend.
While senior distance runner
Marc Oleson heads to Los Angeles
to participate in the prestigious
UCLA Pepsi Invitational, the
remaining Cardinal competitors
will be at the Sacramento Relays
looking to improve their position
before next week's Pacific 10 Con
ference championships at Corval
lis. Ore.
The meet in Sacramento does
not appear on Stanford's sche
dule, but will be a significant com
petition nonetheless. "It's basi
cally a tuneup for the Pac-lOs."
Stanford Asst. Coach Dorothy
Doolittle said.
"It gives us a chance to run our
relays and gives us a chance to
sharpen up for Pac-lOs. Also, it
gives a chance for athletes to
qualify for Pac-lOs that haven't
already," she added.
Since the Cardinal has not com
peted in the Sacramento meet
before, the coaching staff is uncer
tain about which teams will be
competing. Doolittle, however, is
sure that the level of competition
will be high.
"I think it's going to be tough,"
she said. "When everyone is trying
to qualify either for NCs (national
championships) or Pac-lOs,
you're going to get some very good
competition. This is serious
stuff."
One of the main focus points
will be the 100 and 200 women's
relays. "We need some experience
in running these events, and every
meet that we compete in will help
us." Doolittle said.
"Some of the athletes like John
Gash (a pole vaulter and hurdler)
will be sitting out. He's going to
rest for Pac-lOs, and he doesn't
need to sharpen any more," she
added.
Decathlete D.D. Harris will also
take a brief vacation, since the
Pac-10 decathlon runs this Mon
day and Tuesday.
Down South. Oleson will be
competing against stiff competi
tion in the UCLA Pepsi Invita
tional. one of the premier col
legiate track and field meets, with
only Asst. Coach Scott Chlsam to
help him. The senior, with Pac-10-
qualifying times of 3:45.63 in the
1.500 meter event and 14:10.50
in the 5.000 as his season bests,
will certainly have a good chance
to do well against the nation's elite
and improve his qualifying times
in the process.
