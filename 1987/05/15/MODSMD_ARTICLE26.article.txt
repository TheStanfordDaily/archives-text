Pull out your inner tubes and trashcan
lids — the "Big O" is back!
Tonight at 7:30 in Maples Pavilion, the
United States National Volleyball Team,
featuring former Stanford star Kim Oden,
will face the Brazilian National Team in the
third round of the Yugo/USA Challenge,
hoping to qualify for the final match Satur
day at University of the Pacific.
The U.S. and Brazil are each 1-1 after
the first two rounds of play, and the victor
tonight will go on to play the Cuban Na
tional Team for the tournament crown.
Cuba, 2-0 and considered to be the No. 1
team on the international scene, will face
the Canadian National Team. 0-2. in the
first match at 6 p.m.
"Brazil was fifth at the last champion
ships, but we beat them In a five-game
match in September "86." U.S. Coach
1 erry Liskevych said. "These are two even
teams.
1 hey (Brazil) have a lot of experience. A
majority played In the '84 Olympics. They
are a really emotional team." he added.
To counter this South American threat.
Liskevych is putting an all-star, power
packed lineup on the floor. Joining Oden
in the middle blocker position will be
Deltre Collins, a three-time All-America for
Hawaii from 1980 to 1983. In addition.
Caren Kemner of Arizona and Liz
Masakayan of UCLA will join high school
sensation Keba Phipps as outside hitters,
and Laurel Kessel-Brassey. who played for
the Dallas Belles in Major League Volleyball
before rejoining the National Team, will be
the starting setter.
Even with personnel of this caliber, the
U.S. will have a definite fight on its hands,
but it's one that Liskevych thinks his team
will be able to win. "We're stronger at the
net and a good side-out team." he said. "
We're top four in the world in siding out.
We'll dominate at the net and stop their
serving."
Oden should help the team in both of
these regards. In the course of her career
at Stanford. Oden set or came close to
breaking the school record In almost everv

statistical category, placing first in 14 dif
ferent categories.
She was also a favorite of the Maples
Pavilion crowd, inspiring fans to hold
various circular objects above their heads
and chant "O."
As the main weapon of the Cardinal of
fense for four years. Oden set the stand
ards for career hitting with 1,751 kills in
3,711 attempts, yielding a .365 hitting
percentage and an average of 4.3 kills per
game.
Oden was equally as devastating in
blocking, amassing a school-record 253
block solos and 411 block assists. She also
holds the single-season records, with her
86 block solos In 1983 — 36 more blocks
than the second-place holder on the career
list — and 134 block assists in 1985.
Add this dominance at the net to her
outstanding serving and back-court
defense and it is easy to sec why this four
time All-America, three-time conference
Player of the Year and two-time NCAA
Player of the Year is a starter for the U.S.
National Team in this pivotal match.
"In the transition game, one of the
strengths of our program for years has
been Kim." said Stanford Women's Volley
ball Coach Don Shaw, who coached Oden
all four of her years on the Farm. "She's
good at hitting in the middle, not only
when they get a good pass in a side-out sit
uation but also in the rally."
Oden's strength in the middle position
should benefit the National Team as
much, if not more, than it did the Stanford
squad. International women's volleyball
traditionally relies on the outside hitters
for scoring. "Kim can give them another
dimension, being able to go to the middle.
"It's a different game out there," Shaw
added. " The teams out there have a lot of
experienced players. Once you get to the
international level, you're dealing with
people that are really experienced and ma
ture, 29 and 30 years old."
Oden agreed. "I never realized what a dif
ferent game it is from college." she said.
"It's a lot quicker — I can't even tell you
how quick it is.
"Everyone is better that you're playing
against, everyone is the best in the world.

Playing against people like that is a lot
tougher than playing against maybe a
weaker link on a college team."
"It's a more intense atmosphere. For In
stance. we practice four hours per day.
from 8 (a.m.) to 12 (noon). Then at 12 you
go grab some lunch, and usually we lift
weights for an hour-and-a-half.
"After an hour-and-a-half. sometimes we
have videos to look at. and we have team
meetings every week," Oden continued.
"Then they have jobs that we can go to. it's
run around, run around, run around."
The team from Brazil will put Oden's
dedication and concentration to the test.

"They're a good team," the middle blocker
noted. "They're very quick, very scrappy,
nothing hits the floor against them.
"For us. our keys will be as usual —
tough serving, hitting high and hard, and
tough blocking. Defense always comes into
it. but if we can do those top three things it
would really be to our advantage."
Another bonus for Oden and her
teammates is the homeeourt and home
country advantage. "Everywhere we've
gone it's been really nice. Even in Hillings.
Montana, people were really supportive.
Everywhere we've been there have been
great crowds.
