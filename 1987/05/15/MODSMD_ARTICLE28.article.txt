A fellowship program aimed at
encouraging minority students to
pursue doctorates has proved suc
cessful In Its first six years.
Eight of 10 Stanford recipients
of Compton Fellowships for
minority doctoral candidates have
received tenure-track appoint
ments at universities, and two
have received research appoint
ments. according to Noe Lozano.
assistant dean of Graduate
Studies.
The fellowships, funded by the
Dorothy Danforth Compton Foun
dation, provide assistance to
minority students working on
doctoral dissertations. They are
directed at. but not limited to, stu
dents interested In teaching at the
university level.
According to Lozano. the pro
gram is an important step toward
increasing minority representa
tion in academla. Presently, only 2
percent of doctorate recipients
nationwide are black, and only 2
percent are Latino.
Since the program's inception
in 1981. 32 Stanford students
have received Compton fellow

ships. Five more students were
recently named recipients for
1987-88.
Lozano said the limitation of the
fellowships to minority students
has not caused the quality of can
didates to decline. "The top people
this year applying for Ph.D. pro
grams were minorities, so It isn't a
question of being qualified." he
said. "We're competing for these
people."
The recipients of Compton Fel
lowships receive >9.750 per year.
Lozano said the foundation will
continue to fund the fellowships
until 1990-91 when, he hopes.
Stanford will absorb the pro
gram's costs.
"These fellowships are in our
best interest." Lozano said. "We
will establish a diverse alumni
group that will become a network
for us. providing more minority
representation."
Compton awards also fund
minority doctoral candidates at
Brown, Columbia, Howard, Van
derbilt, Yale and UCLA, as well as
at the University of Chicago, the
University of Washington and the
University of Texas.
