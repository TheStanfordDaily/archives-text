# Minority students walk out
## 
### JOHN POLLACK Senior staff writer 
While official Cornerstone festivities
proeeeded as planned yesterday, over
300 protesters voieed their concern
about minority issues at a noontime
rally in front of Old Union before march
ing en masse to the Inner Quad. The
protesters later walked in single file out
of the Quad during the speech of U.S.
Secretary of State George Shultz.
University President Donald Kennedy,
reached after the afternoon's cere
monies, said the demonstrators
"displayed their conviction and got their
point across with a minimum of inter
ference with the proceedings."
Many of the protesters carried black
balloons, which they released during
Kennedy's introductory remarks at the
Cornerstone < eremonv. When the sky

was speckled black with over a hundred
of balloons. 288 demonstrators stood
with raised fists, the traditional "black
power" salute.
Kennedy ignored the demonstration
and continued speaking.
Shortly after the balloons were
released, when Emeritus History Prof.
H. Donald Winbigler was Introducing
History Prof. David Kennedy, the dem
onstrators began to chant, "One
hundred years of racism; we demand a
change!"
Later, when Shultz was Introduced,
the group of demonstrators stood up
again and chanted briefly. "Just say No'
to the contras! Just say No' to apart
heid!"
As Shultz began to speak, the demon
strators remained standing with their
fists raised, and then filed out quietly,
one-by-one.

The protesters, led by Black Student
Union Chair Amanda Kemp, took
several minutes to leave the Quad.
Although many in the audience were
distracted. Shultz ignored the protest
and continued to speak.
At the rally three hours earlier, repre
sentatives of campus minority groups
expressed their concern with the Univer
sity Administration's policies on race
related issues and reiterated a series of
demands they issued to Kennedy last
week.
"There are not enough lower income
or inner-city black students on this
campus," said BSU representative Mary
Dillard. "There are not enough black
and minority professors on this
campus. There is not enough active
minority recruitment. ... In sum. there
is not enough diversity on this
campus.
"We live in a country that was
built on a system of racism and
hypocrisy, and Stanford is part of
that system." Dlllard said.
"Stanford does not actively chal
lenge racist Ideals as much as it
helps to maintain the status quo."
Accusing the Administration of
insensitivlty toward campus
minority concerns. Dlllard said
she was both angry and Impatient
for substantive change.
Dillard's sentiments were
echoed by others who spoke at the
rally, which was organized by a
coalition of campus minority
groups known collectively as the
Rainbow Agenda.
Since the Rainbow Agenda pre
sented Kennedy with the
demands, he has appointed a
three-member committee to exam
ine racial issues. The demands in
clude:
□ The establishment of a vlce
provost to oversee minority af
fairs.
□ The creation of a budget for
minority admissions and a sum
mer tutoring program for incom
ing freshmen.
□ A new location for the Asian-
American Activities center and the
creation of an Asian-American as

sistant deanshlp.
□ The Administration's support
of the proposal for the Western
Culture requirement Issued
recently by a task force studying
the requirement.
□ The appointment of an outside
commission to study racism and
the state of minority life at Stan
ford.
□ Total divestment by the Univer
sity of Stanford stock in compan
ies that do business in South
Africa.
Critics of the Rainbow Agenda
charged recently that it Is unrea
sonable to expect the University to
immediately Implement the
demands.
BSU Chairman-elect Bill King
responded to this criticism at the
rally. "We agree that it takes time
(to implement demands). That's
why we asked for them in 1968,"
King said, referring to a similar
protest that occurred at Stanford
in 1968.
"We've given them 20 years,"
King said. "Every time we bring
them (minority concerns) up they
put them under the table."
Senior Sandra Viera, who spoke
at the rally on behalf of MEChA,
the Chlcano student organiza
tion, shared King's perspective.
"For over 20 years students of
color have been recommending,
proposing and suggesting
changes that would make Stan
ford a truly diverse and respon
sible university," Vlera said.

changes that would make Stan
ford a truly diverse and respon
sible university," Vlera said.
