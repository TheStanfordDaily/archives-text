# Summer orientation considered
## 
### ELAINE LU Staff writer 
The Subcommittee on Residential Educa
tion and Advising (SREA) is currently consid
ering a proposed summer orlentaton program
that would help prepare entering freshmen for
life at Stanford.
Although plans are very tentative, the sum
mer orientation would probably have more of
an intellectual and academic environment
than a social focus, said History Prof. Albert
Camarillo, chairman of the SREA. The pro
gram, which would not begin for at least two
years after approval from the Faculty Senate,
would be "absolutely optional," Camarillo said.
The SREA is concerned with "how we can
give (incoming freshmen) the best start" and
assure them that "this is their university, that
they fit here," said Alice Supton, assistant
dean of Residential Education and a member
of the SREA.
Camarillo said the proposed program would

be "geared to basically help people . . . before
they start their career at Stanford."
In particular, Supton said, the program
would help students maximize their success at
Stanford by helping them develop and improve
academic skills â€” Including reading, critical
thinking and mathematics.
Some students need the kind of preparation
that the orientation program would provide
because high schools prepare students for col
lege in different ways, said senior Dixon Os
burn, a member of the SREA.
By holding a summer program, Osburn said,
Stanford may "decrease the disparity" between
the abilities of students entering Stanford,
and put them on a more "equal footing."
Other than the academic focus of the pro
gram, very little has been decided. The SREA
has not discussed when exactly the program
would be held or where participants would live.
The director of the Undergraduate Advising
Center, Audrey Bernfleld, a member of the
SREA, called the Stanford proposal "one idea
that came up" in discussions. The UAC wants

to develop a "variety of programs to help stu
dents do their best at Stanford," she said.
Supton said the summer Institute is being
considered along with many other ideas. Other
proposals with similar goals include programs
during the school year. Supton said, em
phasizing more dorm-based review sessions
and tutoring.
Another way to improve freshmen's critical
thinking skills may involve redefining and re
structuring the traditional freshmen orienta
tion, Supton said.
For example, she said, freshmen may meet
with their Western Culture section leader for
the first time once during orientation week in
order to discuss how to approach the program.
For the summer institute program to be im
plemented. the Committee on Undergraduate
Studies and the Faculty Senate would have to
approve a final proposal by the SREA.
Bernfield said that because plans for the
summer institute are so tentative, discussions
will carry over into next year. "It's just the
beginning of a discussion," Supton said.
