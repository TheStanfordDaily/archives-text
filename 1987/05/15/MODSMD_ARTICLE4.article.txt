# Foreign officials hold first-ever discussion
## 
### STEPHEN KASIERSKI Senior staff writer 
It was a historic meeting without his
toric results.
Although Cornerstone Weekend
celebrants may have been drained by the
intense sunshine and 100-degree tem
peratures. the foreign ministers of
Canada. Mexico and the United States
were probably not exhausted by their
talks here yesterday morning.
The Stanford meeting between Secre
tary of State George Shultz, Canadian
External Affairs Secretary Joe Clark and
Mexican Foreign Relations Secretary
Bernardo Sepuiveda Amor was the first

gathering of the three North American
foreign ministers in history.
The meeting was held at Shultz's
campus home on Dolores Avenue. He ts
currently on leave from his position as
the Jack Steele Parker Professor at Stan
ford's Graduate School of Business.
In his afternoon speech, Shultz des
cribed the meeting as "a very informal
session with none of the usual
diplomatic trappings — just sitting
around in the Stanford sunshine — just
good friends sitting down to talk frankly
and seriously."
It is not vet known what the ministers
discussed. According to a
Canadian official, the discussion
dealt only with general topics.
Although a specific agenda for
the meeting was never released,
the ministers were expected to
discuss tri-lateral issues such as
international economics and
trade.
Because meeting was arranged
by the secretary of state, Shultz
had the option to "lead" the dis
cussion away from specific topics
and could determine whether
statements were released to the
press, the Canadian official said.
Close ties between the three
countries may have contributed to
the dearth of particularly sub
stantive talks. The secretary of
state and the Canadian foreign
secretary have what is considered
to be one of the closest working
relationships on the world
diplomatic front. The Stanford
meeting was added to a regular
schedule of quarterly meetings be
tween Shultz and Clark.
At a morning photo opportu
nity, the ministers exchanged
small talk and walked around the
Shultz residence. To the chagrin
of reporters, the ministers did not
release a statement-
