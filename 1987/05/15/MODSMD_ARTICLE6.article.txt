Peres renews call for Mideast talks
JERUSALEM — Foreign Minister Shimon Peres, visibly disap
pointed by his inability to force the government either to accept
his plan for talks with Jordan or hold new elections, warned yes
terday that Israel would miss an "unprecedented opportunity" for
peace in the Middle East if It fails to endorse a proposed interna
tional conference.
"It is an opportunity which came and may not come again,"
Peres said in an Interview. He said he saw no chance for compro
mise with Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir, who opposes the con
ference. and pledged to gather Knesset votes to bring down Israel's
32-month-old government of national unity.
While Peres said he would make no specific request to Secretary
of State George Shultz when the two meet in New York this
weekend, he said he would support Shultz if the secretary decides
to conduct a diplomatic mission in the region. "All of us have to
try to think hard how not to let the peace process die away, fade
away," said Peres.
Nonetheless, the foreign minister added, "I think the main bat
tlefield is in Israel, not In Washington, and here I intend to go full
steam ahead."
Peres' comments came a day after he backed away from a politi
cal showdown with Shamir over the proposed conference, which
Peres contends would supply a necessary "umbrella" for direct
talks with a joint delegation of Jordan and moderate Palestinians.
He said he had lacked the votes he needed either to force the pro
posal through the 10-member "inner Cabinet" — which is evenly
divided between his Labor Alignment and Shamir's Likud bloc
and adjourned Wednesday without voting on the plan — or to dis
solve the government.
Peres said he is confident he will come up eventually with
enough support in the 120-member Israeli Knesset to force an
early national election, which otherwise is not due until November
1988.
S. Africa expels British journalists
JOHANNESBURG, South Africa — Two British television cor
respondents were ordered yesterday to leave South Africa amid
mounting indications of a further government crackdown on the
news media — foreign and domestic — and on the left-wing oppo
sition.
The correspondents for the British Broadcasting Corp. and In
dependent Television News were told to leave the country within
10 days. The order followed strong government objections to the
BBC and ITN coverage of student clashes with the police here and
in Cape Town over last week's whites-only parliamentary elec
tions.
The expulsion order coincided with news reports of what the
Johannesburg Star, the country's largest daily newspaper, des
cribed as "a sweeping security clampdown on trade unions, uni
versities, organizations using foreign funds for domestic political
purposes and 'alternative media' publications."
Stoffel Botha, the minister of home affairs, gave no reason for
his decision to expel Michael Buerk, 41, the BBC television corre
spondent. and Peter Sharp. 40, of ITN. Both were told that their
work permits would not be renewed.
Both had been told two weeks ago by Stoffel van der Merwe. the
deputy minister for information, that the government thought
their reports on pre-election campus protests and on clashes be
tween police and striking railway workers had violated regulations
that prohibit first-hand coverage of unrest and the filming of
police action.
Enrile protests Philippine elections
MANILA, Philippines — Philippine opposition leaders, led by
former defense minister Juan Ponce Enrile, yesterday escalated
their protest against Monday's congressional election, rallying
20,000 supporters for a demonstration and promising to con
tinue their mass actions until the country becomes
"ungovernable."
With candidates handpieked by President Corazon Aquino ap
parently heading for a near sweep of the new Congress, the losing
opposition candidates have accused the government of
widespread fraud and manipulation of the returns. Their refusal
to recognize the election results could pose a troublesome chal
lenge for Aquino, who had been counting on the elections to end
more than a year of political instability and restore the country's
democratic institutions.
Monday's vote was generally regarded as the first free legislative
election since the years before Marcos declared martial law in
1972.
It remained unclear yesterday exactly what actions the opposi
tion might take. But a sizable vote for opposition candidates from
members of the military led to speculation that some disgruntled
soldiers may join the demonstrations.
Canada plans Arctic arms buildup
TORONTO — The Canadian government, seeking to assert its
sovereignty over the vast Arctic archipelago, is embarking on an
ambitious military buildup that is driven more by a dispute with
its best friend, the United States, than by any perceived threat
from the Soviet Union.
The dispute involves Washington's assertion that the Northwest
Passage, an Arctic waterway through which American military
vessels occasionally pass, is an international waterway and not
part of Canada's internal waters.
U.S. officials have quietly attempted to persuade Canada to
abandon plans for spending billions on a fleet of 10 attack sub
marines to patrol the Arctic. Long exasperated with Canada's
paltry spending on defense generally, American officials are
pleased that Canada now seems willing to spend more. But they
want the money to be used to upgrade and expand its NATO forces
and its commitment to the North American Air Defense Com
mand. the early-warning air surveillance system for the North
American continent.
Biden calls for tougher trade laws
WASHINGTON — Outlining his economic platform as a 1988
White House contender. Democratic Sen. Joseph Biden of Dela
ware yesterday called for tough new trade laws, educational and
financing reforms and mainly vigorous and far-ranging personal
leadership by the next president to reassert U.S. control over its
own national destiny.
"Control over our economic destiny has been endangered."
Biden declared In the first of two speeches to be delivered at the
University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School of Economics and
released here by his campaign office. "The risk is that we will no
longer lead the world: that we will no longer control American jobs
and American assets: that our economy will be held hostage to the
wishes and whims of foreign corporations and foreign powers."
The remedy, he argued, will depend mostly on forceful and inno
vative use of presidential authority and power. Recalling President
Kennedy's personal intervention to force a roll-back of a steel in
dustry price increase. Biden said: "That's what a president should
do today: Call the captains of industry and the chieftains of labor
into his office . . . and say to them. Here's what successful busi
nesses here and abroad are doing. . . . Why don't you go out and
get the job done too?" "

Peres renews call for Mideast talks
JERUSALEM — Foreign Minister Shimon Peres, visibly disap
pointed by his inability to force the government either to accept
his plan for talks with Jordan or hold new elections, warned yes
terday that Israel would miss an "unprecedented opportunity" for
peace in the Middle East if It fails to endorse a proposed interna
tional conference.
"It is an opportunity which came and may not come again,"
Peres said in an Interview. He said he saw no chance for compro
mise with Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir, who opposes the con
ference. and pledged to gather Knesset votes to bring down Israel's
32-month-old government of national unity.
While Peres said he would make no specific request to Secretary
of State George Shultz when the two meet in New York this
weekend, he said he would support Shultz if the secretary decides
to conduct a diplomatic mission in the region. "All of us have to
try to think hard how not to let the peace process die away, fade
away," said Peres.
Nonetheless, the foreign minister added, "I think the main bat
tlefield is in Israel, not In Washington, and here I intend to go full
steam ahead."
Peres' comments came a day after he backed away from a politi
cal showdown with Shamir over the proposed conference, which
Peres contends would supply a necessary "umbrella" for direct
talks with a joint delegation of Jordan and moderate Palestinians.
He said he had lacked the votes he needed either to force the pro
posal through the 10-member "inner Cabinet" — which is evenly
divided between his Labor Alignment and Shamir's Likud bloc
and adjourned Wednesday without voting on the plan — or to dis
solve the government.
Peres said he is confident he will come up eventually with
enough support in the 120-member Israeli Knesset to force an
early national election, which otherwise is not due until November
1988.
S. Africa expels British journalists
JOHANNESBURG, South Africa — Two British television cor
respondents were ordered yesterday to leave South Africa amid
mounting indications of a further government crackdown on the
news media — foreign and domestic — and on the left-wing oppo
sition.
The correspondents for the British Broadcasting Corp. and In
dependent Television News were told to leave the country within
10 days. The order followed strong government objections to the
BBC and ITN coverage of student clashes with the police here and
in Cape Town over last week's whites-only parliamentary elec
tions.
The expulsion order coincided with news reports of what the
Johannesburg Star, the country's largest daily newspaper, des
cribed as "a sweeping security clampdown on trade unions, uni
versities, organizations using foreign funds for domestic political
purposes and 'alternative media' publications."
Stoffel Botha, the minister of home affairs, gave no reason for
his decision to expel Michael Buerk, 41, the BBC television corre
spondent. and Peter Sharp. 40, of ITN. Both were told that their
work permits would not be renewed.
Both had been told two weeks ago by Stoffel van der Merwe. the
deputy minister for information, that the government thought
their reports on pre-election campus protests and on clashes be
tween police and striking railway workers had violated regulations
that prohibit first-hand coverage of unrest and the filming of
police action.
Enrile protests Philippine elections
MANILA, Philippines — Philippine opposition leaders, led by
former defense minister Juan Ponce Enrile, yesterday escalated
their protest against Monday's congressional election, rallying
20,000 supporters for a demonstration and promising to con
tinue their mass actions until the country becomes
"ungovernable."
With candidates handpieked by President Corazon Aquino ap
parently heading for a near sweep of the new Congress, the losing
opposition candidates have accused the government of
widespread fraud and manipulation of the returns. Their refusal
to recognize the election results could pose a troublesome chal
lenge for Aquino, who had been counting on the elections to end
more than a year of political instability and restore the country's
democratic institutions.
Monday's vote was generally regarded as the first free legislative
election since the years before Marcos declared martial law in
1972.
It remained unclear yesterday exactly what actions the opposi
tion might take. But a sizable vote for opposition candidates from
members of the military led to speculation that some disgruntled
soldiers may join the demonstrations.
Canada plans Arctic arms buildup
TORONTO — The Canadian government, seeking to assert its
sovereignty over the vast Arctic archipelago, is embarking on an
ambitious military buildup that is driven more by a dispute with
its best friend, the United States, than by any perceived threat
from the Soviet Union.
The dispute involves Washington's assertion that the Northwest
Passage, an Arctic waterway through which American military
vessels occasionally pass, is an international waterway and not
part of Canada's internal waters.
U.S. officials have quietly attempted to persuade Canada to
abandon plans for spending billions on a fleet of 10 attack sub
marines to patrol the Arctic. Long exasperated with Canada's
paltry spending on defense generally, American officials are
pleased that Canada now seems willing to spend more. But they
want the money to be used to upgrade and expand its NATO forces
and its commitment to the North American Air Defense Com
mand. the early-warning air surveillance system for the North
American continent.
Biden calls for tougher trade laws
WASHINGTON — Outlining his economic platform as a 1988
White House contender. Democratic Sen. Joseph Biden of Dela
ware yesterday called for tough new trade laws, educational and
financing reforms and mainly vigorous and far-ranging personal
leadership by the next president to reassert U.S. control over its
own national destiny.
"Control over our economic destiny has been endangered."
Biden declared In the first of two speeches to be delivered at the
University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School of Economics and
released here by his campaign office. "The risk is that we will no
longer lead the world: that we will no longer control American jobs
and American assets: that our economy will be held hostage to the
wishes and whims of foreign corporations and foreign powers."
The remedy, he argued, will depend mostly on forceful and inno
vative use of presidential authority and power. Recalling President
Kennedy's personal intervention to force a roll-back of a steel in
dustry price increase. Biden said: "That's what a president should
do today: Call the captains of industry and the chieftains of labor
into his office . . . and say to them. Here's what successful busi
nesses here and abroad are doing. . . . Why don't you go out and
