# McFarlane: Reagan was involved
## 
### 
WASHINGTON — Former national security
adviser Robert McFarlane. contradicting White
House denials. Insisted yesterday that Presi
dent Reagan personally approved a secret oper
ation to free U.S. hostages In Lebanon by
paying *2 million in bribes and ransom.
Testifying for the fourth day before House
and Senate panels Investigating the Iran
contra affair. McFarlane said he had discussed
the matter with the president. Vice President
George Bush and "probably Mr. (Donald)
Regan," who was then White House chief of
staff. Attorney General Edwin Meese,
McFarlane added, provided legal clearance for
it. McFarlane said he would have to "think
about" the extent of knowledge by Secretary of
State George Shultz.
Congressional Investigators have pursued
the ransom episode because it apparently In
volved another covert Intelligence operation by
the administration which, contrary to law, was
neither formally authorized with a presidential
"finding" or reported to Congress. It was also
disclosed yesterday that the Central Intelli
gence Agency had donated >50,000 to the proj
ect without the necessary notification to con
gressional watchdogs.
McFarlane's remarks about Reagan's au
thorization of ransom came after White House
spokesman Marlin Fitzwater reported that the
president said he "did not know there was ever
a plan for ransoming hostages," and had never
discussed the matter. Fitzwater reaffirmed the
statement yesterday.
McFarlane said government record-keeping
on the matter had been "fully above board and

In writing." but then added he did not know If
it was "written down on paper or not."A White
House official familiar with the documents
said the president's aides have found no
evidence to support McFarlane's claim that
Reagan approved the ransom plan.
A spokesman for Meese said the attorney
general would have nothing to say yesterday
about the ransom plan. "If and when the attor
ney general Is called to testify before the com
mittees, that will be the appropriate time for
him to discuss this and all other matters," he
said.
McFarlane's four days of testimony con
stantly veered between detailed congressional
questioning on his own activities and
McFarlane's often meandering ruminations on
broad foreign policy questions. When pressed
on particular documents or actions, the
former top foreign policy adviser in the White
House several times lost his usual composure
and responded angrily. He appeared more at
ease when given the chance to philosophize
about government, education and foreign af
fairs.
House committee Chairman Rep. Lee Hamil
ton, D-Ind., summed up by noting the irrecon
cilable "disparity" between McFarlane's broad
appeals for administration honesty in dealing
with Congress, and McFarlane's actual perfor
mance in specific Instances. In which admin
istration activities in Central America were
concealed from legislators.
These discrepancies left members with
enough questions for Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga..
to say late yesterday that some witnesses, In

eluding McFarlane. might be called back to
clear up contradictions.
One significant conflict with McFarlane's
testimony emerged with the very next witness.
Assistant Secretary of State Gaston Sigur Jr.
Sigur said that while working for McFarlane at
the National Security Council (NSC) in the
summer of 1985. Sigur solicited a contribu
tion for the Nlcaraguan contras from an Asian
country and had told the national security ad
viser of his efforts.
Sigur said that in June or July 1985 he was
approached by Lt. Col. Oliver North, then an
NSC aide, who said that "he and Mr.
McFarlane were Interested In finding out what
the situation was" with regard to obtaining a
contribution from "Country Three." identified
privately as Taiwan. When the Taiwan repre
sentative told Sigur that such assistance. If
given, would have to be channeled through the
U.S. government.
But when he reported this stipulation back
to McFarlane, the national security adviser
said the money transfer could not be handled
that way.
Asked by Senate committee counsel Mark
Belnlck v/hether McFarlane expressed
surprise. Sigur said. "No, because I prefaced
my remarks by saying, 'in accordance with
what Col. North had said you and he wanted
me to do.' "
Asked whether McFarlane had warned him
against soliciting funds. Sigur said. "Not to my
knowledge. 1 don't recall that at all."
