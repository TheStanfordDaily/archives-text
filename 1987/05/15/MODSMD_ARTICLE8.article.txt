# North sought help from Taiwan
## 
### 
WASHINGTON - While the
Reagan administration and
Congress were locked in an in
tense struggle in 1985 over a bill
that would have restricted j
Taiwanese textile imports, White
House aide Oliver North secretly
was asking Taiwan to contribute
to the Nicaraguan contra rebels,
testimony to the congressional
committees investigating the
Iran-contra affair revealed yester
day.
There are no signs that the $2
million that Taiwan eventually
gave the contras influenced Presi
dent Reagan's decision to veto the
textile bill, said Rep. Ed Jenkins,
a member of the committee who
raised the issue. But the secret
dealings, Jenkins said, are
"extremely dangerous from a per
ception standpoint."
The Georgia Democrat led the
effort to win passage of the textile
bill, which he hoped would save
jobs in his home state. Because he
had also been among the few Dem
ocrats who supported the admin
istration's efforts to secure aid for
the contras, he said that he was
"disturbed, disappointed, shock
ed" to learn of the secret solicita
tion from Taiwan.

Jenkins and other committee
members, probing the adminis
tration's efforts to secure dona
tions to the contras from other
countries, said that the actions
put the White House on question
able legal ground and may have
raised foreign expectations of
favors in return.
Former national security advi
ser Robert McFarlane, ending four
days of testimony, denied a Wash
ington Post report that he per
sonally asked Saudi King Fahd to
make a contribution in February
1985, at a time when Congress
had banned government intelli
gence agencies from giving direct
or indirect aid to the contras. The
Saudis ultimately gave what has
been estimated to have been more
than $20 million to the contras.
"I remember no such meeting,"
McFarlane said flatly. Reagan said
Wednesday that the subject of
Saudi contributions to the rebels
had come up during a White
House meeting with the king, but
insisted that "there was no
solicitation that I know of or any
thing of the kind."
However, those who worked for
Reagan were actively encouraging
donations to the contras from

foreign countries, testimony
showed.
Gaston Sigur Jr., now assistant
secretary of state for East Asian af
fairs, told the committee that
while he was working at the White
House in 1985 as the National Se
curity Council's East Asian policy
specialist, he assisted North in ef
forts to secure money and arms
for the contras from at least three
countries.
None of the identities of the
countries was disclosed during
testimony, but sources identified
two of them as Taiwan and South
Korea.
Sigur said that he approached
what sources identified as a
Taiwanese official at North's sug
gestion that the country "might
have an interest in giving some as
sistance, financial assistance, in
the humanitarian area to the con
tras."
Dismissing the idea that the
money went toward such
humanitarian ends as medical
supplies and food. Sen. Warren
Rudman, R-N.H., interjected: "Let
the record show that several mil
lion dollars from [Taiwan] was
transferred into the Swiss bank
account of that great world

humanitarian organization, Lake
Resources, (which financed mili
tary supplies for the contras and
which) has not been known for
buying much rice of wheat."
After some tussling back and
forth, Taiwan — identified during
testimony only as "Country No. 3"
— finally agreed to contribute $ 1
million in the fall of 1985 and
added another $1 million at
North's request several months
later.
Sigur said that North also
pressed him in mid-1985 for an
introduction to an official from
"Country No. 5." which sources
said was South Korea. He said
that he gave North the official's
phone number, and vice versa,
but added: "I have no idea
whether they ever saw each other,
or ever got together. Neither one of
them ever spoke to me about it
again."
In a third instance, Sigur said
that he arranged a lunch in No
vember 1984 at which North and
an official from another country
talked about "the possibility of
arms sales by this particular
country ... to countries in
Central America."
