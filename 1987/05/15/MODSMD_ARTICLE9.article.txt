Although Stanford has lived up to the
founders' goal of "unending life." the Univer
sity was created in a "most unlikely time" and
exceedingly improbable place," according to
two Stanford professors who spoke here yes
terday.
History Prof. David Kennedy and Emeritus
Education Prof. H. Donald Winbigler
recounted the historical background of the the
laying of the University cornerstone.
Kennedy told the Cornerstone Weekend
crowd that they are still "very much the
legatees of the hyper-energetic, broad-guaged,
public spirited, audacious, continent-taming
generation who lived at the time of the Univer
sity's founding.
The powerful image of the Gilded Age as "the
age of excess and"the age of enterprise" has
obscured the fact that support for education
was 'not so much bogusly gilded as truly
golden."
Acting on a "peculiarly American
philanthropic impulse." the supposed "robber
barons of the time used their private fortunes
to support public institutions, Kennedy said.
Colleges such as Vassar, Cornell, Wellesley

and Johns Hopkins were created in this way,
he said.
But none of these institutions were founded
in what seemed to contemporaries as "more
unlikely soil" than that founded by Leland and
Jane Stanford, according to Kennedy.

"But slowly the University rose where only
the bucolic farm had been, and its informing
ethos from the outset showed the impress of
its birth in frontier California and Gilded Age
America. Its spirit from the beginning was

Western and spacious — open, egalitarian
(and) welcoming."
Kennedy said Leland Stanford wanted his
university to emphasize the practical applica
tion of knowledge to life. "There were to be. if
Leland Stanford had his way. no uselessly
ornamented dudes at Stanford." he said.
But Stanford also possesses a
"contemplative" spirit fostered by David Starr
Jordan, the University's first president. Ken
nedy said.
"I think it appropriate for us. a century later,
to pay homage to the depth of conviction and
certainty of purpose that enabled Jordan to
strike such a serene note in that raucous age
— and in the midst of all those rough-and
tumble frontier Californians," he said.
Winbigler described the scene at the laying
of the cornerstone 100 years earlier, 38
months after the death of the Stanford's son.
Leland Junior, and only six months after
hiring Charles Coolidge, the University's archi
tect.
Winbigler, the president of the Stanford His
torical Society, characterized Stanford as a
man driven by his desire to build a fitting
