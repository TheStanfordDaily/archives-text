# Speakers recall Farm's founding
## 
### STEPHEN KASIERSKI Senior staff writer 
Although Stanford has lived up to the
founders' goal of "unending life." the Univer
sity was created in a "most unlikely time" and
exceedingly improbable place," according to
two Stanford professors who spoke here yes
terday.
History Prof. David Kennedy and Emeritus
Education Prof. H. Donald Winbigler
recounted the historical background of the the
laying of the University cornerstone.
Kennedy told the Cornerstone Weekend
crowd that they are still "very much the
legatees of the hyper-energetic, broad-guaged,
public spirited, audacious, continent-taming
generation who lived at the time of the Univer
sity's founding.
The powerful image of the Gilded Age as "the
age of excess and"the age of enterprise" has
obscured the fact that support for education
was 'not so much bogusly gilded as truly
golden."
Acting on a "peculiarly American
philanthropic impulse." the supposed "robber
barons of the time used their private fortunes
to support public institutions, Kennedy said.
Colleges such as Vassar, Cornell, Wellesley

and Johns Hopkins were created in this way,
he said.
But none of these institutions were founded
in what seemed to contemporaries as "more
unlikely soil" than that founded by Leland and
Jane Stanford, according to Kennedy.

"But slowly the University rose where only
the bucolic farm had been, and its informing
ethos from the outset showed the impress of
its birth in frontier California and Gilded Age
America. Its spirit from the beginning was

Western and spacious — open, egalitarian
(and) welcoming."
Kennedy said Leland Stanford wanted his
university to emphasize the practical applica
tion of knowledge to life. "There were to be. if
Leland Stanford had his way. no uselessly
ornamented dudes at Stanford." he said.
But Stanford also possesses a
"contemplative" spirit fostered by David Starr
Jordan, the University's first president. Ken
nedy said.
"I think it appropriate for us. a century later,
to pay homage to the depth of conviction and
certainty of purpose that enabled Jordan to
strike such a serene note in that raucous age
— and in the midst of all those rough-and
tumble frontier Californians," he said.
Winbigler described the scene at the laying
of the cornerstone 100 years earlier, 38
months after the death of the Stanford's son.
Leland Junior, and only six months after
hiring Charles Coolidge, the University's archi
tect.
Winbigler, the president of the Stanford His
torical Society, characterized Stanford as a
man driven by his desire to build a fitting

typhoid In Florence.
Stanford even Insisted on major
changes in Coolldge's design, in
cluding rotating the Quad
counter-clockwise 90 degrees to
Its present orientation. Wlnblgler
said.
Dignitaries on a special train
from San Francisco Joined a crowd
estimated between 300 and 800
people to watch the cornerstone
ceremony, he said. In front of the
cornerstone, in a place that would
become the northeast corner of
Building 60, was a canvas-covered
pavilion to accomodate trustees
and special guests, Including the
choir from the Menlo Park Presby
terian Church.
At yesterday's event, the choir's
modern-day successor returned to

sing the hymn sung 100 years ear
lier. "Heirs of Unending Life."
Wlnblgler said the dedicatory
address was given by the then
president of the Board of Trus
tees, Circuit Judge Lorenzo
Sawyer, who compared the groves
of the Stanfords' Palo Alto farm to
"the little grove in the suburb of
Athens."
Sawyer told the gathering of his
grand plans.
"Should the plans of the
founders be carried out in accor
dance with their grand concep
tions, why should not students be
attracted to its portals not only
from California, but from all other
states . . . and even from foreign
lands. What should prevent this
university from becoming . . . the
first in this or any other land?"
The University has probably
satisfied the Stanfords' expecta
tions, Wlnblgler said.
