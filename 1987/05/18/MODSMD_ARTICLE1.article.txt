LOS ANGELES - The 1987
season was filled with uncertainty
from day one for the Stanford
women's tennis team, yet there
was little doubt this weekend as to
which was the best team at the
NCAA Team Championships.
The fourth-seeded Cardinal
dominated a strong field, capping
the tournament with a 5-1 defeat
of 15th-seeded Georgia in yester
day's final at the Los Angeles Ten
nis Center.
The team title was Stanford's
second in a row and third in four
seasons. The Cardinal finished
the 1987 season with a 22-4
record.
"Stanford was definitely the
elite team," Georgia Coach Jeff
Wallace said after the match.
"They were definitely the better
team."
"It was a dream for it to end this
way," Stanford Coach Frank Bren
nan said. "We were injured all
year. I just hoped we'd recover in
time."
The Cardinal had three players
miss large portions of the season
with injuries, and the team was
not at all certain that it could

defend its title.
"If you would've asked me three
weeks ago what our chances were,
it would've been a different answer
than this morning," senior Patty
Fendick said.
Yesterday morning, though,
Stanford entered the match as the
decided favorite, having already
convincingly knocked off fifth
seeded UCLA in the quarterfinals
and top-seeded and undefeated
Florida in the semifinals.
The Bruins, playing in front of
their home crowd, and the Gators,
29-0 prior to Saturday's semifinal,
figured to be the two most difficult
draws in the tournament. But the
Cardinal clinched both matches
in singles, winning on each occa
sion by a 5-1 margin.
After stopping Florida's bid for a
perfect season, Brennan said, "I
really feel we have the best team."
He did not get any arguments
from the Georgia coach. "We just
ran into a real tough team today,"
Wallace said.
The Cardinal's depth, a ques
tion mark for much of the season,
proved to be the difference
throughout the tournament.
