# Netters take NCAA crown

### KEN STEVENS Senior staff writer 
LOS ANGELES - The 1987
season was filled with uncertainty
from day one for the Stanford
women's tennis team, yet there
was little doubt this weekend as to
which was the best team at the
NCAA Team Championships.
The fourth-seeded Cardinal
dominated a strong field, capping
the tournament with a 5-1 defeat
of 15th-seeded Georgia in yester
day's final at the Los Angeles Ten
nis Center.
The team title was Stanford's
second in a row and third in four
seasons. The Cardinal finished
the 1987 season with a 22-4
record.
"Stanford was definitely the
elite team," Georgia Coach Jeff
Wallace said after the match.
"They were definitely the better
team."
"It was a dream for it to end this
way," Stanford Coach Frank Bren
nan said. "We were injured all
year. I just hoped we'd recover in
time."
The Cardinal had three players
miss large portions of the season
with injuries, and the team was
not at all certain that it could

defend its title.
"If you would've asked me three
weeks ago what our chances were,
it would've been a different answer
than this morning," senior Patty
Fendick said.
Yesterday morning, though,
Stanford entered the match as the
decided favorite, having already
convincingly knocked off fifth
seeded UCLA in the quarterfinals
and top-seeded and undefeated
Florida in the semifinals.
The Bruins, playing in front of
their home crowd, and the Gators,
29-0 prior to Saturday's semifinal,
figured to be the two most difficult
draws in the tournament. But the
Cardinal clinched both matches
in singles, winning on each occa
sion by a 5-1 margin.
After stopping Florida's bid for a
perfect season, Brennan said, "I
really feel we have the best team."
He did not get any arguments
from the Georgia coach. "We just
ran into a real tough team today,"
Wallace said.
The Cardinal's depth, a ques
tion mark for much of the season,
proved to be the difference
throughout the tournament.
Junior Kay Tittle had her second


Asst. Coach Karyn Copeland hugs Stephanie Savides after Savides clinched Stanford's second straight NCAA championship
outstanding NCAA tournament in
a row, and Eleni Rossides and
Leigh Anne Eldredge, both men
tally and physically match-tough
for the first time this season, had
too much talent for the other
teams' lower players.
As expected, Fendick was also
undefeated in the tournament,
and she gave the Cardinal a 1-0
lead yesterday with a 6-2. 6-3 win
over Georgia's Alice Reen at No. 1
singles. "She's kind of like money
in the bank," Brennan said.
The Cardinal's Big Three at the
bottom of the lineup then took
charge and quickly pushed Stan
ford's advantage to 4-0. Tittle was
up against Stacey Schefflin, who
slapped her thigh and barked, "Go
Dawgs," after each point she won.
But Tittle kept the woofing to a
minimum on Court 4. walking
away with a 6-3, 6-3 victory.

Rossides, who had to watch at
last year's championships in Aus
tin, Texas as her teammates
captured the title, continued to
make her mark yesterday, posting
a 6-0. 6-4 victory over Lisa Apanay
at No. 5 singles.
In the No. 6 match, Georgia's
Jill Waldman had one goal in
mind — to keep the ball in play.
But Eldredge had the patience to
wait out the barrage of topspin
shots falling from the sky, and she
seized upon every opportunity to
come to the net for winners. The
result was a 6-1, 6-2 victory for the
Cardinal senior.
Last year, Stephanie Savides
was not able to do it in singles at
the NCAA tournament, losing all
four of her matches. This year,
however, she won three of four, in
cluding the clincher yesterday.
With the team score 4-0.
Savides trailed 3-2 in the second

set of the No. 2 match against
Jane Cohodes. Savides had won
the first set 7-6. taking the tie
breaker 7-4.
When Brennan informed her of
the team's lead, Savides said she
started to play with more inten
sity. "I just decided, 'That's it. I'm
going to end the match right
here.' "
Savides did just that, winning
the next four games for a 7-6 (7-4).
6-3 victory that sparked a celebra
tion. In last year's final, Savides
had also won the clinching match,
teaming with Cari Hagey at No. 2
doubles for the decisive victory
against USC.
Moments after Savides' match
ended. Georgia's Laurie Friedland
finished off Stanford freshman
Lisa Green 6-4, 7-5 in the No. 3
singles to give the Bulldogs their
only victory.
"This year was the best,"

Savides said. "We've had so many
things go against us. I knew we
could do it, but I didn't know if we
would do it."
Fendiek will be expected to do it
again when the NCAA Singles
Tournament gets under way
today. The defending national
champion and winner of 51
straight collegiate matches, Fen
dick is seeded No. 1 and opens
this morning at 8:45 against
Arizona's Chris Seiffert.
Savides starts in the first round
at 8 a.m. today against another
Arizona player, Betsy Somerville.
Green's first-round opponent is
Candy Kopetzki of Indiana. Tittle
drew the tournament's second
seed, Beverly Bowes of Texas.
Fendiek and Savides are the
fourth seeds in the doubles tourn
ament and open today against
Lanae Renschler and Robin Field
of Texas.

elite team," Georgia Coach Jeff
Wallace said after the match.
"They were definitely the better
team."
"It was a dream for it to end this
way," Stanford Coach Frank Bren
nan said. "We were injured all
year. I just hoped we'd recover in
time."
The Cardinal had three players
miss large portions of the season
with injuries, and the team was
not at all certain that it could

defend its title.
"If you would've asked me three
weeks ago what our chances were,
it would've been a different answer
than this morning," senior Patty
Fendick said.
Yesterday morning, though,
Stanford entered the match as the
decided favorite, having already
convincingly knocked off fifth
seeded UCLA in the quarterfinals
and top-seeded and undefeated
Florida in the semifinals.
The Bruins, playing in front of
their home crowd, and the Gators,
29-0 prior to Saturday's semifinal,
figured to be the two most difficult
draws in the tournament. But the
Cardinal clinched both matches
in singles, winning on each occa
sion by a 5-1 margin.
After stopping Florida's bid for a
perfect season, Brennan said, "I
really feel we have the best team."
He did not get any arguments
from the Georgia coach. "We just
ran into a real tough team today,"
Wallace said.
The Cardinal's depth, a ques
tion mark for much of the season,
proved to be the difference
throughout the tournament.
Junior Kay Tittle had her second


Asst. Coach Karyn Copeland hugs Stephanie Savides after Savides clinched Stanford's second straight NCAA championship
outstanding NCAA tournament in
a row, and Eleni Rossides and
Leigh Anne Eldredge, both men
tally and physically match-tough
for the first time this season, had
too much talent for the other
teams' lower players.
As expected, Fendick was also
undefeated in the tournament,
and she gave the Cardinal a 1-0
lead yesterday with a 6-2. 6-3 win
over Georgia's Alice Reen at No. 1
singles. "She's kind of like money
in the bank," Brennan said.
The Cardinal's Big Three at the
bottom of the lineup then took
charge and quickly pushed Stan
ford's advantage to 4-0. Tittle was
up against Stacey Schefflin, who
slapped her thigh and barked, "Go
Dawgs," after each point she won.
But Tittle kept the woofing to a
minimum on Court 4. walking
away with a 6-3, 6-3 victory.

Rossides, who had to watch at
last year's championships in Aus
tin, Texas as her teammates
captured the title, continued to
make her mark yesterday, posting
a 6-0. 6-4 victory over Lisa Apanay
at No. 5 singles.
In the No. 6 match, Georgia's
Jill Waldman had one goal in
mind — to keep the ball in play.
But Eldredge had the patience to
wait out the barrage of topspin
shots falling from the sky, and she
seized upon every opportunity to
come to the net for winners. The
result was a 6-1, 6-2 victory for the
Cardinal senior.
Last year, Stephanie Savides
was not able to do it in singles at
the NCAA tournament, losing all
four of her matches. This year,
however, she won three of four, in
cluding the clincher yesterday.
With the team score 4-0.
Savides trailed 3-2 in the second

set of the No. 2 match against
Jane Cohodes. Savides had won
the first set 7-6. taking the tie
breaker 7-4.
When Brennan informed her of
the team's lead, Savides said she
started to play with more inten
sity. "I just decided, 'That's it. I'm
going to end the match right
here.' "
Savides did just that, winning
the next four games for a 7-6 (7-4).
6-3 victory that sparked a celebra
tion. In last year's final, Savides
had also won the clinching match,
teaming with Cari Hagey at No. 2
doubles for the decisive victory
against USC.
Moments after Savides' match
ended. Georgia's Laurie Friedland
finished off Stanford freshman
Lisa Green 6-4, 7-5 in the No. 3
singles to give the Bulldogs their
only victory.
"This year was the best,"

Savides said. "We've had so many
things go against us. I knew we
could do it, but I didn't know if we
would do it."
Fendiek will be expected to do it
again when the NCAA Singles
Tournament gets under way
today. The defending national
champion and winner of 51
straight collegiate matches, Fen
dick is seeded No. 1 and opens
this morning at 8:45 against
Arizona's Chris Seiffert.
Savides starts in the first round
at 8 a.m. today against another
Arizona player, Betsy Somerville.
Green's first-round opponent is
Candy Kopetzki of Indiana. Tittle
drew the tournament's second
seed, Beverly Bowes of Texas.
Fendiek and Savides are the
fourth seeds in the doubles tourn
ament and open today against
Lanae Renschler and Robin Field
of Texas.

Patty Fendick reaches for a backhand in her 6-2,6-3 victory over Alice Reen in yesterday's NCAA final.
LOS ANGELES - The 1987
season was filled with uncertainty
from day one for the Stanford
women's tennis team, yet there
was little doubt this weekend as to
which was the best team at the
NCAA Team Championships.
The fourth-seeded Cardinal
dominated a strong field, capping
the tournament with a 5-1 defeat
of 15th-seeded Georgia in yester
day's final at the Los Angeles Ten
nis Center.
The team title was Stanford's
second in a row and third in four
seasons. The Cardinal finished
the 1987 season with a 22-4
record.
