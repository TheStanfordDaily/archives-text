## THE 						STANFORD DAILY An Independent Newspaper Protesters justified

Some people might have taken offense at
the demonstration during Thursday's Cen
tennial ceremony in the Quad. The demon
strators. both minorities and non
minorities, rallied for reforms relating to
minority life at Stanford.
The protesters — who earlier had held a
rally in White Plaza — chanted and clapped
during the proceedings, released black bal
loons during University President Donald
Kennedy's speech and walked out silently
when Secretary of State George Shultz began
his address. The students did not throw
projectiles or attempt to prevent a speaker
from delivering a speech. They made their
point, clearly and seriously.
But there were some in attendance who
disapproved of the protesters. Critics said it
was disrespectful and rude to protest during
such an important University celebration.
Maybe these critics should take a closer
look at the political process. University of
California-Berkeley students who protested
two years ago were largely responsible for the
decision by the UC regents to divest from

companies that do business in South Africa.
Divestment protests here have accelerated
the trustees selective divestment policy.
During the 19605, certain moderates told
black leaders in the civil rights movement to
slow down, that marching would only cause
bloodshed and hurt their cause. They told
them to be patient.
Protests by nature are not polite. They are
meant to jolt and awaken others to the issue
or issues at hand. Demonstrations force
people to address questions they would
otherwise ignore, and that's why 288 people
walked out of the Quad last week. The Cen
tennial celebration, with a large number of
alumni and media watching, represented a
golden opportunity for proponents of the
Rainbow Agenda to make their voices heard.
The protesters feel strongly that minority
issues are not being sufficiently addressed at
Stanford, and that the Administration is
tardy in its response to demands that were
first proposed almost 20 years ago. They will
continue to protest because they are fighting
against complacency.
