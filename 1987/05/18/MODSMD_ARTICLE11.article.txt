Profs have the
right to help
improve SDI
Informed people differ on the
merits of the Strategic Defense
Initiative.
I have just received a brochure
from Stanford Action for Nuclear
Disarmament (STAND) attacking
SDI. and including the argument
that SDI research "impinges on
academic freedom" because re
search that is unclassified now
may become classified later.
The brochure goes on to ad
vocate the following action,
among others:
"Expose research on campus
and create a political climate
making it difficult to accept fur
ther SDI money."

Clearly to STAND, academic
freedom is a mere phrase, some
thing to club the establishment
with. It has apparently never
occurred to them that academic
freedom might even cover doing
something with which they dis
agree â€” such as helping defend
the United States.
Circulating this message to
faculty, and I presume this is the
mailing list that brought it to me,
constitutes an attempt to in
timidate faculty members and
other scientists.
Therefore, I make the following
challenge. What do you thuglets
propose to do "to make it diffi
cult" for me to make proposals to
the SDI Office for Research aimed
at making SDI computer systems
more reliable by automatically
verifying proofs of correctness of
their computer programs?
Who knows? If they can make a
sufficiently ferocious and credible

threat to revive the mob rule of
the 19605, maybe I'll give in.
Many did.
On the other hand, it may be
that the threat to "create a politi
cal climate making it difficult"
was merely an overenthusiastic
bombast by people with no inten
tion of intimidating anyone. In
that case my challenge is differ
ent. Let STAND tell us what aca
demic freedom they advocate for
people who consider themselves
as having some obligation to help
solve scientific and engineering
problems related to defense and
who differ with STAND about
SDI.
What limits does STAND con
sider that academic freedom
imposes on what may be done to
"expose SDI research on campus"
and "create a political climate"?
