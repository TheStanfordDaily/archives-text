# Steve's Academy spiel
## 
### 
By now most people have forgotten Steven Spiel
berg's Academy Awards speech last month. Accept
ing the Irving G. Thalberg award for career
achievement. Spielberg said, "Movies have been the
literature of my life," but that now Hollywood should
"renew our romance with the word."
This, of course, explains why Spielberg made "The
Color Purple."

but seriously, Spielberg's spiel may be more than
Academy fluff. After all, he's so successful that he has
no reason to pay lip service to literature. At the age of
41, Spielberg is probably the most popular and in
fluential director in Hollywood. In the past decade
his movies "Jaws," "Close Encounters," "E.T.,"
"Poltergeist" and "Raiders of the Lost Ark" have
spawned a host of imitators, and just think of all
those T-shirts and E.T. nightlights. Licensed prod
ucts are the most lucrative form of flattery.
Spielberg's record of successful productions
means that he can finance just about any project he
cares to. If he wanted to romance the word by doing
film versions of the Harvard Classics, he probably
could. Spielberg in a director's chair speaks with the
authority of the Pope ex cathedra.
But it's no secret that Hollywood's big romance is
with the dollar. Some screenwriters are paid five
figure sums for scripts that never get produced. If
Spielberg really campaigns for quality screenplays,
he'll have to pay for quality writers and hello, Holly
wood. hello. For this I have two words: culture and
industry.
America is justly celebrated for its mass-produced
entertainment. Spielberg grew up on Saturday
matinee fare: B-movies. cliffhangers, pure comic
book entertainment. These are the movies that have
been the literature of Spielberg's life. There's no need
to get uptight about what we call literature. Spiel
berg uses visual quotes from other movies the way
writers allude to other writers.
Spielberg's visual quotes can be tongue-in-cheek
â€” like when the kids in his movies play with Darth
Vader dolls. Spielberg's witty when in "Raiders" the
Paramount mountain fades into a shot of a real
mountain.
When Spielberg is not absorbed in technical
wizardry, he's best at evoking the look of a California
subdivision. His screenplays feature normal charac
ters speaking the normal lines you'd expect in such a
setting. There's nothing wrong with his scripts:
they're unpretentious and they don't get in *he way.
When Spielberg says he wants to refocus attention
onto screenwriters and screenplays. I hope he
doesn't Intend to import novelists because the
results might be disappointing. Writers like William
Faulkner. Nathanael West and F. Scott Fitzgerald
went to Hollywood but produced no cinematic mas
terpieces. Today, established writers aren't likely to
be hired as hacks. But then, the contemporary writ
ers likely to be picked as screenwriters are the ones

whose style reflects the influence of movies and a
junk-food diet.
The strange thing about the history of literature
and movies is that adaptations of classics often have
the most unexceptional scripts, while original
screenplays can be eloquent.
In the old days, movie versions of the classics
abounded, often with odd results. In the 19205,
there was a silent version of "The Taming of the
Shrew" with this credit: "Screenplay by William
Shakespeare with additional dialogue by Sam
Taylor."
In a logical twist, movies based on any novel can
give audiences the impression that the book must be
a classic. Just count the number of times "Ben-Hur"
has been filmed; every remake tells the public that
this potboiler is some kind of classic.
Movies based on the romantic novels of the 19th
century can be the worst offenders. In the movie
"Wuthering Heights." you have to keep telling your
self to believe that Laurence Olivier with his perfect
enunciation is Heathcliff.
These "classic movies" usually begin with the
pages of a book turning. Line by line, you read the
opening of the novel (in the author's own words). The
pages flip, and you are whisked off into the world of
the novel. When the movie ends, you see "the end" in
stately gothlc letters. Wow. just like reading the
book.
Except that movies made from classics drop char
acters, alter locales and rearrange relationships.
Every Dracula movie ever made has fiddled with
Bram Stoker's characters.
The thing is, this Hollywood treatment doesn't
seem to matter. You can enjoy the movie as long as
you don't see it as a substitute for the novel. These
movies cull ths characters and plot lines that happen
to fit the Hollywood formulas of love and ambition.
That tradition of opening with the turning pages
of a book lives on in the "Star Wars" scroll with its
epic, "A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away." Actu
ally. the pages and the scroll function visually more
than they preface the script. You could skip reading
the Intro and follow the movie perfectly.
Spielberg of all people shouldn't forget that film's
first romance is with images. Closeups of Ingrid
Bergman and Humphrey Bogart say more than all
the lines of "Casablanca." Isn't this why the movie
retains its power over audiences who know all the
hokey lines by heart? The movie's images, its sense
of atmosphere and the expressions on the actors'
faces, are more significant than words.
Now one of last year's most original and entertain
ing movies was Spike Lee's "She's Gotta Have It."
That movie's script was playful with language in a
way that was in sync with the film's visual style.
While Spielberg was perhaps meditating on the need
for Hollywood to romance the word, the very thing
was going on in Hollywood's independent back yard.
Spielberg's spiel to the Academy was a nice
gesture, but I think it'll prove to be mostly harmless.
Wouldn't it be wonderful, though, if Spielberg filmed
Nathanael West's "The Day of the Locust." Mrs. Spiel
berg. Amy Irving, was made to be miscast in the role
of the cheap Hollywood actress. I'm sure we'd all like
to thank the Academy then.
