# The 						homosexual revolt
## 
### 
Fag jokes, friendships broken when one of the per
sons involved "comes out," harassment of openly gay
and lesbian students — these are examples of the
relatively unusual ways in which homosexually ori
ented people are oppressed. More typically, as our
history shows, we are beaten, raped, tortured,
bludgeoned, burned and gassed.

The message is clear: Homosexuality cannot be
tolerated. Men cannot love men. Women cannot love
women. To openly love someone of our own sex ulti
mately means risking our lives.
But why? What is it about homosexuality that so
shakes the foundations of our social structure?
What is it about those who choose to express their
love for people of their own sex that makes them tar
get to the most virulent hatred and violence?
Society says that homosexually oriented people are
degenerate. It says we are sinful, promiscuous, viol
ent and dangerous. It says we engage in "unnatural
acts," that we are out to "molest and corrupt"
children. Yet these are more justifications to hate
and attack us than explanations as to how our posi
tion throughout history and in the present demands
our extermination.
To begin to understand the dynamics underlying
our oppression, we must first take a quick look at the
roles that women and men are expected to fulfill in
contemporary capitalist society. Women must be
weak, nurturing, soft, docile, emotional, passive, in
competent and submissive. Men must be strong,
rough, aggressive, impersonal, competent and domi
nant. Clearly these roles lie at opposite poles. Since,
to the extent that society is polarized, people must
form relationships in which they complement one
another as much as possible, men and women are
expected to pair up. Our socialization tells us from
every imaginable perspective that men and women
are "made for each other."
It is precisely the sense that, in finding others of
their own sex attractive, men and women are playing
different roles than they are supposed to, that strikes
the majority of people as odd at the level of conscious
ness. Thus, for example, the derogatory terms "fag"
and "dyke" are invariably used to put down men and
women who seem "odd," meaning "effeminate" and
"butch" (the stereotypes for gays and lesbians). In
other words, what is often held against
homosexually oriented men and women is that they
are not the kinds of men and women society expects
them to be, that they are not "real" men and women.
While it isn't true that all homosexually oriented
men and women are "effeminate" and "butch," it is
true that at some level they are rejecting their socially
assigned roles. But what do these roles really amount
to?
The role of the woman ultimately reveals itself as
that of social reproducer. She is expected to stay at
home and do everything to ensure that her loved
ones are rested, repaired, replenished, reared and

trained. As such she is assigned to be in charge of
the family, the domestic sphere.
The role of the man ultimately reveals itself as that
of social producer. He is expected to fragment his
consciousness and bring out his productive self to
contribute in the making of products. Thus, he is as
signed to be in charge of the workplace, the public
sphere. (Unfortunately, it is not possible to explain
here why women are assigned the role of social
reproducers and men that of social producers.)
In choosing to love people of their own sex, then,
men and women are really rejecting their roles as
producers and reproducers. The reason doing this is
so threatening is that the roles of producer and
reproducer have their foundation in the economic
structure of society.
The economic structure of society is characterized
by a division of labor — a division that has existed for
thousands of years. This means that the production
process is split such that two classes exist: a class of
people who engage only in the physical production of
things — that is, who do the manual labor; and a
class of people who plan, administer and supervise
the production process — who perform the mental
labor.
As a result of the mental/manual division of labor,
the manual laborer is alienated from the product of
his/her labor; what gets produced confronts the
laborer as something that is not his/her own, some
thing which she/he cannot relate to.
The division of labor manifests itself in every
aspect of life. Immediately, it finds its expression as a
division between production and consumption. In
other words, since products are made to be
consumed, and since they confront the manual
laborer as alien, the creation of products (work) has
to take place separately from their consumption (the
use of the finished product). Thus the public sphere,
in which products are made, emerges separately
from the domestic sphere, in which products are
consumed.
So, it is as a result of the division of labor, and the
antagonism it creates between labor and product,
and between production and consumption, that the
separate spheres of the workplace and the family
emerge. It is a result of the division of labor that dif
ferent roles are assigned to males and females, so
that being a "man" and a "woman" attains a certain
meaning, as discussed above.
Now it can be seen why. as long as society remains
polarized, men who choose men and women who
choose women must and will be under attack.
Simply, they constitute a serious threat to the eco
nomic fabric of society.
Awareness of this fact leaves those of us who feel
compelled to love people of our own sex a single al
ternative: to attack our oppression at its root. We
must strive to radically transform the economic
structure of society. We must put all our energies
into expediting the only social process that can give
us hope: revolution.
We must join forces, and we must do it soon,
before any more of us are killed.

The economic structure of society is characterized
by a division of labor — a division that has existed for
thousands of years. This means that the production
process is split such that two classes exist: a class of
people who engage only in the physical production of
things — that is, who do the manual labor; and a
class of people who plan, administer and supervise
the production process — who perform the mental
labor.
As a result of the mental/manual division of labor,
the manual laborer is alienated from the product of
his/her labor; what gets produced confronts the
laborer as something that is not his/her own, some
thing which she/he cannot relate to.
The division of labor manifests itself in every
aspect of life. Immediately, it finds its expression as a
division between production and consumption. In
other words, since products are made to be
consumed, and since they confront the manual
laborer as alien, the creation of products (work) has
to take place separately from their consumption (the
use of the finished product). Thus the public sphere,
in which products are made, emerges separately
from the domestic sphere, in which products are
consumed.
So, it is as a result of the division of labor, and the
antagonism it creates between labor and product,
and between production and consumption, that the
separate spheres of the workplace and the family
emerge. It is a result of the division of labor that dif
ferent roles are assigned to males and females, so
that being a "man" and a "woman" attains a certain
meaning, as discussed above.
Now it can be seen why. as long as society remains
polarized, men who choose men and women who
choose women must and will be under attack.
Simply, they constitute a serious threat to the eco
nomic fabric of society.
Awareness of this fact leaves those of us who feel
compelled to love people of our own sex a single al
ternative: to attack our oppression at its root. We
must strive to radically transform the economic
structure of society. We must put all our energies
into expediting the only social process that can give
us hope: revolution.
We must join forces, and we must do it soon,
before any more of us are killed.

Fag jokes, friendships broken when one of the per
sons involved "comes out," harassment of openly gay
and lesbian students — these are examples of the
relatively unusual ways in which homosexually ori
ented people are oppressed. More typically, as our
history shows, we are beaten, raped, tortured,
bludgeoned, burned and gassed.

MARIO HUERTA

The message is clear: Homosexuality cannot be
tolerated. Men cannot love men. Women cannot love
women. To openly love someone of our own sex ulti
mately means risking our lives.
But why? What is it about homosexuality that so
shakes the foundations of our social structure?
What is it about those who choose to express their
love for people of their own sex that makes them tar
get to the most virulent hatred and violence?
Society says that homosexually oriented people are
degenerate. It says we are sinful, promiscuous, viol
ent and dangerous. It says we engage in "unnatural
acts," that we are out to "molest and corrupt"
children. Yet these are more justifications to hate
and attack us than explanations as to how our posi
tion throughout history and in the present demands
our extermination.
To begin to understand the dynamics underlying
our oppression, we must first take a quick look at the
roles that women and men are expected to fulfill in
contemporary capitalist society. Women must be
weak, nurturing, soft, docile, emotional, passive, in
competent and submissive. Men must be strong,
rough, aggressive, impersonal, competent and domi
nant. Clearly these roles lie at opposite poles. Since,
to the extent that society is polarized, people must
form relationships in which they complement one
another as much as possible, men and women are
expected to pair up. Our socialization tells us from
every imaginable perspective that men and women
are "made for each other."
It is precisely the sense that, in finding others of
their own sex attractive, men and women are playing
different roles than they are supposed to, that strikes
the majority of people as odd at the level of conscious
ness. Thus, for example, the derogatory terms "fag"
and "dyke" are invariably used to put down men and
women who seem "odd," meaning "effeminate" and
"butch" (the stereotypes for gays and lesbians). In
other words, what is often held against
homosexually oriented men and women is that they
are not the kinds of men and women society expects
them to be, that they are not "real" men and women.
While it isn't true that all homosexually oriented
men and women are "effeminate" and "butch," it is
true that at some level they are rejecting their socially
assigned roles. But what do these roles really amount
to?
The role of the woman ultimately reveals itself as
that of social reproducer. She is expected to stay at
home and do everything to ensure that her loved
ones are rested, repaired, replenished, reared and

trained. As such she is assigned to be in charge of
the family, the domestic sphere.
The role of the man ultimately reveals itself as that
of social producer. He is expected to fragment his
consciousness and bring out his productive self to
contribute in the making of products. Thus, he is as
signed to be in charge of the workplace, the public
sphere. (Unfortunately, it is not possible to explain
here why women are assigned the role of social
reproducers and men that of social producers.)
In choosing to love people of their own sex, then,
men and women are really rejecting their roles as
producers and reproducers. The reason doing this is
so threatening is that the roles of producer and
reproducer have their foundation in the economic
structure of society.
The economic structure of society is characterized
by a division of labor — a division that has existed for
thousands of years. This means that the production
process is split such that two classes exist: a class of
