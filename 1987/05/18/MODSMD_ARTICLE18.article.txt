Senator Barry Keene, D-Vallejo,
as well as U.S. Senators Jeff
Bingaman, D-New Mexico, and
Timothy Wirth, D-Colorado.
Keene told an audience of
over 200 people In Dinkelsplel
Auditorium that Americans
have traditionally regarded un
developed land as "an adversary
to be overcome."
This mentality was a big fac
tor In the development of the
West, Keene said, recounting
the transformation of the West
from a frontier wilderness to
the modern and developed
region it Is today. He said,
however, that as natural re
sources are depleted. West
erners must re-examine the
question of "how man lives
with nature."
"We're not the masters of na

ture, we're a part of it." Keene
said.
Wlrth shared Keene's con
cern over the West's changing
environment.
"We're poised on the verge of
a major environmental battle."
Wirth said, noting that the
water needs of cities such as
Phoenix and Los Angeles raise
serious questions about
resource management in the
West.
Neither Keene nor Wirth of
fered specific solutions for the
controversial water Issue.
Addressing the impact of a
rapidly changing economy on
Western politics. Bingaman
said the rise of service indus
tries has reduced the political
power of traditionally Influen
tial Western interests such as
mining, oil and gas companies.
Bingaman pointed out that
since the Western states are in
tegral to U.S. trade with Japan,
Canada and Mexico, there has
been "a broadening of political
agendas in the West."
Keene also commented on
the commercial interaction be
tween the Western United
States and other countries,
specifically countries in Asia.
"Here we will confront and
evolve with the cultures of
Asia," Keene said.
