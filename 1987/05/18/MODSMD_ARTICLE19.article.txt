# Gary Hart story justified, panel agrees
## Newsmen defend press freedom 
### HUGH BETHELL Editorial staff 
Though excesses have inevitably arisen from
the rights guaranteed by the First Amend
ment, the American press has made good use
of its freedom during the last 200 years, three
prominent newsmen agreed Saturday.
In the final panel discussion of Cornerstone
Weekend, Newsweek Editor Maynard Parker,
Dennis Britton, deputy managing editor of the
Los Angeles Times, and Oakland Tribune
editor Robert Maynard addressed "Two Cen
turies of Press Freedom: How Well Have We
Used It?"
The media's contribution to the failed cam
paign of Democratic presidential hopeful Gary
Hart was a frequent subject raised by the
alumni audience in Maples Pavilion.
Maynard said Hart brought about his own
downfall by challenging reporters to follow
him. He agreed with Parker that the Miami
Herald reporters had acted correctly in staking
out the house where Hart met with Donna
Rice. "There were holes in that story."
Maynard said, "but unfortunately for Mr. Hart,
none was large enough to accommodate his
escape."
In an earlier panel on "Television News: Box
Office or Journalism?" Morley Safer, co-host of
the successful CBS news program "60
Minutes," said "every Democrat and every
American" should be grateful for the Miami
Herald's efforts to expose the story.
Such "invasions" of the privacy of public offi
cials can be justified because a candidate
usually seeks publicity about the positive
aspects of his family life, Safer said.
"The people who are running for high office
want us to invade their privacy, (but) on their

own terms," he said.
Britton disagreed, contending that "the
Herald went wrong because it, too, told a lie,"
when it claimed to have completed a thorough
stakeout.
The program's moderator, Communication
Prof. James Risser, noted that although the
press provided a valuable service through its
coverage of the Vietnam War. Watergate and
the Iran-contra affair, "we might have covered
each of those topics better, either sooner, or
more accurately or with more sensitivity and
skill."
The three panelists aired contrasting
opinions on the propriety of the media's behav
ior during the recent Iran-contra scandal and
the downfall of Gary Hart's presidential cam
paign.
Parker disputed the common beliefs that the
press violates individuals' privacy, gives away
national security secrets, maintains a liberal
bias and avoids responsibility for its claims.
Citing the benefits of an aggressive press,
Parker defended the case-by-case decision
making process most commonly used by the
media today and listed examples of the press
holding stories to protect privacy and national
security. He admitted that the press makes
mistakes, often because of time pressures, but
contended that the overall effect of press
freedom is a positive one.
"It is not a coincidence that the world's freest
country also is the country with the freest
press," Parker said.
Britton agreed that the press has done well
in providing the public with "fair, thorough,
accurate and complete" information. Its big
gest problem, Britton argued, is not unethical
behavior on the part of newsmen, but their in
ability to satisfy the public.

"If you know a lot. the press appears to do a
lousy job. If you know just an average amount,
then it seems to do better; we are. after all. a
human Institution." Britton said.
Maynard blamed the bad image of the press
in part on its tremendous growth, during
which the presentation of the news has evolved
from a personal enterprise into what the
public views as an unfeeling corporate
structure.
"The relationship between the American
press and the public was essentially uncon
troversial until the '605." Maynard said, em
phasizing that the image projected by the news
media hurt its reputation. "The fact that we
never revealed our own weaknesses was in it
self a weakness."
Turning to the Iran-contra scandal. Parker
called the American press's failure to break the
story earlier "one of our worst errors of recent
times." and argued that the story would have
been written sooner except that "the man
many reporters suspected of being involved —
Lt. Col. Oliver North — was also an extraor
dinarily important source to many of the na
tion's top news-gathering organizations."
Britton also said he thought the story should
have come out sooner, but placed the blame
elsewhere. Britton said that his paper, The Los
Angeles Times, would have printed a story
about the Iran arms deal 18 months before lt
came out in Beirut, except that at the time, "I
simply didn't believe that America would be in
volved in a sale of arms to Iran."
Also appearing with Safer on the television
news panel were Daniel Gold, president of
Knight-Ridder Broadcasting, George Watson,
ABC vice-president and Washington bureau
chief, and Jean Enerson Skinner, news
anchor for Seattle's KING-TV.
