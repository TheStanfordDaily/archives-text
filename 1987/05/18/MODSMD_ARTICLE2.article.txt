# Centennial events examine education's future
## Feinstein urges education boost Cuts 'foolish,' mayor argues 
### MARK LAWRENCE Senior staff writer 
San Francisco Mayor Dianne Feinstein warned in
a campus speech Friday that the faltering U.S. eco
nomy is headed for a steep and irreversible decline
unless the United States — and California in particu
lar — spends more money on education.
"I firmly believe that our entire national and social
structure and our economic competitiveness are
going to fold unless we move quickly to remedy this
enormous shortfall in American education," said
Feinstein. who graduated from Stanford in 1955
with a bachelor's degree in political science and his
tory.
Feinstein, who spoke as part of a program that
opened the second day of Cornerstone Weekend,
called the education policies of President Reagan and
California Gov. George Deukmejian "penny-wise but
pound-foolish." She urged the Memorial Auditorium
crowd of about 250 to write "powerful letters" to
Reagan and Deukmejian calling for more funding for
education.
"Say that this nation is never going to become
competitive unless we develop our educational
standards and our work ethics," said Feinstein.
asserting that other nations, especially Japan, are
surpassing the United States because they place
greater importance on educating their citizens.
"We somehow have to convince our state and na
tional leaders that America's standing as the world's
number-one economy is seriously at risk unless
drastic action is taken to upgrade education and to
strengthen work habits," she said.
Deukmejian has come under attack for the educa
tion provisions in his 1987-88 state budget, an
nounced in January. The governor called for a 4 per
cent increase in education spending, down from 10
percent the year before. The budget also advocated
phasing out special educational programs for gifted
students, urban schools and minorities by the 1988-
89 school year.
Besides urging more funding for education.
v etnstein said the United States should enforce a
more stringent curriculum. She said more require
ments would give Americans the education neces
sary to compete with their counterparts in other
countries who now follow much more stringent cur
riculums.
Feinstein said students in Japan, the foremost
economic rival of the United States, must go to
school 243 days a year and study English for six
years before graduating from high school. American
children, she said, go to school only 180 days a year,
and no state requires even two years ot a foreign lan
guage.
Only 15 states require four years of English, and
only 10 require three years of math. She said recent
studies have shown that 23 million Americans are
functionally illiterate and 20 percent of high school
students cannot locate China on a world map.

University President Donald Kennedy and University of California-
Berkeley President David Gardner relax during an open-air lunch
with alumni Saturday on Meyer green. In speeches that day, both
Gardner and Kennedy talked on the benefits of combining research
and education into one institution.
"And the Japanese are not
alone." Feinstein said. Twenty
two education experts contacted
by U.S. News & World Report rated
West Germany, the Soviet Union
and France above the United
States in four of five categories,
she said.
"No one will agree that it makes
sense to let education slip in this
nation when the nation President
Reagan fears most — the Soviet
Union — routinely requires every
student to study physics and al
gebra for five years, chemistry and
biology for four years and calculus
for two years." Feinstein said.
"And when most U.S. students
today don't take even a year of
physics or chemistry.
California has a particularly
poor record on education.
Feinstein said. The state ranks
42nd in the amount of money it
spends per student, she said.
"California is. in fact, dead last
among the 50 states In students
per classroom — the highest
average of students per teacher —
with 23 students, compared with
New York's 15." Feinstein said.
"And this year, San Francisco, Los
Angeles, Oakland and other Cali
fornia cities have all had to con
sider actually firing teachers —
hundreds of teachers — because
the state would not give them
enough money."
California Schools Superintend
ent Bill Honig has calculated that
the state would annually be
spending *2 billion more on edu
cation if it spent as much per stu
dent as the average state,
Feinstein said. "If Californians
want their children to lead rich
and successful lives, and to be
able to compete in every field of en
deavor, they are going to have to
pay the price." she said.
