# Diplomat Clark reflects on Canadian identity
## 
### STEPHEN KASIERSKI Senior staff writer 
Some say he can "talk circles"
around anyone.
Others regard him as one of the
most effective diplomats in the
world today.
But Canadian Secretary for Ex
ternal Affairs Joe Clark was prob
ably not recognized by students as
he and his small entourage walked
across the Inner Quad Friday
morning.
Despite his relative obscurity
south of the 49th parallel. Clark
endeared himself to Cornerstone
Weekend crowds with a snappy
speech before 7.000 sun-soaked
celebrants Thursday and a witty
toast at an alumni dinner later
that evening.
"I had fun (Thursday)," he said,
"even sitting in the sun."
Clark joined Secretary of State
George Shultz and Mexican
Foreign Minister Bernardo Sepul
veda Amor in marking the 100 th
anniversary of the laying of the
University cornerstone.
The tendency among Americans
to muffle distinctions between the
United States and Its northern
neighbor was a concern of many of
the 200 Canadian students who
joined Clark for an informal

questlon-and-answer session here
Friday morning.
"It is a problem of the United
States . . . that it is often in
sensitive to the distinctions of
other societies " he
This is one reason why Clark is
interested in establishing
Canadian Studies programs at
universities such as Stanford,
calling It "a small but not insignif
icant way to try to deal with sort of
a 'casual' sense that the differ
ences which do exist, don't."
This American attitude has
been exacerbated by a long
standing Canadian "sense of
doubt about ourselves." he said.
However. Clark said Canadians
now possess greater self
confidence, fostered in part by a
"Quiet Revolution" in French
speaking Quebec, and a "cultural
burgeoning" in Western Canada.
"I believe that we are (now) bet
ter able to deal with and emerge
from trade negotiations with our
Identity intact," he said.
In an April summit with Presi
dent Reagan. Canadian Prime
Minister Brian Mulroney proposed
an agreement that would virtually
end all trade restrictions and bar
riers between the two countries.
Canada and the United States
exchanged over $150 billion in

goods and services in 1986, the
largest two-way trade arrange
ment in the world, according to
the Canadian Department of Ex
ternal Affairs.
Even though the Mulroney gov
ernment has been heavily
criticized for possibly selling out
Canada's future, Clark said his
country needs easier access to
large markets.
"One should not be under the il
lusion that the status quo
preserves our Interest," he said.
When a student said he was
concerned that Canada may be
swamped by American culture If
the countries agree to free trade.
Clark paused dramatically before
exploring strategies for stemming
the tide of American influence.
He then began his response in
French, drawing laughter from
the students.
But the relationship between
Canada and the United States is
taken very seriously by both
countries. The U.S. and Canadian
foreign ministers hold quarterly
meetings to discuss such impor
tant bilateral issues as acid rain
and trade policies.

in Geology Corner.
veda also held a two-hour private
discussion at Shultz's campus
home, the first-ever meeting of the
three North American diplomats.
Clark told the students that the
ministers' unique trilateral
meeting may be only a one-time
event.
"It's an open question as to
whether there will be a second,"
he said. "Shultz quite pointedly
left that decision to Sepulveda and
me. . . . We had a brief conversa
tion about that and we're not ex
actly sure yet whether we think
that there is enough form and
substance to carry this on to a
practice that becomes perman
ent."
The ministers discussed
East/West relations and Pacific
Rim Issues, according to Bill
Chambers. Clark's press secre
tary.
Chambers told The Daily that
the informality of the Stanford
session was a "welcome change"
from the many formal meetings
ministers must typically attend.
Focusing on the Pacific Rim
probably reduced any potential

tension between the participants,
he said.
"The other factor that Secretary
Shultz is very sensitive to is that
in any discussions of arrange
ments involving Canada, the
United States and Mexico, there's
likely to be more apprehension
among the two less powerful'
partners and their populaces than
there is among the populaces and
the government of the more pow
erful partner." Clark said.
"Secretary Shultz avoided that
problem this time with the focus
on the Pacific, an area where there
are legitimate common interests
and where the kinds of apprehen
sions about what we in Canada
call 'continental' issues don't
emerge."
Despite the close ties, Canada
and the United States often part
company on many regional issues.
At the Thursday meeting, Clark
and Shultz discussed acid rain,
trade negotiations, sovereignty of
disputed Arctic territory and
Canadian film production, Cham
bers said.
Although sometimes over
shadowed by the United States,
Canada has carved out a niche in
the world diplomatic community
as a respected representative of
less-developed countries. Clark

said his frequent meetings with
leaders of both developed and non
developed nations give him a bet
ter perspective on their difficul
ties.
"Part of our success is that we
have tried never to exaggerate
what we can do (and) we try not to
offer extravagant advice in fields
where we can't do much." he said.
Students also grilled Clark on
attempts to thwart Canada's own
"brain drain," which has been
worsened by what students view
as poor communication between
Canadian government agencies
and inadequate funding of re
search.
There are 261 Canadian stu
dents registered here for the 1986-
87 academic year, the largest
single group among the Univer
sity's 2,187 foreign students.
"Like it or not, we're in a period
of budgetary restraint," Clark
said, adding that part of the diffi
culty is a "process problem" that
can be corrected by better coor
dination among Canada's loosely
affiliated agencies.
"We have a proud tradition in
Canada of arms-length relations
(between) agencies, (but) we
should also recognize that (they)
can acquire and pursue their own
policies."
