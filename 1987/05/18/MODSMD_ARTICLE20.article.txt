# Diplomat Clark reflects on Canadian identity
## 
### STEPHEN KASIERSKI Senior staff writer 
Some say he can "talk circles"
around anyone.
Others regard him as one of the
most effective diplomats in the
world today.
But Canadian Secretary for Ex
ternal Affairs Joe Clark was prob
ably not recognized by students as
he and his small entourage walked
across the Inner Quad Friday
morning.
Despite his relative obscurity
south of the 49th parallel. Clark
endeared himself to Cornerstone
Weekend crowds with a snappy
speech before 7.000 sun-soaked
celebrants Thursday and a witty
toast at an alumni dinner later
that evening.
"I had fun (Thursday)," he said,
"even sitting in the sun."
Clark joined Secretary of State
George Shultz and Mexican
Foreign Minister Bernardo Sepul
veda Amor in marking the 100 th
anniversary of the laying of the
University cornerstone.
The tendency among Americans
to muffle distinctions between the
United States and Its northern
neighbor was a concern of many of
the 200 Canadian students who
joined Clark for an informal

questlon-and-answer session here
Friday morning.
"It is a problem of the United
States . . . that it is often in
sensitive to the distinctions of
other societies " he
This is one reason why Clark is
interested in establishing
Canadian Studies programs at
universities such as Stanford,
calling It "a small but not insignif
icant way to try to deal with sort of
a 'casual' sense that the differ
ences which do exist, don't."
This American attitude has
been exacerbated by a long
standing Canadian "sense of
doubt about ourselves." he said.
However. Clark said Canadians
now possess greater self
confidence, fostered in part by a
"Quiet Revolution" in French
speaking Quebec, and a "cultural
burgeoning" in Western Canada.
"I believe that we are (now) bet
ter able to deal with and emerge
from trade negotiations with our
Identity intact," he said.
In an April summit with Presi
dent Reagan. Canadian Prime
Minister Brian Mulroney proposed
an agreement that would virtually
end all trade restrictions and bar
riers between the two countries.
Canada and the United States
exchanged over $150 billion in

goods and services in 1986, the
largest two-way trade arrange
ment in the world, according to
the Canadian Department of Ex
ternal Affairs.
Even though the Mulroney gov
ernment has been heavily
criticized for possibly selling out
Canada's future, Clark said his
country needs easier access to
large markets.
"One should not be under the il
lusion that the status quo
preserves our Interest," he said.
When a student said he was
concerned that Canada may be
swamped by American culture If
the countries agree to free trade.
Clark paused dramatically before
exploring strategies for stemming
the tide of American influence.
He then began his response in
French, drawing laughter from
the students.
But the relationship between
Canada and the United States is
taken very seriously by both
countries. The U.S. and Canadian
foreign ministers hold quarterly
meetings to discuss such impor
tant bilateral issues as acid rain
and trade policies.
