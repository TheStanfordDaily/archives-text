# Three seniors finish with 3rd NCAA win
## 
### KEN STEVENS Senior staff writer 
LOS ANGELES — For years.
Patty Fendick, Leigh Anne
Eldredge and Stephanie Savides
were rivals. As three of the top
juniors in California, they were
matched against each other fre
quently.
For the past four years,
however, the trio has worked
toward a common goal, and with
Stanford's 5-1 victory over Georgia
yesterday, they became the first
three players in NCAA women's
tennis history to capture three
team championships during their
careers.
"It was probably the best
recruiting class we've ever had,"
Stanford Coach Frank Brennan
said of his three seniors. "They've
won three championships. It's
really been an awesome era."
Brennan said that he was un
aware of any animosities among
the three when he was recruiting
Fendick, Eldredge and Savides. "I
had no idea that they were such
rivals." he said. "I went after
them, liked them and trusted my
instincts."
"Patty and I, we were always the
top two juniors in NorCal,"
Savides said yesterday. "We were
big rivals. And Leigh Anne was the
same kind of thing. It was the
whole NorCal-Southern California
kind of thing."
Though some of the personality
differences re-emerged from time
to time as the players battled for
positions in the lineup, the team
became more of a unit as the years
passed. And this season, as injur
ies tore the Cardinal apart, the
team unity kept Stanford together
and optimistic.
During their Stanford careers,
Fendick, Eldredge and Savides
each earned All-America honors,
but the paths Ihey followed over
the past four years were in many
ways different.
Fendick has always been the
star. Even when the likes of Linda
Gates, Kate Gompert and Elise
Burgin dotted the Stanford lineup

in 1984. Fendick played No. 1
singles in the team champion
ships.
As a sophomore in 1985, Fen
dick advanced to the NCAA singles
semifinals before losing a
heartbreaking match to Trinity's
Gretchen Rush. Fendick atoned
for that match last year, beating
Rush in three sets in the singles
final.
With her 6-2. 6-3 victory over
Georgia's Alice Reen yesterday.
Fendick has now won 51 con
secutive collegiate singles
matches dating back to April
1986. In those 51 matches, she
lost just five sets.
Fendick's dominance has
largely resulted from her tremen
dous athletic ability. "She's the
finest athlete I've ever coached."
Brennan said yesterday. "Nobody
out there is going to do any more
than Patty Fendick. She can do
anything you tell her to do."
Eldredge has also won an indi
vidual national championship,
teaming with Gates to win the
doubles in 1985. She is also a
steady player with very polished
skills. But, unlike Fendick, her
1987 season almost never came to
be.
Due to overwork. Eldredge suf
fered a stress fracture in her leg
after last year's championships
and did not return to the Cardinal
lineup this season until the end of
March.
After winning her first two
singles matches of the season,
Eldredge lost her next two and
developed a shoulder injury that
threatened to end her season. "I
had that thought when my
shoulder really hurt a lot," she
said. "I just put in my hours in the
training room."
Eldredge capped her Stanford
career on a positive note, though.
"It's a nice way to go out," she
said. "In some ways, it was diffi
cult for me. This week was a men
tal turnaround for me."
This year was a mental turn
around for Savides. Having played
at the bottom half of the Cardinal
lineup the past three years, she
frequently had trouble concentrat
ing. But this year she was as
signed the No. 2 singles spot, and
she could not afford any mental
lapses.
"I think people were a little
scared with her playing two this
year," Brennan said. "But she's
performed. She's turned out to be
a hell of a tennis player."
In every big match this year,
Savides responded, and yesterday
she clinched the team victory with
a 7-6 (7-4), 6-3 victory over Geor
gia's Jane Cohodes.
While Eldredge's Stanford
career ended with yesterday's win,
Fendick and Savides finish up
with this week's individuals. Fen
dick is nearly everyone's pick to
repeat as singles champion. "I
would put my money on her,"
Savides said yesterday.
"I would think the only way she
can lose is if she gets frustrated or
if someone gets hot," Brennan
said.
"I'm as fresh as I was at the
beginning of the season; I'm
hungry for it." Fendick said.
Savides said she will have no
trouble being ready today after
winning the team championship
yesterday. "I'm going to be a lot
looser," she said. "I'm sure I'll be
psyched up."
Fendick and Savides are one of
the teams favored to win the
doubles championship. "Doubles
— I really want to do well," Savides
said. "I think we have a good
chance."
Meanwhile, Brennan will watch,
content in the knowledge that
Fcndick, Eldredge and Savides
gave the Stanford program four
solid years.
