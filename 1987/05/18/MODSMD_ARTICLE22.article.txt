# Stanford nine sweeps Trojans
## 
### TOM SENF Senior staff writer 
Stanford swept Into postseason
play in convincing fashion this
weekend, concluding its regular
season schedule with three
straight wins over USC at Sunken
Diamond.
The Cardinal won a see-saw 10-
7 decision yesterday after winning
two tight, well-pitched games. 4-3
and 3-1, the previous two days.
Stanford extended its final margin
in the Pacific 10 Southern Divi
sion to five games over UCLA and
Arizona State, finishing with a 21-
9 league record and a 44-16 mark
overall.
The Trojans ended their season
with a 12-18 Six-Pac record. 32-28
overall. USC tied with California
for fifth place in the conference,
but the Bears finished as the Six-
Pac cellar-dwellers for the second
straight year by losing their
season series with the Trojans.
"It was perfect." Stanford Coach
Mark Marquess said of the
weekend results. "We got just
what we wanted. We got a chance
for a lot of people to play, and we
got the three wins as well."
Each of Stanford's top eight
pitchers saw action, and the Card
inal also got big contributions
from reserves Mark Machtolf and
Brian Johnson. The pair got the
starting call yesterday and
responded with two hits apiece
that figured prominently in Card
inal scoring innings.
Machtolf was in the lineup at
third base because Ed Sprague
was behind the plate, and
Johnson, usually the designated
hitter only against left-handed
pitching, was used instead of Eric-
Cox.
"If something happens to
(Doug) Robbins (in regionals).
we'll catch him (Sprague),"
Marquess said. "We needed to get
him some experience. We felt we
wanted to get Machtolf some
playing time, and we wanted
Brian to face right-handed pitch
ing. He may have to do that later."
He did it well yesterday. With
USC leading 3-0 in the fifth be
hind the pitching of relief ace
Brian Nichols. Johnson followed a

Machtolf single with a bouncing
single up the middle. Ruben
Amaro singled sharply to right
center to score Machtolf, then Toi
Cook brought Johnson home with
a sacrifice fly.
After Sprague flew out, con
secutive singles by Paul Carey,
Ron Witmeyer and David Esquer
put Stanford ahead 4-3. In the in
ning, Stanford scored more
earned runs — four — than Nic
hols had previously allowed all
year — three.
The Trojans went back on top in
the sixth on a long homer to left
center by pinch hitter Terry
Brown, but the Cardinal took the
lead again in the bottom of the in
ning.
A Frank Carey single and a 2-0
count to Machtolf chased Nichols,
and the Cardinal senior then
greeted reliever Greg Mayer with a
double to left-center. Johnson
then ripped a bullet past Trojan
third baseman A 1 Villasenor into
the left-field corner to score both
runners. A bases-loaded walk to
Witmeyer later in the inning made
the score 7-5.
USC tied things again in the
seventh, but Stanford went ahead
to stay in the eighth. Witmeyer's
groundout to first drove in what
proved to be the winning run.and
the Cardinal got a little insurance
when USC second baseman Don
Buford, who transferred from
Stanford two years ago. dropped
Esquer's popup, allowing two
more runs to score.
After making an error on a bunt
that brought home one run and
giving up Brown's game-tying
triple in the seventh. Steve
Chitren handled the Trojans in
the eighth and ninth to raise his
record to 6-3.
It has been, as he said, "a long,
hard year" for Johnson, one of the
most highly recruited players in
the nation last year. The all-time
California high school home-run
and RBI king missed fall practice
because of football and began his
Cardinal career in a l-for-28
slump.
While his hitting improved
throughout the Six-Pac season.
Johnson was still at .171 before
Saturday's came. But with the

score tied in the bottom of the
ninth, the breaks finally turned
his way.
Trying to hold up on a Mayer
slider. Johnson poked a single
into right to score Amaro from
second with the winning run."It
was a good pitch. I wish I had
swung at it," Johnson said with a
smile after the game. "I got the job
done, and I guess that's all that
matters."
Starters Darrin Beer and Lee
Plemel each pitched seven in
nings. departing with the score 3-
3. Mayer and Rob Wassenaar kept
it that way until two were out in
the Cardinal ninth.
Amaro singled, then went to
second on a errant plckoff throw.
USC Coach Mike Gillespie then
replaced Brown in right field with
Gregg Hokuf, a strange move con
sidering that Brown had thrown
out Paul Carey at the plate in the

previous inning on an Esquer
single.
Gillespie's next move was not so
strange. He decided to walk Cook,
a .325 hitter who is especially dan
gerous in the clutch, in favor of
Johnson, but the strategy
backfired when the freshman's
soft liner went over Buford's head
to end the ballgame.
"I knew once Ruben got to
second they'd walk Toi," Johnson
said. "I was hoping they would be
cause I wanted to hit."
It was the combination of a
likely and not-so-likely heroes that
paced the Cardinal on Friday, as
Jack McDowell and Esquer led
Stanford to the 3-1 triumph.
McDowell extended his mastery
of the Trojans, firing a complete
game six-hitter that included nine
strikeouts and just one walk. For
the season. McDowell has pitched
18 innings against USC. allowing

just one run and eight hits while
fanning 22.
Despite his overpowering suc
cess against them. McDowell does
not believe the Trojans are espe
cially weak offensively. "If I have
iny good stuff. I can do that to just
about anybody." he said.
McDowell is 9-4 on the year, but
he has not been as consistently
dominant as he was in his sopho
more season. "I've been frustrated
with the year I've had," he said.
"I'm happy I've got nine wins and
the team's been winning, but ba
sically I think I put too much pres
sure on myself trying to throw the
perfect pitch all the time. But I've
thought about it a lot. and I think
you're gonna see a different
pitcher the rest of the year."
While McDowell has been ex
pected to star. Esquer has been
one of the biggest surprises for
Stanford this year. The senior

shortstop is hitting .326 and is in
the midst of a 12-game hitting
streak.
Esquer figured in all of the
Cardinal scoring on Friday. He
staked McDowell to a 2-0 lead in
the second when he sent a Randy
Powers pitch screaming over the
left-field fence for his first career
homer.
"I was sprinting all the way to
second." he said. "I thought it was
a double off the wall. I was as
surprised as anybody in the ball
park."
Esquer produced Stanford's
final run when he dropped down a
leadoff bunt single in the seventh.
He moved to third on walks to
Frank Carey and Cook and scored
when Cook beat shortstop Rodney
Peete's throw to second on
Sprague's routine two-out
grounder.

Stanford swept Into postseason
play in convincing fashion this
weekend, concluding its regular
season schedule with three
straight wins over USC at Sunken
Diamond.
The Cardinal won a see-saw 10-
7 decision yesterday after winning
two tight, well-pitched games. 4-3
and 3-1, the previous two days.
Stanford extended its final margin
in the Pacific 10 Southern Divi
sion to five games over UCLA and
Arizona State, finishing with a 21-
9 league record and a 44-16 mark
overall.
The Trojans ended their season
with a 12-18 Six-Pac record. 32-28
overall. USC tied with California
for fifth place in the conference,
but the Bears finished as the Six-
Pac cellar-dwellers for the second
straight year by losing their
season series with the Trojans.
"It was perfect." Stanford Coach
Mark Marquess said of the
weekend results. "We got just
what we wanted. We got a chance
for a lot of people to play, and we
got the three wins as well."
Each of Stanford's top eight
pitchers saw action, and the Card
inal also got big contributions
from reserves Mark Machtolf and
Brian Johnson. The pair got the
starting call yesterday and
responded with two hits apiece
that figured prominently in Card
inal scoring innings.
Machtolf was in the lineup at
third base because Ed Sprague
was behind the plate, and
Johnson, usually the designated
hitter only against left-handed
pitching, was used instead of Eric-
Cox.
"If something happens to
(Doug) Robbins (in regionals).
we'll catch him (Sprague),"
Marquess said. "We needed to get
him some experience. We felt we
wanted to get Machtolf some
playing time, and we wanted
Brian to face right-handed pitch
ing. He may have to do that later."
He did it well yesterday. With
USC leading 3-0 in the fifth be
hind the pitching of relief ace
Brian Nichols. Johnson followed a

Machtolf single with a bouncing
single up the middle. Ruben
Amaro singled sharply to right
center to score Machtolf, then Toi
Cook brought Johnson home with
a sacrifice fly.
After Sprague flew out, con
secutive singles by Paul Carey,
Ron Witmeyer and David Esquer
put Stanford ahead 4-3. In the in
ning, Stanford scored more
earned runs — four — than Nic
hols had previously allowed all
year — three.
The Trojans went back on top in
the sixth on a long homer to left
center by pinch hitter Terry
Brown, but the Cardinal took the
lead again in the bottom of the in
ning.
A Frank Carey single and a 2-0
count to Machtolf chased Nichols,
and the Cardinal senior then
greeted reliever Greg Mayer with a
double to left-center. Johnson
then ripped a bullet past Trojan
third baseman A 1 Villasenor into
the left-field corner to score both
runners. A bases-loaded walk to
Witmeyer later in the inning made
the score 7-5.
USC tied things again in the
seventh, but Stanford went ahead
to stay in the eighth. Witmeyer's
groundout to first drove in what
proved to be the winning run.and
the Cardinal got a little insurance
when USC second baseman Don
Buford, who transferred from
Stanford two years ago. dropped
Esquer's popup, allowing two
more runs to score.
After making an error on a bunt
that brought home one run and
giving up Brown's game-tying
triple in the seventh. Steve
Chitren handled the Trojans in
the eighth and ninth to raise his
record to 6-3.
It has been, as he said, "a long,
hard year" for Johnson, one of the
most highly recruited players in
the nation last year. The all-time
California high school home-run
and RBI king missed fall practice
because of football and began his
Cardinal career in a l-for-28
slump.
While his hitting improved
throughout the Six-Pac season.
Johnson was still at .171 before
Saturday's came. But with the

score tied in the bottom of the
ninth, the breaks finally turned
his way.
Trying to hold up on a Mayer
slider. Johnson poked a single
into right to score Amaro from
second with the winning run."It
was a good pitch. I wish I had
swung at it," Johnson said with a
smile after the game. "I got the job
done, and I guess that's all that
matters."
Starters Darrin Beer and Lee
Plemel each pitched seven in
nings. departing with the score 3-
3. Mayer and Rob Wassenaar kept
it that way until two were out in
the Cardinal ninth.
Amaro singled, then went to
second on a errant plckoff throw.
USC Coach Mike Gillespie then
replaced Brown in right field with
Gregg Hokuf, a strange move con
sidering that Brown had thrown
out Paul Carey at the plate in the

previous inning on an Esquer
single.
Gillespie's next move was not so
strange. He decided to walk Cook,
a .325 hitter who is especially dan
gerous in the clutch, in favor of
Johnson, but the strategy
backfired when the freshman's
soft liner went over Buford's head
to end the ballgame.
"I knew once Ruben got to
second they'd walk Toi," Johnson
said. "I was hoping they would be
cause I wanted to hit."
It was the combination of a
likely and not-so-likely heroes that
paced the Cardinal on Friday, as
Jack McDowell and Esquer led
Stanford to the 3-1 triumph.
McDowell extended his mastery
of the Trojans, firing a complete
game six-hitter that included nine
strikeouts and just one walk. For
the season. McDowell has pitched
18 innings against USC. allowing

just one run and eight hits while
fanning 22.
Despite his overpowering suc
cess against them. McDowell does
not believe the Trojans are espe
cially weak offensively. "If I have
iny good stuff. I can do that to just
about anybody." he said.
McDowell is 9-4 on the year, but
he has not been as consistently
dominant as he was in his sopho
more season. "I've been frustrated
with the year I've had," he said.
"I'm happy I've got nine wins and
the team's been winning, but ba
sically I think I put too much pres
sure on myself trying to throw the
perfect pitch all the time. But I've
thought about it a lot. and I think
you're gonna see a different
pitcher the rest of the year."
While McDowell has been ex
pected to star. Esquer has been
one of the biggest surprises for
Stanford this year. The senior

shortstop is hitting .326 and is in
the midst of a 12-game hitting
streak.
Esquer figured in all of the
Cardinal scoring on Friday. He
staked McDowell to a 2-0 lead in
the second when he sent a Randy
Powers pitch screaming over the
left-field fence for his first career
homer.
"I was sprinting all the way to
second." he said. "I thought it was
a double off the wall. I was as
surprised as anybody in the ball
park."
Esquer produced Stanford's
final run when he dropped down a
leadoff bunt single in the seventh.
He moved to third on walks to
Frank Carey and Cook and scored
when Cook beat shortstop Rodney
Peete's throw to second on
Sprague's routine two-out
grounder.
