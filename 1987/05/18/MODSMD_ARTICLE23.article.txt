## 
### EVAN TUCHINSKY Staff writer 
You've come a long way. baby.
After an extremely successful
career at Stanford University, Kim
Oden has graduated to become
captain of the United States
Women's National Volleyball team.
She returned with her new squad
to her old gym Friday to register a
decisive three-game win over the
Brazilian National Team in the
third round of the Yugo/USA
Challenge.
With its 15-9, 15-7, 15-9 victory,
the United States earned the right
to play Cuba — the top team in the
tournament with a 3-0 record in
the first three rounds as well as
the No. 1 team in the world — in
the finals at the University of the
Pacific. The Cubans defeated
Canada in four games during the
first match Friday night.
"I thought we played really well,"
U.S. Coach Terry Liskevych said.
"That's as much intensity as we've
had from point one until the end
of the match in the history of this
program.
"I think it's shown that playing
the Cubas and Chinas and losing
to them has really paid off, be
cause we've become a really tough
team," he added.
"It felt great," Oden said. "The
team felt determined to play well.
It felt good from warm-ups on."
The U.S. team simply outplayed
the Brazilians. "I thought we
dominated them," Liskevych said.
"They couldn't stop our middle.
We served the ball tough, blocked
the ball well and we scrambled,
played great scramble defense.
"I think it's a matter of what the
U.S.A. can do that Brazil can't
recover from," added Liskevych.

the 1983 Collegiate Coach of the
Year from Pacific.
"I don't know why they didn't
play well," Oden said of the oppo
sition. noting the sizable
Brazilian contingent in the
stands. "They had a good crowd
up here, very supportive, but I just
think they played flat.
"We came out and were very
emotional, and we stayed that
way. That's our game: to play
really emotionally and get into it.
We knew what we had to do. we
did it and we played well," added
the middle blocker, who registered
10 kills and a block solo for the
night.
Perhaps the most inspired play
for the United States came from
Caren Kemner, an outside hitter
who played at Arizona. Kemner
was second on the team with 12
kills (one behind UCLA's Liz
Masakayan's 13), and lead the
team with two blocks and one ser
vice ace.
"She played really well tonight,"
Oden said. "This whole tourna
ment she's played very consis
tently, keeping us together and
pulling in the key hits when we
need them."
Arizona State's Tammy Webb
also had a fine evening, entering
the match in the second game to
replace 17-year-old outside hitter
Keba Phipps. "Tammy played
really well for us," Liskevych said.
"I thought she did a great job com
ing in there for us."
But the star of the night was
clearly Oden, who not only scored
the first several points of game
one, but also scored match point
at the end of the third game.
"I think she's played well for us
since January, and I think coming
home has really helped," Lis
kevych said. "She's been a real

great addition to our team. She's a
great person, and the sky's the
limit for Kim Oden."
In the first match of the even
ing. it appeared that David would
once again fell Goliath when the
bottom-seeded Canadian team
took the first game from the top
ranked Cubans and the lead in the
second.
Cuban Coach Eugenio George
then substituted in his regular
starting setter Imilsis Tellez and
outside hitter Mireya Luis, who
has one of the largest vertical
leaps in the sport, and the Cuban
club turned the game around to
win 15-11, subsequently taking
the next two games from the out
classed Canadians. 15-3, 15-6.
Neither Oden nor Liskevych felt
that the performance by Cuba
Friday was indicative of the effort
they will exert against the U.S.
squad in the final match at Stock
ton. "Tonight that wasn't Cuba on
the floor," the coach said. "They
went through the motions.
"They won't go through the mo
tions in the final. I hope they do,
but they won't," he added.
"Tonight they didn't play well at
all," Oden agreed. "I think we
should be ready for them to come
on strong."

recover from," added Liskevych.

the 1983 Collegiate Coach of the
Year from Pacific.
"I don't know why they didn't
play well," Oden said of the oppo
sition. noting the sizable
Brazilian contingent in the
stands. "They had a good crowd
up here, very supportive, but I just
think they played flat.
"We came out and were very
emotional, and we stayed that
way. That's our game: to play
really emotionally and get into it.
We knew what we had to do. we
did it and we played well," added
the middle blocker, who registered
10 kills and a block solo for the
night.
Perhaps the most inspired play
for the United States came from
Caren Kemner, an outside hitter
who played at Arizona. Kemner
was second on the team with 12
kills (one behind UCLA's Liz
Masakayan's 13), and lead the
team with two blocks and one ser
vice ace.
"She played really well tonight,"
Oden said. "This whole tourna
ment she's played very consis
tently, keeping us together and
pulling in the key hits when we
need them."
Arizona State's Tammy Webb
also had a fine evening, entering
the match in the second game to
replace 17-year-old outside hitter
Keba Phipps. "Tammy played
really well for us," Liskevych said.
"I thought she did a great job com
ing in there for us."
But the star of the night was
clearly Oden, who not only scored
the first several points of game
one, but also scored match point
at the end of the third game.
"I think she's played well for us
since January, and I think coming
home has really helped," Lis
kevych said. "She's been a real

great addition to our team. She's a
great person, and the sky's the
limit for Kim Oden."
In the first match of the even
ing. it appeared that David would
once again fell Goliath when the
bottom-seeded Canadian team
took the first game from the top
ranked Cubans and the lead in the
second.
Cuban Coach Eugenio George
then substituted in his regular
starting setter Imilsis Tellez and
outside hitter Mireya Luis, who
has one of the largest vertical
leaps in the sport, and the Cuban
club turned the game around to
win 15-11, subsequently taking
the next two games from the out
classed Canadians. 15-3, 15-6.
Neither Oden nor Liskevych felt
that the performance by Cuba
Friday was indicative of the effort
they will exert against the U.S.
squad in the final match at Stock
ton. "Tonight that wasn't Cuba on
the floor," the coach said. "They
went through the motions.
"They won't go through the mo
tions in the final. I hope they do,
but they won't," he added.
"Tonight they didn't play well at
all," Oden agreed. "I think we
should be ready for them to come
on strong."
