# Powwow celebrates native American culture
## 
### LESLIE HATAMIYA Staff writer 
Native American dancing, singing, food
and arts and crafts attracted approximately
12,000 visitors to the 16th annual Stanford
Powwow this past weekend.
Native Americans representing more
than 100 different tribes, as well as inter
ested spectators, gathered at the intra
mural fields near Stanford Stadium for this
three-day event.
Visitors sampled native American food,
watched Indian dance competitions,
bought authentic native American crafts
and jewelry, and visited with old friends.
The Stanford American Indian Organiza
tion (SAIO) sponsored the festivities.
Teepees, approximately 120 booths and a
large, canopied dance arena were featured
at the event, which is "the largest powwow
in the state of California and one of the larg
est in the country," according to Jim
Larimore, assistant dean of Student Affairs
and co-adviser at the Stanford Native Amer
ican Cultural Center.
The festivities opened Friday evening
with a children's dance competition and
concluded yesterday afternoon with the
final rounds of the men and women's dance
competitions.
According to freshman Tracey Leßeau, a
Sioux Indian in charge of publicity for the
event, the powwow drew visitors from
around the Bay Area and the nation.
Leßeau said that by having the powwow at
Stanford, "we get a lot of Palo Alto people
and alumni, but we also draw people from
as far away as New York, Oklahoma, the
Dakotas and Canada."
Many visitors on campus for the Univer
sity's Cornerstone Celebration also atten
ded powwow events. Larimore said.
The annual Stanford Powwow, begun in
1972 by SAIO, "has grown from an event of
300 visitors in 1972 to a crowd estimated
over 12,000 this weekend," Larimore said.
According to Larimore, the powwow
seeks to present a mixture of spiritual, so
cial and cultural components of the native
American community. One of the event's

main goals is to promote fellowship be
tween the people of different tribes, he said.
One purpose of the powwow, Leßeau
said, is to allow the different native Ameri
can tribes "to perpetuate their own tribal
traditions, like dancing and singing."
"People think that (native American cul
ture) is dying out. but it's not." Leßeau
said. "Our traditions aren't dying out. . . .
(Indian culture has] been revived over the
past 20 years, and little kids and teenagers
are getting involved, too."
According to Leßeau. powwows similar to
the Stanford event commonly occur
throughout California and the rest of the
United States, but generally attract only
native Americans.
Unlike most other powwows, the Stan
ford Powwow is organized solely by stu
dents, Larimore said. SAIO began prepara
tions for the event last fall and is respon
sible for all fundraising to cover this year's
*25,000 budget.
Many native Americans tour the country
and take part in the various powwows.
Leßeau said. Many of the vendors who ran
booths at the Stanford powwow make their
living by selling native American arts and
crafts at the different gatherings, she said.
Frank Chee, a Navajo Indian from New
Mexico who manned a native American
jewelry booth, said the powwow "is always
good for business and has good crowds,
too. It's one of the better ones in Califor
nia."
Jewelry vendor JoAnn Teiken, a Chip
pewa Indian originally from the White
Earth Reservation in Minnesota, called the
Stanford Powwow "about the best organ
ized powwow. It's great for business."
Besides the business aspect of working at
powwows, Teiken explained her personal
attraction to the native American gather
ings. "I sure miss the drums in the winter.
It kind of gets in your blood," she said.
For Helen Waukazoo, a Navajo Indian
from Alameda, the powwow has special per
sonal significance. "This is one special
event that happens once a year and means a
lot to us," said Waukazoo, who has atten
ded the Stanford event for five years.
