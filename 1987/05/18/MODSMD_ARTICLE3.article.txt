### STEPHEN KASIERSKI Senior staff writer 
In an attempt to correct what he called a
commonly held "misunderstanding." Uni
versity President Donald Kennedy said Sat
urday that the "fusion of learning and
doing" at modern research universities of
fers unique educational opportunities for
students.
The Kennedy speech, titled "The Found
ing Vision and the Research University,"
was one of nine forums and addresses held
during Cornerstone Weekend, a University
wide celebration marking the 100 th an
niversary of the laying of Stanford's corner
stone.
The Cornerstone festivities began
Thursday afternoon in the Inner Quad,
where 7,000 people watched an academic
procession and heard speeches from Secre
tary of State George Shultz and his North
American counterparts, Canadian Secre
tary of State for External Affairs Joe Clark
and Mexican Secretary of Foreign Relations
Bernardo Sepulveda Amor.
In speeches delivered Saturday, both
Kennedy and University of California-
Berkeley President David Gardner empha
sized the advantages of combining the roles
of teaching and research in one institution.
Speaking before a lunchtime crowd of
1.000 alumni on Meyer green. Kennedy
cautioned undergraduates and alumni
against regarding the term "research uni
versity" as a "claim of primary focus."
Kennedy said the "fundamental societal
decision" to center research activity at the
same places where knowledge is dis

serriinated causes much of the potential
conflict between those two functions to
"just disappear."
Drawing from his own personal experi
ence. Kennedy called his years directing
students and technicians in a biology labo
ratory "the most rewarding" aspect of his
27-year association with Stanford.
Gardner told a Saturday morning crowd
of 2,000 alumni in Maples Pavilion that the
combination of teaching and research is
prominent in the educational philosophies
of two of the West's educational pioneers,
Stanford's David Starr Jordan and
Berkeley's Daniel Coit Gilman.
According to Gardner, Jordan "regarded
teaching and research not as enemies but
as allies, one reinforcing and informing the
other in the cause of learning."
Kennedy dismissed the notion that good
researchers are likely to be poor teachers as
"folklore."
"On the whole, the truth is that people
who are competent at one intellectual activ
ity are good at the other one," he said.
Kennedy added that he was
"disappointed" that relatively few Stanford
students could take advantage of research
opportunities because of student financial
constraints, shortages of adequate facilities
and commitments of an overworked faculty.
He stressed, however, that these prob
lems are being given high fund-raising
priority in the University's Centennial Cam
paign.
Gardner said Jordan and Gil
man also shared a common faith
in the possibility of building a
great university in California.
"Both of these men believed, as
perhaps only those attracted to
the empty and limitless vistas of
the West could, that human effort
and aspiration could achieve a vi
brant and learned community
without having to wait for cen
turies of tradition to sustain it."
he said.
The close proximity of the two
rival institutions has actually
benefited both, Gardner said.
"Perhaps because they grew up
together, public and private uni
versities and colleges in the West,
in stark contrast to the East, have
cultivated a spirit of cooperation
as well as a healthy competition,"
Gardner said.
