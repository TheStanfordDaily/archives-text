Universities of the future will be
challenged to prepare students for the
demands of a dynamic, increasingly
technological society, according to
panelists at a Centennial symposium
Friday in Memorial Auditorium.
The symposium, titled "The Univer
sity and the 21st Century: Serving So
ciety's Needs?" featured Wellesley Pres
ident Nannerl Keohane. Apple Com
puter Chairman John Sculley. North
Dakota Attorney General Nick Spaeth
and former Congressman Ed Zschau.
The discussion was moderated by
Clark Kerr, president emeritus of the
University of California-Berkeley.

Each of the panelists pointed out
that although society in the 21st cen
tury will be changing rapidly, the edu
cational mission of universities will
remain the same.
"The essential discourse between
teacher and student, in which both ex
plore together, will not be superceded."
Keohane said.
"Universities have always had a dis
tinct life . . . devoted to finding the
truth." Kerr said. "Universities will
best serve society of the future as they
maintain their independence, as they
maintain their pursuit of truth, as
they maintain their autonomy. They
can only serve society best as they
retain their own souls."
But in an increasingly technological

society which is entering what Sculley
called "the information age." univer
sities must provide students with a
broad education that will equip them
to adapt to changing societal demands
and occupational structures, the
panelists said.
"There will be an inverse relation
ship between the burgeoning of knowl
edge on the one hand, and the stan
dard of how much detailed knowledge
needs to be imparted in a good under
graduate education on the other,"
Keohane said.
"In tomorrow's world . . . the goal
will be. even more than now. to teach
people how to think and where to find
the answers to their questions and to
stimulate and fix their naked

curiosity," she continued.
The panelists said that universities
in the 21st century will face pressure
not only from public interest, but from
student demands for career prepara
tion.
"Students increasingly demand
classes . . . that teach them highly spe
cific technical skills, because it's a ra
tional response to a society and an eco
nomy that will pay them better if they
graduate with those kinds of degrees."
Spaeth said. "This trend is unlikely to
change in the 21st century; indeed, it
may worsen.
"My concern," Spaeth continued, "is
that we will lose those aspects of educa-
