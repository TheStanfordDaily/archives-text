# Universities face challenges, panel says

### CHRIS MYERS Editorial staff 
Universities of the future will be
challenged to prepare students for the
demands of a dynamic, increasingly
technological society, according to
panelists at a Centennial symposium
Friday in Memorial Auditorium.
The symposium, titled "The Univer
sity and the 21st Century: Serving So
ciety's Needs?" featured Wellesley Pres
ident Nannerl Keohane. Apple Com
puter Chairman John Sculley. North
Dakota Attorney General Nick Spaeth
and former Congressman Ed Zschau.
The discussion was moderated by
Clark Kerr, president emeritus of the
University of California-Berkeley.

Each of the panelists pointed out
that although society in the 21st cen
tury will be changing rapidly, the edu
cational mission of universities will
remain the same.
"The essential discourse between
teacher and student, in which both ex
plore together, will not be superceded."
Keohane said.
"Universities have always had a dis
tinct life . . . devoted to finding the
truth." Kerr said. "Universities will
best serve society of the future as they
maintain their independence, as they
maintain their pursuit of truth, as
they maintain their autonomy. They
can only serve society best as they
retain their own souls."
But in an increasingly technological

society which is entering what Sculley
called "the information age." univer
sities must provide students with a
broad education that will equip them
to adapt to changing societal demands
and occupational structures, the
panelists said.
"There will be an inverse relation
ship between the burgeoning of knowl
edge on the one hand, and the stan
dard of how much detailed knowledge
needs to be imparted in a good under
graduate education on the other,"
Keohane said.
"In tomorrow's world . . . the goal
will be. even more than now. to teach
people how to think and where to find
the answers to their questions and to
stimulate and fix their naked

curiosity," she continued.
The panelists said that universities
in the 21st century will face pressure
not only from public interest, but from
student demands for career prepara
tion.
"Students increasingly demand
classes . . . that teach them highly spe
cific technical skills, because it's a ra
tional response to a society and an eco
nomy that will pay them better if they
graduate with those kinds of degrees."
Spaeth said. "This trend is unlikely to
change in the 21st century; indeed, it
may worsen.
"My concern," Spaeth continued, "is
that we will lose those aspects of educa-
tion that benefit society the most
in a broader sense," namely "an
awareness and appreciation of our
culture ... an ability to think ra
tionally and creatively . . . and a
sense of history and the lessons it
teaches us."
Both Keohane and Sculley
predicted that in order to ade
quately educate students of the fu
ture. universities will have to ex
pand the cultural base of their
curricula.
Sculley spoke of a "21st century
renaissance similar to the Renais
sance in 15th century Europe" in
which ancient Greek culture was
rediscovered. "What is the age
that we're going to rediscover (in
the 21st century renaissance)?"
he asked. "Perhaps we can begin
to discover some of the cultures
that go beyond the Western world,
including Eastern mysticism."
Keohane, a political science pro
fessor at Stanford for several years
before she went to Wellesley,
elaborated on that issue. "The
university in the 21st century will
be more diverse in its composi
tion," she predicted. "There will be

more people of different ages and
races and nationalities in the fac
ulty and student body. ... As
more people with different ethnic
backgrounds attend our univer
sities, their impact on our cur
ricula and the definition of our
mission will be profound.
"We can expect that the old
familiar emphasis on Western cul
ture will be supplanted by a much
wider notion of culture itself and
an awareness of the complex pat
terns in which cultures in the past
and present influence one an
other." she said.
Keohane said that universities
must also be more accessible to
different classes.
"If educators and political
leaders around the world act
wisely," she said, "they will make
sure that universities tomorrow
are more open than they are
today. ... If the world's univer
sities continue to be dispropor
tionately accessible to people from
advantaged backgrounds who can
pay their way. we will fail to meet
our responsibilities for social
justice and equity, and even more
sobering, we will have made more
likely an international struggle of
the haves and have-nots of a most
devastating sort."
The panelists pointed to tech

nology as a potentially useful tool
in Improving and democratizing
culture.
"Technology, when properly
used, can extend the human intel
lect and extend the capabilities of
individuals." Zschau said. "The
university's role is to promote an
understanding of science and
technology and how to master it
. . . so that people can achieve
their potential and create service
to the society."
Sculley said that technology
would provide the tools for trans
ferring scholarly works, "cross
referencing knowledge,' and
promoting cross-disciplinary
learning.
"We've got to get more cross
disciplinary referencing in order
to get people to have different
points of view," he said. "And
that's really the goal, I think, of
the 21st century university: to
give people a chance not only to
gain expertise in a specialization
. . . but more importantly, to be
able to gain different points of
view about subjects.
"The way to do that is to give
people the ability to move from
one discipline to another," he con
cluded. "And so we need not more
specialization, but we really need
more generalization."

graduate with those kinds of degrees."
Spaeth said. "This trend is unlikely to
change in the 21st century; indeed, it
may worsen.
"My concern," Spaeth continued, "is
that we will lose those aspects of educa-
tion that benefit society the most
in a broader sense," namely "an
awareness and appreciation of our
culture ... an ability to think ra
tionally and creatively . . . and a
sense of history and the lessons it
teaches us."
Both Keohane and Sculley
predicted that in order to ade
quately educate students of the fu
ture. universities will have to ex
pand the cultural base of their
curricula.
Sculley spoke of a "21st century
renaissance similar to the Renais
sance in 15th century Europe" in
which ancient Greek culture was
rediscovered. "What is the age
that we're going to rediscover (in
the 21st century renaissance)?"
he asked. "Perhaps we can begin
to discover some of the cultures
that go beyond the Western world,
including Eastern mysticism."
Keohane, a political science pro
fessor at Stanford for several years
before she went to Wellesley,
elaborated on that issue. "The
university in the 21st century will
be more diverse in its composi
tion," she predicted. "There will be

more people of different ages and
races and nationalities in the fac
ulty and student body. ... As
more people with different ethnic
backgrounds attend our univer
sities, their impact on our cur
ricula and the definition of our
mission will be profound.
"We can expect that the old
familiar emphasis on Western cul
ture will be supplanted by a much
wider notion of culture itself and
an awareness of the complex pat
terns in which cultures in the past
and present influence one an
other." she said.
Keohane said that universities
must also be more accessible to
different classes.
"If educators and political
leaders around the world act
wisely," she said, "they will make
sure that universities tomorrow
are more open than they are
today. ... If the world's univer
sities continue to be dispropor
tionately accessible to people from
advantaged backgrounds who can
pay their way. we will fail to meet
our responsibilities for social
justice and equity, and even more
sobering, we will have made more
likely an international struggle of
the haves and have-nots of a most
devastating sort."
The panelists pointed to tech

nology as a potentially useful tool
in Improving and democratizing
culture.
"Technology, when properly
used, can extend the human intel
lect and extend the capabilities of
individuals." Zschau said. "The
university's role is to promote an
understanding of science and
technology and how to master it
. . . so that people can achieve
their potential and create service
to the society."
Sculley said that technology
would provide the tools for trans
ferring scholarly works, "cross
referencing knowledge,' and
promoting cross-disciplinary
learning.
"We've got to get more cross
disciplinary referencing in order
to get people to have different
points of view," he said. "And
that's really the goal, I think, of
the 21st century university: to
give people a chance not only to
gain expertise in a specialization
. . . but more importantly, to be
able to gain different points of
view about subjects.
"The way to do that is to give
people the ability to move from
one discipline to another," he con
cluded. "And so we need not more
specialization, but we really need
more generalization."
Universities of the future will be
challenged to prepare students for the
demands of a dynamic, increasingly
technological society, according to
panelists at a Centennial symposium
Friday in Memorial Auditorium.
The symposium, titled "The Univer
sity and the 21st Century: Serving So
ciety's Needs?" featured Wellesley Pres
ident Nannerl Keohane. Apple Com
puter Chairman John Sculley. North
Dakota Attorney General Nick Spaeth
and former Congressman Ed Zschau.
The discussion was moderated by
Clark Kerr, president emeritus of the
University of California-Berkeley.

Each of the panelists pointed out
that although society in the 21st cen
tury will be changing rapidly, the edu
cational mission of universities will
remain the same.
"The essential discourse between
teacher and student, in which both ex
plore together, will not be superceded."
Keohane said.
"Universities have always had a dis
tinct life . . . devoted to finding the
truth." Kerr said. "Universities will
best serve society of the future as they
maintain their independence, as they
maintain their pursuit of truth, as
they maintain their autonomy. They
can only serve society best as they
retain their own souls."
But in an increasingly technological

society which is entering what Sculley
called "the information age." univer
sities must provide students with a
broad education that will equip them
to adapt to changing societal demands
and occupational structures, the
panelists said.
"There will be an inverse relation
ship between the burgeoning of knowl
edge on the one hand, and the stan
dard of how much detailed knowledge
needs to be imparted in a good under
graduate education on the other,"
Keohane said.
"In tomorrow's world . . . the goal
will be. even more than now. to teach
people how to think and where to find
the answers to their questions and to
stimulate and fix their naked

curiosity," she continued.
The panelists said that universities
in the 21st century will face pressure
not only from public interest, but from
student demands for career prepara
tion.
"Students increasingly demand
classes . . . that teach them highly spe
cific technical skills, because it's a ra
tional response to a society and an eco
nomy that will pay them better if they
graduate with those kinds of degrees."
Spaeth said. "This trend is unlikely to
change in the 21st century; indeed, it
may worsen.
"My concern," Spaeth continued, "is
that we will lose those aspects of educa-
tion that benefit society the most
in a broader sense," namely "an
awareness and appreciation of our
culture ... an ability to think ra
tionally and creatively . . . and a
sense of history and the lessons it
teaches us."
