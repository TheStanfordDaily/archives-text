U.S. frigate hit by Iraqi planes
WASHINGTON — An American guided-missile frigate patrolling
in the Persian Gulf was attacked by Iraqi aircraft on Sunday in
what appeared to be a case of mistaken identity, the Pentagon
said. Sources said "at least one" sailor was killed.
Robert Sims, the Pentagon's chief spokesman, said in a brieiing
at 9:45 p.m. EDT he was not yet in a position to confirm fatalities
aboard the USS Stark.
"We may have had fatalities." he said. "There is a possibility that
there may have been one or more.
"But we just don't know for sure. It's getting close to daylight
over there now and the captain of the ship is beginning to take a
muster to account for the crew. It will be awhile before we get a
report."
Sims said the attack occurred around 2 p.m. EDT. or about 10
p.m. local time in the gulf, as the Stark was patrolling in an area
about 85 miles northeast of Bahrain.
Sims said that based on preliminary reports, the Stark was at
tacked by two Iraqi Mirage F-l fighters, each of which fired one
Exocet missile from a range of about 20 miles.
"We take this event with the utmost seriousness," Secretary of
State George Shultz said at a speech to the American Israel Public
Affairs Committee. "We know the source of this missile . . . and we
demand a full accounting,"
"We believe this was a mistaken attack" on the part of the Iraqi
planes, Sims said. "There is no indication of any deliberate, hos
tile intent.
"It appears to be a case of mistaken identity. We don't know why
it happened. But the State Department has already registered two
protests."
Soviet ship damaged in Gulf
MANAMA, Bahrain — The Soviet Union yesterday reported its
second tanker casualty in the Persian Gulf since agreeing less
than a month ago to assist Kuwait in eluding Iranian attacks on
its shipping.
The Soviet news agency Tass said that the vessel, Marshal
Chuikov, had sustained hull damage after hitting a mine while
sailing 34 miles off Kuwait. There were no deaths in the incident
and the ship was being towed to Kuwait for repairs, Tass said.
Shipping sources said that the 67,980-ton ship was one of three
Soviet flat tankers Moscow recently leased to Kuwait. The agree
ment includes protection by Soviet warships, if required by
Kuwaiti shipping.
The agreement was developed after more than a dozen Iranian
gunboat attacks had been made on ships frequenting Kuwaiti
ports since the beginning of the year.
In the first incident involving Soviet shipping after the agree
ment was made, Iranian gunboats heavily damaged the freighter
Ivan Kotoreyev in an attack May 6. The freighter was the first su
perpower ship casualty in the seven-year-old war between Iran
and Iraq.
Kuwait and neighboring countries have issued warnings in
recent months about mines that may drift north from the war
zone around the northern end of the gulf, but this was the first in
cident involving a ship-mine collision in Kuwait's offshore waters.
Bakkers wrote off luxury condo
WASHINGTON — A *592,000 oceanfront condominium written
off as a parsonage and a private jet that flew Jim and Tammy Faye
Bakker to a marriage counselor are among items federal auditors
found in PTL ministry records, according to a report published
Sunday.
The Internal Revenue Service, which is examining $1.3 million
worth of expenses charged to the tax-exempt Christian ministry
by the Bakkers, found items ranging from the condo to a $120
Gucci pen, according to an unidentified PTL official cited by The
Washington Post. The IRS is questioning whether the items
charged between 1981 and 1983 were personal expenses.
The IRS is determining whether the oceanfront condominium
in Palm Beach, Fla., bought for $390,000 and furnished for
$202,000, can legitimately be claimed as a parsonage, the Post re
ported.
The Bakkers stayed in the condominium twice before selling it
in 1984 following criticism of its purchase, the newspaper said.
Other items the IRS found were bought by the ministry for the
Bakkers included an $800 Gucci briefcase, $67,000 worth of
women's clothes, $11,399 to charter a private jet for the couple to
meet with their marriage counselor and a $70 address book, the
newspaper reported.
Bakker resigned from the ministry and the Assemblies of God
revoked his ordination after disclosure of a sexual encounter
seven years ago with a church secretary.
Kohl suffers political setback
BONN. W. Germany — Chancellor Helmut Kohl's Christian
Democratic Union suffered significant setbacks in two state elec
tions yesterday, and the results were viewed as a sign that West
German voters were worried that Kohl's party was holding up a
U.S.-Soviet nuclear arms accord.
The Christian Democrats lost their absolute majority in the
southwestern state of Rhineland-Palatinate, Kohl's home state,
for the first time in 16 years although they still will dominate the
government there. They were toppled from their six-month-old po
sition as the largest party in the northern port of Hamburg.
The detente-minded Free Democratic Party, the junior partner
in Kohl's center-right coalition in Bonn, scored substantial gains
and was set to enter the ruling coalitions in both state
legislatures.
The Free Democrats benefited from their outspoken support for
accepting a Soviet offer on short-range missiles and thus paving
the way for a superpower treaty to remove medium-range missiles
from Europe, senior politicians and commentators said. Kohl's
Christian Democrats have opposed the Soviet proposal in a bitter
debate within the governing coalition In the past month.
The opposition Social Democrats, bouncing back from a series
of electoral defeats over the past year, regained their traditional
position as the largest party in Hamburg.
They gained there at the expense of the ecologist-paciflst
Greens, who lost a third of their seats in Hamburg after a hard
line faction gained control of the national party in a recent con
vention. In Rhineland-Palatinate. however, the Greens won seats
in the legislature for the first time.
Military violence continues in Fiji
SUVA. Fiji — Fiji's new military government today continued its
crackdown, arresting some union leaders and detaining foreign
journalists, as small signs of public discontent appeared to widen
on the fifth day of a military takeover.
The country's large Indian population, outraged at the over
throw of the first Indian-dominated government, made plans for a
general shutdown of commerce in Suva, the capital, and other
large cities. Indian sugar cane workers were supposed to stop
working in the fields, and at least some shops were expected to
close in protest, but it remained uncertain how successful or
widespread the strike might be.
Lt. Col. Sitlveni Rabuka. who led the takeover, said strikes
would be considered illegal under his military regime, and left
open the possibility that troops might force open any shops that
close. Several union leaders were reported arrested In an effort to
break the strike.

Democratic Union suffered significant setbacks in two state elec
tions yesterday, and the results were viewed as a sign that West
German voters were worried that Kohl's party was holding up a
U.S.-Soviet nuclear arms accord.
The Christian Democrats lost their absolute majority in the
southwestern state of Rhineland-Palatinate, Kohl's home state,
for the first time in 16 years although they still will dominate the
government there. They were toppled from their six-month-old po
sition as the largest party in the northern port of Hamburg.
The detente-minded Free Democratic Party, the junior partner
in Kohl's center-right coalition in Bonn, scored substantial gains
and was set to enter the ruling coalitions in both state
legislatures.
The Free Democrats benefited from their outspoken support for
accepting a Soviet offer on short-range missiles and thus paving
the way for a superpower treaty to remove medium-range missiles
from Europe, senior politicians and commentators said. Kohl's
Christian Democrats have opposed the Soviet proposal in a bitter
debate within the governing coalition In the past month.
The opposition Social Democrats, bouncing back from a series
of electoral defeats over the past year, regained their traditional
position as the largest party in Hamburg.
They gained there at the expense of the ecologist-paciflst
Greens, who lost a third of their seats in Hamburg after a hard
line faction gained control of the national party in a recent con
vention. In Rhineland-Palatinate. however, the Greens won seats
in the legislature for the first time.
Military violence continues in Fiji
SUVA. Fiji — Fiji's new military government today continued its
crackdown, arresting some union leaders and detaining foreign
journalists, as small signs of public discontent appeared to widen
on the fifth day of a military takeover.
The country's large Indian population, outraged at the over
throw of the first Indian-dominated government, made plans for a
general shutdown of commerce in Suva, the capital, and other
large cities. Indian sugar cane workers were supposed to stop
working in the fields, and at least some shops were expected to
close in protest, but it remained uncertain how successful or
widespread the strike might be.
Lt. Col. Sitlveni Rabuka. who led the takeover, said strikes
would be considered illegal under his military regime, and left
open the possibility that troops might force open any shops that
close. Several union leaders were reported arrested In an effort to
break the strike.

U.S. frigate hit by Iraqi planes
WASHINGTON — An American guided-missile frigate patrolling
in the Persian Gulf was attacked by Iraqi aircraft on Sunday in
what appeared to be a case of mistaken identity, the Pentagon
said. Sources said "at least one" sailor was killed.
Robert Sims, the Pentagon's chief spokesman, said in a brieiing
at 9:45 p.m. EDT he was not yet in a position to confirm fatalities
aboard the USS Stark.
"We may have had fatalities." he said. "There is a possibility that
there may have been one or more.
"But we just don't know for sure. It's getting close to daylight
over there now and the captain of the ship is beginning to take a
muster to account for the crew. It will be awhile before we get a
report."
Sims said the attack occurred around 2 p.m. EDT. or about 10
p.m. local time in the gulf, as the Stark was patrolling in an area
about 85 miles northeast of Bahrain.
Sims said that based on preliminary reports, the Stark was at
tacked by two Iraqi Mirage F-l fighters, each of which fired one
Exocet missile from a range of about 20 miles.
"We take this event with the utmost seriousness," Secretary of
State George Shultz said at a speech to the American Israel Public
Affairs Committee. "We know the source of this missile . . . and we
demand a full accounting,"
"We believe this was a mistaken attack" on the part of the Iraqi
planes, Sims said. "There is no indication of any deliberate, hos
tile intent.
"It appears to be a case of mistaken identity. We don't know why
it happened. But the State Department has already registered two
protests."
Soviet ship damaged in Gulf
MANAMA, Bahrain — The Soviet Union yesterday reported its
second tanker casualty in the Persian Gulf since agreeing less
than a month ago to assist Kuwait in eluding Iranian attacks on
its shipping.
The Soviet news agency Tass said that the vessel, Marshal
Chuikov, had sustained hull damage after hitting a mine while
sailing 34 miles off Kuwait. There were no deaths in the incident
and the ship was being towed to Kuwait for repairs, Tass said.
Shipping sources said that the 67,980-ton ship was one of three
Soviet flat tankers Moscow recently leased to Kuwait. The agree
ment includes protection by Soviet warships, if required by
Kuwaiti shipping.
The agreement was developed after more than a dozen Iranian
gunboat attacks had been made on ships frequenting Kuwaiti
ports since the beginning of the year.
In the first incident involving Soviet shipping after the agree
ment was made, Iranian gunboats heavily damaged the freighter
Ivan Kotoreyev in an attack May 6. The freighter was the first su
perpower ship casualty in the seven-year-old war between Iran
and Iraq.
Kuwait and neighboring countries have issued warnings in
recent months about mines that may drift north from the war
zone around the northern end of the gulf, but this was the first in
cident involving a ship-mine collision in Kuwait's offshore waters.
Bakkers wrote off luxury condo
WASHINGTON — A *592,000 oceanfront condominium written
off as a parsonage and a private jet that flew Jim and Tammy Faye
Bakker to a marriage counselor are among items federal auditors
found in PTL ministry records, according to a report published
Sunday.
The Internal Revenue Service, which is examining $1.3 million
worth of expenses charged to the tax-exempt Christian ministry
by the Bakkers, found items ranging from the condo to a $120
Gucci pen, according to an unidentified PTL official cited by The
Washington Post. The IRS is questioning whether the items
charged between 1981 and 1983 were personal expenses.
The IRS is determining whether the oceanfront condominium
in Palm Beach, Fla., bought for $390,000 and furnished for
$202,000, can legitimately be claimed as a parsonage, the Post re
ported.
The Bakkers stayed in the condominium twice before selling it
in 1984 following criticism of its purchase, the newspaper said.
Other items the IRS found were bought by the ministry for the
Bakkers included an $800 Gucci briefcase, $67,000 worth of
women's clothes, $11,399 to charter a private jet for the couple to
meet with their marriage counselor and a $70 address book, the
newspaper reported.
Bakker resigned from the ministry and the Assemblies of God
revoked his ordination after disclosure of a sexual encounter
seven years ago with a church secretary.
