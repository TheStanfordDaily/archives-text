# Stanford pulls doctors from area hospital
## 
### DIANE BISGEIER Senior staff writer 
The School of Medicine will
withdraw all obstetrics and gyne
cology residents from the Santa
Clara Valley Medical Center as of
July 1 because of an "inability to
resolve several problems" between
the two administrations, accord
ing to Spyros Andreopoulos, direc
tor of the Medical School Office of
Communications.
Valley Medical Center Adminis
trator Robert Sillen told the Times
Tribune that Stanford President

Donald Kenredy is planning to
talk with Santa Clara County su
pervisors next week to attempt to
work out an extension.
"I don't understand what the
motive behind Stanford's decision
was," said Dr. Raymond Allen,
chief resident at Santa Clara. Al
len stated that the medical center
has "consistently provided excel
lent training" for residents.
The move drew criticism from
Dr. Toni Harris, a former Stanford
medical student and resident who
is currently a member of the Valley
Medical obstetrics-gynecology

staff. Harris told the Times
Tribune that Stanford "is vic
timizing the poor and indigent
women of this county in a political
game."
Andreopoulos disagreed with
Harris, stating that "a large num
ber of patients at the Stanford
Medical Center are on Medicaid.
We have specific contracts and
programs to treat high-risk
patients." he said.
Andreopoulos noted, however,
that residents at Valley Medical
"are not exposed to enough

routine obstetrics there." he said.
According to Allen, the large
number of high-risk patients at
Valley Medical is actually an ad
vantage to the resident program.
"In any training, you want to deal
with complications and prob
lems," he said. "Stanford itself
treats many high-risk patients."
Another factor in the Univer
sity's decision to remove its resi
dents from Valley Medical was the
fact that many residents were
working 100-hour weeks. "The
purpose of the program is educa
tional and not to provide cheap

labor for the medical center." An
dreopoulos said.
The decision, made In Novem
ber. will Involve shifting the rota
tions for 18 residents from the
Santa Clara Medical Center to the
Kaiser Foundation Hospital.
There are also 44 clerks — stu
dents who have not yet received
their medical degree — who will be
moved to other hospitals, accord
ing to Andreopoulos. The clerks
observe medical faculty.
"I don't see the decision benefit
ing the students in the program."
Allen said, however.
