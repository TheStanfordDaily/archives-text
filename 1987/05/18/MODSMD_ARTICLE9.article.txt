While outlining strategies for
improving the quality of educa
tion in California. State Superin
tendent of Public Instruction Bill
Honig warned that budget cut
backs may hinder opportunities
for educational excellence.
"We've got an (educational)
reform movement going . . . and if
we don't get those investments,
we're not going to capitalize on
that opportunity," according to
Honig, who was one of the partici

pants in a panel discussion on the
future of education in California
held in Memorial Auditorium Sat
urday.
"Let's at least give the schools
enough money so they don't have
to cut back," Honig said.
Honig likened education to "a
service industry," in which the
emphasis should be on what can
be done "in the system to make it
better."
One way to make education bet
ter is to move "from a rule-based
enterprise to a performance-based
enterprise," he said, adding that

another way is to have more pro
fessional evaluation of teachers by
their peers.
"There's a whole raft of innova
tions," said Honig, emphasizing
that "there's some strong evidence
that we're on the right track."
"We're seeing much tighter cur
ricular definition . . . and the
(standardized test) scores are
starting to go up in California," he
said.
Other panelists pointed out that
minorities will have to be better
provided for if education quality is
to be improved.

"We are not doing a decent job of
educating minority students."
said State Senator Gary Hart, D-
Santa Barbara.
Lewis Butler, president of Cali
fornia Tomorrow, said that
"Words like minority" will disap
pear in the future because "we will
all be a minority."
"Whites are already a minority"
among California's youth, and "by
2030. about two-thirds of the
youth under 25 will be Hispanic,
Asian and black," Butler said. He
likened California education to a
jazz band, rather than a melting

pot. In a jazz band, all the instru
ments are recognized for their
unique roie, but they play with a
central theme.
In the year 2000, Butler said,
people over 65 will be 75 percent
white. These older citizens must
be willing to devote their re
sources to the schools, he said.
Another problem that must be
confronted at some point is class
size, Hart said. He pointed out
that while California has the high
est class size in the nation, the
state spending per pupil is below
the national average.
