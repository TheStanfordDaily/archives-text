# Proposal to ban alcohol stirs debate
## 
### DIANE BISGEIER Senior staff writer 
Arguments for and against a policy prohibiting al
cohol, bottles and cans from Stanford Stadium were
presented yesterday by University students, staff and
alumni in a meeting with the Committee on Ath
letics, Physical Education and Recreation at Encina
Gym.
The proposed ban Is partly in response to a letter
sent to Athletic Director Andy Geiger six weeks ago
by Tony Navarra, president of the Stanford Police Of
licers Association. In the letter, Navarra expressed
his concern over "rowdiness and maintaining or
derly conduct," according to committee member
Frances Conley, who moderated yesterday's meeting.
"We felt we needed more time to elicit comments
from the community," Conley said. "We wanted to
give everybody that was interested in this a chance to
speak."
After hearing public opinion yesterday, the com
mittee, which includes Geiger, acting Dean of Stu
dent Affairs Norm Robinson, faculty from the law
school and two student representatives, met
privately to discuss the views presented during the
meeting.
The committee will meet again Thursday for con
tinued deliberation, Geiger said.
"People on the committee
wanted to accept all that we heard
and digest it," Geiger said. "We are
anxious to come to the right deci
sion. If we were anxious to do the
easy thing, we would have made a
decision today."
According to Tim Gadus, who
has worked at the Stanford Medi
cal Center since 1969 and spoke
against the proposal at yesterday's
meeting, "the problem lies in the
inability or desire not to deal with
problems as they arise.
"It just seems to me that there
are already rules in place that you
could use to regulate alcohol,"

Gadus said.
Gadus also said the proposed
ban could result in a decrease in
attendance. "If you start restrict
ing things for fans, they start to
lose interest. This could lead to
less television coverage, so you're
talking about a much bigger
issue," he said.
Navarra mentioned that distur
bances such as fights and thrown
objects are increasing.
"It seems to me like we should
fall in line with the standards of
other schools." he said, referring
to other Pacific-10 conference
schools. No Pac-10 school permits
alcohol in its stadium except the
University of Southern California,
which sells alcohol in the
stadium. Alcohol is also sold at
San Jose State football games.

"We shouldn't compete with
commercial stadiums like
Candlestick. Laws and policies are
established to maintain the safety
and welfare of the public," Navarra
said, referring to the success of
keeping alcohol out of the Grateful
Dead concert in Frost Amphithea
ter three weeks ago.
Sophomore John Mannion
sharply opposed the proposal at
the meeting. "As a university that
fosters individual responsibility, I
think we would be losing a lot to
take away a lot of social learning."
he said.
Mannion said that Stanford
should "not follow the Pac-10. We
are unique and have admitted stu
dents that are better. By creating
more rules, you create more revo
lutionaries."

Committee member Raymond
Bacchetti, vice provost for Univer
sity management, challenged
Mannion, stating that the Univer
sity has an obligation to a large
amount of people in addition to
the students.
"We've got [10,000] to 13,000
students in an 85,000-seat
stadium. What about Stanford's
obligation to the other 75,000
people in regards to enjoying the
game and not worrying about
being hit by a bottle or can?" Bac
chetti asked.
Alumna Mary Beth Linzmeier
suggested that officials might
limit the quantity of alcohol that
can be brought into the stadium.
"We shouldn't take this all-or
nothing attitude." she said.
