# Proposal to ban alcohol stirs debate
## 
### DIANE BISGEIER Senior staff writer 
Arguments for and against a policy prohibiting al
cohol, bottles and cans from Stanford Stadium were
presented yesterday by University students, staff and
alumni in a meeting with the Committee on Ath
letics, Physical Education and Recreation at Encina
Gym.
The proposed ban Is partly in response to a letter
sent to Athletic Director Andy Geiger six weeks ago
by Tony Navarra, president of the Stanford Police Of
licers Association. In the letter, Navarra expressed
his concern over "rowdiness and maintaining or
derly conduct," according to committee member
Frances Conley, who moderated yesterday's meeting.
"We felt we needed more time to elicit comments
from the community," Conley said. "We wanted to
give everybody that was interested in this a chance to
speak."
After hearing public opinion yesterday, the com
mittee, which includes Geiger, acting Dean of Stu
dent Affairs Norm Robinson, faculty from the law
school and two student representatives, met
privately to discuss the views presented during the
meeting.
The committee will meet again Thursday for con
tinued deliberation, Geiger said.
