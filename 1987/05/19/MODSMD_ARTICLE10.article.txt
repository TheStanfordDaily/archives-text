# Survivors tell of inferno

MANAMA, Bahrain — The survivors of an Iraqi
missile attack on the American frigate USS Stark
said "all hell broke loose" when a loud bang hit the
ship Sunday night, setting off secondary explosions
and knocking at least five sailors overboard as "flash
fires" turned the vessel into a deadly inferno.
U.S. Ambassador Sam Zakhem, after speaking
with some of the hospitalized sailors here, reported
that the Stark had been hit by two missiles. One
ripped a 10 to 15-foot gash in the port side of the
frigate near the waterline in an area "that leads to
the missile magazine," he said.
The second missile, Zakhem said, "hit just below
the bridge and the front compartments on the ship
. . . the place where many of our young sailors
perished."
Zakhem praised the bravery of the Stark's crew.
"They did a beautiful job to tiy and put out the fires
that raged off and on," he said. "They were tough,
they were brave, they were great."
Two sailors who were badly burned spoke briefly
from their hospital beds yesterday with Zakhem.
They said they did not remember anything after the
initial shock of the explosion.
Four other sailors, who spent nearly six hours
adrift in the Persian Gulf before being rescued by a

Bahrain! military helicopter, said the blast blew
them off the ship.
"They said all hell broke loose when the Exocet
hit," Zakhem reported, adding, "those who fell in the
water said they fell through a big hole."
The badly damaged frigate remained dead in the
water about 65 miles northeast of here yesterday.
Reporters who flew near it just before sundown re
ported it listing slightly. A tug alongside was pump
ing water onto the ship to cool it down after heavy
fires ravaged it below decks.
Zakhem, after conferring by radio-telephone with
Rear Adm. Harold Bernsen, commander of the six
ship Middle East task force that patrols the Persian
Gulf, said that Navy officials hope to tow the ship
here today.
Zakhem said the death toll remains at 28, but two
sailors may still be missing. He said crewmembers
remain aboard the ship trying to keep it seaworthy
and prevent more fires.
The bodies of the dead crewmen are aboard
Bernsen's flagship, the USS LaSalle, which is due to
arrive here Tuesday to transfer them to planes that
will return them to Mayport, Fla., the Stark's home
port.
