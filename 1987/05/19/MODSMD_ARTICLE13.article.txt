## THE
						STANFORD DAILY An Independent Newspaper Beer isn't to blame 
### 
Even though there was strong opposition
at a discussion yesterday, the Committee on
Athletics, Physical Education and Recreation
is still considering Athletic Director Andy
Geiger's proposal to ban alcohol at Stanford
home football games. The ban is ill-conceived
and approval of it would be folly.
Stanford football games are wonderful so
cial and sporting events. There are few better
ways to spend a Saturday afternoon. Many
fans — be they alumni, staff, students or
simply community friends of the Cardinal —
enjoy drinking alcohol at the games. They
should have that privilege.
The University's alcohol policy places its
primary emphasis on education, not regula
tion. In keeping with this policy of fostering
responsible attitudes toward drinking, cer
tainly fans who act appropriately should be
allowed to enjoy a few beers.
In his rationale for proposing a dry
stadium, Geiger seems lost in a sea of
generality. He points to fights in the student
section and other "incidents" in which per
sons were hit by thrown objects as the im
petus for his proposal.
What he fails to realize is that — by any ob
jective standard — Stanford's football crowd
is the most relaxed, affable and social group
of fans in the Bay Area. Indeed, it was just
this lack of fervor that prompted the mem

bers of last year's team to state they weren't
getting enough fan support.
Geiger's proposal is a solution looking for a
problem. One or two "incidents" does not an
irresponsible crowd make, and, frankly, any
sporting event attended by upwards of
50,000 fans is bound to have these oc
curences — with or without the presence of
alcohol.
Banning alcohol at the stadium actually
invites a higher level of intoxication. Fans at
tailgaters prior to the game will likely over
compensate for the lack of alcohol inside.
This is not what the University wants to
promote.
If some people act wildly at football games
and endanger others, they should be quickly
removed from the stadium. However, to
punish the vast majority of Stanford fans for
the actions of a disparate few is to act capri
ciously and without a sense of justice.
To steal a gimmicky phrase from the gun
control lobby: Alcohol doesn't throw objects
— people do. These people have no place at
Stanford Stadium. Alcohol, however, does
have a place at the stadium.
And to bastardize another phrase, this one
from Winston Churchill: To rescind a
privilege that so many have handled so well
for so long is overreaction and needless inter
ference.
