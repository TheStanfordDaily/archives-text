Threat of rape
made by Jrat
We recognize that there has
been much debate about fraterni
ties in these pages in recent days.
We would like to relate the follow
ing anecdote not so much to
shame the fraternity in question
but to provide just one example of
why so many residence staffs
object to fraternities. It is inci
dents such as this one. repeated
in an endless variety of forms,
that have earned the fraternities
the reputation they have among
many residence staffs.
On the night of Monday, April
27, members of Theta Delta Chi
came to Madera to distribute
pledge bids. During their 45-
minute stay they gave us a
generous exhibition of the group
behavior that many of us who
work for Residential Education in
the dorms have come to identify
with the fraternity system.
There was heavy drinking from
a portable keg, extremely vulgar
speech and loud disruption of the
peace. More seriously, as the
group proceeded down the
women's Iloor — hardly necessary
for the accomplishment of bid
distribution — one of their com
pany threatened one of the female
resident assistants with rape.
The fraternity members will argue
vociferously that there was no
such intention, but what else
does "Let's fuck the RA" mean?
In the majority of fraternities at
Stanford, the Greek system, with
its unrelenting emphasis on
heavy drinking, its exclusive and
often painful selection process,
its encouragement of an in
sensitive and sometimes violent

attitude toward women and its
vulgar and often destructive
group behavior, is simply an
outmoded means of structuring
male friendships. We urge a thor
ough reform not only of Rush,
but of the entire fraternity sys
tem.

Is all sense of propriety gone?
One would think that this is the
case at Stanford after witnessing
the Rainbow Agenda's actions at
the Centennial Celebration.
To interrupt speakers with
chants and balloons is simply
impolite and disrespectful. Is
shouting a person down the way
to bring about a meaningful
dialogue on serious issues? Is the
denial of a man's right to be
heard a proper or even effective
method of airing legitimate
demands?
If the Rainbow Agenda wants
cooperation in working out its
demands, I say cooperate. If its
members find University Presi
dent Donald Kennedy's actions
disrespectful, I say they should be
respectful themselves. It is a zero
sum game when parties cannot
be courteous.
Finally, I think Stanford owes a
special apology to Secretary of
State George Shultz, who is an
injured party due to a lack of
etiquette.

Issues affect
every group
In response to the recent
demands made by the Rainbow
Agenda, it seems that many stu
dents have perceived the group
and its demands as too militant.
It's a shame that many students,
especially whites, feel threatened
and offended by the minority
groups.
People should realize these
student groups are not trying to
alienate anyone and are not
power-hungry factions ready to
take over the University.
Rather, we should all keep in
mind that implicit in the Rain
bow Agenda's concerns is a
struggle for equality and fair
treatment for everyone, and that
in the 19605, the changes that
came about from the struggles of
Martin Luther King Jr. and the
civil rights movement did not just
help black people but helped every
sector of society.
And furthermore, these
changes did not come about be
cause a group of people sat
passively around. Change is only
going to come about if we
demand it.and demand it loudly.
These issues are a concern for
everyone. We're all affected by
them, just as we were in the '60s.
It is with this in mind that I urge
everyone to support the efforts of
the Rainbow Agenda. And if there
are some things that you don't
agree with, talk to these groups
in a positive, constructive man
ner. They're ready to listen.
