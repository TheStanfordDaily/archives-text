# Conservatives are rejected here

Let me slate at the outset that I am a sup
porter of President Reagan. I voted for him and
I stand by that. I say this so that you know my
bias, but I hope that in the next few
paragraphs you will realize that my consterna
tion results from something far more profound
than a political disagreement with the Stan
ford student bodv and faculty.

In particular, the loss of the Reagan Library
is. for me and many others, the log which pul
verized the camel's back, so to speak. The
Stanford community has allowed its political
intolerance to foreclose for generations of fu
ture students the opportunity to make use of
an academic resource which would have
rivaled anything that Stanford currently has to
offer. I salute those who revel in the "victory" of
the loss of the library, but their short
sightedness jeopardizes the entire academic
mission that you and many others have spent
the better parts of your lives trying to serve.
What is at issue on this campus is not which
political persuasion will be dominant. What is
at issue is whether an alternative to the domi
nant political persuasion can be heard at all.
The concept behind "We do not want the
Reagan Library" is fundamentally more
profound than We disagree with the Reagan
agenda." Were it only this, the appropriate
response would have been to solicit or create
left-leaning policy centers and institutions,
thus enriching both sides of political dialogue
on campus. Instead. "We do not want the
Reagan Library" must be interpreted as: "We

do not even want to hear their opinion. They
have no right to express it here."
The Reagan Library controversy has
energized the effort to throw the Hoover Insti
tution off campus as well. Thankfully, this
movement is limited. Its focus is indicative,
however. Hoover scholars are regularly
criticized for publishing op-ed pieces, that is.
for exercising their constitutional right to free
speech. Hoover Itself has become a "bogey
man" among students, representing all that is
evil about monolithic conservatism. This is. as
even Political Science Prof. John Manley is
aware, a complete distortion of reality. These
students and faculty, who would gladly see the
tower go. would cast away some of the most
brilliant minds — regardless of their political
perspective — In our university, along with
one of the richest sets of archives in the entire
world. We would destroy Hoover because we
cannot bear to listen to them.
Sadly, this campus has come to accept only
one form of political discourse. I need mention
only that our (my) graduation speaker,
represented as a "non-partisan elder states
man." is one of the architects of liberalism in
America. Picture the outcry were Richard
Nixon to be our graduation speaker. (In a very
picturesque manner, the announcement of
Tip O'Neill as Commencement speaker shared
the front page of The Daily with the Faculty
Senate's censure of Hoover Director W. Glenn
Campbell's remarks about the Reagan Library.
Very fitting.)
As an extreme example, with the thousands
of dollars I have voted to approve for South
Africa-related programming in the ASSU Sen
ate. I have not encountered a single attempt to
present a South African view on the situation

since a debate about two years ago in which a
South African white participated. I do not in
any way support the South African govern
ment, but it is interesting that it would not oc
cur to an academic institution to plan such
programming, if only for the intellectual inter
est (sense of fairness notwithstanding).
As a more disturbing example, it has come to
my attention that the same one-sidedness is
being employed in the formation of the Stan
ford campus in Washington. Several alumni
who work in the White House have complained
that their (quite generous) offers of intern
ships and opportunities in the administration
have received little or negative feedback from
the planners. Instead, the leaders of the
campus have actively sought to provide jobs in
Massachusetts Democratic Sen. Ted Ken
nedy's office, et al.
Having worked in the White House. I can at
test that it is an extremely worthwhile
experience regardless of your political persua
sion. I am disturbed that Republican opportu
nities are simply scorned. As a naive academic,
I would think that they would be encouraged
by the University if only for the educational
value of the experience.
I could continue for a long while, but I hope
the point is made. The bottom line is that I
have over the past several years detected a dis
tinct shift in this community. I no longer feel
comfortable as a conservative on this campus.
I feel that my voice is not only unwanted
(which is fine), but unacceptable.
