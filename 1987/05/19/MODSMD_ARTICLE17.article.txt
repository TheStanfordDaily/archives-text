# The 						ASSU can succeed
## 
### 
The ASSU takes in over $600,000 in student
money each year. Yet most students would be hard
pressed to say what It does for them. If you do know
what it does, chances are you don't think the organi
zation is a bastion of democracy and efficiency. It's
the election-date quibbles and the ballot-counting
mix-ups that make Daily headlines and stick in our
minds.

All right, all right. Maybe I'm overly sensitive about
the election and all, having suffered a great deal to
get into office as a Council of Presidents member.
(I'm sure you saw our Equalizer fliers taped to the
stall above your favorite dorm toilet.) But I still think
the question has to be answered: Is the ASSU — or
will it ever — be worth the money?
I think it is. That's why I ran for the COP. I think
the ASSU has some good qualities. I also think
there's a lot of room for us to improve some of its bad
ones.
Let's first look at some of the good points. Few
people seem to realize it. but the ASSU supports all of
its own administrative costs. Through its money
making ventures like the Sunday Flicks, the ASSU
Ad Agency, lecture notes and the T-shirt service, the
ASSU proves it can both provide a student value
while making enough money to cover its own operat
ing expenses.
Lecture notes have gotten me through more than
one 9 a.m. class and Flicks beats the hell out of
riding the old Schwinn down to the Aquarius to see
last year's Cannes winners. Both lecture notes and
the Flicks cost about the same per quarter as two
cases of Burgie — and if you're a beer aficionado, you
know that's cheap.
Another thing I think the ASSU does exceptionally
well is offer the individual a chance to make a differ
ence in the University. Anyone with $60 for fliers can
become a senator. By the same token, any bunch of
four people can become a COP slate. All you need is
some elbow grease.
Once you get into the ASSU. there are a lot of
things you can do. Believe it or not, the Administra
tion takes the ASSU more seriously than we students
take it. When the ASSU Senate passes a resolution —
be it urging divestment or boycotting grapes — rest
assured someone in the University system is listen
ing. Things rarely get done overnight, or even within
the space of a single student's Stanford education (In
my case, five years as of the end of next year), but if
enough people holler long and loud enough, they do
get it done.
The ASSU also gives the average person a chance
to turn ideas into realities. In less than three months
you can form a student group, plan an event and get
it funded. Of course, your ideas have to be good ones.
The program, publications and appropriations fund

ing boards aren't usually too keyed up about wet T
shirt contests, mud wrestling, Yatzee conventions
and the like. But with enough effort and some palm
greasing you could probably even get those things
funded. (That's a joke.)
Lest any of you who know me fear that I've turned
Into some kind of bureaucratic yes-man, however, let
me say this: There is a dark side to the ASSU.
In years past, you've rarely seen senators or other
ASSU officials after their campaigns. There's been a
large amount of student dissatisfaction with funding
and banking processes, projects have been mis
managed and funds misspent (not to mention bills
being poorly constructed, people quitting out of
frustration at the bureaucracy and even — yes. as
heinous as it seems — The Chaparral once controll
ing the COP). Also, communication between the
ASSU and the student body is and has been just a
step above lousy — only the most vocal groups are lis
tened to.
It's little wonder that people tell me that they vote
more for the twenty-and-some-odd-buck fee refund.
It's little wonder that the debate between the COP
slates during the past election was attended by only
about 30 people — and most of them were either the
candidates' girlfriends, boyfriends or people waiting
for "Cheers" to come on the lounge TV. It's little
wonder that only nine graduates (out of, oh. 6,000 or
so) ran for 10 senate seats.
The fact is. I think, that the ASSU is going to have
to earn some respect before students begin taking it
seriously again. It's going to have to prove it's worth
people's time and interest. It's going to have to start
listening to students' opinions and following
through on their recommendations. Maybe then stu
dents will start coming to senate meetings, taking an
interest in elections, hell, maybe even reading the
ASSU News.
I think now is as good a time as any for the ASSU to
start improving. Last year's COP and senate worked
pretty damn hard. This year's senate and COP will
work even harder.
I speak for all of the Equalizers when I say thank
you for giving us the chance to put our ideas into
practice. Stop by the COP office, have a Burgle or a
Coke, and tell us what you think the ASSU should be
doing.
One last thing: After I was criticized for my last
column with a rebuttal titled "Monitor Deems
Durkin Dumb," how can I do anything but apologize
to those diligent defenders of our University library
system, the portal monitors?
I concede: Portal monitoring is a highly demand
ing job. It's tough to tell the five or so Stanford IDs
from blood donor cards, social security cards, etc; to
sit in a chair for four hours at a time without so
much as a thank you from the students whose books
you protect; to work the complex machinery woefully
misnamed a "clicker."
Kidding aside — no hard feelings, eh? There, I
apologized. Now will you give me back my ID and let
me into Green?
