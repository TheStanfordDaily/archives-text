### A. J. THOMAS Staff writer 
Senior Slmone LeVant, who took the NCAA's drug
testing program to court, was among 12 Stanford
students chosen last week to receive a 1986-87
Dean's Award for Service.
LeVant, captain of the women's diving team, filed
suit last January in Santa Clara County Superior
Court challenging the constitutionality of the
NCAA's mandatory drug-Testing requirement. She
was nominated by Athletic Director Andy Geiger for
"reminding us all of the courage it takes to choose
the lonely road that leads from personal principles to
public action."
LeVant said she was "really happy" to get the
award. "Up to now I haven't gotten much response
from anyone for what I did," she said.
In all, seven individual students and one group of
five students were named Dean's Award recipients:
junior Ken Ruebush; seniors Patricia Barrera, Annie
Jenney and Steve Singleton; co-terminal student Jef
frey Upperman; graduate student Gordon Harvey;
and medical students Judy Kimelman, Laurel
McClure, Janet O'Brien, Adrienne Randolph and
David Zucker.
Acting Dean of Student Affairs Norm Robinson
said the purpose of the Dean's Award is to acknowl
edge mainly volunteer efforts by students that other
wise go unrecognized. "There are a large number of
unsung heroes around here â€” people who really
make a difference in the quality of life," Robinson
said.
