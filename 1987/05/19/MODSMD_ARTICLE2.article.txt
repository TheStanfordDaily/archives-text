Senior Slmone LeVant, who took the NCAA's drug
testing program to court, was among 12 Stanford
students chosen last week to receive a 1986-87
Dean's Award for Service.
LeVant, captain of the women's diving team, filed
suit last January in Santa Clara County Superior
Court challenging the constitutionality of the
NCAA's mandatory drug-Testing requirement. She
was nominated by Athletic Director Andy Geiger for
"reminding us all of the courage it takes to choose
the lonely road that leads from personal principles to
public action."
LeVant said she was "really happy" to get the
award. "Up to now I haven't gotten much response
from anyone for what I did," she said.
In all, seven individual students and one group of
five students were named Dean's Award recipients:
junior Ken Ruebush; seniors Patricia Barrera, Annie
Jenney and Steve Singleton; co-terminal student Jef
frey Upperman; graduate student Gordon Harvey;

McClure, Janet O'Brien, Adrienne Randolph and

Acting Dean of Student Affairs Norm Robinson

said.

Chicano community as well as in

Sequoia into "one of the best
student-edited literary journals in
the country ... a distinguished
publication that reflects brightly"
on the University.
Jenney, a senior in interna
tional relations, was recognized
for her efforts as an RAin

as the "boundless energy and
commitment" he demonstrated by

benefits and task forces concern
ing AIDS. Ruebush is also an RA
in Donner.
Singleton, head of the advising
associates program and president
of the Inter-Fraternity Council,

demanding and difficult jobs."
For his wide-ranging contribu
tions to campus residential, athle
tic, media and fraternal organiza
tions and especially his work with
the Black Community Services
Center. Upperman also received a
Dean's Service Award.
A group of five medical students
