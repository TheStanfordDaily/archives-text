## Public service: ‘Translating need into action’ 
### ELIZABETH HENDRICKS Staff writer 
Summer is only a dozen or so
classes and a handful of finals
away, and many students are
starting to think ahead. Maybe
you're still searching for a sum
mer job. Perhaps you've been in
spired by recent Draw results to go
overseas. After all. if you're going
to be off campus, you might as
well be way off campus.
On the other hand, maybe
you're a junior or senior looking
for something different, not ready
for graduate school or corporate
life. If any of these situations
sound familiar, a public service
job could be what you're looking
for.
Public Interest Research Groups
(PIRGS) is looking for student lob
byists. Founded 15 years ago in
Oregon, the group has become a
nationwide organization.
Concerned with political aware
ness and action. PIRGS volunteers
canvass communities promoting
environmental and consumer
protection laws. The employees
share a commitment to these is
sues and a common goal of pass
ing relevant legislation.
PIRGS may provide travel
within the states, but Volunteers
In Asia (VIA) provides the opportu
nity to experience Asian culture
firsthand. Each year, about 30
students from Stanford and UC-

Santa Cruz travel to China.
Japan, Indonesia. Taiwan or the
Philippines.
Most of these volunteers teach
English, the task most requested
by institutions within the
countries. The program started in
1963 when a group of freshmen
who wanted exposure to life
outside Stanford and a way to use
skills that is beneficial to others
initiated the program.
"Volunteers make a positive
contribution to international de
velopment and understanding,"
said Cliff Chan, a VIA staff mem
ber.
VIA operates on a cycle. Stu
dents apply in the fall, are selected
in January, train for six months
and leave in June. Students join
VIA for different reasons.
Sometimes they want a break be
tween Stanford and graduate
school.
Junior Amy Wu, a VIA volun
teer, went to Taiwan in part to
find out more about her own back
ground. Her father is Chinese, so
she grew up almost "biculturally."
"It was a real good time to
reflect. It brought my culture and
beliefs a lot closer to me," Wu said
of her experience in Taiwan.
Junior Bob Kyleberg went to In
donesia in 1984 and ended up
staying for two years instead of
one. Interested in development
and not sure what he wanted to
study here. Kyleberg got involved

with a computer programming
project in Indonesia.
"I feel like I got more out of it
than I gave." he said.
Both volunteers were grateful to
the VIA staff. Wu described the
group as "very cohesive, under
standing. and encouraging."
Volunteers In Service To
America (VISTA) and the Peace
Corps are two organizations that
demand a big commitment.
Originally part of the Peace Corps.
VISTA is a now an independent
group working against poverty in
America. The group serves as an
intermediary between the govern
ment and groups such as
churches that need help imple
menting projects.
The individual groups do their
own recruiting, but VISTA pro
vides information to volunteers
and pays them a subsistence al
lowance and a stipend when their
term is up. Volunteers work for
one year on a single project.
Depending on the location, proj
ects include working with il
literate adults, refugees, battered
women or the homeless.
The Peace Corps recruits people
who are willing to work for two
years, in any of 62 countries,
without much contact with other
Americans.
"They should be people who
have demonstrated leadership,
can work in an unstructured envi
ronment, and can handle con

flict," said Kelly Theisen, a San
Francisco recruiter for the Peace
Corps.
Volunteers are placed based on
requests from the participating
countries. Theisen stresses that
the Peace Corps is "not a lifetime
career," but that it is often "the
first step for people that want to
do international work of any
kind."
Laurie Silver, a University staff
member, will leave for Haiti in Au
gust with the Peace Corps. She
had considered joining the Corps

for some time, and said she thinks
now is an especially good time to
join. Silver already has her
master's degree and said she is
"looking for a new perspective."
Silver said she has been reading
avidly about Haiti and is excited
about her upcoming departure.
She described the elaborate appli
cation process, which entailed the
completion of numerous forms,
fingerprinting and having her
wisdom teeth removed. "If you can
deal with the applications, you
should do fine," she said.

If none of these options seems
attractive, don't give up. The
CPPC often helps to link students
with smaller groups according to
their individual interests.
Ann Greenblat, public service
coordinator, talked about "public
service entrepreneurs." She said
that these jobs offer individuals a
chance to be creative and to use
one's judgment sooner than one
would in the corporate world.
"Stanford students are good at
translating need into action." she
said.

PIRGS may provide travel
within the states, but Volunteers
In Asia (VIA) provides the opportu
nity to experience Asian culture
firsthand. Each year, about 30
students from Stanford and UC-

Santa Cruz travel to China.
Japan, Indonesia. Taiwan or the
Philippines.
Most of these volunteers teach
English, the task most requested
by institutions within the
countries. The program started in
1963 when a group of freshmen
who wanted exposure to life
outside Stanford and a way to use
skills that is beneficial to others
initiated the program.
"Volunteers make a positive
contribution to international de
velopment and understanding,"
said Cliff Chan, a VIA staff mem
ber.
VIA operates on a cycle. Stu
dents apply in the fall, are selected
in January, train for six months
and leave in June. Students join
VIA for different reasons.
Sometimes they want a break be
tween Stanford and graduate
school.
Junior Amy Wu, a VIA volun
teer, went to Taiwan in part to
find out more about her own back
ground. Her father is Chinese, so
she grew up almost "biculturally."
"It was a real good time to
reflect. It brought my culture and
beliefs a lot closer to me," Wu said
of her experience in Taiwan.
Junior Bob Kyleberg went to In
donesia in 1984 and ended up
staying for two years instead of
one. Interested in development
and not sure what he wanted to
study here. Kyleberg got involved

with a computer programming
project in Indonesia.
"I feel like I got more out of it
than I gave." he said.
Both volunteers were grateful to
the VIA staff. Wu described the
group as "very cohesive, under
standing. and encouraging."
Volunteers In Service To
America (VISTA) and the Peace
Corps are two organizations that
demand a big commitment.
Originally part of the Peace Corps.
VISTA is a now an independent
group working against poverty in
America. The group serves as an
intermediary between the govern
ment and groups such as
churches that need help imple
menting projects.
The individual groups do their
own recruiting, but VISTA pro
vides information to volunteers
and pays them a subsistence al
lowance and a stipend when their
term is up. Volunteers work for
one year on a single project.
Depending on the location, proj
ects include working with il
literate adults, refugees, battered
women or the homeless.
The Peace Corps recruits people
who are willing to work for two
years, in any of 62 countries,
without much contact with other
Americans.
"They should be people who
have demonstrated leadership,
can work in an unstructured envi
ronment, and can handle con

flict," said Kelly Theisen, a San
Francisco recruiter for the Peace
Corps.
Volunteers are placed based on
requests from the participating
countries. Theisen stresses that
the Peace Corps is "not a lifetime
career," but that it is often "the
first step for people that want to
do international work of any
kind."
Laurie Silver, a University staff
member, will leave for Haiti in Au
gust with the Peace Corps. She
had considered joining the Corps

for some time, and said she thinks
now is an especially good time to
join. Silver already has her
master's degree and said she is
"looking for a new perspective."
Silver said she has been reading
avidly about Haiti and is excited
about her upcoming departure.
She described the elaborate appli
cation process, which entailed the
completion of numerous forms,
fingerprinting and having her
wisdom teeth removed. "If you can
deal with the applications, you
should do fine," she said.

If none of these options seems
attractive, don't give up. The
CPPC often helps to link students
with smaller groups according to
their individual interests.
Ann Greenblat, public service
coordinator, talked about "public
service entrepreneurs." She said
that these jobs offer individuals a
chance to be creative and to use
one's judgment sooner than one
would in the corporate world.
"Stanford students are good at
translating need into action." she
said.
