# Bug lost in a maze at Florence Moore Hall

Dear Bug Me:
Which soft drink has the highest caf
feine, wide-awake, zinger power? Not
including insane fluids like Jolt, of
course. I've heard that Mountain Dew is
the juice of choice, but I need some con
firmation before I can commit myself.
- Mr. Visine
Good call on the Mountain Dew. Check
ing in at a hefty 52 milligrams per 12-
ounce can. in the major soft drink market

it falls second only to Jolt's 71 mg. per
can.
But aside from giving their imbibers —
and in turn their sales — that extra lift,
soda pop producers justify caffeine addi
tions for a variety of reasons. Cola nut ex
tract flavoring has caffeine naturally, so
pop must have at least a trace of caffeine
to be labeled cola. Nice rationalization, ex
cept that over 95 percent of the caffeine in
your basic cola beverage is added by the
manufacturers themselves.
Explaining caffeine's presence in
citrus-based pop — Sunkist Orange in
particular — a Sunkist official told Con

sumer Reports caffeine "suppresses that
syrupy-sweet aftertaste. The bitter note
that caffeine provides cuts the sweetness
and gives you a more rounded flavor."
So, where the heck is all this caffeine
coming from anyway? You guessed it. The
soft drink industry annually buys up over
two million pounds of caffeine from coffee
producers who have removed it to make
decaffeinated coffee.
Dear Bug Me:
Why is Flo Mo in such a ridiculous
shape? It's almost impossible to get
around, and if I hadn't been living there

for the past three years, I'd get lost as of
ten as everybody else.
-Lost in a maze
A bit unconventional perhaps, but
there is method behind the madness. As
explained by Gene Kershner, associate di
rector of Facilities Project Management,
the Florence Moore idea was to avoid
making a dorm with the personality of a
massive cement block. The spokes radiat
ing around the central kitchen area are
designed to be small communities. Con
veniently enough, each leg of the spider is
alphabetically ordered by its Spanish bird

name.
Dear Bug Me:
How. aside from sending stuff to you at
The Daily, can I send something to Bug
Me?
- Just Wondering
This should remind you that every
question you ever see in the Bug Me
column was sent in by a real person with
a real desire to know. A person just like
you. So keep on sending stuff to "Bug-Me"
through a popular LOTS Shakespearean
tragedy, or to Bug Me care of The Daily.
