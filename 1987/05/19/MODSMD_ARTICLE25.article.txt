### KEN STEVENS Senior staff writer 
LOS ANGELES — The first day of the NCAA
women's tennis individuals was marked by up
sets. and none was more significant than Lisa
Green's 5-7, 6-4, 6-4 second-round singles vic
tory over third-seeded Ronni Reis of Miami
(Fla.) yesterday at the Sunset Courts on the
UCLA campus.
The upset placed the Stanford freshman in
this morning's third round, where she will be
joined by teammates Patty Fendick and Steph
anie Savides. Fendick and Savides also ad
vanced yesterday to the second round in the
doubles tournament.
After outlasting Indiana's Candy Kopetzki,
6-3, 2-6, 6-2, in an early-morning first-round
match, Green posted the biggest win in her
young college career with the victory over Reis.
The left-handed Reis, one of the most potent
serve-and-volley players in the nation, over
powered Green at times with her serve, but
Green outstroked Reis from the baseline and
came up with enough passing shots to win the
match.

Green lost the first set after taking a 5-3
lead, but she came right back to win the
second set and take a 3-0 lead In the third.
Reis then rallied to even the score at 4-4. "We
were both up and down," Green said. "That
happens to me a lot."
Serving at 3-3 in the next game. Green saw
Reis follow a short ball into the net. Green hit a
backhand passing shot that Reis covered well,
but she put it into the net.
Green then had a match point when she
fought to 3-3 on Reis' serve in the 10th game of
the set. Reis once again attempted to come to
the net, but her approach shot found the net,
and Green had recorded the upset.
With Reis, seventh-seeded Ingelise Driehuis
of Clemson, Stephanie Harges of USC and
Jane Thomas of UCLA all losing yesterday,
there are no more seeded players remaining in
Green's quarter of the bracket. Green plays in
the third round today at 11 a.m. against Okla
homa State's Tessa Price.
Fendick was not afflicted by yesterday's rash
of upsets. The tournament's top seed blasted
Arizona's Chris Seiffert, 6-0, 6-0, in the first
round, then rallied from a 4-2 deficit in the

first set of her second-round match against
Brigham Young's Susanna Lee to post a 6-4, 6-
0 victory.
Fendick's bracket is the most difficult of the
four. She will play Miami's Lise Gregory at 11
a.m. today, and if she gets by Gregory, she will
take on the winner of the match between
Monique Javer of San Diego State and Jill Het
herington of Florida in the quarterfinals.
Like Green, Savides now finds herself in
good position, as the two top seeds in her
bracket have already fallen. Savides struggled
herself, but came on strong late in both
matches to post victories.
Arizona's Betsy Somerville took Savides to a
first-set tiebreaker in their first-round match,
but Savides prevailed 7-5 in the tiebreaker and
then rolled to a 7-6, 6-1 victory.
In the second round, Savides was matched
against Georgia's Laurie Friedland, who had
knocked off Kentucky's Sonia Hahn, the No. 4
seed. Friedland continued to roll, taking the
first set from Savides. 6-4.
Savides forced a third set by narrowly pull-
ing out a 7-5 victory in the second.
In the final set. Savides began to
pressure Friedland and walked off
the court with a 4-6, 7-5, 6-1 win.
"Once I saw that I had a great
c hance to win. 1 played really well."
Savides said.

Savldes plays SMU's Jennifer
Santrock this morning at 11.
Junior Kay Tittle, the Cardinal's
other entrant in the singles draw,
gave second-seeded Beverly Bowes
of Texas a scare before losing 4-6,
6-1. 6-2 in the first round.
Fendick and Savides wasted
little time in knocking off Texas'
Lanae Renschler and Robin Field
6-2, 6-1 in yesterday's opening
round of doubles.
