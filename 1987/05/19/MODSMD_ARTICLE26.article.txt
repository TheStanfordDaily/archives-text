### DON HOGUE 
En route to a third-place finish
in the Pacific Coast Champion
ships at Lake Natoma in
Sacramento last weekend, the
Stanford men's crews swept the
University of Washington crews —
a feat that Stanford oarsmen had
never before accomplished.
Both the men's and women's
crews shared third-place finishes
at the regatta, pacing Stanford to
seven thirds and one second.
Stanford's women placed third
behind Pac-10 champion Wash
ington and second-place finisher
UCLA. A perennial favorite in
crew, the Husky women have won
nine of the past 11 conference
titles.
"I'm very proud of the way they

rowed this weekend," said
Women's Crew Coach John Davis.
"The (women's) varsity was up
against two tough crews, Wash
ington and UCLA. They charged
and kept right with them."
Stanford women's crews, along
with California, will host the Col
legiate Nationals at Lake Natoma
this weekend.
"These next two weeks will be
critical for us," said Davis. "We
will use the time to taper for na
tionals, and perhaps make a few
changes in the boat."
UCLA took conference honors in
the men's varsity race, edging
second-place California by three
seconds. The upset-minded Stan
ford crew took third place, beating
fourth-place Washington for the
first time in 20 years, and by six
seconds.

The heavily favored men's frosh
crew lost by a fifth of a second in
the finals to Orange Coast College,
a boat that Stanford had beaten
twice this season. Stanford's
frosh, however, were declared con
ference champions as they were
the first Pac-10 boat to finish.
The third-place finish of the
junior varsity boat pleased Men's
Crew Coach Ken Dreyfuss. "The
JV boat went from 23 seconds be
hind Washington last year to an
unbelievable performance this
year," said Dreyfuss. "They've had
a tough season, but this was a big
win for them. On the varsity level,
we've picked up 13 seconds on
Washington and 10 seconds on
Cal in one year. We've reached the
point wliere we can say we've got a
very strong men's crew."

Stanford qualified for the grand
finals in each of the nine events it
had entered during Saturday's
preliminary heats. During the
finals on Sunday. Stanford also
garnered third-place finishes in
the men's frosh/novice-fours, the
women's junior varsity and the
frosh/novice-eights and fours as
well as a fourth-place finish in the
men's varsity fours.
Crews from the entire West
Coast compete in the Pac
-10/Pacific Coast Championships,
including the eight Pac-10 schools
that sponsor crew — Arizona and
Arizona State being the excep
tions. The first crew to finish is
declared Pacific Coast champion,
and the first Pac-10 boat to cross
the finish line is the Pac-10 cham
pion.
