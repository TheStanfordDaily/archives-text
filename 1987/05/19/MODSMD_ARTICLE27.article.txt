Washington State. UC-Santa
Barbara. Wichita State, Minne
sota and Oral Roberts Univer
sity will join Stanford at the
West I Regional at Sunken Dia
mond this weekend, it was an
nounced yesterday.
Oral Roberts and Washing
ton State will open the regional
at 9 a.m. Friday. UCSB will
meet Wichita State at 12:30
p.m., and Stanford will play its
first game at 4 p.m. against
Minnesota.
Should the Cardinal defeat
the Golden Gophers, it will take
on the loser of the UCSB-
Wichita State game on Satur
day. A Stanford loss would
match the Cardinal against the
loser of Friday's 9 a.m. contest.
The Cardinal gets the luxury
of playing a loser on Saturday
regardless of its first-game
outcome because it is the top
seed in the regional. The No. 1
seeds in each of the eight
regionals were also the top
eight teams in last week's
Baseball America poll. In the
poll Stanford was ranked
second. The Cardinal con
cluded its regular season as the
Pacific 10 Southern Division
champions with a 21-9 record.
44-16 overall.
The other teams are seeded
in the following order: Wichita
State, WSU, Oral Roberts,
UCSB and Minnesota.
Wichita State brings a 58-18
record into postseason play.
The Shockers won the Missouri
Valley Conference title and are
currently ranked 18th in the
nation.

The Pacific 10 Northern Divi
sion champ has usually fared
poorly at regionals, but WSU is
the third seed. The Cougars
took the Pac-10 North with an
18-6 record, then swept
through the conference tourna
ment with four straight wins to
finish 42-17 overall. WSU is
ranked 25th by Baseball
America.
Oral Roberts is also a regular
season and conference tourna
ment champion, winning both
crowns in the Midwest Col
legiate Conference. The Titans
went 45-17 on the year and are
No. 30 in the country according
to ESPN/Collegiate Baseball.
There is no truth to the
rumor that the school's
namesake will be "called home
by God" if the team does not ad
vance to the College World Se
ries.
UCSB has one of the worst
records among the 48 NCAA
teams at 30-23-2. but the
Gauchos earned a regional
berth probably on the strength
of their schedule, which in
cluded two wins in three games
over both Stanford and top
ranked Texas. UCSB played at
Sunken Diamond in a 1983
regional.
Like the Pac-10. the Big Ten
Conference splits in baseball.
Minnesota claimed the Big Ten
West title with a 12-4 confer
ence mark. The Gophers went
36-23 overall and are ranked
28th by ESPN/Collegiate
Baseball.
The Six-Pac's reputation as
the nation's toughest confer
ence was reinforced yesterday
when three of the league's five
other teams received at-large
berths.
UCLA and Arizona State, which
finished tied for second in the
conference with 16-14 records,
were expected to make the field,
but it appeared that NCAA cham
pion Arizona would — like Louis
ville in basketball and Stanford in
men's tennis — not get the chance
to defend its title.
Even after being swept by
Arizona State last weekend, the
Wildcats managed to land a
regional berth. All three of the
other Six-Pac teams besides Stan
ford will play in the West II
