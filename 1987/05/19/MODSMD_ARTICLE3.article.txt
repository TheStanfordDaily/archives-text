# Students stage five-hour sit-in
## 
### JOHN POLLACK Senior staff writer 
Twenty-one demonstrators from
the Rainbow Agenda staged a five
hour sit-in at the president's office
in Building 10 yesterday until a
previously scheduled meeting
with University administrators
produced a settlement regarding
their demands.
The Rainbow Agenda, a coali
tion of campus minority groups
and other students, demanded
that the University sponsor a
forum on campus racism and ap
point an outside commission to
study both racism and the quality
of minority life at Stanford.
At a 2 p.m. meeting in Building
170, three University administra
tors on the recently appointed
committee on racism and Michael
Jackson, assistant to the provost,
struck a compromise deal with
members of the Rainbow Agenda.
The agreement includes Univer
sity sponsorship and support of a
forum on campus racism and a
commitment to appoint a com
mission to study minority con
cerns.
The commission, however, will
include Stanford officials and
members from outside the Univer
sity.
This compromise settlement
came hours after University Presi
dent Donald Kennedy had
released a statement referring the
Rainbow Agenda's demands to the
committee on racism for review.
Kennedy left early yesterday for
New York and was not present for
the sit-in.
Upon hearing the results of the
meeting between Rainbow Agenda
leaders and University adminis
trators, the demonstrators left
Building 10 peacefully.
"We didn't get exactly what we

wanted but we did get a positive
commitment from the provost's
office (about the forum)," said
Jerilyn Lopez Mendoza, a member
of the Rainbow Agenda who
negotiated \Vith the University.
"We also got a positive commit
ment to establish some kind of
mechanism to study minority life
on campus," she added.
The demands for the forum and
the commission were submitted
to Kennedy last Friday partly out
of concern stemming from the
recent circulation of anonymous
satirical literature opposing the
Rainbow Agenda.
According to Bill King, incom
ing chair of the Black Student Un
ion (BSU). the sit-in was staged to
pressure the University Adminis
tration into taking concrete action
on race-related issues before the
end of the quarter.
"We want to talk to the people
who are making the decisions."
King said during the sit-in. King
did not sit in, but served as a
press contact outside of Building
10. ,
After the sit-in began at about
11:30 a.m., campus police locked
the building and refused entry to
everyone except University
employees. Demonstrators were
denied bathroom facilities and
access to water, and were not
allowed to speak with anyone
outside the building.
Communication was possible,
however, through handwritten
notes held up to the windows.
When asked if the demonstrators
would settle for just the commis
sion, a Rainbow Agenda spokes
person wrote, "No. Today we want
both the commission and the
forum."
