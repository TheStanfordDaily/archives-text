# Students stage five-hour sit-in
## 
### JOHN POLLACK Senior staff writer 
Twenty-one demonstrators from
the Rainbow Agenda staged a five
hour sit-in at the president's office
in Building 10 yesterday until a
previously scheduled meeting
with University administrators
produced a settlement regarding
their demands.
The Rainbow Agenda, a coali
tion of campus minority groups
and other students, demanded
that the University sponsor a
forum on campus racism and ap
point an outside commission to
study both racism and the quality
of minority life at Stanford.
At a 2 p.m. meeting in Building
170, three University administra
tors on the recently appointed
committee on racism and Michael
Jackson, assistant to the provost,
struck a compromise deal with
members of the Rainbow Agenda.
The agreement includes Univer
sity sponsorship and support of a
forum on campus racism and a
commitment to appoint a com
mission to study minority con
cerns.
The commission, however, will
include Stanford officials and
members from outside the Univer
sity.
This compromise settlement
came hours after University Presi
dent Donald Kennedy had
released a statement referring the
Rainbow Agenda's demands to the
committee on racism for review.
Kennedy left early yesterday for
New York and was not present for
the sit-in.
Upon hearing the results of the
meeting between Rainbow Agenda
leaders and University adminis
trators, the demonstrators left
Building 10 peacefully.
"We didn't get exactly what we

wanted but we did get a positive
commitment from the provost's
office (about the forum)," said
Jerilyn Lopez Mendoza, a member
of the Rainbow Agenda who
negotiated \Vith the University.
"We also got a positive commit
ment to establish some kind of
mechanism to study minority life
on campus," she added.
The demands for the forum and
the commission were submitted
to Kennedy last Friday partly out
of concern stemming from the
recent circulation of anonymous
satirical literature opposing the
Rainbow Agenda.
According to Bill King, incom
ing chair of the Black Student Un
ion (BSU). the sit-in was staged to
pressure the University Adminis
tration into taking concrete action
on race-related issues before the
end of the quarter.
"We want to talk to the people
who are making the decisions."
King said during the sit-in. King
did not sit in, but served as a
press contact outside of Building
10. ,
After the sit-in began at about
11:30 a.m., campus police locked
the building and refused entry to
everyone except University
employees. Demonstrators were
denied bathroom facilities and
access to water, and were not
allowed to speak with anyone
outside the building.
Communication was possible,
however, through handwritten
notes held up to the windows.
When asked if the demonstrators
would settle for just the commis
sion, a Rainbow Agenda spokes
person wrote, "No. Today we want
both the commission and the
forum."
"They (the Administration)

know the demands, they have
known them for 20 years," an
other note stated. The note
referred to similar demands about
minority concerns which were
issued during campus protests in
1968 and 1973.
The meeting between the com
mittee on racism and members of
the Rainbow Agenda which
produced the settlement had been
scheduled since last week. Accord
ing to committee member and
Asst. to the Provost Jacyn Lewis,
the atmosphere of the meeting
was "cooperative." She called the
meeting "a productive beginning."
"I think everybody was inter
ested in making some progress
discussing the problems with an
open mind." Lewis said after the
meeting.
Lewis acknowledged that the
sit-in was a factor in the discus
sion, but stressed that the Univer
sity was anxious to resolve the

issue of racism on campus.
The committee on racism
promised the Rainbow Agenda
logistic and financial support for
the forum on campus racism, but
did not guarantee either Ken
nedy's or Provost James Rosse's
participation in the event.
The forum is scheduled for this
Thursday at 7 p.m. in Kresge
Auditorium.
"Neither the president nor the
provost will play a visible role (in
the forum)," Lewis said, but she
added that it "certainly has their
support and endorsement."
Although members of the Rain
bow Agenda were pleased about
the forum, they said that Ken
nedy, as president of the Univer
sity, should participate.
"1 feel like he's passing the
buck," Mendoza said.
Members of the Rainbow
Agenda said they plan to continue
the struggle against campus rac
ism, and that the forum and yes
terday's sit-in are only the begin
ning of an ongoing process. Ac
cording to BSU chair Amanda
Kemp, yesterday's sit-in was "just
the beginning."

ing chair of the Black Student Un
ion (BSU). the sit-in was staged to
pressure the University Adminis
tration into taking concrete action
on race-related issues before the
end of the quarter.
"We want to talk to the people
who are making the decisions."
King said during the sit-in. King
did not sit in, but served as a
press contact outside of Building
10. ,
After the sit-in began at about
11:30 a.m., campus police locked
the building and refused entry to
everyone except University
employees. Demonstrators were
denied bathroom facilities and
access to water, and were not
allowed to speak with anyone
outside the building.
Communication was possible,
however, through handwritten
notes held up to the windows.
When asked if the demonstrators
would settle for just the commis
sion, a Rainbow Agenda spokes
person wrote, "No. Today we want
both the commission and the
forum."

know the demands, they have
known them for 20 years," an
other note stated. The note
referred to similar demands about
minority concerns which were
issued during campus protests in
1968 and 1973.
The meeting between the com
mittee on racism and members of
the Rainbow Agenda which
produced the settlement had been
scheduled since last week. Accord
ing to committee member and
Asst. to the Provost Jacyn Lewis,
the atmosphere of the meeting
was "cooperative." She called the
meeting "a productive beginning."
"I think everybody was inter
ested in making some progress
discussing the problems with an
open mind." Lewis said after the
meeting.
Lewis acknowledged that the
sit-in was a factor in the discus
sion, but stressed that the Univer
sity was anxious to resolve the

issue of racism on campus.
The committee on racism
promised the Rainbow Agenda
logistic and financial support for
the forum on campus racism, but
did not guarantee either Ken
nedy's or Provost James Rosse's
participation in the event.
The forum is scheduled for this
Thursday at 7 p.m. in Kresge
Auditorium.
"Neither the president nor the
provost will play a visible role (in
the forum)," Lewis said, but she
added that it "certainly has their
support and endorsement."
Although members of the Rain
bow Agenda were pleased about
the forum, they said that Ken
nedy, as president of the Univer
sity, should participate.
"1 feel like he's passing the
buck," Mendoza said.
Members of the Rainbow
Agenda said they plan to continue
the struggle against campus rac
ism, and that the forum and yes
terday's sit-in are only the begin
ning of an ongoing process. Ac
cording to BSU chair Amanda
Kemp, yesterday's sit-in was "just
the beginning."
