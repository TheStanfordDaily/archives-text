# Solar car group sponsors rally

### BOBBY ARNSDORF 
A gold 1980 Chevette hatchback became an
unlikely hero Saturday for the members of the
Stanford Solar Car Project, as the car made a
successful debut in the Centennial Electric Ve
hicle Rally sponsored by the group.
The car, converted from gasoline to electrical
power by the student group and charged by
solar energy from photovoltaic cells, was one of
22 electric vehicles participating in the
daylong rally around campus.
According to Dr. John Reuyl, Schiff House
resident fellow and adviser to the group, the
rally was held to show Centennial visitors the
feasibility and practicality of electric-powered
transportation. Rally participants, including'a
large contingent of Electric Auto Association
members, drove visitors around campus and
displayed their vehicles as well as other tech
nological innovations in the field of solar and
electric energy.
Senior Julie Brown, one of the visitors to the
rally, seemed surprised by the car's perfor
mance as she rode around the three-mile rally
circuit. "It feels really normal," she said.
On hand for the event was Paul MacCready,
renowned for such innovative transportation
devices as the human-powered airplanes "The

Gossamer Condor" and"The Gossamer Al
batross," and the Solar Challenger, a plane
propelled by photovoltaic solar cells.
After giving an informal slide presentation of
his work to project members, he noted that
"there are some very nice features to electric
cars," and added that their practical value will
increase as gasoline prices continue to climb.
In preparation for a race across Australia.
MacCready is currently working on a photovol
taic car that should go 50 mph on one horse
power of solar energy. Such projects "force you
to address lots of new technical questions that
may be very valuable," he said. "It's worth
doing now because in the long run it's going to
be needed."
Another display designed by project mem
bers was an operating simulation of a solar
powered dwelling and transportation system,
capable of operating without gas or electric
utilities. Photovoltaic cells mounted on the
roof of a residence would collect and transform
solar energy into electricity. The electricity
would then be stored in two sets of batteries,
one group in the house and one in the car, to
serve both residential and transportation
needs.
On Saturday, the Chevette's batteries were

charged directly from an array of solar cells on
loan from Arco Solar Co. These cells, in turn,
powered the electric motor that replaced the
internal combustion engine that the group
had removed.
Alternately, the solar eel's could charge the
house's batteries during the day when the car
is in use. At night, the cells would recharge the
car's batteries as the car sits in storage.
"The purpose of this project is to demon
strate the concept of this type of a system and
its benefits in reducing air pollution and in
creasing energy self-reliance," Reuyl said.
Though such a system is not at present as
economically favorable as traditional ones be
cause of a large initial expenditure, it could
have immediate practical applications in iso
lated regions not served by power companies
and could prove very important in the future,
he said.
"The bottom line is that the costs of
photovoltaic systems are declining while the
costs of fossil fuel and nuclear energy are in
creasing." said Reuyl.
MacCready praised the participatory ap
proach the Solar Car Project has used in con
verting the Chevette. "Anything that involves
hands-on work is so valuable," he noted.
