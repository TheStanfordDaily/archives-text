# Student documentary
## Film will show Stanford SDI research 
### JOHN POLLACK Senior staff writer 
Stanford's involvement with "Star Wars" research
will be the subject of a student video documentary
scheduled for release next fall, according to a press
release issued by Stanford Action for Nuclear Dis
armament (STAND).
The proposed 30-minute video, which will focus on
Stanford research projects associated with the Stra
tegic Defense Initiative (SDI), has two purposes, ac
cording to the press release.
"The twin goals of the project are to survey and ex
amine the specific SDI research projects now under
way on campus and to sample all shades of local
opinion concerning the appropriateness of this re
search," the press release stated.
Diane Honigberg, one of the project's organizers

and a co-terminal student in psychology and educa
tion, said there is currently $23 million worth of SDl
related research being conducted at Stanford. "We'd
like to see what they (Stanford researchers) are doing
and how they feel about what they're doing," she
said.
Although the video project was initiated by STAND
— a student group that seeks to reduce the probabil
ity of nuclear war through lobbying and educational
efforts about disarmament — Its organizers insist
that the documentary will be unbiased in its examin
ation of SDI.
"We are going to give pro and con sides of the
issue," Honigberg said. She added that only two of
the 10 students on the committee in charge of the
video are members of STAND, and that two other
students who are "undecided" about SDI will be in
terviewing the Stanford researchers.

Scott Bohning, a STAND member and a graduate
student in civil engineering, echoed Honigberg's
defense of the proposed video. "They (the video com
mittee) are really trying to pay attention" to any po
tential bias in the video, Bohning said.
Bohning pointed out that there will be little narra
tion in the video, and stressed that all points of view
regarding SDI will be represented.
Bohning is not on the committee in charge of the
video.
The project — which will cost approximately
$1,300 — is being funded by the ASSU Program
Board. The video will probably be completed next fall,
and will be shown in campus houses and dormitor
ies in cooperation with Residential Education.
Individuals or groups wishing to contribute their
opinion to the project can contact Honigberg.
