# Newsman calls downfall of Hart's campaign 'inevitable'
## 
### LORI SILVER Staff writer 
Former presidential candidate
Gary Hart "brought down the
curtain on his own career" by
being seen with actress Donna
Rice, according to the West
Coast producer of ABC National
News.
Lyn Jones, who also covered
Hart's campaign in 1984. spoke
to approximately 40 people in
Toyon Hall last night on ethics
in the media.
Jones said that rumors about
Hart's sexual conduct surfaced
in the '84 campaign but were
never reported because no one
got a solid tip.
When Jones covered Hart's
campaign in '84, he said he felt
"there was always something
uneasy, not quite right . . .
something that didn't feel
genuine" about Hart.
"We didn't feel that he was

being honest with us, and he
wasn't," Jones said.
Hart's seemingly adulterous
conduct with actress Donna
Rice showed Hart's poor judg
ment and "a certain flaw in his
character." Jones said.
With the large amount of time
the press spends covering presi
dential candidates, serious
character flaws will inevitably be
detected. Jones said.
Jones characterized Hart's
conduct as arrogant and "just
plain stupid."
Citing Hart's reluctance to
expose his private life to public
scrutiny in his '84 campaign.
Jones described Hart as some
one who "thought he was above
it all. He didn't have to toe the
mark."
Before the Vietnam War.
Jones said that the press had an
unwritten, "good old boy" un
derstanding not to publish the
sexual conduct and affairs of

presidential candidates.
The war resulted in an adver
sarial relationship between jour
nalists and government, which
led to greater scrutiny of the
characters of presidential candi
dates. Jones said.
Jones termed the modern
presidential contest as "an en
durance contest" in which "the
candidates that hold up the best
and look the best . . . become
the winner."
In regards to the Miami
Herald's decision to print the
Hart story. Jones said that "any
news organization that got a tip
like [the Miami Herald did]
would have had to follow it up
whether they liked to or not.
"A lot of us would have liked it
if it had happened a different
way. It was still a little seamy.
But. and I hate to say it.the
ends justify the means." Jones
said.
If he had been in the place of the
Miami Herald, Jones said that he
would have done a better job
staking out Hart's tmvnhouse by
taking pictures and watching
the house's back door
Hart was the first presidential
candidate ever publicly asked if he
had committed adultery, Jones
said.
"The adultery question would be
unethical to ask if it was not an

issue. Under the circumstances, I
think it was ethical." Jones said.
Commenting on the public's
negative reaction to the press's
treatment of Hart, Jones said that
the press isn't "out to win a
popularity contest."
While intense public scrutiny of
candidates has turned elections
into a "truly democratic process,"
Jones admitted that intense press
coverage has its drawbacks.
Press coverage "puts the life of a
presidential candidate into a
goldfish bowl. That may be why
some of the best leaders in the
country choose not to run for
president," Jones said.
