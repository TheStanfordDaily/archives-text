## 
### LORI SILVER Staff writer 
Former presidential candidate
Gary Hart "brought down the
curtain on his own career" by
being seen with actress Donna
Rice, according to the West
Coast producer of ABC National
News.
Lyn Jones, who also covered
Hart's campaign in 1984. spoke
to approximately 40 people in
Toyon Hall last night on ethics
in the media.
Jones said that rumors about
Hart's sexual conduct surfaced
in the '84 campaign but were
never reported because no one
got a solid tip.
When Jones covered Hart's
campaign in '84, he said he felt
"there was always something
uneasy, not quite right . . .
something that didn't feel
genuine" about Hart.
"We didn't feel that he was

being honest with us, and he
wasn't," Jones said.
Hart's seemingly adulterous
conduct with actress Donna
Rice showed Hart's poor judg
ment and "a certain flaw in his
character." Jones said.
With the large amount of time
the press spends covering presi
dential candidates, serious
character flaws will inevitably be
detected. Jones said.
Jones characterized Hart's
conduct as arrogant and "just
plain stupid."
Citing Hart's reluctance to
expose his private life to public
scrutiny in his '84 campaign.
Jones described Hart as some
one who "thought he was above
it all. He didn't have to toe the
mark."
Before the Vietnam War.
Jones said that the press had an
unwritten, "good old boy" un
derstanding not to publish the
sexual conduct and affairs of

presidential candidates.
The war resulted in an adver
sarial relationship between jour
nalists and government, which
led to greater scrutiny of the
characters of presidential candi
dates. Jones said.
Jones termed the modern
presidential contest as "an en
durance contest" in which "the
candidates that hold up the best
and look the best . . . become
the winner."
In regards to the Miami
Herald's decision to print the
Hart story. Jones said that "any
news organization that got a tip
like [the Miami Herald did]
would have had to follow it up
whether they liked to or not.
"A lot of us would have liked it
if it had happened a different
way. It was still a little seamy.
But. and I hate to say it.the
ends justify the means." Jones
