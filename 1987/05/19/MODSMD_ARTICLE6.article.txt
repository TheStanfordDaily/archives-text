### KRISTIN BARENDSEN Staff writer 
Interaction between persons
with disabilities and those with
out is the goal of "Breaking Down
Barriers: Focus on Disability," a
series of workshops about issues
related to disability which began
yesterday and continues in dorms
through Friday.
"Disability is a situation of life
that everybody has to deal with at
some point, whether I he person
with the disability is a family
member, a friend or oneself," said
senior Danny Kodmur, who has
been involved in Stanford for Dis
ability Awareness. "If you refuse to
deal with it. you isolate the person
with the disability and you isolate
yourself."
Panels composed mainly of stu
dents and staff members with dis
abilities will meet in dorms to dis
cuss personal experiences and ex
plore topics including relation
ships, stigmas, families, employ
ment, sex and stereotypes.
The event is sponsored by Stan
ford for Disability Awareness, a
group that was formed this year
by sophomore Elliott Brown, Kod

mur and others.
Brown said that many people
"avoid interactions with disabled
people because they are afraid to
say something wrong.
"There are no rules, no wrong
things to say. It's a hell of a lot
worse to say nothing," Brown
said.
According to Kodmur, who will
participate in two of this week's
panel discussions: "People tend to
label people with disabilities as
'them,' setting 'them' apart as a
separate group. We want to try to
break down abstractions and deal
with what's happening in life."
â€¢ Jim Bouquin, director of the
Stanford Disabilities Resource
Center, said, "Without interac
tion. people tend to latch on to
media stereotypes."
Bouquin. acting as an "informal
adviser" for the program, said he
sees workshops as "one hundred
times more valuable" than a high
publicity rally.
"This is an opportunity to focus
in-depth on matters related to dis
ability . , . and to walk away with
something valuable," he said.
According to Kodmur,
"Breaking Down Barriers" is espe

cially timely because Stanford's
enrollment of students with dis
abilities is expected to increase
significantly in the future.
Bouquin agreed with Kodmur's
prediction, attributing the
projected increase to "great
strides in accessibility in the past
few years."
Bouquin called the Stanford Ad
ministration "very supportive" in
regard to accessibility for disabled
persons.
Kodmur, who uses a wheel
chair, has been involved in several
programs related to disability at
Stanford, including an access
board and a student support
group.
"We're going to scare the hell out
of people when we talk about the
temporary nature of physical abil
ity," Kodmur said.
Brown, who does not have a dis
ability. said that some people have
questioned his credibility in or
ganizing such an event because
he has not experienced disability
firsthand.
