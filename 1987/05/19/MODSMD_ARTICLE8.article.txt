Court expands civil rights law
WASHINGTON — The Supreme Court, significantly expanding
the scope of a major federal civil rights law. ruled unanimously
yesterday that it protects not only racial minorities but also Jews,
Arabs and other ethnic groups from discrimination.
Justice Byron White, writing for the court, said the 1866 Civil
Rights Act, which allows a broad range of suits for damages by vic
tims of discrimination, was clearly intended to protect people who
are "subjected to intentional discrimination solely because of
their ancestry or ethnic characteristics." Congress did not intend
to confine use of the law when it used the word "race" 121 years
ago, he said, but w.anted to include what are now seen as ethnic
groups.
The opinions came in a pair of cases, one of which involved a
suit by a Silver Spring, Md., synagogue against vandals who
sprayed the building with anti-Semitic slogans. The holding was
hailed as a major victory by Jewish. Arab and Hispanic groups,
which said the court had given them an important new weapon to
fight discrimination in employment and other areas.
Kohl switches position on arms
BONN, West Germany — Chancellor Helmut Kohl, under pres
sure from West German voters and his NATO allies to accept a pro
posed superpower deal on European-based nuclear missiles, said
yesterday that his government would not allow its doubts over a
Soviet offer on short-range missiles to stand in the way of an ac
cord.
Kohl's comments, at a news conference, indicated that West
Germany was moving toward accepting the Soviet offer to remove
from Europe all missiles with ranges of between 300 and 600
miles as long as certain conditions were met. according to govern
ment sources and Western diplomats.
West Germany currently stands alone among NATO members in
resisting the Soviet offer.
The United States and Soviet Union already have agreed on the
broad outlines of a pact to remove from Europe all medium-range
missiles, or those with ranges of between 600 and 3,000 miles.
West Germany strongly supports that part of the deal.
But agreement has been delayed by Bonn's reluctance to
embrace an additional Soviet offer, made last month, to remove all
missiles with ranges of between 300 and 600 miles.
Students, police clash in Korea
SEOUL, South Korea — Students clashed with the police yester
day here and in Kwangju, the provincial capital where seven years
ago to the day almost 200 people were killed demonstrating
against a power grab by President Chun Doo Hwan. Yesterday's
demonstrators at KwangjU burned Chun in effigy.
Coincidentally, the Bank of Korea announced yesterday that
South Korea's economic growth in the first three months of the
year was an impressive 15.6 percent.
The economic announcement, coupled with signs of business
as usual — bustling shoppers, the usual traffic jams — indicated
that political unrest has failed to cause any significant disruption,
even on the anniversary of what has come to be known as the
Kwangju incident.
On May 18. 1980, amid widespread unrest following a military
coup that had given Chun, then arl army general, effective control
of the country, students and dissidents rose up at Kwangju, about
170 miles south of here, and seized the city. At Chun's order,
paratroopers stormed the city and put down the uprising.
Among those taking part in yesterday's demonstration at
Kwangju were relatives of people killed in 1980, along with mem
bers of the National Assembly representing the new opposition
Reunification Democratic Party.
Simon enters presidential race
CARBONDALE, 111. — Sen. Paul Simon, a Lutheran missionary's
son who began his political career as a crusading small-town
newspaper editor, yesterday entered the Democratic presidential
race, portraying himself as a latter-day Harry Truman, unwilling
to bend to the prevailing political winds or even get rid of his bow
tie.
Setting himself apart in style and philosophy from his younger,
handsomer, high-tech-oriented opponents, the 58-year-old Simon
told a cheering crowd of more than 1,500 here. "I stand here as a
Democrat, not a neo-anything, who is not running away from the
Democratic tradition. ... 1 am glad there is a Republican Party,
but one Republican Party is enough."
Simon announced his long-shot candidacy at Shryock
Auditorium, a hall on the campus of Southern Illinois University
where Truman appeared six weeks before he won an upset victory
in the 1948 election.
"To become fashionable, some people tell me to get rid of my bow
tie and my horn-rimmed glasses, and, most of all, to change my
views," Simon said. "Well, Harry Truman wore a bow tie and horn
rimmed glasses, and he didn't knuckle under to pressure to
change his views. 1988 is not going to be the year for a candidate
slickly packaged like some new soft drink."
Simon, largely unknown outside his home state, is the fifth
declared entrant in the wide open and fluid Democratic race.
He follows former Gov. Bruce Babbitt of Arizona. Massachusetts
Gov. Michael Dukakis. Rep. Richard Gephardt. Mo., and former
Colorado Sen. Gary Hart, who recently withdrew. At least three
others. Jesse Jackson and Sens. Joseph R Biden Jr.. Del., and Al
bert Gore Jr., Tenn., are expected to join the field, and several
more are considering it.
'"Hollywood'' becomes 6 Caltech'
HOLLYWOOD — Braving the dead of night, mastering the steep
slopes of Mount Lee, dangling 45 feet in the air. the incurable
pranksters of California Institute of Technology struck again.
Just before dawn Monday, the "HOLLYWOOD" sign was draped
with plastic and left to read simply: "CALTECH."
"It's a 100 th anniversary present for Hollywood." a Caltech
freshman who facetiously identified himself as "John Doe" told
the Los Angeles Times.
As residents on neighboring hills and motorists on nearby
freeways pondered the dubious gift yesterday morning, officials of
the Hollywood Chamber of Commerce, which maintains the 64-
year-old landmark in Griffith Park, said they were not amused.
"We are not kidding and laughing about this at all." Bill Welsh,
chamber president, huffed.
The incident was under investigation by police. Los Angeles
Police Lt. Sergio Robleto said, adding, "except for our Caltech
graduates."
And the city's Department of Recreation and Parks rushed to
remove the new plastic coverings, sending teams in with special
tree-trimming equipment to help scale the 45-foot-high letters.
The students, of course, had Just climbed up. John Doe said.
The prank was the latest in a long line of stunts by students at
the university in nearby Pasadena, which have included stealing a
fighter plane and towing It to a professor's home, switching green
and red lenses on city stoplights and rigging the 1984 Rose Bowl
scoreboard to show Caltech. instead of one of the teams actually
on the field, winning the game.

"To become fashionable, some people tell me to get rid of my bow
tie and my horn-rimmed glasses, and, most of all, to change my
views," Simon said. "Well, Harry Truman wore a bow tie and horn
rimmed glasses, and he didn't knuckle under to pressure to
change his views. 1988 is not going to be the year for a candidate
slickly packaged like some new soft drink."
Simon, largely unknown outside his home state, is the fifth
declared entrant in the wide open and fluid Democratic race.
He follows former Gov. Bruce Babbitt of Arizona. Massachusetts
Gov. Michael Dukakis. Rep. Richard Gephardt. Mo., and former
Colorado Sen. Gary Hart, who recently withdrew. At least three
others. Jesse Jackson and Sens. Joseph R Biden Jr.. Del., and Al
bert Gore Jr., Tenn., are expected to join the field, and several
more are considering it.
'"Hollywood'' becomes 6 Caltech'
HOLLYWOOD — Braving the dead of night, mastering the steep
slopes of Mount Lee, dangling 45 feet in the air. the incurable
pranksters of California Institute of Technology struck again.
Just before dawn Monday, the "HOLLYWOOD" sign was draped
with plastic and left to read simply: "CALTECH."
"It's a 100 th anniversary present for Hollywood." a Caltech
freshman who facetiously identified himself as "John Doe" told
the Los Angeles Times.
As residents on neighboring hills and motorists on nearby
freeways pondered the dubious gift yesterday morning, officials of
the Hollywood Chamber of Commerce, which maintains the 64-
year-old landmark in Griffith Park, said they were not amused.
"We are not kidding and laughing about this at all." Bill Welsh,
chamber president, huffed.
The incident was under investigation by police. Los Angeles
Police Lt. Sergio Robleto said, adding, "except for our Caltech
graduates."
And the city's Department of Recreation and Parks rushed to
remove the new plastic coverings, sending teams in with special
tree-trimming equipment to help scale the 45-foot-high letters.
The students, of course, had Just climbed up. John Doe said.
The prank was the latest in a long line of stunts by students at
the university in nearby Pasadena, which have included stealing a
fighter plane and towing It to a professor's home, switching green
and red lenses on city stoplights and rigging the 1984 Rose Bowl
scoreboard to show Caltech. instead of one of the teams actually
on the field, winning the game.

Court expands civil rights law
WASHINGTON — The Supreme Court, significantly expanding
the scope of a major federal civil rights law. ruled unanimously
yesterday that it protects not only racial minorities but also Jews,
Arabs and other ethnic groups from discrimination.
Justice Byron White, writing for the court, said the 1866 Civil
Rights Act, which allows a broad range of suits for damages by vic
tims of discrimination, was clearly intended to protect people who
are "subjected to intentional discrimination solely because of
their ancestry or ethnic characteristics." Congress did not intend
to confine use of the law when it used the word "race" 121 years
ago, he said, but w.anted to include what are now seen as ethnic
groups.
The opinions came in a pair of cases, one of which involved a
suit by a Silver Spring, Md., synagogue against vandals who
sprayed the building with anti-Semitic slogans. The holding was
hailed as a major victory by Jewish. Arab and Hispanic groups,
which said the court had given them an important new weapon to
fight discrimination in employment and other areas.
Kohl switches position on arms
BONN, West Germany — Chancellor Helmut Kohl, under pres
sure from West German voters and his NATO allies to accept a pro
posed superpower deal on European-based nuclear missiles, said
yesterday that his government would not allow its doubts over a
Soviet offer on short-range missiles to stand in the way of an ac
cord.
Kohl's comments, at a news conference, indicated that West
Germany was moving toward accepting the Soviet offer to remove
from Europe all missiles with ranges of between 300 and 600
miles as long as certain conditions were met. according to govern
ment sources and Western diplomats.
West Germany currently stands alone among NATO members in
resisting the Soviet offer.
The United States and Soviet Union already have agreed on the
broad outlines of a pact to remove from Europe all medium-range
missiles, or those with ranges of between 600 and 3,000 miles.
West Germany strongly supports that part of the deal.
But agreement has been delayed by Bonn's reluctance to
embrace an additional Soviet offer, made last month, to remove all
missiles with ranges of between 300 and 600 miles.
Students, police clash in Korea
SEOUL, South Korea — Students clashed with the police yester
day here and in Kwangju, the provincial capital where seven years
ago to the day almost 200 people were killed demonstrating
against a power grab by President Chun Doo Hwan. Yesterday's
demonstrators at KwangjU burned Chun in effigy.
Coincidentally, the Bank of Korea announced yesterday that
South Korea's economic growth in the first three months of the
year was an impressive 15.6 percent.
The economic announcement, coupled with signs of business
as usual — bustling shoppers, the usual traffic jams — indicated
that political unrest has failed to cause any significant disruption,
even on the anniversary of what has come to be known as the
Kwangju incident.
On May 18. 1980, amid widespread unrest following a military
coup that had given Chun, then arl army general, effective control
of the country, students and dissidents rose up at Kwangju, about
170 miles south of here, and seized the city. At Chun's order,
paratroopers stormed the city and put down the uprising.
Among those taking part in yesterday's demonstration at
Kwangju were relatives of people killed in 1980, along with mem
bers of the National Assembly representing the new opposition
Reunification Democratic Party.
Simon enters presidential race
CARBONDALE, 111. — Sen. Paul Simon, a Lutheran missionary's
son who began his political career as a crusading small-town
newspaper editor, yesterday entered the Democratic presidential
race, portraying himself as a latter-day Harry Truman, unwilling
to bend to the prevailing political winds or even get rid of his bow
tie.
Setting himself apart in style and philosophy from his younger,
handsomer, high-tech-oriented opponents, the 58-year-old Simon
told a cheering crowd of more than 1,500 here. "I stand here as a
Democrat, not a neo-anything, who is not running away from the
Democratic tradition. ... 1 am glad there is a Republican Party,
but one Republican Party is enough."
Simon announced his long-shot candidacy at Shryock
Auditorium, a hall on the campus of Southern Illinois University
where Truman appeared six weeks before he won an upset victory
in the 1948 election.
"To become fashionable, some people tell me to get rid of my bow
tie and my horn-rimmed glasses, and, most of all, to change my
