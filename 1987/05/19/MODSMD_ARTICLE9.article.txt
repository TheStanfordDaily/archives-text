# More deaths in ship attack

### 
WASHINGTON - The death toll
rose to 28 aboard the USS Stark in
the Persian Gulf yesterday as Pres
ident Reagan ordered other U.S.
naval vessels in the area to a
higher state of alert, warning Iraq
and Iran that their planes will be
fired upon if there is a hint of hos
tile intent.
Twenty-four hours after the
U.S. missile frigate was hit by an
Iraqi missile streaking out of the
darkness. firefighters still
struggled to contain sporadic
blazes.
Pentagon officials said that as
many as 15 other members of the
ship's crew were injured in the in
explicable attack launched by an
Iraqi F-l Mirage jet. Some of the
injured had been treated aboard
ship and returned to duty fighting
fires and operating the heavily
damaged Stark as it struggled
toward port, officials added.
The bizarre turn of events in the
oil-rich gulf, where Iran and Iraq
continue to fight in an escalating
seven-year conflict, infuriated
Reagan administration officials,
though the Pentagon character
ized the attack as accidental.
Reagan met with the National
Security Planning Group at the
White House for an hour and 15
minutes yesterday afternoon,
then ordered the higher state of
alert for the other six U.S. war
ships in the gulf.
A White House statement said
Iraq and Iran had been notified
that "aircraft of either country
flying in a pattern which indicates
hostile intent will be fired upon
unless they provide notification of
their intentions."
After demanding an Iraqi expla
nation in diplomatic messages
delivered in Washington and
Baghdad, the White House said
that the United States also expects
"an apology and compensation for
the men who died in this tragic in

cident." plus compensation for
damage to the 3,740-ton. 453-
foot-long frigate.
Last night. Iraq formally ac
cepted responsibility for the
missile attack, blaming an
"unintentional accident."
The episode, the first spillover of
violence from the Iran-Iraq con
flict to affect a U.S. naval vessel,
took another unexpected turn yes
terday afternoon with the dis
closure that the Stark twice tried
to warn the approaching Iraqi
plane away.
Officials said that the Stark had
become aware that the warplane's
targeting radar had locked on to
the ship before the jet fired an Ex
ocet missile. Launched from a
range of 11 or 12 miles, the

missile struck the ship within one
minute, ripping a 10- to 15-foot
hole in its hull just above the
waterline.
But officials said that they could
not explain why the ship did not
use its Phalanx anti-missile sys
tem designed to intercept cruise
missiles like the Exocet as they
streak low over the water at nearly
600 mph.
Reagan, describing himself as
concerned and angry, promised a
report to the nation on the attack
as soon as its circumstances are
clear. "We have protested this at
tack in the strongest terms and
are investigating the circum
stances of the incident," he said.
At the State Department,

spokesman Charles Redman
reiterated that "we view this un
provoked attack with the utmost
seriousness, and we've demanded
a full accounting and explanation
of the attack. We expect an im
mediate response."
White House spokesman Marlin
Fitzwater said Iraqi Ambassador
Nizar Hamdoon had "expressed
profound regret" over the tragedy
and had called for a "complete in
vestigation."
In a message to Reagan more
than a day after the raid, Iraqi
President Saddam Hussein said
that the warplanes "had not at all
intended to strike at a target
belonging to your country or any
other country except Iran."
