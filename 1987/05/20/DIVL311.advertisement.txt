"The Golden Gate is at once a bittersweet love story, a wickedly funny American novel of
manners and an unsentimental meditation on mortality and the nuclear abyss. Always
witty—and still, in its reticent way, profound—the book paints a truthful picture of our
dreadful comic times." —David Rieff, Vanity Fair
"Like the bridge for which it is named, Vikram Seth's The Golden Gate is a thing of
anomalous beauty: a long narrative poem set in present-day San Francisco...Seth writes
poetry as it has not been written for nearly a century, that's to say, with the intention that his
work should give pleasure to that ideal Common Reader for whom good novelists have
always aspired to write." —Thomas M. Disch, Washington Post Book World
