Reagan names villain in attack
WASHINGTON — President Reagan yesterday portrayed Iran,
not Iraq, as the chief villain in the guided-missile attack by an
Iraqi jet that killed 37 Americans aboard a U.S. Navy ship as it
patrolled the Persian Gulf Sunday night.
Although the Iraqi government acknowledged that one of its F-l
Mirage jets mistakenly launched the lethal attack in the darkness,
the president s remarks seemed calculated to edge the United
States away from its position of careful neutrality in the Iran-Iraq
war by blasting Iran for the tragedy.
"The villain in the piece is really Iran," Reagan said in an inter
view with Tennessee reporters during a visit to Chattanooga.
"They're delighted with what has just happened."
Reagan, recalling Iran's threat to close the gulf to ships carrying
Iraqi oil and oil of nations supporting Iraq, stressed that the
waterway is considered international and that "no country there
has a right to try and close it off and take it for itself."
Moreover, he pointed out that Iraq has offered its approval of an
international effort to bring peace to the region, "and it has been
Iran that refused to go — to find a way of ending the war."
Missile caught crew by surprise
MANAMA, Bahrain — The commander of U.S. naval forces in
the Persian Gulf said yesterday that he believed that the crew of an
American frigate was probably unaware that an Iraqi aircraft had
fired a missile at the ship until it was too late for the vessel to
defend itself.
Rear Adm. Harold Bernsen, commander of the U.S. Middle East
Force, also said the frigate Stark was struck by two air-to-surface
missiles, contradicting earlier reports of a single missile.
Meanwhile, a U.S. Air Force C-141 was en route here from
Ramstein Air Base in West Germany to fly out the bodies of the
Stark's dead, now reported to number 37. The bodies, on board
Bernsen's command ship LaSalle, are to be brought ashore tomor
row by helicopter.
The 37 crewmen killed were all enlisted men. Twenty-four
bodies have been identified, and two men are still unaccounted
for. A Bahraini coast guard officer said the search for the missing
men was called off early yesterday.
After speaking with the commanding officer of the Stark,
Bernsen said that what happened during the attack was still not
altogether clear. He was asked repeatedly about why the Stark had
not opened on the attacking plane.
"I believe," he said, "that the crew of the Stark did not believe
that they were taken under fire from a hostile aircraft, that they
were in danger."
Hostages freed in Fiji
SUVA, Fiji — Fiji's military government early this morning freed
most of the members of Parliament taken prisoner during last
Thursday's coup, as the first step in what the governor general of
this racially torn island nation called "the process of a return to
normalcy after seven days of army rule."
Lt. Col. Sitiveni Rabuka, the coup leader, said on government
run radio that he was surprised that his ill-fated military takeover
did not attract more support from Western nations since he said
he had staged his coup to save Fiji from becoming a Libyan
toehold in the South Pacific. Fiji is about 2,000 miles east of
Australia.
The seven-day coup that began with the ouster of the country's
first Indian-dominated government seems to have severely
damaged race relations in this country, where Indian immigrants
and native Fijians share a precarious coexistence. A few Fijians
who supported the coup vented their anger yesterday by stoning
Indian taxicab drivers and assaulting foreign journalists whom
they blamed for the coup's apparent failure. Indians, meanwhile,
were left wondering whether they have a future here.
The island's governor general, in an apparent effort to defuse
the crisis, announced that he would dissolve Parliament and
Bavadra's legally elected government and schedule new elections.
The election of Bavadra and his coalition government April 12
sent shocks throught the South Pacific, as he promised to shift
Fiji's staunch pro-Western foreign policy to a more non-aligned,
anti-nuclear and anti-colonialist stand. But after assuming office,
Bavadra appeared to moderate his party's positions somewhat,
saying, for example, that U.S. ships with nuclear weapons might
be allowed into Fiji's ports under certain circumstances.
Owen risked all to stop communism
WASHINGTON — For Robert Owen, an earnest true believer in
Oliver North's multiple secret operations, it all came down to the
cause. He was willing to risk everything, including his life, he told
Iran-contra investigators, if lt contributed to stopping commun
ism in Central America.
His account of furtive, admittedly "questionable" behavior, of
"walking a very fine line" between legality and illegality, con
trasted sharply with President Reagan's most recent assertion
that there was nothing untoward about those like Owen who as
sisted the Nicaraguan contras.
Reagan insisted last Friday that "there is nothing in the law
that prevents citizens — individuals or groups — from offering aid
of whatever kind they wanted to give."
But the story Owen told yesterday in the Senate Caucus Room
showed that he and Marine Lt. Col. North — whom he called
"Blood and Guts" and described as his covert "Godfather" —
realized they were engaged in potentially illegal acts.
Owen maintained, however, that he did not think that would
happen because he believed his activities and those of his super
ior. North, had the highest official backing.
He also testified, as did a former Reagan national security advi
ser. Robert McFarlane. that North told him his actions to provide
arms and money secretly to the contras after Congress banned
such aid were authorized.
Botlia to meet with black leaders
CAPE TOWN. South Africa — President Pieter Botha, hoping to
accelerate the pace of political reform In South Africa, said yester
day that he would participate personally in new negotiations with
black leaders to develop a "power-sharing"' constitution.
Botha told the opening session of Parliament that he believed
that is the only way to resolve the country's problems peacefully,
and that he was "giving serious consideration to ways and means
that will enable the state president to be more directly involved in
negotiations with black leaders."
Although Botha gave no details of what he is planning, his deci
sion to exercise his personal leadership on the reform issue,
taking over direct responsibility from ministers in his Cabinet,
suggested a new urgency in the government's search for a political
system that will reconcile the blacks' demand for majority rule
with white fears of domination.
But Botha, responding to the rightward swing in the whites
only parliamentary elections two weeks ago, also declared that se
curity was still his government's highest priority. He warned that
tougher curbs would be imposed on opposition groups promoting
change outside parliamentary or constitutional channels.
Botha said that the victory of his National Party in the May 6
parliamentary election "confirms the government's point of
departure that security, order and stability in all our communities
are preconditions for reform, and that the proponents of
radicalism and violence will have to renounce that course before
they may participate In constitutional process."
