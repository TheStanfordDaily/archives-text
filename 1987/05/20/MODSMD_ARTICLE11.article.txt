# Patzman: There's no place like home
## 
### 
The tall, lanky, red-haired es
tablishment liberal from the
wheat fields of Kansas has
arrived.
The meteoric rise of young
Andrew Patzman reminded ob
servers of other eminent Kan
sans. Jim Ryan. Alf Landon. Buf
falo Bill. A.J. Thomas. Len Daw
son. Nancy Kassenbaum.
Dorothy, Bruce Brown. Toto.
Robert Dole. . , ,
"Hey . . . uh, wait a second, do
you think you could omit Bob
Dole from that litany." protested
the newly crowned editor, whose
liberalism was as flaming as his
red hair.
Gangly and cerebral, the can
didate reminded observers of a
cross between Opie and George
Will gone left.
The new chief speaks plainly,
like a Kansan should, though
with alliterative, parenthetical
fits of verbosity. The pensive
prairie populist with the "Aw
shucks" mien has taken the
helm from the thickly accented
Bostonian. And he is ready. No
more stodgy Eastern pretension.
This is the heartland of America;
God's country, as they say —
hearty, simple, honest, and ah

hhh, well. . . uh. a little slow.
The clock tower struck 10. and
the new man poured down a few
swigs of bubbly in a manner that
would make fellow Kansan
Carrie Nation blush as red as
Patzman's fiery locks. Then the
splendid splinter spoke:

"Ahhhhh, thanks, I mean, my
gratitude is inexpressible, al
though I'll try to . . . uh. express
It anyway. I mean to say, I'm . . .
uh, well, grateful. Downright
thankful, that is. Oh gee."
His red hair stood on end, rem
iniscent of the waving wheat of

Shawneee Mission. his
homeland. But even as cham
pagne fell festively on his flaming
follicles, the junior history major
shrugged off his victory. His
thoughts turned immediately to
the historical context of the tri
umph. "Well . . . uh, I'd probably
put it somewhere on the level of
Truman's defeat of Dewey in
1948," quoth he. "Uh . . . but
probably not quite up with . . .
oh. 1 don't know, say. Pope Inno
cent IV's usurpation of Boniface
VIII in 1437."
Patzman's election is a vin
dication of the solid Midwestern
mores he espoused throughout
his campaign — virtue, strength
and the rugged pioneer ethos of
the Midwest; the kind of values
that permeated his stream-of
consciousness grill session
rambles.
And the kind of diligence and
conscientiousness that drew
him away from the Daily office
even as the celebration had just
begun.
"Uh ... I'd love to stay," he
said, "but . . . I've got a bit of
work to do on the King papers,
so . . . uh, if you'll excuse me, I'll
be perambulating . . . on.
