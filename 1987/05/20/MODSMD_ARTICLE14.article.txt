Last week the Board of Trustees' Special
Committee on Investment Responsibility
(SCIR) gave preliminary approval to three
proposals made by the Committee on Invest
ment Responsibility (CIR). The proposals
were designed to give Stanford a more ag
gressive and efficient system for reviewing
the performances of companies doing busi
ness in South Africa.
The CIR proposals, which were submitted
to the SCIR last month, called on Stanford to
automatically divest of its stock in compan
ies with unacceptable ratings according to
the Sullivan Principles, a set of guidelines de
signed to regulate the conduct of companies
doing business in South Africa.
The CIR also proposed that Stanford auto
matically divest its stock in companies that
have not signed the Sullivan Principles. A
third proposal said Stanford should not buy
new stock in any companies that have
recently opened operations in South Africa
until they are given Sullivan ratings.
In approving these proposals, the SCIR
added a qualification. The trustees said,
"Any company is entitled to due process, and
nothing should be automatic." Companies in

question should be given a brief interval to
demonstrate that their situations are so ex
traordinary that they should be exempted
from the new policy, according to the trus
tees.
By qualifying the "changes" in this man
ner, the SCIR has assured that there will be
no change at all. Allowing individual com
panies "a short period of time" to explain
themselves means that decisions will be
made on a case-by-case basis and will be very
slow in coming.
If this sounds at all familiar, it is: This is
the policy the trustees have followed all
along. It seems as though the SCIR is merely
doing lip service to the CIR proposals and to
the entire divestment issue. After two years
of dragging their feet in evaluating the per
formance of companies doing business in
South Africa, the trustees have made it clear
they will continue to do the very same thing.
The Stanford community has stated again
and again that it wants divestment now. It is
high time the trustees pay some attention.
Deletion of their modification to the ClR's
proposals would be a good first step.
