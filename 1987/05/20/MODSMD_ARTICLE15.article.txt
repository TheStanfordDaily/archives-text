Alcohol abuse
starts early
Attitudes toward alcohol need
to be fostered prior to college, not
during, as senior Jill Gilbert
proposed in a recent viewpoint on
alcohol and education (Daily, May
13). She proposed that the Uni
versity take on the burden of
educating the student population
about the history of alcohol.
Thus, students might better
understand alcohol's role in soci
ety and "make more informed
decisions."
There is no doubt that educa
tion on the subject of alcohol is
needed, but I feel that the initial
responsibility should lie with the
family. Gilbert says. "Alcohol
education, however minimal,
should take place at the univer
sity level simply because the
drinking age is 21." Why wait so
long? Sadly. I knew several people
who were on the way to becoming
alcoholics as sophomores in high
school. Who will teach them? By
the time they leave the relative
shelter and support of their
homes, it's almost too late for
their parents to help.
Where families fall short, com
munities and high schools should
take up the slack. If alcohol edu
cation were to begin at home,
young people would be more
aware of alcohol's potential for
both simple pleasure and possible
trouble. It is better to identify a
potential alcoholic at age 17 than
at 26. The issue is similar to sex

education — many parents are
hesitant to discuss the subject
with their kids, who then decide
to find out for themselves what
it's all about, usually to
everybody's chagrin.
Why not make the drinking age
16 and the driving age 18? That
way, young people might get
bored of alcohol before they put
themselves and others at risk as
drunk drivers. The lack of alcohol
guidance at home becomes more
than obvious at college parties.
Students who are suddenly free of
parental as well as most societal
restraints often abuse the forbid
den fruit of alcohol. Incidents at
Stanford this spring as well as in
the past attest to this.
I was never educated about
alcohol at home. I guess my par
ents never felt I needed to be
"talked to" about alcohol. My
naive self was rudely shocked at
fraternity "roll-outs" where we
pledges chugged beer until we
puked and called it macho. Cer
tainly. there is a better way.
Hopefully, families and commun
ities will recognize their poten
tials for positive influence in
alcohol awareness. Alcohol can be
enjoyed without being abused.

Shultz lied
at Centennial
One remarkable aspect of
Thursday's Centennial celebra
tion was the fact that Secretary of
State George Shultz could stand

in front of Memorial Church and
tell a bald-faced lie, with hardly a
murmur of protest from his 7,000
listeners. Shultz declared, "We
shall not meddle in the internal
affairs of others."
As he spoke, U.S. government
officials in Washington, D.C.,
were revealing the methods by
which they financed and supplied
rebels who are attempting to
overthrow the government of
Nicaragua. As he spoke, 7,000
U.S. troops were conducting
mock invasion exercises within
100 miles of Nicaragua's border.
Only a few days before Shultz
blandly assured us of U.S. respect
for other countries' sovereignty,
the press reported Washington
had threatened severe economic
sanctions against three Central
American countries if they did
not soften their opposition to
U.S. intervention in Nicaragua.
Shultz isn't the first public
official to show contempt for the
truth, but when University dig
nitaries turn out in full regalia to
honor such a man, we have rea
son to worry about the future of
this country.

Stanford
'Star Wars' is a
political issue
Informed people differ on the
merits of the so-called Strategic
Defense Initiative (SDI), and pro
fessors of computer science surely
have the right to actively pursue

solutions to the many interesting
"engineering problems" related to
strategic "defense." However, in a
recent letter (Dally, May 18),
Computer Science Prof. John
McCarthy seems to demand that
his Stanford colleagues, through
their tax dollars, support him
financially as he attempts to solve
these puzzles.
The academic freedom we enjoy
allows us to allocate our Intellec
tual resources in any way we
choose. We as researchers have
both the right and the responsi
bility to make such choices and to
make judgments as to their moral
implications: To demand aca
demic freedom is to demand
nothing less.
Allocation of tax dollars,
however, is a political issue, and
we as citizens and taxpayers have
the right, the responsibility and
the obligation to question the
propriety of such allocation of
public resources and to make a
political issue of the public fund
ing of such research.
To argue that in raising politi
cal questions concerning the
propriety of SDI research funding
one somehow infringes upon the
academic freedom of the re
searcher is grossly to misun
derstand the obligations of
citizens in a democracy.
McCarthy's right to study what he
chooses does not oblige me to
refrain from seeking, through
political action, an end to the
public funding of SDI-related
research.

Alcohol abuse
starts early
Attitudes toward alcohol need
to be fostered prior to college, not
during, as senior Jill Gilbert
proposed in a recent viewpoint on
alcohol and education (Daily, May
13). She proposed that the Uni
versity take on the burden of
educating the student population
about the history of alcohol.
Thus, students might better
understand alcohol's role in soci
ety and "make more informed
decisions."
There is no doubt that educa
tion on the subject of alcohol is
needed, but I feel that the initial
responsibility should lie with the
family. Gilbert says. "Alcohol
education, however minimal,
should take place at the univer
sity level simply because the
drinking age is 21." Why wait so
long? Sadly. I knew several people
who were on the way to becoming
alcoholics as sophomores in high
school. Who will teach them? By
the time they leave the relative
shelter and support of their
homes, it's almost too late for
their parents to help.
Where families fall short, com
munities and high schools should
take up the slack. If alcohol edu
cation were to begin at home,
young people would be more
aware of alcohol's potential for
both simple pleasure and possible
trouble. It is better to identify a
potential alcoholic at age 17 than
at 26. The issue is similar to sex

education — many parents are
hesitant to discuss the subject
with their kids, who then decide
to find out for themselves what
it's all about, usually to
everybody's chagrin.
Why not make the drinking age
16 and the driving age 18? That
way, young people might get
bored of alcohol before they put
themselves and others at risk as
drunk drivers. The lack of alcohol
guidance at home becomes more
than obvious at college parties.
Students who are suddenly free of
parental as well as most societal
restraints often abuse the forbid
den fruit of alcohol. Incidents at
Stanford this spring as well as in
the past attest to this.
I was never educated about
alcohol at home. I guess my par
ents never felt I needed to be
"talked to" about alcohol. My
naive self was rudely shocked at
fraternity "roll-outs" where we
pledges chugged beer until we
puked and called it macho. Cer
tainly. there is a better way.
Hopefully, families and commun
ities will recognize their poten
tials for positive influence in
alcohol awareness. Alcohol can be
enjoyed without being abused.

Shultz lied
at Centennial
One remarkable aspect of
Thursday's Centennial celebra
tion was the fact that Secretary of
State George Shultz could stand

in front of Memorial Church and
tell a bald-faced lie, with hardly a
murmur of protest from his 7,000
listeners. Shultz declared, "We
shall not meddle in the internal
affairs of others."
As he spoke, U.S. government
officials in Washington, D.C.,
were revealing the methods by
which they financed and supplied
rebels who are attempting to
overthrow the government of
Nicaragua. As he spoke, 7,000
U.S. troops were conducting
mock invasion exercises within
100 miles of Nicaragua's border.
Only a few days before Shultz
blandly assured us of U.S. respect
for other countries' sovereignty,
the press reported Washington
had threatened severe economic
sanctions against three Central
American countries if they did
not soften their opposition to
U.S. intervention in Nicaragua.
Shultz isn't the first public
official to show contempt for the
truth, but when University dig
nitaries turn out in full regalia to
honor such a man, we have rea
son to worry about the future of
this country.

'Star Wars' is a
political issue
Informed people differ on the
merits of the so-called Strategic
Defense Initiative (SDI), and pro
fessors of computer science surely
have the right to actively pursue

solutions to the many interesting
"engineering problems" related to
strategic "defense." However, in a
recent letter (Dally, May 18),
Computer Science Prof. John
McCarthy seems to demand that
his Stanford colleagues, through
their tax dollars, support him
financially as he attempts to solve
these puzzles.
The academic freedom we enjoy
allows us to allocate our Intellec
tual resources in any way we
choose. We as researchers have
both the right and the responsi
bility to make such choices and to
make judgments as to their moral
implications: To demand aca
demic freedom is to demand
nothing less.
Allocation of tax dollars,
however, is a political issue, and
we as citizens and taxpayers have
the right, the responsibility and
the obligation to question the
propriety of such allocation of
public resources and to make a
political issue of the public fund
ing of such research.
To argue that in raising politi
cal questions concerning the
propriety of SDI research funding
one somehow infringes upon the
academic freedom of the re
searcher is grossly to misun
derstand the obligations of
citizens in a democracy.
McCarthy's right to study what he
chooses does not oblige me to
refrain from seeking, through
political action, an end to the
public funding of SDI-related
research.
