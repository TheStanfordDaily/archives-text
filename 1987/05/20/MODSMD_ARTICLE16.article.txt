# A 						reply to minority demands
## 
### 
I feel compelled to respond to the demands of
the Rainbow Agenda, even though the
Thursday-morning deadline for my column
has prevented me from reacting to the planned
demonstration or any significant events that
have occurred since. The demands are well
known by now. so 1 will be as brief as possible
in outlining them and get right to my replies.
The immediate demands:
□ Establishment of an outside commission on
minority life whose recommendations are bin
ding:

Anyone who has picked up a Daily In the
past month or so can attest to the rising con
cern over the quality of minority life at Stan
ford. Incoming Black Student Union Chair Bill
King said. "We're not happy at the University,
and we don't feel like we're involved" (Daily,
May 13). BSU Chair Amanda Kemp went so far
as to say that people at the University were
giving her the message. "Nigger, go home!"
(Daily. April 28). Clearly, there is a problem.
An outside commission, in itself, is an excel
lent recommendation. I'm not sure how a com
mittee would go about "studying racism," but I
think It is an appropriate response to what is
obviously a growing concern. The stipulation
that the committee's recommendations be bin
ding. however, is just short of ludicrous. Not
even the Tower commission's findings are
"binding." To tie the University's hands before
we even read the assessment Is close-minded
and premature. At least let the people involved
read it before they respond.
□ Establishment of an ethnic studies depart
ment:
A recent letter by Michael Fedrick (Daily. May
13) reminds us of the important distinction

between race and culture. "To establish a de
partment that studies groups distinguished
solely by ethnicity is tantamount to saying that
it is race that makes American minorities dif
ferent from one another," the letter says. "This
is, in short, racism."
□ Establishment of a position for a vice
provost for minority affairs:
This one could go either way. I'm not exactly
clear what the coalition expects this person to
do, but then again, a vice provost may assuage
some people's fears that minority problems are
not being vigorously dealt with at the highest
levels. That Is, judging from the administrative
responses that I've seen thus far. an un
founded fear — but a fear nevertheless. I defer
this one to "the appropriate channels."
□ Changed admission policies:
I'm all for "increased recruitment of low-
Income students." But I have a problem with
requiring the percentage of each minority
group admitted to reflect "at least the state or
national average of each respective commu
nity." Why? After hashing over this Issue with
numerous students. I still do not follow the
logical jump behind this demand.
i don't believe that if America is X percent
Asian, for example, that Stanford must also be
X percent Asian. Maybe one particular year the
Asian applicant pool turns out to be nothing
less than stellar and is steeped In talent and
potential. You run the risk of denying some
very sharp kids admission simply because you
have other percentages to fill. The admission
process is far too complex to limit it from the
onset to certain requirements.
□ Establishment of a multicultural center:
The key phrase here is "built and funded by
the University." I believe this request should
follow the same procedure as any other request
for University help. If a majority of students
wants to foot the bill, so be It. I hasten to add
that failure to do so should not be branded
"racist." As a recent editorial pointed out. we
don't even have an ice cream stand (Daily. May
8).

The long-range goals:
□ Increase in minority faculty:
If you want Stanford to hire more minority
faculty in the same way that you want IBM to
hire more minority employees, that's not so of
fensive. I can be persuaded that we need to get
minorities more involved in professions such
as teaching or engineering, due to various
well-known reasons (role-model problems, for
example).
But if the underlying assumption is that we
need minorities to teach certain subjects that
are currently not being taught satisfactorily,
that is nonsense. It is not absolutely im
perative that an African teach African history,
for example.
□ Increases in financial aid:
This by itself is terribly vague, but if the
Rainbow Coalition is implying that a student
should receive a better financial aid package
simply on the basis of skin color, they are fos
tering the kind of discrimination that they so
vehemently oppose.
I'd like to conclude by saying that the behav
ior of the Rainbow Agenda leaves something to
be desired. Yes. their demands are serious and
deserve a serious response. But for the coali
tion to pounce on Rosse and Kennedy with
terms such as "disrespectful" is, well, dis
respectful.
Kennedy and Rosse. considering the intense
pressure of the Cornerstone Weekend fes
tivities, should be commended for their wil
lingness to work with the minority groups and
form thoughtful, intelligent responses. In ad
dition, calling the recently formed committee
(appointed by Kennedy and Rosse to study the
demands) a "lollipop given to us to pacify us
during the Centennial" is embarrassing. The
fervor of the Administration is all too evident,
and I have complete confidence that the
"appropriate channels" will deal with the
demands carefully and convincingly.
Scott Lyon Is an undeclared freshman. This
Is his final column.

I feel compelled to respond to the demands of
the Rainbow Agenda, even though the
Thursday-morning deadline for my column
has prevented me from reacting to the planned
demonstration or any significant events that
have occurred since. The demands are well
known by now. so 1 will be as brief as possible
in outlining them and get right to my replies.
The immediate demands:
□ Establishment of an outside commission on
minority life whose recommendations are bin
ding:

Anyone who has picked up a Daily In the
past month or so can attest to the rising con
cern over the quality of minority life at Stan
ford. Incoming Black Student Union Chair Bill
King said. "We're not happy at the University,
and we don't feel like we're involved" (Daily,
May 13). BSU Chair Amanda Kemp went so far
as to say that people at the University were
giving her the message. "Nigger, go home!"
(Daily. April 28). Clearly, there is a problem.
An outside commission, in itself, is an excel
lent recommendation. I'm not sure how a com
mittee would go about "studying racism," but I
think It is an appropriate response to what is
obviously a growing concern. The stipulation
that the committee's recommendations be bin
ding. however, is just short of ludicrous. Not
even the Tower commission's findings are
"binding." To tie the University's hands before
we even read the assessment Is close-minded
and premature. At least let the people involved
read it before they respond.
□ Establishment of an ethnic studies depart
ment:
A recent letter by Michael Fedrick (Daily. May
13) reminds us of the important distinction

between race and culture. "To establish a de
partment that studies groups distinguished
solely by ethnicity is tantamount to saying that
it is race that makes American minorities dif
ferent from one another," the letter says. "This
is, in short, racism."
□ Establishment of a position for a vice
provost for minority affairs:
This one could go either way. I'm not exactly
clear what the coalition expects this person to
do, but then again, a vice provost may assuage
some people's fears that minority problems are
not being vigorously dealt with at the highest
levels. That Is, judging from the administrative
responses that I've seen thus far. an un
founded fear — but a fear nevertheless. I defer
this one to "the appropriate channels."
□ Changed admission policies:
I'm all for "increased recruitment of low-
Income students." But I have a problem with
requiring the percentage of each minority
group admitted to reflect "at least the state or
national average of each respective commu
nity." Why? After hashing over this Issue with
numerous students. I still do not follow the
logical jump behind this demand.
i don't believe that if America is X percent
Asian, for example, that Stanford must also be
X percent Asian. Maybe one particular year the
Asian applicant pool turns out to be nothing
less than stellar and is steeped In talent and
potential. You run the risk of denying some
very sharp kids admission simply because you
have other percentages to fill. The admission
process is far too complex to limit it from the
onset to certain requirements.
□ Establishment of a multicultural center:
The key phrase here is "built and funded by
the University." I believe this request should
follow the same procedure as any other request
for University help. If a majority of students
wants to foot the bill, so be It. I hasten to add
that failure to do so should not be branded
"racist." As a recent editorial pointed out. we
don't even have an ice cream stand (Daily. May
8).

The long-range goals:
□ Increase in minority faculty:
If you want Stanford to hire more minority
faculty in the same way that you want IBM to
hire more minority employees, that's not so of
fensive. I can be persuaded that we need to get
minorities more involved in professions such
as teaching or engineering, due to various
well-known reasons (role-model problems, for
example).
But if the underlying assumption is that we
need minorities to teach certain subjects that
are currently not being taught satisfactorily,
that is nonsense. It is not absolutely im
perative that an African teach African history,
for example.
□ Increases in financial aid:
This by itself is terribly vague, but if the
Rainbow Coalition is implying that a student
should receive a better financial aid package
simply on the basis of skin color, they are fos
tering the kind of discrimination that they so
vehemently oppose.
I'd like to conclude by saying that the behav
ior of the Rainbow Agenda leaves something to
be desired. Yes. their demands are serious and
deserve a serious response. But for the coali
tion to pounce on Rosse and Kennedy with
terms such as "disrespectful" is, well, dis
respectful.
Kennedy and Rosse. considering the intense
pressure of the Cornerstone Weekend fes
tivities, should be commended for their wil
lingness to work with the minority groups and
form thoughtful, intelligent responses. In ad
dition, calling the recently formed committee
(appointed by Kennedy and Rosse to study the
demands) a "lollipop given to us to pacify us
during the Centennial" is embarrassing. The
fervor of the Administration is all too evident,
and I have complete confidence that the
"appropriate channels" will deal with the
demands carefully and convincingly.
