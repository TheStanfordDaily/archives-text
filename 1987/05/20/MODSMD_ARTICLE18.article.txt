# Pressure, not force

I am sorry that Computer Sci
ence Prof. John McCarthy feels in
timidated by the social con
sciences of people who question
"Star Wars" (Daily, May 16). I
agree that we do not have the right
to intimidate. However, I think we
do have the right to facilitate in
formed debate and to persuade.

McCarthy received a leaflet
prepared by Stanford Action for
Nuclear Disarmament (STAND)
that has been frequently distribu
ted to students and now is being
sent to faculty in some depart
ments. The leaflet details the
threat the Strategic Defense Ini
tiative (SDI) or "Star Wars" poses
to arms control and to strategic
stability. It also discusses dangers
to academic freedom in the way
"Star Wars" is being implemented.
We in STAND feel it is our respon
sibility to raise these issues so
that space weapons will not add to
the problems humanity already
has.
Contrary to McCarthy's asser
tions, STAND is not composed of
"thugs" and does not advocate
"ferocious . . . mob rule." STAND
does, however, make use of the
right of free speech. STAND
lobbies, circulates information
about SDI contracts at Stanford
and tries to persuade others of the
dangers of SDI.
The phrase from our pamphlet
that offends McCarthy — our wish
to "create a political climate
making it difficult to accept fur
ther SDI money" — is open to
misinterpretation. I hope to ex
plain it here. Obviously, STAND
does not envisage violent threats.
We want public and peer aware
ness and discussion. These are
indeed a form of pressure. I am
sorry if McCarthy feels in

timidated by these, but such is life
in a democracy.
In the current political climate,
acceptance of SDI funds is seen as
legitimate, as helping to "defend
the country," or at worst as help
ing the researcher personally at a
time when other funds are less
available. But not even
proponents claim SDI is intended
to defend the U.S. population.
STAND feels it would merely add
to offensive capabilities, and we
have the right to change the
climate by persuading others.
Also, many scientists in the
ivory tower seem to feel that ac
cepting SDI funding has no moral
implications, or they rationalize
away their qualms about it. They
can bide behind notions of "value
free" science or the idea that their
own work isn't really doing any
harm. But accepting SDI funding
is not a neutral act. Research ad
vances are incorporated into what
we believe would be an offensive
weapon system. Further, scien
tists' acceptance of funds is used
as evidence of their political sup
port for the SDI program. Accord
ing to James lonson, head of the
Innovative Science and Technol
ogy office within SDI: "This office
has something to sell to Congress.
If we can say that this fellow at
MIT will get money to do such and
such research, it's something real
to sell." SDI research, with or
without civilian applications, has
definite pro-SDI political ramifica
tions.
In thtf political climate STAND
seeks, scientists would have to
face explicitly the moral and politi
cal choices of SDI research. The
heightened awareness of the re
searchers, their peers and the
public would make it more diffi
cult to brush these issues aside.
