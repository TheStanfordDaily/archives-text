# Controversy mars spring trip
## 
### JOSEPH GREEN 
Some students who participated in a
spring break trip to El Salvador have
charged that they were only exposed to
leftist views on the crisis in that country
and that trip organizers misled the
public about the goal of the trip.
These participants say that organizers
advertised the trip as an effort to heipr
rebuild the University of San Salvador,
which was devastated last year by an
earthquake. But, they say, the trip actu
ally turned out to be a politically one
sided introduction to the left-wing or
ganizations there.
In addition to 14 students, the trip
consisted of the Rev. Herb Schmidt, a
Stanford Lutheran pastor, and Law
School Assoc. Dean Thomas Mcßride.
The trip was sponsored by the Public
Service Center, the Ecumenical Mini
stries at Stanford, Memorial Church
and the Stanford Workshops on Political
and Social Issues program.
Catherine Milton, director of the
Public Service Center, said the trip was
advertised as a service program to
rebuild the university, but, according to
Mcßride, this advertising turned out to
be misleading.
A letter drafted by Mcßride states:
"While the group did assist in the

rebuilding of the university by delivering
funds which we had raised for that pur
pose, the notion, as the course descrip
tion put it, that we would 'work side-by
side with Salvadoran students' in the
reconstruction effort, turned out to be
little more than a brief, symbolic in
terlude."
Group spokesman Patrick Jean-
Tterre, a junior, agreed with Mcßride.
"We were misled to a certain extent in
terms of the rebuilding of the univer
sity," he said.
But Stanford graduate Emily
Goldfarb, the group's leader, and acting
Dean of the Chapel Thomas Aimbrogi,
one of the trip's organizers, disputed the
charge that students were misled.
Goldfarb said she knew there was not
a "great need" for reconstruction assis
tance, but asserted that this had been
made clear during group orientation.
Ambrogi said, "Anyone who thought
the purpose of the trip was to just to as
sist in the rebuilding of the university
didn't understand the symbolic nature
of the trip."
According to trip participants, the
University of El Salvador had hired
workers to reconstruct the university
and did not need Stanford assistance.
"The university (of El Salvador) stu
dents appeared surprised that we had

arrived with the intentions of doing
earthquake relief," said junior Mark
Gilchrist, a participant in the trip.
Stanford students helped in
reconstruction only once during the 10-
day trip, when the students filled in for
construction workers who were on a
break.
The earthquake relict was "kind of a
joke," said junior Steven Bryan, who
called the publicly stated intention of
earthquake relief nothing more than a
"nice little peg" to build the trip around.
Schmidt said he was glad the group
did not spend much time working on
the reconstruction project.
Some students said they were exposed
to a one-sided view of El Salvador's poli
tical situation and that organizers
should have made more of an effort to
make the trip less dominated by the poli
tical left.
The Stanford group was hosted by a
Salvadoran student organization known
as AGEUS. The Salvadoran government
accuses AGEUS of being a front for the
communist-leaning Farabundo Marti
Front for National Liberation (FMLN),
which is seeking to topple the U.S.-
supported government of El Salvador.
