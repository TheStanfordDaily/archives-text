## Behind the scenes Diana Conklin Assistant dean of Residential Education Director of the Row 
### 
When you graduated from college
what did you see yourself doing
in 10 years?
I received my bachelor's degree
In 1967, and tha\ was the summer
of love. Everyone was migrating to
California. So 1 had no concept of
what I was going to do. But then
there was no pressure like there is
today. 1 thought eventually I might
teach.
Were you in any organizations in
college?
To be honest, my extracurric
ular activities were mostly related
to the anti-war movement. When
death is that close, you really are
in a different frame of mind.
What is the toughest part of your
Job?
Emotionally it is working with a
student who has been badly
injured or the family of a student
who has been badly injured. Being
in charge of 38 houses and about
1,600 students, I have been called
out of bed for emergencies more
than once.
If there were a Row house you
had to chose to Hue in, which
would it be?
As a student. I would choose one
of the co-ops because the involve

ment of students in their manage
ment is great. I lived In a co-op in
college — we called them com
munes. To live in a house at my
age though, 1 would say Storey be
cause it is so pretty.
What is a great joy in your life?
This may sound sappy, but I
really enjoy working with the stu
dents. I love their wit, good humor
and overall energy.
What are your best and worst
qualities?
I like to laugh a lot. 1 do a lot of
laughing, but I guess I'm also im
patient.
What has working with Stanford
students taught you?
They have shown me how inher
ently good the vast majority of
people are.
Do you Jeel you are Jairly pre
sented and interpreted by The
Daily and the students in gen
eral?
It's tough to get more than one
dimension on someone in press
coverage. Only one aspect of what
I do appears. I'm not thrilled about
that, but that's life.
What kind of music do you like?
I like Bill Monroe (bluegrass),
Cajun music and s.k.a. I like Run

D.M.C. and their "You Be Ulin."
Are you for divestment in South
Africa?
Yes. When South African blacks
are saying divest, I have to believe
they know what they need.
How would you describe a typi
cal Stanford student?
Charming, captivating, fasci
nating.
If you could go back in your life,
what would you change?
I would persevere and get my
Ph.D. in linguistics because it
would open more options for me. I
would like to write and do re
search.
What is a career completely
outside of your present one you
would like to do?
I'd love to be a singer in a rock
band!
What do you do in your leisure
time?
I read. My favorite author is
Anne Tyler. Oh. and I watch Perry
Mason reruns.
In your opinion, what is Stan
ford's greatest asset?
The students!
