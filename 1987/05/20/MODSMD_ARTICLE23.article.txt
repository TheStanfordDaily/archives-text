## Changing our view of 'Hamlet' 
### ANDREW EERKOWITZ Staff writer 
To leave or not to leave: That Is
the question. "Rosencrantz and
Guildenstern are Dead" Is simply
too long a play. What starts out as
an Interesting and unique ap
proach to Shakespeare turns Into
an endless three-hour colloquy be
tween Rosencrantz, Guildenstern
and miscellaneous players of
varying Importance.
Three hours Is two consecutive
Conflict and Change Western Cul
ture lectures. Three hours is Big
Game. Three hours is too long for
this play.
The leads — senior lan Cum
mings as Rosencrantz and junior
Drew Barr as Guildenstern — are
very impressive in two highly de
manding roles. A good deal of the
play consists of Rosencrantz and
Guildenstern engaged in alternat
ing banter on a variety of Shake
spearean and other philosophical
issues. Cummings and Barr
tackle their roles with precision
and wit.
At one point in the dialogue,
Rosencrantz and Guildenstern
tangle in a game of questions
(each must answer the other's
question with a new question; no
repetitions, no synonyms, no
rhetoric) that zips between the
two with audience-pleasing ra
pidity. Both actors mangage to
bring unique and sympathetic
personalities to their characters.
Barr's Guildenstern is more intel
ligent and calm. Cummings'
Rosencrantz is excitable, emo
tional and, well, one foot short of a
full pentameter.

To leave or not
to leave: That is
the question.

At this point you may be saying
"What is this play about?" Stop
pard wrote "Rosencrantz and
Guildenstern are Dead" 20 years
ago. and the play immediately es
tablished him as one of Britain's
leading comic playwrights. On the
simplest level, the play takes us
through the plot of "Hamlet" as
seen through the perspective of
the minor courtiers Rosencrantz

and Guildenstern. But they are far
from being walking Cliffs Notes.
In fact they need the Cliffs Notes
because while the audience knows
what happens in the plot of
"Hamlet" (assuming the audience
read it in high school), Rosen
crantz and Guildenstern spend
the duration of the play trying to
determine just what Is going on
around them.
The courtiers see fragments of
two other worlds. One is the world
of the court, where powerful fig
ures stride purposefully about. It
is this world that employs and ul
timately exploits Rosencrantz and
Guildenstern. The other world is
that of the troupe of tragedians
who perform "The Murder of Gon
zago" for the court at Elslnore.
Led by a melodramatic master,
they are marginally competent but
"always pick up wonderfully for
the deaths."
It is their ability to falsify death
that gives them a terrifying sense
of immortality. Rosencrantz and
Guildenstern discover amid these
two Images of death — the
planned death of Hamlet and the
performances of the players —
their own ultimate ends.
One of the best aspects of the
production is the set. It consists of
white lines on a sloping black
background that shoots up
toward the sky at the rear of the
stage. Designed by Drama Prof.
William Eddelman, the set is
supposed to "evoke open,
meaningless vastness, a limbo
which takes on shape only when
court characters enter to give it
definition." Of course, the set can
also be a panacea for those of us
who are unable to afford mind
altering drugs.
Other notables in the cast in
clude Jeff Schwamberger as The
Player and senior James Kennedy
as Hamlet. Kennedy's mad prince
Hamlet, in fact, is very similar to
Kennedy's psycho-killer Bollin in
"Mister, Mister" (which ran a
scant three weeks ago), indicating
that he either likes to play dis
turbed characters or accidentally
stumbled onto the stage and
thought he was still performing in
"Mister, Mister."
"Rosencrantz and Guildenstern
are Dead" is not an easy play to
grasp. It not only gives new lives to
the title characters, but also —
through their perspective —
changes the way we look at
"Hamlet." It also changes the way

we view traditional drama.
A good deal of audience concen
tration is necessary to understand
the complexity and many layers of
Stoppard's play. Unfortunately,
graduate student Jarrett Walker's
direction is too slow, and the
numerous dramatic pauses in the
dialogue contribute to a lagging
pace and a seemingly endless pro
duction. As the play drags on, it
becomes more and more difficult
to concentrate on what the char
acters are saying.

Audience reaction during the
first week has been mixed. Some
have found the play to be delight
ful despite its length, while others
have left the theater before the
beginning of the third act. Either
way, a quicker pace — and a
shorter play — would make the ex
perience much more enjoyable.
Tickets are available at the Tres
idder ticket office. Performances
are tonight through Saturday at 8
p.m. in the Little Theater at
Memorial Auditorium.

The play's the thing: lan Cummings and Drew Barr (1-r) star as
Rosencrantz and Guildenstern in Tom Stoppard's celebrated debut,
"Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are Dead," now running in Little
Theater.
To leave or not to leave: That Is
the question. "Rosencrantz and
Guildenstern are Dead" Is simply
too long a play. What starts out as
an Interesting and unique ap
proach to Shakespeare turns Into
an endless three-hour colloquy be
tween Rosencrantz, Guildenstern
and miscellaneous players of
varying Importance.
Three hours Is two consecutive
Conflict and Change Western Cul
ture lectures. Three hours is Big
Game. Three hours is too long for
this play.
The leads — senior lan Cum
mings as Rosencrantz and junior
Drew Barr as Guildenstern — are
very impressive in two highly de
manding roles. A good deal of the
play consists of Rosencrantz and
Guildenstern engaged in alternat
ing banter on a variety of Shake
spearean and other philosophical
issues. Cummings and Barr
tackle their roles with precision
and wit.
At one point in the dialogue,
Rosencrantz and Guildenstern
tangle in a game of questions
(each must answer the other's
question with a new question; no
repetitions, no synonyms, no
rhetoric) that zips between the
two with audience-pleasing ra
pidity. Both actors mangage to
bring unique and sympathetic
personalities to their characters.
Barr's Guildenstern is more intel
ligent and calm. Cummings'
Rosencrantz is excitable, emo
tional and, well, one foot short of a
full pentameter.

To leave or not
to leave: That is
the question.

At this point you may be saying
"What is this play about?" Stop
pard wrote "Rosencrantz and
Guildenstern are Dead" 20 years
ago. and the play immediately es
tablished him as one of Britain's
leading comic playwrights. On the
simplest level, the play takes us
through the plot of "Hamlet" as
seen through the perspective of
the minor courtiers Rosencrantz

and Guildenstern. But they are far
from being walking Cliffs Notes.
In fact they need the Cliffs Notes
because while the audience knows
what happens in the plot of
"Hamlet" (assuming the audience
read it in high school), Rosen
crantz and Guildenstern spend
the duration of the play trying to
determine just what Is going on
around them.
The courtiers see fragments of
two other worlds. One is the world
of the court, where powerful fig
ures stride purposefully about. It
is this world that employs and ul
timately exploits Rosencrantz and
Guildenstern. The other world is
that of the troupe of tragedians
who perform "The Murder of Gon
zago" for the court at Elslnore.
Led by a melodramatic master,
they are marginally competent but
"always pick up wonderfully for
the deaths."
It is their ability to falsify death
that gives them a terrifying sense
of immortality. Rosencrantz and
Guildenstern discover amid these
two Images of death — the
planned death of Hamlet and the
performances of the players —
their own ultimate ends.
One of the best aspects of the
production is the set. It consists of
white lines on a sloping black
background that shoots up
toward the sky at the rear of the
stage. Designed by Drama Prof.
William Eddelman, the set is
supposed to "evoke open,
meaningless vastness, a limbo
which takes on shape only when
court characters enter to give it
definition." Of course, the set can
also be a panacea for those of us
who are unable to afford mind
altering drugs.
Other notables in the cast in
clude Jeff Schwamberger as The
Player and senior James Kennedy
as Hamlet. Kennedy's mad prince
Hamlet, in fact, is very similar to
Kennedy's psycho-killer Bollin in
"Mister, Mister" (which ran a
scant three weeks ago), indicating
that he either likes to play dis
turbed characters or accidentally
stumbled onto the stage and
thought he was still performing in
"Mister, Mister."
"Rosencrantz and Guildenstern
are Dead" is not an easy play to
grasp. It not only gives new lives to
the title characters, but also —
through their perspective —
changes the way we look at
"Hamlet." It also changes the way

we view traditional drama.
A good deal of audience concen
tration is necessary to understand
the complexity and many layers of
Stoppard's play. Unfortunately,
graduate student Jarrett Walker's
direction is too slow, and the
numerous dramatic pauses in the
dialogue contribute to a lagging
pace and a seemingly endless pro
duction. As the play drags on, it
becomes more and more difficult
to concentrate on what the char
acters are saying.

Audience reaction during the
first week has been mixed. Some
have found the play to be delight
ful despite its length, while others
have left the theater before the
beginning of the third act. Either
way, a quicker pace — and a
shorter play — would make the ex
perience much more enjoyable.
Tickets are available at the Tres
idder ticket office. Performances
are tonight through Saturday at 8
p.m. in the Little Theater at
Memorial Auditorium.
