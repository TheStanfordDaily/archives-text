# Shades of Gray in 'Cambodia'
## 
### JENNIFER TSAY 
"Swimming to Cambodia"
consists of a man and his
monologue, with a supporting
cast of two maps, a desk and a
half-filled glass of water. At first
glance, it seems to exhibit all
the characteristics of the
dreaded "art film," a genre
notorious for its overabun
dance of intellectual dialogue
that hardly makes up for its
lack of plot and action.
"My Dinner with Andre"
comes quickly to mind. There
was a film that should have
carried a surgeon general's
warning: "The pretentious and
esoteric nature of this film may
induce drowsiness and bore
dom. If symptoms persist, leave
the theater immediately."
Fortunately, "Swimming to
Cambodia" avoids such a label.
Spalding Gray, who wrote and
stars in the film, delivers an
amazing performance. His one
man act not only maintains au
dience interest for two hours,
but encourages repeated
viewings. Although initially his
voice sounds strained and
tense, his nervousness soon
passes as he becomes increas
ingly at ease with his audience.
Gray has toured with his
monologue across the country.
He is an actor more known for
his experimental theater work

than his screen roles. He has
appeared in"The Killing Fields"
and more recently in David
Byrne's "True Stories."
The former movie motivates
his fascinating monologue.
"The Killing Fields," which won
several Academy Awards, takes
place in Cambodia during and
after the Vietnam War. The
main plot focuses on the expe
riences of New York Times
reporter Sydney Schanberg and
his photographer and trans
lator, Dith Pran.
Gray appears in the minor
role of aide to the American am
bassador. It was a part that di
rector Roland Joffe felt would
be perfect for Gray because of
Gray's preppy good looks and
his candid admission that he
knew nothing about Cam
bodia.
He didn't stay ignorant for
long. Prior to leaving for
Thailand, where the film was
shot, Gray did some reading on
Cambodia's recent history.
Armed with a pointer and two
maps, he proceeds to tell us
about the tragedy of this small
nation: its relationship with
the United States during the
Vietnam War and the succeed
ing regime of Pol Pot, who
carried out a program of
genocide that ranks as one of

the worst in the history of
humanity.
Yet Gray's self-effacing manner
removes any trace of trite or
pedantic moralizing. He admits
that his research on Cambodia
arose from his lack of participa
tion in the war protests of the
'60s.
This admission of guilt and the
twinge of political conscience is a

confession that automatically
gains our confidence, our trust in
his sincerity. By bringing his nar
ration down to a more intimate
level, Gray goes beyond presenting
a mere history lesson. His is the
impassioned plea of a man realiz
ing the horrors human beings can
perpetrate upon one another.
Gray speaks as if he were actu
ally conversing with his unseen
viewer, and like any good conver
sationalist, the topics he intro
duces flow randomly from one to
the other, tangential digressions
that add to rather than detract

from the richness of his perfor
mance. His material encompasses
more than just Cambodia. It also
includes bits and pieces from his
personal life, as a struggling actor
in New York and as a member of
"The Killing Fields" film crew,
whose experiences in Thailand he
relates with great enthusiasm.
Credit must be given to director
Jonathan Demme, who helped
edit Gray's original three-hour
long program to its present two
hour format without losing the
energy that a live performance
usually commands. The insertion

of several scenes from"The Killing
Fields" also gives more cohesive
ness to Gray's shortened
monologue, and Laurie Ander
son's quirky, tribal pop music en
hances the exotic nature of Gray's
experiences in Thailand.
Inspired by the Thai "sinug," a
term denoting the pursuit of plea
sure, Gray searches for "the per
fect moment," whether it be a
rented evening's worth of enter
tainment or a day spent body
surfing in the sea. Yet beneath
this seemingly frivolous search
lurks a darker side. Because he is

in Thailand for the shooting of
"The Killing Fields," Gray never
forgets the past horrors of Cam
bodia, even while he is indulging
in the carnal pleasures of
Bangkok. For Gray, the adjacent
countries of Cambodia and
Thailand become symbols of
man's capacity for extreme vio
lence and pleasure, and the ten
sion between them.
Appropriately, Gray encounters
his "perfect moment" while swim
ming off the coast of Thailand â€”
"Swimming to Cambodia," as the
film's title suggests. His en

lightenment, stemming from a
curious juxtaposition of pleasure
and horror, haunts the viewer
long after the film's end. Gray im
plicitly raises questons about
human nature, its selfishness and
cruelty, and the morality of
seeking self-fulfillment, whether
spiritual or physical, in the face of
extreme human suffering. He
avoids resolution and instead en
courages us to swim, like himself,
alone and far from shore, in order
to find our own perfect moments,
our own sense of meaning and or
der in a seemingly chaotic world.
