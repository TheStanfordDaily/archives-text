# Shades of Gray in 'Cambodia'
## 
### JENNIFER TSAY 
"Swimming to Cambodia"
consists of a man and his
monologue, with a supporting
cast of two maps, a desk and a
half-filled glass of water. At first
glance, it seems to exhibit all
the characteristics of the
dreaded "art film," a genre
notorious for its overabun
dance of intellectual dialogue
that hardly makes up for its
lack of plot and action.
"My Dinner with Andre"
comes quickly to mind. There
was a film that should have
carried a surgeon general's
warning: "The pretentious and
esoteric nature of this film may
induce drowsiness and bore
dom. If symptoms persist, leave
the theater immediately."
Fortunately, "Swimming to
Cambodia" avoids such a label.
Spalding Gray, who wrote and
stars in the film, delivers an
amazing performance. His one
man act not only maintains au
dience interest for two hours,
but encourages repeated
viewings. Although initially his
voice sounds strained and
tense, his nervousness soon
passes as he becomes increas
ingly at ease with his audience.
Gray has toured with his
monologue across the country.
He is an actor more known for
his experimental theater work

than his screen roles. He has
appeared in"The Killing Fields"
and more recently in David
Byrne's "True Stories."
The former movie motivates
his fascinating monologue.
"The Killing Fields," which won
several Academy Awards, takes
place in Cambodia during and
after the Vietnam War. The
main plot focuses on the expe
riences of New York Times
reporter Sydney Schanberg and
his photographer and trans
lator, Dith Pran.
Gray appears in the minor
role of aide to the American am
bassador. It was a part that di
rector Roland Joffe felt would
be perfect for Gray because of
Gray's preppy good looks and
his candid admission that he
knew nothing about Cam
bodia.
He didn't stay ignorant for
long. Prior to leaving for
Thailand, where the film was
shot, Gray did some reading on
Cambodia's recent history.
Armed with a pointer and two
maps, he proceeds to tell us
about the tragedy of this small
nation: its relationship with
the United States during the
Vietnam War and the succeed
ing regime of Pol Pot, who
carried out a program of
genocide that ranks as one of
