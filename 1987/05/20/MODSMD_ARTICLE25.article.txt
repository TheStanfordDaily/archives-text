# The 						war at home: 'Gardens of Stone'
## 
### GEORDIE McKEE 
In a day and age when Vietnam
movies are marked by gory detail,
it's refreshing to see that the same
anti-war message can be conveyed
without taking the viewer onto the
bloody battlefields. In "Gardens of
Stone." we see an interesting and
original attempt at portraying
that horrible war from the outside
looking in.
Although produced and directed
by the legendary Francis Ford

Coppola, "Gardens of Stone" is a
film that departs from the likes of
his previous success "Apocalypse
Now" and deals primarily with
relationships and interaction
among the "family" of the U.S.
Army.
James Caan stars as Sgt. Clell
Hazard, a frustrated man who
doesn't believe in the Vietnam
cause, but who wants to help
those youngsters unfortunate
enough to be sent there. Set in
1968 at Fort Myers, Va., Hazard is

"stuck" with the ceremonial
duties of the Old Guard — oversee
ing and training young recruits to
look after the esteemed Arlington
National Cemetery. He and his
best friend, Sgt. "Goody" Wilson
(James Earl Jones), spend much
of their time fighting over the
meaning of the war and their own
involvement with it.
At times, they even make fun of
their seemingly insignificant posi
tions in the Army. At the same
time, they manage to keep the
movie alive with colorful, detailed
personalities and tremendous
screen presence. Both Caan and
Jones do a superb job of develop
ing their characters into realistic
and intriguing people.
When a gung-ho young private
named Jackie Willow (played by
newcomer D.B. Sweeney) comes to
Fort Myers and sheds his highly
spirited and idealistic views on
the two sergeants, they immedi
ately take a liking to the boy. Haz
ard suddenly finds renewed
meaning and interest in the Army
as he takes the new recruit under
his wing. The two develop a
father-son relationship (Willow
lost his father in the war, and Haz
ard never knew his son due to his
military commitments) that is
both poignant and powerful.
Despite the fact that little action
transpires, this film grows and
blossoms with the characters and
the relationships between these
three men. All three contribute to
the success of "Gardens of Stone,"
but credit must be given to Caan
for making it work so well. It is his

versatility and the universal ap
peal of his character that ties the
others in and gives the movie
unity.
Although it is a film that deals
mainly with conflicting ideals and
viewpoints, the underlying theme
is very sound. The audience can
not help but admire and respect
the character of Jackie Willow.
He's the kind of kid who stands

firmly behind his yet-untested set
of beliefs with passion. Sadly,
though, it is this same set of naive
beliefs that is destroyed by the
ugliness of Vietnam.
The war was a disillusioning
and nightmarish experience to
nearly all involved, but Coppola
skillfully manages to present this
idea without the unpleasant visu
als that we are so tired of witness

ing. Moreover, "Gardens of Stone"
contains plenty of light-hearted
humor, along with its share of
romances. Anjelica Huston turns
in a fine performance as Hazard's
lover, as does Mary Stuart Master
son as Willow's girl.
This movie has more than just a
relevant political statement to of
fer — it is entertaining and taste
fully done at the same time.
