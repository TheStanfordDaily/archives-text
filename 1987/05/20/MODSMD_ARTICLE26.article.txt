## Fendick taken to 3, joins Green in semis 
### KEN STEVENS Senior staff writer 
LOS ANGELES — When she signed a letter of in
tent last year to play tennis at Stanford, Lisa Green
doubted whether she would make the Cardinal
lineup — not to mention the NCAA singles semifinals
— as a freshman.
Everyone expected Patty Fendick to make this
year's semifinals, but there was a moment yesterday
when not even Fendick thought she would get there.
Yet, when play ended yesterday at the Los Angeles
Tennis Center, both Green and Fendick had ad
vanced to today's 2 p.m. semifinals. Green will play
Florida's Shaun Stafford, while Fendick will battle
SMU's Jennifer Santrock.
Fendick's quest for back-to-back singles titles al
most came to a sudden end in yesterday's third
round. Miami's Lise Gregory became the first player
this season to take a first set from Fendick. She kept
the Cardinal senior off-balance with her serve to win
the opening set, 6-3.
"I was kind of panicking for a while," Fendick said.
"She had a strange serve — a left-handed serve with a
kick."
When Gregory took the first two games of the
second set, Fendick envisioned the end of her 53-
match win streak. "I was worried from the first point
on," she said. "I didn't think I was going to get
through."
Fendick kept her head above water by winning a 3-
all point in the third game of the set. From that point
on she seized the momentum from Gregory. Fendick
won eight games in a row to capture the second set 6-
2 and take a 2-0 lead in the third set.
She extended the lead to 5-1 and eventually
prevailed 6-2 to advance to the quarterfinals, where

she met Florida's Jill Heatherlngton, her former
doubles partner.
Heatherlngton had toppled sixth-seeded Monique
Javer of San Diego State 7-6. 3-6, 6-3 in the morning
round, but she was no match for Fendick.
Having advanced with Fendick to last year's
doubles semifinals at Wimbledon, Heatherlngton
knows Fendick's game as well as anyone. But yester
day she was overwhelmed, 6-2, 6-1.
In Santrock, Fendick will be up against another
power-hitter. "She hits hard, I hit hard, " Fendick
said. "We'll have fun."
En route to the semifinals, Santrock beat Stanford
senior Stephanie Savides 6-0, 6-3 in yesterday's
third round.
Green started slowly, but once she got rolling she
breezed into the semifinals. After falling behind
Oklahoma State's Tessa Price 4-1 in the opening set
of their third-round match, Green won 11 of the next
12 games to post a 6-4, 6-1 victory.
In the quarterfinals. Green was matched against
Florida's Tammy Whlttington, whom she had beaten
7-5, 6-3 in Saturday's semifinals of the team tourna
ment.
Green repeated the trick yesterday, continuing to
hit the ball solidly to both sides of the court. Whlt
tington could not run down enough balls, and Green
prevailed 6-4, 6-3.
"I didn't really think I'd be here (in the semi
finals)," Green said after the match. "She (Stafford)
is playing really well. I have to try to keep down my
unforced errors."
Meanwhile, in non-Stanford doubles action, the
fifth-seeded team of Jane Thomas and Jennifer
Fuchs from UCLA met a bizarre — and perhaps all
too fitting — end. Thomas, a senior, and Fuchs, a
sophomore who is going professional after this year,

met Indiana's Kelly Mulvihill and Janet McCutcheon
in the second round.
Trailing 4-2 in the third set, Thomas and Fuchs
dropped another game to go behind 5-2. On the
changeover, the boorish Fuchs — who had already

picked up several penalty points for untoward behav
ior earlier in the match — slammed her racket to the
ground, at which point the chair umpire assessed a
game penalty to the UCLA pair. That made the score
6-2: game, set, match.
