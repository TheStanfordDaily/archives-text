### TOM SENF Senior staff writer 
Stanford Coach Mark Marquess
yesterday was named Pactfic 10
Southern Division Coach of the Year
and four members of the Six-Pac
champion Cardinal were chosen to
the all-conference team by the six
league coaches.
Marquess guided a young Cardinal
team to a 21-9 conference record, five
games ahead of UCLA and Arizona
State. It was Stanford's fourth title in
the past five years.
The Cardinal members of the All
Six-Pac squad are Ed Sprague,
Ruben Amaro, Jack McDowell and
Steve Chitren.
In only his second season at Stan
ford, Sprague emerged as one of the
Six-Pac's most dangerous hitters.
The sophomore third baseman led
the Cardinal with 14 homers and 64
RBIs, good for fourth and third in the
conference, respectively. He hit .331.
Amaro was the quintessential
leadoff man for Stanford this season.
The senior left fielder finished fourth
in the league in hitting with a .351
average and also drew 44 walks for a
.455 on-base percentage. He tied for
second among Six-Pac base thieves
with 31 steals.
McDowell, who was also named to
the all-conference team last season
during his sophomore year, is the

only repeater among the Cardinal se
lections. The hard-throwing right
hander suffered some frustrating
outings this year, but still finished
With a 9-4 record and a 4.37 ERA. His
93 strikeouts were third in the
league, and he led the conference in
strikeouts per inning pitched.
After beginning the season in Stan
ford's starting rotation, Chitren was
moved to the bullpen near the end of
March and flourished, compiling 11
saves to go with a 6-3 record. His 3.34
ERA was second in the Six-Pac, as
was his save total.
The six coaches decided to spread
the honors, with the top four teams
in the Six-Pac — Stanford, UCLA,
Arizona State and Arizona — placing
four players on the 21-man team.
The Bruin contingent is led by
senior second baseman Torey
Lovullo, named along with Arizona's
Chip Hale as Co-Player of the Year for
the second straight year.
The other Bruins are sophomores
Eric Karros and Charlie Fiacco and
senior pitcher/designated hitter
Steve Stowell, named to the squad as
a utility man.
For Arizona, Hale won the confer
ence batting crown by 44 points with
his .399 average. He was joined on
the squad by teammates Steve Strong
(catcher), Gary Alexander (outfield)
and second-time selection Gilbert
Heredia (pitcher).

Arizona State was represented by
conference ERA champ (2.95) Mike
Schwabe, along with catcher Tim
Spehr, shortstop Mike Benjamin and
designated hitter Tony Mattia.
The remaining members of the All
Six-Pac team are infielder Darryl Vice,
outfielder Todd Mayo and relief
pitcher Fred Corral of California and
outfielder Keith Watkins and
catcher/relief pitcher Brian Nichols of
use.
Six Cardinal players — outfielders
Toi Cook and Paul Carey, shortstop
David Esquer, designated hitter Jeff
Saenger and pitchers Lee Plemel and
Rob Wassenaar — were given
honorable mention.
Stanford could easily have had
three of its honorable mention selec
tions on the first team. The power
numbers of both Cook (10 HRs, 55
RBIs) and Carey (10 HRs. 45 RBIs)
were far superior to those of out
fielders Mayo. Watkins and Fiacco.
Plemel's 3.37 ERA was third in the
conference and second among
starters.
Card rtotes
Because a pitcher must throw an
average of one inning per team game to
qualify for the ERA standings. Wassenaar
missed the title — by one-third of an in
ning. The senior right-hander compiled a
2.56 ERA, but pitched just 59 2/3 innings
in Stanford's 60 games.
