# Hockey team grabs crown
## 
### 
The Stanford ice hockey team
capped a banner season Sunday
night by winning the Bay Area
Hockey League championship.
After finishing in first place
during the regular season with a
record of 10-1-5. Stanford entered
the weekend needing to beat the
San Mateo Seals twice to capture
the league crown. Stanford had
lost its first playoff game, and
then won its next two to stay alive
in the double-elimination tourna
ment.
Saturday night. Stanford rallied
from a 4-1 deficit to tie the game
6-6 at the end of regulation.
Senior Gary Rothschild (three
goals), graduate student captain
Jon Zierk (two goals) and
graduate student Greg Conley
(one goal) accounted for Stan
ford's scoring.
Freshman Chris Sy. graduate
students Scott Tilley and Buster
Nicholson and senior Keith Patter
son spearheaded the defensive
corps, which slowed the speedy
San Mateo forwards. Stanford
Coach Paul Estey commended
Massachusetts native Mike
Sabina and graduate student
Dave Shapiro for their hustling

play.
The star of the game, however,
emerged in overtime. After a
scoreless five-minute overtime
period, penalty shots were used to
determine the victor, with each
team getting five shots. Canadian
goaltender Burke Thorton. who
had been solid all night, was spec
tacular in the showdown, turning
away all five San Mateo breakaway
shots.
The two teams clashed again
Sunday night to determine the
league champion. Stanford
jumped out to an early 3-0 lead
with Rothschild, graduate stu
dent Dave Wright and Tilley all
scoring first period goals. San
Mateo fought back, and Stanford
needed goals by senior Danny Am
nion and Wright to deadlock the
game at 5-5 at the end of regula
tion play.
Just as the night before, the
overtime period proved incon
clusive, and the game went to
penalty shots. Thornton again
rose to the occasion, stopping four
of five point-blank shots, while
Zierk and Ammon connected on
their breakwaways to seal the
championship by a 7-6 score.
