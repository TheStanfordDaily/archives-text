## 
### JON WEISMAN Staff writer 
By virtue of their top-16 seeds in singles
competition at this week's NCAA champion
ships in Athens, Ga., Stanford's Patrick
McEnroe and Jeff Tarango yesterday were
named to the All-American team in men's
tennis for 1987.
McEnroe and Tarango play their first
round matches this morning as the individ
ual competition gets into full swing.
In the team championships yesterday,
tournament host Georgia, ranked third in
the nation, defeated fifth-ranked UCLA, 5-
1, to garner its second NCAA men's tennis
crown in three years. Georgia, UCLA or
Stanford have won or shared the national
title every year since 1973.
Because Stanford was not invited to the
team competition. McEnroe and Tarango
have been gearing up specifically for the in
dividuals.
McEnroe, All-America for the second
straight year, opens against Minnesota's
Jonas Svensson. Should McEnroe advance,
the 1 lth-ranked junior would meet the win
ner of the match between Arizona State's
Ken Kuperstein (ranked 54th) and Nevada-
Las Vegas' Scott Warner (ranked 65th) later
In the day.
Earlier this season. Kuperstein defeated
McEnroe in a dual match, 6-4, 6-4, but
McEnroe had just returned from a six-week
layoff due to injuries. Now, McEnroe says he
is primed to play.
"I'm feeling pretty well, as well as I've felt
for a long time." said McEnroe, a junior.
"You have to be in good shape down here —
it's hot and humid. There are a lot of tough
matches you have to play. I've just got to
take one match at a time, and see how it
goes."

Tarango, a freshman, will play New
Mexico's Steve Blckham this morning.
Recalling Bickham from a dual match of
two years ago, Stanford Coach Dick Gould
said he is an "aggressive player" with a "big
serve." The winner of the match will play
either 44th-ranked Ned Caswell of Furman
or 35th-ranked Paul Koscielski of Texas.
Tarango said he felt he had been strug
gling in his latest dual matches and went
home to Southern California the week
before the NCAAs to meet with his coach.
Now, the 31st-ranked player says he is
feeling "100 percent better." Becoming an
All-America was also a big lift.
"1 was really happy," Tarango said. "It's a
great honor, and to get it as a freshman . . .
makes me happy."
McEnroe put the award, which goes both
to players seeded in the top 16 and players
who advance to the final 16, in perspective.
"It was nice to be recognized," he said. "I
hope I can make something of it. I'm cer
tainly not satisfied. It's a great honor, but
hopefully I'll do something in the tourna
ment."
In the team championship match, Geor
gia, which upset top-ranked and previously
unbeaten USC in the semifinals Monday,
split the first sets of the singles matches
with the Bruins. UCLA's Dan Nahirny,
however, tore ligaments in the second set of
his match and had to default, giving Geor
gia a 3-1 lead and a sure advantage if the
match were to be decided in the doubles.
The loss of Nahirny seemed to be psych
ologically devastating to the Bruins. In the
third set of the remaining two singles
matches, Tim Trlguero blew a 5-2 lead and
finally lost the match in a long tiebreaker,
while Buff Farrow fell easily in his third set.
