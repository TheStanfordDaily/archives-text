# Physicist contests firing
## 
### JAY FRY Staff writer 
A consultant to the Stanford
Relativity Gyroscope Experiment
says he was harassed and subse
quently fired by researchers
working on the project because he
circulated a paper questioning the
reliability of electronics in modern
weapons.
Program administrators deny
the paper caused consultant Ron
Nowicki to be released from his
contract.
Nowicki said he was terminated
in February "after a long period of

harassment" relating to a paper
he wrote in December 1986. "I was
harassed by various members of
the group," he said. "It was clear
they wanted me to leave."
Prof. Bradford Parkinson, the
experiment's program manager,
said the charges made by Nowicki
are untrue and that the paper
Nowicki wrote had nothing to do
with the group's decision to
release him.
Tom Langenstein, deputy proj
ect manager. also denied
Nowicki's paper was related to his
release from the project. "I don't
see where it was very pertinent at

all to his being let go," he said.
According to Parkinson, consul
tants hired to work on the on
going experiment are usually
hired temporarily and "may be
discontinued at any time.
"We use them (independent con
sultants such as Nowicki) when
we need them," he said. "We con
cluded it was time for us to move
ahead and [Nowicki] to go about
his business."
Nowicki was given approxi
mately four weeks notice before he
was released. Parkinson said.
Nowicki worked for the project
for about six months, he said,
which "may be a little longer" than
most consultants. "There was no
animosity on our part" when
Nowicki was released. Parkinson
said. "His usefulness was over."
Nowicki worked as a technical
expert on the thin metal films
used to coat gyroscope rotors and
housings.
The gyroscope experiment is in
tended to send a probe into
geosynchronous earth orbit with
four high-precision gyroscopes on
board, according to Nowicki. The
gyroscopes will be able test the

validity of Einstein's theory of
curved space, he said.
Nowicki also said that much of
the research done for Stanford's
gyroscope experiment could even
tually be incorporated into the
Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI)
— a claim denied by project
managers.
Nowicki said the gyroscopes will
be so precise that they could be
"used for first-strike positioning
of ICBMs."
According to Nowicki. unclas
sified projects similar to the gyro
scope experiment which have in
terested Lockheed and NASA in
the past have gone from "science
project (to) a defense application."
"There is no direct evidence that
(using the research for SDI) is

their intent," Nowicki said.
"However, the interest by
Lockheed and NASA has some
bearing."
While similar projects do
sometimes enter military jurisdic
tion. the experiment group has
"never been approached by the
military." Parkinson said. "As a
military system it would be totally
impractical." he said. "It's totally
out of the question."
The gyroscopes use liquid
helium at zero acceleration which,
according to Parkinson, is far too
delicate for ICBMs or any other
defense-related use.
Nowicki did not say that his
views on the project's possible SDI
application played a role in his
dismissal.
