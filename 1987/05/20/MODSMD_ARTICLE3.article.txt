# Physicist contests firing

### JAY FRY Staff writer 
A consultant to the Stanford
Relativity Gyroscope Experiment
says he was harassed and subse
quently fired by researchers
working on the project because he
circulated a paper questioning the
reliability of electronics in modern
weapons.
Program administrators deny
the paper caused consultant Ron
Nowicki to be released from his
contract.
Nowicki said he was terminated
in February "after a long period of

harassment" relating to a paper
he wrote in December 1986. "I was
harassed by various members of
the group," he said. "It was clear
they wanted me to leave."
Prof. Bradford Parkinson, the
experiment's program manager,
said the charges made by Nowicki
are untrue and that the paper
Nowicki wrote had nothing to do
with the group's decision to
release him.
Tom Langenstein, deputy proj
ect manager. also denied
Nowicki's paper was related to his
release from the project. "I don't
see where it was very pertinent at

all to his being let go," he said.
According to Parkinson, consul
tants hired to work on the on
going experiment are usually
hired temporarily and "may be
discontinued at any time.
"We use them (independent con
sultants such as Nowicki) when
we need them," he said. "We con
cluded it was time for us to move
ahead and [Nowicki] to go about
his business."
Nowicki was given approxi
mately four weeks notice before he
was released. Parkinson said.
