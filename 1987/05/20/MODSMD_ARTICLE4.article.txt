### JAY BHATTACHARYA Staff writer 
The Committee on Parking and
Transportation discussed the
opening of new parking sites.
Stanford's ticketing policy and fu
ture parking policy at a public
meeting yesterday.
"The goal is to supply sufficient
parking for everyone within a
reasonable distance of the
working place." said Dennis

Perkinson, University associate
director of transportation pro
grams.
But Perkinson told an audience
of about 25 people that this goal is
often difficult because land must
be allocated to new buildings and
other academic resources.
He said the University is cur
rently in the process of building
two parking structures. The first
complex, now under construction
near the Stanford Medical Center.

will accommodate 1.000 cars and
is scheduled to open by mid-July.
A second structure designed to
hold an additional 750 cars be
hind Forsythe Hall will be ready by
fall 1988, Perkinson said.
The two structures will cost an
estimated *17.7 million.
Despite the new spaces. Perkin
son said, an additional 2.400
spaces will be needed between
now and the year 2000.
An Important priority in plan
ning new parking sites is keeping
a "vehicle-exclusion core area
close to the center of campus."
said Judy Chan, associate direc
tor of planning.
But Chan said unavoidable
space constraints will- force future
parking sites closer to the central
campus than ever before.
Stanford Police Chief Marvin
Herrington said the current
parking permit policy Is necessary
"to manage the parking spaces

that we have." Otherwise, he
warned, "We would become a
dumping ground for Palo Alto
parking."
The rationale for the ticketing
policy is to "guarantee" spaces to
those who buy permits, Her
rington said. Stanford Public
Safety officers now issue between
30,000 and 50,000 tickets each
year. All fines go to the County of
Santa Clara, he said.
Herrington said he supports the
current resident parking policy.
"We want to discourage residents
from moving their cars around
campus," he said. This extra traf
fic leads to congestion that incon
veniences regular commuters, he
said.

Audience members quizzed the
committee on a variety of parking
issues, including loading zones
near the Quad, incorrect parking
tickets and the Marguerite shuttle
service.
Perkinson and Chan said
loading zones and increased
access to the Quad are currently
being considered.
Herrington said the University
can only "recommend dismissal"
of incorrectly billed tickets. "Once
they are issued, they become
(Santa Clara) county responsibil
ity." he said.
Perkinson defended the Mar
guerite system. "Thirteen
hundred people per day use the
main campus route," he said.
