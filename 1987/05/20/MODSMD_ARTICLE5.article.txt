### HARU CONNOLLY Staff writer 
David Bowie and/or Madonna may perform at Stanford Stadium in late July or early Au
gust pending University approval. Concert Network officials said at last night's ASSU Sen
ate meeting.

"These two shows have been proposed by
a promoter from Southern California, and
they have been confirmed on the condition
of University approval," said Scott Davis,
immediate past chairman of the Concert
Network Advisory Board.
In a voice vote last night; the ASSU Sen
ate overwhelmingly approved a resolution
to recommend that the University approve a
concert in the stadium during the summer
of 1987.
The resolution states that University Ad
ministration approval "is the last hurdle in
bringing either David Bowie or Madonna to
Stanford Stadium."
Davis said, "The Senate recommendation
represents a show of student support."
According to Davis, the proceeds from the
Bowie or Madonna concert could be used to
underwrite future shows and support a
charity.
"There is the possibility of the show being
a benefit," Davis said. "The proceeds above
production expenses would go to a charity
named by the Concert Network." The deci
sion whether the concert will be a benefit
will be made in the next week or two.
The summer concerts are expected to
have a positive long-term effect on the net
work. "This concert will help us develop
relationships with promoters and give us
experience," said Davis.
The senate resolution states, "This show
can help the Concert Network develop and
cultivate the needed business relationships
with co-promoters who can bring big-name
artists which students demand."
The summer concert could be
underwritten by ticket revenues
and outside revenues. Davis said.
The Concert Network also
received Senate approval to
receive the first part of the group's
fee assessment, approved by stu
dents in last month's ASSU elec

tion. Senate approval was in
doubt because of questions re
garding the payment of the Net
work's faculty adviser.
The funds from the first part of
the fee assessment were ear
marked exclusively to underwrite
rock shows sponsored by the net
work in the coming year.
The network must seek outside
funding sources to pay for an advi
ser's salary that was defeated in

the second part of the group's fee
request. Davis said.
"It is very likely that we will get
(that funding) from the dean of
students or other University de
partments," Davis said.
According to Larry Bloch. dep
uty senate chair, the first fee
assessment is important for the
"development of a business rela
tionship and the development of
high-quality shows."
