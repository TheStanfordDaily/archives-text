David Bowie and/or Madonna may perform at Stanford Stadium in late July or early Au
gust pending University approval. Concert Network officials said at last night's ASSU Sen
ate meeting.

"These two shows have been proposed by
a promoter from Southern California, and
they have been confirmed on the condition
of University approval," said Scott Davis,
immediate past chairman of the Concert
Network Advisory Board.
In a voice vote last night; the ASSU Sen
ate overwhelmingly approved a resolution
to recommend that the University approve a
concert in the stadium during the summer
of 1987.
The resolution states that University Ad
ministration approval "is the last hurdle in
bringing either David Bowie or Madonna to
Stanford Stadium."
Davis said, "The Senate recommendation
represents a show of student support."
According to Davis, the proceeds from the
Bowie or Madonna concert could be used to
underwrite future shows and support a
charity.
"There is the possibility of the show being
a benefit," Davis said. "The proceeds above
production expenses would go to a charity
named by the Concert Network." The deci
sion whether the concert will be a benefit
will be made in the next week or two.
The summer concerts are expected to
have a positive long-term effect on the net
work. "This concert will help us develop
relationships with promoters and give us
experience," said Davis.
The senate resolution states, "This show
can help the Concert Network develop and
cultivate the needed business relationships
with co-promoters who can bring big-name
artists which students demand."
