# Senate approves cleaning service
## 
### MONIQUE SCHEER Senior staff writer 
The ASSU Senate voted unanimously last
night to establish a dry cleaning service on
campus next year.
The senate also supported a resolution
setting a timetable for the installation of
condom dispensers in "various campus
locations," and voted to consider nomina
tions for student membership on the Com
mittee on Investment Responsibility (CIR).
The ASSU Dry Cleaning Service next year
will be located in the ASSU offices with
outside window access. So that the ASSU
will not have to purchase the cleaning
equipment, an outside professional dry
cleaner will be subcontracted to do the
work.
The ASSU has received several bids from
area cleaners, but as the bidding process is
not yet complete, prices for the campus ser
vice have not been set. According to the
start-up financing business plan, the price
for cleaning a sports jacket will probably be
approximately $4 and about *3.50 for a
blouse.
The service will be overnight or second
day, and students will be able to pay with
cash or check.
A start-up cost of approximately
$9,000 for the dry-cleaning ser
vice will be loaned by the ASSU
general reserve fund.
The senate passed by an 11-2
vote a bill requesting the Housing

Operations Advisory Committee
"meet during the first two weeks
of fall quarter 1987-88 and
produce a report by the end of fall
quarter assessing the desireability
and feasibility of installing con
dom dispensers in various
campus locations."
The bill, authored by Council of
Presidents member Leonard Ad
ler, cites the effectiveness of con
doms in reducing the transmis
sion of sexually transmitted
diseases and the risk of unwanted
pregnancies as reasons for install
ing the dispensers. It also cites
"overwhelming student support"
for them.
The Nominations Commission
presented its nominees for stu
dent posts on Board of Trustees
and Academic Council commit
tees for next year. The commis
sion did not consider student
nominees for the CIR.
Earlier this month, the senate
voted not to consider nominations
for student membership on the
CIR in protest of the committee's
failure to respond to community
demands for divestment.
Graduate Senator Steve Hell

man proposed that the senate
resume consideration of student
nominees to the committee. The
senate passed the motion by a 9-8
vote.
The commission will accept ap
plications for the CIR positions for
the next week and a half, accord
ing to Christina Felton, chair of
the Nom Com.
In other business, the senate
voted to amend the ASSU bylaws
regarding the date of the spring
elections. In order to minimize the
risk of conflicting with religious
holidays as happened this year,
the bylaws will no longer specify
that the elections be held on Tues
day and Wednesday of the third
week of the quarter.
The senate approved funding al
locations for the Program Board —
with minor changes to the budget
for the Asian-American Activities
Center — and for the Publications
Board. It also passed the 1987-88
ASSU Operating Budget.
The senate also approved a bill
that opposes the "systematic
slaughtering of all wild horses in
the U.S."
