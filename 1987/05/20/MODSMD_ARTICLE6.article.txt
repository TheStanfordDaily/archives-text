# Senate approves cleaning service
## 
### MONIQUE SCHEER Senior staff writer 
The ASSU Senate voted unanimously last
night to establish a dry cleaning service on
campus next year.
The senate also supported a resolution
setting a timetable for the installation of
condom dispensers in "various campus
locations," and voted to consider nomina
tions for student membership on the Com
mittee on Investment Responsibility (CIR).
The ASSU Dry Cleaning Service next year
will be located in the ASSU offices with
outside window access. So that the ASSU
will not have to purchase the cleaning
equipment, an outside professional dry
cleaner will be subcontracted to do the
work.
The ASSU has received several bids from
area cleaners, but as the bidding process is
not yet complete, prices for the campus ser
vice have not been set. According to the
start-up financing business plan, the price
for cleaning a sports jacket will probably be
approximately $4 and about *3.50 for a
blouse.
The service will be overnight or second
day, and students will be able to pay with
cash or check.
