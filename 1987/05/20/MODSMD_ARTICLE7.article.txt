# An unorthodox company attracts' keeps workers
## 
### LISA BROOKS 
At first glance the Oracle Corporation, a
software development company, might
seem like any other large firm that has sent
its recruiters out after bright Stanford
graduates.
"We're looking for creative, achievement
oriented. nice, very smart, gifted people,"
said Larry Lynn, who is in charge of recruit
ment for Oracle at Stanford.
But it is not the qualities that Oracle
looks for in an employee that make the com
pany unusual. Rather, it is the phenomenal
success Oracle has had in keeping the
people it recruits.
Based in Belmont, Oracle was founded in
1979 and now employs over 1,000 people in
39 offices around the world.
"We've doubled our revenues every year

since we've been a corporation," Lynn said.
He emphasized that such success is due to
Oracle's philosophy regarding its employees
and its recruiting practices.
"Our president's philosophy is to keep the
person healthy and adapt the company to
the person, not the person to the company,"
he said. "We think we make the person less
effective if they adapt to the company."
For this reason, employees are allowed to
come to work whenever they want, wear
shorts or other seemingly inappropriate
attire to the office, and even work at home if
that is what they want to do. For a corpora
tion of Oracle's size, that seems like an un
usual step, but Lynn says it works.
"What we pay for and like are results, and
we seem to get them," he said.
Lynn has been a recruiter for
less than two years. In that period,
he has recruited about 300
people, traveling to the MIT, Cal
tech, Carnegie-Mellon, Harvard.
UC-Berkeley and Stanford to pick
out the very best.
Lynn said Oracle employees are
so happy with company that there
is a small turnover of employees.
"Of the 300 people I have hired,
not one has left for any reason,"
Lynn said. "Not only has no one
been fired, but no one has quit."
Oracle wastes little effort in the
search for young talent.
"I made 21 offers to MIT people
and we had 21 acceptances," Lynn
said. "Harvard only has 50 com
puter science majors, and I made
offers to 12 of them. So far we've
had 11 acceptances."
Oracle is attractive to many of
the top college graduates in
America, yet it is not only due to
financial considerations, Lynn
said.
"What we offer is a good salary, a
fine benefit plan, stock options
and a cash bonus on the . . . day
an employee starts with the com
pany," Lynn said.
He emphasized, however, that it
is the environment at Oracle that
is the top attraction for recruits.
"You can't buy people," Lynn
said. "You have to provide a good
environment for them to work in
— that's the attraction.
