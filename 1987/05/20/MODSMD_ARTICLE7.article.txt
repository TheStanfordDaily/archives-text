# An unorthodox company attracts' keeps workers

At first glance the Oracle Corporation, a
software development company, might
seem like any other large firm that has sent
its recruiters out after bright Stanford
graduates.
"We're looking for creative, achievement
oriented. nice, very smart, gifted people,"
said Larry Lynn, who is in charge of recruit
ment for Oracle at Stanford.
But it is not the qualities that Oracle
looks for in an employee that make the com
pany unusual. Rather, it is the phenomenal
success Oracle has had in keeping the
people it recruits.
Based in Belmont, Oracle was founded in
1979 and now employs over 1,000 people in
39 offices around the world.
"We've doubled our revenues every year

since we've been a corporation," Lynn said.
He emphasized that such success is due to
Oracle's philosophy regarding its employees
and its recruiting practices.
"Our president's philosophy is to keep the
person healthy and adapt the company to
the person, not the person to the company,"
he said. "We think we make the person less
effective if they adapt to the company."
For this reason, employees are allowed to
come to work whenever they want, wear
shorts or other seemingly inappropriate
attire to the office, and even work at home if
that is what they want to do. For a corpora
tion of Oracle's size, that seems like an un
usual step, but Lynn says it works.
"What we pay for and like are results, and
we seem to get them," he said.
