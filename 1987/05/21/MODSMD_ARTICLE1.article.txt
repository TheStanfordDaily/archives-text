BERKELEY — Startling fossil bones discovered
last summer in East Africa indicate that man's ear
liest direct ancestor was a stout, long-armed creature
unexpectedly closer in appearance to apes than to
modern humans. Anthropology Prof. Donald Johan
son announced yesterday.
This conclusion, based on analysis of a partial
skeleton found by a team of scientists led by Johan
son, is the latest addition to a slowly emerging un
derstanding of the human evolutionary tree. The
1.8-million-year-old fossils suggest to scientists that
man evolved from an apelike ancestor who
sometimes climbed trees to a strictly terrestrial,
anatomically modern human over a surprisingly
recent and brief 200,000-year period.
Before last summers discovery, paleo
anthropologists had assumed that this earliest of
man's ancestors. Homo habilis, was a much taller,
more humanlike creature with shorter arms than
the new fossils indicate. They believed the jump from
an apelike to a humanlike ancestor had occurred
much earlier in human evolution. The assumption
was based entirely on analysis of previously discov
ered Homo habilis skull fragments, the only Homo
habilis bones found before last year.
Last summer's discovery, which included frag
ments of arm and leg bones along with pieces of skull
and a nearly complete upper jaw, gave* scientists
their first look at other parts of Homo habilis's
anatomy, and they were shocked by the primitive an
cestor they saw.
"It's a stunning new discovery into what our ear
liest ancestor looked like," Johanson said yesterday
at a press conference that coincided with the publi-

cation of the conclusions In the
English journal "Nature." "It was
one of the most compelling and
challenging three-dimensional
puzzles any of us have ever been
Involved In."
The conclusion that the human
genus evolved from Homo habilis
to Its modern successor. Homo
erectus. in such a relatively short
period of time — between 1.8 and
1.6 million years ago — suggests
that human ancestors underwent
a major behavioral change in that
period, said Johanson, director of
the private Institute for Human
Origins In Berkeley.
Johanson and UC-Berkeley An
thropology Prof. Tim White, an
other senior researcher on last
summer's expedition, said they do
not yet have enough fossil
evidence to determine exactly
what the behavioral shift con
sisted of and how such abrupt
evolution came about.
But White said the discovery is
an important step In arriving at

an understanding of behavior be
cause it tells scientists at what
point in human history they
should look for more clues about
the transition from primitive,
apelike Homo habilis to modern,
human-appearing Homo erectus.
"The bones allow us to focus our
efforts on 1.6 and 1.8." White
said.
The fossils, discovered at Ol
duval Gorge In northern Tan
zania. Indicate that the Individual
was a fully bipedal, 30-year-old
female about three-and-a-half-feet
tall, the scientists said. They said
Homo habilis males were probably
somewhat larger.
The most surprising aspect of
Homo habilis that scientists dis
cerned from the discovery was the
great length of the arms — a trait
pronounced in apes. By compar
ing the length of the upper arm
bone with the length of the thigh
bone, scientists placed the
anatomy of Homo habilis limbs
closer to those of apes than
humans.
In humans, the upper arm Is
about 75 percent of the length of
the thigh bone, and in chimpan
zees. the two bones are of equal

length. The Homo habilis bones
revealed that its upper arm bones
were about 95 percent of the
length of the thighs.
Long arms appear to have been
an evolutionary advantage to
Homo habilis, Johanson and
White said. Although It is clear the
species was fully bipedal, they
said, Its long arms might have
allowed It to climb occasionally
into trees to avoid predators, to
reach food and to sleep safely.
Johanson said the new evidence
about the limb anatomy and the
slight stature of Homo habilis
adds new insight into the path of
human evolution — what charac
teristics human ancestors
developed when.
Fossils of an earlier human an
cestor, Australopithecus afar
ensis, discovered by Johanson in
1972, showed scientists that
human ancestors may have begun
walking upright about four mil
lion years ago. These fossils and
Homo habilis discoveries from Ol
duval Gorge and other African
sites indicate that human ances
tors began developing larger
brains between three million and
two million years ago.

The discovery announced yes
terday suggests that ancestors
retained relatively primitive limb
structures while brain expansion
was taking place. The skeletal
structure "caught up" with brain
development in the 200.000-year
period of rapid evolutionary
change between Homo habilis and
Homo erectus, whose limb
structure was very close to
modern man's. Johanson said.
Many anthropologists think
that Homo habilis' use of
rudimentary stone tools allowed It
to outcompete two cousin species
that became extinct about one
million years ago and eventually
evolve Into Homo erectus about
1.6 million years ago. The more
manlike Homo erectus developed a
new, more advanced stone "tool
kit" that helped It flourish and ex
pand out of Africa, Johanson said.
White said he found the first
piece of the partial skeleton on the
third day of the expedition's sur
vey of Olduval Gorge. Johanson
then immediately noticed another
bone lying on the ground nearby,
and then an Ethiopian graduate
student on the expedition found a
third fragment.
