BERKELEY â€” Startling fossil bones discovered
last summer in East Africa indicate that man's ear
liest direct ancestor was a stout, long-armed creature
unexpectedly closer in appearance to apes than to
modern humans. Anthropology Prof. Donald Johan
son announced yesterday.
This conclusion, based on analysis of a partial
skeleton found by a team of scientists led by Johan
son, is the latest addition to a slowly emerging un
derstanding of the human evolutionary tree. The
1.8-million-year-old fossils suggest to scientists that
man evolved from an apelike ancestor who
sometimes climbed trees to a strictly terrestrial,
anatomically modern human over a surprisingly
recent and brief 200,000-year period.
Before last summers discovery, paleo
anthropologists had assumed that this earliest of
man's ancestors. Homo habilis, was a much taller,
more humanlike creature with shorter arms than
the new fossils indicate. They believed the jump from
an apelike to a humanlike ancestor had occurred
much earlier in human evolution. The assumption
was based entirely on analysis of previously discov
ered Homo habilis skull fragments, the only Homo
habilis bones found before last year.
Last summer's discovery, which included frag
ments of arm and leg bones along with pieces of skull
and a nearly complete upper jaw, gave* scientists
their first look at other parts of Homo habilis's
anatomy, and they were shocked by the primitive an
cestor they saw.
"It's a stunning new discovery into what our ear
liest ancestor looked like," Johanson said yesterday
at a press conference that coincided with the publi-


Anthropology Prof. Donald Johanson demonstrates the position he believes a
recently discovered fossil bone occupied in the body of an ancient human ances
tor.
