Zero-sum view
is detrimental
As Richard Banks' recent view
point (Daily. May 13) states, the
Area One debate is indeed over
larger issues than simply the
content and focus of the Area One
requirement. In fact, many of
these issues are political by na
ture and, perhaps as such, have
not yet been addressed in any
public forum.
Nevertheless, Banks" descrip
tion of the Area One debate as a
struggle for personal, cultural
and historical self-determination
is one of the first and most cogent
public expressions illuminating
one of the more subtle and per
haps most fundamental socio
cultural issues behind the cur
rent intellectual debate over the
objectives and composition of the
Area One requirement.
However, describing the debate
as if it were a game in which one
side's gain was necessarily the
other's loss, 1 believe, is probably
the most detrimental and cer
tainly the most erroneous charac
terization of the Area One debate
voiced to date.
If one misunderstands this
debate as a zero-sum game, then
it seems to me one has missed
entirely the most important point
made by those who have for so
long labored for change: If the
requirement changes, we all win
— proponents and opponents of
change alike — regardless of
color, ethnicity or ideological
persuasion.
We all win because only once
change has begun can we begin
to move down the learning curve
together toward a richer under
standing of ourselves and a
greater appreciation of each
other, and move together toward
a more truly liberal education.
Moreover, Banks describes the
debate as if two distinct and
diametrically opposed color
coated camps exist. This does
injustice to those on both sides of
the issue who have tried to carry
out this dialogue in rational —
rather than in racial — terms.

Such characterizations unfairly
and incorrectly label one side as
righteous, the other side as
racist; one as moral, the other
immoral. Such characterizations
are exactly what has forced much
needed meaningful dialogue to
degenerate into meaningless
diatribe.
Unfortunately, it is exactly
because this has been the tone of
the debate — or at least the tone
most commonly heard on these
pages — that many of those who
have been opposed to change
have become increasingly ter
ritorial and defensive about their
positions.
The belief that this is a zero
sum game in which each group
struggles against the other, in
stead of for the whole, is probably
the single greatest force retarding
the evolution of the Area One
requirement.

University is

Professor John McCarthy's
recent letter regarding SDI re
search on campus (Daily, May 18)
did manage to raise a valuable
point in the midst of its knee-jerk
frothing at the mouth ("the mob
rule of the 1960s") and truly
McCarthy-esque insinuations
("academic freedom might even
cover doing something with
which STAND members disagree
— such as helping defend the
United States"). McCarthy inad
vertently raises the question of
whether classified research is
appropriate on a university
campus.
In my view, classified research
should be conducted by private
defense contractors, not by uni
versity professors. As University
President Donald Kennedy em
phasized during Cornerstone
weekend, teaching and research
at Stanford mutually reinforce
each other "in the cause of learn
ing."

But to the extent that research
is classified, it cannot be openly
shared with other members of the
Stanford community and im
poverishes rather than enriches
the University as a whole.
STAND'S brochure correctly
points out that research on
highly sensitive defense matters
such as SDI may become classi
fied retroactively, even if the con
tract was labeled unclassified at
the time the contract was
awarded.
There are many strong argu
ments against SDI, and STAND'S
brochure raises a number of
them quite articulately.
McCarthy's violent reaction to
this eminently civil brochure may
say more about him than it does
about the content of the bro
chure.

Dump Westin
I have learned that the Univer
sity has been negotiating with
Westin Hotels to build a facility
on campus. I have also learned
that Westin manages a hotel in
Johannesburg, and that the com
pany reports the facility there to
be "fully integrated" in terms of
its staffing and hotel guests.
The company has not stated
whether it is in compliance with
the Sullivan Principles, but these
guidelines are becoming increas
ingly a meaningless criterion. It is
also becoming clearer that corpor
ate withdrawal is in order.
Stanford should not in anyway
add to the profit of a company
operating in South Africa;
indeed, such companies —
through the payment of taxes —
only serve to provide financial
support for a genocidal govern
ment.
I urge Stanford to discontinue
discussions with this company
and seek another, like Dunfey,
which has vowed not to conduct
business in South Africa under
its present form of government.

other's loss, 1 believe, is probably
the most detrimental and cer
tainly the most erroneous charac
terization of the Area One debate
voiced to date.
If one misunderstands this
debate as a zero-sum game, then
it seems to me one has missed
entirely the most important point
made by those who have for so
long labored for change: If the
requirement changes, we all win
— proponents and opponents of
change alike — regardless of
color, ethnicity or ideological
persuasion.
We all win because only once
change has begun can we begin
to move down the learning curve
together toward a richer under
standing of ourselves and a
greater appreciation of each
other, and move together toward
a more truly liberal education.
Moreover, Banks describes the
debate as if two distinct and
diametrically opposed color
coated camps exist. This does
injustice to those on both sides of
the issue who have tried to carry
out this dialogue in rational —
rather than in racial — terms.

Such characterizations unfairly
and incorrectly label one side as
righteous, the other side as
racist; one as moral, the other
immoral. Such characterizations
are exactly what has forced much
needed meaningful dialogue to
degenerate into meaningless
diatribe.
Unfortunately, it is exactly
because this has been the tone of
the debate — or at least the tone
most commonly heard on these
pages — that many of those who
have been opposed to change
have become increasingly ter
ritorial and defensive about their
positions.
The belief that this is a zero
sum game in which each group
struggles against the other, in
stead of for the whole, is probably
the single greatest force retarding
the evolution of the Area One
requirement.

University is
not the place
Professor John McCarthy's
recent letter regarding SDI re
search on campus (Daily, May 18)
did manage to raise a valuable
point in the midst of its knee-jerk
frothing at the mouth ("the mob
rule of the 1960s") and truly
McCarthy-esque insinuations
("academic freedom might even
cover doing something with
which STAND members disagree
— such as helping defend the
United States"). McCarthy inad
vertently raises the question of
whether classified research is
appropriate on a university
campus.
In my view, classified research
should be conducted by private
defense contractors, not by uni
versity professors. As University
President Donald Kennedy em
phasized during Cornerstone
weekend, teaching and research
at Stanford mutually reinforce
each other "in the cause of learn
ing."

But to the extent that research
is classified, it cannot be openly
shared with other members of the
Stanford community and im
poverishes rather than enriches
the University as a whole.
STAND'S brochure correctly
points out that research on
highly sensitive defense matters
such as SDI may become classi
fied retroactively, even if the con
tract was labeled unclassified at
the time the contract was
awarded.
There are many strong argu
ments against SDI, and STAND'S
brochure raises a number of
them quite articulately.
McCarthy's violent reaction to
this eminently civil brochure may
say more about him than it does
about the content of the bro
chure.

Dump Westin
I have learned that the Univer
sity has been negotiating with
Westin Hotels to build a facility
on campus. I have also learned
that Westin manages a hotel in
Johannesburg, and that the com
pany reports the facility there to
be "fully integrated" in terms of
its staffing and hotel guests.
The company has not stated
whether it is in compliance with
the Sullivan Principles, but these
guidelines are becoming increas
ingly a meaningless criterion. It is
also becoming clearer that corpor
ate withdrawal is in order.
Stanford should not in anyway
add to the profit of a company
operating in South Africa;
indeed, such companies —
through the payment of taxes —
only serve to provide financial
support for a genocidal govern
ment.
I urge Stanford to discontinue
discussions with this company
and seek another, like Dunfey,
which has vowed not to conduct
business in South Africa under
its present form of government.
