# Everyone should look at racism
## 
### 
Ugo Colella and Brian Walser's recent view
point on re-examining racism (Daily, April 29)
brings forth some important issues. It makes a
statement about the injustice that can occur
if. in some situations, one hastily puts the
blame on racism without first considering
other possible motivating factors. While we
agree with this basic contention, there are
several flaws in their argument to which we
would like to call attention.

LARIOS, et al.

The authors imply that either an incident is
blatantly racist or it is not racist at all. They
fail to consider that, in any situation, racism
can exist in varying degrees and forms.
Subtle, institutional or unconscious racism
is the most difficult to detect and the hardest
to rule out in any given situation. How does
one "accurately verify" that racism is not a
motive? Understandably, racial bias is not a
motivating factor in every situation, but it is
very difficult to reach this conclusion, given
the examples cited by the authors in their arti
cle. This weakness is most strongly illustrated
in their discussion of the Western Culture con
troversy.
The "facts" that Colella and Walser bring
forth in this example are. to say the least,
questionable. They conclude that all those
supporting curricular changes to the Western
Culture series are scrambling "to fix some
thing that just isn't broken." We are not con
vinced that the Area One requirement isn't
broken.

In an effort to defend the current Western
Culture series against "premature charges of
racism." these authors assert that the profes
sors in the current system are "making a
valiant effort to stimulate discussion of
feminism and minority issues." In the next
breath, they inform us that the faculty here
have been trained to lecture on philosophy,
history or literature but not on minority is
sues.
Colella and Walser appear to separate
minority issues from philosophy, history and
literature as if minority cultures have none of
these things. They state that the University
does not have the faculty available to offer a re
quired yearlong series of "cultural anthropol
ogy" classes, implying that cultural anthropol
ogy is the only discipline that encompasses the
study of minority cultures.
On the contrary, minority cultures do have
their own histories, philosophies and
literatures that are worthy of our study and
recognition. Moreover, ignorance of the his
tory and accomplishments of women and
minorities leads to the persistence of negative
stereotypes about them, which is another form
of racism.
The authors go on to say that the current
Western Culture series is not consciously dls
criminating'against the works of women and
minorities â€” it's Just that there are not
enough "major works of art or literature"
produced by them in the period covered by the
series.
As A.R.C. Finch points out in her recent let
ter (Campus Report. May 6) the problem with
this viewpoint is that it ignores the fact that
members of an elite segment of our society,
namely white dominant males, have hlstorl

cally shaped our ideas and defined for us what
works are "major" by what they have chosen to
study, teach and publish.
In addition. Aaron Jackson's letter (Daily.
May 5) gave examples of the extensive collec
tion of works describing Afro-American. Carib
bean and African experiences as early as the
1500s. How many more must exist? The intel
lectual naivete displayed by the authors when
addressing these issues clearly demonstrates
the need for an alternative Western Culture
education here at Stanford.
Finally, we would like to call attention to the
fact that each of the examples cited by the
Colella and Walser is an illustration of how
members of non-majority groups (i.e.. Jews,
Hispanlcs, Stanford minority students)
jumped at tagging specific incidents as racist
before considering other motives.
We would like to point out that both minority
and majority persons engage in this behavior.
While some minority students may mistakenly
label a situation as racist, some majority stu
dents are equally quick to claim "reverse dis
crimination" in certain instances.
There are majority persons who, without
"considering all the angles," automatically at
tribute a minority person's career and aca
demic success to his or her ethnicity (e.g.,
being admitted to a university or receiving a
Job promotion).
While it is encouraging to see that these is
sues can be discussed openly at Stanford, let
us be aware that as majority and minority per
sons, we all need to re-examine racism.

Escoto Saldivar are second-year medical stu
dents.
