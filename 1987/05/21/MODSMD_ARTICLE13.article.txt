# A 						few lessons learned

If Residential Education is correct when it says
that the best education occurs outside of the class
room, then it is incumbent upon me to pass along
some of the lessons I have gleaned from between the
lines of formal undergraduate instruction here at
Stanford University.

To begin with, I have discovered the old Christian
hymn to be true. There are some crosses that are dif
ficult to bear. There are some valleys that are too low
and too wide to cross. And there are some mountains
— and some hills — that are too high and too steep to
climb.
Especially the hill behind the parking lot at
Lambda Nu; especially at two in the morning; and es
pecially after having consumed several "water
melons" at a watering hole in Mountain View that
rhymes with "Wiggles!"
Anyway, it took the assiduous, against-all-odds ef
forts of Res Ed's Diana Conklin to remind me of this
very important Christian metaphor. For that, I
thank her.
Lesson number two: Don't ever let anyone tell you
that Garfield's is just another place to dance — not
even if the person who tells this to you is named
Mike, and he swears he's heard good things about
the joint, and he knows all the words to the
"Underdog" theme song.
If you choose to ignore the obvious warnings — a
rumored death on the premises being a very fine ex
ample — then don't be overwhelmed when a swarthy,
middle-aged man with a wide, toothy grin tries to
convince you to stay. Leave! Never mind that you may
feel a tug of pathos for the detached stage dancer
who struts around the dimly lit. smoke-filled room
while the trenchcoated men scattered throughout
the place wave their money at her. (A slanted charac
terization, I'll admit; I don't want to offend any of
Garfield's regular patrons.)
It was my good friend, Bill, who warned us about
the murder — death, suicide or whatever it was — at
Garfield's. We should have listened to Bill because he
happens to be the smartest guy in the world. He
taught me everything I know about Aristotle.
Bill is a walking, talking, breathing paradox. He's
an electrical engineering master's candidate and a
pre-med. and he's a connoisseur of poetry and"The
Addams Family" reruns. He's the only person I know
who'd stay up all night with me to debate my
sometimes preposterous resolutions. Most impor
tant, Bill reminded me that it's OK (and probably

healthy) to be corny sometimes, as this paragraph
turned out to be.
Contrary to popular belief, house-sitting last sum
mer (even If only for a few days) was not an easy,
problem-free, stress-free job. And besides, why the
hell can't the police help you when you need them?
And where are the damn neighbors with the damn
(spare) key! I learned the answers to these questions
and many more from Anne.
There may very well be a drink called a "blowjob."
But one thing I am sure of these days Is If you're
going to ask someone if they've had this drink before,
then you have to phrase the question just right. I
guess you had to be there. Anyway, I learned that
from Magda.
Our drinking habits? Some of us drank to excess.
Some of us weren't always sure when the party was
over. But only two of us managed to do "slammers"
with gin — cheap gin — when all the vodka and
Sprite had run out during one eventful party on an
otherwise uneventful night.
The next, morning I understood why the gin didn't
fizz. I learned this fascinating point from Sarah. May
I never see another bottle of gin as long as I live.
And then there are the many times when I've been
reminded that I don't really know all the answers,
and that it's OK to admit to It. Darcy proved this one
salient fact the night she posed a particularly unset
tling question. She's the only person I know who ac
tually likes straight vodka, and this might have had
something to do with her concerns that night. I
simply told her there was probably a very good reason
why the 6-foot blow-up Godzilla doll (the one that
used to reside In Mike's living room) didn't come,
ahem, equipped. My friend Aaron, however, had an
interesting remedy for this not-so-minor detail.
It was Larry who pointed out the inherent beauty
of the American electoral process. It was that sense of
stability in the midst of disarray that he found most
appealing. Larry has that lyrical, elocutionary style to
his discourse In the best tradition of Jesse Jackson.
Incidentally, I learned "elocutionary" and "discourse"
from his oh-so-impresslve vocabulary. Now I under
stand why " 'chicks' really dig him."
And finally (not "finally" as if to imply that this
concludes my out-of-class learning experiences, but
"finally"in the sense that this is the last one I will
cite in this column, for perfectly good and perfectly
true reasons having to do with a rapidly approaching
deadline), even though we sometimes forget, life has
many more ups than downs. Life is, in fact, one giant
party — even if you are in medical school. I learned
that, of course, from Clay.
(I changed the names of the aforementioned
friends to protect their privacy. But even if I did use
their real names, it's OK because I made it all up.
Huh?)
