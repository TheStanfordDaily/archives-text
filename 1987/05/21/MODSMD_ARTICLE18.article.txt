## Golden celebration marks bridge’s 50th 
### CHRIS MYERS Editorial staff 
For most members of the Stan
ford community, last week's
celebration of the centennial of
the laying of the University's cor
nerstone probably provided
enough pomp and circumstance
to last them a while — at least un
til the University's real 100 th
birthday in 1991.
But for those who are still
itching for a bit more revelry and
who don't mind getting up at an
ungodly hour of the morning, this
weekend's golden anniversary of
the Golden Gate Bridge awaits.
On May 27, 1937, at 6 a.m., the
Golden Gate Bridge was opened
for Pedestrian Day. (with the span
due to open to auto traffic the next
day). By the time Pedestrian day
was over. 12 hours later, over
200,000 citizens — or about 200
people per minute — had made
the walk between Marin and Fort
Point on the San Francisco side,
according to author Stephen Cas
sady in his book, "Spanning the
Gate."
This Sunday, in celebration of
the bridge's 50th birthday, well
wishers and interested citizens
are invited to retrace the steps of
those first bridge-crossers. The
bridge will be closed to vehicular

traffic from 4:45 until 9:30 a.m. —
the first time it has closed since
1937. The festivities will begin at
6 a.m. with a 15-minute cere
mony. and the bridge will then be
open to pedestrians and bicyclists
from 6:15 to 8, with high school
marching bands and a 50-gun sa
luie to entertain walkers.
Bridge officials said yesterday
they expect more than 50.000
people — perhaps even 100,000 —
to cross the bridge on Sunday.
The celebration will continue at
9:30 with the "Cavalcade of Cars."
during which approximately 100
antique automobiles will cross the
bridge to Marin and back.
That will be followed by the
"Golden Regatta." a parade of over
300 yachts.
For those who prefer to spend
their Sunday morning in bed, but
who still want to take part in the
celebration, there are numerous
events in the afternoons and
evenings.
The official kickoff bash is to
morrow night from 8 p.m. to 1
a.m. at the Giftcenter (Bth and
Brannan streets). A benefit for the
Friends of the Golden Gate Bridge,
the evening will feature the music
of the Harry James Orchestra and
appearances by numerous
celebrities, including Tony Ben
nett, Jerry "The Beaver" Mathers.

June Lockhart and James
"Scotty" Doohan. Tickets for the
gala are $35; call 397-7655 for in
formation.
At 2 p.m. on Sunday all eyes will
turn skyward for "Wings of Gold,"
an air show beginning with a
flyover by 143 aircraft from the
1930s and '40s. At the same time,
four old-fashioned daredevil air
shows will take place over the
Marin Headlands, Crissy Field.

Pier 39 and the Berkeley Marina.
From 1 to 5 p.m., there will be
entertainment at six different
locations throughout the City, in
cluding Aquatic Park, the Great
Meadow at Upper Fort Mason, the
Marina Green and Fort Point un
der the southern end of the
bridge.
The biggest party will be at
Crissy Field, showcasing San
Francisco-area talent and military

pageantry. In the evening, the San
Francisco Symphony and Tony
Bennett will perform before the 9
p.m. bridge lighting.
All the celebration only befits
what is surely one of the greatest
achievements of engineering in
the world. The second-longest
suspension bridge in North
America, the Golden Gate
measures 4,200 feet from tower to
tower. The towers rise 746 feet

above the waterline. Each of the
cables that connect the towers
and hold up the roadway Is 7,650
feet in length. 36 inches in
diameter and weighs 7,125 tons.
Construction of the bridge
began on January 5. 1933, fully
17 years after the idea for the
bridge was raised in earnest by
San Francisco Bulletin writer
