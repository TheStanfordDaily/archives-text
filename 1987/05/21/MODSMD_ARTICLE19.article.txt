## KZSU picks 
### 
Hey. thanks for all the entries in
the "You Can Write Zoo Picks"
contest. They were all totally killer
and we'll get back to you real soon.
For those of you who are dying to
see their work, hang in there! We'll
get em to do a column by the end
of this year, unless we don't, in
which case, we won't.
Ratings this week are in people
with four-letter names sure to
bring about the fall of civilization.
Chris Isaak
"Chris Isaak"
Bush, Bush. Bush
In the age of formula pop, San
Francisco's own Chris Isaak Is a
standout as an uncompromising
musician pouring out a '50s-style
rock that mixes Roy Orbison and
Elvis Presley. His first major-label
LP. "Silvertone," was loved by the
critics and a few of the songs
ended up on the "Blue Velvet"
soundtrack, but it wouldn't be un
til this. Isaak's second album, that
he would receive airplay all over
the nation — the first single, a
remake of the Yardbirds' "Heart
Full of Soul," seems destined to
break into Billboard charts all over
the place.
Isaak's sound on the new album
is consistent with the previous
one, maintaining his minor key
blues with the eerie background,
the slightly twangy guitar, and
best of all, his smooth, Elvisesque
voice. The only disappointment on
"Silvertone" was its tendency to
all-run-together-and-all-sound
the-same, but songs like "Funeral
in the Rain" and "Gone Ridin' "
drove things a little harder and
started pushing Isaak's voice.
That disappointment carries over
into this album. More than ever,
his songs sound the same and
where he came close to packing
some emotional fervor into a few
songs before, he fails to push that
emotion any further here, al
though his songs set him up per
fectly for a good, raspy, gutteral
vocal-chord rip. If only he would
do a version of the Doors'
"Roadhouse Blues."
His songs are lyrically nice. He's
a romantic trying to sing romantic
songs about the sort of love that
only existed in the '50's, despite
people trying to recreate it in the
'80 s (no wonder David Lynch

wanted his music for "Blue Vel
vet"), but even then the lyrics are
not that compelling, just nice.
Like the music, the songs are
about the same things in general
— nice love. Gimme a break.
Still, he can capture a melody
and his haunting voice is truly
enchanting. Let's hope his next al
bum can take a few risks.

Wall of Voodoo
"Happy Planet"
Suzanne Vega
"Solitude Standing"
Wall of Voodoo: Fawn. Fawn
Suzanne Vega: Hall, Hall, Hall
Well, it's spring, and it's time to
break out the old Rolling Stone
Memorial Two Records in One
Review Trick. 'Course, we have to
have some kind of theme to justify
doing this, so we've gotta come up
with one. Well, let's see — I wasn't
particularly excited to review
either one of these records, but
that's kind of a dull category.
Hmm — draw a comparison be
tween the two bands, how one
band is sort of one way, and the
other is the other. Gee, that seems
so cliched. Hey! That's it! Cliches!
That's what these bands have in
common! Not so much musically,
now — it's just that they have
jumped on the Bandwagon of
Death where they think their
songs are bitchin' poetry set to
music. Well, whatever poetry is,
this isn't it.
Wall of Voodoo was already in
big trouble. They lost Stan
Ridgway, their warbly storyteller
on Wall classix like "Mexican
Radio" and "Ring of Fire" two al
bums ago. In fact, there's only two
guys left over from the band's
heydayish "Call of the West" al
bum. Their last record was awful.
There's not much to look forward
to.
But to be fair to the guys, they
seem to be trying. While their
erstwhile release featured a pic of
the band all dressed out in
spooky-lookin' threads and spiky

haircuts, this record has only
small pix of scariness and a funny
cover pic of the band dressed dap
perly in matching suits, a la Devo.
And when I first listened. I
thought they were trying to be
Devo. 1 thought that they were
Devo. But then I realized I was lis
tening to the wrong record by acci
dent. Oops. Instead, WOV's sound
has changed now to one of ram
bling (here's the theme, kids!)
poetry backed up by strange
synthsounds, twangy guitars and
the bandspeople's never-ending
odyssey to try to imitate Stan

Ridgway. Well, we know that the
band knows and that you know
that no one can ever be Stan 'cept
Stan. I don't think they're trying
to do it — it's some weird uncon
scious psychological thing. I
think. Anyway, even if they
weren't being Stan, and even if the
music wasn't so incredibly worth
lessly typical of anybody, their

poetry is really terribly awfully
bad. It's all about L.A. and Brian
Wilson (oh. and their cover of Wil
son and Mike Love's Beach Boy
classic "Do it Again" is lousy, too.)
and I think freeways and the
beach and definitely and predic
tably spurned love. It all sort of
mushes along until it sort of
whimpers out.
Speaking of mush and
whimper, Suzanne Vega's new
record breaks new ground in the
field of Mush and Whimper Engi
neering and Applied Science. Well,
first, let's talk about Suz's gim-

mick. See. she's never herself
when she sings. She's someone
else. She's this nine-year old boy
who gets beaten by his parents, or
she's Calypso. And she's always in
her songs. Not being someone
else, but being herself as seen by
someone else, whose voice she
(the real Suzanne) uses when she
sings, even though it's not really

her. Actually, sometimes she is
someone else describing someone
else that is also Suzanne, but that
complicates the issue. Suffice to
say that Suzanne is trying to be
pretty far-out. Maybe she really is.
It's pretty nifty. I guess. But
anyways, she delivers all her stuff
in her breathy, high-pitched
talk/sing which is accompanied
by acoustic guitar, and maybe
some drums and every now and
then some other instruments.
To be sure. Vega has got lots
more interesting things to talk
about than Voodoo does. And you
can bleep over the sillier lines. But
it's that she sings it all the same
way — and while it's refreshing in
this world of crunchrock new
wave nugget after cloned
crunchrock new wave nugget to
hear some new wave folkrock, you
don't necessarily wanna hear a
whole solid hour of the stuff. And
you can't even vary it by playing it
at 45, because Vega's voice sounds
mysteriously the same at any
speed. I don't understand it
either. And nothing rhymes. Ever.
Moral of the review: If you must
be a rock star, don't be a poet too.
P.S. I know that rhyming can
sound pretty cheap, but rhyme
once in a while, and we won't go to
sleep!

Hoodoo Gurus
"Blow Your Cool"
Donna Rice, Donna Rice, Donna
Rice (and a one-way ticket to com
mercial airplay)
"Hoodoo Gurus." Nine out of 10
Americans surveyed think it's a
new breakfast cereal for kids —
the kind that comes in 14 un
natural colors, includes a free
space robot toy to annoy the fam
ily pets and turns your milk a dis
gusting color. The 10th either lis
tens to college radio or has noticed
the Gurus' new presence on the
commercial airwaves. Yes, this is
yet another band at the awkward
stage of development, musical pu

berty for those semi-obscure
musicians who have conquered
the college airwaves and yearn for
more.
Actually, this band should have
been on commercial radio from
the day its first album arrived
from their native Australia. The
band hit the United States with a
straightforward rock n' roll sound
— no synthesizers, no whispered
lyrics — and a loud, fun, loud,
loud tour. These guys were having
fun making music. Quite
naturally, they lost their major
label contract soon thereafter,
only to sign with yet another
major soon after their second ef
fort was released.
As usual, it was the sort of
record that gives promoters fits.
College response was overwhelm
ing, but commercial airplay
outside California was non
existent. So the band's third al
bum, "Blow Your Cool." gave it a
chance to determine its fate: to
remain a college phenom or to risk
all and attempt to slug it out with
McDonna and the Purple One. The
choice was to do a little of each.
The result is rather uninspired.
Whereas in the past the band has
been known for its catchy tunes,
air guitar-inducing chord progres
sions and generally unabashed
Aussie rock 'n' roll approach to
music, the new album. . . . Well,
to be quite honest, I can't remem
ber much about the new album,
even after repeated listening.
Sure, the approach and sound
are familiar: big drums, a few
lines about unrequited love, a
guitar solo of sorts, and then end
less repetition of the song's title,
so that the listener will remember
and buy. The first single, "Good
Times," is a prime example of this.
I know the Bangles sing back up. 1
know I've heard the song about a
jillion times, but I can't tell you
anything about it. Apparently
thud-rocking is all but out for this
band, which is too bad, because
that was their forte. Vestiges do
remain — "Hell for Leather" and
"Middle of the Road" will recon
firm the faith of the true Hoodoo
Gurus fans; the chord progres
sions are there, and the fun atti
tude shines through. But the rest
of the album ... I just can't re
member.

thud-rocking is all but out for this

that was their forte. Vestiges do

Hey. thanks for all the entries in
the "You Can Write Zoo Picks"
contest. They were all totally killer
and we'll get back to you real soon.
For those of you who are dying to
see their work, hang in there! We'll
get em to do a column by the end
of this year, unless we don't, in
which case, we won't.
Ratings this week are in people
with four-letter names sure to
bring about the fall of civilization.
Chris Isaak
"Chris Isaak"
Bush, Bush. Bush
In the age of formula pop, San
Francisco's own Chris Isaak Is a
standout as an uncompromising
musician pouring out a '50s-style
rock that mixes Roy Orbison and
Elvis Presley. His first major-label
LP. "Silvertone," was loved by the
critics and a few of the songs
ended up on the "Blue Velvet"
soundtrack, but it wouldn't be un
til this. Isaak's second album, that
he would receive airplay all over
the nation — the first single, a
remake of the Yardbirds' "Heart
Full of Soul," seems destined to
break into Billboard charts all over
the place.
Isaak's sound on the new album
is consistent with the previous
one, maintaining his minor key
blues with the eerie background,
the slightly twangy guitar, and
best of all, his smooth, Elvisesque
voice. The only disappointment on
"Silvertone" was its tendency to
all-run-together-and-all-sound
the-same, but songs like "Funeral
in the Rain" and "Gone Ridin' "
drove things a little harder and
started pushing Isaak's voice.
That disappointment carries over
into this album. More than ever,
his songs sound the same and
where he came close to packing
some emotional fervor into a few
songs before, he fails to push that
emotion any further here, al
though his songs set him up per
fectly for a good, raspy, gutteral
vocal-chord rip. If only he would
do a version of the Doors'
"Roadhouse Blues."
His songs are lyrically nice. He's
a romantic trying to sing romantic
songs about the sort of love that
only existed in the '50's, despite
people trying to recreate it in the
'80 s (no wonder David Lynch

wanted his music for "Blue Vel
vet"), but even then the lyrics are
not that compelling, just nice.
Like the music, the songs are
about the same things in general
— nice love. Gimme a break.
Still, he can capture a melody
and his haunting voice is truly
enchanting. Let's hope his next al
bum can take a few risks.

Wall of Voodoo
"Happy Planet"
Suzanne Vega
"Solitude Standing"
Wall of Voodoo: Fawn. Fawn
Suzanne Vega: Hall, Hall, Hall
Well, it's spring, and it's time to
break out the old Rolling Stone
Memorial Two Records in One
Review Trick. 'Course, we have to
have some kind of theme to justify
doing this, so we've gotta come up
with one. Well, let's see — I wasn't
particularly excited to review
either one of these records, but
that's kind of a dull category.
Hmm — draw a comparison be
tween the two bands, how one
band is sort of one way, and the
other is the other. Gee, that seems
so cliched. Hey! That's it! Cliches!
That's what these bands have in
common! Not so much musically,
now — it's just that they have
jumped on the Bandwagon of
Death where they think their
songs are bitchin' poetry set to
music. Well, whatever poetry is,
this isn't it.
Wall of Voodoo was already in
big trouble. They lost Stan
Ridgway, their warbly storyteller
on Wall classix like "Mexican
Radio" and "Ring of Fire" two al
bums ago. In fact, there's only two
guys left over from the band's
heydayish "Call of the West" al
bum. Their last record was awful.
There's not much to look forward
to.
But to be fair to the guys, they
seem to be trying. While their
erstwhile release featured a pic of
the band all dressed out in
spooky-lookin' threads and spiky

haircuts, this record has only
small pix of scariness and a funny
cover pic of the band dressed dap
perly in matching suits, a la Devo.
And when I first listened. I
thought they were trying to be
Devo. 1 thought that they were
Devo. But then I realized I was lis
tening to the wrong record by acci
dent. Oops. Instead, WOV's sound
has changed now to one of ram
bling (here's the theme, kids!)
poetry backed up by strange
synthsounds, twangy guitars and
the bandspeople's never-ending
odyssey to try to imitate Stan

Ridgway. Well, we know that the
band knows and that you know
that no one can ever be Stan 'cept
Stan. I don't think they're trying
to do it — it's some weird uncon
scious psychological thing. I
think. Anyway, even if they
weren't being Stan, and even if the
music wasn't so incredibly worth
lessly typical of anybody, their

poetry is really terribly awfully
bad. It's all about L.A. and Brian
Wilson (oh. and their cover of Wil
son and Mike Love's Beach Boy
classic "Do it Again" is lousy, too.)
and I think freeways and the
beach and definitely and predic
tably spurned love. It all sort of
mushes along until it sort of
whimpers out.
Speaking of mush and
whimper, Suzanne Vega's new
record breaks new ground in the
field of Mush and Whimper Engi
neering and Applied Science. Well,
first, let's talk about Suz's gim-

mick. See. she's never herself
when she sings. She's someone
else. She's this nine-year old boy
who gets beaten by his parents, or
she's Calypso. And she's always in
her songs. Not being someone
else, but being herself as seen by
someone else, whose voice she
(the real Suzanne) uses when she
sings, even though it's not really

her. Actually, sometimes she is
someone else describing someone
else that is also Suzanne, but that
complicates the issue. Suffice to
say that Suzanne is trying to be
pretty far-out. Maybe she really is.
It's pretty nifty. I guess. But
anyways, she delivers all her stuff
in her breathy, high-pitched
talk/sing which is accompanied
by acoustic guitar, and maybe
some drums and every now and
then some other instruments.
To be sure. Vega has got lots
more interesting things to talk
about than Voodoo does. And you
can bleep over the sillier lines. But
it's that she sings it all the same
way — and while it's refreshing in
this world of crunchrock new
wave nugget after cloned
crunchrock new wave nugget to
hear some new wave folkrock, you
don't necessarily wanna hear a
whole solid hour of the stuff. And
you can't even vary it by playing it
at 45, because Vega's voice sounds
mysteriously the same at any
speed. I don't understand it
either. And nothing rhymes. Ever.
Moral of the review: If you must
be a rock star, don't be a poet too.
P.S. I know that rhyming can
sound pretty cheap, but rhyme
once in a while, and we won't go to
sleep!

"Hoodoo Gurus." Nine out of 10
Americans surveyed think it's a
new breakfast cereal for kids —
the kind that comes in 14 un
natural colors, includes a free
space robot toy to annoy the fam
ily pets and turns your milk a dis
gusting color. The 10th either lis
tens to college radio or has noticed
the Gurus' new presence on the
commercial airwaves. Yes, this is
yet another band at the awkward
stage of development, musical pu

berty for those semi-obscure
musicians who have conquered
the college airwaves and yearn for
more.
Actually, this band should have
been on commercial radio from
the day its first album arrived
from their native Australia. The
band hit the United States with a
straightforward rock n' roll sound
— no synthesizers, no whispered
lyrics — and a loud, fun, loud,
loud tour. These guys were having
fun making music. Quite
naturally, they lost their major
label contract soon thereafter,
only to sign with yet another
major soon after their second ef
fort was released.
As usual, it was the sort of
record that gives promoters fits.
College response was overwhelm
ing, but commercial airplay
outside California was non
existent. So the band's third al
bum, "Blow Your Cool." gave it a
chance to determine its fate: to
remain a college phenom or to risk
all and attempt to slug it out with
McDonna and the Purple One. The
choice was to do a little of each.
The result is rather uninspired.
Whereas in the past the band has
been known for its catchy tunes,
air guitar-inducing chord progres
sions and generally unabashed
Aussie rock 'n' roll approach to
music, the new album. . . . Well,
to be quite honest, I can't remem
ber much about the new album,
even after repeated listening.
Sure, the approach and sound
are familiar: big drums, a few
lines about unrequited love, a
guitar solo of sorts, and then end
less repetition of the song's title,
so that the listener will remember
and buy. The first single, "Good
Times," is a prime example of this.
I know the Bangles sing back up. 1
know I've heard the song about a
jillion times, but I can't tell you

been known for its catchy tunes,
air guitar-inducing chord progres
sions and generally unabashed
Aussie rock 'n' roll approach to
music, the new album. . . . Well,
to be quite honest, I can't remem
ber much about the new album,
even after repeated listening.
Sure, the approach and sound
are familiar: big drums, a few
lines about unrequited love, a
guitar solo of sorts, and then end
less repetition of the song's title,
so that the listener will remember
and buy. The first single, "Good
Times," is a prime example of this.
I know the Bangles sing back up. 1
know I've heard the song about a
jillion times, but I can't tell you
anything about it. Apparently
thud-rocking is all but out for this
band, which is too bad, because
that was their forte. Vestiges do
remain — "Hell for Leather" and
"Middle of the Road" will recon
firm the faith of the true Hoodoo
Gurus fans; the chord progres
sions are there, and the fun atti
tude shines through. But the rest
of the album ... I just can't re
member.

Hey. thanks for all the entries in
the "You Can Write Zoo Picks"
contest. They were all totally killer
and we'll get back to you real soon.
For those of you who are dying to
see their work, hang in there! We'll
get em to do a column by the end
of this year, unless we don't, in
which case, we won't.
Ratings this week are in people
with four-letter names sure to
bring about the fall of civilization.
Chris Isaak
"Chris Isaak"
Bush, Bush. Bush
In the age of formula pop, San
Francisco's own Chris Isaak Is a
standout as an uncompromising
musician pouring out a '50s-style
rock that mixes Roy Orbison and
Elvis Presley. His first major-label
LP. "Silvertone," was loved by the
critics and a few of the songs
ended up on the "Blue Velvet"
soundtrack, but it wouldn't be un
til this. Isaak's second album, that
he would receive airplay all over
the nation — the first single, a
remake of the Yardbirds' "Heart
Full of Soul," seems destined to
break into Billboard charts all over
the place.
Isaak's sound on the new album
is consistent with the previous
one, maintaining his minor key
blues with the eerie background,
the slightly twangy guitar, and
best of all, his smooth, Elvisesque
voice. The only disappointment on
"Silvertone" was its tendency to
all-run-together-and-all-sound
the-same, but songs like "Funeral
in the Rain" and "Gone Ridin' "
drove things a little harder and
started pushing Isaak's voice.
That disappointment carries over
into this album. More than ever,
his songs sound the same and
where he came close to packing
some emotional fervor into a few
songs before, he fails to push that
emotion any further here, al
though his songs set him up per
fectly for a good, raspy, gutteral
vocal-chord rip. If only he would
do a version of the Doors'
"Roadhouse Blues."
His songs are lyrically nice. He's
a romantic trying to sing romantic
songs about the sort of love that
only existed in the '50's, despite
people trying to recreate it in the
'80 s (no wonder David Lynch

wanted his music for "Blue Vel
vet"), but even then the lyrics are
not that compelling, just nice.
Like the music, the songs are
about the same things in general
— nice love. Gimme a break.
Still, he can capture a melody
and his haunting voice is truly
enchanting. Let's hope his next al
bum can take a few risks.

Wall of Voodoo
"Happy Planet"
Suzanne Vega
"Solitude Standing"
Wall of Voodoo: Fawn. Fawn
Suzanne Vega: Hall, Hall, Hall
Well, it's spring, and it's time to
break out the old Rolling Stone
Memorial Two Records in One
Review Trick. 'Course, we have to
have some kind of theme to justify
doing this, so we've gotta come up
with one. Well, let's see — I wasn't
particularly excited to review
either one of these records, but
that's kind of a dull category.
Hmm — draw a comparison be
tween the two bands, how one
band is sort of one way, and the
other is the other. Gee, that seems
so cliched. Hey! That's it! Cliches!
That's what these bands have in
common! Not so much musically,
now — it's just that they have
jumped on the Bandwagon of
Death where they think their
songs are bitchin' poetry set to
music. Well, whatever poetry is,
this isn't it.
Wall of Voodoo was already in
big trouble. They lost Stan
Ridgway, their warbly storyteller
on Wall classix like "Mexican
Radio" and "Ring of Fire" two al
bums ago. In fact, there's only two
guys left over from the band's
heydayish "Call of the West" al
bum. Their last record was awful.
There's not much to look forward
to.
But to be fair to the guys, they
seem to be trying. While their
erstwhile release featured a pic of
the band all dressed out in
spooky-lookin' threads and spiky

haircuts, this record has only
small pix of scariness and a funny
cover pic of the band dressed dap
perly in matching suits, a la Devo.
And when I first listened. I
thought they were trying to be
Devo. 1 thought that they were
Devo. But then I realized I was lis
tening to the wrong record by acci
dent. Oops. Instead, WOV's sound
has changed now to one of ram
bling (here's the theme, kids!)
poetry backed up by strange
synthsounds, twangy guitars and
the bandspeople's never-ending
odyssey to try to imitate Stan

Ridgway. Well, we know that the
band knows and that you know
that no one can ever be Stan 'cept
Stan. I don't think they're trying
to do it — it's some weird uncon
scious psychological thing. I
think. Anyway, even if they
weren't being Stan, and even if the
music wasn't so incredibly worth
lessly typical of anybody, their

poetry is really terribly awfully
bad. It's all about L.A. and Brian
Wilson (oh. and their cover of Wil
son and Mike Love's Beach Boy
classic "Do it Again" is lousy, too.)
and I think freeways and the
beach and definitely and predic
tably spurned love. It all sort of
mushes along until it sort of
whimpers out.
Speaking of mush and
whimper, Suzanne Vega's new
record breaks new ground in the
field of Mush and Whimper Engi
neering and Applied Science. Well,
first, let's talk about Suz's gim-

mick. See. she's never herself
when she sings. She's someone
else. She's this nine-year old boy
who gets beaten by his parents, or
she's Calypso. And she's always in
her songs. Not being someone
else, but being herself as seen by
someone else, whose voice she
(the real Suzanne) uses when she
sings, even though it's not really

her. Actually, sometimes she is
someone else describing someone
else that is also Suzanne, but that
complicates the issue. Suffice to
say that Suzanne is trying to be
pretty far-out. Maybe she really is.
It's pretty nifty. I guess. But
anyways, she delivers all her stuff
in her breathy, high-pitched
talk/sing which is accompanied
by acoustic guitar, and maybe
some drums and every now and
then some other instruments.
To be sure. Vega has got lots
more interesting things to talk
about than Voodoo does. And you
can bleep over the sillier lines. But
it's that she sings it all the same
way — and while it's refreshing in
this world of crunchrock new
wave nugget after cloned
crunchrock new wave nugget to
hear some new wave folkrock, you
don't necessarily wanna hear a
whole solid hour of the stuff. And
you can't even vary it by playing it
at 45, because Vega's voice sounds
mysteriously the same at any
speed. I don't understand it
either. And nothing rhymes. Ever.
Moral of the review: If you must
be a rock star, don't be a poet too.
P.S. I know that rhyming can
sound pretty cheap, but rhyme
once in a while, and we won't go to
sleep!

Hoodoo Gurus
"Blow Your Cool"
Donna Rice, Donna Rice, Donna
Rice (and a one-way ticket to com
mercial airplay)
"Hoodoo Gurus." Nine out of 10
Americans surveyed think it's a
new breakfast cereal for kids —
the kind that comes in 14 un
natural colors, includes a free
space robot toy to annoy the fam
ily pets and turns your milk a dis
gusting color. The 10th either lis
tens to college radio or has noticed
the Gurus' new presence on the
commercial airwaves. Yes, this is
yet another band at the awkward
stage of development, musical pu

berty for those semi-obscure
musicians who have conquered
the college airwaves and yearn for
more.
Actually, this band should have
been on commercial radio from
the day its first album arrived
from their native Australia. The
band hit the United States with a
straightforward rock n' roll sound
— no synthesizers, no whispered
lyrics — and a loud, fun, loud,
loud tour. These guys were having
fun making music. Quite
naturally, they lost their major
label contract soon thereafter,
only to sign with yet another
major soon after their second ef
fort was released.
As usual, it was the sort of
record that gives promoters fits.
College response was overwhelm
ing, but commercial airplay
outside California was non
existent. So the band's third al
bum, "Blow Your Cool." gave it a
chance to determine its fate: to
remain a college phenom or to risk
all and attempt to slug it out with
McDonna and the Purple One. The
choice was to do a little of each.
The result is rather uninspired.
Whereas in the past the band has
been known for its catchy tunes,
air guitar-inducing chord progres
sions and generally unabashed
Aussie rock 'n' roll approach to
music, the new album. . . . Well,
to be quite honest, I can't remem
