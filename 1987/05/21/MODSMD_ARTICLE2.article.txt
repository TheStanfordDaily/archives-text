# Dispute over test settled by court
## 
### CLAY CALVERT Staff writer 
Both Stanford and a former professor of psy
chology at the University of Minnesota are
claiming victory in a decision issued last week
by the Ninth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in
volving the licensing of the Strong-Campbell
Interest Inventory.
The suit in question was filed by David
Campbell, who contracted in 1966 while at the
University of Minnesota to revise a psychologi
cal test used in career counseling. The test was
originally developed by Stanford Prof. E.K.
Strong in the 19205.
The test is designed to help people make
career choices, according to Iris Brest, a Uni
versity lawyer. The test asks a variety of ques
tions and the test-taker's answers "develop a
pattern which is matched against a pattern for
people in other professions." she said.

Campbell charged that the University's
agreement with Consulting Psychologists
Press Inc. (CPP) in 1983. which gave CPP ex
clusive publishing and marketing rights for
the test, violated his contract with the Univer
sity.
The appeals court ruled against the Univer
sity, stating that the rights of the CPP are not
exclusive and that the University must change
its agreement with the company.
"I think this victory strikes a blow for auth
ors in giving them a firmer grip on their work
and protecting their work from arbitrary and
capricious acts by publishers," Campbell said
in a statement prepared by his lawyer. Ronald
Katz.
But Brest said that ruling is "not important"
beyond the case in question, noting that the
University will have "no difficulty" in amend
ing the agreement.
Lynn Pashahow, the attorney handling the
case for the University, said the decision "does

not do a whole lot" for Campbell other than
give him reason to complain about his con
tract with the University.
Pashahow and Brest both claim that the
University won the more important decision in
the case, as the court ruled that Stanford
maintains the right to continue to develop and
research the test.
"On that one Stanford won squarely," Pas
hahow said, noting that Campbell had wanted
the research and development practices on the
test to be centered and controlled by the Uni
versity of Minnesota.
The court also sent a third issue in the case
back to the U.S. District Court in San Fran
cisco. That issue pertains to an anti
competition clause in Campbell's contract
with Stanford that prevents him from publish
ing a competing test, Pashahow said.
Campbell wants the clause declared invalid.
"It's something we (Stanford) will win on,"
Pashahow said.
