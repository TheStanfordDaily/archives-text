# The 						return of flower power: ‘Hair’ opens tonight
## 
### ANDREW BERKOWITZ Staff writer 
It's been 20 years since the dawning of the Age of
Aquarius (which, I suppose, makes this the sunset of
the age of Scorpio), and the American tribal-love rock
musical "Hair" is no longer as shocking or revolu
tionary as it was at the close of the '60s. However,
thanks to director Mitch Rudominer's "minor
amount of deleting, inserting, grouping and re
arranging," the new '80s version of "Hair" has
emerged as a fun tribute to the flower-power genera
tion.
Concerned that the frank language, drug use and
sex of the original production would lose their shock
effect in the Stanford of the '80s, Rudominer
trimmed away much of the original "shock value" so
he "was able to concentrate more on the music and
the plot," he said. Remaining are copious amounts of
sex, drugs and swear words (in the horn section
alone), but what Newsweek described in 1968 as
making "any musical on the Broadway boards look
like high noon in a Christian Science reading room"
is really just a fun musical with some great songs in
1987.
This production, at the Sterling Quad Dining and
Performance Center (SQDPC or Squid Puck), is
carried by the sheer energy of the cast and some fine
Individual performances. Most of the solos are quite
good, and some are excellent. Most notable are Henry
Shead's (Berger) powerful voice and commanding
stage presence, Charlene Huang's (Sheila) strong
singing and Alexis Camacho's (Jeanie) amazing vo
cal range and strong voice. At one point, the sexual
dynamo Camacho sits precariously on the shoulders
of Brian Taylor (Steve) as he walks down a flight of
stairs from high above the stage. She has a terrified
look on her face that says, "Please don't drop me onto

the trumpet player," but Taylor seems to be wonder
ing, "Are you going to hold this note so I can take you
down another step?"
Where the singing really stands out is in the parts
involving the entire chorus; the combination of male
and female voices blends nicely on the songs, and the
SQDPC's small size makes the performance loud and
close. The choreography ranges from group dance
numbers to random wandering through the audi
ence, to lying in an orgiastic heap on the floor. Where
this stripped-down version of "Hair" lags is in the in
frequent dialogue between the songs. Despite
Rudominer's attempt to emphasize the plot, we
would almost rather skip the anti-war, anti
establishment, pro-drug dialogue and get on to the
next song.
Music is provided by the "orchestra," consisting of
two guitars, a bass, a piano, a saxaphone, a flute,
drums, two trumpets (give or take the trumpeter
hoping Camacho will fall into his arms from the bal
cony) and a synthesizer-percussion Paul Schaefer
wanna-be. This ain't no orchestra; it's a rock band.
The '60s were years that brought us war, LSD and
President Kennedy's extra-marital affairs; little is dif
ferent today, except that our attitudes have changed.
We are no longer surprised or moved by profanity, in
ebriation or nudity. Sorry, no nudity in this produc
tion. The "Hair" of the '80s is a rousing look back at
"the old days." This production isn't perfect, but ad
mission is only a buck, and it's well worth it. The
familiar songs of hope such as "Aquarius" and"The
Flesh Failures (Let the Sunshine In)" nicely comple
ment some of the other, racier music, and the result
is a fun, energetic musical that you can't take the
whole family to.
Tickets are available at noon in White Plaza or at
the door for "Hair," which plays tonight through
Sunday at 8:30 p.m.
