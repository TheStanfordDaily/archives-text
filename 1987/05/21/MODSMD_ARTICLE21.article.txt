# Orton: A sordid yet sympathetic 'Prick'
## 
### JENNIFER REESE 
Prick Up Your Ears" is a dark, funny movie
about the life of British playwright Joe Orton.
who was murdered in 1967 by Kenneth Hal
liwell. his homosexual lover of many years. The
movie focuses on the relationship between Or
ton and Halliwell, and the tensions building up
to the night when Halliwell hammered Orton
to death, then swallowed an overdose of
Nembutals. The movie does an exceptionally
good job of personalizing this bizarre and
tragic story of two not-very-likeable men.
Orton apparently had everything over Hal
liwell. He was younger, better looking, more
charming. Halliwell, an aspring and frustrated
novelist, took Orton in, tried to educate him,
encouraged him to write, and was devastated
when eventually his protege achieved the fame
he himself had always desired. Alas. Orton was
not one to smoothe over these jealousies. He
flaunted his successes, literary and otherwise.
He became cruelly offhand with the increas
ingly tortured Halliwell. and wrote explicit des
criptions of his many sexual encounters in his
diary, leaving it out for Halliwell to read. This
could only end badly.
What is remarkable about the movie is how
real it makes these men seem. The subject
matter is lurid enough to keep you watching
for the sex scenes and the violence, but this is
clearly a movie about the people behind the
tragedy. Despite their often sordid, selfish
lives, Orton and Halliwell become very likeable.
The actors deserve credit for this, as does the

director Stephen Frears. who doesn't gloss
over Orton's moral blemishes, but doesn't ex
ploit them either. The film Is fair: It brings
down to earth a potentially sensational story
without neutering it or sweetening It.
The film is done in a series of flashbacks as
the biographer John Lahr, played by Wallace
Shawn, interviews people who knew Orton and
Halliwell. This is an effective frame. Lahr, a
heterosexual whose wife in the movie is preg
nant. hooks the middle-of-the-road viewer into
a film that might otherwise seem too far-out.
His presence makes the movie easier to swal
low, and provides intervals of fresh air.

Love as an alien concept.

Orton and Halliwell lived for many years on
the fringes of society in a claustrophobic room
with walls covered with pictures they cut out of
magazines and library books. They were ar
rested and imprisoned for defacing library
books, and were under constant threat of ar
rest for picking up men and having sex in
public lavatories. Love seems to have been an
almost alien concept, especially for Orton.
When Orton's mother dies. Halliwell sobs, "I'm
sorry, Joe." Orton responds coldly, "I'm not."
While he is a sympathetic, attractive character
generally, there is an undeniable moral and
emotional vacancy about him. Watching this
movie, even as Orton becomes immensely suc
cessful, it's hard to imagine a happy ending.

It isn't a heavy film, though. It's done with a
light comic touch. The actors are extremely ap
pealing. Gary Oldman as Orton is charming
and magnetic, a naughty boy with a twinkle in
his eye. Yet he captures Orton's flip side of
coldness and narcissism. When Orton goes to
his mother's funeral and laughs, eyeing a teen
age boy in the room, it is chilling but also
funny and somehow good-natured. It's abso
lutely clear why Halliwell loved him. but was so
destroyed by him.
Tall, spider-legged and completely bald,
Alfred Molina creates a Halliwell both pathetic
and proud. His face is ugly but interesting to
watch because it is extremely expressive. Hal
liwell is full of affectations, but alone with Or
ton he is nervous and insecure, hovering like a
neglected wife. "I don't understand my life," he
says to Orton, "I gave you everything, I made
you . .
"Anyway." Joe says, "If it hadn't been you it'd
have been someone else." All of Halliwell's vul
nerabilities and wounds are painfully exposed
on Molina's face. It is an excellent perfor
mance. In many ways the movie is about him
and his despair more than it is about Orton.
There is something not quite human about Or
ton; Halliwell is all too human.
"Prick Up Your Ears" animates a bizarre and
ugly story, making it accessible and involving.
It creates some very interesting and convinc
ing characters. It isn't a movie of large scope,
and it's not one that will stimulate good or
happy feelings. It's a small movie, about a very
specific subject, and it is extremely well done.

There is something not quite human about Or
ton; Halliwell is all too human.
"Prick Up Your Ears" animates a bizarre and
ugly story, making it accessible and involving.
It creates some very interesting and convinc
ing characters. It isn't a movie of large scope,
and it's not one that will stimulate good or
happy feelings. It's a small movie, about a very
specific subject, and it is extremely well done.
