## Fendick set to play for two NCAA titles 
### KEN STEVENS Editorial staff 
LOS ANGELES — Patty Fendick
showed once again yesterday that she can
take a shot and come back stronger. If her
opponents can not apply the knock-out
punch today, she could become the first
player in NCAA women's tennis history to
win the team, singles and doubles cham
pionships in the same season.
Fendick, who was hit in the left thigh
by Florida's Shaun Stafford in Saturday's
team semifinal, earned the right to play
Stafford again in today's 6 p.m. singles

final at the Los Angeles Tennlr Center.
Stafford beat Stanford's Lisa Green 6-4.
6-0, and Fendick ousted SMU's Jennifer
Santrock 6-1, 6-3 in yesterday's singles
semifinal matches, but the action was far
from over.
Fendick then took the court with
Stephanie Savides for a quarterfinal
doubles match against Sonia Hahn and
Tamaka Takagi of Kentucky.
With the fourth-seeded Stanford pair
ahead 7-6, 4-1, Savides attempted to hit a
forehand volley at the net. The ball
glanced off her racket and hit an un
suspecting Fendick square in the right

eye. She fell to the ground and lay there
surrounded by Savides, Stanford Coach
Frank Brennan and team trainer Dake
Walden for five minutes.
"I was just hoping 1 could stand up,"
Fendick said later.
Fendick did get up, and she and
Savides finished off the seventh-seeded
Kentucky pair 7-6 (7-3), 6-2, but nobody
was sure whether Fendick would be able
to play 30 minutes later in the semifinals
against top-seeded Jill Hetherington and
Cathy Goodrich of Florida.
With her eye almost completely swollen
shut, Fendick took the court for the semi

final. "I couldn't see the whole first set."
she said.
Fendiek proved, however, that she can
play better with one eye than most people
can with two. She and Savldes captured
the first set 6-3.
After dropping the next set 6-1. the
Stanford pair regrouped to blast Het
herington and Goodrich in the third set
for a 6-3, 1-6. 6-1 victory.
In tonight's singles final, Fendiek and
Stafford are expected to come out swing
ing. Hopefully, all the swinging will be
done with the rackets.
Fendiek is still smarting from being hit
by Stafford, and the Florida freshman did
little to ease the tension in yesterday af
ternoon's press conference.
In last Saturday's match, Stafford had
an easy put-away, and Fendiek moved
aside, choosing not to contest the shot.
Instead of placing the ball in the open
court, however, Stafford pounded a
forehand into Fendick's left thigh from
about five feet away. A bruise nearly four
inches in diameter still remains there.
"1 meant to do it." Stafford said yester
day after beating Green. "I'm emotional,
and I'm me. It was there, and I went for it.
She kind of gave me room to hit the ball
past her, and I chose not to."
Stafford said that she was simply trying
to show that she was not intimidated
playing against the top woman in the
country, but she may well have provided
Fendiek with all the motivation she needs
tonight.
"I tell you, in the team competition, she
slapped me from five feet away," Fendiek
said. "That, in and of itself. Is enough
(motivation)."
Fendiek said that she will not easily for
get that point. "Match number 50
(Fendick's 50th straight win) — Shaun
Stafford. I'll remember that for the rest of
my life," Fendiek said, adding that she
had to restrain herself from retaliating at
that instant. "It took everything I could to
hold on to that ball."
Despite the unpleasantries, Fendiek
and Stafford indicated respect for each
other's games during the respective press
conferences yesterday.
"Shaun's playing a lot better than she

did in the team (tournament)." said Fen
dick. who is now 39-0 this season. "She's
hungry. She wants it. There are a lot of
people who are satisfied to get to a certain
point. She's not satisfied. As a freshman,
it's so hard to pace yourself, especially
with Florida's schedule. I'm impressed
she's here."
"We had a good first match (a 6-3, 6-3
Fendick victory)." said Stafford, 33-8.
"She's a great player, and I hope it's a
great match."
Neither of yesterday's semifinal
matches was great. Fendick was as loose
as she has been all tournament, and she
was on top from the start. She broke
Santrock's serve twice in the first set to
win 6-1. and then took two love games to
open the second set.
Santrock fought back to 2-2, but Fen
dick broke back twice more to take the set
6-3 for the match.
"I'm more relaxed every match, because
the big fear being seeded number one is
getting knocked out in an early round,
when everyone is gunning for you," Fen
dick said.
Green had advanced to the semifinals
with an explosive array of groundstrokes,
but yesterday she hit the ball by Stafford
about as often as she held her serve. In
eight attempts. Green could hold her
serve just once.
Despite her inability to land her first
serve. Green still had her chances in the
first set. Trailing 4-3, she lost a 3-all point
on her serve, and down 5-4, she lost an
other 3-all point to drop the set.
The match ended in a little over in
hour, as Green's unforced error total
soared in the second set. She had 28 un
forced errors out of 90 points in the
match.
The doubles final will follow the singles
championship tonight. Fendick and
Savides will be up against Northwestern's
Diane Donnelly and Katrina Adams, the
No. 2 seeds. Donnelly and Adams defeated
Miama's Ronnni Reis and Lise Gregory 7-
6, 6-4 yesterday in the semifinals. Reis
and Gregory were the defending NCAA
champions.
Fendick said her eye should not bother
her today.


It could be a historic night for the Cardinal's Patty Fendick. If
Fendick can walk away with victories in tonight's singles and
doubles finals, the senior will become the first player in the

Barry Saik/Daily
history of NCAA women's tennis to win the team, singles and
doubles crowns in a single season. Fendick will be joined in
the doubles competition by teammate Stephanie Savides.

"We had a good first match (a 6-3, 6-3
Fendick victory)." said Stafford, 33-8.
"She's a great player, and I hope it's a
great match."
Neither of yesterday's semifinal
matches was great. Fendick was as loose
as she has been all tournament, and she
was on top from the start. She broke
Santrock's serve twice in the first set to
win 6-1. and then took two love games to
open the second set.
Santrock fought back to 2-2, but Fen
dick broke back twice more to take the set
6-3 for the match.
"I'm more relaxed every match, because
the big fear being seeded number one is
getting knocked out in an early round,
when everyone is gunning for you," Fen
dick said.
Green had advanced to the semifinals
with an explosive array of groundstrokes,
but yesterday she hit the ball by Stafford
about as often as she held her serve. In
eight attempts. Green could hold her
serve just once.
Despite her inability to land her first
serve. Green still had her chances in the
first set. Trailing 4-3, she lost a 3-all point
on her serve, and down 5-4, she lost an
other 3-all point to drop the set.
The match ended in a little over in
hour, as Green's unforced error total
soared in the second set. She had 28 un
forced errors out of 90 points in the
match.
The doubles final will follow the singles
championship tonight. Fendick and
Savides will be up against Northwestern's
Diane Donnelly and Katrina Adams, the
No. 2 seeds. Donnelly and Adams defeated
Miama's Ronnni Reis and Lise Gregory 7-
6, 6-4 yesterday in the semifinals. Reis
and Gregory were the defending NCAA
champions.
Fendick said her eye should not bother
her today.


It could be a historic night for the Cardinal's Patty Fendick. If
Fendick can walk away with victories in tonight's singles and
doubles finals, the senior will become the first player in the

Barry Saik/Daily
history of NCAA women's tennis to win the team, singles and
doubles crowns in a single season. Fendick will be joined in
the doubles competition by teammate Stephanie Savides.
LOS ANGELES — Patty Fendick
showed once again yesterday that she can
take a shot and come back stronger. If her
opponents can not apply the knock-out
punch today, she could become the first
player in NCAA women's tennis history to
win the team, singles and doubles cham
pionships in the same season.
Fendick, who was hit in the left thigh
by Florida's Shaun Stafford in Saturday's
team semifinal, earned the right to play
Stafford again in today's 6 p.m. singles

final at the Los Angeles Tennlr Center.
Stafford beat Stanford's Lisa Green 6-4.
6-0, and Fendick ousted SMU's Jennifer
Santrock 6-1, 6-3 in yesterday's singles
semifinal matches, but the action was far
from over.
Fendick then took the court with
Stephanie Savides for a quarterfinal
doubles match against Sonia Hahn and
Tamaka Takagi of Kentucky.
With the fourth-seeded Stanford pair
ahead 7-6, 4-1, Savides attempted to hit a
forehand volley at the net. The ball
glanced off her racket and hit an un
suspecting Fendick square in the right

eye. She fell to the ground and lay there
surrounded by Savides, Stanford Coach
Frank Brennan and team trainer Dake
Walden for five minutes.
"I was just hoping 1 could stand up,"
Fendick said later.
Fendick did get up, and she and
Savides finished off the seventh-seeded
Kentucky pair 7-6 (7-3), 6-2, but nobody
was sure whether Fendick would be able
to play 30 minutes later in the semifinals
against top-seeded Jill Hetherington and
Cathy Goodrich of Florida.
With her eye almost completely swollen
shut, Fendick took the court for the semi

final. "I couldn't see the whole first set."
she said.
Fendiek proved, however, that she can
play better with one eye than most people
can with two. She and Savldes captured
the first set 6-3.
After dropping the next set 6-1. the
Stanford pair regrouped to blast Het
herington and Goodrich in the third set
for a 6-3, 1-6. 6-1 victory.
In tonight's singles final, Fendiek and
Stafford are expected to come out swing
ing. Hopefully, all the swinging will be
done with the rackets.
Fendiek is still smarting from being hit
by Stafford, and the Florida freshman did
little to ease the tension in yesterday af
ternoon's press conference.
In last Saturday's match, Stafford had
an easy put-away, and Fendiek moved
aside, choosing not to contest the shot.
Instead of placing the ball in the open
court, however, Stafford pounded a
forehand into Fendick's left thigh from
about five feet away. A bruise nearly four
inches in diameter still remains there.
"1 meant to do it." Stafford said yester
day after beating Green. "I'm emotional,
and I'm me. It was there, and I went for it.
She kind of gave me room to hit the ball
past her, and I chose not to."
Stafford said that she was simply trying
to show that she was not intimidated
playing against the top woman in the
country, but she may well have provided
Fendiek with all the motivation she needs
tonight.
"I tell you, in the team competition, she
slapped me from five feet away," Fendiek
said. "That, in and of itself. Is enough
(motivation)."
Fendiek said that she will not easily for
get that point. "Match number 50
(Fendick's 50th straight win) — Shaun
Stafford. I'll remember that for the rest of
my life," Fendiek said, adding that she
had to restrain herself from retaliating at
that instant. "It took everything I could to
hold on to that ball."
Despite the unpleasantries, Fendiek
and Stafford indicated respect for each
other's games during the respective press
conferences yesterday.
"Shaun's playing a lot better than she

did in the team (tournament)." said Fen
dick. who is now 39-0 this season. "She's
hungry. She wants it. There are a lot of
people who are satisfied to get to a certain
point. She's not satisfied. As a freshman,
it's so hard to pace yourself, especially
with Florida's schedule. I'm impressed
she's here."
"We had a good first match (a 6-3, 6-3
Fendick victory)." said Stafford, 33-8.
"She's a great player, and I hope it's a
great match."
