# Men lose in early rounds of singles
## 
### JON WEISMAN Staff writer 
Stanford's two participants in
the NCAA singles championships
drowned in a wave of upsets in
Athens, Ga., yesterday, washing
away the remnants of the 1987
Stanford men's tennis season.
Junior two-time All-America
Patrick McEnroe, the 1 lth-ranked
player in the nation, was ousted in
the first round by No. 100 Jonas
Svensson of Minnesota, 6-4, 6-4,
while freshman All-America Jeff
Tarango fell to 44th-ranked Ned
Caswell of Minnesota in the
second round, 6-3, 6-4.
Tarango defeated New Mexico's
Steve Bickham in the opening
round 7-5, 6-4, before succumb
ing to Caswell, who also
eliminated McEnroe from the
NCAA singles in the first round
last year.
The two Cardinal, who were
seeded among the second eight in
the tournament, could take solace
in the fact that five of the top eight
seeds were knocked off yesterday.
The first round took out four of
those seeds. No. 2 Andrew Sznaid
jer of Pepperdine lost to West Vir
ginia's Paul Mancini 6-2, 6-4. No.
4 Steve DeVries of California lost
all momentum from an easy first
set against No. 52 Johan Karlen of
South Carolina, dropping the

match 1-6, 6-2, 6-4.
USC's fifth-ranked Luke Jen
sen, the ambidextrous, head
banded wonder who was ranked
second this season until losing to
McEnroe three straight times,
also blew a one-set lead in his loss
to SMU's Dan Bishop, 3-6, 6-4, 6-
3. Bishop's teammate, however,
eighth-seeded Stefan Kruger,
reciprocated, losing to No. 68 Paul
Williamson of Columbia in three
sets, 3-6, 6-1, 7-5.
The biggest news came in the
second round. Season-long No. 1
player and top seed Richey
Reneberg, also of the Mustangs,
was defeated by No. 17 Shelby
Cannon of Tennessee, 6-3, 6-3.
Stanford can look back with
pride on its efforts this seaon, but
more important, it can look for
ward with optimism toward next
season. With four starters return
ing at both singles and doubles
and with a recruiting class that
features three of the nation's (op
six high school seniors, Stanford
will likely be challenging for the
top spot again.
The Cardinal's main competi
tion figures to be from 1987 na
tional champion Georgia, which
won its title with a lineup contain
ing three freshmen and two soph
omores and which has the na
tion's other three top-ranked high
school seniors joining the team.
