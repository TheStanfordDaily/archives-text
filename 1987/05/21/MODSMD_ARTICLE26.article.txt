## No word yet on Round Two Draw results 
### MARTHA MOODY Staff writer 
Students hoping to get a better housing
assignment in Round Two of the Housing
Draw will have to wait until Tuesday for
final results, according to Director of Stu
dent Housing Rodger Whitney.
After Round One results were an
nounced. students could accept their as
signment. refuse it and drop out of the
housing lottery or do nothing and automat
ically enter in Round Two.
Students can either move up or remain in
the same position, but never move down on
their list of choices In Round Two, when all
assignments will be permanent if they are
accepted.
After the second round, all campus

houses will be at least 90 percent full, with
the possible exception of the co-op Synergy.
Whitney said. Twenty-three spots in
Synergy, one of Stanford's six co-op houses,
were not filled during Round One. he
added.
The fact that so many spots in Synergy
are not filled suggests that few students
visited Synergy before the Draw to obtain
priorities. Whitney said. He said he does
not know exactly how many students got
priorities at Synergy because some un
guaranteed students drew numbers that
were too low to place them in the
"assignable pool" for Round One.
During the first round, only students
with priorities are assigned to theme
houses. This is to ensure that students as
signed to these houses have demonstrated

a commitment to the theme, and also to
measure student interest in that theme.
Whitney said.
The "assignable pool" for Round Two will
include unguaranteed students with higher
draw numbers. Whitney said, because
many students who were assigned to
residences have joined fraternities or been
selected for resident assistant positions
since first-round results were announced.
This may help Synergy to fill, Whitney said.
During Round Two, students in the pool
with priorities for a theme house will be as
signed there until all spaces are filled. Whit
ney said. If there are still spaces after all
students with priorities are assigned, stu
dents who did not obtain a priority but who
did put the house on their Draw card will be
assigned to the house.

If there are still spaces after all those stu
dents are assigned, students who expressed
what Is known as "general choice" will be
assigned there, Whitney said. In the case of
Synergy, this would mean students who
wrote "any co-op" on their draw cards.
The Housing Center will not assign stu
dents requesting any campus residence to a
theme house, Whitney said. Therefore,
Synergy may still not be 90 percent filled
after Round Two. If this happens, it will
become a University-operated house, Whit
ney said, because Synergy has had prob
lems filling itself for the past several years.
The residents of Synergy would be free to
petition the Row Office to make their
residence a self-op, Whitney said. He said
that such a petition is likely to be granted.
