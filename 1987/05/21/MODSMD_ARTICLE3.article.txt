### MARCUS MABRY Senior staff writer 
The University report on the
drowning death of junior David
Dunshee will be released by the
end of the week following a two
week delay that was needed to
conduct interviews to complete
the report, a University official es
timated.
Michael Jackson, assistant to
the provost and head of the inves
tigation. said the importance of
the report also delayed its release.
"It's very important that it be
thorough and precise," he said. " I
have basically written a report,

and I'm having people read it."
The proofers of the report are from
the Office of Student Affairs. Jack
son said, declining to be more spe
cific.
Dunshee drowned April 22 in
Lagunita after leaving a Zeta Psi
Rush party at the Boathouse.
Police speculated that he fell in the
lake and was unable to reach
safety due to alcohol intoxication.
Jackson, who was appointed
April 27 by acting Dean of Student
Affairs Norm Robinson, said that
he interviewed 19 students and
one resident fellow over the three
week period, putting their state
ments into the report.

The student interviewees in
cluded six Zeta Psi members. "To
write (the statements) and double
check them takes time." Jackson
said.
According to Jackson, the in
vestigation process includes
detailed examination of numerous
documents concerning University
policies.
The report may affect the Uni
versity alcohol policy, fraternity
policy or Rush policy, Robinson
said earlier.
When it is completed. Jackson
will submit the report to Robin
son. who will release it to the
public after examination.

The initial police report into
Dunshee's death was rejected by
the Santa Clara County District
Attorney's Office last Wednesday
because it was deemed "far from
complete" by Deputy District At
torney Ron Rico, who sent it back
to Stanford Police Chief Marvin
Herrington for completion.
The report did not contain any
information about the cause of
death or Dunshee's blood alcohol
level.
The Santa Clara County
Coroner's Office said yesterday
that its report, which will contain
the missing information, may be
released by the end of the week.
