### HUGH R. BETHELL Editorial Staff 
Education Secretary William
Bennett was unfair in his recent
criticism of college courses on eth
ics. according to University Presi
dent Donald Kennedy and Har
vard University President Derek
Bok, who addressed 500 alumni
from their institutions in New
York yesterday.
"Courses can't turn scoundrels
into virtuous human beings," Bok
said. "Above all, they counteract
moral relativism — the excessive
tolerance that leads students to
believe that moral views are mat
ters of opinion beyond reasoned
remarks."
Kennedy agreed that giving
thought to the rules and codes
that govern student life can be "an
important educational tool in de
veloping character and teaching
students to respect the rights of
others."
"Psychologists say that this is
crucial since the essential stage of
moral development in college is a
shift from abstract principles to
ethics based on a concern for
others," Bok said.
The two university leaders made
their remarks during an unusual
joint meeting on the subject of
leadership and innovation in
modern society that was
cosponsored by the Stanford Club
of New York/New Jersey and the
Harvard Club of New York City. A
similar meeting is scheduled to
take place this fall in Los Angeles.
Kennedy framed his commen
tary on ethics in an address
largely devoted to describing the
special dual nature of the research
university, which he said "ap
pears to confuse our Secretary of
Education."
"The American research univer
sity and its unique coupling of

learning and doing have clearly set
this nation apart as the world's
leader in discovery. And that is
what we must work at — and
worry about — sustaining for this
society," Kennedy said.
To maintain our edge in re
search, Kennedy argued. Ameri
can universities must prepare an
able and ethical new generation of
scholars by training both under
graduate and graduate students
in moral as well as academic
areas.
"Training for research is not, or
should not be, exclusively an issue
for our graduate students," Ken
nedy said. "It is equally important
that training for leadership not be
looked upon exclusively as a re
sponsibility at the undergraduate
level."
According to Kennedy, today's
graduate programs do not ade
quately prepare doctoral students
for their future lives as academic
leaders.
"Even in the more favorable set
tings, little is done to prepare
Ph.D. students for the world of
practice or for the challenge of im
proving it. The consequences are
a little dismaying to one who loves
the academic profession and his
own membership in it," Kennedy
said.
Bok also emphasized the impor
tant role that universities play in
educating students about ethics.
"There are certain principles basic
to responsible leadership —
obligations to refrain from steal
ing, lying, cheating, violence,
breaking the law," Bok said. "If
universities do not assume more
responsibility for developing the
character to respect these prin
ciples, who else will?"
Kennedy joined Bok in ack
nowledging that society must
prepare the individual to face the
"conflict-of-interest problems"
and other ethical matters that are
part of adult life.
"We are doing very little to
prepare [students) for the personal
and professional challenges they
are likely to face. So why should
we be surprised when they disap
point us?" Kennedy said.
Both Bok and Kennedy stressed
the importance of community ser
vice. saying that public activity
breeds responsibility and charac
ter.
"It's a way of increasing em
pathy for the needs of others and
instilling the habit of service."
Bok said.
Kennedy concluded by examin
ing the important role of the re
search university in fostering in
novation. contending that in
training students to be leaders
and innovators, schools like Stan
ford and Harvard undertake a vital
task.
