# Faculty Senate to consider new interdisciplinary program
## 
### ASHLEY GRIFFIN 
The Faculty Senate will vote tomorrow
on a proposed program aimed at combin
ing a pure math approach with applied
mathematics.
The program, called Scientific Comput
ing and Computational Mathematics, was
proposed by Computer Science Prof. Gene
Golub and Mathematics Prof. Joseph Kel
ler.
It will "emphasize the applied side of
mathematics," said Bob Eustls. associate
dean of engineering. At present. Stanford

deals only in "pure" mathematics, and the
engineering department is "very inter
ested in the computational side." he
added.
The program will be "interdepartmental
and interschool. joining the Humanities
and Sciences and the School of Engineer
ing," Eustis said.
Mathematics and computer science are
not the only focus of this program. Eustls
said. Chemistry, physics, applied physics
and other areas in earth sciences and en
gineering will be highlighted.
If the program is approved, the core fac

ulty will include Golub. Keller and Com
puter Science Prof. Joe Oliger. "Joe Keller
is world famous as an applied mathe
matician," Eustis said, adding that "Gene
Golub received three honorary degrees
this year for work in his field of computa
tional mathematics."
Eustis added that one non-Stanford
member will be appointed, and 10 to 12
additional faculty from various depart
ments will also be Involved.
Part of the proposed program would be
put into effect next fall, but it will not be
entirely Integrated until autumn 1988.

In other business, the senate will ad
dress the Committee on Academic
Achievement and Appraisal's proposal to
modify policies concerning Dead Week
and final examinations.
In the past two years, the CAAA and the
University Committee on Athletics. Physi
cal Education and Recreation have been
concerned about the scheduling of athle
tic events during Dead Week and the
problems created in arranging make-up
examinations for athletes participating in
championship events during finals week.
For that reason, the CAAA has been

pressing for revisions of the policy.
The CAAA's proposed amendment of
the Dead Week statement reads: "If un
foreseen circumstances prevent the stu
dent from sitting for the regularly sched
uled examination, instructors should
make alternative arrangements on an In
dividual basis. Such unforeseen circum
stances Include illness, personal emer
gency, or the student s required partici
pation in special events approved as ex
ceptions by the Committee on Academic
Achievement and Appraisal (e.g. athletic
championships).
