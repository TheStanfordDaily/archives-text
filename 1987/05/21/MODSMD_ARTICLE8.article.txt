Contra leader testifies
WASHINGTON — Nicaraguan resistance leader Adolfo Calero
told Senate and House committees yesterday that he gave *90,000
In unsigned travelers checks to former White House aide Oliver
North in 1985 — money that congressional Investigators say is
still largely unaccounted for.
The money was just a fraction of the >33.6 million that Calero
received from a variety of sources — primarily King Fahd of
Saudla Arabia and private U.S. donors — between 1984 and 1986
when direct military aid from the U.S. government was prohibited
by Congress. North had played a major role In raising the funds.
Three wealthy American contributors — Colorado brewer
Joseph Coors. Ellen Garwood of Texas and William O'Boyle of New
York — will appear before the committee today along with retired
Army Maj. Gen. John Singlaub, who testified yesterday that his
attempts to supply Calero with cheap weapons were undermined
by higher-price vendors such as North's associate, retired Air
Force Mai. Gen. Richard Secord.
Singlaub also said that his solicitation of contra donations from
two countries — Taiwan and South Korea — were curtailed in May
1986 at the request of Assistant Secretary of State Elliott Abrams.
who told him that it was being handled "at the highest levels" of
the U.S. government. Taiwan's *2 million contribution went to
Secord, not directly to Calero.
Calero testified that North requested money in 1985 for two
purposes: to finance the work of other contra leaders and to help
fund a so-called "private effort" that North was directing to pay
ransom for the release of American hostages in Lebanon. Calero
said that he responded gladly by giving North about *90,000 in
unsigned travelers checks drawn on his bank in the Cayman Is
lands.
Ship captain: There was no time
MANAMA, Bahrain — The captain of the American frigate that
was attacked by an Iraqi aircraft in the Persian Gulf said yesterday
that defense systems aboard the ship were fully operational at the
time of the raid but that there was not sufficient time to deploy
them.
In his first public comment since the Sunday attack that left 37
sailors dead, Capt. Glenn Brindel of the guided-missile frigate
Stark told reporters that he had no warning that a missile had
been fired at his ship until a lookout visually sighted the projectile
streaking through the night.
After the visual sighting, Brindel said, the missile was at "a sig
nificantly close range, and there were only a few seconds for defen
sive measures to be put Into effect."
He said that the ship's Phalanx system, designed as a last-ditch
defense against incoming missiles, was being switched from a
manual to an automatic mode when the first of two missiles ex
ploded on the Stark's port-side hull, knocking out the ship's
electronics.
The Phalanx, a multi-barrel, rapid-fire gun, was normally kept
in a manual mode because in automatic it might shoot at low
flying non-hostile aircraft, Brindel said.
DOE funded pro-nuke lobbying
WASHINGTON — The Department of Energy has given a
>550,000 contract to a Washington defense contractor to assist in
lobbying Congress against a comprehensive ban on nuclear tests,
according to DOE documents, although federal regulations bar
the use of government funds by contractors to influence legisla
tion.
At the same time, employees of nuclear-weapons laboratories
under contract to DOE have coordinated lobbying activities to try
to dissuade the House and Senate from approving limits on nu
clear testing despite department regulations against unsolicited
contacts by contractors with Congress, according to DOE docu
ments obtained by The Washington Post.
Both efforts are part of the department's campaign to block any
legislation that would limit the ability of U.S. laboratories and the
DOE to pursue an aggressive program of testing of nuclear war
heads. DOE is responsible for U.S. nuclear-weapons research and
production.
Like other government departments, DOE prohibits contractors
from using public funds to lobby Congress. But the documents
make clear that the purpose of the activities paid for by DOE was
to Influence congressional deliberations on proposed legislation
that would halt most nuclear tests.
Hart looks to stay in spotlight
DENVER — Former presidential candidate Gary Hart is making
it clear to his friends and supporters that he will not go gentle into
that political night.
In meetings here and in telephone conversations with support
ers around the country, the candidate whose high-flying cam
paign came crashing down two weeks ago has laid out an ambi
tious blueprint designed to maintain his political base and keep
himself at the center of national policy debates through the 1988
campaign and beyond.
People who have talked with Hart said his ideas range from
releasing a flood of newspaper opinion columns and magazine ar
ticles to a national lecture tour and a series of television talk show
appearances. The ex-candidate may also revive his non-profit
policy foundation to give himself a forum.
In addition, Hart is evidently looking for an appropriate way to
do something he conspicuously declined to do in his angry
withdrawal speech on May 8: apologize for his conduct.
"I think he's looking for the right place to go on national TV and
say to all the Gary Hart people out there, you know, 'I'm sorry that
I let you down'," John Emerson, Hart's deputy campaign
manager, said.
AIDS may be passed in blood
WASHINGTON — Federal officials, while describing as "rare
events" the AIDS infection of three health care workers who had
come in contact with contaminated blood, said yesterday that the
cases demonstrate the need for "vigorous adherence" to infection
control guidelines.
"If the recommendations and guidelines that existed out there
had been followed, these cases wouldn't have occurred." Donald
Berreth of the Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta, said in an
Interview.
But in New York, the National Union of Hospital and Health
Care Employees issued a statement Wednesday calling for
"Immediate meetings" with the secretaries of Labor and Health
and Human Services to discuss more stringent enforcement of
federal health center guidelines for workers who care for AIDS
patients.
The three cases are the first documented incidents of on-the-job
infections of hospital workers that did not involve accidental
needle pricks or prolonged exposure to AIDS-contamlnated body
fluids.
They were described in an an issue of the Centers for Disease
Control's Morbidity and Mortality Weeky Report due to be pub
lished this week.
One of the workers was In contact with the blood of an AIDS pa
tient for about 20 minutes at a time when her hands were
chapped, the report said. She was not wearing gloves. Another
worker believed she may have touched a rash on her ear while
handling blood that had spilled from a blood separating device.
The third was splattered in the face and mouth with infected
blood in a laboratory accident.
