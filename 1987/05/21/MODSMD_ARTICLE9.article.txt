## THE
						STANFORD DAILY An Independent Newspaper Computers for Row 
### 
Recently, Stanford has been proudly trum
peting the merits of Its dorm-based com
puter facility program. This program has
been very successful in making computer
systems available to a few residences.
For example, Wilbur dorms tend to have an
excellent array of accessible computers.
However, the benefits of the dorm-based
computer system have been very unequally
distributed. While Wilbur dorms enjoy some
select computer privileges — such as exclu
sive access to a laser printer — other
residences, such as the Row houses, have
none.
1 hese inequities appear particularly
glaring given the fact that the problem is so
easy to remedy. First, a computer area needs
to be created for the Row. Since the Row
houses are spread out — the Row includes

everything from the Cowell Cluster, to the
Delt house to 553 Mayfield — it would prob
ably be practical to assign houses to groups
of three or four and have one of the group act
as "host" to a computer facility that the other
members of the group would share.
Stanford can't argue that it doesn't have
the equipment to create such a facility. The
University is continually buying new com
puters and some of these should be allocated
to the Row. Even without buying new com
puters, Res Ed could just move one computer
from each current dorm facility to create a
computer center the Row.
There is no reason, given Stanford's prox
imity to the computer center of the world and
the fact that all students pay the same tui
tion, that all dorms shouldn't be endowed
with equal computer facilities.
