LOS ANGELES - With a 6-2. 5-7, 6-
2 victory over Florida freshman Shaun
Stafford last night in the champion
ship match of the NCAA singles tourn
ament, Stanford's Patty Fendick laid
her claim to being the best singles
player in the history of collegiate
women's tennis.
Fendick's victory at the Los Angeles
Tennis Center gave her back-to-back
singles titles as well as an undefeated
46-0 rhh'lr for tb*» season
senior from Sacramento finished her
college career with 57 consecutive
singles victories.
Following the singles final, North
western's Katrina Adams and Diane
Donnelly scored a 6-2, 6-4 victory over

Fendick and senior Stephanie Savides
in the final of the NCAA doubles tourn
ament. But the night still belonged to
Fendick.
"Unbelievable," she said of the win
streak. "I just can't even fathom how it
happened."
Stanford Coach Frank Brennan was
leading the applause for Fendick. "I've
never seen anyone more dominant,"
said Brennan, who has now coached
three straight singles titlists (Fendick
the last two years and Linda Gates in
1985). "She's the best I've ever seen."

as though it would be over quickly.
Stafford was visibly nervous in the
first set, and most of her shots landed
either in the net or five feet beyond the
baseline. Fendick won the first four
games, losing just five points.

Fendick took a 5-2 lead into the
eighth game of the set but she trailed
3-1 on her serve. After winning the
next two points, she followed a short
Stafford return of serve and hit a
forehand winner down the line to take
the first set.
The second set was even closer than
the 7-5 score indicated. A more relaxed
Stafford won five of the seven games
that were decided on 3-3 points. "In
the second set, it was like I had noth
ing to lose," Stafford said.
Fendiek »a4d *lie was surprised at
Stafford's success on the key points in
the second set. "In the past, I've been
able to pull out a majority of the 3-3
points," she said.
