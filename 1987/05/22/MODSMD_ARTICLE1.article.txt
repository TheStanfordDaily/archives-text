When Stafford won the first game of the final set
on more unforced errors off of Fendick's backhand,
the defending champion appeared frustrated during
the changeover. "I wasn't coming over my backhand
like I should." she said afterward. "That was a little
nerve-wracking."
But Fendick remained poised and remembered
what had helped her to defeat Gretchen Hush in last
year's final. "I just tried to come in (to the net) as
much as I could to the backhand side." she said. "I
learned last year to take pressure off of yourself and
put it on your opponent."
Fendick began to charge the net on every opportu
nity. and she was nearly flawless in doing so. "This
whole tournament I almost tried not to come to the
net." Fendick said. "Tonight, it was like I almost had
to come to the net to put pressure (on Stafford)."
Stafford began to feel that pressure and reverted to
her first-set form. In both the third and fourth games
of the final set. she hit backhands deep on 3-3
points, and suddenly Fendick led 3-1.
"1 became too cautious instead of just going for it,

whereas when she was in that position she went for
it." Stafford said. "In the third set, it was like the
match was even. I was being more cautious because I
didn't want to make the error."
Staiford held her serve to come within 3-2. and she
fought to a 3-3 point on Fendick's serve in the sixth
game. But Fendick took the initiative again and fol
lowed a deep approach shot to the net. Stafford
reached for a backhand, but it landed in the net. and
Fendick took a 4-2 lead.
The lead was extended to 5-2 as Fendick broke
Stafford In the seventh game, and after the change
over. Fendick was cheered on by the small but vocal
Stanford contingent of fans as she came out to serve
for the match.
Fendick's shots continued to land deeper in the
court. Earlier in the match, her shots had been fall
ing near the service line, but on the opening point of
the eighth game of the third set, she pounded a
forehand into the far corner that Stafford could only
backhand into the net.
On the next point. Fendick again pressured her
younger opponent, following a short Stafford ap
proach shot with a blistering forehand passing shot
from the service line to take a 2-0 lead in the game.
Fendick had been serving well throughout the

third set, and she took a 3-0 advantage in the final
game when she nailed a serve on the sideline of the
deuce court for an ace.
I he clinching point epitomized what had been the
difference in the final set. Fendick hit a solid serve
that pulled Stafford wide. Stafford's backhand
return was waist high and Fendick hit a crisp back
hand volley at the net for the victory.
After shaking hands with Stafford. Fendick fit
tingly embraced Brennan for almost a minute, it was
Brennan who during the 1986 season had encour
aged Fendick to add the serve-and-volley approach to
her repertoire. And It was Brennan who last night
applauded Fendick's ability to improve her game
each of her four years at Stanford.
"She's developed into a real complete player," he
said. Every year she developed something. Last
year, it was a topspin lob. And her serve has really
gotten better."
Fendick indicated that she will turn professional,
and that her first pro tournament will be Wimbledon.
Brennan predicts quick success for his prized
pupil. "I personally think Patty is going to be up
there (In the rankings)." he said. "They're not going
to be able to hold her back. I think she's going to be
top 20 bv the end of the vear. I don't see anv flaws "
