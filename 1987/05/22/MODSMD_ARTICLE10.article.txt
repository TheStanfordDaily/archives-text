### ELAINE LU Staff writer 
Democratic presidential candidate Bruce
Babbitt has accepted an invitation from
Stanford In Government (SIG) to speak at
Stanford May 26.
Babbitt, a former governor of Arizona, will
deliver a brief speech to students and inter
ested community members at 3 p.m. in
Roble lounge. Later in the day. Babbitt will
meet with University President Donald Ken
nedy and speak with faculty members at a
reception sponsored by the Public Policy

Center.
In his speech. Babbit will probably address
issues such as environment, education,
trade policy and foreign policy, especially in
relation to Latin America, said sophomore
Max Peltz, a coordinator of the event.
Babbitt served as governor of Arizona from
1978 to 1986 following a three-year stint as
state attorney general. Junior Gary Rosen of
SiG said It was "particularly timely" to have
Babbitt speak on campus because Gary
Hart's withdrawal from the presidential race
last week makes Babbitt "just as likely as any
other" Democratic candidate to receive the

nomination in 1988.
Senior Samira Kawash, chairman of SiG,
said she hopes that Babbitt will "address is
sues of the campaign,"' and that the event
will be "more of an educational forum than a
rally."
She said Babbitt's speech will provide a
"good chance for students to come and hear
perspv ves from candidates other than
those people in the media all the time."
According to Peltz. it is a necessary part of
the "democratic process" for people to get
"direct contact" with candidates' views on
policies.
