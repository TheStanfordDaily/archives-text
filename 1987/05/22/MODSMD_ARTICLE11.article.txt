# UFO expert knocks government secrecy

### LAURA REED Staff writer 
At least "some percentage" of re
ported UFO sitings are "alien
craft," independent UFO re
searcher Robert Hastings said in a
speech here last night.
If some UFOs are alien ships.
Hastings said. "We will not have
hands-on proof until some high
level CIA official releases classified
government information on
UFOs."
Hastings' presentation, titled
' UFOs: The Hidden History,"
detailed the history of U.S. govern
ment policy on UFOs. According to
the slide show, after a wave of well
publicized UFO incidents begin
ning in the 19405, the Joint
Chiefs of Staff issued a policy
prohibiting military and commer
cial airline pilots from releasing
information about any interaction
with or sighting of UFOs.
"At this point, there is an abun
dance of hard evidence of an on
going official policy of secrecy sur
rounding UFOs on the part of the
U.S. military command and the
intelligence community," Has
tings said.

Hastings showed slides of a for
merly classified National Security
Council directive, released in the
late 19705, which states that "the
director of the CIA shall formulate
and carry out a program of intelli
gence and research activities as
required to solve the problem of
instant positive identification of
UFOs."
Hastings supported his hypoth
esis that some UFO sightings defy
conventional explanation with Air
Force documents from the log of a
NORAD (North American Air
Defense) command director's log.
One series of entries records
repeated sightings of UFOs by se
curity alert teams near missile
silos in Montana in 1975.
Hastings added that there may
be some truth to statements made
by retired CIA official Victor Mar
cetti that flying saucers have
crashed and non-human corpses
have been recovered by the gov
ernment.
"I believe that it is simply a
question of time before all of this
comes tumbling out one way or
the other.
