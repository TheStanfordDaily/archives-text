Often University programs are based on
worthy goals, but suffer in execution. The
proposed summer orientation program, cur
rently being considered by the Subcommit
tee on Residential Education and Advising
(SREA), could very easily fall into this cate
gory if it is approved.
The idea is admirable. Stanford freshmen
come from a variety of different high school
backgrounds, and some are better prepared
for the University's academic rigors than
others. Stanford students are considered to
be equal, but on the first day of classes, some
are more equal than others. SREA wants to
create an academically oriented summer pro
gram to decrease the disparity between
freshmen so all new students feel comforta
ble here.
Unfortunately, the good intentions are
overshadowed by the problems an optional
summer academic program would create.
Such a program would seriously weaken
the social value of fall orientation. Approxi
mately 1,500 freshmen currently come to
Stanford in September on equal social
footing: There are no cliques, and everyone is
eager to meet new people and make new
friends. Freshmen who had spent time at a

summer program would come in the fall with
a group of friends already formed. The effort
to promote academic equality among the
freshman class would have the unintended
result of placing the freshmen on unequal so
cial footing.
Also, the timing of the academic program
would seriously undermine its goal of help
ing less educationally advantaged students.
Students from lower socio-economic back
grounds, often not as academically prepared
as others, usually must work during the
summer and cannot afford to spend one or
two or three weeks boning up on writing and
studying skills on the Farm. The summer
group would most likely be an elite bunch of
the most wealthy students who can best af
ford to come to the program, but also tend to
be the most educationally advantaged to
begin with.
Instead of holding the special orientation
during the summer, the SREA should in
stitute a similar program at the beginning of
fall quarter. The same skills could be taught
then, without the problems that would be
caused by inviting students during the sum
mer.
