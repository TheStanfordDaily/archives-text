Protests have
evolved from
racist history
At 1 a.m. on Feb. 18, 1968, a
small group of Stanford students
burned down the Naval ROTC
clubhouse near the stadium to
protest continued American in
volvement in Vietnam. Today, we
at Stanford aren't drafted into
confronting our country's
massive police actions. We don't
have to deal with a war, but we do
have to deal with the subtler
issues of conflict within our cul
ture itself. Some may find the
recent protests of the Rainbow
Agenda rude and extreme. Yet
especially as we celebrate our
University's heritage through the
Centennial, it is important that
we recognize that the issues on
the Rainbow Agenda must be a
part of Stanford's reflections on
our heritage and our future.
The voices of protest within the
University are not the product of
reactionary, oversensitive, knee
jerk liberalism. Rather, from the
Western Culture debate to the
walkout on George Schultz's
speech to Monday's sit-in at the
president's office, the stridency of
the clamour for change at Stan
ford is the result of long-term,
long-suffering and long-ignored
agitation for progress. The Rain
bow Agenda contains few
demands that are new to Stan
ford. Since 1968, when black
students took over the stage at a
University memorial service for
Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., Third
World students have been strug
gling against institutional rac
ism.
Even as we all comfortably

attend class in the optimism of
California sunshine, this
campus, like this nation, is
shaken by a deep undercurrent of
anger at oppression. This conflict
cannot be resolved until a
majority of us is moved to action
to ensure that diversity on this
campus is effectively recognized
and represented. Not until
literature and thought from
around the world are a part of our
unifying experience can Stanford
truly become the world-class
educational institution it could
be. Not until we realize the global
effects of Stanford's actions and
divest from South African com
panies contributing to apartheid,
not until we recognize the special
experiences of Third World stu
dents with minority provosts and
a cultural center, can we all
realize our own full potential in
the context of the University.
A black freshman was recently
told to "go back to Africa" when
she expressed her desire to study
Afro-American history. The at
mosphere in which that comment
was made is not one that tells
blacks, Asian Americans,
Chicanos and native Americans
that their experiences are appre
ciated here at Stanford.
The three of us writing this
opinion are white, middle-class
people representing exactly the
heritage of Euro-centered
thought and history that we seek
to change. Yet our race and cul
tural heritage neither excuse us
from participating in the struggle
nor condemn us to perpetuate it.
Like Germans in post-war
Europe, we do not need to feel
trapped into either constantly
apologizing for the past or blindly
ignoring it; we can all play an
active and positive role in fighting
racism. We can start playing this

role by attending next week's
forum on racism.

Speeches were

The sad note in the otherwise
gala Centennial Celebration was
the inadequacy of the facilities at
Maples for public meetings. It is a
disgrace that a University of the
prestige of Stanford should have
to hold public seminars in a bas
ketball gym. Look at the mag
nificent auditoriums of our
neighboring universities: the
University of California-Berkeley
and de Anza at Cupertino. Zeller
bach and Flint. Both can attract
quality programs of national and
international stature. Apart from
the discomfort of sitting in
bleachers for four to five hours,
the acoustics were impossible
and an insult for any speaker,
especially the quality speakers
invited to such an event.
Former Univeristy President
Wallace Sterling, an ex-basketball
player, diverted the "no strings"
legacy of the Maples to the
Pavilion, but I am sure that he
never expected it to be used as an
auditorium.
After last week's experience, we
hope some alums will lead the
