# NCAA drug testing is valid

A recent article treats athlete drug testing as
If the only Issue Is individual privacy (Daily.
May 14). While individual privacy is important
and seems to have been neglected by NCAA
rulemakers. the equally important issue of fair
competition should also be considered.

There are a number of drugs available that
can enhance athletic performance but that
carry substantial health risks. This is particu
larly true in endurance sports, such as dis
tance running, cross-country skiing and
bicycle racing, and in certain events where
muscle mass is important, such as athletic
weighty events and football. If testing for com
petition drugs was universally banned, ath
letes in these sports would be faced with the di
lemma of choosing between accepting a com
petitive handicap or sacrificing their health.
It Is easy enough for some people to say,
"Well, it's their choice. They should be permit
ted to endanger their health if they want to."
Having seen the results of this approach. I dis
agree. Athletes who are in the higher levels of
national and international competition know
that they must do everything within their
power to win, and it is fairly easy for them to
rationalize taking long-term health risks in or
der to gain short-term competitive advantages.
In practice, many will take this risk if it is not
prohibited and enforced. Drug testing removes
the competitive advantage of taking dangerous
drugs. I do not condone testing athletes for
drugs that are strictly recreational, however,
because that has nothing to do with fair com

petition.
The successful suit by Stanford diver
Simone LeVant, to avoid having to submit to
urine tests in NCAA competition, was valid but
irrelevant to the general drug-testing issue, for
the simple reason that there do not appear to
be any dangerous drugs that improve diving
performance. The NCAA's broad program of
testing athletes in all sports constitutes an un
necessary infringement of privacy, but it
evolved out of a genuine need ot enforce fair
competition in some sports.
Doping first came into substantial use
among athletes in the 19505; for example, bike
racers collapsed from drug overdoses in the
Tour de France in 1955 and '56. The Tour de
France, which runs over three weeks, is an ex
treme test of athletic endurance. In 1967, Brit
ain's top bike racer. Tom Simpson, was
favored to win this race, but collapsed and died
in a mountain stage, apparently from an
overdose of amphetamine. A drug-testing pro
gram was then initiated in international bike
racing and soon was added to Olympic compe
tition.
Over time, a number of sports organiza
tions. including the NCAA, have set up drug
testing programs in order to deal with this
problem. Instead of reviewing research to de
termine which drugs should be banned in par
ticular sports, these organizations have
adopted the International Olympic Committee
list of prohibited substances in its entirety.
Unfortunately, this approach results in over
kill for many sports, particularly those in
which drugs do not substantially enhance per
formance.
I believe that the NCAA and other sports'
governing bodies would be well advised to

issue of fair competi
tion should be consid
ered.

develop drug-testing programs that strike a
reasonable balance between the need for
privacy and fair competition. The American
Civil Liberties Union should also examine both
issues instead of focusing exclusively on
privacy. The best balance point between ath
lete privacy and testing requirements for any
given sport will necessarily change over time as
new drugs and medical procedures are in
vented and as new testing procedures appear. I
hope that rulemakers. lawmakers and the
courts will recognize the need for continuing
vigilance and will help safeguard both fair
competition and privacy.
