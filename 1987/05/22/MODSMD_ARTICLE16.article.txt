# Contras aren't worth it
## 
### 
Fear, anguish and despair are with us dally, yet
in our darkest hours we have three things that help
sustain us: our faith in God Almighty, the love and
support oj our families, the knowledge that on this
troubled earth there still walk men like Ollie North,
men that have shown bravery in their youth, wis
dom in their adulthood and patriotism throughout
their life.

At the end of his testimony this week to the Senate
and House committees investigating the Iran-contra
affair. Robert Owen read a free-verse poem, from
which the above lines were taken, that he had
penned for his hero, former White House aide Oliver
North.
Owen, who served as a go-between for the
Nicaraguan contra rebels and North, said U.S. offi
cials in Central America were routinely violating a
ban on U.S. military assistance to the contras in
1985 and 1986.
As the testimony of Owen and others is beginning
to reveal, the Reagan administration went to ex
traordinary lengths to fund the contras. Several
years ago, newspapers and magazines were running
articles describing how President Reagan would go
down as one of the best presidents ever. Now, Reagan
may be lucky to escape his final term in office with
out being impeached.
One must wonder why Reagan has such a strong
attachment to the contras. They have done no more
than chip a few flakes off of the foundation of the
Sandinista regime and have cost Reagan must of his
prestige.
While I have conservative political views on many
foreign policy issues, there are several reasons why I
think the United States is following a foolish policy
in Nicaragua. First, the contras simply are not going
to win. Even with direct U.S. aid, the rebels have no
more than scant success against the Sandinista
army.
Second, the contras lack popular support — both
in the United States and Nicaragua. The thorough
reliance of the contras on U.S. support indicates that
they cannot rely on their own people for assistance.
Few wars are won when the people an army is trying
to liberate do not wish to be liberated. In addition.

the U.S. electorate has been ambivalent at best In Its
desire to fund the rebels.
Finally, even If the contras win, there Is no great
assurance that the group will establish a democracy
Instead of a dictatorship.
It Is amazing the extent to which our leaders and
their aides have gone to lend credibility to the con
tras. Reagan has even gone so far to compare them to
our founding fathers.
Owen's contributions to the secret funding of the
contras offer an example of the ridiculous heights to
which the Reagan administration was willing to go
to maintain the integrity and viability of the contras.
Owen, who graduated from Stanford In the 1970s
and was a member of the Delta Upsllon fraternity,
proposed two years ago that a song be written about
the contras to drum up popular support and pres
sure Congress to approve funding the rebels. The
song was to be sung be a major country-and-western
star.
In a outline for a public relations campaign, Owen
stated, "An idea which may sound crazy but could
have some merit as far as getting publicity down the
road is having a song written about the freedom
fighters and their struggle for freedom and
democracy.
"Ideally, (it should be) one which could be
translated into either Spanish or English and sung
by an American artist and can be made into a hit —
like The Ballad of the Green Berets, " he added.
A country and western song! I can see it now.
Tammy Wynette and Willie Nelson teaming up In a
beatlful duet to contra leader Adolfo Calero and his
scruffy band of freedom fighters.
Owen has it all wrong. Surveys and polls reveal
that the staunchest Republicans are the youngest
voters. A better course of action might be to sign up
Def Leppard, Motley Crue or Bon Jovl. "Contras kick
heavy-metal butt" might have greater appeal to the
average voter.
Another Owen idea was to "use a tactic which has
gotten a lot of press recently, sit-ins at the
Nicaraguan Embassy by prominent Americans and
church leaders." Since the contras receive great
moral backing from America's religious right, Jerry
Falwall, Oral Roberts and Jim Bakker could flame
the fires of public passion by chaining themselves to
a statue of Nicaraguan leader Daniel Ortega.
Although propaganda goes along with almost all
political movements, the incredible lengths the ad
ministration — Owen In particular — has gone and
was prepared to go to drum up any support for the
contras at all reveals that the time, effort and talent
of the Reagan administration should be much better
spent.
