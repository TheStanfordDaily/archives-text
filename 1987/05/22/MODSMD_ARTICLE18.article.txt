# Agenda's behavior is poor

I am outraged by the conduct of the Rainbow
Agenda. I must preface my attack by saying
that I am in favor of affirmative action, on a
limited level. I am also making the following
comments as constructive criticism.

PERRY FRIEDMAN

When a group of self-righteous, "oppressed"
people try to use their minority status to gain
special treatment, relying on the sympathy of
the majority and the threat that anyone oppos
ing them will be labeled racist, then it is time
for someone to take a risk and speak up.
I will admit that the University is far from
egalitarian in its treatment of students. In
truth, the University caters to minorities. It
makes it easier for them to get in, and it goes
out and actively recruits minorities. It has also
created theme houses which act as a support
mechanism for minorities once they are here.
However, we are told that this is not enough.
These spoiled brats are not content that the
University has created and is maintaining
theme houses. They want University President
•Donald Kennedy to come out and say how
happy he is that we have these theme houses.
Doesn't this seem just a bit ridiculous? This is
just one example of how the Agenda Isn't con
tent even when its demands are met.
, The Rainbow Agenda is also pushing for
-greater minority recruitment. Well, there
already is a committee for minority recruit
ment. and enrollment of blacks is on par with
their percentage of the general population.
However, the agenda claims that there are not
enough inner-city minorities. This is true. But
there are also very few inner-city students in
the whole student body.
Another example of the Agenda's refusal to
be satisfied is the sit-in that was held Monday
in Kennedy's office. I am not against this ac
tion per se, but I was surprised when reading
about it to find out that a committee was
meeting as the protest was taking place to dis
cuss their demands. Again, they were not con
tent to see that their demands were being
seriously discussed but had to push the Ad
ministration by conducting themselves in this

manner. No one likes to be pushed, especially
the establishment.
I hope that the people in the Rainbow
Agenda keep this in mind and don't destroy
any gains that they may already have made. I
would also question the Rainbow Agenda's
right to issue demands. Again. I can see a little
pushing going on.
I would further challenge the conduct of the
Rainbow Agenda. Many people will remark
how "well behaved they were" at the Corner
stone Weekend. 1 believe their conduct was
rude and immature. Protesting beforehand
was fine; even a protest concurrent with the
ceremony but outside the Quad would have
been acceptable. However, disrupting the
speeches of Kennedy and Secretary of State
George Shultz was rude and Inconsiderate,
and I believe an apology is in order. Further
more. walking out on Shultz showed a com
plete lack of maturity. By not even listening to
him, they showed a certain degree of closed
mindedness. 1 was also offended by the raised
fists symbolizing "black power." This calls into
question the motives of the Rainbow Agenda.
A recent letter to the editor by Richard Suh
(Daily, May 19), implied that the Rainbow
Agenda was attempting to better affairs for
everyone. However, black power is just that,
black power. Another letter to the editor
claimed that the Rainbow Agenda represented
all minorities. This seems quite unlikely, since
almost everyone here is a minority by one stan
dard or another. In addition, I don't see the
campus Hillel chapter — which represents the
Jewish people on campus and is a legitimate
minority — involved in the Rainbow Agenda.
The idea of these students using the black
power symbol also underscores another major
concern I have about the Rainbow Agenda.
They are the biggest source of racism I have en
countered on campus. Black power can be con
strued as racism. I was shocked to find out
that the Agenda demanded "the establishment
of a vice provost for minority affairs" — a posi
tion which, according to the demands, "must
be filled by a person of color." This is blatantly
racist.
I would also like to note that the Agenda is
rapidly causing this University to receive an
undeserved bad name. I recently heard on a

I will admit the Univer
sity is far from egali
tarian in its treatment
of students here. In
truth, the University
caters to minorities. It
makes it easier for
them to get in, and it

recruits them.

television newscast that "racism is on the rise
on the Stanford campus." This is untrue.
Minority bitching about racism is on the rise.
In addition, this bad publicity may be coun
terproductive to the goals of the Rainbow
Agenda. If a minority student hears how
"racist" Stanford is, he/she might be much
less likely to apply. Would you apply to a
"racist" university?
I would like to conclude by asking two ques
tions to those students in the Rainbow
Agenda, If this University is so bad and so
racist, why don't you leave? Why don't you
divest from this "terrible" University? Anyone
who supports divestment from South Africa
and is a member of the Rainbow Agenda can
easily extend the argument to justify
"divestment" from the University. By coming
here and paying tuition you are helping to sup
port a "terrible, racist" Administration. Per
haps you feel that you can better affect change
from the inside? Perhaps you believe in
"constructive engagement?" Think about it.
