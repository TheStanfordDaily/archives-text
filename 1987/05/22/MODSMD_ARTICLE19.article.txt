Revolution is
not the way to
cure social ill
Why does each new generation
have to learn for itself the bloody
lessons already inflicted on
generations past? Mario Huerta,
with wide-eyed innocence,
proposes that the "only" hope for
a sexually liberated society lies in
"revolution" (Daily. May 18).
Wholly aside from the pathetically
simplistic dialetic that sup
posedly led him to this conclu
sion. where are the facts and
precedents to support his as
sumption?
Can Huerta cite one example of
a modern revolution that did not
end in the most restrictive
(sometimes vicious) forms of
puritanical morality? Can he cite
one example of a modern
"revolutionary" state that has
evolved a truly liberated sexual
morality? Is he familiar with the
criminal penalties imposed on
homosexual behavior in the
"revolutionary" (Communist)
states since their founding? Has
he not perhaps at least heard of
the documentary film "Improper
Conduct," which, in horrifying
detail, outlines the maniacally
homophobic paranoia of the
Cuban "revolutionary" regime —
conceived and implemented by
that saint of modern "revolution,"
Fidel Castro? Does Huerta per
haps have some other models in
mind, more supportive of his
thesis? If so, what are they?
It is precisely in the liberal and
non-revolutionary democracies
that human and sexual liberation
has reached its fullest flowering.
Yet Huerta proposes that we must

organize for revolution "before
any more of us are killed." Has he
not heard that "revolutions" kill,
and kill with discriminating pur
pose? Must we not look to history
for this truth?
The willful and ever
regenerating blindness of the
revolutionary left defies belief and
makes one very sad. Are these not
the true children of Dostoevsky's
devils? "Those who cannot re
member the past are condemned
to repeat it." Or was Hegel even
more on target when he noted
that "The only thing we learn
from history is that men never
learn anything from history"?
Let us cherish our liberal Amer
ican freedom, which allows us to
pursue the goals of human libera
tion in the framework of con
structive democracy, and reject
the delusion of "revolution" as
justice and progress.

Graduate School ojßusiness
Forum will be
educational
In Donald Kennedy's absence
this week, I write to call your
attention to a forum that will take
place Tuesday, May 26 in Kresge
Auditorium at 7 p.m. entitled,
"Racism at Stanford?!"
As the events of the recent
weeks attest, this is a timely and
important issue for our campus
and nation as a whole. I encour
age all members of the Stanford
community to take advantage of
the educational opportunity this
forum presents for sharing each
other's experiences and interac
tions.
