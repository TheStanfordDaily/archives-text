# Fac Sen bans Dead Week finals
## 
### JOHN POLLACK Senior staff writer 
Professors cannot give final exams
during Dead Week, even if students
agree to take them then, the Faculty
Senate decided yesterday.
Revising the language of the Univer
sity's Dead Week policy, the senate
closed loopholes that have in the past
allowed professors and students some
leeway in scheduling final examina
tions.
The newly revised Dead Week Policy
Statement, which explicitly prohibits
the administration of end-quarter ex
ams during Dead Week, will not take ef
fect until next year.
Under the revised policy, end-quarter
exams can only be rescheduled for a

later date. According to Registrar Sally
Mahoney. this rule will not be bent for
student/athletes whose championship
meets conflict with exam week.
Mahoney said, however, that profes
sors should be "sympathetic" to athletes'
requests to take their exams late.
The committee that drafted the revi
sions, the Committee of Academic
Achievement and Appraisal (CAAA), con
sidered the needs of student/athletes
when the Dead Week policy was under
review, according to CAAA Chair David
Wellbery, who is also an associate pro
fessor of German.
"We've achieved a good agreement
with the Athletic Department" concern
ing the scheduling of regular-season
events, Wellbery said. Under the revised
policy, no regular-season athletic events

may be scheduled during Dead Week.
Exceptions to this rule must be ap
proved by the CAAA.
Before adopting the revised Dead
Week Policy, ihe senate briefly debated a
policy amendment proposed by Law
Prof. John Kaplan that would have au
thorized professors to grant exceptions
to Ihe policy under extenuating circum
stances.
"Nothing in this policy is intended to
prevent a student, for exceptional per
sonal reasons, from asking for and re
ceiving an examination during Dead
Week," Kaplan's proposed amendment
stated.
Comparative Literature Prof. Herbert
Lindenberger criticized Kaplan's pro-
posed amendment. He said to al
low special exceptions to the
policy would "give unfair advan
tage to students with great
rhetorical powers."
"1 like hard abstract rules,"
Lindenberger said.
During the debate. Anthropol
ogy Prof. James Gibbs said that if
the revised policy were to pass,
professors could simply ignore the
restrictions, as long as students
did not complain.
The senate rejected the amend
ment and adopted the revised
policy.
After the senate meeting.
Kaplan expressed disappointment
at the passage of the policy.
"It (the policy) is not the way a
first-class university should treat

its people." Kaplan said.
Mahoney, who is an ex-officio
member of the CAAA. defended
the revised policy. She said the
revisions stemmed from student
and faculty concern over the old
policy, which permitted final ex
ams to encroach upon Dead Week.
"Students have been significant
among the individuals who have
been very concerned" with the old
policy, Mahoney said.
Mahoney said most professors
will comply with the revised
policy.
In other business. University
Provost James Rosse noted the
upcoming forum on campus rac
ism that will take place next Tues
day and encouraged the Stanford
community to attend.
"As the events of recent weeks
attest, this is a timely and impor
tant issue for our campus and for
the nation as a whole. I encourage
all members of the Stanford com

munity to take advantage of the
educational opportunity that this
forum presents for sharing each
other's experiences," Rosse said.
The senate also received reports
on affirmative action within Stan
ford's graduate schools and
among its Academic Staff Re
search Associates (ASR).
Members of ASR. most of whom
have doctorates, work on spon
sored research projects under the
direction of faculty.
According to the report on the
graduate schools, the student
body that enrolled in 1985-86 was
30.8 percent female, 5.5 percent
Asian American. 2.7 percent
black. 2.1 percent Hispanic and
0.6 percent native American.
In 1986, members of the ASR
were 28.1 percent female. 11.7
percent Asian American and 1.6
percent Hispanic. There were no
black or native American research
associates.
