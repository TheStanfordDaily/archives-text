### JOHN POLLACK Senior staff writer 
Professors cannot give final exams
during Dead Week, even if students
agree to take them then, the Faculty
Senate decided yesterday.
Revising the language of the Univer
sity's Dead Week policy, the senate
closed loopholes that have in the past
allowed professors and students some

The newly revised Dead Week Policy
Statement, which explicitly prohibits

"We've achieved a good agreement
with the Athletic Department" concern
ing the scheduling of regular-season
events, Wellbery said. Under the revised
policy, no regular-season athletic events

may be scheduled during Dead Week.
Exceptions to this rule must be ap
proved by the CAAA.

Week Policy, ihe senate briefly debated a
policy amendment proposed by Law
Prof. John Kaplan that would have au
thorized professors to grant exceptions
to Ihe policy under extenuating circum

"Nothing in this policy is intended to

Week," Kaplan's proposed amendment
stated.
Comparative Literature Prof. Herbert
Lindenberger criticized Kaplan's pro-
