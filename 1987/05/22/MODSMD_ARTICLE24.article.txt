## Fourteen Stanford students to ride Bike-Aid crosses the country to fight hunger 
### DAWN SHEGGEBY 
Working out of a shack in Hammarskjold House's
backyard, amid numerous boxes of paper, com
puters and telephones, Mary Kroetch is changing the
lives of farmers in the Philippines.
She's also planning to affect farmers in Oklahoma,
as well as high school students in Los Angeles and
congressmen in Washington. D.C.
Of course. Kroetch, the national coordinator of
Bike Aid, isn't doing this all by herself. She is one of
hundreds of people from across the country involved
in Bike Aid, a bike-a-thon of magnificent propor
tions. This June, for the second straight year, 150
Bike Aid riders will spend nine weeks cycling across
the country. Their goal is to raise money through
pledges — often of a penny per mile — to fight
poverty and hunger both in the U.S. and abroad.
They also will strive to raise the awareness of and in
volvement with these issues among people that they
will meet along the way. This year 14 Stanford stu
dents will be among the group of riders ready to give
up 3 lucrative summer job for two months on a
bicycle seat.
For some, the initial draw was the cycling aspect.
"First I wanted to do it for selfish reasons,said
Emily Ellison, a graduating senior who has always
wanted to bike across the country.
But then, she added that, "Taking a civil
rights/civil liberties class made me stop and think
about the issue of poverty — and this is a very direct
way that I can help."
There's no denying that it will be a long, hard ride.
Bikers will start from Portland, Ore., Seattle, Wash.,
San Francisco, Los Angeles and Austin, Texas, and
after riding about 80 miles a day — a total of approxi
mately 3,600 miles on most routes - will end their
trip together in Washington, D.C., where they hope
to attract the interest of politicians.
"Avid cyclists have nothing to do with Bike Aid be

cause we're not fast enough," said Kroetch. who rode
last summer and is now one of the national coordina
tors. This year's riders range in age from 15 to 60;
some have done a lot of cycling and some have hardly
ever been on a bike before, according to junior Andy
Merritt, who led the San Francisco group last year.
Merritt added that everyone races for the first few
days before realizing that there's no need to hurry
and that it's better to relax and enjoy the country.
"Last year we got lost in Marin the first day — that
slowed everyone down because there was no place to
race to."
More important than the athletic aspect of the trip
to the Bike Aiders is talking with the people of the
communities that they ride through. "Our goal is to
create an awareness in our own country of global
poverty and hunger." Kroetch said.
The bikers reach out by sponsoring "grass roots"
projects that involve people in the United States, as
well as people in developing nations. Events are or
ganized in each community for the riders to tell
about their projects, rather than to teach or to
"appeal to base emotions with pictures of crying
babies," Kroetch said.
Last year Bike Aid raised $100,000, which was
funneled into a variety of small projects. Fifty percent
went into a "matching fund" for chapters of the Over
seas Development Network, a nationwide organiza
tion of student groups that sponsors Bike Aid. This
fund helps groups keep up their morale by doubling
their fund-raising efforts; for instance, if a chapter
wanted to sponser a $7,000 project, it would only
have to raise $3,500 and Bike Aid would pay the rest.
Another 30 percent of the money raised went to
other organizations that share the Bike Aid self-help
philosophy. For example, one project, called Coconut
Jam, was funded through the International Develop
ment Exchange. This involved teaching farmers in
Pansol, the Philippines, who live on land that is not
easily irrigated, to make products from coconuts

that can be sold in village markets. The extra money
generated supplements the farmers' meager income
during the dry season. Helping this community to
become more self-sufficient took only $2,837 in Bike
Aid money.
The rest of the money is spent in the United States.
Ten percent goes to sponsor student internships and
10 percent goes to projects that fight poverty in Ap
palachia. Kroetch expressed hope for the project.
"Maybe we can't change the world, but we can spark
something In some communities," she said.
In the spirit of what Kroetch calls the "non-glitzy

approach," the riders do service projects during their
trip. "The thing that attracts me most is the five-day
rest period, where we work in, say. a soup kitchen in
Tulsa or a battered women's shelter in Oklahoma
City," said Chris Sliney, a 1986 Stanford graduate
who will be riding the Los Angeles route.
Perhaps the people who will be most profoundly af
fected by Bike Aid are the riders themselves.
Kroetch's administrative duties will keep her from
riding this summer, and she is "completely jealous"
of those who will be sweating on the Bike Aid trail.
Louder than words, she said, "experience speaks."

"First I wanted to do it for selfish reasons,said
Emily Ellison, a graduating senior who has always
wanted to bike across the country.
But then, she added that, "Taking a civil
rights/civil liberties class made me stop and think
about the issue of poverty — and this is a very direct
way that I can help."
There's no denying that it will be a long, hard ride.
Bikers will start from Portland, Ore., Seattle, Wash.,
San Francisco, Los Angeles and Austin, Texas, and
after riding about 80 miles a day — a total of approxi
mately 3,600 miles on most routes - will end their
trip together in Washington, D.C., where they hope
to attract the interest of politicians.
"Avid cyclists have nothing to do with Bike Aid be

cause we're not fast enough," said Kroetch. who rode
last summer and is now one of the national coordina
tors. This year's riders range in age from 15 to 60;
some have done a lot of cycling and some have hardly
ever been on a bike before, according to junior Andy
Merritt, who led the San Francisco group last year.
Merritt added that everyone races for the first few
days before realizing that there's no need to hurry
and that it's better to relax and enjoy the country.
"Last year we got lost in Marin the first day — that
slowed everyone down because there was no place to
race to."
More important than the athletic aspect of the trip
to the Bike Aiders is talking with the people of the
communities that they ride through. "Our goal is to
create an awareness in our own country of global
poverty and hunger." Kroetch said.
The bikers reach out by sponsoring "grass roots"
projects that involve people in the United States, as
well as people in developing nations. Events are or
ganized in each community for the riders to tell
about their projects, rather than to teach or to
"appeal to base emotions with pictures of crying
babies," Kroetch said.
Last year Bike Aid raised $100,000, which was
funneled into a variety of small projects. Fifty percent
went into a "matching fund" for chapters of the Over
seas Development Network, a nationwide organiza
tion of student groups that sponsors Bike Aid. This
fund helps groups keep up their morale by doubling
their fund-raising efforts; for instance, if a chapter
wanted to sponser a $7,000 project, it would only
have to raise $3,500 and Bike Aid would pay the rest.
Another 30 percent of the money raised went to
other organizations that share the Bike Aid self-help
philosophy. For example, one project, called Coconut
Jam, was funded through the International Develop
ment Exchange. This involved teaching farmers in
Pansol, the Philippines, who live on land that is not
easily irrigated, to make products from coconuts

that can be sold in village markets. The extra money
generated supplements the farmers' meager income
during the dry season. Helping this community to
become more self-sufficient took only $2,837 in Bike
Aid money.
The rest of the money is spent in the United States.
Ten percent goes to sponsor student internships and
10 percent goes to projects that fight poverty in Ap
palachia. Kroetch expressed hope for the project.
"Maybe we can't change the world, but we can spark
something In some communities," she said.
In the spirit of what Kroetch calls the "non-glitzy

approach," the riders do service projects during their
trip. "The thing that attracts me most is the five-day
rest period, where we work in, say. a soup kitchen in
Tulsa or a battered women's shelter in Oklahoma
City," said Chris Sliney, a 1986 Stanford graduate
who will be riding the Los Angeles route.
Perhaps the people who will be most profoundly af
fected by Bike Aid are the riders themselves.
Kroetch's administrative duties will keep her from
riding this summer, and she is "completely jealous"
of those who will be sweating on the Bike Aid trail.
Louder than words, she said, "experience speaks."
