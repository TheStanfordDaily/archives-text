# Horse show starts equestrians off on the right hoof
## 
### AIMEE BERZINS 
Several milestones were crossed this
past weekend at Stanford. Most notable
was the celebration marking the 100 th
anniversary of the laying of the Univer
sity's cornerstone. Another important
event, however, took place Sunday at the
Stanford Barn.
While it was not on quite as grand a
scale as Stanford's 100 th birthday, it was,
nonetheless, just as significant for those
involved — the Stanford equestrian team

hosted its first-ever intercollegiate horse
show. Riders came from Cal Poly. Pomona
and the University of California-Davis to
compete in English and Western riding
and jumping.
While it was relatively a small show, it
was a very important step for Stanford's
first equestrian team. Half the team's 15
members competed.
Betty Carmichael. a riding instructor at
Stanford for two years and the team's
coach, called the show a success. Having
ridden in her first horse show in 1939.

Carmichael is a veteran in the business,
and has devoted her life to showing
horses.
"It takes a large amount of devotion to
be involved in this business. The team
members have put a lot of time, energy
and physical labor into the program, and
in preparation for the competition," Car
michael said.
But the effort paid off, she added. "The
horses looked gorgeous, the jumps looked
good and most importantly, the other
teams looked pleased — which means

they will come back again."
For freshman Christy Brady, her first
intercollegiate competition "was very ex
citing." Not only was she the winner in
the hunt/seat equitation competition,
but she was able to win it riding a
borrowed horse named "Mr. T." Brady ex
plained that the name stands for "Mr.
Toads Wild Ride" at Disneyland, and
refers to the horse's often "flighty" behav
ior.
Brady said she is looking forward to
more competitions in the future, when

the Stanford team may have its own com
petition horses.
The idea for developing an equestrian
team as a school sport can be credited to
junior Lisa Yanney. Currently the team
captain, she also won Sunday's
hunter/hack competition.
Having ridden since the age of five, Yan
ney is one of the team's most experienced
members. She was inspired to form an
equestrian team while, as a Stanford stu-
dent, she traveled on her own to
compete at various regional
shows.
"I knew it would make such a
difference to be able to compete as
part of a team. Competition
becomes a group effort as well as
an individual one when you are a
part of a team, and is so much
more exciting and supportive,"
Yanney said.
The team formed last year after
a successful fund-raiser held at
the Stanford Barn, but the team
was not fully recognized as an offi
cial club sport until last fall.
"The team has come a long way
in a very short period of time, but
still has a long way to go," Yanney
said. "We started out a ground
zero — with no one, and we now

have a competitive team, which is
very exciting. Our goal is to even
tually have our own team horses
so we can travel to compete
(elsewhere)."
Right now the team trains on
Stanford horses, which are
needed every day for the physical
education classes and riding les
sons. One of the biggest problems
the team Is facing is how to raise
the money needed to meet the
demands of the sport.

Stanford's equestrian team is riding
high.

"We cannot travel to compete at
other shows because we cannot
take the school's lesson horses on
the road," Yanney said. "It takes a
lot of money to purchase and
maintain horses, and we are con
stantly working to raise enough
for the team to buy [its] own."

Right now the only financial
support the team receives comes
from hosting horse shows and ac
cepting donations. Next year, after
its trial year as a team is over, it
hopes to receive some funding
from the club sports program as
well.
One of the biggest improve
ments the team looks forward to is
the construction of a new barn
next year, which was made possi
ble by a large private donation.

The new barn will replace the
existing structure, which has
been there for well over three
quarters of a century. The new
building will allow room for new
horses to be stabled together, and
will have a section specifically for
the equestrian team.
