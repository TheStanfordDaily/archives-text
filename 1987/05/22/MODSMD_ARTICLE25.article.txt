# Horse show starts equestrians off on the right hoof

### AIMEE BERZINS 
Several milestones were crossed this
past weekend at Stanford. Most notable
was the celebration marking the 100 th
anniversary of the laying of the Univer
sity's cornerstone. Another important
event, however, took place Sunday at the
Stanford Barn.
While it was not on quite as grand a
scale as Stanford's 100 th birthday, it was,
nonetheless, just as significant for those
involved — the Stanford equestrian team

hosted its first-ever intercollegiate horse
show. Riders came from Cal Poly. Pomona
and the University of California-Davis to
compete in English and Western riding
and jumping.
While it was relatively a small show, it
was a very important step for Stanford's
first equestrian team. Half the team's 15
members competed.
Betty Carmichael. a riding instructor at
Stanford for two years and the team's
coach, called the show a success. Having
ridden in her first horse show in 1939.

Carmichael is a veteran in the business,
and has devoted her life to showing
horses.
"It takes a large amount of devotion to
be involved in this business. The team
members have put a lot of time, energy
and physical labor into the program, and
in preparation for the competition," Car
michael said.
But the effort paid off, she added. "The
horses looked gorgeous, the jumps looked
good and most importantly, the other
teams looked pleased — which means

they will come back again."
For freshman Christy Brady, her first
intercollegiate competition "was very ex
citing." Not only was she the winner in
the hunt/seat equitation competition,
but she was able to win it riding a
borrowed horse named "Mr. T." Brady ex
plained that the name stands for "Mr.
Toads Wild Ride" at Disneyland, and
refers to the horse's often "flighty" behav
ior.
Brady said she is looking forward to
more competitions in the future, when

the Stanford team may have its own com
petition horses.
The idea for developing an equestrian
team as a school sport can be credited to
junior Lisa Yanney. Currently the team
captain, she also won Sunday's
hunter/hack competition.
Having ridden since the age of five, Yan
ney is one of the team's most experienced
members. She was inspired to form an
equestrian team while, as a Stanford stu-
