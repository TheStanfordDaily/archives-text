## Card hosts battle for World Series berth 
### TOM SENF Senior staff writer 
For the West I Regional coaches,
yesterday's pre-tournament press
conference was poor-mouthing
time.
University of California-Santa
Barbara Coach A 1 Ferrer got
things rolling. "We're excited to be
here, but I'm not sure we deserve
to be here," he said. "In confer
ence (the Pacific Coast Athletic As
sociation) we did not do a good
job."
Then came Minnesota Coach
John Anderson. "We hit a little
bit, pitch a little bit, but we don't
have a pro prospect." he said.
Next up. fresh off the practice
field, was Washington State
Coach Chuck Brayton. "There's
probably not a star in the bunch,"
he said of his Cougars. "We've got
young guys playing over their
heads, and that's the only way to
explain it."
Wichita State Coach Gene Step
henson caught on fast. "To listen
to the other guys, you would think
they had no talent and got here on
coaching alone, so 1 guess I'll join
the parade," he said.
Which he did.
"We have a team with no super
stars. We're very small, but we're
slow," Stephenson said of a team
that hit 81 homers and stole 208
bases this year.
But don't expect mediocre
baseball to be the norm this
weekend at Sunken Diamond.
The six teams bring a combined
255-1 14-2 record into the regional
and all have team batting averages
of over .300.
Washington State (42-17) and
Oral Roberts (45-17) open the
tournament at 9 a.m. today, fol
lowed by Wichita State (58-18)
and UCSB (30-23-2) at 12:30 p.m.
and Stanford (44-16) vs. Minne
sota (36-23) at 4 p.m.
"I can't think of a tougher
regional than this," Stanford
Coach Mark Marquess said. "All
have outstanding hitting teams
and played tough schedules."
No one played a tougher confer
ence schedule than Stanford,
which captured the Pacific 10

Southern Division title by five
games with a 21-9 record.
"By playing the UCLAs and the
Trojans (USC) and the Arizonas,
they make themselves into good
ballclubs." Brayton said of Stan
ford and the Six-Pac. "Stanford is
ranked (second), they're in their
home ballpark, so they're the fa
vorite."
Indeed. Stanford would seem to

'We have a team with no super
stars. We're very small, but we're
slow.'
— Wichita State Coach Gene Stephenson,
whose team hit 81 homers and stole 208
bases this year

be the team to beat, especially at
Sunken Diamond, where the
Cardinal went 14-1 in conference
play this year. "We don't win all
our games in Sunken Diamond,
but we win our share," Marquess
said.
This year's Cardinal may not
have the firepower or pitching
stars of Stanford's last six regional
teams, but the 1987 squad has
been exceptional for its consis
tency and pitching depth. "It's
probably the most balanced team
we've had," Marquess said. "All
phases of our game are pretty
solid."
In the six-team regional format,
a team could have to play as many
as five games in four days, placing
a premium on pitching depth.
"You can get by in the College
World Series with three pitchers,
but you can't get there," Marquess
said.
Another key for the Cardinal, as
senior center fielder Toi Cook
pointed out, is that Stanford's es
tablished players have had good
years while more surprising
sources have made crucial contri
butions as well.

Stanford expected and got solid
performances from Cook (.326
average. 10 HRs, 55 RBIs. 62
runs), left fielder Ruben Amaro
(.351, 44 walks, 31 steals. 68
runs), third baseman Ed Sprague
(.331. 14 HRs. 64 RBIs) and
pitchers Jack McDowell (9-4, 4.37
ERA), Lee Plemel (8-5. 3.37) and
Rob Wassenaar (7-1. 2.56).
But equally important for the

Cardinal have been the contribu
tions of shortstop David Esquer
(.327), first baseman Ron Wit
meyer (8 HRs, 54 RBIs), freshman
outfielder Paul Carey (.332. 10
HRs. 45 RBIs) and reliever Steve
Chitren (6-3, 3.34, 11 saves).
Of Carey and fellow freshman
Brian Johnson, Cook said: "Those
guys have a lot of talent. In two
years, they probably won't remem
ber me when I come back here.
Paul Carey already outhit me as a
freshman, and he needs only four
more homers (to match Cook's
career total)."
Minnesota gets the privilege of
facing Cook, Carey and company
first. The Gophers won the West
Division of the Big Ten Confer
ence but lost their first two games
in the conference tournament to
Purdue and No. 1 1 Michigan. Min
nesota got off to a fast start this
year at home, but was quickly
humbled during a 2-10 spring
road trip that included stops at
top-ranked Texas and defending
national champion Arizona.
"We had a rough go." Anderson
said. "We came back to reality."

Minnesota is a fairly balanced
team, hitting .319 while leading
the Big Ten in ERA. The Gophers'
top offensive threat is sophomore
left fielder Jay Kvasnicka, who hit
.378. Minnesota hit only 37
homers this year, led by shortstop
Jay Anderson with eight.
Junior right-hander Darren
Knight will start today against
Stanford. Knight's 4-4 record and
6.65 ERA may seem unim
pressive. but he went 3-1 with a
3.43 ERA in Big Ten play and also
held powerful UCLA to two runs in
a 2-0 Gopher loss to 'he Bruins
April 4 in Minneapolis.
McDowell will start today for
Stanford with Plemel going tomor
row. Plemel opened postseason
play for the Cardinal last year at
Oklahoma State, but Marquess
will send his two-time All Six-Pac
selection to the mound today in
stead.

"We think he's throwing the
best right now, so we'll go with
him," Marquess said. McDowell
may be available if necessary on
Monday as well.
Regardless of today's outcome.
Stanford will face either UCSB or
Wichita State tomorrow, but Cook
would be much more comfortable
if the Cardinal did it without a
loss — and not just because losing
would force Stanford to play at 9
a.m.
"We have to win the first game,"
he said. "Wichita State's stats are
awesome, and Santa Barbara beat
us two out of three."
Washington State beat Oral
Roberts 14-13 on the road on
March 18. and a football score is
likely again today.
Oral Roberts hit .331 as a team,
led by catcher Pete Schmidt at
.457 and outfielder Adam Casillas
at .407, but the Titans may need

some divine intervention if their
suspect pitching staff (5.46 ERA)
hopes to contain the Cougars'
potent senior trio of Jeff Hooper
(.364, 19 HRs, 76 RBIs), Rob
Smith (.362, 16, 57) and Mike
Meyers (.360. 16. 57).
It is hard to imagine neither
Wichita State nor UCSB making a
serious run for the regional title,
but the loser of their game today
may be making a quick exit.
Should Stanford beat Minnesota,
the Cardinal will face the loser of
the Shockers-Gauchos contest.
UCSB finished only third in the
PCAA, but made the regional field
on the strength of its non
conference schedule, which in
cluded a 4-2 record against Texas
and Stanford. Wichita State, by
contrast, piled up 40 wins in 50
non-league games, such as a 35-0,
11 -0 home doubleheader sweep of
powerful Kansas-Wesleyan.

freshman, and he needs only four
more homers (to match Cook's
career total)."
Minnesota gets the privilege of
facing Cook, Carey and company
first. The Gophers won the West
Division of the Big Ten Confer
ence but lost their first two games
in the conference tournament to
Purdue and No. 1 1 Michigan. Min
nesota got off to a fast start this
year at home, but was quickly
humbled during a 2-10 spring
road trip that included stops at
top-ranked Texas and defending
national champion Arizona.
"We had a rough go." Anderson
said. "We came back to reality."

Minnesota is a fairly balanced
team, hitting .319 while leading
the Big Ten in ERA. The Gophers'
top offensive threat is sophomore
left fielder Jay Kvasnicka, who hit
.378. Minnesota hit only 37
homers this year, led by shortstop
Jay Anderson with eight.
Junior right-hander Darren
Knight will start today against
Stanford. Knight's 4-4 record and
6.65 ERA may seem unim
pressive. but he went 3-1 with a
3.43 ERA in Big Ten play and also
held powerful UCLA to two runs in
a 2-0 Gopher loss to 'he Bruins
April 4 in Minneapolis.
McDowell will start today for
Stanford with Plemel going tomor
row. Plemel opened postseason
play for the Cardinal last year at
Oklahoma State, but Marquess
will send his two-time All Six-Pac
selection to the mound today in
stead.

"We think he's throwing the
best right now, so we'll go with
him," Marquess said. McDowell
may be available if necessary on
Monday as well.
Regardless of today's outcome.
Stanford will face either UCSB or
Wichita State tomorrow, but Cook
would be much more comfortable
if the Cardinal did it without a
loss — and not just because losing
would force Stanford to play at 9
a.m.
"We have to win the first game,"
he said. "Wichita State's stats are
awesome, and Santa Barbara beat
us two out of three."
Washington State beat Oral
Roberts 14-13 on the road on
March 18. and a football score is
likely again today.
Oral Roberts hit .331 as a team,
led by catcher Pete Schmidt at
.457 and outfielder Adam Casillas
at .407, but the Titans may need

some divine intervention if their
suspect pitching staff (5.46 ERA)
hopes to contain the Cougars'
potent senior trio of Jeff Hooper
(.364, 19 HRs, 76 RBIs), Rob
Smith (.362, 16, 57) and Mike
Meyers (.360. 16. 57).
It is hard to imagine neither
Wichita State nor UCSB making a
serious run for the regional title,
but the loser of their game today
may be making a quick exit.
Should Stanford beat Minnesota,
the Cardinal will face the loser of
the Shockers-Gauchos contest.
UCSB finished only third in the
PCAA, but made the regional field
on the strength of its non
conference schedule, which in
cluded a 4-2 record against Texas
and Stanford. Wichita State, by
contrast, piled up 40 wins in 50
non-league games, such as a 35-0,
11 -0 home doubleheader sweep of
powerful Kansas-Wesleyan.

Stanford Coach Mark Marquess assessed his second-ranked Cardinal squad at yesterday's press confer
ence. "It's probably the most balanced team we've had," Marquess said. "All phases of our game are pretty
solid."
For the West I Regional coaches,
yesterday's pre-tournament press
conference was poor-mouthing
time.
University of California-Santa
Barbara Coach A 1 Ferrer got
things rolling. "We're excited to be
here, but I'm not sure we deserve
to be here," he said. "In confer
ence (the Pacific Coast Athletic As
sociation) we did not do a good
job."
Then came Minnesota Coach
John Anderson. "We hit a little
bit, pitch a little bit, but we don't
have a pro prospect." he said.
Next up. fresh off the practice
field, was Washington State
Coach Chuck Brayton. "There's
probably not a star in the bunch,"
he said of his Cougars. "We've got
young guys playing over their
heads, and that's the only way to
explain it."
Wichita State Coach Gene Step
henson caught on fast. "To listen
to the other guys, you would think
they had no talent and got here on
coaching alone, so 1 guess I'll join
the parade," he said.
Which he did.
"We have a team with no super
stars. We're very small, but we're
slow," Stephenson said of a team
that hit 81 homers and stole 208
bases this year.
But don't expect mediocre
baseball to be the norm this
weekend at Sunken Diamond.
The six teams bring a combined
255-1 14-2 record into the regional
and all have team batting averages
of over .300.
Washington State (42-17) and
Oral Roberts (45-17) open the
tournament at 9 a.m. today, fol
lowed by Wichita State (58-18)
and UCSB (30-23-2) at 12:30 p.m.
and Stanford (44-16) vs. Minne
sota (36-23) at 4 p.m.
"I can't think of a tougher
regional than this," Stanford
Coach Mark Marquess said. "All
have outstanding hitting teams
and played tough schedules."
No one played a tougher confer
ence schedule than Stanford,
which captured the Pacific 10

Southern Division title by five
games with a 21-9 record.
"By playing the UCLAs and the
Trojans (USC) and the Arizonas,
they make themselves into good
ballclubs." Brayton said of Stan
ford and the Six-Pac. "Stanford is
ranked (second), they're in their
home ballpark, so they're the fa
vorite."
Indeed. Stanford would seem to

'We have a team with no super
stars. We're very small, but we're
slow.'
— Wichita State Coach Gene Stephenson,
whose team hit 81 homers and stole 208
bases this year

be the team to beat, especially at
Sunken Diamond, where the
Cardinal went 14-1 in conference
play this year. "We don't win all
our games in Sunken Diamond,
but we win our share," Marquess
said.
This year's Cardinal may not
have the firepower or pitching
stars of Stanford's last six regional
teams, but the 1987 squad has
been exceptional for its consis
tency and pitching depth. "It's
probably the most balanced team
we've had," Marquess said. "All
phases of our game are pretty
solid."
In the six-team regional format,
a team could have to play as many
as five games in four days, placing
a premium on pitching depth.
"You can get by in the College
World Series with three pitchers,
but you can't get there," Marquess
said.
Another key for the Cardinal, as
senior center fielder Toi Cook
pointed out, is that Stanford's es
tablished players have had good
years while more surprising
sources have made crucial contri
butions as well.

Stanford expected and got solid
performances from Cook (.326
average. 10 HRs, 55 RBIs. 62
runs), left fielder Ruben Amaro
(.351, 44 walks, 31 steals. 68
runs), third baseman Ed Sprague
(.331. 14 HRs. 64 RBIs) and
pitchers Jack McDowell (9-4, 4.37
ERA), Lee Plemel (8-5. 3.37) and
Rob Wassenaar (7-1. 2.56).
But equally important for the

Cardinal have been the contribu
tions of shortstop David Esquer
(.327), first baseman Ron Wit
meyer (8 HRs, 54 RBIs), freshman
outfielder Paul Carey (.332. 10
HRs. 45 RBIs) and reliever Steve
Chitren (6-3, 3.34, 11 saves).
Of Carey and fellow freshman
Brian Johnson, Cook said: "Those
guys have a lot of talent. In two
years, they probably won't remem
ber me when I come back here.
Paul Carey already outhit me as a
freshman, and he needs only four
more homers (to match Cook's
career total)."
