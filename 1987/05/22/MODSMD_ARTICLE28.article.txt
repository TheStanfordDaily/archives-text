# Cardinal heads to Pac-10s
## 
### ERIK STEN Editorial staff 
Stanford track is definitely on the rise.
This, however, won't be the year the
team makes it to the top.
In last year's Pacific 10 Conference
championships, the men's squad
finished seventh. Seventh may not
sound like much, but for Stanford the
accomplishment was significant. It was
the first time in nearly a decade that the
Cardinal hadn't ended the season in the
cellar. And with four of the nation's top
10 teams competing In the Pac-10 last
year, seventh was a respectable finish, a
good base from which to climb.
This weekend in Corvallis, Ore., Stan
ford will begin and most likely end the
conference finale in about the same po
sition. The team is hampered by a lack
of depth and a small sprint crew, but a
strong Cardinal distance corps and good
group of field athletes should be enough
to push the team to another middle-of
the-pack finish, but probably not much
higher.
Don't expect a stunning improve
ment, but do look for the team to make
up some more ground on UCLA, Wash
ington State and the other national
powers of the Pac-10.
"We'll be looking to move up to sixth or
so," Stanford Asst. Coach Scott Chisam
said. "Everyone's healthy, so we should
be able to score about 40 to 50 points."
Last year's 37 points were good for
seventh, so if Chisam's prediction is
right, the team should improve.
In the women's competition, the Card
inal has no record to better. Until last

year, the conference was spilt Into two
divisions, each of which staged a sepa
rate meet. This year the Pac-10 will in
augurate a complete women's champi
onship.
Oregon and USC, the champions of
last year's Northern Pacific and Pacific
West meets, look to be in the driver's
seat again this weekend. The Cardinal,
with only eight women athletes compet
ing, should turn in some strong individ
ual performances, but almost certainly
won't have the numbers to finish much
higher than seventh or eighth.
As Chisam pointed out, "You can't go
with eight people and expect to kill."
In the men's competition, the bulk of
the Stanford points should come from
distance runners Christian Skoog, Marc
Olesen and Charles Alexander, pole vaul
ter John Gash, discus thrower Glenn
Schneider and high jumper Brian Mar
shall.
Marshall, the Cardinal's only defend
ing meet champion, is currently ranked
fourth in the conference with a season
best jump of 7-foot-l and 1/2. The
junior, however, has a lifetime best of 7-
4 and 1/4, was fourth in last year's
NCAA championships and is expected to
challenge Washington's Rick Noji, the
conference leader at 7-5.
Gash, the school record holder at 17-8
and 1/2, and Schneider, a sophomore
with a best of 189-9, will both be com
peting in two wide open events. Each
has the potential to come in anywhere
from first to sixth. How high they finish
will go a long way toward determining
the team's final placing.
The closest thing Stanford has to sure

points will come in the distances. Both
Olesen in the 1,500 meters and Skoog in
the 800 could easily be considered the
favorites. Although neither runner has
the conference's best time, each has
been running extremely well and has
beaten many of the runner's in the field.
According to Chisam, "It will take
somebody running unreal to beat Marc
or Skoog." Also expected to score will be
Alexander in the 5,000.
For the women, the points will come
from Carol Gray, Patty Purpur, Pam
Board and Erica Wheeler. In the run
ning events, the points will come from
Gray in the 3,000 and possibly the 5,000
and Board in the 400 hurdles.
On the field. Wheeler, who is just now
warming up after returning from an in
jury. should place high in the javelin.
The sophomore currently has a season
best of 168-10 and could be ready to
move up dramatically.
In the discus and shotput, sophomore
Purpur, ranked sixth and third
respectively with marks of 170-2 and 51 -
7, should be another sure bet to finish
in at least the top six in each event.
Missing from the women's squad will
be Lisa Bernhagen. the nation's leading
high jumper, who is still recovering from
a foot injury suffered two weeks ago.
Both squads will enter a sprint and
mile relay, but Stanford will have no in
dividual sprinters. Back and healthy for
the Cardinal will be freshman Gus En
vela, the anchor of both men's relays.
Envela had been held out of competition
since pulling a hamstring over a month
ago.
