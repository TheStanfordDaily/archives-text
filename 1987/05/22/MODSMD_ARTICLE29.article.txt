# The
						Major Leagues can't wait for McDowell
## 
### SUSAN SLUSSER Editorial staff 
Following his senior year at
Notre Dame High School In Sher
man Oaks, Jack McDowell was se
lected by the Boston Red Sox In
the 20th round of the June 1984
draft. Had the right-hander
signed with the Bosox, in other
words, he might have been pitch
ing for the American League
champions in the World Series
last fail.
Instead, the lanky (6-foot-5,
185-pound) McDowell is looking
toward a different World Series
that is in a somewhat less exotic
location — Omaha, Neb. — but is
equally important to the Stanford
Junior. "I'm happy where 1 am
now," McDowell said. "I don't
think I lost much by not signing
out of high school. I'd like to think
I could have been there (with Bos
ton at the World Series), but hope
fully we (Stanford) will win the na
tional championship. A lot of
people don't get to do that much."
Right now, the West I Regional
this weekend at Sunken Diamond
is McDowell's primary concern, as
he takes the mound this after
noon against Minnesota. "I'm
excited, I'm really excited," he
said. "We have a good chance In
the tournament. ... We should be
favored — we're at home and we're
the top seed."
If the Cardinal wins the
regional, the team will advance to
the College World Series In
Omaha, which begins May 29 and
continues through June 7. Coin
ciding with the championship
tournament is the Major League
baseball draft, which will be held
June 2.
This time around, McDowell will
be drafted much higher than the
20th round. In fact, Baseball
America magazine picked
McDowell to be among the top 10
choices in the draft.
"He's one of the top quality
pitchers in the country," said Dick
Bovard of the Oakland A's player
development department. "We
definitely have an Interest in him.
He could possibly be a top selec
tion for us — and for a lot of other
clubs, too."
"He's one of the better pitchers
in all of college," Stanford Coach
Mark Marquess agreed. "He'll be a
high draft choice this June. He'll
definitely go in the first round —
he's one of the best."
Even Pacific 10 Southern Divi
sion foes agree. "He's overpower
ing," said California Coach Bob
Milano, whose Bears are a path
etic 0-6 in three seasons against
McDowell. "He's improved every
year with his command of his
pitches. ... By the end of this
year, he has a chance to be a major
league pitcher if he goes pro.
"He's pitched very well against
us." Milano continued."We've hit

him, we've scored runs consis
tently against him, but in the
clutch he puts the hammer down
and doesn't allow us enough runs
to win."
Milano's memory may have
failed him — Cal hasn't had the
easiest time in the world scoring
runs on the Stanford ace. Two of
McDowell's six complete games
this season came against the
Bears — and in both of those con
tests, he held California to just
one run.
But Cal Is not the only team
McDowell has victimized. The Van
Nuys native is 19-8 lifetime
against the conference that is gen
erally considered the toughest In
the country, and this year
McDowell led the team in wins
(seven), innings pitched (77.2),
strikeouts (81) and complete
games (five) In Pac-10 play.
Thus it came as no surprise
when McDowell was named to the
All-Pac-10 team Tuesday for the
second consecutive year.
McDowell, also a preseason All-
America, was 9-4 overall with a
4.37 ERA and 93 strikeouts
during the regular season. In just
three years, the right-hander is
second all-time In career wins
with 31, strikeouts with 310, and
innings pitched with 358.2.
McDowell is just six strikeouts
away from breaking the school
record of 315 set by Jeff Ballard,
who will be the Baltimore Orioles'
starting pitcher Sunday at Oak
land.
So the question all year has
been: When will McDowell join
former teammate Ballard in the
professional ranks?
"Chances are I'm going to go,"
said the junior, who needs only
two more quarters to graduate. He
plans to finish his communica
tion degree in the next two fall
quarters should he sign a pro con
tract. "I'll probably sign at the end
of the season. . . . Right now, for
me, it's baseball in the short run,
and I'm looking at that. If my best
opportunity is to leave right now,
that's my primary goal."
"The chances are really good,"
fellow pitcher Lee Plemel said. "As
long as he stays healthy, he has a
shot at being in the bigs by Sep
tember when they expand the
roster."
Staying healthy has been a con
cern for McDowell this year after
suffering shoulder problems near
the end of last season. "I abused it
last year," McDowell explained. "I
was Just not being smart. I was
just doing too much — not in
games, but outside of that — extra
throwing, extra strain. It took its
toll. I was pitching a lot of in
nings."
Still, last year's sore arm wasn't
all bad. "I appreciate how I feel
now," McDowell admitted. "I'm
going to take better care of my arm
from here on out, so maybe it was

a blessing in disguise."
Even better is the fact that
McDowell is now back at 100 per
cent. "It hasn't bothered me at all,
once I took off time and
rehabilitated it. . . . I'm really
happy with the way it feels."
A freak injury before the season
nearly put an end to McDowell's
career. On Dec. 23, the Stanford
ace required 300 stitches in his
forehead and face after being hit
with a flower pot thrown from the
balcony of a Westwood apartment.
Trying to come back too fast from
that injury, which left a four-inch
scar around his left eyebrow and
nose — a half an inch away from
his eye — McDowell pulled a groin
muscle, which hampered him
somewhat in the early part of the
season.
As a result, the Cardinal hurler
got off to a slow start, but finished
strong, winning his last three
starts and four of his last five out
ings. Still, McDowell is not altoge
ther pleased with his pitching this
season. "I'm not happy with the

way my personal performance has
gone," he said. "I'm not having
year I'm capable of having. Still,
there's a long way to go."
As far as the team is concerned,
however, McDowell has blossomed
at the right time. "Now he's at his
peak," Plemel said. "When we got
into league, he really started
pitching. . . . He had trouble early
because he hadn't thrown. Now
he's 100 percent, and he's been
getting stronger all year."
"He's pitching his best right
now," Marquess said. "This is the
best year he's had, considering
everything he's had to overcome."
All of the above does not bode
well for Minnesota and any other
teams McDowell might face in the
postseason. (He's slated to start
Monday if favorite Stanford makes
it that far.) His blazing fastball is
one of the best in the country,
consistently over 90 mph, and he
has a good, hard slider to go along
with it.
"I'm a power pitcher," McDowell
said. "There's no question. I go

after the hitters with my fastball;
that's my bread and butter."
"Jack is a great, great pitcher,"
Stanford outfielder Toi Cook said.
"He has a good fastball and slider
and he dominates the plate when
he pitches well. He's an aggressive
person — he goes after the hitter.
"He's not like a gerbil; he doesn't
nibble around the plate," Cook
said.
Sometimes this aggressiveness
has been termed hot-tempered by
the opposition, however. "He has
a tendency to allow his emotions
to control his physical abilities."
Cal's Milano said.
But the pros see this aspect of
McDowell's personality a bit differ
ently. "We like his competitive
spirit," Brovard said. "We think
that only makes him that much
better. I don't think he does any
thing detrimental to his pitch
ing."
"He's a competitor," said Stan
ford catcher Doug Robbins,
McDowell's battery mate. "One of
his strengths is that he gets

people fired up and gives them a
motive to play harder."
"He's like Boston's Roger
Clemens," Stanford pitcher Rob
Wassenaar said. "If we ever had a
losing streak, he'd be the one to
break it."
Meanwhile, the versatile
McDowell, who played an inning
at third base against Arizona ear
lier in the year, can be seen co
hosting "Inside Stanford Sports"
on student station XTV along with
roommate Paul Marca. "I might be
interested in broadcast jour
nalism," he said. "It's not as easy
as it looks."
But before broadcasting,
McDowell has a career in profes
sional baseball to look forward to.
"He's been really blessed." Was
senaar said. "He's a great talent
and a really top-notch competitor.
Out of anyone on our team, he's
got the best shot — he has a
major-league arm and he's fairly
polished.
"He's got a bright future ahead
of him."


Covering first base may not be Jack McDowell's forte, but pitching
definitely is. The Cardinal ace is sure to be a high pick in the June 2

Barry Satk/Daily file
professional draft Today, however, McDowell will only be thinking
about Minnesota in a 4 p.m. contest at Sunken Diamond.
