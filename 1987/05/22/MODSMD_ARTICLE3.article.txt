# Student wrath leads to grape removal
## 
### A.J. THOMAS Senior staff writer 
Responding to student con
cerns over pesticide dangers. Uni
versity Food Service announced
yesterday that it will not serve or
buy table grapes for the remainder
of the academic year.
Members of the ASSU Senate,
MEChA and both the incoming
and outgoing Council of Presi
dents (COP) met with University
Food Service Director James
Keeton yesterday afternoon to dis
cuss health risks associated with
the use of certain pesticides and
the senate's support of a statewide
grape boycott led by the United
Farm Workers (UFW).
Keeton said the strength of stu

dent concern was the "foremost"
motivation behind the decision
not to serve grapes. The decision,
however, will not affect menus for
summer conferences. Keeton said.
ASSU Senator Stacey Leyton
said the meeting was "definitely a
positive step." but added that ulti
mately the student groups want
the University to take an official
stand supporting the grape
boycott.
Outgoing COP member Rudy
Fuentes also found the decision
encouraging. "We would hope it
would lead to support of the
boycott, but probably they will
support the student Initiative to
support the boycott, which is just
as effective."
The senate passed a resolution
May 5 recommending that all Uni
versity food service groups
"remove fresh table grapes from
campus until the UFW officially
calls an end to the boycott."
Leyton said the boycott sprang
from concern over "potentially
long-term health risks" to farm
workers and their children from
pesticides, as well as harmful ef
fects for consumers of sprayed
grapes.

Keeton said Food Service has
not been serving grapes since
early March, when, In response to
student complaints, he sent
memos to individual dorm
managers.
Leyton, however, said that
grapes have been served since
March in Wilbur and Stern and
that at least one Food Service
manager — in Toyon — had not
received any such memo.
Leyton said when members of
MEChA and the Student Labor
Support Committee went to
Keeton in March, Keeton told
them they were special interests
that did not represent the student
body as a whole. "He thought their

request was laughable." Leyton
said.
When Keeton reacted similarly
to the ASSU resolution, the
groups asked for a meeting with
him, Leyton said.
According to Keeton. yesterday's
meeting addressed "how 1 would
go about knowing about student
feelings on this issue. We decided
the ASSU does represent the stu
dents' viewpoint."
Keeton "has definitely changed
his tone," Leyton said. "He's
become more receptive."
Keeton said he will send memos
to all dorm food service managers
telling them not to serve grapes.
Keeton also agreed to help

MEChA educate students about
pesticides and the boycott by dis
tributing fliers in dining halls.
In addition, Keeton said he
would "study further" the issue of
"how Food Service should deal
with boycott-type issues" as well
the effects of the pesticides in
question.
Fuentes said the UFW boycott,
which began last year, is still
growing and may become a
nationwide movement.
UFW targeted the grape indus
try because of its heavy pesticide
use and because of the success of
a 1970 grape boycott, which
resulted in the banning of DDT,
Fuentes added.
