# Stanford sailors shoot for national team title
## 
### HUGH BETHELL Editorial staff 
When they arrive In Kings Point
for the Intercollegiate Team
Racing National Championship
tomorrow, several members of the
Stanford sailing team may be

struck with a sense of deja-vu.
It might be the scenery, for most
of those traveling to New York
were there just two months ago.
during the team's spring break
East Coast tour. But more Impor
tantly. the Cardinal sailors will
know that the team racing cham

pionshlp represents their first
and last shot at a national title
this year.
Both this year and last, the
sailing team narrowly missed
qualifying for the national cham
pionships in the dinghy division,
to which the squad devotes most

of its effort during the year. This
year, the team has used its last
month of practice preparing for
the team race championship,
knowing that the Cardinal perfor
mance in that regatta will deter
mine whether this season ends
with a whimper or a bang.

Last year's season ended on a
high note when the team
surprised many by finishing a
strong third at the nationals. This
year, many of the sailors who
earned that finish are returning to
try for something even better â€”
the national title.
A third-place finish at last year's
nationals, and this year's win at
the Pacific Coast Championship
qualifying regatta, reveal that the
Cardinal is extremely strong In an
event that the team competes in
only irregularly. For most of each
season. Stanford sails in dinghy
division races, in which each boat
races against all the other boats,
from its school and from others.
Dinghy racing Is most akin to a
running race.
Team racing, on the other hand,
features a far more complex for
mat. If dinghy racing is checkers,
it has been said, then team racing
is three-dimensional chess. Each
school fields a three-boat team,
which duels against another
school's team in one race, and
then another school's team in the
next, and so on until every two
teams have met. The team that
wins the most of these matches
wins the regatta.
To win one of the races, the
three boats on a team must
cooperate to an great extent. Be
cause the total team score decides
the winner, the object is not nec
essarily to go fast, but to slow the
opposing team down so that trail
ing teammates can catch up and
go into the lead.
In order to do that, team-racing
sailors employ special tricks that
exploit the right-of-way rules that
govern all sailboat racing. When a
boat is ahead, it can steer an op
posing boat away from the quick
est course, so that the other boats

on Its team can pass the oppon
ent.
The sailors Stanford Is sending
to the national championship are
well-versed In such maneuvers.
Sailing for Stanford are Juniors
Dan Buckstaff and Kathleen
Mallery, junior Drew Gashler and
senior Krlsten Boyles, senior Tom
Kuhnle and sophomore Rita
Snape. and sophomore Ev Rend
and junior Glna Ottobonl.
Asked to evaluate his team's
chances. Stanford Coach Blake
Middleton was guardedly optimis
tic.
"I think we're sending a strong
team, but there's no doubt that
we'll be facing the best sailors In
the nation. I have high hopes for
our team because our skippers
have all been to nationals before,
and the experience should really
help." Middleton said.
Asked about the competition,
Middleton said that he expects at
least one strong team from each of
the national districts. Stanford
and the University of California-
Irvine will represent the Pacific
Coast district, and are eager to
prove themselves against the East
Coast competition.
Ottobonl agrees. "We're ranked
pretty highly on the West Coast,
but the real competition in college
sailing is in the East," she said.
"I'm looking forward to sailing
against all the other schools we
don't normally sail against."
In the most recent Yacht Racing
& Cruising national ranking,
Stanford's sailing team was No.
11, above all other West Coast
schools.
"A good performance at the
team racing championship could
put us in the top 10. and a really
good performance could put us in
the top five. This weekend is that
important. It's all on the line,"
Boyles said.


Teamwork will be the theme of the Stanford Sailing team's efforts this
weekend in Kings Point, N.Y. Cardinal Drew Gashler and his

Blake Middleton/Dally
teammates will be concentrating on position sailing in order to
enable trailing Stanford boats to get back into contention.
