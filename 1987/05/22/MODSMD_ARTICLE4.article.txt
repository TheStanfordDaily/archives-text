# Committee upholds alcohol in stadium
## 
### ANN MARSH Staff writer 
The Committee on Athletics, Physical
Education and Recreation (CAPER) decided
yesterday to continue to allow alcoholic
beverages in Stanford Stadium.
The committee, however, made its deci
sion contigent on improved behavior by
spectators, according to Athletic Director
Andy Geiger.
The decision came in response to a pro
posal Geiger made to CAPER earlier this
month that alcohol be banned from the
stadium for the upcoming football season.
According to a joint statement issued yes
terday by CAPER and Geiger, Athletic De
partment and police security will be in
creased at football games next fall, and
limitations will be placed on the amount of
alcohol that spectators may bring into the
85,000-seat stadium. Exact limitations will
be finalized over the summer, Geiger said.
"What we want to eliminate are the large
coolers coming in (to the stadium)," Geiger
said.
Acting Dean of Student Affairs Norm Rob
inson, a CAPER member, said that in the
past "enormous quantities of alcohol were
being brought into the stadium." Robinson
said he has heard of spectators bringing
cases of beer and kegs with them to the
games.
If there is no reduction in the amount of
disruptive behavior at football games next
fall, Geiger said, CAPER would be prepared
to institute a total ban on alcoholic
beverages in the stadium.
Beth Kruger, one of the student members

of CAPER, said the proposal for a dry
stadium arose in part as a result of a Nov.
26 Daily editorial strongly condemning the
Athletic Department's stadium alcohol
policy.
Alcohol abuse at the stadium again
emerged as an issue earlier this month
when Tony Navarra, president of the Stan
ford Police Officers Association, sent a letter
to Geiger expressing his concern about
"rowdiness and maintaining orderly con
duct" during games, Kruger said.
"The Navarra letter placed the matter on
the agenda of CAPER," Geiger said.
"The police came to us saying that there
was an increase in violence in the stadium
and they wanted us to do something about
it," Kruger said. "Andy (Geiger) brought up
the proposal (for a dry stadium) to bring up
discussion in the community."
"It's not the Stanford way to initiate
prohibition, but to work with responsibil
ity." Geiger said.
"It's our belief that people associated with
the University behave responsibly," Robin
son said. "We want to give the community
another opportunity to demonstrate this."
"I think people need to learn to take care
of themselves," said Tim Gadus, a research
technician at the Stanford Medical Center.
Gadus spoke out against the proposal at a
May 18 public forum sponsored by CAPER.
Lisa Larragoite, a Dollie who was hit in
the face last fall by a pomegranate thrown
by a spectator, said she thought the prob
lem of disruptive behavior would not be
solved by having a dry stadium.
Geiger emphasized that "there is over-
whelming evidence that the situa
tion (at football games) was at
times out of hand. We're (CAPER)
recognizing the fact that there
was and is a problem" with alcohol
in the stadium.
Geiger said he plans to seek ad
vice from such student groups as
the ASSU and the Interfraternity
Council to find ways of dealing
with this problem.
Another reform under consider
ation is splitting up the student
seating sections in the stadium,
he said.
Geiger, who in his first year as
Stanford's athletic director lifted a
year-old ban on alcohol in the
stadium, said his approach to the
problem is "to raise the conscious
ness in the community about a
dangerous situation."
