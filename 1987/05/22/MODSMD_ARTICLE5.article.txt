# Iran-contra affair
## IOB attorney will testify next month 
### TRACIE THOMPSON Staff writer 
Stanford's connection to the Iran-contra
affair may become clearer early next month
when the legal counsel to a presidential ad
visory group led by Hoover Director W.
Glenn Campbell appears before congres
sional investigators.
Bretton Sciaroni. staff attorney for the In
telligence Oversight Board (IOB), is sched
uled to testify the first week of June, ac
cording to a spokesman for the House com
mittee investigating the Iran-contra affair.
Campbell is the chairman of the 108. a
three-member board that also includes
former Stanford Law School Dean Charles
Meyers.
Sciaroni has been identified by congres
sional investigators as the author of three
legal memorandums advising White House
officials that they were not subject to re
strictions imposed by the Boland amend
ment. The amendment, named for its spon
sor, Rep. Edward Boland, D-Mass., was
passed by Congress in 1982 as a means of
curtailing American military assistance to
the Nicaraguan contras.
The three memoranda from the 108 to
the President's National Security Council
(NSC) staff were discovered early this year

by the Tower commission, the investigative
panel appointed by President Reagan to in
vestigate the Iran-contra affair.
In its report, the Tower commission ques
tioned whether it was proper for the 108 to
give legal advice to White House staff.
"Without passing on the quality of that
advice, it is an odd source," said the com
mission on the subject of the 108.
A former legal counsel to the 108 echoed
that sentiment in an interview yesterday."I
did not see the counsel's role as giving ad
vice to White House entities." said James
Dick, who was the lOB's attorney from Jan
uary 1980 to July 1981. He added that his
board, whose members were appointed by
President Carter, "saw itself as serving the
president, not other elements of the White
House,"
While noting that procedures may have
changed under the chairmanship of
Campbell. Dick stated. "Had I rendered an
opinion like (Sciaroni's) — and I don't
believe that I would have — either sub
stantively or procedurely, I certainly would
have informed the board in advance."
Dick described the 108 as a part-time
board of "non-governmental people, distin
guished citizens who are in a position to
review the legality of intelligence
community activities." The legal
counsel, he said, is the only full
time professional staff for the
board. Dick, a 1974 graduate of
Stanford Law School, joked that
he was counsel for six months
into the Reagan administration
before he was "discovered."
Congressional investigators
have interviewed Sciaroni in prep
aration for the current hearings,
but they have declined to discuss
what his testimony might include.
Sciaroni and Campbell were un
available for comment, as was
Hoover fellow Martin Anderson, a
consultant to the 108.
The testimony by Sciaroni
should be of particular interest to
the congressional committee be
cause of the recently intensified

debate as to the proper legal inter
pretation of the Boland Amend
ment.
Members of Congress have long
argued over what activities and
agencies were covered by the
prohibition. But with the mount
ing evidence indicating that White
House officials solicited foreign
aid for the contras, the executive
branch has now entered into the
debate.
White House officials are no
longer arguing that there was no
aid to the contras during the per
iod of the congressional ban. In
stead, Reagan has now taken the
offensive on the question of
legality, arguing that the amend
ment did not cover his activities or
the activities of his NSC staff in
support of the contras.
However, Reagan has not yet
cited the legal advice rendered by
the 108 as the basis for his
opinion on the Boland Amend
ment.
