## IOB attorney will testify next month 
### TRACIE THOMPSON Staff writer 
Stanford's connection to the Iran-contra
affair may become clearer early next month
when the legal counsel to a presidential ad
visory group led by Hoover Director W.
Glenn Campbell appears before congres
sional investigators.
Bretton Sciaroni. staff attorney for the In
telligence Oversight Board (IOB), is sched
uled to testify the first week of June, ac
cording to a spokesman for the House com
mittee investigating the Iran-contra affair.
Campbell is the chairman of the 108. a
three-member board that also includes
former Stanford Law School Dean Charles
Meyers.
Sciaroni has been identified by congres
sional investigators as the author of three
legal memorandums advising White House
officials that they were not subject to re

give legal advice to White House staff.

advice, it is an odd source," said the com
mission on the subject of the 108.
A former legal counsel to the 108 echoed
that sentiment in an interview yesterday."I
did not see the counsel's role as giving ad
vice to White House entities." said James
Dick, who was the lOB's attorney from Jan
uary 1980 to July 1981. He added that his
board, whose members were appointed by
President Carter, "saw itself as serving the
president, not other elements of the White
House,"
While noting that procedures may have
changed under the chairmanship of
Campbell. Dick stated. "Had I rendered an
opinion like (Sciaroni's) — and I don't
believe that I would have — either sub
stantively or procedurely, I certainly would
have informed the board in advance."
Dick described the 108 as a part-time
board of "non-governmental people, distin
guished citizens who are in a position to
