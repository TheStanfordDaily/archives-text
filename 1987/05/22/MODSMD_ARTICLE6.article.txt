## 
### MARCUS MABRY Senior staff writer 
A county coroner's report has confirmed
police speculation that Stanford junior
David Dunshee was drunk when he drowned
in Lagunita last month, according to a
spokeswoman for the Santa Clara Coroner's
Office.
The spokeswoman told the San Jose Mer
cury News Wednesday that Dunshee's blood
alcohol level when he died was .25 — two
and-a-half times California's legal intoxica
tion limit.
Nathan Gossett. a coroner's office admin
istrator. said yesterday that he would neither
confirm nor deny that figure. He said his of
fice normally does not release information on
blood alcohol levels.
Gossett did. however, confirm that the
autopsy showed drowning to be the primary
cause of Dunshee s death, and that alcohol

intoxication was the only "contributory
cause."
Stanford Police Chief Marvin Herrington
and Santa Clara County Deputy District At
torney Ron Rico said yesterday that they had
not yet seen the coroner's report.
The University's final report on the drown
ing is expected to be released late today or
early next week by the Office of Residential
Education.
The head of the University's investigation
into the drowning. Assistant to the Provost
Michael Jackson, said the coroner's report
would only affect his investigation if it
revealed that foul play was involved in Dun
shee's death.
"What it (the report) can do is confirm
what we believed happened — and that is
that Dunshee was drunk. Unless it shows
(there was) any foul play, we're where we
were before." Jackson said.
Jackson added that he is not sure if he will

be allowed to see a copy of the coroner's
report. Jackson said he has asked the Stan
ford police to look into the possibility of get
ting a copy of the report.
Rico said he will not see the coroner's
report until the Stanford police deliver it to
him. He added that he will also review the
University's report, the report from the
divers who retrieved Dunshee's body and the
police department's own report.
Until he is able to assess all the Informa
tion contained In the four reports. Rico said
he will not know whether the district attor
ney will bring charges against anyone con
nected with the incident.
"I am waiting for all the information. I can
not speculate. All I have seen are newspaper
accounts (of the coroner's report), and I can't
base a case on newspaper accounts." Rico
said.
Herrington was unwilling to
comment on whether the
coroner's findings contradict the
police department's initial report,
which was rejected by the district
attorney last Wednesday because

it did not contain information
about the cause of death or Dun
shee's blood alcohol level.
The Stanford police requested a
copy of the coroner's report early
yesterday, and expect to receive a
copy of the report today or Tues
day, Herrington said.
Herrington said he does not ex
pect any "surprises." given what

he has read in the press.
"We have assembled all the in
formation we have and the
sheriff's office has also done a
report. If there are no surprises in
(the report) then we'll be putting
all the pieces together and some
determination will be made as to
whether there's (grounds for) pro
secution or not," Herrington said.
