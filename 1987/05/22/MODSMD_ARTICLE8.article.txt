Navy opens Stark investigation
MANAMA, Bahrain — A team of U.S. naval officers opened a for
mal investigation yesterday into the circumstances surrounding
the Iraqi air attack on a U.S. Navy ship that left 37 American
sailors dead.
Six officers, headed by Rear Adm. Grant Sharp, went aboard the
command ship LaSalle. flagship of the U.S. Middle East Force, to
begin the investigation, a Navy spokesman said. Sharp is com
mander of Cruiser Destroyer Group 2, based at Charleston, S.C.
"It is a formal investigation with the purpose of inquiring into
all the circumstances connected with the damage and loss of life
sustained as a result of the attack on the USS Stark." Cmdr. Mi
chael Cherry, the Navy spokesman, told reporters.
In Washington, President Reagan ordered U.S. Navy ships in
the gulf to step up their readiness as a result of Sunday's attack on
the Stark.
The Pentagon said yesterday that the guided-missile frigate
Groves, which had been scheduled to return to the United States
next month, had been ordered to stay in the gulf until August.
"We want to maintain a credible presence there," a Defense De
partment official said. "The Stark is out of commission, and the
return of the Groves . . . would have reduced us to three guided
missile destroyers and one guided-missile frigate, in addition to
the LaSalle."
U.S. charged with trespassing
MOSCOW — The Soviet government charged yesterday that an
American cruiser had violated Soviet territorial waters earlier in
the day.
A government spokesman said that a strong protest had been
handed to the United States as a result of yesterday's incident and
a similar incident four days earlier.
A spokesman for the Foreign Ministry, Yuri Gremltskikh, said
that the ship involved was the nuclear-powered cruiser Arkansas.
He said it entered Avacha Bay near Petropavlovsk, the site of an
Important naval base on the Kamchatka Peninsula in the Soviet
Far East.
Gremitskikh gave no other details. He said that he did not know
whether the Arkansas was operating independently or with a
group of ships.
"The American side." he said, "was told that such violations
could have most serious consequences, all responsibility for
which would be squarely on the United States."
He said that his government had "demanded that the American
side take every essential measure to rule out such incidents in the
future."
Gremitskikh did not say whether the protest was delivered to
the U.S. Embassy here or through the Soviet Embassy in Wash
ington. There was no immediate response from the embassy here.
Wedtech investigation expands
WASHINGTON — The independent-counsel investigation into
actions by former White House aide Lyn Nofziger and Attorney
General Edwin Meese 111 in connection with the Wedtech Corp.
has been expanded to include their activities on behalf of Fair
child Industries Inc., sources said yesterday.
The sources said independent counsel James McKay and his
team of investigators have questioned former administration offi
cials about the role played by Nofziger and Meese in 1982 when
Fairchild, a Chantilly, Va., defense contractor, was attempting to
persuade the Air Force to extend contracts for the A-10 aircraft.
Deborah Tucker, a Fairchild spokeswoman, Thursday con
firmed that the company has been contacted by McKay's office and
has been "cooperating fully" with the grand jury.
Meanwhile, as the probe continued to expand, law-enforcement
sources in New York said Rep. Mario Biaggl, D-N.Y., has been at
tempting to negotiate a plea agreement in connection with his in
dictment in an unrelated case. The sources said Biaggi and his
son are expected to be indicted in the Wedtech case, probably next
week, and that Biaggi was making his offer in an effort to head off
those indictments.
Black leaders defend Young
ATLANTA — When Mayor Andrew Young emerged from an ap
pearance before a federal grand jury last week, he expressed hopes
that the worst was over in the federal investigation into whether
he improperly sought to impede a police probe of cocaine use by
several prominent black Atlantans.
But black leaders in the city are not sanguine about that possi
bility. They have become increasingly disconcerted over the
course of the grand jury investigation, contending that federal
prosecutors are out to smear the mayor and, with him, the city's
black power structure.
"Everybody I've talked to thinks the investigation is just a politi
cal witch hunt." said the Rev. Joseph Lowery, president of the
Southern Christian Leadership Council and a leading civil rights
activist. "I think the Republican U.S. attorney would like nothing
better than to nail Andy. We're entering a presidential election
year next year, and Atlanta is hosting the Democratic National
Convention."
U.S. Attorney Robert Barr said: "I would hope that the black
leaders, as well as all leaders of this city, would support an ob
jective assessment of these charges, so that the air could be
cleared. If, indeed, there is found to be no criminal activity on the
part of those named, that in and of itself would lend some
credibility to the city government."
AIDS drugs to be more available
WASHINGTON — In a historic change in the regulation of the
nation's pharmaceutical industry, the Food and Drug Administra
tion released a final regulation yesterday that would make experi
mental drugs significantly more available to seriously ill or dying
patients.
The controversial new rule would allow people with
"immediately life-threatening diseases" to decide for themselves
either to take an experimental drug, with all its concomitant risks
and side effects, or die untreated.
The rule would authorize the FDA commissioner to make
available drugs that appear promising in clinical experiments, on
a case-by-case basis. One prerequisite is that there be "no compa
rable or satisfactory alternative therapy" for the patient or the ail
ment in question.
The administration proposal, to take effect in 30 days, was
hailed by the pharmaceutical Industry as being long overdue.
But it was harshly criticized by many leading biomedical re
searchers and physicians, including the president of the Ameri
can Heart Association and the chief medical officer of the Ameri
can Cancer Society. They said making unproven drugs available
broadly would unnecessarily endanger the well-being of already
very ill people.
The new rule, spurred in part by the AIDS epidemic and the
Reagan administration's commitment to deregulation, was pub
lished Thursday in the Federal Register, taking up 53 pages.
It would apply only to drugs that are already undergoing tradi
tional tests in humans for safety and efficacy. The regulation also
specifies that such clinical experiments must continue even as
the test drug Is being made broadly available.

MANAMA, Bahrain — A team of U.S. naval officers opened a for
mal investigation yesterday into the circumstances surrounding
the Iraqi air attack on a U.S. Navy ship that left 37 American
sailors dead.
Six officers, headed by Rear Adm. Grant Sharp, went aboard the
command ship LaSalle. flagship of the U.S. Middle East Force, to
begin the investigation, a Navy spokesman said. Sharp is com
mander of Cruiser Destroyer Group 2, based at Charleston, S.C.
"It is a formal investigation with the purpose of inquiring into
all the circumstances connected with the damage and loss of life
sustained as a result of the attack on the USS Stark." Cmdr. Mi
chael Cherry, the Navy spokesman, told reporters.
In Washington, President Reagan ordered U.S. Navy ships in
the gulf to step up their readiness as a result of Sunday's attack on
the Stark.
The Pentagon said yesterday that the guided-missile frigate
Groves, which had been scheduled to return to the United States
next month, had been ordered to stay in the gulf until August.
"We want to maintain a credible presence there," a Defense De
partment official said. "The Stark is out of commission, and the
return of the Groves . . . would have reduced us to three guided
missile destroyers and one guided-missile frigate, in addition to
the LaSalle."
U.S. charged with trespassing
MOSCOW — The Soviet government charged yesterday that an
American cruiser had violated Soviet territorial waters earlier in
the day.
A government spokesman said that a strong protest had been
handed to the United States as a result of yesterday's incident and
a similar incident four days earlier.
A spokesman for the Foreign Ministry, Yuri Gremltskikh, said
that the ship involved was the nuclear-powered cruiser Arkansas.
He said it entered Avacha Bay near Petropavlovsk, the site of an
Important naval base on the Kamchatka Peninsula in the Soviet
Far East.
Gremitskikh gave no other details. He said that he did not know
whether the Arkansas was operating independently or with a
group of ships.
"The American side." he said, "was told that such violations
could have most serious consequences, all responsibility for
which would be squarely on the United States."
He said that his government had "demanded that the American
side take every essential measure to rule out such incidents in the
future."
Gremitskikh did not say whether the protest was delivered to
the U.S. Embassy here or through the Soviet Embassy in Wash
ington. There was no immediate response from the embassy here.
Wedtech investigation expands
WASHINGTON — The independent-counsel investigation into
actions by former White House aide Lyn Nofziger and Attorney
General Edwin Meese 111 in connection with the Wedtech Corp.
has been expanded to include their activities on behalf of Fair
child Industries Inc., sources said yesterday.
The sources said independent counsel James McKay and his
team of investigators have questioned former administration offi
cials about the role played by Nofziger and Meese in 1982 when
Fairchild, a Chantilly, Va., defense contractor, was attempting to
persuade the Air Force to extend contracts for the A-10 aircraft.
Deborah Tucker, a Fairchild spokeswoman, Thursday con
firmed that the company has been contacted by McKay's office and
has been "cooperating fully" with the grand jury.
Meanwhile, as the probe continued to expand, law-enforcement
sources in New York said Rep. Mario Biaggl, D-N.Y., has been at
tempting to negotiate a plea agreement in connection with his in
dictment in an unrelated case. The sources said Biaggi and his
son are expected to be indicted in the Wedtech case, probably next
week, and that Biaggi was making his offer in an effort to head off
those indictments.
Black leaders defend Young
ATLANTA — When Mayor Andrew Young emerged from an ap
pearance before a federal grand jury last week, he expressed hopes
that the worst was over in the federal investigation into whether
he improperly sought to impede a police probe of cocaine use by
several prominent black Atlantans.
But black leaders in the city are not sanguine about that possi
bility. They have become increasingly disconcerted over the
course of the grand jury investigation, contending that federal
prosecutors are out to smear the mayor and, with him, the city's
black power structure.
"Everybody I've talked to thinks the investigation is just a politi
cal witch hunt." said the Rev. Joseph Lowery, president of the
Southern Christian Leadership Council and a leading civil rights
activist. "I think the Republican U.S. attorney would like nothing
better than to nail Andy. We're entering a presidential election
year next year, and Atlanta is hosting the Democratic National
Convention."
U.S. Attorney Robert Barr said: "I would hope that the black
leaders, as well as all leaders of this city, would support an ob
jective assessment of these charges, so that the air could be
cleared. If, indeed, there is found to be no criminal activity on the
part of those named, that in and of itself would lend some
credibility to the city government."
AIDS drugs to be more available
WASHINGTON — In a historic change in the regulation of the
nation's pharmaceutical industry, the Food and Drug Administra
tion released a final regulation yesterday that would make experi
mental drugs significantly more available to seriously ill or dying
patients.
The controversial new rule would allow people with
"immediately life-threatening diseases" to decide for themselves
either to take an experimental drug, with all its concomitant risks
and side effects, or die untreated.
The rule would authorize the FDA commissioner to make
available drugs that appear promising in clinical experiments, on
a case-by-case basis. One prerequisite is that there be "no compa
rable or satisfactory alternative therapy" for the patient or the ail
ment in question.
The administration proposal, to take effect in 30 days, was
hailed by the pharmaceutical Industry as being long overdue.
But it was harshly criticized by many leading biomedical re
searchers and physicians, including the president of the Ameri
can Heart Association and the chief medical officer of the Ameri
can Cancer Society. They said making unproven drugs available
broadly would unnecessarily endanger the well-being of already
very ill people.
The new rule, spurred in part by the AIDS epidemic and the
Reagan administration's commitment to deregulation, was pub
lished Thursday in the Federal Register, taking up 53 pages.
It would apply only to drugs that are already undergoing tradi
tional tests in humans for safety and efficacy. The regulation also
specifies that such clinical experiments must continue even as
the test drug Is being made broadly available.
