# Congress learns of North's persuasions
## 
### 
WASHINGTON - Former White
House aide Oliver North per
suaded wealthy Americans to
donate millions of dollars to the
Nicaraguan rebels by giving them
unorthodox private briefings,
once even outlining a secret U.S.
plan to overthrow the Sandinis
tas. the congressional committees
investigating the Iran-contra
scandal were told yesterday.
Potential contributors fre
quently got what Sen. Warren
Rudman, R-N.H., described as
"the one-two punch:" a White
House briefing on the contras'
needs from North, followed by a
direct pitch for money from fund
raiser Carl R. "Spitz" Channell.
Those who gave at least *300.000
were said to qualify for a private
meeting with President Reagan.
All told, the three contributors
who testified before the commit
tees — millionaire brewer Joseph
Coors of Colorado. Texas heiress

Ellen St. John Garwood and New
York oil investor William B.
O'Boyle — donated a total of more
than *2.3 million as a result of
their meetings with North. It has
not yet been established whether
these funds reached the contras.
Neither Reagan nor North ever
asked potential contributors di
rectly for money, according to the
witnesses, but Rudman dismissed
as "legal fiction" the claim made
by some committee Republicans
that the president and his aide did
not solicit funds.
"The whole event was a solicita
tion," Rudman declared.
At the time that these private
funds were being raised, the
Reagan administration was
strictly prohibited by Congress
from giving either direct or indi
rect U.S. military assistance to the
Nicaraguan resistance. The ban
was not lifted until last October.
Garwood, 83, a slight, white

haired woman and a frequent
donor to right-wing causes, was
the only one of the three witnesses
who qualified for a meeting with
Reagan. After attending a presi
dential briefing in April 1986, in
which Reagan thanked her and
several other contributors for
their generosity, she gave Chan
nell *1.98 million in cash and
stocks.
She gave another $10,000 to
Channell to be used for North's le
gal defense or for his children's
educations after the Iran-contra
affair came to light, she said. But
she later transferred the money to
another fund for North when she
was told that Channell had been
taking 35 percent of all donations
for himself — a charge that she
said he did not deny when she
confronted him.
The Austin. Texas, heiress to a
cotton and rice fortune. Garwood
inherited along with her vast

wealth a legacy of anti-com
munism that led to her Involve
ment in the contra cause.
Coors, a friend of the president
who gave *65,000 to buy the con
tras a single-engine Maule
airplane, was referred to North
when he asked the late CIA Direc
tor William Casey how he could
help the contras. He said Casey
replied: "Ollie's the guy to see."
North provided Coors with a
brochure about Maule aircraft and
the number of a Swiss bank ac
count, where the brewing
magnate deposited his contribu
tion.
Although North's pitch to Gar
word and Coors focused on the
military and humanitarian needs
of the contras, O'Boyle recalled re
ceiving a far livelier presentation
when he met privately with the
Marine lieutenant colonel in his
White House office April 29, 1986.
