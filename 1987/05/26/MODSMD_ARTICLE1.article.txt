# Stadium concert rejected
## 
### HARU CONNOLLY Staff writer 
The Office of Student Affairs
has turned down a Concert Net
work proposal to sponsor a David
Bowie or a Madonna benefit con
cert this summer in Stanford
Stadium, according to Concert
Network Advisory Board Chair
Kurt Johnson.
The University in March
rejected the idea of a summer con
cert featuring the Grateful Dead
and Bob Dylan, Johnson said. In a
memo dated March 4, 1987, Dean
of Student Affairs James Lyons
stated, "The request was turned
down because the event seemed
not to meet the usual tests of an
activity that fit comfortably within
the educational mission of the
University."
The decision to reject the Bowie
or Madonna concert was made
after several meetings over a per
iod of a few weeks, and was "more
of a matter of reiterating that deci
sion (made in March)," said Mar
garet Ann Fidler, associate dean of
Student Affairs.
"It was unclear (in March) as to
whether a specific show was being
turned down or a summer concert
in general," said former Network
faculty adviser Suzanne Becker.
"(Board members) felt there was
still a chance, and they still
wanted to pursue it."
According to Johnson, former
advisory board chair Scott Davis
negotiated with a promoter from
Los Angeles about the Bowie and
Madonna concerts after the March
decision came out.
"Davis was trying a lot for a
month or so (to get the Bowie or
Madonna concert), while knowing
initially that there probably
wouldn't be a concert." Fidler
said.
The Concert Network presented
a resolution to the ASSU Senate
last week urging the University to
support a summer concert in
Stanford Stadium. The senate
passed the resolution overwhelm
ingly. Johnson said.
"We thought that the Bowie and
Madonna acts would be more
palatable to the University,"
Johnson said. "We hoped that
they would change their minds."
"We wanted to do one more
thing to convince the University of
student support, and the proposal
to the senate was that show of stu
dent support." said Johnson.
Lyons' memo rejected the
stadium concert on the grounds
that the event was not clearly edu
cational. would not benefit "some
University cause . . . (e.g. scholar
ships or support for some
recognized program)," and could
be redundant with other events in
the Bay Area.
"The Concert Network would
like to put on shows in the sum
mer which would underwrite
shows in the fall," said former
Deputy Senate Chair Larry Bloch.
"If the University does not allow
summer concerts, that would un
dercut the network's ability the
have concerts in the fall."
"We would like the University to
get an explicit policy (about
stadium concerts)," Johnson
said. "We have been working
closely with the dean of Student
Affairs. If we're lucky, we'll have a
policy by the middle of next year."
The network also proposed that
the show be a benefit in order to
circumvent any possible problems
with tax laws, Johnson said.
"The University has to be careful
with its facilities, and it is not in a

position (to sponsor) events un
related to academic purposes."
Fidler said.
According to Fidler. educational
activities are the key to the Univer
sity's tax-exempt status.
"The fact that the concert would
have been a potential money
maker is an obvious interest, but
that can't just be the only ob
jective," Fidler said.
The University policy allows
some benefits, but mostly on a
smaller scale, Fidler said.
According to Fidler, if there is a
constant flow of large benefits,
which generally have less student
involvement, the tax-exempt issue
would come up.
"There must be clearly an edu
cational reason, and it is easier to
defend that during the academic
year," Fidler said.
The network is also deciding
how to restructure itself for next
year, in light of students' rejection
of the second part of their fee
assessment in last month's ASSU
election, Johnson said.
"We are considering several pos
sibilities of restructuring our
selves," Johnson said. Among
these possibilities are moving un
der the direction of the ASSU,
remaining with Tresidder or fit
ting into University Events and
Services.
According to Johnson, funding
for the faculty adviser's salary
could come from the student af
fairs office if the network stays
with Tresidder Memorial Union.
"Last week, the senate approved
an extension to allow the network
more time to get an adviser,"
Johnson said. The network needs
an adviser in order to receive the
first part of the fee assessment
students approved in last month's
ASSU election.
According to Johnson, the sen
ate recognized that the network
could not possibly find an adviser
in the short span of time the
assessment required.

policy by the middle of next year."
The network also proposed that
the show be a benefit in order to
circumvent any possible problems
with tax laws, Johnson said.
"The University has to be careful
with its facilities, and it is not in a

position (to sponsor) events un
related to academic purposes."
Fidler said.
According to Fidler. educational
activities are the key to the Univer
sity's tax-exempt status.
"The fact that the concert would
have been a potential money
maker is an obvious interest, but
that can't just be the only ob
jective," Fidler said.
The University policy allows
some benefits, but mostly on a
smaller scale, Fidler said.
According to Fidler, if there is a
constant flow of large benefits,
which generally have less student
involvement, the tax-exempt issue
would come up.
"There must be clearly an edu
cational reason, and it is easier to
defend that during the academic
year," Fidler said.
The network is also deciding
how to restructure itself for next
year, in light of students' rejection
of the second part of their fee
assessment in last month's ASSU
election, Johnson said.
"We are considering several pos
sibilities of restructuring our
selves," Johnson said. Among
these possibilities are moving un
der the direction of the ASSU,
remaining with Tresidder or fit
ting into University Events and
Services.
According to Johnson, funding
for the faculty adviser's salary
could come from the student af
fairs office if the network stays
with Tresidder Memorial Union.
"Last week, the senate approved
an extension to allow the network
more time to get an adviser,"
Johnson said. The network needs
an adviser in order to receive the
first part of the fee assessment
students approved in last month's
ASSU election.
According to Johnson, the sen
ate recognized that the network
could not possibly find an adviser
in the short span of time the
assessment required.
