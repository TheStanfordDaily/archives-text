# Stanford scientists develop drug that may treat tumors

Researchers from the Stanford Medical Center an -4
SRI International have manufactured a drug that
has the potential to selectively destroy cancerous
cells in humans.
According to Dr. J. Martin Brown, professor of
therapeutic radiology and, one of the principal mem
bers of the research team, the drug, labeled SR 4233,
has successfully killed "better than 99.9 percent of
cancer cells in mice."
Brown said the drug, which has thus far only been
tested on mice, is "still a long way from curing cancer
. . . but it may lead somewhere in terms of clinical
treatment" in the future.
According to Brown, the drug is "very potent in its
ability to kill cancer cells when they are hypoxic, or
deficient in oxygen."
Normally, the tissue of a solid tumor contains
these hypoxic cells, which are "very difficult to kill
under normal circumstances using radiation or can
cer drugs," Brown said.
The unique feature of SR 4233 is that it is capable
of destroying the hypoxic cells in a malignant tumor
without killing the fully oxygenated cells. Brown
said. The fact that SR 4233 is not toxic to all types of
tissue "is very rare," he noted.
According to Dr. William Lee, the chemist at SRI
International who is responsible for manufacturing
the "completely synthesized" drug, SR 4233 is a ben
zotriazine N-oxide compound of "medium complex

ity"
The scientists developed the drug, which Brown
called "a lucky find," about two years ago and have
been testing it ever since. They presented their find
ings last week at the annual meeting of the American
Association for Cancer Research in Atlanta.
The researchers tested the drug on tumors in mice
by giving the mice doses of hydralazine, a drug used
to fight high blood pressure, thereby making all of
the cells in the tumors hypoxic. Brown said.
The scientists then applied SR 4233 to the tumors.
Only when the drug comes into contact with the
hypoxic cells does it become toxic. The other cells are
left unaffected. Brown said.
"It's been known for 20 to 30 years that you can
make hypoxic cells by using commonly used anti
hypertensive drugs," Brown said. But that informa
tion was of "no use until we had a drug, such as SR
4233, that could selectively kill hypoxic cells," he
said.
The scientists are not sure that SR 4233 is the
most effective drug for attacking hypoxic tumor cells,
Brown said.
Currently, they are searching for analogs, drugs
similar in composition to SR 4233, that may be more
effective, Brown said.
"We have made some analogs which have the same
potency (as SR 4233), but are less toxic." he said.
Once the scientists have found what they consider
to be the"the best drug, it will be another two or
three years before it is given to a patient," Brown
said.
