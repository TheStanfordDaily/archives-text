# OPINIONS
## THE 						STANFORD DAILY An Independent Newspaper Attend the forum 
### 
In the past several weeks, incidents
motivated by racism have increased on the
Stanford campus. Black students have been
told to "go back to Africa" and anti-Semitic
fliers have been distributed. That racism
exists here cannot be denied, and the Stan
ford community should do whatever it takes
to eliminate it. Attending the forum on rac
ism tonight at 7 p.m. in Kresge Auditorium
is a good first step.
In addition to the overt racism at Stanford,
there has also been an increase in lack of
tolerance for minority concerns. Several stu
dents have expressed the attitude that Stan
ford's ethnic minority organizations, in their
Rainbow Agenda, have gone too far. Mem
bers of the group have been pictured as radi
cal militants and their demands as self
righteous.
In many cases these criticisms are subtly
racist. In others they are the result of a lack
of understanding of minority perspective.
Some criticisms come from those politically
aligned with the goals of the Rainbow
Agenda but in disagreement over what tac
tics should be used to attain those goals.
Whatever the case, these are opinions that
should be aired at tonight's forum. Dealing
with racism is everyone's concern. No one
should pass up this opportunity to learn

about minority concerns, to express his or
her political opinions or to share personal ex
periences regarding racism.
The forum was scheduled after partici
pants in a Rainbow Agenda sit-in in Univer
sity President Donald Kennedy's office last
week demanded that it be held. The fact that
a simple public forum had to be demanded
sheds light on the University's unwillingness
to face the issue. But resistance to discus
sion helps no one; everyone able should at
tend the forum and not avoid the issue.
Members of the Administration will partic
ipate. They will be open for questions and
their positions can be supported or con
fronted. Similarly, members of the Rainbow
Agenda will speak and can be applauded or
challenged to defend their views.
Several race-related issues have stirred
controversy on this campus this year: West
ern Culture program reform, alleged limita
tions on Asian student admissions, increas
ing the number of minority faculty members,
the effects of theme houses, divestment from
South Africa-related stock and political
demonstrations during Cornerstone Week
end. These topics certainly will be discussed
tonight, and students with strong feelings
about these issues should air them at the
forum.
