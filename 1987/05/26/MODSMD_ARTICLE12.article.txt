No apologies
are necessary
Alex Grant's recent letter re
garding the Rainbow Agenda's
protests at the Cornerstone
Weekend (Daily, May 19) was
rash. He wrote that "to interrupt
speakers with chants and bal
loons is simply impolite" and that
Secretary of State George Shultz
was an "injured party" who
deserves a "special apology."
The issues involved in the
protest are not simple; they are
complicated and need to be dis
cussed. The protesters expressed
their views with minimal inter
ruption. The chanting was brief
and occurred only twice — be
tween speeches. The signs and
slogans of the group were not
offensive. The balloons were a
silent but effective way of commu
nicating concern for an issue.
The nondisruptive protest of
the Rainbow Agenda was not a
"denial of a man's right to be
heard." Shultz was able to give
his speech. He expressed his
views on the stage while the
protesters silently made theirs in
the audience.
Grant seems to have chosen not
to hear the issues presented by
the Rainbow Agenda. He has that
choice. He was not forced to listen
to their concerns; he was merely
invited to become more aware of
the problems they are trying to
address.
Regarding Shultz. in an ideal
democracy citizens have a chance
to communicate with their
leaders. The protesters took ad
vantage of a great opportunity to
present their views to both Uni
versity President Donald Kennedy
and the secretary of state.

Their protests did not spoil the
celebration. They did not show
disrespect for Shultz as a person
but were communicating a dis
satisfaction with his policies.
There is a real beauty in a
democracy. At a celebration of
past accomplishments, mistakes
can be acknowledged and differ
ent attitudes can be represented.
The protesters showed a respect
for Stanford, not only as a pres
tigious, century-old university,
but as an educational institution
with the ability to effect positive
change.
The celebration was an example
of democratic debate at its best.
The fact that the Rainbow Agenda
had the opportunity to express its
views is a tribute to Stanford and
our country.
In the Soviet Union, citizens
have to "show respect" for their
leaders. Real respect is not a
facade, it is being honest with
others about your own views and
listening to those of others. I
thank the Rainbow Agenda for
sharing their views and hope that
they continue.

the community
Often missing in the news
about fraternities and sororities
is that it is a lifetime adult com
mitment and includes service to
the community. For the 15th
time, Alpha Omicron Pi sorority
alumnae sponsored a book fair
which has contributed almost
$38,000 to local research through
the Arthritis Foundation.
This would not have been pos-

sible without the help of strong
Stanford backs. With short notice
the Phi Delta Theta fraternity
spent several hours moving 8,000
books for the sale at San Antonio
Mall on May 8. It was a great
example of old and young
working together.

Disappointed
I admit to being a naive college
student in that I take a positive
attitude toward human nature. I
believe that people will not inten
tionally try to steal or cheat
others. In essence. I expect and
assume a ldt from people, espe
cially fellow Stanford students.
A recent incident, however, has
shaken this confidence. I atten
ded the tri-sorority formal held
May 15 at the Saint Francis Hotel
in San Francisco. I wore a blue
blazer which, perhaps, was not
the wisest choice since a majority
of the men there wore similar
coats.
At the end of the dance, my
coat was gone. The jacket could
have easily been taken by
mistake. What has shocked me.
however, is that my wallet was in
the blazer and that I have not
received word yet about it.
The wallet did not contain too
much money or credit cards, but
it did have important IDs and
irreplaceable pictures in it. I am
more disappointed but still an
gered that a fellow Stanford stu
dent could not just call me to
return something of little value to
him but of great importance to
me.
