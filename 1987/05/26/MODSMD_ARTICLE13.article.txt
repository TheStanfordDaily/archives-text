# Avoid keeping a safe distance

### 
My lover. Derrick, and I have chanced to
catch the last 10 minutes of at least three
Rodin Garden tours. We have always been
quite impressed by the breadth of knowledge
and insight shared by the tour guides. Each
guide adds her own unique personal touch.
With every tour, we learn something new about
each piece (at least those at the end of the
tour). We remember in particular one woman
who Invited us to closely examine and feel the
features and contours of the sculptures. People
on the tour did not hesitate to partake in such
close inspection.

A few weeks ago, on a warm, moonlit night,
we took a walk through campus. The Rodtn
sculptures in the Quad took on a strange, new
quality. Rodin had designed his works with
moonlight in mind (so we had been told).
On the west side of the Quad near Varian
Hall, we happened upon a Rodin piece whose
shadowed eyes seemed cast toward the
brightly lit Segal piece entitled "Gay Libera
tion."
What did these hard, ancient eyes think of
those nearby fragile limbs? Would (hey, too.
stand the test of time? We invited him to exam
ine the Segal work more closely, but he chose
to keep his distance. We wondered as we ap
proached the two frozen couples if students
ever do stop and think what Segal might be
trying to say: or do they. too. keep to a safe dis
tance — guilty by association, even with
artwork?
Like the Rodin tour guides. I cannot tell you

exactly what was in the artist's mind. But I can
share my own reflections on Segal's art piece.
As I looked closely at the couples, societal
stereotypes seemed to come to life.
We often look for those behaviors or appear
ances that make it easier for us to label a per
son "gay." I have caught myself at times, upon
finding out that a person 1 know or whom I
have met is gay. suddenly becoming keenly
tuned to mannerisms or speech patterns. And
as a gay person. I realize that I am subject to
the same scrutiny.
Most important, however, Segal's work em
phasizes that regardless of how a person acts,
speaks or loves she or he has the right to live
with respect.
1 assumed when I first looked at the couples
that the four figures were gay. But it does not
necessarily have to be so. Could it not be that a
straight person is reaching out to the gay per
son? Could the artist be creating a lifelike
tableau where straight and gay reach out to
each other without fear? Could he not be en
visioning a day when students quickly travers
ing to classes are not shocked or repulsed
upon seeing gay people and/or straight people
touching affectionately or walking hand in
hand?
This past Saturday. Derrick and I attended
Santa Clara University's Senior Ball. We were
the first gay couple to attend (so we had been
told). Nobody snickered, laughed or made rude
remarks. On the contrary, we received much
positive feedback. We had a hell of a time, and
judging from all the people dancing on top of
tables, we sure didn't inhibit anybody else's
fun.
Were we not like the first black couple or ra
cially mixed couple to attend such a formal?

Not only gay people
must have the courage
to come out.

People often have a knack for respecting those
who choose to live their lives openly with integ
rity and dignity.
However, we must have the opportunity to
encounter face to face that which we fear
before we can rid ourselves of groundless
stereotypes and misconceptions.
It is our hope that many of the Stanford com
munity were able to learn about gay men and
lesbians during this month's Gay and Lesbian
Awareness Week. Education and awareness
are our best allies in combating our worst
enemy — fear.
So do not fear to take a close look at the Segal
art piece. If his vision of what society could be
is to become a reality, not only gay people must
have the courage to come out of the closet.
Straight people, too. must be comfortable
enough with their own sexuality to "risk"
being with gay people — perhaps attending a
GLAS-sponsored event or even taking a close
look at a work of art.
If you want another "guide's" opinion, ask
someone wearing this year's GALA Week shirt
what Segal's work means to him or her (the
two Segal couples are pictured on the shirt). By
the way. just maybe that gazing Rodin man Is
saying. "It's about time."
