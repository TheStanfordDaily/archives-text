# In pursuit of happiness
## 
### 
Dear reader, this is what I've done this quarter:
twelve papers averaging four pages each, six problem
sets, two midterms, two sets of library research exer
cises, four Daily columns and a senior thesis pro
posal. And I wrote three short stories for no other
reason than, as Truman Capote said, "When God
gives you a gift, he also hands you a whip; and the
whip is intended solely for self-flagellation." Coming
up are three final exams and the glorious GRE. Yes,
yours truly is pursuing happiness in some strange
ways.

I decided one thing — and one thing only — could
alleviate this great weight upon my shoulders. I
decided I would whine in public. Why not whine?
Americans have to smile all the time, but
mouseketeers good humor is not for me. Not for me
the cheery hello, the wave of the hand, the
sharing/caring groove. I wish I were French. I'd
bicycle in a beret and sneer at tourists. I hear that's
what the French do.
So suppose I put this theory into practice, turn
this silence into art, go stand in White Plaza and
whine aloud — what then? Do I get the attention, the
sympathy, the sorrow and the pity?
Not without leaflets I don't — and it's too late to get
the 100 free copies from Kinko's. I could go to
Kinko's in my PJ's like the man in the ad and whine
about the high cost of Xeroxing, but I don't have a
car or even a license.
"Why me?" I howl, I shriek like the engine of a Lear
jet. Hey, I've got a passport and a charge card. I could
leave the country. So I should have bought that $200
one-way ticket to Rome last April. I don't speak Ital
ian, that's not fair. All I want to do is leave the
country. That's not a lot to ask.
So I get this itch to commit libel. It would be lovely
to slander people in print. But The Daily isn't the
place and 1987 isn't the time. Give me five years and
a nom de plume and I'll have some stories to tell. Bet
ter watch out, better not cry. Dear reader, I'll never be
rude to you! Hysterical maybe, but never impolite.
Writers are allowed to make things up. Of course,
names will be altered (slightly), sexes will be changed
(to fascinating effect) and in-jokes will abound. Get
it? I swear by the novelists' disclaimer: Any
resemblance to actual persons is strictly coinciden
tal. Cross my heart, hope to die, stick a needle in my
eye.
Here now, a paragraph devoted entirely to code
words relating to recent academic experiences. This
is for my own satisfaction and for the amusement of
the initiated. I'll put them into quotations. I swear

they're fictionalized. "Tomato, Roy Orbison, dress
like a man." "Moo, oink." "Wolfishness." "Chant
it. .
What's next? Now for the epigrams. I've gotta get
these epigrams into print. These are all of my own
authorship, by the way. It's really weird when I say
something and people ask, "What's that from?" like
I'm quoting the words of another. Can I quote
myself? Call me Miss Quote.
Pop Tarts are not sacramental. Life can be boring
but sleep is always an adventure. Infinitives are
meant to be split. Woody Allen is Walt Disney for
grown-ups. Typos often resemble Swedish.
What's next? I try to keep my life in order, but
"Things fall apart, it's scientific." My faithful electric
tea kettle is broken. I plug it in but the current
doesn't flow, the water doesn't boil. What a grand
gesture on the part of science, to slap me in the face
and send me on a search for a modern pot. It's an ab
surd universe when Walgreen's is the only place that
carries hot pots, and they're out. They've ordered 12
for Tuesday, but I need to survive the weekend. Sci
ence and Macy's have both failed me. What else Is
there to do but pay my bills?
I could tell secrets, conversations I've overheard,
rumors and lies. You, dear reader, would have to
swallow it all. And some few of you will whisper, "Is
she talking about me? Does she mean me?" Dear
reader. I don't.
But suppose that I revealed some classified infor
mation? Each one of you would haVe to chew up this
column and swallow it in order to preserve national
security. You'd do that for your country, sure.
I could air my grievances. I believe the math and
science distribution requirements should have been
waived for me. I believe the knowledge of foreign lan
guages should be injected at birth. I believe bugs are
evil.
What did you say. dear reader? That this isn't the
bitch column you thought it would be? Then I
apologize for not meeting your expectations. My ram
bling thoughts, you know, are more interesting than
most people's rambling thoughts. You know, those
sentences that pull your mind like a string of subway
cars, all colorful and rattling.
Dear reader, if you are surreptitiously reading this
Daily in class, you may be whispering to your neigh
bor something like. "What an ego this columnist has!
How narcissistic she seems to be!" A fortune cookie
told me I had the wisdom of the ages at my fingertips.
Are you going to argue with that?
Given the choice between the wisdom of the ages
and new clothes. I'd have to think about it. I'd like to
incarnate myself as a magazine with automatic self
turning pages, always something new and advertise
ments keyed to parts of the body.
What a self-indulgent column. What a social
column. Dear reader, promise me you will buy the
hardback editions of all my novels.
Erica Olsen is a junior in English. This is her last
column.
