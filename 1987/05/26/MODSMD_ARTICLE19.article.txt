## Friends and Helpers: Beyond the lecture hall 
### LISA BROOKS 
Many students complain be
cause they don't have the opportu
nity to get to know their profes
sors outside of the lecture hall.
Those students Involved In the
Friends and Helpers program tell a
different story, however. Their wil
lingness to donate a few hours a
week to help retired professors
has enabled them to learn a great
deal about the scholars' profes
sional and personal lives.
Friends and Helpers was formed
In 1982 by students enrolled in a
SWOPSI class called "Support Sys
tems for the Elderly."
Concerned about the problems
that the elderly must face as a
result of aging, the students
decided to start the organization
as a service to professors.
"One of the misconceptions
about aging is that the elderly are
shut up in nursing homes and
can't do anything for themselves.
That just isn't true," said senior
Sung-Hee Rhim, the group's sec
retary/treasurer.
"The people that we help are all
sharp mentally and are fairly ac
tive but need help doing some
tasks that have become difficult
for them to handle by themselves,"
she said.
Student volunteers are matched
up with the professors and then
work out schedules to come over
and help. Generally, the students

visit once a week for a couple of
hours and help with household
chores, research projects and
other such tasks.
This commitment runs into ob
stacles like summer vacation and
overseas study, but some students
have managed to maintain rela
tions with their "friends" for
several years. Currently, there are
23 pairs of students and profes
sors.
One of the problems is balan
cing the numbers of friends to hel
pers. There are more friends than
there are helpers, and with
graduation and summer vacation
looming, the ratio of emeriti to
students will grow even larger.
Friends and Helpers will hold a
membership drive next fall to
recruit more student volunteers
and will continue to send out let
ters to encourage retired faculty to
join.
Eventually, the group would like
to be able to provide services to
retired staff and alumni as well as
to emeriti professors.
The Steiners got Involved in the
program this quarter thanks to
senior Linda Roberts, who
recently joined Friends and Hel
pers. They are active individuals
who want to maintain indepen
dence for as long as possible.
Kurt Steiner taught in Stan
ford's Political Science Depart
ment for many years and is cur
rently working on a book about

the Tokyo war trials, in which he
was a prosecutor. Kitty Steiner is
an avid gardener and likes to take
care of the housework by herself.
"We got the letter last year, but
didn't do anything about it." Prof.
Steiner said.
"There was a certain reluctance
on our part to get involved with
the program â€” it means an ad
mission you can't do everything
you're supposed to do," he said.
According to Rhim. Steiner's re
action is common and is one of
the biggest problems the organi
zation faces in trying to persuade
retired faculty to get involved.
"One of our problems is that the
professors see it as a charity
thing." Rhim noted.
"We're trying to stress that it's a
mutual activity. In fact, many of
the students feel that they get
more out of it than the people they
help." she said.
Junior Tony Arroyo, who will be
one of the organization's directors
next year, agreed with Rhim. He
has helped Jim Douglas, professor
emeritus of civil engineering, with
gardening and small projects
around the house. Arroyo said he
feels the professor has contrib
uted at least as much to their rela
tionship as he has.
"We young people don't always
have enough experience to see
things in their proper perspec

tive," Arroyo said.
"The elderly have more wisdom
than we do. Just being able to
share that wisdom is what I've got
ten out of this the most," he said.
Both the Steiners and
Stenbock-Sermor acknowledged
that one of the valuable aspects of

the program is the fact that they
come into contact with college stu
dents.
"All the years I taught 1 had con
tact with young people." Steiner
said. "I think that it kept me
younger than those who haven't
had that contact at all."

"By seeing young people we stay
alive and keep in touch with
reality." Stenbock-Sermor said.
"Friends and Helpers is some
thing more than a business rela
tionship. it's something human,"
she said. "It bridges the genera
tion gap."
