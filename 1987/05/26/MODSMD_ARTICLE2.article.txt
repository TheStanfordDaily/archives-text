Stanford left no doubt as to who is
the best team on the West Coast this
year by sweeping four straight games
at the West I Regional to earn its
fourth College World Series berth in
the past six years.
While its primary rivals for the title
— Pepperdine and Cal State-Fullerton
— faltered twice to lose their
regionals. Stanford did not drop a
game in the double elimination
tournament at Sunken Diamond.
Of the Cardinal's four victories, one

was dramatic and three were em
phatic. Yesterday's clincher fell into
the latter category, as Stanford rolled
over Oral Roberts 9-4 behind eight
strong innings from Jack McDowell
and a balanced 15-hit attack.
Balance was the key word for Stan
ford, both yesterday and throughout
the weekend. Seven Cardinal players
had multiple-hit games yesterday,
with left fielder Ruben Amaro leading
the way with three.
"We've got a little bit of everything,"
Stanford Coach Mark Marquess said.
"The key thing when you look at our
statistics is that we've got six guys

with over 30 RBIs. When everybody's
doing it, that's special. I like this
team."
"We find a way to do it.and that's
the sign of a great team," said fresh
man right fielder Paul Carey, who was
named the tournament MVP. "It's not
just one guy. Everybody does it."
Stanford will meet Georgia, winner
