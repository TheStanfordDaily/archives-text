# Card sweeps into Omaha
## SPORTS 
### TOM SENF Senior staff writer 
Stanford left no doubt as to who is
the best team on the West Coast this
year by sweeping four straight games
at the West I Regional to earn its
fourth College World Series berth in
the past six years.
While its primary rivals for the title
— Pepperdine and Cal State-Fullerton
— faltered twice to lose their
regionals. Stanford did not drop a
game in the double elimination
tournament at Sunken Diamond.
Of the Cardinal's four victories, one

was dramatic and three were em
phatic. Yesterday's clincher fell into
the latter category, as Stanford rolled
over Oral Roberts 9-4 behind eight
strong innings from Jack McDowell
and a balanced 15-hit attack.
Balance was the key word for Stan
ford, both yesterday and throughout
the weekend. Seven Cardinal players
had multiple-hit games yesterday,
with left fielder Ruben Amaro leading
the way with three.
"We've got a little bit of everything,"
Stanford Coach Mark Marquess said.
"The key thing when you look at our
statistics is that we've got six guys

with over 30 RBIs. When everybody's
doing it, that's special. I like this
team."
"We find a way to do it.and that's
the sign of a great team," said fresh
man right fielder Paul Carey, who was
named the tournament MVP. "It's not
just one guy. Everybody does it."
Stanford will meet Georgia, winner
of the Northeast Regional in Atlanta
— figure that one out — Saturday in
Omaha. Neb. According to Carey, yes
terday's win was a mission accom
plished. "Our goal from the begin

nlng was to get to Omaha." he
said.
Oral Roberts Coach Gary
Vaught likes Stanford's chances
at Rosenblatt Stadium. "They've
got a good opportunity to go and
win the thing," he said. "I wish
'em all the luck in the world. It
makes us look better every time
they win a ballgame."
The Cardinal didn't make the
Titans look too good In the first
six Innings, taking a 7-0 lead. "We
couldn't have played better,"
Marquess said. "We had good
pitching and some two-out hits. It
was perfect baseball."
While Stanford pecked away at
Oral Roberts starter Greg Oram
for single runs in the first, third,
fourth and fifth Innings and three
in the sixth, McDowell was put
ting a steady stream of goose eggs
on the Titan half of the score
board.
Whether McDowell could come
back strong after pitching six in
nings Friday against Minnesota
was answered quickly when the
junior right-hander struck out
seven in the first four innings.
McDowell, who was named to the
all-tournament team, painted the
outside corner at will with sliders
and kept the Titans honest with
his fastball, which was at less
than top speed but still close to 90
mph.
"It (pitching on two days' rest)
was something I'd never done
before, but I feel real good, real
strong," McDowell said.
"He was a lot sharper than on
Friday," said catcher Doug Rob
bins, another member of the all
tourney team. "He had excellent
location on his fastball, his slider
was sharp and he threw in a few
splits (split-fingered fastballs) to
keep the lefties off balance. When
Jack throws his game, he's almost

unbeatable."
Carey was unbeatable yester
day, going 2-for-2 with three RBIs
to raise his regional average to
.643 and his RBI total to 10, both
tournament highs.
After Carey staked Stanford to a
2-0 lead with two-out RBI singles
in the first and third, the Cardinal
picked up an unearned run in the
fourth and an RBI fielder's choice
by David Esquer in the fifth.
Stanford finally got out of bi
nary scoring mode in the sixth,
putting the game — and almost
Titan catcher Pete Schmidt — on
ice.
After Mark Machtolf led off with
a single, second baseman Frank

Carey smoked a grounder inside
first into the right-field corner.
Machtolf came barreling toward
home, and though it appeared he
could have slid around Schmidt
safely, Machtolf — an ex-Cardinal
linebacker — chose the more
direct route, crashing into
Schmidt as the relay arrived to
score Stanford's fifth run.
Carey then scored on a single by
Amaro, who later came across on
Paul Carey's sacrifice fly. It was
the only ball Carey hit all weekend
that did not go for a base hit.
The Titans finally got to
McDowell in the seventh on Steve
Hecht's RBI triple, but the Card
inal got that one back and one

more in the bottom of the inning
when Amaro stroked his second
RBI single. Another run scored on
the play when center fielder Rich
Bordas let the ball go under his
glove for an error.
Stanford's only bad inning came
in the top of the eighth. The Card
inal had not committed an error
in 25 postseason innings until
three miscues, three singles and a
two-run homer by Rick Vaughan
made the final score 9-4.
After Steve Chitren had re
corded the last out, Carey was
asked what the Cardinal would be
doing before leaving for Omaha on
Thursday. "I don't know, probably
party." he said.

Stanford first baseman Ron Witmeyer collides with Washington State catcher Jeff Hooper to score the
tying run in the ninth inning Sunday. Catcher Doug Robbins followed close behind to give the Cardinal
the 12-11 win.
