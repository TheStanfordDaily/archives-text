# Bug goes bananas on singled-out stickering
##

Dear Bug Me:
How come every banana
bunch in modern history has had
a company sticker on it? You
never see stickers on apples or
grapes or pomegranates or any
thing like that. What's the story?
- Chtckie Ta
This is another example in the
growing list of things that just
are. Nobody knows why, they just

are. Nobody knows why the stamp
vending machines at the post of
fice are always broken. Nobody
knows why the University installs
water-saving heads on the dorm
showers but not the lawn
sprinkler system. Nobody knows
why butter in California comes in
cubes instead of sticks like in the
(rest of the) civilized world.
Nobody knows why someone
doesn't tune up the bells on
Hoover Tower to keep them from
being so sadly flat. (Apologies to all
who've asked these and many

more unknowables). Likewise
nobody knows why bananas are so
singled out for stickering.
The folks in the banana depart
ment at Dole's fresh-fruit market
ing division in Florida tried to
fabricate something about the
feasibility of stickering bananas,
the competitiveness of the banana
market and their desire to make
Dole's fananas instantly recog
nizable.
Conveniently enough, this is a
world of habit, tradition and
follow-the-leader. If something

like banana-stickering gets
started, the folks at Rica Banana,
Chula, Banacol and Turbana will
keep up with it â€” just to be
keeping up with it. Very simple,
very easy.
Dear Bug Me,
For the longest time I've been
nursing a theory oj elevator
cable-snap survival. IJ the
elevator you're riding in snaps its
cable and does a free Jail down to
the bottom, why not just ride
along down until you're about a

half a second Jrom the ground
then jump up. Instead of landing
as if you'd fallen 300 feet, you'd
land as if you'd fallen two and a
half. Makes sense, doesn't it?
Why don't people ever do that?
- Linus Van Pelt
That's a nice thought. Unfor
tunately, it's not going to be very
effective. Think first about how
fast the elevator would be going by
the time it hits the bottom of the
shaft. Neglecting all the things
that first-year physics students

usually neglect, the elevator car
would be going 138.6 feet per
second after falling its 27 stories.
You would have to be the Bionic
Man to jump that fast. Guessing
that you'd jump a couple of feet
high, your maximum velocity
would be 10.3 feet per second (for
a half-meter leap). Unluckily
though, 138.6 ft/s minus 10.3 ft/s
still equals a 128.3 ft/s. or about
as fast as you'd be going if you'd
fallen 23 stories instead of 27.
Jump or no jump, it's still going to
be a pretty frightening splat.
