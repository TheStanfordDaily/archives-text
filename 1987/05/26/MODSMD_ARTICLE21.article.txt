To reach the West I Regional
final. Stanford turned to its egg
buying offense, scoring runs a
dozen at a time to post wins over
Washington State. UC-Santa Bar
bara and Minnesota.
The victories put Stanford in
the enviable position of having to
win just one of two games yester
day to earn a spot in the College
World Series. By contrast. Oral
Roberts, which lost 9-4 to Stan
ford In the regional final yester
day, was faced with the task of
winning five consecutive games
after losing its opener 10-5 to
Washington State Friday.
Although yesterday's triumph
_was the official clincher, Stanford
may have won its trip to Omaha
the previous day with its thrilling
12-11 victory over Washington
State. Had the Cardinal lost, it
would have to come back right
away and beat Oral Roberts, then
defeat Washington State twice the
next day.
The game was simply a classic.
The Cardinal and Cougars bat
tered each other for 23 runs and
25 hits, including six doubles and
four homers, before Stanford won
the see-saw battle with a three

The teams traded runs in the
first, then the Cougars took con

with a single in the Cardinal
fourth, but WSU freshman Tom
McGraw escaped further damage
by inducing Brian Johnson to hit
into a double play with runners at
the corners and one out.
The Cougars got that run back
in the fifth and appeared to put it
away in the sixth when Jeff
Hooper's tremendous homer
landed on the soccer field behind
the left-field fence to put WSU up
7-2.
But that's when things got in
teresting.
With one out in the bottom of
the sixth, Stanford first baseman
Ron Witmeyer sliced a line drive
that WSU left fielder Terrel Han
sen played as if he were a wide
receiver running a post pattern
when the play called for a flag. Two
walks and a Paul Carey single
made the score 7-3, then Ruben
Amaro sent a drive to left that
Hansen butchered into a three
run double.
The comeback continued in the
seventh when Carey plated Ed
Sprague with a long double to left
center to tie the game. It didn't
stay tied for long, as two batters
later Robbins rocked Shawn Hat
haway's first pitch off the left-field
scoreboard to put the Cardinal
ahead 9-7.
As Robbins said later, "I
thought it was going to win the
