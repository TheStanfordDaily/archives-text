# Thriller Sunday keyed Card sweep

### TOM SENF Senior staff writer 
To reach the West I Regional
final. Stanford turned to its egg
buying offense, scoring runs a
dozen at a time to post wins over
Washington State. UC-Santa Bar
bara and Minnesota.
The victories put Stanford in
the enviable position of having to
win just one of two games yester
day to earn a spot in the College
World Series. By contrast. Oral
Roberts, which lost 9-4 to Stan
ford In the regional final yester
day, was faced with the task of
winning five consecutive games
after losing its opener 10-5 to
Washington State Friday.
Although yesterday's triumph
_was the official clincher, Stanford
may have won its trip to Omaha
the previous day with its thrilling
12-11 victory over Washington
State. Had the Cardinal lost, it
would have to come back right
away and beat Oral Roberts, then
defeat Washington State twice the
next day.
The game was simply a classic.
The Cardinal and Cougars bat
tered each other for 23 runs and
25 hits, including six doubles and
four homers, before Stanford won
the see-saw battle with a three
run ninth.
The teams traded runs in the
first, then the Cougars took con
trol with three in the third off
Stanford starter Rob Wassenaar
on a two-run homer by Rob Smith

and a wild pitch.
Doug Robbins drove in a run
with a single in the Cardinal
fourth, but WSU freshman Tom
McGraw escaped further damage
by inducing Brian Johnson to hit
into a double play with runners at
the corners and one out.
The Cougars got that run back
in the fifth and appeared to put it
away in the sixth when Jeff
Hooper's tremendous homer
landed on the soccer field behind
the left-field fence to put WSU up
7-2.
But that's when things got in
teresting.
With one out in the bottom of
the sixth, Stanford first baseman
Ron Witmeyer sliced a line drive
that WSU left fielder Terrel Han
sen played as if he were a wide
receiver running a post pattern
when the play called for a flag. Two
walks and a Paul Carey single
made the score 7-3, then Ruben
Amaro sent a drive to left that
Hansen butchered into a three
run double.
The comeback continued in the
seventh when Carey plated Ed
Sprague with a long double to left
center to tie the game. It didn't
stay tied for long, as two batters
later Robbins rocked Shawn Hat
haway's first pitch off the left-field
scoreboard to put the Cardinal
ahead 9-7.
As Robbins said later, "I
thought it was going to win the
game." So did most of the 3,112
fans at Sunken Diamond, but the
Cougars had other ideas.
In the eighth against Stanford
relief ace Steve Chitren. WSU
loaded the bases with one out for
Hooper, who was 4-for-4 on the
day. Chitren. however, got the all
tournament designated hitter to
pop up on the first pitch and got
ahead of Pete Blanksma 0-2.
On the next pitch, though,
Blanksma was able to fight off an
inside pitch for an RBI single.
Chitren then grooved a 3-1
delivery to pinch hitter John
Olerud, one of the Cougars' start
ing pitchers, and the freshman
nailed it to left-center for a three
run double.
Stanford was still trailing 11-9

when Carey led off the ninth with
a single to center off Joe Urbon.
After Wltmeyer walked, catcher
Randy Snyder came out from be
hind the plate to pitch. Snyder
walked Robbins on four pitches to
load the bases, then threw a ball to
Jeff Saenger.
"Coach Marquess told me to hit
away on the assumption that he
would try to get a strike on me, so 1
was looking fastball," Saenger
said.
Saenger got the fastball on the
next pitch and sent a rocket to the
wall in right-center. In order to tag
up In case of a catch, Wltmeyer
held at second until the ball
dropped, but Robbins was run
ning all the way.
The two went the final 180 feet
only a couple strides apart, and as
they rounded third, it appeared
for one frightening moment that
WSU would turn one of the most
bizarre double plays In NCAA his

tory. "I think a good throw gets
them both," Marquess said.
It was not a good throw,
however, and both runners scored
to set off a jubilant celebration
that began at home plate before
moving to meet Saenger as he
trotted in from second.
The Pacific 10 Northern Divi
sion champ is usually the Rodney
Dangerfield of its regional, and
usually deservedly so. but the
Cougars got respect, if not a win.
"If those guys were in (the
Southern Division), they would
give everybody a hard time,"
Saenger said.
UCSB had given Stanford a
hard time in Santa Barbara,
taking two of three from the Card
inal in a February series, but
Gaucho-killer A 1 Osuna won his
second game of the year against
UCSB with 4 1/3 innings of
shutout relief to lead Stanford to a
12-5 victory.

Stanford starter Lee Plemel en
tered the game with a 5-0 record
and a 1.49 ERA at Sunken Dia
mond but had been beaten twice
by UCSB In Santa Barbara. Unfor
tunately for Stanford, the second
trend continued as the Gauchos
took a 3-1 lead with three runs In
the bottom of the first.
Plemel held the Gauchos until
the Cardinal — or Carey — could
get to UCSB starter Dan Peters. In
the fifth, the freshman right
fielder came to the plate with the
bases loaded and one out.
A strong breeze was blowing out
toward left field — a fact not lost
on Carey, who has hit many of his
11 homers to left, his opposite
field, this year. "I was looking for
an outside pitch to drive to left,"
he said.
On a 3-1 delivery, he got it and
sent a high shot into the jet
stream and over the fence for a
grand slam that put Stanford

ahead 5-3. "We thought it was a
routine fly ball the way (left fielder)
Quinn (Mack) was going after it.
but it just kept carrying, carrying
and carrying," UCSB Coach A 1
Ferrer said.
Mack must have taken notes on
Carey's blast, because he hit
nearly an instant replay in the bot
tom of the inning to tie the game.
In the sixth, however, the Card
inal erupted for a six-run, six-hit
rally to send the Gauchos packing.
Friday's regional opener
featured strong pitching from
Jack McDowell and Brian Keyser
and a two-out hitting clinic by the
Cardinal offense in Stanford's 18-
hit. 12-1 thrashing of Minnesota.
Stanford scored two in the first,
one in the second and four in the
third — all with two outs —
against Minnesota starter Darren
Knight. In the third, the Cardinal
came up with five straight two-out
hits. "Coach Marquess really em
phasizes that when you get two
outs or two strikes to battle hard,
not let the guy beat you," Robbins
said.
With the early cushion,
McDowell cruised through the
first six innings.

that WSU left fielder Terrel Han
sen played as if he were a wide
receiver running a post pattern
when the play called for a flag. Two
walks and a Paul Carey single
made the score 7-3, then Ruben
Amaro sent a drive to left that
Hansen butchered into a three
run double.
The comeback continued in the
seventh when Carey plated Ed
Sprague with a long double to left
center to tie the game. It didn't
stay tied for long, as two batters
later Robbins rocked Shawn Hat
haway's first pitch off the left-field
scoreboard to put the Cardinal
ahead 9-7.
As Robbins said later, "I
thought it was going to win the
game." So did most of the 3,112
fans at Sunken Diamond, but the
Cougars had other ideas.
In the eighth against Stanford
relief ace Steve Chitren. WSU
loaded the bases with one out for
Hooper, who was 4-for-4 on the
day. Chitren. however, got the all
tournament designated hitter to
pop up on the first pitch and got
ahead of Pete Blanksma 0-2.
On the next pitch, though,
Blanksma was able to fight off an
inside pitch for an RBI single.
Chitren then grooved a 3-1
delivery to pinch hitter John
Olerud, one of the Cougars' start
ing pitchers, and the freshman
nailed it to left-center for a three
run double.
Stanford was still trailing 11-9

when Carey led off the ninth with
a single to center off Joe Urbon.
After Wltmeyer walked, catcher
Randy Snyder came out from be
hind the plate to pitch. Snyder
walked Robbins on four pitches to
load the bases, then threw a ball to
Jeff Saenger.
"Coach Marquess told me to hit
away on the assumption that he
would try to get a strike on me, so 1
was looking fastball," Saenger
said.
Saenger got the fastball on the
next pitch and sent a rocket to the
wall in right-center. In order to tag
up In case of a catch, Wltmeyer
held at second until the ball
dropped, but Robbins was run
ning all the way.
The two went the final 180 feet
only a couple strides apart, and as
they rounded third, it appeared
for one frightening moment that
WSU would turn one of the most
bizarre double plays In NCAA his

tory. "I think a good throw gets
them both," Marquess said.
It was not a good throw,
however, and both runners scored
to set off a jubilant celebration
that began at home plate before
moving to meet Saenger as he
trotted in from second.
The Pacific 10 Northern Divi
sion champ is usually the Rodney
Dangerfield of its regional, and
usually deservedly so. but the
Cougars got respect, if not a win.
"If those guys were in (the
Southern Division), they would
give everybody a hard time,"
Saenger said.
UCSB had given Stanford a
hard time in Santa Barbara,
taking two of three from the Card
inal in a February series, but
Gaucho-killer A 1 Osuna won his
second game of the year against
UCSB with 4 1/3 innings of
shutout relief to lead Stanford to a
12-5 victory.

Stanford starter Lee Plemel en
tered the game with a 5-0 record
and a 1.49 ERA at Sunken Dia
mond but had been beaten twice
by UCSB In Santa Barbara. Unfor
tunately for Stanford, the second
trend continued as the Gauchos
took a 3-1 lead with three runs In
the bottom of the first.
Plemel held the Gauchos until
the Cardinal — or Carey — could
get to UCSB starter Dan Peters. In
the fifth, the freshman right
fielder came to the plate with the
bases loaded and one out.
A strong breeze was blowing out
toward left field — a fact not lost
on Carey, who has hit many of his
11 homers to left, his opposite
field, this year. "I was looking for
an outside pitch to drive to left,"
he said.
On a 3-1 delivery, he got it and
sent a high shot into the jet
stream and over the fence for a
grand slam that put Stanford

ahead 5-3. "We thought it was a
routine fly ball the way (left fielder)
Quinn (Mack) was going after it.
but it just kept carrying, carrying
and carrying," UCSB Coach A 1
Ferrer said.
Mack must have taken notes on
Carey's blast, because he hit
nearly an instant replay in the bot
tom of the inning to tie the game.
In the sixth, however, the Card
inal erupted for a six-run, six-hit
rally to send the Gauchos packing.
Friday's regional opener
featured strong pitching from
Jack McDowell and Brian Keyser
and a two-out hitting clinic by the
Cardinal offense in Stanford's 18-
hit. 12-1 thrashing of Minnesota.
Stanford scored two in the first,
one in the second and four in the
third — all with two outs —
against Minnesota starter Darren
Knight. In the third, the Cardinal
came up with five straight two-out
hits. "Coach Marquess really em
phasizes that when you get two
outs or two strikes to battle hard,
not let the guy beat you," Robbins
said.
With the early cushion,
McDowell cruised through the
first six innings.
To reach the West I Regional
final. Stanford turned to its egg
buying offense, scoring runs a
dozen at a time to post wins over
Washington State. UC-Santa Bar
bara and Minnesota.
The victories put Stanford in
the enviable position of having to
win just one of two games yester
day to earn a spot in the College
World Series. By contrast. Oral
Roberts, which lost 9-4 to Stan
ford In the regional final yester
day, was faced with the task of
winning five consecutive games
after losing its opener 10-5 to
Washington State Friday.
Although yesterday's triumph
_was the official clincher, Stanford
may have won its trip to Omaha
the previous day with its thrilling
12-11 victory over Washington
State. Had the Cardinal lost, it
would have to come back right
away and beat Oral Roberts, then
defeat Washington State twice the
next day.
The game was simply a classic.
The Cardinal and Cougars bat
tered each other for 23 runs and
25 hits, including six doubles and
four homers, before Stanford won
the see-saw battle with a three
run ninth.
The teams traded runs in the
first, then the Cougars took con
trol with three in the third off
Stanford starter Rob Wassenaar
on a two-run homer by Rob Smith

and a wild pitch.
Doug Robbins drove in a run
with a single in the Cardinal
fourth, but WSU freshman Tom
McGraw escaped further damage
by inducing Brian Johnson to hit
into a double play with runners at
the corners and one out.
The Cougars got that run back
in the fifth and appeared to put it
away in the sixth when Jeff
Hooper's tremendous homer
landed on the soccer field behind
the left-field fence to put WSU up
7-2.
But that's when things got in
teresting.

the sixth, Stanford first baseman
