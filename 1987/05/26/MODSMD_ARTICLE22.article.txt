# Marathon win put Titans into final
## 
### CHRIS MYERS Editorial staff 
The few spectators who saw
Oral Roberts University play in
last Friday morning's opening
game of the West 1 Regional at
Sunken Diamond would have
been quite incredulous if anyone
had told them that the fourth
seeded Titans would still be
around for the tournament's
championship game yesterday.
Certainly, the Minnesota Gop
hers from the rough, tough Big
Ten would have been a little dis
believing. And the Wichita State
Shockers, who had defeated the
Titans four straight times in the
regular season, would no doubt
have been, well, shocked. And the
Washington State Cougars, who
pummeled Oral Roberts both
during the regular season and in
Friday's opening game, probably
would have laughed their heads
off.
But the Titans rebounded from
their opening-game loss and made
believers of the Gophers, the
Shockers, the Cougars and other

observers as they roared through
the losers' bracket into the cham
pionship matchup with Stanford.
Yesterday afternoon's game was
the first that most tournament
spectators saw of the Titans. Oral
Roberts played its first three
games of the regional at 9 a.m. —
pretty early by baseball standards
— and the team's fourth game was
so long and ugly that most fans
fled before the Titans won it. 14-
13 in 12 innings over Washington
State.
Certainly, the Titans' first-game
performance didn't gain them a
lot of admirers. Oral Roberts was
downright horrible in the opener,
losing to Washington State 10-5.
It turns out that the Titans were
just getting used to playing ball in
the morning. They rubbed the
sleep out of their eyes and came
back with a vengeance Saturday
morning against Minnesota,
which had dropped its opener to
Stanford.

five-hitter from left-hander Brad
