### JOHN LIS Editorial staff 
Things didn't look promising for Paul Carey
Friday afternoon.
The freshman right fielder for Stanford had
struck out his first three times at the plate against
Minnesota in his first regional game ever. Stan
ford was on its way to an easy 12-1 win. but its
cleanup hitter was having problems.
Carey had even thrown out Minnesota's Brian
Raabe at the plate in the bottom of the third to
end a Gopher rally, but struck out his next time
up. "I thought that would pick me up," Carey said.
"But my next at-bat I struck out again. I kept my
head up — they were pitcher's pitches, on the
black of the plate. My teammates picked me up
after that."
An understatement. Carey picked up two walks
and an eighth-inning single Friday, then
proceeded to get nine hits in his final 11 at-bats,
drive in 10 runs, hit a grand slam Saturday
against UC-Santa Barbara to key a 12-5 Stanford
win, lead off the ninth inning Sunday against
Washington State with a single to start a three
run rally in a 12-11 victory, and drive in another
three runs in yesterday's title game.
Carey was named the Most Valuable Player of
the tournament with a .643 average. He got a hit
every time he hit the ball save one — a sacrifice fly


Paul Carey is congratulated after his fifth-inning grand slam Saturday gave Stan
ford a 5-3 lead over UC-Santa Barbara. Carey was 9-for-14 with 10 RBIs in the four
regional games and was named MVP.
