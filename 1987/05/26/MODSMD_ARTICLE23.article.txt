### JOHN LIS Editorial staff 
Things didn't look promising for Paul Carey
Friday afternoon.
The freshman right fielder for Stanford had
struck out his first three times at the plate against
Minnesota in his first regional game ever. Stan
ford was on its way to an easy 12-1 win. but its
cleanup hitter was having problems.
Carey had even thrown out Minnesota's Brian
Raabe at the plate in the bottom of the third to
end a Gopher rally, but struck out his next time
up. "I thought that would pick me up," Carey said.
"But my next at-bat I struck out again. I kept my
head up — they were pitcher's pitches, on the
black of the plate. My teammates picked me up
after that."
An understatement. Carey picked up two walks
and an eighth-inning single Friday, then
proceeded to get nine hits in his final 11 at-bats,
drive in 10 runs, hit a grand slam Saturday
against UC-Santa Barbara to key a 12-5 Stanford
win, lead off the ninth inning Sunday against
Washington State with a single to start a three
run rally in a 12-11 victory, and drive in another
three runs in yesterday's title game.
Carey was named the Most Valuable Player of
the tournament with a .643 average. He got a hit
every time he hit the ball save one — a sacrifice fly


Paul Carey is congratulated after his fifth-inning grand slam Saturday gave Stan
ford a 5-3 lead over UC-Santa Barbara. Carey was 9-for-14 with 10 RBIs in the four
regional games and was named MVP.
yesterday.
"1 wasn't thinking MVP at all,"
Carey said. "It was a team win —
anyone could have gotten it. From
one to nine, everyone hit. everyone
contributed."
But it was a converted first
baseman from Weymouth. Mass..
who hit and contributed more
than anyone. "1 could see it in bat
ting practice." Stanford Coach
Mark Marquess said. "I was
staying behind the screen, be
cause he was hitting rockets.
Saturday against UCSB. the
Cardinal trailed 3-1 through four
innings and had only three hits,
one of them an RBI double by
Carey in the first. But in the fifth,
a single by Frank Carey and walks
to Ruben Amaro and Ed Sprague
loaded the bases with one out. Up
came Paul Carey.
"I hit the ball well, right on the
barrel," Carey said. "1 don't know
if the wind helped it. I thought it
was out, but the left fielder deked
us, going back on it like he had a
chance."
He had no chance. The Gauchos
tied the game in the bottom of the
Inning, but Carey picked up his
sixth RBI of the game in the sixth
inning to cap a six-run uprising
and eliminate UCSB.

Doug Robbins homer that gave

Stanford a 9-7 lead. But Steve
Chitren surrendered four runs
after coming on In the eighth, and
Carey was leading off the ninth
with the Cardinal down by two.
Carey quickly got behind 0-2,
survived a dropped foul tip, and
fought back to 2-2. "I had to take a
strike." Carey said. "I have enough
confidence in myself to hit with
two strikes. In the eighth Inning
we were kind of shaky. In the
ninth, we knew what to do. Coach
Marquess said. 'Just take a strike,
hit your pitch, and get on base for
us.' "
Carey delivered a single to cen
ter. Walks to Ron Witmeyer and
Doug Robbins set the table for Jeff
Saenger. who cleared it with a
three-run double to right-center.
