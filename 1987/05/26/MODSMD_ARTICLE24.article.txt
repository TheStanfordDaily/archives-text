# Saenger and Robbins combine on key play
## 
### CHRIS FIALKO Editorial staff 
The amount of time a baseball player
spends in the spotlight just doesn't matter.
For example. Stanford designated hitter
Jeff Saenger basked in the spotlight for
about 20 dramatic seconds on Sunday af
ternoon. Meanwhile, Cardinal catcher Doug
Robbins toiled for every inning of every vic
tory in the Stanford sweep of the West I
regional this past weekend at Sunken Dia
mond.
In the end, however, not only did both
players' contributions loom just as impor
tant in sending Stanford to the College
World Series, but Robbins and Saenger
both reacted to their feats with the same
amount of modesty.
"It's surprising what happens when you
put the ball in play." Saenger said of his
game-winning, bases-clearing double in the
bottom of the ninth against the Washing
ton State Cougars on Sunday.
Surprising may be one word to describe
Saenger's piece of work, but incredible
might be a better one. With the bases
loaded, no outs and Stanford trailing the
Cougars 11-9 In the bottom of the ninth.
Saenger came out of the cold and windy
Cardinal dugout to face the hard-throwing
Randy Snyder.
Saenger then promptly stroked the
second pitch into the right-center field al
ley. scoring all three runners and sending
the 3.000-plus fans into a frenzy and the
Cardinal into yesterday's championship
game.

But afterward Saenger was rather
subdued about his big hit.
"He's (Snyder) the one who supplied the
power." Saenger said. "1 was just saying.
Stay within yourself and I just met the
ball."
The junior from Alamo went further to
push the credit away from himself.
"(Stanford Coach Mark) Marquess did a
great job of coaching," Saenger said. "I was
told to hit away on the assumption that he
(Snyder) would be trying to get a first strike
in."
And the left-handed Saenger. who usually
only plays against right-handed pitchers,
went so far as to say it didn't even matter
that it was him at the plate.
"If they (Washington State) had brought
in a lefty (to pitch), then (righty hitter Mark)
Machtolf would have done the job." he said.
Robbins did the job behind the plate and
in the batters box all weekend long. The
junior went 7-for-16 with five RBIs. includ
ing two home runs. Those two homers
matched his total for the entire regular
season.
In addition. Robbins slammed the door
on an Oral Roberts rally in the eighth in
ning of yesterday's championship game by
sacrificing his body to tag runner Brad Rob
inson out at the plate.
Of course, in true Saenger style. Robbins
thought it was no big deal.
"Rube (right fielder Ruben Amaro) made
a pretty good throw — a one-hopper." Rob
bins recalled. "I was just thinking catch the
