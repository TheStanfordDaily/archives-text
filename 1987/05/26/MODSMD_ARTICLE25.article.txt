# Card track falters at Pac-10s
## 
### ERIK STEN Editorial staff 
Memorial Day weekend turned out to be
something less than memorable for Stanford
men's track. In fact. It was downright forget
table.
On paper, the men's track team looked good
for 40 to 50 points and a sixth- or seventh
place finish in the Pacific 10 Conference cham
pionships. If everything went well, fifth looked
within reach. After ending up seventh in last
year's meet, the Cardinal had hoped to climb
higher in the standings of the Pac-10. the na
tion's toughest track conference.
But Friday and Saturday in Corvallis, Ore.,
paper was about the only thing Stanford
looked good on. On the track, the men's team
managed only one second place and three
fifths, a performance good for 14 points and
last place in the conference, 162 points back
from first-place UCLA.
"Murphy's law could be a good way to
describe it," distance runner Marc Olesen said
of the meet. Although Olesen was the team's
only bright spot, taking second place in the
1.500 meters with a time of 3:45.63, the senior
still called the weekend "very disappointing."
"We just didn't come through when it

counted." Olesen added.
"We expected to do much better." Asst.
Coach Dave Wollman said. "You can make a
million excuses, but it would be a waste of time
to use any of them. Last year things came to
gether. this year they didn't."
For the women, things came together about
as well as could be expected. Stifled by injuries
and a lack of numbers, the Cardinal was able
to bring only eight athletes to the first-ever
Pac-10 championships for women.
The group placed in seven events and scored
30 points to finish in ninth place overall. 25
points ahead of last-place Oregon State.
"The women did an exceptional job." Woll
man said. "They all competed and performed
well."
The big story for the Cardinal was javelin
thrower Erica Wheeler. After being injured for
much of the early season, the sophomore came
to Pac-lOs with a total of only five weeks
practice and a couple of competitions under
her belt.
The short season, however, seemed to have
little effect on Wheeler as she threw 174 feet, 5
inches, and placed second in Friday's javelin
final. The mark also qualifed Wheeler for the
NCAA championships, which will be held in
Baton Rouge, La., June 3 to 6.

"It's real nice to get a breakthrough from
Erica," Wollman said. "It's really a pretty
amazing story â€” to get your shoulder
separated early on, and then make it back to
the NCAAs."
Joining Wheeler on the high-scoring list* for
the Cardinal were sophomore Patty Purpur
and freshman Carol Gray. Purpur placed
fourth in both the shOtput and the discus with
throws of 50-0 and 175-9 respectively, and
Gray placed fifth in the 3,000 at 9:39.6 and
third in the 5.000 at 16:23.6.
Senior team captain Pam Board contributed
the rest of the Cardinal's points with a third
place finish in the 400 hurdles at 59.46.
The fifth-place finishers for the men were
Glenn Schneider in the discus with a throw of
185-11, Brian Marshall in the high jump at 6-
10 3/4 and the mile relay at 3:15.4.
For most of the team, the outdoor season is
now over, the exception being the handful of
athletes who have qualifed for the NCAA cham
pionships. At this point, five athletes from the
women's and one from the men's team have
bettered the national standards. A few addi
tional runners will travel to Eugene, Ore., this
weekend for one final chance at qualifying.
"We're a young group and everyone is com
ing back," Wollman said.
