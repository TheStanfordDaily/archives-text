Into the pink night they typed
and tipped mightily like buzzards
perhaps in the final stages of meat
exhaustion, perched incon
clusively on the flaking rusting
rain gutter that tunneled approxi
mately infinitude, eyes sunken
into manged, feathered skulls and
who are we to say that this is
nothing John Lis has ever seen
before in his life?
Disgusted with life, editors
emeritus, and blood-sucking edi
torial boards, they trudged on.

On the train to the long-winding
river, they took a plush red seat
and stared out into the cold, hot
fresh dew and wondered how they
got here, and why A.P. isn't just a
news wire anymore. You can say
one thing about the summer
editor: Dog spelled backwards is
God, but Bob spelled backwards is
still Bob.
Rolling like a thunderous, pon
derous, erotic Dylan tome — there
could be no end to this train ride,
only a pause ... at the Daily Ban
quet, May 29. Be merrily, sing
there.
