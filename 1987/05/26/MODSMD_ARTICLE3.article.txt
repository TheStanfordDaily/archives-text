# Synergy will not be co-op
## 
### CLAY CALVERT Staff writer 
The Round Two results of the Draw are in, and the
numbers aren't what the residents of Synergy House
wanted to see.
Synergy was unable to fill 14 of its 33 residence
spaces and will lose its status as a co-op next year,
according to Rodger Whitney, assistant dean of stu
dent affairs and director of student housing. The
house at 664 San Juan Drive will become a self-op.
House residents are fighting the change by solicit
ing faculty support and by circulating a petition that
reads, "I would prefer to live in Synergy rather than
any other choice if it would mean that Synergy would
remain a co-op." So far, according to Synergy resi
dent Glenn Smith, the petition has been signed by
70 students.
The guidelines for changing the program status of
a University residence state that houses "that have
demonstrated difficulty filling in the Draw in recent
years must fill at least 90 percent of their undergrad
uate assigned spaces by the end of Round Two in the
1987 Draw or their program will be changed," Whit
ney said.
In years past, Synergy had struggled to reach the
90 percent level and in recent years has had great dif
ficulty filling its available spots. Whitney said.
After the Draw results were released last week.
Synergy residents were given the option of petition
ing to become a self-op or a University-operated
residence next year, according to Diana Conklin. as
sistant dean of student affairs and director of the
Row. The residents chose to become a self-op.
In a self-op, residents hire a professional cook,
while members of a co-op cook for themselves.
University-operated residences are supplied by Uni
versity Food Service.
Whitney said he wasn't surprised that Synergy
didn't fill the required number of spaces, noting that
23 spaces were vacant after the first round.
"They've had problems filling after Round Two for
the past several years, but this is probably the worst
it has ever been," Whitney said.
Karl Hall, the resident assistant at Synergy, said
house reaction to the news is "quite varied."
He said one primary concern is that the number of
graduate students in the house would be reduced
next year and possibly phased out in two years. Hall
called graduate students "an extremely important
aspect" of Synergy, noting that 10 graduate students
live there now.
