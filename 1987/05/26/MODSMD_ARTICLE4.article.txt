# Psychiatry prof. resigns after audit of expenses
## 
### DIANE BISGEIER Senior staff writer 
Dr. Philip Berger, psychiatry
professor at the Stanford Medical
School, resigned Friday in the
wake of a University audit which
showed that for the last four years
he had used federal grant money
for purposes which were not prop
erly chargeable to the grant.
The audit, performed last fall,
prompted the Department of Psy
chiatry to return * 128.804.86 to
the National Institute of Mental
Health (NIMH). Vice President and
Dean of the Medical School David

Korn also appointed a faculty com
mittee in December to "look into
potential professional miscon
duct" in the Psychiatry Depart
ment, according to medical school
spokesman Spyros Andreopoulos.
The committee's findings were re
ported back to Korn, who does not
plan to take any further action in
light of the resignation, according
to Andreopoulos.
"The University has closed the
matter." said Andreopoulos, add
ing that any further action now
rests with the NIMH. The agency
gave $5 million to a team of Stan
ford doctors for the study of the bi

ological bases of psychiatric disor
ders, according to Dr. Helena
Kraemer, acting coordinator of
the program since November.
Kraemer said the Clinical Re
search Center (CRC) receives
several grants supporting its re
search. but the NIMH grant is "a
major one." Because several doc
tors are involved with the project,
their research work has continued
during the investigation.
"I'm concerned about two
things: that Dr. Berger goes on
with his career, and that the CRC
keeps going," she said.
NIMH is a branch of the federal

National Institutes of Health,
which will give Stanford approxi
mately $107 million in research
money this fiscal year, according
to Andreopoulos.
Berger had served as the prin
cipal investigator for the CRC for
the past 10 years. He has pub
lished over 200 papers and books
on the biological implications of
several psychological illnesses.
Berger declined to comment
Sunday on his resignation; but
stated in a University press release
that he planned to work on
"several important writing proj
ects which I have been wanting to

complete." He also said he plans to
continue his research on the bio
logical causes of severe mental il
lnesses.
The audit did not suggest that
the money was appropriated for
personal use. There was, however,
speculation that some of the
money went toward the salary of
Berger's wife, Meredith, who
worked as a secretary in the Psy
chiatry Department before resign
ing in November, according to the
Peninsula Times Tribune.
That money could not be shown
to be pertinent to the project, ac
cording to Kraemer, who later
stressed that she had not seen the
final report, which is now at
NIMH.
"Our main concern now is to
find a new principal investigator
and director for the program,"
Kraemer said. "It's not going to be
easy."
