# Farm aims for $1.1 billion
## 
### STEPHEN KASIERSKI Senior staff writer 
This is the first of a four-part series examining Stan
ford's Centennial Campaign.

Stanford is looking for money. Big money.
As the University celebrates its 100 th anniversary
over the next five years. Stanford also begins the
Centennial Campaign, a heralded fund-raising effort
designed to net ® 1.1 billion in contributions for both
ongoing support and new objectives.
Officially launched February 10. the Stanford cam
paign is the largest fund-raising effort In the history
of higher education.
Although the lofty goal may seem unrealistic. Uni
versity officials and alumni volunteers have spent
the last five years developing fund-raising strategies
and programs.
And Stanford fund-raisers expect people to be
skeptical. When Board of Trustees President Warren
Christopher joined University President Donald Ken
nedy and volunteer campaign co-chair Roy Anderson
to formally introduce the campaign. University offi
cials pointed proudly to a dazzling total of contribu
tions that had poured in even before the official an
nouncement.
Stanford's approach is no different than a com
mon ploy of street performers — put a few coins in
the instrument case to entice in
terested bystanders to add their
own contributions.
By February the Centennial
Campaign coffers were bulging
with more than small change.
Stanford entered the campaign
with a hefty $307 million in
pledges and donations received in
the previous six months. Dubbed
the "Nucleus Fund." the $307 mil
lion was 28 percent of the fund
raising target for the entire five
year effort.
But announcing a major cam
paign with a such a sizeable start
up fund is "fairly typical" of fund
raising efforts of this magnitude,
said Richard Bennett, associate
campaign director for the Office of
Development.
"There was a lot of push before
the public announcement to get
up to a nice number," he said.
According to Bennett, fund
raisers rely on early contributions
from the University's "closest
friends" to essentially reassure po
tential donors that the campaign
goal is attainable.
For the purposes of the cam
paign. Stanford's "closest friends"
are an assortment of prominent
alumni, corporations and founda
tions that have a strong record of
contributing to the University

chest.
"We felt that if we made a public
announcement that had less than
$250 million, it would seem like a
tremendously long way to go. . . .
It shows that those closest to you
— the trustees, volunteer leader
ship and largest donors — believe
in the objectives and are support
ing you."
The campaign received large
commitments from David and
Lucile Packard ($7O million).
William Hewlett ($5O million) and
the Carl F. Braun Trust ($lO mil
lion). Gifts from every member of
the Board of Trustees also totaled
more than $30 million.
As of April 10. Stanford had
received a total of $335 million in
campaign gifts, including $171
million for continuing support
and $164 million for featured
campaign objectives.
Nearly half of the $1.1 billion
campaign goal, or $533 million,
will be for continuing support of
existing programs — funds Stan
ford would have hoped to raise in
the next five years whether or not
the campaign existed.
An additional $567 million is
targeted for four featured cam
paign objectives: undergraduate
education ($lO6 million), modern
science and engineering facilities
including the Campus Near West
development ($lBO million), fac
ulty and graduate student support
($206 million) and unrestricted
gifts ($75 million).
