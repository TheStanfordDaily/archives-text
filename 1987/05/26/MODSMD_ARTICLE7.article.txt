### ERIN MARTIN Staff writer 
Tonight's forum on racism
at Stanford, beginning at 7
p.m. in Kresge Auditorium,
is designed to explore
minority problems in an at
mosphere of "education and
understanding," according
to Amanda Kemp. Black Stu
dent Union chair and mem
ber of the Rainbow Agenda.
The University-sponsored
event will be introduced by
President Donald Kennedy
and will consist of a series of
statements from representa
tives of four minority groups
on campus.
According to Kemp, stu
dent speakers will share
some of their own experi
ences with racism at Stan
ford. "We hope to explain
and answer questions about
racism here, in a place
where it is particularly insti
tutional," said Kemp.
"People have to reach to
the middle to understand
and get the information
about minority groups." she
said.
A panel of Stanford admi
nistrators. students and fac
ulty members will mediate
the discussion.
The forum is the Univer
sity's response to the first of
two demands made during a
21-person sit-in staged by
the Rainbow Agenda at the
president's office in Building
10 on May 18.
The sit-in followed the
Rainbow Agenda's submission of
a six-part explanation of their spe
cific demands.
Incoming BSU Chair Bill King
said with regard to the sit-in and
the preceding Centennial protest
that the forum will clarify "some of
the reasons behind the last two
weeks."
King stressed the fact that the
Rainbow Agenda's demands are
drawn "almost directly from those
made by the BSU in 1968 and by
Asian Americans in 1973."
In 1968. following the assas
sination of Dr. Martin Luther
King Jr.. the BSU drafted a list of
demands calling for improvement
of minority life at Stanford. In
1973. the Asian American Stu
dent Association submitted a pro
posal for better minority services
for Asian American students.
A number of the demands made
by those groups are being
reiterated by the Rainbow Agenda.
These include requests for a dean
of minority affairs, restructured
allotments of financial aid and a
new AASA center.
"It shows how things have not
changed." King said. "Twenty
years later, we are still asking for
the same things."
