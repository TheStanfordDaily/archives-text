Donovan acquitted on all charges
NEW YORK — Former Labor Secretary Raymond Donovan, the
nation's first Cabinet officer Indicted while In office, was found In
nocent yesterday of all grand larceny and fraud charges after an
eight-month trial In state court.
The panel, which deliberated for 9 hours, also found his seven
co-defendants innocent of all charges in connection with a sub
way construction contract.
Donovan stood with arms folded as the jury's foreman read the
verdict. As he was proclaimed innocent on the first and most
serious count of grand larceny, the former seminarian made the
sign of the cross.
His wife. Catherine, who was seated in the gallery, clutched a
friend's hand and sobbed.
Donovan, 56, resigned as secretary of the Department of Labor
in March 1985, six months after he was indicted.
In Washington, President Reagan voiced his pleasure with the
jury's decision.
The jury spent two days deliberating after a trial capped by two
days of tumult in the courtroom when juror Milagros Arroyo, 30,
became emotionally distraught and was dismissed.
Judge John Collins on Saturday added an alternate juror who
had heard all the evidence at the trial but had not been in on the
beginning of deliberations.
The 137-count state indictment, filed Sept. 24, 1984, con
cerned Donovan's work as executive vice president and part
owner of the Schiavone Construction Co. of Secaucus, N.J.,
before he joined the Reagan administration in 1981.
Security agents overstep bounds
JERUSALEM — Israel yesterday plunged into a major new con
troversy over state security versus human rights after its Supreme
Court ruled that agents of the country's main internal-security
service used illegal interrogation methods and gave false court tes
timony In a military espionage case.
The landmark decision could call into question the convictions
of hundreds of Palestinian prisoners for security offenses. Such
convictions are based largely on testimony from agents of the Shin
Bet security service, and on confessions obtained from the
accused.
Palestinian lawyers said yesterday they would push to have
many of these cases reopened.
The court Sunday night freed a former army lieutenant who
spent seven and a half years in prison for allegedly selling state
secrets and stolen weapons to Palestinian guerrillas in southern
Lebanon in the late 19705.
The court upheld the claim of the officer, Izat Nafsu, a Moslem of
Circassian ethnic origin, who contended he had been framed by
senior officials of Shin Bet.
Nafsu contended — and lawyers for the Shin Bet did not deny —
that he had been kept awake for days and nights, forced to stand
outside in winter for hours and ordered to take repeated cold
showers. He said investigators had threatened to arrest his
mother and wife and force them to strip in public.
Shin Bet lawyers denied accusations that Nafsu had been
beaten, kicked and slapped while under questioning but admitted
that the agency had destroyed most of the transcripts of his inter
rogation.
The court upheld a two-year sentence on the lesser charge that
Nafsu held an unauthorized meeting with a Palestinian guerrilla
leader but it threw out the rest of his 18-year sentence and ruled
he had spent five and a half years wrongfully in prison.
Contra aid cutoff ineffective
WASHINGTON - On April 4, 1985, just 10 days after the
Nicaraguan contras received a secret $15 million Saudi Arabian
deposit that the White House had helped arrange to replace funds
cut off by Congress, President Reagan told reporters he thought
the contras were "close to desperate straits."
The president did not say — and Congress would not know for
another 20 months — that the Nicaraguan rebels, flush with
Saudi funds, were increasing the size of their irregular army, or
dering new arms and munitions and preparing for a June offen
sive.
The congressional cutoff of all U.S. aid. effective October 1984,
was intended to encourage the Sandinistas and the Reagan ad
ministration to negotiate. Instead, as documents and testimony
in the three-week-old congressional hearings on the Iran-contra
affair show, the president's determination to keep the contras
going had assured unanticipated consequences even before
Congress finally voted for the cutoff:
□ The direction of contra activities, which had been in the hands
of the Central Intelligence Agency since the start of the Reagan ad
ministration, shifted secretly to the White House and Lt. Col.
Oliver North of the National Security Council staff. Congress' in
tention to end U.S. involvement was ignored.
□ The contras. relieved of congressional funding limits and
ceilings, doubled in size within six months of the U.S. aid cutoff,
and their arms purchases were stepped up.
In May 1984, as CIA funding for the contras ran out, the White
House asked the Saudi government to fill the gap. From July 1984
until February 1985, the Saudis contributed $1 million a month
to a contra bank account in the Cayman Islands.
Constitutional bicentennial opens
PHILADELPHIA — Two hundred years after delegates from the
13 original states gathered here for a hot summer of debate, a
celebration of fireworks, food and fisticuffs marked the opening of
the bicentennial of the United States Constitution.
Amid solemn speeches by Vice President Bush, former Chief
Justice Warren Burger, six governors and Philadephia Mayor Wil
son Goode. a noisy crowd of 200 demonstrators across Indepen
dence Mall chanted slogans protesting U.S. support for the con
tras in Nicaragua and sang "We Shall Overcome."
Four demonstrators were arrested during a brief battle with
police who charged into the crowd of protesters after several tried
to cross the barricades to present a wreath to Bush "for all the vic
tims of his Illegal war in violation of the Constitution."
The Philadelphia celebration kicked off Friday night with jazz
and rock concerts and a 30-minute fireworks display along Ben
jamin Franklin Parkway, which attracted several thousand spec
tators.
W. Germany seeks hostage deal
BEIRUT. Lebanon — West Germany is seeking to conclude a
deal with the kidnappers here of two German businessmen that
would rule out the extradition to the United States of an accused
Lebanese hijacker, sources close to the kidnappers said.
The sources said West German officials have been negotiating,
through Iran, with Lebanese Shlite Moslems holding Rudolf
Cordes and Alfred Schmidt. The men were abducted here last Jan
uary. apparently in retaliation for the arrest in Frankfurt of
Mohammed All Hamadei. a Lebanese Shiite allegedly Involved in
the June 1985 hijacking of a TWA airliner to Beirut, in which a
U.S. Navy diver was shot to death.
The proposed deal provides that Hamadei and his brother. Ab
bas All Hamadei. who Is also in prison in Germany, would be tried
only on the relatively minor charges, the sources here said. The
German hostages would be freed at the conclusion of such a trial,
and the Lebanese men released after serving no more than six
months In prison, the sources said.
