### LORI SILVER Staff writer 
The newly-elected ASSU Senate voted last night to
support and allocate funds to the Rainbow Agenda
and called for the termination of the Jordan Scholars
program.
According to freshman Senator Michael Roark, 65
percent of the 200 freshmen offered admission to the
Jordan Scholars program decided not to come to
Stanford. Roark said he he had acquired the statis
tics from Assistant Director of Undergraduate Ad
missions Jonathan Reider.
While the Senate passed by a 13-4 vote a resolution
supporting the Rainbow Agenda, it also voiced its
support for the development of similar agendas by
other minority groups, such as the Gay and Lesbian
Alliance at Stanford (GLAS) and the Women's Center.
Debate centered on a proposed amendement to the
Rainbow Agenda resolution which would have called
for the Rainbow Agenda to accept all religious, racial
and sexual minority groups that requested to be in
cluded.
The Senate voted against the proposed amend
ment. instead calling for minority groups not in
cluded in the Rainbow Agenda to develop their own
agendas.
Council of Presidents member Leonard Adler called
the Senate's decision "a slap in the face" to women's
groups and GLAS.
In a separate resolution, the Senate voted to allo
cate $125 from its discretionary funds to the Rain
bow Agenda for purchase of fliers.
The Senate also passed a resolution recommend
ing "that the Admissions Office terminate the David
Starr Jordan Program, until such time as the pro
gram is re-evaluated within the entire Stanford com
munity."
"The elitism and stratification the program will
bring to the freshman class is not necessary," Roark
said.
"I think that most of us (freshmen) are pretty in
timidated," said Senator Timur Colak. "A program
like this will intimidate freshmen further during a
very, very fragile time."
