## THE
						STANFORD DAILY An Independent Newspaper Dead week debacle 
### 
Last Thursday, the Faculty Senate voted to
prohibit professors from giving finals during
Dead Week. This decision dilutes further a
Dead Week policy that is already weak.
The senate was guided in its decision by
some vague notions about students' wants.
"Students have been significant among the
individuals who have been very concerned"
about abuses of the old policy, the University
registrar told the senate. In addition, senate
members said their action would "close
loopholes" that exist under the current
policy. Maybe the senate would've been better
able to close some loopholes if it knew what
the loopholes were.
The fact that students have the option to
take a final during Dead Week isn't a
loophole in the Dead Week policy. It's one of
the few things about the Dead Week policy
that works. If students need to take an exam
before finals week because of extraordinary
circumstances — a personal problem, for ex
ample — then they should be allowed to do
so. Eliminating that option will not help stu
dents and will not "improve" Dead Week in
any way.
There was a motion on the senate floor
Thursday to insert an amendment into the
Dead Week Policy Statement that would have
allowed students to take an exam during

Dead Week for "exceptional personal
reasons." Although the amendment made
good sense, It was soundly defeated.
One faculty member argued against the
amendment because he said it would grant
an "unfair advantage to students with great
rhetorical powers." Well, students with
"great rhetorical powers" already have an un
fair advantage when it comes to convincing
wishy-washy professors of their hardships.
And to use such an argument in a discussion
about Dead Week policy is missing the point.
It's the policy that needs improvement, not
the ability of professors to deal with over
bearing students.
Unfortunately, the Faculty Senate's entire
debate about Dead Week policy missed the
point. Dead Week needs to be reformed, sure,
but not the way the senate says. The senate
didn't even address the real problems with
the week: Dead Week isn't dead. Classes
meet, papers and end-quarter projects are
due, and academic life goes on as usual.
If the senate truly wanted to address the
inconsistencies of Dead Week — and show
real concern for students' needs — it would
have canceled classes during that time.
That's the best — and the only — way to
reform Dead Week.
