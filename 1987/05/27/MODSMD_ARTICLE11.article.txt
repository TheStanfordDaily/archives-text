# Finishing ruminations

It is fitting that I write my final column at the last
minute. I've written every other one this way. so why
change now? It is also fitting that as I sit in front of
this computer, I have no idea what I'm going to write
about. This, too, is the way every other column has
begun.

I thought I'd make a cute little list of all the sub
jects I haven't written on, but some other columnists
beat me to it. Actually, I really don't have many in
mind, since, as I said before, each column is a mys
tery to me. My friends are very patient. Not only do I
ask them what they think is funny (I get all my ideas
from my geologist friend), but I constantly borrow
their computers. Only two more papers to go, guys.
I refuse to wax sentimental about my four years on
the Farm. That's just too sweet.
I'll mention, because I want to. the four best pick
up lines I know.
1. "What?"
2. "Is that really you?"
3. "Do you have to go to the bathroom?"
4. "I really like your programming style."
Now I've gotten that out of my system.
The sailing team wanted me to mention them.
I have been asked why I don't write about impor
tant issues. You see, I don't have any opinions.
(Right, Darryl?) My mind is a vacuum, and my
hovercraft is full of eels. Or, maybe, if I did have an

opinion on something, I'm not completely sure it
would be worth printing or reading. I could be wrong
about this — perhaps you have to be a freshman or a
future COP member to be certain that what you
think is valuable.
Once in a while I was tempted to write about na
tional issues, but to say that Donna Rice was a Hart
breaker was too easy, and the Reagan Administra
tion is already enough of a joke.
Why I write this column is a question I've asked
myself many times this quarter. Certainly it was not
to see my fetching picture in the paper every other
week. I cringe when people I don't know actually rec
ognize me from this lovely shot.
I could say I write this column to find out about
humor. Oh, by the way, the columns were supposed
to be funny — in case I didn't do a very good job.
Humor is often not funny at all, especially when
people don't laugh.
I could say I learned about newspapers by writing a
column. One intriguing aspect about the Daily that I
discovered was that it can't print chemical formulas
correctly. Watch this: "Water is really H20." See what
I mean?
So why did I write this column? Well. I'm reminded
of a television show that I watched as a child. This
show's format has already been used by funnier
people than I, but I'm going to steal it anyway. The
show is, of course. Mr. Rogers.
"Hello kids, and welcome to my neighborhood.
Today we're going to talk about why Kristen has been
writing for the Stanford Daily.
"Can you say she-doesn't-need-this-hassle?
"Can you say re-su-me?
I thought you could."
Hi Mom.
