Current debate
obscures issue
Your front-page story entitled
"Controversy mars spring trip"
(Daily, May 20) was a classic ex
ample of media distortion, so
often criticized by anti
intellectuals, intellectuals,
politicians and students alike.
The article attempts to make a
case that students who traveled
to El Salvador feel that they were
misled as to the purpose of the
trip, and that what was originally
described as a public service
opportunity (to help rebuild the
University of San Salvador) was
in reality an exercise in "leftist"
brainwashing.
I interviewed a number of the
students in the days following
their return from El Salvador (see
"Students return from El Sal
vador committed to peace."
Campus Report. April 1) and lam
quite certain that Patrick Jean-
Pierre. for example, would not
want to be viewed as critical of
either the intent or the outcome
of the trip.
According to my sources, in
cluding group leaders Law School
Associate Dean Thomas Mcßride
and the Rev. Herb Schmidt, only
one of the 14 students felt dis
gruntled that consciousness
raising rather than roof-raising
was the focus of the trip.
Yet Jean-Pierre's honest
response to the writer's question i
was used, out of context, to indi
cate wider dissension.
The casual use of the word
"leftist" In the first paragraph
ignores the most important politi
cal "truth" discovered by the
participants in the El Salvador
tour: that there is no middle' of
the bloodied dirt roads of El Sal-

vador.
By assuming that critics of the
Duarte regime are "one-sided"
members of "left-wing organiza
tions." the article plays into the
mindset shared by both the U.S.
and Salvadoran governments that
anyone who does not support
their actions is a communist
subversive.
The U.S. media commonly
echoes this sentiment, and their
dismissal of anyone they perceive
as "leftist" is only a softer version
of the Salvadoran government's
view of its opposition as dispens
able human beings.
If anything, the students said,
it was their meetings with U.S.
embassy officials, the Salvadoran
military and upper-class
businessmen which "radicalized"
their views on the present con
flict, and not their exposure to
so-called "leftist" ideology.
As a professional journalist. I
was deeply disturbed by the
writer's irresponsible use of the
media before he has even left the
starting gates of "the real world."

Salvador trip
had balance
The recent article entitled
"Controversy mars spring trip."
(Daily. May 20) did not accurately
represent the views of 13 of 14
student members and their ad
visors of the delegation to El Sal
vador.
A point the writer of the article
did not consider was that mem
bers of the student delegation
could recognize the political
orientations of both the leftist
and rightist organizations
visited, assess what each said
with a grain of salt and draw

their own conclusions.
Far from making a farce out of
the trip, the unique opportunity
to talk with students from the
politically active student group
AGEUS added to our educational
experience. We believe that being
able to talk with Salvadoran stu
dents our own age and learn their
views concerning their country,
was every bit as valid as our other
experiences.
One should not overlook that in
El Salvador civilians are dying in
a protracted war and many are
tortured for their political beliefs.
We think that it would be a
travesty to let the controversy
over the mechanics of the trip
overshadow the real issues that
need to be addressed in El Sal
vador.
