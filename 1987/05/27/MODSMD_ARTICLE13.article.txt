"A given society is racist or it is not ... it is
Utopian to try to ascertain in what ways one kind of
inhuman behavior differs from another kind of in
human behavior."

Unfortunately, under this definition America
qualifies as a nation as equally racist as South
Africa. Indeed, only the modes of oppression differ.
But perhaps the best way of identifying racism is to
examine the attitudes one has toward certain
abstract social concepts. The discussion in this let
ter shall center on one, respect, which has been
debated in the aftermath of the Rainbow Agenda's
protest during the opening "festivities" of Corner
stone Weekend.

The day after the Centennial protest. I was sub
jected to a number of students' complaints that the
Rainbow Agenda's protest was impolite and dis
respectful. The feeling was that by raising clenched
fists, releasing black balloons, and walking out on
George Shultz's speech, these disgruntled students
marred what would have been a brilliant Centennial
celebration in honor of "our" Stanford University.
With his typical "scathing analysis" Scott Lyon
(Daily, May 20) sums up what appears to be the
white majority opinion stating, "But for the coalition
to pounce on Rosse and Kennedy with terms such as
'disrespectful' is, well, disrespectful ... I'd like to
conclude by saying that the behavior of the Rainbow
Agenda leaves something to be desired."
And here we come to the question of respect. Un
fortunately. from the privileged, white majority posi
tion. it must be extremely difficult for one to assess
the true nature of respect. Namely, respect is a con
vention among equals to facilitate their human rela
tions. Protest groups, in this case the Rainbow
Agenda, are either not in the majority position or
they are in a position of power — they are not equals.
Protest means displeasure, anger, or even rage —
effective protests are not. and were never, of a beauti
ful aesthetic nature. Protest Is disrespect — it is a
statement to those in power that opposition, the
severest form of disrespect, will no longer be
tolerated. In America, disrespect means that the op
pressed will not respect Jim Crow, presidents who
have attempted to deny a history of American racism
and university presidents and trustees with blind
eyes and still tongues who will not recognize the
moral and social imperative to divest from South
Africa.
Amid the debate about respect for administration
and government authority. I have heard few ques
tions posed as to why those in the Rainbow Agenda
are extremely angry. Instead, we get Scott Lyon

critiquing their demands in his column only to con
clude that the "fervor of the administration is all too
evident, 'appropriate channels' will deal with the
demands carefully and convincingly."
Lyon never realizes that he is not the ultimate
judge of what is "careful" and "convincing" on the
matter of minority affairs. We have had enough of
the "appropriate channels," "respectful" observa
tions on our oppressed condition, and most of all.
white men determining the quality of our lives. For
when, as Amiri Baraka states, "Not only does the
white man oppress the Negro, but he is even going to
tell him how to react under the oppression," we
realize that the concept of respect is, in our condi
tion and in the present context, nonsense. And we,
refers not only to every black, but to every Chicano,
American Indian. Asian American, and woman as
well.

Indeed, all the white
male asks of us is that
we be respectful and pa
tient. . .[then] he may
consider heeding our
"recommendations."

Indeed, all the white male asks of us Is that we be
respectful and patient, and after demonstrating our
pacifist good will, he may consider heeding our
"recommendations." Exemplary of this ludicrous but
prototypical white male is Perry Friedman, who
writes, "No one likes to be pushed, especially the es
tablishment. I hope that the people in the Rainbow
Agenda keep this in mind and don't destroy any
gains that they may already have made. They are the
biggest source of racism I have encountered on
campus" (Daily. May 22).
I am only sorry that I was not among the Rainbow
Agenda protesters, raising my brown fist, releasing
black balloons and walking in that single file line
that made the local news before the Cornerstone
Weekend "festivities." Given the real possibility of vi
olent protest, it is with admirable restraint that the
Rainbow Agenda protested only with non
threatening fists and harmless balloons. How absurd
these measures seem in comparison to my gut
feelings concerning the "efficacious" reaction to our
oppression that I should be toting a shotgun and de
manding action now!

Agenda protesters, raising my brown fist, releasing
black balloons and walking in that single file line
that made the local news before the Cornerstone
Weekend "festivities." Given the real possibility of vi
olent protest, it is with admirable restraint that the
Rainbow Agenda protested only with non
threatening fists and harmless balloons. How absurd
these measures seem in comparison to my gut
feelings concerning the "efficacious" reaction to our
oppression that I should be toting a shotgun and de
manding action now!
