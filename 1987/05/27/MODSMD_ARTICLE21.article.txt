# Forty-Five Committee Seats Remain Available
## 
### 
In its final report to the Senate on May 19th, the Nominations
Commission placed students in 99 of the 144 available seats on
University committees.j
Each year, the Nominations Commission accepts applications
from students who want to serve on the committees of the Uni
versity. The Commission recommends one student for each posi
tion to the ASSU Senate, which then rejects or accepts that
person. The accepted names are then reported to the University
for final approval. Students serve with faculty and staff and can
speak and vote in committee.
Some committees receive a larger share of applicants than
others. Some positions therefore end up vacant while others have
heavy competition. Last year's Spring cycle left 55 positions open;
this year 45 remain vacant. The open positions will be filled in a
"fast cycle" in the Fall, as they were filled this year. The cycle will
begin the Monday that students return to school, and end 15 days
later.
Council of Presidents member Carey White believes the
vacancies are caused because the publicity is inefficient.
"People have no idea what committees do," he said. "They
don't see the work that goes on. We don't tell them what com
mittees do, so they don't apply. The ASSU News publishes a list of
the committees and what they do. Looks like we need more ad
vertising like that."
White also recommends re-directing applicants to other com
mittees.
