# MEANWHILE...

### 
Next year, each mcml -r of a University Committee will be
asked to send a quick report to the ASSU after each meeting.
Messages will be sent through LOTS and will send mail to a spe
cial account set up by the ASSU. The ASSU staff will then bind
these reports, make brief summaries and pass them on to the COP
and Senate. These summaries will also appear in the ASSU News.
This system will allow both the ASSU and students to moni
tor changes in University policy and give all those involved or af
fected time enough to respond to those changes. No more
libraries in the foothills, hopefully.
