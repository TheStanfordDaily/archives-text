# ASSU FEES, DESPITE THE NAME, DO NOT GO TO THE ASSU
## 
### 
Each quarter, the ASSU collects a small amount of money from
each student. This appears on the University bill. The money is
used to finance groups and publications such as the Daily, the
Band, and KZSU. The money does not go to the ASSU. The
University collects it, passes it to the ASSU, and the ASSU dis
tributes it to the student groups. Students voted in the general
election on which groups they would fund. Next year, the Uni
versity will collect $24 in the Fall, $25 in the Winter, $24 in
the Spring, and 11 in the Summer. The average amount paid
to each group per quarter is as follows:
Program Board $ 3.50 GSA $ 0.40
Publication Board 1.00 KZSU 1 0.20
ASSU Legal Couns. 1.50 LSJUMB 0.70
ASSU News 0.20 Stanford Action 0.30
