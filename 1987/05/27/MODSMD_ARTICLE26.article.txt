Not exactly.
These are the official names of four of
Stanford's 16 unhoused Greek organiza
tions, which together claim a member
ship of almost 900 Stanford students.
Members of these organizations say their
ranks are swelling.
Despite what some say is a lack of
visibility on campus, unhoused fraternal
organizations at Stanford are strong en
tities with dedicated and active members.
Statistics clearly attest to the present
strength of the unhoused system: 200
men pledge allegiance to seven unhoused
fraternities, while over 660 women, or 23
percent of the female undergraduate pop
ulation. are members of one of nine
sororities.
The unhoused organizations are also a
markedly diverse group in their racial and
sexual composition. There are three
predominantly black fraternities and two
predominantly black sororities.
Like their housed counterparts, un
housed organizations have parties,
mixers, formals. road trips and perform
charity work for a number of local organi
zations and homes.
Fraternal Affairs Director Joe Pisano
said these groups offer a valuable alterna

tive to those not interested in living in a
house.
"Some students like the flexibility of the
residential housing system here. Some
like co-educational housing. They also
want to have a stable community of
friends. Unhoused fraternities can give
them both," Pisano said.
He added that unhoused fraternities
can often pay more attention to the objec
tives of fraternal life than the housed fra
ternities because they do not have to

worry about the distraction of financially
managing a house or the accompanying
bureaucratic headaches.
Other advantages offered by the un
housed groups include less time being
consumed by the organization, the lack of
a negative image of the type associated
with the housed fraternities and a lower
frequency of incidences of misbehavior.
Pisano said.
Intrafraternity Council (IFC) President
Steve Singleton said the most valuable

contribution of the unhoused fraternities
to the University system is just their very
existence.
As far as the male fraternities are con
cerned, "1 think the most basic contribu
tion they offer is allowing people to be in a
fraternal organization without living in
an all-male environment," Singleton said.
He asserted that there is a difference in
the attitudes of housed and unhoused
fraternity members, but said he could not
characterize it.

Singleton said that friendships made in
unhoused organizations can be just as
strong as those formed in housed frater
nities, but it requires greater effort on the
part of members.
Kerry Dailey, vice-president of the IFC,
and a member of an unhoused fraternity,
said that he joined an unhoused organi
zation because he saw the benefits of
being in a fraternity and of not living in a
house â€” he could still keep his friends in
the dorm.
Dailey boarded at the Phi Delta Theta
and said he actually believes unhoused
groups are closer than some housed
groups because they have to make an ef
fort to "get together."
He praised unhoused fraternities for
being more diverse than their housed
counterparts and less rowdy. "Regardless
of who's there, having 40 people in a
house with no supervision lends itself to
getting out of hand sometimes," he said.
Dailey said the relationship between
unhoused fraternities and the IFC has
generally been good this year. Although
there has been a tendency in past years to
pay less attention to unhoused fraterni
ties because of their smaller financial and
material risks, they are now "treated
equal."
Recently elected Phi Kappa Psi Presi
dent Tom Griesser said he came to Stan
ford "anti-Greek" and only became inter
ested in fraternities when he heard about
the unhoused ones during rush in his

freshman year.
Griesser said he joined in the
first place because Phi Psi mem
bers showed a genuine interest in
him, not just a desire to gain an
other pledge.
He cited conformity as the cru
cial difference between house and
unhoused fraternities.
"In an unhoused fraternity
you're not all clustered together.
There's a lot more autonomy for
each person. I've felt very free to be
my own person." Griesser said.
He said unhoused groups pro
vide their members with much

greater exposure to issues not reg
ularly addressed in a
predominantly white, male enviro
ment because they are able to
remain in University housing.
Defending the unhoused organ
izations' right to be called fraterni
ties, Griesser said, "Fraternity
means brotherhood. I think brot
herhood means a lot more than
living in the same house. It's
based on association as opposed
to geographic location."
"We are not confined by four
walls," he stated.
Phi Kappa Psi pledge Jim An
derson said that he joined the fra
ternity in order to "meet a bunch
of new people."
"You still have another life

(outside of the fraternity), too.
You're not confined to these
people," Anderson said.
He admitted that one probably
does not get to know other mem
bers as well or as quickly as in a
housed organization. But, "I
think there's a kind of' Yeah, we're
glad we don't have a house' atti
tude," he said.
Anderson maintained that un
housed fraternities are authentic.
What makes an unhoused group a
fraternity is getting together often
and having a good time with
friends, he said. Anderson
opposed the view that unhoused
fraternities are any less fun.
"It's probably a little more mel
low, but I really don't have a basis
for comparison," he added.
