# Leather could mean gold for two Stanford entrepreneurs

### LISA BROOKS Staff writer 
Although they won't graduate until June, senior
Ricardo Gressel and graduate student David Room
have already started their own business and are
making a successful go of it.
Gressel and Room are the owners of David Gressel.
a company which sells specially designed leather ar
ticles, including coats, skirts, jackets, bags and
belts.
David Gressel began last October when Room went
down to Mexico and came across several leather bags
that he liked. He purchased several and brought

them to Gressel.
"I saw that these bags could do well," Gressel said.
"We went to the factory in Mexico and each invested
$2000 apiece in merchandise.
"When we got back we sold the bags in front of
Macy's in San Francisco and on Telegraph Avenue in
Berkeley. By December we had made our investment
back," he added.
By this time Gressel and Room were selling their
goods to several boutiques around the Bay Area.
Through their friends, the men were able to estab
lish contacts with these stores and thus were able to
make sales.
In addition to selling to boutiques, the entrepre

neurs have found themselves selling their goods on
the street and at "leather parties".
"A 'leather party' is along the same lines as a Tup
perware party," Gressel explained.
"We've done parties where the host invites a group
of his friends over. Depending on how many we sell
at the party, the host would either get a jacket at cost
or get it for free," he said.
From their initial stint with bags, Gressel and
Room became more sophisticated, and now their
items are personally designed by people they contract
with in Berkeley and Oakland.
They take their designs to Avi Montague, a fashion
consultant who helps them make decisions about

which designs will sell.
"Afterward, we develop a pattern, take it to Mexico,
and we may just make samples of it or go full force
with production, depending on how we think it
turned out." Gressel said.
"If we like the item we will generally make ten to
twenty pieces to sell," he added.
Gressel and Room have plans to expand the num
ber of wholesalers they sell to.
"After graduation we will put a portfolio together in
order to expand our number of wholesalers. We're
targeting San Francisco, Washington D.C., New York
