# Leather could mean gold for two Stanford entrepreneurs
## 
### LISA BROOKS Staff writer 
Although they won't graduate until June, senior
Ricardo Gressel and graduate student David Room
have already started their own business and are
making a successful go of it.
Gressel and Room are the owners of David Gressel.
a company which sells specially designed leather ar
ticles, including coats, skirts, jackets, bags and
belts.
David Gressel began last October when Room went
down to Mexico and came across several leather bags
that he liked. He purchased several and brought

them to Gressel.
"I saw that these bags could do well," Gressel said.
"We went to the factory in Mexico and each invested
$2000 apiece in merchandise.
"When we got back we sold the bags in front of
Macy's in San Francisco and on Telegraph Avenue in
Berkeley. By December we had made our investment
back," he added.
By this time Gressel and Room were selling their
goods to several boutiques around the Bay Area.
Through their friends, the men were able to estab
lish contacts with these stores and thus were able to
make sales.
In addition to selling to boutiques, the entrepre

neurs have found themselves selling their goods on
the street and at "leather parties".
"A 'leather party' is along the same lines as a Tup
perware party," Gressel explained.
"We've done parties where the host invites a group
of his friends over. Depending on how many we sell
at the party, the host would either get a jacket at cost
or get it for free," he said.
From their initial stint with bags, Gressel and
Room became more sophisticated, and now their
items are personally designed by people they contract
with in Berkeley and Oakland.
They take their designs to Avi Montague, a fashion
consultant who helps them make decisions about

which designs will sell.
"Afterward, we develop a pattern, take it to Mexico,
and we may just make samples of it or go full force
with production, depending on how we think it
turned out." Gressel said.
"If we like the item we will generally make ten to
twenty pieces to sell," he added.
Gressel and Room have plans to expand the num
ber of wholesalers they sell to.
"After graduation we will put a portfolio together in
order to expand our number of wholesalers. We're
targeting San Francisco, Washington D.C., New York
and Chicago to carry our wares."
Gressel said.
The two men are discussing the
possibility of opening a warehouse
in San Francisco and living there
to cut expenses. If they do. they
might open It up once a month for
special sales where they would sell
directly to consumers at wholesale
prices.

learned about Important legal and

financial aspects of running a

efforts to develop an efficient

seem to have a good knowledge of
Industry and are serious and sys

succeeding." he concluded.
Rachel Weisen, a Stanford stu
dent who produced the Imani
fashion show recently held at
Lagunita Court, and who is well
acquainted with the David Gressel

line, had nothing but praise for
the leather designs.
"Their stuff is very today, very
now." she said about the clothing
which was modeled during the
fashion show. "If 1 had the money
I'd buy one of their jackets
myself." she said.
Mary Friend, a salesgirl at
Andrea, a boutique in Berkeley,
acknowledged that David Gressel
items are expensive. The store
retails the jackets for *455 while
the jackets from other designers
sell for between *200 and *300.
"They're more expensive than
the others but it's obvious they're
not from a production line,''
Friend said.
She added that, "they're well
made and thoughtfully designed
and they will probably sell well."
