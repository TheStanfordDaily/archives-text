# Not so 'Briefly' after all...

### DIANE BISGEIER MARK ROGOWSKY Editorial staff 
How many times do you pick up
the Daily and really appreciate
what you read? Do you really stop
to consider how much time and ef
fort actually goes into the produc
tion of a daily paper?
Well, truth is. we really didn't
ourselves. Of course, being writ
ers. we knew to some extent the
stress an editor goes through, but
we could always go home once our
stories were finished. But the

editor. . .now that's a different
story. We always were a little
curious as to how our toils
managed to get from the computer
screens in Storke Publications
Building one night to the printed
journals all over campus the next
day.
Then, we discovered that the
Daily editors, in all their ingenu
ity. actually developed something
that would see just to that: The
First Year Staffers Issue. Or.
should we say. First Year Staffers
Nightmare.
The Daily offices are normally

packed by early evening. Tonight,
however, the place was a virtual
ghost town. The acting chief
editor sat alone for nearly two
hours, without an inch of copy to
read, trying to figure out how to
lay out a section about which he
knew nothing.
Soon afterwards, the regular
staff attempted to wreak havoc,
sabotaging our efforts with false
reports. But because their intelli
gence is limited, we managed to
see through their outrageous
schemes. And now, here we sit, in
genious. unable to be fool
ed. . .and still here at 3 a.m.
Nonetheless, the very fact that
you are reading this 67th issue of
Volume 191 of the Stanford Daily
is proof positive that we did
overcome.
The admirable efforts of many
courageous, young souls made
this issue possible and they
receive our unending gratitude.
The lame efforts of Managing
Editor David Risser and Editor In
Chief Michael Newman, who is
sporting a spectacular new hair
cut, to foil our brilliant work of
art, however, only receive our ut
most contempt. As journalists
with integrity, we choose not to
accept a few beers on a night off
serve as an adequate excuse for
behavior befitting junior high
school adolescents.
We hope that this little vignette
has been as educating for you as
this experience has been for us.
Try to savor today's Daily with a
little more fervor than usual now
that you know what went into It.
