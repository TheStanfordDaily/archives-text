## Living and dying on the 'River's Edge' 
### MARK TOMPKINS Editorial staff 
There's a new entry in the
controversy-on-a-low-budget gen
re of filmmaking. Just when the
ink spills over "Blue Velvet" and
"Platoon" have trickled to a halt,
another starkly uncompromising
movie — which somebody, some
where, was willing to finance —
busts loose.
"River's Edge" has already
outraged quite a few people, and
promises to have a distinguished
career in igniting controversy.
The film doesn't just rub some
people the wrong way; more
precisely, it body-checks them
into the wall. You like tasteful,
pretty movies? Then run — do not
walk — to the nearest exit.
"River's Edge" can't be bothered
with questions of artiness, nor
with mild-mannered reactions.
You end up either championing it
or loathing it.
It could have clawed its way out
of John Hughes' darkest
nightmares, this "River's Edge."
The plot: Samson (Daniel
Roebuck), a hulking teenage boy,
sits on a riverbank, unperturbed
by the naked corpse beside him.
The body is that of his girlfriend,
whom he has just strangled to
death. Later Samson tells his
"stoner" friends at school about
the murder, and shows the corpse
to a half-dozen kids. None of them
knows how to react and for two
days, no one reports the crime.
The above incident actually hap
pened, in the town of Milpitas,
north of San Jose, in 1981. News
reports of the grisly occurence
caught the attention of
screenwriter Neal Jimenez, who
decided to write a script which
would explain — or at least try to
explain — just how such a thing
could happen. Perhaps it should
be made clear that the movie isn't

about Milpitas, which isn't even
mentioned in it. so the Mayor
there can stop worrying about
property values being lowered. (Or
whatever it was that made him
pressure the AMC film company
into not previewing the film in
Milpitas last week. Nice of him to
decide what people should and
shouldn't be allowed to see, eh?)

To reiterate: the movie isn't
about Milpitas — to locate it there
in your mind is to miss the point,
because it could take place
anywhere. The anonymous town
of the movie could be in Califor
nia, it could be in the Midwest, it
could be a New England coastal
town. The alienated teenagers
who are its characters aren't in

digenous to any part of the
country: anyone who went to a
public high school will be able to
recognize them.
Like "Less Than Zero," "River's
Edge" is about the dark underside
of cool, the death of affect, that
particularly 20th-century malaise.
So many movies deal with dying,
now there's finally one about

death. One corpse is more dis
turbing than a dozen spectacular
throat-cuttings. The kids don't
know how to respond to death, to
murder, but they can't duck the
issue either.
Director Tim Hunter under
scores the fact by continually cut
ting back to the dead girl's body.
The movie is also about the way

the media engulfs an event and
becomes the event itself — we're
treated to students primping
morally for the news cameras once
reporters descend on their high
school.
More importantly, the film
doesn't allow for any easy moraliz
ing on the viewer's part. It beats
you to the predictable responses
and is there waiting with a smirk
when you finally catch up. For ex
ample, in a classroom discussion
about how no one reported the
murder, one buttoned-up smartie
remarks with an air of authority,
"There seems to have been a fun
damental breakdown in society."
The teacher blows up at him be
cause it's such a hackneyed, in
adequate response.
For these characters, television
is the only reference point. The
only thing filling in the empty
spaces in their lives is an Iron
Maiden soundtrack. The fault is
far from being entirely theirs, of
course. (Watching this movie,
with its deft portrayal of the
"potheads" and their social
milieu, you realize what a joke the
whole concept of "Just Say No" is.
Cheap sloganeering masquerad
ing as social values - who's kid
ding whom here?)
Unfortunately, when the movie
tries to show how little is being
passed down to these teenagers
it's at its weakest. The parents
here are not so much portrayals of
ineffectual parents as they are the
standard cinematic shorthand for
ineffectual parents.
There's also a lot of humor in
this movie, believe it or not. A
strain of dark comedy runs
throughout it, so that you're never
quite sure how to take things. For
instance, what should we make of
Layne (Crispin Glover), the speed
freak and designated leader of

these teens? Although so sped-up
that he constantly seems to be
doubling back from the immedi
ate future, he's the only teen with
an agenda, the only one who tries
to fill the vacuum, albeit with
melodramatic ideas of friendship
and loyalty.
Layne is a key character, but his
outrageous Valley Boy whine
makes him impossible to take
seriously. Glover's weird, nervy
performance is a where-no-man
has-gone-before journey into gro
tesque comedy, a camp safari.

So sped-up that
he constantly
seems to be dou

future.

And then there's Dennis Hop
per. These days each new Hopper
character seems to have been con
ceived with a wax museum exhibit
in mind: See the Asthmatic
Sadist! See the Reformed Alkie!
See the One-Legged Ex-Biker with
the plastic sex doll! Where other
actors fear to tread, there rushes
in Dennis Hopper. Here he plays
Feck, dope dealer to the kids and
'60s casualty, who lugs an in
flatable love doll around with him
wherever he goes.
One of the movie's most inter
esting and audacious moments
comes when Feck meets the mur

derer Samson. Evidently in the
past Feck went too far with believ
ing in causes, with passionate
ideals — he once murdered a girl
because, he says, he loved her too
much. Samson strangled his
girlfriend for the exact opposite
reason: he'd never felt anything,
and murder was the only thing
that made him feel in control, that
made him feel "real." Each charac
ter is disturbed by the other's
confession, and so the '60s and
the '80s, having swapped
philosophies, face each other in
disbelief, speechless with revul

sion.
"River's Edge" is far from per
fect. It wanders off a bit, and
there's one annoying point where
Samson relives the murder in his
mind, cross-cut with shots of a
boy and a girl in the park having
sex for the first time. Presumably,
director Hunter is trying to show
that all three are experiencing a
release, but it's a visual cliche.
Thanatos and Eros have been
linked so often that they're like a
dowdy old married couple.
It's easy to overlook the movie's
problems in the face of its ac

complishments. however. The
young cast members all seem to
have impressive futures ahead of
them, and Dennis Hopper still
reigns as the Wild Man of Ameri
can film. And Hunter and Jimenez
have made a movie about teens
that isn't a parade of merciless
over-achievers — finally. They've
been criticized for showing a prob
lem without suggesting any solu
tions, but what kind of pat solu
tion should they have provided?
Just say no"? Come on. "River's
Edge" may be messy, and it may
be bleak, but so's real life.

actors fear to tread, there rushes
in Dennis Hopper. Here he plays
Feck, dope dealer to the kids and
'60s casualty, who lugs an in

wherever he goes.
One of the movie's most inter
esting and audacious moments
comes when Feck meets the mur

derer Samson. Evidently in the
past Feck went too far with believ

ideals — he once murdered a girl
because, he says, he loved her too

girlfriend for the exact opposite
reason: he'd never felt anything,
and murder was the only thing
that made him feel in control, that

the '80s, having swapped

"River's Edge" is far from per

there's one annoying point where
Samson relives the murder in his

Director Tim Hunter plans a scene with actors Joshua Miller and Keanu Reeves (1-r) in "River's Edge."
Hunter feels that the complex problems of teenagers are too often swept under the rug, and his film at
tempts to redress the balance.
There's a new entry in the
controversy-on-a-low-budget gen
re of filmmaking. Just when the
ink spills over "Blue Velvet" and
"Platoon" have trickled to a halt,
another starkly uncompromising
movie — which somebody, some
where, was willing to finance —
busts loose.
"River's Edge" has already
outraged quite a few people, and
promises to have a distinguished
career in igniting controversy.
The film doesn't just rub some
people the wrong way; more
precisely, it body-checks them
into the wall. You like tasteful,
pretty movies? Then run — do not
walk — to the nearest exit.
"River's Edge" can't be bothered
with questions of artiness, nor
with mild-mannered reactions.
You end up either championing it
or loathing it.
It could have clawed its way out
of John Hughes' darkest
nightmares, this "River's Edge."
The plot: Samson (Daniel
Roebuck), a hulking teenage boy,
sits on a riverbank, unperturbed
by the naked corpse beside him.
The body is that of his girlfriend,
whom he has just strangled to
death. Later Samson tells his
"stoner" friends at school about
the murder, and shows the corpse
to a half-dozen kids. None of them
knows how to react and for two
days, no one reports the crime.
The above incident actually hap
pened, in the town of Milpitas,
north of San Jose, in 1981. News
reports of the grisly occurence
caught the attention of
screenwriter Neal Jimenez, who
decided to write a script which
would explain — or at least try to
explain — just how such a thing
could happen. Perhaps it should
be made clear that the movie isn't

about Milpitas, which isn't even
mentioned in it. so the Mayor
there can stop worrying about
property values being lowered. (Or
whatever it was that made him
pressure the AMC film company
into not previewing the film in
Milpitas last week. Nice of him to
decide what people should and
shouldn't be allowed to see, eh?)

To reiterate: the movie isn't
about Milpitas — to locate it there
in your mind is to miss the point,
because it could take place
anywhere. The anonymous town
of the movie could be in Califor
nia, it could be in the Midwest, it
could be a New England coastal
town. The alienated teenagers
who are its characters aren't in

digenous to any part of the
country: anyone who went to a
public high school will be able to
recognize them.
Like "Less Than Zero," "River's
Edge" is about the dark underside
of cool, the death of affect, that
particularly 20th-century malaise.
So many movies deal with dying,
now there's finally one about

death. One corpse is more dis
turbing than a dozen spectacular
throat-cuttings. The kids don't
know how to respond to death, to
murder, but they can't duck the
issue either.
Director Tim Hunter under
scores the fact by continually cut
ting back to the dead girl's body.
The movie is also about the way

the media engulfs an event and
becomes the event itself — we're
treated to students primping
morally for the news cameras once
reporters descend on their high
school.
More importantly, the film
doesn't allow for any easy moraliz
ing on the viewer's part. It beats
you to the predictable responses
and is there waiting with a smirk
when you finally catch up. For ex
ample, in a classroom discussion
about how no one reported the
murder, one buttoned-up smartie
remarks with an air of authority,
"There seems to have been a fun
damental breakdown in society."
The teacher blows up at him be
cause it's such a hackneyed, in
adequate response.
For these characters, television
is the only reference point. The
only thing filling in the empty
spaces in their lives is an Iron
Maiden soundtrack. The fault is
far from being entirely theirs, of
course. (Watching this movie,
with its deft portrayal of the
"potheads" and their social
milieu, you realize what a joke the
whole concept of "Just Say No" is.
Cheap sloganeering masquerad
ing as social values - who's kid
ding whom here?)
Unfortunately, when the movie
tries to show how little is being
passed down to these teenagers
it's at its weakest. The parents
here are not so much portrayals of
ineffectual parents as they are the
standard cinematic shorthand for
ineffectual parents.
There's also a lot of humor in
this movie, believe it or not. A
strain of dark comedy runs
throughout it, so that you're never
quite sure how to take things. For
instance, what should we make of
Layne (Crispin Glover), the speed
freak and designated leader of

that he constantly seems to be

Layne is a key character, but his
