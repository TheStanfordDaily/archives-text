## Living and dying on the 'River's Edge' 
### MARK TOMPKINS Editorial staff 
There's a new entry in the
controversy-on-a-low-budget gen
re of filmmaking. Just when the
ink spills over "Blue Velvet" and
"Platoon" have trickled to a halt,
another starkly uncompromising
movie — which somebody, some
where, was willing to finance —
busts loose.
"River's Edge" has already
outraged quite a few people, and
promises to have a distinguished
career in igniting controversy.
The film doesn't just rub some
people the wrong way; more
precisely, it body-checks them
into the wall. You like tasteful,
pretty movies? Then run — do not
walk — to the nearest exit.
"River's Edge" can't be bothered
with questions of artiness, nor
with mild-mannered reactions.
You end up either championing it
or loathing it.
It could have clawed its way out
of John Hughes' darkest
nightmares, this "River's Edge."
The plot: Samson (Daniel
Roebuck), a hulking teenage boy,
sits on a riverbank, unperturbed
by the naked corpse beside him.
The body is that of his girlfriend,
whom he has just strangled to
death. Later Samson tells his
"stoner" friends at school about
the murder, and shows the corpse
to a half-dozen kids. None of them
knows how to react and for two
days, no one reports the crime.
The above incident actually hap
pened, in the town of Milpitas,
north of San Jose, in 1981. News
reports of the grisly occurence
caught the attention of
screenwriter Neal Jimenez, who
decided to write a script which
would explain — or at least try to
explain — just how such a thing
could happen. Perhaps it should
be made clear that the movie isn't

about Milpitas, which isn't even
mentioned in it. so the Mayor
there can stop worrying about
property values being lowered. (Or
whatever it was that made him
pressure the AMC film company
into not previewing the film in
Milpitas last week. Nice of him to
decide what people should and
shouldn't be allowed to see, eh?)

To reiterate: the movie isn't
about Milpitas — to locate it there
in your mind is to miss the point,
because it could take place
anywhere. The anonymous town
of the movie could be in Califor
nia, it could be in the Midwest, it
could be a New England coastal
town. The alienated teenagers
who are its characters aren't in

digenous to any part of the
country: anyone who went to a
public high school will be able to
recognize them.
Like "Less Than Zero," "River's
Edge" is about the dark underside
of cool, the death of affect, that
particularly 20th-century malaise.
So many movies deal with dying,
now there's finally one about

death. One corpse is more dis
turbing than a dozen spectacular
throat-cuttings. The kids don't
know how to respond to death, to
murder, but they can't duck the
issue either.
Director Tim Hunter under
scores the fact by continually cut
ting back to the dead girl's body.
The movie is also about the way

the media engulfs an event and
becomes the event itself — we're
treated to students primping
morally for the news cameras once
reporters descend on their high
school.
More importantly, the film
doesn't allow for any easy moraliz
ing on the viewer's part. It beats
you to the predictable responses
and is there waiting with a smirk
when you finally catch up. For ex
ample, in a classroom discussion
about how no one reported the
murder, one buttoned-up smartie
remarks with an air of authority,
"There seems to have been a fun
damental breakdown in society."
The teacher blows up at him be
cause it's such a hackneyed, in
adequate response.
For these characters, television
is the only reference point. The
only thing filling in the empty
spaces in their lives is an Iron
Maiden soundtrack. The fault is
far from being entirely theirs, of
course. (Watching this movie,
with its deft portrayal of the
"potheads" and their social
milieu, you realize what a joke the
whole concept of "Just Say No" is.
Cheap sloganeering masquerad
ing as social values - who's kid
ding whom here?)
Unfortunately, when the movie
tries to show how little is being
passed down to these teenagers
it's at its weakest. The parents
here are not so much portrayals of
ineffectual parents as they are the
standard cinematic shorthand for
ineffectual parents.
There's also a lot of humor in
this movie, believe it or not. A
strain of dark comedy runs
throughout it, so that you're never
quite sure how to take things. For
instance, what should we make of
