# Synergy residents stunned by decision
## 
### A.J. THOMAS Senior staff writer 
Synergy residents said yesterday they were
"caught completely off guard" by the decision
to change their house from a co-op to a self-op
next year.
Because Synergy failed to fill 14 of its 44
residence spaces in Round Two of the Draw, it
will lose its status as a co-op.
"I thought we were off probation," said
junior David Almond. "We would've done a lot
more outreach had we known that was the
policy. The University made no communica
tion to us," Almond added.
Laura Bonk, a two-year resident of Synergy
who will be the Resident Assistant there next
year, said Synergy and Terra, another co-op,
were put on a sort of "probation" last year be
cause they had trouble filling their houses.

University policy states that houses that
"have demonstrated difficulty filling in the
Draw in recent years must fill at least 90 per
cent of their undergraduate assigned spaces
by the end of Round Two of the Draw or their
program will be changed." according to Rodger
Whitney, Assistant Dean of Student Affairs
and Director of Student Housing.
"It was the understanding of the house that
the probation was over." said Synergy resident
Jon Traugott. "If the University applied the
same standards after it ended, what was the
meaning of the probation?" Traugott asked.
Bonk said this year's outreach activities con
sisted of two brunches for interested fresh
men. In years past, Synergy representatives
have visited individual dorm meetings to en
courage people to live in the co-op. Bonk
added.
Bonk said the decision to change Synergy's

status hits graduate students especially hard
since they they have so few opportunities to
live on campus and cannot live in self-ops.
"Except for Manzanita Park and Mirrielees,
co-ops are the only places where grad students
live with undergraduates in a working,
cooperative environment," she said.
Because a certain number of Synergy's spots
are now allotted to graduate students, it is "not
clear that it will be easier to fill as a self-op,"
Traugott said.
Synergy residents arc trying to get the Uni
versity to make an exception, allowing
graduate students to live in Synergy after it
becomes a self-op, Traugott added.
Bonk said the change to a self-op will double
the board bill for Synergy. This increase,
which would come to about $1000, could pose
a hardship for students on tight budgets next
year. Bonk added.
