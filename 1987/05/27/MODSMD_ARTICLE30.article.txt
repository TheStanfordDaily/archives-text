# 'Edge' director Tim Hunter on the dark side of teenage life
## 
### MARK TOMPKINS Editorial staff 
Tim Hunter Is a such a soft-spoken
man it seems unusual that he's made a
film as powerful as "River's Edge." In con
versation. though, any seeming disparity
between the man and his work dissolved;
it quickly became clear that he had
thought about the problems of teenagers
a great deal and was critical about many
of the current responses to kids' prob
lems. It's no wonder that Hunter has
thought about such things a great deal -
after all. he researched and wrote "Over
the Edge" (1979) and directed the film
version of S.E. Hinton's "Tex" (1982).
"River's Edge," which Hunter directed,
uses as its starting point the 1981 Mil
pitas incident wherein a 16-year-old boy
murdered his girlfriend and then showed
the body to his friends, none of whom told
the police for 48 hours. Both Hunter and
co-producer Midge Sanford feel that
"River's Edge" in no way rips off or ex
ploits the Mllpitas incident, but rather
that it examines the issues raised by the
incident in an honest, realistic way.
Hunter and Sanford also feel that
"River's Edge" is among the several films
of the past year that show people that they

have to keep their eyes open to life. And
considering the success of films like "Blue
Velvet" and "Platoon," banal escapism
may be, at least partly, on the wane in
Hollywood films.
Daily: Do you think "River's Edge" has
any kind of politics? Is there a particular
political slant that you would ascribe to
it?
Hunter: It sort of depends on how you
defend politics. When we made the movie,
Hollywood was in an unusually bland per
iod. And because it was suffering even
more than it is at this time from a blanket
of conservative repression — the whole
"Just Say No" campaign — and a lot of
book-burning and stuff was going on, you
just got the feeling that the message we
were getting from the government and the
whole conservative movement was to
erase it or sweep it under the rug.
And we felt that the "River's Edge"
script, which is a very complex piece of
material, dealt with complex paradoxes
and issues of morality without ever being
moralistic or tying things up into some
sort of neat TV-movie equation — the
good are good, the bad are bad, and we
can all be excited by some scandalous
event but feel very comfortable in our own
homes. So I certainly felt that the movie

would fly in the face of all that conserva
tive repression. And I thought it would be
a healthy thing to make this tough little
kick-ass melodrama.
And several pictures came out in the fall
- "Sid and Nancy," "Blue Velvet" and some
others — where you felt that other
filmmakers felt the same thing. I think
the message is that you have to keep your
eyes open to life, society's become so
much more complex and the contradic
tions abound in a way that they never did
before, and you can't just pretend that
they don't exist. You have to see complex
problems as complex problems.
Daily: So would it be fair to say that some
thing like the "Just Say No" campaign is
an inadequate response to teenage
problems?
Hunter: I think so. It's not a problem that
I know how to solve, but 1 know you can't
solve it by saying that certain things are
bad and people shouldn't do them. My
limited experience researching this stuff
indicates that kids run into trouble when
they don't spend any time with their par
ents, when they don't get any values from
their parents, there's nothing for them to
do in the community, there's no sense of
history for them.
Daily: I was struck by the similarity of

"River's Edge" to "Over the Edge," which
is also about destructive kids in a suburb
who end up running amok.
Hunter: Obviously it struck me too — I
wrote "Over the Edge" — I did no research
for this one, because we had talked to so
many kids in Foster City, which is where
the events of "Over the Edge" took place.
(The events in Foster City) showed that
if you give kids something to do and show
that people are interested in them, and
show them some stuff that might
motivate them, then maybe they won't
throw shopping carts off the roofs of
apartment houses and get stoned all the
time.
When I read the script for "River's
Edge," I recognized in it a segment of kids
in every town in the country. The script
just seemed so on the money.
Daily: Do you see "Tex" fitting in with the
other two films in any way?
Hunter: In terms of my career, I see it fit
ting in because when we interviewed all
those kids for "Over the Edge," we discov
ered that if they were reading at all. they
were reading S.E. Hinton (author of
"Rumble Fish" and"The Outsiders"). We
thought we ought to check up on this, it
sounded good. We read all her books

—"Tex" had not come out yet. We got the
galleys for "Tex," which was coming out
in a few months, and Matt (Dillon, star of
"Over the Edge") agreed to do it, so we
pre-packaged it and took it to Disney. It
took quite a while to set up, but it was
well-received.
Thematically, I think "Tex" fits in with
the issue of people having to make hard
choices, how people grow and change by
virtue of the choices that they have to
make. The choices in "Tex" were more
clear-cut, and the issues in "Over the
Edge" were also more clear-cut. The rebel
lion in "Over the Edge" was a kind of
healthy rebellion, although it was violent
in terms of locking the parents into the
school and then trashing the place. None
theless, it was healthy in the sense that it
was one social movement reacting to an
other part of society.
But "River's Edge" is much tougher
than that. Everyone's on their own,
they're cut off, they're in a void, they're
disenfranchised from any sort of social
protest. "River's Edge" really made me
think about what was important to me
when I was in high school. It made me re-
member how intensely I was
dealing with questions of the im
portance of friendship and loyalty,
how I was always going to be true
to my friends no matter what, the
importance of keeping a romance
in your life. I've tried to stay true
to that stuff.
The murder in "River's Edge" is
such an extreme. It cuts through
so much bullshit to the heart of all
these big questions that I think
kids deal with very intensely at
that age. I've never thought any of
my films about teenagers would
have much appeal to teenagers,
but this film I hope they find inter
esting. because the issues are very
strong.
Daily: What was the thinking be
hind Neal Jimenez's adding sub
plots and characters that weren't
involved in the original incident?
Was it felt that more was needed?
Hunter: I really think that this
was an honest case of dramatic in
spiration. This is an honest case

of "Inspired by" rather than
"based on." Neal read the same
newspaper accounts of the Mil
pitas murder that everyone else
did. and that was really all the re
search that he did. He then took
the bare bones of that stuff that he
read and filtered it through his
own experience growing up in a
comparable Sacramento suburb.
Daily: What was it like to work
with Dennis Hopper? He's had
such a comeback in the last year.
Hunter: Hopper was great. I don't
know what to say. it sounds like a
press release, but in fact he was
very gracious on the set. He made
it very clear that he loved the
script and the part, and was a big
supporter of the project. He kept
telling us how great it was going to
be, which is a very nice thing to
have on the set. And the kids
idolized him, or were fascinated
by him at least, because of the his
tory that's associated with him. I
found him very well-prepared and
very helpful. We had an odd but
easy meeting of the minds on the
part. Dennis was at pains to bring
some emotional depth to the char
acter, above all. It was a very good
experience.

disenfranchised from any sort of social
protest. "River's Edge" really made me
think about what was important to me
when I was in high school. It made me re-
member how intensely I was
dealing with questions of the im
portance of friendship and loyalty,
how I was always going to be true
to my friends no matter what, the
importance of keeping a romance
in your life. I've tried to stay true
to that stuff.
The murder in "River's Edge" is
such an extreme. It cuts through
so much bullshit to the heart of all
these big questions that I think
kids deal with very intensely at
that age. I've never thought any of
my films about teenagers would
have much appeal to teenagers,
but this film I hope they find inter
esting. because the issues are very
strong.
Daily: What was the thinking be
hind Neal Jimenez's adding sub
plots and characters that weren't
involved in the original incident?
Was it felt that more was needed?
Hunter: I really think that this
was an honest case of dramatic in
spiration. This is an honest case

of "Inspired by" rather than
"based on." Neal read the same
newspaper accounts of the Mil
pitas murder that everyone else
did. and that was really all the re
search that he did. He then took
the bare bones of that stuff that he
read and filtered it through his
own experience growing up in a
comparable Sacramento suburb.
Daily: What was it like to work
with Dennis Hopper? He's had
such a comeback in the last year.
Hunter: Hopper was great. I don't
know what to say. it sounds like a
press release, but in fact he was
very gracious on the set. He made
it very clear that he loved the
script and the part, and was a big
supporter of the project. He kept
telling us how great it was going to
be, which is a very nice thing to
have on the set. And the kids
idolized him, or were fascinated
by him at least, because of the his
tory that's associated with him. I
found him very well-prepared and
very helpful. We had an odd but
easy meeting of the minds on the
part. Dennis was at pains to bring
some emotional depth to the char
acter, above all. It was a very good
experience.
Tim Hunter Is a such a soft-spoken
man it seems unusual that he's made a
film as powerful as "River's Edge." In con
versation. though, any seeming disparity
between the man and his work dissolved;
it quickly became clear that he had
thought about the problems of teenagers
a great deal and was critical about many
of the current responses to kids' prob
lems. It's no wonder that Hunter has
thought about such things a great deal -
after all. he researched and wrote "Over
the Edge" (1979) and directed the film
version of S.E. Hinton's "Tex" (1982).
"River's Edge," which Hunter directed,
uses as its starting point the 1981 Mil
pitas incident wherein a 16-year-old boy
murdered his girlfriend and then showed
the body to his friends, none of whom told
the police for 48 hours. Both Hunter and
co-producer Midge Sanford feel that
"River's Edge" in no way rips off or ex
ploits the Mllpitas incident, but rather
that it examines the issues raised by the
incident in an honest, realistic way.
Hunter and Sanford also feel that
"River's Edge" is among the several films
of the past year that show people that they

have to keep their eyes open to life. And
considering the success of films like "Blue
Velvet" and "Platoon," banal escapism
may be, at least partly, on the wane in
Hollywood films.
Daily: Do you think "River's Edge" has
any kind of politics? Is there a particular
political slant that you would ascribe to
it?
Hunter: It sort of depends on how you
defend politics. When we made the movie,
Hollywood was in an unusually bland per
iod. And because it was suffering even
more than it is at this time from a blanket
of conservative repression — the whole
"Just Say No" campaign — and a lot of
book-burning and stuff was going on, you
just got the feeling that the message we
were getting from the government and the
whole conservative movement was to
erase it or sweep it under the rug.
And we felt that the "River's Edge"
script, which is a very complex piece of
material, dealt with complex paradoxes
and issues of morality without ever being
moralistic or tying things up into some
sort of neat TV-movie equation — the
good are good, the bad are bad, and we
can all be excited by some scandalous
event but feel very comfortable in our own
homes. So I certainly felt that the movie

would fly in the face of all that conserva
tive repression. And I thought it would be
a healthy thing to make this tough little
kick-ass melodrama.
And several pictures came out in the fall
- "Sid and Nancy," "Blue Velvet" and some
others — where you felt that other
filmmakers felt the same thing. I think
the message is that you have to keep your
eyes open to life, society's become so
much more complex and the contradic
tions abound in a way that they never did
before, and you can't just pretend that
they don't exist. You have to see complex
problems as complex problems.
Daily: So would it be fair to say that some
thing like the "Just Say No" campaign is
an inadequate response to teenage
problems?
Hunter: I think so. It's not a problem that
I know how to solve, but 1 know you can't
solve it by saying that certain things are
bad and people shouldn't do them. My
limited experience researching this stuff
indicates that kids run into trouble when
they don't spend any time with their par
ents, when they don't get any values from
their parents, there's nothing for them to
do in the community, there's no sense of
history for them.
Daily: I was struck by the similarity of

"River's Edge" to "Over the Edge," which
is also about destructive kids in a suburb
who end up running amok.
Hunter: Obviously it struck me too — I
wrote "Over the Edge" — I did no research
for this one, because we had talked to so
many kids in Foster City, which is where
the events of "Over the Edge" took place.
(The events in Foster City) showed that
if you give kids something to do and show
that people are interested in them, and
show them some stuff that might
motivate them, then maybe they won't
throw shopping carts off the roofs of
apartment houses and get stoned all the
time.
When I read the script for "River's
Edge," I recognized in it a segment of kids
in every town in the country. The script
just seemed so on the money.
Daily: Do you see "Tex" fitting in with the
other two films in any way?
Hunter: In terms of my career, I see it fit
ting in because when we interviewed all
those kids for "Over the Edge," we discov
ered that if they were reading at all. they
were reading S.E. Hinton (author of
"Rumble Fish" and"The Outsiders"). We
thought we ought to check up on this, it
sounded good. We read all her books

—"Tex" had not come out yet. We got the
galleys for "Tex," which was coming out
in a few months, and Matt (Dillon, star of
"Over the Edge") agreed to do it, so we
pre-packaged it and took it to Disney. It
took quite a while to set up, but it was
well-received.
Thematically, I think "Tex" fits in with
the issue of people having to make hard
choices, how people grow and change by
virtue of the choices that they have to
make. The choices in "Tex" were more
clear-cut, and the issues in "Over the
Edge" were also more clear-cut. The rebel
lion in "Over the Edge" was a kind of
healthy rebellion, although it was violent
in terms of locking the parents into the
school and then trashing the place. None
theless, it was healthy in the sense that it
was one social movement reacting to an
other part of society.
But "River's Edge" is much tougher
than that. Everyone's on their own,
they're cut off, they're in a void, they're
disenfranchised from any sort of social
protest. "River's Edge" really made me
think about what was important to me
when I was in high school. It made me re-

portance of friendship and loyalty,
