## Women's golf ready for 1st round of NCAA play 
### EVAN TUCHINSKY Staff writer 
"Oh, Stanford has a golf team?"
Yes. Virginia, Stanford has a golf
team, actually two. In fact, the Cardinal
women's squad is in Albuquerque. N.M.,
this week to compete in the 1987 NCAA
Championships. The first round begins
today, with the remaining three rounds
to be played Thursday through Satur
day.
Stanford, coming off a third place
finish in the Pacific 10 Conference
Championships one month ago, enters
the tournament seeded 1 Ith and with a
reasonable chance of winning the NCAA
title.
"We're not going into this tournament
saying, 'Oh, it would be nice to finish in
the top five, it would be nice to finish in
the top 10,' " Stanford Coach Tim
Baldwin said. "No, we're going to Albu
querque with the absolute desire to win
that championship.
"We have at one time throughout this
year beaten every team in the top 17,"
the coach added. It is these 17 teams
that will comprise the field for this year's
NCAAs.
The top seed in the tournament is
Arizona State, which finished first in
the Pac-10s. Oklahoma State is second,
followed by San Jose State, Furman and
Florida. The host team. New Mexico,
holds the sixth spot, with Southern Cal
ifornia, Miami-Florida, Indiana and
Texas rounding out the tournament's
top 10 seeds.
Seeded behind Stanford are Arizona
— which finished one stroke behind the
Cardinal at Pac-10s — United States In

ternational. South Carolina. Duke,
UCLA and Alabama.
"It's really a good field." junior Kay
Cornelius said. "It's obviously the best
teams who are appearing in the NCAAs.
We're in really good company.
"When you go to NCAAs, I think you
have to be realistic. We haven't won a
tournament all year, but 1 think we have
the potential to win it." she added.
If the team continues to play as well as
it did at the Pac- 10s, the path to the title
will be relatively smooth. "Our team
right now is playing the best golf it has
all year, and this is really going to help
us." Baldwin said.
"Kathleen McCarthy and Kay Cor
nelius played very well at Pac-10s," the
coach added. McCarthy finished fifth,
and Cornelius, who was even par for the
first three rounds, placed ninth.
"Kathleen now is playing the best golf
of her life." the coach observed. "I really
look for Kathleen to challenge for the in
dividual championship. We know that
Kay Cornelius will play really steady."
The remainder of the team is also
playing well. "Clare Dolan's game im
proves daily," Baldwin noted. "She's
playing better than in Pac- 10s. Adrienne
Gilmartin's also playing better than in
Pac-10s, as is Trish McGonigle, who
played at Pac-10s with a severely bruised
ankle.
"So, if we can get a similar perfor
mance out of Kathleen and Kay. which
I'm confident of, and with Clare playing
better, Adrienne and Trish healthy, we
will play better.
"Another thing that tells me we're
going to fare well at NCAAs is that the
team really wants to fare well," he added.

"They've all been working very hard."
"1 think its something we've all
prepared for a lot." Cornelius agreed.
"We've had a really good practice
schedule the last few weeks and every
one's put a lot of effort into their game."
The course provides Stanford with an
other advantage. "The course is really
good," the junior said. "I don't know
how they'll set it up, but we played there
in the fall and finished third in a really
good field.
"I think we know the course relatively
well, although Clare hasn't played it
before because she was injured in the
fall, so we're all going into there knowing
what the course is like," she added. "It
just depends how they set it up. It might
be longer, or they might grow the rough
deeper which makes the greens faster."
The Cardinal coach concurred. "It's
one of the top three or four university
courses in the country, along with ours
and Ohio State's. It's very difficult, it's
long, it's well bunkered with tricky
greens. It's a championship course, just
like ours.
"We like the golf course because we're
used to playing a championship course,
and we like Albuquerque," he added. "I
look for us to do well."
Stanford's last visit to the course, the
squad's season premiere, yielded a third
place finish in the New Mexico Intercol
legiate Tournament, which New Mexico
won and ASU placed second in."In that
particular tournament, we beat San
Jose State, we beat Florida, we beat
Oklahoma State and we beat Furman,
Tulsa. Arizona, Southern Methodist and
Texas," Baldwin said. "We have at one
time or another beat everyone else."

"Oh, Stanford has a golf team?"
Yes. Virginia, Stanford has a golf
team, actually two. In fact, the Cardinal
women's squad is in Albuquerque. N.M.,
this week to compete in the 1987 NCAA
Championships. The first round begins
today, with the remaining three rounds
to be played Thursday through Satur
day.
Stanford, coming off a third place
finish in the Pacific 10 Conference
Championships one month ago, enters
the tournament seeded 1 Ith and with a
reasonable chance of winning the NCAA
title.
"We're not going into this tournament
saying, 'Oh, it would be nice to finish in
the top five, it would be nice to finish in
the top 10,' " Stanford Coach Tim
Baldwin said. "No, we're going to Albu
querque with the absolute desire to win
that championship.
"We have at one time throughout this
year beaten every team in the top 17,"
the coach added. It is these 17 teams
that will comprise the field for this year's
NCAAs.
The top seed in the tournament is
Arizona State, which finished first in
the Pac-10s. Oklahoma State is second,
followed by San Jose State, Furman and
Florida. The host team. New Mexico,
holds the sixth spot, with Southern Cal
ifornia, Miami-Florida, Indiana and
Texas rounding out the tournament's
top 10 seeds.
Seeded behind Stanford are Arizona
— which finished one stroke behind the
Cardinal at Pac-10s — United States In

ternational. South Carolina. Duke,
UCLA and Alabama.
"It's really a good field." junior Kay
Cornelius said. "It's obviously the best
teams who are appearing in the NCAAs.
We're in really good company.
"When you go to NCAAs, I think you
have to be realistic. We haven't won a
tournament all year, but 1 think we have
the potential to win it." she added.
If the team continues to play as well as
it did at the Pac- 10s, the path to the title
will be relatively smooth. "Our team
right now is playing the best golf it has
all year, and this is really going to help
us." Baldwin said.
"Kathleen McCarthy and Kay Cor
nelius played very well at Pac-10s," the
coach added. McCarthy finished fifth,
and Cornelius, who was even par for the
first three rounds, placed ninth.
"Kathleen now is playing the best golf
of her life." the coach observed. "I really
look for Kathleen to challenge for the in
dividual championship. We know that
Kay Cornelius will play really steady."
The remainder of the team is also
playing well. "Clare Dolan's game im
proves daily," Baldwin noted. "She's
playing better than in Pac- 10s. Adrienne
Gilmartin's also playing better than in
Pac-10s, as is Trish McGonigle, who
played at Pac-10s with a severely bruised
ankle.
"So, if we can get a similar perfor
mance out of Kathleen and Kay. which
I'm confident of, and with Clare playing
better, Adrienne and Trish healthy, we
will play better.
"Another thing that tells me we're
going to fare well at NCAAs is that the
team really wants to fare well," he added.

"They've all been working very hard."
"1 think its something we've all
prepared for a lot." Cornelius agreed.
"We've had a really good practice
schedule the last few weeks and every
one's put a lot of effort into their game."
The course provides Stanford with an
other advantage. "The course is really
good," the junior said. "I don't know
how they'll set it up, but we played there
in the fall and finished third in a really
good field.
"I think we know the course relatively
well, although Clare hasn't played it
before because she was injured in the
fall, so we're all going into there knowing
what the course is like," she added. "It
just depends how they set it up. It might
be longer, or they might grow the rough
deeper which makes the greens faster."
The Cardinal coach concurred. "It's
one of the top three or four university
courses in the country, along with ours
and Ohio State's. It's very difficult, it's
long, it's well bunkered with tricky
greens. It's a championship course, just
like ours.
"We like the golf course because we're
used to playing a championship course,
and we like Albuquerque," he added. "I
look for us to do well."
Stanford's last visit to the course, the
squad's season premiere, yielded a third
place finish in the New Mexico Intercol
legiate Tournament, which New Mexico
won and ASU placed second in."In that
particular tournament, we beat San
Jose State, we beat Florida, we beat
Oklahoma State and we beat Furman,
Tulsa. Arizona, Southern Methodist and
Texas," Baldwin said. "We have at one
time or another beat everyone else."
