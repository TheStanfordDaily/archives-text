# Coach, players headed for Zagreb
## 
### CHRIS CRADER Editorial staff 
Yugoslavia is not the preferred summer
vacation site of many people, especially
those from sunny southern California, but
for a few members of the Stanford volleyball
program, the trip should be a great experi
ence. Stanford men's Head Coach Fred
Sturm was selected as head coach of the
U.S. men's team that will be competing this
summer at the World University Games in
Zagreb, Yugoslavia.
Junior Scott Fortune and ex-Cardinal
Jon Root made the squad and another
former Stanford player. Chris Braun, is an
alternate.
It is likely the Cardinal women will also be
represented, as juniors Teresa Smith and
Nancy Reno are among the fifteen people
who will train in Colorado Springs prior to
the event. The roster will then be cut to
twelve who will travel to Yugoslavia and play
for the U.S. women's squad.
Sturm will have no talent problem as his
roster reads like a Who's Who in men's vol
leyball. At setter he has UCLA's Matt Son
nichsen and Pepperdine's Doug Rigg, both
of whom started for NCAA championship
teams. In the middle will be Fortune. Penn
State's Chris Chase, former UCLA player
Jeff Campbell, and national team member
Jeff Wells; while Root, USC's Adam
Johnson, UCLA's Jeff Williams, UCLA's
Arne Lamberg. Pepperdine's Rob Scott, and
Troy Tanner will all play on the outside.
Sturm will also have two of the top head
coaches in the country to assist him in Carl
McGowan of BYU and Jim Coleman of Major
League Volleyball's Minnesota Monarchs.
Both have also served as head coaches of
the men's Olympic team. Coleman in 1968
and McGowan in 1976.
The group of players women's coach Mike
Hebert of Illinois has to choose from is also

loaded. Leading the way are 1986 All-
Americans Smith, Mary Eggers from Illi
nois, and Suzanne Eagye and Tita Ahuna
from Hawaii. Other participants include Liz
Hert and Brooke Herrington, who have both
won two NCAA titles at University of the
Pacific, and Christa Cook, from San Jose
State by way of the San Jose Golddiggers
professional team.
"Hopefully I'll be going to Yugoslavia,"
Smith said. "Playing internationally is dif
ferent: it's quicker. I can definitely learn a
lot from that."
Smith earned her shot at the team by hit
ting .439 in the Pacific-10 this year to lead
the conference and win league Player-of
the-Year honors. Reno led the team with 81
blocks in conference play and was a second
team AU-Pac-10 selection.
Fortune led the Cardinal men in blocks
and aces this year and was a first-team All-
Western Intercollegiate Volleyball Associa
tion pick; Root is one of the best ever to play
at Stanford and has played for the national
team at both swing hitter and middle
blocker in the last year; and Braun is an
amazing hitter who shattered the school
record with 49 kills in one match against
UCLA a year ago.
"It's an honor to have the opportunity,"
Sturm said. "The staff has a lot of experi
ence . . . (and) a lot of these guys are pro
spective national team guys."
The United States will compete against
both college all-star teams and national
teams from around the world in what
Sturm called "the equivalent of a college
Olympics." The rules require only that
players be under 27 and have graduated no
later than 1986. Some countries can thus
enter their national teams as their players
are all young enough.
Both U.S. teams will train in Colorado
Springs from June 16 to July 3, and the
Games run Julv 7 to Julv 17.

Colorado Springs will host juniors Teresa Smith
(18) and Nancy Reno, along with thirteen others
striving to make the U.S. World University Games
women's volleyball team. The players will go
through a two-week training session, with the top
twelve travelling to Yugoslavia for the biennial
competition. Stanford men's coach Fred Sturm,
junior Scott Fortune and graduate Jon Root have
already been selected for the men's team.
