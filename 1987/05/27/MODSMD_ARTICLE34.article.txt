# Celtics beat Detroit, need one more win
## 
### 
BOSTON (AP) â€” Larry Bird
stole an inbounds pass and fed
Dennis Johnson for the win
ning layup with one second left,
giving the Boston Celtics a 108-
107 victory over the Detroit Pis
tons Tuesday night and a 3-2
lead in their NBA Eastern Con
ference final.
Isiah Thomas had put
Detroit ahead 107-106 with a
jumper from the foul line with
17 seconds remaining. Bird
then missed a shot with seven
seconds to go and the ball went
out of bounds off Boston's
Jerry Siehting.
Thomas attempted to throw
the ball in from the sideline to
Bill Laimbeer under the Boston
basket, but Bird raced in to
steal it and passed the ball to
Johnson, who was flashing to
the basket.
Boston, trying to reach the
final round for the fourth
straight year, can do so by win
ning Game 6 Thursday night in
Pontiac, Mich. The winner of
the series will face the Los An
geles Lakers, who swept Seattle
to win the Western Conference.
Boston was led by Bird with
36 points, Kevin McHale with
20 and Johnson with 18.
Detroit was led by Adrian
Dantley with 25 points. Vinnie
Johnson with 20 and Thomas
with 17.

Boston center Robert Parish
left the game when he ag
gravated a sprained left ankle
with 3:41 to go. But Darren
Daye hit a three-point play and
made two free throws that gave
Boston a 100-99 lead with 2:39
to go and began an 11-4 surge.
Danny Ainge ended the run
with a jumper from the top of
the key for a 106-103 lead with
53 seconds left.
Then Laimbeer connected
from just beyond the foul line
with 46 seconds left before Bird
missed a short shot with 28
seconds remaining. Detroit
called a timeout to set up the
play on which Thomas gave the
Pistons their last load.
With 23 seconds left in the
first half, Parish punched
Laimbeer twice after they
battled for a rebound which
Laimbeer had grabbed under
the Celtics' basket. Laimbeer
appeared to have pushed
Parish in the chest before he
was punched.
Laimbeer fell to the floor but
no foul was called on either
player. The incident came one
day after Laimbeer was fined
$5,000 and Bird $2,000 for a
skirmish in Saturday's third
game. Laimbeer had knocked
Bird to the floor with a hard
foul and Bird punched him and
threw the ball at him.
