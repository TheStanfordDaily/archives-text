### JOANNE GOMEZ 
The Roman Catholic Church
currently views artificial insemi
nation as violating the dignity of
the conjugal act and the right of
the human being to be brought
into existence through that act,
according to Ralph Mclnerny, Pro
fessor of Philosophy at the Univer
sity of Notre Dame.
Mclnerny, speaking to a crowd
ed room of about seventy people in
the history corner last night, dis
cussed and defended Pope John
Paul IPs recent document
"Instruction on Respect for
Human Life in Its Origin and the
Dignity of Procreation: Replies to

Certain Questions of the Day."
The talk, sponsored by the Stan
ford Students for Life group, dealt
primarily with what Mclnerny
termed "artificial procreation"
and touched briefly on the sub
jects of abortion, adoption,
therapeutic procedures carried
out on an embryo and scientific
research conducted on embryos.
"The Church does not reject
these methods because they are
technical and artificial, but rather
it is a question of when artificial
procedures are morally illicit and
when they are not. With scientific
research one might call it good if it
achieves its end, however, some
means of going about achieving

ends are not good," he stated.
According to Mclnerny. the
"immorality" of surrogate mother
ing and controlled procreation
stems from the fact that the
human being is created in a man
ner which is foreign to the union
and manifestation of conjugal
love.
Mclnerny argues that these
methods of fertilization compro
mise and destroy the union of con
jugal love. He viewed this union as
having an important two-fold
meaning, a spiritual and a cor
poral one. and said it is expressed
through conjugal acts and the
desire to procreate. "Any act or
procedure which compromises or

destroys the union of conjugal love
is immoral," he stated.
When asked whether an infertile
couple might not have the right to
search for other means of concep
tion, Mclnerny replied that the
ability to give life is a supreme gift
from God and that it is something
to which to no one has a "right".
Such couples would thereby be
imposing on the right of the fu
ture human being to be born as a
result of an act of love and a wil
lingness to give on the part of the
parents, he said. Furthermore, he
stated, there is always the possi
bility that one could still receive
this gift.
