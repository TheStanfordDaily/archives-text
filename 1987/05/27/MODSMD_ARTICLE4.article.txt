Saying that "America is not
standing tall, it is standing still."
Democratic presidential hopeful
Bruce Babbitt told a crowd of 200
yesterday in front of Roble Hall
that the country must "take
charge of its destiny."
Babbitt termed 1988 a "turning
point" for America and a "time of
fundamental change."
Calling the Democratic Party
the "keepers of the nation's con
science," Babbitt stressed the
need for strong leadership in im
plementing economic and social
reform and expounded a "radical
diagnosis for our economy and
your future."
In a recent poll. Babbitt, a
former geologist, attorney general
and two-term governor of Arizona,
was supported by less than 5 per
cent of those surveyed.
Babbitt listed children as his
number one priority. "The prob

lems of this nation start at the
core, at the very beginning." he
said. Babbitt called for an increase
in the amount of resources
devoted to day-care programs,
public education and health care
Babbitt chastised the Reagan
Administration on its Middle East
policy. According to Babbitt, the
"administration had no policy" in
the oil-rich Persian Gulf region,
where Iraqi missiles severely
damaged the U.S.S. Stark last
week,
"Not once have we had a clear
statement of our objectives in the
Middle East," he said, adding that
U.S. economic and diplomatic
pressure should be used to end
the war between Iraq and Iran.
Terming Reagan's Strategic
Defense Initiative a "dangerous
and destabilizing process." Bab
bitt vowed he would pare Star
Wars expenditures to include only
very basic research.
Babbitt had his strongest words
of criticism for Reagan's policy in

Central America and the Presi
dent's support of the Nicaraguan
contras. Calling contra aid a
"slow-motion Bay of Pigs." Babbitt
said, "If I am elected president, on
my first day in office I will ter
minate all aid to the contras."
Although trade protection for
domestic industry has been the
rallying cry of several other Demo
cratic candidates. Babbitt said the
Congress "has it all wrong" by
passing protectionist legislation.
The international economic sys
tem is collapsing, said Babbitt,
who added that the current sys
tem based on identifying unfair
trade practices is obsolete for a
world of mixed economies.
"America has got to move to a
broader definition of how to con
struct a balanced and fair sys
tem." He also said that the United
States should foster increased
competition at home.
Babbitt claimed that as an un

politics. He said his life began to
change in 1962, when, working as
a geologist with an American oil
company in Bolivia, he "saw the
face of starvation."
After graduating from Harvard
Law School in the mid-19605.
Babbitt joined the civil rights
movement and learned that "if 1
only opened my eyes and looked
around me, I could see the un
finished agenda everywhere in so
ciety."
Babbitt began his opening
remarks by saying that if he was
elected President, he would not to
construct a presidential library at
Stanford or any other university.
Babbitt said he drove on to
campus looking for the Ronald
Reagan Presidential Library and
conjectured that a Reagan library
would contain no more than
"comic books and video tapes."
