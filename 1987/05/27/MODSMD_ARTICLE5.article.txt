# Forum sheds light on racism
## 
### JOHN POLLACK Senior staff writer 
Pressure to assimilate and
police harassment of minority stu
dents on campus were among the
complaints voiced at an emotion
ally charged, standing room only
forum on racism held in Kresge
Auditorium last night.
The University-sponsored fo
rum, which attracted many ad
ministators and faculty as well as
students, was organized by the
Rainbow Agenda, a coalition of
campus minority groups and
other students.
University President Donald
Kennedy said at the outset of the
forum that its purpose was to edu
cate the Stanford community
about the concerns of campus
minorities.
"The purpose (of the forum) is
education. None of us — especially
those who are white males — can
afford a sense of comfort or un
concern about the issues the or
ganizers of this forum are
raising," Kennedy said.
"We need to hear what those is

sues are, try to understand their
impact on people of color, and
take that understanding to the
task of improving the university
and society," he said.
The forum, which featured a
panel of students representing
campus minority groups and the
campus at large, was moderated
by Faye McNair-Knox, assistant
dean for campus and student af
fairs.
All of the panelists said racism
exists at Stanford, and each of
them cited specific incidents in
support of their claims.
Elsa Tsutaoka, a representative
of the Stanford Asian-American
Student Association, said that she
was recently harassed by another
student — whom she did not
know. He asked her sarcastically
"Hey, what's the matter with you?
Don't you speak English?" after
she refused his request for a ride
from Wilbur Hall to Florence
Moore Hall.
"The whole tone of his voice
carried with it the assumption
that I did not belong at Stanford
University because he felt that I
could not speak English,"
Tsutaoka said.
She added that Asian-American
students at Stanford have had
their lives threatened.
Such incidents "set the tone for
the living situation of people of
color on this campus," she said.
"We are being told every day that
we do not belong here."
Wes Williams, a representative
of the Stanford American Indian
Organization, said there is little
appreciation at Stanford for the
culture of Native Americans. He
said he often hears comments
which characterize Native
Americans as "savages."
"Very few people realize what is
being said," he added.
Bill King, incoming chair of the
Black Student Union, recounted
incidents of racism which were
more overt. He said when he once
asked a chemistry professor a

question about an unlabeled
graph, the professor responded.
"Your people don't always have an
aptitude for this." King did not
name the professor.
In a lengthy question and an
swer period, which was extended
several times, other students told
of additional racist incidents.
Several students said that they
have been stopped by campus
police and asked for identification
just because they are black.
In one instance that was cited, a
black man and a white woman
driving in a car were stopped by
campus police, who then asked
the woman if she was in the car of
her own free will.
Cecilia Bureiaga, associate dean
of graduate studies and Resident
Fellow in Casa Zapata, the
Chicano theme house in Stern
Hall, said she keeps a notebook in
which she records racist incidents
at Stanford.
Bureiaga said she overheard
two non-minority Stanford stu
dents talking about a black stu
dent after a football game last fall.
One said to another, "Hey look, a

Stanford Bro. Ask him what his
SAT scores are!"
Bureiaga also said last year a
group of students stood outside of
Casa Zapata and chanted "Up
with racism! Up with facism!
Down with Zapata!"
While the Rainbow Agenda
enjoyed widespread support at the
forum, two groups within the
Stanford community said they felt
excluded from the coalition. Rep
resentatives of both the Jewish
community and the homosexual
community said that as victims of
oppression, they should be
represented in the Rainbow
Agenda.
King responded that the Rain
bow Agenda did not exclude these
groups, but that the primary
focus of the coalition was to com
bat racism.
McNair-Knox said in her
opening remarks that the forum
could serve as a "prelude to several
other discussions, those that will
address the needs of all commun
ities which might be considered
minority communities."
"This discussion will provide a
good foundation for all discus
sions that will flow from it."
