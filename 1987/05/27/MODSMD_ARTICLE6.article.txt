# Fundraising targets alumni checkbooks
## 
### STEPHEN KASIERSKI Senior staff writer 
This is the second of a Jour-part
series examining Stanford's Cen
tennial Campaign.

When Stanford launches a
fundraising campaign, everyone
listens.
The $1.1 billion Centennial
Campaign is the largest fundrais
ing effort in the histoiy of private
education, and while University
officials and volunteers were for
mally announcing the campaign
last February, many Stanford
alumni were already reaching for
their checkbooks.
Although the campaign will
touch a broad spectrum of
alumni, foundations and corpora
tions, much of its success will
depend on the generosity of a
relatively small pool of donors with
long ties to Stanford.
But a primary aspect of the cam
paign is to encourage donors to
"stretch" beyond their past level
by giving even larger sums.
According to Development Of
fice predictions, approximately
1150 donors will be responsible
for $905 million of the campaign's
$1.1 billion target.
Stanford fundraisers have
compiled a list of campaign

"prospects," an assessment of po
tential donations from poeple and
organizations that have a history
of charitable giving to the Univer
sity.
Although Stanford is always
looking for new gift sources, past
campaigns have shown that iden
tifying large potential donors is in
many ways a "self-selecting
process," according to Richard
Bennett, associate campaign di
rector for the Office of Develop
ment.
"A general rule of fundraising is
your biggest donors are usually
already on your rolls," he said.
The number of prospects who
eventually contribute is a function
of both the size of the contribu
tion and the level of personal at
tention provided by campaign vol
unteers and the Development Of
fice staff, according to Bruce
Hinchliffe, Associate Vice-
President for Development and
campaign director.
Of the 500 prospects at the
Leadership Gift Level — $1 million
and above — approximately 200
may actually make campaign com
mittments. Bennett said. Accord
ing to Development Office statis
tics, these donors could pledge up
to $705 million.
The percentage of prospects
who make these particularly large
campaign commitments de
creases as the predicted donation
level of the prospect declines.
Hinchliffe said.
Of the 13.000 prospects who
could potentially donate at the
Keystone Level — * 10.000 to
* 100.000 — only two or three
thousand will give in this range.
Bennett said.
To help the 240 paid staff mem
bers associated with the Develop
ment Office, University officials
estimate that up to 8,000 alumni
volunteers will be needed during
the course of the campaign. "We're
a very volunteer-oriented fund
raising operation." Bennett said.
The volunteers are recruited
and trained by the Development
Office specifically to help prepare
them to make solicitations.
But Bennett said volunteers
also help develop campaign strat
egy. "It's not as if we create every
thing and say, 'Here, go solicit,' "
he said. "They are very involved in
the planning and the setting of
the strategy."
The "top" volunteers are the
four national campaign co-chairs:
Roy Anderson, Peter Bing, William
Kimball and Linda Meier.
Although volunteers assist the
campaign at all prospect levels,
the larger the gift, the more likely
that the pitch will be made by Uni
versity President Donald Kennedy
or a trustee, particularly for gifts
of $5 million or more.
"A volunteer may have helped
'open the door.' but the actual
solicitation will be done by a Uni
versity officer." Bennett said.
When courting a potential mul
timillion dollar donor, Stanford
fundraisers waste little time in

trying to match campaign goals
with a prospect's demonstrated
interest in the University.
Hinchliffe estimated that up to
one-quarter of the highest
prospects have already been con
tacted in some way by the cam
paign staff.
"You don't consummate a gift at
that level in a matter of days or
weeks," he said. "It's months and
sometimes years. That's a very sig
nificant commitment, and those
donors are usually very thoughtful
and sophisticated about it."
Preliminary talks between the
prospect and the campaign volun
teers and staff help Stanford iden
tify the donor's particular inter
ests, Bennett said. Many
prospects also visit the campus to
discuss possible donations with
the appropriate University offi
cers, deans and faculty.
But prospects are often here on
campus "simply because they're in
all likelihood closer and more in
volved with the institution,"
Hinchliffe said.
As a prospect's potential dona
tion level decreases, Stanford is
forced to adopt a more "process
oriented"' rather than "indivi
dually-crafted" approach because
of the sheer size of the prospect
pool, Hinchliffe said.
Over 1000 volunteers help so
licit donations from the 13,000
Keystone prospects, Hinchliffe
said. In contrast, only a few
hundred volunteers are desig
nated to solicit the 4,000 Leader
ship gift prospects, with Univer
sity officials and Development
staffers making up the difference.
But volunteers still play the key
role in gifts of $1 million or below,
Bennett said.
Although volunteers can be
characterized by their effective
ness and dedication to the cam
paign, Bennett said those higher
in the campaign structure are also
more likely to give of their own
wealth.
