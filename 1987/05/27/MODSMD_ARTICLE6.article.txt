# Fundraising targets alumni checkbooks
## 
### STEPHEN KASIERSKI Senior staff writer 
This is the second of a Jour-part
series examining Stanford's Cen
tennial Campaign.

When Stanford launches a
fundraising campaign, everyone
listens.
The $1.1 billion Centennial
Campaign is the largest fundrais
ing effort in the histoiy of private
education, and while University
officials and volunteers were for
mally announcing the campaign
last February, many Stanford
alumni were already reaching for
their checkbooks.
Although the campaign will
touch a broad spectrum of
alumni, foundations and corpora
tions, much of its success will
depend on the generosity of a
relatively small pool of donors with
long ties to Stanford.
But a primary aspect of the cam
paign is to encourage donors to
"stretch" beyond their past level
by giving even larger sums.
According to Development Of
fice predictions, approximately
1150 donors will be responsible
for $905 million of the campaign's
$1.1 billion target.
Stanford fundraisers have
compiled a list of campaign

"prospects," an assessment of po
tential donations from poeple and
organizations that have a history
of charitable giving to the Univer
sity.
Although Stanford is always
looking for new gift sources, past
campaigns have shown that iden
tifying large potential donors is in
many ways a "self-selecting
process," according to Richard
Bennett, associate campaign di
rector for the Office of Develop
ment.
"A general rule of fundraising is
your biggest donors are usually
already on your rolls," he said.
The number of prospects who
eventually contribute is a function
of both the size of the contribu
tion and the level of personal at
tention provided by campaign vol
unteers and the Development Of
fice staff, according to Bruce
Hinchliffe, Associate Vice-
President for Development and
campaign director.
Of the 500 prospects at the
Leadership Gift Level — $1 million
and above — approximately 200
may actually make campaign com
mittments. Bennett said. Accord
ing to Development Office statis
tics, these donors could pledge up
to $705 million.
