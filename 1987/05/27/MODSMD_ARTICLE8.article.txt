Spy probe blames Israeli leaders
JERUSALEM —Two official inquiries into the Jonathan Pollard
spy affair yesterday night reported that Israel's senior political
leaders bore responsibility for failing to uncover and end the
espionage operation in the United States but did not recommend
action against them.
Taken together, the two reports constitute an unprecedented
attack on the abilities of Israel's top leadership.
In a critical report, a seven-member parliamentary subcommit
tee singled out Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin and his predeces
sor. Moshe Arens, now a minister without portfolio. It said the two
men bore ministerial responsibility for the affair, which has badly
strained U.S.-Israeli relations, because the spy agency involved,
since disbanded, operated inside their ministry.
A second report, from a two-member committee appointed by
the Cabinet, also criticized the lack of proper supervision of the
spy unit but said the responsibilty should be shared among the
entire Cabinet.
Aquittal denies justice to Donovan
NEW YORK — He returned home to champagne and balloons,
laughter and tears, but former Secretary of Labor Raymond
Donovan said Tuesday that he remained bitter after his acquittal
on grand larceny and fraud charges and was anxious to change
the grand jury system.
"We've been terribly abused by the system." Donovan told the
Los Angeles Times in his first interview since the jury verdict late
Monday afternoon. "The jury gave us freedom, but the system
denied us justice."
Donovan, 56, and his wife Catherine returned to their Short
Hills, N.J., home alone Monday evening to celebrate until 1 a.m.
with their three grown children after a Bronx jury acquitted
Donovan and seven co-defendants on charges of defrauding the
New York City Transit Authority of $7.4 million.
"Right now it's just nice to be at home without this dark cloud
hanging over us." Mrs. Donovan, 50, said in a separate telephone
interview. "It's been so long in coming. That innocent people
should be hurt like this ... it's just unbearable," she added, her
voice cracking.
Donovan said he gained a new appreciation for the criminal
justice system, especially for those unable to pay the estimated
$13 million to $15 million the marathon case cost him and his
seven co-defendants.
During breaks in his trial. Donovan said he often walked the
long, marble halls of the giant, graffiti-scarred courthouse in the
South Bronx, and talked to defendants in other, less glamorous
criminal trials.
"It was frightening to see some of those poor people who had pro
bono attorneys with 82 files under their arms yelling out,
Rodriguez!' and not knowing who Rodriguez was, and pulling out
the file and not knowing what was in there, and then going into
the courtroom," he said. "It was a very sobering experience."
INS to distribute new sanction info
WASHINGTON — The Immigration and Naturalization Service,
faced with complaints about its education program on employer
sanctions, unveiled new information materials yesterday and
promised to distribute them by early July.
Beginning immediately, millions of worker-verification forms,
handbooks and videotapes will be sent to INS offices, trade as
sociations, news organizations and employers, Alan Nelson, INS
commissioner, told a news conference.
Critics have charged that many employers had incomplete or in
accurate information on the penalties, prompting some to fire or
turn away foreign-born workers indiscriminately. The sanctions,
which include fines and possible jail terms for employers who
knowingly hire illegal immigrants, were originally scheduled to go
into effect June 1, with a year in which warnings would be issued
to first offenders.
Nelson defended the INS education effort as adequate and
asserted that fear of congressional action did not motivate him to
order the one-month delay. He said that he ordered it simply to al
low time for delivery of the verification forms, which employers
will use to certify that all new employees — including U.S. citizens
— are legal residents of this country.
Last week, the Senate voted 48-45 to delay the sanctions until
Oct. 1. The measure will be reconsidered by the Senate this week
and, if passed again, would still have to be approved in a House-
Senate conference.
U.S. seeks NATO aid in Gulf
BRUSSELS — Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger pressed
the NATO allies yesterday to demonstrate increased support for
expanding U.S. efforts to protect oil shipments in the Persian
Gulf.
A show of allied concern and coordinated military presence in
the Gulf has become particularly important to the Reagan admin
istration as it draws up security plans for Kuwaiti oil vessels that
will be flying an American flag according to a registration transfer
agreement under negotiation and likely to be concluded soon.
A number of U.S. congressmen have sought a tighter definition
of U.S. military commitments in the gulf since an Iraqi warplane
shot two Exocet missiles into the U.S. guided-missile frigate Stark
on May 17. killing 37 American sailors and wounding 21. Military
cooperation and expressions of concern from European allies
would enhance administration dealings with Congress on this
issue by demonstrating that the United States has not moved out
on its own.
The European allies traditionally have been reluctant to organ
ize joint military operations with the United States outside the At
lantic alliance area. But Weinberger, answering questions follow
ing a speech here last night, said the Persian Gulf should be con
sidered one facet of NATO responsibility since much of Western
Europe's oil comes from that area and passes through shipping
lanes threatened by the Iran-Iraq war.
Japan also gets much of its oil from the gulf and relies on free
shipping through the area of conflict.
Iran and Iraq have been firing on shipping targets in the gulf for
some time as part of their 7-year-old war. Both rely heavily on oil
exports to finance the military.
Sri Lanka troops launch offensive
COLOMBO. Sri Lanka (DPA) — Sri Lanka troops launched a
major offensive against separatist Tamil guerrillas in Jaffna early
yesterday, following nine days of sporadic operations.
Informed sources said two military brigades began advancing
on Velvitturai and Point Pedro, north of Jaffna, and sealing off the
area from guerrilla intrusion from the rest of the northern Jaffna
Peninsular.
The government declared a 48-hour curfew in the strife-torn
Jaffna peninsular and yesterday's attack began with heavy bom
bardments on Velvitturai. the hometown of Veluppillai Prab
hakaran. the leader of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam,
which is seeking a separate Tamil homeland.
Informed sources said about 8.000 soldiers, supported by
Italian-made machetti bombers and several helicopter gunships.

Spy probe blames Israeli leaders
JERUSALEM —Two official inquiries into the Jonathan Pollard
spy affair yesterday night reported that Israel's senior political
leaders bore responsibility for failing to uncover and end the
espionage operation in the United States but did not recommend
action against them.
Taken together, the two reports constitute an unprecedented
attack on the abilities of Israel's top leadership.
In a critical report, a seven-member parliamentary subcommit
tee singled out Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin and his predeces
sor. Moshe Arens, now a minister without portfolio. It said the two
men bore ministerial responsibility for the affair, which has badly
strained U.S.-Israeli relations, because the spy agency involved,
since disbanded, operated inside their ministry.
A second report, from a two-member committee appointed by
the Cabinet, also criticized the lack of proper supervision of the
spy unit but said the responsibilty should be shared among the
entire Cabinet.
Aquittal denies justice to Donovan
NEW YORK — He returned home to champagne and balloons,
laughter and tears, but former Secretary of Labor Raymond
Donovan said Tuesday that he remained bitter after his acquittal
on grand larceny and fraud charges and was anxious to change
the grand jury system.
"We've been terribly abused by the system." Donovan told the
Los Angeles Times in his first interview since the jury verdict late
Monday afternoon. "The jury gave us freedom, but the system
denied us justice."
Donovan, 56, and his wife Catherine returned to their Short
Hills, N.J., home alone Monday evening to celebrate until 1 a.m.
with their three grown children after a Bronx jury acquitted
Donovan and seven co-defendants on charges of defrauding the
New York City Transit Authority of $7.4 million.
"Right now it's just nice to be at home without this dark cloud
hanging over us." Mrs. Donovan, 50, said in a separate telephone
interview. "It's been so long in coming. That innocent people
should be hurt like this ... it's just unbearable," she added, her
voice cracking.
Donovan said he gained a new appreciation for the criminal
justice system, especially for those unable to pay the estimated
$13 million to $15 million the marathon case cost him and his
seven co-defendants.
During breaks in his trial. Donovan said he often walked the
long, marble halls of the giant, graffiti-scarred courthouse in the
South Bronx, and talked to defendants in other, less glamorous
criminal trials.
"It was frightening to see some of those poor people who had pro
bono attorneys with 82 files under their arms yelling out,
Rodriguez!' and not knowing who Rodriguez was, and pulling out
the file and not knowing what was in there, and then going into
the courtroom," he said. "It was a very sobering experience."
INS to distribute new sanction info
WASHINGTON — The Immigration and Naturalization Service,
faced with complaints about its education program on employer
sanctions, unveiled new information materials yesterday and
promised to distribute them by early July.
Beginning immediately, millions of worker-verification forms,
handbooks and videotapes will be sent to INS offices, trade as
sociations, news organizations and employers, Alan Nelson, INS
commissioner, told a news conference.
Critics have charged that many employers had incomplete or in
accurate information on the penalties, prompting some to fire or
turn away foreign-born workers indiscriminately. The sanctions,
which include fines and possible jail terms for employers who
knowingly hire illegal immigrants, were originally scheduled to go
into effect June 1, with a year in which warnings would be issued
to first offenders.
Nelson defended the INS education effort as adequate and
asserted that fear of congressional action did not motivate him to
order the one-month delay. He said that he ordered it simply to al
low time for delivery of the verification forms, which employers
will use to certify that all new employees — including U.S. citizens
— are legal residents of this country.
Last week, the Senate voted 48-45 to delay the sanctions until
Oct. 1. The measure will be reconsidered by the Senate this week
and, if passed again, would still have to be approved in a House-
Senate conference.
U.S. seeks NATO aid in Gulf
BRUSSELS — Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger pressed
the NATO allies yesterday to demonstrate increased support for
expanding U.S. efforts to protect oil shipments in the Persian
Gulf.
A show of allied concern and coordinated military presence in
the Gulf has become particularly important to the Reagan admin
istration as it draws up security plans for Kuwaiti oil vessels that
will be flying an American flag according to a registration transfer
agreement under negotiation and likely to be concluded soon.
A number of U.S. congressmen have sought a tighter definition
of U.S. military commitments in the gulf since an Iraqi warplane
shot two Exocet missiles into the U.S. guided-missile frigate Stark
on May 17. killing 37 American sailors and wounding 21. Military
cooperation and expressions of concern from European allies
would enhance administration dealings with Congress on this
issue by demonstrating that the United States has not moved out
on its own.
The European allies traditionally have been reluctant to organ
ize joint military operations with the United States outside the At
lantic alliance area. But Weinberger, answering questions follow
ing a speech here last night, said the Persian Gulf should be con
sidered one facet of NATO responsibility since much of Western
Europe's oil comes from that area and passes through shipping
lanes threatened by the Iran-Iraq war.
Japan also gets much of its oil from the gulf and relies on free
shipping through the area of conflict.
Iran and Iraq have been firing on shipping targets in the gulf for
some time as part of their 7-year-old war. Both rely heavily on oil
exports to finance the military.
Sri Lanka troops launch offensive
COLOMBO. Sri Lanka (DPA) — Sri Lanka troops launched a
major offensive against separatist Tamil guerrillas in Jaffna early
yesterday, following nine days of sporadic operations.
Informed sources said two military brigades began advancing
on Velvitturai and Point Pedro, north of Jaffna, and sealing off the
area from guerrilla intrusion from the rest of the northern Jaffna
Peninsular.
The government declared a 48-hour curfew in the strife-torn
Jaffna peninsular and yesterday's attack began with heavy bom
bardments on Velvitturai. the hometown of Veluppillai Prab
hakaran. the leader of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam,
which is seeking a separate Tamil homeland.
Informed sources said about 8.000 soldiers, supported by
Italian-made machetti bombers and several helicopter gunships.
