# Court OKs 'preventive detention' 6-3
## 
### 
WASHINGTON - The Supreme
Court, resolving one of the most
divisive civil liberties controver
sies of recent years, ruled for the
first time yesterday that suspects
accused of serious crimes may be
held in "preventive detention"
before trial if a judge determines
that they are a danger to the
public.
The court, in a 6-3 decision,
rejected arguments by two New
York City Mafia leaders that their
pretrial detention without bail vio
lated their constitutional rights to
due process and the presumption
that they were innocent and could
not be punished until proven
guilty.
Chief Justice William
Rehnquist, writing for the
majority, upheld the con
stitutionality of the Bail Reform
Act of 1984, which had been
strongly supported by the Reagan
administration and many law en

forcement officials. Rehnquist
was joined by Justices Byron
White, Harry Blackmun, Lewis
Powell. Sandra Day O'Connor and
Antonin Scalia.
"We have repeatedly held."
Rehnquist said, "that the govern
ment's regulatory interest in com
munity safety can, in appropriate
circumstances, outweigh an indi
vidual's liberty interest."
Justice Thurgood Marshall, in a
sharply worded dissent, accused
the majority of "an exercise in ob
fuscation." of being "disin
genuous." and allowing "impris
onment upon prediction."
Justice Department spokesman
Terry Eastland said "the decision
means that our society will be a
safer one. Those who are demon
strated to be dangerous to the
community can be kept from
preying upon it."
American Civil Liberties Union
officials called the ruling a

"dangerous setback for civil
liberties." They said it would en
courage 23 states and the District
of Columbia, which have similar
laws, to strengthen existing
statutes and spur other states to
adopt and extensively use such
laws in thousands of cases.
The 1984 law allows the govern
ment to ask a judge to hold a
suspect charged with a serious
crime without bail if there was no
other way before trial to
"reasonably assure ...the safety of
any other person and the commu
nity."
The law was an expansion of
earlier state and federal statutes
that allowed such detention only if
a suspect was likely to flee or to
prevent the suspect from harming
witnesses or judges and jurors.
Yesterday's case involved the
pretrial detention in March 1986
of Mafia leader Anthony "Fat
Tony" Salerno, head of the

Genovese family, and Vincent
"Fish" Cafaro. an alleged captain
in the organization.
A federal appeals court in New
York ruled last July that their
detention under the Bail Reform
Act of 1984 was unconstitutional
because it was "repugnant to the
concept of substantive due
process. which we believe
prohibits the total deprivation of
liberty" in order to prevent future
crimes. Six other federal appeals
courts had upheld the law.
Rehnquist, overturning the ap
peals court, said that Congress, in
enacting the 1984 law. did not in
tend pretrial detention as punish
ment. "Congress instead per
ceived pretrial detention as a po
tential solution to a pressing
societal problem. There is no
doubt that preventing danger to
the community is a legitimate
regulatory goal."
