Like most of their contemporaries, the Pappenheimers were simple,
illiterate people. They were subjected to extensive interrogation, often
under torture. Their statements, recorded in painstaking detail by an
officiating clerk, and preserved in Bavarian archives, make up the prin

yet the power of torture soon forced more harmful matter from their lips.
They confessed to hundreds of robberies, murders, and acts of arson. They
spoke of demons and potions. The Pappenheimers were just what the
authorities had been looking for—criminals in league with the Devil, suita
ble dependents for a show trial that was needed to restore law and order
in a chaotic time. f*or this was an age of fear—both real and superstitious.
