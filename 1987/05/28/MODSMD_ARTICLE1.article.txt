# Minorities complain of police harassment
## 
### TODD PIERCE Staff writer 
This week's forum on racism at
Stanford uncovered startling
stories of harassment of
minorities by campus police.
Whether such reports represent
isolated incidents or a significant
and widespread occurrence is a
source of contention between Uni
versity administrators and
minority groups.
Although University officials are
worried about the incidence of
minority harassment and have
asked victims to report cases, they
regard the violations as isolated
occurrences.
"I would be quite distraught if
there's a pattern to it, and I don't
think there is," said William
Massy, vicepresident in charge of
police affairs. "I can't deny that
such things can occur in isola
tion, but that doesn't make a pat
tern."
Bill King, chair of the Black Stu
dent Union, disagreed with this
assessment. He pointed to the fre
quency of harassment and linked
it to a national antagonism be
tween blacks and law enforcement
officials.
According to King, the number
of cases in the black community,
especially involving police ques
tioning of black males, is
"alarmingly frequent" on the
relatively safe Stanford campus.
"The police are patrolling
campus as if it's a high-crime
area. The police have to go
through an education program â€”
you can't just go and pick up every
black male on campus," he said.
The violations occur on "too fre
quent a basis to be coincidental."
King said he considers the
removal of guns from officers
patrolling campus and a
revamped education program as
essential to improving the rela
tionship between the police and
the black community.
"The policemen need to be ed
ucated that being black isn't
suspicion enough for being picked
up," he said.
Former BSU chairs Amanda
Kemp and Stephen Phillips
related a series of cases involving
blacks who were arbitrarily picked
up by police. They pointed to the
tendency of police to see blacks as
criminals.
"Police harassment of blacks,
especially black men, is a national
phenomenon based on flimsy
reasoning," Kemp said. "There is
a perception of black people as
criminals, as if blacks don't
belong in places like Palo Alto or
Stanford."
Phillips said he was picked up
by police in search of a rape
suspect despite the fact that he is
six inches taller than the suspect
in the police description.
