## THE 						STANFORD DAILY An Independent Newspaper Synergy lamented 
### 
Since Synergy has been unable to attract
enough students to live there the University
has decided that it can no longer retain its
status as a co-op.
While residents at the house claim the
decision was unfair, the evidence suggests
otherwise. The policy requiring a house to fill
90 percent of its spaces by the end of Round
Two of the Draw is not an example of the ca
price of the Administration; it has been the
rule for several years.
There is no question that a house with a
distinctive theme, such as Synergy, has an
uphill battle trying to attract students to live
there. Still, considering the perpetual
housing shortage on campus, a house whose
theme keeps students from living there must
change.
Synergy residents had ample warning that
they were in danger of losing their house. If
they sincerely believed that an outreach pro
gram would have attracted students to the
co-op, they should have carried it out some
time ago. Instead, they act as if the decision
came from nowhere.

Nevertheless, we should lament the loss of
another house that dared to be different.
There seems to be a trend toward conformity
among University residences, whereas
Synergy offered a distinct alternative — dis
tinct even from other co-ops. Stanford stu
dents seem to be rejecting anything that is
not mainstream. This trend is most certainly
an unfortunate one in a school that strives to
promote diversity in all facets of life.
The "end" of Synergy need not be a per
manent. The University should leave the
door open to a similar residence in the fu
ture. If, in a year or two, a sufficiently large
group of students proposes a house like
Synergy, they should be taken seriously.
Perhaps a smaller house might then be
chosen that will allow it to be filled with less
difficulty. In addition, if the house was lo
cated near the center of campus it also might
attract more students.
If such a proposal never materializes, then
Synergy is indeed gone for the duration. If
that is the case the University has lost an im
portant housing choice.
