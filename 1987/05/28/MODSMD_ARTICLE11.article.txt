Join the CIR
The ASSU Senate last night
reversed its earlier decision and
voted to consider nominees for
student members of the Commit
tee on Investment Responsibility.
It is our hope that students on
the CIR will continue to articulate
student interests and work
closely with trustees, who have
expressed a willingness to be
open to the ClR's recommen
dations regarding divestment.
Students interested in serving
on this important committee
should submit applications to the
Nominations Commission, in the
ASSU business office on the

second floor of Tresidder Union.

Partisanship
is not a factor
As someone who has been
deeply involved in the summer
internship program in Washing
ton, D.C. (and with planning the
new Stanford-in-Washington
campus), I was concerned with
the statements in Steve Hellman's
recent viewpoint (Daily, May 19)
entitled "Conservatives are
rejected here." Hellman claimed
that partisan politics influence
Washington, D.C., internship
placements.

In the past few years, we have
helped hundreds of students find
internships in Washington. We
do not have an exact count by
political affiliation because, con
trary to Hellman's perceptions,
that has never been a relevant
factor.
My best guess is that half, or
perhaps more than half, have
been with Republican or non
partisan organizations, including
at least one recent White House
placement.
Partisan politics is never a
factor in determining a "good"
internship. I would welcome any
leads for more positions from
Hellman and urge him to pass
them on.
