As a participant in the trip to El Salvador over
spring break, I was appalled by the distorted front
page article claiming the trip was marred by contro
versy (Daily, May 20). I would like to question not
only the incentive behind writing such an over
generalized and sweeping piece, but also the
credibility of an article made up entirely of quotes
taken out of context.

1 doubt anyone on the trip would have gone had
they thought the whole week would be spent solely
doing reconstruction work. A trip to a country at war
is inherently political — even a trip that's partly in
tended for humanitarian purposes. Just being in a
country will inevitably expose its members to the
country's political and social climate.
We all expected to do some fact-finding and to
develop an understanding of El Salvador's
precarious situation. In fact, it would have been ir
responsible had we not made an effort to learn about
the current Salvadoran situation and to publicize
our findings upon our return.
True, we were hosted by AGEUS, a leftist student
group, but they certainly didn't try to indoctrinate us

with their views and made special efforts for us to
meet with groups antithetical to their own.
For example, we met and talked with U.S. Embassy
representatives, a colonel from the military, a mem
ber of the powerful Fourteen Families, representa
tives of ANEP (a private entrepreneurial
organization) and a member of FUSADES (a conser
vative economic think tank).
Everyone returned with different interpretations
and reactions. Perhaps the preliminary plan was not
comprehensive enough, but we successfully revised
the itinerary to give us an unbiased and complete ex
perience.
I would like to further question the intent of such
an article. Given that there is no raging
"controversy" about our trip across campus and that
The Daily must have gone out of its way to dig up and
misrepresent so many quotes, it must have ap
proached this article with a biased agenda already in
mind.
The article, in fact, has created its own self-defined
"controversy." The Daily, by reporting highly
selective facts and using quotes out of context, is
simply engaging in indulgent journalism and trying
to undermine and discredit an educational trip that
offered us and the Stanford community a great deal.
