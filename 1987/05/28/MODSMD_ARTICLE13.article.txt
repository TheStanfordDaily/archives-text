# Criticism lacks understanding

1 am writing in response to Perry Friedman's
recent viewpoint (Daily , May 21). lam angered
by that letter — angry at the libelous state
ments he chooses to make, and angry that
there still exist such uninformed, insensitive,
immature and intolerant views on a campus
like this.

Why does the Rainbow Agenda seek answers
to its questions and action for its demands?
Why does it use strong symbols in its protest?
Why does it seek to bring minority faculty and
students to Stanford? And why do the
minority communities continue to strive?
The crilic Friedman fails to understand the
need for seriousness, for action, to press the
agenda. The powerful civil rights movement is
what gained black rights; they were not the gift
of a benign central government. Writing Uni
versity President Donald Kennedy a letter will
not bring about our needs: taking action to
show that we are one may.
There must be sit-ins. there must be
protests. They will not obviate the need for dis
cussion. but they will spark it. When discus
sion is sparked there will eventually be
answers and then the action that is needed.
This is why we protest; this is why we raise our
fists.
The raised-fist black power symbol is an ex
pression of our solidarity with those who have
struggled in the past and our determination to
continue that struggle. It won't be over until
this country recognizes the value of each cul
ture as different and recognizes that the legacy

of minority oppression is a long, deeply in
grained one that does not easily expunge from
the minds of either the oppressed or the op
pressor. The black-power raised fist says that
when we see oppression arising from racism
anywhere, consciously or unconsciously, we
will fight it together.
Why do our communities seek to bring this
issue to everyone? Because the Rainbow
Agenda is not for minorities alone. Everyone is
assisted by the fostering of different cultures
through minority recruitment, ethnic studies
and theme house programs.
I live in a theme house, and non-minorities
there almost exclusively state that they receive
a tremendous broadening, learning experience
from being there, one they would not trade
away. They learn about the world and learn
how to accept people. Perhaps Friedman, who
does not understand theme houses, would
benefit bv visiting one for a change — or at
least talking to us civilly.
Why does the Rainbow Agenda ask for in
creased minority admissions and increased
hiring of minority faculty if their percentages
at Stanford equal those in the general popula
tion. as Friedman suggests? First, because he
is factually wrong. The percentage of blacks
coming to Stanford each year is two-thirds
their percentage in the population. And as for
faculty and staff, how many tenured Latino
professors are there? I can count them on the
fingers of two hands. With two friends' hands.
I could count tenured blacks as well.
Second, action on hiring and admissions is
needed because there is no other way to ad
dress the wrongs of the past. Without strong
and positive affirmative action programs and
admissions programs, how long would it take

for minorities to gain equal status in reality as
well as equal rights under the law?
The problem is that many like Friedman for
get that it has not even been 25 years since
blacks were effectively given the right to vote.
There are still many people who view
minorities on unequal footing, and there are
even more who disregard the problems
minorities still face and the struggle they still
must make. One of those people causes me to
write today.
Finally, perhaps we should consider what
Friedman suggests for those who are dis
satisfied with Stanford: Why should they not
divest themselves from the University? Is it,
after all, merely "constructive engagement" to
remain at this school to try and change it?
No. We are not corporations come to Stan
ford to exploit it for profit; we are the ones who
live here already. We are the ones for whom it
was built. Students are the indigenous people
of the University, and if blacks in South Africa
must fight for their rights in their land, so we
must fight for ours at Stanford. If we do not,
where are we to go? If students at every Univer
sity do not fight when things are wrong, where
are they all to go?
The problems at this University are less than
those of the South of the '60s. which in turn
are less than those of the time of slavery. But
the battle is not over until it is over. Someday,
when the old segregationists have passed
away, when the people of the United States are
taught the history and respect of all peoples,
there will be no need for a response like this.
That day is not yet here.
Darline Mondeslr Is an undeclared fresh
man.
