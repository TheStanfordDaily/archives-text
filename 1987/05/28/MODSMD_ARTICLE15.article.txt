# Stanford doesn't cater

### 
Perry Friedman's recent viewpoint (Daily, May 21)
raises a number of points in a futile attempt to refute
the Third World agenda that has been presented to
the University.

DAVID PORTER

The article begins with a statement which is so ab
surd that it is difficult to believe that its author is a
Stanford student. Friedman states that the Univer
sity actually caters to minority students. I wish this
were the case but this is not borne out by the facts.
All one needs to do is look back over the history of
minority students at Stanford to know that this Uni
versity does not cater to the needs of its minority stu
dents.
The interests and concerns of minorities have
been expressed quite strongly over the past 20 years
but the results have been far from promising.
Twenty years after similar demands were presented
to the University, we still find that minority students
are underrepresented at both the undergraduate and
graduate levels. The number of minority tenure
track faculty still needs significant improvement.
Minority staff members are under represented and
seem to face an invisible barrier that prevents them
from rising to the highest levels of the Administra
tion. Ethnic theme houses still come under attack on
an annual basis from a community that does not un
derstand them. And finally, undergraduates at Stan
ford are still being taught that the only culture of im
portance is Western culture. All of these factors
demonstrates Stanford, if it is catering to minorities,
is doing a very poor job.
The long period of time for which these problems
have existed provides an explanation for more visible
protests. Black students have been talking with Uni
versity administrators about these issues for years.
We have met with the president, the provost, deans,
committees and anyone else who was concerned â€”
with very little success.
The response of the University establishment has
meant that more drastic means are necessary. The
protests Cornerstone Weekend and the sit-in at Uni
versity President Donald Kennedy's office are a sign
that minority students are no longer going to accept
the University's runaround.
Friedman's first major point addresses the issue of
minority student recruitment. He states that there is
a committee for minority recruitment and that the
"enrollment of blacks is on par with their percentage
in the general population."
This point serves to demonstrate that he has not
done his homework on the issues involved. The total
number of black students at Stanford is approxi
mately 650 out of a total student population of over
13,000. A little arithmetic shows us that this is
about 5 percent, or less than half of the percentage of
blacks in the United States.
He then attempts to address the need for greater
recruitment in inner-city schools, his point being
that students from inner-city schools are under
represented for the whole student body. He ignores
the fact that minorities are disproportionately over
represented in these inner-city schools, and that ig
noring these schools limits the pool of qualified

minority applicants who might wish to attend. He
also fails to address the need for Stanford to improve
the diverse nature of its population by recruiting at
these schools.
Friedman then continues with a childish attempt
to discredit the goals of the Third World agenda by
stating that the group is not representative. Al
though the people who put together the agenda may
not represent every minority on campus, they do,
however, represent a significant number of students
who have valid concerns.
His attempt to show that the agenda is racist be
cause it demands a vice provost for minority affairs
who is a person of color serves to further demon
strate his lack of understanding of the issues in
volved and deserves a specific response.
This position is requested for a number of reasons.
First, there is a need to coordinate the concerns of
the minority students on campus. Second, the per
son who holds this responsibility must have the
power and the resources to make real changes within
the University. Third, the person must be important
enough to have input on the issues facing minorities
at the highest levels. And fourth, this helps to ad
dress the problem of getting minority staff into the
top levels of the Administration.
To understand why this person needs to be a
minority, one has to have an understanding of the
problems that minorities face at Stanford. All of the
problems I have cited have a detrimental impact on
the mental and emotional well-being of minority stu
dents here. It is impossible to explain all of the emo
tions that are felt and it is harder to understand
them if you haven't experienced them yourself. To ex
pect an administrator in this position to be able to ef
fectively articulate feelings and concerns of the
minority students, he or she must be able to
thoroughly understand them. This understanding
can only come through the experience of being a
minority.
Friedman seems to be slightly upset by the
thought that the good image of Stanford is being
harmed by what he termed "minority bitching." This
brings me to the first point that he and 1 can agree
upon: Racism is not on the rise at Stanford. This
statement implies that at some point racism at Stan
ford was lower then it is now. That is not the case.
Racial problems may be glossed over from time to
time, but the problems minorities face here have not
changed since minorities started coming here in sig
nificant numbers.
Finally, Perry's solution to the racial problems at
Stanford, namely that minority students should
"divest" from the University, is both coun
terproductive to the University's espoused goals of
diversity and racist in its nature. Stanford is what it
is because of the contributions made by minorities.
This comment shows a level of insensitivity that
serves to prove our concerns about racist attitudes
on this campus.
Stanford cannot make these issues go away by ask
ing minority students to leave. It can only address
the problems by making concrete efforts to under
stand and address the concerns of the minority com
munities. Fortunately, the Third World agenda pro
vides an excellent place to start.
