# Trip promoted group thinking

### 
As a member of the Stanford delegation to El
Salvador, 1 wish to voice the fact that there Is a
big difference between education and In
doctrination — something that those In El Sal
vador who Invited us and the woman hired to
head the Stanford delegation clearly do not un
derstand, or more probably understand all too
well!

There Is also a difference between Stanford
sending a delegation to El Salvador to learn
about the situation and "assist students, fac
ulty and staff at the University of El Salvador In
rebuilding classrooms and other facilities
destroyed in the October 1986 earthquake," as
was the officially stated reason for the trip, and
one sent down to express political solidarity
with one of the warring parties — namely the
side of the Marxist-Leninist FMLN coalition.
it is clear that several people — at Stanford
and in El Salvador — who set up this trip
wished to use us for their own political ends.
Unfortunately, they were all too successful.
The student group AGEUS made it clear
from the start that they expected us to join in
solidarity with their fight. Two days later, a
number of members of the group — led by our
Stanford-chosen guide and a self-proclaimed
Marxist woman from England in our delega
tion — Insisted on making and carrying a ban
ner which said "U.S. Out of El Salvador" with
the other two Stanford banners.
Because the sign was being carried by Stan
ford students with the other Stanford ban
ners, which said simply "Stanford Students
for Peace in El Salvador," it immediately
caught the attention of several television
camera crews, including an Australian televi
sion network and NBC, who came by to inter
view those carrying it. This incident was un

fortunate for we had been in the country only
48 hours when the decision was made, with
out group consultation, to carry this sign with
the others. Several of us did not march in the
commemoration of the death of Archbishop
Romero because of it.
What this trip encouraged was simplistic
group thinking. El Salvador has a complex sit
uation in terms of both its political and eco
nomic history. We received a lot of pressure
during the trip to see the issues in very black
and white terms and to give our verbal support
in El Salvador and especially here at Stanford
for the leftist guerrilla movement.
The rector of the University of El Salvador
mentioned to us, for instance, that blocks of
political power have historically been the right
and the left and that a democratic middle can
not survive. Therefore, he told us that we must
choose one of the two extremes and, of course,
since the left represented the people, it was the
best choice.
Many people in our group fell for this way of
thinking. They acted as though those of us
who wished to remain neutral and simply
learn were "closed-minded" conservatives.
They, on the other hand, considered them
selves the ones who were "open-minded" since
they proclaimed the truth of the left.
They, however, are the ones who seem to
have forgotten the educational nature of the
trip. They also seem to have forgotten that not
everyone was planning to go down to El Sal
vador to make political statements. How could
they possibly expect after a few days of a very
pro-leftist program that every single member of
the delegation would agree with group state
ments and actions, in the names of ourselves
and of Stanford, on behalf of one of the war
ring parties against a democratic government?
Instead, a number of the group have come
out on the side of the "liberation movement,"
and have made it sound as if we are all a group
of unthinking leftists, swinging around

Marxist-Leninist phraseology instead of sound
arguments, who went down to be in solidarity
with "the people" in their battle.
First of all. not all of us take that position.
Second of all, the very fact that some of the
group now sees itself as a political faction sent
down by Stanford for propaganda purposes,
instead of for earthquake relief and a
"comprehensive" view of the political situation
as was promised in the application, shows how
far the purpose of the trip and the rights of
those on the delegation with other opinions or
no strong opinions have been abused.
I think that this also hurts Stanford's repu
tation and ability — and particularly that of
the Public Service Center's — to have such
educational trips in the future. This is a
shame for these kinds of trips should be able to
take place without idealogues taking over and
transforming them from educational to politi
cal groups while in the country.
Fortunately, the Public Service Center did
have the associate dean of the law school, Tom
Mcßride, come on the trip. His presence and
influence maintained a sense of balance on the
trip. He is a man who sees how complex the El
Salvador situation is and who seemed to
realize what kinds of pressures were being
placed on the group both from the university
students, who went everywhere with us
making sure that we not forget the"truth,"
and from those in our own delegation.
Finally, 1 would like to mention that it really
is not necessary for students interested in
places like El Salvador to come down on one of
the sides of a war. Instead, it might be better to
take our readings, conversations and experi
ences into account in trying to think of ways to
bring peace and a better standard of living to
the people of that poor country. What we
should be searching for is peace — not
ideological reasons to support more
bloodshed.

As a member of the Stanford delegation to El
Salvador, 1 wish to voice the fact that there Is a
big difference between education and In
doctrination — something that those In El Sal
vador who Invited us and the woman hired to
head the Stanford delegation clearly do not un
derstand, or more probably understand all too
well!

There Is also a difference between Stanford
sending a delegation to El Salvador to learn
about the situation and "assist students, fac
ulty and staff at the University of El Salvador In
rebuilding classrooms and other facilities
destroyed in the October 1986 earthquake," as
was the officially stated reason for the trip, and
one sent down to express political solidarity
with one of the warring parties — namely the
side of the Marxist-Leninist FMLN coalition.
it is clear that several people — at Stanford
and in El Salvador — who set up this trip
wished to use us for their own political ends.
Unfortunately, they were all too successful.
The student group AGEUS made it clear
from the start that they expected us to join in
solidarity with their fight. Two days later, a
number of members of the group — led by our
Stanford-chosen guide and a self-proclaimed
Marxist woman from England in our delega
tion — Insisted on making and carrying a ban
ner which said "U.S. Out of El Salvador" with
the other two Stanford banners.
Because the sign was being carried by Stan
ford students with the other Stanford ban
ners, which said simply "Stanford Students
for Peace in El Salvador," it immediately
caught the attention of several television
camera crews, including an Australian televi
sion network and NBC, who came by to inter
view those carrying it. This incident was un

fortunate for we had been in the country only
48 hours when the decision was made, with
out group consultation, to carry this sign with
the others. Several of us did not march in the
commemoration of the death of Archbishop
Romero because of it.
What this trip encouraged was simplistic
group thinking. El Salvador has a complex sit
uation in terms of both its political and eco
nomic history. We received a lot of pressure
during the trip to see the issues in very black
and white terms and to give our verbal support
in El Salvador and especially here at Stanford
for the leftist guerrilla movement.
The rector of the University of El Salvador
mentioned to us, for instance, that blocks of
political power have historically been the right
and the left and that a democratic middle can
not survive. Therefore, he told us that we must
choose one of the two extremes and, of course,
since the left represented the people, it was the
best choice.
Many people in our group fell for this way of
thinking. They acted as though those of us
who wished to remain neutral and simply
learn were "closed-minded" conservatives.
They, on the other hand, considered them
selves the ones who were "open-minded" since
they proclaimed the truth of the left.
They, however, are the ones who seem to
have forgotten the educational nature of the
trip. They also seem to have forgotten that not
everyone was planning to go down to El Sal
vador to make political statements. How could
they possibly expect after a few days of a very
pro-leftist program that every single member of
the delegation would agree with group state
ments and actions, in the names of ourselves
and of Stanford, on behalf of one of the war
ring parties against a democratic government?
Instead, a number of the group have come
out on the side of the "liberation movement,"
and have made it sound as if we are all a group
of unthinking leftists, swinging around

Marxist-Leninist phraseology instead of sound
arguments, who went down to be in solidarity
with "the people" in their battle.
First of all. not all of us take that position.
Second of all, the very fact that some of the
group now sees itself as a political faction sent
down by Stanford for propaganda purposes,
instead of for earthquake relief and a
"comprehensive" view of the political situation
as was promised in the application, shows how
far the purpose of the trip and the rights of
those on the delegation with other opinions or
no strong opinions have been abused.
I think that this also hurts Stanford's repu
tation and ability — and particularly that of
the Public Service Center's — to have such
educational trips in the future. This is a
shame for these kinds of trips should be able to
take place without idealogues taking over and
transforming them from educational to politi
cal groups while in the country.
Fortunately, the Public Service Center did
have the associate dean of the law school, Tom
Mcßride, come on the trip. His presence and
influence maintained a sense of balance on the
trip. He is a man who sees how complex the El
Salvador situation is and who seemed to
realize what kinds of pressures were being
placed on the group both from the university
students, who went everywhere with us
making sure that we not forget the"truth,"
and from those in our own delegation.
Finally, 1 would like to mention that it really
is not necessary for students interested in
places like El Salvador to come down on one of
the sides of a war. Instead, it might be better to
take our readings, conversations and experi
ences into account in trying to think of ways to
bring peace and a better standard of living to
the people of that poor country. What we
should be searching for is peace — not
ideological reasons to support more
bloodshed.
