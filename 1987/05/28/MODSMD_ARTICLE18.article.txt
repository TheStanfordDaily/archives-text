Save Synergy
I am writing in response to the
Housing Office decision to con
vert Synergy House from a co-op
into a self-op. There are several
students in my position and we
are bothered in a number of ways
by this decision.
I am a guaranteed sophomore. I
drew 0056 in the Draw and listed
Synergy co-op as my first choice,
with a returning residence
Priority One. 1 am not being
granted my first choice. I am told
there is a fine line in the Draw
book that states the Housing
Office's right to close theme
houses, but going into the Draw,
and especially after receiving my
number, I was confident I would
be returning to Synergy. Weeks
later I am informed that the
house didn't fill and because of
our poor history, we must peti
tion for self-op status.
Our University has the problem
of misinformation about Synergy.
I found out about Synergy on my
own, by coincidence, and after
living here one year 1 want to
stay.
There are many positive aspects
of living here verbally supported
by the Housing Office that need

the University's help in publiciz
ing. My dinner guests are pleased
to learn about the alternative
lifestyle, yet people who have not
visited Synergy are bombarded by
rumors and discouraging words.
We who live here would not
object to the changes if we did not
feel they would harm our environ
ment. The weekly cook-crews are
the best part of living here. If
Synergy is forced to hire a cook, I
will feel disappointed at mealtime
â€” not to mention paying over
$ 1.000 more each year.
When choosing Synergy as a
co-op, more things than cooking
or food prices went into influenc
ing my decision and make it im
portant for the Draw system to fill
my choice. I have met many
graduate students who have
broadened my educational experi
ence. 1 have enjoyed gardening,
beekeeping and collecting
chicken eggs. I have met a diver
sity of people and feel rewarded
because of my growth in Synergy.
I feel extremely let down by the
decision to change Synergy into a
self-op, which would include
changing our house name. This
exhibits insensitivity and gives
unclear answers to solving the
unpopularity dilemma of Synergy.
