## Monterey offers visitors a stylish weekend getaway Hilton hospitality 
### JAMES DICKEY Editorial staff 
Monterey, the closer of the twin cities of Monterey
and Carmel, is a truly unique tourist experience. Be
tween Fisherman's Wharf, Cannery Row, the Mon
terey Aquarium, Fort Ord and numerous shops and
beaches, there is always something for the pleasure
seeker.
To take advantage of the area's excellent opportu
nities, there are several good hotels near the tourist
stops. Among the best known are the Monterey
Beach Hotel (right on the waterfront), the Sheraton
and Doubletree hotels (next to the wharf), and Mon
terey Plaza and Spindrift Inn on Cannery Row.
My guest and I stayed at Hilton's Monterey Resort
Hotel. Located just off Highway 1 and five minutes
from the Wharf and Cannery Row, the Hilton is quite
conveniently placed.
With 200 rooms, the Hilton has something for
everyone. Our room was a comfortable one, with a
king-size bed and spacious sitting area. Also
available are suites with catchy names like "The
Nancy Lopez Suite" or "The Jack Nicklaus Suite" —
one gets the idea.
The balcony, overlooking the sizeable pool, had
patio chairs and a table, which made it perfect for
lounging with a drink or book.
The sitting area included two chairs and a sofa
sleeper, all quite comfortable and fashionable.
All the amenities are provided, in true Hilton fash
ion. The jacuzzi that easily holds 20 people, the men
and women's saunas, the tennis courts and other
facilities serve to provide vacationers with every pos
sible diversion.
In addition to a nice but expensive restaurant, the
hotel has a pleasant bar and lounge that features live
music Thursday through Sunday.
The staff is efficient and courteous and as busines

slike as one would expect at "America's Business Ad
dress." In fact, the professional atmosphere could be
the only major drawback to the hotel. This is cer
tainly no bed-and-breakfast inn — it is an establish
ment run by a major hotel chain. Accordingly, room
and maid service were both timely and pleasant, as
one would expect at *90 or more per couple.
The Hilton at Monterey offers the standards of per
formance that have made Hilton successful world
wide — even if it isn't the most extravagant experi
ence available.
Seafood specialties
Rappa's Sea Food
Fisherman's Wharf, Monterey
No one visiting Monterey should miss Fisherman's
Wharf. Wandering along the Wharf, though it is not
as large as San Francisco's, is a truly pleasant way to
spend an afternoon.
The Wharf has several attractions, including bay
cruises — even one featuring a glass-bottomed boat
— boat charters, a theater and souvenir shops with
enough shot glasses and sea shells to choke a horse.
At the end of the Wharf is Rappa's Seafood. The
view from the dining room windows alone is worth
the price of the dinner, and the restaurant bears
more than a passing resemblance to Castagnola's or
Alioto's on San Francisco's wharf.
The pleasant decor is red and white, showing the
Italian influence as clearly as the eggplant par
megiana.
One of the dozens of waterfront restaurants in
Monterey, Rappa's is set apart by its reasonable
prices and excellent service.
The dinner selection is generous, with choices in
cluding Italian foods and pasta, seafood and steaks.
Prices range from $6 to $15 a la carte, with clam
chowder and salad costing an additional $2.
The clam chowder is delicious, though unusual. It

is not the thick, chalky white chowder New England
is so famous for, but is a well-spiced mix of fresh
clams In a slightly thinner sauce.
My selection of the Crab a la Newberg was well
rewarded. The tasty slices of crab meat were quite
fresh and anything but rubbery. The cheese sauce
was delicious and with the rice, made for a pleasant
dinner combination.
My guest's broiled salmon was as juicy and flaky as

anyone could wish, and, like the Crab Newberg, was*
served in just the right portions.
Rappa's features a satisfactory, inexpensive wine
list, in addition to the house wine, which we chose.
The white was fruity and not too dry, a nice comple
ment to the meal.
In all, Rappa's provides a pleasant, moderately
priced meal with excellent service and a picturesque
view. Reservations are accepted.
