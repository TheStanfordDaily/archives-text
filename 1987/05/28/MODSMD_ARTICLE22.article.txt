# What a difference the Volunteer Network makes
## 
### DAVID ATCHESON 
It was just about four years ago
when University President Donald
Kennedy gave a very special Com
mencement address to the class of
1983. In his speech Kennedy
stressed the importance and value
of public service on the part of
Stanford students, and he ex
horted them to go out and "make a
difference."
Kennedy's call did not go
unheeded. In the past four years.

organized community service at
Stanford has come a long way —
in large part because of the Stan
ford Volunteer Network.
During the academic year fol
lowing the speech, six students
committed to community service
proposed to Kennedy the idea of
creating a student organization
that would link together the
various service groups on
campus. They also proposed that
these groups be given offices un
der the same roof.

As a result, in the fall of 1984,
the Public Service Center ex
panded from a one-room office to
occupy all of Owen House, and the
Volunteer Network was founded to
coordinate Stanford's community
service efforts.
According to Megan Swezey, vol
unteer coordinator at Owen
House, the Volunteer Network
soon became a student service
group in its own right. Although
the organization functions as a
kind of liaison between various

service groups, it has recently
begun to independently sponsor
and promote many of its own proj
ects.
Among these efforts are annual
special projects. One of these,
Reach Out Today, is held during
the fall. On a Saturday, students
across campus participate with
their dorms in various service
projects in the local area.
This past fall more than 800
students took part, Swezey said.
Other annual events sponsored

by the network include the Spring
Charity Carnival and the Holiday
Sharing Drive. Swezey called this
year's carnival, which took place
April 11, especially successful.
More than 400 students volun
teered, many of them either man
ning booths or riding a bus that
shuttled children from East Palo
Alto to Wilbur Field.
The carnival booths offered ac
tivities ranging from Madera's bal
loon shaving to massages spon
sored by the Bridge. The Sigma Al

pha Epsilon fraternity conducted
a giant Twister game that was very
popular with the kids.
Besides raising over $1,200 for
the East Palo Alto Summer
Academy, the carnival was suc
cessful in that it "allowed the
children to see Stanford students
in their university environment,"
according to Hindola Dasgupta,
this year's booth chairperson for
the carnival.
"It was like opening up a private
realm to them," she added.
During the Holiday Sharing
Drive, which the network spon
sors during the weeks preceding
Thanksgiving, food, clothes and
toys are collected in boxes placed
in each student residence and
academic department.
The Volunteer Network also
sponsors a number of longer-term
group projects because "the com
munity doesn't just need volun
teers on one day," Swezey said.
With group projects such as
tutoring in East Palo Alto, Adopt
a-Grandparent. and Project TEAM
(athletic coaching in several
Ravenswood schools), the network
helps to fulfill ongoing community
needs. Stanford students who vol

unteer in group projects usually
make a weekly commitment of
about two hours, according to
Rosemarie Day. director of the
community service representa
tives.
According to Magdalena Fit
toria, tutoring program coordina
tor at Owen House, about 170
Stanford students are involved in
the program, tutoring in either
school or residential settings. The
benefits of this program extend
well beyond academics, she said.
"There may be some academic
enrichment, but it's also really im
portant to say that we are role
models for the kids." Fittoria said.
Swezey called Project TEAM a
good example of how the network
can help turn innovative student
ideas for community service into
successful projects. TEAM quickly
grew from an idea for helping out
East Palo Alto school sports pro
grams into a project involving

Roble. Lagunita. Toyon and Otero
and the four Ravenswood schools
to which the dorms are matched.
"We go there twice a week and
basically coach gym for an hour,"
said Sarah Fandell. one of two
TEAM organizers in Toyon.
"Those schools wouldn't have any
phys ed if we didn't go over there
— even though PE in schools is a
state requirement."

The idea is to do
what you want to
do,' Swezey said.

Fandell said that despite
Toyon's "overwhelming response"
to the program, "it hasn't always
gone smoothly." Organizers con
stantly face the challenge of get

ting consistent commitments out
of students who volunteer, she ex
plained.
Swezey also cited a food pro
gram and horseback riding for
handicapped children in Los Altos
Hills as examples of student ideas
that were realized.
"The idea is to do what you want
to do." Swezey said.
The five members of a Jenkins
suite "did what they wanted to do"
when they established the Food
Closet Campus Connection. They
coupled a need for food in the
community with a source of food
in their eating club. Avanti. and
soon developed "a well-oiled pro
gram." according to Dave Kazan
jian. a co-founder of the program.
As part of the program, "After
every meal, instead of dumping
food out. the hashers dump it in
containers," he said.
Each afternoon, one of the suite
members drives food gathered

from lunch and the previous day's
dinner to the Food Closet. Total
trip time is only half an hour.
Kazanjian said Avanti also
benefits from the program be
cause students involved "are sen
sitized to the fact that a lot food is
wasted."
Kazanjian said that the Volun
teer Network "has helped us meet
with other places to bring the
food." The network has been
"really encouraging" and "a good
resource." he added.
The Volunteer Network's em
phasis on student innovation is
part of the Public Service Center's
effort to "meet people where they
are." Swezey said. By defining
public service in broad terms, the
Service Center hopes to appeal to
many groups of students. The
idea is that public and community
service can become an integral
part of each student's life at Stan
ford and beyond.

The staff is planning some in
novations of its own for next year.
A restructured board of directors
will include a community service
representative coordinator, an of
fice manager, a special projects di
rector. a group projects director
and a finance director.
Next year's office manager will
be responsible for writing a new
monthly network newsletter to
publicize various volunteer pro
grams.
Also new will be the positions of
area directors, created this quar
ter by the network. There will be
an area director for each of these
eight housing clusters: Florence
Moore. Wilbur, Stern. Governor's
Corner, the Row. Toyon/Branner.
Roble/Lagunita and Mirrie
lees/Manzanita/Crothers. The
network's aim is to promote the
organization of projects that one
dorm might not be able to do on
its own.
