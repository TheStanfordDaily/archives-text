## Murphy scores in 'Beverly Hills' once again 
### KAI KEASEY 
If you can't do well in one thing,
go back to something that you can
do well. That must have been
Eddie Murphy's thought after his
unsuccessful and out-of-place role
in"The Golden Child." He suc
cessfully returns to the role of Axel
Foley in "Beverly Hills Cop II,"
which is as good as the original.
Axel Foley is once again the self
confident and cocky detective who
oversteps regular bounds and al
ways irritates his superiors. Billy
Rosewood (Judge Reinhold) is
back to regret the politics of the
Beverly Hills detective force and
retain his almost fanatical devo
tion to Axel. Sergeant Taggert
(Eric Novak) returns as a reluctant
cohort, and adds to the threesome
with his elderly teddy-bear face
and his consistent panda-bear
shape.
This lovable trio must do battle
with a much more professional
threat than the Victor Matlin
drug-trafficking ring. The writers
must have been studying politics

recently, because the villains this
time are dealing arms to Costa
Rica. Unfortunately, the dealers
are not the government, so they
must commit large-scale crimes

(not including ordering sushi and
not paying) to raise enough capi
tal for their dastardly deeds. The
casting agency has come up with
another foreign actor to master
mind this crime ring. As the vil
lain. Jurgen Prochnow (who also
played the German captain in
"Das Boot") does a good job of
making the audience hate him
and at being a nasty, heartless
leader who demands Nazi-like per
fection and devotion.
Picked as his main (wo)man to
carry out the crimes is Brigitte
Nellsen, who shows how diverse
an actress she is by playing the de
manding leader of a commando
team that commits the "alphabet
crimes." I'm not sure if she has
said more than 100 words in all of
her previous movie roles
combined.
The plot begins with the near
fatal shooting of Lieutenant
Bogenville (Jason Bailey), who is
now good buddies with Axel and
has turned down a fishing trip
with him to do detective work on
the "alphabet crimes." Axel learns

of the shooting and goes to Beverly
Hills to solve the crime. He teams
with Taggert and Rosewood, who
have gone undercover because
they don't obey the rule of the poli
tically influenced police chief.
Even though they are working to
gether. Axel comes up with all the
leads and ideas to solve the crime.
Once again Axel bamboozles
people into helping him by invent
ing new characters and ad-libbing
constantly. The different roles he
pops into throughout the movie
include a Beverly Hills building in
spector, a messenger who delivers
a sound-sensitive bomb, a Carib
bean psychic, an FBI investigator,
a pool cleaner and a Beverly Hills
parking enforcer. Murphy's ability
to ad-lib is obviously his forte, and
those parts were some of the fun
niest in the movie.
Murphy is once again the star,
but Judge Reinhold is a close
second. Not only does he show his
concern for Taggert and his devo
tion to Axel, but we also see a dif
ferent side of him in the film.
Reinhold's character is serious
one minute, spacey the next.

There was no Serge in this ver
sion, but Gilbert Gottfried, a com
edian often seen on David Letter
man and featured in MTV's
"Amuck in America," shows up as

an accountant and peppers the
scene with his funny, blabber
mouth style of comedy.
The movie is not without prob
lems. The final fight scene, in
which the three heroes battle at
least 50 professional soldiers, is a
little hard to believe and a little
predictable, but what keeps it in
teresting is the constant jux
taposition of predictable fight
scenes and funny character moves
that Rosewood. Taggert and Foley
perform. It is hard to describe it all
without giving the ending away.
Another fault occurs throughout
the detection process. Some of the
leads are shaky and poorly defined
to the audience. However, it still
flows well and things were ade
quately explained in the end.
There are also the expected car
chases, but these have interesting
twists to them and don't drag on.
Admittedly there are defects,
and the villains are one
dimensional antagonists, but
these flaws are outweighed by
Murphy's characters and the con
stantly funny banter between the
three leads.
