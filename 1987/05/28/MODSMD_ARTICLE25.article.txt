Handel:
Concerti Grossi, Op 6. Nos 9-12
Trevor Pinnock and the English Concert
(Archive 410 899-2)
If George Frederic Handel and authen
tic instruments are two things that you
have heard about but never heard, then
buy this disc. Authentic (or period) in
struments have become a battleground
for many performers of baroque and now
classical repertoire. A mere decade or two
ago many symphony orchestras would
still have performed the Bach
"Brandenburg" concertos with a full
string section and modern woodwinds
and horns.
Since that time, however, there has
been an effort by much of the musical
community to match the work with the
instruments for which it was written; for
Bach and Handel that means baroque
violins, wooden woodwinds, valveless
horns and harpsichords. In many cases
this drastically changes the conception of
the piece and many people do not want to
give up their lush "Messiah" and their
piano "Well-tempered Clavier." But this
movement is popular both on disc and in
the concert hall (most of the
"Brandenburg" and "Messiah" compact
discs now include "original instru
ments.") Leaving the debate aside for
now, this is a good disc to introduce lis
teners to the more sparse, but clear
sounds of the baroque orchestra.
Handel was the most international of
the great baroque composers. He
borrowed both styles and forms from Ger
many, Italy, France and England (his
oratorios are in English) and created an
original and unique style of his own. His
inventive melodies and light entertaining
fugues are quite different from the
seriousness of Bach, and these "Grand
Concertos" show him at the height of his

powers. The 12 concertos of Opus 6 were
written in less than a month (about two
days for each) and were written to go be
tween the acts of his oratorios, for which
he is most famous.
These recordings with Trevor Pinnock
and the English Concert are played well
and are expertly recorded. Pinnock takes
his usual vigorous approach to both
tempo and style and the result is an ex
pressive performance without any of the
flatness or abrasiveness often associated
with authentic instruments. The balance
and the solo playing are exceptional
throughout, and we recommend any of
the three discs which make up this set.
If you want all 12 concertos but don't
care about the original instruments then
the Academy of Saint-Martins-in-the-
Fields* recording with lona Brown is the
best (Philips 410 048-2, 3 discs).

Prokofiev:
Symphony No. 6
Neeme Jarvi and the Scottish National
Orchestra (Chandos 8359)
If you are looking for something new
and different, here is a beautiful record
ing of a lesser-known Prokofiev sym
phony. Prokofiev is one of the more

popular 20th-century composers and is
known mostly for his Fifth Symphony,
the ballet "Romeo and Juliet" and "Peter
and the Wolf' (which has been recorded
with such narrators as David Bowie, Dud
ley Moore and William F. Buckley). The
Sixth is a little more difficult than the
Fifth, and is an intense and grand work
that comes from a difficult period of
Prokofiev's life. He had suffered a serious
concussion after the premiere of the Fifth
Symphony and could only work for two
half-hours each day. It took him two years
to finish this work.
Also on this disc, and by no means
merely a filler, is the other half of the
"Waltz Suite Op. 110," which appears
with the excellent Chandos recording of
the Fifth Symphony (CHAN 8450). The
Waltzes have various origins. Two are
from the ballet "Cinderella," and"In The
Palace No. 2" (actually the waltz from the
ballroom scene) is in itself worth the price
of this disc.
The performance is controlled and well
balanced with just the right amount of in
tensity: a very satisfying reading, ren
dered in the great sound we have come to
expect from Chandos. Chandos discs cost
a bit more than others, but few other
companies today are producing such con
sistently high-quality recordings. The
disc has 56 minutes of music that may
bring you to stand in front of the mirror
and pretend you're the conductor.
Beethoven:
Piano Trios, Archduke and Ghost
Beaux Arts Trio (Philips 412 891-2)
Our last two recommendations are ex
cellent buys of great music. In both cases,
equally good recordings of these selec

tions are available, but here is an oppor
tunity to get the same music on fewer
discs.
Both of these piano trios were written
as Beethoven's deafness was steadily
growing worse (during his "middle per
iod"). As the Opus 70 No. 1 trio, "The
Ghost" is so named because of the
tremolo effect in the piano. It was written
in 1808. Opus 97, "The Archduke," was
dedicated to Rudolph Johann Joseph
Rainer, Archduke of Austria, in 1811.
"The Archduke" was the last piano trio
Beethoven composed.
Although "The Ghost" is slightly more
powerful, both performances are excel
lent. The Beaux Arts Trio's playing is
sensitive, warm and attentive to detail.
They seem to read each others minds and
the playing could not be more accurate or
more unified.

The recordings were made two years
apart, so one is digital and the other
analog, but there is very little difference
between them. The digital recording of
"The Ghost" has a slightly clearer piano,
but also seems a little too close: both re
cordings are very realistic and natural
sounding. The analog is actually a little

better in this regard. While the Ash
kenazy/Perlman/Harell version of "The
Archduke" is excellent, what you get here
is two for one: both trios for 72 minutes of
music on one CD.
Dvorak:
Symphonies 7, 8 and 9 â€” "New World"
Neville Marriner and the Minnesota Or
chestra (Philips 412 542-2)
With many excellent recordings of all
three of these symphonies available
seperately, it would seem unlikely that a
set could have three performances that all
match up with the competition, but that
is exactly what this set does. All three per
formances are fresh and vigorous, and
Neville Marriner's reading of the Ninth is
especially exciting. It is a very dramatic
reading that is electrifying but never
rushed. In this symphony, the brass is es
pecially vivid and well-balanced, and the
playing is stunning.
In all but the last movement of the
Eighth one could not ask for a more en
gaging reading. The finale is also fresh
and lyrical, but the brass and the tempo
seem held back just a little at several
points in the beginning and at the end. In
the final fanfare, the trumpets over
shadow the trombones a bit (unlike the
classic George Szell, Cleveland Orchestra
version that needs to be reissued on CD).
Although a terrific set in all, our one
warning would have to go to those whose
favorite movement is the finale of the
Eighth. We will let you know when a bet
ter recording of it comes out.
The entire set is beautifully played by
the Minnesota Orchestra and recorded in
stunning Philips sound: exceptionally
rich and natural sounding strings and
brass. Because it is a set, you can buy all
three symphonies on only two discs for
two full hours of music.
And just when you were wondering how
far you would have to travel to buy all
these wonderful CDs. the Stanford
Bookstore has come to the rescue by
stocking most of them.
