# 'Amedee': Insanity and absurdity in the Nitery
## 
### JAMES DICKEY Editorial staff 
"Life imitates art." Hopefully this is not true in the
case of "Amedee (or How To Get Rid Of It).'"
This comic farce, written by Eugene lonesco and
directed by Simone Genatt in the Stanford Depart
ment of Drama production in the Nitery, is one of the
most insane treatments of domestic life ever to be
presented on the stage.
The comedy of "Amedee" is one that grows and
develops simultaneously with the plot. As the main
characters, Amedee and Madeleine, relate to each
other, their insanity and absurdity result in barbed
stabs at human nature in general. The progression
of the plot works well with the satire that is shown in
the actions and statements of the couple.
The majority of the play centers around Amedee
and Madeleine, and this possible gamble pays off. As
Madeleine, Shannon Jackson is perfect as the nag
ging, constantly vacillating wife of Amedee. Brennan
Pursell is equally good in his role as Amedee, an un
inspired intellectual wimp.
Together the two are excellent as semicompatible
lunatics, between barbed silences and arguments as
dizzying in their content as they are in their speed.
The basic premise of the play reveals the comedy
and absurdity of the situation: Amedee and
Madeleine have to cope with the constantly growing

body of a man in their bedroom, whom Amedee may
or may not have killed 10 years earlier.
Accordingly, the work is difficult to understand or
relate to at times, and the best attitude with which to
view the play is one of complete abandonment and
lightheartedness (or lightheadedness).
Quite late in the play, several other characters are
introduced â€” some appear for only five minutes or
so. Among these "extras" are the notable Young
Amedee and Young Madeleine, played by Chris Hart
and Anne Kauffman, respectively. Hart is superb as
Young Amedee, and the scene where the young and
old characters join together is a triumph for writer
lonesco. The set and props work well with the story,
and the legs and feet of "It" have to be seen to be truly
appreciated.
The play, in two parts with an intermission, lasts
less than two hours and runs tonight through Satur
day at 8 p.m. and Sunday at 2 p.m. in the Nitery.
