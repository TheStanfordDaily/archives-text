## Card hopes high for World Series 
### CHRIS MYERS Editorial staff 
Stanford Coach Mark Marquess
couldn't have planned It better
himself.
As his No. 2-ranked Stanford
Cardinal packs Its gloves and bats
for a trip to the College World Se
ries In Omaha, the team is playing
hotter than it has all season.
"If you had to plan it out, this is
the way you'd do it — we'd be
playing the way we are right now,"
Marquess said. "I think we're
playing our best baseball right
now, which is very important."
Stanford is slated to begin play
Saturday night against Georgia,
and Marquess has to be acutely
aware of a team's need to peak at
the right time. Two years ago, the
Cardinal entered the 1985 Series
as the top-ranked team in the
country and the favorite to win the
national title. But the team came
out flat, got squashed by the
Miami Hurricanes in its opener,
19-3, and was eliminated a few
days later by Arkansas.
This year, the team has a differ
ent mind-set going into the Se
ries, according to holdovers from
that 1985 team.
"Two years ago, 1 think we were
real happy to be there and I'm not
sure if we were concentrating on
winning the thing," senior left
fielder Ruben Amaro said.
"No one ever really talked about
winning it (in 1985)," said junior
Jack McDowell, who provided one
of the few bright spots in the 1985

Series with a second-game victory
over Arizona. He will go against
Georgia in the opener this time.
"This year we really have a goal to
go out and win it."
Perhaps center fielder Toi Cook,
who played rightfield on the 1985
squad, expressed the mood of the
current team best: "I don't want to
go to the Series and mess around
and come back early." he said.
Both Marquess and his players
like the Cardinal's chances to
spend a long time in Omaha.
"1 think we have an outstanding
chance (in the Series)," Marquess
said. "We're swinging the bat
well. . . . Our pitching staff has
good depth . . . and everybody is
fairly healthy."
The team's pitching depth and
the recent offensive surge by a few
players who struggled all season
bode well for the World Series, ac
cording to Amaro.
Two players who came on par
ticularly strong in regional compe
tition last weekend were junior
catcher Doug Robbins and sopho
more second baseman Frank
Carey. Robbins had a tough time
late in the year, ending the regular
season with a .273 batting
average, down from .327 last year.
He exploded in the regionals.
however, going seven for 16 (.438)
with two giant home runs
(equaling his homer output for
the entire regular season), two
doubles, five RBIs and eight runs,
as well as several sterling defen
sive plays at the plate.
Frank Carey, meanwhile, sud

denly began sending screaming
line drives all over Sunken Dia
mond the last couple weeks and
batted .500 in the regionals.
Certainly Robbins and Carey
aren't the only hot hitters on the
team — the Cardinal batted .391
as a team during the regionals.
But with Robbins and Carey,
along with senior shortstop David
Esquer, hitting so well at the
bottom of the Stanford order and
Amaro, Cook, sophomore Ed
Sprague and freshman Paul Carey

continuing their reign of terror at
the top. opposing pitchers simply
have nowhere to hide.
But according to Marquess, the
number of hits has been less im
portant than their timeliness.
"This team has been the best at
getting the big hit — timely hit
ting," he said.
The team also has a top-to
bottom balance that Marquess
likes.
"I've had teams with more
speed, and teams with more

power, and better defensive
teams, but this team has a little
bit of everything," he said.
"It's not the most talented team
I've had, but I think it's the best
team, the best coming together of
all their abilities."
The players concur with that
judgment."We're a really close
knit group this year," Amaro said.
"I think that's going to help us."
"This is as much of a team as
I've ever played on," Esquer said.

The College World Series
presents some unique challenges
to a team, but according to
Marquess, his players are
prepared.
"(The World Series) is different;
there's a lot more media, and all
the games are televised on ESPN,
and it's new to a some of your
players," he said. "But the juniors
and seniors have been there
before, so that's an advantage —
they can help the younger players
who haven't been there before."
