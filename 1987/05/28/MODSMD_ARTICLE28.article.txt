# Sailing team takes sixth at Nationals
## 
### HUGH R. BETHELL Editorial staff 
KINGS POINT. N.Y. - With wins
against East Coast rival Harvard
and West Coast rival Washington,
the Stanford sailing team ended
its 1986-87 season with a sixth
place finish at the Team Racing
National Championships this past
weekend here on the waters of
Long Island Sound.
At times, the Cardinal seemed
like the team to beat at the
regatta, as it amassed impressive
victories against Harvard. Wash
ington, Wisconsin, Texas and
Brown. Unfortunately for the
Stanford sailors, two close defeats
dropped them out of a tie for
fourth.
In the second race of the series,
Stanford earned an impressive
win over Brown, as the Cardinal
sailors came back in the last
seconds of the race to pass the
leading two boats and win the
race.
Later, however. Stanford lost its
race against Michigan on a ques
tionable protest decision, and lost
to UC-Irvine by the slimmest mar
gin possible in team racing — just
3/4 of a point.
Irvine, the only other team that
qualified for the Nationals from
the Pacific Coast Region, finished
fifth as a result of that victory. The
regatta was won by Navy, while
the U.S. Merchant Marine
Academy placed second, above
third-place Tulane and fourth
place College of Charleston.
Although the Stanford sailors
were somewhat disappointed by

their final placing in the regatta,
the team was proud to have
finished in the top 10 nationally
for the second time this season.
Last fall, members of the team
placed fourth at the Sloop Racing
National Championship.
"It was frustrating not to finish
in the top five, but all-in-all, we
sailed a fairly solid regatta. We
beat Harvard and Brown convinc
ingly, and they had beaten the
best teams in New England just to
get to Nationals," Stanford Coach
Blake Middleton said.
For Stanford to get to Nationals,
the team had to beat the best in
California — including California
and USC — at the Pacific Coast
Championships earlier this
spring. Team members also had to
endure a red-eye cross-country
trip on Friday night that left them
with jet-lag drowsiness for the
four days they were here in Kings
Point.
Fortunately, a lack of breeze
that postponed the start of racing
until Sunday evening gave the
team a chance to rest. Jet-lag
proved to be less of a problem than
the team's unfamiliarity with the
420-class sailboats that were used
for the competition. Sailboats of
the 420-class are rarely sailed west
of the Mississippi, and the Card
inal had little practice in the boats
before this weekend.
Sailing for Stanford were senior
Tom Kuhnle and sophomore Rita
Snape, junior Drew Gashler and
senior Kristen Boyles. juniors Dan
Buckstaff and Kathleen Mallery,
and sophomore Ev Rend and
junior Gina Ottoboni.
