What can you do?
That's what Stanford
Women's Golf Coach Tim
Baldwin had to be saying after
the first round of the NCAA
championships in Albuquer
que. New Mexico.
In NCAA women's golf, a
team counting one 77 as its
worst score of the day has
usually had an excellent round.
That's the kind of day the Card
inal had on the par 73, 6.200-
yard South Course at the Uni
versity of New Mexico. Stanford
shot an opening-round 303,
but still found itself 12th out of
17 teams in the battle for the
national title.
The reason: No less than 11
teams shot rounds of 300 or
below. Duke leads the tourna
ment with a phenomenal 289.
Miami of Florida and Florida
each are at 291. Oklahoma
State shot 293 and stands in
fourth place. San Jose State is
fifth at 294. Two Pacific 10
Conference teams. USC and
Arizona State, are next with
identical 2975.
"We played very well as a
team, and I felt pretty satisfied
coming off the course. When I
saw the scores posted on the

board, I couldn't believe it,"
Baldwin commented.
"There are some great golf
teams here who played to their
fullest potential," she said.
Individually, the race
couldn't be any tighter. Evelyn
Orley of Duke leads with an
opening-round 68. A stroke
back is Florida's Karen Davies.
Lois Ledbetter of Alabama and
Michelle Michanowicz of Miami
each carded 70. Six players
shot 71. Among them are ASU's
highly touted Danielle Ammac
capane, Duke's Jackie Orley —
sister of Evelyn — and defend
ing national champion Page
Dunlap of Florida.
The top Cardinal after one
round of play is senior Kathleen
McCarthy, who fired a 74 yes
terday to trail by six shots.
Junior Trish McGonigle and
senior Adrienne Gilmartin each
posted 76. while junior Kay
Cornelius and sophomore Clare
Dolan each shot 77.
Despite being buried in 12th
after his team's fine opening
round, Baldwin is confident
that not all has been decided.
"I do feel that we'll improve
our position over the next few
days. In fact, there will be
several teams who will drasti
cally change their positions."
he said.
