# Admissions numbers: waiting list admits up

### ANN MARSH Staff writer 
Stanford has offered admission to 90
wait-listed applicants to the Class of 1991,
according to Dean of Undergraduate Admis
sions Jean Fetter.
Also, only 35 percent of students ad
mitted to the Jordan Scholars program
have decided to come to Stanford, said
John Bunnell, director of freshman admis
sions.
Stanford admissions officers created the
Jordan program this year in an attempt to
attract unusually well-qualified freshman
applicants.
"Obviously, they were highly sought-after
people," he said. "Maybe if we hadn't had
the program we would have had a 20 per
cent yield and not 35 percent."
In April, the Admissions Office accepted
2,474 students, approximately 15 percent
of the 16,883 applicants, the second-largest
applicant pool in Stanford history.
The number of students offered admis

slon from the wait list this year has in
creased markedly from the relatively few
wait-list offers in 1984 and 1986 but is
comparable to the 80 wait-list students of
fered admission in 1985.
However, admissions officers said direct
comparison is difficult because fewer stu
dents were offered admission this year from
the general applicant pool.
Stanford offered admission to 50 fewer
students than last year. "I estimated
ultraconservatively with the yield," Bunnell
said. "I decided it would be much better to
go to the wait list than have another class of
1,600-plus."
According to Bunnell, about 25 of the 90
wait-listed students have already indicated
they will attend. The deadline for wait-list
responses is June 1.
"We expect a very high return on the wait
list." Bunnell said. A high yield on the wait
list would bring the overall yield for the in
coming class to just over 60 percent, he
