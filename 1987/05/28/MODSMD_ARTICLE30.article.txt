# IRS clarifies scholarship tax
## 
### STEPHEN KASIERSKI Senior staff writer 
The Internal Revenue Service
has issued guidelines that clarify
Stanford's responsibility in imple
menting new rules affecting the
liability of graduate scholarships
and fellowships.
The Tax Reform Act of 1986
limits tax exemptions for scholar
ships awarded to graduate stu
dents to directly related expenses
such as fees, books and supplies.
The reform provisions also tax

the portion of research assistant
and teaching assistant stipends
that are classified as
"compensation for services per
formed."
But the act also provides transi
tion language that allows awards
made prior to August 17, 1986 to
be treated under the previous, less
stringent rules. The recent IRS
clarification is "in a sense, a vic
tory for the student," according to
Christopher Canellos of the Uni
versity Controller's Office.
Students and administrators

were concerned that portions of
awards that were to be applied in
the y p ars after the award date may
be taxable under the reform provi
sions.
But the clarifications enable
awards for pei !ods exceeding one
academic quarter and granted
before the August date to be sub
ject to the old rules.
Any grant amounts recieved by
students exceeding the amount
specified in the initial academic
period of the award will continue
to be subject to the new rules.
