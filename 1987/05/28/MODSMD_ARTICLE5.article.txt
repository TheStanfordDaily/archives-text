# One of a dozen will get Reagan Library
## 
### MARK LAWRENCE Senior staff writer 
UC-Riverside and President
Reagan's alma mater. Eureka Col
lege in Illinois, are the latest
entrants in the competition for
the Reagan Library.
The schools join about a dozen
other proposed sites that will be
considered by the Ronald Reagan
Presidential Foundation, the
Washington-based organization
seeking a home for the library and
an adjacent public affairs center,
according to Foundation Director
Gary Jones.
The foundation's board of trus
tees will meet in mid-June to dis
cuss the proposed sites, but
Jones, a trustee, said the board
will probably not make a final
decision until later in the year.

The trustees will not comment on
the selection process until a final
choice Is made, he said.
But Jones would reaffirm that
the foundation is primarily inter
ested in sites in Southern Califor
nia — not in Eureka or proposed
sites in other areas. "I would not
expect the library to be located
outside the Southern California
regional framework," Jones said.
Pepperdine. USC, UCLA. UC-
Irvine, UC-Santa Barbara, Oc
cidental, Claremont and several
unidentified private landholders
have also expressed interest in the
library during the month since
the foundation withdrew its plan
to build the library at Stanford.
Jones and Hoover Senior Fellow
Martin Anderson, a foundation
trustee, would not say which

schools have made formal
proposals.
"Anybody who's Interested is
talking to the Reagan Founda
tion," said Anderson, a former do
mestic policy adviser to Reagan.
"There will be a lot of back-and
forth and looking at sites for quite
some time." He said the founda
tion hopes to settle on a location
"as soon as possible."
Despite Reagan's publicized
desire that the library and public
affairs center be located in South
ern California, the Eureka board
of trustees last week sent a letter
to the Reagan Foundation saying
that the college would be an ideal
place to locate the library, said
Eureka President George Hearne.
"Our position has been one of
close relationship with the Reagan
administration," Hearne said.

"This Is his home. This is his
native state." Reagan graduated
from the college in 1932.
Hearne said Eureka, despite
having only 460 students and no
graduate programs, is located
near other institutions that would
make heavy use of the library.
Eureka is about a two hours' drive
from both Chicago and the Uni
versity of Illinois. he said.
Moreover, Eureka's faculty and
students are eager to have the li
brary, said Hearne, asserting that
if Eureka were given the library
there would be none of the contro
versy that contributed to the foun
dation's decision to withdraw the
library from Stanford.
"There is no indication of resis
tance to the library (among
Eureka faculty and students),"
Hearne said. "We share an ap

preciation of him as an alumnus
and see the importance of having
such a valuable resource here."
Stanford lost the library last
month when the Reagan Founda
tion trustees decided that the
public affairs center must be lo
cated adjacent to the library. The
Stanford Board of Trustees in
1983 had accepted the library but
would not approve construction of
the public affairs center on Stan
ford land under conditions pro
posed by the foundation and the
Hoover Institution.
The foundation's decision came
in the wake of growing faculty and
student opposition to the library,
and many believe that the founda
tion decided to move the library
elsewhere in order to avoid a loud
public debate.
Jack Chappell, director of Uni
versity relations at UC-Rlverside,
said the library and public affairs
center would encounter little con
troversy if they came to that
campus. He said university admi
nistrators who conducted inter
views with faculty members to
gauge faculty opinion on the mat

ter found little resistance.
"The faculty are very indepen
dent and very outspoken," he
said. "But those who I've talked
with say they regard any presiden
tial library as a public trea
sure. . . . The opportunity to have
that on your very doorstep means
that the scholarship that would be
generated here would be ac
celerated."
He said the UC-Riverside aca
demic senate will discuss the mat
ter further in upcoming meetings.
"We don't want members of our

faculty to go away for the summer
and come back to find they have a
presidential library," Chappell
said.
Since sending a letter to the
Reagan Foundation expressing in
terest in the library, the university
has assembled two committees de
signed both to show the founda
tion that influential people sup
port UC-Riverside's bid and to act
as an intermediary between the
foundation and the university if it
is selected, Chappell said. One
committee consists of prominent

local citizens and the other of local
officials, he said.
The Riverside campus would be
the ideal home for the library,
Chappell said, because of its ac
cessibility to major highways and
airports, its location in a major
population center and its prox
imity to Reagan's friends in Palm
Springs, The campus would also
be a good home for the library and
public affairs center, Chappell
said, because it has several large
undeveloped plots of land that
could be used for the facilities.

lege in Illinois, are the latest
entrants in the competition for
the Reagan Library.
The schools join about a dozen
other proposed sites that will be
considered by the Ronald Reagan
Presidential Foundation, the
Washington-based organization
seeking a home for the library and
an adjacent public affairs center,
according to Foundation Director
Gary Jones.
The foundation's board of trus
tees will meet in mid-June to dis
cuss the proposed sites, but
Jones, a trustee, said the board
will probably not make a final
decision until later in the year.

The trustees will not comment on
the selection process until a final
choice Is made, he said.
But Jones would reaffirm that
the foundation is primarily inter
ested in sites in Southern Califor
nia — not in Eureka or proposed
sites in other areas. "I would not
expect the library to be located
outside the Southern California
regional framework," Jones said.
Pepperdine. USC, UCLA. UC-
Irvine, UC-Santa Barbara, Oc
cidental, Claremont and several
unidentified private landholders
have also expressed interest in the
library during the month since
the foundation withdrew its plan
to build the library at Stanford.
Jones and Hoover Senior Fellow
Martin Anderson, a foundation
trustee, would not say which

schools have made formal
proposals.
"Anybody who's Interested is
talking to the Reagan Founda
tion," said Anderson, a former do
mestic policy adviser to Reagan.
"There will be a lot of back-and
forth and looking at sites for quite
some time." He said the founda
tion hopes to settle on a location
"as soon as possible."
Despite Reagan's publicized
desire that the library and public
affairs center be located in South
ern California, the Eureka board
of trustees last week sent a letter
to the Reagan Foundation saying
that the college would be an ideal
place to locate the library, said
Eureka President George Hearne.
"Our position has been one of
close relationship with the Reagan
administration," Hearne said.

"This Is his home. This is his
native state." Reagan graduated
from the college in 1932.
Hearne said Eureka, despite
having only 460 students and no
graduate programs, is located
near other institutions that would
make heavy use of the library.
Eureka is about a two hours' drive
from both Chicago and the Uni
versity of Illinois. he said.
Moreover, Eureka's faculty and
students are eager to have the li
brary, said Hearne, asserting that
if Eureka were given the library
there would be none of the contro
versy that contributed to the foun
dation's decision to withdraw the
library from Stanford.
"There is no indication of resis
tance to the library (among
Eureka faculty and students),"
Hearne said. "We share an ap

preciation of him as an alumnus
and see the importance of having
such a valuable resource here."
Stanford lost the library last
month when the Reagan Founda
tion trustees decided that the
public affairs center must be lo
cated adjacent to the library. The
Stanford Board of Trustees in
1983 had accepted the library but
would not approve construction of
the public affairs center on Stan
ford land under conditions pro
posed by the foundation and the
Hoover Institution.
The foundation's decision came
in the wake of growing faculty and
student opposition to the library,
and many believe that the founda
tion decided to move the library
elsewhere in order to avoid a loud
public debate.
Jack Chappell, director of Uni
versity relations at UC-Rlverside,
said the library and public affairs
center would encounter little con
troversy if they came to that
campus. He said university admi
nistrators who conducted inter
views with faculty members to
gauge faculty opinion on the mat

ter found little resistance.
"The faculty are very indepen
dent and very outspoken," he
said. "But those who I've talked
with say they regard any presiden
tial library as a public trea
sure. . . . The opportunity to have
that on your very doorstep means
that the scholarship that would be
generated here would be ac
celerated."
He said the UC-Riverside aca
demic senate will discuss the mat
ter further in upcoming meetings.
"We don't want members of our

faculty to go away for the summer
and come back to find they have a
presidential library," Chappell
said.
Since sending a letter to the
Reagan Foundation expressing in
terest in the library, the university
has assembled two committees de
signed both to show the founda
tion that influential people sup
port UC-Riverside's bid and to act
as an intermediary between the
foundation and the university if it
is selected, Chappell said. One
committee consists of prominent

local citizens and the other of local
officials, he said.
The Riverside campus would be
the ideal home for the library,
Chappell said, because of its ac
cessibility to major highways and
airports, its location in a major
population center and its prox
imity to Reagan's friends in Palm
Springs, The campus would also
be a good home for the library and
public affairs center, Chappell
said, because it has several large
undeveloped plots of land that
could be used for the facilities.
