# Institutions give to the Centennial fund
## 
### STEPHEN KASIERSKI Senior staff writer 
This is the third of a four-part se
ries on the Stanford Centennial
Campaign.

The backbone of University
fund raising doesn't necessarily
come from rich alumni.
When Stanford looks for dona
tions to the *1.1 billion Centen
nial Campaign, University fund
raisers hope to capitalize on a long
tradition of corporate and founda
tion giving.
Although huge donations from
Individuals usually grab the
headlines, foundations and corpo
rations typically provide about
half the University's gift income.
Contributions from corporations
and foundations totaled over *70

million of Stanford's $179 million
gift and grant income last year.
The University Development Of
fice has estimated that corpora
tions and foundations will con
tribute $435 million during the
five-year campaign.
In a sense, the small Develop
ment staff devoted to corporate
and foundation giving functions
as a "marriage broker," developing
and maintaining often long
standing relationships between
University faculty and various
philanthropic organizations, ac
cording to Larry Lollar. director of
foundation and corporate rela
tions.
"Our staff is bolstered by the
constant efforts of all the faculty
and deans (and) all of their on
going contacts and ties," he said.
"One of our missions is to keep
these relationships ongoing and
to keep those program dollars . . .
that aren't specifically in the cam
paign objectives coming In."
Foundations that have been
long-time contributors to Stan
ford include the Irvine. Hewlett
and Ford foundations as well as
the Carnegie Corporation.
Federal tax law requires all
private foundations to give away
at least 5 percent of their asset
value every year. As assets grow,
foundations are often encouraged
to develop new programs to dis
tribute their burgeoning assets.
Foundation gifts are always in

cash, while corporations are able
to obtain tax credits for donations
of scientific equipment.
When soliciting from corpora
tions, the University often walks a
fine line between maintaining
academic freedom and bowing to
outside pressures, but Lollar said
strict fund-raising guidelines con
trol "what we can and cannot
promise them."
"We are very careful to try to
avoid doing what a corporation
wants us to do if it's not what the
University already wants to do,"
Lollar said, adding that Stanford
has turned down gifts from
donors who wanted to "tie in too
closely" or wanted "more control
over the academic process than
was necessary."
Development staffers try to es
tablish new and closer contacts
with company and foundation ex

ecutives to solicit their support,
Lollar said.
"We try to get them interested in
a small way at first, and then
gradually increase the relation
ship until they are very involved
with the University," he said. "We
feel that the University sells itself.
Once we get somebody here (and)
involved, they get excited by the
students, the atmosphere and the
research."
Stanford maintains a list of its
"best clients," corporations that
have contributed to the University
in the past, Lollar said. These cor
porations are "almost always"
research-intensive, he said.
"For the campaign, we're trying
to get some corporations that are
research-intensive (and) long
term friends to make a special gift
over and above their ongoing sup
port."

The fund-raising effort has also
been promoted by University Pres
ident Donald Kennedy, who has
stepped up his schedule of visits
with corporate chief executives
over the last two years, said Rich
ard Bennett, associate campaign
director.
Development officers also ask a
foundation or corporation if their
particular interests could be
"channeled" into a specific cam
paign objective, such as the $250
million Near West Campus science
and engineering development.
Stanford also gets money from
corporations who want to support
research here. However, if corpor
ate donors want to maintain
"intellectual property rights" or di
rectly benefit from Stanford re
search, they must make specific
legal arrangements with the Uni
versity Sponsored Projects office.
