### JOHN POLLACK Senior staff writer 
While the black balloons released at the
Cornerstone Celebration have long since
drifted away, the issue of racism at Stan
ford is still at the forefront of campus
debate.

News Analysis

Fueling this debate are the actions of
the Rainbow Agenda, a coalition of
campus minority groups and other stu
dents who have pushed the University Ad
ministration to address minority con
cerns on campus through protests, a sit
in and an open forum on racism.
Recent criticism of the Rainbow Agenda

has focused on the way in which it makes
"Immediate demands" on the University,
rather than promoting its ideas through
the standard administrative channels.
Bill King, Rainbow Agenda member and
chair of the Black Student Union (BSU),
responded to this criticism Tuesday at the
forum on racism at Stanford.
"We've been criticized for making im
mediate demands, but these are concerns
that have been voiced, requested and sug
gested for 20 years by faculty, staff, stu
dents and community members.'' King
said.
King was referring to similar demands
made in 1968 by the BSU following the as
sassination of Martin Luther King Jr.
In 1968 the BSU demanded, among
other things, that the University:

In 1968, the BSU demanded increased minority
enrollment and financial aid. Today, the Rainbow
Agenda is making similar demands that the Uni
versity improve minority life on campus.
□ increase minority enrollment;
□ actively recruit students from
economically depressed areas;
□ replace the vice provost for
minority group affairs with a full
time black administrator: and
□actively recruit and hire more
minority faculty members.
After negotiating with the BSU.
University President Wallace Ster
ling agreed to revised versions of
these and other demands. Regard
ing the demand for a full-time
black administrator to deal with
minority concerns. Sterling em
phasized that the administrator
hired would work with, and not
replace the vice provost.
Provost Richard Lyman, who
later became University president,
told the Faculty Senate at the time
that the agreement between the
Administration and the BSU
marked "the start of a new era" for
minorities at Stanford.
Today, the Rainbow Agenda
charges that these promises
remain largely unfulfilled, that

there are still too few minority stu
dents and faculty at Stanford.
"The reason they are immediate
demands is because nothing is
done about them. . . . You have to
demand if nobody is listening.
You can suggest if people are lis
tening." King said.
Critics of the Rainbow Agenda
have also questioned whether the
coalition is truly a "rainbow."
noting that the agenda does not
address issues of anti-semitism or
homophobia.
At Tuesday's forum, Stanford
student Vered Sharon said Jews
should be included in the Rain
bow Agenda because anti-
Semitism is a form of racism.
Andy Frisch, a member of the
Gay and Lesbian Alliance at Stan
ford (GLAS), also expressed disap
pointment concerning the
agenda's failure to address the
issue of homophobia at Stanford
and the discrimination homo
sexuals encounter here.
Frisch's criticism of the Rain
bow Agenda does not represent
the official position of GLAS. ac
cording to GLAS member Barbara
Voss.
"1 think that the people in the

Rainbow Agenda have been very
respectful toward homosexual
concerns," Voss said yesterday.
"We (the Stanford Organization
for Lesbian and Gay Equality) ba
sically feel that the Rainbow
Agenda is an anti-racist organiza
tion."
While King acknowledged that
Jews and homosexuals suffer dis
crimination. he defended the
Rainbow Agenda and its focus on
racism.
King said yesterday that while
the Rainbow Agenda will gladly
cooperate with such groups to end
other forms of discrimination, it
intends to maintain its focus on
racism.
A meeting between the Rainbow
Agenda and concerned members
of the Jewish and homosexual
communities has been scheduled
for Sunday to address this issue.
The Rainbow Agenda's decision
to focus its energies on a single
issue may or may not make it
more effective in its attempt to in
fluence University policy. How
ever. some critics will accuse it of
practicing the same discrimina
tion it seeks to eliminate.
