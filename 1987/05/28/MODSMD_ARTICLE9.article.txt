Reagan downplays Gulf role
WASHINGTON — President Reagan yesterday played down the
possibility of direct U.S. involvement in warfare in the Persian
Gulf, but senators of both parties warned that the country was
steadily being drawn into armed conflict with Iran that was likely
to result in attacks on American ships.
In an interview with six foreign journalists, the president
scoffed at warnings that Iran might attack Kuwaiti oil tankers in
the gulf flying the American flag. Reagan, who at one point
referred to Iran as "this barbaric country." said Iranian leaders
understood the "inevitable consequence" they would suffer if they
launched an attack.
But Sen. James Sasser, D-Tenn., who has just returned from
the region, said it's "just a matter of time" before an American
ship is attacked, and Sen. Richard Lugar. R-Ind., warned that
"the environment surrounding our Navy in the Persian Gulf is as
dangerous as the exposure of our Marines in Beirut."
Lugar and Sasser have called upon Reagan to invoke the War
Powers Resolution, requiring consultation with Congress if hos
tilities are deemed "imminent or likely." The administration has
taken the position that use of the War Powers Resolution is un
necessary, a position reiterated Wednesday by White House
spokesman Marlin Fitzwater.
In the interview, Reagan said U.S. warships will fire on Iranian
or other attackers but said the U.S. presence in the Persian Gulf
was designed to provide free navigation, not "daring someone to
do something." He refused to say if the United States would
retaliate against Iran if one of its ships is attacked.
Earlier, at a news conference in Brussels, Defense Secretary
Caspar Weinberger said the United States would protect "all ship
ping" in the gulf. A Weinberger deputy said the secretary had mis
spoke and had meant to exempt Iran and Iraq in discussing U.S.
military protection. Another Pentagon official said U.S. protection
will be for ships of friendly and non-belligerent nations.
North claimed Reagan support
WASHINGTON — The retired Air Force colonel who ran a private
airlift to the Nicaraguan rebels during the cutoff of U.S. military
support testified yesterday that Marine Lt. Col. Oliver North, then
a White House aide, assured him that "we were working for the
president of the United States."
"Bob, you're never going to get a medal for this, but some day
the president will shake your hand and thank you for it." retired
colonel Robert Dutton quoted North as saying last September.
About that time Dutton gave North a photograph album of the
Central American operation and North commented that he
wanted to show it to his "top boss."
"Who did you understand Col. North to be referring to when he
said he'd like to take the photograph album to his 'top boss ?"
asked Ken Ballen, a staff counsel for the House and Senate com
mittees whose hearings on the Iran-contra affair entered their
fourth week Wednesday.
"I understood he was talking about the president," Dutton
replied.
Dutton testified under a grant of limited immunity from prose
cution that he was in charge of the day-to-day operations of the se
cret private airlift under the co-command of North and retired Air
Force major general Richard Secord.
The airlift was set up in late 1985 when the contras, financed by
secret Saudi donations, needed logistical assistance to begin
fighting inside Nicaragua. During the next year, the North
directed airlift operation was financed by donations and funds
diverted from the sale of U.S. arms to Iran.
Bias called cocaine middleman
WASHINGTON — Prince George's County prosecutors said
Tuesday that basketball star Len Bias was "a courtesy mid
dleman" who passed cocaine from accused drug dealer Brian Lee
Tribble to teammates on the University of Maryland's College Park
campus.
Deputy State's Attorney Robert Bonsib said during the opening
day of testimony in Tribble's drug distribution trial that Bias pro
vided cocaine from Tribble to teammates Terry Long and David
Gregg "for recreational purposes." Bias died last June 19 after in
gesting cocaine allegedly supplied by Tribble.
Prosecutors said Tribble, Bias and Terrence Anthony Moore — a
17-year-old who is expected to testify for the prosecution about
Tribble's alleged drug network — were all part of a conspiracy to
distribute cocaine and all were members of what Assistant State's
Attorney Jeffrey Harding called "the secret world of cocaine
dealing."
Thomas Morrow. Tribble's attorney, and Wayne Curry, the Bias
family attorney, scoffed at the prosecution's assertion that Bias
was involved in a conspiracy to distribute cocaine.
FAA won't cut air travel
WASHINGTON — Despite a rise in air traffic controller errors
and reports of near collisions, the Federal Aviation Administra
tion yesterday rejected a call to cut air traffic during the peak sum
mer travel season.
In response to recommendations from the National Transporta
tion Safety Board that air traffic be reduced at busy airports to
ensure safety. FAA chief Donald Engen said that the reductions
are not needed because the FAA has the situation well in hand.
The FAA said its existing traffic control procedures "provide
more than an effective means of balancing demand with
capacity."
"We will not allow air traffic to exceed the bounds of safe opera
tion." Engen said, adding that the country's air control system is
moving more traffic more safely than at "any time in history."
NTSB Chairman Jim Burnett declined comment yesterday. He
is expected to respond to the FAA Thursday when he testifies
before the Senate Commerce. Science and Transportation Com
mittee.
Burnett made a personal plea for reductions in air traffic April
27. which was followed May 13 by formal recommendations from
the full board. Burnett said a rise in controller errors and near col
lisions. in the air and on runways, should be regarded as
"warning signs." These suggest, he said, an erosion of safety that
may accelerate with the increase in summer traffic and unpredic
table summer thunderstorms.
Expensive phone fraud grows
WASHINGTON — The 19-year-old American University fresh
man from New York turned to crime in the name of love. Last fall,
he applied his computer know-how to stealing long-distance tele
phone service so he could talk to his high-school sweetheart.
The student is among the swelling ranks of people involved in a
crime that is costing the long-distance industry at least *500 mil
lion a year. In an effort to combat the growing trend, some com
panies. such as MCI Communications Corp.. allow students and
other offenders a brief period to confess and pay up. rather than
face arrest.
The student from New York is a computer whiz who
programmed his personal computer to search for secret long
distance codes that callers dial to complete long-distance calls over
the networks of such companies as MCI. US Sprint and ITT Corp.
The codes allow people who travel, or who simply subscribe to
more than one long-distance service, to be billed later for the long
distance calls thev make.
