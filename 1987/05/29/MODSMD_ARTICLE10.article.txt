Tomorrow night, the Stanford nine will
take on the Georgia Bulldogs in the opening
round of the College World Series in Omaha,
Neb. The Cardinal, playing its best baseball
of the season after rampaging through last
week's West I Regional, is ranked second na
tionally by both Baseball America and ESPN
and has hopes of coming away with a na
tional title.
Coach Mark Marquess says this is "not the
most talented team I've had, but I think it's
the best team, the best coming together of all
their abilities." His praise may not be strong
enough. Consider that the Cardinal batted
.391 in the regionals and got timely hitting
from everyone. Consider that the team has
played stellar defense all year. Lastly, con
sider that Stanford's pitching may well be
the best in the country.
The staff is led by junior right-hander Jack
McDowell, who is certain to be one of the top
choices in the baseball draft June 2. Backing
him up are junior Lee Plemel, the breaking
ball specialist; senior southpaw A 1 Osuna;
sophomore Steve Chitren, the stopper out of

the bullpen; and several other talented hurl
ers.
Lately, though, the hitters have made it
easy on the pitchers. The Cardinal averaged
over 11 runs a game in the regionals. Oppos
ing pitchers have been unable to hide from a
batting order that features All-America can
didates Ruben Amaro and Toi Cook at the
top, and a devastating array of hitters follow
ing them. Do you pitch around Ed Sprague
to get to Paul Carey? Can you get Doug Rob
bins to chase a bad pitch? Get serious â€”
they're too good.
Stanford has made the trip to Omaha four
out of the last six years and has never won
more than one game in the double
elimination tournament. This year seems
like the time to put an end to that streak. The
College World Series challenges the mental
and physical toughness of a ballclub and this
year's team has clearly show it has the moxie
to win it all.
So tune in your radios to KZSU or try to
catch the games on ESPN and root the Card
inal on to victory. Even if they lose, though,
it's been one hell of a year.
