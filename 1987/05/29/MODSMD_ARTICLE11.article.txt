'Non' portrays
women in a
negative way
A publication called "Non" is
circulating around various parts
of the campus. The first issue
was released during winter quar
ter and a second one has recently
appeared. The publication
features illustrations of violence
against women and texts that are
pornographic in the sense that
they glorify violence and
misogyny. When I first saw a copy
of "Non." I thought the best
response was to ignore it;
however, its consistent portrayals
of violence raise Important issues
that need to be addressed.
Under the pretense of being
avant garde, this publication
romanticizes rape and degrada
tion. These passages may appear
innocuous since they are pre
sented as art. but similar
passages have been shown to
incite violent acts against women.
Regardless, there is no explana
tion of why these scenes are being
presented. They only serve to
humiliate women as well as en
courage and validate men's hostil
ity toward them. Furthermore, by
lightly presenting these issues,
the editor trivializes the experi
ences of women who must con
front these issues daily.
The editor remains anony
mous. yet seems to claim all re
sponsibility by stating. "The
editor thanks only himself." He
leaves himself in the privileged
position of being an invulnerable
observer, much like the profes
sional pornographer. However,
unlike the pornographer — who
must bear some responsibility for
his work — "Non's" editor can
attack whomever he wants with
out fear of reprisal. This kind of
publication should not go unchal
lenged. When attacks like this are
made in our community it is our
responsibility to voice opposition
to them.
We can counteract the callous
ness of "Non" by using this op
portunity to discuss and think
about pornography, violence
against women and the social
responsibility that we at Stanford
should feel.

El Salvador
article gave
incorrect view
A recent article on the El Sal
vador trip claims "some students
. . . charged that they were only
exposed to leftist views" (Daily.
May 20).
This isn't so. While the
itinerary initially lacked balance,
that was remedied after the group
arrived and meetings were set up
with the Salvadoran military, a
conservative business group and
U.S. Embassy officials, among
others.
The article also said the stu
dents were "misled" about the
earthquake reconstruction aspect
of the trip. Here's what happened.
Last November, acting Dean of
the Chapel Tom Ambrogi and

Herb Schmidt, one of the signers
of this letter, met with the rector
of the Salvadoran National Uni
versity and with the leaders of the
student organization AGEUS.
They invited the Stanford group
and suggested that part of the
visit be spent working with them
in providing temporary facilities
to replace those damaged in the
October earthquake.
When the Stanford group
arrived most of the work on the
temporary facilities had been
completed. The university and
AGEUS said that, in their view, it
was more important to spend
most of our time learning about
the social, political and economic
situation in El Salvador. We
deferred to their wishes and so
only part of one day was spent on
earthquake reconstruction work.
The article obscures the fact
that the trip did have great edu
cational value and great impact
on the students (and on us). All of
the students became deeply con
cerned about the role of U.S.
foreign policy in the region.
Many of the groups we visited
expressed serious reservations
about the effect of U.S. military
aid and how that aid has made
dialogue and steps toward peace
more difficult. The students have
shared that knowledge and in
sight in over 40 presentations
before campus and community
groups.
The article quotes from a draft
letter attributed to one of the
signers of this letter, Tom
Mcßride. He did write that draft
and. after circulating it to some of
the students, decided not to send
it. How The Daily got it, we don't
know.
The quotes from the draft that
were in the article were accurate
but incomplete, omitting a
central point of the draft letter's
concluding paragraph: "We were
privileged to have been chosen for
this course and this trip. It was a
compelling educational and per
sonal experience for each of us.
The problems of El Salvador are
very complex and the first duty of
concerned persons is to learn. We
wish to see more opportunities
for Stanford students to experi
ence firsthand the realities and
social and political complexities
of other countries, particularly
Third World countries."

Grad students
support co-op
living groups

We are graduate students who
were assigned to Synergy House
four years ago when the co-ops
first integrated graduates into
campus residences. We found,
like many others, that this house
was a truly great place. Here
people practice working together
and respect diversity. Synergy is a
place that gives meaning to resi
dential education.
Having undergrads and grads
living together is one of the best
things about Synergy. The under
graduates like having graduate
students around. For one. grad

students are good academic role
models. They can help with
physics problem sets and give
tours of their labs. They have
closer contact with faculty and
can easily invite them to dinner.
Many graduate students are
foreign or have spent time out of
school, and thus can offer enrich
ing perspectives.
Conversely, graduate students
like living with undergrads. We
find them intellectually stimulat
ing since they aren't as academi
cally specialized yet and have
broad interests. They also help us
keep in touch with the campus
social life. Having graduate stu
dents in the co-ops breaks down
barriers between the graduate
and undergraduate communities.
We believe that not only should
Synergy remain a co-op. but that
if the house should be changed to
a self-op, it continue to be filled
with 30 percent graduate stu
dents.

Agenda Jailed
to include
gay concerns
When I first heard about the
formation of the Rainbow Agenda
I became quite excited, because it
is my firm belief that oppressed
people must struggle against an
oppressive system before the
system will be changed. Upon
closer examination, however, I
realized that no matter what good
may come of the Rainbow
Agenda, it is at its heart fatally
flawed.
As the name implies, the Rain
bow Agenda purports to be an
umbrella organization embracing
all the excluded groups on
campus. Nevertheless, the truth
is that the leaders of this move
ment have repeatedly and consis
tently refused to confront the
issues of concern to several
campus groups, particularly
those of the gay and lesbian com
munity. As an example, when
asked to include various gay and
lesbian demands in the agenda,
one student involved said that
there is a lot of homophobia in
the black community and they
don't want to alienate any blacks
from the movement. The insen
sitivity of this statement, coming
from a group calling itself the
"Rainbow" Agenda, is nearly
unbelievable. What it says is that
oppression of gays is just not as
important as oppression of
blacks, and. even more in
sidiously, that homophobia will
be both tolerated and even
rewarded.
As was said in Tuesday night's
forum on racism, nobody will be
free until everyone is free. When
we read in The Daily that
homosexuality is a sin, when
companies that recruit at Stan
ford are allowed to openly dis
criminate against gays and
lesbians, when a statue celebrat
ing a future of "Gay Liberation" is
bludgeoned on campus, when
even "progressive" groups refuse
to accept the demands of the gay
and lesbian community, then
clearly freedom is a long way off.
