# Agenda deserves sympathy
## 
### 
In the past weeks, the controversy surrounding
the Rainbow Agenda has elicited a variety of
responses from the Stanford community. Unfortun
ately, the issues raised within these responses seem
to have polarized the campus and, perhaps more
regrettably, seem to have isolated the Rainbow
Agenda as the source of, rather than a single
response to, the alienation many students of racial
and ethnic minority have expressed.

I am writing in the hope that the spirit of mutual
understanding and cooperation will replace that of
mistrust and partisanship, so that this campus can
address, and hopefully resolve, the sensitive issues of
race and ethnicity as a unified body. To clarify my
position at the outset, I am not involved in the Rain
bow Agenda, nor do I necessarily support every item
of its program. 1 am. however, sympathetic to the or
ganization as a whole, and to its vision of what the
University might, can and should be.
Perry Friedman's recent viewpoint (Daily, May 22)
embodies for me the most disturbing response to the
Rainbow Agenda. I have no basis for calling Fried
man a racist, and I hope this letter is not construed
as such an accusation. The ideas expressed in his
viewpoint do, however, flirt dangerously with racist
dogma that remains as a legacy to the backlash
against the civil rights movement of the 19605.
Friedman prefaces his attack by saying that he
supports affirmative action on a limited level (leaving
one to wonder only how many of his best friends are
black). He compares black and minority enrollment
at Stanford with constructive engagement in South
Africa and asks: "If this university is so bad and so
racist, why don't you leave? Why don't you divest
from this 'terrible' university?" He states that racism
at Stanford is not on the rise but that rather,
"Minority bitching about racism is on the rise." I am
not writing, however, in response to his viewpoint. I
mention it only because his words perpetuate some
of the false assumptions and myths believed by many
white Americans at large and, judging from my ex
perience this year, by a substantial number of Stan
ford students in particular. There is one such myth,
specifically, that these students must abandon
before any headway on these issues can be made.
"We let 'them' into our university, and all they do is
complain. Why don't they just not come here?"
Sometime in the recent past, many white Stanford
students usurped the position reserved for Univer
sity trustees and laid exclusive claim to the guar
dianship of this campus. In reality, Stanford is not
any more "our" university than it is "their" univer
sity. Any student member of the Rainbow Agenda is
as much a member of the Stanford community as
any of its critics and therefore reserves the accompa
nying right to try to change things in that commu
nity with which he is dissatisfied.
The problem with comparing minority enrollment

to constructive engagement is that such a compari
son neglects the fact that blacks, Hispanics, Asians
and native Americans at Stanford are not members
of an outside agitator group that picked Stanford out
as a racist institution and then decided to infiltrate
and alter it. They are students here who picked Stan
ford the way every high school senior picks the col
lege he or she wishes to attend. They have the right
as enrolled students to try to make this school fit
their needs. No one told the artists who agitated for
an arts theme house to "divest" from "our" university
if it didn't meet their needs.
There are also those who point to affirmative ac
tion as a reason that minorities do not have as much
a right to call Stanford their own as do white stu
dents. As Friedman says,"The University makes it
easier for them to get in." The problem with this
reasoning is that it assumes that every minority pef
son at Stanford was admitted only because of the
color of his or her skin. This is not the case at aIL
There are a great many components in each Stanford
student's application that are evaluated by the Ad
missions Office. I, in my admittedly untrained judge
ment, have yet to run across a student here who
qualifies on every single one of these components. •
For me to assert that an applicant's racial or ethnic
background plays no role in the admissions decision
would be naive and uninformed, but there are other
such background qualifications that do not receive
similar reactions. Legacy students here, for in
stance, are not assumed to be less qualified academi
cally. even though the fact that one of their parents
attended Stanford "unfairly" Influenced the evalua
tion of their applications. They, like minority appli
cants, had no control over this circumstance of
birth. Unlike minorities, they do not have to carry
the stigma of being second-class Stanford citizens.
For a white Stanford student to see a minority stu
dent and assume that the only reason for that stu
dent's admission was his or her race or ethnicity is
arrogant and egotistical in its nearsightedness.
I hope that this letter is read in the spirit in which
it was written. I am not trying to add more fuel to the
fire of divisiveness. At the risk of sounding preachy, I
urge Stanford students of every race and persuasion
to refrain from the impulse to shoot first and ask
questions later. More energy devoted to providing
and seeking out information on all sides might save
so much energy now being wasted in knee-jerk con
demnations and accusations.
The Rainbow activists are no more "spoiled brats"
than Friedman is a Klansman. Amanda Kemp wrote
a letter (Daily. April 28) in which she stated that
many "students of color" felt unwanted at Stanford.
Niggers £° home" is the phrase she used to describe
what she heard beneath many of the criticisms of
minority activism here. I hope and believe that I
speak for the majority here at Stanford when I appeal
to these same "students of color": Stay! Your pres
ence enriches me, and for this I am in your debt.
Only together can we create a community that will
truly benefit all who will soon call Stanford their
alma mater.
