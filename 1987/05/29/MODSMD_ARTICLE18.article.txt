## New 'Adviser of the Year' Med School prof. gives frosh the best advice around 
### KATHY LACHENAUER 
Maybe the "Man of the Year" got
his picture on the cover of Time
Magazine, but Stanford's "Adviser
of the Year" also received special
acknowledgement at Wednesday's
sth annual adviser reception.
"Every word received about this
adviser is laudatory," University
President Donald Kennedy said
when he presented the award to
Franklin Ebaugh, an associate
dean at Stanford Medical School.
"In the past, advisers who
served for 1 1 years or more were
awarded the title of 'master advi
ser.' This year, we decided that al
though length of service was im
portant. taken by itself it did not
reflect the efforts and the quality
oi advising offered by some of our
best advisers," said Freshman
Advising Coordinator Andree Sur
sock.
"We asked all the freshmen to
write us with nominations for
their advisers," she explained.
According to Sursock. there
were 43 nominations and Ebaugh
was one of two advisers chosen for
the award. The other recipient.
Assoc. Psychiatry Prof. Richard
Bale, usually advises Roble resi
dents but is presently overseas.
An adviser for nine years in
Otero, Ebaugh came to Stanford
from the University of Utah's
school of medicine and is now
known by a decade's worth of
Stanford human biology students.
"He's t fie kind of fellow who goes
(to the freshman dorm) every

week. He keeps abreast of changes
in academic programs and goes to
great length in helping students
explore different options and
choosing a major." Sursock said.
For example. Ebaugh has taken
some of his freshman advisees to
view open heart surgery and has
asked others to follow him on
medical rounds.
Helping his freshmen with the
momentous choice of a major.
Ebaugh has provided his students
with internships and summer
jobs to make the decision easier.
He also invites a variety of stu
dents in different majors to come
talk to his freshmen.
Despite all his efforts, Ebaugh
did not expect Wednesday's spe
cial recognition. "The award
surprised the heck out of me." he
said.
Encouraging his advisees to do
more than they think they can
and warning those who have
taken on too much. Ebaugh
prides himself on knowing his
freshmen as friends. "The job has
mostly been companionship for
me," Ebaugh said.
Besides sharing in their aca
demic lives, Ebaugh usually
recruits a squash player from his
advising group. "The history's in
evitable. 1 teach them to play when
they are freshmen, but by senior
year they are beating me."
Perhaps his squash game
sometimes falters. But according
to Sursock. when it comes to
advising. Ebaugh is consistently
excellent.
