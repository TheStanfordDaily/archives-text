## Tough field awaits Cardinal in Omaha No. 2 Stanford faces Georgia Bulldogs 
### CHRIS MYERS Editorial staff 
When Stanford opens College World Se
ries action in Omaha, Neb. tomorrow at
5:10 p.m. PST against Georgia, it will be
lending its presence to what may be the
finest field in Series history.
The Cardinal, ranked second nationally,
breezed through Pacific 10 Southern Divi
sion action, winning what many consider
to be the toughest conference in the nation
by five games, and then went unbeaten
through a challenging West 1 Regional to
qualify for a trip to the spring classic.
But the biggest challenge is still ahead for
the Cardinal — the Series bracket reads like
a who's who of college baseball power
houses. It also reads like an atlas of the Sun
Belt: Texas, Arizona State, Florida State,
Lousiana State, Arkansas, Georgia and
Oklahoma State.
"In the past, you could take a guess which
two teams would be the first two
eliminated, and have a pretty good chance
of being right," said Dan Knobler. assistant
editor of Baseball America. "This year you
really can't do that."
"I've never seen a stronger field at the
World Series." agreed Louis Pavlovich Jr.,
managing editor of Collegiate Baseball.
"Any of the eight could win it."
Of the eight teams in the double
elimination Series tournament, Stanford
and Arizona State played the toughest
regular-season schedule, according to Pav
lovich's calculations. "That's very impor
tant." he said.
Stanford points to pitching depth as a
strength, but according to Knobler: "The

way the Series is set up now. pitching depth
isn't as crucial as it used to be. If you win in
the first round, you've got two days off. If
you win your next one. you get two more
days off. But your bullpen is still important
because of the kind of hitters who are at the
World Series."
To Pavlovich, team speed is one of the big
gest keys to doing well in the tournament.
"The last few teams to win the Series had
better-tban-average pitching, and they all
had great running games. Stanford has rea
sonably good speed."
Defense is also important, according to
Pavlovich, and Stanford has the highest
team fielding percentage of the eight
squads in Omaha.
"Stanford is very capable of winning (the
Series)," Pavlovich said.
If Stanford wins its opener tomorrow, it
will play Tuesday against the winner of the
Texas-Arkansas game. If the Cardinal loses
to Georgia, it will have to play again on Sun
day night against the Texas-Arkansas loser.
Stanford Coach Mark Marquess hasn't
finalized his pitching choice for the first
game. He may throw junior right-hander
Lee Plemel against Georgia and save ace
Jack McDowell for a potential second-round
confrontation with top-ranked Texas.
McDowell threw six innings last Friday
against Minnesota in the opening game of
the West I Regional, and came back to go
eight on Monday against Oral Roberts in
the championship game of the tournament.
Marquess has indicated that if McDowell
has any soreness or tightness, Plemel will
definitely get the nod against Georgia.

Third baseman Ed Sprague has been solid both in the field and at bat for the Omaha-bound Stanford Cardinal. Sprague is
hitting .333 with 18 home runs and 67 RBIs. Stanford's first-round game against the Georgia Bulldogs will be broadcast on
ESPN and KZSU, 90.1 FM, at 5:10 p.m. tomorrow.
This is Stanford's fourth College
World Series appearance In the
last six years. The Cardinal also
went to Omaha In 1967. Stanford
has won one and lost two in each
of Its last three appearances. In
1982, 1983 and 1985. The Card
inal has never won the Series.
All College World Series games
will be telecast live on ESPN. All
Stanford games will be broadcast
live on KZSU, 90.1 FM, with the
indefatigable David Fisher and
sonorous Susan Slusser providing
play-by-play and cogent analysis.
Following is a rundown of the
seven other teams in the College
World Series field.
Georgia
The No. 8 Bulldogs. 42-19 on

the year, are making their first ap
pearance at the College World Se
ries. and their first postseason ap
pearance of any kind since 1953.
That's significant, according to
both Pavlovich and Knobler.
"Teams that go to Omaha for
the first time are kind of awe
struck; it's kind of like Dis
neyland." Pavlovich said.
"It would surprise me if Georgia
won it." Knobler said. "No team
has ever won it on its first appear
ance."
Still, the Bulldogs do have the
tools. They are led by junior Derek
Lillquist. who leads the nation in
strikeouts with 184 In 131 in
nings (an average of 12.5
strikeouts per game). In 17 in
nings at the Northeast Regional.
Lillquist fanned 25 and gave up a
scant six earned runs. The left
hander also does damage from the
batter's box: He has 19 home runs
and a .301 average this year.

"He's an unbelievable talent."
Pavlovich said. "I've never seen
anybody who was such an over
powering pitcher and could also
hit so well. He's the best athlete in
college baseball."
When Lillquist falters on the
mound, he is relieved by one of the
nation's finest firemen, right
hander Cris Carpenter. Carpenter
enters the Series with a 9-3
record. 11 saves. 94 stikeouts and
only 19 walks in 98 innings
pitched.
As a team, the Bulldogs have
slugged 102 homers, but "have
stolen very few bases." according
to Pavlovich.
Texas
As the top-ranked team in the
country for almost the entire year,
the 58-9 Longhorns are the con
sensus choice to win the Series.
Roger Clemens' alma mater has
traditionally built its team around

pitching and defense, and this
year Is no different, according to
Pavlovich.
"They have great pitching and
great defense, a lot of speed and
play hit-and-run," he said.
The Longhorn s mound ace this
year is junior right-hander Curt
Krippner. Krippner is undefeated
in 13 decisions and stuck out 111
while pacing Texas to its 60th
Southwest Conference regular
season title in the last 72 years.
"Texas probably has the best all
around talent," Knobler said.
"They blew through their confer
ence and the regionals. This may
be the year Texas does it. They al
ways have the talent, but this year
they've got the desire."
Indeed, of the Longhorns' 58
victories this year. 32 were come
from-behind wins, according to
Pavlovich. "That really means a lot
in the Series when you're able to
come back like that," he said.

The only question mark with
Texas is the team's ability to win
outside the friendly confines of
Austins Disch-Falk Field. Of the
Longhorns' 67 games this season,
only 12 were played on the road.
"They just don't like to play
away from home." Pavlovich said.
Arkansas
After a few crucial departures
due to graduation last year. No. 4
Arkansas rebuilt around several
junior college transfers, and is
probably one of the weaker teams
in the field, according to Knobler.
Aside from having the best mas
cot in the Series field, the Razor
backs. 50-14 on the year, also
have All-America catcher Andy
Skeels (batting .387) and veteran
pitchers Tim Peters and Ray Har
ris.
The Razorbacks have the ill
fortune of meeting Southwest

Conference rival Texas in the first
round.
Louisiana State
The No. 11 Tigers, 47-17 and
winners of the South II Regional,
have to be a dark horse in the Se
ries. LSU has "the best pitching
staff in the nation." according to
Pavlovich. but must play without
its best offensive player, outfielder
Joey Belle. At the Southeast Con
ference Tournamant in Athens.
Ga.. Belle went into the stands
after a Mississippi State fan who
had been heckling him and hur
ling racial slurs his way. Belle was
indefinitely suspended by LSU.
and with him goes 20 home runs
worth of offensive production.
Even without Belle, however,
the Tigers have great team speed
and a pitching staff with a
combined 3.00 ERA. Tiger
baserunners have stolen 147
bases in 196 attempts.
Florida State
If LSU has great team speed,
then Florida State is amazing. The
No. 5 Seminoles blazed to 227
steals in 294 attempts, while al
lowing opponents a paltry 49
thefts in 74 tries. "That's an unbe
lievable ratio," Pavlovich said.
Florida State also has the
second-best strikeout artist in the
country. Junior right-hander
Richie Lewis' 171 K's in 131 in
nings are second only to Georgia's
Lillquist. With three strikeouts in
the Series, Lewis will become only
the third pitcher in collegiate his
tory to record 500 career
strikeouts. "He's a little crazy —

likes to throw a lot," Knobler said.
"He threw over 200 pitches in one
game this year."
The Seminole defense and of
fense are both anchored by their
double-play combination of se
cond baseman Aedwin Alisea and
shortstop Rafael Bournigal. who
both hit for power and average.
Arizona State
The No. 9 Sun Devils, who tied
with UCLA for second place in the
Slx-Pac, have an "incredible pitch
ing staff' and the lOth-best offen
sive production in the nation, ac
cording to Pavlovich. The staff has
a combined ERA of 4.18 and the
offense ripped 105 home runs in
65 games.
And the 40-25 Sun Devils, ap
propriately enough, are very hot.
ASU won a very tough West II
Regional that included UCLA and
then-No. 3 Pepperdine. In the
process, the Sun Devils got a

mind-boggling four complete
games from their pitching staff.
Mike Schwabe threw twin 12-
hltters at Southwest Missouri and
Pepperdine, Linty Ingram six-hit
mighty UCLA and David Cassidy
put the Bruins Into hibernation
with a seven-hitter in the
regional's championship game.
Oklahoma State
The No. 3 Cowboys, 56-11 and
perennial World Series partici
pants, would be the favorite in the
upper half of the bracket, except
for one small problem: They may
be playing without their head
coach and best hitter.
During the Mideast Regional at
Mississippi State, local fans
mercilessly heckled senior Cowboy
outfielder Anthony Blackmon,
who batted well over .400 all year.
Eventually, Blackmon tired of this
abuse and during the last game of
the regional he dropped his pants

several times in the direction of
his assailants.
The Mlssissipi State fans
reacted strongly after the game,
and OSU head coach Gary Ward
publicly reprimanded Mississippi
State for failing to control its fans,
saying, "There are a lot of unsu
pervised fans out there who need
mental enemas."
Now both Blackmon and Ward
may be suspended from World Se
ries play. The NCAA's decision on
the matter is pending.
Meanwhile, the Cowboys con
tinue to be the best hitting team
in the nation. No Cowboy is hit
ting better than sophomore third
baseman Robin Ventura, who is
currently riding a 56-game hitting
streak and is now targeting the
all-time professional record of 69.
"The pitching staff is as big a
question as you're going to find on
that team because they're always
going to hit." Knobler said.
