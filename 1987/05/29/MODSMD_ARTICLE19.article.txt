## Tough field awaits Cardinal in Omaha No. 2 Stanford faces Georgia Bulldogs 
### CHRIS MYERS Editorial staff 
When Stanford opens College World Se
ries action in Omaha, Neb. tomorrow at
5:10 p.m. PST against Georgia, it will be
lending its presence to what may be the
finest field in Series history.
The Cardinal, ranked second nationally,
breezed through Pacific 10 Southern Divi
sion action, winning what many consider
to be the toughest conference in the nation
by five games, and then went unbeaten
through a challenging West 1 Regional to
qualify for a trip to the spring classic.
But the biggest challenge is still ahead for
the Cardinal â€” the Series bracket reads like
a who's who of college baseball power
houses. It also reads like an atlas of the Sun
Belt: Texas, Arizona State, Florida State,
Lousiana State, Arkansas, Georgia and
Oklahoma State.
"In the past, you could take a guess which
two teams would be the first two
eliminated, and have a pretty good chance
of being right," said Dan Knobler. assistant
editor of Baseball America. "This year you
really can't do that."
"I've never seen a stronger field at the
World Series." agreed Louis Pavlovich Jr.,
managing editor of Collegiate Baseball.
"Any of the eight could win it."
Of the eight teams in the double
elimination Series tournament, Stanford
and Arizona State played the toughest
regular-season schedule, according to Pav
lovich's calculations. "That's very impor
tant." he said.
Stanford points to pitching depth as a
strength, but according to Knobler: "The

way the Series is set up now. pitching depth
isn't as crucial as it used to be. If you win in
the first round, you've got two days off. If
you win your next one. you get two more
days off. But your bullpen is still important
because of the kind of hitters who are at the
World Series."
To Pavlovich, team speed is one of the big
gest keys to doing well in the tournament.
"The last few teams to win the Series had
better-tban-average pitching, and they all
had great running games. Stanford has rea
sonably good speed."
Defense is also important, according to
Pavlovich, and Stanford has the highest
team fielding percentage of the eight
squads in Omaha.
"Stanford is very capable of winning (the
Series)," Pavlovich said.
If Stanford wins its opener tomorrow, it
will play Tuesday against the winner of the
Texas-Arkansas game. If the Cardinal loses
to Georgia, it will have to play again on Sun
day night against the Texas-Arkansas loser.
Stanford Coach Mark Marquess hasn't
finalized his pitching choice for the first
game. He may throw junior right-hander
Lee Plemel against Georgia and save ace
Jack McDowell for a potential second-round
confrontation with top-ranked Texas.
McDowell threw six innings last Friday
against Minnesota in the opening game of
the West I Regional, and came back to go
eight on Monday against Oral Roberts in
the championship game of the tournament.
Marquess has indicated that if McDowell
has any soreness or tightness, Plemel will
definitely get the nod against Georgia.
