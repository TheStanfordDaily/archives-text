# Economy vital to fund raising
## 
### STEPHEN KASIERSKI Senior staff writer 
This is the last oj a four-part series on
the Stanford Centennial Campaign.

A healthy economy means healthy
donations.
With the $1.1 billion University Cen
tennial Campaign in high gear, Stan
ford fund-raisers are hoping that the
charitable inclinations of potential
donors will be bolstered by visions of na
tional economic stability.
Although University officials say dona
tions are currently meeting expected
levels, an economic slump could have
devasting effects on the Stanford cam
paign, which is the largest fund-raising
effort in the history of private education.

It is likely that Stanford's fund raising
will benefit from the recent stock market
boom and from continuing low levels of
inflation, two key predictors of the
charitability of large donors.
"When the stock market is on the rise
and inflation is under control, people
feel more comfortable about the future,"
according to Richard Bennett, associate
director of the Centennial Campaign.
Bruce Hinchliffe, director of the cam
paign and associate vice president in the
Office of Development, said that univer
sities and other institutions dependent
on charitable contributions are particu
larly vulnerable to high inflation be
cause donations typically do not
"ratchet up" with inflation.
According to Hinchliffe, rampant in
flation would erode confidence in the

economy and encourage donors to
reduce their'gifts. "If inflation is bad,
people woriy about the future (and) hold
on to their [money]," he said.
General economic hardship can also
influence the timing 6f,,a campaign. For
example, Bennett said the nation was
hit by a recession in 1970, precisely
when the University was preparing for
its $300 million Campaign for Stanford.
University trustees at the time
postponed announcing the campaign
for one year. Although donations did not
decrease, overall contributions re
mained relatively flat, Bennett said.
This year's stock market boom means
that the time is right for soliciting dona-
tions from foundations and corpo
rations.
Foundations are particularly
"flush" right now because the
value of their stock portfolios has
"ballooned." according to Larry
Lollar, director of corporate and
foundation relations for the Office
of Development.
Because foundations are re
quired by law to give away 5 per
cent of their assets every year. Lol
lar said. Stanford is in an excel
lent position to take advantage of
more "up-front" foundation
giving.
Business fluctuations also play
a role in the flow of corporate
donations. For example. Lollar
said Stanford would not expect
large donations from companies
associated with the oil industry, a
sector of the economy that has
been depressed recently.
Lollar noted, however, that
"overall, the general economic
climate has been very good for cor
porations, so we're in a period
right now where we think we
really can take advantage of that."
University officials also insist
that the recent decision by the
Ronald Reagan Presidential Foun
dation to withdraw a proposed
presidential library here will not
affect the Unversity's campaign.

"There will be some people who
will be happy and some who will
be unhappy, but it will actually
cut both ways." Hinchliffe said.
Some potential donors may also
appreciate that the University
never changed its official position
of supporting a Reagan library on
campus, he said. According to
Hinchliffe. there was also no
noticeable effect on donations
when the University two years ago
refused to allow the Reagan foun
dation to build a a public affairs
center adjacent to the library com
plex.
Hinchliffe added that the sheer
size of the Centennial Campaign
makes the task of determining the
effects of the library decision diffi
cult. He noted that a loss of as
much as $20 million would far
from "cripple" a $1.1 billion cam
paign.
Bennett also said the effect of
the Tax Reform Act of 1986 on
University fund raising is "still a
big question mark."
Stanford and other institutions
dependent on charitable giving
vigorously opposed aspects of the
tax reform bill that required taxa
tion of gifts of appreciated assets.
Although giving to Stanford has
been "pretty good" this year.
Hinchliffe said the true effects of
the tax reform provision will not
be known until after the
"blending" of the old tax code and
the new reforms is completed.
