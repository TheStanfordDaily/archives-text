This is the last oj a four-part series on
the Stanford Centennial Campaign.

A healthy economy means healthy
donations.
With the $1.1 billion University Cen
tennial Campaign in high gear, Stan
ford fund-raisers are hoping that the
charitable inclinations of potential
donors will be bolstered by visions of na
tional economic stability.
Although University officials say dona
tions are currently meeting expected
levels, an economic slump could have
devasting effects on the Stanford cam
paign, which is the largest fund-raising
effort in the history of private education.

It is likely that Stanford's fund raising
will benefit from the recent stock market
boom and from continuing low levels of
inflation, two key predictors of the
charitability of large donors.
"When the stock market is on the rise
and inflation is under control, people
feel more comfortable about the future,"
according to Richard Bennett, associate
director of the Centennial Campaign.
Bruce Hinchliffe, director of the cam
paign and associate vice president in the
Office of Development, said that univer
sities and other institutions dependent
on charitable contributions are particu
larly vulnerable to high inflation be
cause donations typically do not
"ratchet up" with inflation.
According to Hinchliffe, rampant in
flation would erode confidence in the

economy and encourage donors to
reduce their'gifts. "If inflation is bad,
people woriy about the future (and) hold
on to their [money]," he said.
General economic hardship can also
influence the timing 6f,,a campaign. For
example, Bennett said the nation was
hit by a recession in 1970, precisely
when the University was preparing for
its $300 million Campaign for Stanford.
University trustees at the time
postponed announcing the campaign
for one year. Although donations did not
decrease, overall contributions re
mained relatively flat, Bennett said.
This year's stock market boom means
that the time is right for soliciting dona-
