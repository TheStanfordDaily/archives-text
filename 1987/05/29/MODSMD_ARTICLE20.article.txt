# Carey and Esquer make up dynamic defensive duo
## 
### CHRIS MYERS Editorial staff 
In 1986, David Esquer and
Frank Carey were in competition
for the same spot in the starting
lineup of the Stanford baseball
team.
Now, however, senior shortstop
Esquer and sophomore second
baseman Carey have settled in
slde-by-side In the middle of the
infield, and their steady play is
one of the keys to the success of
the Cardinal, which begins Col
lege World Series action tomorrow
night against the Georgia Bull
dogs.
"You don't win if you're not good
up the middle, especially at
shortstop and second base." Stan
ford Coach Mark Marquess said.
"If (Esquer and Carey] weren't
playing well defensively, we
wouldn't be here right now. That's
the key to it. You've got to have a
good shortstop and second
baseman and we've got it."
But the contributions of Esquer
and Carey have not been solely de
fensive. Esquer's batting was one
of the most pleasant suprises of
the Cardinal's season: After
making only 45 plate appearances
in his first three years on the
Farm, Esquer stepped into the
regular batting order this year and
hit .315 for the season and .330 in
Pacific 10 Southern Division play.
That production came as a
surprise to everyone but Esquer.
"I was expecting a lot out of
myself — I don't think anybody
else was," he said.
Carey was also expecting a lot
out of himself offensively, and
confessed to being "disappointed"
in his own performance. "All year I
was experimenting and I never
really felt comfortable (at the plate)
for an extended period of time," he
said. "I really don't care about my

personal statistics, but 1 kind of
pride myself on getting big hits.
Last year. I didn't hit for average,
but 1 had a lot of two-out RBIs.
This year I didn't do that as
much."
Carey's statistics, however, belie
his words. His average went up
from .240 last year to .271 this
year, his RBI total went up and his
doubles went up from 6 to 15.
Most importantly, in the biggest
games of the year — last
weekend's West I Regional —
Carey really turned it on. He
batted .500 in the four games,
with five RBIs, two doubles and a
triple. He was 3-for-4 with men in
scoring position or with two outs.
"I finally felt comfortable at the
plate." Carey said. "That and the
combination of the playoff situa
tion — the concentration level was
up."
All season long, Esquer and
Carey, who ordinarily bat in the
seventh and ninth positions in
the Cardinal batting order, "have
taken pride in getting things
started," according to Esquer. "We
set some goals for ourselves. We al
ways tell ourselves that we're the
key."
"It's a big difference when me
and him (Esquer) can get on
base," Carey said, "because after
that you've got Ruben (Amaro),
Toi (Cook). Ed (Sprague) and Paul
(Carey) coming up."
Their coach and teammates
agree. "Since Frank's been swing
ing the bat well the last 10 to 12
games, he has really picked us up
down there." Marquess said.
"We've been scoring a lot of runs
down in the bottom half of the or
der."
"It's very important that the bot
tom of the lineup does well — that
takes the pressure off (the batters
at the top of the order)." senior
center fielder Toi Cook said.

While Esquer and Carey have
remarkably similar styles of play,
the two came to their current
starting roles by markedly differ
ent routes. Carey, a sophomore, is
the highly recruited high school
star who entered the starting
lineup almost immediately last
season. Esquer is the senior who
walked on his freshman year and
then waited patiently in the wings
for his chance in the regular cast.
At times. Esquer had to wonder
if the wait would ever end. He
spent his freshman and sopho
more years as a middle-infield ap
prentice to the Cardinal's All-
America double-play combination
of shortstop John Verducci and
second baseman Pete Stanicek.
But Esquer did not spend his
time idly. "They probably hated all
the questions I asked them."
Esquer said of Verducci and
Stanicek. "They probably taught
me the biggest things I know
about baseball. Just their experi
ence and knowledge were so im
portant."
When Verducci graduated in
1985. it looked as though Esquer
would finally get his shot at
shortstop. He even started on
opening day of 1986. The fresh
man Carey, however, soon dis
placed Esquer and relegated the
junior to a utility role again.
"Last year was kind of frustrat
ing." Esquer said. "But I was
never going to give up on myself."
Carey, meanwhile, was thrown
to the lions of collegiate baseball,
playing the game's toughest de
fensive position as a freshman.
"I put [Frank] in a real tough sit
uation, having to play short as a
freshman, and he played ex
tremely well," Marquess said.
And for Carey, the pressure was
increased by the ghosts of Ver
ducci and Stanicek. "1 felt a little
pressure last year to really play
well defensively." he said.
"Coming in last year, we heard so
much about the team the year
before. They say that was the best
middle infield combination any
college ever had . . . that put a lot
of extra pressure on. Defensively,
people expected me to play like
Verducci, but there was no way I
could have done that."
Carey was also hampered by an
ankle injury suffered during his
senior year at Granite Hills High
School in San Diego County. He
holds the San Diego high school
stolen base record, but last year
the injury slowed him down on the
bases and affected his batting as
well. After nabbing 95 stolen
bases in his high school career, he
stole only seven last year.
This season Carey more than
doubled his stolen base total,
swiping 17, and scored 49 runs,
21 more than last year. "My legs
felt better this year, but they still
hurt on and off." he said.
Carey also thinks the switch to
second base, after a lifetime at
shortstop, helped him.
"Second base is much easier
defensively than shortstop." he
said. "As a shortstop, your main
thing is to play defense. Playing
second base allows you to concen
trate a little more on vour offense."

While Carey made the switch to
second at the start of this year.
Esquer faced another battle, with
another highly touted freshman,
for the shortstop position.
This time, the freshman was
Troy Paulsen. Orange County
Player of the Year last year. Nei
ther player was assured of a job.
"Troy was an outstanding player."
Marquess said."But at the same
time. David had played extremely
well in the summer and had really
improved, and we knew that Troy
might not be able to beat out
David Esquer."
For a while, the two simply
shared time. Then, as fate would
have it, Paulsen went down in
February with a season-ending in
jury. The shortstop job was
Esquer's.
"That was kind of a blessing in
disguise for David." senior left
fielder Ruben Amaro said of Paul
sen's injury. "I was always a
believer in David Esquer. ... I
thought that if he got a chance to
play 30 to 40 games he'd be a great
player."
Once he got his chanee, Esquer
didn't disappoint Amaro or
anyone else. In addition to his im
pressive batting numbers, he has
been rock-solid defensively, com
mitting only five errors in his last
42 games.
And Marquess thinks Esquer's
play compares quite favorably
with that of the storied Verducci.
"I've never had a better defen
sive shortstop than Verducci — he
was just blessed with being an
outstanding defensive shortstop,"
he said. ' But at the same time.
David has made all the plays and
probably hit as well as John did:

maybe he hasn't done it as flashy
as Verducci. but he's gotten the
job done."
In fact. Esquer's fielding
percentage of .950 Is just short of
Verducci's senior year figure of
.951. and offensively, Esquer is
hitting .315 to Verducci's .288.
Marquess had no difficulty put
ting his finger on the reason for
Esquer's emergence this year.
"It's just hard work and deter
mination." he said. "It's what you
like to see — a young man who
works hard, and just made him
self an outstanding player.
"He's been a utility player for
three years, but all those hours —
nobody works harder than David.
We practice for three hours, he
stays out for another hour-and-a
half; he's done that for three
years." Marquess said. "Then he
gets his opportunity, and yet. it's
not given to him. He has to beat
out a talented freshman. . . . Most
kids would have given up. "
Much is made of Esquer's work
ethic. One Bay Area writer even
referred to him as the "blue-collar
guy on a tux-with-tails team." But
for Esquer, the hard work just
comes naturally.
"I always thought maybe I was a
little weird, because I just like to
practice." he said.
To Esquer. his breakthrough
came not from hard work but from
finally being able to apply his hard
work in a game situation. "The
key was just relaxing, being able
to carry over what I do in practice
to what I do In a game." he said.
"You have to learn to go out and
have fun instead of expecting a lot
out of yourself and not giving
yourself any margin for error."

So now, two players who fought
each other for a starting spot last
year are anchoring the Cardinal's
defense this year. "Last year we
were in competition, but this year,
playing together has been great,"
Carey said. "David's just a great
player to play with. He has such a
great attitude, and he really keeps
you in the game . . . and he has
just played real solid shortstop all
year. . . . Knowing that he's
playing solid all along makes all
the difference in the world."
"I like playing next to Frank a
lot." Esquer said. "We've gotten to
know each other real well. . . .
We're kind of both young at our
positions."
Both Esquer and Carey will
make their first College World Se
ries starts tomorrow night against
Georgia. "I'm excited," Carey said.
"I've heard about it so much." For
him the Series is a completely new
experience, but he said that his
two years as a starter and two
straight appearances in regional
playoff competition have prepared
him well for the pressures of the
Series.
Esquer, on the other hand, has
been to the Series before, but it
wasn't a completely fulfilling ex
perience. He was a sophomore
substitute behind Verducci, and
the Cardinal was eliminated from
the Series in three games.
"The experience was great, but
it was a little disappointing," he
said. This time around. Esquer
is a senior, and as he said of him
self and his fellow seniors. "We
have nothing to save it for. I know
this team wants it really bad."

Last year David Esquer and Frank Carey battled each other for the starting shortstop position. This
season Carey moved to second base, and he and Esquer have combined both defensively and offensively
to give Stanford a strong middle infield.
