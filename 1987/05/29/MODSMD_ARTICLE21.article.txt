# Cardinal women golfers move up one notch
## 
### ROBERT PORTNOY Staff writer 
Yesterday's second round of the
Women's NCAA golf champion
ships in Albuquerque. N.M.
brought more of the same for the
Stanford Cardinal.
Stanford equaled its 303 first
day total, but moved up just one
spot in the standings, from 12th
to 11th place.
Senior Kathleen McCarthy shot
76 to top the Stanford competitors
with a 150 two-day total, while
sophomore Clare Dolan and junior
Kay Cornelius each carded 74 to
bring their totals to 151 and 156.
respectively. Rounding out Card
inal scores were senior Adrienne
Gilmartin's 76. good for a 152
total, and junior Trish McGon

igle's 77. which put her at 153.
Stanford's solid, excellent play
has gone for naught because other
teams are playing out their minds.
Both Miami and Florida shot 291
yesterday to bring their totals to
matching 5935. They lead the
tournament by three strokes over
three teams at 596. San Jose
State reached that score with a
302, as did USC following its 299
on the day. The big surprise of the
tournament to date is Furman's
second-round charge. They posted
a gutsy 296 to vault from 11th to
third, tied with SJSU and USC.
"If it weren't the NCAAs, we'd be
more pleased with our scores.
USC shot 299 and wasn't too
pleased. We shot 303 and we were
pleased. We had to be honest. It

was one of our best rounds of the
year, and it's in the national
championship with the pressure
on. If we said we weren't (pleased),
we wouldn't be honest with our
selves." McCarthy said.
The individual competition has
been taken over by the ever
present Danielle Ammaccapane of
Arizona State. She followed her
opening-round 71 with a 73 for a
144 total, moving her from a tie
for fifth into sole possession of the
lead by two strokes. Three players
follow her at 146 â€” SJSU's Anne
Jones, New Mexico's Caroline
Keggi and Tracy Kerdyk of Miami.
Despite being tied for 24th,
McCarthy is only six shots out of
first with 36 holes of golf remain
ing. There will be no counting out

the soon-to-be two-time All-
America.
"I have not had my good rounds
yet. I guess I'm saving them till
last. Adrienne was 2-under on the
back, then wound up 3-over,"
McCarthy said. "1 am really
pleased with the way Clare's
played the last two days. Everyone
has the potential to do better. I
don't think anybody's careered it
yet."
McCarthy would have you
believe that the Cardinal, 13 shots
off the lead, still has a chance to

win the tournament and capture
the national title. She has a point.
One need only look at the surge
made by Furman to see the possi
bilities. There is little question
that Stanford has the capability,
but it will simply take their two
best rounds of the season on con
secutive days. And that's a lot to
ask of any team, even one with one
of the top two or three collegiate
golfers in the country.
Stanford was hurt by a storm
that rocked the south course at
the University of New Mexico

toward the end of yesterday's
round. In what Stanford Coach
Tim Baldwin described as "50
mile-per-hour winds." Stanford
players had to labor through the
three toughest holes on the golf
course, numbers 14 through 16. A
rash of bogeys and double bogeys
resulted, killing what may have
otherwise been a Furman-like
round. Baldwin added that the
near tsunami subsided after just
45 minutes, giving relief to those
teams that followed Stanford into
the treacherous three holes.
