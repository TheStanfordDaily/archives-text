Research scientists have little control over
the use of the weapons they invent, argues His
tory Prof. Barton Bernstein in an article pub
lished in the June issue of Scientific Ameri
can.
Based on America s experience with biologi
cal warfare research during World War 11.
Bernstein claims that "scientists may not be
able to constrain use of the technology they
have created, particularly in a conflict that is
deemed a just' war."
Bernstein said in an interview yesterday the
article is part of a larger study he is conducting

on "Morality and Deterrence in World War II."
According to Bernstein, the purpose of the
study is to discover "why certain horrible
weapons were used or not used in World War 11.
what role morality played in either promoting
or deterring use (of particular weapons) and
how morality was redefined in the crucible of
war." he said.
The completed study will focus on various
types of weaponry and strategies, including
chemical warfare and the mass bombing of
cities.
In his article. Bernstein maintains that one
of the reasons for scientists' lack of control
over their inventions is that they generally

view themselves In a "fragmented role."
"Scientists, like others in modern society,
engage in behavior which we call the
fragmented role." They operate separately as
scientists and as citizens, but don't operate as
a whole person, where there would be a sense
of responsibility and control." Bernstein said.
Role fragmentation, togetner wiin me
secrecy often imposed upon weapon research
and the possibility of replacement by other
reseachers. contributes to scientists' lack of
control, according to Bernstein.
The Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI) will be
an "interesting test" of scientists' power to
withhold their labor from projects they believe
are morally wrong, he said.
