# Study finds lower arthritis rate for runners
## Jogging good for elderly 
### ELAINE LU Staff writer 
Researchers at Stanford Medical School
have found that runners over 50 years old
tend to have fewer physical disabilities and
are generally more healthy than people in
the same age group who do not run.
Dr. Nancy Lane, a clinical instructor at
the medical school and a researcher at the
Stanford Arthritis Center, led a study of
498 long-distance runners between the
ages of 50 and 72 and a control group of
365 non-runners from the same age
bracket.
According to Dr. James Fries, associate
professor of medicine and immunology and
an associate of Lane, the "hard-core run
ning fanatics" studied had been running an
average of 27 miles per week for an average
of 11 years.
Over the last three years. Lane and her as
sociates have mailed out questionnaires to
their subjects asking about their weekly ex
ercise. lifestyles and various aspects of their
fitness. In addition. X-rays and CAT scans
have been used to diagnose the develop
ment of muscular or skeletal disability.
Fries said.
A year ago. Lane and her associates re
ported in the Journal of the American Medi
cal Association that older runners did not
experience an increase in the incidence of
arthritis in their knees and hands, but
rather, had stronger bones than non
runners.
In fact. Lane said, the runners over 50
"appeared to develop musculoskeletal dis
ability at a slower rate" than the non
runners.
In an article published in the April issue
of the American Journal of Medicine, Lane

and her associates stated that the runners
they studied had lower blood pressure and
heart rates and generally weighed 15
pounds less than members of the non
runner control group.
The report also showed that actively exer
cising individuals over 50 missed fewer
days of work due to illness. Male runners in
the age group missed an average of 1.5 days
of work due to illness each year, in contrast
to the 4.4 days missed by non-runners over
50. For women, the difference was even
greater — runners missed an average of two
days, while non-runners missed an average
of 11, Lane said.
Runners visited doctors an average of 2.1
times a year, slightly below the non
runners' average of 2.6 times a year.
However. Lane said. "It is important to note
that most of their (runners') visits were for
running-related injuries, as opposed to
major medical problems."
Lane said she and her associates em
barked on the project because they "wanted
to study the effects of running on older run
ners."
In particular. Fries said the research
group wanted to analyze factors that lead to
arthritis, and consider the possible role of
strenuous physical exercise in the onset of
arthritis.
"Since osteoarthritis and related diseases
are the most common cause of physical dis
ability in the elderly." Fries said, it is impor
tant to know whether "runners are ac
celerating or retarding their progress
toward osteoarthritis."
For three years. Lane and Fries have been
working with Daniel Bloch, a biostatis
tician in the Immunology Department, and
Peter Wood, professor and associ
ate director of the Stanford Center
for Research in Disease Preven
tion. in analyzing the data ob
tained from their subjects.
So far. their findings "agree
with the reports that running
causes lower blood pressure and
heart rate." Lane said.
Presently, the mean age of both
the runners and the control group
is 57. which is younger than the
average age at which musculo
skeletal disability generally ap
pears. As a result. Lane said, nei
ther group has many seriously
disabled individuals.
Lane said the research group
plans to continue its research for
another eight years. As the sub
jects age. she said, "more
musculoskeletal disability is ex
pected to show up."
Fries said that through this re
search project, the research team
is "building toward developing
risk factor models for avoiding
arthritis" similar to the risk factor
models for heart disease.
