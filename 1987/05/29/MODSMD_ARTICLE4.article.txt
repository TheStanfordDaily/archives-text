# Synergy fights to keep co-op status
## 
### JAY BHATTACHARYA Staff writer 
Synergy residents have begun to organize
resistance against the University's decision
to change the house from a co-op to a self
op.
Yesterday in White Plaza, house residents
circulated a petition stating that signers
"would prefer to live in Synergy rather than
any other choice if It would mean that
Synergy would remain a co-op." Nearly 90
students signed the document.
The purpose of the petition was to "show
(the Office of Residential Education) that
there are alternatives to closing the house
(as a co-op)," said Synergy resident Jose
Giner.
In addition to circulating the petition.
Synergy residents have decided to take
their case to the University ombudsperson,
and have asked faculty and alumni to write
letters to Res Ed and University President
Donald Kennedy in support of Synergy's co
op status.
The University changed Synergy's
residence status from co-op to self-op be

cause the house was unable to fill 14 of its
33 residence spaces after the second round
of the Draw, according to Rodger Whitney,
assistant dean of Student Affairs and direc
tor of Student Housing.
A co-op is a house in which residents do
their own cooking and cleaning. A self-op is
a residence operated by the University in
which residents contribute to the house's
upkeep.
Special priority houses, such as Synergy,
must fill 90 percent of their undergraduate
assigned spaces.
Whitney said that although he didn't
know what effect the petition would have on
the University's decision, he didn't think it
would be "likely to change" it. Synergy is
already "on the waiting list as a self-op," he
said.
The residents' major complaint is over
the 90 percent rule for special priority
houses. Giner said that prior to this year
the rule only applied to houses that were on
probation.
University guidelines for changing the
program status of a residence
state that houses "that have dem
onstrated difficulty filling in the
Draw in recent years must fill a
least 90 percent of their under
graduate assigned spaces by the
end of Round Two in the 1987
Draw or their program will be
changed." Whitney said Tuesday.
When the 90 percent rule was
expanded to cover all special
priority houses this year. Synergy
could not meet the University
quota, Giner said.
Giner was not sure how the om
budsperson would react to the
complaints, or if any changes
would result from the residents'
efforts.
Whitney expressed regret that
the house's status had to be
changed, but he said. "(Synergy)
is not meeting an important goal
of University housing â€” to house
students."
Even if the house is turned into
a self-op. many current Synergy
residents plan to return there next
year. Giner said.
