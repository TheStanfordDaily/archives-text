# Insurance fee levied; costs provoke concern
## 
### JAY FRY Staff writer 
Stanford students without health insur
ance will have $73 per quarter added to
their University bills next year. This move
has provoked concern among some
graduate students who fear the added cost
will put an unacceptable strain on their fin
ancial resources.
Beginning fall quarter, the University will
require all students to carry medical insur
ance for health care services not covered by
the Cowell Student Health Center, accord
ing to Madelaine Smith, an administrative
assistant at Cowell.
If students are already covered, she said,
they may waive the fee by identifying their
insurance carrier and providing policy in
formation on their fall quarter registration
commitments, which are due July 29.
However, the additional fee for those
without health insurance "could have some
effect on grad students who are financially
strapped," said ASSU Graduate Senator
David Fallek. "It could mean a reduction in
an already slim margin of budget balan
cing."

Lee Metcalf, a graduate student in politi
cal science, said the new plan eliminates
low-level benefits for spouses and depen
dents, increasing fees "prohibitively."
Smith agreed that "some students, espe
cially grad students, see [the new fee] as a
major part of their budget." However,
Smith called the $73 fee for medical
coverage each quarter a "very reasonable ex
pense. It's very competitive when compared
with other group rates." she said.
"[The fee) appears prohibitive if you think
of it as merely a sum of $219 (over three
quarters)," said Elizabeth Traugott, dean of
Graduate Studies. "Though there is an
added expense initially, it can actually be
protection against a much larger expense."
"You need to be prepared to meet those
expenses," Smith added.
Traugott said the University has raised
fellowship stipends, as well as teaching as
sistant and residence assistant minimum
salaries, to help graduate students cover
the added cost of the newly required health
insurance.
The new policy, approved by the Unlver-
sity's Administrative Council,
resulted from a recent informal
survey conducted by Cowell. Ac
cording to Smith, the survey
found between 500 and 700 stu
dents without medical insurance.
"There is a large number of un
insured students, at least 700, if
not more," Smith said. "They are
the ones coming in for help and
who get into medical-care prob
lems."
Smith said many of the uni
nsured students are also depen
dent on financial aid. She noted
that students' financial aid
packages can be readjusted to
cover the $73 fee.
Smith cited rising costs of medi
cal treatment as another reason
for requiring student insurance
policies. She said the new require
ment, which has been under con
sideration for several years, was
formulated by Cowell and the
Graduate Studies Office.
Cowell Director Paul Walters, in
an interview last week, expressed
concern that without the newly re
quired insurance, students beset
by a major illness, operation or in
jury may incur expenses forcing
them to stop out and disrupt their
academic programs.
Traugott said this is especially a
concern for graduate students.

"Medical bills are so colossal
that it affects a graduate student's
program," Traugott said. "You
may. In fact, lose your dissertation
topic."
The new student medical insur
ance policy, underwritten by the
Colonial Life and Accident Insur
ance Company, will provide world
wide coverage for any illness, in
jury or pre-existing condition that
cannot be treated at Cowell, Smith
said.
Cowell does not offer surgery,
fracture care, stitches, maternity
care, hospitalization and care
away from campus during un
registered quarters, Smith said.
The new policy will cover these
areas, but will not cover dental
and optometric services, she said.
The new policy will replace the
optional Lone Star Insurance Plan
that Cowell currently administers.
Approximately 3,500 students
now purchase the optional plan.
Smith said.
Under the new student insur
ance policy, Colonial will pay 80
percent of "usual, customary and
reasonable" (UCR) fees above a
$ 100 deductible. After total claims
for an individual reach $5,000,
Colonial will pay all UCR fees up to
$25,000.
An optional catastrophic insur
ance plan, which Increases maxi
mum coverage to $250,000, will
also be available for an extra $100
per year. Smith said.
