# Insurance fee levied; costs provoke concern

### JAY FRY Staff writer 
Stanford students without health insur
ance will have $73 per quarter added to
their University bills next year. This move
has provoked concern among some
graduate students who fear the added cost
will put an unacceptable strain on their fin
ancial resources.
Beginning fall quarter, the University will
require all students to carry medical insur
ance for health care services not covered by
the Cowell Student Health Center, accord
ing to Madelaine Smith, an administrative
assistant at Cowell.
If students are already covered, she said,
they may waive the fee by identifying their
insurance carrier and providing policy in
formation on their fall quarter registration
commitments, which are due July 29.
However, the additional fee for those
without health insurance "could have some
effect on grad students who are financially
strapped," said ASSU Graduate Senator
David Fallek. "It could mean a reduction in
an already slim margin of budget balan
cing."

Lee Metcalf, a graduate student in politi
cal science, said the new plan eliminates
low-level benefits for spouses and depen
dents, increasing fees "prohibitively."
Smith agreed that "some students, espe
cially grad students, see [the new fee] as a
major part of their budget." However,
Smith called the $73 fee for medical
coverage each quarter a "very reasonable ex
pense. It's very competitive when compared
with other group rates." she said.
"[The fee) appears prohibitive if you think
of it as merely a sum of $219 (over three
quarters)," said Elizabeth Traugott, dean of
Graduate Studies. "Though there is an
added expense initially, it can actually be
protection against a much larger expense."
"You need to be prepared to meet those
expenses," Smith added.
Traugott said the University has raised
fellowship stipends, as well as teaching as
sistant and residence assistant minimum
salaries, to help graduate students cover
the added cost of the newly required health
insurance.
