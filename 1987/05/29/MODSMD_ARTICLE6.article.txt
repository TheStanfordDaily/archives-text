# Speakers blast death penalty

### FRANK QUARATIELLO Staff writer 
Capital punishment is an ineffective deterrent
against violent crime, according to speakers at an
Amnesty International rally in White Plaza yester
day.
"The death penalty in this country is a lottery,
full of whim, happenstance and bias, whose losers
are the poor, the ignorant and.the minorities,"
said Holly Murray, death penalty campaign coord
inator for the Palo Alto chapter of Amnesty Inter
national.
UC-Santa Barbara Sociology Prof. Richard
Berke corroborated Murray's statement with what
he said was evidence from 50 years of empirical re
search showing that the death penalty has been
applied capriciously and unfairly.
The rally, attended by about 20 people, was held
in observance of the beginning of a worldwide Am
nesty International campaign against capital
punishment. Murray said the decision to launch
the campaign, the largest in the history of Am
nesty International, was a difficult one for the or
ganization.
"Many of us who once saw the death penalty as
the uncomfortable stepchild of the (Amnesty In
ternational) movement are now convinced that
the link between other human rights work that we
do and our death penalty work is Inseparable,"
Murray said. "We believe that the protection of
human rights anywhere depends on a fundamen
tal respect for life and human dignity every
where."
Murray specifically attacked the death penalty
in California, which has a death row population of

191, the third-largest in the na
tion.
"There are certain levels of in
humanity to which a civil society
must not allow itself to sink if it is
to remain a civil society," Murray
said. "The reasoning which shud
ders at Nazi gas chambers but ac
cepts the San Quentin gas cham
ber does not stand up to logical or
moral scrutiny."
"The 37 states which execute,
including California, are in effect
saying that killing is acceptable in
a civilized society," Murray said.
While acknowledging that the
campaign will be difficult, Murray
said she is very hopeful that capi
tal punishment can be abolished
in the United States. She cited a
recent public opinion poll, com
missioned by Amnesty Interna
tional, which shows that 81 per
cent of the U.S. population,
though in favor of the death
penalty, would like to find some
better way of dealing with repeat
offenders.
Berke cited empirical research
that he said showed a consensus
against the death penalty in the
United States.
"There's absolutely no evidence,
no scientific evidence whatsoever,
that the marginal deterrent value
of execution exists," Berke said.

adding that there is also no
evidence that members of a vic
tim's family will take the law into
their own hands in the absence of
a death penalty.
Race is still an issue in capital
punishment cases, Berke argued.
The odds are four to 10 times
greater that a criminal will receive
the death sentence if the victim is
white than if the victim is black,
he said.
Speaking at the rally, Tom
Finsterbach, a Catholic chaplain
here, said capital punishment ac
tually promotes criminal behav
ior.
"The attempt on the part of the
state to regulate very serious and
very horrible criminal behavior by
executing the perpetrators has
not worked, and if it simply did
not work, then that would be a
problem, but there's another fac
tor." Finsterbach said. "Often the
execution of people serves to en
courage the behavior that it seeks
to deter.
"Many people who commit
heinous crimes are self-de
structive. The prospect that the
state will provide them with a dra
matic death, in the form of execu
tion, is not only not a deterrent to
their criminal behavior but may,
in fact, provide them with, in a
bizarre logic, a glamorous end, a
glamorous capstone to their
career," Finsterbach explained.
