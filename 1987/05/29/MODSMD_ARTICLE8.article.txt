Republicans meet with Reagan
WASHINGTON — Republican congressional leaders, fearing po
litical fallout from any deeper U.S. Involvement In the Iran-Iraq
war zone, yesterday pressed President Reagan to Justify his policy
and seek support and assistance from Japan, West Germany and
other allies.
Reagan, meeting GOP leaders at the White House, replied that
"vital United States Interests" In the oil-rich Persian Gulf make It
"essential for us to maintain the naval presence." reporters were
told. But he agreed to discuss the issue at next month s economic
summit with U.S. trading partners that benefit most from secure
sea lanes In the gulf.
Secretary of State George Shultz told reporters later in the day
that European allies "are ready to listen and see what they might
do that would fit Into a plan." Shultz added, "We believe freedom
of navigation through the gulf and the Strait of Hormuz is of vital
Interest to us and our allies In the West, and we will stand up for
that."
He said that Secretary of Defense Caspar Weinberger sounded
out European members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization
during meetings this week. Shultz Is expected to press the matter
when he meets NATO foreign ministers next month In Iceland.
Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole, R-Kan., emerged from the
morning session to tell reporters that there were widespread
"reservations" among Republicans In Congress and nationwide
over "whatever our policy may be" in the gulf.
"I have been traveling around the country, and I think there are
a lot of reservations on the part of the people," Dole said. "We get
about 7 percent of that oil. ... I don't believe they have yet ex
plained any real reason that we should be providing free escort
service to every country that depends on that part of the world for
its oil supply."
Soviet ships head toward gulf
BAGHDAD, Iraq — The Soviet Union has dispatched three mine
sweepers to the Persian Gulf In a new incremental buildup of So
viet and American naval forces along the periphery of the Iran-Iraq
war, military and diplomatic sources reported yesterday.
The mine sweepers will join two Soviet frigates that have been
operating in the gulf since the end of last year.
While their military significance is still uncertain, separate So
viet and American decisions this month to expand their roles in
protecting shipping in the gulf are likely to work politically in fa
vor of Iraq, according to Western and Third World diplomatic
sources here.
The step-ups in superpower activity are occurring as Iraq has
launched a vigorous campaign to get the Soviet Union and the
United States more deeply Involved In the region and to get them
to force Iran to the negotiating table, these sources assert.
They believe that Iraq's president, Saddam Hussein, can now
pursue such a medium-term political strategy, saying he has
stabilized his regime, which was endangered by military and
diplomatic reverses six months ago.
Ambassador Tambs testifies
WASHINGTON — Former U.S. Ambassador to Costa Rica Lewis
Tambs yesterday accused high-ranking administration officials of
sacrificing their subordinates' careers to save their own and
disputed Asst. Secretary of State Elliott Abrams' claims of ignor
ance about Tambs' assignment to assist Nicaragua's contra
rebels.
"The field officers who went forward are not being backed up by
the superiors who gave them orders," Tambs complained In tes
timony before the House and Senate committees investigating the
Iran-contra affair.
"What I find to be disconcerting, to put it mildly, Is to see offi
cers who were carrying out what they believed to be orders from
their legitimate superiors now, in effect, seeing their careers
sacrificed."
Tambs. who resigned in December, said that White House aide
Oliver North had ordered him to "open up a southern front" for
the Nicaraguan rebels in 1985, when the strictest of a series of
bans on official U.S. aid to the insurgents was in effect.
He said that Abrams was aware of his orders to smooth the way
for construction of a secret Costa Rican airstrip for the rebels' use.
Abrams Is scheduled to testify to the committees Friday after they
hear in closed session from Joe Fernandez, the former CIA station
chief in Costa Rica, who was known by the code name Tomas Cas
tillo.
Canada may annex islands
TORONTO — A tantalizing offer for Canada to annex a chain of
balmy Islands In the Caribbean is being considered by a special
committee appointed by Prime Minister Brian Mulroney.
Prominent citizens of the Impoverished Turks and Caicos Is
land chain, which is north of Haiti and east of Cuba, are lobbying
to cast off their centuries-old status as a British crown colony in
favor of a new relationship with Canada. Ralph Higgs, president of
the islands' development association, came to Ottawa recently
armed with polls to sell the idea of the chain becoming Canada's
"sunshine province, or sunshine state or whatever."
The prospect of having islands In the sun that are a part of
Canada, accept Canadian dollars and eliminate the hassle of
having to clear customs Is alluring to Canadians who flock to
Florida and the Caribbean in droves during the long winters here.
"What's in it for the islands?" a recent editorial in the Toronto
Star asked rhetorically. "Economic development nurtured by an
Increase in tourism. What's in it for Canada? Ask anybody who
had to fork over 30 cents on the dollar to spend a couple of weeks
in Florida last winter." (The Canadian dollar Is usually worth
about 75 U.S. cents.)
The idea is not entirely new. At the end of World War I, Canadian
Prime Minister Robert Borden noted In his diary that British
Prime Minister David Lloyd George had suggested that Canada
should take over responsibility for the entire British West Indies.
There is no record indicating that Lloyd George and Borden had
any further discussions about the idea.
Archives release Nixon papers
WASHINGTON — A 1971 memo from President Nixon suggest
ing the need for more financial data on Democratic National
Chairman Lawrence O'Brien, whose Watergate office was
burglarized by Republican campaign operatives a year later, was
among 490.000 pages of sensitive White House "special flies"
released yesterday by the National Archives.
The newly opened files, the third batch of Nixon-era materials to
be made public since December, shed some new light on the June
1972 Watergate break-in and the ensuing scandal that forced
Nixon's resignation in August 1974.
The papers also portrayed a beleaguered president who was
sensitive to public criticism and who scrawled directions to his
aides In the margins of daily news summaries and memos sent to
him.
He reacted angrily to a White House news summary in March
1973 reporting that the president of the American Bankers Asso
ciation. a traditionally Republican group, had said on television
that Nixon was responsible for Inflation rising "In full flame
again."
"See that Flanlgan gives him a boot." Nixon wrote White House
Chief of Staff H R. Haldeman. referring to Peter Flanlgan. a presi
dential aide who dealt with bankers. "Our friends are our major
problem!"

in Florida last winter." (The Canadian dollar Is usually worth
about 75 U.S. cents.)
The idea is not entirely new. At the end of World War I, Canadian
Prime Minister Robert Borden noted In his diary that British
Prime Minister David Lloyd George had suggested that Canada
should take over responsibility for the entire British West Indies.
There is no record indicating that Lloyd George and Borden had
any further discussions about the idea.
Archives release Nixon papers
WASHINGTON — A 1971 memo from President Nixon suggest
ing the need for more financial data on Democratic National
Chairman Lawrence O'Brien, whose Watergate office was
burglarized by Republican campaign operatives a year later, was
among 490.000 pages of sensitive White House "special flies"
released yesterday by the National Archives.
The newly opened files, the third batch of Nixon-era materials to
be made public since December, shed some new light on the June
1972 Watergate break-in and the ensuing scandal that forced
Nixon's resignation in August 1974.
The papers also portrayed a beleaguered president who was
sensitive to public criticism and who scrawled directions to his
aides In the margins of daily news summaries and memos sent to
him.
He reacted angrily to a White House news summary in March
1973 reporting that the president of the American Bankers Asso
ciation. a traditionally Republican group, had said on television
that Nixon was responsible for Inflation rising "In full flame
again."
"See that Flanlgan gives him a boot." Nixon wrote White House
Chief of Staff H R. Haldeman. referring to Peter Flanlgan. a presi
dential aide who dealt with bankers. "Our friends are our major
problem!"

Republicans meet with Reagan
WASHINGTON — Republican congressional leaders, fearing po
litical fallout from any deeper U.S. Involvement In the Iran-Iraq
war zone, yesterday pressed President Reagan to Justify his policy
and seek support and assistance from Japan, West Germany and
other allies.
Reagan, meeting GOP leaders at the White House, replied that
"vital United States Interests" In the oil-rich Persian Gulf make It
"essential for us to maintain the naval presence." reporters were
told. But he agreed to discuss the issue at next month s economic
summit with U.S. trading partners that benefit most from secure
sea lanes In the gulf.
Secretary of State George Shultz told reporters later in the day
that European allies "are ready to listen and see what they might
do that would fit Into a plan." Shultz added, "We believe freedom
of navigation through the gulf and the Strait of Hormuz is of vital
Interest to us and our allies In the West, and we will stand up for
that."
He said that Secretary of Defense Caspar Weinberger sounded
out European members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization
during meetings this week. Shultz Is expected to press the matter
when he meets NATO foreign ministers next month In Iceland.
Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole, R-Kan., emerged from the
morning session to tell reporters that there were widespread
"reservations" among Republicans In Congress and nationwide
over "whatever our policy may be" in the gulf.
"I have been traveling around the country, and I think there are
a lot of reservations on the part of the people," Dole said. "We get
about 7 percent of that oil. ... I don't believe they have yet ex
plained any real reason that we should be providing free escort
service to every country that depends on that part of the world for
its oil supply."
Soviet ships head toward gulf
BAGHDAD, Iraq — The Soviet Union has dispatched three mine
sweepers to the Persian Gulf In a new incremental buildup of So
viet and American naval forces along the periphery of the Iran-Iraq
war, military and diplomatic sources reported yesterday.
The mine sweepers will join two Soviet frigates that have been
operating in the gulf since the end of last year.
While their military significance is still uncertain, separate So
viet and American decisions this month to expand their roles in
protecting shipping in the gulf are likely to work politically in fa
vor of Iraq, according to Western and Third World diplomatic
sources here.
The step-ups in superpower activity are occurring as Iraq has
launched a vigorous campaign to get the Soviet Union and the
United States more deeply Involved In the region and to get them
to force Iran to the negotiating table, these sources assert.
They believe that Iraq's president, Saddam Hussein, can now
pursue such a medium-term political strategy, saying he has
stabilized his regime, which was endangered by military and
diplomatic reverses six months ago.
Ambassador Tambs testifies
WASHINGTON — Former U.S. Ambassador to Costa Rica Lewis
Tambs yesterday accused high-ranking administration officials of
sacrificing their subordinates' careers to save their own and
disputed Asst. Secretary of State Elliott Abrams' claims of ignor
ance about Tambs' assignment to assist Nicaragua's contra
rebels.
"The field officers who went forward are not being backed up by
the superiors who gave them orders," Tambs complained In tes
timony before the House and Senate committees investigating the
Iran-contra affair.
"What I find to be disconcerting, to put it mildly, Is to see offi
cers who were carrying out what they believed to be orders from
their legitimate superiors now, in effect, seeing their careers
sacrificed."
Tambs. who resigned in December, said that White House aide
Oliver North had ordered him to "open up a southern front" for
the Nicaraguan rebels in 1985, when the strictest of a series of
bans on official U.S. aid to the insurgents was in effect.
He said that Abrams was aware of his orders to smooth the way
for construction of a secret Costa Rican airstrip for the rebels' use.
Abrams Is scheduled to testify to the committees Friday after they
hear in closed session from Joe Fernandez, the former CIA station
chief in Costa Rica, who was known by the code name Tomas Cas
tillo.
Canada may annex islands
TORONTO — A tantalizing offer for Canada to annex a chain of
balmy Islands In the Caribbean is being considered by a special
committee appointed by Prime Minister Brian Mulroney.
Prominent citizens of the Impoverished Turks and Caicos Is
land chain, which is north of Haiti and east of Cuba, are lobbying
to cast off their centuries-old status as a British crown colony in
favor of a new relationship with Canada. Ralph Higgs, president of
the islands' development association, came to Ottawa recently
armed with polls to sell the idea of the chain becoming Canada's
"sunshine province, or sunshine state or whatever."
The prospect of having islands In the sun that are a part of
Canada, accept Canadian dollars and eliminate the hassle of
having to clear customs Is alluring to Canadians who flock to
Florida and the Caribbean in droves during the long winters here.
"What's in it for the islands?" a recent editorial in the Toronto
Star asked rhetorically. "Economic development nurtured by an
Increase in tourism. What's in it for Canada? Ask anybody who
had to fork over 30 cents on the dollar to spend a couple of weeks
in Florida last winter." (The Canadian dollar Is usually worth
about 75 U.S. cents.)
