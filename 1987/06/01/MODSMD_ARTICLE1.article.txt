## The 						Graduate Experience 
### CAROL MULLER, Ph. D 
I first went to graduate school,
there was an orientation meeting of all first
year students in my program. I remember sit
ting around a big conference table, listening
to each of them talk about who they were and
they came to be there, and thinking "I
don t have ANYTHING in common with these
people " Needless to say, over time and with
a snared common experience, I did find sup
port and friendship among those in the group.
However; that overwhelming initial impres
sion can characterize the beginnings of
graduate study — a time of challenge, growth,
stress, and often, loneliness and isolation.
What is it about graduate school that
can exacerbate those feelings of
loneliness and isolation? Often,
students come to graduate school
from some distance, leaving behind
friends and support structures, and in
some cases, families. The diversity
present among the graduate popula
tion at Stanford makes for an
enrichcd experience, but also means
that one is more apt to feel isolated or
lonely initially because it takes longer
to overcome cultural, language, age,
and other barriers. And if one is a
member of a minority group among
graduate students, whether a member
of an ethnic minority group, and
international student, or a woman, the
feelings of isolation may be in
creased.
Older students often leave positions
of responsibility in which they have
developed a certain reputation and
identity for themselves. They may
experience a loss of status upon
becoming "just a student" again, with
a bewildering accompaniment of loss
of self-esteem and confidence. As
"apprentice" scholars or profession
als, there is a feeling that somehow
even graduate students are not quite
yet adults or full, contributing
members of the University commu
nity. As one former student said, "It
doesn't matter who you are, what
you've done, or what you have to
offer, when you become a graduate
student, that's all you are."
Coupled with these changes in

community and status are academic
pressures. Once in graduate school,
there are high expectations for strong
academic performance and long
hours devoted to academic work.
Funding may depend upon academic
progress, and certainly it often seems
one's future will be determined by
success in graduate school. The
pressure to perform well and produce
often means that students spend
nearly all of their waking hours in the
lab or library, and have little opportu
nity to develop the friendships and
support networks which would
reduce the initial feelings of isolation.
And the general work ethic at a high
powered research university may
mean students find faculty working at
all hours of day and night and on
weekends, presenting role models to
which students feel compelled to
adhere. Though student interaction
within academic departments can
foster a sense of individual initiative
and creativity, there may also be an
underlying competition among those
in a research group or department. A
competitive environment makes it
difficult to admit vulnerability, in
creasing a sense of loneliness, and
often leading students to believe that
they must be the only ones feeling
inept or insecure.
Within a university, academic work is
often accomplished in isolation. A
faculty member often works alone —
writing, reading, thinking, comput
ing — and faculty are not only
teachers and advisors, but also arc
role models for graduate students.

For those students writing theses in
particular, a sense of isolation can be
acute. It often seems as if, in order to
finish, it is necessary to cut off ties to
organizations, slop seeing friends
socially, and withdraw from any
other distractions. That intense
intellectual immersion can be very
stimulating, but if it continues for too
long a time, the isolation becomes
overwhelming.
Because of intense academic pres
sures and lime commitments,
sometimes it doesn't seem as if
personal relationships are possible to
combine with graduate work, and as
if one's other interests must be "put
on hold" for the duration of graduate
school. Single students, both men
and women, are often at a point in
their lives where they would like to
find future mates. They, in particu
lar, have concerns about the difficul
ties of developing meaningful
relationships in an environment
where time is at a premium and the
gender ratio is oddly skewed. There
is also concern about the conse
quences of waiting until they are "all
finished" before beginning the
"search," a singles' version of the
dilemma of the biological time clock.
Having to make undesirable trade
offs between graduate work and
relationships is not confined to single
students, of course, and the pressures
of graduate work, intense immersion
in studies, and accompanying role
confusion or change can wreak havoc
with established relationships. It is
more likely that you'll feel lonely and

isolated in an environment where it is
more difficult to establish or maintain
supportive personal relationships.
Thus, there are a number of structural
and cultural factors about graduate
study which can contribute to
feelings of isolation and loneliness.
Having painted a somehwat bleak
picture, what positive strategies can
be suggested? First, realize that to a
great extent, you are feeling and
experiencing emotions and dilem
mas common to many graduate
students; though it often seems as if
you're the only one with doubts,
fears, insecurities, you're far from
alone. Don't be afraid to talk with
other students about your feelings;
they'll probably be relieved to have a
chance to talk and share experiences.
Recognize that privacy, essential to
graduate study, and isolation arc two
different things; you can find privacy
when you need it, but avoid isolation
by developing tics to supportive
communities, whether in your
department, your residence, with
other student organizations at the
University or in the community
outside of Stanford. Spend some
time in social and recreational
activities. Find some ways of
expressing yourself and exploring
interests outside your academic work
(and don't feel guilty about taking
time for them!), whether it's involve
ment with family, recreational
interests, exercise, politics, art,
music, volunteer work, or other
pursuits.

progress, and certainly it often seems
one's future will be determined by
success in graduate school. The
pressure to perform well and produce
often means that students spend
nearly all of their waking hours in the
lab or library, and have little opportu
nity to develop the friendships and
support networks which would
reduce the initial feelings of isolation.
And the general work ethic at a high
powered research university may
mean students find faculty working at
all hours of day and night and on
weekends, presenting role models to
which students feel compelled to
adhere. Though student interaction
within academic departments can
foster a sense of individual initiative
and creativity, there may also be an
underlying competition among those
in a research group or department. A
competitive environment makes it
difficult to admit vulnerability, in
creasing a sense of loneliness, and
often leading students to believe that
they must be the only ones feeling
inept or insecure.
Within a university, academic work is
often accomplished in isolation. A
faculty member often works alone —
writing, reading, thinking, comput
ing — and faculty are not only
teachers and advisors, but also arc
role models for graduate students.

For those students writing theses in
particular, a sense of isolation can be
acute. It often seems as if, in order to
finish, it is necessary to cut off ties to
organizations, slop seeing friends
socially, and withdraw from any
other distractions. That intense
intellectual immersion can be very
stimulating, but if it continues for too
long a time, the isolation becomes
overwhelming.
Because of intense academic pres
sures and lime commitments,
sometimes it doesn't seem as if
personal relationships are possible to
combine with graduate work, and as
if one's other interests must be "put
on hold" for the duration of graduate
school. Single students, both men
and women, are often at a point in
their lives where they would like to
find future mates. They, in particu
lar, have concerns about the difficul
ties of developing meaningful
relationships in an environment
where time is at a premium and the
gender ratio is oddly skewed. There
is also concern about the conse
quences of waiting until they are "all
finished" before beginning the
"search," a singles' version of the
dilemma of the biological time clock.
Having to make undesirable trade
offs between graduate work and
relationships is not confined to single
students, of course, and the pressures
of graduate work, intense immersion
in studies, and accompanying role
confusion or change can wreak havoc
with established relationships. It is
more likely that you'll feel lonely and

isolated in an environment where it is
more difficult to establish or maintain
supportive personal relationships.
Thus, there are a number of structural
and cultural factors about graduate
study which can contribute to
feelings of isolation and loneliness.
Having painted a somehwat bleak
picture, what positive strategies can
be suggested? First, realize that to a
great extent, you are feeling and
experiencing emotions and dilem
mas common to many graduate
students; though it often seems as if
you're the only one with doubts,
fears, insecurities, you're far from
alone. Don't be afraid to talk with
other students about your feelings;
they'll probably be relieved to have a
chance to talk and share experiences.
Recognize that privacy, essential to
graduate study, and isolation arc two
different things; you can find privacy
when you need it, but avoid isolation
by developing tics to supportive
communities, whether in your
department, your residence, with
other student organizations at the
University or in the community
outside of Stanford. Spend some
time in social and recreational
activities. Find some ways of
expressing yourself and exploring
interests outside your academic work
(and don't feel guilty about taking
time for them!), whether it's involve
ment with family, recreational
interests, exercise, politics, art,
music, volunteer work, or other
pursuits.
I first went to graduate school,
there was an orientation meeting of all first
year students in my program. I remember sit
ting around a big conference table, listening
to each of them talk about who they were and
they came to be there, and thinking "I
don t have ANYTHING in common with these
people " Needless to say, over time and with
a snared common experience, I did find sup
port and friendship among those in the group.
However; that overwhelming initial impres
sion can characterize the beginnings of
graduate study — a time of challenge, growth,
stress, and often, loneliness and isolation.
What is it about graduate school that
can exacerbate those feelings of
loneliness and isolation? Often,
students come to graduate school
from some distance, leaving behind
friends and support structures, and in
some cases, families. The diversity
present among the graduate popula
tion at Stanford makes for an
enrichcd experience, but also means
that one is more apt to feel isolated or
lonely initially because it takes longer
to overcome cultural, language, age,
and other barriers. And if one is a
member of a minority group among
graduate students, whether a member
of an ethnic minority group, and
international student, or a woman, the
feelings of isolation may be in
creased.
Older students often leave positions
of responsibility in which they have
developed a certain reputation and
identity for themselves. They may
experience a loss of status upon
becoming "just a student" again, with
a bewildering accompaniment of loss
of self-esteem and confidence. As
"apprentice" scholars or profession
als, there is a feeling that somehow
even graduate students are not quite
yet adults or full, contributing
members of the University commu
nity. As one former student said, "It
doesn't matter who you are, what
you've done, or what you have to
offer, when you become a graduate
student, that's all you are."
Coupled with these changes in

community and status are academic
pressures. Once in graduate school,
there are high expectations for strong
academic performance and long
hours devoted to academic work.
Funding may depend upon academic
progress, and certainly it often seems
one's future will be determined by
success in graduate school. The
