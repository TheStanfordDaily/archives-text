## The
						Graduate Experience 
### CAROL MULLER, Ph. D 
I first went to graduate school,
there was an orientation meeting of all first
year students in my program. I remember sit
ting around a big conference table, listening
to each of them talk about who they were and
they came to be there, and thinking "I
don t have ANYTHING in common with these
people " Needless to say, over time and with
a snared common experience, I did find sup
port and friendship among those in the group.
However; that overwhelming initial impres
sion can characterize the beginnings of
graduate study â€” a time of challenge, growth,
stress, and often, loneliness and isolation.
