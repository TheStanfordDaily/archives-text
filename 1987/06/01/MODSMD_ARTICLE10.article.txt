# Graduate Study: Striving for Privacy Without Isolation
## 
### ALEJANDRO MARTINEZ, Ph.D. Psychologist 
Graduate study is a highly stressful,
highly demanding environment.
Students face many challenges and
programs expect clear intellectual focus
and commitment. Not only must
graduate students deal with the aca
demic environment, but they must
simultaneously contend with personal
and interpersonal issues.
How docs facing these demands affect
the health of graduate students? How do
these students vary in the ways they deal
with health issues? Are some graduate
students under greater stress than
others? Which respond by compromis
ing their health and which respond by
adapting? The 1986 Survey on the
Health of Stanford Students answers
some of these questions.

Psychological Weil-Being
SfTvey results suggest thata large
number of graduate students have

experienced at least one major personal
crisis at Stanford. Almost twice as many
women (57%) than men (30%) report
experiencing "something really, bad,
upsetting or traumatic that was difficult
to handle" since they enrolled at
Stanford.
The most frequent crises are partner
related, with 20% of the women and
12% of the men citing dissatisfaction
with the partner or the relationship,
sexual problems, rejection or breakup.
A proportionately higher number of men
identify the breakup of a relationship as
the event tliat was difficult to handle.
The second most frequently reported
area of stress is academics - academic
demands, problems, feelings of
inadequacy, problems with academic
relationships. Ten percent of graduate
women and 7% of graduate men report
at least one such event.
For women, health is the third most
stressful area. Sbe percent of the
surveyed women report a stressful
experience involving their personal
health, compared to 1% of men. More
women than men also report experi
ences involving the health of others,
family concerns, personal problems,
such as anxiety and depresssion, and the
death of a family member or friend.
It is reassuring to find that most of these
students talked with someone about
these stressors. Friends, family and
counselors were most often the people
talked with.
The Survey also explored students'
feelings about themselves. In a typical
month students often or always feel:

Body Image and Weight
More women worry about the way they
look than men. Thirty-six percent of the
graduate women, compared to 21 % of
graduate men reported they "often" or
"always" worry about the way they look.
Thirty-six percent of the women,
compared with 13% of the men, indi
cated they "often" or "always" worry
about their weight. It is not surprising,
therefore, that more women report

dieting. According to the survey, 22%
of the graduate women diet at least one
to times a month, compared to 10% of
graduate men. 60% of the men indicated
they never diet, compared to 35% of
women.
Health Behavior
Seat Belt Use: Eighty-eight percent of
graduate students use seat belts most of
the time while driving. When riding as
passengers, 81 %of women and 77% of
men buckle up most of the time.
Bicycle Riding: Close to two-thirds of
graduate students ride bicycles. Of
these, only 21 %of the women and 28%
of the men use helmets more than half of
the time.
Exercise: A majority of graduate
students participate in some sort of
exercise. 88%ofmenand71%of
women say they exercise at least one to
two times per week. 65% of women and
67% of men engage in vigorous
activities (e.g., jogging, aerobic dance,
swimming) one to two times a week or
more.
Sleep: Only 24% of graduate students
say they get sufficient sleep daily. 16%
indicate they have trouble sleeping one
to two times a week or more.
Drugs: Twenty-sevenpercentofthe
graduate students report using or having
tried marijuana, 12% report using or
having tried cocaine, 6% report using or
having tried psychedclics, and 2%
report using or having tried ecstacy.
Alcohol: Forty-seven percentof
graduate men, compared with 18% of
graduate women drink beer once or
twice a week or more. About 30% of
graduate students drink wine and about
7% drink hard liquor once or twice a
week or more. On average, graduate
men have 2.3 drinks per occasion,
compared with 1.8 drinks per occasion
for graduate women.
Sexual Health
Seventy-six percent of graduate
students are sexually active and indicate
that they need contraception. Of
sexually active graduate women, 11 %
do not use contraception each time they
are sexually active, compared to 19% of
the sexually active men. Nine percentof
sexually active graduate women report
an unplanned pregnancy since they have
been at Stanford, compared to 5% of the
men.
81 %of sexually active graduate
students say they discuss contraception
before they have sexual relations. Only
31 %of sexually active graduate women
and 26% of men discuss sexual health
(regarding sexually transmitted
diseases) before having sexual relations.
Conclusion?}
Overall the\9S6Surveyon theHealthof
Stanford Students shows a large number
of graduate students, particularly

women, reporting at least one signifi
cant life crisis since enrolling at
Stanford. This is in addition to the on
going and cummulative common
pressures inherent in graduate life.
The use of social support is encouraging.
All but one percent of the students talked
with friends, family or counselors about
the problems or situations troubling
them.
The ways graduate students take care of
themselves is also encouraging. A large
proportion report exercising and
infrequent use of substances such as
marijuana,cocaine,andecstacy. Asa
community, graduate student seem to
use alcohol in moderation. Few smoke
and almost half of the smokers are
planning to stop. A healthy regard for
safety is reflected in the high proportion
of graduate students who use seat belts.
However, there is an apparent lack of
communication about sexual health.
Also, while a majority of sexually active
graduate students use contraception
consistently, a small proportion do not.
This is an area in which graduate
students seem to most compromise their
health.
