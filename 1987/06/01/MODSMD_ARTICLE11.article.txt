As you prepare to leave the University,
you will need to find health care services
to replace Co well. Finding good health
care isn't as easy as it once was. Costs
have skyrocketed, health organizations
have changed and health care continues
to be an essential concern. When
fending completely for yourself, you
need to learn to take better care of
yourself and to become a more sophisti
cated health care consumers.
In the past we thought an ann ual exam
would take care of our health needs.
Actually, there are no good data
assessing the impact of a periodic exam
(PE) on the health of a population. Many
in the health care field agree that the
annual physical exam should be
discarded in favor of seeing a doctor for
particular health needs at different
stages of life.
Some questions and answers about
yearly exams, wellness, costs
to anticipate, and when to see a doctor
are briefly answered below. For specific
answers cr more information contact
Co well.
Q: Is A PERIODIC PHYSICAL EXAM
RECOMMENDED?
A: The actual health impact of such
screening is still unknown. Butfeefor
service and health-insurance plans built
up around screening are better adapted
to episodic therapeutic medicine that to
health maintenance. Some feel the
yearly exam is merely a boost for the
M.D.'spockctbook! Another concern is
that abnormalities that show up in
annual exams often require extensive
testing, and may not represent real
problems after all (i.e., they may be false
positives)
Q: WHY WAS THE PERIODIC PHYSICAL
EXAM INTRODUCED?
A: Around the turn of the century, under
the leadership of Dr. E.L. Fisk, the
exams came into vogue. Doctors
affiliated with insurance companies
were the first to advocate such exams.
The premises were that (1) adults can
harbor actual disease without experienc
ing symptoms, (2) PE can detect disease
at an early stage (3) the discovery of
disease can lead to its arrest, reversal or
cure.
Q: Is THERE ANY ACCEPTABLE REASON
FOR A ROUTINE PHYSICAL EXAM IN THE
ABSENCE OF SPECIFIC SYMPTOMS?
A: A patient requesting a complete PE
may actually be asking for reassurance,
so the doctor can perform a therapeutic
task rather than investigative procedure.
Q: IF I WERE TO ACCEPT THE IDEA THAT
AN ABNORMALITY MIGHT BE IDENTIFIED
AND THAT I MIGHT BENEFIT FROM
SUBSEQUENT TREATMENT OR CARE, HOW
MUCH SHOULD I EXPECT TO PAY FOR
"ROUTINE PHYSICAL" WITH LAB TESTS?
A: An average in this area for a routine
physical, as of February 1986:
Doctor $ 59.00
Blood Count.... $ 20.80
Urinalysis $ 14.30
Chest Xray $61.00
EKG $ 50.50
Blood Chemistry $40.80
TOTAL $246.40
Q: WIIAT HAVE I BEEN PAYING AT
Stanford for insurance and what
SHOULD I EXPECT TO PAY?
A: A student pays $324 per year with a
$100 deductible (high level plan).
Coverage is 80% of costs up to $3000,
then 100%. Conversion after graduation
will cost $89 per quarter for 3-6 months,
then you will need to get insurance on
your own. Costs on your own will vary
with Take Care, Kaiser, Blue Cross, etc.
The average for a group policy seems to
be $50 per month minimum.
Q: How DO I DECIDE WHICH DEDUCTIBLE

TO TAKE ON AN INSURANCE PLAN?
A: If you fit the situations below, you
may feel safe opting forahigh deduct
ible:
*You are not in a high risk category,
with pre-existing conditions - e.g.,
allergies, skin problems, diabetes,
gynecological problems, no previous
operations.
* You do not engage in any high risk
activities which could incur injury, such
as skiing, hangliding, rugby.
♦In the worse case scenario could you
muster up the money to cover the
deductible.
Q: Under what circumstances
SHOULD I SEE MY DOCTOR?
A: That depends on your ability to
practice good health habits. Be aware of
good nutrition, the benefits of exercise,
reducing stress and avoiding tobacco,
and reduce alcohol and drug use.
Understand self care—that will save
you time and money. When you do see
your doctor, ask questions and be sure
you get the answers you need.

RECOMMENDATIONS GIVEN THESE
GUIDELINES?
A: General Physical Exam- Few
authorities recommend such an exam at
all. Those that do maintain that every 5
years in young adulthood is sufficient.
Immunizations-should be updated at
any health visit. Diptheria-tetanus, for
example, should be given routinely
every 10 years.
TB Test-depends on exposure.
Obtain at time of travel or if in high risk
work.
Blood Prcssure-mav obtain at every
visit, at least every two years.
Papanicolou (PAP) Test-for cervical
cancer. Should be obtained annually,
unless you are in a monogamous sexual
relationship and have had with 3 normal
Pap tests in row.
Sexually Transmitted Disease Screen
depends on your level of sexually
activity and number of partners.
Chlamydia, genital warts and herpes are
the most com mon STDs on campus, but
there is no good way to screen for the
lattertwo. AIDS screening isinastateof
flux - stay tuned.
Anemia screen-hemoglobin level
every five years - more important in
women.
Cholesterol-evcrv 4-5 years. More
important if you have other cardiac risk
factors (such as smoking, overweight, or
hypertension).
Height and Wcight-everv 4-5 years.
Overweight exacerbates other health
risks such as smoking or hypertension.
Breast Exam-along with Pap tests.
Monthly self- exams arc encouraged.
Testicular Exam- Monthly self-exam
is encouraged.
Dental-every 6 months to two years.
