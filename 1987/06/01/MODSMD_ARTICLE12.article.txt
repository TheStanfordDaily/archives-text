# Procrastination: Putting Off For Tomorrow...

Procrastination seems to be part of the
human condition. To one extent or
another everyone puts things off. Some
chronic procrastinators characterize
themselves as individuals who seem to
be in a hurry taget nowhere, are late
getting there, and feel overburdened by
it. Other adjectives describing procras
tinators include undisciplined, careless,
disorderly, unorganized and on and on.
Procrastination generally takes two
forms; delaying the initiation of a
necessary task or staying on one
segment of a task instead of moving on
to another and consequently prolonging
the task, at times endlessly.
Procrastination is a complicated
phenomenon. Individuals cannot begin
to change until they understand the
functions it serves in their lives. There
must be recognition of the diversions
that obscure their own awareness.
The functions procrastination serves in
our lives are multidimensional, having
different meanings. Delaying the
mailing of a $5 rebate may be general
indifference towards the coupon and
thus a simple and trivial problem. In
contrast, a pattern of showing up late for
appointments, not returning calls,
delaying follow-through on commit
ments, characteristically missing
deadlines, continually putting off the
beginning of lab work, getting stuck
reviewing literature instead of begin
ning to write, and a growing list of
incompletes reflects more complex
problems.
Procrastinating on important tasks may
very well be healthy signaling that a
reassessment of life direction is in order.
It may, for example, be a sign that a
career decision or other major re
evaluation is needed. In many cases the
procrastination may continue until this
message is heeded.

At other levels, procrastination can
signal time mismanagement, or more
commonly, a way of expressing internal
conflict and protecting a vulnerable
sense of self-esteem.
Understanding the causes of procrasti
nation isn't in itself a cure, but insight
often can be a major catalyst to effec
tively deal with the problem. Equally
important in modifying procrastination
is examining the actual process to reveal
where delays are likely to occur.
Most people are aware that the hardest
part of a given task often is getting
started. This is because the beginning of
an activity requires more structure and
decisions than later aspects of the task or
other activities. Since increased
cognitive demands typically heighten
our level of anxiety, it is not surprising
that individuals "slip" into activities that
reduce or postpone the anxiety. Of
course, the reduction of anxiety is on a
short term basis. For instance, when
working on an article or paper, time
spent in preparatory reading or getting
the desk ready for work represents
alternate behaviors which are initally
less stressful than writing. This happens
because these behaviors do not require
individuals to organize, clarify or define
their thoughts or to make decisions on
how to best express them. Once a task is
initiated, inividuals arc not likely to
procrastinate until a decision point is
reached again. Unfortunately, in
academic work decision points are
frequent, particularly between compo
nents of the task.
Other significant aspects of the procras
tination process are decisons that are
made between direct work-related tasks
and other activities. While work-related
demands are generally perceived as long
term tasks (a paper may be expected to
take several weeks, a dissertation at least
a year), non-work activities (cleaning
one's room, watching T. V.) are per
ceived as expenditures of small time
segments. The cost of choosing alow
priority activity, such as watching T. V.,
instead of a high priority activity, such as
a paper which will take two weeks, is not
perceived as very high. It is only a half
hour after all. Only in retrospect is the
total cost of these decisions fully
realized.
To convince one's self that these small
diversions are not serious threats to
work, a person often remains in the
setting where they could work if they
stopped procrastinating. Invitations to
go to the movies or the bcach may be
turned down with good intentions of
working. Yetoneremainsinthework

No wonder it is a very difficult problem
to master, given the complexities of
procrastination. Developing a personal
understanding of the causes of procrasti
nation and an openess to confront the
issues raised by this understanding is an
