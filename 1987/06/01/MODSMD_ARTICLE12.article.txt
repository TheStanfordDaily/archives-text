# Procrastination: Putting Off For Tomorrow...
## 
### DOUG DAHER.Ph.D., ALEJANDRO MARTINEZ, Ph.D Psychologists at CAPS 
Procrastination seems to be part of the
human condition. To one extent or
another everyone puts things off. Some
chronic procrastinators characterize
themselves as individuals who seem to
be in a hurry taget nowhere, are late
getting there, and feel overburdened by
it. Other adjectives describing procras
tinators include undisciplined, careless,
disorderly, unorganized and on and on.
Procrastination generally takes two
forms; delaying the initiation of a
necessary task or staying on one
segment of a task instead of moving on
to another and consequently prolonging
the task, at times endlessly.
Procrastination is a complicated
phenomenon. Individuals cannot begin
to change until they understand the
functions it serves in their lives. There
must be recognition of the diversions
that obscure their own awareness.
The functions procrastination serves in
our lives are multidimensional, having
different meanings. Delaying the
mailing of a $5 rebate may be general
indifference towards the coupon and
thus a simple and trivial problem. In
contrast, a pattern of showing up late for
appointments, not returning calls,
delaying follow-through on commit
ments, characteristically missing
deadlines, continually putting off the
beginning of lab work, getting stuck
reviewing literature instead of begin
ning to write, and a growing list of
incompletes reflects more complex
problems.
Procrastinating on important tasks may
very well be healthy signaling that a
reassessment of life direction is in order.
It may, for example, be a sign that a
career decision or other major re
evaluation is needed. In many cases the
procrastination may continue until this
message is heeded.

At other levels, procrastination can
signal time mismanagement, or more
commonly, a way of expressing internal
conflict and protecting a vulnerable
sense of self-esteem.
Understanding the causes of procrasti
nation isn't in itself a cure, but insight
often can be a major catalyst to effec
tively deal with the problem. Equally
important in modifying procrastination
is examining the actual process to reveal
where delays are likely to occur.
Most people are aware that the hardest
part of a given task often is getting
started. This is because the beginning of
an activity requires more structure and
decisions than later aspects of the task or
other activities. Since increased
cognitive demands typically heighten
our level of anxiety, it is not surprising
that individuals "slip" into activities that
reduce or postpone the anxiety. Of
course, the reduction of anxiety is on a
short term basis. For instance, when
working on an article or paper, time
spent in preparatory reading or getting
the desk ready for work represents
alternate behaviors which are initally
less stressful than writing. This happens
because these behaviors do not require
individuals to organize, clarify or define
their thoughts or to make decisions on
how to best express them. Once a task is
initiated, inividuals arc not likely to
procrastinate until a decision point is
reached again. Unfortunately, in
academic work decision points are
frequent, particularly between compo
nents of the task.
Other significant aspects of the procras
tination process are decisons that are
made between direct work-related tasks
and other activities. While work-related
demands are generally perceived as long
term tasks (a paper may be expected to
take several weeks, a dissertation at least
a year), non-work activities (cleaning
one's room, watching T. V.) are per
ceived as expenditures of small time
segments. The cost of choosing alow
priority activity, such as watching T. V.,
instead of a high priority activity, such as
a paper which will take two weeks, is not
perceived as very high. It is only a half
hour after all. Only in retrospect is the
total cost of these decisions fully
realized.
To convince one's self that these small
diversions are not serious threats to
work, a person often remains in the
setting where they could work if they
stopped procrastinating. Invitations to
go to the movies or the bcach may be
turned down with good intentions of
working. Yetoneremainsinthework
environment doing other activities
which unsuspectingly take up the work
time. The day or evening is over with
little accomplished.
No wonder it is a very difficult problem
to master, given the complexities of
procrastination. Developing a personal
understanding of the causes of procrasti
nation and an openess to confront the
issues raised by this understanding is an

essential step. In a sample of 79
Stanford graduate students who
participated in six week workshops on
procrastination we compared students'
expectations of their work hours to
actual time worked. We found that
• people work far less than they expected
to
• students with higher expectations of
the number of work hours per
week typically worked more actual
hours than their counterparts with lower
expectations
This suggests that those students most
limited by procrastination have lower
expectations of their work output. The
relationship between lower expecta
tions and minimal work effort may
signal burnout. Said otherwise, a sign of
burnout may be very low to nonexistent
expectations of one's work.
Another pattern that is often visible for
procrastinating graduate students is
problematic advisor relationships. The
workshop data confirms that students
who procrastinate have a tendency to
avoid contact with their advisors.
Ambivalence, lack of asscrtiveness,
ambiguous expectations and a variety of
communication problems emerged as

issues in the advisor-advisee relation
ship. Over 95% of these students
reported a loss of self-confidence and
94% indicated emotional suites that
interfere with academic progress.
Procrastination involves not only issues
of time and behavioral management, but
also interpersonal themes which
contribute to the complexity of the issue,
and its resistance to change.
Some practical tips that can help
include:
• set deadlines: build in short-term
goals in the service of a long
term project
• reward yourself for each subgoal
achieved
• use reminders: put reminders on
your calendar; write notes to
yourself and put them in places you
will be sure to notice
• handle materials only once: don't
move piles of papers around,
make a decision about your materials
now
• map out the steps of a work plan

• delegate certain tasks to others who
might do them more effectively or
efficiently (pay someone toenter data
or type)
• rely on colleagues for feedback
which can stimulate new ideas:
you don't have to work in isolation
• find people you can work with and

who can be encouraging of your
efforts ,

another everyone puts things off. Some
chronic procrastinators characterize
themselves as individuals who seem to
be in a hurry taget nowhere, are late
getting there, and feel overburdened by
it. Other adjectives describing procras
tinators include undisciplined, careless,
disorderly, unorganized and on and on.
Procrastination generally takes two
forms; delaying the initiation of a
necessary task or staying on one
segment of a task instead of moving on
to another and consequently prolonging
the task, at times endlessly.
Procrastination is a complicated
phenomenon. Individuals cannot begin
to change until they understand the
functions it serves in their lives. There
must be recognition of the diversions
that obscure their own awareness.
The functions procrastination serves in
our lives are multidimensional, having
different meanings. Delaying the
mailing of a $5 rebate may be general
indifference towards the coupon and
thus a simple and trivial problem. In
contrast, a pattern of showing up late for
appointments, not returning calls,
delaying follow-through on commit
ments, characteristically missing
deadlines, continually putting off the
beginning of lab work, getting stuck
reviewing literature instead of begin
ning to write, and a growing list of
incompletes reflects more complex
problems.
Procrastinating on important tasks may
very well be healthy signaling that a
reassessment of life direction is in order.
It may, for example, be a sign that a
career decision or other major re
evaluation is needed. In many cases the
procrastination may continue until this
message is heeded.

At other levels, procrastination can
signal time mismanagement, or more
commonly, a way of expressing internal
conflict and protecting a vulnerable
sense of self-esteem.
Understanding the causes of procrasti
nation isn't in itself a cure, but insight
often can be a major catalyst to effec
tively deal with the problem. Equally
important in modifying procrastination
is examining the actual process to reveal
where delays are likely to occur.
Most people are aware that the hardest
part of a given task often is getting
started. This is because the beginning of
an activity requires more structure and
decisions than later aspects of the task or
other activities. Since increased
cognitive demands typically heighten
our level of anxiety, it is not surprising
that individuals "slip" into activities that
reduce or postpone the anxiety. Of
course, the reduction of anxiety is on a
short term basis. For instance, when
working on an article or paper, time
spent in preparatory reading or getting
the desk ready for work represents
alternate behaviors which are initally
less stressful than writing. This happens
because these behaviors do not require
individuals to organize, clarify or define
their thoughts or to make decisions on
how to best express them. Once a task is
initiated, inividuals arc not likely to
procrastinate until a decision point is
reached again. Unfortunately, in
academic work decision points are
frequent, particularly between compo
nents of the task.
Other significant aspects of the procras
tination process are decisons that are
made between direct work-related tasks
and other activities. While work-related
demands are generally perceived as long
term tasks (a paper may be expected to
take several weeks, a dissertation at least
a year), non-work activities (cleaning
one's room, watching T. V.) are per
ceived as expenditures of small time
segments. The cost of choosing alow
priority activity, such as watching T. V.,
instead of a high priority activity, such as
a paper which will take two weeks, is not
perceived as very high. It is only a half
hour after all. Only in retrospect is the
total cost of these decisions fully
realized.
To convince one's self that these small
diversions are not serious threats to
work, a person often remains in the
setting where they could work if they
stopped procrastinating. Invitations to
go to the movies or the bcach may be
turned down with good intentions of
working. Yetoneremainsinthework
environment doing other activities
which unsuspectingly take up the work
time. The day or evening is over with
little accomplished.
No wonder it is a very difficult problem
to master, given the complexities of
procrastination. Developing a personal
understanding of the causes of procrasti
nation and an openess to confront the
issues raised by this understanding is an

essential step. In a sample of 79
Stanford graduate students who
participated in six week workshops on
procrastination we compared students'
expectations of their work hours to
actual time worked. We found that
• people work far less than they expected
to
• students with higher expectations of
the number of work hours per
week typically worked more actual
hours than their counterparts with lower
expectations
This suggests that those students most
limited by procrastination have lower
expectations of their work output. The
relationship between lower expecta
tions and minimal work effort may
signal burnout. Said otherwise, a sign of
burnout may be very low to nonexistent
expectations of one's work.
Another pattern that is often visible for
procrastinating graduate students is
problematic advisor relationships. The
workshop data confirms that students
who procrastinate have a tendency to
avoid contact with their advisors.
Ambivalence, lack of asscrtiveness,
ambiguous expectations and a variety of
communication problems emerged as

issues in the advisor-advisee relation
ship. Over 95% of these students
reported a loss of self-confidence and
94% indicated emotional suites that
interfere with academic progress.
Procrastination involves not only issues
of time and behavioral management, but
also interpersonal themes which
contribute to the complexity of the issue,
and its resistance to change.
Some practical tips that can help
include:
• set deadlines: build in short-term
goals in the service of a long
term project
• reward yourself for each subgoal
achieved
• use reminders: put reminders on
your calendar; write notes to
yourself and put them in places you
will be sure to notice
• handle materials only once: don't
move piles of papers around,
make a decision about your materials
now
• map out the steps of a work plan

• delegate certain tasks to others who
might do them more effectively or
efficiently (pay someone toenter data
or type)
• rely on colleagues for feedback
which can stimulate new ideas:
you don't have to work in isolation
• find people you can work with and

who can be encouraging of your
efforts ,
