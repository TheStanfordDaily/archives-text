ON BEING
AGRADUATE STUDENT
When most people think of students in a university, the first
image that comes to mind is a person somewhere between 18
and 22 years of age. At Stanford, that picture describes only
about half of the students. The other half of Stanford stu
dents are graduate students.
Most are well into their twenties or older and have had
significant experience in adult roles. A great many of Stan
ford graduate students have worked, some are married and
some have children. A significant proportion of graduate
students are from other countries and cultures. All have
interesting academic and intellectual challenges. Being a
graduate student is a unique and noteworthy experience in
one's personal and professional development.
We have devoted this issue of The Student Body to the gradu
ate student experience. The topics covered range from dual
career considerations to eating on the run, the health con
cerns of graduate students to procrastination, loneliness to
contraception for women over 35. Our hope is that Stanford
students recognize some of the challenges of graduate life
and find this information illuminating.
