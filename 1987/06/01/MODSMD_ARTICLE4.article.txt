# Women in the Sciences: Lacking Confidence, Lacking Respect

'It is clear from our findings that
Stanford has succeeded in attracting
a highly qualified group of women
students to its graduate programs in
science, engineering and medicine
without compromising academic
excellence"
This is perhaps the most important
outcome of a 1985 study comparing
male and female graduate students in
science, engineering and medicine at
Stanford. Although our study showed
no significant differences between men
and women in intellectual and aca
demic accomplishments, the myth
persists that women students in the
sciences are somehow less prepared or
able than male students. Subtle and
often not-so-subtle suggestions that
women are not sufficiently motivated,
dedicated, talented, etc. still surface
with disturbing frequency.
It seems important to review some of
the principal findings of the 1985
survey as information is useful in
dispelling myths.
The Stanford Survey
A questionnaire was sent to all women
and to an equal number of randomly
selected male graduate students in the
fields of science, engineering and
medical sciences (including the M.D.
program) at Stanford. Three hundred
twenty-eight (328) women and 299
men responded, for a 54 % response
rate.
Results
Remarkable similarities between the
men and women were demonstrated.
The men and women studied exhibited
a high degree of professional commit
ment and interest, and healthy perspec
tives of themselves and their work.
They possessed impressive credentials
and previous experiences, and they
used their resources wisely to meet the
challenges presented by their studies.
They sought solutions rather than
external izing their discontent, and
appeared to be well-suited to the
university environment they had
chosen. In general, the overall
impression is one of an intelligent
group of men and women who are
dedicated to thepursuitof clearly held
objectives.
The men and women in the group
reported no significant differences in

most aspects of their graduate school
experience. Neither group differed
substantially on the academic records
and experiences they brought with
them to graduate school. Both men and
women reported a grade-point average
of approximately 3.58.
There were no significant differences
between men and women in their
cumulative scores on the GRE or
MCAT exams. While both men and
women averaged more than 700 points
on the math section of the GRE, men
scored higher than women in this area.
Women scored higher on the verbal
section and higher, but not signifi
cantly so, on the analytical section.
There were no significant differences
between men and women medical
students on the MCAT. Similarly,
there was no difference between men
and women in the average number of
undergraduate honors. Both men and
women were pleased with their
progress in graduate school and had no
plans to change their degree programs,
advisors or university.
While the general picture is positive,
there are some areas which merit
further discussion. Despite similarities
in academic background, the men and
women in the sample differ signifi
cantly in their self-assessments in
science and mathematics - two areas of
central importance to their chosen
fields of study. While both men and
women felt competent in these areas in
high school, this sense of competence
decreased for women, but not for men,
at the level of college science and math.
Additionally, women felt their
academic preparation for graduate
school was less adequate than did the
men. This is particularly remarkable
since women entered graduate school
with excellent test scores and academic
records.
It appears that women significantly
underestimate the level of competence
and intellectual ability they bring to
their graduate studies in science,
engineering and medicine. They may
perceive some lack of advanced
preparation in particular specialities
and subspecialties necessary for their
fields of study. These perceptions may
or may not be accurate. Women should
carefully assess the expertise and
intellectual abilities they bring to their
discipline. Such an assessment would
allow identification of areas where
more advanced training would be
useful.
Women may not be alone in underesti
mating their capabilities. Our findings
refute assertions that, because of
affirmative action quotas, less
qualified women are admitted to
graduate programs in science, engi
neering and medicine. The following
quote illustrates this loss of self
confidence:
Female in engineering and physical
sciences: "Many times females seem
to be "questioned" rather than simply
accepted when making
technical statements."
The issue of women, and perhaps
others, underestimating their skill and
potential is a consistent theme emerg
ing from the study.
One of the principal areas in which the
men and women differ is in self
confidence and assertiveness. Women
reported feeling less certain of their
ability, less trusting of their own
judgmentand more afraid of making
mistakes than did men. Women also
reported more difficulty setting limits
and negotiating for their needs. The
picture that emerges of the women in
our sample is similar to that of women
in other non-traditional occupations.
When women are relatively new to a
field and are present in small numbers,
they report feeling less confident of
their abilities, less willing to take risks,
and less able to negotiate for their
needs.
From a psychological perspective, it is
not difficult to understand how this
issue of minority status would help
undermine a woman's sense of her own
efficacy and capabilities. By virtueof
low numbers, one's visibility is
increased. Higher visibility may
reduce the probability of risk-taking,
particularly if one is uncertain about his
or her competence. Decreased risk
taking diminishes the opportunity to
learn from mistakes and to develop a
sense of confidence in one's judgment
and ability. Thus the cycle can be self
perpetuating. Less isolation and
visibility, coupled with greater
experience, would be to women's
advantage.
Our research revealed significant
differences by field on the issue of self
confidence. In those fields in which
women were present in the largest
numbers - medicine, biological and
medical sciences - women reported the
least amount of self-doubt, and were
more likely to assert themselves. We
hypothesized that some critical number
of female colleagues is necessary to
enhance the psychological well-being
of women in such non-traditional

fields.
Another area of critical importance in
graduate student life is the relationship
with one's advisor. Here men and
women differ most dramatically.
Women reported being less certain of
he support and acknowledgment they
receive from their advisors; regardless
of the sex of the advisor. In some
instances, women students felt more
confident of assessment by male
advisors than by female advisors.
One important issue that emerged from
the survey is the greater access that men
have to informal interaction with their
advisors outside of the advisor-advisee
relationship. This is illustrated by the
lollowing comments:
Female in engineering and physical
science:" I don't go hiking with
my advisor. Idon'teatlunchwithmy
advisor. I don't bullshit with my
advisor like the boys do."
Female in engineering and physical
science: "No difficulties, (with my
advisor) but it would be easier if we
could pal around. Then 1 would
get more casual type guidance."
The contrast in experience with
advisors is illustrated by the following:
Male in engineering and physical
science: "[My advisor has] gone out of
[his] way time and time again for me -
always willing to help with a variety of
problems (academic and nonac
ademic) and he's an all
round great guy!!
Female in biological and medical
sciences: "He's very busy, so
discussions with him are never
rambling exchanges of ideas, but are
fairly cut and dried."
\ question which needs examination
is, "How and under whatcircum
stances do women and their faculty
advisors construct barriers to effective
communication and collcgial inter
change?"
While our research identifies many
ways in which men and women share a
common perception and experieince of
graduate school, the ways in which
they differ can substantially alter the
nature of the experience.
