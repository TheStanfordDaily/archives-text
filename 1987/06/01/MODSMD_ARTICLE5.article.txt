# Searching for Contraception After 35
## 
### AN A CUPP, C.H.N.P. Nurse Practitioner at Cowell 
At Stanford there are 665 students over
theageof3s (2400f which are
women). Although statistical informa
tion is readily available on contracep
tive use in younger women nationwide,
little is known aboutthis subjectfor
women over the age of 3 5.
According to international reproduc
tive health researchers, women over4o
are more likely to take a chance with
unprotected intercourse than any other
age group. These researchers recently
pulled together data from several
national samples, finding that steriliza
tion - either their own (tubal ligation) or
their partners (vasectomy) - is the
current method of choice for 40% of
women between the ages of4o-44.
Another 25% use other methods of
contraception, with condoms ranking
as the most commonly used reversible
method.
Approximately 4% of the women over
40 use oral contraceptives. There is
more medical controversy regarding
pill use by women 35-40 years old than
any other method. It is well known that
the serious side effects of combination
birth control pills (estrogen and
progesterone) increase at age 35 in
nonsmokers, and earlier in smokers.
These serious cardiovascular side
effects are heart attacks, strokes, and
blood clots in the legs, pelvis, and
1 ungs. The risk is very small in women
who are young, healthy and nonsmok
ers, but increases for smokers of any
age and for women over 35. It is
accepted practice to have women
discontinue the combination pill at age
35 if they are nonsmokers and at age 30
if they are smokers, due to these
possibly life threatening side effects.
Noncontraceptive benefits of oral
contraceptives should be considered in
a discussion of pill use for nonsmoking
women overage 35. There is a good
deal of evidence to suggest that the pill
protects women against ovarian and
endometrial cancer. This protective
effect appears to persist for a number of
years after pills have been discontin
ued.
Progesterone-only birth control pills -
called the mini pill - may be an option
for women over 35, or over 30 who
smoke cigarettes, but the side effects of
this type of pill must be considered
before adopting this contraceptive
option. 40% of women using mini pills
consistently ovulate, therefore, the

mini pill is not as effective in prevent
ing pregnancy as the combination pill.
Irregular menses, spotting and missed
periods are the side effects most often
encountered by women using the mini
pill. There is a danger that irregular
bleeding might incorrectly be attrib
uted to mini pi lis and that other more
ominous causes might not be evaluated
appropriately.
Intrauterine devices were an option for
women ages 35-50 when inert devices,
which could be inserted and left in
place, were available. Due to many
lawsuits over the side effects of the
lUD's, they are no longer available in
the United States. The only available
lUD is the Progestasert which releases
small amounts of progesterone, thus
enhancing contraceptive effects. The
Progestasert lUD m ust be replaced
once a year. Women who use lUD's
are at an increased risk of sexually
transmitted diseases, pelvic inflamma
tory disease (PID), infertility and
ectopic pregnancy. This may still be an
effective method for women who are in
monogamous relationships and thus
not at great risk for sexually transmit
ted diseases. Those women who have
already had a full-term pregnancy tend
to have fewer side effects with lUDs.
At this time lUD's are not inserted at
Cowell Student Health Service, but
referrals may be obtained to physicians
in private practice who will insert
lUDs.
Other options such as condoms, foam,
sponges, cervical caps and diaphragms
■ ffectively prevent conception as well
~s afford some protection against
sexually transmitted diseases. Foam
and condoms used together areas
effective in preventing pregnancy as
the combination birth control pills and
are more effective than the mini pill or
any of the above methods used alone.
Contraception for the woman between
35 and menopause can be achieved in
many different ways. The decision
making process must include consid
erations about the desire for future
childbearing, a thorough understand
ing of possible side effects and the
acceptability of the contraceptive
method to both partners. Clarification
of these issues may be ac hieved by
discussing contraceptive options with
your partner and
your family planning nurse practitioner
or physician.
