# Two Career Couples: Blessed or Burdened?

They have it all. Money, status - a house
in the Hamptons; ski trips to Aspen;
summers in France; a nanny for the
children. But, do they?
Saturday morning is filled with all the
tasks thatcan'tgetdoneduring the
week. The baby sitter docs not show up
for work on Friday and both parents
have meetings at nine o'clock that
require their presence. He has an
opportunity for a promotion that
requires a move to Atlanta; she is
working towards becoming a partner of
I the law firm in Manhattan. A glamorous
life - for some, perhaps. For most, dual
careers bring rewards and a significant
amount of anxiety as the couple faces
daily issues that were, for the most part,
not a feature of the lives of their parents.
Most of today's undergraduate and
graduate students are the children of the
postwar American dream - a dream

which had mother happily ensconced in
the home while father went out daily to
earn the money which carried the family
upwards in levels of possessions and in
social status. As costs of living in
America rose, and as children grew,
mothers moved out into the workplace.
During the late sixties and seventies,
womens' roles and opportunities began
to change, and women began to take
advantage of educational possibilities to
enter the professional and business
worlds with increasing frequency.
Many of the mothers of the 1950's
returned to school; some at the same
time as their daughters. Neither mother
nor daughter had many role models, and
both faced questions about the pathways
each had chosen.
What became clear was that when both
partners work at committed careers,
issues and conflicts arise that can affect a
couple - at whatever point they are in
their lives. Concerns may differ for a
young couple just starting out in their
careers but the strains that affect a
twenty-year marriage when the husband
wantsto slow down while the wife has
just become an attorney are equally as
painful and potentially as divisive.
Much has been written about the lack of
models for career women in relation
ships; little has been written about the
same lack that exists for menpartnered
with career women.
With more than 50% of women in the
workplace, it is apparent that most of
today's university graduates will be
dealing with the issue of how to blend
career, marriage, and children. The two
person, one-career family appears to be
headed towards oblivion. It may be that
for periods of time when parenting, one
or the other parent may elect to remain
home for a while. On the whole, it is
likely that the fulltime stay-at-home
spouse wil 1 be a distinct minority.
An examination of the conflicts that face
a couple in the early years of their
relationship reveals that most of the
tension revolves around the establish
ment of careers. Priorities must be
negotiated and the hard question is
raised as to whether the two careers are
equal or is one subordinate? The
implicit question might be asked as
follows: What kind of support will you
give and what kind of help will you be
for my career? The major negotiations
during these early years are those which
are career-based:
- how to synchronize education/training
needs and locations
- how to synchronize jobs with respect
to location and demand.
In addition, negotiations must also take
place about specific home life issues:
- how to balance and share household
tasks
- how to have fun and time together in the
midst of ambition and striving
Each career brings with it differing
demands upon time and commitment
Flexibility becomes an increasing
requirementas the possibility of
children is considered. It issad but none

the less true that there is no single source
of tension within a two-career couple
greater than the inclusion of children in
their lives. The issues raised include:
— the collision course of career
development and the bearing of
children. This is especially critical for
women when the biological imperative
often runs up against institutional
expectations of performance for career
advancement.
— the addition of the parental role and
tasks to individuals who are already
over-extended. This issue raises
questions once again, about how much
each partner is willing to compromise in
order to assist the other in achieving a
balance between work and home. *
— the sharing of responsibility.
Whose priorities deserve priority?
—quality of parenting and quality of
life issues. Two career couples charac
teristically strive to be the best at what
they do. Trying to be the best parent; the
best professional; and the best of
everything else (community volunteer,
lover) exacts a toll. Women have been
socialized to feel that it is their responsi
bility to worry about the children and the
household; men do not usually keep in
their minds what foodstuffs or laundry
detergents are missing. The pressure on
women to achieve on every front
continues to be a societal problem that
exists today.
— societal pressures to conform to
the myth of the need for mother to
remain at home. Such pressures come
from the fact that, in contrast to the other
major industrial nations of the western
world, American society does not
provide sufficient quality daycare at
reasonable cost for all children in need.
We continue to hear about the inadequa
cies of daycare without much recogni
tion that it is now a fact of life for many in
this country. The workplace has only
partially responded to the changing
demographics of family life. Theideaof
paternity leave is laughed at in most
boardrooms. It is indeed difficult to
underestimate the impact of society's
negative sanctions on two career
couples.
A couple starting out in a two career
relationship must forego competition
and work cooperatively by developing
clear agreement on the following issues:
1. setting priorities
2. that each person's career is
important
3. action and behaviors on the part of
the man that support the woman' s career
as important as his own.
4. acceptance of the fact that we may
be unable to pursue a career in as single
minded fashion as our colleagues.
5. Acceptance of the fact that family
life may significantly differ from that
with which we grew up.
6. Acceptance of the importance of
family life with respect to work life.
7. the need to compromise.
With a foundation such as this, two
people can build a relationship that will
survive the vagaries of the many issues
that dual career couples face.

life - for some, perhaps. For most, dual
careers bring rewards and a significant
amount of anxiety as the couple faces
daily issues that were, for the most part,
not a feature of the lives of their parents.
Most of today's undergraduate and
graduate students are the children of the
postwar American dream - a dream

which had mother happily ensconced in
the home while father went out daily to
earn the money which carried the family
upwards in levels of possessions and in
social status. As costs of living in
America rose, and as children grew,
mothers moved out into the workplace.
During the late sixties and seventies,
womens' roles and opportunities began
to change, and women began to take
advantage of educational possibilities to
enter the professional and business
worlds with increasing frequency.
Many of the mothers of the 1950's
returned to school; some at the same
time as their daughters. Neither mother
nor daughter had many role models, and
both faced questions about the pathways
each had chosen.
What became clear was that when both
partners work at committed careers,
issues and conflicts arise that can affect a
couple - at whatever point they are in
their lives. Concerns may differ for a
young couple just starting out in their
careers but the strains that affect a
twenty-year marriage when the husband
wantsto slow down while the wife has
just become an attorney are equally as
painful and potentially as divisive.
Much has been written about the lack of
models for career women in relation
ships; little has been written about the
same lack that exists for menpartnered
with career women.
With more than 50% of women in the
workplace, it is apparent that most of
today's university graduates will be
dealing with the issue of how to blend
career, marriage, and children. The two
person, one-career family appears to be
headed towards oblivion. It may be that
for periods of time when parenting, one
or the other parent may elect to remain
home for a while. On the whole, it is
likely that the fulltime stay-at-home
spouse wil 1 be a distinct minority.
An examination of the conflicts that face
a couple in the early years of their
relationship reveals that most of the
tension revolves around the establish
ment of careers. Priorities must be
negotiated and the hard question is
raised as to whether the two careers are
equal or is one subordinate? The
implicit question might be asked as
follows: What kind of support will you
give and what kind of help will you be
for my career? The major negotiations
during these early years are those which
are career-based:
- how to synchronize education/training
needs and locations
- how to synchronize jobs with respect
to location and demand.
In addition, negotiations must also take
place about specific home life issues:
- how to balance and share household
tasks
- how to have fun and time together in the
midst of ambition and striving
Each career brings with it differing
demands upon time and commitment
Flexibility becomes an increasing
requirementas the possibility of
children is considered. It issad but none

the less true that there is no single source
of tension within a two-career couple
greater than the inclusion of children in
their lives. The issues raised include:
— the collision course of career
development and the bearing of
children. This is especially critical for
women when the biological imperative
often runs up against institutional
expectations of performance for career
advancement.
— the addition of the parental role and
tasks to individuals who are already
over-extended. This issue raises
questions once again, about how much
each partner is willing to compromise in
order to assist the other in achieving a
balance between work and home. *
— the sharing of responsibility.
Whose priorities deserve priority?
—quality of parenting and quality of
life issues. Two career couples charac
teristically strive to be the best at what
they do. Trying to be the best parent; the
best professional; and the best of
everything else (community volunteer,
lover) exacts a toll. Women have been
socialized to feel that it is their responsi
bility to worry about the children and the
household; men do not usually keep in
their minds what foodstuffs or laundry
detergents are missing. The pressure on
women to achieve on every front
continues to be a societal problem that
exists today.
— societal pressures to conform to
the myth of the need for mother to
remain at home. Such pressures come
from the fact that, in contrast to the other
major industrial nations of the western
world, American society does not
provide sufficient quality daycare at
reasonable cost for all children in need.
We continue to hear about the inadequa
cies of daycare without much recogni
tion that it is now a fact of life for many in
this country. The workplace has only
partially responded to the changing
demographics of family life. Theideaof
paternity leave is laughed at in most
boardrooms. It is indeed difficult to
underestimate the impact of society's
negative sanctions on two career
couples.
A couple starting out in a two career
relationship must forego competition
and work cooperatively by developing
clear agreement on the following issues:
1. setting priorities
2. that each person's career is
important
3. action and behaviors on the part of
the man that support the woman' s career
as important as his own.
4. acceptance of the fact that we may
be unable to pursue a career in as single
minded fashion as our colleagues.
5. Acceptance of the fact that family
life may significantly differ from that
with which we grew up.
6. Acceptance of the importance of
family life with respect to work life.
7. the need to compromise.
With a foundation such as this, two
people can build a relationship that will
survive the vagaries of the many issues
that dual career couples face.

They have it all. Money, status - a house
in the Hamptons; ski trips to Aspen;
summers in France; a nanny for the
children. But, do they?
Saturday morning is filled with all the
tasks thatcan'tgetdoneduring the
week. The baby sitter docs not show up
for work on Friday and both parents
have meetings at nine o'clock that
require their presence. He has an
opportunity for a promotion that
requires a move to Atlanta; she is
