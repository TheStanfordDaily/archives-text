# Single Parents' Resources at Stanford
## 
### PATRICIA POLHEMUS Director, Graduate Student Housing 
There are vast numbers of single parents
in America. Thirty five of them are
students at Stanford and live in Escon
dido Village. Many of them are in the
School of Education, some are in
Humanities and Sciences, some are in
professional schools. One is an under
graduate. Some have never been
married. Mostare divorced. Most are
women.
Most graduate students at Stanford are
men. If they havechildren they almost
always have wives who take primary
responsibility for the cooking, cleaning',
and child care. Many wives also work
outside the home or take care of other
people's children during the day.
Graduate students are very busy and it's
been said that all women in Escondido
Village sometimes feel like single
parents - the men are under so much
pressure and are away much of the time.
Single parents carry the full academic
load of other graduate students. They
are also responsible for the care of the
children, cooking and cleaning.
Clearly there are additional financial
burdens of single parents who are
students. For example, full time
childcare for one child at Stanford costs
about $6000 per year. However, $3000
per year for child support is considered
to be good. Many single parents receive
no child support. At Stanford, stipends
are the same for students without
children and students with children.
Rent, car payments, and health care for
' children cost the same whether you are
married or not. Legal fees often add to
the burden of the single parent.
It is important to remember that the

people who are dealing with these issues
do not look in the mirror in the morning
and see "SINGLE PARENT'. They
enjoy their school work and they love
their children. They have difficulty
taking time out to socialize but they find
themselves less lonely than many single
graduate students who don' t have
children. Some talk about being less
lonely than they were when they were
unhappily married. For some, children
give a welcome structure to life, a sense
of direction and increased meaning to
their studies. Single parents take part in
neighborhood activities and find that
children give them a reason to do lots of
enjoyable things they wouldn't do by
themselves.
