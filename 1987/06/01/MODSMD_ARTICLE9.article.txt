# Eating on the Run

### LAURA BRAININ-RODGRIGUEZ Nutritionist at Cowell 
When faced with limited time and
money, graduate students and their
families may have problems eating
healthy foods. This can be further
complicated for foreign students having
to adapt to different kinds of foods.
Suddenly familiar meals are unavailabh
or expensive. New foods seem unusual,
and may be less well liked. On the other

hand, American fast foods or sodas may
be too well liked, creating battles with
children at the dinner table or new
weight problems for adults.
When organizing a meal, try to
include
a protein source: meat, fish, poultry,
beans or peas, peanut butter or low-fat
dairy products
a starch: rice, pasta, bread, while
potatoes or sweet potatoes, tortil las,
millet, bulger, or other grains such as oat
meal, or com, and fruit or vegetables.
PLANNING
It may be important to figure out ahead
of time when you have lime to cook and
shop. Poll your family or roommates
informally about what foods you all like
and how often you like them. Think in
terms of protein for 5-6 meals per week.
This may mean poultry (chicken or
turkey) twice a week, fish twice, lean
beef once, and meatless menus one or
more times. Keep this in mind before
shopping to simplify the whole process.
SHOPPING TIPS
• work around supermarket
specials on poultry and meats,
or seasonal fruits and vegetables
• save time by shopping afterB
p.m. or on off-times such as
mid-morning or early afternoon
• buy as much fresh food as you
think you will use in a week
• If you have a small household
where the usual amounts of food
sold tend to spoil, buy frozen
vegetables to allow you to con
sume more variety than you
otherwise might get
The fiber and vitamin A content of
frozen vegetables is comparable to that
of fresh vegetables. The vitamin C and
folic acid content is reduced, but is
substantially higher than that of canned
vegetables.
Canned fruit in water or fruit juice can be
a good choice if fresh fruit is expensive
or of poor quality. It can tide you over if
you run out of fresh fruit and don't have
time to shop over the next few days.
Staples such as pasta and rice can be
bought in bulk and will keep for a while.
Refrigerate brown rice to prevent
rancidity. Bread, muffins, bagels,
tortillas and fresh pasta all freeze well
and can be kept this way for a few weeks
as you use just what you need for a meal.
Potatoes and sweet potatoes should be
purchased in amounts you will use in
two weeks.
COOKING
Let's look at some solutions to the time
crunch. Cook more rice, pasta or
potatoes than you need, re-using
leftovers in soups, pasta, rice or potato
salads. Leftovers can be reheated one or
two days later with a new entree or
vegetable. Today's leftover chicken can
be made into tomorrow's chicken

sandwich, or into a chicken salad, made
different by the choice of seasonings; for
example, Chinese chicken salad with a
soy sauce, rice vinegar, dry mustard
marinade, plus fresh lettuce and
walnuts. You can also try a chicken
salad with a little mayonaise and lowfat
cottage cheese, seasoned with olives and
relish.
It is possible to cook soups and casse
roles ahead and freeze portions in one
meal quantities to eat later. Black bean,
lentil, split pea or chicken soup are some
possibilities. Lasagna, enchiladas,
tamales all freeeze well for future use.
Beans, spaghetti sauce, and pesto sauce
can also be made in larger batches and
saved for later.
Also remember that you can fill tortillas
or pita bread with leftovers in the
refrigerator for a quick meal.
You may want to combine your energies
with friends or other families, by
developing a small cooking coopera
tive. People agree ahead of time to cook
extra amounts of food (soups, casse
roles, sauces) to share with one or two
families. As a result, you get 2 or 3
different meals for the same amount of
work, while creating a sense of family
and community.
Skinless chicken and turkey can be
prepared ahead of time, and frozen for
quick use. For example, turkey breast
when sliced into 1/4" slices and frozen,
will cook in about ten minutes straight
from the freezer. It is delicious with a
little soy sauce, fresh ground pepper and
orcgano. With this you can have baked,
boiled or oven fried potatoes, plus a
cooked vegetable or salad.
SNACKING
Snacks can be as simple as fresh fruit,
which is easy to carry in a backpack, or j
dried fruit if weight is not an issue.
Frozen juice popsicles made in paper
cups, inverted once frozen, and replaced
in the cup for eating are well-liked by
children (and adults). Plain lowfat or
skim yogurt added to undiluted frozen
orange juice (6 oz. of juice concentrated
to about 3 cups of yogurt) makes
refreshing popsicles, high in vitamin C,
calcium and protein.
Whole grain crackers which are low in
fat, and dips made with 1 -2% lowfat
cottage cheese also make good snacks.
Try armenian cracker bread (Akmak),
whole wheat matzo, rice cakes, rice
wafers, and melba toast. Children and
grown-ups also enjoy mini-pizzas made
on whole wheat English muffins, using
homemade sauce and part-skim
mozzarella cheese.
Not all of these ideas will work for
everyone, but it may help you put
together healthful meals which won't
break the bank, or take hours of work.
