This is the OATQ page. The small square in the upper left-hand corner of this page is what we like to call
the "OATQ box." Many have appeared in it through the volume. And now, the mystery question: Who is
the mystery woman in today's OATQ box? A cash prize will be offered for the first correct answer. Send
your guesses to The OATQ Box Contest, c/o The Stanford Daily, Storke Student Publications Building,
Stanford, Calif. 94305.
