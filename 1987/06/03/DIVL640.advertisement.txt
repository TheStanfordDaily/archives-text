"We have provided that the benefits resulting from cooperation shall he freely taught. Cooperative societies
bring forth the best capacities, the best influences of the individual for the benefit of the whole while the
good influences of the many aid the individual."

AN OPEN LETTER TO NORM ROBINSON, DEAN OF RESIDENTIAL EDUCATION
• Co-operative effort is a part of Stanford's founding grant yet Res Ed wants to close one of
the few cooperatives that exist on campus. Why?
• Individual Responsibility, Social Involvement, Openness to Difference are primary goals
of residential education. Co-op houses are among the few that take these goals to heart, yet it is a
co-op that Res Ed wants to close. Why?
• Synergy combines academic excellence and social leadership. The house currently
represents 31 different majors, 3 Golden and 2 Firestone Grant recipients, 2 Fulbright scholars, a
Mellon fellow, and the winner of the undergraduate writing competition. At the same time,
Synergy residents are leaders in campus organizations such as the Women's Center, REP,
Recycling, SOSA, and GLAS. It is the co-operative atmosphere of Synergy that attracts and supports
such committed students. Yet Res Ed wants to change that atmosphere. Why?
In response to our questions Res Ed claims that while Synergy is valuable, times have changed and
demand for co-ops has declined. This is only partly true; 20 guaranteed undergraduates, many with high
draw numbers, did chose Synergy; 20 graduate students specifically listed Synergy as a choice; and over
90 students signed a petition expressing their willingness to live in Synergy if it could remain a co-op.
Further, the draw system itself prevents many of those most eager to live in Synergy from doing so.
While the popularity of co-ops has waned in recent years, the same is true for theme houses and
self-ops. This represents a general trend away from those houses that best embody the ideals of
residential education. We feel that the Dean of Residential Education has a special responsibility to
counteract this trend, not to condone it. By preserving Synergy as a co-op you can show that diversity,
intellectual exchange and social involvement are truly the ideals of residential education.
