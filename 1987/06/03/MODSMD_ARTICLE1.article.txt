# Card corrals No. 1 Texas: Now in Series driver's seat
## 
### CHRIS MYERS Editorial staff 
OMAHA. Neb. — For the second time
in as many College World Series games,
the Stanford Cardinal last night faced
an opponent's best pitcher and beat
him.
After edging Georgia and its top arm,
first-team All-America Derek Lilliquist,
3-2 Sunday, the Cardinal used oppor
tunistic offense and a splendid
complete-game pitching performance
from junior Lee Plemel to best the No. 1
Texas Longhorns and their ace, first
team All-America Curt Krippner, 6-1
yesterday at Rosenblatt Stadium.
With the victory, the Cardinal. 50-16
on the year, moves a step closer to the
World Series championship that has
eluded the team in four previous trips to
Omaha. Stanford next faces No. 3 Okla
homa State Thursday at 5:10 p.m. PST.
Junior right-hander Jack McDowell will
take the mound against the Cowboys.
The Cardinal was not overpowering in
either of its Series victories, but last
night's win, in particular, was seem
ingly done with mirrors. Texas outhit
Stanford 12-5, but the Cardinal held the
Longhorns accountable for every defen
sive mishap, scoring twice on wild
pitches, once on a balk and once on a
bad-hop single.
Stanford stole five bases and of the
four batters Krippner walked, three
came around to score.
"They did the things they're so good
at," Texas Coach Cliff Gustafson said of
Stanford. "When they got men on they
scored them. I'd say Stanford's team
speed was probably the key."

"We were fortunate," Stanford Coach
Mark Marquess said. "We got a few
walks, and a few stolen bases, and we
were able to put pressure on them. They
swang the bat well, but they weren't able
to get the big hit."
Indeed, the Longhdrns' hits fell quietly
when no runners were in scoring posi
tion. Plemel walked only one batter,
Stanford's defense was flawless and by
the end of the game Texas had stranded
12 of its 13 base-runners.
"I think we hit well enough to win, but
we didn't do it in the clutch," Gustafson
said. "Plemel did a real good job of
mixing up his pitches and keeping our
hitters off balance and working his way
out of clutch situations."
The game looked at first like it would
be a pitcher's duel, as Krippner fanned
Toi Cook and Ed Sprague in the top of
the first, and Plemel retired the side in
the bottom of the inning without inci
dent. But the right-handed Krippner,
13-0 entering the game, walked Paul
Carey to start the second, surrendered a
sharp single to Ron Witmeyer and
walked Jeff Saenger to load the bases
with no outs.
David Esquer then ripped what looked
to be a bases-clearing triple to deepest
left-center field. Longhorn left fielder
Rusty Crockett, however, made a spec
tacular over-the-shoulder catch just in
front of the wall, about 380 feet from
home plate. Carey tagged up and scored,
and Witmeyer went to third on the play.
"I tought we could break the game
open there," Marquess said. "I don't
know how that guy caught that ball —
that's a key play."
Nonetheless, Witmeyer promptly

scampered home from third on a wild
pitch and Stanford led 2-0.
The Cardinal put two more on the
board in the third. Cook got aboard on a
fielder's choice, and wasted no time
before stealing second and third on con
secutive pitches. Krippner's next offer
ing to the plate was a wild pitch and
Cook came home with Stanford's third
run.
"I noticed that he (Krippner) had a
pretty high leg kick, and that we could
go on him," Cook said.
The Cardinal larceny continued, with
Paul Carey drawing a walk and stealing
second. Whitmeyer then scored Carey
with a single to center.
In the seventh, Krippner walked
Amaro, who stole second and went to
third on Cook's ground out to short.
With Sprague at bat, Amaro broke from
third to steal home. Krippner balked
and Amaro scored automatically,
making the score 5-0.
"He had the stolen base," Krippner
said. "I just tried to react as fast as I
could. I think he would have been safe
no matter what — even if I had contin
ued with the pitch."
The Longhorns, in the meantime,
could get nothing going against Plemel
and the Cardinal defense. No Texas run
ner advanced past second until Brian
Cisarik led off the eighth inning with a
home run off the Kentucky Fried
Chicken billboard behing the right-field
fence, making the score 5-1.
Texas then put together three singles
to load the bases with two outs. But

Cardinal ace Jack McDowell shut down Georgia on Saturday to record Stanford's first
win in the 1987 College World Series. Last night the Cardinal defeated No. 1 Texas 6-1,
and thus McDowell will again take to the mound tomorrow to face also-undefeated
Oklahoma State at 5:10 p.m. PST.
Plemel induced Brian Johnson to
bounce harmlessly back to the
mound to end the threat. Stanford
escaped the inning with only one
run damage done, and coasted to
victory.
There were similar close calls in
the Cardinal's first game against
Georgia. The game began Satur
day night under clear skies, and
Stanford starter McDowell was in
complete control through five,
giving up only one run on three
hits.
And while McDowell muzzled
the Bulldogs, the Stanford batters
chipped away at Georgia ace Lilli
quist. Paul Carey and Doug Rob
bins went down swinging to open
the second inning, but Witmeyer
got things started with an infield
single to short, followed by a steal
of second.
Esquer then singled sharply to
left to score Witmeyer, and when
the ball skipped past left fielder
Scott Bohlke to the wall, Esquer
scooted to third. Two pitches
later, Esquer faked a break for
home, Lilliquist balked, and
Esquer scored Stanford's second
run.
Ed Sprague opened the fourth

with a triple off the 420-foot sign
in dead center. Paul Carey
brought him in with a ground out
to short and the score was 3-0.
The Bulldogs scratched out a
run in the fifth on two singles and
two Stanford errors, but as the in
ning ended huge clouds rolled in,
the tarps were rolled out and play
was suspended.
Action resumed 90 minutes
later, but the rain returned at the
seventh inning stretch. The game
was suspended for the night, with
the score 3-1.
Play continued Sunday at noon.
Steve Chitren took the mound for
the Cardinal, with second-team
All-America Cris Carpenter throw
ing for the Bulldogs. Stanford
could do nothing against
Carpenter, but Georgia looked like
it was getting something going in
the bottom of the eighth.
After Lilliquist's two-out double,
the Bulldogs had a run in and
men on second and third, and the
score was 3-2. Rich Bielski flew
out to end the inning, and a final
Bulldog rally in the ninth was
snuffed with a double play.
"We were fortunate enough to
get those first runs," Sprague
said. "We didn't swing as well as
we usually do. Lilliquist is

12 of its 13 base-runners.
"I think we hit well enough to win, but
we didn't do it in the clutch," Gustafson
said. "Plemel did a real good job of
mixing up his pitches and keeping our
hitters off balance and working his way
out of clutch situations."
The game looked at first like it would
be a pitcher's duel, as Krippner fanned
Toi Cook and Ed Sprague in the top of
the first, and Plemel retired the side in
the bottom of the inning without inci
dent. But the right-handed Krippner,
13-0 entering the game, walked Paul
Carey to start the second, surrendered a
sharp single to Ron Witmeyer and
walked Jeff Saenger to load the bases
with no outs.
David Esquer then ripped what looked
to be a bases-clearing triple to deepest
left-center field. Longhorn left fielder
Rusty Crockett, however, made a spec
tacular over-the-shoulder catch just in
front of the wall, about 380 feet from
home plate. Carey tagged up and scored,
and Witmeyer went to third on the play.
"I tought we could break the game
open there," Marquess said. "I don't
know how that guy caught that ball —
that's a key play."
Nonetheless, Witmeyer promptly

scampered home from third on a wild
pitch and Stanford led 2-0.
The Cardinal put two more on the
board in the third. Cook got aboard on a
fielder's choice, and wasted no time
before stealing second and third on con
secutive pitches. Krippner's next offer
ing to the plate was a wild pitch and
Cook came home with Stanford's third
run.
"I noticed that he (Krippner) had a
pretty high leg kick, and that we could
go on him," Cook said.
The Cardinal larceny continued, with
Paul Carey drawing a walk and stealing
second. Whitmeyer then scored Carey
with a single to center.
In the seventh, Krippner walked
Amaro, who stole second and went to
third on Cook's ground out to short.
With Sprague at bat, Amaro broke from
third to steal home. Krippner balked
and Amaro scored automatically,
making the score 5-0.
"He had the stolen base," Krippner
said. "I just tried to react as fast as I
could. I think he would have been safe
no matter what — even if I had contin
ued with the pitch."
The Longhorns, in the meantime,
could get nothing going against Plemel
and the Cardinal defense. No Texas run
ner advanced past second until Brian
Cisarik led off the eighth inning with a
home run off the Kentucky Fried
Chicken billboard behing the right-field
fence, making the score 5-1.
Texas then put together three singles
to load the bases with two outs. But

Cardinal ace Jack McDowell shut down Georgia on Saturday to record Stanford's first
win in the 1987 College World Series. Last night the Cardinal defeated No. 1 Texas 6-1,
and thus McDowell will again take to the mound tomorrow to face also-undefeated
Oklahoma State at 5:10 p.m. PST.
Plemel induced Brian Johnson to
bounce harmlessly back to the
mound to end the threat. Stanford
escaped the inning with only one
run damage done, and coasted to
victory.
There were similar close calls in
the Cardinal's first game against
Georgia. The game began Satur
day night under clear skies, and
Stanford starter McDowell was in
complete control through five,
giving up only one run on three
hits.
And while McDowell muzzled
the Bulldogs, the Stanford batters
chipped away at Georgia ace Lilli
quist. Paul Carey and Doug Rob
bins went down swinging to open
the second inning, but Witmeyer
got things started with an infield
single to short, followed by a steal
of second.
Esquer then singled sharply to
left to score Witmeyer, and when
the ball skipped past left fielder
Scott Bohlke to the wall, Esquer
scooted to third. Two pitches
later, Esquer faked a break for
home, Lilliquist balked, and
Esquer scored Stanford's second
run.
Ed Sprague opened the fourth

with a triple off the 420-foot sign
in dead center. Paul Carey
brought him in with a ground out
to short and the score was 3-0.
The Bulldogs scratched out a
run in the fifth on two singles and
two Stanford errors, but as the in
ning ended huge clouds rolled in,
the tarps were rolled out and play
was suspended.
Action resumed 90 minutes
later, but the rain returned at the
seventh inning stretch. The game
was suspended for the night, with
the score 3-1.
Play continued Sunday at noon.
Steve Chitren took the mound for
the Cardinal, with second-team
All-America Cris Carpenter throw
ing for the Bulldogs. Stanford
could do nothing against
Carpenter, but Georgia looked like
it was getting something going in
the bottom of the eighth.
After Lilliquist's two-out double,
the Bulldogs had a run in and
men on second and third, and the
score was 3-2. Rich Bielski flew
out to end the inning, and a final
Bulldog rally in the ninth was
snuffed with a double play.
"We were fortunate enough to
get those first runs," Sprague
said. "We didn't swing as well as
we usually do. Lilliquist is

Stanford sophomore Steve Chitren came in to pick up a save Sunday morning in the completion of Satur
day's rain-suspended game between the Cardinal and Georgia at Rosenblatt Stadium in Omaha, Neb.
OMAHA. Neb. — For the second time
in as many College World Series games,
the Stanford Cardinal last night faced
an opponent's best pitcher and beat
him.
After edging Georgia and its top arm,
first-team All-America Derek Lilliquist,
3-2 Sunday, the Cardinal used oppor
tunistic offense and a splendid
complete-game pitching performance
from junior Lee Plemel to best the No. 1
Texas Longhorns and their ace, first
team All-America Curt Krippner, 6-1
yesterday at Rosenblatt Stadium.
With the victory, the Cardinal. 50-16
on the year, moves a step closer to the
World Series championship that has
eluded the team in four previous trips to
Omaha. Stanford next faces No. 3 Okla
homa State Thursday at 5:10 p.m. PST.
Junior right-hander Jack McDowell will
take the mound against the Cowboys.
The Cardinal was not overpowering in
either of its Series victories, but last
night's win, in particular, was seem
ingly done with mirrors. Texas outhit
Stanford 12-5, but the Cardinal held the
Longhorns accountable for every defen
sive mishap, scoring twice on wild
pitches, once on a balk and once on a
bad-hop single.
Stanford stole five bases and of the
four batters Krippner walked, three
came around to score.
"They did the things they're so good
at," Texas Coach Cliff Gustafson said of

With Sprague at bat, Amaro broke from
third to steal home. Krippner balked
and Amaro scored automatically,
making the score 5-0.
"He had the stolen base," Krippner
said. "I just tried to react as fast as I
could. I think he would have been safe
no matter what — even if I had contin
ued with the pitch."
The Longhorns, in the meantime,
could get nothing going against Plemel
and the Cardinal defense. No Texas run
ner advanced past second until Brian
Cisarik led off the eighth inning with a
home run off the Kentucky Fried
Chicken billboard behing the right-field
fence, making the score 5-1.
Texas then put together three singles
to load the bases with two outs. But

Cardinal ace Jack McDowell shut down Georgia on Saturday to record Stanford's first
win in the 1987 College World Series. Last night the Cardinal defeated No. 1 Texas 6-1,
and thus McDowell will again take to the mound tomorrow to face also-undefeated
Oklahoma State at 5:10 p.m. PST.
Plemel induced Brian Johnson to
bounce harmlessly back to the
mound to end the threat. Stanford
escaped the inning with only one
run damage done, and coasted to
victory.
There were similar close calls in
the Cardinal's first game against
Georgia. The game began Satur
day night under clear skies, and
Stanford starter McDowell was in
complete control through five,
giving up only one run on three
hits.
And while McDowell muzzled
the Bulldogs, the Stanford batters
chipped away at Georgia ace Lilli
quist. Paul Carey and Doug Rob
bins went down swinging to open
the second inning, but Witmeyer
got things started with an infield
single to short, followed by a steal
of second.
Esquer then singled sharply to
left to score Witmeyer, and when
the ball skipped past left fielder
Scott Bohlke to the wall, Esquer
scooted to third. Two pitches
later, Esquer faked a break for
home, Lilliquist balked, and
Esquer scored Stanford's second
run.
Ed Sprague opened the fourth

with a triple off the 420-foot sign
in dead center. Paul Carey
brought him in with a ground out
to short and the score was 3-0.
The Bulldogs scratched out a
run in the fifth on two singles and
two Stanford errors, but as the in
ning ended huge clouds rolled in,
the tarps were rolled out and play
was suspended.
Action resumed 90 minutes
later, but the rain returned at the
seventh inning stretch. The game
was suspended for the night, with
the score 3-1.
Play continued Sunday at noon.
Steve Chitren took the mound for
the Cardinal, with second-team
All-America Cris Carpenter throw
ing for the Bulldogs. Stanford
could do nothing against
Carpenter, but Georgia looked like
it was getting something going in
the bottom of the eighth.
After Lilliquist's two-out double,
the Bulldogs had a run in and
men on second and third, and the
score was 3-2. Rich Bielski flew
out to end the inning, and a final
Bulldog rally in the ninth was
snuffed with a double play.
"We were fortunate enough to
get those first runs," Sprague
said. "We didn't swing as well as
we usually do. Lilliquist is

definitely one of the best we've
faced all year. And Carpenter is
the hardest thrower we've faced."
"It's nice to win the first one,"
Marquess said. "It's quite an
honor to get to the World Series.
We had a real tough regional, and
everybody's really excited and
can't believe they're here. But you
have to get down to business and
play.
"The guys who have been here
before know that — they're not

try to go on as long as they can
and win a national champion
ship."
