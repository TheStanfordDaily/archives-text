# Saga Corp. to manage The Store
## 
### DIANE BISGEIER Senior staff writer 
Tresidder Memorial Union will turn over
management of The Store to Saga Corporation
beginning Sept. 1, the student union's board
of directors announced Monday.
Saga currently runs all of the other food
services in Tresidder. Recently purchased by
the Marriott Corporation, Saga also runs 16
other establishments like The Store on
campuses across the country.
The Store is currently managed by Tresid
der.
The move may help The Store overcome low
sales and decreased numbers of customers, ac
cording to Paul Szczesiul. acting director of
Tresidder.
"Sales peaked about five years ago and have
gone completely flat since then." Szczesiul
said. "Sales aren't keeping up with inflation.
We're not losing money, but we also aren't able
to reach what we think we can."
Szczesiul added that competition from
Safeway, which began operating on a 24-hour
basis two years ago, the small size of The Store
and the high prices of some of its items also
contributed to the decline in the number of
customers.

He explained that Saga, a national corpora
tion, can use its purchasing power to lower
prices. "To most of our vendors. The Store is a
very small operation, so we are unable to buy
in large quantities at wholesale prices."
In addition to lowering prices, transferring
management of The Store to Saga will also
mean added space and a new layout for The
Store. To expand The Store's sales area. Saga
plans to remove The Store's office. "The Store
is cramped, and there is a feeling that the set
up is not ideal," said Nanci Howe, assistant di
rector of Tresidder. "Because The Store is cur
rently so small, we can't carry everything the
students want," Szczesiul added.
"Tresidder doesn't have the capital to put
into renovations right now," said sophomore
Jonathan Schwartz, incoming chair of ther
Tresidder board. "This will give the Tresidder
staff more time to do other things."
The Tresidder board also plans to relocate
The Store to the current Coffee House location
as early as 1990, when general renovations of
Tresidder are scheduled to begin. "The con
tract (with Saga) is only for three years, but if
they perform well they could be helpful in plan
ning for the new store." Szczesiul said.
Another result of the new management will
be an increased use of student managers, ae

cording to Gail Diserens of Campus Relations
and Marketing. "Saga has been really good on
implementing student managers." she said.
"The Store doesn't really have that good of a
management program right now."
SAGA's beginning wage for a cashier is
$4.55 to $4.75. lower than the current Univer
sity wage of ">5.85, Szczesiul said. But he
added that SAGA actually pays more for
managing positions than the University.
"Student managers have the ability to earn
quite a bit more (under SAGA's pay scale)."
Diserens also said that Saga's experience
with student convenience stores will enable it
to "respond a lot quicker than the current
management." The Store currently operates
under one manager, whereas Saga can provide
"back-up support" and will "know what ques
tions to ask in dealing with vendors. Diserens
said.
Howe said Saga will enable Tresidder to gain
"a whole body of knowledge to which our staff
didn't have time to devote." She explained that
many other University services, such as Food
Service and the Legal Affairs Office, "contract
out to get that expertise."
She also stressed that the University will
retain primary control over what happens with
The Store.
