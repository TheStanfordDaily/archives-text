# AIDS call spurs comment

### ELAINE LU Staff writer 
President Reagan's recent call for mandatory
AIDS testing of federal prisoners and new immi
grants has generated mixed reactions from mem
bers of the Stanford community.
Comparing Reagan's new proposals to the treat
ment of syphilis 80 years ago, medical school stu
dent Sylvia Bowen, who taught a class last quarter
on socially transmitted diseases, called Reagan's
philosophy "old-fashioned."
But Thomas Mcßride, associate dean of the Law
School, said it is "commendable that the adminis
tration is finally taking measures against the
disease" — measures that are part of a "late but
welcome initia-tive."
Testing for AIDS should be increased, according
to Thomas Merigan, professor of medicine and in
fectious diseases. "The saddest case is the patient
who, by his own behavior, would not have gotten
the disease and who does not know that he has
gotten the disease from someone he trusted." he
said.
Mcßride advocates "judiciously used" manda
tory testing rather than "too much compulsory
testing," which would merely "drive the disease
underground."

Rather than mandatory testing. Mcßrtde
stressed the Importance of education and volun
tary testing. If the Reagan administration were to
"publicize and educate widely, people would flock"
to get tested since it would interest individuals
who might have been exposed to the virus
whether or not they had contracted the disease.
Mcßride said "overriding factors" would neces
sitate compulsory testing for certain populations.
For example. Mcßride said prison populations,
where many people live close together and where a
great amount of homosexual activity is docu
mented, pose a "really serious public health risk
and would benefit greatly from mandatory testing.
Since testing is bound to encroach on the rights
of the individual. Mcßride said it is always neces
sary to weigh the effects of invasion of privacy
against the public health risk.
Mcßride emphasized the importance of "laws to
protect the confidentiality of the test results" to
protect individual privacy rights.
Although he advised "anyone who thinks that
he is at risk" to be tested. Biology Prof. Philip
Hanawalt said "broad testing of people is over
reacting" and "more political and emotional than
medical."
