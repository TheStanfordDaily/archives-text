# Dunshee report pending
## 
### MARCUS MABRY Senior staff writer 
University and police reports on
the April 22 drowning of junior
David Dunshee will not be
released for some time, according
to University and Stanford Police
Department officials.
Acting Dean of Student Affairs
Norm Robinson remained non
committal yesterday about the
date he will release the Univer
sity's report. He said he could not
estimate a release date until he
has read it.
After returning from a two-week
absence. Robinson received the
completed report Monday from Mi
chael Jackson, assistant to the
provost. Robinson said he would
read the report late yesterday or
this morning.
He appointed Jackson to head
the University's investigation into
the drowning April 27.
Dunshee drowned in Lagunita
after leaving a Zeta Psi Boathouse
Rush party at about 1 a.m. on

Tuesday. April 24. His body was
recovered from the lake by divers
three days later.
Robinson originally said the
report would be completed within
two weeks of Dunshee's death. He
termed the delay "unfortunate."
"You combine the importance of
getting it right with how short
staffed we (the Office of Student
Affairs) are, and things take a lot
longer than people hope they
would," he said.
Robinson added that the report
was delayed due to the high num
ber of interviews Jackson had to
conduct.
"I think Michael wanted to make
sure it was accurate. He had a lot
of people to interview and he had
other things to do." Robinson
said.
He denied that the report has
been delayed so that its release
will occur after the University's
regular session has ended.
"Anything's possible, but that is
not an accurate scenario. If I had
been here last week I suppose it

might have been ready (now)." he
said.
When asked what will determine
the amount of time it will take to
release the report once he has read
it. Robinson replied, "1 just want
to see what it says."
Police Chief Marvin Herrington
said yesterday that the Stanford
Police Department has not yet
sent a revised report on its investi
gation into Dunshee's death.
The initial report submitted by
the Stanford police was rejected by
the Santa Clara County District
Attorney's Office because it did
not contain any information on
the cause of death or the blood al
cohol level, and was sent back to
the police three weeks ago.
Herrington said the police now
have a copy of the coroner's
report, but have not sent a new
version of their own report back to
the district attorney because they
have "picked up some more infor
mation the D.A. wanted" concern
ing who bought the alcohol that
Dunshee consumed prior to his
death and who served It.
The Santa Clara Coroner's Of
fice announced two weeks ago
that the 20-year-old junior had a
blood alcohol level of .25 — two
and-a-half times California's legal
Intoxication limit — and listed in
toxication as a contributory cause
of death.
Zeta Psl lawyer Mike Klinn said
he expects that no legal charges
will be filed against any fraternity
member. "There's no fear of any
thing at all," he said one week
after the drowning. The fraternity
members "Just wanted to see that
they had an attorney available
when the Stanford police inter
viewed them."
