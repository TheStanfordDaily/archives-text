## THE 						STANFORD DAILY An Independent Newspaper Editor's farewell 
### 
It is traditional in this space for the lame
duck editor to offer his observations and
reflections on the volume past. I suppose I'm
no different; spending so much time here in
the past six months, I've drawn some of my
own conclusions about this place and what
we are trying to do here. I make these obser
vations more to provide readers a glimpse
into The Daily than to offer those of us
already here a prescription for improvement.
We have no lack of ideas for improvement
from among ourselves, anyway. We only need
a few that will work.
Sometimes The Daily succeeds brilliantly;
other times, it fails miserably. On more than
one occasion this volume, it has done both —
a few issues were great, a few were downright
horrendous and most of them were a mixture
of both pride and embarrassment. To under
stand our strengths and shortcomings, per
haps an idea of what we do every day would
help.
On a good day, the features and opinions
editors have their pages done in the early af
ternoon — say, by 3 o'clock — and the news
editor has all his stories assigned by then.
The sports editor has his page set by 8 p.m.
or so, and the update editor has taken all he
needs from the wire by 8:30. Any late
breaking news or sports stories are in by 11
p.m. at the latest. Of course, it goes without
saying that when these stories reach me,
they are immaculate — well-written and
error-free. We all go home and slumber
peacefully, secure in the knowledge that our
paper is perfect.
I always thought I should be a fiction
writer. Many days — too many days — the
above scenario went awry. Editors don't al
ways get here early in the afternoon. Stu
dents often have other things on their minds
besides The Daily — classes, for instance —
and are unable to start a story until after
supper. Stories fall through at the last min
ute. Photos fall through at the last minute.
Hell. I've seen whole departments fall
through at the last minute. There are me
chanical problems — phones go dead, type

setting equipment malfunctions, computers
crash. There are personnel problems — writ
ers are slow, editors are slow. And there are
other problems — headlines don't fit. articles
don't fit, photos don't fit. In short, as one
editor is fond of saying, "Shit happens."
Well, shit does happen, and I suppose it al
ways will. But mundane details and bother
some minor occurences shouldn't harm the
quality of the paper. Too often they do. To
make this newspaper better, we have to put
aside small concerns and remember our pur
pose.
The best newspaper is a reflection of the
community it serves — nothing more, noth
ing less. I said that in February, and I still
believe it. But does a newspaper mirror a
community's concerns or define them? Does
a newspaper publish an item because of high
community interest in the issue, or does the
community become interested in something
because of its appearance in a newspaper? I
don't know the answer to these questions. I
do know, however, that a newspaper can
minimize the dilemma by having a diverse
staff that is representative of and interested
in the community. In that respect, The Daily
needs a more diverse staff — for our good and
for the good of the community.
All that said, let me here state that the staff
of Volume 191 has my gratitude and respect.
We've all worked hard here, from the editors
who stay until the final page is finished at 3
a.m. to the writers and photographers who
do most of their work before sundown. Each
Daily is a synthesis of all our efforts, and that
in itself is an achievement.
I have two final messages. To Andrew
Patzman: Congratulations and good luck
with Volume 192. To my mother, who vir
tually lost contact with a son for half a year:
I'll be home next week.
