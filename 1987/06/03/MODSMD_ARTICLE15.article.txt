# Expand the Agenda
## 
### 
In a meeting Sunday, the drafters of the
Rainbow Agenda met with members of those
groups whose concerns had been excluded
from that document. Each of those groups —
the gay and lesbian and the Jewish commu
nity, and the Women's Center — asked that
they be added to the Rainbow Agenda. Their
requests were denied.
In so doing, the Rainbow Agenda coalition
— consisting of the Asian American Stu
dents Association, the Black Student Union,
MEChA (representing the Chicano commu
nity) and the Stanford American Indian Or
ganization — has made a morally indefen
sible mistake.
The name "Rainbow Agenda" implicitly in
cludes all groups. By calling their coalition by
this name, the Rainbow Agenda mis
represented the fact that it did not include
the agendas of the other groups.
The result has been division among the
minority community, and rightfully so. The
drafters of the agenda did not think to in
clude other groups and did not solicit their
concerns. And now, they do not see any prob
lem with the fact that they failed to do so.
The drafters argue that the agenda is di
rected against racism and nothing else. In
this, they failed to be sensitive to the Jewish
community's definition of itself as a race.

Jews suffer from racism on this campus,
both explicit — like the recent distribution of
neo-Nazi propoganda — and institutional —
such as Stanford's failure to provide a kosher
meal plan, effectively discouraging orthodox
Jews from coming here.
The drafters argue that racism is somehow
separate from other forms of oppression. But
Ku Klux Klansmen are no slower to murder
gays or Jews than they are blacks. Neither
are Nazis. Similarily, those who practice
nonviolent or even subtle oppression make
no logical distinctions about who should be
dicriminated against.
The drafters also argue that the colored
races are set off by the fact that their his
tories and cultures have been repressed.
This shows their failure to realize that gay
culture, for example, is so repressed that it
operates clandestinely. The drafters exhib
ited their ignorance of this culture in choos
ing their name. The gay liberation symbol
happens to be the rainbow.
The drafters should admit their mistakes
and apologize to the other communities. And
they should include every minority's con
cerns on the Rainbow Agenda. Oppression is
oppression — no matter what its forms and
no matter whether you call it racism, sexism,
homophobia or anti-Semitism.
