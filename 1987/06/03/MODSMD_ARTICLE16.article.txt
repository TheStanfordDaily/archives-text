# Contras deserve U.S. support
## 
### 
I read Kenneth Fenyo's recent column on
ending aid to the contras (Daily. May 22) with
much dismay. With all I have read concerning
the situation in Nicaragua. I find it astounding
that anyone would question the support we are
giving the contras (except to question why it is
so little). 1 find it especially disconcerting that
someone who considers himself to "have con
servative political views on many foreign policy
issues" would side with those who criticize
current policy. I ask Fenyo to re-evaluate his
position in the light of the following coun
terarguments. I would like to add. all the
points 1 use to support my arguments are well
documented (in many cases by the State De
partment).

First, Fenyo claims that "the contras simply
are not going to win." Well, they certainly will
find It harder if we cut off aid. but they very
possibly could win should support continue.
After all. estimates (even conservative ones)
put the number of contras at about three times
the number of Sandintsta troops at the time of
the overthrow of Somoza. The contras are not
lacking in numbers.
Also, Fenyo claims that the contras do not
enjoy popular support among the Nlcaraguan
people. Just as he cannot prove this to be the
case, neither can 1 prove the opposite. I would,
however, like to make the following sugges
tions as to why the people of Nicaragua do not
show more fervent support for the contras.
First, the Nlcaraguan government has com
plete control over the press and uses it to pin

the blame for all Nicaraguan woes on the
United States. The Sandinistas use the media
to defame the contras, labeling them tools of
the United States. (The Nicaraguan govern
ment refuses to negotiate with the contras in
any Contadora peace talks, insisting on only
dealing with the American government.)
Hence the people have a slanted view of the
"freedom fighters."
Secondly, the Nicaraguan government uses
scare tactics to keep opposition to a minimum.
There are countless documented cases of ex
ecutions of political foes and/or rapings of
their wives. Also, the Nicaraguan government
has established turbas divlnas, or "divine
mobs" designed to break up or neutralize anti
government demonstrations, including
strikes. Their tactics include stoning
protesters, sabotaging protestors vehicles,
beating demonstrators with clubs and van
dalizing and burning the homes and vehicles
of political foes. It is understandable why the
Nicaraguan people do not protest more fer
vently.
The fact that many of the contras* leaders
had previously supported the drive to over
throw Somoza and later abandoned or fled the
Sandinista government lends credence to the
notion that many Nicaraguans are disillu
sioned with the Sandinista state. In fact. 27
percent of the leaders of the FDN (the main
rebel group) defected from positions with the
Sandinista National Guard.
Finally, Fenyo claims that should the
"contras win. there is no great assurance that
the group will establish a democracy instead of
a dictatorship." This may be the case, but it
did not stop the American people from sup
porting the overthrow of Baby Doc Duvialier in

Haiti or Marcos in the Philippines â€” both of
whom previously had been friendly to the U.S.
government. And Nicaragua's civil rights
record is as bad, if not worse.
By supporting the contras. not only are we
promoting democracy in Nicaragua, but we are
supporting democracy in the entire Latin
American region. By keeping the Sandinistas
occupied within their borders and by keeping
them on "good behavior" in order to prevent
foreign politicians from becoming warm to the
contra cause, the United States can, and is. re
ducing the amount of intervening the
Nicaraguans can do elsewhere in the region.
The Nicaraguans already, in their short time at
rule, have provided arms to communist rebels
in Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras, Costa
Rica and Colombia. Rebels from the above
countries as well as Ecuador, the Dominican
Republic, Venezuela, Brazil. Chile and
Uruguay have received military training in
Nicaragua. False documentation, safe haven
and other terrorist-related support has been
given by the Sandinista government to rebels
in Panama, Bolivia and Argentina. And, all
this pro-communist support has been given by
the Sandinistas with the aid of millions of dol
lars of financial aid and hundreds of military
and civilian advisers from Russia. Cuba and
the East Block nations. If. by aiding the con
tras in their fight against the Sandinista gov
ernment, we can prevent the spread of
communism in our hemisphere. I feel our aid
is money well spent.
And so. I would like Mr. Fenyo and all like
him to rethink their positions. I'm a contra
too!
