# Agenda is misdirected
## 
### 
Just over two decades ago, black Americans arose
in mass protest, agitating for better lives. Among the
gains realized through their actions was the accep
tance of black students to elite institutions of higher
learning such as this one.

The vast majority of activists who faced the water
cannons, the dogs, the beatings and terror, were
common people — unsophisticated and, for the most
part, uneducated. They knew that most of them
would not personally reap the benefits of their
struggle. For the most part, those would accrue to
succeeding generations.
Hence the implicit contract signed by the
beneficiaries of the struggle — us. We will take full
advantage of the opportunities won for us at such
great cost, and use the knowledge thus gained to
make meaningful contributions to the greater black
community.
On the whole, the social contract has been grossly
violated. The newly created elites have generally
ignored their obligations. Hence, for blacks, the hal
cyon struggles of the '60s have contributed to the
ranks of a small, slowly growing elite that is uncon
cerned with the fate of a large, rapidly expanding un
derclass. The local chapter of that elite-in-training
agitated for and participated in the May 26 forum on
racism.
At the end of the forum, however, it is doubtful
that the larger black community breathed a sigh of
relief and declared, "Help is on the way."
The forum functioned best as an index of the social
position of the Stanford black community. Only in a
privileged community can such an elaborate exercise
in futility be taken seriously. Only blacks living
charmed lives can muster such surprise and outrage
over day-to-day American racism. One has to live in
the rarified air of the black haute-bourgeiosie in or
der to be wounded by the comments of late
adolescent bigots.
The Stanford black community manages to be
even less representative of its larger community than
is the Stanford white community. On the whole, this
place serves as a finishing school for the black haute
bourgeoisie and an induction center into the ranks
of the assimilated elite. Given this, it is hardly sur
prising to find that the shopping list of immediate
demands presented to the Administration contains
no provision for community outreach (the vague and
seemingly gratuitous demand to admit more poor
minorities notwithstanding).
The Rainbow Agenda complains about the pres
sure to assimilate, but they have assimilated at least

this much: Like American society at large, they are
preoccupied with the perfection of the lives of the few
rather than any improvement in the conditions of
the many. It is not that the Agenda follows the stan
dard practice of substituting the interests of the
elites in place of the interests of the greater commu
nity. For this group, the greater community simply
does not seem to exist.
Drive up University Avenue to East Palo Alto. The
overpass takes you across a social and economic gulf.
Over there, free from the hazy mists of academia, the
sun shines brighter. The issues can be seen in
greater clarity. The Rainbow Agenda cannot make
that trip, because once there, it would be mugged by
reality and thrown out of town.
Listened to from E.P.A., Detroit, Newark or Oak
land, the noise made by the Agenda begins to sound
more like a whine. The demands begin to resemble a
child's Christmas list. The entire movement begins
to look like the self-important posturings of a
privileged micro-minority seeking greater advantage.
The Rainbow Agenda invokes the name of the people
and our history of struggle. It cannibalizes our past
for everything, it seems, but the unquestioned com
mitment to the greater black community which
animated that struggle.
This exercise is anachronistic and ill-suited to tlie
conditions here. While demanding more from the Ad
ministration, the black community here squanders
opportunities now available. Community outreach
programs in East Palo Alto, for example, are largely
the province of white students. There is little effort
made to preserve or celebrate black cultures. Again,
efforts in this area often draw more whites than
blacks.
Were the black community to put a fraction of the
effort wasted on this folly into positive actions, the
results would be less dramatic — but far more con
structive. We might contribute in small ways to a few
lives in the ghetto up the street. We might rediscover
our place in one of the most vibrant cultural tradi
tions in the world. The potential in this direction is
enormous. So are the odds against the realization of
the current agenda.
If black agitation at Stanford is to be anything
other than a laugh, it must benefit more than the
blacks at Stanford. It must make itself relevant to the
larger community. Unlike this exercise, it must move
black students to act, rather than complain. It must
target a manageable number of specific, achievable
goals rather than a grab-bag of demands. It must
avoid the romance of "curing" racism. We hold some
of the most privileged positions in black America.
The task of building the black world is a daunting
one. If people like us do not contribute meaningfully,
black America has no hope.
