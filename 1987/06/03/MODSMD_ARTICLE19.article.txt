Keep Area 1
Over the past several years,
many people have called for
changes In the Western Culture
program, that It Include works
both by women and members of
other cultures. What I fear Is that
many of these people have lost
sight of the purpose of the West
ern Culture program.
Stanford designed the program
to teach students the origins of
the institutions that govern our
society. Every time I see an insti
tution at work in our society, I
can trace its roots back to West
ern civilization — not Eastern,
African, Islamic, Indian or any
other. Our economic system, our
political system, our moral and
ethical code are all Western in
their origins.
Thus, in designing a program,
it is logical to use books from
Western civilization. It is quite
true, though, that other civiliza
tions have contributed greatly to
our society and influenced the
formation of the institutions
within our society. However, what
is important is not what a slave
thought of the white man's bur
den, but the white man's burden.
What influenced our society is not
what another person thought or
did, but how this nation's
forefathers responded to his/her
thoughts and actions.
In order to understand the
influence of colonization, a book
from a non-Western society will
supply little knowledge.
"Robinson Crusoe," though,
would furnish a tremendous
amount of knowledge. This is the
book that this nation's forefath
ers read and that influenced
them.
Likewise, women's books —
aside from being relatively scarce
— were rarely read until late in
the last century. Thus, they had
little influence upon this nation's
history and our society.
That the Western Culture pro
gram does not use books written
by women or from other cultures
does not make the program
racist, ignorant or foolish.
Rather, it shows that those books
had no effect upon our history,
except through how they influ
enced the writers in Western
society.
This is not to say that other
cultures have nothing important

to say. Rather, the opposite is
quite the case. That is the reason
for the non-Western requirement.
Maybe it is this requirement that
should be changed and expanded
— and not the Western Culture
program.
If my assumption as to the
purpose of the Western Culture
program is wrong, the program
definitely needs to be changed
drastically. If my assumption is
correct, we must make sure that
the program teaches students
how and why this nation's
forefathers reacted to the
thoughts and actions they en
countered from other cultures.

Save Synergy
Director of Student Housing
Rodger Whitney's statement that
Synergy "is not meeting an im
portant goal of University
housing — to house students"
(Daily, May 29) misdirects atten
tion from the more important
issue surrounding the decision to
change Synergy's status from a
cooperative to a self-op.
Synergy derives its value from
more than its capacity to house
students. Synergy forms an inte
gral part of the cooperative com
munity. For residents, eating
associates and many in the Stan
ford student body who value
Synergy's unique character, it
represents more than a place to
live. It embodies an environmen
tal awareness and sense of
cooperation — community and
education not found in most
Stanford houses.
To state that Synergy should
lose its status as a cooperative
because it did not fill to 90 per
cent capacity is to fall on a type of
instrumentalist reasoning that
ignores the more important,
human issue in this matter.
Synergy's cooperative status adds
to the University a valuable com
bination of community awareness
and true residential education so
important for those who find in
the house a value that exceeds its
status as a residence, a value that
extends to its most important
attribute — that Synergy is and is
part of a very significant commu
nity.

Issues related
We'd like to call attention to an
incident which occurred on the
night of May 26.
Four of us. all men, were ap
proaching our residence — two of
us with our arms around each
other. A group of male residents
from a neighboring house and
their friends were sitting in a golf
cart holding beer cans and drink
ing. As we walked by them, one
exclaimed. "Look, they have their
arms around each other. They're
fags." His comment was followed
by shouts of "Faggots!" "Fucking
Homos!" and "Homosexuals!"
Given the tone in which the
comments were spouted and the
apparent mental state of our
aggressors, we sensed it probably
wouldn't be in our best interest to
confront them at the time. We
kept walking, laughing off the
incident in an effort to ease our
tension and fear of possible vio
lence.
Incidents such as these are not
uncommon. Oppression of gays
and lesbians, like racist oppres
sion, is rampant on this campus.
In fact, it is carried out far more
viciously and blatantly than racist
oppression. Few people would
dare to call someone a "nigger,"
yet many people would have no
qualms about calling someone a
"fag" or a "dyke." We have to
wonder, though: Would enough
students put in the energy and
time to coalesce and organize a
forum on homophobia?
Students need to realize that
issues like racism, sexism and
the oppression of homosexually
oriented people are all related.
Those involved in combatting any
one of these ills have a responsi
bility to find out about, and
become involved in, the struggles
of other oppressed peoples —
even when the issues don't affect
them personally. We will not be
able to work effectively to liberate
ourselves as people of color,
women, and gays and lesbians
until we learn from each other's
struggles and join forces in more
widely encompassing efforts to
put an end to our oppression.
