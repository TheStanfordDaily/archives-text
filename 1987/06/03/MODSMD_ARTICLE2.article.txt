# Divestment guidelines
## Trustees to toughen policy 
### MONIQUE SCHEER Senior staff writer 
Stanford will implement a more strin
gent divestment policy as soon as June
12 if a Board of Trustees investment
committee approves the changes in the
University's selective divestment policy
submitted by the Committee on Invest
ment Responsibility (CIR) last week.
In its meeting May 27, the CIR pro
posed to send a letter to each South
Africa-related American company in the
Stanford portfolio that has not met
satisfactorily with the Sullivan Prin
ciples. a set of guidelines used to assess
a company's conduct in South Africa.
The companies will have 60 days to
respond to the letters, which will be sent
immediately after the trustees' Special
Committee on Investment Responsibil
ity (SCIR) approves the CIR proposal, ac
cording to Bob Freelen, vice president of
Public Affairs. If a company fails to
respond or if its response is inadequate,
the CIR will automatically recommend
immediate divestment.
The SCIR will vote on approval of the
new CIR proposal during its June 12
meeting. The SCIR has indicated that it
will divest from companies the commis
sion recommends, according to Freder
ick Hillier, chairman of the CIR. "Even
for those companies who do respond —
there is a strong burden of proof on
them," he said.
The new proposal is the product of a
revision of a previous CIR plan to modify

the University divestment policy. The
SCIR would not approve the original
proposal because it did not provide the
companies in question an opportunity
to explain extenuating circumstances
that might justify their operations in
South Africa.
The trustees said they felt divestment
decisions should not be made automati
cally on an objective basis. Currently
Stanford makes its divestment deci
sions on a case-by-case basis according
to standards not limited to the Sullivan
Principles.
If the SCIR approves the CIR proposal.

companies that have not signed the Sul
livan Principles will he asked to do so
and to submit proof as well as informa
tion establishing "the precise magni
tude of your efforts to combat apart
heid." according to the letter. Compan
ies also will be requested to provide in
formation regarding their commitment
to change the South African apartheid
laws.
Companies that have received a failing
Sullivan rating of 111 will be asked to
commit the necessary resources to im-
prove their rating and submit in
formation to the CIR concerning
that committment. A company
that receives a 111 rating Is not
making acceptable progress In

fighting apartheid.
"Needless to say." the draft of
the letter reads, "a continuing 111
rating will not be acceptable to
Stanford."
Letters will also be sent to those
companies that have signed the
principles so recently as to have
not yet received a rating. They will
be asked to provide evidence of

their efforts to combat apartheid
similar to those requested of the
non-signatories.
Of the 62 South Africa-related
companies in the University
portfolio, 11 are either non
signatories or have been given a 111
rating, and nine are new signers
without ratings.
