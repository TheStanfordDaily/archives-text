# Goodbye to Stanford
## 
### 
Don't you hate columnists' final columns? For
some reason, columnists feel that they have a right
to bore their fellow students with some rambling per
sonal philosophy or nostalgic sentimental reflection
simply because it's their last column. On the other
hand, since columnists are among the only unpaid
writers on The Stanford Daily, and they receive no
thanks or compensation for their labors, they should
be able to write whatever they want. Since none of
your student funds go toward my column, I intend to
pontificate ad nauseum without remorse. If you ob
ject, you can always cancel your subscription. My
salary will not be affected.

Having attended West Point as an undergraduate,
Stanford represented an opportunity to discover
what a real college was like. Until Stanford, college
for me represented reveille breakfast formations, a
cold wintery wind whistling off the Hudson River and
an endless number of parades. After several tours of
duty as an Army officer, my friends speculated that
graduate school and the California lifestyle would be
a major culture shock. On the contrary. I think the
culture shock will occur at graduation when I need to
find a barber shop, sew new patches on my uniforms
and return to the foxhole. Actually. I will be return
ing to West Point to teach cadets — not quite the
foxhole.
At West Point, I grew accustomed to statues of
Washington. Mac Arthur and Patton. My first trip
across the Stanford campus brought me face to face
with the monument to Gay Liberation. Toto. I don't
think we're in Kansas anymore. I knew that I had
been somewhat indoctrinated by my previous train
ing and hoped to have some of my values challenged.
A typical political discussion in an Officer's Club
features general consensus and a "nuke em till they
glow" attitude. I wanted to hear some opposing
views. Stanford threw ROTC off campus in 1970,
petitioned against Strategic Defense Initiative re
search and refused to honor Veterans Day. Stanford
seemed like just the place I was looking for.
It worked. I stood in awe: shanties in White Plaza,
a sit-in in Old Union, a dorm transformed into a
sanctuary for Central American refugees, student
solidarity with obscure cannery workers in Watson
ville, condoms distributed by the handful, a grape
boycott. Gay and Lesbian Alliance Valentine's dances
and a screwball splinter group known as the Rain
bow Agenda that echoes whines of racism wherever
it goes. Thank God we have the Hoover Institution to
provide some balance. At least the fraternities sup
ported my expectations of college life.
Where were the Young Republicans? I saw their
sign up table at orientation. Why don't they ever do
anything? They could occasionally respond in print
to the campus insanity. At least the lunatic liberal
fringe groups care enough to support their cause.
Given the void. I felt compelled to present an oppos
ing view.
I started as an at-large member of the editorial
board for The Daily. The other two at-large members
were Stacev Levton and Robbv Perkins. Can vou find

the token conservative? I got outvoted 9-1 on every
issue from the death penalty and student protests to
domestic spending and aid to the contras. I found
myself writing the sleazy editorials that appear in the
box at the top of the page for $16 apiece and hating
every minute of it.
I found my niche as a columnist. For once, I could
write about anything I wanted. It was a welcome
break from the engineering curriculum, where one
can obtain a diploma without ever writing a complete
English sentence. Many of my columns would never
have been allowed in a military publication. People
were constantly offering ideas for columns. "Hey Al,
write a column about the cold anchovy and peanut
butter pizza at Tresidder." "Prof. Krawinkler's mid
term was unreasonable! Slam him in your next
column!"
While some of my columns were intended to be
fun, others were controversial and deliberately an
tagonistic. The responses I received, however, were
courteous and concerned. Some were half-baked,
but they were all civil. One aspect of Stanford life I
never wrote about but appreciate the most is the
respect that people show each other — at least when
they are sober, which is most of the time. In my two
years at Stanford. I have never been treated rudely by
a fellow student, faculty member or Stanford em
ployee. Stanford is probably the most civilized (and
least racist) place I have ever lived.
I want to offer special thanks to the faculty mem
bers in the Construction Management and
Structures/Geotechnical sections of the Civil Engi
neering Department. Without exception, the profes
sors I encountered were dedicated, understanding
and abundantly qualified. I hope I can show the
same degree of patience, diligence and selflessness
while instructing West Point cadets. In particular, I
want to thank Civil Engineering Profs. Jim Gere and
John Fondahl, who offered their encouragement and
support both to my studies and my columns.
On a final note to cut out the mush and add just a
bit of editorial comment: Who in the hell picked Tip
O'Neill to be our graduation speaker? Last year there
was public embarrassment and controversy in find
ing an appropriate speaker. After Soviet leader Mik
hail Gorbachev declined and Stanford refused to give
Bill Cosby an honorary degree. Ted Koppel accepted
our offer despite being a third-place candidate. The
end result to this spectacle, however, was obtaining
one of the nation's best journalists who was also a
Stanford grad and a top-notch speaker.
This year there was no controversy. The decision
was politely made in secret and quietly announced to
the rest of campus. Given the results. I think I prefer
the public brouhaha. Tip O'Neill's style of cronyism
and power brokering in smoke-filled rooms has gone
the way of the dinosaurs. What does an old-time, out
of-work. free-spending, partisan Boston politician
have in common with the typical Stanford student?
Furthermore, an often-heard criticism of Tip O'Neill
is his lack of talent as a public speaker. I think we got
conned.
Three cheers for the Administration for not bar
ring alcohol from Stanford Stadium next year.
Curses and vituperations to the NCAA and their op
pressive. Nazi, bible-beating, moral-majority,
postseason rules that prevented my cooler of beer
from entering Sunken Diamond last weekend. Con
gratulations to the baseball team! Hell of a season!
Best of luck in Omaha!
