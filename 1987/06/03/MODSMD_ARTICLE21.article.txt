# Agenda focuses on racism
## 
### 
We are writing to clarify the confusion voiced by
members of the Jewish and gay/lesbian community
at the recent forum on racism regarding their desire
to be included in the Rainbow Agenda. We hope to
dispel any misconceptions or misunderstandings by
explaining the development and history of the Rain
bow Agenda and why its focus is primarily racism.

COPASS, ET. AL.

In January, black, Asian, Chicano and American
Indian students began meeting to explore the possi
bility of creating an agenda that spoke to their con
cerns. After numerous individual community
caucuses and larger joint community meetings, they
developed an agenda, called the "Third World
Agenda," and presented it to University President
Donald Kennedy May 5.
This process was long and hard but it was success
fully completed because of the historic commonality
of the social, political and economic oppression of
each ethnic community. Another factor that worked
in their favor was the long tradition of joint student
struggle among these four communities.
After May 5, the coalition expanded in order to
welcome the support of other progressive students
and to be certain that students understood that the
issue of racism is not singularly a minority issue.
Many student groups, such as Stanford Out of South
Africa and the Women's Center, immediately sent
representatives to support the agenda.
Additionally, the groups that comprised the Third
World Agenda felt the name "Third World" did not ac
curately characterize their communities. Thus, the
name was changed to "Rainbow Agenda" to describe
an agenda that fights racism which can be embraced
by a rainbow of people.
Though the Rainbow Agenda is comprised only of
the concerns of students of color, this does not dis
count the existence of other forms of discrimination.
Workers, women, Jews, gays, lesbians and the dis
abled all experience oppression, and in the past there
have been coalition efforts, such as the People's Plat
form Coalition, which have attempted to deal with
the concerns of all of these communities.
However, the Rainbow Agenda is not the same
thing as the Rainbow Coalition; it does not try to en
compass the needs of all oppressed people. It is an
agenda that specifically combats the problems faced
by people of color.
Racism is a particular kind of oppression; it is sys
tematic and institutional. Before arriving at Stan
ford, students of color have been victimized by the
worldwide economic debasement of their communit
ies, the delegitimization of their cultures and the

denial of the right to determine their communities'
future. At Stanford these problems are evident in the
eurocentric Western Culture requirement, the small
number of courses in each of the existing ethnic
studies programs, the non-existence of Asian Ameri
can and native American Studies, the underrepre
sentation of minority undergraduate and graduate
students, and the almost complete absence of
minority faculty and high-level administrators.
This is not to say that the oppression of other
groups is unimportant — it is just not the same as
that faced by people of color. For this reason, an anti
racism agenda need not Include every single op
pressed group. We would not expect that an agenda
developed by the gay/lesbian community would in
clude a demand to increase the number of black and
Chicano faculty.
We hope that the development of the Rainbow
Agenda will inspire the development of similar
agendas in many other communities. For example,
at a Rainbow Agenda rally, the Women's Center
speaker spoke in favor of the Rainbow Agenda and
presented an agenda to fight sexism and deal with
the problems faced by women. A lesbian student
spoke at a Rainbow Agenda press conference and
distributed a list of concerns of the gay/lesbian com
munity. The Rainbow Agenda can serve as a
springboard for more discussion in the Stanford
community about all issues of discrimination.
Working together is a new experience for all of us.
It is difficult and we are all learning a great deal.
However, many supporters of the Rainbow Agenda
have felt that statements made by Individuals at the
forum and other settings attacking the Rainbow
Agenda for its focus on racism have been unin
formed and disrespectful.
There may be a lot of media attention now, but stu
dents of color have been struggling for years around
these same issues. Now, some other groups express a
desire to be added to the Rainbow Agenda without
respect for the origins of the its development, which
lie in racism. It is not bad that other groups seek to
join in; in fact, it is positive. But since they have not
participated up until now, they should not complain
that they have been excluded in the past.
While the Rainbow Agenda does not include the
concerns of every group on campus, we hope that in
the future that other oppressed groups will develop
their own agendas and that all groups will work to
gether in a unified front against discrimination. Last
Sunday's meeting, where Rainbow Agenda support
ers met with concerned Jews, women, gays and les
bians, was hopefully the beginning of a future rela
tionship of mutual respect and support.

minority faculty and high-level administrators.
This is not to say that the oppression of other
groups is unimportant — it is just not the same as
that faced by people of color. For this reason, an anti
racism agenda need not Include every single op
pressed group. We would not expect that an agenda
developed by the gay/lesbian community would in
clude a demand to increase the number of black and
Chicano faculty.
We hope that the development of the Rainbow
Agenda will inspire the development of similar
agendas in many other communities. For example,
at a Rainbow Agenda rally, the Women's Center
speaker spoke in favor of the Rainbow Agenda and
presented an agenda to fight sexism and deal with
the problems faced by women. A lesbian student
spoke at a Rainbow Agenda press conference and
distributed a list of concerns of the gay/lesbian com
munity. The Rainbow Agenda can serve as a
springboard for more discussion in the Stanford
community about all issues of discrimination.
Working together is a new experience for all of us.
It is difficult and we are all learning a great deal.
However, many supporters of the Rainbow Agenda
have felt that statements made by Individuals at the
forum and other settings attacking the Rainbow
Agenda for its focus on racism have been unin
formed and disrespectful.
There may be a lot of media attention now, but stu
dents of color have been struggling for years around
these same issues. Now, some other groups express a
desire to be added to the Rainbow Agenda without
respect for the origins of the its development, which
lie in racism. It is not bad that other groups seek to
join in; in fact, it is positive. But since they have not
participated up until now, they should not complain
that they have been excluded in the past.
While the Rainbow Agenda does not include the
concerns of every group on campus, we hope that in
the future that other oppressed groups will develop
their own agendas and that all groups will work to
gether in a unified front against discrimination. Last
Sunday's meeting, where Rainbow Agenda support
ers met with concerned Jews, women, gays and les
bians, was hopefully the beginning of a future rela
tionship of mutual respect and support.
