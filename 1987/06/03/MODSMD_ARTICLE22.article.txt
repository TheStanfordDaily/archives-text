# Pub Board apologizes
## 
### 
This viewpoint is intended to be
as much an explanation concern
ing the production of the
pamphlet "Non" as it is a personal
apology to the Stanford commu
nity for funding this project.

As n ambers of the ASSU Publi
cations Board, wc are responsible
for allocating funds to student
run publications on campus. Be
cause these funds are limited, our
job ' onsists of allocating funding
to those publications that we feel
best serve the needs of the Stan
ford community as a whole.
The editors/xeroxers of "Non,"
Bradley Busetto and Patrick
Lawler, approached us at the
beginning of our spring quarter
discretionary cycle to request
funding for a publication that was
to be a forum for Bay Area artists
to publish their work. They
showed us several poems and
stories and mentioned several
local artists whom they said would
be interested in submitting â€”
none of whom subsequently ap
peared in the distributed pam
phlet.
Obviously, none of the more of
fensive material that was to be
published was exhibited at the in
terview. Were the intent and con
tent of the publication made clear
at that time, the decision to offer
or withhold support for the publi
cation would have been entirely
different from the one made based

on the information that was pre
sented to us.
During the interview, we care
fully explained funding guidelines
to both Busetto and Lawler, con
sisting of the conditions under
which all ASSU-sponsored publi
cations are financed. Publications
must raise half of the funds
needed to publish either though
advertising or solicitations from
departments and organizations.
"Non" chose to ignore this con
dition. The funds that are cur
rently in their account are
composed solely of the money allo
cated by the ASSU. Misrepresenta
tion during the interviewing
process simply adds another error
in judgement to those already
committed by Busetto and Lawler.
A second issue that concerns us
is that of anonymity. Publishing a
magazine is an activity that
demands responsibility and ac
countability. There can be no
privilege or dignity afforded to a
publication that does not have the
courage to stand behind its state
ments. Anonymity is both
cowardly and illegitimate. It offers
no recourse for the reader.
While the Publications board Is
sensitive to issues of censorship
and believes that non-conformist
thought deserves a forum for ex
pression at Stanford, we contend
that a distinction exists between
material intended to foster open
discussion and material intended
to offend and attack specific
groups on campus.
In its deceitful approach to gar
nering funds and its anonymity,
compounded by material that is

sexist and offensive, "Non" vi
olates the most fundamental
codes of the dignity of creative ex
pression. As such it is not deserv
ing of the student funding that it
illicitly attained. We would like to
apologize for the role which we
played in supporting "Non." We
were misled and are working to
remedy the mistakes we have
made.
Scott Stevenson Is the director
and Hannah Stone the deputy di
rector of the ASSU Publications
Board.
