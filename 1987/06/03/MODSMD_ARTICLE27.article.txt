## McDowell, Plemel keep Card undefeated Plemel's gutsy performance sets Longhorn hitters down 
### CHRIS MYERS Editorial staff 
OMAHA, Neb. — Much of the at
tention lavished on the second
ranked Stanford baseball team is
focused on the ace of its pitching
staff, junior right-hander Jack
McDowell.
McDowell's prominence, how
ever, belies the depth of the Card
inal staff, and no Stanford pitcher
has dwelt in near anonymity be
hind McDowell more undeservedly
than fellow junior righthander Lee
Plemel.
As the second man in the Stan
ford rotation for most of the last
two seasons, Plemel has been a
key to the Cardinal's success in
both Six-Pac and post-season
play.
"I've said all along that Jack
McDowell gets a lot of publicity,
and deservedly so," Stanford
Coach Mark Marquess said. "But
Lee Plemel has won some big
games for us all season."
No game was bigger than last
night's complete game victory over
No. 1 Texas in the College World
Series. Plemel scattered 12 hits,
gave up only one run. walked one,
and struck out eight on the way to
his ninth victory of the year and
the team's 50th.
The win puts the Cardinal in ex
cellent position to bring home the
school's.first series title.
The victory was Plemel's sixth
complete game of the year. His
longetivity has been a plus for the
team all season.
"I was close to taking Lee out in
the eighth, but we stick with him

for a long time, because he doesn't
beat himself," Marquess said.
"We felt that if we got him a lead,
he'd be in good shape because he's
tough to beat when he has a lead,"
he continued. "He doesn't walk
people, he makes you hit it, and
you're not just going to be able to
sit on a fastball. You're going to
have to hit a curveball. He'll mix it
up."
Plemel mixed it up all night
against Texas, and the Longhorn
batters looked mixed-up through
most of the game.
"He kept our hitters off bal
ance," Texas Coach Cliff Gustaf
son said. "His overhand curveball
really gave us trouble."
That curveball is essential to
Plemel's effectiveness, because he
isn't an overpowering pitcher. It
was particularly important last
night because Plemel had been
told that the Longhorn batters
"really like fastball pitchers."
"For me to be successful, I have
to throw my curveball and slider
over the plate," Plemel said. "I
mixed my pitches well (against
Texas). Late in the game, they
started to hit first pitch fastballs.
"I throw a lot of strikes, when I
have to," he continued. "That sets
batters up for other pitches —
they'll swing at pitches because
they know I throw a lot of strikes."
Against Texas, Plemel's control
was masterful (only 52 of his 145
pitches were balls), and his cur
veball was breaking wickedly.
"We told Lee he'd be in the pro's
pretty soon with that curveball."

Cardinal junior Lee Plemel came out of teammate Jack McDowell's shadow last night to
record a complete game 6-1 victory over the top-ranked Texas Longhorns.
Cardinal centerfielder Toi Cook
said.
Plemel learned his curve from
Laguna Hills neighbor Don Sut
ton, a former major league pitcher
and future hall-of-famer. The
curve is thrown with a stiff wrist,
and thus cuts down on arm wear,

according to Plemel.
Arm wear will be important for
Plemel in the next few days. He
will probably be asked to start on
two days rest in Stanford's fourth
game of the series, Friday.
That's not a problem, according
to Plemel. "Twice last year and
once this year 1 came back on two
days rest, and felt pretty good," he
said.
Tomorrow night Stanford takes

on Oklahoma State. Plemel
pitched against the Cowboys in
last year's Midwest regional,
losing a 3-0 decision in the cham
pionship game.
He ll be on the bench for this
game, but he'll no doubt be watch
ing attentively. Both he and his
teammates are looking for revenge
against Oklahoma State.
"We've wanted a chance at them
since we got here," Plemel said.
