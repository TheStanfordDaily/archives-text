Crank up the nostalgia ma
chine.
For those who've served their
four years — or more — in the
quest for the magic scrap of
sheepskin that will ensure
health, wealth and happiness
(Yuppie translation: an HMO. a
BMW and a CEO position), now
is the time to look back on four
years of Stanford sports, brush
aside a tear, and send the Buck
Club a copy of your GSL repay
ment schedule.

It was the fall of 1983 when a
washed-up high-school wide
receiver loaded up a Mustang
convertible and headed for the
promised land of high GPAs.
high winter temperatures and
high hopes for a football team
whose previous season had
ended in infamy on the cold car
pet of Memorial Stadium as a
patently Illegal kickoff return
was allowed to deny John Elway
a bowl bid.
The heir apparent to Elway

was already in uniform. As El
way was the top college quarter
back in 1982, so was he the top
high-school quarterback. They
were both Californians, both
economics majors, both named
John. One expert had picked a
7-4 season and a bowl berth for
John Paye and the Cardinal.
It was not to be. Stanford
started losing, and with one ex
ception against Arizona, kept
losing. One win. 10 losses. But
Paye established himself as a top
collegiate quarterback, winning
the job midway through the year
and holding it for four seasons.
Paul Wiggen departed after
the debacle. Jack Elway came in
and turned in 5-6 and 4-7
seasons in his first two terms on
the job.
Then there was last year. After
eight long years of mediocrity.
Stanford was going bowling.
The Cardinal opened 4-0 for the
first time since 1952, came
within two missed field goals
and a fourth-and-one of upset
ting Washington, finished 8-3
with a win In Tokyo over
Arizona, and headed off to the
Gator Bowl in Jacksonville. Fla.
John Paye missed that trip. A
separated shoulder sustained
his junior year had pained him.

then forced him to the sidelines
in Tokyo. He watched from Cali
fornia as the Cardinal dropped a
27-21 decision to Clemson.
Paye no longer was the first
round draft choice who would
save a franchise. The San Fran
cisco 49ers picked him in the
10th round, and his athletic
career is not as bright as it was
four years ago. But the glory
days must end sometime for
everyone, and Paye is an intelli
gent. classy individual who will
succeed long after his press clip
pings are yellowed.
He also played basketball for
three years, starting half the
time at point guard. Stanford
has always had its share of two
sport stars, and the most
notable who will be leaving is Toi
Cook.
Cook has a future in both
baseball and football, and still
hasn't decided which. His pres
ent is in Omaha, as Stanford's
baseball team looks to send off
Cook. Ruben Amaro, David
Esquer, Rob Wassenaar, Mark
Machtolf and A 1 Osuna with a
College World Series title.
Cook has been tagged as
"cocky," a word insulting to

LIS
some. He would have set The Daily
record for column inches quoted
in a season had he not separated
his wrist last fall and missed a
month. But playing cornerback,
you've got to be cocky, sure that

no one can run behind. Cook has
that kind of cockiness.
The Stanford secondary evolved
in four years from the butt of jokes
to the backbone of a team. And
Cook was the leader in that move.
The leader of the defense,
though, was a member of the class
of 87 through misfortune rather
than choice. David Wyman lay on

the field at Arizona in November
1984 with his knee in pieces and
his future in doubt. With a love for
the game and a work ethic to
match, he worked himself back
into being one of the top lineback
ers in the nation. And the payoff
for * he team was equally apparent.
Wyman seemed at times diffi
cult to understand. He had little
patience for those who undertook

to write about his game without
understanding it and with those
who failed to give his team credit
he felt it was due. But for those
who worked as hard at their job as
he did at his. respect was slowly
granted.
The future looks bright for the
Cardinal next year, with two of
those who entered in 1983 hang
ing around for one more shot at
the Rose Bowl. Brad Muster
quietly worked himself up from a
third-string fullback to a Heisman
Trophy contender, all the while
conducting himself in a manner
refreshing to see in an age of
cocaine addictions and point
shaving scandals.
Meanwhile. Jeff James has one
more season to follow in the steps
of Randy Vataha, James Lofton
and Tony Hill.* If Jack Elway can
find another wide receiver to take
some of the double-teams off
James, he should do it easily.
The future appeared bright for
the men's basketball team when
this year's graduates arrived on
campus. Coach Tom Davis had
left a final-eight team at Boston
College for Stanford, and ap
peared on the verge of taking the
Cardinal to its first postseason
tournament since the champion
ship year of 1942.
But the sub-.500 league marks
continued, and Davis came to the
conclusion that it was impossible
to take a Stanford team to the
Final Four. He left for lowa, and

Mike Montgomery came south
from Montana to try to accomplish
what no one has done in 45 years.
The talent level has risen from
that of hard workers like Andy Fis
cher to that of athletes like Todd
Lichti. The Class of 1987 takes
only Novian Whitsitt with it to
Commencement. Whitsitt is a Re
naissance man who can read a
French novel, play the flute or
drop a smooth 20-foot jumper
through the net. He will be
missed, but his place will be filled.
And hopefully in the postseason.
While questions remain about
the men's program, the women's
team has turned the corner in
four years. In 1984, the Cardinal
suffered through a 5-23 cam
paign. With new Coach Tara Van-
Derveer and staff on board, the
Cardinal is ready to begin appear
ing in the top 20 on a regular
basis. It is unfortunate, though,
that four seniors — Erica Mueser,
Kim Mercer, Karen Goedewaagen
and Sue Sebolt — will not be
around for the NCAA tournament
berth that should become reality
soon.
Some of the less-publicized
sports have their own stories — of
team success and personal
achievement — but one stands
out. Patty Fendick won two NCAA
singles titles and three team
championships in her four years
at Stanford, winning the final 57
matches of her career. There is
little doubt that success will con
tinue in the professional ranks.

There are also pet peeves — a
Band that seemed original and
spontaneous as a freshman that
now seems tired and repetitive.
And an Axe Committee made up of
a bunch of self-serving wanna-be's
who have managed to see it as
their Axe and Stanford sports as
their stage. The rally has gone
steadily downhill in these four
years; the bonfire has virtually
ignored the football game in
volved.
And there are people to thank:
Steve Raczynski, Bob Vazquez
and Gary Migdol at Sports Infor
mation; and my colleagues, from
Geoff Sanborn, Mark Zeigler and
Adam Berns, to my friend and
classmate Tom Senf, to Ken
Stevens and Susan Slusser and
the others who are this paper's fu
ture.
Four years of watching Stanford
sports have provided much enjoy
ment and many memories to
those of us about to depart. There
is talk that Stanford needs to
become more intellectual, more
serious, more committed to
producing doctoral candidates
than NCAA champions.
But it is not nights spent on
papers and problem sets that will
be remembered. It is winning Big
Game, beating UCLA and running
onto the court at Maples, and
hopefully winning the College
World Series. It is sunny after
noons spent in Stanford Stadium
and Sunken Diamond and the
friends we spent them with.
Crank up the nostalgia ma

While questions remain about
the men's program, the women's
team has turned the corner in
four years. In 1984, the Cardinal
suffered through a 5-23 cam
paign. With new Coach Tara Van-
Derveer and staff on board, the
Cardinal is ready to begin appear
ing in the top 20 on a regular
basis. It is unfortunate, though,
that four seniors — Erica Mueser,
Kim Mercer, Karen Goedewaagen
and Sue Sebolt — will not be
around for the NCAA tournament
berth that should become reality
soon.
Some of the less-publicized
sports have their own stories — of
team success and personal
achievement — but one stands
out. Patty Fendick won two NCAA
singles titles and three team
championships in her four years
at Stanford, winning the final 57
matches of her career. There is
little doubt that success will con

Four years of watching Stanford

For those who've served their

(Yuppie translation: an HMO. a

is the time to look back on four
years of Stanford sports, brush
aside a tear, and send the Buck
Club a copy of your GSL repay
ment schedule.

It was the fall of 1983 when a
washed-up high-school wide
receiver loaded up a Mustang
convertible and headed for the
promised land of high GPAs.
high winter temperatures and
high hopes for a football team
whose previous season had
ended in infamy on the cold car
pet of Memorial Stadium as a
patently Illegal kickoff return
was allowed to deny John Elway
a bowl bid.
The heir apparent to Elway

was already in uniform. As El
way was the top college quarter
back in 1982, so was he the top
high-school quarterback. They
were both Californians, both
economics majors, both named
John. One expert had picked a
7-4 season and a bowl berth for
John Paye and the Cardinal.
It was not to be. Stanford
started losing, and with one ex
ception against Arizona, kept
losing. One win. 10 losses. But
Paye established himself as a top
collegiate quarterback, winning
the job midway through the year
and holding it for four seasons.
Paul Wiggen departed after
the debacle. Jack Elway came in
and turned in 5-6 and 4-7
seasons in his first two terms on
the job.
Then there was last year. After
eight long years of mediocrity.
Stanford was going bowling.
The Cardinal opened 4-0 for the
first time since 1952, came
within two missed field goals
and a fourth-and-one of upset
ting Washington, finished 8-3
with a win In Tokyo over
Arizona, and headed off to the
Gator Bowl in Jacksonville. Fla.
John Paye missed that trip. A
separated shoulder sustained
his junior year had pained him.

then forced him to the sidelines
in Tokyo. He watched from Cali
fornia as the Cardinal dropped a
27-21 decision to Clemson.
Paye no longer was the first
round draft choice who would
save a franchise. The San Fran
cisco 49ers picked him in the
10th round, and his athletic
career is not as bright as it was
four years ago. But the glory
days must end sometime for
everyone, and Paye is an intelli
gent. classy individual who will
succeed long after his press clip
pings are yellowed.
He also played basketball for
three years, starting half the
time at point guard. Stanford
has always had its share of two
sport stars, and the most
notable who will be leaving is Toi
Cook.
Cook has a future in both
baseball and football, and still
hasn't decided which. His pres
ent is in Omaha, as Stanford's
baseball team looks to send off
Cook. Ruben Amaro, David
Esquer, Rob Wassenaar, Mark
Machtolf and A 1 Osuna with a
College World Series title.

some. He would have set The Daily
record for column inches quoted
in a season had he not separated
his wrist last fall and missed a
month. But playing cornerback,
you've got to be cocky, sure that

no one can run behind. Cook has
that kind of cockiness.
The Stanford secondary evolved
in four years from the butt of jokes
to the backbone of a team. And
Cook was the leader in that move.
The leader of the defense,
though, was a member of the class
of 87 through misfortune rather
than choice. David Wyman lay on

the field at Arizona in November
1984 with his knee in pieces and
his future in doubt. With a love for
the game and a work ethic to
match, he worked himself back
into being one of the top lineback
ers in the nation. And the payoff
for * he team was equally apparent.
Wyman seemed at times diffi
cult to understand. He had little
patience for those who undertook

to write about his game without
understanding it and with those
who failed to give his team credit
he felt it was due. But for those
who worked as hard at their job as
he did at his. respect was slowly
granted.
The future looks bright for the
Cardinal next year, with two of
those who entered in 1983 hang
ing around for one more shot at
the Rose Bowl. Brad Muster
quietly worked himself up from a
third-string fullback to a Heisman
Trophy contender, all the while
conducting himself in a manner
refreshing to see in an age of
cocaine addictions and point
shaving scandals.
Meanwhile. Jeff James has one
more season to follow in the steps
of Randy Vataha, James Lofton
and Tony Hill.* If Jack Elway can
find another wide receiver to take
some of the double-teams off
James, he should do it easily.
The future appeared bright for
the men's basketball team when
this year's graduates arrived on
campus. Coach Tom Davis had
left a final-eight team at Boston
College for Stanford, and ap
peared on the verge of taking the
Cardinal to its first postseason
tournament since the champion
ship year of 1942.
But the sub-.500 league marks
continued, and Davis came to the
conclusion that it was impossible
to take a Stanford team to the
Final Four. He left for lowa, and

Mike Montgomery came south
from Montana to try to accomplish
what no one has done in 45 years.
The talent level has risen from
that of hard workers like Andy Fis
cher to that of athletes like Todd
Lichti. The Class of 1987 takes
only Novian Whitsitt with it to
Commencement. Whitsitt is a Re
naissance man who can read a
French novel, play the flute or
drop a smooth 20-foot jumper
through the net. He will be
missed, but his place will be filled.
