Crank up the nostalgia ma
chine.
For those who've served their
four years — or more — in the
quest for the magic scrap of
sheepskin that will ensure
health, wealth and happiness
(Yuppie translation: an HMO. a
BMW and a CEO position), now
is the time to look back on four
years of Stanford sports, brush
aside a tear, and send the Buck
Club a copy of your GSL repay
ment schedule.

It was the fall of 1983 when a
washed-up high-school wide
receiver loaded up a Mustang
convertible and headed for the
promised land of high GPAs.
high winter temperatures and
high hopes for a football team
whose previous season had
ended in infamy on the cold car
pet of Memorial Stadium as a
patently Illegal kickoff return
was allowed to deny John Elway
a bowl bid.
The heir apparent to Elway

was already in uniform. As El
way was the top college quarter
back in 1982, so was he the top
high-school quarterback. They
were both Californians, both
economics majors, both named
John. One expert had picked a
7-4 season and a bowl berth for
John Paye and the Cardinal.
It was not to be. Stanford
started losing, and with one ex
ception against Arizona, kept
losing. One win. 10 losses. But
Paye established himself as a top
collegiate quarterback, winning
the job midway through the year
and holding it for four seasons.
Paul Wiggen departed after
the debacle. Jack Elway came in
and turned in 5-6 and 4-7
seasons in his first two terms on
the job.
Then there was last year. After
eight long years of mediocrity.
Stanford was going bowling.
The Cardinal opened 4-0 for the
first time since 1952, came
within two missed field goals
and a fourth-and-one of upset
ting Washington, finished 8-3
with a win In Tokyo over
Arizona, and headed off to the
Gator Bowl in Jacksonville. Fla.
John Paye missed that trip. A
separated shoulder sustained
his junior year had pained him.

then forced him to the sidelines
in Tokyo. He watched from Cali
fornia as the Cardinal dropped a
27-21 decision to Clemson.
Paye no longer was the first
round draft choice who would
save a franchise. The San Fran
cisco 49ers picked him in the
10th round, and his athletic
career is not as bright as it was
four years ago. But the glory
days must end sometime for
everyone, and Paye is an intelli
gent. classy individual who will
succeed long after his press clip
pings are yellowed.
He also played basketball for
three years, starting half the
time at point guard. Stanford
has always had its share of two
sport stars, and the most
notable who will be leaving is Toi
Cook.
Cook has a future in both
baseball and football, and still
hasn't decided which. His pres
ent is in Omaha, as Stanford's
baseball team looks to send off
Cook. Ruben Amaro, David
Esquer, Rob Wassenaar, Mark
Machtolf and A 1 Osuna with a
College World Series title.
Cook has been tagged as
"cocky," a word insulting to
