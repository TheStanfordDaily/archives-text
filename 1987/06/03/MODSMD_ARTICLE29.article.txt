## 
### CHRIS MYERS Editorial staff 
OMAHA, Neb. â€” The Chicago White Sox made
Stanford pitcher Jack McDowell the fifth pick overall
in yesterday's Major League Baseball draft.
The junior right-hander from Van Nuys was the
second collegian taken in the draft, and the first of
current College World Series participants to be cho
sen.
As of the fifth round of the draft, no other Stanford
players had been taken.
Pre-draft speculation had McDowell going either to
the White Sox as the fifth pick or to the Baltimore
Orioles as the seventh pick.
"It wasn't much of a surprise to me that I was
selected in the first round," McDowell said. "I didn't
know what was going on, or what team would select
me until it happened. The White Sox had shown an
interest in me so I wasn't that surprised that they
chose me."
McDowell said that he definitely wants to sign with
the White Sox this year. "I'm excited about being
chosen by the White Sox and the potential to be
playing for them in the near future," he said.
"I still have to negotiate with them and get a few
things clear," he continued. "I have two quarters to
go to finish my degree and I want to complete it in
the next two fall quarters. . . . Stanford is still a
viable option. It's a tremendous environment at
Stanford and I have enjoyed my three years here."
Stanford Coach Mark Marquess expressed regret
that his ace would be leaving the Farm. "I hate to lose
him, but at the same time we're all happy for him,"
he said. "If the money is there and Jack feels it is a
good situation for him, then we wish him all the luck
in the world and continued success for a great Major
League career."
McDowell is 12-4 on the season, with a 3.92 ERA
and 109 strikeouts. He pitched five innings against
Georgia in Stanford's Series
opener Saturday, giving up one
unearned run on four hits to
record the victory. He will likely
also start the Cardinal's third
game of the series Thursday
against Oklahoma State (game
time is 5:10 p.m. PST).
McDowell's 34 career wins rank
second on Stanford's all-time list.

and his 320 career strikeouts are
tops in the Cardinal record book.
"Jack is one of the best pitchers
in Stanford history'. He is a tre
mendous competitor and has
proven that he is a winner at all
levels he played in." Marquess
said. "There's no question that he
has the potential to be a Major
League pitcher. Unless injuries
get in his way. 1 see him in the big
leagues within a couple of years."
McDowell last week was named
a third team All-America, but in
the draft was picked ahead of the

six first- and second-team All-
America pitchers.
The Seattle Mariners, as ex
pected. chose outfielder Ken Grif
fey Jr. of Cincinatti's Moeller High
School first in the draft.
Georgia left-hander Derek Lilli
quist. who started against Stan
ford on Saturday, was chosen
sixth overall by the Atlanta
Braves.
The Baltimore Orioles, choosing
seventh, picked left-hander Chris
Myers of Plant High School in
Tampa, Fl.
