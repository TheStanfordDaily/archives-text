### CHRIS MYERS Editorial staff 
OMAHA, Neb. â€” The Chicago White Sox made
Stanford pitcher Jack McDowell the fifth pick overall
in yesterday's Major League Baseball draft.
The junior right-hander from Van Nuys was the
second collegian taken in the draft, and the first of
current College World Series participants to be cho
sen.
As of the fifth round of the draft, no other Stanford
players had been taken.
Pre-draft speculation had McDowell going either to
the White Sox as the fifth pick or to the Baltimore
Orioles as the seventh pick.
"It wasn't much of a surprise to me that I was
selected in the first round," McDowell said. "I didn't
know what was going on, or what team would select
me until it happened. The White Sox had shown an
interest in me so I wasn't that surprised that they
chose me."
McDowell said that he definitely wants to sign with
the White Sox this year. "I'm excited about being
chosen by the White Sox and the potential to be
playing for them in the near future," he said.
"I still have to negotiate with them and get a few
things clear," he continued. "I have two quarters to
go to finish my degree and I want to complete it in
the next two fall quarters. . . . Stanford is still a
viable option. It's a tremendous environment at
Stanford and I have enjoyed my three years here."
Stanford Coach Mark Marquess expressed regret
that his ace would be leaving the Farm. "I hate to lose
him, but at the same time we're all happy for him,"
he said. "If the money is there and Jack feels it is a
good situation for him, then we wish him all the luck
in the world and continued success for a great Major
League career."
McDowell is 12-4 on the season, with a 3.92 ERA
and 109 strikeouts. He pitched five innings against
