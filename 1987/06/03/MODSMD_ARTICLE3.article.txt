# Fund will help finance education programs
## 
### MONIQUE SCHEER Senior staff writer 
The Committee on Investment Re
sponsibility (CIR) voted unanimously
last week to recommend to the Board of
Trustees the creation of fund to which
the University would contribute an
amount equal to its revenue from South
African investments.
If approved, the Stanford South Africa
Fund fund will be used to finance educa
tional programs related to South Africa,

such as internships there for Stanford
students or scholarships for South
African blacks.
In addition to the University contribu
tion. all members of the Stanford com
munity will be invited to contribute, in
cluding alumni and employees, who will
have an option for payroll deductions.
The fund is being established in
response to "a deep frustration about
Stanford's inability to do more about the
South African situation" that Is
shared by the CIR. the trustees
and other members of the Stan
ford community, according to a
memo released by the CIR Mon
day.
The fund may contain *50,000
to *100,000 annually, according
to a preliminary estimate by CIR

Chair Frederick Hilller.
A task force will be established
to determine how the amount of
returns attributable to the Univer
sity's South African investments
will be calculated, how to solicit
contributions and other related is
sues.
CIR members Hlllier, Denise
O'Leary and Susan Termohlen.
along with ex-officio member
Diana Diamond, have volunteered
to be on the task force, which will
also determine further educa
tional uses for the fund.

Three mid-career South African
blacks are expected to visit Stan
ford next fall, according to an an
nouncement by Provost James
Rosse in February.
The account could also be used
to fund visiting professorships or
short-term visits and public
lectures by leading South African
figures, student Internships in
Washington D.C. and a meeting
on the topic of South Africa
among top educational and busi
ness leaders.
