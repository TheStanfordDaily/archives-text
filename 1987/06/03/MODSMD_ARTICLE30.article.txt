# Oklahoma State comes from behind to beat LSU
## 
### CHRIS MYERS Editorial staff 
OMAHA. Neb. — While Stanford
has met with little but frustration
in its last three trips to the College
World Series, the Cardinal has at
least had a better lot than that of
Oklahoma State, which has been
a virtual study in futility in
Omaha.
The Cowboys have gone to the
series the last seven years in a
row. with nary a championship to
show for it.
But as OSU cruised through the
upper half of the tournament
bracket with seeming ease this
week, the No. 3 Cowboys emerged
as the team for Stanford to beat in
its quest for a Series title.
The two teams who will meet to
morrow night advanced to the
tournament in radically different
style. While Stanford won with
speed and pitching, the Cowboys
triumphed with batting and
braun.
Oklahoma State, which came to
Omaha with a .353 team batting
average, immediately justified its
reputation as the nation's best
hitting team, unloading on
Arizona State lefty Linty Ingram
for eight runs on 12 hits in the

opening game of the series.
Among those 12 hits were a
double and single by super
sophomore third baseman Robin
Ventura, who extended his
collegiate-record hitting streak to
57 games.
"It's a good feeling any time you
get a hit." the soft-spoken Ventura
said after the game.
In the other first-day game last
Friday, Louisiana State slipped by
Florida State 6-2 in 10 innings.
That set up a second-round con
frontation between the bats of the
Cowboys and the highly touted
arms of the Tiger pitching staff.
The game began Monday night,
but was suspended by rain in the
top of the fourth, with LSU
leading 6-2.
When play resumed yesterday
afternoon, the Cowboys had men
on first and third with two outs.
Second baseman Brad Beanblos
som promptly singled, left fielder
Ray Ortiz doubled, and Ventura
hit a grounder that took a bad hop
through the legs of Tiger
shortstop Dave Cunningham.
Suddenly the score was knotted at
6-6.
"We were down four runs and
felt that we had to have a good in
ning quickly." OSU Coach Gary

Ward said.
The big rally allowed the Cow
boys to stick with bullpen ace
Marv Rockman, who had entered
the game the night before.
"You don't like to have your ace
reliever out there burning innings
and pitches if you aren't in the
ballgame," Ward said. "So the four
quick runs allowed us to stay with
Marv."
Rockman, a right-handed sub
mariner. went seven innipgs for
the Cowboys, allowing only three
hits and one run while striking
out nine.
Cowboy first baseman Jimmy
Barrigan's seventh-inning homer
just inside the right field foul pole
proved the difference as Okla
homa State prevailed 8-7. with the
unbeaten Rockman recording his
12th victory.
In other second-round games.
Arkansas bounced back from a
loss to Texas to defeat Georgia 5-4
on Sunday and send the Bulldogs
home. Florida State got a
complete-game shutout (the first
in the Series since 1983) from left
hander Chris Pollack to eliminate
Arizona State 3-0. Arkansas meets
LSU this afternoon in an elimina
tion game, while Florida State
takes on Texas in the nightcap.
