# McCarthy cards 69, finishes 9th
## 
### ROBERT PORTNOY Staff writer 
Senior Kathleen McCarthy
brought her illustrious Stanford
career to a close with a scintillat
ing 4-under-par 69 in Saturday's
final round of the NCAA cham
pionships at Albuquerque, N.M.
The 69 tied McCarthy for the
low round of the day with Ala
bama's Mikki Bjuro. Stanford's
All-America — the third time
McCarthy has reached that pin
nacle — made the biggest move
of the day, finishing five shots
back in a ninth-place tie at 294
with Kris Tschetter of Texas
Christian and Heather Kuzmich
of Georgia.
"Kathleen was, as usual, just
outstanding." said Stanford
Coach Tim Baldwin. "I felt all
along that she would win the
tournament. However, the first
three days she did not putt well
whatsoever. She made a major

change Friday in her putting
setup and putted beautifully Sat
urday."
Stanford carded a final-round
302 to finish alone in 10th place
at 1,210, 23 strokes behind win
ner San Jose State. SJSU won
the tournament on the final hole
of play as sophomore Anne Jones
sank a do-or-die 15-foot bogey
putt to give the Spartans a one
shot victory over a surprising
Furman team.
"I've been waiting 10 years for
this," exulted San Jose State
Coach Mark Gale.
Jones' putt also forced a
playoff with New Mexico senior
Caroline Keggi for the individual
title, but Keggi parred the first
hole of sudden death as Jones
bogied to capture the national
title.
Jones' final hole of regulation
play was as bizarre as they come.
Her second shot on the par-5
hole hit the leg of Arizona State

Coach Linda Vollstedt and
caromed under a tree, where
Jones was forced to take an un
playable lie and the resulting
penalty stroke. Her fourth shot
bounced over the green and
settled in the rough just beyond
a green-side trap. Although her
pitch stopped well short of the
hole, Jones buried the difficult
putt to give SJSU its winning
score of 1,187.
Two-time defending champion
Florida wound up third at 1.190,
two shots behind second-place
Furman. Pacific 10 Conference
runner-up USC nabbed fourth at
1,191. with third-round leader
Miami another stroke back.
USC was the only Pac-10 entry
to best the Cardinal, as top
ranked Arizona State, the con
ference champiort, finished
11th. a single shot behind Stan
ford.
"I am really pleased with our
performance. It was very steady

and very positive. Finishing 10th
in that field, the top 17 in the
country, was really, really good."
Baldwin commented.
"I'm not sure we could've been
any steadier. What makes the
finish even sweeter is that we
placed ahead of three other Pac
-10 teams, including newly
number-one-ranked Arizona
State."
McCarthy was the key to the
Cardinal's lOth-place finish.
"There's real pressure involved
in that you know right where you
are after each hole. We came to
the 18th hole today tied with
ASU for 10th place," said
Baldwin. "But Kathleen really
came through for us. She calmly
sank a downhill, left-to-right, 15-
foot putt to give us 10th place all
to ourselves and give her the low
round of the day. I couldn't think
of a more fabulous way for her to
end a fabulous career."
