BERKELEY - The Stanford vol
leyball program finally got a na
tional title. Well, members of the
program did. at least. Two. to be
exact. The women's team has been
to the Final Four in each of the
last five years without winning the
NCAA championship, but last
week Coach Don Shaw and junior
setter Wendi Rush both played on
winning feams at the United
States Volleyball Association Na
tional Championships.
Shaw played in the Men's
Masters category with many 1980
and 1984 Olympians, and his
team ran away with the title by
going 9-0 in the competition. All
six starters were named to either
the first-team or honorable
mention All-America squads, with
Shaw, who played swing hitter,
making the honorable-mention

team.
Rush played in the Women's
Open category for the Chrysler
team, which was runner-up last
year. Unfortunately. Carolyn
Becker, who sei for the silver
medallst U.S. Olympic team In
1984 also plays for Chrysler.
Thus. Rush served only as a back
row player, coming In to give
outside hitter Vicki Cantrell a
rest.
Another Stanford player, junior
Scott Fortune, played in the Men's
Open category against many pres
ent and former national team
players. His team took third.
The Master's title was the first
for Shaw, who also played for two
open national championship
teams in the late '70s. The cham
pionship was also a first for Rush,
whose team started 1987 USVBA
