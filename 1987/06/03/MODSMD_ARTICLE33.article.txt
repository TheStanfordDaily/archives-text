# Stanford, Texas swim teams sign talented recruits

The rich get richer in women's
swimming.
Despite having no scholarships
available for recruits, Stanford
Coach George Haines has
managed to draw several talented
swimmers to the Farm as he gears
his squad up for another run at
the NCAA title that so nearly
evaded the runner-up Cardinal
earlier this spring.
Meanwhile, Texas Coach Rich
ard Quick worked to offset
graduation losses for his four
time defending national cham
pion Longhorns by inking the na
tion's top high-school diver and
several swimmers who have
placed in the U.S. nationals.

Haines is fine-tuning a
predominantly freshman-soph
omore squad that returns all 17
NCAA qualifiers, and he sought
primarily to add depth in the
sprint and distance freestyles.
In Barb Metz he may have found
the swimmer who can offset
Texas' strength in the distance
events. Metz didn't begin swim
ming until her junior year of high
school and slashed her times
drastically in the past year while
placing as high as fourth in the
U.S. nationals.
"She'll be a real factor in our
program next year," said Haines of
Metz, who hails from Wyoming
but attended the Pinecrest School
in Fort Lauderdale, Fla. "She's
probably the No. 1 recruit in the
country In the middle and dis

tance freestyles."
Jodi Smith has also been in the
top four at nationals, garnering a
fourth place in the 200 backstroke
at the short courses, and she is
looking forward to joining the
Cardinal.
"My coach. Don King, really has
a reputation too," Smith said of
the prospect of training with
Haines. "He described George to
me as . . . (Alabama Coach) Don
Gambril created water, and
George taught people to walk on
it. I'm real excited to be working
with him."
While Smith's forte is the back
stroke, Haines said she "is a lot
better in the freestyle than she's
done."
Smith, a Portland, Ore., native,
was also recruited by Texas but

said. "I just decided the academics
there weren't strong enough."
Germantown (Penn.) Academy
product Susan Buckovich is ex
pected to contribute in the
freestyles and butterfly, while
Haines rounded out his recruiting
class with Walnut Creek's Katy
Young and Catherina Pereira from
Houston.
Quick said goodbye to two
former NCAA champions and his
top diver at graduation but should
rebound after raiding the Mission
Bay Swim Club in Boca Raton.
Fla. Quick grabbed three Mission
Bay team members, including
Cindy Bradford, who had been
recruited by Stanford, as well as
Kelly Jenkins, a four-time All-
America diver from Houston.
This summer's schedule in

eludes the the World Student
Games in Zagreb, Yugoslavia. July
8 to 16; U.S. Long Course Cham
pionships in Clovis. July 26 to 31:
the Pan-Pacific Games in
Brisbane. Australia, August 13 to
16; and the Pan-American Games
in Indianapolis. August 9 to 22.
Stanford swimmers will likely
compete in every meet, and a half
dozen are already slated for the
Yugoslavia trip on the basis of
their NCAA finishes.
Monica Nielebeck, Jennifer Pok
luda, Jenny Shannon. Aimee Ber
zins, Lisa Gillespie and Susannah
Miller have all gained berths on
the team.
"I'm really excited." said Miller,
who will postpone surgery on the
knee she injured this spring until
after the competition. "You don't

go to an international meet and
not point for it."
Several swimmers will stay on
the Farm this summer to practice
with Haines prior to the nationals,
when the Pan-Pacific and Pan-
American teams will be chosen.
While many athletes will be
angling for a trip to Australia as
opposed to Indianapolis. Stan
ford's Laurie McLean has a differ
ent perspective on the competi
tions.
"I'd love to make one of the
teams. It really doesn't matter to
me." she said. "I'd really like to go
to Australia except it's going to be
the middle of winter there. For
swimming purposes, it would
probably be better to stay in the
United States."
