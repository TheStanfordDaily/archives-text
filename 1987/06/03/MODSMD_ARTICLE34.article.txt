# Card track begins NCAAs
## 
### ERIK STEN Editorial staff 
The preliminary rounds of the
NCAA track and field champion
ships begin today In Baton Rouge,
La. Two members of the men's
team and four of the women's will
compete for the Cardinal at the
meet.
As a team, Stanford won't have
the depth to challenge pre-meet
favorites UCLA or Texas Christian
for the overall title. Individually,
however, the Cardinal could very
well come home from Baton Rouge
with a half-dozen All-America se
lections. Although none of the six
athletes goes in as the favorite to
win their respective events, all of
them should, according to Asst.
Coach Dave Wollman, "have a

good chance at making it to the
finals and coming home an All-
Amerlcan."
For the women, redshirt fresh
man Erica Wheeler will compete In
the Javelin, freshman Carol Gray
in the 3,000 meters, senior Pam
Board in the 400 hurdles and
sophomore Patty Purpur, the
team's only two-event qualifier, in
the shotput and discus.
The men will be represented by
juniors John Gash and Marc
Olesen. Gash, the school record
holder with a best of 17-feet-8-
inches, will compete in the pole
vault and Olesen, the Pacific 10
Conference runner-up, will race in
the 1,500.
With only one senior going to
the championships, Asst. Coach

Scott Chlsam looks at the meet as
only "a beginning.
"They are almost all underclas
smen and they will all be back next
year. If we do well this year with
young kids, next year should be all
the better. It's a very good chance
(for the athletes) to get some na
tional experience," Chlsam said.
Missing from the Cardinal
roster will be junior Lisa
Bernhagen. Bernhagen, the na
tion's top-ranked collegiate high
jumper who earlier this year set a
college record with an indoor leap
of 6-5 and 1/4, is still recovering
from an injured foot and will not
be ready to compete. At this point,
Bernhagen looks questionable for
the TAC national championships,
which will be held June 26 in San
Jose.
