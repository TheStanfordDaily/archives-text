## Interview: The Marvel-ous Stan Lee On Spider-Man, comics for adults and fighting illiteracy 
### MARK TOMPKINS Editorial staff 
It was like getting to meet Santa
Claus. Forget about meeting ac
tors, actresses, film professionals
or rock stars, this was a man who
had done something of real worth.
This was Stan Lee, the man who,
to oversimplify, put the zap! and
the pow! into comic-book writing.
Back in the early '60s, Lee was a
writer and editor at the fledgling
Atlas/Marvel comics line, and
sales were not good. A rival com
pany (DC) owned all the well
known characters like Superman
and Batman, and so Lee mostly
churned out campy monster
stories or little mysteries with an
O. Henry twist.
But divine inspiration seems to
have taken over; trying to bolster
sales, Lee wound up revitalizing
the entire comic-book industry.
First he created The Fantastic
Four, then the Amazing Spider-
Man, the Incredible Hulk, The X-
Men, the Mighty Thor, the
Avengers, Daredevil and nu
merous other superhero charac
ters. His twist was to give the
characters human foibles and the
comics themselves a weird kind of
vitality.
Working with artists like Jack
Kirby (who probably inspired
filmmakers like Lucas and Spiel
berg more than anyone else), Lee
ushered in what has become
known as "The Marvel Age of Com
ics." Printed in bright, gaudy
colors, his comics pulsed with
kinetic energy and irreverent wit.
A sort of warped literacy filtered
through the books: Lee was fond
of quoting Shakespeare at various
moments (while Spider-Man was
getting whumped by a villain like
the Green Goblin, for instance),
and a noticeably self-mocking
tone ran through the editorials
and letters pages of Marvel Com
ics, said editorials being another
of Lee's innovations.
Lee's comics were ideal for the
'60s; for a while Marvel didn't even
call itself a comics company but
"Marvel Pop Art Productions."
Comics were (and still are) widely
read by adults in Japan and
Europe, especially France, but in
America they had long been re
garded as an illegitimate offspring
to the publishing industry. No
longer. Marvel Comics became
popular with college readers and
hippies, many of whom would ask
Lee what he was on. All told, Lee's
characters for Marvel constituted
a sort of new pop mythology. Not
bad for a guy who got started at
Marvel as a copy boy way back in
1939, at the age of 17.
Moreover. Lee's idea that Ameri
can comic books could aspire to
something a little higher than
mere juvenilia has inspired many
writers and artists since, and
right now the comics industry is
more ambitious than it has ever
been before. The recent "Dark
Knight" series, which treated Bat
man as a sort of violent Expres
sionist cartoon, has attracted the
most attention, for it exploded the
whole concept of the superhero as
a benign figure, instead drawing
out the quasifascist undertones of

characters like Superman. Other
notable titles include "The
Watchmen," "Cerebus," "Elektra:
Assassin," "Maus" and "Neat
Stuff." all of which show just how
much can be done in the medium
of comics storytelling.
Lee became Marvel's publisher
in 1972; since then he has become
vice president of creative affairs at
Marvel Productions, a Hollywood
branch seeking to bring Marvel
creations to a wider audience via
movies and television.
Marvel was recently bought by
New World Pictures, so. as Lee ex
plained, it's very likely that more
Marvel characters will be hitting
the screen in some form or an
other. Lee himself no longer has
time to write any comics himself,
although he continues to write the
Spider-Man newspaper strip.
In San Francisco last week to
discuss Marvel's future plans and
arrangement with New World, Lee
was the very picture of excitement
and amiability. Though in his
early 60s, he threatened to bowl
me over with his enthusiasm. The
former editor in him came
through when he jokingly ad
monished me to check all my spell
ing. because, he said. "I'm a care
ful proofreader, and if there's one
mistake. . ." I didn't ask what
would happen — perhaps Lee sics
the Incredible Hulk or Doctor
Doom on writers who don't con
sult their dictionaries, so I made
sure to check mine.
Daily: When you first created all
your characters, did you have any
idea how long they would last,
that they would be this success
ful?
Lee: None at all. In a million years
I couldn't have predicted what
would happen.
Daily: Was there any particular
moment along the way where you
said to yourself. "Hey, I might
really have something here?"
Lee: Yes. After a couple of years, or
whenever it was that we changed
the name to Marvel Comics. Up
until then we were Atlas Comics. I
believe. At some point I said, gee,
these books are really selling. We
were getting fan mail — we never

used to get fan mail before Marvel.
We might get one letter a year from
somebody, saying "I bought one of
your books and there was a staple
missing. I want my dime back." I'd
hang it up on the bulletin board
and say, "Look, we got a letter!
Somebody's reading us!"
But all of a sudden we got real
fan mail. The books were selling
well, and people were talking, and
then I realized fan clubs were pop
ping up, little stores were starting
to sell our comics, and I knew we
were on to something. I thought,
we've got to get a better name, be

cause the books are not the same
as they used to be. We came up
with the name Marvel, and the
rest is history.
Daily: What do you think it was
about Marvel Comics that was so
revitalizing to the comics indus
try?
Lee: I'd like to think it was the per
sonality, the style. A story is a
story — our stories were good guys
fighting bad guys. Basically, the
theme I used was to try and tell
fairy tales for grown-ups. You had
to suspend disbelief and believe
that a guy who's been bitten by a

radioactive spider can crawl on
walls (Spider-Man), you have to
believe that a guy can turn into a
green-skinned monster (The
Hulk), or whatever. Granting that,
I tried to make everything else
realistic. If a guy really were a
spider-man. what would his life be
like? How would he relate to girls,
how would he earn a living? And
wouldn't he still have to worry
about pimples?
Also, I tried to put humor into
the stories. I tried to put humor
into the letters pages, tried to do
"Bullpen Bulletins." do soapboxes
where I would talk to the readers. I
tried to make it as if we were all
part of an in-group, sharing a
good time, and the people who
didn't read Marvel were really
missing something because we
were all having Jun. It was a
feeling I tried to give, and by some
lucky, one-in-a-million chance it
seems to have worked.
Didn't I say that beautifully?
Daily: Do you ever miss the actual
writing of comics?
Lee: Sure. I miss the excitement
and the fun. Mainly, I miss the im
mediacy, because in comics I'd get
an idea for a book, I'd call an artist
and in three months it was
finished and I had it in my hands.
In movies and in television, you
can wait three years and still not
have the finished product. So I
miss that. But I don't have too
much time to miss it, because I
keep so busy.
Daily: What exactly do you do
now? What kind of considerations
do you have in transferring a char
acter from comics to TV?
Lee: It's difficult. You have to try
to keep the same qualities that
made the comic, the character,
popular in comics, but at the
same time you have to bear in
mind that comics are a different
medium than the movies.
Changes and adjustments have to
be made. You have to make sure
you're making the right changes.
I'll give you a funny example.
With "Superman," they made a lot
of changes in the movie, because
the movie had a flavor and a style
that the comics never had. The

movie had humor and a certain
sophistication, which the comic
book never had. "Superman" was
very dry as a comic book. The Mar
vel Comics were done in the style
that the "Superman" movie was
done. Now. if we ever do a "Spider-
Man" movie correctly, it'll look as
if we were copying "Superman."
It's a funny thing. If they had done
"Superman" exactly as it was done
in the comics. 1 think it would
have bombed.
Daily: Do you have any particular
projects now that you can tell us
about?
Lee: Oh yeah. You know, we were
bought by New World Pictures,
and they do movies. TV series,
video cassettes, and they're very
anxious to get most of our charac
ters up on the screen. So we're
really developing almost every
character that we have, either as a
TV series, an animated show or as
a motion picture. Plus there are
some original concepts we've come
up with, which we're going to do
as movies and then we'll do as
comic books. So we'll reverse it.
Daily: How involved are you in the
process? Are you creating any
thing new?
Lee: As much as possible. Our
first new movie, which is based on
an original idea, is my idea. And
I'm involved in all the movies we're
doing, I meet with the artists, and
I have a feeling I'm going to be
more and more involved as time
goes along. It's incredibly exciting,
the fact that we were bought by
New World. It's the best thing that
could have happened to us.
Daily: Do you think it's a good
marriage for Marvel Comics?
Lee: It's the greatest, the greatest.
I was so afraid that we would be
bought by some stock brokerage
company or a plumbing supply
company — who knows? We were
bought by a young, energetic
movie, TV and cassette company.
What could be better?
Daily: What's your impression of
the comic-book field today? Do
you keep an eye on things?
Lee: I try to look at the books as
much as possible. The field has
become much more adult. With
things like "The Watchmen,"
"Elektra: Assassin," "The Punish
er" and even the way "The X-Men"
is being done, it's catering much
more to the adult audience.
Daily: Why do you think that is? Is
it a natural progression?
Lee: The artists and writers are
really doing what they want to do
now. They're writing the kind of
stories they want to do, which
gives you the best stories, gener
ally. Usually if a man does what he
wants to do, then you get his best
work. A lot has to do with the
comic-book stores which have
proliferated throughout the
country. They are usually
patronized by older readers, and a
lot of books are sold in those
stores. So. both because the writ
ers and artists are adults, and
they're doing the kind of stories
they want to read, and also be
cause more and more adults are
buying the books, everything has
become more adult.


Daily: How's the writing of the
Spider-Man newspaper strip dif
ferent from the writing of the
comic book? Are there a lot of
technical considerations?
Lee: It's much different. As you
can imagine, the whole pacing has
to differ, because we've got two or
three panels a day. In the first
panel you have to give a sort of
resume of what's happened
before, in the second panel you try
to move the story along and try to
have a cliffhanger. and that's it!
That's all you've got!
One of the things I did early on
— we've had the strip going for
about eight years now — was to
eliminate super-villains and
costumed characters other than
Spider-Man from the strip, be
cause I realized newspaper strips
are read mainly by adults. And
adults couldn't relate to crazy
characters running around in
costumes. So Spider-Man Is the
only one who wears a costume,
and basically I write the strip as If

I were writing a soap opera, as if I
were writing "Mary Worth," only
the lead character happens to
have a super-power. It seems to
work. I know it works, because
"Superman," "Star Wars" and
"Star Trek" came out in the news
paper at the same time as "Spider-
Man" and all three of them died.
And "Spider-Man" is still in over
500 papers.
Again, as I said, you have to
change a comic book to accommo
date it to movies or TV or
newspapers, and they didn't. They
did the "Superman." "Star Wars"
and "Star Trek" newspaper strips
exactly as they're done on TV or

wherever.
Daily: Of all the stories and char
acters you've made up, is there
any one scene or character that's
nearest and dearest to you?
Lee: Yeah, probably Spider-Man.
He's more like me, he's a regular
guy who has a lot of problems, al
ways doing the wrong thing and
tripping up and gettin' in trouble.
He's me.
Daily: Are there any characters
you think it might have been a
mistake to introduce?
Lee: I do not make mistakes. I am
not programmed to make mis
takes. No, it doesn't seem that way
— they've all sold. It's a funny

thing they're all our best-selling
books today, all the ones I did 20
years ago. It's incredible.
People used to look down their
noses at comics. I've probably
lectured as much as any living
being at colleges around the
country — for a period of 15 years
I never went to less than one a
week — and I have found that the
kids I talked to in the audiences
were inevitably among the
smarter kids in the school, the
ones who were into comic books.
Daily: Comics must have an edu
cational potential, you think?
Lee: Comics are like the last bas
tion against creeping illiteracy in

this country. The problem is, so
many kids aren't reading, they're
hooked on TV, movies or
whatever. You try to get them to
read a book, they resist you —
nobody ever wants to do anything
you tell them is good for them.
Comic books are the one thing
that makes a kid equate reading
with pleasure. They teach kids the
reading habit, to identify what's
on the printed page with enjoy
ment, and then once the kid gets
more facile at reading, he goes on
to read other things.
I've had so many teachers tell
this to me, I've had so many par
ents write in saying, "I don't un

derstand it. my little son was the
dumbest kid in English, he was al
most Illiterate and wouldn't read
or anything, suddenly he got
hooked on Marvel Comics and
now he's getting straight A's in
grammar and composition." So
I'm convinced that comics serve a
very useful purpose, and I'm not
even doing comics any more!
Daily: Any final words?
Lee: "Think Marvel!" No. I'm very
happy when I go to do Interviews
or when I go to a TV station or
anywhere. I meet people who are
now adults, and they say, "I've
loved Marvel for years. I grew up
on them!" It's the greatest feeling
in the world, when you feel that
people respond with enthusiasm
to what you've done. And basi
cally, I feel that my job has been to
try and entertain people, so If I've
succeeded, that's terrific. And I'm
the luckiest guy in the world, be
cause now I'm in a whole different
thing, movies and TV. The fun
thing of it is trying to do on the
screen what we did years ago on
the page. Now it remains to be
seen whether we're going to
succeed, but we're sure going to
try!
