# Heavy metal head-bangers want their rights
## 
### ANDREW BERKOWITZ Staff writer 
It has become increasingly clear in the past weeks
that the Rainbow Agenda does not include all
minority groups in its membership, and 1 feel com
pelled to speak on behalf of the minority group that
has been most ignored: heavy-metal fans. Sure, you
can say that heavy metal has been given equal oppor
tunities to thrive at Stanford, but the message that
has been projected from the community is clear:
Head-bangers go home."

Head-bangers, go
home."

Metal-head discrimination exists in all areas of the
University. The Admissions Office has sin
glehandedly insured that riot one student has been
admitted named Cinderella. Krokus, Dokken or
Megadcth. Not a Fender. Charvel or Gibson can be
found among the so-called "irreverent" ranks of the
Band. Letters to The Daily about the movie
"Hoosiers" conveniently forgot to mention that no
heavy-metal music was played during the basketball
scenes. Even the Bookstore, long a bastion of
tolerance at Stanford, has refused to print "Stanford,
the Harvard of the West" on any clothing made of
Spandcx or leather.
However, a recent incident was the proverbial
spiked collar that broke the camel's neck. The Stan
ford Concert Network was actually planning to invite
David Bowie or Madonna to play a summer concert
in Stanford Stadium. To heavy-metal fans across the
campus, this was the final Insult. Why not just invite
Air Supply and Barrv Manllow while you're at It? Pro

testing metal-heads immediately staged a hunger
strike in the Stern Dining Hall. (Whieh. naturally,
went unnoticed.) Only by threatening to send a
horde of female groupies over to Hoover House was
the proposed concert nixed.
Student political groups are equally guilty of dis
crimination. The Equalizers chose their name in a
run for the COP in the knowledge that unsuspecting
metal-heads would vote for them. "1 was gonna hook
Jim Durkin up to my stereo, dude," said Amanda
Van Halen, chairman of the Bared Spikes Union
(BSU).
In resnonse to their exclusion from the Rainbow

Agenda, members of the BSU have released a list of
immediate demands of their own.
The demandz. dude:
□ We demand an immediate change In recruitment
and admissions policies. Stanford must advertise it
self among the heavy-metal community — preferably
through an MTV contest. Each heavy-metal fan ap
plying to Stanford would be entered in the contest,
with the winner receiving an all-expenses-paid date
with Ronnie James Dio or Lita Ford. Second place
would receive a date with George Michael or Whitney
Houston. All the losers receive dates with The Stan
ford Dailv's entertainment editor.

□ We demand the immediate establishment of a
heavy-metal theme house. We'll take Synergy.
□ We demand the immediate establishment of a
heavy-metal studies department. The heavy-metal
major can be interdisciplinary, drawing from a wide
range of departments: music. German studies (for
the Scorpions), geology (I wanna rock) and the pro
gram in acoustics and noise.
□ We demand an immediate increase in heavy-metal
faculty. Students are missing out on a multi-musical
education by the omission of head-banging profes
sors. Wouldn't your math prof, be that much more
interesting with Steve Stevens backing him up on
lead integral?

CDs don't grow on
trees, dude.

□ We demand an immediate increase in financial
aid for head-bangers. Hey, CDs don't grow on trees,
dude.
□ We demand that the University immediately build
a heavy-metal multimusical center. Heavy-metal fans
need a place to gather, to compare hair, to grunt in
unison. It could be called the Brawn Music Center.
□ We demand the Immediate establishment of a
heavy-metal Western Culture track: "Western Cul
ture: An Aluminum View." Students in this track
would approach the classics in a slightly different
way. the theory being that it is far more valuable to
study the great books by looking at the pictures.
Sadly there is much to be done before head
bangers are no longer alienated on campus. Only
when these demands are met will the true Stanford
heavy-metal fans feel welcome.
Both of them.
