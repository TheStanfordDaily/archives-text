Teresa Toranska
"Them": Stalin's Polish Puppets
New York: Harper and Row, 1987

Immediately after the Second World
War, the dispute over Poland's political
alignment was the gravest point of con
tention between the East and the West.
Though resolutions at Yalta called for free
elections in post-war Poland. Stalin had
insisted that whatever the outcome of the
elections, the government must be
"friendly" toward the Soviets. Realizing
that the Polish government-in-exile in
London and the Home Army organization
in Poland were unequivocally hostile
toward him. and fearing their popularity,
Stalin felt justified in flouting a fair elec
tion.
Because of teal and imagined Polish in
ternal resistance and plain social inertia
to communist "reform," Stalin exported
his brutal methods, setting up a "puppet"
ministry in Poland to carry out his
dictates. In "Them," Teresa Toranska in
terviews five of these Polish puppets. Her
interviews are fascinating, and, thanks to
her deft interviewing technique, hard to
put down once begun.
These transcripts are no monologic his
torical narratives. They more resemble
pitched polemics between the obviously
Solidarity-sympathetic Toranska and the
dogmatic officials; as such, they can be
quite hilarious. Once, Toranska persists
in contrasting the luxury accomodations
of party members to proletarian poverty.
Julia Mine, former editor in chief of the
Polish Press Agency and wife of a former
member of Poland's governing trium

verate, retorts in exasperation, "Dziunka
(addressing the dog), bark at the lady,
she's pretending to be a Solidarity fan."
In another interview. Roman Werfel. a
leading party ideologist, discusses how he
falsified historical documents "in the in
terests of the people's government." He
criticizes those "little boys from Solidarity
who run around . . . shouting Poland,
Poland,' " calling them "ignorant" and
"sick" because they can't understand the
benign necessity of document-doctoring.
The only response Toranska can muster
to that one is "Yes, I'm sick."
One of the book's strongest assets is the
painless way in which it includes exten
sive historical detail. Although keeping
track of the sundry politician's names
and abbreviated organization titles (like
PPR, PPS, PRL, PSL and RPPS) can be
frustrating, the interviews are laden with
significant facts and statistics. Toranska
exploits her formidable command of the
history of Eastern-bloc socialist a&uses to
dramatically and authoritatively contra
dict the half-truths with which the offi
cials try to fend off her questions.
It is at these moments, when
Toranska's subjects reveal themselves as
liars and gangsters, that their self
incriminating justifications emerge.
Stefan Staszeski, former first secretary of
the Warsaw committee, tells Toranska he
felt that everyone in the Polish Commu
nist administration "had a noose around
his neck"; confrontations with Stalin
were tantamount to suicide. Therefore —
so the implication goes — Poland's
leaders conceded "reasonably" on such is
sues as Soviet appropriation of eastern
Polish territory, seizure of Polish coal
without compensation, confiscation of all

wealth and industrial apparatus left be
hind by occupying Germans, deportation
of tens of thousands of Poles to Siberian
labor camps, and show trials with prede
termined death sentences for even Com
munist Poles.

The book affords a
rare and deep
glimpse into the
psychology of the
Stalinist phenome
non.

Toranska is willing to grant that the ac
tions of Stalin's Polish cadre were
reasonable as far as their own personal
freedoms were concerned. However, she
asserts, that does not mean they had any
right to impose their visions on Poland in
the first place. Jakub Berman, at one
time the second most powerful man in
Poland and head of the dreaded Polish Se
cret Police, is told by Toranska, "Part of
the nation spits on you, the other part
curses you, and about 90 percent don't
want you." His reply: "Well, let's say 90
percent, I won't haggle about percent
ages."

What, then, drove these men and
women to embark on a struggle against
the Polish people which they admit will
last until the unforseeable future? A par
ticular strength of the book is that
Toranska's subjects often focus on their
Utopian motivations, which in them
selves seem irreproachable. The story is
told of one prominent communist who. as
a child, often lay on the floor of his church
in the shape of a cross, praying for the
rebirth of Poland. At a time when commu
nist activity was severely persecuted, all
interviewees joined communist organiza
tions by their early 20s — Staszewski
joined at the age of 15. All seem to have
been convinced from early on that this
route was likeliest to lead to a strong and
healthy Polish nation.
To see this human dimension emerge
in Toranska's subjects alongside admis
sions of the crimes she imputes to them is
indeed odd. The reader is convinced of the
sincerity of their youthful optimism while
simultaneously appalled at its practical
outcome. Toranska conveys the message
that the mere fact of young idealism does
not excuse the crimes committed in its
name. Hitler, after all. was sure of the ob
jective value of his principles, yet that in
no way mitigates his deeds.
Besides moments of confrontation and
ruminations on events of great impor
tance, the interviews are fraught with re
vealing personal anecdotes. Berman
describes dancing with Molotov at
Stalin's dinner parties — Molotov leading
— with Stalin winding the grammaphone
until dawn. Staszewski tells of the unself
conscious contradictory logic of
Khrushchev's mind: Khrushchev ex

plained to him once that he was no anti-
Semite and always disapproved of Stalin's
attempts to organize pogroms, and yet
went on in the next breath to demand
that no Polish ministries or universities
allow more than a 2-percent Jewish en
rollment.
The sadistic contradictions of Stalin's
mind are also captured in anecdote: In
one story, he approached his next-door
neighbor one afternoon and compli
mented her on the beautiful roses in her
garden, and then had her arrested and
shot that evening. Episodes during
Khrushchev's period of "corn mania" (his
delusion that a corn-based economy
would be a panacea for all Eastern-bloc
economic ills) are vividly described.
Though they are funny, they attest to the
pathetic contingency of policy on the
leader's misguided whims.
Toranska's pugnacious interviewing
style and the sometimes absurd but al
ways intriguing response she elicits
makes this book worth the time invest
ment. It affords a rare and deep glimpse
into the psychology of the Stalinist phe
nomenon. Although the attitudes behind
fanatical obedience to the party are diffi
cult to understand, Toranska thoroughly
familiarizes us with them — the kind of
incomprehensible attitudes that
prompted thousands to willingly confess
false guilt during show trials out of the
conviction that the revolution could do no
wrong. Despite several comments of her
own that border on anti-Semitism.
Toranska has done a great service in re
cording these statements as a record of a
particularly painful and crucial moment
in European history, and as a universal
warning ol*the danger in blind zealotry.
