The board also rejected a pro

ASSU.
In the last ASSU election stu
dents rejected a fee assessment
to fund the salary of a faculty

adviser for the network. The
network's bylaws state that the
group must have a faculty advi
ser. Because of the defeat of the
adviser segment of their fee re
quest. network leaders were
forced to find alternative means
to fund the adviser s salary.
"The Tresidder Union Board
voted to recommend that Tres
idder would be willing to pay
the adviser's salary for a year,
based on a (joint) arrange
ment." said Nanci Howe, assis
tant director ol Tresidder Union.
Tresidder would pay the advi
ser's salary for next year only.
Howe said. "We would decide at
some point next year whether to
continue to pay the salary when
we evaluate al' programs and
priorities."
According to Howe, Events and
Services has also indicated inter
est in forming a working arrange
ment with the network.
Larry Davidson, associate direc
tor of Events and Services, said
his organization could provide an
administrative framework and a
source of advice for the network,
as well as co-produce large events.
The advisery services would be
provided by current staff, David
son said. If the network selects the
Eevents and Services offer, it
would not need a faculty adviser.
According to Howe, if the net
work chooses the Tresidder ar
rangement, it will begin a search
for a faculty adviser in July.
"We will base our decision on

how we would function and deal
with Tresidder Union and Events
and Services." said Tim Wood,
general manager of the network.
"We'll also look at the goals of the
parent organization and the direc
tion they want to take next year."
"We'd like to exist and function
like we do now and be (as) efficient
as possible." Wood said.
According to Wood, the network
will attempt to match its goals of
providing entertainment for stu
dents with the goals of its poten
tial parent organization.
Presently under the direction of
Tresidder Union, the network
must restructure its organization
because students rejected in the
April ASSU election the second
part of the network's fee assess
ment, which would have paid for a
portion of their faculty adviser's
salary, according to Kurt
Johnson. Concert Network board
chair.
In the upcoming week. Network
Director Phil Klein and Wood will
meet with Howe and Davidson "to
outline proposals to figure which
works best with our goals." Wood
said.
