# A
						movie reviewer turns against his brethren

### JAMES LUJAN Editorial staff 
James Lujan has been one of
The Daily's more hardy movie
reviewers during the past year,
fearlessly doing battle with a
whole plague of bad movies. Evi
dently. he's become rather burnt
out by the whole experience, be
cause for his last column he's
decided to bite the hand that
feeds him and talk about how he
thinks movie reviews are pretty
unimportant in the scheme of
things. Quite a change from the
bloated self-importance most crit
ics assign to themselves, eh? So
perhaps when you head off to the
nearby Octoplex this summer to
see "The Untouchables," the new
James Bond flick or whatever,
keep In mind that the critics may
be full of hot air. Of course, you
may already know this, in which
case the following article should
amuse you, since you get to see a
film reviewer turning on his own
kind.

I've been the Daily's regular
movie critic for the past year, and
since the year is coming to an end
(and since there aren't any new
movies to review), I thought I'd

wax philosophic and share my
thoughts on the entire institution
of movie reviewing.
I thought it would also be a good
time to answer those oft-asked
questions of "What is James
Lujan really like?" "Who's he going
out with this week?" It really
blows my mind that there are
people out there who actually
know that I write movie reviews
for The Dally. Pretty scary. The
first time I realized that people ac
tually took the time out to read the
bylines was when one guy came
up to me and told me that I suck
for panning a movie he had liked.
I don't know why people care or
even pay attention to what movie
critics say. Surely, what a movie
critic thinks of a movie can't be
any more important than what
another person thinks. I laugh at
those critics who consider them
selves to be "journalists" and I
can't figure out why film critiques
are associated with newspapers in
the first place. I mean, it's not
really a consumer service In the
sense that you get people to save
money by telling them to avoid
bad movies, especially since
movies like "Top Gun" and
"Rambo" were hated by most crit
ics, yet everyone went to see them

anyway. As far as I can tell, the
only journalistic worth that film
reviews have Is to point out
various trivial trends In the enter
tainment Industry and to tell
where a movie Is playing. If review
ing movies is so worthless, why do
I do it? Because it's a great job.
Anyone can be a film critic. You
don't need any fancy knowledge of
film history or criticism. It helps,
but It's not necessary. The only
qualifications you need are to be
able to say "Two tickets, please,"
and to know how to type In a story
on a keyboard. That's about it.
The best part of the whole deal is

that you actually get paid for
doing it. And the movies you cri
tique don't have to be art movies,
either.
The movies I've reviewed for The
Daily this year are "Blue Velvet,"
"Name of the Rose," "Streets of
Gold," "The Color of Money,"
'Round Midnight," "Star Trek
IV: The Voyage Home." "The Morn
ing After," "Crimes of the Heart,"
"Black Widow." "Platoon," "Angel
Heart," "Lethal Weapon." "Ex
treme Prejudice," "Malone" and
"Ishtar." The only movies out of
this batch that I've given some
what favorable reviews to are

" Round Midnight." "Star Trek
IV," "Platoon" and "Lethal
Weapon," and even then, these
critiques weren't glowing endorse
ments. either. There's not really
any process I go through when I
review a movie — it's either good
or it's bad — and as far as I'm con
cerned most movies today are un
creative barrels of crap.
Since every one of my reviews
has said something negative,
some people wonder if I've ever
liked a movie at all. Sure. I've liked
a few. To give an idea of what kind
of critic I am. I'm going to list my
all-time favorite movies. I'm going
to avoid such obligatory choices as
"intolerance." "The Battleship
Potemkin" and "Citizen Kane."
mainly because I enjoyed these
movies less than I admire their
historical significance. I'm also
going to avoid such classic choices
as "Gone with the Wind."
"Casablanca" and "High Noon."
mainly because I've never seen
these movies before. Instead, my
list consists of obvious choices —
mass-entertainment crowd
pleasers that suckered me in as
well. So here they are in no partic
ular order: "The Godfather. Part
II." "2001: A Space Odyssey."
"Last Tango in Paris," "Tootsie,"

"All the President's Men,"
"Network." "Jaws" and "Boda
cious Ta-Ta's." I'm just kidding
about the last one — just seeing If
you were still paying attention. I'm
sure I've liked a few other movies,
but I can't remember what they
were.
It doesn't matter though, since
you shouldn't be paying attention
to what I'm saying anyway. I think
you should consciously avoid
reading all movie reviews from
now on. You should go to a movie
without knowing whether it's
good or bad and exercise your
right as an American citizen to
like or dislike a movie without any
interference from the press. In
fact, I want you to go one step fur
ther. I want you to avoid movies all
together. There are things in life
more Important than movies, like
touching the soft petals of a pretty
flower or holding a delicate butter
fly in your hands. (Editor's note:
What the hell??) You should not
waste your valuable time vic
ariously living the lives of movie
characters. There are much better
things to do with your time, like
talking to people. Does anybody
talk to each other anymore? Or
does anybody read? Or. or. or . . .
