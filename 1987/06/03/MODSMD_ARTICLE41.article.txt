# Grooving through the '60s with Esquire
## 
### LISA LYNCH Editorial staff 
Until fairly iecently, 1 used to
think that Esquire was just an
other girlie magazine. Newsstands
tended to put it in or near the
"dirty" sections of their magazine
racks, somewhere in the gray zone
between Hustler and GQ. Sure, I
had heard people say that there
was quality journalism in
Esquire, but then, everyone says
that about Playboy, which you
can't even buy in the 7-11 any
more.
Now. confronted with an entire
anthology of quality journalism
from Esquire. I'm forced to reform
my opinion of the magazine. Or
rather. I've come to a new under
standing of what the magazine
used to be like; the anthology,
"Smiling Through The Apo
calypse," is a compendium of the
best and brightest writing from
Esquire in the '60s.
The editors of this anthology
truly threw me when they declared
that Esquire magazine invented
the journalistic style Tom Wolfe is
credited with titling "New Jour
nalism." They did so. according to
then-editor Harold Hayes, by
being the first to seduce available
writers into doing current-events
pieces for their magazine. "In the
'605," Hayes explains in his intro
duction, "events seemed to move
too quickly to allow the osmotic
process of art to keep abreast, and
when we found a good novelist we
immediately sought to seduce him
with the sweet mystery of current
events." Hayes was apparently
good at seduction. A lot of big
guns wrote for Esquire — includ
ing Saul Bellow. William Bur
roughs and Norman Mailer. Many
others used the magazine as a

launching pad for their careers.
There's a common factor that
binds all of these articles together,
but I find it difficult to pin down.
It should be Esquire's editorial
stance, which obviously deter
mines the content of the maga
zine. but the Esquire of the '60s
seems to have been far more
editorially amorphous than the
Esquire of today. Hayes says: "Few
magazines have successfully
defined their own attitude, and
Esquire is no exception. For a
while we called ours an effort
towards a rational view." Rational
is as rational does, however; all
the articles — except one written
by William F. Buckley in response
to Gore Vidal — are politically
liberal, either manifestos written
from the "right" side of '60s
causes or diatribes against the
Bad Guys.
The anthology is divided up into
seven sections. Each section tar
gets what the editors felt was a
major issue of the decade — politi-

cal, sociological and psychologi
cal. Though the final selection of
articles isn't a cohesive analysis of
the '60s, this division is fairly ef
fective.
In the first section, "The Rise

And Fall Of Charisma." five essays
about the Kennedys are grouped
with three about the Chicago con
vention riots; implicit here is that
these are the two poles of the
idealism and disillusion that sur
rounded the Kennedy and
Johnson elections. Norman
Mailer's "Superman Comes To
The Supermarket" is a classic
meditation on politician-as
product; the other Kennedy arti
cles are less interesting if you
aren't a Kennedy buff. All the con
vention articles, especially William
Burroughs' "The Coming Of The
Purple Better One." are a good
deal of fun; Esquire's decision to
send Burroughs and playwright
Jean Genet to cover the Demo
cratic convention is a successful
example of Haye's "seduction."
Part two. "Egos, Superegos and
Ids" groups together articles
about Khrushchev, Bogie, Sinatra
and Floyd Patterson. I found Saul
Bellow's Khrushchev article inac
cessible; he took a break from
"Herzog" to write it and it seems
his mind was on other things. The
Sinatra portrait, on the other
hand, was timely and revealing —
particularly in light of '80s media
ruminations about Sinatra.
"Some Failures in Communica
tions," the third section, covers
political fiascos ("The Credibility
Gap") youth uprisings ("The Gen
eration Gap") and racial tensions
("The Color Gap"). The political ar
ticles here are a bit oblique for
someone who isn't up on '60s his
tory, particularly Richard Rovere's
"The American Establishment."
Others, like Terry Southern's
"How I Signed Up At $250 A
Month For The Big Parade
through Havana blablabla and
Ended Up In Guatemala With The
CIA," are entertaining even if

you're not well-versed in Central
American politics.
The generation gap articles are
pretty standard; many will be
familiar to readers of '60s an
thologies. particularly Tom Wolfe's
"Tangerine Flake Streamline
Baby" and Antony Lukas' "Life
and Death of A Hippie." Wolfe's ar
ticle about teenage hot-rodding
and the very roots of teen
supremacy makes the '60s seem
very far away. Lukas' piece, on the
other hand, could have been writ
ten yesterday; there's just a tinge
of "Just Say No" in his meditation
on a life wasted by drugs and lack
of deodorant.
The editor's decision to group
"color gap" articles next to
"generation gap" articles is unfor
tunate. The five articles on race is
sues are good reading, particu
larly James Baldwin's "Fifth Ave
nue Uptown." in which Baldwin
visits the project-ridden ghetto of
his childhood, and Reese Cleg
horn's "The Segfs," about South
ern white segregationists. How
ever, the articles don't form a com
plete picture of what was going on
at the time: given the paucity of
coverage of the issue and the
awkward juxtaposition, we almost
feel as if the editors were suggest
ing a parallel between '60s blacks
and disaffected children.
Section five, "Living up to our
Commitment in Vietnam," has
only two articles, but both are
powerful. "Hell Sucks," a piece by
Michael Herr that was eventually
incorporated into his Vietnam
docu-journal "Dispatches," is an
excellent explication of the Tet of
fensive. Norman Porier's "An
American Atrocity" is an account
of a Marine squad's killing spree
in the town of Xuan Ngoc, shock
ing to read even after the recent

spate of "honest" Vietnam movies.
The last section, "Creative
Agonies" consists of fluffy, fun.
also often-anthologized articles.
Norman Mailer's "Some Children
Of The Goddess" is both a good
overview of what was "hot" in '60s

literature and a cursory tour of the
vast chambers of Mailer's ego. A
visit with Alan Ginsberg and Peter
Orlovsky in their Indian retreat is
entertaining, though too close to
cute, and John Wulp's "The Night
(after 10 names) All Saw, At Last,
What Was Happening" is one of
the collection's most dynamic ex
amples of you-are-there jour
nalism.
I don't know how I feel about the
last two pieces in the book, Buck
ley's "On Experiencing Gore Vidal"
and Vidal's "A Distasteful
Encounter With William F. Buck
ley." Since I wasn't too familiar
with the Buckley-Vidal conflict, I
was somewhat at a loss until I
finished both articles. When I fi
nally figured out what was going
on. I thought the pieces were
funny, but felt another inclusion
would have been more appropri
ate.
What I really wanted to see, in
stead of the Vidal-Buckley pieces,

were articles about what went on
in the women's movement during
the '60s. The section on women's
issues. "The Grass Roots of NOW."
is pathetic. There's an article by
Gina Berriault on the Condor
Club and Carol Doda, a piece by
Tom Wolfe about Las Vegas show
girls and "buttocks decollatage."
and a description of a contest held
by Pepsi-Cola in which the win
ners are allowed to keep all the
groceries they can carry out of a
supermarket in a half-hour's time.
What's going on here? It seems
as if the editors of Esquire are
trying to convince themselves, or
us, that the magazine had even a
cursory interest in women's is
sues. Better to fess up, boys.
But even if they can't be entirely
politically correct, when Esquire
editors are good they are very
good, and this anthology probably
represents the magazine at its
best, providing an informative
and entertaining collection of
right-liberal thinking. The final
question, however, is whether
this anthology fills any sort of
need. Although it is billed as "a
fresh and vital introduction to the
'60s era and to '60s style," the bet
ter pieces in the collection are
mostly available in slimmer or
more heterogeneous collections.
And some of the other pieces are, 1
think, too specific and dated for a
general interest anthology. For
students of New Journalism, this
is a good introduction, but Wolfe's
New Journalism anthology Is
more to the point. For serious '60s
fans, this book is an invaluable
reference — and for students of
New Journalism, I guess this is
where it all began. Still find that
hard to swallow. I'll have to wait
until the Playboy anthology goes
to press.

Burroughs' "The Coming Of The
Purple Better One." are a good
deal of fun; Esquire's decision to
send Burroughs and playwright
Jean Genet to cover the Demo
cratic convention is a successful
example of Haye's "seduction."
Part two. "Egos, Superegos and
Ids" groups together articles
about Khrushchev, Bogie, Sinatra
and Floyd Patterson. I found Saul
Bellow's Khrushchev article inac
cessible; he took a break from
"Herzog" to write it and it seems
his mind was on other things. The
Sinatra portrait, on the other
hand, was timely and revealing —
particularly in light of '80s media
ruminations about Sinatra.
"Some Failures in Communica
tions," the third section, covers
political fiascos ("The Credibility
Gap") youth uprisings ("The Gen
eration Gap") and racial tensions
("The Color Gap"). The political ar
ticles here are a bit oblique for
someone who isn't up on '60s his
tory, particularly Richard Rovere's
"The American Establishment."
Others, like Terry Southern's
"How I Signed Up At $250 A
Month For The Big Parade
through Havana blablabla and
Ended Up In Guatemala With The
CIA," are entertaining even if

you're not well-versed in Central
American politics.
The generation gap articles are
pretty standard; many will be
familiar to readers of '60s an
thologies. particularly Tom Wolfe's
"Tangerine Flake Streamline
Baby" and Antony Lukas' "Life
and Death of A Hippie." Wolfe's ar
ticle about teenage hot-rodding
and the very roots of teen
supremacy makes the '60s seem
very far away. Lukas' piece, on the
other hand, could have been writ
ten yesterday; there's just a tinge
of "Just Say No" in his meditation
on a life wasted by drugs and lack
of deodorant.
The editor's decision to group
"color gap" articles next to
"generation gap" articles is unfor
tunate. The five articles on race is
sues are good reading, particu
larly James Baldwin's "Fifth Ave
nue Uptown." in which Baldwin
visits the project-ridden ghetto of
his childhood, and Reese Cleg
horn's "The Segfs," about South
ern white segregationists. How
ever, the articles don't form a com
plete picture of what was going on
at the time: given the paucity of
coverage of the issue and the
awkward juxtaposition, we almost
feel as if the editors were suggest
ing a parallel between '60s blacks
and disaffected children.
Section five, "Living up to our
Commitment in Vietnam," has
only two articles, but both are
powerful. "Hell Sucks," a piece by
Michael Herr that was eventually
incorporated into his Vietnam
docu-journal "Dispatches," is an
excellent explication of the Tet of
fensive. Norman Porier's "An
American Atrocity" is an account
of a Marine squad's killing spree
in the town of Xuan Ngoc, shock
ing to read even after the recent

spate of "honest" Vietnam movies.
The last section, "Creative
Agonies" consists of fluffy, fun.
also often-anthologized articles.
Norman Mailer's "Some Children
Of The Goddess" is both a good
overview of what was "hot" in '60s

literature and a cursory tour of the
vast chambers of Mailer's ego. A
visit with Alan Ginsberg and Peter
Orlovsky in their Indian retreat is
entertaining, though too close to
cute, and John Wulp's "The Night
(after 10 names) All Saw, At Last,
What Was Happening" is one of
the collection's most dynamic ex
amples of you-are-there jour
nalism.
I don't know how I feel about the
last two pieces in the book, Buck
ley's "On Experiencing Gore Vidal"
and Vidal's "A Distasteful
Encounter With William F. Buck
ley." Since I wasn't too familiar
with the Buckley-Vidal conflict, I
was somewhat at a loss until I
finished both articles. When I fi
nally figured out what was going
on. I thought the pieces were
funny, but felt another inclusion
would have been more appropri
ate.
What I really wanted to see, in
stead of the Vidal-Buckley pieces,

were articles about what went on
in the women's movement during
the '60s. The section on women's
issues. "The Grass Roots of NOW."
is pathetic. There's an article by
Gina Berriault on the Condor
Club and Carol Doda, a piece by
Tom Wolfe about Las Vegas show
girls and "buttocks decollatage."
and a description of a contest held
by Pepsi-Cola in which the win
ners are allowed to keep all the
groceries they can carry out of a
supermarket in a half-hour's time.
What's going on here? It seems
as if the editors of Esquire are
trying to convince themselves, or
us, that the magazine had even a
cursory interest in women's is
sues. Better to fess up, boys.
But even if they can't be entirely
politically correct, when Esquire
editors are good they are very
good, and this anthology probably
represents the magazine at its
best, providing an informative
and entertaining collection of
right-liberal thinking. The final
question, however, is whether
this anthology fills any sort of
need. Although it is billed as "a
fresh and vital introduction to the
'60s era and to '60s style," the bet
ter pieces in the collection are
mostly available in slimmer or
more heterogeneous collections.
And some of the other pieces are, 1
think, too specific and dated for a
general interest anthology. For
students of New Journalism, this
is a good introduction, but Wolfe's
New Journalism anthology Is
more to the point. For serious '60s
fans, this book is an invaluable
reference — and for students of
New Journalism, I guess this is
where it all began. Still find that
hard to swallow. I'll have to wait
until the Playboy anthology goes
to press.


Until fairly iecently, 1 used to
think that Esquire was just an
other girlie magazine. Newsstands
tended to put it in or near the
"dirty" sections of their magazine
racks, somewhere in the gray zone
between Hustler and GQ. Sure, I
had heard people say that there
was quality journalism in
Esquire, but then, everyone says
that about Playboy, which you
can't even buy in the 7-11 any
more.
Now. confronted with an entire
anthology of quality journalism
from Esquire. I'm forced to reform
my opinion of the magazine. Or
rather. I've come to a new under
standing of what the magazine
used to be like; the anthology,
"Smiling Through The Apo
calypse," is a compendium of the
best and brightest writing from
Esquire in the '60s.
The editors of this anthology
truly threw me when they declared
that Esquire magazine invented
the journalistic style Tom Wolfe is
credited with titling "New Jour
nalism." They did so. according to
then-editor Harold Hayes, by
being the first to seduce available
writers into doing current-events
pieces for their magazine. "In the
'605," Hayes explains in his intro
duction, "events seemed to move
too quickly to allow the osmotic
process of art to keep abreast, and
when we found a good novelist we
immediately sought to seduce him
with the sweet mystery of current
events." Hayes was apparently
good at seduction. A lot of big
guns wrote for Esquire — includ
ing Saul Bellow. William Bur
roughs and Norman Mailer. Many
others used the magazine as a

launching pad for their careers.
There's a common factor that
binds all of these articles together,
but I find it difficult to pin down.
It should be Esquire's editorial
stance, which obviously deter
mines the content of the maga
zine. but the Esquire of the '60s
seems to have been far more
editorially amorphous than the
Esquire of today. Hayes says: "Few
magazines have successfully
defined their own attitude, and
Esquire is no exception. For a
while we called ours an effort
towards a rational view." Rational
is as rational does, however; all
the articles — except one written
by William F. Buckley in response
to Gore Vidal — are politically
liberal, either manifestos written
from the "right" side of '60s
causes or diatribes against the
Bad Guys.
The anthology is divided up into
seven sections. Each section tar
gets what the editors felt was a
major issue of the decade — politi-

cal, sociological and psychologi
cal. Though the final selection of
articles isn't a cohesive analysis of
the '60s, this division is fairly ef
fective.
In the first section, "The Rise

And Fall Of Charisma." five essays
about the Kennedys are grouped
with three about the Chicago con
vention riots; implicit here is that
these are the two poles of the
idealism and disillusion that sur
rounded the Kennedy and
Johnson elections. Norman
Mailer's "Superman Comes To
The Supermarket" is a classic
meditation on politician-as
product; the other Kennedy arti
cles are less interesting if you
aren't a Kennedy buff. All the con
vention articles, especially William
Burroughs' "The Coming Of The
Purple Better One." are a good
deal of fun; Esquire's decision to
send Burroughs and playwright
Jean Genet to cover the Demo
cratic convention is a successful
example of Haye's "seduction."

Of The Goddess" is both a good
overview of what was "hot" in '60s

literature and a cursory tour of the
vast chambers of Mailer's ego. A
visit with Alan Ginsberg and Peter
Orlovsky in their Indian retreat is
entertaining, though too close to
cute, and John Wulp's "The Night
(after 10 names) All Saw, At Last,
What Was Happening" is one of
the collection's most dynamic ex
amples of you-are-there jour
nalism.
I don't know how I feel about the
last two pieces in the book, Buck
ley's "On Experiencing Gore Vidal"
and Vidal's "A Distasteful
Encounter With William F. Buck
ley." Since I wasn't too familiar
with the Buckley-Vidal conflict, I
was somewhat at a loss until I
finished both articles. When I fi
nally figured out what was going
on. I thought the pieces were
funny, but felt another inclusion
would have been more appropri
ate.
What I really wanted to see, in
stead of the Vidal-Buckley pieces,

were articles about what went on
in the women's movement during
the '60s. The section on women's
issues. "The Grass Roots of NOW."
is pathetic. There's an article by
Gina Berriault on the Condor
Club and Carol Doda, a piece by
Tom Wolfe about Las Vegas show
girls and "buttocks decollatage."
and a description of a contest held
by Pepsi-Cola in which the win
ners are allowed to keep all the
groceries they can carry out of a
supermarket in a half-hour's time.
What's going on here? It seems
as if the editors of Esquire are
trying to convince themselves, or
us, that the magazine had even a
cursory interest in women's is
sues. Better to fess up, boys.
But even if they can't be entirely
politically correct, when Esquire
editors are good they are very
good, and this anthology probably
represents the magazine at its
best, providing an informative
and entertaining collection of
right-liberal thinking. The final
question, however, is whether
this anthology fills any sort of
need. Although it is billed as "a
fresh and vital introduction to the
'60s era and to '60s style," the bet
ter pieces in the collection are
mostly available in slimmer or
more heterogeneous collections.
And some of the other pieces are, 1
think, too specific and dated for a
general interest anthology. For
students of New Journalism, this
is a good introduction, but Wolfe's
New Journalism anthology Is
more to the point. For serious '60s
fans, this book is an invaluable
reference — and for students of
New Journalism, I guess this is
where it all began. Still find that
hard to swallow. I'll have to wait
until the Playboy anthology goes
to press.
