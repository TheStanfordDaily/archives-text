offers Americans Ed McMahon
and Its famous sweepstakes.
California offers residents its
lottery. Harrah's offers gam
bling hounds its Casino.
And the American Express
office In San Francisco, in con
junction with Trans World
Airlines, true to the spirit of
sweepstakes merchandising,
offers Stanford students flying
TWA to their overseas study
centers the ultimate prize: a
free round-trip airline ticket to
the center they will be attend
ing.
Any Stanford students going
overseas who purchase a
round-trip TWA ticket through
American Express Travel are
automatically entered in the
raffle for the free ticket, accord
ing to Otha Greer, travel coun
selor for American Express In
San Francisco.
According to Greer, the raffle
has been held each quarter
since last fall as an incentive to
get students to buy specially ar
ranged group tickets, although
students traveling individually
on TWA are eligible as well.
The program "has been very
well-received," Greer said, "It's
very exciting. . . . Students
really seem to be getting into
the raffle."
Stanford Medical School stu
dent Carolyn Drake, who won
the raffle for this summer quar
ter, agreed. "The day I found
out that I had won, I was ec
static," she said. "It was espe
cially nice since I had totaled
my car earlier in the day. Win
ning the ticket sort of balanced
things out."
Drake, who will study at
Stanford's summer focus pro
gram in Oxford, said she will
give the ticket to her husband
to use to visit her. "My husband

was planning to visit me in
England for a few weeks on
MasterCard, anyway," she said.
"Now it's on TWA."
Junior Maria Robles Meier,
who spent winter quarter at
Stanford in Vienna, recalls that
she was very surprised to learn
she had won the raffle.
"An American Express agent
made a presentation about the
raffle at the very beginning of
our orientation (before going
overseas)," she said. "But I for
got all about It, and when they
called me several weeks later to
tell me I had won I said, 'What
raffle?' "
Meier gave the ticket to her
mother as a Christmas present.
"Over spring break my mother
flew to meet me in Vienna, and
we spent about 10 days travel
ing through Austria, Switzer
land and France," Meier said.
"She had never been to Europe
before — it meant so much
more to her than me taking
home pictures to her (would
have)."
The raffle winner for this
quarter, junior Molly New
comer, also gave her prize
ticket to her mother, who
joined her daughter in Tours
for several days. The two had "a
wonderful time," Molly New
comer said.
Overseas Studies Student
Services Coordinator Charles
Spolyar praised the program.
"It's nice of TWA to make this
ticket available to stu
dents. ... I don't know if this
convinces any more students to
purchase group tickets, but I
do know that the winners have
had a good time."
Greer said that because of
the enthusiasm the raffles has
generated, TWA intends to con
tinue the giveaway next year —
beginning with the raffle for fall
quarter, which will be held
Sept. 3.
