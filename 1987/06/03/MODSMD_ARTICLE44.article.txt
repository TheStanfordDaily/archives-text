# Ethics in science conference here

### DAVID LIPPEATT Editorial staff 
A vision philosopher Bertrand
Russell and scientist Albert
Einstein held 30 years ago will
become reality this summer at
Stanford for a group of lucky stu
dents from all over the globe.
At the fifth Biennial Student
Pugwash U.S.A. International
Conference — "Choices for Our
Generation: Ethics and Values at
the Cutting Edge of Technology,"
to be held on campus June 28 to
July 2—loo students from 21
different countries will meet with
more than 40 leaders in the fields
of science, business, government,
engineering and the humanities;
they will discuss questions about
the role of science and technology
in modern society.
The conference "is all about
bringing students and profession
als together so they can have a
dialogue about ethical issues in
science," said senior Camilla
Seth, press director for Student
Pugwash U.S.A., the organization
sponsoring the conference.
Issues dealt with during the
conference might include, for ex
ample, the widespread use of fos
sil fuel, "which facilitates the pro
duction of a host of consumer
goods and services but contri
butes to such problems as acid
rain and the so-called 'greenhouse
effect,' " according to Seth.
The conference will consist of
two separate parts. In the morn
ings, six different seminars of stu
dents and professionals will con
vene behind closed doors for frank
discussions focusing on nuclear
proliferation, surrogate mother
hood, water pollution and supply,
and other issues, Seth said.
In the afternoons, conference

participants will meet together for
speeches, panel discussions and
film screenings, all of which are
open to the public. Among the
events featured are an address by
Roger Boisjoly, former Morton-
Thiokol engineer and current
plaintiff in a lawsuit against
them, on the decision to launch
the space shuttle Challenger, and
a discussion by director Adrian
Malone on the creation of the PBS
television series "The Ascent of
Man."
According to Seth, the confer
ence is important for the student
participants because "as young
people entering various science
and technology-related fields — of
ten with serious ethical questions
— students at the conference can
ask questions of people already
there (in those fields)."
"Students can gain a better per
spective on these ethical issues
from people in places the students
see themselves in the future."
Seth said.
Senior Beth Cheng, one of two
student participants from Stan
ford, said "personal reasons" led
her to become involved in the con
ference. "I've always felt like my in
terests were a little 'off the wall'
compared to most people here. I'm
a history major, but I'm really in
terested in science issues," Cheng
said, adding that the Pugwash
conference seemed to offer an in
triguing blend of science and so
cial science perspectives.
She is also excited about spend
ing time with students who share
these interests, she said. Cheng
will participate during the confer
ence in a morning seminar focus
ing on "Dilemmas for the Future
of Computing."
"I'm interested in the question
of whether the increasing pres

ence of computers in society will
lead to more human dependence
on them or will [serve to] free
people from rote tasks and allow
them to exercise their creativity,"
she explained.
Student Pugwash U.S.A. is a
non-profit educational organiza
tion "devoted to improving stu
dents' awareness and understand
ing of the ethical and social di
mensions of decisions about sci
ence and technology," according
to a Pugwash press release.
As the organization's director,
Benjamin Austin (a 1986 Stanford
graduate) explains it, the group is

one of 10 national Student Pug
wash societies with similar goals.
The groups take their name from
the 195J5 "Pugwash Manifesto."
(named after the fishing village of
Pugwash in Nova Scotia), which
was written by Bertrand Russell
and supported by Albert Einstein
and expresses concern about the
ethical dimensions of the arms
race.
This document spawned the an
nual series of Pugwash Confer
ences on Science and World Af
fairs. which are attended by some

of the world's foremost scientists,
including, for example. Stanford
Nobel Laureates Linus Pauling
and Robert Hofstadter. The aim of
these gatherings has been to
reach policy consensuses which
scientists can then take home and
use to advise their respective gov
ernments' officials.
The Student Pugwash groups
have no direct connection to the
"senior" Pugwash groups, Austin
said. The student organizations
began to take shape in 1977 and

'78 when "a UC-San Diego under
graduate named Jeffrey Lelfer at
tended the senior Pugwash con
ferences and came away with the
conviction that students should
have a larger voice in the discus
sion of these ethical issues."
"Leifer was also Intelligent
enough to realize that since
eminent scientists' recommen
dations were being ignored by
their governments, students
would have no real chance of
being heard." Austin continued.
"He organized the first student
Pugwash at UCSD in 1979 to deal
with the 'tougher questions' in the
ethics of science, instead of trying
to issue policy statements."

The student conferences contin
ued every two years in this vein,
with the 1981 conference at Yale,
the 1983 conference at the Univer
sity of Michigan and the 1985 con
ference at Princeton. Austin said.
Austin himself attended the
Princeton conference and was
"profoundly affected." he said.
Being director of this year's con
ference has been "incredibly cool
and fun." Austin said. "There's
nothing like being in charge of an
organization, of having artistic
control' over it."
As Student Pugwash Director.
Austin said he "was in a position
to be taken seriously by some very
high-powered people."
