# Students help local hunger relief efforts
## 
### ANN MARSH Staff writer 
A suburban Disneyland for shopping
fanatics and a community playground enjoyed
by Stanford students, the University Avenue
area is a gathering point in downtown Palo
Alto.
More and more frequently, however, a
glaring contradiction to the affluence of the
street, and the surrounding community, is ap
pearing alongside the attractive shop windows
of this main thoroughfare.
On one block, a transient man wanders with
a bedroll on his back; on the next, an elderly
woman carries her belongings in paper sacks.
This visible suffering represents only a small
fraction of the hidden but growing population
of people living below the poverty line in Palo
Alto and neighboring towns.
Over the years, a number of grass-roots or
ganizations have emerged to respond to the
hungry and homeless persons' acute need in
the community.
One emergency hunger relief program, the
Food Closet, at All Saints Episcopal Church,
(located on Waverley just off University), pro
vided food for over 10,000 people in 1986, ac
cording to Gretchen Emmons, a coordinator
and Food Closet board member.
The Food Closet is entirely run by volun
teers, Emmons said.
The idea for the Food Closet, which cele
brated its 10th anniversary last Nov. 1, was
conceived by community member Patsy
McAfee. According to Emmons. McAfee
became concerned when she discovered that
people who came to her church for food were

turned away because the pastor, who had been
helping them, no longer had enough food.
McAfee persuaded six downtown churches
to establish an emergency hunger relief pro
gram — The Food Closet. Later, a second Food
Closet was established in South Palo Alto.
Today 11 local churches are represented on
the Food Closet board of directors, and many
others contribute regularly to the organiza
tion.
Since early last fall, Stanford has become
one of these contributors through the individ
ual efforts of several students who live on
campus in the Suites.
At the beginning of fall quarter, Doug
Abrams and Hassan Carroll, along with their
suite-mates, noticed that a good deal of leftover
food in their eating club, Avanti, was thrown
away daily.
The six roommates arranged to take turns
driving this food down to the Food Closet five
days a week. Abrams said that the task is
simple and takes about 20 minutes.
Following suit, junior Joy Roe organized her
eating club, the Bollard, to donate excess food
to the Food Closet. The Sigma Alpha Epsilon
fraternity has since implemented a similar
plan.
Now that "a real working program" has been
established, Abrams hopes to expand his
"Food Closet-campus connection plan" next
year to include more student living groups.
The Food Closet is supported by donations
from churches, supermarkets such as Safeway
and Draeger's, and individual gifts of mostly
non-perishable goods. Stanford donations of
cooked food and fresh fruit, which make up a
small percentage of the total food stock, are

very popular among clients, said Emmons.
"It's been wonderful, and is really appreci
ated," Emmons said of the food from Stanford.
"We've had clients come back to us and say,
'That was really good.' (The Food Closet] is not
just a dumping ground. People really appreci
ate [the donations]."
"By nature you're going to have some waste
on campus — It's no one's fault," Abrams said.
"The goal of the Food Closet is to cut down on
that waste.
"There is less waste in our club now because
people know that the food that is not being
eaten is going to someone," he said.
According to Abrams. the small scale of the
project is one of the reasons for Its success.
"We try to keep it 'grass roots' and local." he
said. "(The Food Closet-campus connection]
gets a lot of people involved who aren't nor
mally volunteers — and that's great."
But still, he added, "there needs to be a more
consistent relationship with the community as
a support system because there is hunger in
our own backyard — and it's hunger we can do
something about."
Roe is one of many Stanford students who,
in addition to delivering food to the Food
Closet, volunteers a couple of hours a week to
distribute the food.
"I had no idea that there were so many
hungry people out there in Palo Alto," Roe said.
"It's hard to imagine that there are people
starving when there's so much food here.".
Members of the Food Closet board of direc
tors said the number of people coming to the
Food Closet has steadily risen from approxi-
mately 1.000 in 1977 to 10.000
last year. Of the 836 people who
came' to the Food Closet in March,
over 367 were children, according
to Emmons.
However. Rev. Jim Burklo. min
ister and director of the Urban
Ministry of Palo Alto (a member of
(he Food Closet), cautioned that
gathering accurate statistics
about the Food Closet is difficult
because many clients give false
names and addresses.
It is also difficult to keep track of
transient people, he said.
"Our primary concern is to be
helpful to people. We're not inter
ested in being policemen." Burklo
said.
Burklo pointed out that there is
a problem with people who come
to depend on programs such as
the Food Closet and the Urban
Ministry.
"1 think that our job is to be will
ing to be in an impossible situa
tion. which sometimes means
being a part of a cycle of depen

dency," he said, explaining that
the problem of hunger is a
"quandary" but not a hopeless sit
uation.
Going to hunger-relief programs
"is a hell of a way to have to get
your food." Burklo said. "It's a lot
of work to hustle for survival."
While admitting that some
clients abuse the Food Closet pro
gram. Emmons said she believes
the Reagan budget cuts have put
increasing numbers of people on
the streets. "We relate (the rising
number of people coming to the
Food Closet) to the present admin
istration cutbacks in social ser
vice programs," she said.
After the Reagan administra
tion began reducing and modify
ing social service programs in
1981, the next year saw increas
ingly widespread signs of hunger,
according to a February 1987 arti
cle in Scientific American by J.
Larry Brown.
"Almost one in 10 Californians
— 2.3 million each month — relies
on emergency food charities for
bare sustenance, and thousands
of others are turned away." ac
cording to a recent article in the
San Francisco Examiner.

The problems of hunger and
homelessness are in some ways
worse in a town like Palo Alto than
in a poorer community, according
to Emmons.
"If you're at the poverty line in
an affluent community like this
you're going to have a lot of prob
lems because survival can be so
difficult." she said.
With the high property values in
Palo Alto, "people who are poor
today don't have homes because
landlords won't put up with dou
bling up in (housing) units." ac
cording to Burklo.
Most Food Closet clients ques
tioned said they did not know
what they would do without the
weekly food supplement they
receive from the organization.
• Alice Boortz, a Food Closet vol
unteer for over eight years, said
that many people tell her, "If it
hadn't been for the Food Closet we
just wouldn't have made it."
In addition to hunger, many
homeless people suffer from a lack
of social contact, according to
Burklo. Volunteers at the Urban
Ministry and the Food Closet try
"to love and respect these folks"
above all, he said.

One man who comes to the Food
Closet said it was important for
him to maintain his dignity
despite receiving food donations.
"I thought the people (at the Food
Closet) were really nice, really
human, not condescending in any
way."
"You think only poor people lose
their jobs, but everybody does,"
said Roe. "When you're poor and
lose your job. you've got no sup
port system."
Through the Public Service Cen
ter. the three-year-old Stanford
Volunteer Network is working to
establish support systems for im
poverished people locally and
worldwide through various pro
grams on campus.
According to Magdalena Fit
toria. a coordinator at the Public
Service Center, these projects in
clude: fasts and food point dona
tion drives by the Stanford Inter
national Development Organiza
tion (SIDO), fund-raising and edu
cational programs by Bike Aid vol
unteers, and periodic food drives
including end-of-the-quarter food
collection from the University
Food Service.
