# Students help local hunger relief efforts

### ANN MARSH Staff writer 
A suburban Disneyland for shopping
fanatics and a community playground enjoyed
by Stanford students, the University Avenue
area is a gathering point in downtown Palo
Alto.
More and more frequently, however, a
glaring contradiction to the affluence of the
street, and the surrounding community, is ap
pearing alongside the attractive shop windows
of this main thoroughfare.
On one block, a transient man wanders with
a bedroll on his back; on the next, an elderly
woman carries her belongings in paper sacks.
This visible suffering represents only a small
fraction of the hidden but growing population
of people living below the poverty line in Palo
Alto and neighboring towns.
Over the years, a number of grass-roots or
ganizations have emerged to respond to the
hungry and homeless persons' acute need in
the community.
One emergency hunger relief program, the
Food Closet, at All Saints Episcopal Church,
(located on Waverley just off University), pro
vided food for over 10,000 people in 1986, ac
cording to Gretchen Emmons, a coordinator
and Food Closet board member.
The Food Closet is entirely run by volun
teers, Emmons said.
The idea for the Food Closet, which cele
brated its 10th anniversary last Nov. 1, was
conceived by community member Patsy
McAfee. According to Emmons. McAfee
became concerned when she discovered that
people who came to her church for food were

turned away because the pastor, who had been
helping them, no longer had enough food.
McAfee persuaded six downtown churches
to establish an emergency hunger relief pro
gram — The Food Closet. Later, a second Food
Closet was established in South Palo Alto.
Today 11 local churches are represented on
the Food Closet board of directors, and many
others contribute regularly to the organiza
tion.
Since early last fall, Stanford has become
one of these contributors through the individ
ual efforts of several students who live on
campus in the Suites.
At the beginning of fall quarter, Doug
Abrams and Hassan Carroll, along with their
suite-mates, noticed that a good deal of leftover
food in their eating club, Avanti, was thrown
away daily.
The six roommates arranged to take turns
driving this food down to the Food Closet five
days a week. Abrams said that the task is
simple and takes about 20 minutes.
Following suit, junior Joy Roe organized her
eating club, the Bollard, to donate excess food
to the Food Closet. The Sigma Alpha Epsilon
fraternity has since implemented a similar
plan.
Now that "a real working program" has been
established, Abrams hopes to expand his
"Food Closet-campus connection plan" next
year to include more student living groups.
The Food Closet is supported by donations
from churches, supermarkets such as Safeway
and Draeger's, and individual gifts of mostly
non-perishable goods. Stanford donations of
cooked food and fresh fruit, which make up a
small percentage of the total food stock, are

very popular among clients, said Emmons.
"It's been wonderful, and is really appreci
ated," Emmons said of the food from Stanford.
"We've had clients come back to us and say,
'That was really good.' (The Food Closet] is not
just a dumping ground. People really appreci
ate [the donations]."
"By nature you're going to have some waste
on campus — It's no one's fault," Abrams said.
"The goal of the Food Closet is to cut down on
that waste.
"There is less waste in our club now because
people know that the food that is not being
eaten is going to someone," he said.
According to Abrams. the small scale of the
project is one of the reasons for Its success.
"We try to keep it 'grass roots' and local." he
said. "(The Food Closet-campus connection]
gets a lot of people involved who aren't nor
mally volunteers — and that's great."
But still, he added, "there needs to be a more
consistent relationship with the community as
a support system because there is hunger in
our own backyard — and it's hunger we can do
something about."
Roe is one of many Stanford students who,
in addition to delivering food to the Food
Closet, volunteers a couple of hours a week to
distribute the food.
"I had no idea that there were so many
hungry people out there in Palo Alto," Roe said.
"It's hard to imagine that there are people
starving when there's so much food here.".
Members of the Food Closet board of direc
tors said the number of people coming to the
Food Closet has steadily risen from approxi-
