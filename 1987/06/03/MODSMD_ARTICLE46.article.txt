# Group sends members to 59 countries
## Students seek professional experience with AIESEC 
### ANN MARSH Staff writer 
Each year, while many Stanford students spend a
quarter or longer studying abroad at one of the Uni
versity's overseas centers, a few of them seek profes
sional experience working in a foreign country with
AIESEC (pronounced "eye-sec"), a student-run or
ganization at Stanford.
This year, members of the AIESEC Stanford local
committee will be working as interns in Greece,
Japan, Yugoslavia, the Philippines and Australia.
"The thing that's incredible about going overseas
with AIESEC is that there's a real support network
(set up by each country's local committees)." said Jsa
Jsa Pineda, a senior and past president of AIESEC
Stanford. "It's not like going overseas with Stanford
(Overseas Studies), where it's really hard to meet the
local people."
According to Pineda, local committees welcome
AIESEC trainees to their countries with reception
activities and also help plan their work and social
lives throughout their stay.
AIESEC Stanford, one of over 400 local committees
In 59 countries, was one of the founding U.S. chap
ters when the organization branched out to the
United States from Europe in 1958.
AIESEC is a French acronym for the International
Association of Students in Economics and Business
Management.
Local committees, such as Stanford, convince
members of the surrounding business community to
take on AIESEC trainees from abroad, according to
Senior Emi Usui, a vice president of Stanford
AIESEC. For every internship that AIESEC Stanford
secures for a foreign student, a corresponding In

ternship is then reserved for a Stanford student in
another country.
In recent years the group has experienced an in
crease in Interest on campus and a corresponding
jump In membership, said current AIESEC Presi
dent Maher Al-Jubcir.
Several AIESEC members said they used their in
ternships to supplement their time studying abroad
with practical work experience that provided new in
sights into a foreign culture.
After six months studying In Florence with Stan
ford, senior Palmer Colamarino said he "still felt like
an American tourist."
After completing the Stanford program,
Colamarino went to work on an AIESEC internship
in an Italian bank. "At work nobody spoke English
and I was forced to speak Italian." he said. "My lan
guage skills improved 100-fold at least."
However, the best part of the internship was the
people and not the job. according to Colamarino. "To
have support from people you don't even know In a
new environment was tremendous. The experience
was phenomenal because of the people." he said.
After studying in Tours, France with Stanford.
Usui went to Switzerland for a seven-week AIESEC
internship over the summer. "Being an econ major. I
wanted to get some practical business experience."
Usui said. "Stanford students get a lot of theoretical
knowledge, but AIESEC provides a practical back
ground.
"One of the best things Is the International expo
sure to different thoughts and practices, and the op
portunity to meet people from all over the world," she
said.
A number of Stanford "AIESECers" said they

choose not to work abroad but gain business experi
ence working with the local chapter.
Last month. AIESEC Stanford, along with AIESEC
San Jose, held a reception for the local business
community that was hosted by ALZA Corporation.
The purpose of such projects is to convince busi
nesses to follow in the footsteps of companies like
Amdahl Corporation, Asset Management and IBM,
which currently provide jobs for 10 foreign trainees
locally, said Suzi Sarka, a junior and AIESEC mar
keting director.
Other local AIESEC responsibilities include fund
raising for national events such as the 1988 AIESEC
International Congress, which will be held in Boston
in February. More than 4.000 students are matched
to Internships annually through the International
Congress.

"For any person who doesn't have the time to go on
an internship, lAIESEC] offers practical business ex
perience" in the local community, said Calvin Tsay. a
sophomore and AIESEC fund-raising director.
"Marketing increases your interviewing skills
tremendously," said Colamarino, who will be
working for Arthur Young, an accounting firm in
San Francisco, after graduation. "I'm confident that
that's one of the reasons I got the job that I did. I feel
a lot more at ease talking with professionals (than
before AIESEC)."
AIESEC was founded by seven European nations
in 1948 in the aftermath of World War 11. The organi
zation's International Exchange Program was con
ceived to promote peace and understanding through
increased communication among the world's busi
ness leaders, according to Usui.
