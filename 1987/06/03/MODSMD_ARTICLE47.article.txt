# Bug on gum and the fifth dentist

Dear Bug Me:
How much money is there in
the world?
- Imelda Marcos
After receiving opinions from
the folks at the Jonsson Library
of Government Documents and
the United Nation's Interna
tional Monetary Fund — like
"How stupid, nobody knows
that" — I plodded happily on.
The answer, in very un
polished form, was to be found
in International Currency Anal
ysis' 1985 World Currency
Yearbook. It took a large hunk
of tallying to merge the statis
tics from the major 125
countries of the free world into
sum form. Note here that vital

financial stuff is not something
that the people in the non-free
world governments are too
excited about having floating
around the Bay Area.
And so. speaking strictly for
the free world, we come to the
point. As of the end of 1984.
there was ® 1,792,169,341.57
(about * 1.8 trillion) in actual
currency circulating about. We
also come upon another
statistical tidbit called money
supply. This represents cur
rency as well as demand
deposits — how much everyone
could theoretically get by
withdrawing all of their money
from accessible accounts (like
checking and savings but not
certificates of deposit). That s
Ml for all you Econ 1 veterans:

Dear Bug Me:
IJfour out ojjlve dentists recom
mend sugarless gum for their
patients who chew gum. what
the heck does the fifth dentist rec
ommend?
- J.R. Wrigley
Contrary to hopes that dentists
would either A) have a sense of
humor or B) do desperate things
to keep business up — that fifth
dentist wasn't recommending
sugar-laden gum. Throughout all
three of Trident's 1,200-dentlst
studies, the fifth dentists were the
ones insisting on masticular
abstention (non-chewing) even for
"their patients who chew gum."
Dear Bug Me:
What's the IQ of the average
Stanford student?
- Jeswan Dring

There are lots of hurdles In the
way to finding an actual answer
for this. For starters, no office on
campus Is willing to let on that
they've been keeping track of any
standardized average (like average
SAT scores). Sure, Undergraduate
Admissions will give out general
ranges, but they'd rather not have
folks thinking "Oh. the average Is
only 516, I got a 534 — I'm In" or
"Rats. I won't even apply, I'll never
get In with a 507." The reminder
Is that half of every population Is
below average.
Moving right along, though,
we've got a few large hints. Using
the SAT ranges from the class of
1990, 50 percent of the folks
scored between 600 and 700 on
the verbal, while 56 percent got
between 700 and 800 on the
math. Luckily you've asked about
the IQ of the average Stanford stu
dent. rather than the average of all
IQ's at Stanford. Let's picture an
average student who scored, like
many folks, between those two
ranges. As the College Board was
so kind to say. the average SAT
taker scores 44 points higher on
the math than the verbal. That

makes our student's score 722 for
math and 678 for verbal, good for
a total score of 1,400. (Quite
unlikely. I must say. but this
whole scheme is pretty contrived
anyway, so please bear with me.)
We leap onward in blind faith.
The minimum SAT score for ad
mittance into MENSA, the self
appointed society for genius
types. is a combined math and
verbal score of 1.250. Likewise,
the society accepts a minimum
score of 132 on the Stanford-Binet
test for entrance. The Stanford-
Binet happens to measure its
results in the ever-loved Intelli
gence Quotient points. It then
stands to unfaltering reason
(maybe) that anyone who has
scored 1,250 on SAT possesses an
IQ of 132.
And now, throwing valid inter
polation into the wind, we find the
ratio of 1,250 to 1.400 is equal to
the ratio of 132 to 148. Voila, the
IQ of the average Stanford student
is 148. Isn't math fun?
So kids, please keep your super
genius status in mind as you head
off into finals.

below average.
Moving right along, though,
we've got a few large hints. Using
the SAT ranges from the class of
1990, 50 percent of the folks
scored between 600 and 700 on
the verbal, while 56 percent got
between 700 and 800 on the
math. Luckily you've asked about
the IQ of the average Stanford stu
dent. rather than the average of all
IQ's at Stanford. Let's picture an
average student who scored, like
many folks, between those two
ranges. As the College Board was
so kind to say. the average SAT
taker scores 44 points higher on
the math than the verbal. That

makes our student's score 722 for
math and 678 for verbal, good for
a total score of 1,400. (Quite
unlikely. I must say. but this
whole scheme is pretty contrived
anyway, so please bear with me.)
We leap onward in blind faith.
The minimum SAT score for ad
mittance into MENSA, the self
appointed society for genius
types. is a combined math and
verbal score of 1.250. Likewise,
the society accepts a minimum
score of 132 on the Stanford-Binet
test for entrance. The Stanford-
Binet happens to measure its
results in the ever-loved Intelli
gence Quotient points. It then
stands to unfaltering reason
(maybe) that anyone who has
scored 1,250 on SAT possesses an
IQ of 132.
And now, throwing valid inter
polation into the wind, we find the
ratio of 1,250 to 1.400 is equal to
the ratio of 132 to 148. Voila, the
IQ of the average Stanford student
is 148. Isn't math fun?
So kids, please keep your super
genius status in mind as you head
off into finals.
