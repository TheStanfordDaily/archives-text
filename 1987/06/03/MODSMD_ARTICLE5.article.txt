# Groups challenge Rainbow Agenda
## 
### A.J. THOMAS Senior staff writer 
Members of campus gay. Jewish and
women's communities met Sunday with
supporters of the Rainbow Agenda to dis
cuss why the agenda has not included
those groups' concerns in its demands.
The Rainbow Agenda decided to con
tinue to address only issues of racism —
and not other forms of discrimination —
but will change its name next year to avoid
further confusion, said incoming BSU
chair Bill King.
Rainbow Agenda supporter Stacey
Leyton said members of the various
groups expressed interest in working to
gether next year to transform the People's
Platform into an ongoing organization
that will articulate the concerns of all
minority groups on campus. The People's
Platform is a coalition of campus groups
that makes endorsements for the ASSU
elections.
The two-and-a-half-hour meeting,
which observers described as tense and
heated, was suggested by members of the
gay and lesbian community at the Rain
bow Agenda's last meeting, Leyton said.
Approximately 40 people attended the
meeting held in the Old Firehouse.
Rainbow Agenda supporters justified
the decision not to include the other

minority communities on the grounds

focus of their own battle against racism.
"The kind of oppression people of color
experience at this campus is different
from the type of oppression other groups
face," Leyton said.
"To kind of throw things on the list . . .
would dilute the focus" by making the
agenda a "wish list of everyone who has
problems," King added.
King said the Rainbow Agenda "was al
ways an agenda to address racism."
He added that it is "not fair, after we've
spent months organizing, for other
groups to jump on the bandwagon."
The term "Rainbow Agenda" refers to a
document drafted by members of the four
campus ethnic organizations — the BSU,
the Asian American Student Association,
MEChA and the Stanford American In
dian Organization — that contains 10
demands regarding racial oppression on
campus. King said.
Several minority community members
said the name Rainbow Agenda caused
misunderstanding because it sounded
like the Rainbow Coalition, a broad-based
national umbrella group formed by the
Rev. Jesse Jackson.
Leyton said the Rainbow Agenda will
