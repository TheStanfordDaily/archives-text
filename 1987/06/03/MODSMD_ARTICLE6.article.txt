# Panel to review Jordan program
## 
### STEPHEN KASIERSKI Senior staff writer 
The future of the controversial Jordan
Scholars program will be decided next fall by
the University Committee on Undergraduate
Admissions and Financial Aid (CUAFA), ac
cording to Dean of Admissions Jean Fetter and
Engineering Prof. Robert Eustis. outgoing
chair of CUAFA.
CUAFA is the University committee that sets
policies on admissions and financial aid while
also monitoring admissions procedures to
make sure the policies are carried out.
Designed to attract the nation's brightest
high school students, the Jordan program has
been criticized by some students, including
the ASSU Senate, for potentially fostering an
elite sub-group within entering freshman
classes.
But Stanford officials have defended the pro
gram as a legitimate "experiment" to persuade

applicants who meet the highest academic
criteria to attend Stanford rather than the Uni
versity's historic admissions rivals. Harvard.
Yale. Princeton and MIT.
As of last week. 85 of the 200 admitted stu
dents who were designated as Jordan Scholars
had accepted Stanford's offer of admission.
Jordan scholars receive no "perks," such as
special financial awards, but will be honored at
a special reception. "Little more than a cup of
tea." Eustis said.
"I view it as an experiment to see if we can
have a student body which is more diverse in
terms of academics, Iwhile) trying to bring the
best of everything to Stanford," Eustis said.
Eustis said the lower-than-average accep
tance rate was "expected" because exception
ally well-qualified students are usually offered
admission to several top-flight universities.
"Those are the students sought by every insti
tution," he said.
But determining whether the Jordan pro

gram was truly effective in attracting those
students is "really hard to tell" because there is
no data from previous years to compare with
the current yield, Eustis said.
The Admissions Office is now re-examining
the records of the 200 top-ranked freshman
applicants over the past four years, Eustis
said. Officials will then be able to compare
yield rates from years with and without special
programs.
But Eustis said encouraging results were ob
tained from the five high school students of
fered admission who were judged to be the
most qualified under both academic and non
academic criteria. Three of the five applicants,
all accepted as Jordan Scholars, have indi
cated they will attend Stanford, he said.
The Jordan Scholars program is not the first
attempt to encourage highly qualified appli
cants to attend Stanford. A program to recruit
