Abrams admits he misled Congress
WASHINGTON — Asst. Secretary of State Elliott Abrams. the ad
ministration's controversial "point man" on Nicaragua since
1985. admitted yesterday that he had misled Congress on several
occasions, but asserted that he had been repeatedly deceived by
former White House aide Oliver North and other officials about
their secret support of the contras during a ban on U.S. military
aid.
Abrams. who repeatedly had given Congress categorical as
surances that there was no improper U.S. government involve
ment in the contras' war in Nicaragua, yesterday gave the House
and Senate investigative panels an account that was often at odds
with testimony from previous witnesses in what is now the fifth
week of the Iran-contra hearings.
Time and again Abrams demonstrated that he had — as Senate
counsel Mark Belnick put it — a "way with words." He agreed with
Belnick's assertion that his approach to testimony before congres
sional panels in the past meant that "unless the senators asked
exactly the right question, using exactly the right words, they
weren't going to get the right answer."
Nevertheless, the contentious collision between Abrams and the
investigators expected by many observers never came to pass in
the first day of his testimony. Committee sources insisted,
however, that the six hours of questioning by three committee
lawyers set the stage for members to probe more deeply today into
Abrams' past performances before Congress, and to explore
numerous contradictions that arose yesterday between his ver
sion of key events and those of other witnesses.
Tuesday's questioning also turned up the fact that Secretary of
State George Shultz was concerned enough about North's activi
ties on the staff of the National Security Council in September
1985 to direct Abrams to "monitor Ollie," whom Shultz called a
"loose cannon."
Struggle for the gulf continues
MANAMA, Bahrain — The United States and the Soviet Union
have started a high-stakes gamble for control of the Persian Gulf
region's critical oil resources, most diplomats there agree. But
there is considerable uncertainty over who the losers might be
and much confusion about who is on whose side.
"There are several possible scenarios which are all equally
gloomy." said an Arab diplomat who spoke on condition of
anonymity. "Whether the superpowers are on a collusion or a colli
sion course in the gulf, the region's states will pay the price."
The United States and the Soviet Union both say that their drive
for increased naval presence in the gulf is motivated by a commit
ment to the principle of freedom of navigation — openly violated
for more than three years by Iraq and Iran.
"The U.S. asserts that it also wants to safeguard the flow of pe
troleum to the free world," the diplomat said, "yet this flow was in
no real danger until the superpowers started muscling in, and
even the Americans admit that the 'tanker war' has had no signifi
cant impact so far on oil exports from the region."
Another diplomat, who also requested anonymity, said, "The
Americans have started modifying their argument, saying that
they had to move in because the Soviets had begun deploying war
ships in the strategic region at the invitation of some of its states.
So now we have an intractable 'egg first or hen first' situation."
Reagan goes to European summit
WASHINGTON — President Reagan leaves today for a summit
conference in Venice, Italy, of the seven major industrial
democracies, seeking to encourage greater international eco
nomic cooperation but. senior advisers say, expecting little con
crete progress toward boosting economic growth among the key
allies and stemming trade protectionism.
At the same time, he will try to win support for his efforts to
keep open the vital shipping lanes of the Persian Gulf while facing
reluctance by some allies to increase military operations in the
tense region, where the Iran-Iraq war has raged for 6 years.
Secretary of the Treasury James Baker said yesterday that steps
could be taken at the meeting to carry out common economic
policies but that no new courses are likely to be set.
"The question is not major new macroeconomic policy
measures. The question is implementation. So we will go to the
summit with the view that we have agreed upon what needs to be
done, and now what we need to see is implementation," Baker
said at a news conference.
Poll endorses U.S. gulf strategy
WASHINGTON — The American public strongly endorses Presi
dent Reagan's decision to keep a military presence in the Persian
Gulf and supports the use of force to insure an adequate supply of
Middle Eastern oil. a new Washington Post/ABC News poll indi
cates.
The five-day survey of 1.509 adults, completed Monday, shows a
far closer division on Reagan's plan — not yet implemented — to
provide American flag status and American military escorts for
Kuwaiti tankers. There is significant public apprehension that
the United States may have trouble coping with the military risks
of the region.
The poll shows a very spotty scorecard on the president's leader
ship — with large and growing doubts about his candor in the
Iran-contra affair, continued opposition to his policy in Nicaragua
but sharply higher approval of his handling of relations with the
Soviet Union.
Overall. Reagan gained a 52-47 percent approval margin — well
below his ratings before the Iran-contra affair was exposed last
November but breaking into positive ground for the first time
since January. But his credibility on all the Iran-contra questions
continues to erode as the televised congressional hearings unfold.
Two-thirds of those questioned said they think Reagan will con
tinue to have serious problems because of that controversy.
Study predicts housing shortage
WASHINGTON — The number of Americans who need low
income housing but cannot find it will grow to nearly 19 million
by the year 2003 if current trends continue, potentially swelling
the ranks of homeless living on city streets, according to a study
released yesterday.
The study, which was commissioned by the federal agency
Neighborhood Reinvestment Corp. and was conducted by Phillip
Clay of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, predicted a 27
percent decrease in available low-income housing and a 44 per
cent increase in those who need it in the next 16 years.
One official of Neighborhood Reinvestment said that the group
was shocked by the projected number of those affected. "We were
just blown away," said Dave Boehlke. of Washington, D.C., a field
representative.
Agency officials said that in addition to putting more people on
the streets, the trend would cause a huge Increase in"the hidden
homeless" — two families living in space meant for one. people
living in garages and in other unsuitable habitats.
In reaching his projection. Clay assumed that the percentage of
Americans at or below the poverty line will stay at 15 percent while
the population grows by 2 percent each year.

Clay of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, predicted a 27
percent decrease in available low-income housing and a 44 per
cent increase in those who need it in the next 16 years.
One official of Neighborhood Reinvestment said that the group
was shocked by the projected number of those affected. "We were
just blown away," said Dave Boehlke. of Washington, D.C., a field
representative.
Agency officials said that in addition to putting more people on
the streets, the trend would cause a huge Increase in"the hidden
homeless" — two families living in space meant for one. people
living in garages and in other unsuitable habitats.
In reaching his projection. Clay assumed that the percentage of
Americans at or below the poverty line will stay at 15 percent while
the population grows by 2 percent each year.

Abrams admits he misled Congress
WASHINGTON — Asst. Secretary of State Elliott Abrams. the ad
ministration's controversial "point man" on Nicaragua since
1985. admitted yesterday that he had misled Congress on several
occasions, but asserted that he had been repeatedly deceived by
former White House aide Oliver North and other officials about
their secret support of the contras during a ban on U.S. military
aid.
Abrams. who repeatedly had given Congress categorical as
surances that there was no improper U.S. government involve
ment in the contras' war in Nicaragua, yesterday gave the House
and Senate investigative panels an account that was often at odds
with testimony from previous witnesses in what is now the fifth
week of the Iran-contra hearings.
Time and again Abrams demonstrated that he had — as Senate
counsel Mark Belnick put it — a "way with words." He agreed with
Belnick's assertion that his approach to testimony before congres
sional panels in the past meant that "unless the senators asked
exactly the right question, using exactly the right words, they
weren't going to get the right answer."
Nevertheless, the contentious collision between Abrams and the
investigators expected by many observers never came to pass in
the first day of his testimony. Committee sources insisted,
however, that the six hours of questioning by three committee
lawyers set the stage for members to probe more deeply today into
Abrams' past performances before Congress, and to explore
numerous contradictions that arose yesterday between his ver
sion of key events and those of other witnesses.
Tuesday's questioning also turned up the fact that Secretary of
State George Shultz was concerned enough about North's activi
ties on the staff of the National Security Council in September
1985 to direct Abrams to "monitor Ollie," whom Shultz called a
"loose cannon."
Struggle for the gulf continues
MANAMA, Bahrain — The United States and the Soviet Union
have started a high-stakes gamble for control of the Persian Gulf
region's critical oil resources, most diplomats there agree. But
there is considerable uncertainty over who the losers might be
and much confusion about who is on whose side.
"There are several possible scenarios which are all equally
gloomy." said an Arab diplomat who spoke on condition of
anonymity. "Whether the superpowers are on a collusion or a colli
sion course in the gulf, the region's states will pay the price."
The United States and the Soviet Union both say that their drive
for increased naval presence in the gulf is motivated by a commit
ment to the principle of freedom of navigation — openly violated
for more than three years by Iraq and Iran.
"The U.S. asserts that it also wants to safeguard the flow of pe
troleum to the free world," the diplomat said, "yet this flow was in
no real danger until the superpowers started muscling in, and
even the Americans admit that the 'tanker war' has had no signifi
cant impact so far on oil exports from the region."
Another diplomat, who also requested anonymity, said, "The
Americans have started modifying their argument, saying that
they had to move in because the Soviets had begun deploying war
ships in the strategic region at the invitation of some of its states.
So now we have an intractable 'egg first or hen first' situation."
Reagan goes to European summit
WASHINGTON — President Reagan leaves today for a summit
conference in Venice, Italy, of the seven major industrial
democracies, seeking to encourage greater international eco
nomic cooperation but. senior advisers say, expecting little con
crete progress toward boosting economic growth among the key
allies and stemming trade protectionism.
At the same time, he will try to win support for his efforts to
keep open the vital shipping lanes of the Persian Gulf while facing
reluctance by some allies to increase military operations in the
tense region, where the Iran-Iraq war has raged for 6 years.
Secretary of the Treasury James Baker said yesterday that steps
could be taken at the meeting to carry out common economic
policies but that no new courses are likely to be set.
"The question is not major new macroeconomic policy
measures. The question is implementation. So we will go to the
summit with the view that we have agreed upon what needs to be
done, and now what we need to see is implementation," Baker
said at a news conference.
Poll endorses U.S. gulf strategy
WASHINGTON — The American public strongly endorses Presi
dent Reagan's decision to keep a military presence in the Persian
Gulf and supports the use of force to insure an adequate supply of
Middle Eastern oil. a new Washington Post/ABC News poll indi
cates.
The five-day survey of 1.509 adults, completed Monday, shows a
far closer division on Reagan's plan — not yet implemented — to
provide American flag status and American military escorts for
Kuwaiti tankers. There is significant public apprehension that
the United States may have trouble coping with the military risks
of the region.
The poll shows a very spotty scorecard on the president's leader
ship — with large and growing doubts about his candor in the
Iran-contra affair, continued opposition to his policy in Nicaragua
but sharply higher approval of his handling of relations with the
Soviet Union.
Overall. Reagan gained a 52-47 percent approval margin — well
below his ratings before the Iran-contra affair was exposed last
November but breaking into positive ground for the first time
since January. But his credibility on all the Iran-contra questions
continues to erode as the televised congressional hearings unfold.
Two-thirds of those questioned said they think Reagan will con
tinue to have serious problems because of that controversy.
Study predicts housing shortage
WASHINGTON — The number of Americans who need low
income housing but cannot find it will grow to nearly 19 million
by the year 2003 if current trends continue, potentially swelling
the ranks of homeless living on city streets, according to a study
released yesterday.
The study, which was commissioned by the federal agency
Neighborhood Reinvestment Corp. and was conducted by Phillip
Clay of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, predicted a 27
percent decrease in available low-income housing and a 44 per
