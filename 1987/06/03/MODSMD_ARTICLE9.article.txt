# Volcker resigns top post at Fed
## 
### 
WASHINGTON â€” Paul Volcker disclosed yes
terday that he would step down as chairman of
the Federal Reserve Board and President
Reagan announced that he would nominate
conservative economist Alan Greenspan to fill
the powerful position at the head of the na
tion's central bank.
Volcker, who led the battle against inflation
during his eight years as Fed chairman and
had assumed almost-mythical status in some
financial circles, said he was leaving volun
tarily.
"There's a time to come and a time to leave,"
Volcker declared at a hastily convened White
House news conference. "1 had no feeling I was
being pushed."
News of the departure of Volcker, often called
the second most powerful man in America be
cause of his influence on the nation's eco
nomic health, sent a shock wave through the
international financial community.
Reagan, in making the surprise announce
ment after White House officials had dropped
hints that they hoped Volcker, 59, would stay,
said he accepted Volcker's decision "with great
reluctance and regret."
And Secretary of Treasury James Baker, who
has met with Volcker frequently in recent
years, disclosed that he had tried to persuade
the Fed chairman to accept a third four-year
term at the helm of the nation's financial sys
tem.
But some analysts speculated that recent

statements by administration officials were
ambiguous and fell short of offering Volcker
the personal assurances of support that could
have persuaded him to change his mind.
Greenspan, a Wall Street economist who
served as chief economic adviser to Presidents
Nixon and Ford, frequently said he supported
Volcker's reappointment but he also had been
quietly lobbying for months to be selected for
the position if Volcker left. He was approached
earlier by administration officials about taking
the job and when Reagan offered it to him
Monday afternoon, Greenspan said, it took
him only "milliseconds" to agree.
Although several others were considered as
possible replacements, including Fed vice
chairman Manuel Johnson and current White
House chief economic adviser Beryl Sprinkel,
Greenspan was the only serious candidate to
succeed Volcker, sources said.
"Filling Paul Volcker's shoes will be a major
challenge," Greenspan said, adding that
Volcker has "served as the model of the ideal
chairman of the Federal Reserve. If the Senate
confirms me, I intend to follow that model."
The Fed, a quasi-Independent government
agency responsible for managing the nation's
money supply and with wide influence over in
terest rates, has taken on an increasingly im
portant role in recent years of defending the
dollar's value in currency markets and coping
with the crisis among debt-plagued Latin
American nations.

Speculation was rife over the possible effects
of Volcker's replacement by Greenspan. Most
economists argued that he was likely to adopt
a tough anti-Inflation stance, perhaps
demonstrating his willingness to raise interest
rates even at the expense of slower economic
growth. But some Democrats worried that the
conservative economist would be more willing
to tolerate higher prices in order to maintain
economic growth through the election next
year. Volcker. who was appointed by President
Carter in 1979 in the midst of an inflationary
spiral and reappointed by Reagan in 1983
largely to reassure financial markets that a
vigilant anti-inflationary policy would remain
in place, was tne target of intense political at
tacks during the recession of the early 1980s.
Under Volcker, the Fed squeezed hard
enough on the growth of the money supply to
push interest rates to record levels in 1981,
driving down inflation much faster than ex
pected but at the price of the nation's worst
economic downturn and highest unemploy
ment since the Great Depression.
But Volcker weathered the storm of
criticism, emerging as one of the most
respected government officials of recent years
for his willingness to fight inflation despite the
pressures to relent and his ability to stabilize
the economy at a time of record federal budget
deficits, financial turmoil that threatened the
banking system and unprecedented changes
in global capital flows. Los Angeles Times
