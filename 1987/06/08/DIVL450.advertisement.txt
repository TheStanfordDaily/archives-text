NOW A BIG ENGINEER!
WE LOVE YOU, BETSY
from Piedmont;
Nan-Pan with great elan,
Loved to write half the night,
Got good marks, ran in parks,
By bike was thrown for man unknown,
Loved Kathmandu and Tibetan too,
To Europe went with best intent
To Muse attend with good friend.
From desire to learn she will never turn.
We're very proud, tell the crowd,
of our Nan-Pan. Love the Clan
from Toronto, Canada
CONGRATULATIONS
KIMMIE ROEN
WITH LOVE AND PRIDE!
You've made all our wishes, hopes,
and dreams come true!
