Cal Fed's Tiered Checking.
The higher your balance,
the higher your interest rate
Tiered Checking has four levels. At each higher
level, your entire balance automatically earns a
higher rate. Here's how it works:
Deposit levels:
Tierl $0-$l,OOO
Tier 2 $1,000-55,000
Tier 3 $5,000-$lO,OOO
Tier 4 $10,(XX) or more
With Tiered Checking, you get unlimited
checkwriting with no per-check charges, and your
interest is compounded daily. And just $1,000 opens
your account.
