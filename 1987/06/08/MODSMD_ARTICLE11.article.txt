# Plaque will guard Class of '87 memories
## 
### DAVID LIPPEATT Editorial staff 
There are 95 of them arranged
corner to corner in a row stretch
ing along the walk under the
arcade of the Inner Quad. The
bright, shiny bronze plaques,
each bearing a number, begin in
front of Memorial Church and ex
tend east, roughly in the direction
of Hoover Tower. Generations of
students have walked or ridden
bikes over them and have won
dered what lies In the time
capsules burled beneath each
plaque.

Soon a new plaque will Join the
others at the end of the row. Sat
urday morning at about 10:30,
after the senior Baccalaureate, the
96th Senior Class Plaque will be
dedicated and put Into place over
a new time capsule at a ceremony
led by University Provost James
Rosse and the four Senior Class
Presidents — B.G. Porter. Monica
Lyttle, Mary Obana and Novlan
Whltsltt.
The time capsule will be filled
with Items "representative of the
Class of 1987 and of our four years
at Stanford," said Porter. The con
tents of the capsule "in a sense

summarize the major Issues and
events" that relate to this year's
graduating class.
"The contents were chosen to
reflect current campus Issues, na
tional issues and trends." Porter
explained. "For example, we're In
cluding a copy of the Tower Com
mission Report, a Stanford
baseball cap and an AIDS aware
ness flier."
The four presidents will meet
with Bill Cleveland of University
Events and Services to seal these
items, and the other 30 or so to be
Included in the time capsule. Into
the 15-inch square by 5-lnch deep

stainless steel box Friday at 3:00
p.m.
The next day the sealed box will
be placed In a square concrete
cavity, at which point seniors in
attendance will be Invited to cast
into the pit student IDs. meal
cards, mementoes or "whatever
debris they want," according to
Porter.
The cavity will then be sealed
and the 1987 plaque placed over
it, he said.
Contrary to popular belief, time
capsules are not to be opened in
-100 years, but if and when each
class decides to open theirs, ac
cording to Bob Hamrdla, assistant
to the president.
The class of '82 has already
decided it will open its time
capsule at its 50 year reunion.
Hamrdla said.
The tradition of laying down a
senior class plaque in the Quad
dates back to 1896, when the idea
was first proposed to then-
University president David Starr
Jordan by Class of '96 member
Myron A. Folsom.
The 1896 plaque was laid in
place of the concrete block directly
in front of Memorial Church, with
the idea that succeeding class
plaques would stretch out In a row
which would eventually wind all of
the way around the inner quad,
representing a period of more
than 500 years of classes.
The tradition continued, and in
1903 the Class of '95 added a
plaque ahead of (but set off-center
from) the '96 plaque. The Class of
'92 laid a plaque of Its own as part
of Commencement activities in
1917. The two-block gap between
'92 and '95 was filled by the
classes of '93 and '94 in a
combined ceremony on Alumni

Day In 1919.
Although It Is not known when
an official time capsule was first
added under the senior plaque,
workers who removed the '92-'94
plaques in 1981 during construc
tion on Memorial Church found
sealed tubes under each one. The
'92 tube contained a parchment
signed by members of that senior
class; the '93 and '94 tubes were
left unopened.
By the 1940s the sealing of the
time capsule was an important
tradition. Under the Class of '45
plaque went the class history, the
class will, the Senior Scroll and
copies of the Chapparal and The
Daily among other things.
Over the next few decades items
burled in the time capsules began
to reflect different concerns. In
stead of consisting primarily of
class records, by 1977 the list read
as follows: tennis shorts,
wedgeheeled shoes. black
armbands and United Farm
Worker Union emblems, photos of
streakers and tuition checks.
As then-Senior Class President
Jamie Grodsky explained it.
"we're (also) putting in some
things we think might be obsolete
in the future — like a vial of water,
some fossil fuel, some saccharine
and the pill."
Ten years later the list is just as
varied. The senior class presi
dents "tried to gather things that
would relate not just to our experi

ence at Stanford over the last four
years" but to national and world
events during that period, said
Obana.
"I was especially Interested In
Including things like clothing —
Jams shorts, for example — that
people who open the time capsule
years from now would wonder
about." she said. "And we all
wanted to include things of politi
cal importance."
Among the other items that will
go into this year's time capsule: a
"Women of Stanford" calendar, a
"You Can Make a Difference" con
ference button, a Cornerstone
Centennial ceremony program, a
class T-shirt, condoms, albums by
U2 and Bruce Springsteen, a 1983
Froshbook, a Slate of Shock
(Obana's slate) flyer, a bottle of
Corona beer, a Trivial Pursuit
game, a Mendicants cassette tape
and a copy of the Newsweek issue
with Jim and Tammy Faye Bakker
on the cover.
"It's tentative at this point, but
we're also going to try to Include
clothing owned by John Paye,
Pablo Morales and Patty Fendick
and a copy of Atul Gawande's
Rhodes Scholarship announce
ment," Porter said.
According to Porter, this list
had been compiled by the senior
class presidents mainly over the
past two weeks, although they
have been considering various
items all year.

time capsule, thus insuring herself a place in Stanford history.
There are 95 of them arranged
corner to corner in a row stretch
ing along the walk under the
arcade of the Inner Quad. The
bright, shiny bronze plaques,
each bearing a number, begin in
front of Memorial Church and ex
tend east, roughly in the direction
of Hoover Tower. Generations of
students have walked or ridden
bikes over them and have won
dered what lies In the time
capsules burled beneath each
plaque.

Soon a new plaque will Join the
others at the end of the row. Sat
urday morning at about 10:30,
after the senior Baccalaureate, the
96th Senior Class Plaque will be
dedicated and put Into place over
a new time capsule at a ceremony
led by University Provost James
Rosse and the four Senior Class
Presidents — B.G. Porter. Monica
Lyttle, Mary Obana and Novlan
Whltsltt.
The time capsule will be filled
with Items "representative of the
Class of 1987 and of our four years
at Stanford," said Porter. The con
tents of the capsule "in a sense

summarize the major Issues and
events" that relate to this year's
graduating class.
"The contents were chosen to
reflect current campus Issues, na
tional issues and trends." Porter
explained. "For example, we're In
cluding a copy of the Tower Com
mission Report, a Stanford
baseball cap and an AIDS aware
ness flier."
The four presidents will meet
with Bill Cleveland of University
Events and Services to seal these
items, and the other 30 or so to be
Included in the time capsule. Into
the 15-inch square by 5-lnch deep

stainless steel box Friday at 3:00
p.m.
The next day the sealed box will
be placed In a square concrete
cavity, at which point seniors in
attendance will be Invited to cast
into the pit student IDs. meal
cards, mementoes or "whatever
debris they want," according to
Porter.
The cavity will then be sealed
and the 1987 plaque placed over
it, he said.
Contrary to popular belief, time
capsules are not to be opened in
-100 years, but if and when each
class decides to open theirs, ac
cording to Bob Hamrdla, assistant
to the president.
The class of '82 has already
decided it will open its time
capsule at its 50 year reunion.
Hamrdla said.
The tradition of laying down a
senior class plaque in the Quad
dates back to 1896, when the idea
was first proposed to then-
University president David Starr
Jordan by Class of '96 member
Myron A. Folsom.
The 1896 plaque was laid in
place of the concrete block directly
in front of Memorial Church, with
the idea that succeeding class
plaques would stretch out In a row
which would eventually wind all of
the way around the inner quad,
representing a period of more
than 500 years of classes.
The tradition continued, and in
1903 the Class of '95 added a
plaque ahead of (but set off-center
from) the '96 plaque. The Class of
'92 laid a plaque of Its own as part
of Commencement activities in
1917. The two-block gap between
'92 and '95 was filled by the
classes of '93 and '94 in a
combined ceremony on Alumni

Day In 1919.
Although It Is not known when
an official time capsule was first
added under the senior plaque,
workers who removed the '92-'94
plaques in 1981 during construc
tion on Memorial Church found
sealed tubes under each one. The
'92 tube contained a parchment
signed by members of that senior
class; the '93 and '94 tubes were
left unopened.
By the 1940s the sealing of the
time capsule was an important
tradition. Under the Class of '45
plaque went the class history, the
class will, the Senior Scroll and
copies of the Chapparal and The
Daily among other things.
Over the next few decades items
burled in the time capsules began
to reflect different concerns. In
stead of consisting primarily of
class records, by 1977 the list read
as follows: tennis shorts,
wedgeheeled shoes. black
armbands and United Farm
Worker Union emblems, photos of
streakers and tuition checks.
As then-Senior Class President
Jamie Grodsky explained it.
"we're (also) putting in some
things we think might be obsolete
in the future — like a vial of water,
some fossil fuel, some saccharine
and the pill."
Ten years later the list is just as
varied. The senior class presi
dents "tried to gather things that
would relate not just to our experi

ence at Stanford over the last four
years" but to national and world
events during that period, said
Obana.
"I was especially Interested In
Including things like clothing —
Jams shorts, for example — that
people who open the time capsule
years from now would wonder
about." she said. "And we all
wanted to include things of politi
cal importance."
Among the other items that will
go into this year's time capsule: a
"Women of Stanford" calendar, a
"You Can Make a Difference" con
ference button, a Cornerstone
Centennial ceremony program, a
class T-shirt, condoms, albums by
U2 and Bruce Springsteen, a 1983
Froshbook, a Slate of Shock
(Obana's slate) flyer, a bottle of
Corona beer, a Trivial Pursuit
game, a Mendicants cassette tape
and a copy of the Newsweek issue
with Jim and Tammy Faye Bakker
on the cover.
"It's tentative at this point, but
we're also going to try to Include
clothing owned by John Paye,
Pablo Morales and Patty Fendick
and a copy of Atul Gawande's
Rhodes Scholarship announce
ment," Porter said.
According to Porter, this list
had been compiled by the senior
class presidents mainly over the
past two weeks, although they
have been considering various
items all year.
