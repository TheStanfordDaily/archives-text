# A 						senior's reflections upon graduating
## 
### 
I'm a high-minded woman, 22 years old.
about to receive my college diploma from Stan
ford. I want everything â€” a career, a marriage
and kids. Is the world ready for me?
I'm not sure that it is.
Most men still want their wives to stay at
home to raise the children.
Studies show that in many cases sending
children to day-care facilities Isn't in their best
interest.

America is far behind many European
countries in offering maternal leave with pay,
and most companies look down on a man for
taking paternal leave.
Things are different than they were two
decades ago. But my mother nurtured me, and
I'd like to take time off to care for my children
when they're very young without giving up my
career.
I hope my husband will be willing to take as
much time off as I will to care for our children.
Ideally. I guess. I hope I'll be among the small
number of women who can afford a nanny.
Women have shown they can compete in a
male-dominated work force. I want to be a part

of that, but the battle for women Is still uphill.
Statistics show that Inequities of pay and
status between men and women persist. On
the average, a woman today earns about 62
cents for every dollar earned by a man.
In the 1984 Presidential campaign, every
democratic candidate backed comparable
worth as a cure. But somehow comparable
worth seems an Impractical but well-Intended
method of rectifying the Inequality of the
sexes.
It's still extremely rare for a woman to reach
the top echelons of an elite corporation: Of the
Fortune 500 companies, 499 are headed by
men. And The Washington Post, the sole
matriarchy, was handed to Katharine Graham
through her family.
Graham may not find much female company
in the near future, but at least the courts are fi
nally embracing more affirmative action
policies.
Since it first addressed the issue 16 years
ago, the Supreme Court has handed down
mixed decisions on sex discrimination cases.
Last term, the Court decided that a woman
with only slightly lower test scores can be
promoted over a man. even If she was not a
prior victim of discrimination. But the justices
have been awfully slow with such progress.

At Stanford we have our own problems of In
equality, harassment and sexism.
Thirty of the 36 professors and lecturers
whose classes I took In the past four years are
male. Women are even more scarce at the high
est levels of the University Administration.
Statistics don't show the subtle forms of so
cial injustice that women face.
At Stanford, women balk at cat calls from
dorm windows, jeers at fraternity parties and
even pin-up calendars in male friends' dorm
rooms.
But overall, the atmosphere on campus is a
comfortable one, certainly less sexist than the
outside world.
At final exams here, men and women sit as
equals. Students of the fairer sex generally
nurture aspirations as high as their male
counterparts.
For the past four years Stanford has served
as a haven of sorts from much of the social in
justice of our society.
I'll miss it here.
A friend asked me recently what I thought of
my prospects for success, balancing career and
family, making it in a male-dominated world.
The answer is simple: I'm neither optimistic
nor pessimistic. I'm determined.
