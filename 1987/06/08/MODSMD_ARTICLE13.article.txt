# Seniors to dedicate gift at ceremonies
## 
### STEPHEN KASIERSKI Senior staff writer 
Soapbox oratory may well be a
thing of the past here.
Thanks to the graduating Class
of 1987, a new speakers platform
has joined the Claw and T-shirt
vendors as permanent fixtures in
White Plaza — the traditional site
for University protests and rallies.
The low concrete structure
topped by a steel gazebo frame will
be used for rallies, speakers and
student performances, according
to B.C. Porter, one of the senior
class presidents.
University President Donald
Kennedy joined graduating
seniors at an Informal ribbon
cutting ceremony for the gift
Thursday night. A reception fol
lowed at Tresidder Union.
The gift will be formally pre
sented to the University at a cere
mony during Senior Class Day fes
tivities Saturday at Bowman
Grove.
The cost of the structure has
already totaled •17,000, but
generous support from the ASSU
and alumni made the project pos
sible. It is "much more than a
senior class gift," Porter said.
According to Senior Class Co-
President Mary Obana, senior
class gifts typically cost between
• 1,000 and *2,000, but this year's
class was determined to complete
the project despite the potentially
hefty price tag.
"We started out on a much
smaller scale than we're finishing
with," said Porter.
According to Porter, the idea for
the podium was mentioned to the
class presidents last year by a
recent graduate. The project
quickly gained the favor of the offi
cers, who discussed the concept
with Kennedy at an October
meeting.
But Obana added that the presi
dents discussed the proposal

rather quietly so that students
would not be disappointed If the
Idea was dropped due to Its ex
cessive cost.
Despite the scale of the task, the
presidents "went with this Idea
from the beginning," Porter said.
The presidents were hoping for
something more than a simple
platform. The class wanted a
design that would be versatile as
well as attractive, Porter said.
At the suggestion of Alumni As
sociation Director William Stone,
the class presidents turned to Rod
Freebalrn-Smith, a San Francisco
architect and Stanford graduate
who helped design and renovate
Bowman Alumni House. Porter
called Freebalrn-Smlth, who
donated his services as architect
and project manager, the "key fig
ure" behind the entire project.
The flexibility of the final design
enables the platform to have a
"considerably broader use" than a
simple podium, Freebalrn-Smith
said. "1 hope it will become kind of
a mini-outdoor theater," he
added.
The platform was purposely
placed in a "relatively quiet" loca
tion away from the White Plaza
traffic pattern, he said. The metal
skeleton surrounds an 18-foot
stage, and curtains can be hung
from the high standards to trans
form the structure into a small
proscenium theater.
The iron frame also gives the
platform the shape of a small
pavilion and can serve as a cover.
The stairs leading up to the plat
form can function as risers for
musical groups, and the gazebo
legs are also designed to support
speakers.
The gift was given final approval
in mid-May when the class learned
that several large contributions
from interested alumni would
defray much of the cost of the plat
form.

Workers hustle to put together the senior class gift The gift, a plat
form with an elaborate metal covering, will be a versatile stage for
speakers and performers alike.
Porter said the class presidents
worked closely with Henry Rlggs,
University vice-president for devel
opment. to find potential donors.
The class also received cost
reductions from several compan
ies involved in the construction
process, including Ben Pressman
General Contractors, Pacific Steel
and San Mateo Ornamental Iron.
Project planners also had to con
tend with the University's vaunted
administrative structure for ap
provals from a wide variety of
planning agencies.
Yet Freebalrn-Smlth had noth
ing but praise for Stanford offi
cials, who were "astonishingly
cooperative," he said.
Some of the University depart
ments involved in the process
were Student Organizational
Services, University Events and
Services, Tresidder Union, the
University Commltte on Land and
Building Development and the
University Planning office. Final
approval was given by Kennedy
and the Administrative Council.
