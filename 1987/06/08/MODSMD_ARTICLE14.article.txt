# Baseball: Images to remember
## 
### CHRIS MYERS Editorial staff 
It was an extraordinary year for the Stanford
baseball team. The Cardinal nine stumbled to
a disheartening 11-8 start, then won 11 in a
row, rampaged through the Pacific 10 South
ern Division, went unbeaten in a tough West I
Regional at Sunken Diamond and then
bounced back from the brink of elimination to
beat nemesis Oklahoma State and win the Col
lege World Series for the first time in school
history.
What fans at Sunken Diamond and in
Omaha at Rosenblatt Stadium saw in Stanford
was a team that lived one of sport's most
popular cliches: they did what they had to do
to win.
In the regionals, when the starting pitching
faltered a bit, Stanford's hitting came alive and
more than made up for any pitching woes.
In the World Series, when the hitting cooled
off, the pitching staff kept the Cardinal in con
tention. In a tournament laden with pitching
talent, the Stanford pitchers proved them
selves the deepest and most talented staff in
the country.
"The pitching was just awesome," freshman
rightfielder Paul Carey said. "The pitching was
it for us."
Perhaps the most crucial pitching perfor
mances of the Series, and ones that are easily
overlooked in the wake of subsequent events,
came from sophomore Brian Keyser and senior
Rob Wassenaar, who teamed up Friday to shut
down LSU long enough to get the game into ex
tra innings.
That is, long enough to set the stage for Paul
Carey's already legendary grand slam in the
bottom of the tenth inning. Enough has
already been written and spoken about "the
Hit," but suffice it to say that Carey's mighty
blow was the turning point of the Series for the
Cardinal, igniting Stanford's offense and pro
viding enough momentum to carry the team
through Sunday's championship game.
"After that LSU thing, they caught fire," said
Oklahoma State star Robin Ventura. "You just
don't see many teams with grand slams in the
bottom of the 10th, especially in the World Se
ries. One of those things will get you going,
and that's what that did."
It was, to be sure, a remarkable Series for
Stanford — and every regular contributed at
least one shining moment to the Cardinal's
drive to the crown. Several performances stand
out in the memory — images etched on the
mind's eye for all time, to be treasured with the
championship trophy:
□Junior Lee Plemel confounding Texas with a

grab-bag of breaking balls, keeping the
Longhorns off balance the entire way in a com
plete game 12-hit performance in the Card
inal's second game.
□ Senior center fielder Toi Cook stealing
second and third on consecutive pitches
against Texas starter Curt Krippner, then
coming home on the very next pitch, a wild
pitch by the obviously rattled Longhorn ace.
□Senior rightfielder Ruben Amaro breaking
for home against Krippner, only to be awarded
the run automatically when the right-hander
balked. "He had the base stolen," Krippner
said afterward. .

□ Senior designated hitter Mark Machtolf,
after resting on the bench much of the season
as the sometimes platoon DH against
lefthanders, starting the LSU game against a
righty and lining a triple down the right field
line in his first at-bat. Machtolf went on to bat
.429 for the Series and land a spot on the All-
Tournament Team.
□Amaro, again, battling LSU fireballer Barry
Manuel with one out in the bottom of the
tenth. Amaro went down 1-2 on the count,
fouled off several pitches and finally drew a
walk that got the game-winning rally started.
□Senior lefty A 1 Osuna coming on In relief of
Lee Plemel in the middle of a disastrous first
Inning Saturday against Texas and shutting
out the Longhorns for eight and two-thirds in
nings. The high point of the performance came
in the sixth, when Osuna struck out the side,
retiring each batter on a big curveball.
□Sophomore slugger Ed Sprague ripping his
first and only home run of the Series In the
bottom of the first in the second game against
Texas. Down 3-0 after the top of the first, the
Cardinal desperately needed to get something
started soon against Krippner. Sprague's
homer did just that, Immediately putting
Stanford back in the game.
□Cook, again, this time breaking out of a

series-long batting slump with a big double to
the centerfield wall off Krippner. He stroked an
almost identical shot the next night against
Oklahoma State, but this time it was good for a
triple. Cook also wowed folks in the Oklahoma
State game with a diving catch of Adam
Smith's sinking liner in shallow left-center in
the sixth.
□Junior catcher Doug Robbins hustling down
the line to beat out a double play ball and keep
the Cardinal's big fourth-inning rally against
Texas on Saturday alive.
□Sophomore second baseman Frank Carey
coming up one batter after Robbins and break
ing out of a slump of his own with a sharp
triple into the rightfield corner.
□Paul Carey hitting an apparent single Into
the left-center gap against Oklahoma State
and hustling the hit into a double.
□Sophomore first baseman Ron Witmeyer
turning the difficult 3-6-3 double play against
Texas Saturday and then again against Okla
homa State the next night. Witmeyer was the
best defensive first baseman in the tourna
ment and batted .409, but he was over
shadowed by Oklahoma State first baseman
Jimmy Barragan, who earned a spot on the All-
Tournament Team with a .500 batting
average. Witmeyer, however, had four RBIs to
Barragan's two, which says something about
the relative importance of their batting
averages.
□Senior shortstop David Esquer laying down
a perfect bunt in the fifth innning against
Oklahoma State and arriving at first base with
a headfirst dive and a cloud of dust. Esquer hit
.350 for the Series with six RBIs and two
game-winning RBIs, earning a spot on the All-
Tournament Team.
□Junior Jack McDowell, playing his last game
for the Cardinal before he goes pro this sum
mer, pitching seven grueling innings against
the fearsome Oklahoma State batting order in
the championship game before finally going In
to fatigue in the eighth. "I was dead," he said.
"I didn't have real good stuff all night. I was
just trying to gut it out."
□Sophomore Steve Chitren coming on in relief
of McDowell In the eighth with a 6-4 lead, men
on first and second and no outs, and striking
out the side. "When Steve comes in and strikes
out three guys, that's it right there," McDowell
said. "That's the game."
□ Cardinal Coach Mark Marquess tightly
clutching the NCAA championship trophy he
worked for years to win. Twenty years before,
in 1967, Marquess had led Stanford to a third
place finish in the CWS as an All-America first
baseman. The championship trophy had been
his Holy Grail since then.


And he's safe. Stanford designated hitter Mark Machtolf just manages
to dive back to first base before being tagged out The Card went on to

Lisa Romerein/Dally
win this game against Louisiana State University and, eventually, the
NCAA college championship.

line in his first at-bat. Machtolf went on to bat
.429 for the Series and land a spot on the All-
Tournament Team.
□Amaro, again, battling LSU fireballer Barry
Manuel with one out in the bottom of the
tenth. Amaro went down 1-2 on the count,
fouled off several pitches and finally drew a
walk that got the game-winning rally started.
□Senior lefty A 1 Osuna coming on In relief of
Lee Plemel in the middle of a disastrous first
Inning Saturday against Texas and shutting
out the Longhorns for eight and two-thirds in
nings. The high point of the performance came
in the sixth, when Osuna struck out the side,
retiring each batter on a big curveball.
□Sophomore slugger Ed Sprague ripping his
first and only home run of the Series In the
bottom of the first in the second game against
Texas. Down 3-0 after the top of the first, the
Cardinal desperately needed to get something
started soon against Krippner. Sprague's
homer did just that, Immediately putting
Stanford back in the game.
□Cook, again, this time breaking out of a

series-long batting slump with a big double to
the centerfield wall off Krippner. He stroked an
almost identical shot the next night against
Oklahoma State, but this time it was good for a
triple. Cook also wowed folks in the Oklahoma
State game with a diving catch of Adam
Smith's sinking liner in shallow left-center in
the sixth.
□Junior catcher Doug Robbins hustling down
the line to beat out a double play ball and keep
the Cardinal's big fourth-inning rally against
Texas on Saturday alive.
□Sophomore second baseman Frank Carey
coming up one batter after Robbins and break
ing out of a slump of his own with a sharp
triple into the rightfield corner.
□Paul Carey hitting an apparent single Into
the left-center gap against Oklahoma State
and hustling the hit into a double.
□Sophomore first baseman Ron Witmeyer
turning the difficult 3-6-3 double play against
Texas Saturday and then again against Okla
homa State the next night. Witmeyer was the
best defensive first baseman in the tourna
ment and batted .409, but he was over
shadowed by Oklahoma State first baseman
Jimmy Barragan, who earned a spot on the All-
Tournament Team with a .500 batting
average. Witmeyer, however, had four RBIs to
Barragan's two, which says something about
the relative importance of their batting
averages.
□Senior shortstop David Esquer laying down
a perfect bunt in the fifth innning against
Oklahoma State and arriving at first base with
a headfirst dive and a cloud of dust. Esquer hit
.350 for the Series with six RBIs and two
game-winning RBIs, earning a spot on the All-
Tournament Team.
□Junior Jack McDowell, playing his last game
for the Cardinal before he goes pro this sum
mer, pitching seven grueling innings against
the fearsome Oklahoma State batting order in
the championship game before finally going In
to fatigue in the eighth. "I was dead," he said.
"I didn't have real good stuff all night. I was
just trying to gut it out."
□Sophomore Steve Chitren coming on in relief
of McDowell In the eighth with a 6-4 lead, men
on first and second and no outs, and striking
out the side. "When Steve comes in and strikes
out three guys, that's it right there," McDowell
said. "That's the game."
□ Cardinal Coach Mark Marquess tightly
clutching the NCAA championship trophy he
worked for years to win. Twenty years before,
in 1967, Marquess had led Stanford to a third
place finish in the CWS as an All-America first
baseman. The championship trophy had been
his Holy Grail since then.


And he's safe. Stanford designated hitter Mark Machtolf just manages
to dive back to first base before being tagged out The Card went on to

Lisa Romerein/Dally
win this game against Louisiana State University and, eventually, the
NCAA college championship.

It was an extraordinary year for the Stanford
baseball team. The Cardinal nine stumbled to
a disheartening 11-8 start, then won 11 in a
row, rampaged through the Pacific 10 South
ern Division, went unbeaten in a tough West I
Regional at Sunken Diamond and then
bounced back from the brink of elimination to
beat nemesis Oklahoma State and win the Col
lege World Series for the first time in school
history.
What fans at Sunken Diamond and in
Omaha at Rosenblatt Stadium saw in Stanford
was a team that lived one of sport's most
popular cliches: they did what they had to do
to win.
In the regionals, when the starting pitching
faltered a bit, Stanford's hitting came alive and
more than made up for any pitching woes.
In the World Series, when the hitting cooled
off, the pitching staff kept the Cardinal in con
tention. In a tournament laden with pitching
talent, the Stanford pitchers proved them
selves the deepest and most talented staff in
the country.
"The pitching was just awesome," freshman
rightfielder Paul Carey said. "The pitching was
it for us."
Perhaps the most crucial pitching perfor
mances of the Series, and ones that are easily
overlooked in the wake of subsequent events,
came from sophomore Brian Keyser and senior
Rob Wassenaar, who teamed up Friday to shut
down LSU long enough to get the game into ex
tra innings.
That is, long enough to set the stage for Paul
Carey's already legendary grand slam in the
bottom of the tenth inning. Enough has
already been written and spoken about "the
Hit," but suffice it to say that Carey's mighty
blow was the turning point of the Series for the
Cardinal, igniting Stanford's offense and pro
viding enough momentum to carry the team
through Sunday's championship game.
"After that LSU thing, they caught fire," said
Oklahoma State star Robin Ventura. "You just
don't see many teams with grand slams in the
bottom of the 10th, especially in the World Se
ries. One of those things will get you going,
and that's what that did."
It was, to be sure, a remarkable Series for
Stanford — and every regular contributed at
least one shining moment to the Cardinal's
drive to the crown. Several performances stand
out in the memory — images etched on the
mind's eye for all time, to be treasured with the
championship trophy:
□Junior Lee Plemel confounding Texas with a

grab-bag of breaking balls, keeping the
Longhorns off balance the entire way in a com
plete game 12-hit performance in the Card
inal's second game.
□ Senior center fielder Toi Cook stealing
second and third on consecutive pitches
against Texas starter Curt Krippner, then
coming home on the very next pitch, a wild
pitch by the obviously rattled Longhorn ace.
□Senior rightfielder Ruben Amaro breaking
for home against Krippner, only to be awarded
the run automatically when the right-hander
balked. "He had the base stolen," Krippner
said afterward. .

□ Senior designated hitter Mark Machtolf,
after resting on the bench much of the season
as the sometimes platoon DH against
lefthanders, starting the LSU game against a
righty and lining a triple down the right field
line in his first at-bat. Machtolf went on to bat
.429 for the Series and land a spot on the All-
Tournament Team.
