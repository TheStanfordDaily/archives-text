# 'A guide to good restaurants near the Farm
## 
### 
»• Morning eaters are lucky here —
f4tlo Alto and Menlo Park have a
plethora of good restaurants that
Specialize In breakfast and lunch.
•, First among equals Is Late for
fye Train (150 Mlddlefleld Rd..
Menlo Park, near the train sta
tion), a folksy place that makes
great omelettes, divine blitzes and
fruit pancakes and the usual
£alads and sandwiches, plus ever
ejianging desserts. If you go on a
ieeekend, particularly a Sunday,
picpect at least a 45-minute wait;
ifs best, if you can, to go for an
early or late weekday lunch, when
you can often be seated Immedi
ately.
Modeled along much the same
lines is Hobee's (two locations in
Palo Alto: 4224 El Cmalno Real
and Town and Country Village,
jpJcross from the Stadium), a family
operation with more branches
around the peninsula. Hobee's fol
lows more traditional American
breakfast lines — sausage, eggs,
ham — but isn't lacking for fresh
squeezed juices, fruit and other
California trimmings, and it has a
tjuly addictive coffee-cake that
tomes with most of the break
fasts. Both Hobee's and Late for
the Train provide free coffee for
•Waiting crowds.
The Farmer's Market (448 Cali
fornia Ave., Palo Alto) has a small
pienu, spotty service (semi-
Icafeteria style) and the ambiance
'of a butcher shop, but it serves
•great breakfasts (try the apple
'pancakes or a ham/swiss/apple
'omelette) at relatively low prices.
> Finally, there's the favorite
meeting spot of Stanford
— Dinah's Poolside Cof
fee Shop (4269 El Camino, Palo
lAlto, not to be confused with
'JDinah's Shack, a mediocre res
taurant next door), which has
omelettes.

* Where the Cardinal flocks
• r
' Stanford hangouts change from
♦year to year, of course, but there
'are such things as old standards.
J Half the people in Ramona's
♦(541 Ramona St., Palo Alto) on
.any given weekend night will be
'from Stanford; the crush is partic
ularly intense before and after
games. Most of them
be eating the second-best

pizza in the area, while those who
want to be different chew on
calzones or decent hamburgers.
The once-great Ramona's salad
bar retains only a shade of its
former glory.
Down the street at the Good
Earth Restaurant (185 University
Ave., Palo Alto), you'll find a differ
ent. slightly older Stanford crowd
eating chic health food. The iced
tea at this time of year is particu
larly refreshing.
Of course, "hangouts" in the
true Stanford sense of the word
are places you go to swill beer, and
there are a few of those, too.
The Dutch Goose (3567
Alameda de las Pulgas, Menlo
Park), a functional sort of place
where it's SRO on Senior Pub
Nights, and The Oasis (241 El
Camino, Menlo Park), a downright
ugly place that has been witness
to untold decades of Stanford his
tory. One thing to know: refer to
the two establishments as "The 'O'
" and"The Goose," respectively.
If you'd like your nightlife a bit
rowdier, try St. James Infirmary
(390 Moffett Blvd., Mountain
View) or Antonio's Nut House (321
California Ave., Palo Alto), places
where you can get into a fight if
you try hard enough or look
enough like a Stanford student. In
recent years an attempt has been
made to turn The Lancashire
Tavern (547 Emerson St., Palo
Alto) Into a Stanford hangout of
the Pub Night variety, and this
year it seems to have finally
caught on. A morning alternative:
the weekend brunch crowd at
Hobee's.
Different strokes
It's the familiar refrain: How
about Chinese? Why don't we try
Mexican? And around here it's
easy to fall into, because there are
more ethnic restaurants than you
can shake a burrito or a potsticker
at. Most of them are as bad as
you'd expect; here a few good
ones:
Generations of Stanfordltes
have fallen in love with the mu
shu pork at CheJ Chu's (1067
North San Antonio Road at El
Camino. Los Altos). This always
crowded Mandarin restaurant
prepares perfectly solid, un

exciting dishes — it's the ideal
place for large groups with diverse
tastes. The food's more exciting at
China First (675 El Camino, Palo
Alto), another place with a big rep
utation. The cuisine here is Szec
huan/Hunan, albeit not too spicy,
and there are great dishes on the
menu. Also, China Lion (3345 El
Camino, Palo Alto), is a nearby al
ternative with Man
darln/Szechuan cooking.
On a more modest scale, there
are two worthwhile Chinese places
in Menlo Park: Yuen Yung (639
Santa Cruz Ave.) and Su Hong
(1039 El Camino). Both are eclec
tic but primarily Can
tonese/Mandarin. Su Hong has
better food, Yuen Yung more in
teresting decor — it looks like a
cross between a Chinese restau
rant and a fern bar.
Palo Alto lost its only really good
Mexican restaurant when the
Andes Mexican Restaurant, a
Whiskey Gulch anomaly, folded a
few years back. Now a trip to
Menlo Park or Los Altos is re
quired.
Estrelllta (971 North San An
tonio Rd., Los Altos) isn't what it
used to be. but it still has great
chimlchangas. There are two pas
sable family-style Mexican joints
in Menlo Park, La Luna Mexican
Cafe (1137 Chestnut St.) and
Caleta (1143 D Crane St.). If you
don't mind a drive, the best Latin
restaurant around is probably El
Calderon (699 El Calderon Ave.,
Mountain View), which is hidden
away in a small shopping center
and has a Mexican/Salvadoran
menu. However, if you are insls
tant about staying in the area, try
Compadres Mexican Bar & Grill
(3877 El Camino. Palo Alto) for
great margaritas.
Vive La France!
Without going into too much
detail, there's one local French
restaurant that comes close to
meeting the bistro ideal (good
food, relatively low prices): Le Pot
au Feu (1149 El Camino, Menlo
Park). Somewhat more formal,
but still affordable, is Chez Louis
(4170 El Camino, Palo Alto), vir
tually an Institution. Most of the
other French restaurants nearby
suffer from some combination of

pretentiousness, over-pricing,
bad service or just plain bad food.
Das food
The only real German restau
rant near campus is the Black
Forest Inn (376 First St., Los
Altos). Meals are prepared rather
indifferently, but If you just have
to have some weinerschnitzel with
red cabbage and potato pancakes,
this is the place to go.
Burrito babies
Rosita's Taqueria (171 A sth
Ave., Redwood City) occupies a
storefront in an uninviting part of
Redwood City, but makes the only
authentic burritos-to-go in the
area. These are big sloppy things
that can't be eaten while driving a
car. and Rosita's has a wide vari
ety, Including pork and beef in
several sauces, steak, chicken,
sausage and tongue. Rosita's also
has a good selection of Mexican
beers and soft drinks — you

haven't lived until )'ou've had a
Bolng soda.
Pizza Heaven
Frankie, Johnnie & Luigi, Too
(939 El Camlno, Mountain View)
has no peer In pizza; what It does
have are 45- to 75-minute waits
on weekends, which can fly by if a
large group of people go and drink
while waiting (if you look 21, you'll
be accosted by a roving cocktail
waitress the minute you sign in).
Try the fresh tomato and garlic
pizza, a house specialty, or the
ever-popular stromboli or
Hawaiian. Avoid the Italian din
ners, which are often dreadful. A
distant second to FJ&L Is
Ramona's, which has decent New
York style (i.e. heavy and spicy)
pizza and slightly shorter waits,
and is closer to campus.
Honorable mention goes to the Ar
gentine pizza with barbecue sauce
(ladled on in place of tomato
sauce) at Jose's (2275 El Camino,
Palo Alto), and the pizza with
almost anything on it at

Applewood Inn (1001 El Camino,
Menlo Park).
Very early in the morning
There used to be a wealth of
places where you could go at 2
a.m. — or 4 or 6 a.m. — with the
gang and be obnoxious, or with a
loved one to fortify yourself In an
emotional crisis, or by yourself to
study and mainline some caffeine.
Then Stickney's cut back to
midnight and then became a
trendy yuppie hangout and Luv's
went to 24 hours on weekends
only and eventually became a
singles pickup joint. In the old
days, going to Denny's or Lyons
didn't even cross your mind; now
they're all that's left.
Closer (by about 100 yards) and
friendlier Is Denny's (426 El
Camino, Palo Alto). Denny's Is also
cheaper than Lyons, has food
that's at least as good or better,
tackier vinyl, and that all-star late
night waitress, Ova.


Festive celebrations, such as the one above, occur regularly at local Mexican restaurants.
So why go to Lyons (4298 El
Camlno, Los Altos) at all? Because
sometimes you need a change.
Lyons Is darker and the waitresses
are younger. And if you're deter
mined to eat a lot of food at 4 a.m.
and get really sick, there's nothing
like a Mighty Lion Burger. The
patty melt Is also pretty neat, and
the pancakes are pretty decent.
The only competition left for
these corporate monsters Is the
University Creamery (209 Univer
sity Ave., Palo Alto), which sensed
the vacuum and went to 24-hour
service about two years ago. The
Creamery has pretty mediocre
greasy-spoon food, but the mil
shakes are good (they use Bud's
Ice cream) and It's a lot closer to
campus — within biking range,
even. Plus you can call~-your
friends and loved ones on the
phones supplied to each booth!
I scream for you
Eveiyone loves Ice cream, to be
sure, but no one can deny that the
Stanford area Is practically drown
ing in the stuff. Within a quick
drive of campus are a Haagen-
Dazs (Stanford Barn, 700 Welch
Rd.), two Swenson's (440 Univer
sity Ave., Palo Alto and 1350 El

Camlno. Menlo Park). Blatz
Folded Ice Cream (101 California
Ave., Palo Alto), Double Rainbow
(1083 El Camlno, Menlo Park),
Rick's Rather Rich Ice Cream
(Charleston at Mlddlefleld, Palo
Alto) and the University Creamery.
Then there are at least two Ital
ian ice cream shops: Gelato Alota
(2953 So. El Camlno. San Mateo)
and Gelato Classlco (437 Emer
son St., Palo Alto).
With such a wide variety to
choose from, you might sample
everything and then decide. Two
things to keep In mind: the Ice
cream at Rick's Is smooth, rich
and delicious, and the home-made
waffle cones at Blatz are not to be
missed.
Spirits in the night
There are as many different
kinds of bars as there are
drinkers, and the most popular
ones — the Goose and the 'O' —
we've already discussed. We're
concerned here with the bar as a
comfortable environment In
which to drink, as opposed to a
supportive environment In which
to get drunk.
The Gatehouse (265 Lytton
Ave., Palo Alto) is a snltzy restau
rant by day a snltzy bar by night,
and one of the nicest places In
which to sit around In Palo Alto.
The bar at Mama's (379 Stanford
Shopping Center) is a bit out of

the way, but it has a certain
hushed elegance that makes it at
tractive. Henry's (482 University
Ave.. Palo Alto), Is hot and
crowded once the dinner custom
ers clear out, but there's no one on
the make; just lots of successful
young Palo Altans enjoying their
success in one of their favorite
bars.
If you're looking for something a
bit more staid, try the bar at the
rear of the London House (630
Ramona St., Palo Alto), a loving
recreation of an English pub
where you can get most any
British beer you want, pub snacks
and a game of darts.
Where to go to feel like a Yuppie
Style is everything in a Yuppie
hangout, and Mac Arthur Park (27
University Ave., Palo Alto, near the
train station) is in one of the ap
proved styles: big, open, white
panelled spaces, wood floor, brass
railings everywhere. The food
ranges from mediocre to bad
(except for the barbecued meats;
be sure to order something from
the grill, especially the ribs), but
what does it matter when you can
get potato skins and eight wines
by the glass? Another style is
represented by Waverley Place
(560 Waverley St, Palo Alto), which
is all glass and bleached wood and
expensive (but surprisingly good)
pastas and seafood dishes.

Along with these younger res
taurants, a couple of established
Palo Alto restaurants have swung
with the times: The Gatehouse,
one of Palo Alto's prettiest places
to eat and drink, is taken over by
the young come dinner hour, and
Henry's is a favorite with the local
advertising/design community
that lives off Silicon Valley.
Avoid at all costs
Sometime while you're here
someone is bound to suggest
going to one of these restaurants.
Politely tell him or her you'd rather
undergo root canal work.
Dinah's Shack (4629 El
Camlno, Palo Alto) is one of those
Inexplicably popular restaurants
— I can see why little old ladies go
there, but why in God's name
would anyone else want to spend
upwards of >10 for a lousy buffet
and the chance to hear "Feelings"
played on the harp? Ecco Rls
torante (4290 El Camlno. Palo
Alto), right across the street in the
Hyatt Palo Alto, may be the worst
Italian restaurant in the world,
and the green carpet doesn't help.
(Beware restaurants with
idiosyncratic spelling in their
names). King Chuan (75 Town
and Country Village, Palo Alto)
had at last count three laudatory
Stanford Daily reviews posted In
its window. Don't believe a word of
them.


A Chez Louis chef proudly displays an entree. Chez Louis, just a short
drive from Stanford, is one of the best Franch restaurants in the Stan
ford area.

picpect at least a 45-minute wait;
ifs best, if you can, to go for an
early or late weekday lunch, when
you can often be seated Immedi
ately.
Modeled along much the same
lines is Hobee's (two locations in
Palo Alto: 4224 El Cmalno Real
and Town and Country Village,
jpJcross from the Stadium), a family
operation with more branches
around the peninsula. Hobee's fol
lows more traditional American
breakfast lines — sausage, eggs,
ham — but isn't lacking for fresh
squeezed juices, fruit and other
California trimmings, and it has a
tjuly addictive coffee-cake that
tomes with most of the break
fasts. Both Hobee's and Late for
the Train provide free coffee for
•Waiting crowds.
The Farmer's Market (448 Cali
fornia Ave., Palo Alto) has a small
pienu, spotty service (semi-
Icafeteria style) and the ambiance
'of a butcher shop, but it serves
•great breakfasts (try the apple
'pancakes or a ham/swiss/apple
'omelette) at relatively low prices.
> Finally, there's the favorite
meeting spot of Stanford
— Dinah's Poolside Cof
fee Shop (4269 El Camino, Palo
lAlto, not to be confused with
'JDinah's Shack, a mediocre res
taurant next door), which has
omelettes.

* Where the Cardinal flocks
• r
' Stanford hangouts change from
♦year to year, of course, but there
'are such things as old standards.
J Half the people in Ramona's
♦(541 Ramona St., Palo Alto) on
.any given weekend night will be
'from Stanford; the crush is partic
ularly intense before and after
games. Most of them
be eating the second-best

pizza in the area, while those who
want to be different chew on
calzones or decent hamburgers.
The once-great Ramona's salad
bar retains only a shade of its
former glory.
Down the street at the Good
Earth Restaurant (185 University
Ave., Palo Alto), you'll find a differ
ent. slightly older Stanford crowd
eating chic health food. The iced
tea at this time of year is particu
larly refreshing.
Of course, "hangouts" in the
true Stanford sense of the word
are places you go to swill beer, and
there are a few of those, too.
The Dutch Goose (3567
Alameda de las Pulgas, Menlo
Park), a functional sort of place
where it's SRO on Senior Pub
Nights, and The Oasis (241 El
Camino, Menlo Park), a downright
ugly place that has been witness
to untold decades of Stanford his
tory. One thing to know: refer to
the two establishments as "The 'O'
" and"The Goose," respectively.
If you'd like your nightlife a bit
rowdier, try St. James Infirmary
(390 Moffett Blvd., Mountain
View) or Antonio's Nut House (321
California Ave., Palo Alto), places
where you can get into a fight if
you try hard enough or look
enough like a Stanford student. In
recent years an attempt has been
made to turn The Lancashire
Tavern (547 Emerson St., Palo
Alto) Into a Stanford hangout of
the Pub Night variety, and this
year it seems to have finally
caught on. A morning alternative:
the weekend brunch crowd at
Hobee's.
Different strokes
It's the familiar refrain: How
about Chinese? Why don't we try
Mexican? And around here it's
easy to fall into, because there are
more ethnic restaurants than you
can shake a burrito or a potsticker
at. Most of them are as bad as
you'd expect; here a few good
ones:
Generations of Stanfordltes
have fallen in love with the mu
shu pork at CheJ Chu's (1067
North San Antonio Road at El
Camino. Los Altos). This always
crowded Mandarin restaurant
prepares perfectly solid, un

exciting dishes — it's the ideal
place for large groups with diverse
tastes. The food's more exciting at
China First (675 El Camino, Palo
Alto), another place with a big rep
utation. The cuisine here is Szec
huan/Hunan, albeit not too spicy,
and there are great dishes on the
menu. Also, China Lion (3345 El
Camino, Palo Alto), is a nearby al
ternative with Man
darln/Szechuan cooking.
On a more modest scale, there
are two worthwhile Chinese places
in Menlo Park: Yuen Yung (639
Santa Cruz Ave.) and Su Hong
(1039 El Camino). Both are eclec
tic but primarily Can
tonese/Mandarin. Su Hong has
better food, Yuen Yung more in
teresting decor — it looks like a
cross between a Chinese restau
rant and a fern bar.
Palo Alto lost its only really good
Mexican restaurant when the
Andes Mexican Restaurant, a
Whiskey Gulch anomaly, folded a
few years back. Now a trip to
Menlo Park or Los Altos is re
quired.
Estrelllta (971 North San An
tonio Rd., Los Altos) isn't what it
used to be. but it still has great
chimlchangas. There are two pas
sable family-style Mexican joints
in Menlo Park, La Luna Mexican
Cafe (1137 Chestnut St.) and
Caleta (1143 D Crane St.). If you
don't mind a drive, the best Latin
restaurant around is probably El
Calderon (699 El Calderon Ave.,
Mountain View), which is hidden
away in a small shopping center
and has a Mexican/Salvadoran
menu. However, if you are insls
tant about staying in the area, try
Compadres Mexican Bar & Grill
(3877 El Camino. Palo Alto) for
great margaritas.
Vive La France!
Without going into too much
detail, there's one local French
restaurant that comes close to
meeting the bistro ideal (good
food, relatively low prices): Le Pot
au Feu (1149 El Camino, Menlo
Park). Somewhat more formal,
but still affordable, is Chez Louis
(4170 El Camino, Palo Alto), vir
tually an Institution. Most of the
other French restaurants nearby
suffer from some combination of

pretentiousness, over-pricing,
bad service or just plain bad food.
Das food
The only real German restau
rant near campus is the Black
Forest Inn (376 First St., Los
Altos). Meals are prepared rather
indifferently, but If you just have
to have some weinerschnitzel with
red cabbage and potato pancakes,
this is the place to go.
Burrito babies
Rosita's Taqueria (171 A sth
Ave., Redwood City) occupies a
storefront in an uninviting part of
Redwood City, but makes the only
authentic burritos-to-go in the
area. These are big sloppy things
that can't be eaten while driving a
car. and Rosita's has a wide vari
ety, Including pork and beef in
several sauces, steak, chicken,
sausage and tongue. Rosita's also
has a good selection of Mexican
beers and soft drinks — you

haven't lived until )'ou've had a
Bolng soda.
Pizza Heaven
Frankie, Johnnie & Luigi, Too
(939 El Camlno, Mountain View)
has no peer In pizza; what It does
have are 45- to 75-minute waits
on weekends, which can fly by if a
large group of people go and drink
while waiting (if you look 21, you'll
be accosted by a roving cocktail
waitress the minute you sign in).
Try the fresh tomato and garlic
pizza, a house specialty, or the
ever-popular stromboli or
Hawaiian. Avoid the Italian din
ners, which are often dreadful. A
distant second to FJ&L Is
Ramona's, which has decent New
York style (i.e. heavy and spicy)
pizza and slightly shorter waits,
and is closer to campus.
Honorable mention goes to the Ar
gentine pizza with barbecue sauce
(ladled on in place of tomato
sauce) at Jose's (2275 El Camino,
Palo Alto), and the pizza with
almost anything on it at

Applewood Inn (1001 El Camino,
Menlo Park).
Very early in the morning
There used to be a wealth of
places where you could go at 2
a.m. — or 4 or 6 a.m. — with the
gang and be obnoxious, or with a
loved one to fortify yourself In an
emotional crisis, or by yourself to
study and mainline some caffeine.
Then Stickney's cut back to
midnight and then became a
trendy yuppie hangout and Luv's
went to 24 hours on weekends
only and eventually became a
singles pickup joint. In the old
days, going to Denny's or Lyons
didn't even cross your mind; now
they're all that's left.
Closer (by about 100 yards) and
friendlier Is Denny's (426 El
Camino, Palo Alto). Denny's Is also
cheaper than Lyons, has food
that's at least as good or better,
tackier vinyl, and that all-star late
night waitress, Ova.


Festive celebrations, such as the one above, occur regularly at local Mexican restaurants.
So why go to Lyons (4298 El
Camlno, Los Altos) at all? Because
sometimes you need a change.
Lyons Is darker and the waitresses
are younger. And if you're deter
mined to eat a lot of food at 4 a.m.
and get really sick, there's nothing
like a Mighty Lion Burger. The
patty melt Is also pretty neat, and
the pancakes are pretty decent.
The only competition left for
these corporate monsters Is the
University Creamery (209 Univer
sity Ave., Palo Alto), which sensed
the vacuum and went to 24-hour
service about two years ago. The
Creamery has pretty mediocre
greasy-spoon food, but the mil
shakes are good (they use Bud's
Ice cream) and It's a lot closer to
campus — within biking range,
even. Plus you can call~-your
friends and loved ones on the
phones supplied to each booth!
I scream for you
Eveiyone loves Ice cream, to be
sure, but no one can deny that the
Stanford area Is practically drown
ing in the stuff. Within a quick
drive of campus are a Haagen-
Dazs (Stanford Barn, 700 Welch
Rd.), two Swenson's (440 Univer
sity Ave., Palo Alto and 1350 El

Camlno. Menlo Park). Blatz
Folded Ice Cream (101 California
Ave., Palo Alto), Double Rainbow
(1083 El Camlno, Menlo Park),
Rick's Rather Rich Ice Cream
(Charleston at Mlddlefleld, Palo
Alto) and the University Creamery.
Then there are at least two Ital
ian ice cream shops: Gelato Alota
(2953 So. El Camlno. San Mateo)
and Gelato Classlco (437 Emer
son St., Palo Alto).
With such a wide variety to
choose from, you might sample
everything and then decide. Two
things to keep In mind: the Ice
cream at Rick's Is smooth, rich
and delicious, and the home-made
waffle cones at Blatz are not to be
missed.
Spirits in the night
There are as many different
kinds of bars as there are
drinkers, and the most popular
ones — the Goose and the 'O' —
we've already discussed. We're
concerned here with the bar as a
comfortable environment In
which to drink, as opposed to a
supportive environment In which
to get drunk.
The Gatehouse (265 Lytton
Ave., Palo Alto) is a snltzy restau
rant by day a snltzy bar by night,
and one of the nicest places In
which to sit around In Palo Alto.
The bar at Mama's (379 Stanford
Shopping Center) is a bit out of

the way, but it has a certain
hushed elegance that makes it at
tractive. Henry's (482 University
Ave.. Palo Alto), Is hot and
crowded once the dinner custom
ers clear out, but there's no one on
the make; just lots of successful
young Palo Altans enjoying their
success in one of their favorite
bars.
If you're looking for something a
bit more staid, try the bar at the
rear of the London House (630
Ramona St., Palo Alto), a loving
recreation of an English pub
where you can get most any
British beer you want, pub snacks
and a game of darts.
Where to go to feel like a Yuppie
Style is everything in a Yuppie
hangout, and Mac Arthur Park (27
University Ave., Palo Alto, near the
train station) is in one of the ap
proved styles: big, open, white
panelled spaces, wood floor, brass
railings everywhere. The food
ranges from mediocre to bad
(except for the barbecued meats;
be sure to order something from
the grill, especially the ribs), but
what does it matter when you can
get potato skins and eight wines
by the glass? Another style is
represented by Waverley Place
(560 Waverley St, Palo Alto), which
is all glass and bleached wood and
expensive (but surprisingly good)
pastas and seafood dishes.

Along with these younger res
taurants, a couple of established
Palo Alto restaurants have swung
with the times: The Gatehouse,
one of Palo Alto's prettiest places
to eat and drink, is taken over by
the young come dinner hour, and
Henry's is a favorite with the local
advertising/design community
that lives off Silicon Valley.
Avoid at all costs
Sometime while you're here
someone is bound to suggest
going to one of these restaurants.
Politely tell him or her you'd rather
undergo root canal work.
Dinah's Shack (4629 El
Camlno, Palo Alto) is one of those
Inexplicably popular restaurants
— I can see why little old ladies go
there, but why in God's name
would anyone else want to spend
upwards of >10 for a lousy buffet
and the chance to hear "Feelings"
played on the harp? Ecco Rls
torante (4290 El Camlno. Palo
Alto), right across the street in the
Hyatt Palo Alto, may be the worst
Italian restaurant in the world,
and the green carpet doesn't help.
(Beware restaurants with
idiosyncratic spelling in their
names). King Chuan (75 Town
and Country Village, Palo Alto)
had at last count three laudatory
Stanford Daily reviews posted In
its window. Don't believe a word of
them.


A Chez Louis chef proudly displays an entree. Chez Louis, just a short
drive from Stanford, is one of the best Franch restaurants in the Stan
ford area.
»• Morning eaters are lucky here —
f4tlo Alto and Menlo Park have a
plethora of good restaurants that
Specialize In breakfast and lunch.
•, First among equals Is Late for
fye Train (150 Mlddlefleld Rd..
Menlo Park, near the train sta
tion), a folksy place that makes
great omelettes, divine blitzes and
fruit pancakes and the usual
£alads and sandwiches, plus ever
ejianging desserts. If you go on a
ieeekend, particularly a Sunday,
picpect at least a 45-minute wait;

* Where the Cardinal flocks
• r
' Stanford hangouts change from
♦year to year, of course, but there
'are such things as old standards.
J Half the people in Ramona's
♦(541 Ramona St., Palo Alto) on
.any given weekend night will be
'from Stanford; the crush is partic
ularly intense before and after
games. Most of them
be eating the second-best

pizza in the area, while those who
want to be different chew on
calzones or decent hamburgers.
The once-great Ramona's salad
bar retains only a shade of its
former glory.
Down the street at the Good
Earth Restaurant (185 University
Ave., Palo Alto), you'll find a differ
ent. slightly older Stanford crowd
eating chic health food. The iced
tea at this time of year is particu
larly refreshing.
Of course, "hangouts" in the
true Stanford sense of the word
are places you go to swill beer, and
there are a few of those, too.
The Dutch Goose (3567
Alameda de las Pulgas, Menlo
Park), a functional sort of place
where it's SRO on Senior Pub
Nights, and The Oasis (241 El
Camino, Menlo Park), a downright
ugly place that has been witness
to untold decades of Stanford his
tory. One thing to know: refer to
the two establishments as "The 'O'
" and"The Goose," respectively.
If you'd like your nightlife a bit
rowdier, try St. James Infirmary
(390 Moffett Blvd., Mountain
View) or Antonio's Nut House (321
California Ave., Palo Alto), places
where you can get into a fight if
you try hard enough or look
enough like a Stanford student. In
recent years an attempt has been
made to turn The Lancashire
Tavern (547 Emerson St., Palo
Alto) Into a Stanford hangout of
the Pub Night variety, and this
year it seems to have finally
caught on. A morning alternative:
the weekend brunch crowd at
Hobee's.
Different strokes
It's the familiar refrain: How
about Chinese? Why don't we try
Mexican? And around here it's
easy to fall into, because there are
more ethnic restaurants than you
can shake a burrito or a potsticker
at. Most of them are as bad as
you'd expect; here a few good
ones:
Generations of Stanfordltes
have fallen in love with the mu
shu pork at CheJ Chu's (1067
North San Antonio Road at El
Camino. Los Altos). This always
crowded Mandarin restaurant
prepares perfectly solid, un

exciting dishes — it's the ideal
place for large groups with diverse
tastes. The food's more exciting at
China First (675 El Camino, Palo
Alto), another place with a big rep
utation. The cuisine here is Szec
huan/Hunan, albeit not too spicy,
and there are great dishes on the
menu. Also, China Lion (3345 El
Camino, Palo Alto), is a nearby al
ternative with Man
darln/Szechuan cooking.
On a more modest scale, there
are two worthwhile Chinese places
in Menlo Park: Yuen Yung (639
Santa Cruz Ave.) and Su Hong
(1039 El Camino). Both are eclec
tic but primarily Can
tonese/Mandarin. Su Hong has
better food, Yuen Yung more in
teresting decor — it looks like a
cross between a Chinese restau
rant and a fern bar.
Palo Alto lost its only really good
Mexican restaurant when the
Andes Mexican Restaurant, a
Whiskey Gulch anomaly, folded a
few years back. Now a trip to
Menlo Park or Los Altos is re
quired.
Estrelllta (971 North San An
tonio Rd., Los Altos) isn't what it
used to be. but it still has great
chimlchangas. There are two pas
sable family-style Mexican joints
in Menlo Park, La Luna Mexican
Cafe (1137 Chestnut St.) and
Caleta (1143 D Crane St.). If you
don't mind a drive, the best Latin
restaurant around is probably El
Calderon (699 El Calderon Ave.,
Mountain View), which is hidden
away in a small shopping center
and has a Mexican/Salvadoran
menu. However, if you are insls
tant about staying in the area, try
Compadres Mexican Bar & Grill
(3877 El Camino. Palo Alto) for
great margaritas.
Vive La France!
Without going into too much
detail, there's one local French
restaurant that comes close to
meeting the bistro ideal (good
food, relatively low prices): Le Pot
au Feu (1149 El Camino, Menlo
Park). Somewhat more formal,
but still affordable, is Chez Louis
(4170 El Camino, Palo Alto), vir
tually an Institution. Most of the
other French restaurants nearby
suffer from some combination of

pretentiousness, over-pricing,
bad service or just plain bad food.
Das food
The only real German restau
rant near campus is the Black
Forest Inn (376 First St., Los
Altos). Meals are prepared rather
indifferently, but If you just have
to have some weinerschnitzel with
red cabbage and potato pancakes,
this is the place to go.
Burrito babies
Rosita's Taqueria (171 A sth
Ave., Redwood City) occupies a
storefront in an uninviting part of
Redwood City, but makes the only
authentic burritos-to-go in the
area. These are big sloppy things
that can't be eaten while driving a
car. and Rosita's has a wide vari
ety, Including pork and beef in
several sauces, steak, chicken,
sausage and tongue. Rosita's also
has a good selection of Mexican
beers and soft drinks — you

haven't lived until )'ou've had a
Bolng soda.
Pizza Heaven
Frankie, Johnnie & Luigi, Too
(939 El Camlno, Mountain View)
has no peer In pizza; what It does
have are 45- to 75-minute waits
on weekends, which can fly by if a
large group of people go and drink
while waiting (if you look 21, you'll
be accosted by a roving cocktail
waitress the minute you sign in).
Try the fresh tomato and garlic
pizza, a house specialty, or the
ever-popular stromboli or
Hawaiian. Avoid the Italian din
ners, which are often dreadful. A
distant second to FJ&L Is
Ramona's, which has decent New
York style (i.e. heavy and spicy)
pizza and slightly shorter waits,
and is closer to campus.
Honorable mention goes to the Ar
gentine pizza with barbecue sauce
(ladled on in place of tomato
sauce) at Jose's (2275 El Camino,
Palo Alto), and the pizza with
almost anything on it at

Applewood Inn (1001 El Camino,
Menlo Park).
Very early in the morning
There used to be a wealth of
places where you could go at 2
a.m. — or 4 or 6 a.m. — with the
gang and be obnoxious, or with a
loved one to fortify yourself In an
emotional crisis, or by yourself to
study and mainline some caffeine.
Then Stickney's cut back to
midnight and then became a
trendy yuppie hangout and Luv's
went to 24 hours on weekends
only and eventually became a
singles pickup joint. In the old
days, going to Denny's or Lyons
didn't even cross your mind; now
they're all that's left.
Closer (by about 100 yards) and
friendlier Is Denny's (426 El
Camino, Palo Alto). Denny's Is also
cheaper than Lyons, has food
that's at least as good or better,
tackier vinyl, and that all-star late
night waitress, Ova.


Festive celebrations, such as the one above, occur regularly at local Mexican restaurants.
So why go to Lyons (4298 El
Camlno, Los Altos) at all? Because
sometimes you need a change.
Lyons Is darker and the waitresses
are younger. And if you're deter
mined to eat a lot of food at 4 a.m.
and get really sick, there's nothing
like a Mighty Lion Burger. The
patty melt Is also pretty neat, and
the pancakes are pretty decent.
The only competition left for
these corporate monsters Is the
University Creamery (209 Univer
sity Ave., Palo Alto), which sensed
the vacuum and went to 24-hour
service about two years ago. The
Creamery has pretty mediocre
greasy-spoon food, but the mil
shakes are good (they use Bud's
Ice cream) and It's a lot closer to
campus — within biking range,
even. Plus you can call~-your
friends and loved ones on the
phones supplied to each booth!
I scream for you
Eveiyone loves Ice cream, to be
sure, but no one can deny that the
Stanford area Is practically drown
ing in the stuff. Within a quick
drive of campus are a Haagen-
Dazs (Stanford Barn, 700 Welch
Rd.), two Swenson's (440 Univer
sity Ave., Palo Alto and 1350 El

Camlno. Menlo Park). Blatz
Folded Ice Cream (101 California
Ave., Palo Alto), Double Rainbow
(1083 El Camlno, Menlo Park),
Rick's Rather Rich Ice Cream
(Charleston at Mlddlefleld, Palo
Alto) and the University Creamery.
Then there are at least two Ital
ian ice cream shops: Gelato Alota
(2953 So. El Camlno. San Mateo)
and Gelato Classlco (437 Emer
son St., Palo Alto).
With such a wide variety to
choose from, you might sample
everything and then decide. Two
things to keep In mind: the Ice
cream at Rick's Is smooth, rich
and delicious, and the home-made
waffle cones at Blatz are not to be
missed.
Spirits in the night
There are as many different
kinds of bars as there are
drinkers, and the most popular
ones — the Goose and the 'O' —
we've already discussed. We're
concerned here with the bar as a
comfortable environment In
which to drink, as opposed to a
supportive environment In which
to get drunk.
The Gatehouse (265 Lytton
Ave., Palo Alto) is a snltzy restau
rant by day a snltzy bar by night,
and one of the nicest places In
which to sit around In Palo Alto.
The bar at Mama's (379 Stanford
Shopping Center) is a bit out of

the way, but it has a certain
hushed elegance that makes it at
tractive. Henry's (482 University
Ave.. Palo Alto), Is hot and
crowded once the dinner custom
ers clear out, but there's no one on
the make; just lots of successful
young Palo Altans enjoying their
success in one of their favorite
bars.
If you're looking for something a
bit more staid, try the bar at the
rear of the London House (630
Ramona St., Palo Alto), a loving
recreation of an English pub
where you can get most any
British beer you want, pub snacks
and a game of darts.
Where to go to feel like a Yuppie
Style is everything in a Yuppie
hangout, and Mac Arthur Park (27
University Ave., Palo Alto, near the
train station) is in one of the ap
proved styles: big, open, white
panelled spaces, wood floor, brass
railings everywhere. The food
ranges from mediocre to bad
(except for the barbecued meats;
be sure to order something from
the grill, especially the ribs), but
what does it matter when you can
get potato skins and eight wines
by the glass? Another style is
represented by Waverley Place
(560 Waverley St, Palo Alto), which
is all glass and bleached wood and
expensive (but surprisingly good)
pastas and seafood dishes.

Along with these younger res
taurants, a couple of established
Palo Alto restaurants have swung
with the times: The Gatehouse,
one of Palo Alto's prettiest places
to eat and drink, is taken over by
the young come dinner hour, and
Henry's is a favorite with the local
advertising/design community
that lives off Silicon Valley.
Avoid at all costs
Sometime while you're here
someone is bound to suggest
going to one of these restaurants.
Politely tell him or her you'd rather
undergo root canal work.
Dinah's Shack (4629 El
Camlno, Palo Alto) is one of those
Inexplicably popular restaurants
— I can see why little old ladies go
there, but why in God's name
would anyone else want to spend
upwards of >10 for a lousy buffet
and the chance to hear "Feelings"
played on the harp? Ecco Rls
torante (4290 El Camlno. Palo
Alto), right across the street in the
Hyatt Palo Alto, may be the worst
Italian restaurant in the world,
and the green carpet doesn't help.
(Beware restaurants with
idiosyncratic spelling in their
names). King Chuan (75 Town
and Country Village, Palo Alto)
had at last count three laudatory
Stanford Daily reviews posted In
its window. Don't believe a word of
them.


A Chez Louis chef proudly displays an entree. Chez Louis, just a short
drive from Stanford, is one of the best Franch restaurants in the Stan
ford area.
»• Morning eaters are lucky here —
f4tlo Alto and Menlo Park have a
plethora of good restaurants that
Specialize In breakfast and lunch.
•, First among equals Is Late for
fye Train (150 Mlddlefleld Rd..
Menlo Park, near the train sta
tion), a folksy place that makes
great omelettes, divine blitzes and
fruit pancakes and the usual
£alads and sandwiches, plus ever
ejianging desserts. If you go on a
ieeekend, particularly a Sunday,
picpect at least a 45-minute wait;
ifs best, if you can, to go for an
early or late weekday lunch, when
you can often be seated Immedi
ately.
Modeled along much the same
lines is Hobee's (two locations in
Palo Alto: 4224 El Cmalno Real
and Town and Country Village,
jpJcross from the Stadium), a family
operation with more branches
around the peninsula. Hobee's fol
lows more traditional American

•great breakfasts (try the apple
'pancakes or a ham/swiss/apple
'omelette) at relatively low prices.
> Finally, there's the favorite
meeting spot of Stanford
— Dinah's Poolside Cof
fee Shop (4269 El Camino, Palo
lAlto, not to be confused with
'JDinah's Shack, a mediocre res
taurant next door), which has
omelettes.

' Stanford hangouts change from
♦year to year, of course, but there
'are such things as old standards.
J Half the people in Ramona's
♦(541 Ramona St., Palo Alto) on
.any given weekend night will be
'from Stanford; the crush is partic
ularly intense before and after
games. Most of them
be eating the second-best

pizza in the area, while those who
want to be different chew on
calzones or decent hamburgers.
The once-great Ramona's salad
bar retains only a shade of its
former glory.
Down the street at the Good
Earth Restaurant (185 University
Ave., Palo Alto), you'll find a differ
ent. slightly older Stanford crowd
eating chic health food. The iced
tea at this time of year is particu
larly refreshing.
Of course, "hangouts" in the
true Stanford sense of the word
are places you go to swill beer, and
there are a few of those, too.
The Dutch Goose (3567
Alameda de las Pulgas, Menlo
Park), a functional sort of place
where it's SRO on Senior Pub
Nights, and The Oasis (241 El
Camino, Menlo Park), a downright
ugly place that has been witness
to untold decades of Stanford his
tory. One thing to know: refer to
the two establishments as "The 'O'
" and"The Goose," respectively.
If you'd like your nightlife a bit
rowdier, try St. James Infirmary
(390 Moffett Blvd., Mountain
View) or Antonio's Nut House (321
California Ave., Palo Alto), places
where you can get into a fight if
you try hard enough or look
enough like a Stanford student. In
recent years an attempt has been
made to turn The Lancashire
Tavern (547 Emerson St., Palo
Alto) Into a Stanford hangout of
the Pub Night variety, and this
year it seems to have finally
caught on. A morning alternative:
the weekend brunch crowd at
Hobee's.
Different strokes
It's the familiar refrain: How
about Chinese? Why don't we try
Mexican? And around here it's
easy to fall into, because there are
more ethnic restaurants than you
can shake a burrito or a potsticker
at. Most of them are as bad as
you'd expect; here a few good
ones:
Generations of Stanfordltes
have fallen in love with the mu
shu pork at CheJ Chu's (1067
North San Antonio Road at El
Camino. Los Altos). This always
crowded Mandarin restaurant
prepares perfectly solid, un

exciting dishes — it's the ideal
place for large groups with diverse
tastes. The food's more exciting at
China First (675 El Camino, Palo
Alto), another place with a big rep
utation. The cuisine here is Szec
huan/Hunan, albeit not too spicy,
and there are great dishes on the
menu. Also, China Lion (3345 El
Camino, Palo Alto), is a nearby al
ternative with Man
darln/Szechuan cooking.
On a more modest scale, there
are two worthwhile Chinese places
in Menlo Park: Yuen Yung (639
Santa Cruz Ave.) and Su Hong
(1039 El Camino). Both are eclec
tic but primarily Can
tonese/Mandarin. Su Hong has
better food, Yuen Yung more in
teresting decor — it looks like a
cross between a Chinese restau
rant and a fern bar.
Palo Alto lost its only really good
Mexican restaurant when the
Andes Mexican Restaurant, a
Whiskey Gulch anomaly, folded a
few years back. Now a trip to
Menlo Park or Los Altos is re
quired.
Estrelllta (971 North San An
tonio Rd., Los Altos) isn't what it
used to be. but it still has great
chimlchangas. There are two pas
sable family-style Mexican joints
in Menlo Park, La Luna Mexican
Cafe (1137 Chestnut St.) and
Caleta (1143 D Crane St.). If you
don't mind a drive, the best Latin
restaurant around is probably El
Calderon (699 El Calderon Ave.,
Mountain View), which is hidden
away in a small shopping center
and has a Mexican/Salvadoran
menu. However, if you are insls
tant about staying in the area, try
Compadres Mexican Bar & Grill
(3877 El Camino. Palo Alto) for
great margaritas.
Vive La France!
Without going into too much
detail, there's one local French
restaurant that comes close to
meeting the bistro ideal (good
food, relatively low prices): Le Pot
au Feu (1149 El Camino, Menlo
Park). Somewhat more formal,
but still affordable, is Chez Louis
(4170 El Camino, Palo Alto), vir
tually an Institution. Most of the
other French restaurants nearby
suffer from some combination of

pretentiousness, over-pricing,
bad service or just plain bad food.
Das food
The only real German restau
rant near campus is the Black
Forest Inn (376 First St., Los
Altos). Meals are prepared rather
indifferently, but If you just have
to have some weinerschnitzel with
red cabbage and potato pancakes,
this is the place to go.
Burrito babies
Rosita's Taqueria (171 A sth
Ave., Redwood City) occupies a
storefront in an uninviting part of
Redwood City, but makes the only
authentic burritos-to-go in the
area. These are big sloppy things
that can't be eaten while driving a
car. and Rosita's has a wide vari
ety, Including pork and beef in
several sauces, steak, chicken,
sausage and tongue. Rosita's also
has a good selection of Mexican
beers and soft drinks — you

haven't lived until )'ou've had a
Bolng soda.
Pizza Heaven
Frankie, Johnnie & Luigi, Too
(939 El Camlno, Mountain View)
has no peer In pizza; what It does
have are 45- to 75-minute waits
on weekends, which can fly by if a
large group of people go and drink
while waiting (if you look 21, you'll
be accosted by a roving cocktail
waitress the minute you sign in).
Try the fresh tomato and garlic
pizza, a house specialty, or the
ever-popular stromboli or
Hawaiian. Avoid the Italian din
ners, which are often dreadful. A
distant second to FJ&L Is
Ramona's, which has decent New
York style (i.e. heavy and spicy)
pizza and slightly shorter waits,
and is closer to campus.
Honorable mention goes to the Ar
gentine pizza with barbecue sauce
(ladled on in place of tomato
sauce) at Jose's (2275 El Camino,
Palo Alto), and the pizza with
almost anything on it at

Applewood Inn (1001 El Camino,
Menlo Park).
Very early in the morning
There used to be a wealth of
places where you could go at 2
a.m. — or 4 or 6 a.m. — with the
gang and be obnoxious, or with a
loved one to fortify yourself In an
emotional crisis, or by yourself to
study and mainline some caffeine.
Then Stickney's cut back to
midnight and then became a
trendy yuppie hangout and Luv's
went to 24 hours on weekends
only and eventually became a
singles pickup joint. In the old
days, going to Denny's or Lyons
didn't even cross your mind; now
they're all that's left.
Closer (by about 100 yards) and
friendlier Is Denny's (426 El
Camino, Palo Alto). Denny's Is also
cheaper than Lyons, has food
that's at least as good or better,
tackier vinyl, and that all-star late
night waitress, Ova.


Festive celebrations, such as the one above, occur regularly at local Mexican restaurants.
So why go to Lyons (4298 El
Camlno, Los Altos) at all? Because
sometimes you need a change.
Lyons Is darker and the waitresses
are younger. And if you're deter
mined to eat a lot of food at 4 a.m.
and get really sick, there's nothing
like a Mighty Lion Burger. The
patty melt Is also pretty neat, and
the pancakes are pretty decent.
The only competition left for
these corporate monsters Is the
University Creamery (209 Univer
sity Ave., Palo Alto), which sensed
the vacuum and went to 24-hour
service about two years ago. The
Creamery has pretty mediocre
greasy-spoon food, but the mil
shakes are good (they use Bud's
Ice cream) and It's a lot closer to
campus — within biking range,
even. Plus you can call~-your
friends and loved ones on the
phones supplied to each booth!
I scream for you
Eveiyone loves Ice cream, to be
sure, but no one can deny that the
Stanford area Is practically drown
ing in the stuff. Within a quick
drive of campus are a Haagen-
Dazs (Stanford Barn, 700 Welch
Rd.), two Swenson's (440 Univer
sity Ave., Palo Alto and 1350 El

Camlno. Menlo Park). Blatz
Folded Ice Cream (101 California
Ave., Palo Alto), Double Rainbow
(1083 El Camlno, Menlo Park),
Rick's Rather Rich Ice Cream
(Charleston at Mlddlefleld, Palo
Alto) and the University Creamery.
Then there are at least two Ital
ian ice cream shops: Gelato Alota
(2953 So. El Camlno. San Mateo)
and Gelato Classlco (437 Emer
son St., Palo Alto).
With such a wide variety to
choose from, you might sample
everything and then decide. Two
things to keep In mind: the Ice
cream at Rick's Is smooth, rich
and delicious, and the home-made
waffle cones at Blatz are not to be
missed.
Spirits in the night
There are as many different
kinds of bars as there are
drinkers, and the most popular
ones — the Goose and the 'O' —
we've already discussed. We're
concerned here with the bar as a
comfortable environment In
which to drink, as opposed to a
supportive environment In which
to get drunk.
The Gatehouse (265 Lytton
Ave., Palo Alto) is a snltzy restau
rant by day a snltzy bar by night,
and one of the nicest places In
which to sit around In Palo Alto.
The bar at Mama's (379 Stanford
Shopping Center) is a bit out of

the way, but it has a certain
hushed elegance that makes it at
tractive. Henry's (482 University
Ave.. Palo Alto), Is hot and
crowded once the dinner custom
ers clear out, but there's no one on
the make; just lots of successful
young Palo Altans enjoying their
success in one of their favorite
bars.
If you're looking for something a
bit more staid, try the bar at the
rear of the London House (630
Ramona St., Palo Alto), a loving
recreation of an English pub
where you can get most any
British beer you want, pub snacks
and a game of darts.
Where to go to feel like a Yuppie
Style is everything in a Yuppie
hangout, and Mac Arthur Park (27
University Ave., Palo Alto, near the
train station) is in one of the ap
proved styles: big, open, white
panelled spaces, wood floor, brass
railings everywhere. The food
ranges from mediocre to bad
(except for the barbecued meats;
be sure to order something from
the grill, especially the ribs), but
what does it matter when you can
get potato skins and eight wines
by the glass? Another style is
represented by Waverley Place
(560 Waverley St, Palo Alto), which
is all glass and bleached wood and
expensive (but surprisingly good)
pastas and seafood dishes.

Along with these younger res
taurants, a couple of established
Palo Alto restaurants have swung
with the times: The Gatehouse,
one of Palo Alto's prettiest places
to eat and drink, is taken over by
the young come dinner hour, and
Henry's is a favorite with the local
advertising/design community
that lives off Silicon Valley.
Avoid at all costs
Sometime while you're here
someone is bound to suggest
going to one of these restaurants.
Politely tell him or her you'd rather
undergo root canal work.
Dinah's Shack (4629 El
Camlno, Palo Alto) is one of those
Inexplicably popular restaurants
— I can see why little old ladies go
there, but why in God's name
would anyone else want to spend
upwards of >10 for a lousy buffet
and the chance to hear "Feelings"
played on the harp? Ecco Rls
torante (4290 El Camlno. Palo
Alto), right across the street in the
Hyatt Palo Alto, may be the worst
Italian restaurant in the world,
and the green carpet doesn't help.
(Beware restaurants with
idiosyncratic spelling in their
names). King Chuan (75 Town
and Country Village, Palo Alto)
had at last count three laudatory
Stanford Daily reviews posted In
its window. Don't believe a word of
them.


A Chez Louis chef proudly displays an entree. Chez Louis, just a short
drive from Stanford, is one of the best Franch restaurants in the Stan
ford area.
