The College World Series is unlike any other event in collegiate athletics. It Is drawn out
over a ten-day period that tests the strength, depth and concentration of every team. Each
game is televised nationally and scrutinized by a huge press corps. And the atmosphere at
Rosenblatt Stadium in Omaha is something akin to that of a carnival.
All this makes the College World Series a pressure cooker for participants.
Unlike the cram-packed format of regional playoffs, the World Series bracket provides a
great deal of idle time between games, especially for teams that win in the early rounds.
Stanford had two days off between its first and second games, then another full day off be
tween its second and third.
Players spent their free time with their parents, or lounging by the pool at the Marriott or
getting away from the hubbub with a stay in the hotel sauna. Most of the Cardinal players
also had more pressing matters to attend to during their free hours: exams. As probably the
only team in the tournament that wasn't out of school yet, the Cardinal had one more dis
traction to face in its quest for the title. Some worked on papers or prepared for finals, while
others actually took their exams in Omaha, proctored by one of the team's coaches.
When game time came, pressure reached a peak as players stepped onto an unfamiliar
field, to play an unfamiliar opponent, in front of an unfamiliar and vociferous crowd. Hitters
found a moment of repose in the on-deck circle before stepping to bat.
By the end of the Series, perhaps the greatest strain was on the Cardinal pitching staff,
which began to show wear and tear inevitably brought on by tournament play. Jack
McDowell took the mound for the third time in the tournament, with little left to pitch on
but guts and a will to win.


On one of the team's nights off during the Series, sopho
more Eric DeGraw turns his attention to a 10-page eco
nomics paper. Papers and finals were a nagging distrac
tion for the Cardinal during its stay in Omaha. Many
players took exams, proctored by one of the team's
coaches, during the course of the tournament.


With runners on, junior Jack
McDowell blows off some steam
before going to the stretch in the
championship game against
Oklahoma State. Arm-weary in
his third start of the Series,
McDowell was in trouble fre
quently but battled gamely and
worked himself out of several
tough situations.
