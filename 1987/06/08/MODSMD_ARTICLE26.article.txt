# Seniors take a look back at their Farm experiences
## 
### ANN MARSH Staff writer 
At the end of Sunday's commence
ment ceremonies, when the mortar
boards are tossed skyward, this year's
graduates will quit Stanford with an eye
to the future and diplomas clutched
tightly in hand.
Aside from the degrees, each will carry
away four years of experiences — good
and bad — that have shaped their years
at the Farm and perhaps their different
directions in the future.
Of the members of the graduating
class, what are some of these individ
uals' most memorable experiences —
silly and serious — from their under
graduate years?
Here, a number of graduating seniors,
from a diverse selection of campus
groups, share their favorites:
For Carey White, member of the Coun
cil of Presidents, "repelling off the fourth
floor terrace of Meyer Library" was a
thrill.
For White and friends, none of whom
were caught, playing the daredevil was
only scary "when one of my friends got
caught under the ledge of the roof."
White said. But the human spider was
freed and all lived to tell the tale.
Emi Usui, vice president of AIESEC,
an international organization of busi
ness students at Stanford, recalls the
time the United States Invaded Grenada
and "some smart ass got it into his head
that Trancos, Usui's dorm, ought to
invade Grenada," another dormitory.
The Trancos team rallied in their
dorm lounge and discussed strategy,
dressed in fatiques, armed themselves
with water balloons and firecrackers
and proceeded to the attack, while some
one played music from the movie
"Apocalypse Now."
Their stated purpose, according to
Usui, was to "make the dorm safe for

medical students." Grenada residents
had been warned, however, and they
prepared an elaborate counter strategy,
which resulted in a spectacular con
frontation.
While many seniors fondly recalled an
tics from their freshmen years, others
spoke of more serious experiences that
profoundly affected their undergraduate
education.
Lewie Ford, student director of Inno
vative Academic Courses and former
general representative of the Black Stu
dent Union, claimed that the most
memorable time he spent at Stanford
was organizing sit-ins and forums pro
testing Stanford's investments in South
Africa.
Ford said he recalls the mass rallies of
700 to 800 people in the Quad and the
numerous notable people, such as Joan
Baez and Angela Davis, who visited the
campus to support the protests.
"In some ways I think we had an im
pact, at least on individuals, in making
people more sensitive to the issue (of di
vestment from South Africa)," Ford said.
People became more aware of their con
nection to the rest of the world, he said.
"One thing I've taken away from Stan
ford is that I'm no longer mystified with
(the University) or big names," Ford said
adding that he is more aware of the fal
libility of human decision making on all
levels.
For Novian Whitsitt, one of the senior
class presidents and former member of
the Stanford basketball team, favorite
memories were athletic as well as politi
cal.
Beating Berkeley this year was a high
point, he said. "We hadn't beaten them
since my freshman year." The victory,
achieved over third-placed Berkeley, had
special meaning for the sixth-placed
Cardinal.
Fleet Street singer Carl Gabrielson
recalled the time the a cappella men's

singing group was making the rounds
singing to individuals on Valentine's
Day.
"We were singing My Romance' to a
girl with a bad hangover and she ran
over and threw up out the second story
window of La Maison Francaise," said
Gabrielson. The Fleet Streeters finished
out their song.
Alex Russo, also with Fleet Street, said
singing with the Mendicants, another
mens' vocal ensemble, at Stanfunk was
memorable. When the "thirteen white
guys and an Asian" walked out onto the
stage of the annual talent show put on
by the black community, the audience
laughed, he said. But "we were good
and they liked us" in the end.
A number of seniors said the best
times of their Stanford years were spent
with Stanford programs abroad.
"The best time of my life was my time
in Florence," according to Palmer
Colamarino, co-chief announcer with X
TV, the student channel at Stanford. "I
just really fell in love with the Italian cul
ture and the Italian people. 1 made tre
mendous friends there," he said.
Jsa Pineda, an RA at the French house
who went to France with the Stanford
in-Paris program, said that one of her fa
vorite memories was when she and a
friend would "run into the Latin Quarter
and order Chinese food."
Todd Olson, manager for the Stanford
Band this year, said that many of his fa
vorite memories revolve around his ex
perience with the Band. "A key high
point was my first rally in the City fresh
man year," Olson said.
The climax of his experiences came
later, however, when the Band traveled
to Japan to cheer on the football team's
victory in the Coca-Cola Bowl."The
Japanese crowds went wild. They were
totally into it,"he said.
