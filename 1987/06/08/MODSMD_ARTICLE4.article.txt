Lectures without exams. Stuff
student dreams are made of.
Three well-known Stanford
teachers will give their "final"
lectures to graduating students
Saturday at the Class Day
luncheon at Bowman Grove. The
luncheon Is scheduled for 11 a.m.
to 1 p.m.
The speakers, chosen by the
graduating class, are Psychiatry
Prof. Herant Katchadourlan, En
glish Prof. Diane Middlebrook and
James Steyer, a lecturer In politi
cal science.
A psychiatrist and member of
the Program on Human Biology,
Katchadourlan is perhaps best
known for famed Human Biology
course. "Human Sexuality." Since
its inception in 1968, over 10,000
students have sampled Katcha
dourian's integrated approach to
the biological, behavioral and cul
tural aspects of human sexuality.

"l don't know anything about
it," was Katchadourian's initial
response to administrators who
brought the idea to him in 1966.
But according to Katchadourlan,
colleagues jokingly reassured him
that "ignorance of a subject has
never stopped a professor from
teaching before."
University President Donald
Kennedy has called Middlebrook
"a great teacher in every sense."
An accomplished literary

scholar, critic and poet, Mid
dlebrook has been a recipient of
the Dean's teaching Award and
has served as associate dean and
acting dean of undergraduate
studies.
Steyer currently teaches "Civil
Rights and Civil Liberties," a
popular and controversial political
science course that drew approxi
mately 300 students this quarter.
Members of the class were
startled on May 6 when Steyer an

nounced that participants In a
class softball tournament had to
sign a waiver consenting to NCAA
style random drug testing. Several
students objected to the testing,
and Steyer eventually admitted
that the announcement was de
signed to make students think
about privacy issues and no test
ing was actually planned.
Steyer is a practicing attorney
for the NAACP Legal Defense
Fund.
