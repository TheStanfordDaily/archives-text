# Tip O'Neill will address the graduating class
## 
### STEPHEN KASIERSKI Senior staff writer 
"I began my public life In 1936 on
a slogan of 'Work and wages.' I
remain convinced that our
greatest goal Is to give the average
family the opportunity to earn an
Income, to own a home, to educate
their children and to have some
security In their later years. That
Is still the American dream and It
Is still worth fighting for."
- address at Kansas State
University, April 22, 1985
He Is a cartoonist's dream.
An Imposing physique, a
prominent bulbous nose and
rumpled white hair.
The perfect stereotype of an old
fashioned ward politician.
And he's still called "Mr.
• Speaker."
With a political career spanning
50 years, Thomas P. "Tip" O'Neill
Jr. should have little difficulty
recalling anecdotes to spice his
speeches. The recently retired
speaker of the U.S. House of Rep
resentatives is the featured
speaker at Stanford's 96th Com
mencement on Sunday.
While holding the speaker's po
sition for 10 years, the longest
continuous tenure in the history
of the office, O'Neill became a
unique figure in modern Ameri
can politics. Polls of Washington
insiders repeatedly rated him the
second most influential U.S.
politician behind President
Reagan.
To conservative and Republican
critics, the Massachusetts Demo
crat was a symbol of big
government liberalism, dwarfed
even his own leviathan figure.
Supporters admired his reputa
tion as a strong defender of liberal
policies in a period marked by a
conservative swing that threat
ened to topple Democratic control
of Congress.
Intensely partisan by his own
admission, O'Neill was probably
the only person in Washington ca
pable of affably exchanging favor
ite Irish Jokes with Reagan as
easily as he could deliver scathing
criticism of the Chief Executive.
The Speaker is also a long-time
. golfing buddy of Republican
Minority Leader Bob Michel and
former President Gerald Ford.
Yet O'Neill never really fit the
mold of the newer breed of slick
politicians who propelled them
selves to the Capitol Hill spotlight.
At the end of the 99th Congress,

he had served In the Massachu
setts delegation for a remarkable
35 years. During this time, O'Neill
both witnessed and took part In
changing the style of the speaker's
position from a closed-door coali
tion builder to a media celebrity
and party spokesman.
When Ronald Reagan defeated
Jimmy Carter In 1980, O'Neill
emerged as the only visible Demo
cratic officeholder left at the na
tional level. With partisan vigor
reminiscent of his days In the
Massachusetts Legislature 50
years ago. he used his position as
the senior party spokesman to
mobilize opposition first to several
Reagan foreign policy Inlatlves
and later to administration eco
nomic and social welfare In
itiatives.
Adhering to his favorite political
maxim, "All politics is local,"
O'Neill's rise to the speakership
began in the ethnic wards of Bos
ton and Cambridge.
O'Neill was born in Cambridge
on Dec. 9. 1912. His father was a
bricklayer who once picketed Har
vard for hiring non-union con
struction workers. As a boy,
O'Neill cut the grass In Harvard
Yard for pocket money.

While a senior at Boston College
In 1936, O'Neill was defeated by
150 votes In his first attempt at
elected office, a seat on the
Cambridge City Council. That was
the only electoral loss of his politi
cal career.
The next fall he won a seat In
the state legislature, remaining
there for 16 years while running
an Insurance agency on the side.
In 1947 he became minority
leader, and in the following year
Democrats wrested a majority in
the house for the first time in 100
years. O'Neill was elected speaker,
and he quickly became famous for
his firm control of the chamber,
passing a series of social legisla
tion that was referred to as "the
Little New Deal."
In 1951, John F. Kennedy, a
young congressman from Massa
chusetts' Bth Congressional Dis
trict, told O'Neill privately that he
would be giving up his House seat
to run for the Senate. After care
fully expanding his political base
to include all of the district, O'Neill
won the 1952 election to replace
Kennedy with 69 percent of the
popular vote. In 18 subsequent
district elections, not one of
O'Neill's opponents was able to

garner more than 30 percent of
the vote.
As a freshman congressman,
O'Neill developed an almost father
son relationship with John
McCormack, the senior member of
the Massachusetts delegation who
later became speaker. O'Neill has
called his apprenticeship under
McCormack, "the greatest break 1
ever had."
In Congress, O'Neill joined the
Public Works Committee to
ensure that Massachusetts would
get a share of federal Jobs and proj
ects, but after the Democrats
reclaimed a majority in 1954, he
was named to the powerful Rules
Committee by Speaker Sam
Rayburn of Texas.
O'Neill has told a story of
meeting with Rayburn: "He
says. . .you know what loyalty is. I
says that's right. He says. . .1
would expect you to get votes for
me. 1 say that's party loyalty. He
says you're going on the Rules
Committee."
Throughout the '60s O'Neill was
viewed more as a loyal party regu
lar than a potential House leader,
but the favors he could bestow
from his position on the Rules
Committee won him friends and
future supporters.
O'Neill began to assert himself
by the middle qf the decade. In late
1967. supposedly inspired by the
sentiments of his children, he
broke with President Lyndon
Johnson and came out publicly
against the Vietnam War — a
move which pleased younger
House liberals and thousands of
students In his district.
Three years later, O'Neill broke
with the House establishment and
helped sponsor the Legislative Re
organization Act of 1970, which
allowed recorded floor votes on
amendments for the first time. Al
though he was not the original
proposer, O'Neill gave the reforms
credibility among the more tradi
tional members and helped his
own image as a machine Demo
crat with a penchant for reforms.
He was appointed Democratic
Whip in 1971 and was elected to
House Majority Leader a year later.
When Speaker Carl Albert of Okla
homa retired In 1976, Democrats
gave him the post by acclamation.
O'Neill started quickly by help
ing to push through the House a
tough ethics code and an energy
conservation package, but the
Democratic leadership could no
longer count on moderate
Republicans to vote with them to
make up for defections by conser

vatlve Democrats, and O'Neill was
stung by Republican victories on
crucial decisions despite nearly a
2-to-l partisan Democrat
majority.
But the election of President
Reagan In 1980 effectively ended
most of the problems of party
unity, and O'Neill could Instead
concentrate on solidifying opposi
tion to the MX mlssle. Central
American policy and Social Secur
ity and welfare cutbacks.
And O'Neill, always loyal to his
friends and supporters, never for
got his political base. His precinct
walks through Boston and
Cambridge became legendary, and
he wasn't afraid to make sure that
his district received favorable
treatment from Congress.
In 1978, for example, Congress
approved a new granlte-and-glass
federal office building In Boston's
North Station. Although some saw
It as a needed renovation that
helped brighten a blighted zone,
critics called It, "Tip's Tower" a
monument to pork-barrel politics.
Since his retirement from the
House, O'Neill has embarked on a
busy schedule of speaking engage
ments. He reportedly supplements
his <83,000 federal pension with
an agency contract to deliver six
speeches a year at >20,000 per ap
pearance. However, the Stanford
address carries no honorarium.
O'Neill also continues to serve
on the board of trustees of his
alma mater. Boston College. He
has been a member of the board
since 1972.
Following his retirement, O'Neill
signed a lucrative *1.5 million
deal with Random House for an
autobiography. The book will be
co-written with William Novak,
who also co-wrote Lee lacocca's
autobiography.
Although Washington Insiders
look forward to his candid views
on such topics as the workings on
Capitol Hill, O'Neill has already
answered one of the more vexing
questions — how he got the name
"Tip."
O'Neill told C-SPAN — the cable
television network he created
largely by himself to provide live
coverage of House debate — that
the origins of "Tip" go back to Ed
ward O'Neill, a member of the St.
Louis Browns during the 1888
baseball season.
"That was the only year in
baseball," O'Neill recalled, "that a
base-on-balls counted as a base
hit. He would get up and foul them
off until he got a base-on-balls.
The Irish loved him!"

mobilize opposition first to several
Reagan foreign policy Inlatlves
and later to administration eco
nomic and social welfare In
itiatives.
Adhering to his favorite political
maxim, "All politics is local,"
O'Neill's rise to the speakership
began in the ethnic wards of Bos
ton and Cambridge.
O'Neill was born in Cambridge
on Dec. 9. 1912. His father was a
bricklayer who once picketed Har
vard for hiring non-union con
struction workers. As a boy,
O'Neill cut the grass In Harvard
Yard for pocket money.

While a senior at Boston College
In 1936, O'Neill was defeated by
150 votes In his first attempt at
elected office, a seat on the
Cambridge City Council. That was
the only electoral loss of his politi
cal career.
The next fall he won a seat In
the state legislature, remaining
there for 16 years while running
an Insurance agency on the side.
In 1947 he became minority
leader, and in the following year
Democrats wrested a majority in
the house for the first time in 100
years. O'Neill was elected speaker,
and he quickly became famous for
his firm control of the chamber,
passing a series of social legisla
tion that was referred to as "the
Little New Deal."
In 1951, John F. Kennedy, a
young congressman from Massa
chusetts' Bth Congressional Dis
trict, told O'Neill privately that he
would be giving up his House seat
to run for the Senate. After care
fully expanding his political base
to include all of the district, O'Neill
won the 1952 election to replace
Kennedy with 69 percent of the
popular vote. In 18 subsequent
district elections, not one of
O'Neill's opponents was able to

garner more than 30 percent of
the vote.
As a freshman congressman,
O'Neill developed an almost father
son relationship with John
McCormack, the senior member of
the Massachusetts delegation who
later became speaker. O'Neill has
called his apprenticeship under
McCormack, "the greatest break 1
ever had."
In Congress, O'Neill joined the
Public Works Committee to
ensure that Massachusetts would
get a share of federal Jobs and proj
ects, but after the Democrats
reclaimed a majority in 1954, he
was named to the powerful Rules
Committee by Speaker Sam
Rayburn of Texas.
O'Neill has told a story of
meeting with Rayburn: "He
says. . .you know what loyalty is. I
says that's right. He says. . .1
would expect you to get votes for
me. 1 say that's party loyalty. He
says you're going on the Rules
Committee."
Throughout the '60s O'Neill was
viewed more as a loyal party regu
lar than a potential House leader,
but the favors he could bestow
from his position on the Rules
Committee won him friends and
future supporters.
O'Neill began to assert himself
by the middle qf the decade. In late
1967. supposedly inspired by the
sentiments of his children, he
broke with President Lyndon
Johnson and came out publicly
against the Vietnam War — a
move which pleased younger
House liberals and thousands of
students In his district.
Three years later, O'Neill broke
with the House establishment and
helped sponsor the Legislative Re
organization Act of 1970, which
allowed recorded floor votes on
amendments for the first time. Al
though he was not the original
proposer, O'Neill gave the reforms
credibility among the more tradi
tional members and helped his
own image as a machine Demo
crat with a penchant for reforms.
He was appointed Democratic
Whip in 1971 and was elected to
House Majority Leader a year later.
When Speaker Carl Albert of Okla
homa retired In 1976, Democrats
gave him the post by acclamation.
O'Neill started quickly by help
ing to push through the House a
tough ethics code and an energy
conservation package, but the
Democratic leadership could no
longer count on moderate
Republicans to vote with them to
make up for defections by conser

vatlve Democrats, and O'Neill was
stung by Republican victories on
crucial decisions despite nearly a
2-to-l partisan Democrat
majority.
But the election of President
Reagan In 1980 effectively ended
most of the problems of party
unity, and O'Neill could Instead
concentrate on solidifying opposi
tion to the MX mlssle. Central
American policy and Social Secur
ity and welfare cutbacks.
And O'Neill, always loyal to his
friends and supporters, never for
got his political base. His precinct
walks through Boston and
Cambridge became legendary, and
he wasn't afraid to make sure that
his district received favorable
treatment from Congress.
In 1978, for example, Congress
approved a new granlte-and-glass
federal office building In Boston's
North Station. Although some saw
It as a needed renovation that
helped brighten a blighted zone,
critics called It, "Tip's Tower" a
monument to pork-barrel politics.
Since his retirement from the
House, O'Neill has embarked on a
busy schedule of speaking engage
ments. He reportedly supplements
his <83,000 federal pension with
an agency contract to deliver six
speeches a year at >20,000 per ap
pearance. However, the Stanford
address carries no honorarium.
O'Neill also continues to serve
on the board of trustees of his
alma mater. Boston College. He
has been a member of the board
since 1972.
Following his retirement, O'Neill
signed a lucrative *1.5 million
deal with Random House for an
autobiography. The book will be
co-written with William Novak,
who also co-wrote Lee lacocca's
autobiography.
Although Washington Insiders
look forward to his candid views
on such topics as the workings on
Capitol Hill, O'Neill has already
answered one of the more vexing
questions — how he got the name
"Tip."
O'Neill told C-SPAN — the cable
television network he created
largely by himself to provide live
coverage of House debate — that
the origins of "Tip" go back to Ed
ward O'Neill, a member of the St.
Louis Browns during the 1888
baseball season.
"That was the only year in
baseball," O'Neill recalled, "that a
base-on-balls counted as a base
hit. He would get up and foul them
off until he got a base-on-balls.
The Irish loved him!"

Former Speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives Tip O'Neill will
give the keynote address at the 96th Commencement ceremonies for
the Class of 1987.
"I began my public life In 1936 on
a slogan of 'Work and wages.' I
remain convinced that our
greatest goal Is to give the average
family the opportunity to earn an
Income, to own a home, to educate
their children and to have some
security In their later years. That
Is still the American dream and It
Is still worth fighting for."
- address at Kansas State
University, April 22, 1985
He Is a cartoonist's dream.
An Imposing physique, a
prominent bulbous nose and
rumpled white hair.
The perfect stereotype of an old
fashioned ward politician.
And he's still called "Mr.
• Speaker."
With a political career spanning
50 years, Thomas P. "Tip" O'Neill
Jr. should have little difficulty
recalling anecdotes to spice his
speeches. The recently retired
speaker of the U.S. House of Rep
resentatives is the featured
speaker at Stanford's 96th Com
mencement on Sunday.
While holding the speaker's po
sition for 10 years, the longest
continuous tenure in the history
of the office, O'Neill became a
unique figure in modern Ameri
can politics. Polls of Washington
insiders repeatedly rated him the
second most influential U.S.
politician behind President
Reagan.
To conservative and Republican
critics, the Massachusetts Demo
crat was a symbol of big
government liberalism, dwarfed
even his own leviathan figure.
Supporters admired his reputa
tion as a strong defender of liberal
policies in a period marked by a
conservative swing that threat
ened to topple Democratic control
of Congress.
Intensely partisan by his own
admission, O'Neill was probably
the only person in Washington ca
pable of affably exchanging favor
ite Irish Jokes with Reagan as
easily as he could deliver scathing
criticism of the Chief Executive.
The Speaker is also a long-time
. golfing buddy of Republican
Minority Leader Bob Michel and
former President Gerald Ford.
Yet O'Neill never really fit the
mold of the newer breed of slick
politicians who propelled them
selves to the Capitol Hill spotlight.
At the end of the 99th Congress,

he had served In the Massachu
setts delegation for a remarkable
35 years. During this time, O'Neill
both witnessed and took part In
changing the style of the speaker's
position from a closed-door coali
tion builder to a media celebrity
and party spokesman.
When Ronald Reagan defeated
Jimmy Carter In 1980, O'Neill
emerged as the only visible Demo
cratic officeholder left at the na
tional level. With partisan vigor
reminiscent of his days In the
Massachusetts Legislature 50
years ago. he used his position as

Throughout the '60s O'Neill was
viewed more as a loyal party regu
lar than a potential House leader,
but the favors he could bestow
from his position on the Rules
Committee won him friends and
future supporters.
O'Neill began to assert himself
by the middle qf the decade. In late
1967. supposedly inspired by the
sentiments of his children, he
broke with President Lyndon
Johnson and came out publicly
against the Vietnam War — a
move which pleased younger
House liberals and thousands of
students In his district.
Three years later, O'Neill broke
with the House establishment and
helped sponsor the Legislative Re
organization Act of 1970, which
allowed recorded floor votes on
amendments for the first time. Al
though he was not the original
proposer, O'Neill gave the reforms
credibility among the more tradi
tional members and helped his
own image as a machine Demo
crat with a penchant for reforms.
He was appointed Democratic
Whip in 1971 and was elected to
House Majority Leader a year later.
When Speaker Carl Albert of Okla
homa retired In 1976, Democrats
gave him the post by acclamation.
O'Neill started quickly by help
ing to push through the House a
tough ethics code and an energy
conservation package, but the
Democratic leadership could no
longer count on moderate
Republicans to vote with them to
make up for defections by conser

vatlve Democrats, and O'Neill was
stung by Republican victories on
crucial decisions despite nearly a
2-to-l partisan Democrat
majority.
But the election of President
Reagan In 1980 effectively ended
most of the problems of party
unity, and O'Neill could Instead
concentrate on solidifying opposi
tion to the MX mlssle. Central
American policy and Social Secur
ity and welfare cutbacks.
And O'Neill, always loyal to his
friends and supporters, never for
got his political base. His precinct
walks through Boston and
Cambridge became legendary, and
he wasn't afraid to make sure that
his district received favorable
treatment from Congress.
In 1978, for example, Congress
approved a new granlte-and-glass
federal office building In Boston's
North Station. Although some saw
It as a needed renovation that
helped brighten a blighted zone,
critics called It, "Tip's Tower" a
monument to pork-barrel politics.
Since his retirement from the
House, O'Neill has embarked on a
busy schedule of speaking engage
ments. He reportedly supplements
his <83,000 federal pension with
an agency contract to deliver six
speeches a year at >20,000 per ap
pearance. However, the Stanford
address carries no honorarium.
O'Neill also continues to serve
on the board of trustees of his
alma mater. Boston College. He
has been a member of the board
since 1972.
Following his retirement, O'Neill
signed a lucrative *1.5 million
deal with Random House for an
autobiography. The book will be
co-written with William Novak,
who also co-wrote Lee lacocca's
autobiography.
Although Washington Insiders
look forward to his candid views
on such topics as the workings on
Capitol Hill, O'Neill has already
answered one of the more vexing
questions — how he got the name
"Tip."
O'Neill told C-SPAN — the cable
television network he created
largely by himself to provide live
coverage of House debate — that
the origins of "Tip" go back to Ed
ward O'Neill, a member of the St.
Louis Browns during the 1888
baseball season.
"That was the only year in
baseball," O'Neill recalled, "that a
base-on-balls counted as a base
hit. He would get up and foul them
off until he got a base-on-balls.
The Irish loved him!"
