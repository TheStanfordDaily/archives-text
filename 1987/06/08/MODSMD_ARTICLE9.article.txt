The history of the University's Com
mencement exercises may serve no real pur
pose other than being great material for a
Stanford trivia bowl. But what's the differ
ence? Go ahead â€” read on and bone up on
the University's Commencement history. . .
Where were most Commencements held
prior to 1938? Clue: Its small size became
a problem as enrollment grew.
Memorial Church. From 1938 until 1983
Stanford held Commencement in Frost Am
phitheater; in 1984, the ceremony was held
at Sunken Diamond, and since 1985 it has
been held at Stanford Stadium.
Where was the first Commencement held?
Roble Gym. According to Fred Glover,
Class of '33 and former executive assistant
to the University president, evergreens and
flowers decorated what was then a tempo
rary frame building.
Who was the speaker In 1935, when Com
mencement was held In the Stadium?
Clue: He was a member of the first class
that graduated from Stanford, and his
wife - also a Stanford grad - was named
Lou Henry. While a student here, this
speaker forgot to bring the football to the
first Big Game.
Former U.S. President Herbert Hoover.
Former Prof. Harold Bacon, Class of '28,
Commencement marshal from 1934-72 and
50-year resident of the white house with the
roses next to the Betas, estimated that
more than 15,000 attended the Hoover

speech in the 90.000 capacity arena. "A lot
left," he said, after Hoover gave his speech.
According to Donald Winbigler. former
registrar, academic secretary and dean of
students for 17 years. "It was a very good
talk. It was brief and to the point." Inciden
tally. Winbigler attended every Commence
ment from 1940-1975.
In the late '70s and early '80s, there was
always a chronic shortage of Commence
ment tickets. Why was the University so re
luctant to hold Commencement exercises
In the Stadium?
University officials maintained the
Stadium's atmosphere was wrong for Com
mencement. "It was too big a place," Bacon
said. Frost Amphitheater, on the other
hand, was loved by faculty and students
alike; Bacon called It the "ideal place."
In 1984. however, officials relented and
decided to try Sunken Diamond as a Com
mencement site. When that was deemed too
small as well, some faculty and students
considered holding the ceremony in the
Oval. Eventually, though, Stanford
Stadium got the nod because of its virtually
unlimited capacity.
By the way, the Graduate School of Busi
ness holds its ceremony in Frost.
How difficult was It to obtain Commence
ment tickets bejore the move to the
Stadium?
Very difficult, according to Bacon.
