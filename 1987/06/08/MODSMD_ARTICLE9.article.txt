The history of the University's Com
mencement exercises may serve no real pur
pose other than being great material for a
Stanford trivia bowl. But what's the differ
ence? Go ahead — read on and bone up on
the University's Commencement history. . .
Where were most Commencements held
prior to 1938? Clue: Its small size became
a problem as enrollment grew.
Memorial Church. From 1938 until 1983
Stanford held Commencement in Frost Am
phitheater; in 1984, the ceremony was held
at Sunken Diamond, and since 1985 it has
been held at Stanford Stadium.
Where was the first Commencement held?
Roble Gym. According to Fred Glover,
Class of '33 and former executive assistant
to the University president, evergreens and
flowers decorated what was then a tempo
rary frame building.
Who was the speaker In 1935, when Com
mencement was held In the Stadium?
Clue: He was a member of the first class
that graduated from Stanford, and his
wife - also a Stanford grad - was named
Lou Henry. While a student here, this
speaker forgot to bring the football to the
first Big Game.
Former U.S. President Herbert Hoover.
Former Prof. Harold Bacon, Class of '28,
Commencement marshal from 1934-72 and
50-year resident of the white house with the
roses next to the Betas, estimated that
more than 15,000 attended the Hoover

speech in the 90.000 capacity arena. "A lot
left," he said, after Hoover gave his speech.
According to Donald Winbigler. former
registrar, academic secretary and dean of
students for 17 years. "It was a very good
talk. It was brief and to the point." Inciden
tally. Winbigler attended every Commence
ment from 1940-1975.
In the late '70s and early '80s, there was
always a chronic shortage of Commence
ment tickets. Why was the University so re
luctant to hold Commencement exercises
In the Stadium?
University officials maintained the
Stadium's atmosphere was wrong for Com
mencement. "It was too big a place," Bacon
said. Frost Amphitheater, on the other
hand, was loved by faculty and students
alike; Bacon called It the "ideal place."
In 1984. however, officials relented and
decided to try Sunken Diamond as a Com
mencement site. When that was deemed too
small as well, some faculty and students
considered holding the ceremony in the
Oval. Eventually, though, Stanford
Stadium got the nod because of its virtually
unlimited capacity.
By the way, the Graduate School of Busi
ness holds its ceremony in Frost.
How difficult was It to obtain Commence
ment tickets bejore the move to the
Stadium?
Very difficult, according to Bacon.
Thousands of ticket requests were
routinely denied each year.
Has Commencement ever been
rained out?
Amazingly, It never has.
Have students always received
their diplomas at department
ceremonies?
No. Up until about 12 years ago
— during Richard Lyman's
presidency — the University presi
dent awarded the diplomas in the
large ceremony. But the ceremony
grew too long.
Historical Society President Ray
Lyman Wilbur Jr., Class of '33 and
son of third University President
Wilbur (1916-43), said his father
spoke at every Commencement
and personally gave every graduat
ing student his diploma.
According to Eric Hutchinson, a
chemistry professor here for 36
years, the ceremony became cum
bersome. "We all fried in Frost Am
phitheater," he said. "The present
arrangement is much better. It no
longer looks like an assembly line.
We have more intimate
ceremonies."
He added, "there were many
mistakes In the old days." For ex
ample, students occasionally
received the wrong diplomas.
"People were swapping them
around," Hutchinson said.
The registrar and the academic
secretary gave the diplomas to the
University president. For many
years students told their names —
or sometimes fictitious names —
to "readers." As a result, the name
of Warren G. Wonka, a fictitious
campus mischief-maker similar to
World War ll's Kilroy, was called
one Commencement.

Has the University ever enforced
a strict time limit on speeches?
No. But someone once gave an
hour-long speech. Former mar
shal Bacon — whose father was a
member of the Class of '02 — said.
"I won't say who."
Did professors and students al
ways wear robes at Commence
ment?
No. According to Gover, the
entire class did not wear caps and
gowns until 1906. Students ap
parently considered the custom
"medieval." In 1899 a female stu
dent started the cap and gown
movement, ordering herself and
other women caps and gowns.
Where was Commencement held
1906-14. when the earthquake
damaged Mem Chu?
Blrge Clark, Class of '14, said
his Commencement was held In
the Auditorium (also called the As
sembly Hall) which currently
houses the Communications De
partment and formerly housed the
Business School. A Class picture
was taken In the Inner Quad,
however, which has led some to
think Commencement was held In
the Quad.
Glover added that in 1906 the
University deferred Commence
ment until September 15.
Has a live band always provided
the music for the ceremony?
No. Prior to 1906, organ music
was used. Before the late '40s, or
gan music was piped into the Am
phitheater from Mem Chu. Then
after Music Prof. Herber Nanney
came here as University organist
In 1947, he played a rented
electric organ in the Amphithea
ter. "They decided it was easier if I
had eyeball contact," he said.

How did The Dally treat Com
mencement?
Well, In 1941 — back when a
year's tuition was a whopping
•345 — The Dally printed the
names of everyone who graduated
with distinction. That same year
class orators — along with Univer
sity President John Branner —
gave speeches at Commencement.
Back then The Dally printed the
full text of the main speech, ap
parently always given by a top Uni
versity official. In the Commence
ment Issues.
Who designed the Commence
ment flags?
Eric Hutchinson, a chemistry
professor here for 36 years, de
signed them.
The banners used In the
Stadium to cover up the empty
seats on the east side of the
Stadium are emblazoned with the
University's Centennial logo.
Have most Commencement
speakers been political figures?
Contrary to recent popular
belief, the majority of Commence
ment speakers are not political fig
ures. University presidents (both
of Stanford and of other univer
sities), particularly Wilbur, have
been the most "prolific" speakers.
Other speakers have included a
secretary of Housing and Urban
Development, a former secretary
of Labor and a UC-Berkeley chan
cellor. Last year "Nightllne"
anchorman Ted Koppel, a Stan
ford graduate, gave the Com
mencement address.
Political speakers have included
Watergate Special Prosecutor
Archibald Cox in 1974 (three
months before President Richard
Nixon resigned), U.N. Ambassador
Daniel Patrick Moynihan in 1975,

U.N. Ambassador Andrew Young
In 1979, Deputy Secretary of State
Warren Christopher in 1981, Su
preme Court Justice Sandra Day
O'Connor In 1982, Secretary of
State George Sc'.ultz in 1983 and
New York Governor Mario Cuomo
in 1984.
And the speeches have not al
ways been serious. In 1967, John
Fischer, editor In chief of Harper's
magazine. Included In his "four
choices" for graduating students
"dropping out" and "trying to
change the world gradually."
Are disruptions common?
The silent protestors in 1983
were not the first to "disrupt" the
generally sedate — except for the
champagne — Commencement
exercises. Bacon said minor dis
tractions are the rule: "There
usually was a dog in Frost Amphi
theater that would dash across
the stage."
When the conservative
Moynihan spoke In 1975, many
walked out to protest his selection
as U.N. Ambassador.
Has the Commencement speaker
selection process changed?
According to Glover, who should
know, yes. Student involvement
did not really begin until the late
'60s. "This long selection process
is in the last 15 years," he said.
Student committees are relatively
new.
Has the Band always rushed up
on stage after the ceremony?
No. It remains to be seen if this
event — which has only happened
a few times, according to Music
Prof. Art Barnes — will become yet
another in a long line of Stanford
Commencement traditions.

campus mischief-maker similar to
World War ll's Kilroy, was called
one Commencement.

Has the University ever enforced
a strict time limit on speeches?
No. But someone once gave an
hour-long speech. Former mar
shal Bacon — whose father was a
member of the Class of '02 — said.
"I won't say who."
Did professors and students al
ways wear robes at Commence
ment?
No. According to Gover, the
entire class did not wear caps and
gowns until 1906. Students ap
parently considered the custom
"medieval." In 1899 a female stu
dent started the cap and gown
movement, ordering herself and
other women caps and gowns.
Where was Commencement held
1906-14. when the earthquake
damaged Mem Chu?
Blrge Clark, Class of '14, said
his Commencement was held In
the Auditorium (also called the As
sembly Hall) which currently
houses the Communications De
partment and formerly housed the
Business School. A Class picture
was taken In the Inner Quad,
however, which has led some to
think Commencement was held In
the Quad.
Glover added that in 1906 the
University deferred Commence
ment until September 15.
Has a live band always provided
the music for the ceremony?
No. Prior to 1906, organ music
was used. Before the late '40s, or
gan music was piped into the Am
phitheater from Mem Chu. Then
after Music Prof. Herber Nanney
came here as University organist
In 1947, he played a rented
electric organ in the Amphithea
ter. "They decided it was easier if I
had eyeball contact," he said.

How did The Dally treat Com
mencement?
Well, In 1941 — back when a
year's tuition was a whopping
•345 — The Dally printed the
names of everyone who graduated
with distinction. That same year
class orators — along with Univer
sity President John Branner —
gave speeches at Commencement.
Back then The Dally printed the
full text of the main speech, ap
parently always given by a top Uni
versity official. In the Commence
ment Issues.
Who designed the Commence
ment flags?
Eric Hutchinson, a chemistry
professor here for 36 years, de
signed them.
The banners used In the
Stadium to cover up the empty
seats on the east side of the
Stadium are emblazoned with the
University's Centennial logo.
Have most Commencement
speakers been political figures?
Contrary to recent popular
belief, the majority of Commence
ment speakers are not political fig
ures. University presidents (both
of Stanford and of other univer
sities), particularly Wilbur, have
been the most "prolific" speakers.
Other speakers have included a
secretary of Housing and Urban
Development, a former secretary
of Labor and a UC-Berkeley chan
cellor. Last year "Nightllne"
anchorman Ted Koppel, a Stan
ford graduate, gave the Com
mencement address.
Political speakers have included
Watergate Special Prosecutor
Archibald Cox in 1974 (three
months before President Richard
Nixon resigned), U.N. Ambassador
Daniel Patrick Moynihan in 1975,

U.N. Ambassador Andrew Young
In 1979, Deputy Secretary of State
Warren Christopher in 1981, Su
preme Court Justice Sandra Day
O'Connor In 1982, Secretary of
State George Sc'.ultz in 1983 and
New York Governor Mario Cuomo
in 1984.
And the speeches have not al
ways been serious. In 1967, John
Fischer, editor In chief of Harper's
magazine. Included In his "four
choices" for graduating students
"dropping out" and "trying to
change the world gradually."
Are disruptions common?
The silent protestors in 1983
were not the first to "disrupt" the
generally sedate — except for the
champagne — Commencement
exercises. Bacon said minor dis
tractions are the rule: "There
usually was a dog in Frost Amphi
theater that would dash across
the stage."
When the conservative
Moynihan spoke In 1975, many
walked out to protest his selection
as U.N. Ambassador.
Has the Commencement speaker
selection process changed?
According to Glover, who should
know, yes. Student involvement
did not really begin until the late
'60s. "This long selection process
is in the last 15 years," he said.
Student committees are relatively
new.
Has the Band always rushed up
on stage after the ceremony?
No. It remains to be seen if this
event — which has only happened
a few times, according to Music
Prof. Art Barnes — will become yet
another in a long line of Stanford
Commencement traditions.

A graduate takes a quiet moment to reflect on her four years on the
Farm.
The history of the University's Com
mencement exercises may serve no real pur
pose other than being great material for a
Stanford trivia bowl. But what's the differ
ence? Go ahead — read on and bone up on
the University's Commencement history. . .
Where were most Commencements held
prior to 1938? Clue: Its small size became
a problem as enrollment grew.
Memorial Church. From 1938 until 1983
Stanford held Commencement in Frost Am
phitheater; in 1984, the ceremony was held
at Sunken Diamond, and since 1985 it has
been held at Stanford Stadium.
Where was the first Commencement held?
Roble Gym. According to Fred Glover,
Class of '33 and former executive assistant
to the University president, evergreens and
flowers decorated what was then a tempo
rary frame building.
Who was the speaker In 1935, when Com
mencement was held In the Stadium?
Clue: He was a member of the first class
that graduated from Stanford, and his
wife - also a Stanford grad - was named
Lou Henry. While a student here, this
speaker forgot to bring the football to the
first Big Game.
Former U.S. President Herbert Hoover.
Former Prof. Harold Bacon, Class of '28,
Commencement marshal from 1934-72 and
50-year resident of the white house with the
roses next to the Betas, estimated that
more than 15,000 attended the Hoover

speech in the 90.000 capacity arena. "A lot
left," he said, after Hoover gave his speech.
According to Donald Winbigler. former
registrar, academic secretary and dean of
students for 17 years. "It was a very good
talk. It was brief and to the point." Inciden
tally. Winbigler attended every Commence
ment from 1940-1975.
In the late '70s and early '80s, there was
always a chronic shortage of Commence
ment tickets. Why was the University so re
luctant to hold Commencement exercises
In the Stadium?
University officials maintained the
Stadium's atmosphere was wrong for Com
mencement. "It was too big a place," Bacon
said. Frost Amphitheater, on the other
hand, was loved by faculty and students
alike; Bacon called It the "ideal place."
In 1984. however, officials relented and
decided to try Sunken Diamond as a Com
mencement site. When that was deemed too
small as well, some faculty and students
considered holding the ceremony in the
Oval. Eventually, though, Stanford
Stadium got the nod because of its virtually
unlimited capacity.
By the way, the Graduate School of Busi
ness holds its ceremony in Frost.
How difficult was It to obtain Commence
ment tickets bejore the move to the
Stadium?
Very difficult, according to Bacon.
Thousands of ticket requests were
routinely denied each year.
Has Commencement ever been
rained out?
Amazingly, It never has.
Have students always received
their diplomas at department
ceremonies?
No. Up until about 12 years ago
— during Richard Lyman's
presidency — the University presi
dent awarded the diplomas in the
large ceremony. But the ceremony
grew too long.
Historical Society President Ray
Lyman Wilbur Jr., Class of '33 and
son of third University President
Wilbur (1916-43), said his father
spoke at every Commencement
and personally gave every graduat
ing student his diploma.
According to Eric Hutchinson, a
chemistry professor here for 36
years, the ceremony became cum
bersome. "We all fried in Frost Am
phitheater," he said. "The present
arrangement is much better. It no
longer looks like an assembly line.
We have more intimate
ceremonies."
He added, "there were many
mistakes In the old days." For ex
ample, students occasionally
received the wrong diplomas.
"People were swapping them
around," Hutchinson said.
The registrar and the academic
secretary gave the diplomas to the
University president. For many
years students told their names —
or sometimes fictitious names —
to "readers." As a result, the name
of Warren G. Wonka, a fictitious
campus mischief-maker similar to
World War ll's Kilroy, was called

Has the Commencement speaker
selection process changed?
According to Glover, who should
know, yes. Student involvement
did not really begin until the late
'60s. "This long selection process
is in the last 15 years," he said.
Student committees are relatively
new.
Has the Band always rushed up
on stage after the ceremony?
No. It remains to be seen if this
event — which has only happened
a few times, according to Music
Prof. Art Barnes — will become yet
another in a long line of Stanford
Commencement traditions.
