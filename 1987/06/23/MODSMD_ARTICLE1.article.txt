# Report urges Zete suspension
## Alcohol policy questioned 
### NANNETTE THOMPSON Staff writer 
A report investigating the drowning death of a
Stanford junior last quarter recommends that the
University revoke recognition of the Zeta Psi fra
ternity indefinitely, and that it more strictly en
force its alcohol policy.
The report, prepared by Assistant to the
Provost Michael Jackson, recommends that the
University "re-examine its alcohol policies with
particular consideration of issues relating to en
forcement and consequences to groups for non
compliance."
Junior David Dunshee drowned in Lake
Lagunita April 22 after leaving a Zete rush party
at the Boathouse. The Santa Clara County
coroner's office determined that intoxication was
a contributing factor in the drowning.
In the report, which was released June 10,
Jackson maintains that the Zetes showed a
"substantial disregard of Interfraternity Council
(IFC) policies and Boathouse rules and regula
tions" at their Boathouse rush party.
The report accuses the fraternity of several
rule infractions, including a failure to check
identification cards, serving alcohol past the
11:30 p.m. curfew and failing to appoint a sober
monitor for the party. The report also notes that
students at the party were consuming straight
shots of alcohol, a practice strictly prohibited by
IFC guidelines.
For the moment, Jackson's report is only a re-
commendation. Acting Dean of
Student Affairs Norm Robinson
will make a final decision on
whether or not the fraternity
will lose University recogni
tion. Robinson said yesterday
that he will examine the issue
over the next few weeks.
Robinson declined to spec
ulate on what his decision
would be. He said he would first
have to discuss the report with
Fraternal Affairs Adviser Joe
Pisano and Assistant Dean of
Residential Education Diana
Conklin. "I will ask Joe and
Diana to take the recommen
dations, review the history of
the Zetes and give me their
opinions on whether recogni
tion should be revoked," he

said.
Zete member Phil Klein
refused to comment on Jack
son's recommendations. "I plan
to meet with Mr. Jackson
[sometime this week or next
week] before I formulate any
opinions."
Jackson's report also recom
mends that the University re
examine enforcement of its al
cohol policy. According to the
report, the emphasis of such a
review would not be to change
existing University alcohol
policy, but rather to focus on
how to promote compliance.
"One sense I got out of the
report is that existing policies
are pretty good. If they had
been followed that night (of the
Zete rush party) there may
have been a different outcome,"
Conklin added.
Although campus police

stepped up patrol of University
parties following the drowning
and entered two fraternity par
ties to check the IDs of those
drinking alcohol, the Univer
sity has not yet said if enforce
ment in the fall will include
patroling social events.
"We will be looking at how
policy is enforced, see if enforce
ment is adequate, and if not,
beefing it up," Conklin said.
The findings would affect not
only fraternities but the Uni
versity as a whole, she said.
Robinson said he will prob
ably ask an individual or group
of people from the Dean of Stu
dent Affairs Office to make spe
cific recommendations to him
regarding "enforcement and
compliance with the policies."
One fraternity officer, who
asked not to be identified, ac
knowledged that strict enforce
ment of the alcohol policy will

force fraternites to comply "to
protect themselves."
He added, however, that "one
of our options is to make parties
closed not only to non-Stanford
people, but also closed to Stan
ford members under 21, which
encompasses a large percentage
of the student body. Because we
may be forced to do this, there
may be more of a perception
around campus that fraternities
are elitist," he said.
He also worries that stricter
enforcement could infringe on
people's freedom to make deci
sions for themselves.
"Part of the Stanford experi
ence is the freedom to choose.
The fraternity system is part of
the diversity of the university
system," he said.
"How much freedom do you
want to cut out to prevent iso
lated incidents, and will the
policy even be effective?"
