Two win Mac Arthur grants
Two newly appointed Stanford sci
entists have won Mac Arthur Fellow
ships worth approximately $250,000
over the next five years.
Biology Prof. Robert Sapolsky, a
neuroendocrinologist, and David
Rummelhart, a cognitive psycholo
gist who will come to Stanford this
summer from UC-San Diego, plan to
use the unrestricted money to do the
kind of research for which it is hard to
get normal funding.
Sapolsky studies baboons in
Kenya, as well as laboratory mice, in
his research on the effects of stress on
memory loss.
"I'm particularly interested in
whether a life-long history of stress
influences the normal brain cell
damage that occurs during the aging
process or as a result of a stroke and
seizure," Sapolsky said.

Rummelhart is attempting to build
computers that emulate the human
brain.
Most people see human intelligence
through the "computer metaphor,"
Rummelhart said.
"My idea was to try to replace the
computer metaphor with what we
called the 'brain metaphor' — to
characterize brain-style computation,
and then to formulate theories of pro
cessing that in a sense would relate
mind and brain," he said.
"The hallmark of human intelli
gence isn't logic, it's analogic. People
reason fundamentally analogically,"
he said.
Farber cleared of assault
Dr. Eugene Farber, emeritus pro
fessor of dermatology, was cleared
June 11 of charges that he sexually
assaulted a female patient during a
1984 medical exam.

In a seven-page ruling, Santa Clara
County Municipal court Judge
LaDoris Cordell dismissed the felony
charges, terming the woman's ac
cusation "neither credible nor
plausible."
Farber, who retired in 1985, was
accused by the 35-year-old Mountain
View woman of giving her a pelvic ex
amination and fondling her breasts
during an office visit for a foot ail
ment in November 1984.
Citing inconsistencies in the
woman's testimony and "an of
tentimes belligerent demeanor," Cor
dell concluded the woman was lying
or "her perceptions of reality are dis
torted. In either case, I do not find her
a credible witness, and I do not be
lieve her testimony."
Farber said afterwards he was
"very pleased that the unfounded
charges have been dismissed by the
court."
