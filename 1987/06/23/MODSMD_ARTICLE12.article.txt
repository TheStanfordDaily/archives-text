# Grads cut loose

### STEVE KASIERSKI Senior staff writer 
The weather was unusual
for a Stanford commence
ment. Thick clouds obscured
the sun, and sunglasses hung
idly from the necks of specta
tors and graduates.
The gray skies and cooler
temperatures seemed to con
tribute to a somewhat more
somber graduation ceremony
than in past years, yet spirits
gradually rose with the tem
perature as 4,081 graduates
and 25,000 friends and
relatives basked in sparkling
sunshine by the end of the
morning.
Despite ceremonial trap
pings that are relatively
standard to college gradua
tions, the Stanford com
mencement continues to
reflect the unique institu
tional character of the Uni
versity.
Many of the graduates
arrived at the stadium ramp
early to get a choice spot at
the front of the procession
and the best seats next to the
stage. The Commencement
crowd roared as the proces
sion circled the track at the

south side of the stadium.
After reaching their seats,
the graduates turned almost
immediately to the stands to
acknowledge the applause
and to try to pick out friends
and relatives in the packed
stands.
Stanford's newest alumni
sported a variety of clothing
in addition to the traditional
graduation garb of black
mortarboards and gowns.
Some of the more common
fashion accessories included
balloons, flower leis and
pocket cameras.
Many graduates turned
themselves into human bill
boards, with slogans such as
"Aloha," "All Right Now"
and "We Got Out" spelled in
masking tape on backs and
atop mortarboards.
Those in the front of the
procession had over 30
minutes to bask in the
limelight of the occasion as
classmates, faculty and dig
nitaries filed in after them.
While frisbees flew across the
field, four undergraduate
degree candidates paused for
an impromptu game of
Twister.
