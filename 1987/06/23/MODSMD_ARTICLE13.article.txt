## The
						Stanford Daily An Independent Newspaper Editor's welcome 
### 
We hope you have as much fun reading the newspaper as
we do putting it together for you." That was the concluding
sentence of my very first editor's welcome, written for Bijou
Elemetary School's mimeographed paper. The other fourth
graders and I had a lot of fun playing journalist — mostly be
cause we got to skip class.
Some things about the way journalism affects my life have
changed since then. I no longer "get" to skip class. The
resposibilities I have to the community are greater, and the
decisions — because they impact on people's lives — are
tougher.
But other things are the same. Working on The Daily is as
much fun as working on The Bijou Bee was. Friendship,
movie review passes and throwing records into the ceiling are
all part of The Daily experience. And The Daily provides a
place to learn about and examine important events and is
sues, which is a large part of the fun.
A lot of time in The Daily offices is spent trying to improve
the paper and discussing how stories should be covered. Two
departmental changes arising from these efforts will mark
this summer's Daily. The new Inside department will take a
closer look at Stanford, beginning with today's report on the
structure of undergraduate education and later tackling is
sues like AIDS and race relations on the Farm. The Enter
tainment department, too, has been expanded to better cover
the events that bring life into summer at Stanford.
Strong news coverage will continue to be The Daily's pri
mary focus, and two good columnists, Nick Anderson and
Gary Rosen, will contribute to the tradition of presenting a
politically lively Opinions page.
The Daily staffs periodic lapses into a fourth grade men
tality will continue, meaning that until the ceiling is
resurfaced with puncture-resistant tiles, records will be used
as Frisbees.
