Stand against SDI
Stanford Action for Nuclear
Disarmament (STAND) has
collected 500 signatures on a
petition asking Stanford scien
tists not to work on the Star
Wars weapon system.
We and the signatories hope
that faculty and graduate stu
dents will sign a pledge not to
accept Star Wars funding. This
pledge has been signed by over
6,500 of their colleagues —
including 15 Nobel laureates —
and is now circulating in 12
departments at Stanford.
Over $23 million in Star
Wars money has already been

given to Stanford researchers.
Their acceptance of funds is
evidence of their support for
Star Wars — whether or not
they intend this interpretation.
We encourage scientists to
speak out against the govern
ment's militarized funding
priorities, so that the majority
of them, who oppose Star Wars,
can work on projects for civil
ian applications without sup
porting the arms race, and
without fear of having their
work classified later.
The text of the petition
reads: "We, the undersigned
members of the Stanford com
munity, believe that the Stra

tegic Defense Initiative is a
technologically unfeasible and
economically ruinous mistake
that will not protect the Ameri
can people against nuclear war.
Rather, by abrogating the
ABM treaty and escalating the
arms race, it will leave us in a
less secure position than ever.
"We appeal to all Stanford
faculty and graduate students
in relevant fields to join the
thousands of researchers in
universities across the country
who have placed ethical con
cerns above financial pressures
and have pledged to refuse all
SDI contracts."
