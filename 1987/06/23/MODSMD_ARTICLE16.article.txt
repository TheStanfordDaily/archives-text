# Where West meets East: Reagan at the Wall
## 
### 
A few days ago, President Reagan spoke
at the Berlin Wall. The occasion was the
celebration of the 750 th anniversary of the
settlement of Berlin. Reagan was the last of
the three heads of state of the western oc
cupying powers to make the pilgrimage
(President Francois Mitterand of France
and Queen Elizabeth of Great Britain went
a month ago). As he is wont to do on such
symbolic occasions in such symbolic locales,
Reagan gave a ringing proclamation of
democracy and liberal values and a blister
ing attack on communism, totalitarianism
and the miserable hordes of the forces of
evil. And he did it very well. No one is his
equal at giving the thumbs-up to
democracy.

As for the wall itself — well, it too seems
to demand such treatment. Reagan called it
"a gash of barbed wire, concrete, dog runs
and guard towers . . . symbols and instru
ments of a totalitarian state." Heads of
state routinely stop at the wall to remem
ber their ideological roots and to catch a bit
of President Kennedy's glamor while recall
ing his famous "Ich bin ein Berliner" speech
25 years ago.
But does the wall still jar? We ought to
take care to re-evaluate our icons every
once in a while when their meaning starts
to become routine and our response
becomes knee-jerk. The wall is now a
quarter-century old. An anniversary of
sorts was celebrated this past year, another
sure sign that the wall has been institution
alized in our historical and political vocabu
lary. Let's ignore the extra baggage of the
accn d interpretations for the moment and
simp examine the wall as a physical en
tity, see whether (and how) it stands up
as a symbolic entity.
I lived in Berlin some months ago and
visited the wall myself during the first
week of my stay. (It is, after all, something
of a tourist attraction.) I had, of course,
taken my own preconceptions of the wall

with me. I expected something tall and
huge and monstrous, maybe with machine
gun turrets encased within every five feet
It rather underwhelmed me at first sight.
Honestly, if I'd had a small step ladder I
could've hopped over the thing. The wall is
not tall — maybe 10 feet high at most,
maybe less. After taking measure of it and
deciding I was probably equal to the task of
jumping it, I inspected it closer. The sup
posedly striking graffiti also disappointed
me. Beautiful and profound and angry in
spots, yes. But often the incredibly
mundane "I was here" or "Suzy loves
Bobby" predominates — the kind of thing
one finds carved on a picnic bench in a na
tional park.
From the western vantage, then, the wall
seemed ordinary, manageable.
Naturally, I knew that if I vaulted the
wall I'd be instantly ripped by bullets,
blown up by land mines, electrocuted by
barbed wire or dissected by some other dire
instrument of torture. Still, I had that per
verse wish — simply so I could prove to the
world that the physicality, the presence of
the wall is no big deal. Hell, I'd even read
that a few months before a fellow had
straddled the wall and beat on it for a while
with a sledge hammer, to show us all that it
was not impossible to conceive of disman
tling it altogether. But I'm getting away
from the task here.
Seen from most other vantages, the wall
is an unusually powerful and secure border
installation. It is in fact a misnomer to call
it"the wall" because there are many layers
to East Germany's "anti-fascist protection
border," as it is called on the other side: an
inner and an outer wall, control towers,
floodlights, spiked chain fence protecting a
river that flows underneath, mines, dogs
and so on. It is also an unusual border be
cause it is not really a border. It stands en
tirely on the eastern side of the official line.
So in some sense, Reagan's description is
accurate. The wall stands on communist
soil, is maintained by the communists and
is a highly efficient, lethal and brutal ma
chine controlling the flow of people from
one side to another, in a "totalitarian" man
ner, if you will.
So what does Reagan do? He challenges
Soviet General Secretary Gorbachev to tear

the wall down, in the face of the onslaught
of democracy. He transforms the wall into a
litmus test for the credibility of Gorba
chev's internal reforms, the so-called
"glasnost" policies. (Reagan however, was
careful not to link the issue to the success of
the current European arms talks, which he
needs so desperately for his credibility.)
What's so wrong with that sentiment?
Whether considered close up in all of its
banality or from afar in all of its exhaustive
precision, the wall is a sign that something
is wrong with humanity. It cries out for dis
mantling because it cruelly, stupidly and
needlessly separates people.
I admire far more the man who throws
himself at the wall and tears it down brick
by brick with his own hammer, than the
man who stands safely on one side and baits
the other side with ideological barbs and
posturing in order to bolster his own self
esteem.
The walls that physically divide East and
West are in Communist territory.
The wall that divides East and West in
spirit, ideology and mentality — in short,
the symbolic wall — is shared equally by
Reagan and (let's not exonerate him) Gor
bachev.
That symbolic wall was built together
long before the communists laid a brick in
1961. Make no mistake about it, the wall is
never coming down without a spirit of
cooperation on both sides. That's what
angers me about Reagan's speech: there
was not a hint of a tone of cooperation in it.
Far more effective would have been a
concrete proposal or conciliation that chal
lenged Gorbachev to respond in kind. Such
tactics have proven extremely effective in
recent months coming from the General
Secretary himself on the subject of arms
control. And the same strategy works well
for the public relations competition be
tween the superpowers — which Reagan
evidently desires to win but nevertheless
has been losing consistently.
The time in which Reagan could draw
strength from a verbal attack on the com
munist scourge and "their" wall is long
gone. The tune sounds a bit flat now.
Reagan at the wall didn't impress me.
