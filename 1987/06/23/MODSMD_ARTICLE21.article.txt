## University structure discussed News/Inside 
### C.R. DOUGLAS Editorial staff 
At a university that matric
ulates increasingly talented un
dergraduates and attracts an
increasingly talented faculty, it
is noteworthy that cries for bet
ter undergraduate education
have also increased in number
and magnitude.
Some believe the problem
with undergraduate education
at Stanford inheres in the Uni
versity's structure. Similiar in
stitutions — like Harvard and
Columbia — have adopted the
model of an undergraduate col
lege. This model, they find, is a
convenient way of dividing the
dual mission of the university:
teaching is done in the college
and research in the university.
At Columbia, faculty are ap
pointed to the college by the
dean. This has at least two ad
vantages. Not only does the col
lege get to pick and choose who
will teach undergraduates
(presumably those who have
the highest teaching perfor
mances), but there is an unam
biguous commitment by the fac
ulty appointed to devote the
bulk of their time to under
graduates.
Stanford, unlike those uni

versities, is comprised of seven
schools — Humanities and
Sciences, Earth Sciences, Engi
neering, Law, Education and
Business. Of those six, three —
Humanities and Sciences,
Earth Sciences and Engineer
ing — do almost 90 percent of
the undergraduate education
and at least half of the graduate
education. There is no college.
Would a college within a uni
versity structure, like Harvard
and Columbia, be the answer to
the problems Stanford seems to
have in securing more faculty
attention to the cause of educat
ing undergraduates?
The outgoing dean of Under
graduate Studies, Carolyn
Lougee, thinks not.
"In such a structure," Lougee
notes, "you give up any claim on
every faculty member who is
not appointed to the college.
That seems to me a big loss.
Formally, we have a claim on
each and every faculty member
of Humanities and Sciences,
Engineering and Earth
Sciences. By virtue of their ap
pointment to one of these three
schools faculty members have
an obligation to undergraduate
education. That ought to give us
some advantage," notes Lougee.
Lougee believes the possibili

ties for further enhancing the
education of Stanford under
graduates are most promising
within the existing structure.
"If we could mobilize that frac
tion of the faculty that is for
mally owed to undergraduate
education here, we could be in
credible." That challenge, ac
cording to Lougee, would not be
satisfied by creating a college.
She fears that a Stanford col
lege would take the form of
Harvard. Harvard, with some
exceptions of course, has
abandoned the mission of trying
to secure research professors for
undergraduate education. Un
dergraduates there are taught
primarily by untenured, para
faculty who are at the Univer
sity under three-year appoint
ments. She would like to see
Stanford remain committed to
tenured faculty doing most of
the undergraduate education.
"If there is any hope of
delivering the research faculty

to undergraduates, I want to do
it. If that fails we may have to
go to the Harvard model,"
Lougee warns.
The reason we are not getting
enough from the faculty,
Lougee believes, is not because
they have been fluffing it. Stan
ford is one of the few research
universities that has such in
credible institutional demands.
Professors are expected to
devote time to undergraduates,
graduates, research and some
degree of institutional responsi
bility such as departmental
chairmanships.
"The number of universities
that expect that much is lim
ited. At most research univer
sities, like Berkeley and Michi
gan, the expectations amount to
graduates and research. What
is different about Stanford is
that we are not willing to define
some groups or tasks as uni
mportant. As a consequence we
do work our faculty very hard."

But all hope within the cur
rent structure is not lost.
Lougee acknowledges the ad
vancements that have been
made since 1982, the year she
began her tenure as dean. The
most important structural
change was placing the dean
ship of Undergraduate Studies
into the school of Humanities
and Sciences. Previously, the
position was in the provost's of
fice. In that school, which does
80 percent of the undergraduate
teaching, Lougee has been a
strong and tenacious voice for
undergraduates.
In addition, since 1982 under
graduate teaching has played
more of a factor than ever
before in promotions and salary
settings. The evidence that is
brought forward at such occa
sions includes student evalua
tions, the number of advisees
the candidate has had, and the
number and quality of new
courses the candidate has
taught. Moreover, every promo
tion takes into account letters
solicited from undergraduates
and graduates who have
worked under the candidate.
But problems exist with these
advancements. "There are ten
sions in applying these levers.
It is hard to persuade hot-shot
researchers who have lots of
outside offers," notes Lougee.
There are some on the Stan
ford faculty, unlike Lougee,
who favor a move toward a
college-type structure. William
Chace, vice-provost for aca
demic planning and develop
ment as well as professor of En
glish, has a Utopian vision
where Stanford undergraduates
would spend their first two
years in a "college." Under such
a structure there would be a
body of the faculty that would
constitute the teaching faculty.
These professors would not be
denied research opportunities,
but their main focus would be
teaching undergraduates. After
two years, students would move
into the departments where
they could pursue their majors.
The college would have the re
sponsibility of initially orient
ing undergraduates and uniting
what is an otherwise disparate
group.
But Utopias are only hopes
and rarely realities, and Chace
recognizes that the current

structure is a result of neces
sary compromise. "We have in
place a structure that most
people think is not injurious or
chafing. A new structure would
undoubtedly chafe," notes
Chace.
The Centennial campaign,
while it won't create a Stanford
college, will remedy the lack of
attention given to undergradu
ates. At least 20 new professor
ships will be created in the un
dergraduate schools as well as
approximately 15 positions for a
rotating faculty. Rotating posi
tions will serve to attract the
many researchers and graduate
teachers at Stanford and
Hoover to spend five years with
full attention to undergradu
ates. Not only would salary
money be provided, but addi
tional funds would be available
to Ssustain the position a pro
fessor temporarily vacates.
In what was her last pitch to
the Board of Trustees, Lougee
emphasized the importance of
Stanford capitalizing on its very
encouraging potentials. "It is
not that we are doing badly, but
we could be fantastic. We need
to be challenged by the possibil
ities."
