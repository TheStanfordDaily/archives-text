# Thousands to attend summer programs
## 
### BRYAN COOPERRIDER Staff writer 
For many, summer at Stanford means
school. However, there are more people
for whom it means something else.
According to Lois Fariello in the Con
ference Office, there will be between
14,000 and 16,000 people attending the
more than 160 conferences this summer
on the Stanford campus.
Conferences and activities coming to
campus include the American Press In
stitute, the Graduate School of Business'
Class of '62 reunion, a high school cheer
leading camp and a jazz workshop.
Conference sponsors are found in all
segments of the University. This sum
mer marks Bowman Alumni Center's
22nd year of summer continuing educa
tion programs. They kicked off their
busy season yesterday with the first of
two conferences for executives. The
Stanford Engineering Executive Pro
gram — nine years old this summer —
caters primarily to high-level execu
tives.
According to Marian Adams, director
of continuing education at Bowman, the
executive program offers "intellectual

renewal that translates into professional
renewal." The day has passed, Adams
believes, when education ended at age
22 or 25. "We all feel the brain is a use it
or lose it organ."

sional renewal

She hopes the conference will help en
gineering executives broaden their per
spectives on decision-making in a world
that is becoming rapidly more complex.
Three themes will be covered: manage
ment skills, advances in technology and
public and social policy. Among the
facilitators are Profs. Barton Bernstein
(history), Jim Adams (VTSS and indus
trial engineering) and Leonard Ratner
(music).
In addition to the programs for engi
neering executives, Bowman sponsors a

similar conference for executives from
non engineering based companies: the
Stanford Executive Program in the
Humanities. Limited to 20 participants,
this conference is designed as a two
week sabbatical for chief executive offi
cers. Profs. James Sheehan (history),
Nancy Packer (English), Paul Seaver
(history), and John Gurley (economics)
will each lead five two-hour colloquia.
Upon arrival, participants are respon
sible for having read 20 plus books, in
cluding authors such as Freud and
Marx.
Adams notes that the conference is de
signed to concentrate on the seminal
thinkers who have dominated intellec
tual discourse since the mid-19th cen
tury. "They (the executives) need an un
derstanding of the past to look toward
the future," concludes Adams.
Other conferences sponsored by the
alumni center's continuing education
program include the 11th Stanford Con
ference on Design and the 22nd Stanford
Summer College.
The sports camps — sponsored by the
Athletics Department — offer potential
college athletes the opportunity to meet
Stanford coaches and view the campus.

For those sports in which Stanford par
ticularly excels, the summer sports
camps attract significantly more ath
letes.
Fariello expects a $4 million income
from housing and food service alone this
summer. "The money will be put right
back into the student housing funds to
keep rates down for students (during the
academic year)," Fariello added. A
reserve fund from the interest earned on
the money received during the summer
will be set aside to fund future under
graduate residences.
