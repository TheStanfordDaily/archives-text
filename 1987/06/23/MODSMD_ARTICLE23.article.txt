## Summer fun at Lake Tahoe's resorts and casinos 
### JEFFREY MALTZMAN J. PIRTLE 
To most Stanford students, Tahoe is
synonymous with skiing. While it is true
that the Lake Tahoe area offers some of
the finest skiing in the west, Tahoe's
warm weather attributes are all too of
ten ignored by all but those few for
tunate souls who land summer jobs at
Stanford's Sierra Camp.
Tahoe's warm weather activities in
clude hiking, swimming, waterskiing,
sailing, sightseeing and horseback
riding. The lake is surrounded by miles
of well-maintained hiking trails. Trail
maps can be obtained from any of the
numerous state parks which surround
the lake. Day hiking opportunities are
plentiful and there are numerous treks
ideal for avid backpackers.
Hikers are well advised to always
carry warm protective clothing. Even in
midsummer a warm, sunny morning can
turn into a freezing afternoon snow
storm in the High Sierras.
The south shore of the lake is the
preferred summer destination because of
its bountiful nightlife and accomoda
tions options. The Nevada side of the
lake has numerous small casinos, but
South Lake Tahoe boasts the five largest
gambling establishments.
Nestled in a two-block stretch of High
way 50, the casinos often feature big
name entertainers such as Bill Cosby
and Rich Little. Arrive early for shows
like these, since they are often standing

room only. For those not interested in
shows, the casinos have a variety of bars
and lounges with atmospheres ranging
from rowdy to romantic.
Each casino has its own ambiance.
Caesar's and Harrah's cater to a more
experienced gambling crowd, and the
dealers seem to have limited patience
with neophyte players during the busy
weekends. Harrah's is almost always
bustling, but it is a bit easier to find a
place at a table in Caesar's.
Harvey's is far more casual and
friendly. The dealers are much more pa
tient while teaching the games and help
ing new players. (On our visit, Lady
Luck blessed us at slot machine number
1,955.) All of the casinos provide free
drinks to gamblers, but Harvey's takes
special care to serve even those playing
the 5-cent slot machines.
The legal age to gamble or drink in
Nevada is 21. High Sierra and Harvey's
attract younger crowds than Harrah's or
Caesar's — High Sierra attracting the
youngest crowd, perhaps because of its
low room rates.
Groups heading to Tahoe should con
sider staying at Lakeland Village.
Lakeland is a large condominium com
plex located on the shore of the lake, one
mile on the California side of the border.
The large condos rent for about the
same price as a room at most quality
hotels, yet can easily sleep up to eight.
Most are three levels, with a master
bedroom and bath, fully equipped
kitchen and living room with cable TV,

fireplace and sofa bed.
Overlooking the living area is an iron
spiral staircase leading to a sleeping loft.
The lofts come either with two double
beds or two bunk beds.
The center of the complex boasts a
large heated swimming pool and spa
cious jacuzzi. Lakeland's private beach
offers a wide variety of watersports.
For those who prefer a more romantic
getaway, try either the Tahoe Seasons
resort at Heavenly Valley or the Inn by
the Lake hotel. The Tahoe Seasons is
Heavenly's new timeshare resort hotel
at the foot of the ski slopes. The resort is
very modern, but some guests com
plained about the constant influx of
visitors taking timeshare sales pitch
tours.
Tahoe Seasons' outdoor pool and
jacuzzi are a bit small to attract much of
a crowd, but the rooftop tennis courts are
quite popular. The size of the pool and
jacuzzi area doesn't seem to bother many J
guests since most rooms include a full
sized jacuzzi between the bedroom and
living room.
Additionally, the rooms have cable
TVs and the living area has a small effi
ciency kitchen and wet bar with mini
refrigerator and microwave oven — no
stove or utensils.
Regardless of where you stay at
Tahoe, the Sunday brunch at Tahoe
Seasons is not to be missed. The plentiful
spread is a real bargain — especially
when you won't be able to eat again for a
while.

For a friendly, as well as romantic
getaway, try the Inn by the Lake at
South Lake Tahoe. This new Colony
Resort hotel is located two miles west of
the casino strip and nestled between a
grove of towering ponderosa pines and
the shimmering blue lake.
The Inn's rooms were recently
awarded first place in guest room design
by Lodging Hospitality magazine.
The rooms all offer color TVs with a
complimentary movie channel, an
AM/FM radio, a second telephone in the
bath and more. A few of the larger rooms
and suites also have wet bar,
refrigerator, full kitchens and oversized
spas. The older wing has smaller rooms
without air conditioning but is closer to
the lake. Most guests seem to prefer the
new wing adjacent to the pool and
jacuzzi.
The pool area is the centerpiece of the
resort. The jacuzzi is built on two levels
with a small waterfall between them.
The jacuzzi is always filled with a
friendly crowd of visitors from around
the world.
Although frowned upon by the man
agement, there is a dedicated group of
nudists who share the jacuzzi at about 3
a.m. each morning.
For those exploring Tahoe on a
budget, there is an American Youth
Hostel and a Motel 6, both on the south
side. Reservations for weekends are a
must, and the Hostel has strict regula
tions and a curfew.
