# Stanford's Care Unit: laughing all the way to the bank
## 
### JAMES R. DICKEY Editorial staff 
This Saturday marks the blending of entertainment
with history and charity.
The Palo Alto Jaycees, celebrating their 50th anni
versary, will be presenting the first annual South Bay
Comedy Picnic in conjunction with the Concert Net
work and The San Jose Mercury.
The Comedy Picnic proceeds will benefit Stanford
Hospital's world-renowned Neonatal Intensive Care
Unit.
The show, beginning at 3 p.m. and lasting until ap
proximately 6:30 p.m. in Frost Amphitheater, will in
clude almost 30 comedians from around the country.
The show will consist of five sets, each containing ap
proximately five minutes material from five different
comedians.
The list of acts includes comics from the Bay Area,
Los Angeles and New York.
For a first-time production, the benefit has an une
qualled quality of participants. Performing in the show
will be several widely recognized comedians, including
"Saturday Night Live" regular A. Whitney Brown and
"Entertainment Tonight" staffer Bob Sarlatte. Also
among the acts listed are an unprecedented four San
Francisco Comedy Competition winners.
Palo Alto Jaycees Chairman Steve Poizner believes
the event could not have been presented without the
charitable attitudes of everyone involved. "Simply

paying the fees and expenses for so many performers
would create such a high overhead that the ticket
prices would be outrageous. It just couldn't be done," he
said.

Many of the comics have not only waived their fees,
but have paid for their own expenses. In the case of A.
Whitney Brown, a local travel agency donated the
travel arrangements necessary to bring him here from
New York.
Like the travel agency, much of the local community
is involved in donating services and funds.
According to Concert Network member Phil Klein,
the overhead costs incurred by the security guards, set
up and break-down crews are being covered by commu
nity donations through the Palo Alto Jaycees.
Major sponsors, like The San Jose Mercury and
KOME radio, are donating thousands of dollars worth
of space and air time in order to insure the success of
the program.
The Jaycees and Concert Network are hoping for a
tremendous response to the show.
"Comedy is really popular these days, and although
San Jose has a couple of tremendously sucessful com
edy clubs, this is the first show of its kind on the Penin
sula," Poizner said. "Plus, the cause — a world famous
neonatal clinic — is so worthy that people are
naturally sympathetic. I hope we will have a tremen
dous showing."
Klein, though also hopeful, was more guarded in his
predictions.
"It's really hard to predict the attendance at this
show because it's been quite a while since anything
like this has been presented at Frost," he said.
