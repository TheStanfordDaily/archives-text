A look at Stanford athletes around the world

Marquess, Carey
win baseball awards
Baseball America magazine
has made Stanford baseball
coach Mark Marquess its Coach
of the Year. Marquess led the
Cardinal to a 53-17 record this
season on the way to a Paciflc
-10 Conference Southern Divi
sion title and its first-ever Col
lege World Series (CWS) cham
pionship.
The magazine also named
Paul Carey Freshman of the
Year. The right fielder from
Weymouth, Mass. batted .353
with 12 home runs and 62 runs
batted in this year — an all-
Stanford freshman record.
"It's just a great honor (to win
the award). I didn't expect it,"
Carey said. "I guess this just
caps off a great season."
The ever-modest Carey said
he couldn't have achieved his
phenomenal success on his own.
"I wouldn't have these statistics
(62 RBI) if it wasn't for my
teammates," he said, referring
to his spot in the batting order
behind Ruben Amaro, Toi Cook
and Ed Sprague — all of whom
were on base often this year.
It was Carey's dramatic
tenth-inning grand slam
against LSU that brought the
Card nine back from the brink
of elimination in the CWS
tournament. For his heroics he
was named outstanding player

at the CWS — an award he also
won at the West I regional.
"It's going to be very tough to
repeat," Carey said when asked
about the team's chances for
next year. But he added,"We
have the talent... to go on and
do it again." Carey also said the
coaches were not going to take
it easy on the team and the
players would not be com
placent.
Sprague's hit gives
team dramatic win
In other baseball news, third
baseman Ed Sprague singled
with two out in the bottom of
the ninth to give the U.S. Pan
American baseball team a 6-5
victory over the Bryan Packers
in Millington, Tenn. Saturday.
Sprague, who started for this
year's CWS Champion Stanford
Cardinal baseball team, is
playing for the U.S team on a
37-game exhibition tour.
Swimmers win at
Mission Viejo meet
Junior Jenna Johnson was in
top form at the Mission Viejo
swimming Meet of Champions
last weekend. Johnson won the
100-meter butterfly in 1:02.31
and the 100-meter freestyle in
57.43, a race in which Stanford
graduate Kathy Smith took

second with a time of 59.37.
Sophomore Susannah Miller
won the 100-meter backstroke
in 1:07.02 and senior Jennifer
Pokluda finished second, only
two-tenths of a second behind
Miller.
Association cites
Brennan, Fendick
The International Tennis
Coaches Association named
Stanford women's coach Frank
Brennan the Wilson National
Coach of the Year. Despite the
loss of Marianne Werdel to the
professional ranks and injuries
to top players Leigh Anne
Eldredge and Eleni Rossides,
Brennan guided the team to its
second consecutive title.
Patty Fendick, the recent
graduate and two-time NCAA
singles champion, was named
Senior Player of the Year and
winner of the Arthur Ashe
Sportsmanship Award by the
ITCA. Fendick finished her
Stanford career with a perfect
40-0 senior season. She won her
last 57 matches as a collegian
and begins her professional
career this week at Wimbledon.
Play should begin
today at Wimbledon
The first round of the All-
England Lawn Tennis Cham
pionships was rained out yes
terday at Wimbledon, England.
The tournament, which should
begin today, features many

Stanford stars of the past — all
with their sights set on captur
ing one of tennis' most coveted
crowns.
This year's hopefuls include
Tim Mayotte, who is currently
seeded 10th in the world.
Mayotte has been playing his
best tennis as a pro and has
done well at Wimbledon in the
past — reaching the quarter
finals last year and the semi
finals in 1982.
On the women's side, Patty
Fendick and Marianne Werdel

could square off in the second
round if both capture their first
round matches.
Jim Grabb, Dan Goldie and
Alycia Moulton will also be
there. However, one former
Stanford star will be notable in
his absence. John McEnroe,
ranked Bth in the world, has
been unable to train since the
French Open due to a back in
jury. McEnroe has now missed
Wimbledon two years in a row.

Brennan, Fendick
The International Tennis
Coaches Association named
Stanford women's coach Frank
Brennan the Wilson National
Coach of the Year. Despite the
loss of Marianne Werdel to the
professional ranks and injuries
to top players Leigh Anne
Eldredge and Eleni Rossides,
Brennan guided the team to its
second consecutive title.
Patty Fendick, the recent
graduate and two-time NCAA
singles champion, was named
Senior Player of the Year and
winner of the Arthur Ashe
Sportsmanship Award by the
ITCA. Fendick finished her
Stanford career with a perfect
40-0 senior season. She won her
last 57 matches as a collegian
and begins her professional
career this week at Wimbledon.
Play should begin
today at Wimbledon
The first round of the All-
England Lawn Tennis Cham
pionships was rained out yes
terday at Wimbledon, England.
The tournament, which should
begin today, features many

Stanford stars of the past — all
with their sights set on captur
ing one of tennis' most coveted
crowns.
This year's hopefuls include
Tim Mayotte, who is currently
seeded 10th in the world.
Mayotte has been playing his
best tennis as a pro and has
done well at Wimbledon in the
past — reaching the quarter
finals last year and the semi
finals in 1982.
On the women's side, Patty
Fendick and Marianne Werdel

could square off in the second
round if both capture their first
round matches.
Jim Grabb, Dan Goldie and
Alycia Moulton will also be
there. However, one former
Stanford star will be notable in
his absence. John McEnroe,
ranked Bth in the world, has
been unable to train since the
French Open due to a back in
jury. McEnroe has now missed
Wimbledon two years in a row.
