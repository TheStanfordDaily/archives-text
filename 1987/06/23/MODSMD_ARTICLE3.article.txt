# Commencement '87
## O'Neill pushes public service 
### STEVE KASIERSKI Senior staff writer 
Over 4,000 Stanford students offi
cially became alumni at the 96th
Commencement ceremonies here on
Sunday, June 14.
The unseasonably cool and blustery
morning only slightly lulled the
spirits of the graduates and the esti
mated 25,000 relatives and friends
who jammed Stanford Stadium to
view the festivites and listen to
speeches by former Speaker of the
U.S. House of Representatives

Thomas "Tip" O'Neill and University
President Donald Kennedy.
In his 26-minute talk, O'Neill high
lighted the role of universities in pro
viding the "human capital" necessary
for continued economic growth and
criticized government officials associ
ated with the Iran-contra affair for
violating national trust.
O'Neill, who began his political
career as a Boston College under
graduate in 1936, retired as House
Speaker last year, after 10 years in
the position. His was the longest con
tinuous tenure in the history of the

office. He has served as a trustee of
his alma mater since 1972.
In his introduction, President Ken
nedy said O'Neill was being honored
for "his dedication to education and
for the standards he has set for public
service as much as for an extraordi
nary legislative career."
With champagne corks popping
and Centennial banners billowing in
the background, the Massachusetts
democrat began his speech with a fa
vorite anecdote about industrialist
Henry Ford, who was persuaded
by crafty Irish townspeople to
donate $50,000 rather than
$5,000 toward the construction
of a hospital.
According to O'Neill, Ford
gave the money only after being
assured that a special inscrip
tion was carved above the en
trance reading, "I came among
you, and you took me in."
O'Neill also praised Donald
Kennedy's love for Boston
sports teams and his penchant
for quoting former Celtic bas
ketball star Cedric Maxwell. "A
biologist who quotes a Celtic
forward is my kind of scientist,"
O'Neill said.
Citing the business career of
Leland Stanford, the founder of
the University, O'Neill
predicted that "human re
sources" will play an increas
ingly important role in main
taining economic growth in the
next century.
"A national committment to
high quality university re
search is critical to maintaining
America's comparative advan
tage in a new world economy,"
he said. "Investing in educa
tion is as critical to the eco
nomic infrastructure of this na
tion in the 21st century as in

vesting in railroads was in the
19th century," he continued.
"We need a strategic invest
ment iniative in education more
than we need a strategic
defense initiative in space."
According to O'Neill, the im
portance of education is now
revealed in the typical back
grounds of members of
Congress, who he characterized
as "highly educated, highly
qualified, sophisticated elected
officials."
Although political appointees
are also generally "experienced
and educated professionals,"
O'Neill rapped members of
President Reagan's National
Security Council who partici
pated in the Iran-contra affair,
calling it "one of this country's
most ill-advised foreign policy
iniatives in its history."
O'Neill also said he agreed
with the Tower Commission
that "the failure the Iran-contra
affair represented was human
and not structural."
O'Neill said, "the officers of
our government must take their
oath to uphold the Constitution
and its laws as a sacred oath.
Service in high positions of
trust in our government are
more than personal services to a
superior, they are positions of
national trust in which the ul
timate authority is the law and
the American people.
"Our government is a politi

cal institution. It is not a busi
ness."
Government officials may
have lost sight of the public ser
vice ethic that guided such men
as Averill Harriman and
George Kennan, O'Neill said.
"It may well be that the fail
ure of judgement and absence of
integrity among the principals
in the Iran scandel is a result of
their identities being too
wrapped up in their committ
ment to their careers," he said.
"No career advancement is
worth jeopardizing one's repu
tation for honesty, and no power
is so desirable that the law
should be disregarded."
O'Neill said he is concerned
that the Iran affair revelations
may erode confidence in govern
ment.
"We cannot afford to have
Americans tune out their gov
ernment again as they did in
the '705," he said. "We cannot
afford to have another genera
tion of Americans reject public
service. Our government needs
public interest, public support
and most of all public trust.
"The current Congressional
hearings into the affair have
produced more people who have
sought refuge in a public dis
play of arrogance and ignorance
than any set of hearings I can
recall," he said.
"Ignorance is no excuse for
lawbreaking, especially at the
highest levels of our govern
ment. The fact is that when
faced with a choice of giving up
the power that their position
provides or obeying the law, too

many highly placed officials
chose to keep their power."
The problem of choices was
also the subject of Kennedy's
farewell remarks to graduates,
which addressed the "age-old"
question, "Is there life after
Stanford?"
Kennedy said choices, the
"core of human freedom," are
different from solving difficult
problems "mainly because

everytime we make one, we
have to give something up."
"If it is true that education is
preparation for the manage
ment of freedom and responsi
bility, then one of the things it
ought to supply you with is the
capacity to analyze choices, to
make them with confidence and
to learn from the consequences
of living with them," he said.

Kennedy said deferring a
decision was a "natural
response" to a difficult choice
between a "safe alternative that
offers modest gains" and "a
risky one with higher awards."
"The costs fall everywhere,
like a widespread drizzle, while
we are permitted the illusuion
that it isn't really raining hard
in any particular place."

The unseasonably cool and blustery
morning only slightly lulled the
spirits of the graduates and the esti
mated 25,000 relatives and friends
who jammed Stanford Stadium to
view the festivites and listen to
speeches by former Speaker of the
U.S. House of Representatives

Thomas "Tip" O'Neill and University
President Donald Kennedy.
In his 26-minute talk, O'Neill high
lighted the role of universities in pro
viding the "human capital" necessary
for continued economic growth and
criticized government officials associ
ated with the Iran-contra affair for
violating national trust.
O'Neill, who began his political
career as a Boston College under
graduate in 1936, retired as House
Speaker last year, after 10 years in
the position. His was the longest con
tinuous tenure in the history of the

office. He has served as a trustee of
his alma mater since 1972.
In his introduction, President Ken
nedy said O'Neill was being honored
for "his dedication to education and
for the standards he has set for public
service as much as for an extraordi
nary legislative career."
With champagne corks popping
and Centennial banners billowing in
the background, the Massachusetts
democrat began his speech with a fa
vorite anecdote about industrialist
Henry Ford, who was persuaded
by crafty Irish townspeople to
donate $50,000 rather than
$5,000 toward the construction
of a hospital.
According to O'Neill, Ford
gave the money only after being
assured that a special inscrip
tion was carved above the en
trance reading, "I came among
you, and you took me in."
O'Neill also praised Donald
Kennedy's love for Boston
sports teams and his penchant
for quoting former Celtic bas
ketball star Cedric Maxwell. "A
biologist who quotes a Celtic
forward is my kind of scientist,"
O'Neill said.
Citing the business career of
Leland Stanford, the founder of
the University, O'Neill
predicted that "human re
sources" will play an increas
ingly important role in main
taining economic growth in the
next century.
"A national committment to
high quality university re
search is critical to maintaining
America's comparative advan
tage in a new world economy,"
he said. "Investing in educa
tion is as critical to the eco
nomic infrastructure of this na
tion in the 21st century as in

vesting in railroads was in the
19th century," he continued.
"We need a strategic invest
ment iniative in education more
than we need a strategic
defense initiative in space."
According to O'Neill, the im
portance of education is now
revealed in the typical back
grounds of members of
Congress, who he characterized
as "highly educated, highly
qualified, sophisticated elected
officials."
Although political appointees
are also generally "experienced
and educated professionals,"
O'Neill rapped members of
President Reagan's National
Security Council who partici
pated in the Iran-contra affair,
calling it "one of this country's
most ill-advised foreign policy
iniatives in its history."
O'Neill also said he agreed
with the Tower Commission
that "the failure the Iran-contra
affair represented was human
and not structural."
O'Neill said, "the officers of
our government must take their
oath to uphold the Constitution
and its laws as a sacred oath.
Service in high positions of
trust in our government are
more than personal services to a
superior, they are positions of
national trust in which the ul
timate authority is the law and
the American people.
"Our government is a politi

cal institution. It is not a busi
ness."
Government officials may
have lost sight of the public ser
vice ethic that guided such men
as Averill Harriman and
George Kennan, O'Neill said.
"It may well be that the fail
ure of judgement and absence of
integrity among the principals
in the Iran scandel is a result of
their identities being too
wrapped up in their committ
ment to their careers," he said.
"No career advancement is
worth jeopardizing one's repu
tation for honesty, and no power
is so desirable that the law
should be disregarded."
O'Neill said he is concerned
that the Iran affair revelations
may erode confidence in govern
ment.
"We cannot afford to have
Americans tune out their gov
ernment again as they did in
the '705," he said. "We cannot
afford to have another genera
tion of Americans reject public
service. Our government needs
public interest, public support
and most of all public trust.
"The current Congressional
hearings into the affair have
produced more people who have
sought refuge in a public dis
play of arrogance and ignorance
than any set of hearings I can
recall," he said.
"Ignorance is no excuse for
lawbreaking, especially at the
highest levels of our govern
ment. The fact is that when
faced with a choice of giving up
the power that their position
provides or obeying the law, too

many highly placed officials
chose to keep their power."
The problem of choices was
also the subject of Kennedy's
farewell remarks to graduates,
which addressed the "age-old"
question, "Is there life after
Stanford?"
Kennedy said choices, the
"core of human freedom," are
different from solving difficult
problems "mainly because

everytime we make one, we
have to give something up."
"If it is true that education is
preparation for the manage
ment of freedom and responsi
bility, then one of the things it
ought to supply you with is the
capacity to analyze choices, to
make them with confidence and
to learn from the consequences
of living with them," he said.

Kennedy said deferring a
decision was a "natural
response" to a difficult choice
between a "safe alternative that
offers modest gains" and "a
risky one with higher awards."
"The costs fall everywhere,
like a widespread drizzle, while
we are permitted the illusuion
that it isn't really raining hard
in any particular place."
Over 4,000 Stanford students offi
cially became alumni at the 96th
Commencement ceremonies here on
Sunday, June 14.
