Commencement ceremonies here on
Sunday, June 14.

morning only slightly lulled the
spirits of the graduates and the esti
mated 25,000 relatives and friends
who jammed Stanford Stadium to
view the festivites and listen to
speeches by former Speaker of the
U.S. House of Representatives

Thomas "Tip" O'Neill and University
President Donald Kennedy.
In his 26-minute talk, O'Neill high
lighted the role of universities in pro
viding the "human capital" necessary
for continued economic growth and
criticized government officials associ

violating national trust.
O'Neill, who began his political
career as a Boston College under
graduate in 1936, retired as House
Speaker last year, after 10 years in
the position. His was the longest con

office. He has served as a trustee of
his alma mater since 1972.
In his introduction, President Ken
nedy said O'Neill was being honored
for "his dedication to education and
for the standards he has set for public
service as much as for an extraordi
nary legislative career."
With champagne corks popping
and Centennial banners billowing in
the background, the Massachusetts
democrat began his speech with a fa
vorite anecdote about industrialist
