# NCAA challenged
## Stanford joins drug-test suit 
### LIZ LEMPERT 
Stanford University joined with student ath
letes Friday in a court challenge against the
NCAA's national drug testing policy. Stanford
will ask for a declaration clearing the University
of responsibility for testing athletes until the
case is decided.
In a motion filed in Santa Clara County Super
ior Court, Stanford intervened in the ongoing
case against the NCAA in an attempt to avoid
imposing the drug testing policy on student ath
letes if state courts find it unconstitutional.
"Stanford supports the elimination of drugs
from college athletics, but we will not support
even that laudable goal by action that is found to
be illegal," said John Schwartz, Stanford vice
president and general counsel.
The University is also asking that the NCAA
be enjoined from imposing sanctions or penalities
on Stanford students, coaches or teams for failing
to comply with the drug testing program, prior to
a final court decision on the program's legality.
According to Law Prof. Jack Friedenthal, the
NCAA can penalize a school whose students sue
and lose to the association. "The NCAA enforces
(its drug testing policy during the trial) by
threatening to get back at (the University.)"
"We are caught in the middle of a dispute,"
said Schwartz. "Stanford has been placed in the
untenable position of either complying with the
NCAA regulations at the risk of violating Cali
fornia's right-to-privacy law and its students'
rights, or subjecting itself, its teams and its indi
vidual athletes to NCAA sanctions if it does not
comply."
"If the NCAA drug testing program is lawful,"
Schwartz added, "We will enforce it; if it is not,
we won't. We are asking the court to make Stan
ford a party to the lawsuit and to prohibit the
NCAA from imposing sanctions against the Uni
versity and its athletes for complying with the
law and the court's orders."
A hearing on the issue is scheduled for July 20,
and if a judge grants Stanford's request, the Uni
versity's athletes would not be required to sign
drug testing consent forms until a court decision
is made on the legality of the NCAA guidelines.
The action taken by Stanford stems from a
ruling this spring in which Santa Clara County
Superior Court Judge Peter Stone declared that
Stanford diver Simone LeVant could compete
without undergoing drug testing.
LeVant argued that the pro
gram was humiliating and
degrading and invaded her
right to privacy under the Cali
fornia constitution. But because
LeVant, who graduated June
14, is no longer competing in
collegiate sports, the irrjuction
was dissolved by agreement on
May 11. 1
Jennifer Hill, a co-captain of
the women's soccer team who
joined the suit as an additional
plaintiff in February, will con
tinue the case against the
NCAA.
San Francisco attorney Susan
Harriman, one of the lawyers
representing LeVant and Hill,

said "We're very happy to have
(Stanford) in this suit. Frankly,
what Stanford is saying applies
to other universities. It will be
interesting to see what they
do."
NCAA officials view Stan
ford's action in a different light,
however. Richard Archer, one of
the NCAA's lead attorneys in
the case, said the NCAA's posi
tion "is that the member uni
versities can adopt these resolu
tions on their own free will. Of
course, they don't have to stay
in the NCAA. There is no con
stitutional right to participate
in intercollegiate athletics."
"If Stanford doesn't enforce
the rules, its players will be in
eligible," added George
Gangwere, an attorney for the
NCAA.
