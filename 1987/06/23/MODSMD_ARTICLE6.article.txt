# Trustees toughen divestment stance
## News 
### MARK ROGOWSKY Editorial staff 
Stanford may divest of its
stock in companies doing busi
ness in South Africa if those
firms do not sign the Sullivan
principles or receive low Sul
livan ratings, the Board of
Trustees Special Committee on
Investment Responsibility
(SCIR) announced at a June 12
meeting of the Board of Trus
tees.
Companies that have not
signed the principles and those
with low ratings will be given
90 days to provide specific
evidence they are working
actively to bring an end to
apartheid and have committed
resources to that goal.
The new divestment ap
proach differs from prior policy
by shifting the burden of proof
to the companies themselves. In
the past, divestment has been

delayed while the SCIR gath
ered information on companies
in the University's portfolio.
The policy change affects
roughly 20 companies in which
Stanford owns $13 million
worth of stock.
It comes on the heels of an an
nouncement by Rev. Leon Sul
livan that he is abandoning the
Sullivan principles he created
because "the main pillars of
apartheid still remain, and
something else must be done to
bring an end to that despicable
system that dehumanizes black
people." Sullivan has called for
all U.S. companies to withdraw
from South Africa within nine
months.
Prof. Frederick Hillier, chair
man of the Commission on In
vestment Responsibility (CIR),
which makes recomendations to
the SCIR, said the Sullivan
principles will still be used as a
guideline, however.
In another South Africa
related matter, the SCIR asked
staff members to study
processes that could be used to
gather, assess and act on infor
mation concerning the South
Africa policies of international
corporations based outside the
United States.
This action, believed to be the
first of its kind, was taken be
cause such firms offer very little
information to the public but
account for a much larger share
of investment in South Africa
than companies based in the
United States.
In other business, the trus

tees also authorized negotia
tions with Charter Medical Cor
poration for a joint venture to
construct a new 80-bed psychia
tric hospital.
Because the Medical School is
near its debt limit, it will build
the hospital in conjunction with
Charter, a for-profit health care
company which will finance the
project.
The faculty will have "full
control" over teaching, research
and patient care according to
Dr. David Korn, vice president
and dean of the Medical School.
Faculty members were criti
cal of the hospital joint venture.
Dr. Sidney Raffel, professor
emeritus of microbiology and a
member of the University Com
mitte on Land and Building De
velopment, said the proposal
was "tantamount to selling the

department to an outside
agency."
Korn disagreed with Raffel's
contention. "Control of the pro
gram is entirely in the hands of
the faculty," he said.
The trustees also tabled a
CIR recommendation calling for
the creation of a Stanford South
Africa Fund equal in size to the
University's income from cor
porate operations in that
country.
The fund would be used to
support educational purposes
related to South Africa and
could total from $50,000 to
$100,000 a year according to
Hillier.
Tabling the recommendation
will allow the proposal to be
studied and commented upon
before the next trustees
meeting in September.
