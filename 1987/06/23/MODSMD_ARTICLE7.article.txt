Dancer Fred Astaire dies
Fred Astaire, 88, one of the great dancers of this century
and an artist who transported generations of moviegoers into
special realms of grace and elegance, died of pneumonia Mon
day at Century City Hospital in Los Angeles.
Ballet choreographer George Balanchine called him "the
greatest dancer in the world . . . the most innovative, the
most elegant dancer of our times.
President Reagan, in a White House statement, said As
taire was "in every sense of the word a 'superstar'. . . . He was
the ultimate dancer . . . the absolute master of his terpsic
horean muse."
In 1933, he was cast with Ginger Rogers in "Flying Down to
Rio." They became a team and, in time, a legend. They ap
peared only in nine other films together. With the exception
of Rogers, Astaire had no other leading cinematic partners
more than twice, and in the public mind he was always iden
tified with Rogers.
"He was the best partner anyone could ever have," said
Rogers Monday from her home in Shady Grove, Ore.
Deal made on North testimony
WASHINGTON — Lt. Col. Oliver North and congressional
Iran-Contra investigators Monday appeared close to breaking
the deadlock that has threatened to delay or prevent the tes
timony of the central figure in the scandal, committee sources
said.
Under the outlines of a tentative deal, sources said, inves
tigators would limit the amount and scope of private tes
timony they heard from the former White House aide before
he appeared in public. This would work to the disadvantage of
the investigators, who had hoped to use extensive private tes
timony to prepare themselves for North's public appearance.
On the other hand, sources said, the possible agreement
may mean that North would testify before the panels heard
publicly from his former boss, John M. Poindexter, who had
served as Reagan's national security adviser. This would help
assure the committees, which have already talked to Poin
dexter privately, that North's account would not be influ
enced by Poindexter's version of events.
North had previously been scheduled to give public tes
timony in mid-July, but the agreement may bring him for
ward as early as July 7, sources said.
Rep. Lee H. Hamilton, D-Ind., chairman of the House's in
vestigating committee, told reporters that the congressional
committees had "made a lot of progress" in their talks with
North's attorney, Brendan Sullivan. He declined to disclose
any details of the arrangement but noted that while "not all
questions are resolved, things are moving forward."
Nuclear test victims can't sue
SAN FRANCISCO — Survivors of government employees
who developed cancer after exposure to radiation from atmos
pheric nuclear testing cannot sue the government or its con
tractors for damages, a federal appeals court ruled Monday.
In a landmark decision that could bar legal compensation
for an estimated 250,000 workers who may have been
exposed to radiation during atomic weapons testing in the
19505, the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that courts
could not be asked to second-guess safety precautions taken
on behalf of the exposed workers.
Moreover, families of military and civilian personnel who
died as a result of radiation-related cancers have no recourse
to sue the government simply because it failed to warn them
of the potential hazards until years after the fact, the appeals
court ruled.
"Nuclear weapons testing was known to be an inherently
dangerous activity . . . (and) the need to balance risks against
test objectives was particularly acute," a three-member panel
wrote in concluding that the government acted properly in re
quiring military troops to participate in the testing program.
Court OKs use of hypnosis, 5-4
WASHINGTON — The Supreme Court, ruling Monday for
the first time on the use of hypnosis in the courtroom, said
states may not prohibit testimony by criminal defendants
whose memories have been enhanced through hypnosis.
The 5-4 decision struck down an Arkansas rule, similar to
rules in 17 states, that flatly barred use of hynoptically as
sisted testimony on the grounds that it tended to be un
reliable.
Justice Harry A. Blackmun, writing for the court, said a
defendant's constitutional right to testify in his own defense
outweighed the state's interest in excluding possibly un
reliable evidence.
Completely excluding such testimony, Blackmun said, "is
an arbitrary restriction on the right to testify in the absence
of clear evidence by the state repudiating the validity of all
posthypnosis recollections."
The ruling, narrowly confined to criminal defendants, did
not address more typical situations such as the use of
hypnotically-obtained testimony by witnesses who have no
such constitutional right to testify.
