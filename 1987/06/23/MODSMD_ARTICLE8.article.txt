# Chun to meet with opposition
## 
### 
SEOUL, South Korea â€”
President Chun Doo Hwan and
his opponents appeared Monday
to be moving toward a compro
mise that would put an end to
almost two weeks of public dis
order.
Top opposition leader Kim
Young Sam urged cancellation
of an anti-government "peace
march" tentatively scheduled
for Friday, and President Chun
said he wanted to halt the tur
moil without resorting to
repressive measures harsher
than those employed so far to
cope with 13 days of street vio
lence.
Seoul was relatively calm
Monday, although scattered
violence continued in at least 10
provincial cities.
Chun made his statement
after meeting South Korea's
two living ex-presidents, Yun

Po Sun, 89, and Choi Kyu Hah,
67. Those talks were the begin
ning of a series he promised ear
lier in the day to hold with
"opposition leaders and elder
statesmen," including Kim,
president of the hard-line oppo
sition Reunification Democratic
Party.
Yun was the nation's
ceremonial president when the
late President Park Chung Hee
staged a coup in 1961, and Choi
was the interim president after
Park was assassinated in 1979.
"If at all possible, it's better
not to take any emergency ac
tion," a Chun spokesman
quoted the president as telling
Yun and Choi, clearly referring
to drastic repression. "It's better
to solve current chaos without
introducing stern actions."
Chun also appealed to the
public to reject action leading to

social instability that might
halt progress toward economic
prosperity and make it harder
for the nation to stage success
fully the 1988 Summer Olym
pics Games.
Kim, whose appeals for a
meeting with Chun had been
rejected for more than a year,
was offered an appointment
with the president after Chun
held talks with Roh Tae Woo,
chairman of the ruling Demo
cratic Justice Party and Chun's
personal choice to be South
Korea's next president.
If it is held, the Chun-Kim
meeting would be the first be
tween the former army general
and the opposition leader whom
he barred from politics from
1980 to 1985.
