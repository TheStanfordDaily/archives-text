## Argentine leader calls for tech transfer 
### BRIAN RHOADS Staff writer 
Argentine President Raul Alfonsin,
speaking to Stanford faculty members
yesterday, stressed that advanced na
tions must share communications and
high technology with Third World
countries for world economic conditions
to improve.
Alfonsin was given a brief tour of the
Stanford Center for Integrated Systems,
where he donned a sterile suit in order to
enter the "clean room" where systems
research takes place.
Following the tour of CIS, Alfonsin
and his delegation met with University
President Donald Kennedy and 20 fac
ulty members.
According to Diana Paul of Public Af
fairs, Alfonsin spoke of the need to im
prove technology for South American in
dustry but emphasized that "we not only
need to know about physics but metap
hysics as well," stressing "moral respon
sibility." He also joked about the impor
tance of having a "clean soul" in refer
ence to the clean room visit.
Sociology Prof. Alexander Inkles said
Alfonsin viewed the visit to the clean

room as a symbol of the importance of
high-tech to the Third World.
Alfonsin, who is credited with restor
ing civilian government to Argentina,
believes closing the technology gap be
tween advanced and less developed
countries will be a major problem in the
future, Inkles said.
The visit "is a demonstration of Alfon
sin's wish to improve education in Ar
gentina," said Stanford senior Ted
Gildred, a member of the Argentine
delegation and son of the U.S. Ambassa
dor to Argentina Theodore Gildred.
Gildred said the visit is important be
cause Alfonsin is "the first Argentine
President in California. He's here to see
the industry, as well as to get ideas for
improving education."
In the limited time allowed for ques
tions, Inkles pointed out Stanford's new
Center for the Americas and asked what
Alfonsin would choose as topics of re
search most likely to alleviate some of
the problems of Latin America. Accord
ing to Inkles, Alfonsin said "the aware
ness of the Americas is lower than it
ought to be."
Alfonsin used the example of asking a
U.S. foreign policy expert which prob

lems were the highest priorities. "He
would answer: first Russia, then the Per
sian Gulf, Europe," and perhaps
Nicaragua, for military reasons. Then —
perhaps as an afterthought — South
America, Alfonsin said.
Alfonsin suggested that the new cen
ter should help raise awareness of the
problems, and the knowledge base about
Latin America.
Alfonsin raised the issue of Argen
tina's foreign debt, saying all nations,
"North and south, democratic and non
democratic, have a coresponsibility" for
the world economic problems. He
alluded to the Marshall Plan that aided
Western Europe with its devastated eco
nomy after World War 11, commending
the United States for its "great states
manship" when dealing with that mat
ter.
Alfonsin added that there currently
exists a Marshall plan with South
America, only now the roles are
reversed, and Argentina and other
South American countries are pouring
capital into the U.S. Therefore, the eco
nomic problems were a second issue to be
dealt with by the new center.
At the end of the meeting, Kennedy

presented Alfonsin with a com
memorative award from Stanford.
Political Science Prof. Stephen Kras
ner called Alfonsin a "great man," add
ing, "there are not too many great men
around."
According to Maria Bun, of the Office
of International Visitors, Alfonsin was
particularly interested in Memorial
Church and paused for a brief tour while
walking through the Quad.
"President Alfonsin was very im
pressed by the fact that the church was
ecumenical," Bun said, "and in the
meeting stressed the importance of a
similar sharing of technology between
nations."
The President's delegation has
already visited several Eastern schools
as well as UC-San Diego. He visited UC-
Berkeley yesterday afternoon.
In April, the Argentine Government
was threatened by the rebellion of part
of the officer corps. When asked about
the stability of the Alfonsin government,
the president's attache, who wished not
to be identified, was quick to answer.
"There is no problem," he said, "The
Easter rebellion was just a small group
Democracy has been consolidated."
