### MARK ROGOWSKY Editorial staff 
The Class of 1991 will include
76 of the 200 applicants desig
nated as Jordan Scholars and
63 students admitted from the
wait list in a year when few col
leges nationwide had to turn to
their wait lists at all.
In addition, Stanford admit
ted a greater percentage of eth
nic minorities this year than
ever before.
This year's yield — the
percentage of students offered
admission who choose to attend
Stanford — was 60 percent. The
yield has fluctuated between 60
and 64 percent for the past de
cade.
"We can take pride in the fact
that the yield rate has
remained stable during this pe
riod, when we are clearly ad
mitting an increasingly over
lapping set of students with
other highly selective univer
sities," said Dean of Undergrad
uate Admissions Jean Fetter.
Associate Dean of Under
graduate Admissions John
Bunnell said the yield for Jor
dan Scholars was 38 percent.
Though far lower than the over
all yield, it compares favorably
with the typical yield for the top
600 admits, which is histori
cally 43 percent, he said.
The numbers suggest the Jor
dan program, which seeks to
identify and honor the most
academically gifted students
who applied to Stanford, was
successful this year, Bunnell
said.
The program will be reviewed
again next fall, however, be
cause of controversy the pro
gram generated this spring,

Bunnell added.
Some students and faculty
members have objected to the
program on the grounds it is
elitist and inappropriate for
Stanford .
Stanford offered admission to
90 students off the wait list this
year, even though use of the
wait list was the exception, not
the rule, across the country, ac
cording to a story in yesterday's
New York Times. Many schools,
including Stanford, expected

this year to be a lean one, since
the population of college age
students is on the decline.
Instead, applications in
creased. Stanford received
16,884 applications, an increase
of almost 5 percent over last
year.
According to the New York
Times article, schools were not
worried about the increase in
applications. They believed that
individual students were apply
ing to more schools, often as
many as 20. The schools used
that reasoning to admit a larger
percentage of applicants than
usual, and they still expected to
resort to the wait list to fill
their entering classes.
But the strategy backfired. It

eventually became clear there
were more applicants, not
simply more applications. Thus,
in what admissions officials ex
pected to be "the year of the
wait list", few schools ended up
consulting their lists at all.
Bunnell was uncertain why
Stanford used its wait list so ex
tensively despite a national
trend to the contrary. He sug
gested the "initial estimation
(of how many students to admit)
was somewhat conservative"
because Stanford's entering
classes have been too large in
the past few years.
Stanford offered admission to
2,565 students and 1,537 have
indicated they will attend this
fall, Provost James Rosse told

the Faculty Senate June 11.
For the first time, ethnic
minorities will comprise over a
third of the entering class. The
new class includes 131 blacks
(8.5 percent), an increase of 20
percent over last year, 244
Asian Americans (15.9 per
cent), 127 Mexican Americans
(8.3 percent) and 14 American
Indians (0.9 percent).
Over half of those who were
offered admission to Stanford
but declined to attend will en
roll at Harvard, Yale, Princeton
or MIT.
Only 33 percent of the incom
ing freshmen students are from
California, down from 43 per
cent in 1982. The percentage
from New York is up to 7 per
cent from 6 percent last year,
Texas to 5 percent from 4 per
cent and Illinois to 5 percent
from 3 percent.
Fetter also noted that since
1984, the number of applicants
scoring 1400 or more on the
Scholastic Aptitude Test is up
75 percent, from 1,536 to 2,683.
In addition, one third of the en
tering class, 541, have SAT
scores over 1400, up 50 percent.
