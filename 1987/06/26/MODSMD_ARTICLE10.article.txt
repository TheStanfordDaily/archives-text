# Conservatism reconsidered: a modest appeal
## 
### 
One of my favorite Bloom County comic
strips finds Opus, in typical pose, snoozing
in an easy chair in front of the television.
The evening news is on. First news item:
"White House spokesman Larry Speakes
informed the press today that there will be
a budget surplus this year large enough to
cover the national debt." Opus perks up.
News item two: "The Kremlin announced
this morning that communism is a
repressive failure and that free elections
will be held next Tuesday." Opus snaps to
attention. And finally: "Today's last news
item: At a news conference this afternoon,
conservative columnists William F. Buck
ley and George Will laid out their plans to
establish a legal defense fund for gay
welfare cheats." Credulity shattered. Opus
catches on: "They had me going there for a
minute," he says, as the announcer chimes
in, "Just seeing if you were paying atten
tion."

As we, his loyal readership, know, Berke
Breathed is something of a comic genius. In
this instance, he is savvy enough to recog
nize the transition from the merely incredi
ble to the patently absurd and knows how
to use it to best advantage. The bit with
Buckley and Will resolves the situation
perfectly. Breathed simply combines two of
this country's most prominent conserva
tives with what (you must confess) is not
the most improbable of liberal causes and
voila — he's got a funny comic strip.
It occurs to me, though, that the situation
would not be nearly as funny if we were to
substitute, say, "Ted Kennedy and Alan
Cranston laid out their plans today to es
tablish a network of fundamentalist Chris
tian ministries to raise funds to purchase
tear-gas for the South African govern
ment." A few callous souls might laugh, but
for the most part people would think it too
serious an issue in which to find amuse
ment.
This, I believe, is because liberals and
conservatives alike have largely given up
their satiric license when it comes to the pet
causes of the American left. The taboo asso

ciated with "insensitivity" is potent and
widespread. It is the inevitable conse
quence of the self-righteousness in which
liberals shroud both themselves and their
causes.

It is worth noting, however, that as un
remittingly serious as American liberals
can be, they do not generally take their con
servative counterparts all that seriously.
Most liberals would concede that Buckley
or Will might be able to articulate a
reasonable case for a given conservative
policy — but the run-of-the-mill conserva
tive? Unlikely.
The conservative of liberal lore would
doubtlessly resort to those bromides about
traditional values for which conservatives
— thoughtful and otherwise — are so
notorious. Worst of all, as liberals would
have it, conservatives are repulsed by the
silliest of things — mostly progressive
causes like judicial activism, "nationalist"
movements in the Third World and legal
defense funds for gay welfare cheats.
Even a sympathetic observer like Conor
Cruise O'Brien (Irish academic, UN
diplomat and a regular contributor to the
Atlantic Monthly) notes the liberal inclina
tion to give short shrift to conservative po
litical thought. In his introduction to
Burke's "Reflections on the Revolution in
France," O'Brien writes, "The intellectual
left — though with some notable exceptions
— has a strong tendency to neglect its ad
versaries and to dismiss their most influen
tial writings, unread, with a sneer. This is
associated, I believe, with another
pronounced tendency on the left: that which
runs to misunderstanding and underes
timating the forces opposed to it."
O'Brien's appeal is on behalf of Burke. I

wish to direct mine elsewhere: to conserva
tive magazines. I must admit that I do not
share O'Brien's enthusiasm for seeing the
left improve its intellectual reconnaissance.
Rather, I have two purposes: first, that con
servative thought receive the consideration
it so justly deserves; second, that more
people be won over to what seems to me a
profoundly sensible way to look at the
world.
Contemporary conservative thought
(unlike some contemporary conservatives,
I'm afraid) is neither simplistic, inhumane,
greed-ridden nor just plain skewed. One of
the best places to see this is in various
widely-available conservative periodicals.
The three which I would recommend (read:
the only three to which I have ever sub
scribed or read with any regularity) are Na
tional Review, The American Spectator,
and Commentary. Each has its virtues.
National Review, despite Ronald
Reagan's having once said that it "is to the
offices of the West Wing of the White House
what People magazine is to your dentist's
waiting room," provides intelligent, hard
hitting political coverage and commentary.
The American Spectator, always ir
reverent, sometimes biting, represents a
unique, if occasionally harsh, perspective
on the contemporary scene. And finally, if
the other two do not prove to be substantial
enough, Commentary is as scholarly and
thoughtful a journal as one could wish for.
(In fact, for better or worse, Commentary
seems to keep a good half of the Hoover In
stitution's staff busy at any given time.)
These magazines are neither inter
changeable nor predictable (cases in point:
two recent cover articles —"A Conservative
State the Case for Gay Rights" in National
Review and "Top Dud," a review of "Top
Gun," in The American Spectator). Each
provides a fair sampling of an attitude
toward political and social life which is
hard to find in the liberal complacence that
dominates the Stanford community.
Here at Stanford, we pride ourselves on
dabbling in many things. Occasionally
reading conservative magazines is not
quite like nurturing a casual interest in
Reggae or Japanese art, but its rewards are
no less real. It is as easy as resisting the
urge to pick up the New Yorker, Newsweek
or Cosmopolitan and opting instead for
something else at the newsstand or on the
library shelf. Who knows, you might like it.
