## Herbert Hoover led drive to introduce Stanford tuition 
### C.R. DOUGLAS Editorial staff 
When the Board of Trustees
approved a 6 percent tuition in
crease in February — driving
undergraduate tuition to a
record $11,880 a year — stu
dents, accustomed to such an
nual annoucements, barely lis
tened.
But in 1919 — 28 years after
Stanford opened its doors —
students were vituperative
when the trustees, urged by
board member Herbert Hoover
(Class of '95), announced that
the University would begin
charging tuition of $120 a year.
Hoover answered the out
bursts with a lengthy letter
published in the student news
paper, The Daily Palo Alto.
"It is up to me to take the sole
responsibility for this recent ac
tion taken by the trustees. I
have been an advocate (of re
quiring tuition) for the past six
years, and (University) Presi
dent Ray Wilbur has been able
to agree only in the last ex
tremity," Hoover admitted.
Until 1919 Stanford charged
no tuition. The University's in
vestment securities — pur
chased with proceeds from sales
of Stanford's non-Palo Alto land
holdings — amounted to $1.1
million and covered the entire
cost of educating students.
Understandably, most stu
dents wanted Stanford to
remain tuition-free. Charging

tuition, they argued, would
drive out the poorer students.
But more importantly, it would
spoil the original intentions of
founders Leland and Jane Stan
ford — who, many believed,
wished tuition costs to be paid
by the large income generated
from the proceeds of their land
sales.
But in the same letter Hoover
opposed those who sought eco
nomic refuge in arguing that
the "original intent" of the
founders was against a Stanford
tuition.
"Fifteen years ago Mrs. Stan
ford proposed that tuition
should be charged whenever the
trustees agree that it is neces
sary in order to maintain the
efficiency and continue the ex
pansion of the institution,"
Hoover observed.
Since 1914, it had become in
creasingly difficult for the Uni
versity to advance salaries and
buy educational materials. By
1919, the purchasing power of
the endowment income had
been halved.
Though nearly everyone
agreed that the University's en
dowment could no longer cover
the cost of maintaining a high
level of education at Stanford,
the deficit was understood dif
ferently.
Hoover blamed World War I
for the University's economic
plight. But some students, al
though aware of the country's
post-war economic hardships,

believed the problem had more
to do with the University's
spendthriftiness.
"What is a quarter million
dollars to an institution which
can erect a magnificent library
and an expensive pretentious
mansion for the University

president during a time when
materials and labor, are more
dear and more scarce than
during any time within our
memory?" one student ques
tioned in a letter to The Daily
Palo Alto.
Students, while aware of the

need to beef up salaries, argued
that they would be forced to
drop out of the University.
Hoover's response has some
relevance.
"If I may be permitted to
mention the subject, the num
bers of autos amongst the stu
dents and the receipts of the ice
cream parlors in the neighbor
hood would go a long way
toward the needed increase of
income, and would seem to
prove that a large portion of the
students can pay this charge
without depriving them of edu
cation," Hoover observed.
But Hoover and the other
trustees were sympathetic to
the sizable proportion of stu
dent body — they estimated be
tween 30 and 35 percent —
unable to meet the financial
burden of tuition. For this
group they devised a loan pro
gram — similar to today's fi
nancial aid — to insure that all
Stanford students, despite their
financial situation, could
remain enrolled. And they did
more.
"To make it doubly sure that
no injustice is done and that no
person from this institution can
say that through the action of
the trustees he has been
deprived of the opportunity of
education, a fund has been
placed in the hands of the presi
dent that is available to any
student who can show that the
