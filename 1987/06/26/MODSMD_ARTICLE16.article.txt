# Children's Hospital to raise funds
## 
### LIZ LEMPERT 
Offering loving care to children who are sick
today and searching for new knowledge to
keep tomorrow's children healthy is the mis
sion of the Children's Hospital at Stanford.
This Sunday it hopes to raise over $400,000 in
an annual telethon to further that cause.
"The Children's Hospital at Stanford is a
place where kids come to get well. Today many
of our young patients go home completely
cured of diseases like cancer and leukemia. To
morrow we will be able to help those who are
beyond the reach of today's medicine," Diar
muid McGuire of the hospital's community af
fairs department said.
Sunday's telethon — called "Children's Day
Around the Bay" — will be broadcast from 2 to
5 p.m. on KRON-TV (Channel 4) from several
locations, including the Stanford Shopping
Center.
At least one Stanford group will be present.
The campus chapter of Pi Beta Phi will be
presenting a $1,550 donation, the proceeds
from a pizza party benefit the sorority held for
the hospital. "We very much appreciate the
support we get from Stanford students,"
McGuire said. "In fact, the relationship be

tween the Children's Hospital and the Stan
ford student body goes way back," he noted.
Until 1964, Stanford students would visit
the Children's Hospital — then called the Con
valescent Home — to participate in "Con
Home Week." Students were very active and
brought in a significant amount of money to
the hospital, according to McGuire.
"During the late '60s, student attention
shifted away from the hospital, and the tradi
tion of student participation died out. But we'd
like to see people get interested again. It would
be really heartwarming to see a new genera
tion involved with the hospital again," said
McGuire.
The money earned from the telethon will
fund a number of different hospital services in
cluding a family health education library, a
new ultrasound scanner and medical research.
Donations will also be used to help patients
who are unable to afford treatment. "We want
to be able to offer care for every child who
needs help, and since treatment is very expen
sive, almost never can a family afford all
costs," McGuire explained.
In addition, the telethon proceeds will go to
the New Children's Hospital fund.
