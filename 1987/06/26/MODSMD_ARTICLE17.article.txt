## The 						Replacements: playing just one step beyond 
### DANIEL GRANT 
When the Replacements des
cend on One Step Beyond Mon
day, remember the one rule
that they play and live by:
There are no rules.
That may sound like a cliche
until you experience one of
their shows. It isn't unusual
during a Replacement show for

a fan to jump on stage and start
singing lead, for band members
to switch to instruments they
can't play or for them to start
spontaneously banging out
cover tunes — be it R.E.M.'s
"Radio Free Europe," Lynyrd
Skynyrd's "Sweet Home Ala
bama" or KISS' "Calling Dr.
Love" — in any chord they hap
pen to be playing.

At first glance it is easy to
dimiss the Replacements as
sloppy and obnoxious. But with
such critically acclaimed al
bums as "Hootenanny," "Let it
Be" and "Tim," they have
emerged as one of the most im
portant bands of the '80s. "Tim"
was called one of the best al
bums of 1985 by everyone from
Rolling Stone to Time maga
zine, and the Replacements new
album, "Pleased to Meet Me," is
receiving the same enthusiastic
response.
The New Trouser Press
Record Guide wrote, "Chris
Mars drums like he's possessed,
Tommy Stinso is a spoiled teen

(he was 12 when the band
started) but thumps a mean
bass line and Paul Westerberg
— too terrified to sing his soft
songs — hides behind the
band's noise. (They] are one of
the classic rock 'n' roll combos
whose music, looks and person
alities fit together perfectly; the
stuff of which legends are
made."
The Replacements are one of
the few bands today who still
embody the true spirit of rock
and roll: rebellious, spontan
eous, unpretentious and imper
fect as an art form.
Lead singer Paul Westerberg
believes there are a lot of bands

that make mistakes, "but we're
the only ones who are proud of
them. We're not great
musicians and if we ever make
it, we'd like to say we got there
on personality and persistence.
Sometimes we feel we're the
only band with the right idea."
When Sire, the Replace
ments' record company, wanted
them to make a video, Wester
berg told them the group didn't
want to be filmed. "We're not
comfortable doing anything but
playing live. They suggested we
do a live video, but we said that
defeats the purpose of touring.
People can see us in the flesh if
they want."
In the last two years, the
Replacements have become
tighter and more in control on
stage and usually save their
"surprise" songs for the end of a
set.
Opening the show is a Seattle
country-punk band, the Young
Fresh Fellows. Judging from
their new album, "The Men
Who Loved Music," they should
prove to be quite unpredictable.
Favorite song titles include:
"Get Outta My Cave" and"I Got
My Mojo Working (And I
Thought You'd Like to Know)."
Cover charge for the 9 p.m.
concert at One Step Beyond
(1400 Martin Ave. in Santa
Clara) will be $6 for those 18
and over and $8 for those under
18. Doors open at 8 p.m.
