The Untouchables ***★
Palo Alto Square
(Corner of El C amino and Page Mill,
Palo Alto)
Kevin Costner plays a young treasury
agent, Elliot Ness, who is hell-bent on
bringing down the mafia organization of A 1
Capone (Robert De Niro). Sean Connery is
the grizzled beat officer Jimmy Malone who
teaches the naive Ness that he can only
beat the mob by playing Capone's own bru
tal game.
"The Untouchables" will not disappoint
expecting fans of director John De Palma,
whose films generally include a high level
of violence. This element may turn others
off. One scene shows Capone smashing the
head of a poorly performing associate with
a baseball bat — his blood pooling on the
white-linened dinner table. In another, one
of Ness' assistants is machine-gunned to
death and then drags himself through his
house — leaving a river of blood.
Not since "The Godfather" have I seen a
movie that so aptly portrays the mob with

such brutal realism.
Predator * %
Century 10
1500 Sterlin Road, Mountain View
Arnold Schwarznegger leads an elite
band of commandos, sent and accompanied
by the deceitful Carl "Apollo Creed" Weath
ers, on a jungle mission to rescue some
captured diplomats. On their way out of the
jungle, the heroes meet a vertical-mouthed,
icky-faced alien who hunts men for sport.
I've never wanted to like a movie more than
I wanted to like "Predator" — but I still
ended up hating it. The acting was pathetic,
even for a muscle-and-guns action film.
But not even the plethora of bad acting is
able to distract from the inconsistencies of
"Predator." The alien is too powerful. It can
see through trees, is invisible, has
computer-tracking vision, can't be hurt by
any of the guns the commandos carry, uses
super-destructo vision and even packs
something like an atom bomb for emergen
cies. Having it hunt men is analogous to
having a trained sharpshooter with an Uzi
hunt a tied-down Bambi. But the alien has

one flaw that Arnie discovers: It can't see
through mud. Convenient, huh? I don't buy
it. There's more, but it's not worth talking
about.
Hollywood Shuffle *
Aquarius
430 Emerson St., Palo Alto
Robert Townsend is not only the star of
this low-budget comedy, he's the writer, di
rector and producer. Townsend plays a
young black actor forced to decide between
working at Winky Dinky Dog's hot dog
stand and taking the starring role in a
movie that stereotypically portrays blacks.
While there are some bright spots to
"Shuffle" — most notably Townsend's per
forming talents, a worthy theme and a few
jokes — by and large this movie stinks. The
laughs are few and far between and inevita
bly squeezed for all they're worth.
The humor and serious themes of the film
are haphazardly mixed and abruptly
switched, leaving the audience silent
during the humorous parts and wondering
whether the serious parts should be
laughed at.
