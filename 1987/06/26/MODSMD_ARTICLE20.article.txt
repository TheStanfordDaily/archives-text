## Olympics, NBA draft cause confusion 
### 
Anyone who has picked up a paper
recently knows that there have been
violent protests in South Korea of
late — and it seems unlikely they will
end anytime soon. That means the
specter of civil war will loom larger
over South Korea in the coming
months.

It is also common knowledge that
the 1988 Summer Olympic Games
are scheduled to begin in a little over
14 months in Seoul, the site of most of
ihe protests. As things stand, athletes
from many countries, including the
United States, will probably skip the
games.
It would be a shame if many of the
world's top athletes lost another
chance to compete against one an
other because countries decided it
would be better to keep their people
home than to have them risk their
lives in South Korea.
The South Koreans had hoped to
use the games to show off thier eco
nomic progress to the world. All the
Olympic venues are already built and

if the games began tomorrow the
South Koreans would be ready to hold
them. As recently as a month ago it
seemed that everything was going
smoothly. Now it looks like the roof is
caving in.
The International Olympic Com
mittee is aware of the situation and
has drawn up a contingency plan. If
the situation in South Korea does not
improve soon the games will either be
held in Berlin or Los Angeles. New
York City Mayor Ed Koch has offered
to hold the games in his city.
Don't be surprised if the lOC an
nounces that the games will not be
held in South Korea and don't be
surprised if they announce it before
the end of the summer. They are
trying hard to make sure everyone
shows up for the games for the first
time since 1976.

The NBA draft was held Monday
and, as everyone expected, the San
Antonio Spurs selected Navy star
David Robinson with the first pick.
Robinson's two-year commitment
with the Navy means that he does not
have to sign with the Spurs and could
become a free agent instead, offering
his services to the highest bidder.
But Robinson is not a crybaby
primadonna like John Elway, nor is

he a loudmouthed lout like Brian
Bosworth; he has not publicly an
nounced that he will only play for one
of his "preferred teams."
Robinson is instead an intelligent
young man and a quality individual.
Because of this, I believe that he will
sign with the Spurs soon after the
moratorium on signing draftees
comes to an end.
The draft did provide its share of
surprises, however. The Washington
Bullets chose Tyrone "Muggsy"
Bogues from Wake Forest with the
12th pick. If they play the diminutive
Bogues, who is only 5 feet 3 inches
tall, at the same time as basketball's
only human flagpole, 7-foot-7-inch
Manute 801, they can probably
surprise opposing teams by having
Bogues run through Bol's legs on the
way to the basket.
Credit must be given to the entire
league — especially the Indiana
Pacers, who had to ignore thousands
of screaming hometown fans — for
not drafting Steve Alford in the first
round. Little Stevie is a great shooter,
but his complete inability to play
defense and the fact that he usually
needs a double screen to get off one of
his lovely jumpers will earn Alford
the age-old epithet "great college
player, couldn't make it in the pros."
