# Three advance, five gone at Wimbledon
## 
### 
Rain in June is not something many Stan
ford students come to expect. But for the
many former Cardinal tennis stars playing
at Wimbledon, rain is something that must
be dealt with.
Dreary describes the English weather this
time of year. With all matches canceled yes
terday due to rain, the tournament is now
more than two days behind. Three former
Stanford stars were not bothered, however,
as they advanced to the second round.
Tim Mayotte, the 10th seed and a strong
contender for the championship, began with
a 6-2, 6-3, 6-3 win over Jean Fleurian.
Mayotte, a two-time Ail-American, left
Stanford in 1981 after becoming the NCAA
singles champion that year.
Scott Davis, '83, a three-time All-
American on the Farm, also won handily,
beating David De Miguel 6-1, 6-1, 6-3.
Patty Fendick, '87, playing in her first
tournament as a professional, posted a 6-1,
6-4 win over Katerina Bohmova on the
women's side. Fendick was a four-time Ail-
American and a two-time NCAA singles
champ at Stanford and a doubles finalist at
Wimbledon last year.
On the other side of the coin, Jim Grabb,
'86; Dan Goldie, '86; Kate Gompert, '84;
Kathy Jordan,' 79 and Marianne Werdel,
who left Stanford in '86, all lost their first
round matches.
