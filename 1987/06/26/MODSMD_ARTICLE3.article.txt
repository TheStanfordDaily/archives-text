# Popper named Hoover fellow

Eminent philosopher Sir Karl Pop
per has been appointed a senior re
search fellow at the Hoover Institu
tion, acting Director John Cogan an
nounced last month.
The 85-year-old Popper, who is ex
pected to be in residence at Hoover
only occasionally, has made major
contributions in the areas of political
philosophy, the philosophy of science,
history and art criticism.
One of his biographers, Brian
Magee, writes that "since the death of
Bertrand Russell there is no philoso
pher writing in English who can
match Karl Popper in range or in the
quality of his influence."
Popper's falsificationist theory of

knowledge — first presented in"The
Logic of Scientific Discovery" — is
believed by many to have
revolutionized the nature of science.
He maintains that what makes a
theory scientific is both its simplicity
and its testability. The more open to
disagreement, criticism and contest
of ideas, the more rational a scientific
theory becomes.
Popper has repeatedly denounced
the theories of Plato, Karl Marx, Sig
mund Freud and G.W.F. Hegel as
pseudoscientific and metaphysical.
His best-known work, "The Open
Society and its Enemies," criticizes
communism and Nazism. According
to Charles Palm, chief archivist at
Hoover, the book argues that "as in
science, where freedom and competi

tion are important elements in the
search for scientific truths, so in
politics the freedom of debate and
competition are necessary in found
ing political truths."
Popper criticizes any scientific the
ory that attempts to evade criticism
or insulate ideas through im
penetrable language. He labels the
philosophical contributions of such
groups as the left-wing Frankfurt
School as intellectually dishonest in
their ambiguity and inaccessibility.
The Hoover collection includes over
400 boxes of Popper's papers, includ
ing the original manuscripts of "The
Open Society and its Enemies" and
another widely acclaimed work, "The
Poverty of Historicism."
