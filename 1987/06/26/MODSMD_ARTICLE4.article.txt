# Hoover head, ex-dean OKd suspect memo

### A.J.THOMAS Editorial staff 
The director of the Hoover Institution and a
former dean of the Law School approved a contro
versial 1985 legal opinion stating that the White
House could legally provide military aid to the
Nicaraguan contras, according to testimony ear
lier this month at the Iran-contra hearings.
Bretton Sciaroni, attorney for the President's
Intelligence Oversight Board (IOB), testified that
board members W. Glenn Campbell, director of
the Hoover Institution, and Charles Meyers,
dean of the Law School until 1981, reviewed the
opinion before Sciaroni submitted it to then Na
tional Security Adviser Robert McFarlane.
Sciaroni's memorandum concluded that the
Boland Amendment's prohibition on against the
contras did not apply to the National Security
Council. He also found that "none of Lt. Col.
(Oliver) North's activities during the past year
constitutes a violation of the Boland Amend
ment."
The 1984 amendment, named for its sponsor
Rep. Edward Boland, D-Mass., prohibits any
"agency or entity involved in intelligence activ
ity" from "directly or indirectly" providing mili
tary support to the rebels.
Because the NSC does not participate in the ac
tual gathering of intelligence or other field oper
ations, it does not count as a member of the intel
ligence community, Sciaroni said.
Sciaroni said that on only "rare occasions" in
the past has the NSC had operational activities.
President Reagan has also claimed the amend
ment does not apply to his activities or those of
the NSC.
However, Reagan has not specifically cited the
legal advice of the 108 as the basis for his
opinion on the Boland Amendment.
"I am not aware that anyone ever relied upon
[the opinion]" Sciaroni told the congressional
panel.
Sciaroni said no one in the administration
asked the 108 for legal advice, but that he wrote
his memorandum after reading press accounts in
August 1985 that claimed the NSC was illegally
assisting the contras.
Campbell, who is chairman of the three
member 108, was appointed to the post by
Reagan in 1981. Meyers, who was dean of the
Law School from 1977 to 1981, has been a mem
ber of the board since 1982.
When asked specifically if his legal opinion
had "the weight of the analysis of Charles
Meyers as well," Sciaroni replied that it did.
The third member of the board is businessman
Charles Tyroler, a Democrat with ties to the
Committee on the Present Danger, a private or
ganization advocating a strong defense.
Campbell is also on the board of directors of that
organization.
Sciaroni, who onced worked at the Hoover In
stitution himself, said the 108 met in September
of 1985 on the day the opinion was issued. The
board considered and approved it, finding that
Sciaroni's research had been ad
equate, Sciaroni testified.
"The [lOB] reviews every
thing that I do and invariably
makes changes," he said.
Sciaroni interviewed the le
gal counsel to the NSC, Cmdr.
Paul Thompson, for approxi
mately half an hour. Sciaroni
said Thompson gave him a
stack of documents "about an
inch thick" that did not include
important relevant memoranda
from North to McFarlane.
Sciaroni said he also asked
North about the press allega
tions that the USC was illegally
aiding the contras and received
a blanket denial of any
wrongdoing. Sciaroni said the
meeting with North lasted
about five minutes.

Sciaroni said he did not talk
with the reporters who had
written the stories or with
members of Congress and did
not ask for additional NSC doc
uments.

Sciaroni said he felt
Thompson gave him inadequate
and incomplete information,
but refused to speculate
whether Thompson deliberately
misled him.

Committee members sharply
criticized Sciaroni for the cur
sory nature of his investigation.
Sciaroni said neither he nor
the 108 were effective in the in
vestigation.

"We were unfortunately
precluded from doing our job in
this case," he said.
Sciaroni, who failed four bar
examinations before passing
the Pennsylvania test, under

went stiff questioning about his
credentials.
Sciaroni had never practiced
law before becoming counsel to
the 108, and his 1985 legal
opinion on the Boland Amend
ment was the first legal opinion
he had ever written about a
piece of legislation, he said.
Although the 108 is supposed
to report directly to the presi
dent, Sciaroni explained that in
the "decentralized Reagan sys
tem" the 108 forwards its find
ings to the national security ad
viser, who acts as the represen
tative of the president.
The 108 was created during
the Ford administration to in
form the president of intelli

gence activities that 108 mem
bers believe to be illegal and to
conduct such investigations as
they deem necessary.
According to Boland, who is a
member of the investigating
committee, Sciaroni's opinion
'is apparently the only legal
analysis done in the White
House on the statutory restric
tions on provisions of assistance
to the contras.
'Think about that, and con
sider what it tells us about the
value the White House placed
on adhering to the laws which
have so occupied our attention
over the last five weeks,"
Boland added.
