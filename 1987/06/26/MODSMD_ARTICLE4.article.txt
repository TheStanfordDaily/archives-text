### A.J.THOMAS Editorial staff 
The director of the Hoover Institution and a
former dean of the Law School approved a contro
versial 1985 legal opinion stating that the White
House could legally provide military aid to the
Nicaraguan contras, according to testimony ear
lier this month at the Iran-contra hearings.
Bretton Sciaroni, attorney for the President's
Intelligence Oversight Board (IOB), testified that
board members W. Glenn Campbell, director of
the Hoover Institution, and Charles Meyers,
dean of the Law School until 1981, reviewed the
opinion before Sciaroni submitted it to then Na
tional Security Adviser Robert McFarlane.
Sciaroni's memorandum concluded that the
Boland Amendment's prohibition on against the
contras did not apply to the National Security
Council. He also found that "none of Lt. Col.
(Oliver) North's activities during the past year
constitutes a violation of the Boland Amend
ment."
The 1984 amendment, named for its sponsor
Rep. Edward Boland, D-Mass., prohibits any
"agency or entity involved in intelligence activ
ity" from "directly or indirectly" providing mili
tary support to the rebels.
Because the NSC does not participate in the ac
tual gathering of intelligence or other field oper
ations, it does not count as a member of the intel
ligence community, Sciaroni said.
Sciaroni said that on only "rare occasions" in
the past has the NSC had operational activities.
President Reagan has also claimed the amend
ment does not apply to his activities or those of
the NSC.
However, Reagan has not specifically cited the
legal advice of the 108 as the basis for his
opinion on the Boland Amendment.
"I am not aware that anyone ever relied upon
[the opinion]" Sciaroni told the congressional
panel.
Sciaroni said no one in the administration
asked the 108 for legal advice, but that he wrote
his memorandum after reading press accounts in
August 1985 that claimed the NSC was illegally
assisting the contras.
Campbell, who is chairman of the three
member 108, was appointed to the post by
Reagan in 1981. Meyers, who was dean of the
Law School from 1977 to 1981, has been a mem
ber of the board since 1982.
When asked specifically if his legal opinion
had "the weight of the analysis of Charles
Meyers as well," Sciaroni replied that it did.
The third member of the board is businessman
Charles Tyroler, a Democrat with ties to the
Committee on the Present Danger, a private or
ganization advocating a strong defense.
Campbell is also on the board of directors of that
organization.
Sciaroni, who onced worked at the Hoover In
stitution himself, said the 108 met in September
of 1985 on the day the opinion was issued. The
board considered and approved it, finding that
