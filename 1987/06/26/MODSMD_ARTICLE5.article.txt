# Synergy proposal to be considered by Res Ed
## 
### EMMA STERLAND 
The Office of Residential Education is
considering a proposal submitted by
Synergy residents which would prevent
Synergy from losing its status as a co-op.
Jon Traugott and Eden Quainton sub
mitted the proposal June 11 in response
to the University's decision last month
to change Synergy's status from co-op to
self-op.
Students in co-op houses do their own
cooking and cleaning while residents of
self-ops do their own cleaning but hire a
professional cook.
The proposal would give Synergy resi
dents the option of doing their own

cooking and cleaning or paying other
residents to do it for them.
The University changed Synergy's
classification because the house was
unable to fill 14 of its 33 residence spaces
after the second round of the Draw, ac
cording to Rodger Whitney, assistant
dean of student affairs and director of
student housing.
Some of the other changes recom
mended in the proposal are:
• Appointing a faculty adviser who
would not live in the house but would
visit from time to time to advise on co-op
management,
•Offering a workshop for next year's res
ident assistants on the value of life in a

cooperative,
•Reorganizing the co-op council,
•Making certain physical improvements
in the house and
•Appointing a resident fellow for the co
ops as a group.
Residents of Synergy also have been
organizing other resistance to the Uni
versity's decision. Traugott and Glenn
Smith, another Synergy resident, have
collected the names of 90 students on a
petition that reads, "I would prefer to
live in Synergy rather than any other
choice if it would mean that Synergy
would remain a co-op."
Synergy has had difficulty filling its
undergraduate assigned spaces for

several years. Director of the Row Diana
Conklin said Synergy "needs to do out
reach" to fill its spaces.
"The University doesn't need to be*
convinced (of the value of co-ops), stu
dents do, and the time for that was
before June," she added.
Conklin said that although Res Ed is
considering Synergy's latest proposal,
the petition has had no impact on the
University's decision.
"The proposal suggests changes," she
said. "But the petition simply suggests
keeping Synergy as it is and that's not
an option. That's not possible."
Res Ed will announce its response to
the proposal on Tuesday, Conklin said.
