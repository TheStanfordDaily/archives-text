Officials linked to Iran cover- up
WASHINGTON — A senior Justice Department official
and newly released documents Thursday provided evidence of
systematic efforts by senior administration officials last No
vember to cover up and falsify information bearing on the
Iran-contra affair.
Assistant Attorney General Charles Cooper, testifying at
the Iran-contra hearings, described how he found himself in a
meeting of senior officials who, he later realized, were embel
lishing a phony story about a November 1985 shipment of
arms to Iran. Cooper said the officials claimed they thought
the shipment was a shipment of oil-drilling equipment. He
also told how he and two Justice Department associates
looking into the affair for Attorney General Edwin Meese 111
learned that profits from arms sales to Iran had been diverted
to the Nicaraguan contras.
Rep. Bill McCollum, R-Fla., referring to Cooper's testimony
that North, the late CIA Director William Casey and former
national security advisers John Poindexter and Robert
McFarlane had all misled the attorney general about a No
vember 1985 shipment of Hawk missiles to Iran, said "If it's
not a crime, it's certainly one of the highest acts of insubor
dination and one of the most treacherous things that's ever
occurred to a president, it seems to me, in our history."
Unrest threatens, Olympic games
SEOUL, South Korea — News of disruptions during sport
ing events earlier this month at the outset of recent social un
rest in this country has prompted rumblings abroad that
Seoul is perhaps incapable of hosting next year's Summer
Olympics.
The news has also horrified officials and many members of
the public here. Few things are more important to South
Korea than playing host to the games its newspapers call "a
great festival of mankind."
For that reason, the Olympics are likely to be a critical fac
tor as President Chun Doo Hwan tries to find a way to solve
the current political crisis. He must somehow restore order,
but not through means that would leave his government open
to charges of heavy-handed tactics unfitting for an Olympic
host.
Both leaders of the South Korean opposition have said the
games would be at risk if Chun refuses to give way to their
demands for a democratically elected government, it was re
ported Thursday. One of these leaders, Kim Dae Jung, said
that only the realization of democracy could guarantee the
games' success, while the other, Kirn Young Sam, said that
without a democratically elected government "the Olympic
Games will be very, very difficult, almost impossible to hold."
Gorbachev calls for major changes
MOSCOW — Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev, in a major
speech Thursday to the country's leading policymaking body,
criticized opponents of reform in the Communist party and
government bureaucracy for lagging behind the "economic,
social and spiritual" process in the country. Gorbachev also
called for drastic changes in the Soviet economy to be carried
out by the end of this year.
The 56-year-old head of the Soviet Communist party, who
admitted his first two years in power had produced only
"insignificant" changes, outlined plans for a major reorgani
zation of the Soviet economy that would involve "radical"
change in the pricing system and the revamping of the
central planning mechanism to grant more responsibility to
managers at the local level.
The strongly worded speech, delivered before a regular
meeting of the 307-member Central Committee, marks a new
phase in Gorbachev's program of restructuring the Soviet eco
nomy as he shifts his reform strategy away from piecemeal
change toward a focus on the transition from an "excessively
centralized command system" to one of greater "self
management."
Waldheim meets with John Paul
VATICAN CITY — Austrian President Kurt Waldheim
was formally received in a state visit Thursday by Pope John
Paul 11, and Waldheim said afterward that they had talked
about accusations that he committed war crimes during
World War II crimes.
Protesters outside the Vatican directed derisive shouts of
"Shame!" and "Hangman!" at Waldheim as the Austrian
leader arrived for his meeting with the pontiff.
Waldheim told reporters that he and the pope had talked
privately about the furor aroused by the pope's reception of
Waldheim.
"Yes, I talked with Pope John Paul II this morning about
the accusations leveled against me about what I'm alleged to
have done during the war, but in a marginal way," he said.
Waldheim has been accused of aiding the deportation of
40,000 Jews from Greece, of complicity in the deaths of
Yugoslav partisans and of mistreatment of Allied war
prisoners when he was a German army officer during World
War 11.
