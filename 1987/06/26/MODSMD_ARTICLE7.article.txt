Notes written in invisible ink and documents
and photos associated with Russian revolution
ary Leon Trotsky have been discovered in the
Hoover Institution among a collection of histori
cal papers, Hoover archivists recently an
nounced.
The most significant work is a series of drafts
of Trotsky's "History of the Russian Revolution,"
an account of the 1917 revolution and Joseph
Stalin's subsequent rise to power.
"Trotsky's work is one of the most detailed and
precise histories of the Russian Revolution," said
archive specialist Michael Jakobson, who, along
with assistant archivist Dale Reed, found the 30
linear feet of papers in Hoover's Boris
Nicolaevsky Collection.
A prominent item in the manuscript of the
book is a chapter titled "Soglashateli" (The Com
promisers) which concerns the unsuccessful
Kerensky-Krasnov counterrevolution of 1917.
This chapter was ultimately omitted from the
completed work and will be published "within a
very short time," said Reed.
The remainder of the Trotsky papers include
detailed drafts of more than 500 books and arti
cles, as well as 485 family letters — 254 of which
are from Trotsky to his son, Lev Sedov.
Trotsky's writings date from 1929 to 1940, the
period of his exile in Turkey, France, Norway
and Mexico.

The Hoover Institution purchased the entire
collection in 1963 from Nicolaevsky, its collector
and curator, who stipulated that the papers not
be examined until after his own death and that of
his wife Anna Bourgina.
After the death of Bourgina in 1982, and with
the financial support of the National Endowment
for the Humanities, research began that uncov
ered Trotsky's extensive writing.
In a revealing letter from Sedov to his mother
Natalia Trotsky dated April 16, 1936, the son
writes, "I think that all Dad's deficiencies have
not diminished as he grew older, but under the
influence of isolation — very difficult, unprece
dentedly difficult — gotten worse.
"His lack of tolerance, hot temper, inconsis
tency, even rudeness, his desire to humiliate, of
fend and destroy have increased," Sedov wrote.
These abundant personal writings make the
collection an "outstanding source of modern Rus
sian history," according to an article by Reed and
Jakobson in the April issue of American Histori
cal Review.
"You get a real flavor of the times from these
papers," Jakobson said, referring to a book of
Russian poetry in which Trotsky used invisible
ink to write a controversial letter to members of
Stalin's developing Communist party.
In addition, the Nicolaevsky collection con
tains the writings of revolutionary Victor Cher
nov and various Menshevik leaders of the 19th
and 20th centuries.
