# Batra forecasts big depression
## 
### BRIAN RHOADS Staff writer 
By 1990 a stock market
crash and depression will
wreak havoc on the world
economy, according to Ravi
Batra, professor of economics
at Southern Methodist Uni
versity, who spoke here Wed
nesday.
Batra, talking before about
35 people, predicted an eco
nomic disaster of proportions
unheard of in the last 60
years — an idea upon which
his book "The Great Depres
sion of 1990" is based.
Batra, a native of Punjab,
India, believes the U.S. eco
nomy fluctuates according to
historical cycles. He said that
through analysis of com
merce data collected since
1750, he found that inflation
peaks every 30 years and a
depression occurs every 60
years.
Using these cycles in the
past, Batra said he was able
to forecast correctly that in

flation would decrease in the
1980s, causing a natural drop
in interest rates.
The economist predicted an
extreme drop in inflation for
the 19905, much like the drop
that started the Great De
pression 60 years ago.
Batra said he is not a
fatalist. "Nothing is inevita
ble," he said, and offered the
following immediate solu
tions for the impending
crisis:
•Levying a 5 percent wealth
tax on that 1 percent of the
population that controls 34
percent of the country's
wealth,
•Prohibiting bank lending
for business takeovers — as
this creates an artificial rise
in stock prices and
•Barring banks from paying
interest on checking accounts
because this creates pressure
to lend unwisely.
Batra called on individuals
attending the meeting to
begin a grassroots "Stop the
Depression" movement.
