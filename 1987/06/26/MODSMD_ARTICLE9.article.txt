Stanford University's recent decision to join student ath
letes in a court challenge against the NCAA's national drug
testing policy is commendable. The University is, unlike the
majority of Division 1 schools, refusing to turn a blind eye to
the NCAA's blatant violations of individual rights and is in
stead confronting the issue directly.
Earlier this year, diver Simone LeVant won an injunction
against the NCAA, but it was declared moot because of her
graduation. Now Stanford has joined soccer player Jen Hill
in her suit against the association. With this action, the Uni
versity is both supporting its students against unfair
practices and upholding the standards upon which the school
is based.
Stanford is continuing to follow the same principles which
lie behind the Honor Code: trust in and respect for the indi
vidual. While other universities, such as UC-Berkeley, have
instituted drug-testing in their own athletic programs, Stan
ford has resisted such a move and various administrators
have spoken out against such policies.
The NCAA policy violates the California Constitution —
which explicitly guarantees a right to privacy — and the
principles of the U.S. Constitution. Although the NCAA
threatens to penalize Stanford if the University continues
the suit, saying that schools do not have a "constitutional
right'' to participate in intercollegiate athletics, the NCAA
itself does not have the constitutional right to invade
privacy. Despite its status as a national organization, the
NCAA has no more right to invade privacy than any particu
lar university or individual.
LeVant was the first student to challenge the NCAA's
policies; Stanford is the first school to challenge the practice.
Let's hope that other schools and athletes join the effort and
that Levant's initial successes are matched and surpassed.
