that encourages debate on ethical
issues related to science and tech
nology.
Student delegates at the confer

demic achievement and commit
ment to helping society choose
wisely about science and technol
ogy, according to organizers.
Roughly half of the delegates are
U.S. natives. The rest are foreign
ers studying in the United States
or in their home countries.
In his opening address, confer

ence director Benjamin Austin
said, "Our generation is credited
with a lot of things* One of these is
selfishness, and it strikes me that
the United States and individuals
of the 1980s have been generalized
as being concerned primarily with
their own material gratification.
"I think that people today are
very concerned with themselves,
but I believe they are also con
cerned with a lot of greater
things," Austin added.
Human Biology Chair Craig
Heller underlined the purpose of
the convention. "[Students] have
come here to spend a week discuss
ing and debating issues of science
and technology, ethics and politics,
