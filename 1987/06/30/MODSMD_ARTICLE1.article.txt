# Pugwash conference underway

### KIM SAILOR 
Over 100 vlwiuuts from 23
countries joined representatives of
business, science and government
here Sunday for the start of a
week-long conference on ethics in
science.
Student delegates and senior
participants at the Fifth Biennial
Student Pugwash International
Conference will discuss issues
ranging from reproductive technol
ogies to nuclear proliferation and
the international control of atomic
energy.
Symposia open to the public are
scheduled through Friday.
Research scientist Roger
Boisjoly, who warned NASA about
the faulty O-Ring that caused the

explosion of the space shuttle
Challenger, will give the confer
ence's keynote address Wednesday
at 7:30 p.m. in Kresge Auditorium.
Student Pugwash is an organiza
tion of college students and leaders
in business, science and education
that encourages debate on ethical
issues related to science and tech
nology.
Student delegates at the confer
ence were selected based on aca
demic achievement and commit
ment to helping society choose
wisely about science and technol
ogy, according to organizers.
Roughly half of the delegates are
U.S. natives. The rest are foreign
ers studying in the United States
or in their home countries.
In his opening address, confer

ence director Benjamin Austin
said, "Our generation is credited
with a lot of things* One of these is
selfishness, and it strikes me that
the United States and individuals
of the 1980s have been generalized
as being concerned primarily with
their own material gratification.
"I think that people today are
very concerned with themselves,
but I believe they are also con
cerned with a lot of greater
things," Austin added.
Human Biology Chair Craig
Heller underlined the purpose of
the convention. "[Students] have
come here to spend a week discuss
ing and debating issues of science
and technology, ethics and politics,

which are not simple academic
questions but crucial issues
which will at a minimum influ
ence the well-being of humans
worldwide, and at a maximum
determine the future of our
species and the future of our
planet," he said.
"No one out there is going to
help us. It's in our hands. Our
efforts must involve the devel
opment of a global ethic rather
than a special interest driving*
us forward. We no longer can af
ford the luxury of national
chauvinism," Heller added.

Richard Saul Wurman of
Access Press Limited concluded
Sunday's program by stressing
the importance of making infor
mation understandable. Wur
man said the "information glut
is an explosion of noninforma
tion. I don't think that much
around us, in newspapers or
magazines, clearly and simply
informs us."
Wurman, whose projects in
clude rewriting the Yellow
Pages in a more comprehensible
form — which he calls the
"Smart Yellow Pages" —
advised a return to "step one" in
explaining issues so they can be
easily understood and remem
bered.

An acre, he said, is "a little
smaller than an American foot
ball field without the end zones.
Nobody can forget that." Wur
man concluded by challenging
his listeners to put the word
"inform" back into "informa
tion."
Student Pugwash takes its
name from the first Pugwash
Conference on Science and
World Affairs held in Nova
Scotia in 1957. It marked the
first of a series of annual
meetings by senior scientists
dedicated to defining the re
sponsibility of the scientific
community in public affairs.
The original Pugwash confer
ences began at the behest of Al
bert Einstein and Bertrand
Russell, co-authors of "The Pug
wash Manifesto," a document
that urged scientists to think
carefully about their role in
world affairs.
Student Pugwash conferences
have been held at UC-San
Diego, Yale University, Univer
sity of Michigan and Princeton.
Planning for the 1987 confer
ence began well over a year ago.
The public is invited to attend
several panel discussions on
campus this week. On Tuesday,
a discussion on "Our Changing
View of Reproduction," will ad
dress issues such as surrogate
motherhood. It will begin at
10:30 a.m. in Kresge Audi
torium.
On Thursday at noon,
"Technology and Entertain
ment" will be discussed in
Bowman Oak Grove, and at
7:00 p.m. "Technology and
Democracy: How Good Are We
at Regulating Science and
Technology?" will be the topic
at the Exploratorium in San
Francisco.
On Friday, a symposium
titled "Sandoz, Bhopal, Cher
nobyl and Challenger: Rethink
ing Risk in the Aftermath" will
meet at 1:30 p.m. A slide show
and discussion titled, "At Work
in the Fields of the Bomb" will
conclude the conference. Both
will meet in Kresge.
Conference hosts include the
Programs in Human Biology
and Values, Technology, Sci
ence and Society, the Public
Service Center and Student
Pugwash USA.
