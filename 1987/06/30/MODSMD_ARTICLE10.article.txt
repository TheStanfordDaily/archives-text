## The
						Stanford Daily An Independent Newspaper Enforce rush policy 
### 
In his recent report concerning the April drowning of
junior David Dunshee, Assistant to the Provost Michael
Jackson recommends better enforcement of the rush alcohol
guidelines. However, he does not specifically show how to
achieve this goal.
Jackson's call for stricter support of the one-year-old
guidelines is a worthy one. But his vague demands for toug
her enforcement leave the area of police involvement uncer
tain. Now is the time to make a clear statement against this
practice which betrays the standard of trust upon which the
University operates.
Asking police to disrupt parties or check IDs — actions
that were prompted this spring by concern over underage
drinking on campus — is too extreme. Some underage stu
dents will drink. Trying to eliminate this through police in
terference would be an oversimplified solution that could
only create more problems.
The University's drinking policy is often under fire be
cause of the freedom it allows. But this freedom rests upon
the trust that students will behave responsibly toward alco
hol — an attitude that a place of learning should encourage.
The current policy teaches students to be accountable for
the choices they make about drinking. More importantly, it
asks students who drink to think about why they do so, and
what effect they want alcohol to have on their lives.
If the University asks for outside enforcement it will be
communicating a very different message: that although stu
dents are encouraged to behave responsibly toward alcohol,
they are not expected to be mature enough to do so.
Our rush policy presents the opportunity for the Univer
sity to follow its past judgment and ask the students them
selves to enforce the guidelines. Having Interfratenity Coun
cil representatives attend rush parties to ensure compliance
with the guidelines at each party is a good beginning.
In addition, fraternities should be informed well in ad
vance that they will be penalized should they break the rules.
Jackson's call to revoke University recognition of the Zeta
Psi fraternity — guilty of several rule violations over the
past few years — is an example of a penalty the fraternity
knew was possible and, because of repeated disregard for
rush guidelines, deserved.
The current rush alcohol policy, when followed, effectively
contains the dangers of rush by emphasizing student respon
sibility. If given a chance to work it could successfully bal
ance the need for restraint with the University's commit
ment to respect student choice.
