Ticket was unfair
On June 24, at 2:15 p.m., I
parked my car behind the Stan
ford post office, ran to my mail
box, collected my mail and ran
back to my car. To my as
tonishment, parking citation
officer J. Cowan, whom I had
seen driving out as I was
driving in, was writing me a
ticket.
I asked him why, and he
answered that I was parked in
a red zone — an obviously ille
gal parking place. While I told
him I had been in there for
about two minutes (a fact he
must have known, as he
deliberately turned around and
drove back into the alleyway to
see where my car was), he
asked what I'd been doing. I
responded that I'd gone to get
my mail. He continued to write
the ticket. My argument about
having no other quick place to
park while I checked my mail
box was to no avail. He handed
me the ticket.
Now, it may seem petty to

quibble over an $11 parking
ticket. But three aspects of the
case anger me more than the
cost.
First of all, it smacks of
entrapment. Ticketer Cowan
was leaving the post office area
as I drove up — in fact, our
cars passed at the corner of the
Law School and the parking
lot. Thus, he had to consciously
turn his vehicle around to fol
low me into the cul de sac. His
motives surely were suspect.
Second, my intent was not
malicious. Had I defiantly
parked behind the postal
trucks in order to box them in
or sauntered to the post office
to purchase stamps, I could
respect the ticket. But I inten
tionally ran to the mailbox and
quickly walked back to my car
in order not to create a bot
tleneck with other vehicles in
the area.
Did this matter to the tick
eter? No. His job is to give tick
ets to those parked in red
zones, and he followed the
book. In this case, the intent of

the law — to prevent cars from
blocking postal and delivery
trucks — was twisted by a
protector of that law. The rule
took precedence over the situa
tion.
Finally, there is the issue of
convenient, speedy parking
available for mail collection.
Spaces are allocated for 40-
minute parking in the lots ad
jacent to the Law School.
However, these spaces are fre
quently filled, causing one
either to park further away or
chance the parking ticket. And
what could be a two-minute
trip to the mailbox turns into a
six-minute trip when one has
to park in one of these marked
spots.
Though the post office is on
campus, it cannot be assumed
that every user either bikes or
walks to the mailboxes. Some
of us occasionally must use our
cars for this ritual, and we
deserve something other than a
red zone in which to park.
