# Repeating history: Pope John Paul toes the line
## 
### 
The pope, the Jews and the Nazis. Cer
tainly an odd, volatile mix, isn't it? Last
week Pope John Paul II granted an audi
ence to renegade President Kurt Waldheim
of Austria, prompting virulent protest from
Jewish leaders around the world. Prime
Minister Yitzhak Shamir of Israel sent the
pope a rather curt telegram of disapproval
decrying the Vatican's tacit "legitimation
of Nazi war crimes."

Waldheim, you will recall, is the one with
the slightly dysfunctional memory. It
seems he remembers bits and pieces of his
Nazi-tainted past only as fast as historians
publicize the pertinent documents and
photos.
The Austrian stands accused of shipping
partisans and Jews off to death camps as a
lieutenant in the German army during
World War 11. Though he denies the
charges, and though much of his guilt is
merely guilt by association (isn't most Nazi
guilt of such a strain?), Waldheim remains
an international leper. Most nations have
followed the U.S. lead and blackballed the
former U.N. Secretary General from the ex
clusive circles of the diplomatic cocktail
party circuit.
The Waldheim game has become more in
teresting of late. Every group is trying to
take the moral high ground. The Jewish
community, of course, has the greatest
claim to the territory. How can anyone ar

gue with Nazi criminal hunters, especially
when their results have been so fruitful
recently? (Klaus Barbie, the "Butcher of
Lyon," is the prime catch.) Right now we're
in the middle of the last wave of Nazi war
criminal unmaskings. Soon all of the prin
cipals will die out. So it's hard to deny the
Jews their final shot at satisfaction.
Once the Jewish community, diplomati
cally represented by Israel, makes its moral
judgement, all other states follow suit and
hasten to appear as righteous as possible.
Each condemns Waldheim the individual
but secretly courts the favor of the Austrian
people as much as necessary. Leading the
pack: the United States and (surprise) West
Germany.
The Germans exemplify this middle posi
tion. How can they pass up a chance to
dump off some of that oppressive collective
guilt? At the same time, how can they af
ford to cut diplomatic relations with an
other German-speaking country of strate
gic importance in Central Europe?
Austria is of strategic importance to East
and West; don't let anyone tell you differ
ently. Vienna buffers the Iron Curtain, and
it is one of the best places in Europe for
NATO and the Warsaw Pact to strike a deal
and sign a treaty.
We come to the pope.
Now I would think that of all people, the
pope would be in the best position to rise
above diplomatic maneuverings and make
a strong, clear statement against the kind
of moral shadiness that Waldheim
represents.
Why should John Paul receive an
evasive, unforthright man? Why should the
pope be afraid of offending the Austrian
government? After all, he certainly hasn't
been afraid of rebuffing governments in the

past. Generals Jaruzelski in Poland and
Pinochet in Chile would confirm that.
The pontiff didn't just "receive"
Waldheim either. He praised him ex
travagantly as a man of peace and
humanitarianism. The end result? We
encounter a ludicrous situation: Waldheim
states after the meeting that John Paul has
become a "recognized moral authority . . .
the conscience of this world." Right, Kurt.
You're one to judge.
I can think of only one answer to this
mess: Clearly the pope has his own
diplomatic priorities within the Roman
Catholic Church which take precedence
over Nazi-bashing and relations with Jews.
Austria may be small, but it's fiercely Cath
olic and fiercely proud of its newly elected
president.
If the Austrians want to elect and revel in
a president who's a suspected war criminal,
that's their business, opines the pope. Best
to keep the internal affairs of my house (the
church) in order.
I'm reminded of a bit of history. Pope Pius
XII toed the line in World War 11, trying to
mediate between the Jews on the one hand
and all those Catholics in Bavaria —
Nazism's birthplace — on the other. He of
fered succor to Jewish refugees in Rome. At
the same time, he refused to categorically
condemn what was going on in Bavaria in
order to protect his "constituents."
Pius XII tried to have it both ways, and it
didn't work. I suspect John Paul's maneu
ver will probably fall through too. Don't be
surprised if Jewish-Catholic relations have
a long sour run.
Such are the windings of papal politics.
Shame on you, John Paul.

the conscience of this world." Right, Kurt.
You're one to judge.
I can think of only one answer to this
mess: Clearly the pope has his own
diplomatic priorities within the Roman
Catholic Church which take precedence
over Nazi-bashing and relations with Jews.
Austria may be small, but it's fiercely Cath
olic and fiercely proud of its newly elected
president.
If the Austrians want to elect and revel in
a president who's a suspected war criminal,
that's their business, opines the pope. Best
to keep the internal affairs of my house (the
church) in order.
I'm reminded of a bit of history. Pope Pius
XII toed the line in World War 11, trying to
mediate between the Jews on the one hand
and all those Catholics in Bavaria —
Nazism's birthplace — on the other. He of
fered succor to Jewish refugees in Rome. At
the same time, he refused to categorically
condemn what was going on in Bavaria in
order to protect his "constituents."
Pius XII tried to have it both ways, and it
didn't work. I suspect John Paul's maneu
ver will probably fall through too. Don't be
surprised if Jewish-Catholic relations have
a long sour run.
Such are the windings of papal politics.
Shame on you, John Paul.
