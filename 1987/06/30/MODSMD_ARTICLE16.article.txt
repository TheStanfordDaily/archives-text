## Summer program attracts many High schoolers attend Stanford 
### ANDY COHEN DAVID FRAIBERG 
There are more students at Stanford than
just undergraduates and graduates.
This summer almost 95 high school juniors
and seniors are enrolled in Stanford's Summer
Visitor Program. They come from 17 states
and eight foreign countries, all in search of
higher education.
High schoolers are allowed to take any of the
courses offered at Stanford as long as they
meet the University's prerequisites in such
areas as math and languages. In addition, they
enjoy all the benefits of regular Stanford stu
dents including the infamous food service meal
plan, exercise facilities at Encina Gym and li
brary privileges at Meyer and Green.
But the facilities which are most familiar to
the high schoolers are the two campus houses
in which they are located. Life in Trancos and
Okada is aptly supervised by five resident as
sistants, who have planned programs such as a
workshop on relationships, a tour of the Stan
ford Museum and a presentation by the admis
sions office.
The RAs are headed by Courtney Graham,
who graduated from Stanford this spring and
will be attending medical school in the fall.
The other RAs for the high school program are
Ghassan Assi, a Lebanese graduate student;
Dave Bishko, a junior majoring in industrial
engineering who helps with the sports pro
gram; Ed Chan, a junior in biology; and Beth
Dungan, a junior in human biology.
The program's director is Chris Griffith, one
of the seven residential deans at Stanford. She
describes herself as a "resource broker" for the

students, informing them of the various
services which Stanford offers.
Residential education for the high school
program, according to Griffith, is as important
as classroom education. "We place a great deal
of importance on what these student learn
outside of the classroom," she said.
The high schoolers seem to agree with this
philosophy. Many felt that they have a great
deal to learn from communal living. At Stan
ford there is a higher level of independence
and responsibility than most of them are ac
customed to. In addition, the cultural diversity
and scope of varying backgrounds represented
in the program enhances the learning that
takes place outside of the classroom.
Another aspect of non-classroom learning
for the high schoolers is the dorm government
they initiate, an activity Griffith encourages.
The high school students elect dorm officers to
plan social activities for the entire program.
Their dorm president, Matthew Maxwell, is
in charge of presiding over weekly house
meetings, seeing that activities get planned
and keeping an accurate record of meetings
and activities. Maxwell is supported by Scott
Kelly, who is in charge of organizing sports
competitions with the other campus dorms. In
addition, there are two hall representatives
elected from each floor that make up the dorm
council, participate in house meetings, give in
put and help plan activities.
Perhaps the high schooler's perspective at
Stanford is best summarized by program mem
ber John Egan of Chicago. "Still, we are young
here. We are all still finding our own direc
tions. But things look good," he said.
