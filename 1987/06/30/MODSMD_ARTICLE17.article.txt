## Curious reporter-at-large canvasses community Students, profs. speak out about Tammy and Jim 
### JOHN D. LEE 
In light of the recent Jim and Tammy
Bakker-Jessica Hahn-Jerry Falwell-
PTL Club fiasco, Stanford's own Mr.
Curious Guy decided to go out into the
community to find out what the public
thinks about Jim and Tammy Bakker's
present situation.
Have Jim and Tammy Bakker suf
fered enough?
Gavin Wright, professor, economics:
"If the focus (of the question) is on the
word 'suffer,' I have no desire to see them
suffer. If you mean do they deserve
anyone's attention, I guess my answer
would be, no, not anymore than anyone
else."
Alex Inkeles, professor, sociology:
"I think we should leave it to God."
Jae Choi, junior, human biology:
"I personally believe all that TV evan

gelism stuff is a bunch of bull, and I
think that the people should just take
them out to dry. So I guess my answer is
they haven't suffered enough."
Linda Stanford, junior, human biology:
"Jim and Tammy Bakker have not
suffered enough yet. I don't think they
should be allowed to reorganize one of
their TV evangelical sermon things be
cause they obviously proved that they
were not really efficient in doing so."
Elizabeth Amaral, junior, undeclared:
"I think they've suffered enough, but I
don't think they should go back to
preaching because they've proved them
selves not too Godly. I think the media's
blown the whole thing out of propor
tion."
Jeff Loomans, junior, symbolic systems:
"Frankly, I don't think they have. Per
sonally, I'm appalled at what they've
been doing in trying to make a come

back. I believe that the kind of hypocrisy
and greed they represent is probably one
of the worst offenses a human being can
ever perpetrate on others. Most likely
that should be as punishable as could be
possible. I think that they definitely
have not been punished enough. I'd like
to see them in jail."
Jeff Smith, junior, systems engineering:
"I don't see how anyone in their right
mind could possibly look at sweet, old,
little Tammy Bakker and accuse her of
any wrongdoing. You all heard her on
'Nightline' with Ted Koppel. She shops
at factory outlets, all right? Let's get off
the bitch's back."
Tony Stone, senior, engineering:
"Well, suffering is all relative, of
course. It depends on whose point of view
you're looking at. I'm sure a lot of people
think Jim and Tammy Bakker were
great. I personally don't think anymore
suffering is in order. But it's not a ques

tion of suffering so much as it is a ques
tion of whether or not proper justice has
been dealt out. Regardless of whether or
not they are a showpiece to the public,
the primary issue is that they should be
punished or not punished just like any
other American based on what they did."
Lawrence You, graduate, computer sci
ence:
"Yeah, sure. Why not? I really don't
care about their fate. I mean it's pretty
insignificant to me."
Mr. Curious Guy, no class, no major:
"You know, the interesting thing
about this question is all very metaphys
ical. If a tree fell in the forest on Tammy
Bakker's face, would her makeup protect
her to the extent that she would come
out unscathed? Suffering, as we all well
know, makes the heart grow fonder.
Thus, if Tammy and Jim were to con
tinue to suffer, they would love me all
the more for it."
