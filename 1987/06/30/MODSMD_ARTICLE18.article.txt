The crowd roared with
laughter.
Not once, or twice, but all
through the more than 25 com
ics who paraded across Frost
Amphitheater's stage last Sat
urday.
The benefit show for Stanford
Hospital's Neonatal Care Unit
raised approximately $20,000
according to Palo Alto Jaycees
Chairman Steve Poizner.
In addition, the show brought
loads of laughs and smiles to
the 6,000 people who attended.
Best of all, the laughs were for a
great cause.
