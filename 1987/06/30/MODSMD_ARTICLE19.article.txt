# Play puns nuns' habits, conventional wisdom

### JAMES R. DICKEY Editorial staff 
Interested in learning the recipe for
"Mary Magdalene Tarts" or "Jim and
Tammy Humble Pie?" Want to know what
makes Blue Nun blue? The little sisters of
Hoboken, stars of Dan Goggin's irrepressi
ble comedy "Nunsense," will be glad to
share their wisdom with you.
The off-Broadway smash hit which is
visiting San Fransico this summer is a
spinoff of a wildly successful line of greet
ing cards created by Goggin. The cards
featured a dental assistant in a nun's habit
making tart remarks with a clerical slant.
The show is full of racy, religious humor
and the comedy inherent in a troupe of tap
dancing nuns. It is made more interesting
because of the degree to which the charac
ters interact with the audience.
Unlike the characters in most plays, the
five nuns are fully aware of the viewers.
They are putting on a show in order to raise
money for their convent, and the play con
sists of that show.
The actresses are delightful and bring an
astounding amount of credibility to what is
one of the most incredible roles on the
modern stage. These are not buxom,
shapely lasses, but portly, wizened super-

McNight, as mistress of the novices and
second in command at the convent, is so
convincing she made members of the audi
ence sit up straight and put out their gum,
for fear she'd bring out a ruler. In addition,
the excellent characterization in the rela
tionship between McNight and the Mother
Superior added quite a bit to the comedy
and drama of the show.
DeLaurentis is captivating as Sister
Mary Amnesia. She is funny, innocent,
clever and gullible. Her portrayal of a nun
with amnesia is sensitive and endearing,
and her recovery is made believable
through her delivery.
Though McNight and DeLaurentis are
the most remarkable in their parts, each
character is solid and the group as a whole
is cohesive and appealing.
The show is quite unusual, placed on a
stage prepared for "Grease," rather than in
any more convent-like setting. The songs
are intelligent and catchy, packed full of
nun jokes and written to show off the
actress' impressive vocal range.
"Nunsense" plays at Marines Memorial
Theatre (609 Sutter St., San Francisco) at 8
p.m. Tuesday through Saturday and 7 p.m.
on Sunday. Tickets range from $16 to $20
and are available at the box office and all
major ticket outlets.
