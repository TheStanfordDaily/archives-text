# Former activist joins law faculty
## 
### LIZ LEMPERT Staff writer 
Janet Cooper, a campus radi
cal here in the early 19705, will
return this fall as an associate
professor in the Law School.
During her turbulent three
years here as a graduate stu
dent in English, Cooper was a
leader in numerous anti-war
demonstrations and rallies.
"I suppose it's an ironic
footnote," Cooper said of her
return to Stanford in an inter
view with the San Jose Mercury
News.
Cooper emphasized that
times have changed, however.
"I'm hoping people will not
view me as a curiosity. I'm not a
time machine. I'm not the per
son I was," Cooper told The
Daily yesterday.
"The biggest change is that
times have changed. The times
are different. I'm different," she
said.
In 1971 Cooper was
suspended from the University
for four quarters after disrupt
ing a speech by former U.S. Am

bassador to Vietnam Henry
Cabot Lodge.
Three other students received
suspensions, and Assoc. English
Prof. Bruce Franklin, who par
ticipated in the heckling and
other demonstrations, was
suspended and eventually dis
missed from the University.

A 1971 Daily article quoted
Cooper, then Janet Weiss,
speaking to a student rally a
month after the Lodge incident:
"Some people want to take
militant action tonight. That's

right on! If people want to do
different things, that's right on,
too!"
In February 1971, Cooper
urged students to participate in
a campus-wide strike to "shut
down" the University in protest
of the U.S. invasion of Laos.
That night, windows were bro
ken in several buildings as
angry students roamed across
campus.
Since her Stanford days,
Cooper has earned a law degree
from UC-Berkeley, clerked for
U.S. Supreme Court Justice
Thurgood Marshall and become
a partner in a San Francisco
law firm.
"People in the movement
have done different things since
then. The world has changed.
People have changed," Cooper
said.
"The basic values and the
basic goals are the same I've al
ways had — a feeling for justice
and freedom," she added.
Cooper is considered an ex
pert in complex litigation relat

will teach civil procedure and

Cooper said she is looking for
ward to joining the law faculty
but does not intend to play a
radical role.
"The war is over. A lot of the
impetus that was there in the

had 16 years of different experi
