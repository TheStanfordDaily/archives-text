# Opera is a success

With the world premiere
of his recently completed
concert opera, "Plump
Jack," at Davies Sym
phony Hall last weekend,
Gordon Getty is finally re
ceiving some of the
recognition he has long
sought in the province of
modern music. The San
Francisco billionaire and
philanthropist is in ear
nest pursuit of acceptance
as "Gordon Getty the com
poser."
"Plump Jack" is based
on the roguish Shake
spearean character
Falstaff. All four scenes
that compose the opera are
excerpted from Shake
speare's history plays.
The first scene, taken from
"Henry IV, Part I," finds
FalstafT and the young Prince
Hal, the future Henry V, en
gaged in a lively exchange as
they mimic the unyielding
Henry IV. Here Getty intro
duces bold orchestration char
acterized by frequent tonal con
trasts and shifting timbres.
Scene II contains some inter
esting and thoughtful musical
developments as Falstaff and
Justice Shallow, from "Henry
IV, Part II," recall their
younger days. Here Getty
makes use of a waltz form con
struction that is sugesstive of
Richard Strauss and Verdi.
The most lyrical and pleasing
musical piece in the opera is a
Mass that introduces the third
scene. The Mass is sung offstage
by monks accompanied by a
calm background of strings
while Henry V, who has just
been crowned, is celebrated.
The chorus bustles in as a
teeming crowd and witnesses

the king's abandonment of his
old friend Falstaff. This scene is
a climax of temperament
reflected by heightened musical
punctuations and sharp versus
sustained passages.
In the last section, a scene
from "Henry V," Falstaff s
death is related as preparations
for war are underway. The tale
of the knight's passing is jux
taposed with the military
excitement and sounding of
bells, fifes and drums. A
farewell to men departing for
war is the somber conclusion,
but Getty seems to use this mo
ment as a final reference to the
departure of Falstaff as well.
Conductor- Andrew Massey,
the San Francisco Symphony
Orchestra and the six-member
cast led by John del Carlo as
Falstaff all give fine perfor
mances.
The play is the latest piece in
the New and Unusual Music Se
ries at Davies, and it is appro
priate in that setting. Certain
aspects of its style might prove
too startling for some. For the
bold viewer, however, it is an
adventurous departure from the
traditional.
