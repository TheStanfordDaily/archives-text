### CHRISTINA LEPNIS 
With the world premiere
of his recently completed
concert opera, "Plump
Jack," at Davies Sym
phony Hall last weekend,
Gordon Getty is finally re
ceiving some of the
recognition he has long
sought in the province of
modern music. The San
Francisco billionaire and
philanthropist is in ear
nest pursuit of acceptance
as "Gordon Getty the com
poser."
"Plump Jack" is based
on the roguish Shake
spearean character
Falstaff. All four scenes
that compose the opera are
excerpted from Shake
speare's history plays.
