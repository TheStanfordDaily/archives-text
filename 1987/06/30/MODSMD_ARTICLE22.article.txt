## Rabbits making baseball magic 
### 
It's been fairly well-documented that major
league baseball players are hitting a record
number of home runs this year, but there is no
consensus on why this is happening.

Almost everyone agrees that one of the
reasons for the power surge is that players are
spending more time in the weight room. Most
also agree that the quality of pitching is at a
low ebb. But, walk into a bar and claim that
there's a rabbit in the ball and you may not
walk out alive.
I, for one, am a proponent of the lively ball
theory and have some evidence to back it up.
First, an independent organization tested the
1987 balls and found that the bounced higher
than those used in 1986. Second, word has
leaked out that Rawlings, the company that
makes the baseballs, may have sent the teams
balls manufactured to college specifications.
The colleges, it just so happens, use a much

livelier ball than the pros. And remember
Charlie Puleo and Brian Fisher, two pitchers,
hit home runs on the same day a few weeks
ago.
Speaking of life, San Francisco's Humm
babies don't seem to have much left. The loss of
Candy Maldonado (out eight weeks with a bro
ken finger) completes the Giants' annual
"June swoon." The Giants go out every April
and May and deceive their fans into thinking
that they are for real. Then June comes along
and they disappear.
As the All-Star break approaches Wade
Boggs and Tony Gwynn are both batting
around .380. Is it possible that one of the two
finest pure hitters of the 1980s might be the
first man to hit .400 since Ted Williams did it
over four decades ago?
While a .400 batting average may seem
mystical, other "magic numbers" in the world
sports appear to be well within reach. It's just
a matter of time before someone hig jumps 8
feet or someone pole vaults 20 feet. I know this
is heresy but . . . could Carl Lewis long jump
30 feet if he was at high altitude?
(Incidentally, someone claims Jesse Owens
jumped over 30 feet in a practice jump at the
1936 Berlin Olympics.)
