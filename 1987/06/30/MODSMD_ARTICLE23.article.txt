# Massive elimination
## Six former Cardinal stars lose in singles play 
### CHRIS CRADER Staff writer 
The sun came back out over
the tennis courts at Wimbledon,
England, over the weekend, but
it was not shining on the former
Stanford players remaining in
the singles draw. Eleven ex-
Stanford players entered the
draw, but all are now out of the
competition.
Tim Mayotte, the men's 10th
seed and a favorite for the title,
lost in the third round to
Sweeden's Mikael Pernfors. The
1985 NCAA champion from
Georgia beat Stanford's 1981
NCAA champ 2-6, 4-6, 6-4, 6-3,
7-5 yesterday to advance to a
meeting with former UCLA
Bruin and 1971 NCAA titleist
Jimmy Connors.
Mayotte beat American Tim
Wilkison on Saturday, 6-3, 4-6,
6-7 (2-7), 6-2, 6-4, but ran out of
gas against Pernfors.
Scott Davis also reached the
third round before falling to

Johan Kriek 5-7, 6-4, 6-7 (1-7),
6-1, 8-6 on Saturday, the same
day Derrick Rostagno was
eliminated in the second round,
by Anders Jarryd 6-0, 6-3, 3-6,
6-3.
The three remaining women
from Stanford were also
knocked out over the weekend.
Patty Fendick lost to South
African Rosalyn Fairbank, 6-2,
5-7, 6-2 on Friday, in the second
round.
Elise Burgin and Alycia
Moulton both won on Friday
and Saturday before losing in
the third round yesterday. Bur
gin lost 6-4, 6-1 to llth-seeded
Catarina Lindqvist (who has
now demonstrated bad manners
to two ex-Cardinal players,
having defeated Kathy Jordan
earlier) after beating Elna
Reinach and Anne Smith in
straight sets. Moulton began
with two-set wins over Betsy
Nagelsen and Judith Wiesner
before dropping a 7-6, 6-2 deci
