■ A look at Stanford athletes around the world

Swimming star wins
academic award
Pablo Morales, perhaps the
finest swimmer in Stanford his
tory, was named to the first
string of the University Divi
sion GTE All-Academic Team.
The award honors students who
have combined academic and
athletic achievement.
Morales majored in English
and graduated with a 3.25 GPA.
His 11 NCAA titles helped
Stanford win three consecutive
national championships and
were also an individual record.
Winners of the award are se
lected by the College Sports In
formation Directors of America.
Volleyball players
head for Yugoslavia
The World University
Games will begin July 9 in
Zagreb, Yugoslavia and Stan
ford volleyball will be well
represented.
The U.S. men's university
team will be under the charge of
Stanford Coach Fred Sturm
who is taking the responsibility
seriously. "We're going to have
two-a-day (practices) and just
go day by day," Sturm said.
"We're going to get organized as
a team and get to know each
other so we can play as a team."
Sturm will be quite familiar
with two of his players: Jon
Root and Scott Fortune. Root,
who graduated in 1986, was a
two-time All-American while
playing at Stanford. He is also a
member of the U.S. men's na
tional team and played for the
1986 world champion U.S.
men's team. Fortune, who will
be a senior, played with the na
tional team last summer.
The women's team will
feature Pacific 10 Conference
Player-of-the-Year Teresa
Smith. Smith, who will be a
senior in September, was also
an All-American and the Pac
-10 female athlete of the year.
In other volleyball news, Kim
Oden, a 1986 graduate, led the
U.S. national team to a second
place finish in the NOR-CECA
zone championships held in
Havana, Cuba. The finish earns
the team a berth in the 1988
Olympic games.
Women's soccer
will have new coach
After six years of coaching
men's soccer at Cal State Los
Angeles, Berhane Andeberhan
has a new job — coaching
women's soccer at Stanford.
Andeberhan comes to the
Farm with impressive creden
tials: he coached four confer
ence champions and five All-

American players at CSLA. He
helped move CSLA's soccer pro
gram from Division 2 to Divi
sion 1 and was named Far West
Coach of the Year in 1981.
Andeberhan, who graduated
from UCLA in 1971, is cur
rently the Western Regional
head coach for women and girls.
He coached those teams to a
gold medal at the 1986 Olympic
Festival and a silver medal in
1985.
World Series hero
Osuna looks ahead
A 1 Osuna was a hero only a
few weeks ago. It was his eight
and two-thirds innings of bril
liant relief against Texas that
kept the Cardinal alive on the
way to winning its first College
World Series title.
Now Osuna is pitching for the
Auburn Astros, a team in the
New York-Penn Rookie League.
He was their 16th round choice
in the June baseball draft and is
aware that the road to the big
leagues is going to be a long and
difficult one.
Despite the long odds, only 5
percent of all players at the AA
level (two steps above where
Osuna is) make the majors,
Stanford Coach Mark Marquess
and the Astros believe he's got a
chance. "He's an outstanding
left-handed pitcher," Marquess

told the Times Tribune. "He's
got good control, he's a very
good fielder, he's a team
oriented player and he's very
versatile — he's an asset as
either a starter or a reliever."
"I'm not putting any pressure
on myself to reach the majors in
a certain number of years,"
Osuna said. "I'm just trying to
learn all I can."
Jacobs, three others
make good at TAC
Regina Jacobs, a 1986
graduate, took first place in the
1500 meters at The Athletic
Congress meet in San Jose last
weekend. Jacobs' win, in a time
of 4:03.70 seconds, was a stun
ning upset. She beat her
nearest competitor by 2.1
seconds.
In other events, Carol Cady, a
three-time Ail-American in the
discus and a two-time All-
American in the shot put,
placed second in the discus with
a throw of 206-11. She also
finished ninth in the shot put
with a throw of 53-%.
Pam Dukes, an Ail-American
in 1986, finished seven spots
ahead of Cady in the shot put.
Her 59-5 toss was good enough
for second place.
Junior Erica Wheeler
finished a respectable 11th in
the javelin with a toss of 169-2.
The top three finishers in
each event generally earn a
chance to compete in the world
championships.
