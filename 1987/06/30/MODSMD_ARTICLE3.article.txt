Thomas Wasow, professor of linguistics and
philosophy, has been appointed to fill the posi

said yesterday.
The official announcement of the appointment
is expected today from the Office of Humanities

Wasow will fill the post vacated by Carloyn
Lougee, who resigned from the posts last spring
to return to teaching.
Wasow spoke enthusiastically about his new
job.
"Undergraduate education at Stanford is very
exciting. The possibility of being in a position of
affecting real change is also very exciting," he
said.
Wasow said he will assume his new duties
sometime in August, although "there is still
some paperwork that needs to be worked out."
Wasow, a member of the Stanford faculty since
1973, praised Lougee's administration saying,
"It's great to step into an office that is running
well. Carolyn Lougee has done a tremendous
job."
Wasow is noted for developing the symbolic

he said.
Wasow also stated he would like faculty mem

they do in graduate students and research."
"A substantial portion of the faculty gives un
dergraduate education third place behind grad
students and research. There is plenty of room for
improvement," he said.
Wasow was selected by an appointment com
mittee chaired by Dean of Humanities and
