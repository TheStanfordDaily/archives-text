### ERIN MARTIN Staff writer 
Thomas Wasow, professor of linguistics and
philosophy, has been appointed to fill the posi
tions of dean of Undergraduate Studies and asso
ciate dean of Humanities and Sciences, a Univer
sity administrator who asked not to be identified
said yesterday.
The official announcement of the appointment
is expected today from the Office of Humanities
and Sciences and the Office of the Provost, pend
ing interdepartmental notification.
Wasow will fill the post vacated by Carloyn
Lougee, who resigned from the posts last spring
to return to teaching.
Wasow spoke enthusiastically about his new
job.
"Undergraduate education at Stanford is very
exciting. The possibility of being in a position of
affecting real change is also very exciting," he
said.
Wasow said he will assume his new duties
sometime in August, although "there is still
some paperwork that needs to be worked out."
Wasow, a member of the Stanford faculty since
1973, praised Lougee's administration saying,
"It's great to step into an office that is running
well. Carolyn Lougee has done a tremendous
job."
Wasow is noted for developing the symbolic
systems program which offers undergraduates an
interdisciplinary major in computer science, lin-
In his three-year term, Wasow said he would
like to give more attention to improving student
and faculty attitudes toward undergraduate edu
cation.
"I would like to see more student seriousness
and academic success. It seems that good grades
are valued but working hard to get them is not,"
he said.
Wasow also stated he would like faculty mem
bers to "take the same interest in undergrads
they do in graduate students and research."
"A substantial portion of the faculty gives un
dergraduate education third place behind grad
students and research. There is plenty of room for
improvement," he said.
Wasow was selected by an appointment com
mittee chaired by Dean of Humanities and
Sciences Norman Wessells.
Other members of the com
mittee were James Gibbon,
dean of the School of Engineer
ing, George Thompson, profes
sor of geophysics, and two stu
dents, Carey White and Kim
Crawford, members of the
ASSU Council of Presidents.
According to Joan Lane, spe
cial assistant to the dean of
Humanities and Sciences, Wes
sells conducted an extensive
search to find a replacement for
Lougee.
Lane said Wessells sent let

ters seeking nominations and
self-nominations for the posi
tion to all faculty members.
After receiving nominations,
Wessells "evolved a list of about
70-80 candidates which were in
dividually reviewed by all
members of the committee,''
Lane said.
Wessells could not be reached
for comment yesterday.
