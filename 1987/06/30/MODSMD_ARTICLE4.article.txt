Gore announces bid for presidency
CARTHAGE, Tenn. — Sen. Albert Gore Jr., D-Tenn., Mon
day became one of the youngest candidates ever to seek a
major party presidential nomination as he pledged from the
courthouse steps of his home town to "restore the rule of law
and respect for truth and common sense to the White House."
'Some have asked me, 'Why don't you wait?'" said Gore,
39, who would be the youngest president in the nation's his
tory if he were inaugurated in January 1989 at age 40.
"History itself is speeding up, with events cascading upon
events . . . We no longer have the luxury of waiting. We must
accept the challenge of the future now, rekindle the spirit of
America and regenerate a sense of national purpose which
only a president can define."
Gore delivered his speech from same spot his father had
launched his career half a century earlier, and a few miles
from the farms father and son own. He spoke of reducing the
federal deficit, investing in education, cleaning up the envi
ronment, attacking homelessness, drug abuse and crime, pro
viding child care and expanded medical coverage, reducing
Third World debt and taking advantage of a "possibly historic
opportunity" to achieve an arms control pact.
Gore is the sixth Democrat to formally join the 1988 presi
dential race and the first southerner.
Donor faces attempted murder charge
LOS ANGELES — Attempted murder charges were filed
Monday against an AIDS patient and reputed male prostitute
who allegedly knowingly sold contaminated blood to a Los
Angeles donation center, District Attorney Ira Reiner an
nounced.
Acknowledging that there is "no law in the state of Califor
nia that directly addresses this particular problem," Reiner
told reporters it is necessary "to protect the public" from
Joseph Edward Markowski, 28, because of his "frightening as
well as repulsive" actions in putting others at risk of contract
ing the deadly, contagious disease.
"He is a threat to everyone," Reiner said. AIDS is spread
through the exchange of blood and other bodily fluids.
The chances are slim that patients who receive plasma
from such centers could get AIDS, even if the plasma were
contaminated with the AIDS virus, he said.
The reason, he said, is that blood collected at proprietary
centers by law must be tested for the virus before it is used on
patients. Even if the test fails to detect the virus, the kind of
processing that plasma undergoes makes the risk to patients
extremely small.
Soviet minister warns of failures
MOSCOW — Prime Minister Nikolai Ryzhkov, pressing
Kremlin leader Mikhail Gorbachev's campaign for urgent
and radical reform of the Soviet economy, warned Monday
that legislation to be adopted Tuesday may spell the death of
failing enterprises if they continue to run at a deficit.
Ryzhkov, speaking on the opening day of a session of the
Supreme Soviet, the national legislature, said 13 percent of
Soviet enterprises operated at a loss in 1986, and indicated
that local managers will have to adjust to new management
methods or face shutdowns of their facilities.
The Soviet prime minister, who in the past has taken a
more cautious approach to economic reform than has Gorba
chev, disclosed figures indicating the troubled state of the So
viet economy. He said that the state is now holding outstand
ing debts from the enterprises of 40 billion rubles — about
$62 billion.
The reform package, adopted by the Communist Party
Central Committee last week, will release much of the eco
nomy from the grip of central planning agencies, revise the
archaic pricing system and give freer rein to competition be
tween local enterprises.
Roh, Chun to meet, discuss reforms
SEOUL, South Korea — Ruling party chairman Roh Tae
Woo was set to meet with President Chun Doo Hwan Tuesday
morning to seek final approval for sweeping political reforms,
including direct presidential elections demanded by the oppo
sition, state-run television reported Monday.
Roh made the recommendations Monday morning in a
televised announcement that stunned people on both sides of
the political spectrum by agreeing to meet virtually all oppo
sition demands.
Monday afternoon, the ruling party caucus and central ex
ecutive committee met and endorsed Roh's plan without dis
sent. Press and public comment was also overwhelmingly fa
vorable.
That and various officials' predictions appeared to set the
stage for formal approval by Chun. "It's been broadcast on TV
and printed in the newspapers," said one Korean political
analyst. "It's a fact. No one can change it, including Mr.
Chun."
No major demonstrations were reported in Seoul or other
cities Monday, suggesting that Roh's announcement was
having the desired effect of calming three weeks of street
protests that have presented the Chun government with the
most serious challenge in its seven-year existence.
