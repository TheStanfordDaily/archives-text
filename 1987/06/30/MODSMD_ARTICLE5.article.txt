# Bork to replace Powell on Court
## 
### 
WASHINGTON â€” President
Reagan will nominate federal
appellate Judge Robert Bork to
the Supreme Court by the
middle of the week, subject to
checks with Senate leaders of
both parties by White House
chief of staff Howard Baker Jr.
and Attorney General Edwin
Meese 111, administration
sources said Monday.
The tentative decision was
made at a 32-minute meeting
Monday of Reagan, Baker,
Meese, White House counsel
A.B. Culvahouse and Assistant
Attorney General William

Bradford Reynolds, Meese's
counselor. Two senior White
House officials called Bork the
leading candidate.
One senior official said Bork
would be given the nomination
unless "there's a major obstacle
on the Hill that you can't
overcome." He said that Patrick
Higginbotham, a federal ap
peals court judge in Dallas, and
two others remained under con
sideration if any problems
developed during a preliminary
background investigation and
the discussions with key
senators.

Bork, 60, is regarded as an
unbending conservative, unlike
retiring Justice Lewis Powell, a
crucial swing vote on the court.
Bork has drawn high praise for
his judicial scholarship demon
strated during five years on the
U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals
here, as solicitor general and as
a law professor at Yale.
In filling Powell's vacancy,
the president has the historic
opportunity of shaping the ideo
logical balance of the Supreme
Court by giving it a majority of
conservatives.
