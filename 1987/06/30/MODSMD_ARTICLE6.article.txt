## Superconductor breakthroughs discussed 
### LOUIS LERMAN 
High temperature supercon
ductors have been the Holy
Grail scientists have sought for
the last 75 years.
Only 30 to 40 attendees were
expected when the Interna
tional Workshop on Novel
Mechanisms of Superconduc
tivity was planned a year ago.
But discoveries made in the last
six months drew a crowd of over
600 physicists and material sci
entists to Berkeley last week.
These discoveries include the
existence of a large class of ma
terials which become supercon
ductors — that is, lose all resis
tance to the flow of electricity —
above liquid nitrogen tempera
tures (77 degrees Kelvin) as
well as tantalizing hints of ma
terials which become supercon
ductive at room temperatures.
These discoveries are now the
hottest topics in material sci
ence, and Stanford researchers
made several experimental and
theoretical presentations.
Exciting revelations of one
new superconducting material
after another and initial meas
urements of some of the proper
ties of these new materials sug
gest revolutionary commercial
applications.
The ability to conduct
electricity without resistance is
awesome when one considers
how much effort industry cur
rently devotes to alleviating the
problems of electrical resis
tance.
Researchers imagine
resistance-free power transmis
sion lines and computer chips
packed to incredible densities
without the concerns of heat
dissipation.

The Japanese, using the "old
fashioned" lower-temperature
superconductors, have com
pleted the construction of an ex
perimental train which
levitates above a track, sus
tained in its one dimensional
flight by a super-large magnetic
field.
Little more than a year ago,
the highest values attained in
the race toward higher temper
atures were only about 20
degrees above absolute zero.
This level represented the cul
mination of 75 years of sus
tained efforts beginning with
the initial discovery of super
conductivity by the Dutch
physicist Kammerlig Onnes in
1911.
Reaching a higher tempera
ture for superconducting was
not the only frustration for
these early researchers. The na
ture of the superconducting
phenomenon remained an
enigma despite the efforts of the
best scientists of the day — in
cluding Albert Einstein and
Niels Bohr.
It was only in 1957 that John
Bardeen, Leon Cooper and
Robert Schrieffer developed
what became known as the BCS
theory of superconductivity.
This highly successful theory
explained all of the basic
phenomena associated with su
perconductivity until the dis
coveries of the past six months.
Stanford's research program
in superconductivity has
developed over several decades
to one rivalling those of much
better funded industrial labs.
As Malcom Beasley, chair of
the Applied Physics Depart
ment and a superconductor re
searcher, said last week,

"Stanford has a larger opera
tion than is typical of univer
sities in general. This has been
historically the case. We've
worked to achieve that, and we
essentially had a well
functioning, relatively large
working group in superconduc
tivity when all of this hit. I
don't think any other institu
tion was quite as fortunately
situated."
Perhaps the most important
capability of Stanford is its abil
ity to make thin films of these
new superconducting materials.
Beasley explained that Stan
ford emphasizes films "because
they are such a powerful way of

making materials. It permits
physical measurements which
are not possible other ways and
it's more unusual.
"You try to be out front in
this business. I don't mean to
say that it's the best way to do
things. It's unique — but the
technological connection is not
a small part of it. The world
cares about thin films."
Applied Physics Prof. Ted
Geballe, one of the leaders of
the Stanford superconductor re
search efforts since 1968,
pointed out that superconductor
work at Stanford has played
other roles as well.
"It had the two virtues of not

only having the possibility of
finding higher temperature su
perconductors, but [it] also
taught us a lot of condensed
matter physics. It was a good
way to train graduate students
— that's one of the reasons I
came to Stanford," he said.
"You can use the study of su
perconductivity to find out all
about the nature of matter. The
superconducting measurements
are diagnostic about what sort
of interactions are going on in
unusual solids," Geballe added.
