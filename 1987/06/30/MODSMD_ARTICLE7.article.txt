# Tax changes hit grad students
## 
### STEPHEN KASIERSKI Senior staff writer 
Graduate students may be
feeling the pinch of changes in
the new tax code that limit ex
emptions of graduate scholar
ships and fellowships.
The celebrated Tax Reform
Act of 1986 limits the tax ex
emption for degree candidates
to amounts covering tuition and
directly related expenses and
taxes the portion of aid granted
to research assistants (RAs) and
teaching assistants (TAs) that
represents compensation for
services performed.
Prior to the reform, scholar
ship and fellowship aid for
degree candidates and RA and
TA positions which satisfied
degree requirements were al
most always exempt from tax.

But the reform act also con
tains transition language that
allows awards granted before
August 17, 1986 to be treated
under the old, less stringent
rules.
The recent clarification es
sentially allows students
granted multi-year awards
prior to the August date to still
claim exemption. "In a sense,
that's a victory for the student,"
said Christopher Canellos of the
University Controller's Office.
If a graduate award was
granted before the August date
for a period exceeding one aca
demic quarter, designated
amounts received in subsequent
years will be treated under the
old regulations.
To qualify for the exemption,
the award must be for a readily

determinable amount and con
tain a clear commitment for
continuing aid for more than
one academic quarter.
Because the University has
determined that cash stipends
paid to RAs and TAs represent
"compensation for services ren
dered," stipends received after
January 1, 1987 as part of ap
pointments awarded after the
August date will be reported as
taxable income and subject to
withholding.
If students were notified of
their awards before the August
date and the position meets a
degree requirement, the stipend
is tax free up to the amount
granted in the 1986-87 aca
demic year. Future increases
over the base amount would be
subject to the new tax.
