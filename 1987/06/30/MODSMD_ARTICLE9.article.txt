# Hospital joint venture faulted
## 
### MARK LEMLEY Staff writer 
Plans for Stanford to build a
new psychiatric hospital in
cooperation with a private,
profit-making corporation have
sparked controversy among fac
ulty members.
Earlier this month the Uni
versity Committee on Land and
Building Development
(UCLBD) voted to abstain on
approving a proposed site for
the new hospital, disapproving
of the concept of land use by a
profit-making corporation. The
vote was 6-1 with one absten
tion.
In spite of the committee's re
commendation, the Board of
Trustees on June 11 approved a
6.5-acre site near the intersec
tion of Quarry and Welch roads
for the proposed 80-bed facility.
Negotiations began June 22
with the Charter Medical Corp.,
a profit-making health care
company that operates 83
hospitals nationwide.
Dr. David Korn, vice
president and dean of the Medi
cal School, told the UCLBD that
medical faculty will have "full
control" over teaching, research
and patient care. Korn added

that the University will retain
the option to unilaterally
withdraw from the joint
venture.
Microbiology Prof. Sidney
Raffel assailed the proposal,
saying that working with a
profit-making company was
"tantamount to selling the de
partment to an outside agency."
Korn disagreed, saying that
Raffel "is just plain wrong. He
doesn't know what he's talking
about. We're not selling the de
partment to anyone."
University President Donald
Kennedy said he was not aware
of any controversy within the
medical faculty over the pro
posed hospital.
Korn assured faculty mem
bers that their interests would
be protected. He noted that the
affiliation agreement was pat
terned after the contract be
tween the Department of
Pediatrics and the new Lucile
Salter Packard Children's
Hospital at Stanford. Packard
Hospital is a non-profit corpora
tion.
Korn added that other major
universities have similar ar
rangements with hospital ad
ministration corporations. He
cited Vanderbilt University and

Harvard University as exam
ples.
Psychiatry Professor Thomas
Gonda said that he felt that the
profit-making status of the cor
poration was irrelevant. He
claimed that the University had
"built in over twice as much in
digent care in terms of dollars
and beds than we have in [the
current] non-profit hospital."
Kennedy spoke in favor of the
proposal, noting that the deal
was "close to closure." He said
that extended delays were un
acceptable.
Korn agreed, arguing that
the new hospital and Depart
ment of Psychiatry office build
ing are "urgently needed." He
claimed that the current
facilities, located in Hoover
Pavillion, are seismically
unsafe and must be closed when
the new facility is completed.
As the discussion grew
heated, analogies flew between
the faculty members. English
Prof. Ronald Rebholz compared
the hospital decision process to
that used in approving the
Reagan Library. He complained
of "very shoddy procedure" by
the University administration.
