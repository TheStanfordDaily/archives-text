YOU CAN'T SEE IT.
FEEL IT. TASTE IT.
SMELL IT.
BUT HIGH BLOOD
PRESSURE CAN HAVE
A DRAMATIC EFFECT
ON YOUR LIFE.
High blood pressure, or
hypertension, is a disease. A
potentially dangerous disease.
It can lead to heart disease
and stroke. As many as one in
four American adults has high
blood pressure. But because it
is virtually symptom free, as
many as 17 million adults have
an increased risk of heart dis
ease without knowing it.
But there is a simple, painless
procedure to find out if you
have it. Get it checked. Today.
And keep it checked. It may be
the best thing you ever did for
yourself. You never know.
