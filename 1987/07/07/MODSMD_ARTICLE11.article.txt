Pope's meeting with
Waldheim is fitting
Nick Anderson's June 30
column on Pope John Paul II
"toeing the line" was acerbic
but well-written. The part
about Kurt Waldheim's
"dysfunctional memory [that]
remembers bits and pieces of
his Nazi-tainted past only as
fast as historians publicize the
pertinent documents and
photos" has to be the best (and
nastiest) description of this
all-too-common phenomenon
I've ever read.
Nevertheless, in all fairness,
two points need be made. I, too,
disapproved of the pope's agree
ment to receive Waldheim.
However, the comments of the
pope's spokesman changed my
mind. He pointed out that the
pope frequently grants
audiences to heads of state

with whom he disagrees most
strongly.
A useful analogy here might
be trade with the Soviets.
However much you may dis
agree with the wisdom of the
policy, it's hard to argue that
campus groups like Beyond
War or Physicians for Social
Responsibility or campus pro
grams like the Arms Control
Center actually love the KGB
and approve of prison camps
when they advocate more
trade, negotiation and cultural
exchange with the USSR. Same
goes for the pope.
The second point is a more
important one of fact. Anderson
may simply not be aware that
his otherwise plausible equa
tion of Catholic Bavaria and
strong Nazism is wrong. Reli
gion and Nazism were not con
nected but opposed. The more
religious, the less likely people
were to vote Nazi. Within that

general rule, Lutherans were
more likely than Catholics to
actively support the Nazis.
Second, the Lutheran
churches had a doctrine of
respect for the state which
made it inherently more vul
nerable to Nazi manipulation
and intimidation of itself and
its members.
Third, partly because of their
form of organization and
loyalty to the pope, the Catho
lic Church and its members
were singled out for persecu
tion. They were more likely to
oppose the Nazis. So, although
Munich was Bavarian and also
the premier Nazi town, this
was ironically because religion
was weaker in the cities. In the
countryside of Bavaria, where
Catholicism was strongest, the
Nazi vote was lowest.
