# Behind the staging of Judge Bork's nomination
## 
### 
"Judicial restraint," "the crucial swing
vote" and "formidable scholarly intellect"
are phrases bandied about quite often these
days in the wake of President Reagan's
nomination of Judge Robert Bork to replace
retiring Justice Lewis Powell on the Su
preme Court. Unfortunately, the high court
tends to accrue these stock descriptions
without our knowing what they mean or
how they affect the nomination and confir
mation process.

Why are we ignorant of the machinations
of Supreme Court politics? What do these
phrases mean? Are the capsule descriptions
"unbiased intellectual" or "close-minded
conservative ideologue" valid or meaning
ful? Do the Republicans make any sense in
their defense of Bork? Or the Democrats in
their attack?
The justices are so well-hidden from
public view that whenever one leaves and
another assumes the bench, the ensuing
media blitz catches us all off guard. Press
conferences and Senate hearings take on a
surrealistic air. Witness, for example,
Reagan's staged announcement last week
of Bork's nomination.
Reagan and Bork walk into the White
House press room. Reagan forewarns the
press that the session will be simply a brief
announcement, without a question period.
He introduces Bork as "a premier constitu
tional authority ... with outstanding intel
lect and unrivaled scholarly credentials."
He urges the Senate to confirm Bork with

all dispatch. And then he says, "We are now
going to depart." The two indeed exit, stage
right. Reporters shout futile queries. Bork
smiles the whole time, wordless.
Now I'm not suggesting we all camp
outside Bork's house to monitor his comings
and goings and confidantes. I'm simply very
curious to know how he would respond to
the way politicians and the press are
analyzing and evaluating him. I suspect he
would agree that the vocabulary and con
duct of this dialogue are entirely skewed,
but I fear we won't get the chance to find
out until the Senate hearings begin — if
then.
Part of the dialogue's problem is the al
leged holiness of the office of Supreme
Court justice. As we sanctify the Constitu
tion, so we beatify its interpreters. Biblical
imagery abounds in descriptions of the doc
ument in this bicentennial year of its crea
tion. A recent issue of Time magazine
portrayed the Constitution as "The Ark of
America." The justices' opinions resemble
papal bulls as they struggle to explicate the
law.
But they're not saints, and they're not
even popes. The justices (and nominees) are
real men and women, certainly not above
critical scrutiny. With that said, I offer my
own short primer on how to decipher the
script of that curious little Reagan-Bork
five-minute, one-act play.
Judicial restraint: "Judge Bork, widely
regarded as the most prominent and intel
lectually powerful advocate of judicial
restraint, shares my view that judges' per
sonal preferences and values should not be
part of their constitutional interpreta
tions," quoth Reagan. The subtext: The
Constitution's original intent should be
strictly followed, and ideology should be
avoided at all costs. Reagan here attacks
that loaded, abused word "ideology." But

there is no escaping ideology, really. In a
basic sense, the decision to read any text
strictly or broadly is an ideological move
based on "personal preference."
Scholarly credentials: "Judge Bork's out
standing intellect and unrivaled scholarly
credentials are reflected in his thoughtful
examination of the broad fundamental le
gal issues of our times," says Reagan.
Again, an implied contrast with ideologues
who presumably don't have such creden
tials. It is a misleading statement. Scholars
cannot escape methodological choices; the
canvassing of documents always implies
selectivity, whether conscious or uncon
scious. Not to say that scholarly credentials
are unimportant, but let's not kid ourselves
by elevating scholars above their ines
capable biases.
The crucial swing vote: This is not
Reagan's phrase, but it's in the back of
everyone's mind, most of all Reagan's, as he
tries to hide his glee at the opportunity to
get a "conservative" majority on the court.
The phrase is overused and overrated. It
places undue emphasis on the vulgar ideo
logical dualism "conservative vs. liberal"
while obfuscating the real issue: Bork's in
vestigative methodology, his approach to
reading a text. Reagan and the Senate will
probably learn that the fabled "swing vote"
is not going to materialize in the long run.
In short, we ought to re-examine the
questions we put to Bork. Opposing the
categories "scholar" and "ideologue" doesn't
work because it implies that scholars, or at
least good scholars, are necessarily free
from ideology. They are not. Let's remem
ber that as the play unfolds. Then maybe
we can cut through the farcical staging
coming from both sides.

own short primer on how to decipher the
script of that curious little Reagan-Bork
five-minute, one-act play.
Judicial restraint: "Judge Bork, widely
regarded as the most prominent and intel
lectually powerful advocate of judicial
restraint, shares my view that judges' per
sonal preferences and values should not be
part of their constitutional interpreta
tions," quoth Reagan. The subtext: The
Constitution's original intent should be
strictly followed, and ideology should be
avoided at all costs. Reagan here attacks
that loaded, abused word "ideology." But

there is no escaping ideology, really. In a
basic sense, the decision to read any text
strictly or broadly is an ideological move
based on "personal preference."
Scholarly credentials: "Judge Bork's out
standing intellect and unrivaled scholarly
credentials are reflected in his thoughtful
examination of the broad fundamental le
gal issues of our times," says Reagan.
Again, an implied contrast with ideologues
who presumably don't have such creden
tials. It is a misleading statement. Scholars
cannot escape methodological choices; the
canvassing of documents always implies
selectivity, whether conscious or uncon
scious. Not to say that scholarly credentials
are unimportant, but let's not kid ourselves
by elevating scholars above their ines
capable biases.
The crucial swing vote: This is not
Reagan's phrase, but it's in the back of
everyone's mind, most of all Reagan's, as he
tries to hide his glee at the opportunity to
get a "conservative" majority on the court.
The phrase is overused and overrated. It
places undue emphasis on the vulgar ideo
logical dualism "conservative vs. liberal"
while obfuscating the real issue: Bork's in
vestigative methodology, his approach to
reading a text. Reagan and the Senate will
probably learn that the fabled "swing vote"
is not going to materialize in the long run.
In short, we ought to re-examine the
questions we put to Bork. Opposing the
categories "scholar" and "ideologue" doesn't
work because it implies that scholars, or at
least good scholars, are necessarily free
from ideology. They are not. Let's remem
ber that as the play unfolds. Then maybe
we can cut through the farcical staging
coming from both sides.
