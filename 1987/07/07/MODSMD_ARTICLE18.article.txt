## Programs improve foreign-born TA teaching 
### TARRANT MAHONY 
Foreign-born teaching assis
tants (TAs) have been the object
of increasing attention
nationwide since 1980, largely
due to the burgeoning number
of foreign graduate students in
U.S. universities. A 1983 Na
tional Science Foundation
report states that over half of
all doctoral students in engi
neering are foreign-born, and in
some fields that number has
more than doubled in the last
10 years.
As a consequence of this
growing geographic diversity in
graduate student populations,
there is a greater frequency of
cases where undergraduates,
usually in the sciences, have
trouble understanding the Eng
lish of their TAs.

In 1982, Stanford imple
mented a special training pro
gram for foreign-born TAs in an
effort to improve their language
and teaching proficiency.
The issue at Stanford and
other universities, however, is
more than a problem of lan
guage deficiency. An important
distinction should be made be
tween language deficiency and
foreign accents and styles.
While foreign-born TAs may
have almost perfect English,
their accents can become an ob
stacle to the undergraduate's
comprehension. One Stanford
student in electrical engineer
ing said that even when the
teaching and English of his TA
was excellent, "just getting ac
climated to the accent was diffi
cult."
A 1985 Wall Street Journal

article quotes USC Applied
Liguistics Prof. David Eskey as
saying, "Asian-born teaching
assistants seem to have the
most difficulty. Pronunciation
is a big problem for Chinese and
Japanese speakers."
Beverly McChesney, director
of English for Foreign Stu
dents/Linguistics at Stanford,
cautioned that the issue is a
complex one and that answers
involve more than a language
"quick-fix."
"In many cases language is
not the problem," McChesney
said. Often the difficulty lies in
the fact that the TA-to-be has
not shifted from thinking as a
student to thinking as a
teacher, a problem common to
native speakers of English as
well, she added.
Thirty-three departments at
Stanford (about half) require
doctoral students to teach,
usually in their second or third
year. Some public universities,
however, expect first-year doc
toral students to be TAs, an ad
ditional — and unfair — burden
on top of the challenge of adjust
ing to graduate study, McChes
ney said.
Stanford's training program
for potential foreign TAs in
volves an English proficiency
test to determine whether fur
ther language or teaching
training should be waived, rec
ommended or required. Those
who enroll in English for
Foreign Students/Linguistics
receive training not only in

pronunciation and fluency, but
also in classroom organization
and student-teacher interac
tion.
Hong Hao, a third-year doc
toral student in electrical engi
neering, described the course as
"very, very helpful." He also
commented on the difference
between daily conversation and
teaching. "The biggest diffi
culty, I feel, is still English. In
conversation I can talk, but to
speak alone for 50 minutes
without being boring is diffi
cult."
Michele Marincovitch, direc
tor of the Center for Teaching
and Learning and co-teacher of
the English for Foreign Stu
dents class, echoed McChes
ney's concerns. Undergradu
ates, she said, can learn much
from foreign-born TAs but are
often not willing to overcome
accents slightly different from
their own.
McChesney cited a study by
Kim Brown of the University of
Minnesota which demonstrates
that students' attitudes depend
in part on preconceived ideas
about a speaker, and are not
just objective evaluations of a
speaker's language proficiency.
In the study, to be published
in early 1988 as part of Brown's
doctoral research, 438 freshman
English students received bio
graphical information about a
candidate applying for a job.
Brown varied these fictitious
histories in three areas: ethnic
background, total years study

ing English combined with
length of time living in the
United States and the position
for which the candidate was ap
plying (TA or professor).
The students watched the
same videotape and responded
to the same questions, but their
answers varied according to the
information they had previ
ously received. For example,
the candidate was rated higher
when the students were told
that he was applying for a job as
a professor than when told he
was applying for a TA position.
According to McChesney, this
finding suggests that perceived
rank influences students'
impressions of language
proficiency. Similarly, the stu
dents' responses varied depend
ing on what ethnic background
the candidate was alledged to
have.
Marincovitch, in her article
"Rethinking the Foreign TA
Problem," writes that "under
graduates may still be slow to
accept a foreign accent and
'differentness' (whatever the
foreign TA may do)."
"We need to work on two
fronts," McChesney concluded.
She emphasized that under
graduates need to broaden their
attitudes and outlooks and that
it is a mistake to see the issue
as simply a problem of foreign
TAs and their language
proficiency.
Marincovitch further com
mented that undergraduates
would benefit greatly "if they
had the same experience." Stu
dents might be more under
standing were they required to
explain their major in Chinese,
Japanese or some other lan
guage, she said.
Perhaps the most ironic com
ment came from an undergrad
uate in electrical engineering
who couldn't follow her profes
sor and switched classes. Prob
lem: "He was from New York
and spoke too fast."
