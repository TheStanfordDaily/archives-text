# Experts anticipate bleak future for SDI

Speaking on campus recently about a study of
the technological feasibility of President
Reagan's Strategic Defense Initiative, L. Charles
Hebel of Xerox Corp. said that the administra
tion's current confidence in missile defense sys
tems is unrealistic.
Hebel and a number of the nation's most
highly qualified scientists recently concluded a
two-year study of directed-energy weapons —
crucial to SDI — which would be used as "lasers"
to destroy incoming missiles.
"We found gaps in many, many places. We
found there was insufficient information in many
different areas, insufficient laboratory informa
tion in particular, to even tell to what extent
these required extrapolations (concerning the
technological feasibility of SDI) could be made,"
he said Thursday.
Hebel called the task of determining whether
SDI is affordable or even possible a "formidable
one," and stated that such a task would take at
least 10 years to complete. "Although the
Defense Department felt we were pessimistic, I
thought we were rather realistic," he added.
Both Hebel, a research planning manager, and
Chemistry Prof. Richard Zare spoke last week at
the second in a series of seminars organized by
the Department of Aeronautics and
Astronautics.
Hebel and Zare said the study, sponsored by
the American Physical Society, concluded that
there was insufficient scientific and engineering J
knowledge to properly understand if SDI is possi
ble or even feasible. Moreover, it contends that it.
would take at least a decade of "intense research"
to make an informed decision on the potential ef
fectiveness and survivability of directed-energy
systems.
One audience member asked whether after 10
years SDI could "work." Zare answered, "There's
nothing about the laws of physics and what we
know about nature that says that certain things
can't be done, but there is a question of time and
a question as to if you have done it what have you
accomplished."
Zare also mentioned that he found it "sad" that
the only serious problems of SDI that are being
discussed are the technological ones. There is the
problem, he said, of effective counter-measures

even if SDI becomes a reality.
"For every measure there seems to be, if you
look over the history of war, a counter-measure,
and later a counter-counter-measure, and I don't
see SDI as essentially being any different."
Asked why the Russians behave as if Moscow
is shielded by an SDI "system" of its own if that
not yet technologically possible, Hebel said,
"None of us on the committee understand why
they behave as they do."

"They say they have come to the same conclu
"sion as we have: They don't think that the system
will be effective. They don't see why anyone
should start down the line of a counter-counter
counter-counter game in which both countries
spend hundreds of millions of dollars and neither
one winds up safer than they were before."
Although it was not a conclusion of the study,
Hebel believes it would nonetheless be prudent
for the United States to maintain a research and
development program in the laboratory, espe
cially since the Soviets have a very large one.
The talk was the second in a series of Stanford-
NASA-ASEE joint sponsored seminars titled
"New Science and Technology in the Aerospace
Age." These seminars are every Thursday at 8
p.m. through August 6 at Terman Auditorium.
The public is invited and there is no charge.
