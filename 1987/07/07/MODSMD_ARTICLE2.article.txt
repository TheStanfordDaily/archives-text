# New employment rules worry USW
## 
### MARK LEMLEY Staff writer 
New University employment proce
dures required by the Immigration
Act of 1986 raise "very serious con
cerns" about the treatment of
minorities and immigrants, accord
ing to a spokeswoman for United
Stanford Workers, the union
representing University employees
here.
Mary Ann Tenuto, staff legal coun
sel for USW, said that while the new
law is "somewhat oppressive," she is
more concerned about what the Im

migration and Naturalization Service
might do in the future.
Tenuto expressed particular con
cern over the possibility of random
checks by the INS and the plight of
families in which some members
qualify for the amnesty program
while others do not.
The controversy was sparked by a
federal administrative order requir
ing employers to begin complying
with the new law starting July 1. The
law is retroactive to include all
workers hired after November 6,
1986.
Those workers — and all new

employees — must verify their
eligibility to work by passing two
tests: an identity test and an employ
ment eligibility test, according to
Philip Curry, manager of personnel
record systems for the University.
In order to pass the tests,
employees must show documents. Ac
ceptable documentation for the iden
tity test includes a driver's license or
other state ID with a picture or physi
cal description. To pass the employee
eligibility test, a worker may show a
social security card, birth certificate,
alien registration card (green
card) or work visa.
Curry described the system
as an "administrative burden
on top of (the) other aspects of
the appointment process." He
said the University is making
every effort to help employees
comply with the law, including
referring them to charitable or
church groups who will act as
intermediaries between the INS
and the applicant.
The other major provision of
the act grants amnesty to ille
gal immigrants who have lived
in the United States since Janu
ary 1, 1982.
Tenuto added that while very
few University employees will
be affected by the documenta
tion provisions, several
hundred could "fall between the
cracks" — that is, they could
have arrived in the country
after the January 1982 amnesty
date but started work for Stan
ford before the November 1986
date requiring proof of employ
ment eligibility. She is con
cerned that the INS will take
further steps to try to find those
people and deport them.
Tenuto said that a primary
concern of the USW staff is the
potential for discrimination
against "foreign groups,"
whether born in the United
States or abroad.
Curry said that the law will
not require a major substantive
change in policy for the admin
istration, but will change the
procedures used for hiring. He
added that before July 1, the
University did not check up on
applicants who said that they
were U.S. citizens. Applicants
were, however, required to sign
a form under penalty of perjury.
