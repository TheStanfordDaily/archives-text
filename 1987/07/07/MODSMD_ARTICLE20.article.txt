# Media madness

### SUSAN FOX 
Forty-five years ago NBC
came to Stanford to ask the
Communications Depart
ment for help in bringing
more people, particularly
women, into news broadcast
ing to replace the many
broadcasters serving in
World War 11. In response,
Stanford created a program
that evolved into the Mass
Media Institute summer pro
gram.
For eight weeks each sum
mer 51 students intensively
study different aspects of
media in one of four seminars
on broadcast news, film, jour
nalism and radio and televi
sion. When it's over, they
walk away with valuable
preparation for jobs in their
respective areas of the indus
try.
Most of those who enroll in
the institute are Stanford
students or undergraduates
from elsewhere, while others
come from the working world
and are looking for a career
change. The remainder of the
participants are foreign stu
dents, including some from
Malaysia, South Africa, Eng
land, Italy and Taiwan.
Jules Dundes, the insti
tute's director since 1972,
began teaching for the pro
gram in 1968. His back
ground includes sports
reporting for the New York
Post and radio broadcasting
for CBS. In addition to
Dundes, Stanford Communi
cations Profs. Ron Alexander
and Jeremy Cohen, both vet

erans of the media industry ,
are among the other teachers
for the program.
According to one of this
year's participants, Alison
Blume, there is a lot of pres
sure on the program's teach
ers to deliver. "The expecta
tions of the students are very
high. Everyone wants to be
an anchor," Blume, a student
of news production, said. Al
though Blume is pursuing a
career behind the camera her
expectations are just as high.
While the institute has
enjoyed a great deal of suc
cess since its inception, some
students do leave the pro
gram disillusioned because
they find broadcasting is not
the glamorous occupation
they expected.
However, Dundes claims,
"I am aware that a great
many (of the institute's
graduates) do go into the in
dustry." Two San Francisco
newscasters — Kate Kelly of
KPIX and Suzanne Saunders
of KGO are both Stanford
graduates and graduates of
the institute's broadcast
news program.
Lisa Plazak, one of this
summer's participants, chose
the Mass Media Institute
from among the many media
programs in the country be
cause of its quality reputa
tion. "Stanford's program is
known throughout the
country as superior.
"This experience is proba
bly the best thing I will ever
have done for myself. It will
be the most beneficial part of
my education," Plazak added.
