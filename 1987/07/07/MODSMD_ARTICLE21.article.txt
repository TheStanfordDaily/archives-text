## Fred Astaire festival benefits Children's Hospital 
### JAMES R. DICKEY Editorial staff 
The Stanford Theater is once
again changing the letters on
its marquee. This time,
however, the film titles are
going from new to old, rather
than from old to new.
Starting this Friday, the
theater will show Fred Astaire
films for two weeks. The film
festival, a benefit for the Stan
ford Children's Hospital, is
funded and made possible by
the David Packard Foundation.
Through the festival, the
foundation, which has tradi
tionally been an active sup
porter of the Children's Hospi
tal, will be able to once again
benefit that worthy cause while
simultaneously helping one of
its more recent areas of inter
est: film preservation.
According to David Packard
Jr., the major organizational
force behind the festival, the
foundation has for the past two
or three years been one of the

largest private backers for film
preservation and copying.
The Fred Astaire Film Fes
tival was conceived after the
dancer's death last week. The
organization of the program re
quired several manhours and
some touchy negotiation.
Packard decided that if the
festival was to be a success in
his eyes, it must be done cor
rectly. Therefore, no efforts
were spared to make this pro
gram an authentic reproduction
of a theater experience of the
1930s and '40s. The resulting
film series is a triumph in
revivalist theater.
The Stanford Theater was
rented for the occasion. Al
though the manager of the
theater told Packard that there
was "no money in old films," he
was happy to oblige the founda
tion by renting it the
auditorium for the festival.
Next, old carbon-arc projec
tors, similar to the ones still
used in Memorial Auditorium,
were switched with the modern

platter-style projectors. Carbon
arc projectors were the type
used when Astaire's movies
were first released.
In addition, the theater is
raising the height of the screen

in order to reproduce the true
feeling of the "silver screen."
While the arrangements with
the theater were being
finalized, Packard contacted the
UCLA Film Archives, Metro-

Goldwyn-Mayer and RKO
Radio Pictures to negotiate
delivery of the films.
Prints were rented from the
UCLA Archives and MGM, but
problems arose in the arrange
ments with RKO. RKO is cur
rently involved in discussions
which may result in its pur
chase and is therefore not ren
ting any of their films, among
which are all of the Fred
Astaire-Ginger Rogers movies.
However, due to the generosity
of RKO management and the
fact that the festival is a bene
fit, the pictures have been
donated for the program.
The series includes all but
three of Astaire's films. Among
the films included are many of
the best — hits like "Top
Hat," "The Gay Divorcee,"
"Swing Time" and "Band
Wagon."
Most importantly, maintains
Packard, "I want people to
realize that even if they think
they've seen these films before,
they haven't experienced the
film the way they were meant
to be experienced — in an
audience-filled theater rather
than a living room."
The Stanford Theater is lo
cated on University Avenue in
downtown Palo Alto. Films will
be shown daily from July 10
through July 23.
