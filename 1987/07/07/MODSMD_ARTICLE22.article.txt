Drums beat, a Nigerian man offers plantain (fried
giant banana) and people dance to the latest sounds of
Kosono of Africa.
This scene may or may not be taking place on the
western side of the African continent, but it is occur
ring nightly in East Palo Alto at Club Afrique, an un
usual cultural experience.
Club Afrique is a dinner and dancing club, serving
strictly African foods. The menu, which varies from
week to week, currently includes Fufu (similar to
Yams), Plantain, Kele Wele (Plantain with ginger),
African Okra Soup and fish.
Sola Soyayo, manager of Club Afrique, explained
that the menu is being changed weekly in order to find
the preferences of the customers.

Dinner is served in a pseudo-buffet fashion in a sepa
rate dining area at the end of the restaurant farthest
from the dance floor.
Customers are encouraged to go through the buffet
line and try as many dishes as they like. Once
preferences are found, customers may order their fa
vorite dishes to be served at the table.
All the foods my guest and I chose (trout, beef, beans)
came mixed together in a spicy red sauce and served
stew-like on a large plate over rice, as is common
practice in Africa.
With a large selection of interesting foods at the flat
price of $7, it's hard to not enjoy a dinner at Club
Afrique. The rest of the club is just as enjoyable.
The club serves beer, wine and soda at the pleasant
bar and comfortable booths near the dance area. The
music is loud without being oppressive, and the African
flags hanging on the walls and ceilings are a nice at

mospheric touch.
Music varies from Afro-beat (an authentic ÜB-40ish
sound) to reggae, jazz and even pop, with a heavy em
phasis on modern African sounds. The club features
live music Wednesday through Sunday.

At the flat price of $7, it's
hard not to enjoy a dinner
at Club Afrique.

Club Afrique is located just off University Avenue in
East Palo Alto in the old Reno Club building. There is a
cover on live music nights.
