# Restaurant's atmosphere mixes casual, formal elements
## 
### JAMES R. DICKEY Editorial staff 
Hugo's Market is an unusual blend of
the most elegant in dining with the
casual elements normally found in much
less pricey restaurants. It is the casual
elements that provide most of its charm
and character.
As an "elegant dining establishment,"
Hugo's contains all the necessary ingre
dients — fashionable decor, a well
chosen wine list, exotic foods and good
service.
On the more relaxed side, the salad

and sundae bars included with dinner
provide an interesting topic of conversa
tion as well as a generous selection of
delicious dishes.
The salad bar contains all the usual
ingredients in addition to the more un
usual marinated calamari, chicken
curry salad and a delightful antipasto.
After the salad bar, my guest and I se
lected Honey Almond Duckling ($17.50)
and Cashew Chicken ($l6).
The duck was tender and juicy under a
crisp, brown skin covered in a light man
darin orange sauce. However, the al
mond slices were a bit stale and tasted

too sharp against the mandarin sauce.
The sauteed Cashew Chicken, served
on a bed of mixed rice, had a savory,
pleasing taste. The vegetables served
with both dishes were sweet and tender.
The maitre d' recommended a Car
nenet Pinot Noir Blanc ($2O) to accom
pany our entrees. The light, mellow wine
was a pleasing complement to both
meals.
After the entrees, we were directed to
Hugo's sundae bar. Though not as
generously furnished as the salad bar, it
includes a choice of two flavors of ice
cream and several basic toppings, such

as hot fudge, strawberry and caramel.
Patrons who make it past the sundae
bar will find the plush booths even
harder to get in and out of than they
were earlier in the evening. For those
who wish something other than a
sundae, a selection can be made from the
well-stocked dessert cart.
Throughout the meal service was at
tentive and patient, but not overly
hurried. A meal here could easily last
two or three hours.
Hugo's is located in Hyatt Rickeys on
El Camino in Palo Alto. Dinner is served
from 5 to 10:30 p.m.
