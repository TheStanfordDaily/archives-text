## Pat Cash, Martina Navratilova capture crowns at Wimbledon Stanford star Fendick, partner Kohlberg reach mixed doubles semis 
### CHRIS CRADER Staff writer 
Some things never change.
Once again Martina Nav
ratilova won at Wimbledon and,
once again, Ivan Lendl did not.
Navratilova won her sixth
consecutive Ladies' Singles
title, a record, and the eighth of
her career, tying another
record. By beating 18-year-old
Steffi Graf, of West Germany, 7-
5, 6-3 in the final, the 30-year
old Navratilova also was able to
hold on to the number one spot
in the world computer rankings
for at least a few more weeks.
Graf is still a close second in
the rankings and is expected to
pass Navratilova for good in the
near future.
Graf came into the tourna
ment as the favorite and was
the first woman ever to enter
the Wimbledon final unde
feated on the year (she was 45-
0). Navratilova showed how
badly she wanted the title,
however, and played a very
good match, coming through in

the clutch to win her first title
of 1987.
In the men's draw, Lendl,
who lost to Boris Becker in last
year's final, was a big favorite
after Becker was upset in the
second round by Peter Doohan.
Unfortunately for him, Pat
Cash was his opponent in the
final.
Cash, a 22-year-old Austra
lian, is one of the best grass
court players in the world, and
he proved it by crushing Lendl
7-6 (7-5), 6-2, 7-5. Cash was
stunning in his victory, losing
serve only once and not losing a
single point on serve in the
second set.
Cash became the first Aussie
to win the men's singles title in
16 years, and the first man ever
to win the title while wearing
an earring. He recorded another
Wimbledon first by climbing
into the stands to celebrate with
his relatives immediately after
his victory.
In mixed doubles, Stanford
graduate Patty Fendick
reached the semifinals with

Andy Kohlberg, the best result
for any of the former Cardinal
players in the draw. She made
it to the women's doubles final
last year and has proved that
she should be a player to watch
in singles at Wimbledon in the
next few years. She lost in the
second round this year to
Rosalyn Fairbank.
Jo Durie and Jeremy Bates,
both of Great Britain, won the
mixed doubles title this year, a
pleasant surprise for an English
crowd that has seen very few
natives do well of late.
Americans Ken Flach and
Robert Seguso won the men's
doubles championship, with a
come-from-behind 3-6, 6-7 (8-6),
7-6 (7-3), 6-1, 6-4 win over Ser
gio Casal and Emilio Sanchez.
Claudia Kohde-Kilsch and
Helena Sukova, two giants of
women's tennis at a combined
height of 12 feet, 2 and a half
inches, took the women's
doubles crown 7-5, 7-5, beating
Betsy Nagelsen and Elizabeth
Smylie.
