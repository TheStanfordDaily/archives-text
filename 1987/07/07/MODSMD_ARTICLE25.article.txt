University Games
The World University Games
began last weekend in Zagreb,
Yugoslavia with a slightly
smaller Stanford contingent
than had been planned.
The U.S. men's volleyball
team, led by Stanford coach
Fred Sturm, was to include
senior Scott Fortune among its
14 members, but Fortune suf
fered a broken finger and did
not make the trip.
Despite the loss of Fortune,
the presence of Stanford volley
ball will be felt at the games.
Jon Root, '86, will be playing for
the men's team and senior
Teresa Smith, the Pacific 10
Conference Player-of-the-Year,
will play on the women's team.
W. Germany, U.S. to
meet in water polo
The U.S. water polo team will
meet the West German team at
deGuerre Thursday. Led by
former Stanford stars Jody
Campbell, Doug Burke and
James Borgeson, the team will
try to avenge a loss to the West
Germans at the Fina Cup tour
nament held recently in Greece.
The team was defeated 8-7 in
the first round of the tourna
ment, which matches the

world's top eight teams. The
same U.S. squad beat the Ger
mans in the 1984 Olympics.
The U.S.-West German
match will be preceded by a con
test between the two-time na
tional champion Stanford Car
dinal and the Delta Water Polo
Club.
Tickets, which will be
available at the gate, cost $4 for
adults, $2 for children. The ac
tion is scheduled to begin at 6
p.m.
Zuvella: back in the
big leagues again
The New York Yankees have
recalled former Stanford star
Paul Zuvella from the Colmbus
Clippers, their Class AAA farm
team. Zuvella will fill the void
created when infielder Lenn
Sakata went down with a bro
ken ankle.
While at Stanford, Zuvella
played second base and
shortstop and was named Most
Valuable Player by the Cardi
nal in 1979. Once a highly
touted prospect in the Atlanta
Braves organization, Zuvella
has yet to produce consistently
at the major league level.
However, he has hit over .300
all season in the minors this
year, however.
