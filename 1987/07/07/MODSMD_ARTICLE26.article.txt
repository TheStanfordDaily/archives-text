## Decision pending on Zetes, alcohol policy 
### LIZ LEMPERT Staff writer 
A final decision on the fate of the Zeta
Psi fraternity and Stanford's alcohol
policy is expected in a few weeks, accord
ing to acting Dean of Student Affairs
Norm Robinson.
Robinson is reviewing a report
prepared by Michael Jackson, assistant
dean of student affairs, in response to
the drowning death of Stanford junior
David Dunshee. The report recommends
that the University revoke recognition
of the Zetes and re-examine enforcement
of University alcohol policies.
Dunshee drowned in Lake Lagunita
April 22 after leaving a Zeta Psi rush
party at the Boathouse. He had a blood
alcohol level of 0.25, two-and-a-half
times the level at which an individual is
considered legally drunk.
Robinson has asked Joe Pisano, frater
nal affairs adviser, and Diana Conklin,

assistant dean of residential education,
to submit reports on the recent history of
the Zeta Psi chapter and to share their
reactions to Jackson's recommendations.
"I'd love to get something to Norm
(Robinson) by the end of the week,"
Pisano said.
"In general, I think that the Zetes
have suffered from a relative lack of
health over the last two or three years,"
he said.
The Jackson report states that the fra
ternity broke several rules at its Boat
house rush party, including failing to
check rush cards, serving alcohol past
the 11:30 p.m. restriction and failing to
designate a sober monitor.
The Zetes lost their housing privileges
in October 1981 after a series of events
culminating in an episode in which
several fraternity members threw a
Mills College woman into a shallow ce
ment pond. After a three-year suspen
sion, the fraternity regained University

recognition but was denied housing
privileges.
At least one of the Zetes, however,
remains optimistic. The future of the fra
ternity "is bright and cheery," according
to Matt Stone, a senior member of the
fraternity.
The University alcohol policy calls for
students "to assume responsibility for
both individual and group compliance"
to the California Alcohol Beverage Con
trol Act, which prohibits drinking by
anyone under 21. The University hopes
to "provide maximum opportunity for ef
fective self-regulation which will protect
the interests of all members of the Stan
ford community," according to the
policy.
"The question is what to do with stu
dent groups who don't comply with the
alcohol policy," Robinson said. "In the
past we've relied on voluntary compli
ance, but it is becoming clear that the
people who plan parties don't know the

policy.
"I don't know that the (alcohol)
policies and guidelines are inadequate,"
Robinson continued. "It's a very difficult
area in which to work. Students, being
young people, don't always follow rules
and guidelines as they should. We try to
deal with students in an adult manner,
but this needs to be done with student
cooperation. I hope we don't have to send
in the police.
"At this point I could tell you the prob
lems but not the solutions," Robinson
said.
Changes in alcohol policy enforcement
are needed, according to Stone.
"Stanford has an alcohol policy, but it
doesn't enforce it,"he said.
"It's not a black and white problem,"
Jackson explained. "It's a concern every
one needs to work on — faculty, staff,
and students. Drinking is a serious prob
lem in society. Stanford just can't solve it
with a magic wand."
