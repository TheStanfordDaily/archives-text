# Synergy to stay co-op
## 
### EMMA STERLAND Staff writer 
The Office of Residential Education last week
reversed its May decision to change Synergy's
status from co-op to self-op in the wake of student
opposition.
Res Ed accepted most of the suggestions put
forward in a June 11 proposal by Synergy resi
dents, allowing Synergy to remain a co-op. But,
unlike Stanford's five other co-ops, Synergy resi
dents will not do their own cleaning, except in
the kitchen. The house will have University cus
todial service.
In May, the University announced that
Synergy would become a self-op next year be
cause it failed to fill 14 of its 33 residence spaces
in the second round of the Draw.
The proposal, submitted to Res Ed by Synergy
residents Jon Traugott and Eden Quainton, rec
ommended giving students the option of doing
their own cooking and cleaning or paying other
residents to do it for them.
In a June 30 letter to prospective Synergy resi
dents outlining the arrangements for next year,
Director of the Row Diana Conklin said most of
the suggestions put forward in the proposal had
been accepted.
House members will continue to do their own
cooking or will have the option of paying $250 to
those residents who cook and clean the kitchen.
The proposal was considered last Tuesday by
Conklin, acting Dean of Student Affairs Norm
Robinson and Asst. Dean of Student Affairs
Rodger Whitney.
Synergy residents are regarding Res Ed's deci
sion as a victory. "We're happy," Traugott said.
"We got most of the things we wanted.
"I feel a positive outcome of this is that we're
going to have a much better relations with Res
Ed. We listened to their points, and they listened
to ours. And we came to a good agreement," he
added.
As always, Synergy will have to fill 90 percent
of its spaces by the end of round two of next year's
housing draw or the house will face more drastic
changes and possibly elimination, Conklin said.
Some of the other arrangements are:
•Synergy's name will remain unchanged,
•Graduate students will continue to be eligible
for assignment to the house, as will students who
listed "any co-op" as a choice in the Draw,
• A speaker/film series and a SWOPSI course on
organic gardening will be held at the house,
•The Office of Row Facilities will make physical
improvements desired by house residents,
•The co-op council will be revived so that repre-
sentatives of the six co-ops can
meet to discuss their concerns,
• Laura Bonk, Synergy's resi
dent assistant for 1987-88, will
create and lead a workshop for
all RAs on promoting the co
ops, and
•Res Ed will continue to sup
port the co-ops by publicizing
the values of cooperative living.
Synergy will also have a fac
ulty advisor, Education Prof.

Henry Levin, who will not live
in the house but will meet with
students periodically to discuss
co-op governance.
Levin has written extensively
on co-op government and says
he has plenty of advice for
Synergy residents.
"A lot of the problems they
face (at Synergy) are caused by
lack of continuity," said Levin.
"Most students live there for
two years, and then they leave."
As a result, Synergy has few
resources for long-range plan
ning, according to Levin.
