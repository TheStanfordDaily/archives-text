University renovators are beginning
work today on two areas of Tresidder
Union, marking year four of an exten
sive remodeling plan for the student un
ion.
The Grand Marketplace and the
upstairs lobby will remain open for cus
tomers during the renovation, which
should be completed by September 1.
The Store, however, will undergo reno
vation in late August and will be closed
for about two weeks during that time,
according to Nancy Howe, assistant di
rector of Tresidder.
In the Grand Marketplace, workers
will install carpeting and convert two
conference rooms into seating areas.
Upstairs, there will be more lounge
seating and improved exhibit space, she
said.
Plans for The Store include expansion
into the adjoining office space, repaint

ing and new flooring. The extra space
will allow for additional refrigeration
and enable The Store to carry a wider
selection of products, Howe said.
The current remodeling efforts are
only part of an extensive renovation
plan that Howe traces back to 1983.
"The renovations come about slowly
because we have to go through a num
ber of hurdles before they can happen,"
Howe said. These include funding ap
proval, consent by the University and
project approval by the Board of Trus
tees.
Long-term projections for Tresidder
include plans to relocate the Coffee
House, the Corner Pocket, The Store
and the LOTS-II computer terminals.
The changes are necessary, Howe said,
because of a "short-term space crunch
we are suffering.
"We have to free up some space
downstairs before major renovations
