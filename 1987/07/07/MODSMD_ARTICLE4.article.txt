# Tresidder renovations slated to begin today
## News 
### KIM SAILOR Staff writer 
University renovators are beginning
work today on two areas of Tresidder
Union, marking year four of an exten
sive remodeling plan for the student un
ion.
The Grand Marketplace and the
upstairs lobby will remain open for cus
tomers during the renovation, which
should be completed by September 1.
The Store, however, will undergo reno
vation in late August and will be closed
for about two weeks during that time,
according to Nancy Howe, assistant di
rector of Tresidder.
In the Grand Marketplace, workers
will install carpeting and convert two
conference rooms into seating areas.
Upstairs, there will be more lounge
seating and improved exhibit space, she
said.
Plans for The Store include expansion
into the adjoining office space, repaint

ing and new flooring. The extra space
will allow for additional refrigeration
and enable The Store to carry a wider
selection of products, Howe said.
The current remodeling efforts are
only part of an extensive renovation
plan that Howe traces back to 1983.
"The renovations come about slowly
because we have to go through a num
ber of hurdles before they can happen,"
Howe said. These include funding ap
proval, consent by the University and
project approval by the Board of Trus
tees.
Long-term projections for Tresidder
include plans to relocate the Coffee
House, the Corner Pocket, The Store
and the LOTS-II computer terminals.
The changes are necessary, Howe said,
because of a "short-term space crunch
we are suffering.
"We have to free up some space
downstairs before major renovations
begin," she said.
Howe said that eventually
the upstairs patio will be
enclosed to provide more
meeting rooms and student of
fice space. LOTS-II will then
move upstairs, allowing the ne
cessary room for larger conver
sions on the ground level.
Under the proposed plan, the
Coffee House will move to the
present computer area, and The
Store will occupy the space cur
rently used by the Coffee
House.
The Corner Pocket will fill
The Store's vacancy, moving it
much closer to the kitchen. In
the place of the Corner Pocket,
an ice cream counter may be set
up, she added.
According to Howe, formal
planning has been underway

for some time and the larger
proposals will be taken to the
trustees this fall for concept ap
proval.
"Ideally, we should see major
changes beginning in fall
1988," Howe said.
Subject to delays in funding
and trustee approval, it appears
renovations will continue to
meet needs as they arise.
''Recent renovations have
been tied more to necessity,"
Howe noted."We've been
working on this plan for years,
and we continue to work on seg
ments as they arise."
In 1985, the information desk
and ticketing outlet moved
downstairs, conference rooms
were expanded and the bank
area was reduced. At that time,
the Credit Union and Bank of
America teller machines were
installed as well.
