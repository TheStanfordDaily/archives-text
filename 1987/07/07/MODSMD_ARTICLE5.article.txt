University officials agreed July 1
to lease 21 acres of land to Westin
Hotels and Resorts for the develop
ment of a 380-room hotel and confer

The decision was made after a Uni
versity investigation into possible
South African investments by Wes
tin produced satisfactory marks for
the company.
The property, at the intersection of
Sand Hill Road and Interstate 280 in
Menlo Park, will be leased pending
review by Menlo Park city planning
officials. Following the review, which
city officials said could take four to
five months, public hearings will
begin.
Neil Davidson, University director
of Real Estate Development, esti
mated the cost of the project to be $55

million.
The hotel is scheduled to open in
January 1991.
Westin previously owned an 11
percent interest in the Carlton Hotel
in Johannesburg, South Africa. Ac
cording to Gary Malone of the Uni
versity Treasurer's Office, Westin
sold its interest in September 1986.
Westin, which is owned by Allegis
Corp., still retains two employees at
the hotel, as part of a management
clause. "Westin has a management
agreement with all of its hotels," said
Malone. "If they sell, they must
manage them for a period of time â€”
perhaps two years."
According to Malone, Stanford gets
its information on South African in
vestments from the Investor Respon
sibility Research Center in Washing-
