Chun frees dissidents in South Korea
SEOUL, South Korea — Twelve leading South Korean
dissidents, arrested for organizing a major opposition rally
June 10, were freed from prison Monday, beneficiaries of the
unexpected success of the movement they helped create.
President Chun Doo Hwan promised to free the 12 opposi
tion leaders and hundreds of other political prisoners as part
of a major package of democratic reforms offered after the
June 10 rally sparked three weeks of street demonstrations in
cities throughout South Korea. Chun also promised a new
constitution that will allow direct presidential elections this
fall.
The dissidents, some sporting prison beards and wearing
the rough white uniforms of Korean convicts, emerged at
noon to a tumultuous welcome from hundreds of supporters,
including chief opposition leaders Kim Dae Jung and Kim
Young Sam.
"We never expected that June 10 would bring such a big
change," said the Rev. Park Hyung Kyu, 63, who has been
imprisoned six times since 1973. "There have been so many
failures before . . . But I think this time they cannot return to
repressive measures."
The government also freed 165 students and demonstrators
who had been detained since the June 10 rally. Officials said
that hundreds more, including prisoners who have served far
longer terms, will be released later this week.
NAACP blasts Bork, promises battle
WASHINGTON — Conservative and liberal groups are
preparing for a multimillion-dollar lobbying battle over the
Supreme Court nomination of appeals court judge Robert
Bork, with efforts already underway by both sides to organize
grass-root support in the states of key senators.
Almost as soon as Bork's nomination was announced last
week, both sides started to write and telephone their mem
bers, recruit other groups, bombard editorial writers with in
formation about the Senate's role in the confirmation process,
and develop advertising campaigns and legislative strategies
designed to defeat or assure Bork's elevation to the high
court.
At the NAACP annual convention in New York Monday,
delegates unanimously passed a resolution criticizing Bork's
stands on public accomodations laws, the death penalty and
affirmative action, and calling for an "all-out effort to block"
Bork's confirmation.
"We must let our senators know that a vote against Mr.
Bork is a prerequisite for our vote in the next election,"
Coretta Scott King, the widow of slain civil rights leader Mar
tin Luther King Jr., said to loud applause.
U.S. calls for end to farm subsidies
WASHINGTON — The United States urged its trading
partners Monday to join in a revolutionary restructuring of
global farm policies that would phase out subsidies within 10
years and allow free trade in agriculture.
The revisions, if carried out, could eliminate virtually the
entire $30 billion-a-year in U.S. farm support programs that
affect world trade, including irrigation and water resource
policies, agricultural extension programs and price supports.
At the same time, the 12-nation European Community
would have to abandon its $26 billion in farm subsidies, and
Japan would be forced to dismantle barriers to food imports,
especially rice.
President Reagan called the program, put on the table in
global trade talks in Geneva and simultaneously unveiled at
the White House, "the most ambitious proposal for world
agricultural trade ever offered." Prospects in Geneva for the
far-reaching proposal are uncertain, however, since other
major producers reacted coolly.
"It has become clear that ultimately no one benefits from
the current agriculture policies employed around the world —
not farmers, not consumers and not taxpayers," the president
said.
Reagan threatens to veto tax hikes
WASHINGTON — President Reagan, stepping up his cam
paign against the Democratic-controlled Congress on tax and
spending issues, promised Monday, "If a tax hike makes it to
my desk, I'll veto it in less time than it takes Vanna White to
turn the letters V-E-T-O."
In his speech, the third of a summer-long political offen
sive, the president denounced Congress' impulse to raise
taxes as part of a growing threat to basic American rights of
freedom and property. The address, to a friendly audience at
the Kiwanis International convention here, was a vintage
Reagan attack on the menace of big government.
"Make no mistake — we face a clear and present danger in
Congress," he said. "The momentum of big government,
which we've managed to hold back these last few years, has
only been gathering steam, getting ready to burst through all
the restraints we've imposed upon it."
The speech was part of a nationwide campaign aimed
against congressional Democrats, whom Reagan portrays as
reckless apostles of a tax-and-spend philosophy.
