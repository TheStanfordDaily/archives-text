# North set to testify today

WASHINGTON — The con
gressional committees investi
gating the Iran-contra affair
are bracing for what promises
to be the most gripping tes
timony of their summer-long
hearings: that of Lt. Col. Oliver
North, the central figure in the
scandal, who, until now has
maintained a strict silence
about the secret and possibly il
legal operations he ran from the
White House complex.
House Committee Chairman
Lee Hamilton, D-Ind., said that
initial questioning Tuesday was
likely to center on what Presi
dent Reagan might have known
about the diversion of profits
from the Iranian arms sales to
Nicaragua's contra rebels.
"That will come up early on,"
Hamilton said. "It's the major
issue."
Hamilton and others on the
two investigating committees
noted that they would be more
vulnerable to surprise in their
first public face-off with North
than they had been with almost

every other witness. That is be
cause North agreed to appear
only after receiving assurances
that an initial private question
ing session would be limited to
his knowledge of Reagan's role.
Still, Senate counsel Arthur
Liman noted that the lack of
rehearsal did not mean commit
tee members were likely to be
blind-sided bv anything North
has to say. "We have prepared
for this day for six months,"
Liman said.
Indeed, the accounts the com
mittee has heard from other
witnesses have been a prelude
to what North has to tell them.
North — who has been charac
terized as everything from a su
perpatriot to a "loose cannon"
— was the chief White House
operative in the secret sale of
U.S. arms to the Tehran regime
in 1985 and 1986. And despite a
ban then on U.S. aid to
Nicaragua's contra rebels, he
also diverted $3.5 million of the
profits from those arms sales to

his secret network supplying
weapons to the insurgents.
All three major broadcast
networks and Cable News Net
work plan live coverage of
North's testimony, which is
scheduled to begin Tuesday at 9
a.m. EDT. North's questioning,
first by committee counsel and
then by lawmakers, is expected
to last at least four days.
North will be testifying under
a congressional grant of limited
immunity, which means that
special prosecutor Lawrence
Walsh will not be able to use
any information he gathers
from North's statements in a
criminal prosecution of the
Marine lieutenant colonel.
Although committee mem
bers have remained silent about
what North said in less than
two hours of private testimony
last week, they have dropped
hints that North's testimony is
not likely to be the final word
on Reagan's role.
