## Program will move from villa Florence campus to make changes in '88 
### ATUL GAWANDE 
Stanford's overseas program
in Florence, Italy, will undergo
major changes next year, in
cluding a move from its current
site and a broadening of its cur
riculum, according to Overseas
Studies Director Thomas Hel
ler.
The main change is the
planned move from the Stan
ford villa, a luxurious estate
just outside Florence which has
housed the program since 1973,
to a new property in Florence
directly on the Arno River, Hel
ler said Wednesday.
Overseas officials hope the
new facilities will help students
integrate into the community,
both intellectually and socially,
according to Heller.
Heller said the move will oc
cur in two stages. Beginning
winter quarter 1988, classes
and administrative offices will
relocate to the new property,
the Arno River in Florence.
For the fall, the program will
remain at the villa. During win
ter, students will live at the
villa but take classes at the new
facility.
Describing the new program
center, Heller said that "if there
were a Classroom and Garden
magazine, this facility would be
featured."
Beginning in September
1988, students will live with
families "in popular neighbor
hoods" or in apartments with
Italian students, Heller said.
Overseas Studies has already
hired scouts for these arrange
ments and will offer winter and

spring students next year a
choice between the villa and
community living, he said.
In response to criticisms that
"the academic range was not
wide enough," changes have
been proposed to broaden the
program's academic structure,
Heller said.
In addition to courses each
quarter in Italian art, history
and literature, the program will
offer two thematic focuses, with
faculty cooperation from His
tory Prof. Judy Brown and Ital
ian Prof. Jeffrey Schnapp.
The first theme, "The Pres
ence of the Past," focuses on
representations of the past and
the re-creation and evolution of
histories in Florence.
The second, "Contemporary
Italy in the European Commu
nity," deals with aspects of cur
rent Italian politics and prob
lems "from economic
reconstruction to terrorism,"
Heller said.
While requirements for en
trance to the Florence program
will not change, Overseas
Studies administrators and
members of the Italian Depart
ment have discussed altering
the content of introductory Ital
ian language courses, Heller
said. Two quarters of Italian
language are currently re
quired for the Florence pro
gram.
The Stanford program loca
tion at the villa has long been a
popular one. Senior Julie
Moreno said many students
found that living in the villa
"eased the culture shock" be
cause of the community of Stan

ford students.
Senior Kathleen Hobson, who
spent last quarter in the
Florence program, said that it's
"hard to imagine giving up the
villa and its idyllic estate in the
hills above Florence."
Heller admitted that the
major drawback of the changes
was losing the villa, "an ar
chitectural landmark." But he
cited criticisms that its "enclave
nature" bred isolation. "There
is no change in the peer cul

ture," he said.
Having lived in the villa him
self, Heller found there was "a
range of students who were not
intellectually absorbed." He
said that evaluations consis
tently reflected these criticisms.
Nancy Padgett, deputy direc
tor of Overseas Studies, said
many students who stayed in
the program an extra quarter
and lived in apartments found
that quarter to be far more

profitable.
Turning to the advantages of
the program changes, Heller
said he envisioned better inte
gration into Italian life and uni
versities for the students in the
new program as well as wider
academic offerings.
An ongoing orientation pro
viding "survival and apprecia
tion skills" is planned to cush
ion some of the culture shock
without diluting the cultural
experience, he added.
