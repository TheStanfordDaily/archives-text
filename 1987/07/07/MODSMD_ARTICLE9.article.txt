The situation in South Korea changed dramatically last
week. Roh Tae Woo, President Chun Doo Hwan's hand
picked successor, announced he would accept virtually all the
demands made by the opposition party.
A month ago, such a turn of events seemed improbable, if
not impossible, but today they are nothing short of reality.
Since the Korean War, the small Asian nation has been ruled
by authoritarian regimes. Roh's extraordinary concessions
mean that from now on the nation will have a president
elected by the people instead of one chosen by the ruling elite.
In addition, Roh has promised to make constitutional
reforms and has called for the release of many of South
Korea's political prisoners. Perhaps most importantly, Roh
has called for the reforms to take place immediately. Chun's
ambiguity about when the reforms would take place invoked
great ire among the opposition in the past.
Despite the events of the past week, though, the protests
are continuing. They are less violent and there is less friction
between protestors and the police, but they are continuing.
The casual observer might be confused by the current
protests and ask why they persist. The answer is both simple
and complex. The simple issue involves the quarreling over
details. For example, the opposition wants all political
prisoners released, but the government is only willing to
release some of them.
The complexity is more psychological in nature. The oppo
sition has been promised changes before only to find itself left
with broken promises and few substantial changes. Now it
seems they must keep up the pressure to make sure the gov
ernment backs their words with action.
Other nations should move to support the opposition. The
U.S. government has a great deal of influence with the South
Koreans, and President Reagan must use that influence to
make certain that Chun keeps his word. The International
Olympic Committee should notify the South Koreans that a
strong showing of commitment to reforms would guarantee
that the 1988 Olympics will not be moved elsewhere.
In the coming weeks, both sides should be able to iron out
the remaining differences and the government could even set
a date for the situation. Such an action would alleviate some
of the opposition's uneasiness.
Last year we saw Haiti and the Philippines add their
names to an ever-growing list of countries that shine under
the light of democracy. Now South Korea is ready to
renounce authoritarianism and be illuminated by that very
same light. Let us hope it is not extinguished before it has
even been given a chance to burn.
