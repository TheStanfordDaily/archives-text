Corrections for
'Predator' review
After seeing "Predator" last
weekend, I just had to make a
few comments about Jim
Durkin's review. While I agree
that "Predator" was not one of
Arnold Schwarzenegger's bet
ter movies, some of the infor
mation in Durkin's review was
dead wrong. It's petty, I know,
but it irks me, and I'd like to
set some of the facts straight.
• The alien in "Predator" is not
invisible. True, it can
camouflage itself against its
background, but its outline is
still clearly visible. Imagine a
seven-foot-tall walking mirror
and you get the general idea.
• The predator can be

wounded. There's a scene at
least a minute long that proves
it. Besides, if you listened to
the radio and TV commercials
carefully, you may have heard
Arnold say, "If it bleeds, we can
kill it." Why else would any
movie exploit guns that belong
on an aircraft carrier?
• The predator cannot see
through trees. In fact, it can't
see through anything solid.
What it can see is heat.
Whereas we see objects by
shape and color, the predator
sees objects according to their
temperature. Remember those
Gatorade commercials where
they showed what a hot man
looked like on a heat scan, and
how he changed color after he
drank the Gatorade and cooled
down? That's how the predator

"sees." Which brings me to my
last gripe:
• The reason the alien can't see
through mud is because mud,
when packed, tends to cool you
off. That's partly why pigs and
hippos wallow in it in the sum
mertime. So when Schwar
zenegger accidentally covers
himself in the stuff, the preda
tor can't "see" him.
Am I being picky? Probably.
But I hate to see a movie mis
represented, no matter how bad
it is. "Predator" may not have
been on the same caliber as,
say, "The Terminator" or
"Commando," but I think if one
is going to criticize a film, the
least one can do is criticize it
accurately.
