## 'Approaching Stanford' highlights intellectual life 
### CAROL WATSON 
A couple of months after
Stanford's acceptance letters go
out and the fateful reply cards
come in, future freshmen, still
trapped in the limbo between
high school graduation and the
Farm's orientation, receive
"Approaching Stanford."
This summertime publication
provides the freshman class
with a carefully crafted glimpse
of college life at Stanford —
everything from Western Cul
ture Program options to acces
sories necessary for dorm
rooms.
The cover of "Approaching
Stanford" has reflected the
many different periods since it
first appeared in 1970, but
recently the contents have un
dergone as much, if not more,
change.
The book originally had an ir
reverent tone and focused on
student attitudes toward Stan
ford. But two years ago the
focus of the publication was
completely changed. The
revamped book emphasizes stu
dent intellectual life and pro
moting academic opportunities
as "intellectual activites" in
stead of simply coursework.

Sections highlighting interdis
ciplinary programs, student re
search opportunities and the re
lationship between technology
and the humanities have been
added.
The "Academics" section
found in the earlier bulletins
has evolved into "Academics:
Playground of the Mind," and a
new section on "Learning
Places" is complete with
pictures and descriptions of the
libraries as well as the more off
beat student observatory and
Jaspar Ridge.
The book's increased atten
tion to intellectualism and
academics was the result of a
recommendation made by
Carolyn Lougee, former dean of
Undergraduate Studies.
But many contest that the
new book is too celebratory,
that it paints a skewed picture
of what life at Stanford is really
like.
Ellen Woods, managing
editor of "Approaching Stan
ford," doesn't believe that view
is justified. "To some extent I
think they're right, but there's
a purpose — we want to cele
brate so that [the incoming
freshmen] have got a reason to
celebrate," she said.

In addition, Woods believes
that balance is added by the
pithy student quotations scat
tered along the margins. "The
student quotes point in the type
of questioning direction that we
hope our students -come in
with," she said. Providing fur
ther balance is a concluding sec
tion of student reflections that
offer thoughtful critiques of
Stanford life.
According to Woods, she and
Dean Lougee "wanted
'Approaching Stanford' updated
to reflect new interests of new
generations of students." Intel
lectualism and commitment to
public service top this list of in
terests, she said.
Kathryn Thoelecke, staff ad
viser to "Approaching Stanford"
from 1977-85, lauds the
changes that have been made.
"It has definitely been
strengthened by the dean's in
terest in academics and intel
lectualism," she said.
As a new adviser, Thoelecke
worried about how well the
book conveyed academic infor
mation. At that time, the stu
dent editors' strength lay in
welcoming the freshmen. The
book was less concerned with
academics.

An example of the publica
tion's irreverence is a statement
in the opening paragraph of the
1975 edition that confronts the
unspoken and gnawing doubt
felt by many freshmen: "After
that initial ego trip in April
when you got a letter from Fred
(Hargadon, former dean of Un
dergraduate Admissions), and
you made your decision to go to
Stanford, you probably asked
yourself many times, 'What the
hell am I getting myself into?"'
The same edition casually
refers to Lei and Stanford as a
robber baron and pokes fun at
learning: "Of course, academia
rears its head periodically, but
sandwiched in between tennis
and beach trips, even
academica can be interesting."
When the book was first pub
lished a tremendous gap existed
between the students and the
faculty and administration. At
that time, Douglas Davis, then
associate dean of Undergradu
ate Studies, conceived of the
book as a way for students to
orientate incoming freshmen.
In the first publication, writ
ten and designed by four fresh
men, the ideal learning envi
ronment in which students and
professors exchange ideas as

equals is juxtaposed with a sec
tion entitled "In Reality" that
addresses the flaws in the edu
cation process at Stanford.
"My feeling about their
frankness," Woods recalled,
"was that it was in direct
response to get students to take
responsibility for their lives.
The book in 1970 reflected a
time when students had no
voice. The difference in 1987 is
that students now have to be
cajoled into serving on commit
tees previous students had
fought to serve on."
With its increased attention
to academics, the book is now
less flippant. Woods describes
the its tone as "friendly."
The aim of the revised publi
cation is to calm otherwise in
timidated freshmen while at
the same time challenging
them to take advantage of the
many opportunities — aca
demic and otherwise —
available here.
With the shift in directorship
of "Approaching Stanford"
came a number of changes.
While the publication still
relies completely on student
writing, the students are now
referred to as "reporters" in
stead of "editors."

A couple of months after
Stanford's acceptance letters go
out and the fateful reply cards
come in, future freshmen, still
trapped in the limbo between
high school graduation and the
Farm's orientation, receive
"Approaching Stanford."
This summertime publication
provides the freshman class
with a carefully crafted glimpse
of college life at Stanford —
everything from Western Cul
ture Program options to acces
sories necessary for dorm
rooms.
The cover of "Approaching
Stanford" has reflected the
many different periods since it
first appeared in 1970, but
recently the contents have un
dergone as much, if not more,
change.
The book originally had an ir
reverent tone and focused on
student attitudes toward Stan
ford. But two years ago the
focus of the publication was
completely changed. The
revamped book emphasizes stu
dent intellectual life and pro
moting academic opportunities
as "intellectual activites" in
stead of simply coursework.

Sections highlighting interdis
ciplinary programs, student re
search opportunities and the re
lationship between technology
and the humanities have been
added.
The "Academics" section
found in the earlier bulletins
has evolved into "Academics:
Playground of the Mind," and a
new section on "Learning
Places" is complete with
pictures and descriptions of the
libraries as well as the more off
beat student observatory and
Jaspar Ridge.
The book's increased atten
tion to intellectualism and
academics was the result of a
recommendation made by
Carolyn Lougee, former dean of
Undergraduate Studies.
But many contest that the
new book is too celebratory,
that it paints a skewed picture
of what life at Stanford is really
like.
Ellen Woods, managing
editor of "Approaching Stan
ford," doesn't believe that view
is justified. "To some extent I
think they're right, but there's
a purpose — we want to cele
brate so that [the incoming
freshmen] have got a reason to
celebrate," she said.

In addition, Woods believes
that balance is added by the
pithy student quotations scat
tered along the margins. "The
student quotes point in the type
of questioning direction that we
hope our students -come in
with," she said. Providing fur
ther balance is a concluding sec
tion of student reflections that
offer thoughtful critiques of
Stanford life.
According to Woods, she and
Dean Lougee "wanted
'Approaching Stanford' updated
to reflect new interests of new
generations of students." Intel
lectualism and commitment to
public service top this list of in
terests, she said.
Kathryn Thoelecke, staff ad
viser to "Approaching Stanford"
from 1977-85, lauds the
changes that have been made.
"It has definitely been
strengthened by the dean's in
terest in academics and intel
lectualism," she said.
As a new adviser, Thoelecke
worried about how well the
book conveyed academic infor
mation. At that time, the stu
dent editors' strength lay in
welcoming the freshmen. The
book was less concerned with
academics.

An example of the publica
tion's irreverence is a statement
in the opening paragraph of the
1975 edition that confronts the
unspoken and gnawing doubt
felt by many freshmen: "After
that initial ego trip in April
when you got a letter from Fred
(Hargadon, former dean of Un
dergraduate Admissions), and
you made your decision to go to
Stanford, you probably asked
yourself many times, 'What the
hell am I getting myself into?"'
The same edition casually
refers to Lei and Stanford as a
robber baron and pokes fun at
learning: "Of course, academia
rears its head periodically, but
sandwiched in between tennis
and beach trips, even
academica can be interesting."
When the book was first pub
lished a tremendous gap existed
between the students and the
faculty and administration. At
that time, Douglas Davis, then
associate dean of Undergradu
ate Studies, conceived of the
book as a way for students to
orientate incoming freshmen.
In the first publication, writ
ten and designed by four fresh
men, the ideal learning envi
ronment in which students and
professors exchange ideas as

equals is juxtaposed with a sec
tion entitled "In Reality" that
addresses the flaws in the edu
cation process at Stanford.
"My feeling about their
frankness," Woods recalled,
"was that it was in direct
response to get students to take
responsibility for their lives.
The book in 1970 reflected a
time when students had no
voice. The difference in 1987 is
that students now have to be
cajoled into serving on commit
tees previous students had
fought to serve on."
With its increased attention
to academics, the book is now
less flippant. Woods describes
the its tone as "friendly."
