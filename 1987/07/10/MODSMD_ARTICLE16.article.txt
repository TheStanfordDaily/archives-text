# Stanford professors sit in $1,600,000 'chairs'

In the 13th century, Oxford Univer
sity created the world's first endowed
professorship to honor one of its
prominent professors. Throughout the
centuries, that professorship endured
and the concept flourished. Almost all of
the world's major universities, including
Stanford, have adopted the idea.
Between 1983 and 1986, Stanford
created 23 endowed professorships,
bringing the the total number of chairs
here to 193. Through the Centennial
campaign, Stanford will establish 100
new chairs to further the endowed
professorship program.
But why are endowed professorships
so important to the University? Many
students have heard of endowed chairs
but understand little about them.
The process by which an endowed
professorship is created and then given
to a professor begins in the development
office. There, potential donors work with
University officials to hammer out the
legal terms of a donation. Donors who
wish to give in the range of $1 million
are encouraged to sponsor an endowed
professorship in their name.
Currently, the minimum donation re

quired for an endowed professorship is
$1.2 million. This price is, like tuition,
about twice what it was in 1972. Dona
tions are supplemented by an additional
$400,000 in matching funds from an un
disclosed source within the University.
Ultimately, the $1.6 million is invested
and an annual payout of 4.75 percent is
used to defer, and in some cases cover,
the cost of the professor's salary.
An endowment does not increase the
salary of a professor, it simply replaces
the portion normally paid by the Univer
sity. Excess returns on the investment
are plowed back into the endowment so
that its earnings rise with inflation.
Donors may select which of the Uni
versity's seven schools they wish to be
queath their gifts. They may also choose
a particular area, like undergraduate
education or a certain field of engineer
ing, to support with their donations.
However, Stanford stipulates that
donors may not endow a particular pro
fessor. Such a specific identification
spoils the aim of the endowed professor
ship program — to honor general aca
demic scholarship. In practice, though,
there is a way for devious donors to
honor favored individuals — they can
narrow the criteria so much that only

one professor fits it.
Most often, though, the dean of the se
lected school is responsible for choosing
a professor for a newly created chair.
That dean, while both accomodating the
wishes of the donor and soliciting advice
from department heads, ultimately
makes a recommendation to the provost.
The provost, after receiving the concur
rence of the University president,
nominates the selected professor to the
Board of Trustees and the Advisory
Board of the Academic Council. Those
bodies make the final decision.
In very few cases, the donor has no
preference which school receives the
professorship. In such instances the

provost selects any professor in the Uni
versity. There are five such chairs at
Stanford, one of which is the William R.
Kenan Jr. Professorship held by History
Prof. Lewis Spitz. This chair was estab
lished with the wish that it "support and
encourage a scholar and teacher whose
enthusiasm for learning, commitment to
teaching and sincere personal interest in
students will enhance the learning proc
ess and make an effective contribution to
the undergraduate community."
Such an explicit desire to enhance un
dergraduate education is rare among the
many guidelines of various donors. But
Dick Bennett of the Office of Develop
ment defended the failure of con
tributors to focus on undergraduate
teaching, noting that many endowed
professorships help undergraduates.
"The professors often teach undergradu
ate courses," he said.
The argument that endowed professor
ships serve undergraduates is question
able. However, one objective of the Cen
tennial campaign is to create 12 profes
sorships designed to honor those who
have demonstrated an interest in
strengthening undergraduate teaching.
The provost will make the selections to
fill these chairs.
