# Stanford MEChA influences both local and state policies
## 
### ERIN MARTIN Staff writer 
Last April about 7,000 people marched on
Sacramento's Capitol building to protest California
budget cuts in education.
In response to the protest, the California Legislature
increased the education budget. According to one of
Stanford's MEChA marchers, Lucky Gutierrez, the
demonstration had the effect of generally increasing
the state's attention to education.
This summer, MEChA has not let education issues
slip from its sight. Many chapters, including Stan
ford's, are writing letters to push for the bilingual edu
cation bill currently being discussed in the Legislature.
MEChA enjoys a great deal of influence at Stanford,
according to its members.
"The march and, later, the Western Culture debate
were the triggers to the movement behind the Rainbow
Agenda," Jerilyn Lopez Mendoza, a MEChA activist,
said.

"After the march, the dialogue kept going between
MEChA, the BSU (Black Student Union) and AASA
(Asian-American Students Association). The Rainbow
Agenda came about as a continuation of a network of
people," Mendoza added.
Like the march on Sacramento, the Rainbow
Agenda, a coalition established to confront racism, suc
cessfully drew attention to the concerns of ethnic
minority students.
MEChA at Stanford was established in the late
1960s and rallied against minority oppression until the
early 1980s. But in 1983 MEChA faded, losing all its
members due to internal problems.
According to Cecilia Burciaga, associate dean of
Graduate Studies and resident fellow at Casa Zapata,
MEChA was revived in 1985 after redefining their
guidelines.
Membership in MEChA is not limited to those of any
given nationality. "Anyone can belong as long as they
agree with the general spirit of MEChA," said alumna
Patricia Barrera.

In addition to being closely connected to statewide is
sues, MEChA looks at problems that affect Chicanos
and Latinos within the Stanford community, such as
student affairs and support of the United Stanford
Workers. (USW).
Last March, a conflict developed at Florence Moore
Hall when a University Food Service administrator
would not allow Spanish-speaking employees to speak
their native language at work. MEChA, in conjunction
with the USW and the Student Labor Support Commit
tee, pressured Food Service to end the restriction. As a
result, the administrator was moved to another posi
tion and the workers were allowed to speak Spanish.
MEChA also pressured Food Service this spring to
stop serving grapes because of potentially harmful
health effects of pesticides on farm workers. The
boycott has not lasted, however, according to MEChA
members. As a compromise with those who oppose ser
ving grapes, Food Service officials have now promised
to distribute literature throughout the campus explain
ing the pesticide problems.
