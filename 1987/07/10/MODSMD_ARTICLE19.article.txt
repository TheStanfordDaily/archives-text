# Happiness comes to the Peninsula
## 
### STEVEN K. GLIKBARG Editorial staff 
Until recently, eating really good
Chinese food involved either driving to San
Francisco or staying on the Peninsula and
paying outrageous prices.
Now there is a third choice — the Happy
Lye Lye. Serving some of the best Chinese
food around Stanford at reasonable prices
makes this restaurant one not to miss.
Two skylights and a high ceiling create a
very open and comfortable atmosphere in
this small restaurant. Dress is casual and
the dining area is well-lit.
My guest and I were promptly seated and
served tea. We decided to start off with an
order of Pot Stickers ($3.25) and Hot and
Sour Soup ($3.25). Pot Stickers are made of
pork and vegetables wrapped in dough and
then lightly fried. Served with a variety of
sauces, including chili sauce and vinegar,
the "stickers" were very good.

The Hot and Sour Soup was thick with
meat, egg and vegetables. Our serving for
two could easily have fed three. Since all
hot dishes can be adjusted upon request at
the Happy Lye Lye, we asked for our soup
to be spicier than normal and were very
pleased with the higher level of seasoning.
Our next dish was Mu Shu Pork ($5.25).
Mu Shu items are traditionally served as
appetizers before the main entrees. This
sweet dish consists of seasoned pork, egg,
onion and bamboo shoots.
In preparing Mu Shu Pork, diners add
plum sauce to the meat and wrap it in a
flour pancake. Our pancakes folded without
cracking, proving their freshness. Without
a doubt, Happy Lye Lye's Mu Shu Pork was
much better than average.
We ordered two entrees — Mongolian
Beef ($5.75) and Szechuan Shrimp ($6.25).
The Mongolian Beef — strips of beef and
onion in a spicy red chili sauce — was
served on a bed of fried noodles. I had never

had this dish with fried noodles before, but
their addition improved the texture of the
course.
The shrimp dish was the only disappoint
ment during the evening. The shrimp was
covered in a heavy batter that detracted
from the delicate flavor of the shrimp and
the somewhat sweet and spicy sauce.
Throughout the meal the service was
very attentive to our needs without giving
us the feeling Of being rushed. The restau
rant prepares vegetarian dishes upon re
quest.
According to owner and Stanford
graduate Morris Wu, "The name says it all
— we'd like to have our customers leave
happy about everything — the food, atmos
phere and service."
Located at 406 California Ave. in Palo
Alto, the restaurant is open from 11 a.m. to
9:30 p.m. Monday through Thursday and
from 11 a.m. to 10 p.m. on Friday and Sat
urdays.
