# South Africa fund might bypass review
## 
### BRIAN RHOADS Staff writer 
An educational fund equal in size to the Uni
versity's revenue from South Africa-related in
vestments might be approved by the administra
tion instead of waiting for final review by the
Board of Trustees.
If approved, the Stanford South Africa Fund
fund will be used to finance educational pro
grams related to South Africa, such as intern
ships there for Stanford students or scholarships
for South African blacks.
The proposal for the South Africa Fund is cur
rently being discussed in several University de
partments, according to Fred Hillier, chair of the
Commission on Investment Responsibility.
The CIR is a group of students, faculty, staff
and alumni that makes investment recommenda
tions to the trustees' Special Committee on In
vestment Responsibility (SCIR).
"It is quite possible that the administration
will deal with the South Africa Fund on its own,
so the issue won't have to face the trustees
again," said Hillier.
The fund was tabled at last month's SCIR
meeting due to lack of time. The next meeting is
scheduled for September.
"The issues were brought up so late on the
agenda" that commmittee members weren't able
to reach a decision on the South Africa Fund, Hil
lier said.
Upon tabling the proposal the trustees sugges
ted that University officials look into the fund,
and according to Hillier, headway is being made.
"We've gotten the provost's office involved, and
(University President) Donald Kennedy looked
at it and expressed interest," he said.
The proposal has also been given to "faculty
members whose areas of study are related to the
issue," Hillier said.
Assistant to the Provost Jacyn Lewis com
mented, "There has been discussion within ad
ministrative circles on the (South Africa Fund)
proposal."
Provost Jim Rosse added, however, that
"nothing has been decided."
The fund would equal the revenue drawn on
Stanford's South Africa-related investments,
which Hillier estimates could reach between
$50,000 and $100,000 annually.
