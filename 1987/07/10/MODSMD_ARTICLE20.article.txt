L'Annee des Meduses ***%
(The Year of the Jellyfish)
Aquarius
430 Emerson St., Palo Alto
Rated R
This is a wonderfully sensual
French film starring Valerie
Kapriski and Bernard Giar
deau. Shot on location in the
French Riviera, "Meduses"
depicts the vacation of a woman
undergoing the first stages of
midlife crisis and her daughter,
a nineteen-year-old (Kapriski)
who is driven to sexually domi
nate everyone she encounters.
Kapriski seduces one of her
father's business associates, his
father, a German man and the
German's wife. In the
meantime, her mother falls
prey to the charms of the local
Riviera pimp (Giardeau).
Giardeau is the only one who
fails to fall for Kapriski. But in
the end Kapriski gets him too,
though in a very different way.
The movie is superbly shot,
keeping the viewer constantly
interested in the beautiful
beach and the beautiful people
who vacation there. During the
course of the film, the viewer in
evitably becomes entranced
with the amazingly sensual
Kapriski. This is a very good
film that's well worth seeing.
Because of the excessive nudity,
however, it is not for younger
viewers.

Roxanne ****
Century 10
1500 Sterlin Road, Mountain
View
Rated PG
In this modern-day romantic
comedy version of the classic
Cyrano de Bergerac story, Steve
Martin portrays C.D. Bales, a
small-town fire chief with a
nose that would put the likes of
Jimmy Durante and Bob Hope
to shame.
Bales falls in love with
Roxanne, a budding astro
physicist played by Daryl Han
nah (just play along), but is un
derstandably shy about ap
proaching her because of "the
nose."
Enter Chris, a handsome
young firefighter played by
Rick Rossovich (Slider in "Top
Gun"). He and Roxanne fall in
love at first sight without actu
ally speaking.
The problem is that Chris is
not what you could call an intel
lectual. His most romantic lines
are: "When I saw her I felt
horny," and "You've got a great
body — let me fluff your pil
lows." So he hires C.D. to
ghostwrite love letters to
Roxanne, who falls in love with
the prose.
C.D. decides he can't go on
with the idea of vicariously
romancing Roxanne through
the letters and struggles with
how to tell her the truth.
There are several noteworthy
supporting performers. One is
Fred Willard as the mayor, who

is reminiscent of Frank Bon
ner's Herb Talek character in
f 'WKRP in Cincinnati." An
other notable is Shelly Duvall,
who is no longer so skinny that
viewers feel the need to send
her food packages.
The only weak spot in the
cast is Hannah, who at times
makes the viewer wonder what
Martin sees in her. Her un
grateful reaction to C.D.'s flat
tery is perplexing and, though
perhaps part of the plot, sense
less.
Without a doubt this is Mar
tin's movie. In addition to star
ring, he wrote and directed it. It
has everything — romance,
laughs, even action of a sort.
For the first time, Martin ap
pears to be an extraordinarily
talented performer with some
thing more substantial to say
than, "Let's get small." He's al
ways been funny, but now his
humor relies on wit and charm
with little slapstick. His charac
ter is sensitive and gallant, a
classic portrayal of the love-sick
romantic who says things like,
"When I saw you it was like
looking at the sun too long; I
closed my eyes and you were
still there."
Without giving too much to
think about, "Roxanne" will en
tertain all audiences. At times
it's amusing, at times touching
and at others just plain
hilarious. Possibly the best
comedy of the summer.

Here's a movie for everyone
who enjoys anything remotely
funny.
Dennis Quaid plays a "Top
Gun" kind of gung-ho he-man
ready to be experimentally in
jected into a rabbit. Industrial
spies attack, causing the direc
tor of the experiment to acci
dently put Quaid in the un
suspecting Martin Short's
shorts instead.
The charm of the movie
comes from the interaction be
tween Short and Quaid and the

balance reached between the
neurotic, self-conscious hypo
chondriac and the egotistical,
macho fighter.
Of course, the hypochondriac
has to become a fighter in order
to save the day and the girl both
men have fallen for — but he
does so with such style it's hard
to see it as the corruption of an
innocent rather than the reve
lation of a late bloomer.
The movie is as appealing as
the premise is preposterous.
The dance and make-over
scenes of Short are alone worth
the price of admission. Director
Steven Spielberg has a real
winner on his hands once again.
This is a definite must-see.

Peter Weller and Ronny Cox star in next week's release,
"Robocop," which appears to be standard fare for the rest of the
summer — strange ideas with as little promise as today's release,
"Revenge of the Nerds II."
