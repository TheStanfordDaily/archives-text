## Great performances, great stories mark 1st half of season 
### 
It's our national pastime's midseason
again, and that means it's time for the
All-Star break. Typically sportswriters
use this as an opportunity to look back
on the first half of the year and look
ahead to the second half. Being a fairly
typical sportswriter, I'll do the same.

The American League's parade of in
teresting rookies is once again far more
impressive than the National League's
contingent. Last year, the "junior cir
cuit" produced sluggers like Cory
Snyder, Jose Canseco, Wally Joyner,
Danny Tartabull, Pete Incaviglia and
Ruben Sierra. The best in the National
League was a "rear back and fire" relief
pitcher named Todd Worrell. Worrell
reminds me of Goose Gossage during a
slump — throws hard but often gets hit
harder.
This year the AL's encore presentation
includes Mark McGwire, Kevin Seitzer,
Ellis Burks, Bo Jackson, Devon White,
Matt Nokes and B.J. Surhoff. Again, the
NL's best is a pitcher — left-hander Joe
Magrane. Magrane has pitched well but
is better known for quotes like "I'll be
back in a fortnight" (after he was placed
on the 15-day disabled list).
The National League has developed
its share of players in the past two years.
A team including Andres Galarraga,
Eric Davis, Kal Daniels and Will Clark

would be quite formidable. But it simply
doesn't measure up to the overwhelming
number of young stars playing in the
AL.
What does it all mean? Probably not a
whole hell of a lot. The St. Louis Car
dinals have but one slugger — Jack
Clark — and are outscoring nearly
everyone in both leagues.
Speaking of Clark, he barely beats out
Andre Dawson for the first-half MVP
award. Clark is hitting .306 with 25
home runs and 82 runs batted in. While
he was hurt last year the Cardinals
scored the fewest runs in the NL. Daw
son has almost single-handedly turned
the Cubs around. His stats aren't quite
as good as Clark's (.297, 24 HRs, 74
RBI), but his impact has been nearly as
large.
In the AL the award goes to George
Bell, hands down. This alleged "bad boy
of the Blue Jays," who has had trouble
with the media in the past, is letting his
bat do the talking this year (.294, 28
HRs, 73 RBI). If the Blue Jays are to win
their division, George Bell will need a
second half that's almost as good. And I
see no reason why he won't have one.
Easiest of all to pick is the AL Cy
Young Award winner. Bret Saberhagen
was 7-12 last year after winning the
award in 1985. This year Saberhagen
(14-3, 2.56 ERA) could win 30. If he does
so — which admittedly is unlikely —
he'll be the first man to do it since Denny
McLain won 31 in 1968.
In the NL the race is a little tighter
with six legitimate candidates: starters
Orel Hershiser, Rick Reuschel, Mike
Scott and Terry Leach, and relievers
Dave Smith and John Franco.
Smith sports the most amazing stat of

any of them: He has given up only 2.86
hits per nine innings of work — any fig
ure under six hits per game is normally
considered to be superb. Less than three
per game is unheard of. Smith is also
striking out nearly 12-and-one-half bat
ters per nine innings.
But Smith is a reliever who's not on
his way to saving 40 games and who has
yet to pick up a win. I give the nod to
Mike Scott, if for no other reason than
the fact that the "Cy Young jinx" has
had absolutely no effect on him.
Among the other candidates, though,
is a man whose story deserves telling —
Terry Leach of the New York Mets.
Leach is 8-0 this year with a 2.08 ERA
— impressive numbers to say the least.
But they're even more impressive if you
consider that Leach would be in the
minors right now if not for injuries to
Bob Ojeda and David Cone.
There's still more. Announcers un
familiar with Leach keep calling him
things like "youngster" and "kid."
Leach, however, is 33 years old — the
oldest pitcher on the Mets staff. He has
spent most of his career, which now
spans more than a decade, bouncing
around the minor leagues.
During one of Leach's major league
stints he pitched a 10-inning one-hitter.
But that wasn't enough to keep him in
the majors. Leach has been up and down
several times since, but has spent most
of this year with the World Champion
Mets. Last week he pitched a two-hitter
against the potent Cincinnati Reds.
Mets manager Davey Johnson is the
skipper of the NL All-Star team this
year. He didn't select Leach for the team
though its hard to figure out why.
Johnson named Sid Fernandez, another

Mets pitcher to the team. He's having a
good season but isn't nearly as deserving
as Leach.
The other great story of this season is
that of the Kansas City Royals' Jim
Eisenreich. Five years ago, Eisenreich
was a good looking young prospect for
the Minnesota Twins. He developed a
nervous disorder and during one game
he ran from the field to escape a group of
heckling fans.
Eisenreich finally had his problem
correctly diagnosed as Tourette
syndrome and is taking medication for
his condition. Initially the Royals had
reservations that the medication would
affect his hittng, but they gave him a
chance to play anyway.
He started the year with the Memphis
Chicks (the Royals AA affiliate that Bo
Jackson made famous last year) and
simply tore up the league. Eisenreich got
called up to the majors a few weeks ago
and just last week had a four-RBI game,
which included a mammoth three-run
homer.
The Eisenreich story is one of those
heart-warmers that this writer loves to
hear. The kid is still only 26 and appears
to have a great future. I know that just
about every baseball fan out there is
pulling for him.
The latest piece of evidence in the
lively ball controversy is one of the most
fascinating so far. The Los Angeles
Dodgers had so many of last year's balls
left over that they didn't use a single
new one until very recently. Dodger
Stadium has also seen the fewest runs
scored of any major league park this
year. Coincidence? I don't think so.

stints he pitched a 10-inning one-hitter.
But that wasn't enough to keep him in
the majors. Leach has been up and down
several times since, but has spent most
of this year with the World Champion
Mets. Last week he pitched a two-hitter
against the potent Cincinnati Reds.
Mets manager Davey Johnson is the
skipper of the NL All-Star team this
year. He didn't select Leach for the team
though its hard to figure out why.
Johnson named Sid Fernandez, another

Mets pitcher to the team. He's having a
good season but isn't nearly as deserving
as Leach.
The other great story of this season is
that of the Kansas City Royals' Jim
Eisenreich. Five years ago, Eisenreich
was a good looking young prospect for
the Minnesota Twins. He developed a
nervous disorder and during one game
he ran from the field to escape a group of
heckling fans.
Eisenreich finally had his problem
correctly diagnosed as Tourette
syndrome and is taking medication for
his condition. Initially the Royals had
reservations that the medication would
affect his hittng, but they gave him a
chance to play anyway.
He started the year with the Memphis
Chicks (the Royals AA affiliate that Bo
Jackson made famous last year) and
simply tore up the league. Eisenreich got
called up to the majors a few weeks ago
and just last week had a four-RBI game,
which included a mammoth three-run
homer.
The Eisenreich story is one of those
heart-warmers that this writer loves to
hear. The kid is still only 26 and appears
to have a great future. I know that just
about every baseball fan out there is
pulling for him.
The latest piece of evidence in the
lively ball controversy is one of the most
fascinating so far. The Los Angeles
Dodgers had so many of last year's balls
left over that they didn't use a single
new one until very recently. Dodger
Stadium has also seen the fewest runs
scored of any major league park this
year. Coincidence? I don't think so.

It's our national pastime's midseason
again, and that means it's time for the
All-Star break. Typically sportswriters
use this as an opportunity to look back
on the first half of the year and look
ahead to the second half. Being a fairly
typical sportswriter, I'll do the same.

The American League's parade of in
teresting rookies is once again far more
impressive than the National League's
contingent. Last year, the "junior cir
cuit" produced sluggers like Cory
Snyder, Jose Canseco, Wally Joyner,
Danny Tartabull, Pete Incaviglia and
Ruben Sierra. The best in the National
League was a "rear back and fire" relief
pitcher named Todd Worrell. Worrell
reminds me of Goose Gossage during a
slump — throws hard but often gets hit
harder.
This year the AL's encore presentation
includes Mark McGwire, Kevin Seitzer,
Ellis Burks, Bo Jackson, Devon White,
Matt Nokes and B.J. Surhoff. Again, the
NL's best is a pitcher — left-hander Joe
Magrane. Magrane has pitched well but
is better known for quotes like "I'll be
back in a fortnight" (after he was placed
on the 15-day disabled list).
The National League has developed
its share of players in the past two years.
A team including Andres Galarraga,
Eric Davis, Kal Daniels and Will Clark

would be quite formidable. But it simply
doesn't measure up to the overwhelming
number of young stars playing in the
AL.
What does it all mean? Probably not a
whole hell of a lot. The St. Louis Car
dinals have but one slugger — Jack
Clark — and are outscoring nearly
everyone in both leagues.
Speaking of Clark, he barely beats out
Andre Dawson for the first-half MVP
award. Clark is hitting .306 with 25
home runs and 82 runs batted in. While
he was hurt last year the Cardinals
scored the fewest runs in the NL. Daw
son has almost single-handedly turned
the Cubs around. His stats aren't quite
as good as Clark's (.297, 24 HRs, 74
RBI), but his impact has been nearly as
large.
In the AL the award goes to George
Bell, hands down. This alleged "bad boy
of the Blue Jays," who has had trouble
with the media in the past, is letting his
bat do the talking this year (.294, 28
HRs, 73 RBI). If the Blue Jays are to win
their division, George Bell will need a
second half that's almost as good. And I
see no reason why he won't have one.
Easiest of all to pick is the AL Cy
Young Award winner. Bret Saberhagen
was 7-12 last year after winning the
award in 1985. This year Saberhagen
(14-3, 2.56 ERA) could win 30. If he does
so — which admittedly is unlikely —
he'll be the first man to do it since Denny
McLain won 31 in 1968.
In the NL the race is a little tighter
with six legitimate candidates: starters
Orel Hershiser, Rick Reuschel, Mike
Scott and Terry Leach, and relievers
Dave Smith and John Franco.
Smith sports the most amazing stat of

any of them: He has given up only 2.86
hits per nine innings of work — any fig
ure under six hits per game is normally
considered to be superb. Less than three
per game is unheard of. Smith is also
striking out nearly 12-and-one-half bat
ters per nine innings.
But Smith is a reliever who's not on
his way to saving 40 games and who has
yet to pick up a win. I give the nod to
Mike Scott, if for no other reason than
the fact that the "Cy Young jinx" has
had absolutely no effect on him.
Among the other candidates, though,
is a man whose story deserves telling —
Terry Leach of the New York Mets.
Leach is 8-0 this year with a 2.08 ERA
— impressive numbers to say the least.
But they're even more impressive if you
consider that Leach would be in the
minors right now if not for injuries to
Bob Ojeda and David Cone.
There's still more. Announcers un
familiar with Leach keep calling him
things like "youngster" and "kid."
Leach, however, is 33 years old — the
oldest pitcher on the Mets staff. He has
spent most of his career, which now
spans more than a decade, bouncing
around the minor leagues.
During one of Leach's major league
stints he pitched a 10-inning one-hitter.
But that wasn't enough to keep him in
the majors. Leach has been up and down
several times since, but has spent most
