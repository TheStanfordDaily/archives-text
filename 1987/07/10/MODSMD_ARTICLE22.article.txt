HP donates $900,000
to Stanford Hospital
Hewlett Packard Corp. has
donated $900,000 worth of so
phisticated medical monitoring
equipment to the intensive care
unit of the Stanford Hospital's
modernization project.
Hospital President Sheldon
King termed the donation a
"magnificent gift."
"There is no better example of
how corporate philanthropy can
further medical science than
Hewlett Packard's history of
support for Stanford Hospital,"
King said.
The new equipment includes
24 bedside monitors, a central
station with five patient display
monitors and a patient informa
tion data management unit

linked to a remote location.
According to Dr. Myer Rosen
thal, director of the intensive
care unit, one of the most im
portant features of the equip
ment is its ability to provide
trend data on patients by log
ging the times when measure
ments are made.
Scientists identify new
cancer-causing gene
A new kind of cancer gene,
which could modify current
thinking about how cancer
arises, has been identified by a
team of Stanford scientists and
a group of researchers at the
Linus Pauling Institute of Sci
ence and Medicine in Palo Alto.
The discovery appears to be
the first demonstration that a
change in a structural building

block of cells can play a role in
causing cancer. This may help
scientists better understand the
steps involved in turning a nor
mal cell into a cancerous one
and may stimulate new ideas
about how to prevent, diagnose
or treat cancer.
The gene, which can trans
form certain laboratory-grown
human cells into cancer cells,
joins a growing list of cancer
causing genes known as
"ocogenes," according to Dr.
Larry Kedes, professor of
medicine.
AIDS vaccine unlikely
Developing an effective AIDS
vaccine will be difficult because
the deadly virus invades living
cells through a rapid process
that cannot be blocked by

drugs, a recent study by Stan
ford scientists suggests.
"If we can prevent the (AIDS)
virus from entering cells, we
can prevent infection," said Dr.
Edgar Engleman, associate pro
fessor of pathology and
medicine at Stanford Medical
School..
"However, given the mecha
nism that we have observed, it
/ 7
is going to be difficult to
prevent the virus' entry," he
said.
Engleman and his research
team presented their findings
last month at the Third Inter
national Conference on Ac
quired Immune Deficiency
Syndrome held in Washington,
DC.
Their conclusions contradict
other research that suggests
certain drugs can prevent the

virus from penetrating cells.
Engleman's group found that
the AIDS virus fuses to suscep
tible white blood cells and in
jects its core of genetic material
into them in a matter of
seconds.
Since the virus is safe from
antibody attack once it gets
inside these cells, an effective
vaccine would have to kill cells
infected with the virus,
Engleman said.
"But designing a vaccine to
kill infected cells is a much
more challenging proposition
than designing one just to make
an antibody," he added.
"The most promising ap
proach now appears to be find
ing a new way of getting to the
virus before it can bind to these
cells," Engleman said.
