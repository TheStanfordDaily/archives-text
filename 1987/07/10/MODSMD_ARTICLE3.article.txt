"During my interviews at Stanford,

ways to contribute to the intellectual
and social mission of the University."
Mahoney said one of the main re

Stanford's associated ministries.
"We looked for someone able to ar
ticulate a vision for the deanship and
for Memorial Church as a University
church and capable of implementing
that vision," she said.
The committee looked for someone

diverse religious community, who
