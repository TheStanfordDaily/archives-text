# North testimony implicates many, profs, say
## 
### SUSAN SLUSSER Editorial staff 
Lt. Col. Oliver North's tes
timony at the Iran-contra
hearings has raised serious
questions about the role played
by top administration officials
— including President Reagan,
Stanford scholars said yester
day.
"It's a mistake to focus too
carefully on North's culpability
in his testimony," History Prof.
Barton Bernstein said, "for
larger themes should command
our attention — namely, what
did Reagan know and when?
And you can ask the same ques
tions about (Defense Secretary)
Caspar Weinberger and
(Secretary of State) George
Schultz."
In addition to Schultz, North
has mentioned Attorney Gen
eral Edwin Meese, Assistant
Secretary of State Elliott
Abrams, former CIA Director
William Casey and former Na
tional Security Advisers Robert
McFarlane and Adm. John

Poindexter as officials who
knew about the covert arms
sales to Iran and diversion of
profits to the contras.
"North has set it up for Poin
dexter and deflected responsi
bility to Poindexter," said Polit
ical Science and Sociology Prof.
Seymour Lipset, a senior fellow
at the Hoover Institution.
"He's tried to get Reagan off
the hook, but not Schultz,
Abrams or Meese," Lipset said.
According to Political Science
Prof. John Manley, however,
North's testimony yesterday
may have hurt Reagan more
than it helped.
"North recouped some of his
losses (from Wednesday)," Man
ley said. "And he did this by
pointing upwards at Poindex
ter, McFarlane, Casey — and,
at a crucial level, at President
Reagan/'
Yesterday's session in partic
ular revealed North's percep
tions about the President's role,
Manley said. Senate Counsel
