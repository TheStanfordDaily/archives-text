# North testimony implicates many, profs, say
## 
### SUSAN SLUSSER Editorial staff 
Lt. Col. Oliver North's tes
timony at the Iran-contra
hearings has raised serious
questions about the role played
by top administration officials
— including President Reagan,
Stanford scholars said yester
day.
"It's a mistake to focus too
carefully on North's culpability
in his testimony," History Prof.
Barton Bernstein said, "for
larger themes should command
our attention — namely, what
did Reagan know and when?
And you can ask the same ques
tions about (Defense Secretary)
Caspar Weinberger and
(Secretary of State) George
Schultz."
In addition to Schultz, North
has mentioned Attorney Gen
eral Edwin Meese, Assistant
Secretary of State Elliott
Abrams, former CIA Director
William Casey and former Na
tional Security Advisers Robert
McFarlane and Adm. John

Poindexter as officials who
knew about the covert arms
sales to Iran and diversion of
profits to the contras.
"North has set it up for Poin
dexter and deflected responsi
bility to Poindexter," said Polit
ical Science and Sociology Prof.
Seymour Lipset, a senior fellow
at the Hoover Institution.
"He's tried to get Reagan off
the hook, but not Schultz,
Abrams or Meese," Lipset said.
According to Political Science
Prof. John Manley, however,
North's testimony yesterday
may have hurt Reagan more
than it helped.
"North recouped some of his
losses (from Wednesday)," Man
ley said. "And he did this by
pointing upwards at Poindex
ter, McFarlane, Casey — and,
at a crucial level, at President
Reagan/'
Yesterday's session in partic
ular revealed North's percep
tions about the President's role,

Lt. Col. Oliver North's testimony in the Iran-contra hearings is attracting the attention of more than
just political science scholars. English Prof. David Riggs (far right) joins a crowd watching the
proceedings on this TV at a fruit stand in White Plaza.
Arthur Liman got North to
describe his mission in Central
America in terms of Reagan's
stated policy — supporting the
contras "body and soul" in their
resistance effort. When asked
who passed Reagan's senti
ments on to him, North
responded, "Robert C.
McFarlane."
Manley said North's admis
sion may implicate the presi
dent. "The way North put it,
The president's policy was X,
the national security adviser
told me this, and then told me to
impart it,' " Manley said. "That
links Reagan with McFarlane,
North and Casey as control on
up.
"Liman came back later and
drove home the point, asking,
'Where was the political respon
sibility?' The answer was the
president. The operational re
sponsibility was McFarlane's
and, directly, North's," Manley
continued.
"If you look at it that way,
what North has done is very
damaging. It's one step away
from the Oval Office on North's
testimony," he said.
The question of the presi
dent's involvement hinges on
five memorandums that North
sent, through Poindexter, for
Reagan's approval to divert
funds from Iranian arms sales
to the contras. Only one memo
has been found, and the fate of
the others are unknown.
Reagan has denied ever seeing
the memos or approving the di
version of funds.
'The issue is not broad
policy," Lipset said."Reagan's
always wanted to keep the con
tras going. The question is the

violation of laws. If he signed
the memos, he did (violate the
law).
"North sent five memos over
a period of time. If Poindexter
decided he didn't want to send
them, he would have told North
to stop. If North was not told to
stop, then where did they go?"
According to Lipset, there is a
theory that Poindexter may
have sent the memos to then-
White House Chief of Staff
Donald Regan. "If Poindexter
had memos to take to Reagan to
approve, did he sit on them, or
did he take them to Reagan or
Regan?" Lipsett asked. "It all
started with North, then he
went to Pointdexer, who may
have gone to Regan or Reagan.
"North is clearly concerned
with getting out of the legal
thing, and putting the blame on
everybody but the President,"
Lipsett noted. "If Poindexter
says it was his decision, then
[Poindexter] is in trouble. If
Regan says it was his decision,
then [Regan] is in trouble."
"North has implicated the
entire administration," Manley
said. "Or at least a large faction
of it. The net now is very
broad."
Propriety is also an issue in
the hearing, particularly with
regard to Reagan, Manley sug
gested.
"The President takes an oath
to defend the Constitution and
take care that the law is care
fully executed," he said. "How
can that oath be upheld and
honored if the president sets in
motion actions which clearly
break the law, clearly are not in
compliance with the law and
clearly are intended to change
the law as soon as possible?"
In most cases, covert activi
ties cannot be carried out
openly for national security
reasons. In this case, however,

Manley said the mission was
covert "because it couldn't be
done legally.
"Beyond a shadow of a doubt,
the Reagan Administration is a
lawless one," he added. "The
law was something to get
around, circumvent."
Opinions on North's perform
ance were divided.
Bernstein called him
"wonderfully skilled, and won
derfully coached, at appearing
as the earnest boy scout defend
ing national security and
'freedom fighters.'"
The harshest criticism came
from Hoover senior research fel
low John Bunzel. "The nation is
watching a national hero, a
Marine sworn to uphold the
Constitution, justify subverting
it and lying to Congress and to
others in the executive branch,"
Bunzell said. "In a word, violat
ing the democratic process in
the name of his own special
gods, which he alone places
above everything else."
Both Manley and Lipset
thought North was believable.
"He's very credible," Manley
said. "If anyone had doubts
after Mr. (Charles) Cooper's tes
timony, North very effectively
displaced them." Cooper called
North a liar in an earlier ses
sion.
"It's dynamite testimony.
Very revealing," he added.
Lipset said North is "clearly a
very effective presenter, or
talker, and the public seems to
think he's telling the truth.
"It's an interesting ballgame
still," he said.
"He could make a mint on the
lecture tour, and as a fundraiser
for conservative causes," Lipset
said. "It's ironic; he could raise
more money for the contras
then he ever could before."
