North testifies on * shredding party'
WASHINGTON — Even as Department of Justice inves
tigators were combing his records only a few feet away last
November', Lt. Col. Oliver North continued methodically
shredding the documents that could have provided the
blueprint of his secret projects at the White House, North told
congressional investigators Thursday.
"They were working on their projects," North said dryly. "I
was working on mine."
North's testimony added to the criticism of the depart
ment's preliminary investigation of the Reagan administra
tion's sale of arms to Iran and military support for
Nicaragua's Contra rebels at a time when U.S. government
assistance was banned. Department spokesman Terry
Eastland denied North's account.
In his third day of testimony to congressional investigating
committees, North said that the infamous "shredding party"
that began in his office on Nov. 21 lasted far longer than pre
viously thought — right up until the morning he was fired
Nov. 25.
Meese accused in Wedtech scandal
WASHINGTON — Attorney General Edwin Meese 111 gave
the appearance of a conflict of interest by failing to remove
himself sooner from a Department of Justice investigation of
Wedtech Corp. after investing $54,500 with an investment
adviser linked to the scandal-plagued company, the chairman
of a Senate investigating panel charged Thursday.
Sen. Carl Levin, D-Mich., chairman of the Senate
Governmental Affairs oversight subcommittee, contrasted
Meese's actions with a pledge made by the attorney general
during his 1985 Senate confirmation hearings to "go over
board to avoid any appearance that might be construed, mis
construed, or misinterpreted or even distorted."
Meese, testifying on financial disclosures he made about
the controversial investment, rejected the conflict-of-interest
charge, saying his actions "would not create an appearance
problem to any fair-minded person."
The attorney general removed himself from the Wedtech
investigation in April after learning that W. Franklyn
Chinn, his investment adviser, was a possible subject of a
federal criminal investigation of Wedtech. He subsequently
withdrew his investment with Chinn, which was made in
1985.
White S. Africans meets with ANC
DAKAR, Senegal — Fifty prominent white South Africans,
defying their government, opened three days of talks with the
outlawed African National Congress here Thursday on a
strategy to end apartheid and establish a democratic political
system for their country.
Frederik von Zyl Slabbert, leader of the white delegation of
politicians, businessmen, clergy, academics, writers and stu
dents, said that the meeting would discuss "alternatives to
the brutal catastrophe unfolding inside our common father
land."
Thabo Mbeki, the ANC's information director, declared
that "the system of white minority rule can only be ended
through struggle," but he added that the increasing willing
ness of whites to oppose apartheid "greatly augments the
struggle for change."
"The more whites who join us, the faster the struggle ad
vances, and the sooner we will all be liberated," Mbeki told
the congress.
Although the meeting itself is a breakthrough in efforts to
open a political dialogue across South Africa's racial divide,
participants said that its results can only be measured over
time in terms of changed attitudes.
U.S. says Marcos may be detained .
WASHINGTON — Indignant lawmakers, reacting to
whispered tape-recorded plotting by deposed Philippine Pres
ident Ferdinand Marcos, Thursday demanded stronger U.S.
measures to restrain him, and a senior State Department offi
cial said Marcos might be placed under detention if he contin
ues plotting from U.S. soil.
State Department Legal Adviser Abraham Sofaer, who
warned Marcos Monday in Honolulu to stop seeking to dis
rupt the government of President Corazon Aquino and placed
him under severe travel restrictions, said the United States
would "escalate further" its attention to Marcos if he contin
ues plotting.
Under intense questioning, Sofaer said he is "not confi
dent" that Marcos will stop plotting, but that he could wind
up in an Immigration and Naturalization Service detention
center.
Sofaer's statements came near the conclusion of a mara
thon session of the House Foreign Affairs subcommittee on
Asia and the Pacific, which heard tape recordings of Marcos'
plans to mount a military operation to regain power by over
throwing Aquino and taking her hostage.
