## Computer assigns freshman housing by track 
### ERIN MARTIN Staff writer 
The University has acquired a new
computer program to assign incoming
freshmen to campus residences based on
their Western Culture track preferences.
The new system assigns rooms using
information received from housing sur
veys. The surveys ask incoming fresh
men to select a Western Culture track
and indicate a preference to live in a
four-class or all-freshmen dormitory, a
theme house or a house with coed or
single-sex halls.
The computer uses students' Western
Culture rankings to assign tracks, then
tries to place students in residences that
most closely match their housing
preferences from among those with
dorm-based Western Culture sections for
their tracks.
The placement process is overseen by
the Freshman Information Project in
cooperation with the Office of Residen
tial Education, the Housing Center and
the Office of Humanities and Sciences.
According to assignment coordinator
Phil Cline, a student in his fourth year
with the project, "it takes a bit of balanc
ing, and when it comes down to it, West
ern Culture takes precedence over
housing preference."
Cline said 700 requests for all
freshmen housing had to be distributed
among 400 places this year.
This year's housing poll of the soon-to
be freshmen has changed the phrasing of
the theme house question.
In the past, students have been able to

indicate a positive, negative or indif
ferent attitude toward living in a theme
house. On this year's survey, students
could not choose not to live in a theme
dormitory.
Rodger Whitney, director of the pro
ject and assistant dean of Residential
Education, said that this "slight change"
is designed to isolate students who have
a genuine interest in living in a theme
house.
"First we want to find the students
who want to be there, and then fill up
the rest of the house with a random as
sortment of freshmen," he said.
"The goal in assigning freshmen is to
place a composite of the class in each
house, so that each house has the chance
to learn from its members the way stu
dents would learn from people they meet
in class or other ways," said Whitney.
Though the computer places each new
freshman in University housing and a
Western Culture track, it finishes less
than half of the project's immense task.
The project is also responsible for match
ing roommates and coordinating all in
formational mailings to freshmen.
Roommate matching is done by Cline
and assignment coordinator Anne Hick
ling.
According to Cline, matching
roommates is not quite what it used be.
"We are not given the same freedom we
used to have. There is more oversight
now," he said.
Cline cited the 1983 assignment of
four freshman named John to a Roble
quad as an example of a "fun" match
that will not take place anymore.

"Administrators want freshmen to
know that we take our job seriously," he
said.
A freshman information card gives in
dividual students a chance to talk about
their academic and extracurricular in
terests and musical tastes. Roommates
are matched based on this information.
According to Cline there are basic
guidelines to be followed. "We try to
match a California resident with an out
of-state resident, different academic in
terests — for example, no pre-meds to
gether.
"We also look for similar musical
tastes and athletic interests," he said.
Last year's experimental coordination

of freshmen placement with their West
ern Culture track and writing seminar
will continue "with no expansion or
change," said Whitney.
According to Hickling, this procedure
seeks to place "clusters of people from
the same class in the same house."
In addition, the project responds to
phone calls from freshmen with ques
tions about their upcoming college
careers.
"Somedays, the phone never stops
ringing," Hickling said.
Hickling and Cline will have fewer
questions to answer after July 24, the
scheduled mailing date of letters an
nouncing the freshman assignments.
