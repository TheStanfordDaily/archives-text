The Office of Residential Education's decision last week to
return Synergy to co-op status is commendable. Especially
exciting about the decision was the process through which it
came about. Both students and adminstrators attempted to
understand and address each other's concerns.
Synergy failed to fill nearly half of its spaces this spring
and had demonstrated difficulty in filling consistantly
during past years. It was not surprising that Res Ed changed
Synergy to a self-op in May when less than 90 percent of the
house's spaces filled. If a house is unpopular, Res Ed is justi
fied in questioning its existence.
But popularity should not be the only measure of a
residence's success. Because Synergy has encouraged alter
native living and served an educational function as a
cooperative community, it has been a valuable asset to
campus life.
Synergy residents joined together to prepare a well
considered proposal that sought to retain Synergy's identity
and educational value while recognizing Res Ed concerns
about filling spaces in the house.
Cooperating with Res Ed, those residents worked out a
good solution.
Physical improvements to the house will attract more stu
dents. A SWOPSI course will be taught at Synergy to expose
others to the house's ideals.
The revival of a co-op council and the appointment of a fac
ulty adviser will provide structures for dealing with past and
future difficulties. In addition, the co-ops and Res Ed will
work together to promote cooperative living.
The University will clean the house and residents will
have the option of paying for other students to cook their
meals rather than having to cook themselves. The name
"Synergy" will stay and graduate students will continue to be
eligible for assignment.
The residents did not allow Synergy the co-op to disappear
and did not simply sling insults at Res Ed. Rather, they
developed a thoughtful response and therefore deserve com
mendation. Res Ed should also be recognized for seeing the
important role of Synergy and giving its residents considera
tion. Res Ed showed that their office will take student con
cerns seriously.
The result was a compromise reached fairly. It is refresh
ing to see a University office responding to constructive stu
dent proposals and involving students in the decision
making process.
