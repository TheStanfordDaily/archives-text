# A 						visit to the Department Store of the West
## 
### 
I spent the first two quarters of the past
school year at our overseas campus at Ox
ford. One of the aspects of studying at Ox
ford which I most appreciated was the op
portunity to travel around Europe, a first
for me. Like any competent tourist, I felt
obliged to visit those places which
punctuate the speech of the well-traveled
and serve as geographic focal points for the

rest of us

A friend who discovered that I was soon
to visit Berlin informed me of the "must
sees" to be found there. One of his sugges
tions surprised me: "You must see
KaDeWe,' he insisted. I had to admit that I
was unfamiliar with a castle, cathedral or
war memorial of that name, so I asked him
to explain. KaDeWe (pronounced kah-day-
VAY), as it turns out, is an acronym or ab
breviation (no one I talked to seemed to be
sure which) for "Department Store of the
West."
KaDeWe is West Berlin's retail
showplace and, though noteworthy for
other reasons, is famed for its fifth-floor
food section. Meats of every description,
enormous tanks teeming with fish, whole
sections given over to cheese and pastry
and sausage — I can only hint at the
volume and variety of consumables
available at this German superstore. It is a
remarkable sight, though, and one which I
would recommend to a visitor to West Ber
lin without hesitation.
KaDeWe is not alone among European
department stores in attracting the atten
tion of foreign visitors. Great department
stores are often as powerful a draw as the

ruins and remnants of ages past. Shopping
has taken its place as a standard feature on
the itinerary of most Americans who vaca
tion abroad. It is hard to imagine, for in
stance, that anyone would blink an eye to
hear a friend's account of a stay in London
include Harrod's in the same breath as
Westminster Abbey, Buckingham Palace
and St. Paul's Cathedral.
I don't find it objectionable to place a de
partment store in the same category as a
traditional landmark. In fact, I find them
rather compatible. Beyond the common fac
tor of being tourist attractions, the great
department store and a monument like a
cathedral share another and more impor
tant quality: Each can be usefully under
stood as a paragon of the age and culture
which produced it.
As the central feature of both medieval
town-planning and spirituality, the cathe
dral is an incontestable example of such a
geist incarnate. The department store,
despite the profound differences between,
say, the Palo Alto Neiman-Marcus and
Notre Dame, is no less an embodiment of
the postwar West. Just as the breathtaking
expanse of a cathedral's interior makes us
pause to consider the nature of life in the
Middle Ages, so too should a department
store cause us to reflect on some of the
varied themes of our commercial age:
Revulsion: For heaven's sake, just look at
all those things! Is there not a point at
which infinite variety blurs into narcosis,
when the respectable veneer surrounding
material competition can remain intact no
longer? Evil has a name: Swatch. It has
scourged its nasty little imprint into the
flesh of our young and threatens the same
to the less circumspect of the old. Tell me
that a polychromatic conspiracy is not
afoot, that Benetton and Esprit do not
really know that every color is not compati
ble with every other. Count the victims of
Ralph Lauren, but blame him not; he is but
a pawn, a name, an insignia in the battle

for our hearts and minds. Where will it
end?
Appreciation: There is much to commend
the material bounty that can be found in
one of our department stores. It is nothing
short of miraculous that so many people
have the opportunity to partake of such
wondrous things. We have to remind our
selves that liberal democracy is not simply
a political principle. It finds expression,
among other places, in the presence in the
average home of material pleasures and
comforts which previous ages would have
reserved for the privileged. The universal
access provided by the department store
has played no small part in the realization
of this shared prosperity. In a distributive
sense, it is difficult to name something
which better captures the exuberance and
inventiveness of the human imagination
than the contemporary department store.
Reflection: My travels in Europe also
took me to East Berlin, where the depart
ment store as we know it does not exist,
either to offend or to amaze. The bleaker
half of that divided city espouses ideals dif
ferent from our own and puts them forward
with apparent conviction. The American
used to a steady diet of Cold War rhetoric
will be disappointed by how unsensational
a place East Berlin is. What is most evi
dently absent is not freedom, but advertis
ing. It is a stark landscape: few billboards,
neon signs or flashing lights. It almost
makes you want to go out and buy a
Swatch.
Some might say that comparing a depart
ment store to Canterbury Cathedral, the
guild halls of Flanders or Louis XlV's Ver
saille is a travesty. It doesn't seem to many
that we leave monuments of any note. Each
age leaves its mark, though, and in trying
to understand the subtleties of history we
cannot allow a comparative distaste for the
distinctive artifacts of our own time to blind
us to their genuine significance.

I spent the first two quarters of the past
school year at our overseas campus at Ox
ford. One of the aspects of studying at Ox
ford which I most appreciated was the op
portunity to travel around Europe, a first
for me. Like any competent tourist, I felt
obliged to visit those places which
punctuate the speech of the well-traveled
and serve as geographic focal points for the

rest of us

A friend who discovered that I was soon
to visit Berlin informed me of the "must
sees" to be found there. One of his sugges
tions surprised me: "You must see
KaDeWe,' he insisted. I had to admit that I
was unfamiliar with a castle, cathedral or
war memorial of that name, so I asked him
to explain. KaDeWe (pronounced kah-day-
VAY), as it turns out, is an acronym or ab
breviation (no one I talked to seemed to be
sure which) for "Department Store of the
West."
KaDeWe is West Berlin's retail
showplace and, though noteworthy for
other reasons, is famed for its fifth-floor
food section. Meats of every description,
enormous tanks teeming with fish, whole
sections given over to cheese and pastry
and sausage — I can only hint at the
volume and variety of consumables
available at this German superstore. It is a
remarkable sight, though, and one which I
would recommend to a visitor to West Ber
lin without hesitation.
KaDeWe is not alone among European
department stores in attracting the atten
tion of foreign visitors. Great department
stores are often as powerful a draw as the

ruins and remnants of ages past. Shopping
has taken its place as a standard feature on
the itinerary of most Americans who vaca
tion abroad. It is hard to imagine, for in
stance, that anyone would blink an eye to
hear a friend's account of a stay in London
include Harrod's in the same breath as
Westminster Abbey, Buckingham Palace
and St. Paul's Cathedral.
I don't find it objectionable to place a de
partment store in the same category as a
traditional landmark. In fact, I find them
rather compatible. Beyond the common fac
tor of being tourist attractions, the great
department store and a monument like a
cathedral share another and more impor
tant quality: Each can be usefully under
stood as a paragon of the age and culture
which produced it.
As the central feature of both medieval
town-planning and spirituality, the cathe
dral is an incontestable example of such a
geist incarnate. The department store,
despite the profound differences between,
say, the Palo Alto Neiman-Marcus and
Notre Dame, is no less an embodiment of
the postwar West. Just as the breathtaking
expanse of a cathedral's interior makes us
pause to consider the nature of life in the
Middle Ages, so too should a department
store cause us to reflect on some of the
varied themes of our commercial age:
Revulsion: For heaven's sake, just look at
all those things! Is there not a point at
which infinite variety blurs into narcosis,
when the respectable veneer surrounding
material competition can remain intact no
longer? Evil has a name: Swatch. It has
scourged its nasty little imprint into the
flesh of our young and threatens the same
to the less circumspect of the old. Tell me
that a polychromatic conspiracy is not
afoot, that Benetton and Esprit do not
really know that every color is not compati
ble with every other. Count the victims of
Ralph Lauren, but blame him not; he is but
a pawn, a name, an insignia in the battle

for our hearts and minds. Where will it
end?
Appreciation: There is much to commend
the material bounty that can be found in
one of our department stores. It is nothing
short of miraculous that so many people
have the opportunity to partake of such
wondrous things. We have to remind our
selves that liberal democracy is not simply
a political principle. It finds expression,
among other places, in the presence in the
average home of material pleasures and
comforts which previous ages would have
reserved for the privileged. The universal
access provided by the department store
has played no small part in the realization
of this shared prosperity. In a distributive
sense, it is difficult to name something
which better captures the exuberance and
inventiveness of the human imagination
than the contemporary department store.
Reflection: My travels in Europe also
took me to East Berlin, where the depart
ment store as we know it does not exist,
either to offend or to amaze. The bleaker
half of that divided city espouses ideals dif
ferent from our own and puts them forward
with apparent conviction. The American
used to a steady diet of Cold War rhetoric
will be disappointed by how unsensational
a place East Berlin is. What is most evi
dently absent is not freedom, but advertis
ing. It is a stark landscape: few billboards,
neon signs or flashing lights. It almost
makes you want to go out and buy a
Swatch.
Some might say that comparing a depart
ment store to Canterbury Cathedral, the
guild halls of Flanders or Louis XlV's Ver
saille is a travesty. It doesn't seem to many
that we leave monuments of any note. Each
age leaves its mark, though, and in trying
to understand the subtleties of history we
cannot allow a comparative distaste for the
distinctive artifacts of our own time to blind
us to their genuine significance.
