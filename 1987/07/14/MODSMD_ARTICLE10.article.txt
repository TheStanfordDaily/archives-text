# California water and the North-South dilemma
## 
### 
Assemblyman Jim Costa of Fresno
abandoned his water reallocation bill last
week, saying, "The rhetoric level had sim
ply gotten out of hand." That's interesting.
What does Costa expect when half the state
feels like it's getting bilked by the other
half? Should Northern California sit
quietly and let the Southern majority in the
legislature dictate that Northern rivers and
estuaries be drained for the benefit of an
ever-thirstier South?

In all truth, there are two Californias.
Northern and Southern California are
about as different spiritually, geograph
ically and economically as two regions in
the same state could possibly be. San Fran
cisco and Los Angeles, emissaries of the two
cultures, have a long history of less-than
friendly rivalry. Recent claims that L.A.
has overtaken the City to become the cul
tural capital of the West can only ex
acerbate the tension. (Such claims are ab
surd, but having lived in Northern Califor
nia for the past 12 years, I admit my bias.)
The North-South split crystallizes most
readily when the water issue is broached.

The Peripheral Canal measure, another
water-grabbing scheme that was defeated
soundly by voters in 1982, still rankles both
sides. Moreover, the dry weather this win
ter did nothing to quell suspicions that
Southern California is simply far too depen
dent on some very tenuous lifelines in the
event of a repeat next winter. Another year
of abnormally low rainfall would mean
drought on a scale not seen since the 1975-
76 dry spell, which caused panic and water
rationing throughout the state.
The Senate counterpart to Costa's bill,
authored by State Senator Ruben Ayala, is
still pending. If passed it would enlarge the
State Water Project and more water would
be carried south from the already ecologi
cally fragile Sacramento-San Joaquin
Delta.
The reason? Ostensibly, to protect the in
terests of the South in case of drought and
to its lower dependence on the Colorado
River, which has many claimants besides
California.
I don't buy it. Don't get me wrong — my
tilt toward the North doesn't prevent me
from having compassion for the South. We
in the North have more water than they do
— always have, always will. That's part of
what makes this such a nice place to live.
Southern California by contrast is a vast
desert hell-hole, a settlement that by any
scale of geographical and population plan
ning has no right to exist. Admittedly,
though, the settlement and the culture of
So Cal long ago acquired an enormously ac

celerating momentum. For whatever rea
son, Southern California exists, and it
needs water.
Were anyone in the South in imminent
danger of dying of thirst, I would give the
water freely, all environmental claims from
the Delta and the San Francisco Bay not
withstanding. That is the emotional crux of
the matter: Water equals life.
In Southern California, however, water
equals money. Interesting to note that
Costa comes from Fresno and Ayala from
Chino, two areas heavily dependent on
agribusiness. The state inexplicably sub
sidizes water for irrigation on large tracts
of farmland. There is no open market for
water and thus no incentive to conserve.
Water is wasted because it's dirt cheap —
for agribusiness, not for city users.
Richard Katz, assemblyman from
Panorama City and one of the few Southern
legislators with the guts to take a stand
against the bills, summed it up nicely: "The
effect of this bill is to take $25 from each
household in L.A. and San Diego and ship it
to Kern County (farming interests)."
Salination of the Delta, destruction of fis
heries and stagnation of the Bay are prices
too steep to justify diverting water that the
South doesn't even need. Costa and Ayala
should not be allowed to pervert the role of
water from life-giver to underhanded
profit-maker. The stuff is too precious.
