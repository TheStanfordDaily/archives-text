# Racism at Stanford: It's still here
## 
### 
Universities reflect the morals and beliefs of a
society. Racism is a national problem that uni
versities' atmospheres mirror. These things hap
pen because there is a climate which will allow
them to happen — a climate of racial intolerence.
Stanford best reflects a statement made by
Richard Arrington, the black mayor of Birming
ham, Ala., in Time magazine. He said, "Certainly
things have improved over 20 years ago, but in
the past seven or eight years racial progress has
been at a standstill, and I'm inclined to say in a
slight retreat."

The Rainbow Agenda realized that little had
changed for them over the past 20 years. The
May forum on racism in Kresge Auditorium tried
to explain this view. The forum was a chance to
give the history of the Agenda and to give per
sonal insights of racist experiences on campus.
By now many of you are thinking that you've
read this story before. You know that the Agenda
was formed, that they made demands on the Uni
versity, that they demonstrated at the Centen
nial celebration and that they held a forum on
racism. And many of you are about ready to walk
away from the problem once again. After all, it's
not your problem.
It really takes an effort to even begin to under
stand racism in a society where you are continu
ally exposed to it. But it is not impossible. Racism
is about alienation. It's about people in a position
of power who can isolate and exclude.
Think for a moment about your past. There
was a moment when you felt it — alienation. I
know I did. Growing up, kids teased me about my

eyes — they move. I told them I couldn't control
it. That I was born with this condition. But that
didn't interest them. I was different and they
made sure I knew it.
I was lucky the abuse ended at high school. But
I can still remember how it felt. Can't you? It
hurts — a lot. It is when we remember*\vhat it
felt like to be alienated, even for a brief time,
that we can begin to appreciate the everyday har
assment that accompanies racism. For it is
everyday events that lead to screams. The
everyday events.
Imagine driving around campus in a beat-up
big car, being stopped by the police and ques
tioned about whether you belong on campus or
not. Imagine coming home late one night after
working on a problem set and being stopped in
White Plaza by the glare of a policeman's flash
light in your face (after all, you're carrying an
umbrella). Imagine being suspected of stealing a
bike because you were seen in White Plaza that
day.
This is a reality that minorities at Stanford
face. It is a reality that all of us — white, black,
Chicano, Indian and Asian — must start to
change. The first step to dealing with racism is
admitting that it exists and that it is not just a
minority issue. The next step is taking an active
part in stopping its spread. But not knowing
what to do can be as frustrating as the issue it
self.
Partially in response to campus-wide frustra
tion and feeling of helplessness, the Public Ser
vice Center's "You Can Make A Difference Con
ference" this fall will focus on institutionalized
racism. The organizers of the conference hope not
only to educate but to empower people with the
positive belief that together we can do something
to alleviate the situation. We must stress more
than ever that you can make a difference.
