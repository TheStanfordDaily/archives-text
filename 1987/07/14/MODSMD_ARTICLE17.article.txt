## GSB graduates apply their skills to fight local hunger 
### DAVID GIBSON 
Not all business is profit. Three former
Graduate School of Business students
recently developed a non-profit plan —
Food-Net — to divert surplus food from
local restaurants and grocers to the
needy of San Mateo and Santa Clara
counties.
Over $250 million worth of food is
thrown out every year in these counties,
food that could benefit the hungry. June
graduates Janet Abrams, Laurie Girand
and Lenny Mendonca hope their plan
will feed between 16-25,000 needy
people in the area.

Abrams first became interested in the
plight of the hungry during a summer in
New York where she observed the
"tragedy of human poverty." Back at
Stanford, in a public sector management
course at the Business School, she,
Girand and Mendonca studied the issue
of hunger in the United States. After
studying the nation's welfare programs
and food banks, they found a way to pro
vide more help for the needy and pro
posed Food-Net.
Food-Net is designed to take advan
tage of the "market niche" of under
utilized food donors. Abrams said they
discovered that food banks, where

donors can deposit food for the needy, do
not have the time and resources to find
every neighborhood orange grower with
extra oranges or to accommodate surplus
perishable lasagna from local restau
rants.
Typically, food from these potential
donors goes unused. Currently, the
Santa Clara Food Bank, which handles a
million pounds of food a month, receives
75 percent of its stock from the U.S. De
partment of Agriculture.
But all three believe food banks do a
great job. The problem, according to
Girand, is a "big black hole in the con
sciousness level" of the community. One
fifth the nation's food supply is either
lost or wasted, much as a result of an in
formation gap, she said.
Grocers rarely contact food organiza
tions, homeowners are often unaware
that anyone is interested in what they
have to donate, and some restaurant
owners fear liability for their donated
food, unaware of the good Samaritan
laws that protect them, according to
Girand.
The Food-Net plan brings organiza
tions like soup kitchens together with
donors of perishable and small amounts
of food through an extensive information
network. The network includes a dis
patching service that furnishes phone
numbers to donors and organizations so
they can develop food pick-up and
delivery schedules.
Abrams also envisions a "hunger
hotline" to assist the needy. Now, a
needy person might make as many as
four phone calls to locate a single free
meal.
Food-Net will go beyond phone service
to raise community awareness about the
problem of hunger. Plans include profes
sionals appearing on local talk shows, in
churches and with the general public.
Abrams hopes Food-Net can serve as
an example of the "energy and
humanism" MBAs can offer society. "All
MBAs have a potential to help the public
sector," Girand said. The three
graduates believe they can make a
unique contribution to the public sector
with Food-Net since they possess skills
to address what they call a "marketing
problem."
Food-Net will depend on volunteers as
well as grants from corporations and
foundations for support, Girand said.
