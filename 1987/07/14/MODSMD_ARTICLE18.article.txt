## Farm reacts to Ollie 
### JOHN LEE 
Throughout the last week one par
ticular person has stood out as the
center of controversy and conversa
tion in the eye of the American public.
That person is, of course, Lt. Col.
Oliver North. Once again, we sent
Stanford's own Mr. Curious Guy out
to the streets in search of the public s
opinion on North and his recent tes
timony.
Has Oliver North earned your
respect?
Richard Brody, professor, political
science
"I think he's done a good job as a
witness, but if by earning my respect
you mean thinking what he was doing
was right, the answer is no."
Tom Mcßride, associate dean, Law
School
"I think he sounds like a jerk."
Charles Hauck, junior, history
"Oliver North, although a true pa
triot and acting with good intentions,
has betrayed the law and deserves to
be punished for it under the criminal
system of this great country."
Brian Rhoads, recent graduate
"My respect hasn't really increased
or lessened. But anyone who can tes
tify for five days before Congress and
still can hold himself so well
definitely commands some amount of
respect. As far as fulfilling his role as
a military officer, he did his job.
However, if he broke the law he
should be prosecuted along with his
superiors who gave the orders."
Scott Allen, assistant director, Under
graduate Admissions
"No, but I'm hardly giving him a
chance. I've made up my mind about
him long ago, and no man, just be
cause he dresses up in a nice military
outfit, is going to take my initial
prejudices against him away."
Brent Williams, junior, electrical
engineering
"No, I can't respect a man who
blindly supports and defends a foreign
policy antithetical to America's inter

ests, and a secret government whose
operation runs counter to all sense of
constitutional law and propriety.
However, he is one hell of a guy and
you just gotta respect someone with a
secretary like Fawn Hall."

"Anyone who can
come off looking
that good has got
to be a media
godr

Chris Kottra, senior, biology and
philosophy
"Hell , yes. He looks great in front of
the camera. Considering what he did,
anyone who can come off looking that
good has got to be some kind of a
media god. He looks really sincere. He
can make you feel really sympathetic
for the fact that he sold out America to
the Iranians and totally subverted the
will of Congress."
Julie Switzer, senior, English and
biology
"No. I haven't been watching any of
the hearings lately, but I know that
when Robert McFarlane was speak
ing, one of the things that he said was
that on North's daughter's birthday
North never went home. His daughter
called him at the office three times
and he still never went home that
night! McFarlane respected that, but I
really think that that's displaced
obsession. I think it's really unfortun
ate."
Mr. Curious Guy, seventh-year senior,
medieval studies and tae kwon do
"I have nothing but respect for a
grown man who wants people to call
him Ollie. What I'd really like to see is
North's attorney, Brendan Sullivan,
and Senate Committee Chairman
Daniel Inouye, get into a bout of fis
ticuffs. It's been far too long since
we've seen chaos and complete pan
demonium break out in a congres
sional committee hearing."
