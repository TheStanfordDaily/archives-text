## Hoover Tower suicides only folklore Stanford sorority history retold—correctly 
### ELLEN MOORE 
Once upon a time, in the spring of 1944, there was a
board of trustees that did not like sororities, so it
abolished them. Thirty-three years later, in 1977,
sororities resurfaced at Stanford. Since that time
thousands or more have pondered the rumors sur
rounding these events. "What is the true story?" they
ask. The time has come for the story to be told.
First of all, there were no Hoover Tower suicides. Al
though tour guides would have it otherwise, this is just
one of those myths students tell to convince people that
Stanford is actually an interesting place and that dra
matic things happen here.
Actually, sororities were banned after 13 students
from Roble Hall sent the Board of Trustees a letter in
1943 stating their dissatisfaction with the growing
problems of the sorority system at Stanford.
The problems named stemmed mostly from the in
creased number of women admitted to the University
when many male students went off fight to World War
11.
Before the 19405, sororities had room for about half
of the University's female population. But by 1943
there were only enough spaces for one of four or five
women, and competition for these few spots became
nasty.
As a result, a panel of women was formed to discuss
this problem with the trustees. The panel had many
helpful suggestions for improving the situation, the
most obvious being to create more sororities to handle
the overload.
The trustees, however, argued that this suggestion
just wouldn't get at the root of the problem and chose
instead to shut down the sororities for good. Some
things may change, but not the trustees.
The sororities took their defeat with a graciousness
that suggests either that people have gotten nastier in
the last 40 years or that only polite gestures of defeat
were allowed on the record.
When then-President Donald Tresidder's announced
the news to the women as a group, "There were many
teary eyes in the audience," The Palo Alto Times
gushed. But when Tresidder left the stage the students
applauded and broke spontaneously into the Stanford
Hymn.

Later that evening, the Times continues, Tresidder
was met when he arrived at home "by a group of
sorority women who serenaded him for the second time
with Stanford songs."
The Daily was tactfully silent throughout the
sorority debate. Although discussion had lasted for 14
months, the The Daily's first story came the day after
Tresidder's announcement when it reported that
sororities were, indeed, abolished. The article's sum
mary of events focuses mostly on the hymn singing and
neglects student reactions. After that day, the student
newspaper dropped the matter except for one brief
report in July that the national sorority chapters had
withdrawn their contracts.
Fortunately, we can turn to the Times for the good
stuff. It reported alumni reactions ranging from
' outright anger" to resignation. Sorority officer Mrs.
Paul Manning of Palo Alto complained, "Whatever
steps they (the sororities) would have liked to take
toward breaking down barriers and to remedy disunity
have been denied them by the administration."
Mrs. Roger Goldsmith, also of Palo Alto, commented
darkly that "People naturally tend toward groups. I
would rather see these groups organized as the
sororities are and working toward a goal than uncon
trolled."
The active sorority members, however, took their
misfortune with better grace. "We're behind Dr. Tres
idder in whatever happens," asserted Joan Pemberthy
of Alpha Phi. "We're proud to be Stanford women —
that's what comes first," chimed in an Alpha Omicron
Phi.
So what brought sororities back in the '70s? Why was
all this glorious self-sacrifice wasted? Apparently, it
was not the wishes of the students but an embarrassing
little law called Title IX. Title IX, a 1972 anti-sex dis
crimination amendment to the Civil Rights Act of
1964, forbids universities from having fraternities un
less they also permit sororities.
The University got nervous. It consulted its lawyers.
"The feeling was that this was sufficiently troublesome
as a legal matter that the prudent thing would be for
the University to clear it up," James Sienna, legal ad
visor to then Stanford President Richard Lyman, ex
plained.

So much for idealism. So much for the vision of
hundreds of righteous women demanding their long
withheld rights. As a matter of fact, a June 1977 Daily
reported that at that point only four students had con
tacted the Office of Student Affairs to express interest
in forming a sorority.
Before long the door was opened for a sorority come
back. Moreover, they were given the option, like any
other student group on campus, to apply for University
housing. However, even with this option most
sororities chose not to be housed.
Though the resurgence was slow, interest grew.
Feminists muttered, the administration heaved a sigh
and, in early 1978, the sororities returned — if not tri
umphantly, well, at least they returned.

The problems named stemmed mostly from the in
creased number of women admitted to the University
when many male students went off fight to World War
11.
Before the 19405, sororities had room for about half
of the University's female population. But by 1943
there were only enough spaces for one of four or five
women, and competition for these few spots became
nasty.
As a result, a panel of women was formed to discuss
this problem with the trustees. The panel had many
helpful suggestions for improving the situation, the
most obvious being to create more sororities to handle
the overload.
The trustees, however, argued that this suggestion
just wouldn't get at the root of the problem and chose
instead to shut down the sororities for good. Some
things may change, but not the trustees.
The sororities took their defeat with a graciousness
that suggests either that people have gotten nastier in
the last 40 years or that only polite gestures of defeat
were allowed on the record.
When then-President Donald Tresidder's announced
the news to the women as a group, "There were many
teary eyes in the audience," The Palo Alto Times
gushed. But when Tresidder left the stage the students
applauded and broke spontaneously into the Stanford
Hymn.

Later that evening, the Times continues, Tresidder
was met when he arrived at home "by a group of
sorority women who serenaded him for the second time
with Stanford songs."
The Daily was tactfully silent throughout the
sorority debate. Although discussion had lasted for 14
months, the The Daily's first story came the day after
Tresidder's announcement when it reported that
sororities were, indeed, abolished. The article's sum
mary of events focuses mostly on the hymn singing and
neglects student reactions. After that day, the student
newspaper dropped the matter except for one brief
report in July that the national sorority chapters had
withdrawn their contracts.
Fortunately, we can turn to the Times for the good
stuff. It reported alumni reactions ranging from
' outright anger" to resignation. Sorority officer Mrs.
Paul Manning of Palo Alto complained, "Whatever
steps they (the sororities) would have liked to take
toward breaking down barriers and to remedy disunity
have been denied them by the administration."
Mrs. Roger Goldsmith, also of Palo Alto, commented
darkly that "People naturally tend toward groups. I
would rather see these groups organized as the
sororities are and working toward a goal than uncon
trolled."
The active sorority members, however, took their
misfortune with better grace. "We're behind Dr. Tres
idder in whatever happens," asserted Joan Pemberthy
of Alpha Phi. "We're proud to be Stanford women —
that's what comes first," chimed in an Alpha Omicron
Phi.
So what brought sororities back in the '70s? Why was
all this glorious self-sacrifice wasted? Apparently, it
was not the wishes of the students but an embarrassing
little law called Title IX. Title IX, a 1972 anti-sex dis
crimination amendment to the Civil Rights Act of
1964, forbids universities from having fraternities un
less they also permit sororities.
The University got nervous. It consulted its lawyers.
"The feeling was that this was sufficiently troublesome
as a legal matter that the prudent thing would be for
the University to clear it up," James Sienna, legal ad
visor to then Stanford President Richard Lyman, ex
plained.

So much for idealism. So much for the vision of
hundreds of righteous women demanding their long
withheld rights. As a matter of fact, a June 1977 Daily
reported that at that point only four students had con
tacted the Office of Student Affairs to express interest
in forming a sorority.
Before long the door was opened for a sorority come
back. Moreover, they were given the option, like any
other student group on campus, to apply for University
housing. However, even with this option most
sororities chose not to be housed.
Though the resurgence was slow, interest grew.
Feminists muttered, the administration heaved a sigh
and, in early 1978, the sororities returned — if not tri
umphantly, well, at least they returned.
