# VMC survives University pullout

### BRIAN RHOADS Staff writer 
Santa Clara Valley Medical Center
is struggling to maintain adequate
obstetrician and gynecological ser
vice since the July 1 termination of
Stanford Medical Center's residency
program, according to center and
county officials.
The county Board of Supervisors is
highly concerned that service will
suffer as a result of Stanford's pull
out, according to supervisor Zoe
Lofgren. "Stanford yanking its pro
gram has put extreme pressure on the
county," she said .

"The county is responsible for the
provision of excellent medical care,
and it has a legal and moral obliga
tion to provide adequate medical care
to all that need it, regardless of
income," she added.
Lofgren is concerned that the
hospital could at sometime be
"unable to provide sufficient care, be
cause it has been forced to scramble
for and hire scarce physicians at high
cost."
According to Robert Sillen, the cen
ter's executive director, the filling of
seven positions vacated by Stanford
generated costs totaling about
$900,000.

But Sillen said the Stanford pull
out hasn't caused any problems in pa
tient service so far. "We have to wait
and see," he said. "We are seeing
patients at the same level as when
Stanford was here last year," he said.
According to Dr. Robert Cuttler,
Stanford's associate dean for faculty
affairs and medical education, the
termination of the Stanford training
program was the result of "a long
standing concern in the department
that the training program in
[obstetrician/ gynnecology] was not
optimal. Stanford's underlying con-
cerns were educational."
When asked if Stanford had
provided adequate support to
the Valley Medical Center in its
transition period, Lofgren said,
"No."
Stanford Medical Center and
the Santa Clara Valley Medical
Center adopted four steps in
late June to ensure that care of
patients could continue after
Stanford transferred its
SCVMC-based portion of its
ob/gyn training program.
According to Spyros Andre
opoulos, director of communica
tions at the Stanford Medical
Center, three of the steps have
been carried out, including:
• At the center's request,
Stanford withdrew termination
notices issued to Drs. Paul
Hensleigh and John O'Meara,
Stanford faculty members on
SCVMC's staff,

• Dr. Theodore Fainstat, the
center's chief of service, hired
seven new obstetrician/gyn
ecologists in order to avoid
problems in providing service to
ob/gyn patients at the center,
and
• Sheldon King, president of
Stanford University Hospital,
and Sillen agreed that Santa
Clara ob/gyn patients can be
referred to Stanford in case the
center's capacity is exceeded.
A fourth step, initially agreed
on by both Stanford and Santa
Clara, was recently dropped. A
consultant, Dr. Daniel R. Mis
hell of ob/gyn at the University
of Southern California, was
scheduled to advise both parties
on steps to resolve further staff
related problems during transi
tion. According to Andre
opoulos, "Mishell has canceled
due to other commitments."
Andreopoulos said that a
neutral panel may be chosen to
examine the issue in order to
provide a broader evaluation.
