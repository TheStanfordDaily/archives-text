## Theatre Works''Alice' is a satirical success 
### DANIEL GRANT 
"A . . . My Name is Alice," a contempo
rary musical revue about the joys and
problems of being a woman in the 1980s,
began its extended run at the Burgess
Theatre in Menlo Park Friday. The pro
duction is energetic, hilarious and
should not be missed.
The revue is a collection of 23 skits
and musical numbers conceived by au
thors Joan Micklin Silver and Julianne
Boyd and contains wonderful pieces by
such noted playwrights and songwriters
as Amanda Mcßroom, Anne Meara,
Carol Hall, Steve Tesich and Stephen
Lawrence.
The cast consists of five talented and
extremely versatile actresses: Carla
Vaughn, Betty Porter, Simone Cox,
Susan Zerner and Stephanie Rhoads-
Bickham. It is a testament to their abili
ties that they can each play so many
diverse and intriguing characters so
well. The most memorable ones are
Vaughn's gruff-voiced male construction
worker, Zerner's melodramatic feminist
poet and Rhoad-Bickman's snooty psy
chologist.
In addition to the strong acting, the

music in "Alice" is very memorable and
reminiscent of the upbeat, humorous
numbers from "A Chorus Line." The
lyrics are very imaginative and clever,
as in the song "Pretty Young M," where
Vaughan, Zerner and Rhoads-Bickman
sing as they gawk at some male studs at
a strip joint: "Oh my god! Look at that! A
g-string and a cowboy hat!"
While the revue concerns women in
the '80s, it should be noted that this isn't
an anti-male play. Men, you don't have
to worry about being told what a nasty
and lecherous parasite you are.
Admittedly, "Alice" pokes fun at male
strippers, construction workers and
bosses, but the characterizations by the
actresses are never done maliciously or
in bad taste. In fact, the revue also
satirizes feminist poets, kindergarten
teachers and women athletes!
The only troublesome aspect of "Alice"
is the inclusion of three serious musical
numbers in the revue. While the some of
the songs are memorable and serious,
they seem awkward and out of place con
sidering how blatantly hilarious most of
the other skits and songs are. Still, con
sidering 20 of the skits are winners,
these serious numbers detract little from

the revue's overall success.
"Alice" is a fun, energetic and, at
times, irreverent production. Director
Leslie Martinson should be highly com-
mended for such a polished and profes-
sional production.
The final two performances of "A .. .

My Name is Alice" will be given July 17
and 18 at 8 p.m. The Burgess Theatre is
located at 601 Laurel St.in Menlo Park.
Tickets are $12 for adults, $10 for
Theatre Works subscribers and $7 for
students under 21 and senior citizens
over 64.
