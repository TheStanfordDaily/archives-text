# Charming 'Inn' provides pizza, much more

"lt's not just pizza anymore"
is Applewood Inn's catchy new
slogan, but it's hard to imagine
anything from Applewood ever
being considered "just pizza."
This is definitely no Pizza

Hut. Diners at the Inn can
choose from any of the 16 pre
arranged topping groups such
as the Dallas pizza — topped
with barbecued beef, chili,
mushrooms, onion and green
pepper. Or they may choose the
more traditional alternative of
selecting from the list of top

pings, which includes all the
usual ingredients.
Applewood's pizza is made
with a thin, flaky crust and
generous portions of mozzarella
cheese. The toppings are spread
liberally over the spicy sauce.
The Inn's atmosphere is
schizophrenic — with keg tops

and apple pictures side by side
— emphasizing the decorator's
dilemma over whether to
produce a pizza joint or a fas
hionable place d'elegance.
For example, the pizza is
gourmet but customers serve
themselves, the windows are
stained glass but the cups are
plastic, and the booths are nice
but the tables have folding
metal chairs.
In spite of all the contradic
tions in the restaurant's decor,
there's nothing disconcerting
about the fare. In addition to
the gourmet pizza, there are
several pasta dishes, crepes,
soups, salads and sandwiches.
A special Applewood treat not
to be missed is the Hungarian
Goulash Soup ($2.50/ cup). The

soup is full of delicious
vegetables — some basic fare
like carrots, others like the
cauliflower are a little unex
pected. Together, though, the
ingredients blended to produce
a pleasant if less than spicey
goulash.
Langos, a Hungarian-style
garlic bread, is worth a try for
the adventurous diner. More
like the pastry for Yorkshire
pudding than Italian garlic
bread, the dish is nevertheless
an interesting one. It too was
not very spicey, though, with
barely a hint of seasoning.
In all, dinner at Applewood
Inn provides a good meal if not
an elegant dining experience,
but who expects that from any
pizza place?
