# Computer music festival shocks Frost Thursday
## 
### JOHN LEE 
CCRMA s annual Computer Music Festival. As the
words roll off your tongue with gentle playfulness, you
ask yourself in a puzzled bewilderment, "What the hell
does it mean?"
CCRMA (pronounced KAR-ma) stands for the Center
for Computer Research in Music and Acoustics. If
you've always wondered who lives in The Knoll, the
"haunted mansion" behind Florence Moore Hall, well,
now you know — it's CCRMA. According to their cur
rent work overview, "CCRMA is an interdisciplinary
facility and major resource where composers and re
searchers work together using the computer as a new
musical and artistic medium, and as a research tool."
The annual festival will be held on Thursday at 8:15
p.m. in Frost Ampitheater.
The broadest definition of computer music would
probably include all works involving the use of some
type of computer. Consequently, the label "computer
music" can be placed on the vast majority of today's
music industry simply because it is on compact disc.
Amnon Wolman, a research associate and composer

at CCRMA, explained his concept of computer music,
saying, "I use a computer to get very distinct sounds or
gestures which I would not get otherwise. Basically,
the computer is another instrument. I don't think
(computer music) is one genre or style of music."
The types of computers that the composers use at
CCRMA range from common Macintosh computers and
Yamaha DX-7 synthesizers (considered by many to be
the industry standard) to much larger and more spe

cific computers. "Most people who come here want to
use what is unavailable to them elsewhere," Wolman
said.
So why is CCRMA having a Computer Music Fes
tival? According to Patte Wood, the administrative di
rector of CCRMA, the festival gives the staff and visit
ing composers an opportunity to present the music on
which they've been working.
The music which will be presented at Thursday's fes
tival will mostly be in pre-recorded form — all of it
being new and recent work. There will be one composi
tion involving a performer: Artis Wodehouse on digital
piano.
In describing the event Wood talked of the advan
tages of using Frost. "Doing it outside is really ideal be
cause you're not in this pre-setup situation where
you're expecting someone to be onstage. You're outside
and you can just relax and let the music really be the
focus. It's mainly a listening type of concert," she said.
Tickets for the festival are availiable at Tresidder
Ticket Office and at the door. Admission is $7 general
and $4 for students and senior citizens. Gates open at 7
p.m. for those who want to arrive early to picnic.
