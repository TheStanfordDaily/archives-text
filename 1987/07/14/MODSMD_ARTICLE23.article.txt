Goldie wins his first
professional title
Dan Goldie has struggled
through much of his first year
on the pro tour but his struggle
is over. The 1986 NCAA cham
pion captured his first title Sun
day by defeating Sammy Giam
malva, 6-7 (7-5), 6-4, 6-4, in the
finals of the Tennis Hall of
Fame Championships in New
port, R.I.
Goldie, currently ranked
113 th in the world, took home
$20,000 for his victory over
Giammalva.
The match was dead even
through most of the first set
with neither player losing serve
once. Giammalva won the set
by taking two points off Goldie's
serve in the tie breaker. In the
second set Goldie broke Giam
malva in a marathon first game
that went to deuce five times.
He broke Giammalva again in
the fifth game and then closed
out the set.
Giammalva fought back by
breaking Goldie in the sixth
game of the third set — Goldie

was up two breaks at the time.
Then Giammalva had a break
point in the eighth game but
couldn't convert as Goldie held
serve and went on to win the
match.

in the fall so that she can train
in Boulder for the 1988 Winter
Olympics. Thomas, who won
both the world and national
championships in figure
skating in 1986, will make the
move because her training site
in Redwood City has closed, ac
cording to skating pro Maureen
Reiter.
Thomas said she will return
to Stanford next spring after
the world championships.
McEnroe will play
for Davis Cup team
John McEnroe's road back to
the top took an interesting turn
Friday when he announced he
would pi'-y for the U.S. Davis
Cup tennis team for the first
time since 1984. He will appear
in an important match against
West Germany scheduled for
July 24-26 in Hartford, Conn.,
according to the U.S. Tennis As
sociation.
McEnroe took a seven-month
layoff from tennis last year and
has struggled to regain his No.
1 form. A back injury kept him
from playing at Wimbledon this
year but apparently he is now
healthy.
Joining McEnroe on the team
will be another former Stanford
star, Tim Mayotte. If the U.S.

team defeats the West Germans
it will earn them the right to
play for the Davis Cup next
year.
Marquess is named
Coach of the Year
For the second time in three
years, baseball coach Mark
Marquess has been named
Coach of the Year by The Sport
ing News. Marquess led the
Cardinal to a 52-17 record and
its first-ever College World Se
ries Championship this season.
Marquess took over as head
coach in 1977 after spending
five years as an assistant. His
teams have made the NCAA
regionals seven straight times,
reached the CWS four of the
last six years and compiled the
best record in the Pacific 10
Southern Division over the last
five years.
World series stars
off to slow starts
A month ago A 1 Osuna, Rob
Wasenaar, Ruben Amaro and
David Esquer were on top of the
world. The Stanford Cardinal
baseball team for which they
played had just captured a na

tional championship by defeat
ing Oklahoma State in the final
game of the College World Se
ries held in Omaha, Neb.
Osuna, whose heroic eight
and two-thirds innings of score
less relief against Texas kept
the Cardinal alive in Omaha, is
pitching for the Auburn Astros
of the New York-Penn League.
In four appearances he has
worked five innings and given
up 12 hits and 11 walks. He cur
rently has a whopping 16.88
ERA.
Wasenaar is fairing much
better for the Salem Angels of
the Northwest League. He has
pitched nine innings in four
games surrendering only six
hits and no earned runs. He also
has struck out 12.
Amaro, playing outfield for
the same team as Wasenaar, is
hitting .222 with one home run
and four runs batted in. After a
horrendous one for 10 start he
has five hits in his last 17 at
bats, giving him a .294 average
over that stretch.
Shortstop Esquer is playing
for the Newark Orioles in the
New York-Penn. league. He has
just two hits in 13 at-bats
giving him a dismal .156 bat
ting average.
