Women's conference canceled
Inadequate financial support has
forced the University to cancel a confer
ence on "Women, Law and Public Policy:
An Agenda for Equality" which was
scheduled for Aug. 28-30.
Vice Provost Elizabeth Traugott, dean
of Graduate Studies, expressed "deep
regret" about the cancellation, saying
the conference "would have been a major
contribution to the discussion at Stan
ford on issues of public policy, discrimi
nation and equality, and would have
brought together feminist and minority
perpectives on those issues."
The conference was to be sponsored by
the Institute for Research on Women
and Gender.
Law Prof. Deborah Rhode, director of
the Institute, said she was "extremely
distressed that we were unable to secure
adequate funding for a superb program.
It held promise to expand the dialogue
amoung scholars, policymakers,
lawyers, judges and activists."
According to an advance brochure,
featured speakers were to include Polly
Baca, vice chair of the Democratic Na
tional Committee; Rose Bird, former
chief justice of the California Supreme
Court; Phyllis Chester, author of
"Women and Madness" and "Mothers on
Trial"; Linda Ellerbee, anchorwoman for
ABC's recently canceled news show "Our

World"; and Ruth Bader Ginsberg,
justice of the U.S. Court of Appeals, Dis
trict of Columbia.
Campbell to undergo surgery
W. Glenn Campbell, director of the
Hoover Insitution, will undergo heart
surgery today to replace a defective
mitral valve. The corrective surgery will
be performed at the UC-San Francisco
Medical Center.
Campbell, who has headed Hoover
since 1959, has been a regent of the Uni
versity of California for over 20 years.
Honig stresses basic values
It is vital that U.S. college and univer
sity graduates emerge with an under
standing of basic democratic values, ac
cording to Bill Honig, California state
superintendent of public instruction,.
"One of the values of a democratic so
ciety is individual choices and judge
ments," Honig told a group of college
teachers and administrators here last
week. "But that can't go so far that we
won't make a commitment on what we
can support."
Students should know that "we as
human beings have played around with
a lot of ways of organizing political soci
ety and here's what tends to happen if
you do this or that," Honig said.

Honig addressed a July 8 conference
on "New Liberal Arts," sponsored by the
Alfred Sloan Foundation and hosted by
the Program in Values, Technology, Sci
ence and Society (VTSS).
Honig cited University of Chicago
Prof. Allan Bloom, author of "The
Closing of the American Mind," as some
one who believes that the idea of
equality of viewpoint has become so per
vasive that society has abdicated the re
sponsibility of passing on its collective
wisdom to young people.
In any society some group must
assume the task of transmitting what is
important to each new generation,
Honig said.
"Universities have opted out of that
responsibility," Honig said. "If no one
does that, we're going to pay a price for
it. We're not going to keep democracy,
we're not going to keep freedom, we're
not going to keep what's important un
less somebody owns up to that responsi
bility.
"Our public school teachers do have
that responsibility, but there's no way
they can do it without support," Honig
added.
Solar 'hot spots' last for years
Solar flares, the massive releases of
energy from magnetic fields near the
sun's surface, occur in zones that remain

stable for decades, according to Taeil
Bai, senior research associate at the
Stanford Center for Space Science and
Astrophysics.
In an announcement yesterday from
Honolulu, Hawaii, Bai said active zones
for solar flares last at least 30 years. His
findings provide indirect evidence that
four giant convection cells may account
for the large-scale magnetic patterns ob
served on the sun's surface.
"These superactive regions are large,
complex, active regions containing large
sunspots," Bai said. "There exist active
zones — or hot spots — in which super
active regions repeatedly appear." The
average solar flare rate is much higher
in these zones than elsewhere.
Bai's findings were accepted for publi
cation in the Bulletin of the American
Astronomical Society. They were pre
sented at a meeting of the Solar Physics
Division of the American Astronomical
Society.
Solar flares represent the most ener
getic explosions in the solar system. The
energy released during a big solar flare
is millions of times more than the energy
of a typical volcanic eruption. It is com
parable to the total solar energy received
by the earth in one year.
Flares are not uniformly distributed
along the solar longitude, but are con
centrated in certain areas, called "active
zones" or "hot spots."
