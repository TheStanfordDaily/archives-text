Nearly twice as many incoming fresh
men have said they want to live in
theme houses this year as compared
with last year, according to housing offi

In this year's crop of incoming fresh
men, 59 expressed interest in living in
either Ujamaa, Okada or Casa Zapata,

"The University has made a commit
ment to maintaining and developing
theme houses," said Alice Supton, assis

what I can see on evaluations from this
year, they are developing into strong,
warm environments."
According to Supton — a key member
of the advisory board which drafted the
preference card — the change in the
phrasing of the questionnaire is in
tended to "enable students who wish to
live in a theme house to express that
desire."
Supton also said the wording presents
theme houses in the same light as other
types of housing.
"Just as students are not allowed to in
dicate that they do not want to live in an
all-frosh dorm or a single sex dorm, they
