# Medicare to pay for Med Center heart transplants
## 
### LIZ LEMPERT Staff writer 
Stanford Hospital gained recognition Friday as
one of two medical centers nationwide eligible to
receive reimbursment for Medicare patients un
dergoing heart transplant operations, according
to the federal Health Care Financing Adminis
tration. (HCFA).
The Medicare coverage offers "not only an im
portant source of payment for heart transplant
patients, but also a significant message from the
federal government that the heart transplant is a
viable therapeutic procedure," said Mike Good
kind, Medical Center spokesman.
This is the most far-reaching recognition (that
a heart transplant progam) has gained," said Dr.
John Baldwin, a heart surgeon. "It represents the
official attitude that heart transplantation is no
longer experimental."
The government approval may help others in
addition to Medicare patients, according to Dr.
Edward Stinson, professor of cardiovascular sur
gery and current head of the transplant program.
The federal sanction "provides a strong official
lead for coverage of transplantation by private
third party carriers," he said.
Several years ago, research funds paid for
transplants. However, in the past few years,
some private insurance companies have begun
picking up the bill, although many firms still ex
clude it from coverage.
Traditionally, private insurance companies
have used Medicare approval as one criterion for
authorizing covererage under their own plans.
Companies which do not now pay for transplants
might reconsider their policies based on the gov
ernment decision, Stinson said.
A heart transplant costs about $125,000, in
cluding donor procurement, surgery, hospitaliza
tion and immediate follow-up care.
The reimbursement will affect about 10 per
cent of the heart transplant patients at the cen
ter, Baldwin estimated.
Under the federal guidelines, a transplant cen
ter can fall under the program for reimburse
ment if at least 73 percent of its patients survive
one year, and at least 65 percent live for two
years. The transplant facilities also
performed at least 24 operations in the past two
years.
