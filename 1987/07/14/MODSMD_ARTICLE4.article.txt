# Medicare to pay for Med Center heart transplants
## 
### LIZ LEMPERT Staff writer 
Stanford Hospital gained recognition Friday as
one of two medical centers nationwide eligible to
receive reimbursment for Medicare patients un
dergoing heart transplant operations, according
to the federal Health Care Financing Adminis
tration. (HCFA).
The Medicare coverage offers "not only an im
portant source of payment for heart transplant
patients, but also a significant message from the
federal government that the heart transplant is a
viable therapeutic procedure," said Mike Good
kind, Medical Center spokesman.
This is the most far-reaching recognition (that
a heart transplant progam) has gained," said Dr.
John Baldwin, a heart surgeon. "It represents the
official attitude that heart transplantation is no
longer experimental."
The government approval may help others in
addition to Medicare patients, according to Dr.
Edward Stinson, professor of cardiovascular sur
gery and current head of the transplant program.
The federal sanction "provides a strong official
lead for coverage of transplantation by private
third party carriers," he said.
Several years ago, research funds paid for
transplants. However, in the past few years,
some private insurance companies have begun
picking up the bill, although many firms still ex
clude it from coverage.
Traditionally, private insurance companies
have used Medicare approval as one criterion for
authorizing covererage under their own plans.
Companies which do not now pay for transplants
might reconsider their policies based on the gov
ernment decision, Stinson said.
A heart transplant costs about $125,000, in
cluding donor procurement, surgery, hospitaliza
tion and immediate follow-up care.
The reimbursement will affect about 10 per
cent of the heart transplant patients at the cen
ter, Baldwin estimated.
Under the federal guidelines, a transplant cen
ter can fall under the program for reimburse
ment if at least 73 percent of its patients survive
one year, and at least 65 percent live for two
years. The transplant facilities also
performed at least 24 operations in the past two
years.
According to Stinson, Stan
ford's success rates are well
above the federal limits, with
81 percent of its transplant
patients surviving one year,
and 75 percent surviving two
years. About 70 transplant op
erations are performed here an
nually.
Dr. Bart McCann of the
HCFA said Stanford and the
Medical College of Virginia in
Richmond meet the new federal
guidelines for Medicare reim
bursement. Eight other
transplant programs may be in
cluded in the federal program in
the next year, he said.
McCann estimated that be
tween 65 and 100 operations

will be performed nationwide
under the plan in the first year.
To be eligible for Medicare,
patients must be at least 65
years old or have been disabled
for at least two years.
Nearly all of those eligible
will fall under the disabled cat
egory, since elderly patients are
generally not considered viable
heart transplant candidates.
Stanford has yet to perform a
heart transplant on a person
over 65, Goodkind said.
Stanford and the Medical Col
lege of Virginia have long his
torical ties in transplantation.
The head of the Virginia
school's transplant program,
Dr. Richard Lower, formerly
served on the Stanford faculty.
During the 1950'5, he and Dr.
Norman Shumway, now chair
man of the Department of Car

diovascular Surgery, col
laborated extensively on the
pioneering research which
eventually led to the first
human transplant.
In January 1968, Shumway
performed the first successful
heart transplant on an adult in
the United States. The patient,
54-year-old Mike Kasperak,
survived for two weeks. Stan
ford has since installed 458 new
hearts.
The federal government's
new policy won't apply to heart
lung transplants, which are
considered experimental.
Heart-lung operations are par
tially supported under a re
search grant.
Stanford is studying infection
and rejection, the two most com
mon complications resulting
after heart transplantation.
