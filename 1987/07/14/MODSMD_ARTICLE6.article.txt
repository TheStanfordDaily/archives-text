North, McFarlane will testify today
WASHINGTON — After a day of praise and tongue
lashing yesterday, Lt. Col. Oliver North was ordered back for
a sixth day of testimony before the congressional Iran-Contra
committees, to be followed by a rebuttal appearance by his
former boss, Robert McFarlane.
McFarlane, President Reagan's former national security
adviser, intends to challenge statements made by North in at
least three areas where the former White House aide said he
had authority from superiors, said Rep. Lee Hamilton, D-Ind.,
chairman of the House Iran-contra committee.
He said those areas were: alteration of documents, the con
tra resupply program and solicitation of foreign countries for
aid for the Nicaraguan rebels.
"In all three instances, it's a question of authority," Hamil
ton said. "I think there is a flat contradiction as to those
points. He is coming in because he wants to directly dispute
and contradict the testimony of Colonel North on those
several items."
North spent most of yesterday listening to praise and occa
sional condemnation for his actions, with one committee
member declaring "there's going to be one lot of hell raised" if
North is prosecuted.
Chun replaces eight cabinet members
SEOUL — President Chun Doo Hwan replaced his prime
minister and seven other cabinet members yesterday with of
ficials he said would be neutral in coming presidential elec
tions. Foes scorned the change as cosmetic.
"No fresh and new people are included in the shakeup. All
are worn-out people," the main opposition Reunification
Democratic Party said in a statement.
"We suspect that these people would not carry out demo
cratic reforms without any hitch," it said. "It is seriously
doubtful that the new Cabinet would manage elections in a
fair and just manner."
Earlier Monday, opposition party president Kim Young
Sam demanded that the government release all political
prisoners by Friday, including those accused of being commu
nists. It was his strongest verbal challenge to Chun.
Chun agreed this month after weeks of violent anti
government demonstrations to hold direct popular elections
this fall to select his successor. His seven-year term expires in
February.
Jury selection begins in Deaver trial
WASHINGTON — Jury selection began yesterday in the
perjury trial of Michael Deaver, President Reagan's former
aide and longtime confidant, while defense lawyers fought to
keep the panel from hearing a prosecution claim that he may
have committed numerous other violations of ethics laws.
In a brief filed with U.S. District Judge Thomas Penfield
Jackson, Deaver's defense team argued that independent
counsel Whitney North Seymour has wrongfully sought
"carte blanche to drag any and all allegations of violations of
the Ethics in Government Act in front of the jury."
A five-count indictment, returned March 18, accused
Deaver of lying to Congress and a grand jury about whether
he traded upon his White House connections to build a
multimillion-dollar lobbying business, which has since
turned to shambles.
Deaver, who entered and left the courtroom without com
ment yesterday, has said previously he is confident he will be
acquitted of the peijury charges because "I had no reason to
lie because I had done nothing wrong."
Directors Guild prepared to strike
HOLLYWOOD — The Directors Guild of America met
with producers yesterday in a final effort to avoid an unprece
dented strike that would disrupt most motion picture and
television production, but prospects were described as
"dismal."
"The two sides are working very hard to avoid a strike,"
said Carol Akiyama, a spokeswoman for the Alliance of Mo
tion Picture and Television Producers. Negotiations centered
on residual payments for re-broadcast of movies and pay
per-view television broadcasts, she added.
"The two parties have been continuing the brainstorming
that we've had for many weeks," she said. "We are together in
concept with the guild on the residuals issue but the
parameters are what separate us there."
However, DGA president Gilbert Cates said at midday that
little headway had been made.
"There is no news. Things do not look better," he said.
"They are as dismal today as they have been for the past
several days."
If the strike goes off on schedule today it would be the first
in the union's 51-year history.
The 8,500-member union's contract with producers expired
June 30.
Officials of the Teamsters Union and the Screen Actors
Guild predicted their members would support directors in a
strike.
