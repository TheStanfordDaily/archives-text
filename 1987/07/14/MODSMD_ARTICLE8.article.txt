## Frosh pre-orientation to be studied this fall 
### SHAROLYN ROSIER 
Officials are researching a
tentative proposal to establish a
summer pre-orientation session
for freshmen students wanting
educational assistance, accord
ing to Albert Camarillo, a mem
ber of the Committee on Under
graduate Studies (CUS).
Camarillo said the proposal
was tabled until the fall to al
low for investigation of similar
programs at other universities.
Stanford has never had a pro
gram of this type.
According to Classics Prof.
Marsh McCall, chair of CUS,
the program would be designed
to provide college preparatory
courses rather than remedial
courses.
"It is a known fact that many
freshmen just do not cut the
mustard their first quarter,"
McCall said.
Due to students' differing

backgrounds and interests, all
students do not have the same
capabilities, he added.
Some students have ex
pressed concern that the pro
gram would result in a lowering
of University admissions stan
dards and in a division among
incoming freshmen, between
those that attend the session
and those that don't.
"This is not the case by any
means," said McCall. "Many
freshmen are on campus before
frosh orientation begins. The
athletes arrive as much as a
month before other incoming
freshmen. Such a program
would not provide any further
divisibility than already
exists."
Admissions standards would
not be affected either, according
to McCall, who said that the
University has no intention of
lowering its admissions
qualifications.
