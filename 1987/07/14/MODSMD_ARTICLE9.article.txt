The University recently announced that its overseas pro
gram in Florence, Italy will be undergoing some major
changes. The most substantial of these will be a move from a
luxurious villa outside of Florence to a building located in the
city. Though it is a shame that the University will have to
part with an estate as beautiful as the villa and its grounds,
the more centrally situated campus and the accompanying
academic changes in the program will only serve to
strengthen the program and in the long run help it to obtain
its highest potential.
In the past, the gorgeous villa has been a big attraction for
the Florence program. But the villa is located almost 20
minutes from central Florence. The location combined with
the enclosed nature of the grounds isolated students from the
culture and people they were there to experience. The villa
formed a safe enclave for English-speaking American stu
dents and was an intimidating place for Italians to visit.
Moreover, the Florence program's casual attitude toward
academic work gave it the reputation as a "party campus."
While Florence should have been a golden opportunity for
Stanford students to experience firsthand the artistic
treasures and the cultural richness of Italy — not to mention
an excellent place to practice the Italian language — it
became instead a haven for "partiers" who wanted to hang
out in Europe.
However, the soon-to-be implemented changes should
largely diminish these problems. By the end of 1988, all stu
dents at the Florence campus will live with Italian families.
What better way to become integrated into the community
and get to know people and practice Italian?
Also, students will take classes at Stanford's new building.
Besides being a place for classrooms, the centrally located
building will be accessible to Italians as well as provide a
place for American students to regroup and share their expe
riences. Further, students need not fear that the practicality
of the new building will make it aesthetically unacceptable.
Though not as fancy as the villa, the new building, on the
shore of the Arno River, is quite beautiful in its own right.
In addition to the change in location, the program plans to
spruce up its academic reputation by broadening its curricu
lum and toughening its academic standards. Though require
ments for joining the program will not change, the introduc
tory Italian language courses that are the current pre
requesites for Florence are being revamped by the Italian De
partment.
Though many of these changes may prove to be immedi
ately unpopular among students, they are ones that needed
to be made. They are ones that in the future will undoubtedly
benefit students who will attend this program.
