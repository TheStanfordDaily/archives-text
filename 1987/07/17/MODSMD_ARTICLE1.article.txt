# Toxic leaks discussed
## 
### ERIN MARTIN Staff writer 
Underground leaks from the
Stanford Research Park are
adding toxic chemicals to some
private wells in the Barron
Park area of Palo Alto, leaving
the water undrinkable, accord
ing to members of the neighbor
hood Barron Park Association.
Although the water from
these wells is not used for
drinking, the association is con
cerned because the water would
be needed for drinking if the
community loses its present
source, the Hetch Hetchy Reser
voir, said member Inge
Harding-B arlow.
The association met Wednes
day with the Department of
Health Services to discuss the
matter. Also present were rep
resentatives from the Regional
Water Quality Control Board,
the state Legislature, the City
of Palo Alto, Stanford Univer
sity and the College Terrace As
sociation.
The leaks are the result of un
derground chemical tanks that
are deteriorating, according to
property manager Paula
Kakimoto of the Department of
Land Management.
Kakimoto said the clean-up
and repair of the 12 leaks are
the responsibility of the corpor
ations renting the Stanford
owned land. Both DHS and the
Regional Water Quality Con
trol Board are overseeing the
maintenance process.
The University, as owner of
the Research Park, is "listening
in on the whole situation,"
Kakimoto said. Stanford could
be held liable for the leakage.
"At this point there has not
been a liability problem for the
University because leasees of
the property have assumed
responsibilty for the damage,"
she said.
According to Harding-
Barlow, who is also a
toxicologist, the association
seeks better communication
with government and industry
officials about the water prob

lem.
"DHS is not giving us enough
information about what is hap
pening with their leakage
sites," she said.
"We are asking that the leaks
be controlled so that the water
could potentially be used for
drinking," she added.
Mark Wilson, case engineer
from the Regional Water
Quality Control Board, said
"definite progress is being made
in cleaning things up.
"The agency is continuing to
demand reports from the com
panies in order to make infor
mation more available to the
public," he said.
According to Harding-
Barlow, the companies respon
sible for past toxic leaks include
Hewlett-Packard, Varian, Fair
child, Eiden, Teledine, Stanford
Cleaners and Eurobonda &
Alza.
Howard Hatayama and Allen
Lui, the case engineers from the
DHS, declined to comment on
Wednesday's meeting.
