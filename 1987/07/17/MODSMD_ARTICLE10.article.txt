North is no hero
In his testimony at the Iran
contra hearings, Lt. Col. Oliver
North lectured the Congress for
vacillating in its support of the
contras. He claimed he was
carrying on the battle for
democracy in Central America
while Congress abandoned the
field to the Communists.
In fact, the Boland amend
ment was never about cutting
off the contras. It was about
reforming the contras.
Despite four years of insis
tence by Congress, the Reagan
administration would do noth
ing to try to turn the contras
into a broad-based, civilian-run
opposition with democratic
values. Quite the opposite, the
CIA had been actively opposing
such evolution in order to
retain control over the contras.
A case in point was the
withdrawal of U.S. monies
from Eden Pastora's army be

cause he refused to come under
the control of the ClA
organized contra leadership. As
a hero of the revolution, Pas
tora still today has more
credibility than anyone else in
Nicaragua, but without funds
he could not go on. Resistance
in the south, where Pastora
was fighting, has collapsed. So
much for the Reagan adminis
tration's claim of a maternal
protectiveness for the
Nicaraguan resistance.
When the executive branch
refused to execute the will of
Congress, the latter had to
resort to its primary constitu
tional check on a rogue execu
tive: the power of the purse.
When the executive sub
verted this constitutional check
it was North, as the conduit for
illegal aid to the contras, who
was in a position to attach
strings to the aid. Responsibil
ity for reforming the contras in
this period fell substantially on
North's shoulders. He ignored

it completely. The illegalities of
Reagan's secret war were com
mitted, not in order to fight
communism, but to fight the
ClA's favored style of dirty
war.
The senators conspire with
North in making a travesty of
the Iran-contra hearings when
they let his claim of fighting
for democracy go unchallenged.
The man has been subverting
democracy at home in order to
keep from democratizing the
opposition in Nicaragua. The
Reagan administration made
abundantly clear what it
thinks of democracy when
George Bush was sent on his
mission to declare "love" for
Marcos's "great democracy."
North is no hero. He is, like
Reagan, a confirmed auth
oritarian. And yes, let us not
forget, the "brains" behind all
this stupidity is our resident
derelict in the White House.
