# Grape boycott is imposed upon unwrathful students
## 
### 
In late May, a group of Stanford students
convinced University Food Service to stop
serving table grapes in the dorms. Members
of the ASSU Senate, MEChA and the in
coming and outgoing Council of Presidents
met with James Keeton, director of Food
Service, and persuaded him to join the
boycott being led by the United Farm
Workers (UFW).

Food Service's concession came at the end
of a political effort which had been going on
for some time. As The Daily reported,
campus supporters of the boycott had met
with Keeton in March, only to be dismissed
as "special interests." In May, however,
with a resolution by the ASSU Senate and
inclusion in the "immediate demands" of
the Rainbow Agenda behind them, the ac
tivists succeeded in convincing Keeton that
they represented the wishes of their fellow
students.
The May 22 Daily article that related
these happenings, titled "Student wrath
leads to grape removal," quoted Keeton as
saying that his meeting with the aforemen
tioned "representatives" was to address
"how [he] would go about knowing about
student feelings on this issue." If he had
asked me at the time how to gauge student
support for the boycott, I would have
pointed his attention elsewhere: to student
consumption of table grapes. The actual
consumption of table grapes seems a far
more accurate measure of student support
than the assertions of a small group.
I won't pretend to know what Keeton
would have found had he looked into the

matter this way. I wouldn't be surprised to
hear that Stanford students were, in fact,
eating fewer grapes on account of the
boycott. I can say, however, that the stu
dent response to Food Service's action, as I
witnessed it at Wilbur, anyway, was far
from supportive. "Student wrath" was not
directed at Food Service's hesitation in
joining the boycott. On the contrary, many
students were peeved at the overnight dis
appearance of the grapes.
This is understandable. Rather than al
lowing students to express their support for
the boycott by deciding individually not to
eat table grapes, Food Service made partici
pation in the boycott obligatory for all stu
dents. A small group of activists had
succeeded in imposing its political sen
sitivities on students who, for the most
part, had never expressed an interest in
their cause.
While MEChA, the ASSU, et al., made
mention of the threat to student health
posed by certain pesticides, it is clear that
the primary reason for their effort was to
show political support for the boycott of the
UFW. To quote from the "immediate
demands" of the Rainbow Agenda, "We
demand . . . that the (University) president
express his support for the United Farm
Workers' grape boycott to the directors of
Food Service and Tresidder Union."
After all, these aren't people who or
dinarily make it their business to be guar
dians of student health. Food Service Direc
tor Keeton was never convinced of any
health threat from the grapes, which, he
said at the time, would still be served to
summer conference participants. His was a
political concession to a political group.
Purported concerns about student health
were something of a red herring.
What's more, Keeton accepted a resolu
tion by the ASSU Senate as an expression
of widespread student support for the
boycott. I'm afraid that the only people who
would agree are office-holders in the ASSU.

To argue that the ASSU Senate effectively
represents the political sentiments of Stan
ford students is pushing it a bit far. Most
Stanford students don't see the mandate of
the ASSU Senate extending much beyond
the disbursement of funds to student
groups.
Even if the ASSU were representative, if
Stanford students were generally suppor
tive of the UFW, Food Service should not
have agreed to take part in the boycott. No
department of the University should be
party to a political cause.
The University is not a democracy or
some kind of referendum-driven political
action committee. It is not a political com
munity at all. The University's mission is to
incubate leadership and thought for the po
litical arena, not to act politically on its
own. This mission is compromised by every
gratuitous political action which the Uni
versity takes.
Why not have the University, for in
stance, endorse a candidate for president
every four years? Stanford could be polled
easily enough. Like a newspaper, we could
offer our endorsement to a presidential
hopeful. Few would support this notion, but
surprisingly many are prepared to see the
University commit itself to sanctuary for
Central American refugees, the barring of
SDI research, and, yes, even total divest
ment from South Africa. The University's
only genuine political concerns are those
that touch it as an educational institution,
things like financial aid, funding for re
search and drug testing of student athletes.
Make no mistake about it: Stanford has
the potential, as an institution, to be a tre
mendous political force. The costs of realiz
ing that potential, though, are consider
able. In the future, we should be wary of
those who would undermine the delicate
niche which the University occupies in soci
ety in order to serve their own political
purposes.
