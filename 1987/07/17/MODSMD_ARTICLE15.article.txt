## Founding fathers made historic 'compromise' United States Senate turns 200 this week 
### C.R. DOUGLAS Editorial staff 
Nothing very important happened
yesterday. California was sunny, 14 mil
lion people watched the "Tonight Show"
and the U.S. government spent over $3
billion — among other predictables. But
this mid-July day hasn't always been so
ordinary.
Two hundred years ago, on July 16,
1787, inside a small room in Philadel
phia, not more than 50 white males cast
one of the most significant votes in
American history. The outcome ended
weeks of stalemate, and by most ac
counts the vote — the Great Compro
mise — saved from dissolution the
Federal Convention, the birthplace of
the American Constitution.
By mid-July, the Federal Convention
was over half completed, but little of the
Constitution had been drafted, let alone
discussed.
What had consumed most of the found
ing fathers' time up to then was a debate
over the makeup of the legislature. On
July 16, that debate ceased. The fateful
motion passed (five states to four, with
one state divided), and it was thereby
decided that in the upper house of the
legislature — the U.S. Senate — states
would have equal power in voting.
Unlike the lower house — the House of
Representatives — which would vote in
proportion to population, the upper
house would represent states, not indi
viduals.

It was the unit of representation called
for in the proposal that most lutraged
opponents. Virginia delegate James
Madison — the intellectual granddaddy
of the founding fathers — vehemently
contested the idea of representing states.
Such a plan, Madison argues in his notes
of the convention, would spoil whatever
government they created: "If the proper
foundation of government was destroyed
by substituting, equality in place of a
proportional representation, no proper
superstructure would be raised."
Madison calculated correctly: Equal
voting gave the seven least populated
states — home to one-third of the
colonial population — the ability to
frustrate majority sentiment.
From the perspective of the small
states, though, equal representation in
government was a right that they had
enjoyed ever since the republic was
founded. Under the Articles of Con
federation — the Constitution's short
lived predecessor — Congress voted
equally by state. Indeed, the very
Federal Convention that was so bitterly
divided on whether a newly drafted na
tional government should represent
states or individuals was conducted with
one vote per state.
The purpose of the meeting in
Philadelphia was to create a national
government, but not at the expense of al
ready existing state governments. Quite
the contrary, delegates spent hours care
fully crafting a constitution that took
only the most necessary power — power

to collect taxes, for instance — from the
states.
It was the delegates from small states
that most zealously guarded state
sovereignty. The sentiment of the con
vention, they argued, was increasingly
hostile to their freedom. If both houses in
the legislature were proportionally rep
resentative, Massachusetts, Virginia
and Pennsylvania — home to almost
half of the country's inhabitants at the

time — needed only one other ally
among the remaining 10 states to con
trol the government. Small states
assumed the large ones would act in con
cert.
"An equality of voices," asserted Con
necticut delegate Oliver Elseworth, "was
comfortable to the federal principle and
was necessary to secure the small states

the convention alive: the Great Compromise.
against the large."
Each side feared an over
powering combination of states.
Large states feared an alliance
of the small states in an equal
upper house, and small states
feared the large ones in a
proportional upper house.
Madison's opposition to an
equality of votes in the upper
house was of the same nature.
He feared a union of the small
states against the large ones if
the upper house voted by states,
but at the same time argued
that if it was proportionally rep
resentative there would be no
reason to fear a union of the the
large states. Madison seems to
have thought that large states
were less likely to unite than
small ones.
"Experience rather taught a
contrary lesson," Madison
believed. "Among individuals of
superior eminence and weight
in society, rivalships were much
more frequent than coalitions,"
Madison added.
But even if large states did
eventually unite, Madison had
little opposition — in a republic
the majority should rule.
New York delegate Alexan
der Hamilton — another
"fundamental" framer — sided

with Madison. "Will the people
of (Delaware) be less free, if
each citizen has an equal vote
with each citizen of (Pen
nsylvania)?" Hamilton asked
rhetorically.
But Madison, Hamilton and
the others who opposed
representing states were
defeated.
Though the proposal was
plugged as a compromise — the
upper house would vote by
state, and the lower house
would have the exclusive right
to initiate appropriations bills
— many at the convention
recognized how one-sided it
was. If a small state wanted an
appropriations bill inititated it
surely could find some membier
of the lower house to do so. The
Great Compromise, then, is a
misnomer — proponents of
proportional representation flat
out lost.
Had the founding fathers
made the Senate proportionally
representative like the House of
Representatives, America may
have evolved differently. That's
academic. But this year, the
bicentennial of the drafting of
the U.S. Constitution, gives us
at the very least a good occasion
to to consider some of the issues
that accompanied the creation
of our republic. Perhaps the
most contentious of all was re
solved yesterday, 200 Julys ago.
