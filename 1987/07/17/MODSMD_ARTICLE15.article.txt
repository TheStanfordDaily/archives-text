## Founding fathers made historic 'compromise' United States Senate turns 200 this week 
### C.R. DOUGLAS Editorial staff 
Nothing very important happened
yesterday. California was sunny, 14 mil
lion people watched the "Tonight Show"
and the U.S. government spent over $3
billion — among other predictables. But
this mid-July day hasn't always been so
ordinary.
Two hundred years ago, on July 16,
1787, inside a small room in Philadel
phia, not more than 50 white males cast
one of the most significant votes in
American history. The outcome ended
weeks of stalemate, and by most ac
counts the vote — the Great Compro
mise — saved from dissolution the
Federal Convention, the birthplace of
the American Constitution.
By mid-July, the Federal Convention
was over half completed, but little of the
Constitution had been drafted, let alone
discussed.
What had consumed most of the found
ing fathers' time up to then was a debate
over the makeup of the legislature. On
July 16, that debate ceased. The fateful
motion passed (five states to four, with
one state divided), and it was thereby
decided that in the upper house of the
legislature — the U.S. Senate — states
would have equal power in voting.
Unlike the lower house — the House of
Representatives — which would vote in
proportion to population, the upper
house would represent states, not indi
viduals.

It was the unit of representation called
for in the proposal that most lutraged
opponents. Virginia delegate James
Madison — the intellectual granddaddy
of the founding fathers — vehemently
contested the idea of representing states.
Such a plan, Madison argues in his notes
of the convention, would spoil whatever
government they created: "If the proper
foundation of government was destroyed
by substituting, equality in place of a
proportional representation, no proper
superstructure would be raised."
Madison calculated correctly: Equal
voting gave the seven least populated
states — home to one-third of the
colonial population — the ability to
frustrate majority sentiment.
From the perspective of the small
states, though, equal representation in
government was a right that they had
enjoyed ever since the republic was
founded. Under the Articles of Con
federation — the Constitution's short
lived predecessor — Congress voted
equally by state. Indeed, the very
Federal Convention that was so bitterly
divided on whether a newly drafted na
tional government should represent
states or individuals was conducted with
one vote per state.
The purpose of the meeting in
Philadelphia was to create a national
government, but not at the expense of al
ready existing state governments. Quite
the contrary, delegates spent hours care
fully crafting a constitution that took
only the most necessary power — power

to collect taxes, for instance — from the
states.
It was the delegates from small states
that most zealously guarded state
sovereignty. The sentiment of the con
vention, they argued, was increasingly
hostile to their freedom. If both houses in
the legislature were proportionally rep
resentative, Massachusetts, Virginia
and Pennsylvania — home to almost
half of the country's inhabitants at the

time — needed only one other ally
among the remaining 10 states to con
trol the government. Small states
assumed the large ones would act in con
cert.
"An equality of voices," asserted Con
necticut delegate Oliver Elseworth, "was
comfortable to the federal principle and
was necessary to secure the small states

of 1787. On July 16 of that year the delegates made a momentous decision that kept
the convention alive: the Great Compromise.
