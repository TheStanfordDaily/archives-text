The adult convention is equally
cording to Art Prof. Nathan Oliveira, a jazz en
thusiast. "The great tiling about th£ conven
tion is that it combines professionals/and
novices. It's the best experience for
jazz musicians just starting out," he said.
In recent years Stanford has becoipfe an es
tablished arena for jazz in the Bay Area. Jim
Nadel, director of the Jazz Workshop, noted:
"People come from all around the world for the
jazz at Stanford."
"Now," Oliviera commented, "people in the

jazz world are coming here to give lectures,
concerts and share their knowledge. The Man
hattan Transfer is a very popular group and
you very rarely get them to jperfbrin in a uni
versity setting," he added. /
According to Nadel, jazz was not always
recognized by the Music Department as it is
now. Nadel, a Stanford graduate, majored in
music in the early 1970s, concentrating of the
saxophone.
"Back then the sax wasn't recognized by the
Music Department as a legitimate instru
ment," NadeJ said. "They tried to list me as a
flute major and when I complained I was a sax
player they listed me as 'experimental,' " he
said. /
But things have changed. A pilot jazz pro
gram, run by the Music Department, just
finished its second year; Stan Getz has been
the artist-in-residence here for two years; and
/ the Stanford Jazz Band has been established,
as well as several small jazz ensembles.
The .Jazz Workshop and the Music Depart
ment now scratch each other's backs, accord
ing! to Nadel. "The Music Department hosts
th<| jazz camp and the convention," he said.
lend us their resources, and we lend
/ them ours."
Music Department receives additional
, support for its jazz program from a third or
} ganization, the Committee for Jazz at Stan
ford. This committee was set up three years
ago by a group of faculty members and alumni
who shared an interest in jazz. Three faculty
members in particular helped get the commit
tee going: Oliveira, Dr. William Dement, di
rector of the Sleep Disorders Clinic, Andy
Geiger, director of Athletics.
"Jazz is one of America's greatest in
digenous art forms," Dement explained, "and
it should be represented at one of America's
greatest universities."
With the combined support of many Stan
ford groups, jazz is now flourishing on campus,
and that pleases the enthusiasts.
