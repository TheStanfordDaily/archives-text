## Joffrey â€” dance lovers' heaven 
### CHRISTINA LEPNIS 
A peppery, gleaming design of pulsating
eroticism was easily one of the Joffrey Ballet's
most stylish offerings in its first week of perfor
mances at the San Francisco Opera House.
Concluding one of several mixed programs pre
sented by the Joffrey, Gerald Arpino's "Light
Rain" weaves a variety of movement forms into a
smoothly sensuous ribbon of motion. Dappled
and scintillating lighting effects enhance the
overlying vibrational energy initially suggested
by a cluster of dancers in quivering readiness.
The music is rousing and rhythmic Gamelan
(Indonesian percussion) modernized with what
seems like a streak of calypso.
The partly Eastern motif echoes in recurring
exotic and serpentine movements.
The program begins with Mark Haim's ''The
Gardens of Boboli," a collection of bright and
nimble romps to Albinoni. A slow and steady
variation on contact maneuvers is acrobatically
rendered by a male trio and provided a pause in
what might otherwise become an overdose of
crisply youthful freshness.
The confrontation of man and woman as boxers
in a ring in Arpino's "Valentine" supplies some
entertaining entanglements, but the most robust
character onstage is the contrabassist who ac
companies the bout. Dressed as a referee, he at

tentively supervises the fight while playing an
unconventional piece by Jacob Druckman and
vocalizing eccentrically.
"Esteemed Guests" by Mark Morris to C.P.E.
Bach is as carefully planned as a city map and
just as dull to observe. It serves only to heighten
the dazzling opening effect of "Light Rain,"
which follows.
The Joffrey Ballet will continue its San Fran
cisco engagement through Sunday with former
Stuttgart Ballet director John Cranko's richly
theatrical and world-renowned "Romeo and
Juliet" to Prokofiev's score.
