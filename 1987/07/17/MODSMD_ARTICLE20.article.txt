Adventures in Babysitting ****
Century 10
1500 Sterlin Road, Mountain View
This is easily the best movie about a
17-year-old babysitter, two high school
freshmen and a little girl dressed up as a
super-hero (Thor of Marvel Comics
fame) made in our time.
High school senior Chris Parker
(Elisabeth Shue), reluctantly agrees to
babysit the young but infinitely coura
geous Sarah Anderson (charmingly
played by Maia Brewton) after Chris'
"boyfriend" backs out of their date at the
last minute.
As soon as Sarah's parents get out the
door, Chris gets a call from her friend
Brenda. Stranded at the bus depot after
running away from home, Brenda asks
Chris if she will come pick her up.
For the rest of the movie Chris leads
Sarah, Sarah's brother Brad (Keith

Coogan) and Brad's obnoxious, dippy
friend Daryl (Anthony Rapp) through
the streets of Chicago. They are shot at,
hijacked by a car thief, trapped in the
middle of a gang fight on the subway and
chased by gangsters trafficking stolen
cars.
Without a doubt, the shortest member
of the cast, Brewton, runs away with the
show in her role as Sarah. Obsessed with
Thor, Sarah is fearless in every situa
tion. When the four kids first meet John
Pruit, a scraggly man with a foreboding
hook where his right hand used to be,
Sarah holds up her plastic war hammer
and boldly tells the others to, "Stand be
hind me."
Director Chris Columbus does an ex
cellent job of maintaining a fast pace
throughout the movie, avoiding any
serious stagnation.
The combination of Brewton's hysteri
cally loveable character, Columbus' fine
directing and David Simkin's witty and
inventive script make "Adventures in

Babysitting" a thoroughly enjoyable
way to spend a summer evening — even
if it does have a stupid title.

My Life as a Dog ***
Aquarius
430 Emerson St., Palo Alto
The Swedish film "My Life as a Dog" is
an insightful and engrossing look at the
world of Ingemar, a 12-year-old boy
growing up in a rural Swedish town. His
life is a fascinating montage of mis
chievousness, sexual curiosity and fam
ily hardships. When the troublemaking
Ingemar proves to be too much of a bur
den for his ailing mother, he is sent to
live with his uncle to reduce the stress
on her.
Anton Glanzelius gives a superb and
multifaceted performance as Ingemar,
who is at times a precocious punk and at
other times a philosophical and sensitive
young man. Director Lasse Hallstrom

has created a warm, funny film that
wonderfully interlaces scenes of drama
as Ingemar is forced to deal with an un
stable family environment and his sick
mother.
Not since Ingmar Bergman's "Fanny
and Alexander" and Hector Babenco's
"Pixote" has a film accurately and
sensitively dealt with complex problems
that some youth are forced to deal with
in a mature manner.
"My Life as a Dog" only fails when it
occasionally tries to use "Bergman
esque" symbolism — as when Ingemar
periodically rambles on about Laika, the
dog star, which we assume has some
deep mystical meaning, but only adds
unnecessary confusion to the film.
Except for these infrequent lapses into
arty pretentiousness, "My Life as a Dog"
is an involving, human film and is
strongly recommended.
