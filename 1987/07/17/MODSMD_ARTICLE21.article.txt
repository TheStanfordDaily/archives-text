## Hunting, fishing, pro football — they're all the same to Bo 
### 
When Bo Jackson signed with
the Kansas City Royals he
shocked the sports world. The
Heisman Trophy winning run-

ning back spurned the Tampa
Bay Buccaneers offer of $7 mil
lion over five years to play the
sport he said he loved the most.
Sometimes, though, it is a

little difficult to believe what
Bo says. When Bo signed with
the Royals he said his football
days were over — I guess the
fact that he's going to play for
the Raiders means that isn't
quite true.
Bo also said if he could partic
ipate in only one sport it would
be fishing. Now he says that
football is just "a hobby, like
hunting or fishing." Seems to
me that if he were telling the
truth he wouldn't want to play
football at all. After all, it
would take away from prime
fishing time.
When he announced his in

tention to play football he said
that baseball was still his num
ber one concern. Considering
his history of schizophrenic be
havior, I get the feeling the
Royals have a lot to worry
about.
It's really too bad that Bo has
done this sudden about-face. I
remember thinking how intelli
gent he was when he chose
baseball. He said his knees
were his "bread and butter." He
must have figured that it was
easier on his knees to steal
second base than to take a hit
from Lawrence Taylor.
To paraphrase Ben Franklin,

playing baseball would have
allowed Bo to retire healthy and
wealthy, attempting to play
both football and baseball
shows he clearly is not wise.
The issue of racism in profes
sional baseball took one of its
ugliest turns so far in the past
week, and it has gone virtually
unnoticed. The Texas Rangers
signed pitcher Steve Howe to a
minor league contract which
pretty much paves the way for
him to make it back to major
leagues.
Howe, if you will remember,
was thrown out of baseball be
cuase of cocaine use. He was

suspended so many times it was
hard to keep track.
Darryl Sconiers, unlike
Howe, was only a one-time
loser. He too was thrown out of
baseball. After his recovery he
signed on to play with the San
Jose Bees, a minor league team
that is unaffiliated with any
major league club. For Sconiers
to make it to the majors another
team would have to buy his con
tract from the Bees.
It just so happens that
Sconiers has been one of the top
two hitters is the California
League all season. As of yet no
one has offered him a contract.
It also just so happens that
Sconiers is black. So I guess the
double standard works like this:
Whites can use drugs as many
times as they want and they'll
be forgiven; blacks only get one
chance.
Darryl Sconiers deserves a
chance to make it back to the
majors, regardless of his skin
color.
