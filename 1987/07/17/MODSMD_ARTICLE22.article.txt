Hepatitis drug to be tested
Medical School researchers are start
ing to test a genetically engineered
protein called interleukin-2 (IL-2)
against the virus that causes chronic
hepatitis B, a liver disease for which
there is currently no effective treatment.
"What we're doing is trying to have an
effect on the viral infection by getting
the patient's own immune system to
more effectively combat the (hepatitis)
virus," said Dr. William Robinson, pro
fessor of medicine and the principal in
vestigator on the project.
The tests represent a new approach to
treating the disease, which affects over
200 million people worldwide.
IL-2, which made headlines more than
a year ago when federal officials re

ported its effects on cancer patients, is a
hormone produced by the body's white
blood cells that scientists think helps
regulate the immune system.
Scientists believe the experimental
drug may work against hepatitis B be
cause it boosts the activity of the body's
immune system.
Although the high doses of IL-2 used
in cancer studies produce some toxicity,
the doses administered to hepatitis
patients will be far lower and are
unlikely to cause serious side effects, ac
cording to Dr. Gulshan Bhatia, a re
searcher working with Robinson.
A vaccine to prevent infection by the
hepatitis B virus has been developed
recently, but it cannot help those al
ready infected. Since chronic hepatitis B
is extremely debilitating and can lead to

more serious conditions such as cirrhosis
and liver cancer, it is important to find a
way of treating the disease, Robinson
said.
Malaysian educators confer
Twenty senior educators and educa
tional administrators from Malaysia are
here for a special eight-week workshop
on educational development and man
agement hosted by the School of Educa
tion.
The workshop is organized by the
Stanford Program in International De
velopment Education under the direc
tion of SIDEC Chair Hans Weiler, pro
fessor of education and political science.
The participants, who are specialists
in the national education ministry and

administrators in charge of education at
the state and district levels, are meeting
to discuss developments in educational
research and practice with special atten
tion to their own fields of professional in
terest and responsibility.
Weiler is working with participants on
developing policy options for such key is
sues in Malaysian education as equity,
the use of educational technology and
prospects for educational reform.
"Programs of this kind are becoming
more and more of a priority in many
parts of the developing world, where the
initial investment in the academic train
ing of educational leaders is yielding
diminishing returns because of the lack
of opportunities for updating and enrich
ing professional competence," Weiler
said.
