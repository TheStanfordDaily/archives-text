# Fired workers protest at SRI
## News 
### A.J. THOMAS Editorial staff 
Twenty out-of-work janitors and
union representatives demonstrated
Wednesday at the entrance to SRI In
ternational in Menlo Park to
publicize what they consider unfair
labor practices by the research com
pany.
The demonstrators carried signs,
chanted slogans and passed out
leaflets to people entering and
leaving the complex.
Susan Sachen, a representative of
the Service Employees International

Union, said 25 janitors, most of whom
are minorities, lost their jobs Tuesday
when SRI began contracting with a
new firm for custodial services.
Local union leader Henry Acevedo
said the janitors, many of whom had
worked at SRI for over five years,
found out only at the end of last week
that they were going to lose their
jobs.
Acevedo said the demonstration
was an effort to "let the community
know what kind of predicament [SRI]
is putting us in."
The workers plan to picket SRI
every day next week and will contact

SRI to find out the reasons for the
contracting decision, Acevedo said.
According to SRI spokeswoman
Carolyn Simon, SRI hires a contrac
tor for janitorial services every year
and that contractor in turn hires cus
todial personnel. SRI had previously
contracted with International Service
Systems (ISS). On Tuesday it began a
contract with a new firm, High Tech,
which has said it will not employ the
same janitors to work at SRI, Simon
said.
Simon said the decision to change
contractors was based on "pure
finance and quality of work."
SRI solicited bids from 12
janitorial contractors and chose
High Tech because it offered
"superior quality" at a lower
price, she said. The ISS bid was
one-third higher than it was
last year, she added.
Simon said SRI announced its
decision to contract with High
Tech on July 1.
"We are not going to sit still
and let SRI use us as pawns to
get cheaper work done,"
Acevedo said.
"If they wish to allege that
there were problems with work
performance, then we want to
know specifically what those
problems are," he added.
When asked if the demonstra
tion would persuade SRI to
rehire the unemployed janitors,
Acevedo replied that there was
"a possible chance that they
would."
If SRI does not respond, the
union intends to pursue "all
avenues, legal and otherwise,"
Acevedo said. The union has
contacted representatives of the
Santa Clara and San Mateo
labor councils to discuss future
plans, he added. "We need to

take a look at the whole situa
tion," Acevedo said. "We don't
want to be shooting from the
hip."
The union's immediate plans
include "reaching to community
groups, including Stanford
groups" and possibly holding a
larger demonstration, he said.
Sachen said SRI "has a re
sponsibility to those janitors,
whatever contractor they hire.
"They have an obligation to
pay their workers a living wage
and decent benefits. They can't
use a change of contractors as a
means to cut costs," she said. •
According to Sachen, the un
ion tried to contact SRI about
its grievances, but SRI did not
return the calls. SRI and ISS
"were passing the buck to each
other," she said.
Simon disputed Sachen's
claim. "I doubt that," she said.
"That's not SRI policy."
According to Simon, SRI was
created by the University in
1940 as a research entity. It was
called the Stanford Research In
stitute until it separated from
the Unversity in 1970 to
become SRI International.
SRI is now an independent,
nonprofit research firm employ
ing 3500 people in 110 different
research areas including chemi
cals, pharmaceuticals, robotics,
artificial intelligence and busi
ness consulting, Simon said.
