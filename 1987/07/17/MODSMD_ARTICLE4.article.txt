# Officials oppose new tax proposal

Stanford will lose over $14 million annually if
a proposal to tax the endowment revenues of all
organizations that enjoy tax-exempt status is ap
proved, Provost James Rosse said yesterday.
The proposal, which would tax endowments 5
percent annually, is one of 100 options for en
hancing federal revenue contained in a pamphlet
circulated by the Joint Committee on Taxation
and the House Ways and Means Committee.
Stanford administrators and members of the
American Council on Education (ACE) sharply
criticized the proposal, which could cost educa
tional, religious, scientific and charitable organi
zations more than $15 billion over the next three
years.
The loss the proposed taxes could impose on the
University would exert "real pressure on tuition
and academic programs," Rosse said.
Endowment money provides 12 to 13 percent of
the University's operating budget, Rosse said.
Thus, the prospective loss through taxation
would be slightly more than the University's
funding of undergraduate student aid.
Larry Horton, associate vice president of public
affairs, said the tax would "impair the ability of
the University to continue to provide a wide ar
ray of academic programs."
Rosse said the proposed tax would put heaviest
pressure on private educational institutions,
many of which rely much more on endowment
than do state colleges and universities. But the
change "could add to the costs of the state and
federal government" in the long run, he said.
The tax is under consideration by the House
Ways and Means Committee as part of the
budget reconciliation process. Most of the other
ideas contained in the 294-page pamphlet were
considered but rejected during last year's revi
sion of the tax law.
Sheldon Steinbach, vice president and general
counsel of the ACE, warned that the proposal
would have "a substantial adverse impact" on
colleges and universities.
It would be "inconsistent with the concept of
tax exemption" and would "set a precedent for
(treatment of) uiversities and colleges," he added.
Fourteen national educational organizations
belong to the ACE.
"The tax will not be fundamentally different
from a tax on tuition or charitable contributions,
which are not taxed under present law," Stein
bach said.
Many universities would have tax liability un
der the proposal. Unlike for-profit entities, uni
versities do not have investors to whom they
could reduce dividend payments in order to pay
the proposed tax, Steinbach added.
