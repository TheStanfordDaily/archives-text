# Antibody therapy may help cure diabetes patients
## 
### MARK ROGOWSKY Editorial staff 
Researchers at the Medical School
have developed a therapy that could lead
to a cure for Type 1 diabetes, a disease
that affects as many as 1 million
Americans.
The therapy uses monoclonal an
tibodies — disease-fighting proteins
made by the immune system — to
ensure lifelong acceptance of trans
planted tissues in animals.
Patients with Type 1 diabetes are
unable to produce sufficient insulin to
maintain a normal blood sugar level.
The only alternative to a lifetime of in
jections is the transplanting of healthy
islet cells — so named because they come

from the "islets of Langerhans" in the
pancreas — which secrete insulin.
The transplants have not worked very
well, though. The problem involves the
transplant recipient's natural tendency
to attack and destroy foreign tissue, ac
cording to Dr. C. Garrison Fathman, as
sociate professor of medicine.
In the past, powerful drugs have been
used to prevent the recipient from reject
ing the transplant. But these drugs have
to be administered throughout the life of
the patient and often produce harmful
side effects, such as reduced resistance to
infection.
The work of Fathman and his col
leagues Dr. Judith Shizuru, Anita
Gregory and C. Tien-Ben Chao, offers
the possibility of making the transplants

far more practical. The researchers have
found that injected laboratory mice with
monoclonal antibodies the mice do not
reject transplanted tissues.
Monoclonal antibodies have been used
in the past to control rejection in kidney
transplants. What makes this work
unique is that a permanent state of
"tolerance" develops for the transplant
by the immune system, Fathman said.
"We're able to create tolerance in the
animals with one course of monoclonal
antibodies and no other treatment," he
said.
Doctors will continue with research
before the procedure will be applied to
humans. "To find the optimal therapy
(for human applications). . . there's a lot
more you have to go through," Shizuru

said.
Testing the therapy on primates
should begin within a year, she added.
The monoclonal antibody, designated
as anti-L3T4, works by killing the
transplant recipient's supply of white
blood cells responsible for rejection.
The antibodies temporarily deplete
about 95 percent of the cells, which are
known as "helper" T lymphocytes. When
the T cells grow back they seem to be un
aware that the tissue is foreign and
therefore do not attempt to reject it.
She said the therapy may eventually
replace hormone therapies, such as in
sulin. While islet cells are difficult to
transplant, the cells of other hormone
secreting organs are often easier to work
with, she added.
