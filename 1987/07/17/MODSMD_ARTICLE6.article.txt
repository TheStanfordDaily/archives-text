Poindexter says he didn't tell Meese
WASHINGTON — Former national security adviser John
Poindexter testified yesterday that in his final corjyersations
with the president, attorney general and White House chief
of staff last November, none of them asked what he knew
about the diversion of U.S.-Iran arms sales proceeds to the
Nicaraguan rebels.
Poindexter testified further that he offered no explanation
to them why he decided the previous February to approve the
diversion plan without telling the president or other senior
officials what he had done.
That testimony, along with other new assertions, was
elicited by Iran-contra probers whose questions yesterday
challenged Poindexter's credibility and the plausibility of his
dramatic assertion Wednesday that he never told President
Reagan of the diversion because he wanted to protect him
from political damage if it ever became public.
But a skeptical Arthur Liman, chief counsel of the Senate
Iran-contra panel, asked Poindexter why it had taken him
eight months to reveal a piece of information that would have
helped exonerate a president Poindexter said he wanted to
protect.
Poindexter responded: "That's a hypothetical question and
before I made the decision to retain attorneys, I was obvi
ously giving it a lot of thought."
Judge postpones Deaver perjury trial
WASHINGTON — U.S. District Court Judge Thomas
Penfield Jackson yesterday postponed until Oct. 19 the per
jury trial of former White House deputy chief of staff Michael
Deaver, blaming the news media for an appeals court deci
sion that he said destroyed his ability to preside over the
case.
The judge said the ruling requiring him to cease private
questioning of prospective jurors in the case had ruined his
credibility with the jury panel and left him uncertain how to
proceed.
"I am also satisfied that the several interruptions of these
proceedings occasioned by the news media's efforts . . . have
left an impression in the minds of the panel that it is the
news media, not the court, who dictate the pace of the trial
and the manner of the proceeding," the judge said later in a
written opinion.
Jackson reset the trial of Deaver for October in order to al
low a Supreme Court appeal on the secret-questioning issue.
Deaver's lawyers announced that they would seek the Su
preme Court review and independent counsel Whitney North
Seymour Jr. said he would request all members of the U.S.
Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit to
review the jury decision, issued Wednesday by a three-judge
panel of the court.
Scientists question sweetner's safety
WASHINGTON — More than half the scientists respond
ing to a government survey on the use of aspartame, the
enormously popular sugar substitute marketed as Nutra-
Sweet, expressed concerns over its safety, according to a Gov
ernment Accounting Office report released yesterday.
Contained in dozens of products, ranging from diet sodas
and breakfast cereals to vitamins, the artificial sweetener is
consumed by 100 million Americans each day. Even before it
was approved for use by the Food and Drug Administration
in 1981, the product was controversial. Critics charge that it
might cause brain tumors, seizures, mood swings and head
aches.
Because it has no medical expertise, the GAO made no rec
ommendations in its report. It found that the FDA adhered to
proper procedures by approving the sweetener.
Officals of the NutraSweet Company hailed the results and
so did the sweetener's strongest critics.
"The report provides additional evidence to add to the over
whelming consensus among scientists and health officials . . .
that aspartame is safe and that the process through which it
was approved was proper and adequate," the company said in
a statement.
Congressmen remember compromise
PHILADELPHIA — On a sunny afternoon rich in pomp
and pageantry, but overshadowed by a continuing Washing
ton scandal, more than 200 members of Congress traveled
here by train from Washington yesterday to celebrate the
bicentennial of the "Great Compromise" that led to the crea
tion of the United States Senate and House of Representa
tives.
The festive afternoon gathering celebrated a plan ratified
by the Constitutional Convention of 1787 that led to the crea
tion of a bicameral congress. More than 5,000 people wit
nessed the event, which marked the largest bipartisan as
sembly of members of Congress ever held outside of Washing
ton.
Amid fife and drum, marching bands and a profusion of on
lookers dressed in revolutionary-era costumes, members of
Congress gathered in historic Independence Hall.
