The dermatolgy out

Stanford University Clinic
will offer a free skin can

The screening, under
the direction of Dr. Chung-
Hung Hu, director of the
dermatolgy clinic, will be
open from 10 a.m. to 4
p.m., and will be free to all
ages. No appointments
will be necessary and ex
aminations will consist of
a simple visual check of
moles and other skin le
sions. Anyone with a
suspected diagnosis of skin
cancer will be advised to
have further tests.
A similar clinic held last
year brought 187 persons
in for examinations, 20 of
whom were diagnosed as
possibly having some type
of skin cancer.
Skin cancer is the most
common form of cancer in
the United States, but
most skin cancers are com
pletely curable if detected
early enough.
