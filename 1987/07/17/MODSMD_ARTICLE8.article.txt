### 
The number of incoming freshmen indicating preferences
to live in an ethnic theme house nearly doubled over last
year, according to thte recently returned housing preference
cards. However, interest in these houses has not necessarily
increased, and the new tactic that the Office of Residential
Education used on the cards for determining the level of stu
dent interest is questionable.
The problem here is not whether Casa Zapata, Okada and
Ujamma should continue to exist. That concern has always
been a matter for spirited debate, and one that will undoubt
edly continue throughout those houses' tenures here.
Rather, it is Res Ed's new statistic that deserves a dose of
skepticism. The new housing card allows students to indicate
only positive or neutral interest in these houses. Previously,
students could indicate a preference not to live in a theme
house. The higher number of "interested" students may only
reflect this revised questionnaire.
Second, the numerical shift itself is not particularly over
whelming. Although the phrase "nearly doubled" sounds ap
pealing, the new total is still only 59 students. Considering
that this comes from a class of about 1500, the new number
lacks significance. Further, it does not even approach the 120
spots in the three houses designated for freshmen.
Numbers aside, the altered questionnaire limits students'
choices in a way that is intrinsically unfair. Some freshmen
may have a preference to not live in ethnic theme houses —
for reasons that are very legitimate. For example, incoming
black students may look forward to University life as a tre
mendous opportunity to assimilate into a diverse cultural en
vironment. This does not mean they must surrender their
cultural identity, but they may wish not to have that identity
be the focus of their residential life, and therefore want not to
live in Ujamma.
Further, some freshmen may simply not want to deal with
understanding a whole new culture as part of the residential
package for their first year at college.
The three houses do present an invaluable opportunity to
learn about another culture. But to succeed, the opportunity
requires students who are open to the idea. Imposing it
through a no-choice system is no way to gain receptive stu
dents. But 61 freshman who did not choose to live in theme
houses will have to.
