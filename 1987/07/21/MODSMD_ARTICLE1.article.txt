# Animal bill postponed
## 
### ERIN MARTIN Staff writer 
It may be a while before Cali
fornia students can choose to sit
out of laboratory animal experi
ments that they find offensive.
The education committee of
the California Senate last week
postponed a vote on a bill that
would allow students kinder
garten through 12th grades to
refuse to participate in class
work involving what they con
sider harmful use of animals.
The earliest the bill will be con
sidered is mid-August.
The bill states that teachers
must provide alternative class
work for students with moral or
ethical opposition to course ac
tivities that may "destroy or in
any way harm animals
(including capturing, incarcera
tion, experimentation and kil
ling)."
AB-2507 was introduced by
Assemblywoman Jackie Speier
in March and originally per
tained to students at all levels
of education. It was amended in
May to exclude college and uni
versity students.
The Assembly rewrote the
bill May 28 after protest from
several universities, including
Stanford and UC-Berkeley.
Stanford "vigorously op
posed" the original version of
the bill, according to Larry Hor
ton, associate vice-president for
public affairs.
In a letter to Speier, the Uni
versity denounced the original
bill on the grounds that "the
state would be prohibiting us
from teaching students who
elect to take particular classes
the facts and techniques we
judge essential to them."
After the Assembly education
committee rewrote the bill to
apply to primary and secondary
school students only, Stanford
withdrew its opposition because
the new version no longer ap
plied to the University.
Stanford does not take a polit
ical stance on a bill unless it di
rectly affects the University,
Horton said.
According to Michael
Thompson, Speier's chief of
staff, the bill was changed be
cause of "the mobility available
to college students who can
choose which classes they want,
avoiding those with dissections

or other morally offensive
animal studies."
Thompson said the new ver
sion of the bill is designed to
protect younger students who
do not have the opportunity to
select classes and may be in
timidated by teachers.
"It gives the kids backing to
stand up for their moral convic
tions," he said.
"The teacher has the final
say," said Thompson. "If there
aren't any available sub
stitutes, the teacher can decide
that the student should partici
pate."
The bill was considered by
the education committee July
15 but will not come before the
full Senate until as early as
next month and possibly not un
til the Senate's next session in
January.
Horton also said the Univer
sity is "very opposed" to a com
panion bill introduced to the
Senate last March by Senator
Alan Robins.
This bill is similar to Speier's,
but would apply to students at
university and college levels as
well as secondary levels, ex
cluding medical and veterinary
students.
