## No Westin hotel 
### 
The July 7 Daily article on
the University's plan to enter
into a joint venture with Wes
tin Hotels to build a 380-room
hotel at the intersection of In
terstate 280 and Sand Hill
Road reported apparent con
cern over the corporation's
possible investments in South
Africa. Once this was cleared,
the decision to move forward
was approved.
I was somewhat flabber
gasted that there seems to be
no concern about yet another
University edifice marring the
natural beauty of this area.
The 21 acres this project will
cover is the last remaining
piece of pasture land left on
Sand Hill.
Over the last 20 years the
University, in its objective to
assert its presence and
dominance in the world of edu
cation, has destroyed the

landscape, particularly in the
open space peripheral to the
campus.
This isn't just any landscape.
This area is one of the more
beautiful creations of nature in
the world. I would venture to
guess that Mr. and Mrs. Stan
ford would be quite upset to see
what their trustees have done
with their farm.
We have long since passed
the point at which those of us
who are native to this area
speak to the "once upon a time"
beauty that was Stanford Uni
versity, now covered with con
crete and asphalt.
There is a construction
mania here at Stanford. One
cannot drive too far down
Campus Drive without running
into dump trucks, cement
mixers, trenches and building
construction.
It is time to face up to the
impact the University is
having on the environment.
The open space it is encroach
ing upon, both on and off

campus. The enormous quan
tity of dangerous waste is
generates.
There is a point where the
collective ego of this University
needs to be checked by the
heart. By a caring for natural
beauty. By a regard for the
impact of its actions upon the
environment. To confront
where it stands on the premise
"the end justifies the means."
The University will be elimi
nating yet another 21 acres of
graceful California pasture
land for the purpose of profit
and living in grand style. Two
swimming pools, a running
track, cocktail lounges, large
meeting rooms. We have
enough of this already. We
have less and less landscape.
So which will it be? The ego
of Stanford or the heart? The
conservation of something
beautiful or a megalopolis of
edifices to deans and executives
and trustees?
