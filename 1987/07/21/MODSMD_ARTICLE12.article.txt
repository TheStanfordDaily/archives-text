# Political buzzwords can lose their credibility
## 
### 
"Credibility" is an odd word. Roughly
translated to "believability" or
"dependability," and supposedly connoting
broad moral categories like trust, truth and
honesty, the word has mutated somewhat
lately. Or rather, politicians and the media
have hijacked it from its more ethically
grounded roots. Put baldly, credibility now
means power.

I'm not talking about the kind of "inner
power" or strength that someone may
derive from a creed or belief. I simply mean
power â€” as in force, as in a political bludg
eon of sizable proportions, or as in
megatonnage and throw weight, if you will.
Item: Iran-contra scandal weakens
Reagan s credibility with the Soviets at INF
talks in Geneva. The "damaged credibility"
syndrome appears in its most virulent form:
lost bargaining leverage against the
Soviets.
Rumor has it that the Kremlin may once
again link Reagan's strategic defense initi
ative to any new treaty eliminating
intermediate-range nuclear forces in
Europe. Such a move would effectively
erase the impact of the now canonized Gor
bachevian concessions on the SDI issue in
February.
So: credibility as bargaining chip.
Credibility quantified. The credibility
quotient. The silly thing is that credibility

in this realpolitik sense has absolutely
nothing whatsoever to do with belief.
If anything, Reagan's weakness on the
domestic front should test Gorbachev's
credibility at the bargaining table. The So
viet General Secretary has staked his repu
tation as a man of peace on the INF conces
sions he made this year. Were he to sud
denly backtrack and put glasnost and a
treaty-signing summit on hold, Gorbachev
would never hear the end of it from
Europeans on both sides of the Iron Cur
tain. His public relations blitz would
crumble in a hurry. Why then is there no
talk of an imminent collapse of Gorbachev's
credibility? Because Gorbachev is viable.
Clearly Reagan, too, must be a viable
representative of American interests in or
der to negotiate with Gorbachev. But
viability is a far cry from credibility. The
former measures practical effectiveness;
the latter measures faith. Ask Jimmy
Carter how far faith goes in the arms treaty
business, or in relations with the Soviets in
general.
Another erosion of linguistic efficacy is
the damnable phrase "credible deterrent."
Literally the words should mean "a
preventive force capable of inspiring
belief." And perhaps the game of super
power nuclear poker really does boil down
to will and determining who's the best bluf
fer.
But deterrence has nothing to do with
belief. It has to do with facts and satellite
intelligence and putting my numbers
against yours and seeing that they're
roughly even.
I sure hope deterrence isn't a matter of
faith. In that light, "credible" seems merely
a catchy word of emphasis tacked on to

"deterrent" in the early '70s by some Kis
singerian neophyte at the State Depart
ment hoping to give arms control (or arms
buildup) a good name. . . . Strike two to
modern usage.
Finally the word belongs. "Ollie North's
testimony found credible by a majority of
Americans." "White House credibility gap
in the public s eyes." It is normal procedure
in a courtroom to cross-examine the
credibility of a witness by bringing in char
acter testimony from those on the sidelines
familiar with the person under scrutiny.
We simply want to know whether the per
son can be trusted; whether the person has
a history of forthrightness or a pattern of ir
regularity.
OHie North has established credibility.
Ronald Reagan has lost it. North is power
ful and Reagan limp. North has Congress in
his hip pocket; Reagan will never again
have it easy with the legislature.
So in some strange way, there is a rela
tionship between faith and political power.
Ollie for President" is not an uncommon
rally cry these days. North has tapped the
Rambo in us, and we have correspondingly
beknighted him with credibility.
That s a lot of blind faith in a very short
time. I'm wary of applying such criteria as
faith and credibility to politics, however
neatly they describe the wildly fluctuating
national mood.
At the very least, "credibility" should be
applied sparingly and only in those cases
where an emotional gut check is required.
When "credibility" serves as a surrogate
amplifier of naked power, it reeks of hypoc
risy.
