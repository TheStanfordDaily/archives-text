## Hotline callers cite relationship problems The
						Bridge smooths out 'troubled waters'

Be non-judgmental, be empathetic
and don't give personal advice." These
are the first three "commandments"
taught to students who staff the Bridge,
Stanford's peer counseling center that
offers free and confidential therapy.
The philosophy behind peer counsel
ing here is "that people are capable of
solving most of their own problems of
daily living if given the chance. The role
of the counselor is not to solve people's
problems for them, but rather to assist
them in finding their own solutions," ac
cording to the book, "Peer Counseling:
Skills and Perspectives."
The book is required reading for stu
dents in the Bridge's intensive training
class, offered in cooperation with the
Psychology Department. In the class stu
dents learn listening and problem
solving skills through lectures, videos
and discussions.
As part of the training, students
practice these skills on each other by "co
counseling." In co-counseling one class
member plays the role of "counselee"
and presents a simulated or real prob
lem. One of the others acts as counselor
and tries to help develop solutions.
During the regular school year stu
dents receive two units of credit for the
training class, but in the summer a con
densed, non-credit workshop that
teaches the same communication skills
is offered.
According to workshop coordinator

Joseph Dien, the summer class helps to
involve community members who are
unrepresented during the regular school
year, such as faculty, staff and high
school students.
After completing the class, partici
pants are evaluated and, if approved,
may opt to become "staffers," volunteers
who monitor the 24-hour hotline and
counsel drop-in visitors. In addition,
there are four student "live-ins" who
stay at the Bridge the entire year.
"We are here 24 hours a day, 365 days
a year," said live-in Sara Spears, a
graduate student. "We're open to
everybody — students, non-students,
community members. We're here and we
care," she added.
According to Spears, 40 percent of the
hotline calls concern relationships.
These problems include not only roman
tic relationships, but also friendships,
roommate concerns and parent issues,
she said.
Ten percent of the calls come from
people who are lonely or depressed.
Many callers just need someone who will
listen, but, according to Spears, staffers
are trained to identify those who may be
suicidal.
Former live-in Jackie Crawford, a
senior, still recalls her early experiences
counseling.
"When you first become a live-in, your
blood pressure goes up 20 points
everytime the phone rings. The first
night you're on call you don't sleep. You
keep thinking about the phone — it's
gonna ring, it's gonna ring," she said.

The student volunteers also learn
about human behavior. As senior biol
ogy major Cedric Chin put it,"In a scien
tific experiment you think you know
what will happen and therefore can
make a hypothesis. It's predictable. With
people, this is not so."
According to Crawford, "You become
aware of a lot of different lifestyles very
quickly." But harking back to the first of
the peer counseling commandments she

said, "You have to be non-judgmental.
You never express your shock. You take
[the problem] in and try to help as best
you can."
The Bridge has followed the philoso
phy of being non-judgmental since it was
created in the 19705. Its name was in
spired by the popular Simon and Gar
funkel song, "Bridge Over Troubled
Waters," which expresses the same phi
losophy.
