# Security concerns prompt entrance restrictions at Meyer
## 
### ANDY COHEN 
Bars aren't the only places where you need to show
an ID.
A major policy change this summer at Meyer Library
requires that all patrons show either a Stanford ID or a
library privilege card to get into the library.
Until June 22, Meyer had an open access policy.
From the day it opened in 1967, anyone could use its
facilities. The idea of restricting access, however, has
always been considered. It resurfaced this year for two
main reasons.
First, Meyer's head librarian Susan Perry believed
entrance restrictions were necessary to improve stu
dent services. Previously, she said, too much staff effort
was taken up assisting local community members un
familiar with the library at the expense of giving time
to Stanford students.
The second reason was a big increase in the number
of men performing sexually indiscreet acts in the li
brary. A recent police study found that 80 percent of
the men caught at Meyer for such acts were not affili
ated with Stanford. Many women who witnessed this
behavior were traumatized and complained about the
lack of security in the library.
"One of the things I'm interested in is providing a
safe and secure place for students to do their academic
work," Perry said.
In January, the library staff held a meeting with
campus police and a Cowell Student Health Center rep
resentative. After the meeting, participants urged that
access to Meyer be restricted.
Decker Walker, chairman of the Academic Council
Committee on Libraries (ACCL), the body that has
final authority over library policy, asked Perry to sub
mit a paper to the ACCL presenting the pros and cons
of a restricted access library.

The ACCL reviewed Perry's paper and authorized
the policy change.
Because of the changes that had to be made — estab
lishing entrance criteria, notifying the public of the
transition and portal restructuring — it was decided
that restricted access would begin in June, when there
is the least traffic. Perry believes that fall quarter will
be the true test of how much of a difference the policy
change will make.
Marilyn Calvey, one of the library portal monitors,
said her job is very different now. Before restricted
access, her role was very passive. Now she has to tell a
large number of people they can't enter the library.
Many women are glad of the change. Carol Paulson,
a 1984 graduate who is here studying for the summer,
is content about the move to library entrance restric
tions. "Although personally it's a detriment to me now,
I can see the need for it, and would have preferred that
the library was limited to student use when I was an
undergraduate," she said.
Not everyone is in favor of the change, however. One
Stanford senior has mixed feelings. "If there's a prob
lem, it has to be solved, and that's the way to solve it.
But it's a hassle. I just went down to get a drink and
they asked me for my ID again. I had to tell them that I
would go up and get it, then bring it down and show it
to them," she said.
A graduate student who discovered the change about
a week ago finds it unnecessary. "I think it's a big in
convenience. The risks of unsavory types are so small
that it doesn't merit the inconvenience," he said.
Despite the perceived inconvenience, there are
generous library privileges for non-Stanford patrons.
Anyone who does not have a Stanford ID has a couple of
options. They can get permission to use the library for
up to seven days out of the year with a valid picture ID
such as a driver's license, or, for more than seven days,


they can purchase library privileges.
Privileges only give people access to Meyer's collec
tion. To check out books, patrons must purchase a bor
rowing privilege card.
