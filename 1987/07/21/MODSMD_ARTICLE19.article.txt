## Theatre Works' 'The Rink' â€” a performance on thin ice 
### DANIEL GRANT 
You would think a musical by John
Kinder and Fred Ebb, the team that
created scores for such memorable shows
as "Caberet," "Zorba" and "Woman of
the Year," would have a lot going for it.
You would think a musical that deals
with the lack of communication between
a mother and daughter would be emo
tional and interesting. Unfortunately,
this isn't the case with Theatre Work's
production of "The Rink."
The musical takes place inside a
deteriorating roller-skating rink on an
East Coast boardwalk. The rink has
been willed to two people: a saucy Italian
mother named Anna Antonelli (Alma
Sayles) and her daughter Angel (Jeanne
Smith), who is off in California living in
a commune, smoking pot and pre
sumably having "unsafe sex."
Angel returns home to the rink after
seven years of promiscuity and pot
smoking. To her horror she discovers
that her mother has unscrupulously
forged her signature to have the rink
demolished by some wreckers. Can An
gel convince her mother not to have the
rink destroyed? Will the rival relatives
ever see eye to eye?

Well, despite a somewhat promising
premise and strong acting by both
Sayles and Smith, the musical fails be
cause of unmemorable songs and a
melodramatic plot that rapidly
degenerates into a soap opera.
The cliches run rampant in the play.
Angel spouts the nauseating 1960s
idealism she learned in the commune
("We made a difference holding hands!").
Anna's father-in-law shockingly claims
"I have no son" as a loud bolt of lightning
is heard offstage and Anna philosophi
cally notes, "You can't hold on to the
past." Lines like these help keep the
characters one dimensional and the
viewers from caring if Anna and Angel
ever bridge their generation gap.
An ongoing series of flashbacks adds
confusion rather than enlightenment to
the storyline. The overlapping of the
past with the present isn't done effec
tively or coherently. In addition, it just
isn't visually satisfying for the same ac
tors to play scenes from their past
(especially Smith's performance as the
squeaky-voiced, six-year-old Anna).
"The Rink" does have a few genuinely
funny moments, some good acting and
energetic choreography. The male

chorus of wreckers is the highlight of the
show, and its members deserve praise for
successfully doubling as thugs, drunks
and little old ladies. The guys from
"Monty Python" would be proud.
However, these bright moments can't
save the poor script and bland songs.

"The Rink" remains a musical in need of
some serious rennovations and repair
work.
"The Rink" plays through August 29
at the Lucie Stern Theatre on 1305 Mid
dlefield Road in Palo Alto. For ticket in
formation call (415) 329-2623.
