# Wine tasting: a blend of education and alcohol

### STEVEN K. GLIKBARG 
Those looking for a real
Californian experience this
summer ought to consider wine
tasting tours in Napa Valley.
Beyond providing a slice of Cal
ifornia life, the tours are easily
accessible and can be very in
formative.
Maps of Napa, which are
helpful in planning visits to the
major wineries, are available in
most markets and liquor stores.
There are over 140 wineries in
Napa, most of which are open to
the public. So even without a
map, no one should have trou
ble finding them.
Many wineries offer tours
that show each step in the pro
duction of wine. Most have a
guide, but some tours are self
guided, which I think are more
interesting since the signs in
each room tend to give more
detailed information than
guides have time to.
Each tour explains how
grapes can be made into either

red or white wine. The process
of fermentation and the impor
tance of when to stop the proc
ess is outlined. The signs or
guides explain how each type of
wine is then treated and stored
to insure the desired flavor.
Just the experience of smell
ing the aroma of the wine that
has permeated the walls and
standing next to a barrel of
wine that's larger than most
dorm rooms makes each tour a
treat.
While just about all tours are
optional, occasionally a winery
will require that guests take
the tour before drinking the
wine. These tours tend to be
shorter (about 10 minutes in
stead of 30) and go into signifi
cantly less depth about the
wine-making processes.
The wine-tasting mystique
should not be allowed to
frighten anyone away from
Napa Valley. One day of tasting
is guaranteed to teach each
visitor the complete list of catch
phrases as well as some true

pointers on how to distinguish
fine (or not-so-fine) wines.
In every winery's tasting
room there is a list of wines
they are serving that day. The
list is in the order that the
wines are served. Whites are
served before reds, and dry
wines with very little residual
sugar are served before sweet
wines. This way an earlier bou
quet will not cloud the flavor of
the next wine.
There are four ways to evalu
ate the wines. Each is very sub
jective and the value given each
criterion is up to the person
judging.
The first point is appearance.
Does the wine look good? Per
sonally, I'm not very picky in
this catagory, I just like a white
wine to look different from
water and a red wine to be very
dark.
The smell of the wine is
referred to as its "nose" and is
the next step in evaluating a
wine. Some whites have very
little smell, while others smell
like a bed of roses. I like mine
somewhere in between. Reds

typically have a strong, musty
odor.
The entire process so far —
evaluating the appearance and
nose — takes about 30 seconds.
The next step is to taste the
wine. Everyone knows what
they like, so there are no tips I
can offer for this stage.
In general, however, people
just starting to develop an ap
preciation of wine tend to like
sweeter white wines and
gradually learn to like dry
whites and full-bodied reds.
After drinking the wine, one
should consider the aftertaste.
Does a pleasant flavor linger or
is there the irresistible urge to
pucker? The meaning of each
should be clear.
Almost all wineries offer free
wine tasting. Only a few re
quire the purchase of a glass,
usually $l-$3.
Probably the best approach to
an afternoon of tasting is to find
one or two wines that seem
pleasing and consistently try
those types at each winery.
Even if a winery isn't serving

those wines, ask for them
anyway — it is my experience
that they will probably serve
them to you. This way you can,
by the end of a day, be able to
distinguish differences in each
winery's creation.
As might be expected, food
and lodging in Napa Valley are
both plentiful and expensive.
For those on a budget, taking
bread, cheese and cold cuts to
the picnic grounds at most
wineries is a good idea.
Those planning to spend the
night should call ahead to make
reservations. Summer is the
peak tourist season, so planning
is necessary.
To get to Napa, take Highway
101 to the Dumbarton Bridge
and head north on Interstate
880, which becomes Interstate
80. 1-80 intersects Highway 29,
the main Napa thoroughfare.
There are a lot of wineries
worth visiting right on High
way 29 north of Oakville. The
beauty of the drive through
Napa Valley and the free wine
tasting will make the trip well
worth the effort.
