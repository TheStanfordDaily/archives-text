â–  A look at Stanford athletes around the world

McKeever's knee
is progressing well
Although Barry McKeever
won't be ready to play in the
Cardinal's opening football
game on Sept. 5, the knee he
injured this spring is recovering
well.
That's good news for the
Washington Huskies, Stan
ford's first opponent, and for the
faithful down on the Farm who
know how important a healthy
McKeever is.
The junior inside linebacker
will attempt to fill the leader
ship role vacated by his close
friend David Wyman, who is
now playing for the Seattle
Seahawks in the NFL. If he can
come back strong the Cardinal
may very well find itself in a
bowl game for the second
straight year.
The incoming freshmen

recruited to help McKeever and
his teammates are slated to
arrive here Aug. 11 and the rest
of the team is due Aug. 15.
Sprague is truly a
Pan American man
Junior Ed Sprague helped
lead the Cardinal baseball team
to a win in this year's College
World Series (CWS) in Omaha,
Neb. Now the star third
baseman is in Havana, Cuba
hoping to earn a spot on the
roster for the Pan American
games, which will begin Aug. 8
in Indianapolis.
If Sprague makes the Pan Am
squad he has an excellent
chance of joining the U.S Olym
pic team in Seoul, South Korea,
next year. His chances will im
prove if Coach Mark Marquess
is chosen to lead the U.S. team,
a move that seems likely in

light of his superb career record
and this year's CWS champion
ship.
Marquess' teams have made
it to the NCAA regionals seven
straight times and reached the
CWS four of the last six years.
Sprague's team is in the
midst of a five-game exhibition
against the Cuban national
team. The Cubans have already
captured the first two games by
scores of 7-3 and 7-6.

Wright is named to
Pac-10 all-star team
For the fourth time in five
years the Pacific 10 Conference
will send an all-star men's bas
ketball team overseas. This
year, their destination is Eng
land.
Each Pac-10 school has one
player on the team. Stanford's
representative is junior Howard
Wright, the 6-foot-8-inch center
who led the Cardinal in
rebounds last year, averaging
6.8 per game. Wright also
scored 11.2 points per game and
shot 50.5 percent from the floor.
The team will play six games
over a 12-day period starting
with a contest against the Eng
lish national team on Aug. 12.
They will then meet five club
teams before returning home on
Aug. 23.
Swimmers star at
University Games
Stanford swimmers brought
home one individual and two
team gold medals from the

World University Games held
last week in Zagreb, Yugo
slavia.
Junior Jay Mortenson was on
the 400-meter medley relay
team that finished first with a
time of 3:45.72. He also took
third place in the 100-meter
backstroke, finishing in 57.44.
Senior Anthony Mosse
captured the gold in the 200-
meter butterfly in 2:00.20. He
finished seventh in the 200-
meter freestyle with a time of
1:53.85.
Junior Aimee Berzins swam
for the first place 400-meter
medley relay team. The team
won the race in 4:14.38. In addi
tion, Berzins' time of 57.89 was
good for fifth in the 100-meter
freestyle.
Sophomore Jennifer Pokluda
was fifth in the 100-meter back
stroke, clocking a 1:04.73.
In track and field, Jeff Atkin
son, '86, took eighth in the
1500-meter run. His time was
3:46.73. Pam Dukes, '86, took
seventh in the shot put with a
throw of 57-4%.
