Gene symposium today
Faculty members will discuss scien
tific, ethical and financial aspects of
human genome mapping at a half-day
symposium today at the Medical School.
The symposium, sponsored by Intel
liGenetics, Inc. and BIONET, will be
held from 9 a.m. to 1 p.m. in Fairchild
Auditorium.
The meeting will focus on methods for
creating physical and genetic maps of
the human chromosomes and for decip
hering the exact chemical sequences of
human genes.
Speakers will be Dr. Ronald Davis,
professor of biochemistry, who will talk
about methods for physically mapping
the human chromosomes; Dr. Helen
Donis-Keller of Collaborative Research,
Inc., who will discuss progress in map

ping the human genome with genetic
markers; and Dr. Lloyd Smith of the Cal
ifornia Institute of Technology, who will
describe automated methods for chemi
cally sequencing DNA.
Dr. Paul Berg, professor of bio
chemistry, will lead a panel discussion
on whether science should embark on a
crash program to unravel the human
genome.
Communism fragmented but
growing, Hoover report says
The world communist movement
remains fragmented and decentralized,
but continues to grow both in numbers
and power, according to the Hoover In
stitution's 1987 Yearbook on Interna
tional Communist Affairs.
Edited by Richard Staar, senior fellow

at Hoover, the Yearbook is the only an
nual reference work that offers data on
the organization, policies, activities and
leaders of communist parties' front or
ganizations and Marxist-Leninist move
ments worldwide. It is a major col
laborative project undertaken each year
by the International Studies Program of
Hoover.
Staar said that the world communist
movement has changed dramatically
since Russia became the first
communist-ruled state in 1917. In the
past, communism was directed from
Moscow through a single and centralized
organization, he said. Today the emer
gence of the Chinese Communist Party
and revolutionary movements with dif
ferent national agendas has fundamen
tally changed the situation, he contin
ued.

Hoover research fellow named
to presidential commission
Thomas Henriksen, senior fellow and
associate director of the Hoover Institu
tion, has been named a member of the
President's Commission on White House
Fellowships.
The 24-member commission, chaired
by Hoover senior research fellow James
Stockdale, is composed of senior officials
and leaders from American business,
government, education and the arts.
The White House Fellowship Program
was established in 1964 by President
Lyndon Johnson to give outstanding
young people firsthand experience in
government.
Henriksen succeeds Marilyn Lewis, a
former U.S. congresswoman from Penn
sylvania.
