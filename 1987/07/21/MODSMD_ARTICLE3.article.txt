### KIM SAILOR Staff writer 
Officials from Stanford and San
Mateo County are studying possibili
ties for University property in the
southern part of the county and ex
pect to emerge with a new land-use
plan in about two years.
The 2,600-acre plot of unincor
porated land, situated along both
sides of Interstate 280, includes the
Stanford Linear Accelerator Center,
Jasper Ridge Biological Preserve,
Guernsey Field and Webb Ranch.
Despite contact with San Mateo

County planning commissioners, the
University has no immediate plans
for building in that zone, according to
Charlotte Strem of the University
Planning Office.
"With the adoption of the work
plan, we are starting a negotiation
process with our neighbors to figure
out what designations will be most
widely acceptable," Strem said.
The designations will be disclosed
by the planning commission in an
area plan, expected to be completed in
two years. It will then go to the San
Mateo Board of Supervisors for ap
proval.

The University wants an academic
reserve and open space assignment
similar to the label on its property in
Santa Clara County, Strem said.
Strem said that such a plan would
offer the University the flexibility to
build a research facility or maintain
an open reserve area with no build
ings.
A technical advisory committee
and a policy advisory committee con
sisting of representatives from Ather
ton, Menlo Park, Portola Valley and
Woodside will work with the plan-
