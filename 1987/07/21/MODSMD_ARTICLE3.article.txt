# County will consider land use
## 
### KIM SAILOR Staff writer 
Officials from Stanford and San
Mateo County are studying possibili
ties for University property in the
southern part of the county and ex
pect to emerge with a new land-use
plan in about two years.
The 2,600-acre plot of unincor
porated land, situated along both
sides of Interstate 280, includes the
Stanford Linear Accelerator Center,
Jasper Ridge Biological Preserve,
Guernsey Field and Webb Ranch.
Despite contact with San Mateo

County planning commissioners, the
University has no immediate plans
for building in that zone, according to
Charlotte Strem of the University
Planning Office.
"With the adoption of the work
plan, we are starting a negotiation
process with our neighbors to figure
out what designations will be most
widely acceptable," Strem said.
The designations will be disclosed
by the planning commission in an
area plan, expected to be completed in
two years. It will then go to the San
Mateo Board of Supervisors for ap
proval.

The University wants an academic
reserve and open space assignment
similar to the label on its property in
Santa Clara County, Strem said.
Strem said that such a plan would
offer the University the flexibility to
build a research facility or maintain
an open reserve area with no build
ings.
A technical advisory committee
and a policy advisory committee con
sisting of representatives from Ather
ton, Menlo Park, Portola Valley and
Woodside will work with the plan-
ning commission to reach
agreements on key issues.
Strem said community mem
bers' concerns are mainly envi
ronmental, noting that since I
-280 is a scenic corridor "the
main issue will probably be one
of aesthetics.
"People in the surrounding
communities (Atherton, Menlo
Park, Portola Valley, Woodside)
want nothing less than to see
that open space disappear
around them," Strem said.
According to a draft work pro
gram adopted by the commis
sion, Jasper Ridge is one of the
country's outstanding resources
for the study of sensitive biolog
ical communities, and the im
pact of surrounding develop
ment will be critical for that
area.
The risk of hazardous wastes
from SLAC, proximity of the
San Andreas fault line and the
effects of traffic and density in
creases are other items that will
demand attention, according
the work program draft.
The commission has review
authority and final jurisdiction
over Stanford in building deci
sions, according to Strem.
Before construction is allowed,
the University must first get a
permit from San Mateo County.
Stanford recently met such
an accord with Santa Clara
County and is currently begin
ning work on a Westin hotel, to
be located on University prop
erty at 1-280 and Sand Hill
Road.
