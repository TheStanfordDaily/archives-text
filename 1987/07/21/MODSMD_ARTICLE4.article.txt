# University officially joins suit
## 
### LIZ LEMPERT Staff writer 
Stanford won a motion yesterday in Santa
Clara County Superior Court to join a suit chal
lenging the NCAA drug-testing program.
The University will be seeking an order clear
ing it of responsibility for testing athletes until
the court hands down a decision on the legality of
the NCAA guidelines, which may take two or
more years. If the University's request is
granted, Stanford athletes will not be required to
sign drug-testing consent forms while the case is
pending.
The action taken by the University stems from
a March ruling in which county Superior Court
Judge Peter Stone granted diver Simone LeVant
a preliminary injuction allowing her to compete
without undergoing drug testing while the case
is being tried.
As a rule of thumb, when a court issues a pre
liminary injuction, it indicates that the plaintiff
is likely to win in the end, according to John
Schwartz, vice president and general counsel.
Jennifer Hill, co-captain of the women's soccer
team, joined the suit as an additional plaintiff in
February. A motion was made yesterday to add
football player Barry McKeever to the case. A de
cision on McKeever's entrance is expected at the
end of the week, Hill said yesterday.
LeVant argued that the program was degrad
ing and invaded her right to privacy under the
California Constitution. However, because
LeVant was a senior and her college athletic
career ended spring quarter, the injuction was
dissolved by agreement on May 11. Hill, a senior
next year, will continue with the case.
The NCAA rule requires all athletes to sign a
consent form in order to play during the regular
season, although drug testing applies only to
those qualifying for bowl games or other post
season competition.
Drug testing "is likely to be illegal," Schwartz
said. "Stanford voted against it. It's not our pro
gram, and we don't want anything to do with it."
According to Law Prof. Jack Friedenthal, the
NCAA threatens to penalize a school whose stu
dents sue and lose to the association. If a school
allows such a student to compete, the NCAA may
penalize it for using an ineligible player.
The NCAA "wants it hanging over our heads,"
Friedenthal said. "They want us to feel that if we
use those students, we're dead.
"We just want an order that says if we use
[players involved in the law
suit] we can't be punished. We
should not be an unwitting in
strument," he added.
According to Schwartz, the
NCAA argued that Stanford
can't join the case because the
University waited too long and

because the suit involved issues
solely between the students and
the association.
The NCAA believes Stan
ford's involvement would com
plicate the case, broadening the
inquiry to cover all sports,
Schwartz said. NCAA officials
were unavailable for comment
yesterday.
San Francisco attorney Bob
Van Nest, one of the lawyers
representing LeVant and Hill,
welcomed the University's

"participation and vigorous ad
vocacy in the lawsuit.
"Their presence could poten
tially have an impact on the
case, although I am not sure
what their exact role will be,"
he added.
"In a way we have taken a
side," Schwartz said. "Stanford
does think [drug testing] is un
lawful, but we're quick to add
(it's) because of the court's pre
vious ruling (allowing a prelim
inary injunction for LeVant)."
