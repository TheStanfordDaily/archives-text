# Campus Drive parking structure to open this week
## 
### A.J. THOMAS Editorial staff 
Students and University
employees will get some relief
from campus parking conges
tion when the University's first
multi-level parking structure
opens this week and construc
tion begins on a second.
Dennis Perkinson, managing
director of transportation pro
grams, said yesterday he ex
pected Parking Structure I, lo
cated at the intersection of
Campus Drive West and Roth
Way, to open Wednesday or
Thursday. The $9.4 million
building will provide 1,050
spaces and will be marked for
"A" or "C" parking permits.
Perkinson called the five
level, sandstone-colored struc
ture "the largest single incre
ment of parking that Stanford
has ever built."
It is designed to alleviate

pressure on crowded Medical
Center parking lots, he said.
In addition, Perkinson said
workers will break ground
within the next few days on
Parking Structure 11, located
across from the Roble tennis
courts and adjacent to Forsythe
Hall.
That building, which will
contain 750 spaces and cost an
estimated $8.7 million, is sched
uled to be completed by the fall
of 1988, Perkinson said.
The six-level structure, which
will provide parking for Jordan
Quad and the Near West
Campus, will have entrances on
Panama Street and Via Ortega.
One-and-a-half levels will be
underground and, like Parking
Structure I, each level will be
set back from the one below in a
terraced design to make the
building appear less massive.

Work will begin on Parking Structure II this week. It is scheduled to be completed in the fall of 1988.
For about two weeks, only the
lower decks of the first
structure will be open while
workmen finish construction on
the upper levels, according to
project manager Jonathan
Ryan.
When all the work is com
pleted, cars will be able to enter
the building from Campus
Drive West at Quarry Road and
from Roth Way. Until then,
only the Roth Way entrance
will be open.
Perkinson said he was not
sure exactly when the structure
will open because it must still
be looked at by two county in
spectors and the fire marshal.
He said completing the parking
garage was "kind of like a
steamship arrival â€” you know
the week but not the exact day".
Planning for the stucture
began four years ago, and con
struction has been going on
since January 1986, he said.
Because Parking Structure II
will be built on an existing lot,

the Roble tennis courts across
the street will be converted into
a temporary parking lot start
ing at the end of August.
Perkinson said new courts will
be built across Campus Drive
near Electioneer Road and
should be available for use in
September.
For the two or three weeks
between the closing of the For
sythe Hall lot and the opening
of the tennis court lot, Perkin
son suggested that Jordan Quad
employees park at the new
Stock Farm Road lot across
Campus Drive from Ventura
Hall.
According to Perkinson,
safety was a major considera
tion in designing both build
ings. Each will be completely
lighted, will have glass-backed

elevators and open stairwells to
increase visibility and will con
tain emergency switch boxes
wired to an internal alarm sys
tem.
Because so much parking will
be concentrated in one place, "it
will be easier for public safety
people to cover it more in
tensely," according to Perkin
son.
Perkinson said parking pres
sures in the next decade will re
quire the construction of more
parking lots and garages to pro
vide an additional 2,400 spaces.
"We'll barely have the second
one in the ground and we'll be
planning for more," Perkinson
said. "We'll follow it (the plan
ning) right on out to the year
2000 at least."
