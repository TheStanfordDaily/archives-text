# Campus Drive parking structure to open this week
## 
### A.J. THOMAS Editorial staff 
Students and University
employees will get some relief
from campus parking conges
tion when the University's first
multi-level parking structure
opens this week and construc
tion begins on a second.
Dennis Perkinson, managing
director of transportation pro
grams, said yesterday he ex
pected Parking Structure I, lo
cated at the intersection of
Campus Drive West and Roth
Way, to open Wednesday or
Thursday. The $9.4 million
building will provide 1,050
spaces and will be marked for
"A" or "C" parking permits.
Perkinson called the five
level, sandstone-colored struc
ture "the largest single incre
ment of parking that Stanford
has ever built."
It is designed to alleviate

pressure on crowded Medical
Center parking lots, he said.
In addition, Perkinson said
workers will break ground
within the next few days on
Parking Structure 11, located
across from the Roble tennis
courts and adjacent to Forsythe
Hall.
That building, which will
contain 750 spaces and cost an
estimated $8.7 million, is sched
uled to be completed by the fall
of 1988, Perkinson said.
The six-level structure, which
will provide parking for Jordan
Quad and the Near West
Campus, will have entrances on
Panama Street and Via Ortega.
One-and-a-half levels will be
underground and, like Parking
Structure I, each level will be
set back from the one below in a
terraced design to make the
building appear less massive.
