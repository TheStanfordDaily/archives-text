U.N. calls for Iran-Iraq cease-fire
UNITED NATIONS — In a rare show of unanimity, the
15 members of the United Nations Security Council voted
yesterday for a mandatory cease-fire in the almost seven
year-old war between Iraq and Iran.
Secretary of State George Shultz said he is "delighted" with
the action, and although Iran boycotted the session and has
indicated repeatedly in recent days that it would ignore any
U.N. action, Shultz cautioned against "snap judgments" on
what the Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini's government would
do.
Iran's delegate to the United Nations, Said Rajaie-
Khorassani, came to the office of Secretary General Javier
Perez de Cuellar later, however, to receive an official copy of
the resolution. Pursued to the basement garage of the U.N.
headquarters building by shouting reporters, the Iranian said
that he would comment on his government's view at a news
conference today.
Yesterday's session was unusual in that all five permanent
members of the council — the United States, the Soviet Un
ion, Britain, France and China — joined in sponsoring the
resolution, placing the United States and the Soviet Union in
the rare position of being on the same side of an issue.
Chun's party drafts new constitution
SEOUL, South Korea — President Chun Doo Hwan's
ruling party completed a proposed draft of a new national
constitution yesterday that would bar opposition leader Kim
Dae Jung from running for president later this year.
Leaders of the two parties are expected to begin negotiating
later this week on a final version of a new national constitu
tion that Chun has vowed will usher in a new age of
democracy in South Korea.
Kim, the bitterest political foe of Chun, was given back his
civil rights, released from house arrest and granted amnesty
for charges that he tried to overthrow the government, as
part of the reform process that began last month.
Included in the ruling party's constitutional draft is a
provision currently in the South Korean charter that requires
presidential candidates to have resided in the country contin
uously for the past five years.
The clause would disqualify the 63-year-old Kim, who
returned to Seoul in late 1984 after two years of medical
treatment and self-imposed exile in the United States.
North, Poindexter pardons unlikely
WASHINGTON — White House officials yesterday said a
pre-emptive presidential pardon for former national security
adviser John Poindexter or fired national security aide Lt.
Col. Oliver North is not being considered or discussed, but
they would not rule out such action by President Reagan if
either former aide is tried and convicted.
At the invitation of White House chief of staff Howard
Baker Jr., White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater raised
the issue with Reagan yesterday as the first item of business
during the president's weekly "issues lunch."
Fitzwater said he had told reporters at a morning briefing
that "there hadn't been any discussion in the White House" of
a pardon.
"That's true," Fitzwater quoted Reagan as replying. "It
hasn't been discussed, and I don't want to comment on it."
When a reporter during the briefing observed that
Fitzwater was not "slamming the door" on an eventual par
don of Poindexter or North, the spokesman replied, to
laughter, "I'm not touching the door. I wouldn't go within 40
yards of that door."
Discounting the possibility of any pre-emptive pardon,
White House officials said Reagan had called for the appoint
ment of the independent counsel who is conducting the crimi
nal investigation of the Iran-contra affair and would not now
short-circuit that process.
Democrats: Economy is key issue
CLEVELAND — With a year to go until their national
convention, Democratic state party chairmen say that the
Iran-contra affair has helped to "level the playing field" for
the 1988 presidential race, but that their candidates will be
better off focusing on a growing apprehensiveness among
voters about the nation's economic future.
Most say they doubt that "rule of law" and "decency in gov
ernment" campaign appeals will retain a strong grip on the
electorate's attention once the Iran-contra hearings fade from
the television screen. Those appeals were pivotal in Jimmy
Carter's win in the post-Watergate election of 1976.
"Nobody is going to carry Ohio talking about Iran-contra,"
said James Ruvolo, Ohio Democratic chairman and host to
last weekend's meeting of the Association of State Demo
cratic Chairs. "There will be 10 other issues before the first
vote is cast in 1988 that will be more important. Jobs will be
No. 1 and education will be No. 2, and everything else will be
10."
