### 
WASHINGTON — Former
national security adviser John
Poindexter, taking a more
defiant tack than President
Reagan, told the congressional
investigating committees yes
terday that he has no regrets
and makes no apologies for any
aspect of his role in the Iran
contra affair.
In addition, Poindexter,
whose testimony is expected to
conclude today, staunchly
denied the suggestion of a
leading Republican Senate com
mittee member that the presi
dent's credibility has been
damaged by the Iran-contra af
fair.
"I think the president is going
to come out better for it," Poin
dexter asserted.
The normally mild-mannered
naval admiral angrily summed
up his general attitude toward

the affair after Sen. Paul Trible,
R-Va., accused him of an
"unapologetic embrace of un
truth."
"I don't have any regrets for
anything I did," Poindexter in
sisted. "I think the actions that
I took were in the long-term in
terests of the country and I'm
not going to change my mind
and I'm not going to be apolo
getic about it."
His unrepentent, hard-line
approach stunned many mem
bers of the committees because
it went far beyond the position
taken by the White House or by
Reagan's other supporters.
Even the committees' most
conservative members, such as
Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, have
said that Poindexter and other
administration officials made
mistakes in the Iran-contra af
fair. Reagan himself acknowl

edged in his State of the Union
speech on Jan. 27 that he
regrets "mistakes were made."
Sen. David Boren, D-Okla.,
chairman of the Senate Intelli
gence Committee, said that he
hoped Poindexter would even
tually see that he had made a
mistake by deciding to divert
funds from the Iranian arms
sales to the Nicaraguan resis
tance without informing
Reagan.
"It really did surprise me
when you said: 'I have no
regrets,' " Boren said, "because
it seems to me that well
intentioned as you might have
been at the time, it's very clear
that this decision was ... a
highly controversial decision.
It's been the flashpoint of the
whole inquiry."
