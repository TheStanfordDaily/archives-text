# Briefly
## 
### 
One step forward and two
steps back at The Daily tonight.
It's twenty of two and the
flats are still on the table. And,
tonight we were going to come
in at least two minutes before
midnight.

Two system crashes were
coupled with the disappearance
of the front page for two hours.
It's really too bad.
And, then, as if out of a
nightmare the "Briefly" was too
short. Can you believe it two
"Brieflys"? '
