As the Iran-contra hearings in Congress turned into a
media spectacle last week, a remarkable change took place in
public opinion. If the polls are to be believed, Lt. Col. Oliver
North went from being an irresponsible official to being a na
tional hero in the eyes of most Americans. How did it happen?
How did North, a key player in the scandal and an admitted
liar, become a national hero?
Obviously there is no simple answer to this question. North
must be commended for being poised and articulate under fire
— even if he had the luxury of being less precise than his con
gressional questioners.
However, the source that was most responsible for North's
metamorphosis was television. A much discussed issue of our
time is the impact the visual media have made on politics.
Television has added a personal immediateness between
the public and office-holders, but has placed an enormous em
phasis on looks and image. The effect has been largely a dis
tortion of priorities — what people say is less important than
how they look when they say it.
This was particularly the case during the hearings. The un
ending and tedious visual attention given over to the investi
gation caused a funny thing to happen. As the week of tes
timony unfolded, North's statements lost their impact as they
blurred together.
What remains behind from the week of media blitzkreig?
Just some general images of the proceedings: North's sharp
figure, clean cut in a uniform bedecked with medals, contrast
ing with the disorganized appearance of the legislators as
sembled to question him.
The emphatically sincere-looking North swearing with
drama that he was telling the truth — even as he admitted
past lies to Congress.
The cynical legislators peering down at North, repeating
questions his attorney, Brendon Sullivan, insisted North had
answered 120 times before — that trivial little matter of
shredding documents.
It is tragic that North, a man deeply involved in a plot to
deceive Congress, a zealot who was determined to supply the
contras when both Congress and the majority of the Ameri
can people were against the idea, is able to shine under the
spotlight of television while someone like Daniel Inouye, D-
Hawaii, a careful, thoughtful man and a dedicated public ser
vant, appears bumbling and receives a series of letters full of
racial slurs.
What can be done to avert injustices like this one in the fu
ture? Very little. Banning the visual media is certainly not
an acceptable answer to anyone. The role of image in politics
is certainly not an issue that suffers from lack of analysis. It
is a problem without a solution. Not much can be said about
the result except: Ain't it a shame.
