Emotional problems in
children studied
Contrary to popular belief,
young boys are more likely to
have emotional problems than
young girls, according to a
recent study by psychologists
at Stanford, Princeton and the
University of Pennsylvania.
Susan Nolen-Hoeksema of
Stanford, Joan Girgus of
Princeton and Martin
Seligman of the University of
Pennsylvania surveyed
elementary school children
over a two-year period and
concluded that prepubescent
boys are more likely to have
low self-esteem and self
confidence than girls the same
age.
The psychologists were
initially interested in why
adult women are twice as
likely as men to suffer
depression. One explanation,
the "learned helplessness
theory," says that females
tend to blame themselves for
bad events and to explain
good events by causes that are
external to them.
To test the idea, the
psychlogists asked 352 third

graders in New Jersey to
complete questionnaires on
their feelings about
depression, social status and
significant events in their
lives.
"That we found some
tendency for boys to report
more depression than the girls
runs counter to the robust
data showing a much greater
propensity to depression in
adult women than in men,"
the study concludes. It found
that boys whose parents were
recently separated or divorced
were particularly likely to be
depressed.
"The fascinating possibility
in our study is that as we
track our children through
puberty, we may see a switch
in the sex differences in
depression, such that girls
come to show more depression
than the the boys," the study
continues.
Nolen-Hoeksema, Girgus
and Seligman presented their
findings last April at a
meeting of the Eastern Psych
ological Association in
Arlington, Va.

Work on new parking
structure begins today
Workers yesterday began
fencing off the site of the
University's second multi
level parking garage, on
Panama Street near Forsythe
Hall. Construction is
scheduled to begin today and
will take approximately 15
months to finish, according to
Dennis Perkinson, managing
director of transportation
programs.
A section of the University's
first multi-level parking
structure opened Wednesday.
The lower level of Parking
Structure I, located at the
corner of Campus Drive West
and Roth Way, provided 100
parking spaces.
It will be two or three weeks
before the rest of the five
level, $9.4 million building is
open, Perkinson said. The
structure holds spaces for
more than 1,000 cars.
Parking Structure II will
cost an estimated $8.7 million
and will provide 750 spaces.
The six-level garage will have
entrances on Panama Street
and Via Ortega.
