## The 						Stanford daily An Independent Newspaper Meyer privileges 
### 
Meyer Library has ended its 20-year-old tradition of admit
ting everyone. Now only Stanford students, faculty, staff and
their families, and those who purchase privileges, have
access to the library.
Although those affiliated with Stanford will experience
some minor inconvenience because they will have to show
identification to get in, the decision makes sense.
The main problem with unrestricted entrance was that
some people practiced unacademic and unacceptable behav
ior in the library. In recent years the reports of indecent ex
posure in Meyer have increased. Of those apprehended, 80
percent were not affiliated with the University. The entrance
restriction policy will help prevent these disturbances.
The other problem with allowing unrestricted access into
Meyer was that library staff time was being monopolized by
non-Stanford visitors. The staff at a university library should
be able to spend time with to those who pay to attend the
school: the students. The University ought to be sympathetic
to community needs, but there is a limit to that sympathy.
Some opponents to restricted access claim that universities
ought to be open environments. But this is not a compelling
reason for students or alumni to subsidize a library for the
general public.
Subsidizing libraries is a government responsibility. There
are six city libraries in Palo Alto, two in Menlo Park, three in
Redwood City, one library in Atherton, one in East Palo Alto
and one in Woodside. Meyer is clearly not the area's only
resource.
But those displaced by the policy change who don't want to
use the other local libraries can still obtain privileges at
Meyer.
The privilege policy is fairly generous. A person can gain
entrance from one to seven days simply by showing a valid
driver's license. After the seventh day, library access costs $2
a day for alumni and $5 a day for non-affiliated patrons. Per
quarter the charges are $40 and $80 respectively, and per
year $100 and $200. Except for freshmen, all graduate and
undergraduate students pay the same as alumni when not
enrolled in classes.
Now the costly part. Book borrowing privileges — which
include access — are $120 for alumni and $200 for non
afTiliates quarterly, and $300 and $500 annually.
These privilege costs are rather exorbitant for the services
offered. Students stopping out for a quarter, but remaining
on campus, should not have to pay $120 to check out books.
Meyer should reduce these charges.
In the meantime, Meyer is making a conscientious effort to
alert the community of the policy change. Recently the li
brary has mailed notifications to local schools, businesses
and other organizations that regularly use Meyer.
The library kept its doors open to the public for a long time.
Now, access will simply be restricted to those who need it
most. The decision is a reasonable one, and the Stanford com
munity should endure the inconveniences.
