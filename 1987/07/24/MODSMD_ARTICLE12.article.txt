I remember attending a political fund
raiser in my hometown in Texas a few years
ago. The candidate drew the attention of
the gathered faithful to the bumper stickers
that were being distributed among them.
He claimed that bumper stickers were, dol
lar for dollar, the most cost-effective form of
political advertising available. He went so
far as to say that a single bumper sticker
would reach as many people as $50,000
worth of television advertising.

Since that time, bumper stickers have
naturally been objects of some fascination
to me. I have found, though, that the more
provocative ones have nothing to do with
candidates. There's a real limit, after all, to
how enthusiastic you can be about
"Bernard Goetz for Sheriff' or "Sally Saline
for Water Control Board."
The best subject matter for bumper stick
ers is the pithy little slogans that are the
lifeblood of American politics. Everyone
from lunatic left to radical right has them,
and all display them proudly on their cars'
available chrome.
Bumper stickers show the political pedi

gree of people with the morbid longing to
have their political causes follow them
wherever they go. They are also an extraor
dinarily safe way to express a political
opinion. People are unlikely to challenge
your views on Central America while
waiting for the traffic light to change.
Fashion plays a large part in bumper
sticker politics. Having the right bumper
sticker is somewhat comparable to having
the right kind of handbag, car or watch.
I'm reminded of a red Honda scooter
which I have observed around campus. It
displays the popular "Abolish Apartheid"
bumper sticker. You can't help but notice
that the red in the flag of the African Na
tional Congress picks up perfectly the
matching plastic backdrop of the scooter's
body. I'm not sure if it's supposed to be a po
litical statement or a fashion statement. I
suppose that the point to be made is that it
is intended to be both.
Now, don't misunderstand me. I don't ab
hor bumper-sticker politics. It's too
amusing a subject to be truly abhorrent. I
must admit, though, that I've always
wanted to get in my two bits' worth in
response to the most egregious examples of
this pop political phenomenon. So, for all
the times that I've been sitting at an inter
section, minding my own business, only to
be assailed by the inane simplicity of
bumper-sticker politics, here is my revenge,
the commentary that the bumper-sticker
politicos have always been shielded from:
• "Envision World Peace": Give me a break.

Let's start a little closer to home. How
about, "Envision not locking your door at
night."
• "Another Student for Reagan-Bush": An
other student whose parents benefitted
from the tax cut.
• "No Vietnam in Central America": A self
evident geographic fact (yes, indeed, there
is no Vietnam in Central America)
combines with a bastardized historical
analogy to produce an astonishingly
popular bumper sticker.
• "You Can't Hug Your Kids With Nuclear
Arms": Yes, but we would be hard-pressed
to deter the Soviets with your kids.
• "One Nuclear Bomb Can Ruin Your
Whole Day": One asinine bumper sticker,
on the other hand, can make you want to
slash someone's tires.
• "Peace Through Strength": Peace
through the threatened annihilation of
every living creature on the planet. Mess
with us and we'll kick some ass.
• "Mondale-Ferraro in '84 for Peace and
Jobs in '85": A faded bumper sticker, barely
legible in '87. Enough said.
• "Peace in Nicaragua" and "Peace in El
Salvador": Respectively, stop sending arms
to the contras and start sending arms to the
Salvadoran rebels.
I can say with some pride that I don't
have a single bumper sticker. I don't own a
car either, but that's beside the point.
