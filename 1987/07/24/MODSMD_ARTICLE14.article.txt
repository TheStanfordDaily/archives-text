Pay for medical
research too low
The competitiveness of medi
cal schools today has put pre
medical students in a situation
where they must do work
outside of academics, com
monly in research fields, in
order to have a solid applica
tion.
The problem is that this ex
tra work is done for little or no
compensation. Because such a
commitment requires substan
tial monetary sacrifice, it
proliferates the inequality
among economic classes in
medicine.
I like to call it "slave labor,"
since my experience has been
that one should not expect to be
paid for one's first research
position no matter what back
breaking labor it might entail.
The competition for important
spots in research is such that
there are enough students who
can and will work for nothing.
One is thus enslaved by one's
own desire to remain competi
tive.
Obviously, in such a system
the poor students are at a dis
advantage. In fact, the entire
process is skewed in favor of
those with substantial means.
For example, preparatory
courses for the MCAT are quite
expensive but have become
invaluable (to those who can

afford them) by offering re
sources unavailable to a stu
dent studying on his own.
I do not claim to be the
champion of the poor in
medicine, but I see a moral
cause for a reform that will
benefit everyone equally. I
propose that no students work
in research for anything less
than minimum wage. By offer
ing reasonable pecuniary com
pensation for everyone, the
positions can be filled in order
of qualifications rather than
economic status.
My research experience was
some of the most rewarding
work of my college career. It is
a shame to think that it would
not have been possible without
extensive support.

Right-wing Bork
judged dangerous
President Reagan recently
nominated appellate Judge
Robert Bork to replace the
retiring Justice Lewis Powell
Jr. on the U.S. Supreme Court.
Future Supreme Court deci
sions, especially those bearing
on citizens' rights to privacy,
hang on the selection of
Powell's replacement.
An additional conservative
judge is expected to swing the

court to the right on future
civil rights decisions.
As reported in the San Jose
Mercury News, Bork "has
denounced as unconstitutional
the 1973 Supreme Court ruling
legalizing abortion" in his deci
sion in Hartigan v. Zbaraz. In
another case, Bork held that
"the Constitution provides no
protection for private, consen
sual homosexual conduct."
In his 1971 article in the
Indiana Law Journal, Bork
states that "constitutional
protection should be accorded
only to speech that is explicitly
political. There is no basis for
judicial intervention to protect
any other form of expression,
be it scientific, literary or that
variety of expression we call
obscene or pornographic."
The Stanford Women's Cen
ter and the Stanford Organiza
tion for Lesbian and Gay
Equality (SOLGE) are strongly
opposed to a Senate confirma
tion of Bork. We believe the
appointment of an ultra
conservative such as Bork will
erode the hard-won gains made
in civil rights since the 19505.
We ask all concerned people
to urge Sens. Alan Cranston
and Pete Wilson to vote to deny
confirmation of Bork and to
support a more moderate candi
date for this seat on the Su
preme Court.
