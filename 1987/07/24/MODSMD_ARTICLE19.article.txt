## Palo Alto police raided The Daily Police Chief Zurcher leaves search legacy 
### BRIAN RHOADS Staff writer 
This is the first in a two-part series on the police raid of
The Daily in 1971. The follow-up will appear Tuesday.
On July 14 Palo Alto Police Chief James Zurcher
retired, leaving behind a controversial legacy.
Sixteen years ago, during an era of general student
unrest, Zurcher's department conducted a raid on The
Daily that has since affected police behavior
nationwide. It was the first police search of an Ameri
can newspaper office, and a resulting lawsuit went all
the way to the U.S. Supreme Court. The High Court's
ruling has allowed searches of non-suspect third par
ties to become routine.

Zurcher's retirement prompted a June letter in the
Peninsula Times Tribune from Bob Byers of Stanford's
News and Publications, who took the occasion to ex
press his disagreement with the ''unnecessary" 1971
search and the effect of the subsequent case on legal be
havior throughout the country.
What are the origins of Zurcher's legacy?
Stanford Hospital demonstration:
On April 8, 1971, a coalition of students protested the
firing of a black Stanford Hospital custodian, Sam
Bridges. They later staged a 30-hour sit-in at the hospi
tal after officials refused their demand that Bridges be
rehired.
After 30 hours hospital officials called in police to
break up the sit-in, which was disrupting the hospital's
patient care. Sixty-five Palo Alto police officers and 110
sheriff's deputies were dispatched to clear out the day
old demonstration.
The task proved very difficult. Police failed twice to
clear a barricade that students had built at the west
end doors of a hospital corridor. Later, police sprayed a

mace equivalent into the corridor, which was swept
back at them by demonstrators brandishing a fire hose.
Finally, though, police succeeded in loosening one of
the west-end doors and began to remove the barricade.
Daily photographer Bill Cooke was there when the
police gained entry, and his pictures were featured in a
special edition of The Daily two days later.
As the west-end barricade was being broken down,
demonstrators began to escape from the east end,
where only nine policemen were posted. The students
overwhelmed the small force. One police officer was
knocked to the ground and beaten with sticks; another
officer suffered a broken shoulder.
As a result of this riot, 23 persons were arrested and
almost 40 protesters and police were injured.
The search:
According to Zurcher, it was the police department's
understanding shortly after the riot that a Daily pho
tographer had been taking pictures of the east-end riot.
Seeing Cooke's photos from the west end in The Daily
two days later confirmed police suspicions, and led
them to consider searching The Daily for the east-end
photos.
Palo Alto police officers discussed subpoening the
photos with Craig Brown, Santa Clara assistant dis
trict attorney. But because of The Daily's protective
photo policy, pro-demonstration ideology and previous
reluctance on the part of the staff to respond to sub
poenas, the police deemed a search warrant necessary
to obtain the pictures.
Part of The Daily's photo policy, stated in a February
1970 editorial, read: "Negatives which may be used to
convict protestors will be destroyed."
According to Byers, this policy was adopted following
the harassment of Daily photographers during other
campus demonstrations. The policy, Byers said, was
twofold: "One, they would run pictures based on their
own news judgement, whether incriminating or not,
and two, they would not maintain photo files which
could be obtained at some later date by outside groups."
This policy was similar to that of the Palo Alto Times
and other area newspapers, which was simply to
destroy unused pictures.
The police obtained a warrant from Palo Alto
Municipal Judge J. Barton Phelps, authorizing a
search for "negatives and photographs . . . evidence

material and relevant to the perpetration of felonies, to
wit, battery on a police officer, and assault with a
deadly weapon."
On April 12, 1971, without notice, four Palo Alto
police officers entered The Daily newsroom and
searched through photo files, desks, cabinets,
mailboxes and shelves before leaving empty-handed.
According to Byers, the irony of the search is that it
"was totally unnecessary." The Daily never had the in
criminating photos.
"I personally informed Zurcher," Byers said, "that
the only photos of this event (the east-end corridor riot)
had been taken by a Stanford Police photographer
named Nick Bruno. As news director I made sure that
Bruno's pictures were made available as promptly as
possible to news media," Byers said. Bruno's pictures
contained all the evidence that police needed.



Daily/File
A police detective examines negatives during a raid of
the desks and files in The Daily's offices. Since the 1971
incident dozens of newsrooms throughout the country
have been raided.
The case:
On May 13, 1971, The Daily
editors filed suit in U.S. District
Court, charging that the search
violated the First, Fourth and
14th Amendments. Named as
defendents in the suit were Zur
cher, the four officers who con
ducted the search, Santa Clara
District Attorney Louis Bergna
and Brown.
On Oct. 25, 1972, U.S. Dis
trict Judge Robert Peckham
ruled in favor of The Daily. He
concluded that third parties not
suspected of a crime are entitled
to greater protection under the
Fourth Amendment's search
and seizure protections than are
suspects.
"Third party searches of a
newspaper office are impermis
sible in all but a very few situa
tions," the judge stated. "A
search warrant should be per
mitted only in the rare circum
stances where there is a clear
showing that one, important
materials will be destroyed or
removed from the jurisdiction,
and two, a restraining order
would be futile," he ruled.
On appeal by Zurcher, the 9th
U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals
unanimously upheld Peckham's
ruling in favor of The Daily.
Finally, on Oct. 3, 1977, fol
lowing a petition from the City
of Palo Alto, the U.S. Supreme
Court announced that it would
review the appellate court deci
sion. It is this High Court deci
sion that set the most recent na
tional precedent for newsroom
search and seizures.
Tuesday's article will consider
the Supreme Court decision and
the legacy it established.
