# Professors disagree over Bork

### A.J. THOMAS Editorial staff 
Stanford scholars disagreed yesterday over the
long-term significance of President Ronald
Reagan's decision to nominate Judge Robert
Bork to the U.S. Supreme Court. However, they
agreed that the looming Senate confirmation bat
tle could be a bitter and drawn out process.
Hubert Marshall, emeritus professor of politi
cal science, called the nomination a "watershed
moment" and added that Reagan could not have
chosen a more controversial figure for the court.
If Reagan succeeds in appointing the
"profoundly conservative" Bork, then Reagan
"would control the Supreme Court for as much as
twenty years," Marshall said.
However, Robert Horn, emeritus professor of
political science, said he believed Bork's nomina
tion "won't make as much difference as his sup
porters hope or his opponents fear."
The 60-year-old Bork, who currently sits on the
United States Court of Appeals for the District of
Columbia, was chosen by Reagan on July 1 to
replace retiring Supreme Court Justice Lewis
Powell.
A committed conservative and advocate of judi
cial restraint, Bork is widely seen as someone

who could cement a conservative majority on the
sharply divided court.
Key Democratic senators, including Judiciary
Committee chairman Sen. Joseph Biden, D-Del.,
have predicted a long fight over the nomination.
Sen. Alan Crantson, D-Cal., said Wednesday he
estimated the Senate was split 45-45 over Bork,
with 10 senators undecided.
According to History Prof. Barton Bernstein,
however, Bork's nomination "is going to be a
hard nomination for people to oppose" because
Bork "can't be faulted on conflict of interest or in
tellectual grounds."
Marshall said that ideological issues would
dominate the debate over Bork.
"Reagan's effort to portray an appointment of
this sort as non-political is only part of the issue,"
Marshall said.
"Every appointment to the Supreme Court has
always been political. It's sort of a myth that the
court is above politics. I think you would have to
hunt back a pretty long time to find a time when
all the liberal organizations immediately lined
up against [a nomination]" he added.
Horn said he was "strongly for" Bork's nomina
tion because of the respect he had acquired for
