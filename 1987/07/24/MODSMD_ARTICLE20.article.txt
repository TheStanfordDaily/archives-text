## 'Temporary' trailers turn 18 this fall 
### DAVID GARDNER SHAHRAM GHOLAMI 
Would you live in Manzanita Park if
your life depended on it? For junior Jerry
Pape, it does. Pape is a diabetic and has a
special diet that he must prepare himself.
Manzanita not only accomodates Pape by
having a spacious kitchen, but it also
gives him apartment-style living near the
heart of campus.
The Manzanita trailers, located across
from Wilbur Hall, were put on campus in
the fall of 1969 to provide housing during
an undergraduate "housing crisis" — a
crisis that continues today. Manzanita
was intended as a temporary (five-year)
solution to the housing crunch until funds
were available for a permanent replace
ment.
Eighteen years later the trailers still
exist. Manzanita has been less popular
than other campus housing. It has become
a last resort for many unguaranteed un
dergraduates and most graduate students
who consider other residences far supe
rior.
Each of the 117 trailers accomodates
three persons and has a large dining area,
kitchen, bathroom and three bedrooms.
The trailers are clustered in groups of
four with one common courtyard per
quad.
Living in Manzanita is not easy. Stu
dents have been known to consider it the
social void on campus. Pape said there are
three main reasons the social life at Man
zanita is abysmal. First, most of Man
zanita's residents are graduate students,
who tend to study more and have less free
time for social activities. Second, there
are no central dining or living facilities,
so people have to go out of their way to
meet other residents. Finally, Manzanita
is secluded by carefully placed trees that
were planted in an effort to conceal the
aesthetic deficiencies of the trailers from
the rest of campus.

The individual trailers have faults as
well. The walls are paper thin and, al
though they provide visual privacy, there
is hardly any audio privacy. The thin
walls also lack enough insulation to keep
out hot and cold weather. The outside of
the trailers are a dismal picture of green
paint and dented sidings.
The grounds are not well-kept. Toilet
paper from months past can be seen in the
formerly pristine trees, according to Pape.
In other residences, such messes would be
cleaned up the day after they were made.
Manzanita resident Joanna Baldy
thinks the trailers should be removed.
"For a University this beautiful and pres
tigious, Manzanita should not exist. It is
the sore thumb of Stanford and does not
conform to the high standards of this fine

institution," she said.
There are obvious inadequacies in
Manzanita, but there are some advan
tages. In Manzanita, you can cook to your
palate's delight, the living conditions are
similar to an apartment's, and the cost of
living may be cheaper than other campus
housing because residents are not re
quired to pay for University Food Service.
Additionally, according to Pape, Man
zanita is an important resource for stu
dents with special needs.
Despite the original intent to remove
the trailers after five years, the Housing
Office continues to use them as regular
University housing. Although the trailers
are due to be carted out in 1990 to make
way for new housing, many students and
faculty bet that Manzanita will be around
much longer.


The Manzanita trailers were established as temporary housing in 1969. Eighteen years
later they display more staying power than some of the University's permanent
structures.
