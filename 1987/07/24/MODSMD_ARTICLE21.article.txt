## Italian restaurant boasts heaps of generosity 
### JOHN LEE Staff writer 
OK. You finally managed to get a date
with that hot guy or gal in your psych
class. Now all you have to do is decide
what you're going to do for dinner. It's
got to be nice, but not overbearing. Most
importantly, it has to be named after
some guy named Vincent. Well look no
further, Cenzo's is the obvious choice to
fulfill your demanding culinary needs.
Cpnzo's is a small family-owned Ital
ian restaurant with unmistakeable class
and charm. The decor adds subtle
elegance to the dining atmosphere and
compliments the meticulously prepared,
authentic Italian dishes.

As my friend and I soon found out, and
as our waiter warned us early on, all of
the dishes at Cenzo's are served in ex
tremely generous portions. He was quick
to suggest that we share a salad and an
entree since they tend to be enough for
two. I have to admit that his suggestion
was an excellent one.
We began by splitting Cenzo's Salad
($4.95) which was the epitome of a busy
antipasta salad. Covered with mush
rooms, salami, ham, two types of beans,
jalapeno peppers and more, Cenzo's
Salad was an excellent way to begin the
meal.
Before I go to far, let me backtrack and
say that Cenzo's actually offers a bread
basket at the beginning of each meal

which is worth mentioning. Though I
was never able to obtain the proper
spelling of their delicate, flaky, crusty
bread, I managed to enjoy it nonetheless.
For the main course, we ordered half
portions of two entrees. The Linguine
Pescadore ($10.95) was a delicious
seafood linguine with clams, mussels,
prawns and scallops. It was tomato
based and, though a little on the spicy
side, made an excellent contrast with
our other entree — the Polio alia Fran
cese ($9.50). This tender breast of
chicken was covered with a pleasant
white sauce and was accompanied by
some vegetables and pasta. Altogether,
it made for a very colorful meal.
Although no desserts actually appear

on the main menu, Cenzo's definitely
does have desserts. We happily managed
to put away two small pieces of rich choc
olate cake. Between the chocolate
mousse cake and the double chocolate
cake, we were chocolated out.
Other items on Cenzo's menu include
gourmet pizzas, veal and non-pasta
seafood dishes. The prices of the entrees
range from between $8-$ 14, which I
found quite reasonable given the quality
of the food and the dining atmosphere.
Cenzo's is not really equipped to han
dle enormous crowds, so it is probably a
good idea to make reservations if you in
tend to come during the rush hour.
Cenzo's is located at 1233 University
Ave. in Palo Alto.
