# Joffrey Ballet ends San Francisco stay in style

### CHRISTINA LEPNIS 
John Cranko's 1962 dance version of "Romeo and
Juliet" blurs any distinction between ballet and
theater. Offering both in equal measure, the lavish,
full-evening production of this classic by the Joffrey
Ballet was a flamboyant conclusion to its fortnight of
performances at the San Francisco Opera House.
The ballet's vigor largely derives from Cranko's at
mospheric staging of street life and vividly turbulent
crowd scenes. The splendidly formal Capulet ball, the
sword fights in the marketplace under a canopy of
hurled fruit, and the animated carnival replete with
gypsies and clowns add to the overall scheme of tension
and rivalry.
The dramatic design emphasizes a brisk progression
of short scenes that gradually develop the two lovers'
romantic predicament. The only awkwardness in the
plot lies in the omission of the epilogue in which the
feuding families end their hostilities. This omission

makes for a rather abrupt and unresolved finish.
The youth of Romeo and Juliet is sensitively mod
ulated in various lyrical yet hesitating duets. By con
trast, the balcony scene with its headstrong passion is
overtly direct and emotional.
The principal roles are authoritatively interpreted

by Cranko, however the dramatic potentials of Mer
cutio and Friar Laurence are not fully explored
choreographically. Mercutio does die a histrionic
death, as outdated as it may be, but his living presence
falls short of the proper charisma.
More imaginative characters include the mime
related King of the Carnival and his attendant jesters.
They perform a delightfully original dance of clever an
tics, delivering some of the evening's most winning mo
ments.
The ingenious sets and brilliantly elaborate costume
design amplify the production's regality and dramatic
scope. The rich gold and earthen tones of the ball are
particularly memorable.
Inevitably, though, the heart of the ballet's potency
and eloquence resides in Prokofiev's sweeping score.
Members of the San Francisco Symphony, under the
superb direction of Allan Lewis, captured the height
and breadth of the music, which is as timeless as
Shakespeare's romantic tragedy.
