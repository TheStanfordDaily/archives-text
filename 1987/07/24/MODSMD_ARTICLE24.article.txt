Tampopo
Aquarius
430 Emerson St., Palo Alto
Ever have a love affair with a bowl of Top
Ramen? Neither have I, but that's exactly
what writer/director Juzo Itami seems to
have created in this hilarious Japanese
comedy.
The movie is about the struggle of a lowly
restauranteur (Nobuko Miyamoto) to
become a true master in the art of noodle
making. She gets help from an unlikely
source — a cowboy truck driver named
Goro (Tsutomu Yamazaki) — who drills
and exercises her relentlessly so she can
square up against the competition.
Much of the action in the film takes place
in the form of short vignettes all relating to
man's obsession with food. There's the gour
met gangster, with whom sex is intimately
(pardon the pun) tied with food, the mad
spinster who pokes and squeezes her way
through the grocery store and the hungry
husband whose appetite kills his ailing
wife.
Dubbed a "noodle western" by its Acad
emy Award winning director, "Tampopo" is
fast-paced and highly entertaining. One
word of advice, though: Be prepared to walk
away from the movie with an intense
craving for Japanese food.

RoboCop ***
Palo Alto Square

Ignore the "RoboCop" advertising cam
paign for just one second, and let me tell
you that this movie is not as bad as it may
look at first glance. On the contrary,

"RoboCop" is a very entertaining, action
packed, politically satirical movie that hap
pens to be about a "cyborg" (Peter Weller of
"Buckaroo Banzai" fame).
Weller plays a police officer named
Murphy who works in Detroit some time in
the future. When Murphy is brutally mur
dered at the beginning of the film, a com
pany called Security Concepts, Inc. takes
what's left of his body and makes it into a
half-human, half-robot, nearly indestruc
tible super-cop.
With that scenario one is prepared to see
a good-guy Terminator movie, but there is
much more to "RoboCop" than there was to
"The Terminator."
The scathing cuts at the future results of
the Reagan administration, and the pure
excitement and action of "RoboCop,"
combine the best that movies like "The Ter

minator," "Repo Man" and "Buckaroo Ban
zai" have to offer.
Neumeier and Miner wrote an innovative
and clever script, though it does not give
the actors a great deal of opportunity to
flesh out anything more than adequate per
formances.
Credit should also go to Dutch director
Paul Verhoeven for his creative directing.
"RoboCop" contains a few grotesquely
graphic scenes of violence, but Verhoeven
manages to make it almost comical in it's
absurdity.
Though I'm not one to advocate running
out and snagging one of the "RoboCop"
dolls that should be coming out in the near
future, I will say that "RoboCop" should
definitely be on your list of movies to see
this summer.

Ken Watanabe is taught the finer points of ramen eating by Ryutaro Otomo in the Japanese
film "Tampopo," now playing at the Aquarius in Palo Alto.
