Daryl Sconiers was thrown out of
baseball in 1985 because he had drug
problems. That very same Daryl
Sconiers has been quietly putting up
solid numbers all season for the San Jose
Bees. Yet, until recently, very few people
had noticed.

Last week in this space, I suggested it
was possible that Sconiers' performance
went unnoticed because he was black. I
pointed out that Steve Howe, a white
player, was allowed several chances to
return to baseball despite an apparent
inability to refrain from drug use.
Whether or not my accusations were
valid is no longer relevant. Tuesday the
Chicago White Sox obtained Sconiers'
contract from the Bees and assigned him
to their Hawaii farm club. They also
guaranteed him a spot on their spring
training roster next year. In other
words, his fate is now in his own hands.
If he plays well he will be in the major
leagues again.
Sconiers has paid his dues for his
checkered past. I wish him all the best in
the future.
The Hawaii team Sconiers will play

for might soon include a player who is
very well known in these parts. When
Stanford star Jack McDowell signs a
contract with the White Sox, he is likely
to be assigned to Hawaii. Sources report
McDowell and the Sox are about $20,000
apart in trying to agree on a contract.
The rest McDowell has gotten since
the College World Series (CWS) has
probably done him a lot of good, but if he
holds out much longer it is unlikely he'll
be able to pitch effectively this year. He
would then have to start next spring in
the minors, without having pitched com
petitively for a long time. That would set
back his timetable for making it to the
big leagues.
Aside from providing a show case for
Stanford talent, the CWS provided more
than its share of anecdotal material. One
of the more enjoyable stories concerns a
couple of players on the Texas Rangers.
Steve Beuchele, the Rangers' third
baseman, is a Stanford alumnus, and
outfielder Pete Incaviglia spent his col
lege days at Oklahoma State. When
their respective alma maters were set to
meet in the CWS final, the two of them
placed a small wager on the outcome.
The loser, so the story goes, would have
to wear a T-shirt from the winner's
school for the rest of the season. I hear
Incaviglia looks great in cardinal.
Incaviglia was one of the outstanding
rookies in the American League last
year. An extraordinary wealth of talent
came to the majors including players

like Cory Snyder, Jose Canseco and
Danny Tartabull. By the end of the year
every pundit in the world of sports had
an opinion on which of these guys would
have the best careers.
Obviously, it's still too early to say for
sure what will become of all these
players but their sophomore seasons pro
vide some interesting information. I
would guess that 10 years down the road
the most successful members of the 1986
class will be Wally Joyner of the Califor
nia Angels and the Rangers' Ruben
Sierra.
As a 20-year-old rookie, Sierra proved
he could hit major league pitching. Then
when he got off to a slow start this year,
many gave him the flash-in-the-pan
label. Well, Sierra is producing once
again, hitting for average and power,
and he's still only 21.
Joyner took the baseball world by
storm last year with his fast start. But
he slowed down dramatically in the
second half. Before this season began,
baseball's most obnoxious number
cruncher, Bill James, predicted mounds
of mediocrity for Joyner.
The Angels first baseman's perform
ance this year has put James and other
doubters to shame. He is hitting for
power and he leads the American
League in RBIs. Plus, he is a fine defen
sive player. California has done the im
possible in replacing Rod Carew with a
player who just might be almost as good.
Obviously, this year's rookie who has

everyone talking is Mark McGwire. The
accolades showered upon this kid are
very well deserved. His home run total is
nothing short of incredible, to be sure,
but, he's also hitting .295. McGwire
doesn't just swing for the fences — he
can hit.
A great deal has been made of the fact
that McGwire has hit more homers than
he ever did in the minors, though, to put
it bluntly, that kind of talk is nonsense.
The reason is that no one really hits
home runs in the minors.
The examples to prove that are too
numerous to list here, but consider a
couple. The Minnesota Twins' Kirby
Puckett hit over 30 home runs last year
— and never hit more than four in the
minors. But the most impressive exam
ple of all is Henry Aaron.
Hammerin' Hank, baseball all-time
home run champion with a career total
of 755, never hit 15 home runs in a
minor league season. No, I'm not kid
ding. So let's not worry that Big Mac has
never hit this many before. Instead, let's
root him on to 60.

pointed out that Steve Howe, a white
player, was allowed several chances to
return to baseball despite an apparent
inability to refrain from drug use.
Whether or not my accusations were
valid is no longer relevant. Tuesday the
Chicago White Sox obtained Sconiers'
contract from the Bees and assigned him
to their Hawaii farm club. They also
guaranteed him a spot on their spring
training roster next year. In other
words, his fate is now in his own hands.
If he plays well he will be in the major
leagues again.
Sconiers has paid his dues for his
checkered past. I wish him all the best in
the future.
The Hawaii team Sconiers will play

for might soon include a player who is
very well known in these parts. When
Stanford star Jack McDowell signs a
contract with the White Sox, he is likely
to be assigned to Hawaii. Sources report
McDowell and the Sox are about $20,000
apart in trying to agree on a contract.
The rest McDowell has gotten since
the College World Series (CWS) has
probably done him a lot of good, but if he
holds out much longer it is unlikely he'll
be able to pitch effectively this year. He
would then have to start next spring in
the minors, without having pitched com
petitively for a long time. That would set
back his timetable for making it to the
big leagues.
Aside from providing a show case for
Stanford talent, the CWS provided more
than its share of anecdotal material. One
of the more enjoyable stories concerns a
couple of players on the Texas Rangers.
Steve Beuchele, the Rangers' third
baseman, is a Stanford alumnus, and
outfielder Pete Incaviglia spent his col
lege days at Oklahoma State. When
their respective alma maters were set to
meet in the CWS final, the two of them
placed a small wager on the outcome.
The loser, so the story goes, would have
to wear a T-shirt from the winner's
school for the rest of the season. I hear
Incaviglia looks great in cardinal.
Incaviglia was one of the outstanding
rookies in the American League last
year. An extraordinary wealth of talent
came to the majors including players

like Cory Snyder, Jose Canseco and
Danny Tartabull. By the end of the year
every pundit in the world of sports had
an opinion on which of these guys would
have the best careers.
Obviously, it's still too early to say for
sure what will become of all these
players but their sophomore seasons pro
vide some interesting information. I
would guess that 10 years down the road
the most successful members of the 1986
class will be Wally Joyner of the Califor
nia Angels and the Rangers' Ruben
Sierra.
As a 20-year-old rookie, Sierra proved
he could hit major league pitching. Then
when he got off to a slow start this year,
many gave him the flash-in-the-pan
label. Well, Sierra is producing once
again, hitting for average and power,
and he's still only 21.
Joyner took the baseball world by
storm last year with his fast start. But
he slowed down dramatically in the
second half. Before this season began,
baseball's most obnoxious number
cruncher, Bill James, predicted mounds
of mediocrity for Joyner.
The Angels first baseman's perform
ance this year has put James and other
doubters to shame. He is hitting for
power and he leads the American
League in RBIs. Plus, he is a fine defen
sive player. California has done the im
possible in replacing Rod Carew with a
player who just might be almost as good.
Obviously, this year's rookie who has

everyone talking is Mark McGwire. The
accolades showered upon this kid are
very well deserved. His home run total is
nothing short of incredible, to be sure,
but, he's also hitting .295. McGwire
doesn't just swing for the fences — he
can hit.
A great deal has been made of the fact
that McGwire has hit more homers than
he ever did in the minors, though, to put
it bluntly, that kind of talk is nonsense.
The reason is that no one really hits
home runs in the minors.
The examples to prove that are too
numerous to list here, but consider a
couple. The Minnesota Twins' Kirby
Puckett hit over 30 home runs last year
— and never hit more than four in the
minors. But the most impressive exam
ple of all is Henry Aaron.
Hammerin' Hank, baseball all-time
home run champion with a career total
of 755, never hit 15 home runs in a
minor league season. No, I'm not kid
ding. So let's not worry that Big Mac has
never hit this many before. Instead, let's
root him on to 60.
