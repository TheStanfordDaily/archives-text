## 1986 graduate dies in SF 
### 
Craig William Copps, a 1986 graduate, died
Tuesday evening at San Francisco General
Hospital after suffering injuries in an automo
bile accident Monday. He was 23.
Copps, a psychology graduate, was planning
to attend Southwestern University Medical
School in Dallas this fall.
The accident occured at the intersection of
Haight and Octavia streets in San Francisco,
when a truck allegedly ran a stop sign and
struck the passenger side of a Honda Civic
driven by Wendy Conole. Conole was not
injured. Copps, sitting in the front passenger
seat, suffered major head injuries. Another
passenger, Charlene Jimenez, sustained minor
injuries.
Originally, Copps was declared dead at the
scene of the accident, but was later revived at

S.F. General. Exploratory head and chest sur
gery failed. Copps died at 5:30 p.m. Tuesday
after donating his kidneys and liver to other
patients.
"He was someone who made friends easily,"
said Jeff Plaskett, also a 1986 graduate and
Copp's former roommate.
"People like Craig make the chance to go to
Stanford more than a scholastic experience â€”
they make it a personal experience. I'm grate
ful to have known Craig. For those who knew
him, he made our own lives better."
Copps is survived by his parents, James and
Patricia, and his brothers, Lymon and David,
of Dallas.
Copps will be buried in Dallas. A memorial
service will be held at St. Anne's Chapel in
Palo Alto tomorrow at 2:00 p.m.
