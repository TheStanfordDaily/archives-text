A Stanford student working for the
presidential campaign of Massachusetts
Gov. Michael Dukakis distributed a con
troversial campaign mailing in May that
irritated supporters of Rep. Richard Gep
hardt, D-Mo., and attracted coverage by
the Boston Globe.
Mark Lemley, a senior in political sci
ence, critically portrayed the voting
records and position statements of six
rival Democratic presidential candidates
in the two-page letter. A July 20 article
in the Globe described the letter as the
first negative campaign literature of the
1988 presidential contest.
Lemley said that before distributing
the letter, he sent a copy for approval to
John Giesser, a Dukakis campaign offi
cial in Boston.

Giesser initially approved the letter,
but reconsidered and told Lemley that
the stance of the campaign was to pres
ent only a positive image. By that time,
Lemley said, some copies of the letter
had been sent.
"It's a shame," Lemley said. "What
basically happened was a timing prob
lem."
Lemley said he sent the letter to no
more than five people in Northern Cali
fornia and did not distribute it as a regu
lar campaign mailing.
"I sent it to people in politics who I
thought might be interested," Lemley
said last night. He said part of his job
was to recruit former Hart volunteers to
work for Dukakis. Apparently someone
on the Gephardt staff received the letter
by accident, Lemley said.
According to the Globe arti
cle, a Gephardt spokesman said
12 Democrats had complained
to the Gephardt campaign
about the letter.
Lemley said he thought the
Gephardt campaign had merely
decided to take advantage of the
letter. "I don't know a dozen
Gephardt supporters in Califor
nia," he said.
Lemley said he wrote the po
sition summary as part of an op
position research project while
working for Gary Hart's presi
dential campaign.
According to the Globe, Lem
ley's letter described Gephardt
as supporting "harsh protec

tionist measures" on trade
policy.
Lemley called the Globe's
portrayal of his letter negative.
He said it contained records of
public votes and statements by
the candidates.
"If they (the candidates), too,
consider it negative, then per
haps that reflects somewhat on
their voting records," he said.
Lemley joined the Dukakis
organization after Hart
withdrew from the race in early
May. Until then he was Califor
nia college coordinator for the
Hart campaign and had worked
for Hart since November 1983.
Lemley said he switched to
Dukakis because the Massac
hussets governor is the"the
closest to Gary Hart on the is
sues.
