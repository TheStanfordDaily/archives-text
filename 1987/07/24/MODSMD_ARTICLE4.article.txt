# Group to study alcohol policy
## 
### SUSAN SLUSSER Editorial staff 
Acting Dean of Student Af
fairs Norm Robinson has ap
pointed an eight-member group
to advise the University on how
to beef up its alcohol policy en
forcement.
The group, which will hold its
first meeting next week, will
discuss means of enforcing
existing guidelines rather than
proposing changes to the cur
rent alcohol policy, Robinson
said.
"I think the policy as it stands
is the best we could have. I'd be
loath to see the administration
have to police students," said
Joe Pisano, fraternal affairs ad
viser and a member of the
group.
But, "if people don't pay at
tention to the policy, and there
are more incidents, the liberal
alcohol policy might be threat
ened. What we have is a good
system, but if people can't fol
low it, who knows what will
happen," he added.
The decision to form the
group comes in the wake of the
April 22 alcohol-related drown
ing of junior David Dunshee
after he left a fraternity rush
party.
A report prepared by Assis
tant to the Provost Michael
Jackson determined that the
Zeta Psi fraternity demon
strated "substantial disregard
of Interfraternity Council (IFC)
policies and Boathouse rules
and regulations," at the party.
The IFC and Boathouse rules
are based on the alcohol policy.
"Jackson's report said that
existing policies appear to be
adequate if adhered to. That
seems reasonable, so adherance
is what the group will be focus
ing on," Robinson said.
Assistant Dean of Student Af
fairs Diana Conklin, appointed
by Robinson to chair the group,
agreed that enforcement of the
policy is the most important
issue the group will discuss.
"[That] is the area that needs
the most attention," Conklin

said. "Right now there is no one
comprehensive way to respond
to violations."
Robinson appointed the group
in a July 15 memo and directed
it to prepare a report by August
30 that makes "recommenda
tions addressing the issues as
they relate specifically to*
residences and to non
residential student organiza
tions."
In addition to Conklin and
Pisano, the group includes
senior Jim Durkin, a member of
the Council of Presidents; Chris
Griffith, assistant director of
graduate residences; Ann Por
teus, Roble resident fellow;
Paul Walters, director of Stu
dent Health Services; and
senior Julie Switzer.
Robinson's memo urges the
group to recommend how to:
•Educate the campus commu
nity about the University alco
hol policy and its application to
student life,
•Enforce the policy,
•Effectively penalize groups
that don't comply, and
• Involve a broad range of
campus organizations in
reviewing the group's recom
mendations.
Possible solutions, according
to Pisano, "might not be so
much monitoring parties but
sanctions for non-compliance,
such as denying the use of Uni
versity space."
Durkin said the best solution

"would be kosher to both stu
dents and administration.
"I'd like to see the students
have a lot of freedom without
risking liabilities for the organ
izers," Durkin said. "It seems
like a lot of spring parties were
canceled after the Dunshee inci
dent — it was a bad situation.
We'd like to know where
[students] stand and maximize
the safety of parties without in
volving police.
"The police don't want to
have to break up parties or
come in and tell people that
they have to card (for proof of le
gal age to drink). If students
can monitor parties themselves,
that would be the ideal situa
tion," Durkin said.
There are two major issues,
Pisano said. "The first is com
municating the policy to stu
dents who are organizing par
ties. The other is monitoring
compliance with the guidelines

that are already in place."
At present, Robinson said,
"there is just no way to be cer
tain at all that persons organiz
ing parties have even heard of
the policy.
"We have to find a way to
make sure that they know
about it. It is my belief that if
we do that, incidents where the
policy is not followed will be
reduced greatly," he added.
"It's no small task," Pisano
said. "Party organizers change
every quarter, even every
party."
. The Jackson report found
that the existing alcohol policy
"appears adequate if adhered
to," but that the guidelines
were violated on the night of
Dunshee's death. The report
concluded that the University
should "re-examine its alcohol
policies with particular consid
eration of issues relating to en
forcement and consequences to
groups for non-compliance."
Robinson concurred with the
report. "We do have to have
some way of dealing with
groups that don't follow the reg
ulations," Robinson said.
'There have to be conse
quences."

fairs Diana Conklin, appointed
by Robinson to chair the group,
agreed that enforcement of the
policy is the most important
issue the group will discuss.
"[That] is the area that needs
the most attention," Conklin

said. "Right now there is no one
comprehensive way to respond
to violations."
Robinson appointed the group
in a July 15 memo and directed
it to prepare a report by August
30 that makes "recommenda
tions addressing the issues as
they relate specifically to*
residences and to non
residential student organiza
tions."
In addition to Conklin and
Pisano, the group includes
senior Jim Durkin, a member of
the Council of Presidents; Chris
Griffith, assistant director of
graduate residences; Ann Por
teus, Roble resident fellow;
Paul Walters, director of Stu
dent Health Services; and
senior Julie Switzer.
Robinson's memo urges the
group to recommend how to:
•Educate the campus commu
nity about the University alco
hol policy and its application to
student life,
•Enforce the policy,
•Effectively penalize groups
that don't comply, and
• Involve a broad range of
campus organizations in
reviewing the group's recom
mendations.
Possible solutions, according
to Pisano, "might not be so
much monitoring parties but
sanctions for non-compliance,
such as denying the use of Uni
versity space."
Durkin said the best solution

"would be kosher to both stu
dents and administration.
"I'd like to see the students
have a lot of freedom without
risking liabilities for the organ
izers," Durkin said. "It seems
like a lot of spring parties were
canceled after the Dunshee inci
dent — it was a bad situation.
We'd like to know where
[students] stand and maximize
the safety of parties without in
volving police.
"The police don't want to
have to break up parties or
come in and tell people that
they have to card (for proof of le
gal age to drink). If students
can monitor parties themselves,
that would be the ideal situa
tion," Durkin said.
There are two major issues,
Pisano said. "The first is com
municating the policy to stu
dents who are organizing par
ties. The other is monitoring
compliance with the guidelines

that are already in place."
At present, Robinson said,
"there is just no way to be cer
tain at all that persons organiz
ing parties have even heard of
the policy.
"We have to find a way to
make sure that they know
about it. It is my belief that if
we do that, incidents where the
policy is not followed will be
reduced greatly," he added.
"It's no small task," Pisano
said. "Party organizers change
every quarter, even every
party."
. The Jackson report found
that the existing alcohol policy
"appears adequate if adhered
to," but that the guidelines
were violated on the night of
Dunshee's death. The report
concluded that the University
should "re-examine its alcohol
policies with particular consid
eration of issues relating to en
forcement and consequences to
groups for non-compliance."
Robinson concurred with the
report. "We do have to have
some way of dealing with
groups that don't follow the reg
ulations," Robinson said.
'There have to be conse
quences."
