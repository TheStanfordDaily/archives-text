# Group to study alcohol policy
## 
### SUSAN SLUSSER Editorial staff 
Acting Dean of Student Af
fairs Norm Robinson has ap
pointed an eight-member group
to advise the University on how
to beef up its alcohol policy en
forcement.
The group, which will hold its
first meeting next week, will
discuss means of enforcing
existing guidelines rather than
proposing changes to the cur
rent alcohol policy, Robinson
said.
"I think the policy as it stands
is the best we could have. I'd be
loath to see the administration
have to police students," said
Joe Pisano, fraternal affairs ad
viser and a member of the
group.
But, "if people don't pay at
tention to the policy, and there
are more incidents, the liberal
alcohol policy might be threat
ened. What we have is a good
system, but if people can't fol
low it, who knows what will
happen," he added.
The decision to form the
group comes in the wake of the
April 22 alcohol-related drown
ing of junior David Dunshee
after he left a fraternity rush
party.
A report prepared by Assis
tant to the Provost Michael
Jackson determined that the
Zeta Psi fraternity demon
strated "substantial disregard
of Interfraternity Council (IFC)
policies and Boathouse rules
and regulations," at the party.
The IFC and Boathouse rules
are based on the alcohol policy.
"Jackson's report said that
existing policies appear to be
adequate if adhered to. That
seems reasonable, so adherance
is what the group will be focus
ing on," Robinson said.
Assistant Dean of Student Af
fairs Diana Conklin, appointed
by Robinson to chair the group,
agreed that enforcement of the
policy is the most important
issue the group will discuss.
"[That] is the area that needs
the most attention," Conklin

said. "Right now there is no one
comprehensive way to respond
to violations."
Robinson appointed the group
in a July 15 memo and directed
it to prepare a report by August
30 that makes "recommenda
tions addressing the issues as
they relate specifically to*
residences and to non
residential student organiza
tions."
In addition to Conklin and
Pisano, the group includes
senior Jim Durkin, a member of
the Council of Presidents; Chris
Griffith, assistant director of
graduate residences; Ann Por
teus, Roble resident fellow;
Paul Walters, director of Stu
