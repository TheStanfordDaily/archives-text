The University expects to an
nounce the fate of the Zeta Psi
fraternity next week, according
to acting Dean of Student Af
fairs Norm Robinson.
The fraternity has been un
der investigation since the
April 22 death of junior David
Dunshee, the Zete rush chair
man, who drowned in Lake
Lagunita after drinking too
much at a Boathouse rush
party. According to the June 10
report compiled by Assistant to
the Provost Michael Jackson,
the Zetes violated a number of
campus alcohol policies and
rush guidelines at the party.
Jackson's report recom
mended that the University
revoke its recognition of the fra
ternity.
"No decision has been made
yet," Fraternal Affairs Adviser
Joe Pisano said. "We've been
talking about it, not just'with
respect to that specific incident,
but with respect to what kind of
organization Zeta Psi has been
over the last few years. That
will be taken into consideration
in the final decision."
The University revoked
recognition of the fraternity
and its housing privileges in
1981 after a series of incidents,
including an episode in which
several Zetes threw a Mills Col
lege woman into a shallow ce
ment pond.
The Zetes regained Univer
sity recognition, but not
housing priveleges, after a
three-year suspension.

"We've talked about the
Zetes," said Diana Conklin, as
sistant dean of student affairs.
"I know the alumni and the ac
tive chapter members have
given their future a lot of
thought."
"I've had conversations with
some of the actives and the
chapter adviser," Robinson
said."They're in the midst of
thinking about what they
should be doing here and the fu
ture of the chapter.
They'd like to find a way of
ensuring the long-run health
and viability of the Zetes at
Stanford and find out if a short
term change or temporary ab
sence from Stanford might be
beneficial."
