Reagan appoints commission on AIDS
WASHINGTON — President Ronald Reagan yesterday
appointed a 13-member commission to advise him on combat
ting AIDS and then went to the National Institutes of Health
to dramatize his concern about the spread of the disease.
At NIH Reagan visited briefly with four children suffering
from acquired immune deficiency syndrome — the first time
the president has met AIDS patients — and toured an AIDS
laboratory. In remarks introducing his panel Reagan referred
to "the death by AIDS of friends and former associates" whom
he did not name and pledged to "one way or another . . . beat
this deadly disease."
Reagan's choice of panelists — among them a conservative
Roman Catholic cardinal and an Illinois state legislator who
supports widespread mandatory testing — as well as the
group's collective lack of expertise about AIDS was immedi
ately criticized by gay rights groups and public health offi
cials.
"This administration never ceases to amaze me," said
Jeffrey Levi, executive director of the National Gay and Les
bian Task Force. "It has managed to put together a panel
whose learning curve will be tremendous and who does not
bring a unique perspective about this disease beyond that
which the medical community has already recommended."
Soviets offer new proposal on arms
MOSCOW — Senior Soviet officials said yesterday that
American nuclear warheads atop 72 Pershing 1-A missiles
under West German control remain one of four major obsta
cles in the way of a global superpower ban on medium-range
nuclear missiles.
Their comments were made as Soviet arms control
negotiators in Geneva formally presented their U.S. counter
parts with the new Kremlin proposal to eliminate all
medium-range missiles — both those with the longer range of
600 to 3,000 miles and those with a shorter range of 300 to
600 miles — in Asia as well as in Europe.
The proposal, which drops Moscow's previous insistence on
keeping 100 warheads in Soviet Asia and effectively deals
with the U.S. response that it should then have the right to
deploy a similar number of warheads on U.S. soil, probably
Alaska, has been greeted as a breakthrough in the bogged
down Geneva talks.
First Deputy Foreign Minister Yuli Vorontsov and Mar
shal Sergei Akhromeyev, chief of staff of the Soviet armed
forces, said they expected a prompt American response that
would lead to an agreement and a follow-up summit between
Gorbachev and President Reagan this year.
Judge is likely choice to head FBI
WASHINGTON — William Steele Sessions, a federal
judge in Texas with a tough "law and order" reputation, has
emerged as the leading candidate to be director of the FBI
and could be nominated as early as today, Reagan adminis
tration sources said yesterday.
Sessions, 57, will be interviewed today by Attorney Gen
eral Edwin Meese 111, sources said. "If that goes well, they'll
take him to see the president, and it's a done deal," one senior
official said.
The selection of Sessions would complete an arduous search
by Meese and other administration officials to find a succes
sor to William Webster, now the director of the CIA. Several
better-known candidates have turned down the job or let it be
known that they were not interested in the 10-year appoint
ment.
Sessions "is conservative, a down-the-line Reagan adminis
tration judge," said Norma Cantu of the Mexican American
Legal Defense Fund office in San Antonio, Texas.
Sessions indicated that he was interested in the job last
March 17 when he told Texas newspapers that the appoint
ment would be "the greatest challenge."
Ex-presidential aide pleads innocent
WASHINGTON — Former White House political director
Lyn Nofziger pleaded innocent yesterday to charges that his
lobbying of former government colleagues violated conflict
of-interest laws. He vowed to fight to save his reputation.
Nofziger, President Reagan's political adviser from 1981
until he left the White House in 1982, was arraigned before
U.S. District Judge Thomas Flannery who set a Nov. 16 trial
date.
Defense attorney Paul Perito entered the innocent plea for
his client to charges in the six-count indictment. It alleges
Nofziger "profited from the political reputation and influ
ence" he had in the Reagan administration.
Nofziger is accused of improperly contacting former admin
istration colleagues on behalf of several clients including
Wedtech Corp., a defense contractor involved in a legal storm
that has touched Attorney General Edwin Meese 111.
Mark Bragg, the former presidential aide's business
partner, pleaded innocent to a charge of aiding and abetting
Nofziger's alleged violations of the Ethics in Government Act.
The judge allowed the defendants to remain free on per
sonal recognizance.
