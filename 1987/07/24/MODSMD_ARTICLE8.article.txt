# Shultz: Top aides misled Reagan
## 
### 
WASHINGTON — Former
national security adviser John
Poindexter and the late CIA Di
rector William Casey
repeatedly misled President
Reagan about the arms-for
hostage swaps they engineered
with Iran and hoped that the
president would "bail them out"
when the politically explosive
deals became public, Secretary
of State George Shultz testified
yesterday.
Shultz, in a dramatic first day
of testimony before the congres
sional committees investigating
the Iran-contra affair, described
a cocoon of deception spun
around the president and high
administration officials by some
of Reagan's closest advisers.
It was designed, Shultz said,
to shroud the disturbing truth
that the deals amounted to no
more than exchanging weapons
for hostages, a betrayal of
Reagan's often-repeated pledge
that he would never bargain
with terrorists.
"When you get down into the
dirt of the operational details, it

always comes out arms for
hostages . . . simply and purely
an effort to trade arms for
hostages," Shultz said.
But it was not until last De
cember, more than a month
after the operation was exposed,
that Shultz was finally able to
convince Reagan of how he had
been misled, Shultz recalled.
Reagan was particularly aston
ished to see that private busi
nessmen, acting as U.S. agents,
had agreed in negotiations with
Iran to help pressure Kuwait to
release 17 Shia Moslem terror
ists.
"He reacted like he'd been
kicked in the belly," Shultz
said, noting that the prisoners
had been convicted of terrorist
acts against Americans.
"I have never seen him so
mad," the secretary added. "His
jaw set and his eyes flashed. . . .
I finally felt that the president
deeply understands that some
thing is radically wrong here."
Shultz, an opponent of the
arms deals from the time they
were proposed in mid-1985, said

that he had been deceived on
numerous occasions as the sales
progressed and did not learn
that the United States had di
rectly sold weapons to Iran un
til last November. That was al
most nine months after the ini
tial transfer from the United
States to Iran had occurred.
Noting that he had once de
scribed his knowledge as
"fragmentary and sporadic,"
Shultz said: "Of course, I now
know that was the understate
ment of the year."
Poindexter testified earlier
this week that once Shultz had
been overruled in his objections
to the sales, he had pointedly
requested not to be informed of
their progress.
But Shultz countered: "What
I did say to Admiral Poindexter
was that I wanted to be in
formed of the things I needed to
know to do my job as secretary
of state, but he didn't need to
keep me posted on the details."
