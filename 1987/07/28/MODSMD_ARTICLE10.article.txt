# Why Missouri and San Francisco don't mix
## 
### 
Question: What do the Abalone Alliance,
the Gray Panthers, the Sierra Club and the
Quakers have in common?
Answer: Besides a general penchant for
unabashed pacifism, all have aligned them
selves strongly in opposition to San Fran
cisco Mayor Dianne Feinstein's bid to es
tablish the City as the new homeport of the
battleship USS Missouri.

A recent poll by the San Francisco
Chronicle found that nearly two out of
three San Franciscans support the
homeporting initiative. And why not? A
sleek, revamped warship like the "Mighty
Mo," with its proud history (the Japanese
surrender was signed on its decks at the
end of World War II) is hard to turn down.
Especially when the economic impact of
the project looks very positive. The ship
would anchor at Hunter's Point, now a run
down corner of the City. The Navy and
Feinstein predict a direct and indirect need
for 2,000 new jobs in San Francisco, and
perhaps an additional 5,000 in the greater
Bay Area. In her final year, looking to leave
office with a bang, Feinstein would be crazy

to pass up the Mo.
Or so it seems. The above-mentioned ac
tivists may simply be kicking up dirt for the
sake of it, but there are some heavy hitters
in their camp, notably four members of the
Board of Supervisors. And only four of the
seven remaining supervisors have openly
declared support for the project, so the deci
sion still hangs in the balance.
There are two issues here. First is the
new expansionist naval policy that
originally led to the Missouri's resurrec
tion. Second is the welfare of San Francisco
and the Bay Area (of no small importance
to us on the Farm).
The "Big Stick" Navy is back with a ven
geance, on view now in the Persian Gulf.
The Navy is more and more a diplomatic
tool, less and less a strategic force.
Evidently dressing up an old warrior like
the Missouri and basing it in romantic San
Francisco lends that much more sex appeal
to our swashbuckling maritime diplomacy.
An added motive for the Navy to bring a
ship here: dispersion of force. San Diego
can't become another Pearl Harbor — so
runs the logic.
The argument looks good on the face of it.
But let's recognize the motives openly. The
Missouri could indeed be a strategic
weapon; the Navy won't deny that nukes
may be deployed on board. However, all nu
clear capabilities aside, the refurbishing of
the Missouri is still simply a shot of testos
terone for naval higher-ups.
San Franciscans fall into the same trap.

There is euphoria in the City: "Now our
port will become major-league." Wrong.
San Francisco isn't inferior just because it
lacks a big ship. It is a small, charming city
that is certainly not in need of a larger mili
tary presence. (The Army Presidio takes up
enough space already.)
Maybe the Bay would be a good place for
a warship. But please stick it over near
Richmond somewhere, next to all those un
sightly refinery tanks.
Aesthetically, the idea stinks. Economi
cally, it's overrated. The job trade-off is still
unclear. What's more, San Francisco and
the state will have to spend millions to
clean up the huge amount of toxic waste
that has accumulated in the soil around
Hunter's Point. Dredging the spot will put
some nasty stuff into circulation in the Bay
— PCBs, heavy metals, maybe even small
amounts of nuclear waste and who knows
what else.
And lest we forget, the Bay may soon lose
much of its capacity to flush the stuff away
with fresh water from the Sacramento-San
Joaquin Delta, if Southern California wins
the latest water war.
Hunter's Point needs help. San Francis
cans need jobs. But the homeporting initia
tive isn't the best answer; it's just a roman
tic, ill-considered quick fix, about to be
steamrolled through by Feinstein and,
among others, the Chronicle. I'm with the
activists: No go on the Mo.
