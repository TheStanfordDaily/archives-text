Clearing quotes
on drug testing
While the statements attrib
uted to me in The Daily's July
21 article concerning the
NCAA litigation were quite
accurate, some additional con
text will clear up some confu
sion that the article seems to
have created —judging from
the calls I have received over
two of the quotes.
They were: Drug testing "is
likely to be illegal," and
"Stanford voted against it. It's
not our program, and we don't
want anything to do with it."
The first was a reference to
drug testing under this NCAA
program — not all possible
drug testing for all possible
purposes. The second was
focused on the present status of
court proceedings, i.e., we
wanted nothing to do with the
program until there is a final
decision in this case, given the
Superior Court's preliminary
determination that the pro
gram is likely to be unlawful.

Hearing lies
The Iran-contra hearings
have taught Americans one
clear lesson, which emerges
from the complex and various
testimony as the dominant
conclusion: Ends never justify
means. Our government is fast
becoming an international
outlaw.
Adm. John Poindexter was
just a civil servant who worked
for President Reagan for six
months. It is absurd to imagine
that he failed to report care
fully and often to the president
on the progress of the arms-for
hostages plan and the plan to
assist the contras.
We now have in our govern
ment an institutionalized pro
gram of lying. It is just as if the
president told Poindexter and
Lt. Col. Oliver North, at the
very outset, "If you want to
work for the government, you
must lie."
The current revelations of
illegal, secret operations con
ducted in the heart of the
republic taint the image of
America abroad.

Campus dangerous
for bicyclists
I plead for decisive and
prompt action on Stanford's
current hazardous center-of
campus bike paths. Right now
they consist of a vague and
fading network of white lines
and arrows that causes confu
sion in the minds of campus
bikers and pedestrians. This is
a dangerous situation. I think
there are two choices:
• Repaint the lines and ar
rows and reinstitute this
reasonable arrangement by
campus-wide educa
tion/publicity. I vote for this
since it gives the careful biker
like myself a little more secu
rity.
• Completely remove the
residual traces of the paths and
revert to the former chaos. This
solution would at least clarify
the situation.
I urge the Bicycle Safety
Committee to do something
about this situation soon.
