## Zurcher decision attacked as bad law 
### BRIAN RHOADS Staff writer 
This is the second article in a two-part series on the
police raid of The Daily in 1971.
On May 31,1978, the U.S. Supreme Court reversed a
U.S. District Court decision between The Daily and
Palo Alto Police Chief James Zurcher, ruling that
newspaper offices could be searched by police with a
general warrant even if none of the newspaper's
employees are suspected of a crime.

The court majority opinion, written by Justice Byron
White, held that "the critical element in a reasonable
search is not that the owner of the property is suspected
of a crime, but that there is reasonable cause to believe
that the specific 'things' to be searched for and seized
are located on the property to which entry is sought."
Daily attorneys had argued that news-gathering op
erations would be disrupted and confidential sources
lost if searches of this sort were permitted.
The court rejected this argument, stating "properly
administered, the preconditions for a warrant should
afford sufficient protections against the harms that are
assertedly threatened by warrants for searching news
paper offices."
The Precedent:
The decision shocked news editors nationwide, and
many charged that freedom of the press had been
eroded — law officials could disrupt the operations of a
news office, and it would be harder for reporters to
work with confidential sources.
The press wasn't the only institution concerned with

the ruling. Lawyers, doctors, phsychiatrists and clergy
feared that their occupations would suffer similar
privacy violations.
Between the 1971 raid and 1983, 65 searches of non
suspect third parties occurred nationwide, prompting
Bob Beyers of Stanford News and Publications to
criticize the Palo Alto police for providing "a powerful
precedent, now widely used for lazy, unprofessional
work by prosecutors and police against third parties."
Soon after the Supreme Court ruling, news media
offices were raided in Michigan, Idaho, Georgia, lowa
and North Dakota.
In response to uproar over the court's decision,
Congress passed the Privacy Protection Act of 1980,
which gives limited protection to the press and requires
that federal agents seek Justice Department authoriza
tion before search and seizure of materials in the pos
session of a disinterested third party physician, lawyer
or clergyman.
The California Legislature went further the year
before, giving the California press absolute protection
from third-party searches.
In addition, it is now mandatory that California law
enforcement use the "special master" procedure in
cases where non-suspect professionals have confiden
tial relationships with clients, patients or penitents.
This procedure requires a neutral attorney to search in
place of police.
According to Dan Fiduccia, Daily associate editor at
the time of the Supreme Court ruling, "Since Congress
passed the law, there have been at least 150 known
searches of non-suspect third parties."
There should be emphasis on the "known," added
Fiduccia, because "searches are like rapes, they don't
get reported."
California has no requirement that police keep
record of the searches, even though the State Bar keeps
unofficial statistics, he said.
"In many cases, the professionals (searched) are in
question themselves, for instance, physicians stealing
government medicaid funds, or drug trafficking," he
said.
"However, even in cases where the professional is a

suspect, his clients usually are not, and going through
their confidential records is an invasion of privacy,"
Fiduccia said.
Fiduccia also noted that California leads the United
States with more searches than all other states
combined. "California police are very aggressive. When
the court made its ruling it was a day at the racetrack.
In 1978, the gates went up and the horses were off."
He explained that there were no known third-party
searches from 1776-1971, and "now you can't even
count them."
George Kennedy, Santa Clara assistant district at
torney, disputed Fiduccia's assertion, saying "you're
under the wrong impression if you think third-party
searches never went on before this case. The Daily case
just made the media aware.
"These sorts of searches are routine — one of the
most routine type is that of a bank, for bank records of
bad checks," said Kennedy. "We only do about five spe-


cial masters (searches) a year,
roughly. It's kind of fun to have
a little variety," he added.
He also said the procedure for
obtaining a search warrant has
become more difficult due to the
legislative restrictions. "It's not
unworkable, but it's more of a
hassle." He added that in cases
of newsrooms, "we can't do it at
all."
Fiduccia said that since Cali
fornia banned news media
searches, "there have been two
known search cases of news
media, one without a search
warrant. That case was a bla
tant misrepresentation of the
law.
"The county D.A.'s record on
use of these searches is abomi
nable," Fiduccia charged, lam
basting county officials. "Santa
Clara County is one of the top
abusers of third-party searches.
"The D.A.'s office has yet to
justify to residents of the
county, one, why it is routinely
engaging in practices that law
officers rarely use; two, why
they've misrepresented the law
in at least one of these searches
(the newsroom); and three, why
this county has the unique
record of searching homes on
the evening before a holiday to
see if people have illegal cable
TV set up," he added.
"County residents should
hold their law enforcement offi
cials responsible until they pro
vide an explanation for the cur
rent state of affairs," Fiduccia

advised.
The precedent appears to be
no less faulty at the federal
level. Federal officials are
supposed to report annually to
Congress on non-suspect
searches. Justice Department
records disclose only one such
report filed in seven years, Fid
uccia said.
"One federal court of appeals
has chastised the Justice De
partment for its blatant disre
gard for the law," continued
Fiduccia. "Not content with the
law Congress passed, the
Justice Department under the
Reagan administration has cho
sen to ignore it,"he concluded.
Fiduccia is a free-lance
reporter residing in Santa
Clara County. He publishes ac
counts and statistics involving
third-party abuses and uses
called "Search Survey." He is
co-authoring a book on the issue
due out at the end of the year.
Two weeks ago, Chris Durkin
succeeded Zurcher as chief of
police. His comment on police
searches of non-suspect third
parties: "Police will act in ac
cordance with the Supreme
Court ruling."
However, he added, "In my
memory we haven't had any
third-party searches since the
search of The Daily. Our
searches usually are of homes of
suspects of narcotics traffick
ing.
"If we had to search a non
suspect third party we would
have to review the law
thoroughly before doing so." He
added jokingly, "Particularly in
the case of The Daily."
