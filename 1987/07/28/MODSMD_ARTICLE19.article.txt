# Entertainment
## New Marine World offers education and entertainment 
### LOUIS LERMAN 
A little more than an hour's drive
toward wine country lies Marine World
Africa USA — the official name for what
the resident lions, tigers and dolphins
call home. It is a place of animal magic,
allowing visitors to enter into the
wonder-filled world of live animals.
With their recent move to Vallejo from
the nearby Redwood Shores site, Marine
World has attempted to transform itself
from an entertainment-dominated
animal park to a non-profit foundation.
Officials say they are dedicated to
making the park an educational
resource for the Bay Area.
According to animal trainer Cecilia
Pleshakov, "You can see all the films, all
the photo portfolios and read all the
books, but until you see [the animalsl in
the fur — that's when real education
begins to take place."
Considering the problems that accom
pany establishing a new organization at
a new site, Marine World has been sur
prisingly successful at balancing the all
too-often competing goals of entertain
ment and education.
"We try to sneak education into the
entertainment, at times even, trick
people into learning," said Pleshakov
with a laugh.
The formal shows all have entertain
ment value, but with differing levels of
sophistication. All will appeal to
children, but older audiences will find
some superior to others.
I found the dolphin and killer whale
show to be the most satisfying. Each act
included considerable detail of the physi
cal adaptations these mammals have
made to the marine environment. For

example, an orca can communicate with
friends 500 miles away through use of its
powerful tail.
The most informative part of the
whale act occurred accidentally.
The star, 20-year-old Yakka,
repeatedly balked at initiating her
"program." During this time, the audi
ence received an impromptu discussion
and demonstration of the use of visual
cues and positive reinforcement.
Yakka's individuality of behavior un
derscored the non-triviality of the
animal tricks we were so casually enjoy-

ing, and gave a hint to the tremendous
efforts devoted to the upbringing and
training of the animal stars.
On the other hand, the primate show
was a disappointment. The chimps were
all too cute and adorable in their desig
ner safari-wear, except for one baby in
trendy diapers. The entire act was at the

level of circus entertainment, with no
more than a few lines of actual informa
tion included.
There is much more at Marine World
than just the shows. There are animals
in their various homes to watch, and
sometimes to actually play with. Newly
born animals, such as Bengal tigers from
Marine World's highly succesful breed
ing program, can be observed in their
nursery. And special programs during
the year allow a private backstage tour
of the animals for small groups of
children and adults. In addition, a num-

ber of special educational opportunities
are available during a general visit.
For example, Marine World offers a
special "discovery room." This is an edu
cational laboratory concentrating on the
adaptations animals make to their envi
ronments.
Besides this room, Director of Educa

tion Pat Foster-Turley has designed a
number of interactive educational
kiosks. These range from a game of
"Endangered Animal Trivia" to a sophis
ticated dolphin display introducing the
ideas of comparative anatomy between
humans and their salt-water cousins.
The staff is even more dedicated to
caring for the animals than they are to
the education of the visitors. Last week
Marine World employees were in the
news as they led the fight to save a
beached 2-day-old porpoise. This activity
is typical of the staffs' commitment to
wildlife that extends beyond the daily
duties required to maintain an animal
park.
All visitors are strongly encouraged to
talk as much as they can with the
trainers. "We want the trainers and
handlers to be a source of information for
you to walk up to. If you go through the
park passively you won't get as much out
of it," said Jim Bond, Marine World's
public relations representative. Ceci
Hugo, director of the Marine World
Foundation, agreed. "Just ask the
trainers, that's what they are there for,
that's what helps make us different," she
said.
Potential vistors should be aware of
the problems inherent in any animal
park: the potential crowds, the jarring
tributes to Marine World's corporate
sponsors and the sometimes unsophist
icated level of the entertainment.
However, looking beyond these superfi
cial irritations, Marine World offers to
introduce children and reintroduce
adults to the magic kingdom of animals.

everyday this summer from 9:30 a.m. to
6:30 p.m.

you to walk up to. If you go through the
park passively you won't get as much out
of it," said Jim Bond, Marine World's
public relations representative. Ceci
Hugo, director of the Marine World
Foundation, agreed. "Just ask the
trainers, that's what they are there for,
that's what helps make us different," she
said.
Potential vistors should be aware of
the problems inherent in any animal
park: the potential crowds, the jarring
tributes to Marine World's corporate
sponsors and the sometimes unsophist
icated level of the entertainment.
However, looking beyond these superfi
cial irritations, Marine World offers to
introduce children and reintroduce
adults to the magic kingdom of animals.
Marine World Africa USA is open
everyday this summer from 9:30 a.m. to
6:30 p.m.
