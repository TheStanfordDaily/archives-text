# Senate approves all-campus party
## 
### EMMA STERLAND Staff writer 
The ASSU Senate approved a proposal
Thursday to provide funds for an all-campus
party at the beginning of fall quarter, according
to Jim Durkin of the Council of Presidents.
Durkin said the plans call for the party to
feature a nationally-known rock band, two pro
fessional San Francisco comedians and the Stan
ford Band.
Several years ago, the University held all
campus parties at the beginning of the academic
year. In the past few years, however, the Office of
Residential Education has been organizing the
parties for freshmen only, according to Durkin.
The ASSU party will be free of charge to all stu
dents, he said.
The proposal to fund the party was approved by
a unanimous 7-0 vote at the summer meeting.
The ASSU Constitution requires that six of the
20 voting members of the senate be present to
make senate decisions.
Originally set for $11,333, a friendly amend

ment proposed by COP member Leonard Adler
reduced the party budget to $10,000 in order to
ensure its passage, according to COP Assistant
Cindy Wurtenberg.
"[The party] reflects a change in the ASSU,"
Durkin said. "In the past a lot of money has been
spent indirectly on the student body — for exam
ple renovating the ASSU office — and now we're
trying to do a bit more direct spending."
The senate committee also discussed a proposal
to televise future senate meetings. The first
telecast would be a trial run, Durkin said.
A decision on the proposal was put off until the
fall, since not all senate members attended
Thursday's meeting. "This is more an issue for a
full senate to discuss," Durkin explained.
The senate will not meet again this summer,
Wurtenberg said, as Senate Chair Joe Smolen
decided to call only one meeting.
Durkin said the ASSU would like to poll stu
dents to see if they would watch televised senate
meetings.
