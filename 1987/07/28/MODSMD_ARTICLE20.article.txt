## Boston launches 'Third Stage' tour 
### DREW ERICKSON 
Many fans were skeptical no doubt
after buying tickets to see Boston, one of
rock's powerhouses of the 19705. The
band had, after all, been practically in
visible since 1978 until the release of
their "Third Stage" album last October.
After their sell-out concert Saturday
night, the first of three at the Oakland
Coliseum Arena, let there be no doubt:
Boston is back.
Farrenheit, a mediocre heavy metal
band, opened the evening with a
depressing performance. But then Bos
ton took the stage by storm, kicking off
the show with the semi-autobiographical
"Rock 'n' Roll Band" from their first al
bum.
In a surprisingly uncommercial
gesture, the band led with a half-dozen
songs from their first two albums before
moving on to newer material. After
nearly two hours of blistering high en
ergy rock 'n' roll — complete with four
encores — Boston closed with, quite fit
tingly/Tarty."
Boston's "Third Stage" tour marks
possibly the longest-awaited comeback
in rock history. In 1975, in the middle of
the disco era, Boston burst onto the
scene with a rough-edged sound that to
this day has never been matched. They
were, for their time, one of the few rays
of hope for true rock fans. Their debut al
bum, simply titled "Boston," was the

year's biggest seller, fueled by songs like
'More Than A Feeling," "Peace of Mind"
and "Long Time."
Their 1978 follow-up album, "Don't
Look Back," was no less successful and
established Boston as the rock super
group of the decade. Then, mysteriously,
Boston vanished from sight. The only
signs that the band was still active were

a few items in the news about litigation
and rampant rumors in music channels
of a third Boston album "in the studio."
The band had reached almost legen
dary status in the "where are they now?"
category by October of 1986 when,
practically unannounced, CBS Records
released the "Third Stage" album and
the legend was reborn.

Despite a few changes in lineup, the
band's original core is intact. Singer
Brad Delp and drummer Jim Masdea
return along with the band's heart and
soul: guitarist, keyboardist, producer
and songwriter Tom Scholz.
Scholz, an electrical engineer with a
degree or two from MIT, is a technical
wizard who performs with more special

guitar effects than most listeners can
keep track of. He has been the group's
mastermind since its inception.
The light show was downplayed a bit
from the spectacular ones that made the
group famous, but it was nonetheless
outstanding. The band's poise and
onstage energy were certainly not rusty
from the many years of inactivity.

Rather, the band members seemed anx
ious to make up for lost time.
Perhaps the most impressive aspect of
this concert was its emotional range.
The band fired up the crowd with rockers
like "Feelin' Satisfied" and "Don't Look
Back," and took time to show a tender
side with ballads like "My Destination"
and "To Be A Man."
Their classics were there, satisfying
those who have followed the band since
their debut, as were their new hits like
"Amanda," "Cantcha Say" and "Cool the
Engines."
Relying minimally on solos by individ
ual band members, Boston wasted no
time blazing from song to song at a
furious pace, pleasing a very diverse au
dience. Right down to the final encore,
the band had the audience in the palms
of their collective hands.
Despite the skepticism of some critics
at the release of "Third Stage," this con
cert was unmistakably Boston. They had
the energy, they had the songs and they
had Brad Delp's inimitable voice. Above
all, though, they had the rough-edged,
pure rock 'n' roll guitar sound that made
them revolutionary in the mid-70s.
Boston brought back a sound that
many had given up for dead. Those who
were fortunate enough to attend no
doubt left the concert "Feelin' Satisfied."
Boston's gave a second performance on
Sunday. The band takes off again
tonight at 8 p.m. in the Oakland
Coliseum.
