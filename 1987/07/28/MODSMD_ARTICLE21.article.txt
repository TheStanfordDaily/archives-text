# Health food restaurant makes customers feel at home
## 
### NANNETTE THOMPSON 
Health food is no longer only
for marathon runners or Zen
gurus. Natural food such as
that served at the Blue Sky
Cafe in Mountain View can be
enjoyed by everyone. The res
taurant offers vegetarian food
in a friendly, country-style at
mosphere.
The Blue Sky Cafe is known
for using all-natural ingredi
ents and for its vegetarian fare
ranging from Indian Curry to
the popular Eggplant-Almond
Enchilada.
According to veteran em
ployee Kim Le, many of the
vegetables in season are grown
in the cafe's own backyard, and

honey is used as a sweetner in
recipes instead of sugar.
Le believes that what makes
the cafe special is not only the
natural food but also the atti
tude of the workers and the
owner, Anna Douglas, who
started the restaurant after
spending time in India explor
ing her interest in organic food.
"Our real purpose is not to
make money, but to care for the
people who eat here and for
their health," Le said.
Accordingly, the restaurant's
atmosphere is casual and
friendly. "A lot of people coming
to the cafe feel like they are
coming home to eat," said Le.
Instead of being seated by a
hostess, people wander in and

choose their own table. Return
guests are often greeted by
name. The front porch and blue
and beige curtains add to the
homey ambience and are remi
niscent of the fact that Blue Sky
is actually a converted farm
house.
The cafe is an extremely
pleasant place to enjoy Sunday
brunch out-of-doors. Arrive
early because the umbrella
shaded tables only seat a total
of 20 people.
The breakfast offerings in
clude several omlettes, such as
the All-Natural Spanish Cheese
Omlette, which uses cheese
without artificial coloring. Also
served are muffins, cereals,

French toast and a variety of
herbal teas.
The blueberry pancakes are
popular, but not always
available, so call ahead. For
$4.95 one receives a stack of
large whole wheat, pancakes
with a light coating of melted
butter and a container of syrup
on the side. The demand is
great enough that the supply
usually runs out before 11 a.m.

Brunch prices range from $2.95
to $5.50.
Blue Sky's hours are 8:30
a.m. to 9 p.m. Tuesday through
Saturday and 8:30 a.m. to 2:30
p.m. on Sunday. Reservations
are taken for groups of six or
more and for parties in the back
garden.
The Blue Sky Cafe is located
at 336 Bryant in Mountain
View.
