### 
McEnroe, Mayotte
falter in Davis Cup
Former Stanford stars Tim
Mayotte and John McEnroe
weren't enough to defeat West
Germany in last weekend's
Davis Cup regulation round
match in Hartford, Conn.
Boris Becker, the two-time
Wimbledon champion, defeated
Mayotte, 6-3, 6-3, 5-7, 4-6, 6-2,
on Sunday to give West Ger
many a 3-2 victory and knock
the U.S. out of the World Group
in Davis Cup play.
The United States will play
in the American Zone in 1988
and will have no chance to actu
ally win the cup. Only the 16
teams in the World Group com
pete for the prestigious trophy.
This is the first time the United
States has been relegated to
zonal play since the competition
first introduced it in 1981.
Becker was overpowering in
the first two sets of his match
with Mayotte. During one
stretch he won 22 straight
points on serve.
Eventually Mayotte worked
his way into the match, though.
He began to serve well and was

able to capture the third and
fourth sets. But Becker didn't
quit. He broke Mayotte's serve
twice in the fifth set to capture
the match.
In a way it was remarkable
the U.S. team forced a fifth
match. On Friday the West Ger
mans captured both opening
singles matches and led 2-0.
Eric Jelen upset Mayotte, 6-8,
6-2, 1-6, 6-3, 6-2 in the first
match. Then Becker defeated
McEnroe in a six-and-one-half
hour marathon, 4-6, 15-13, 8-
10, 6-2, 6-2. There are no tie
breakers in Davis Cup play so
each set must be won by a two
game margin.
McEnroe pulled the U.S.
team even on Sunday by defeat
ing Jelen, 7-5, 6-2, 6-1. Then
Becker beat Mayotte to elimi
nate the United States.
Cook and Leiker
sign NFL contracts
Toi Cook had to make a
similar choice to the one made
by Bo Jackson two years ago:
Should he play baseball or foot
ball? As most people know,
Jackson chose baseball, though

he has since picked up football
as a hobby.
Cook, however, went the
other way and is headed
straight for the NFL. The 6-
foot, 188-pound cornerback was
selected by the New Orleans
Saints in the eighth round of

this year's draft. He came to
terms with the Saints on
Friday.
Cook had seven interceptions
for the Cardinal football team
last year despite missing
several games due to injuries.
Last spring, Cook played cen
terfield for the baseball team
and helped lead them to their

first-ever College World Series
championship.
Considered to be a prospect in
both sports, Cook was drafted
by the Minnesota Twins in the
ninth round of the baseball
draft. Cook's decision was made
easier by the fact that Minne
sota's monetary offer didn't
impress him. "It wasn't a sub
stantial offer," Cook said. "My
decison was made for me."
Tony Leiker, another mem
ber of the 1986 football team,
signed a contract with the
Green Bay Packers. The 6-5,
250-pound defensive lineman
had seven sacks last year.
Leiker was forced to miss the
Gator Bowl, however, after test
ing positive for steriod use. He
was drafted in the seventh
round.
Wassenaar pitching
well, others struggle
The numbers Rob Wassen
nar put up while pitching at
Stanford suggested that the
right-hander had a future in
baseball. He was one-third of an
inning short of winning the
Pacific 10 Conference ERA title
last year and was a key member
of the pitching staff that led the
Cardinal to the CWS champion
ship.
Wassenaar was drafted by
the California Angels and as
signed to their Class A affiliate
in Salem, Ore. So far he has ap
peared in 10 games and pitched
23 innings, compiling a 1-1
record in the process.
More impressively, he has
only allowed 23 hits and eight

walks, while striking out 30
batters.
Things aren't going as well
for former teammate A 1 Osuna.
Pitching in the Houston organi
zation, Osuna's ERA is a
massive 8.71. On the bright
side, it is down nearly six runs
from two weeks ago.
Outfielder Ruben Amaro is
hitting a paltry .214 playing for
the same team as Wassenaar.
Shortstop David Esquer, whose
playing time with the Bal
timore Orioles farm team has
been limited by injuries, is bat
ting only .158.
Swimmers set sights
on Seoul Olympics
The U.S. Swimming Long
Course National Champion
ships began yesterday in Clovis,
Calif. For some of Stanford's top
swimmers success there is the
first step on the long road to the
1988 Summer Olympics in
Seoul, South Korea.
"Most of the athletes who are
going to be on the Olympic team
will be there, rested and ready,"
said men's swimming Coach
Skip Kenney. Kenney is also
coaching the Pan American
games squad. The meet
qualifies swimmers for the Pan
Am and Pan Pacific games.
The top two finishers will
head for next month's Pan
Pacific games in Brisbane,
Australia. Stanford's best hopes
to make the trip down under are
Jenna Johnson, Michelle
Griglione and recent graduates
Susan Rapp and Pablo Morales.

able to capture the third and
fourth sets. But Becker didn't
quit. He broke Mayotte's serve
twice in the fifth set to capture
the match.
In a way it was remarkable
the U.S. team forced a fifth
match. On Friday the West Ger
mans captured both opening
singles matches and led 2-0.
Eric Jelen upset Mayotte, 6-8,
6-2, 1-6, 6-3, 6-2 in the first
match. Then Becker defeated
McEnroe in a six-and-one-half
hour marathon, 4-6, 15-13, 8-
10, 6-2, 6-2. There are no tie
breakers in Davis Cup play so
each set must be won by a two
game margin.
McEnroe pulled the U.S.
team even on Sunday by defeat
ing Jelen, 7-5, 6-2, 6-1. Then
Becker beat Mayotte to elimi
nate the United States.
Cook and Leiker
sign NFL contracts
Toi Cook had to make a
similar choice to the one made
by Bo Jackson two years ago:
Should he play baseball or foot
ball? As most people know,
Jackson chose baseball, though

he has since picked up football
as a hobby.
Cook, however, went the
other way and is headed
straight for the NFL. The 6-
foot, 188-pound cornerback was
selected by the New Orleans
Saints in the eighth round of

this year's draft. He came to
terms with the Saints on
Friday.
Cook had seven interceptions
for the Cardinal football team
last year despite missing
several games due to injuries.
Last spring, Cook played cen
terfield for the baseball team
and helped lead them to their

first-ever College World Series
championship.
Considered to be a prospect in
both sports, Cook was drafted
by the Minnesota Twins in the
ninth round of the baseball
draft. Cook's decision was made
easier by the fact that Minne
sota's monetary offer didn't
impress him. "It wasn't a sub
stantial offer," Cook said. "My
decison was made for me."
Tony Leiker, another mem
ber of the 1986 football team,
signed a contract with the
Green Bay Packers. The 6-5,
250-pound defensive lineman
had seven sacks last year.
Leiker was forced to miss the
Gator Bowl, however, after test
ing positive for steriod use. He
was drafted in the seventh
round.
Wassenaar pitching
well, others struggle
The numbers Rob Wassen
nar put up while pitching at
Stanford suggested that the
right-hander had a future in
baseball. He was one-third of an
inning short of winning the
Pacific 10 Conference ERA title
last year and was a key member
of the pitching staff that led the
Cardinal to the CWS champion
ship.
Wassenaar was drafted by
the California Angels and as
signed to their Class A affiliate
in Salem, Ore. So far he has ap
peared in 10 games and pitched
23 innings, compiling a 1-1
record in the process.
More impressively, he has
only allowed 23 hits and eight

walks, while striking out 30
batters.
Things aren't going as well
for former teammate A 1 Osuna.
Pitching in the Houston organi
zation, Osuna's ERA is a
massive 8.71. On the bright
side, it is down nearly six runs
from two weeks ago.
Outfielder Ruben Amaro is
hitting a paltry .214 playing for
the same team as Wassenaar.
Shortstop David Esquer, whose
playing time with the Bal
timore Orioles farm team has
been limited by injuries, is bat
ting only .158.
Swimmers set sights
on Seoul Olympics
The U.S. Swimming Long
Course National Champion
ships began yesterday in Clovis,
Calif. For some of Stanford's top
swimmers success there is the
first step on the long road to the
1988 Summer Olympics in
Seoul, South Korea.
"Most of the athletes who are
going to be on the Olympic team
will be there, rested and ready,"
said men's swimming Coach
Skip Kenney. Kenney is also
coaching the Pan American
games squad. The meet
qualifies swimmers for the Pan
Am and Pan Pacific games.
The top two finishers will
head for next month's Pan
Pacific games in Brisbane,
Australia. Stanford's best hopes
to make the trip down under are
Jenna Johnson, Michelle
Griglione and recent graduates
Susan Rapp and Pablo Morales.

There was never any question
that Toi Cook was happy
wearing his Stanford baseball
cap. But, the cornerback has
decided he will be even happier
in a New Orleans Saints helmet.
McEnroe, Mayotte
falter in Davis Cup
Former Stanford stars Tim
Mayotte and John McEnroe
weren't enough to defeat West
Germany in last weekend's
Davis Cup regulation round
match in Hartford, Conn.
Boris Becker, the two-time
Wimbledon champion, defeated
Mayotte, 6-3, 6-3, 5-7, 4-6, 6-2,
on Sunday to give West Ger
many a 3-2 victory and knock
the U.S. out of the World Group
in Davis Cup play.
The United States will play
in the American Zone in 1988
and will have no chance to actu
ally win the cup. Only the 16
teams in the World Group com
pete for the prestigious trophy.
This is the first time the United
States has been relegated to
zonal play since the competition
first introduced it in 1981.
Becker was overpowering in
the first two sets of his match
with Mayotte. During one
stretch he won 22 straight
points on serve.
Eventually Mayotte worked
his way into the match, though.
He began to serve well and was

able to capture the third and
fourth sets. But Becker didn't
quit. He broke Mayotte's serve
twice in the fifth set to capture
the match.
In a way it was remarkable
