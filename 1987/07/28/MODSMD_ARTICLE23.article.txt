Summer college to address
power of the presidency
Political Science Prof. Alexander
George will discuss the "power problem"
of the presidency Aug. 13 and 14 at the
Stanford Summer College program on
leadership. The program runs from Aug.
9 to 13.
Since the 19305, presidential responsi
bilities, tasks and duties have grown
overwhelmingly, according to George.
At the same time, George argues, a
belief has evolved that the president is
the "engine of progress" and the corner
stone of the national government, thus
creating a gap between what the presi
dent is expected to accomplish and his
actual ability to deliver.
Watergate and the Iran-contra scan
dal have complicated this process, re
sulting in a "power problem" for the
presidency that has forced political sci
entists and historians to re-examine the

idea of a "strong presidency," he said.
According to George, in the past "We
were more interested in doing what was
necessary to enhance the performance of
the president and were less concerned
about his accountability."
"It seems clear that the Reagan
presidency has lost a good deal of its in
formal power and authority and has not
been able to maintain momentum
through use of formal presidential power
alone," George said.
According to George, the president's
job has become so complex and demand
ing that it is difficult to describe in con
crete terms. Therefore, the ability of any
incumbent president to perform effec
tively and consistently is questionable.
The program will address the topic of
leadership through the perspectives of
history, literature, art, music and the so
cial sciences. Six Stanford professors will
be on the faculty.

GSB grads will attempt to
climb Mount Everest
Two graduates of the Business School
are among 15 Americans planning to
climb the world's tallest mountain this
fall.
Samuel Belk, who received his MBA
from the Graduate School of Business in
1975, and Ben Tolund, who earned his
MBA in June, are part of the 1987 Amer
ican North Face Expedition, which will
attempt to scale Mount Everest from the
remote Tibetan side in September and
October.
The climbers plan to follow a techni
cally difficult route up the face of
Everest. The route was closed from the
1930s until 1981.
The group received permission to
make the climb from the Chinese gov
ernment more than two years ago.
Nearly $250,000 has since been raised to
pay for the animals that will carry the

team's 6,000 pounds of equipment to the
advanced base camp at 19,000 feet.
There are five women on the team,
any of whom could become the first
American woman to reach the top of
Everest. The group is hoping that one to
four climbers will make it to the summit
of 29,028-foot Everest.
"Our goal is to get someone to the top,"
Toland said. "I don't have an emotional
attachment to making it to the top. If
others in our party make it and I don't, it
will still be a success for me."
The team will not use Nepalese
Sherpa guides, often used on mountain
climbs, because the guides do not regu
larly work in Tibet. Expedition members
will use skis to to take supplies to Camp
One at 20,500 feet, and from there will
use crampons and rope.
"I'd like to say I'm a mountaineer first
and an MBA and a bond salesman
second," Belk said.
