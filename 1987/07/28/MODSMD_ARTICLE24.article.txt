## Corrections 
### 
An article in Friday's Daily
incorrectly attributed informa
tion that the seclusion and lack
of central dining facilities at the
Manzanita trailers hurts social
life there, and that toilet paper
litters Manzanita's grounds, to
Jerry Pape.
Pape made no such asser
tions.
The article also stated that
living in Manzanita is not easy
and that Manzanita has become
a last-choice residence without
checking the accuracy of that
information or properly identi
fying the sources.
A photo caption in Friday's
Daily said the decision in Zur
cher v. Daily brought about
many newsroom searches. The
decision has instead brought
about many non-suspect, third
party searches.
These searches include the
offices of doctors, lawyers and
clergy, not primarily
newsrooms.
A front page photo in Friday's
Daily gave the impression that
The Daily was searched by
police in riot gear in 1971. The
officers who entered The Daily
did not wear riot gear.
Finally, an article in Friday's
Daily misspelled the names of
Sgt. Nick Brunot and longtime
Daily friend Bob Beyers.
The Daily regrets the errors.
