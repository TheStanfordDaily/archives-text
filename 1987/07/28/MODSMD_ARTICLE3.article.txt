# Row may get computers
## 
### CHRIS CRADER Staff writer 
The Row may soon receive some long
awaited computer clusters from the Of
fice of Residential Education, according
to Jeff Merriman, the office's computer
administrator.
Clusters of Digital Equipment Corpo
ration (DEC) Rainbow computers will be
installed in Row houses as early as this
summer. The computers will have word
processing and data base capabilities but
will not be connected to LOTS, Mer
riman said yesterday.
Res Ed has installed computer clusters
in most campus dorms but has been
unable to service the Row due to physi
cal problems of distance and the fact that
the individual Row houses are too small
to warrant the large expenditures neces
sary, Merriman said.
The Rainbows, while they are suitable
for "everything a student could want,"
are not as expandable as other systems,
Merriman said.
Many of the Rainbow clusters in
dorms have been replaced by IBM
clusters. Those Rainbows can be used

elsewhere, he said. "I hope to take many
of the DEC Rainbows and put them into
Row locations."
The locations have not yet been selec
ted, Merriman said, but added that the
goal is to establish a few clusters on the
Row in central locations, where resi
dents of other Row houses can easily
reach them.
The University now has three differ
ent types of computer clusters on
campus: Rainbows, IBMs and Macin
toshes. There are 14 IBM clusters, three
Macintosh clusters and four Rainbow
clusters.
According to Merriman, the fact that
Row houses are not connected to SUNet,
the University's cable system, presents
an obstacle to extending computer
services.
SUNet, in addition to carrying televi
sion channels, is used to hook computers
to LOTS, SOCRATES and other com
puter networks. Because SUNet is not
available on the Row, neither are these
resources.
"The main reason that we haven't set
up the Row (with clusters) is
that we haven't been able to get
SUNet into the Row," Mer
riman said.
According to Ron Roberts of
the Networking Department,
SUNet was not originally put
into the Row houses because of
the difficulty in accessing the
Row with the necessary cables,
and because the cost-per
student-served ratio was much
higher there than in the dorms.

The original funding for
SUNet was provided by the
Board of Trustees with the in
tention of establishing the capa
bility to broadcast classes and a
student cable television chan
nel to residences. The funds
have already been used up for
the near-campus area and there
is presently no money available
for SUNet extension to the Row,
Roberts said.
The system may expand par
tially to the Row, however, if a
way is found to fund the expan
sion, Roberts said.
SUNet is composed of a base
band, handling computer inter

face on systems such as LOTS
and SOCRATES, and a broad
band, used for television.
Roberts said his department
will look in to the feasibility of
expanding the broad base to the
Row, and using one or more of
the broadcast channels as a
computer interface.
"If there is a funding source,
we certainly have no problem
with [expanding the broad
base]," he said.
According to Gene Yep, a net
working consultant, the expan
sion is not yet on the drawing
board. "At the present time, I

don't think there are any
plans.. .. After [the Centennial
fund-raising campaign] I think
they will have plans (to explore
adding broad base to the Row.)
A lot of this is dependent on the
Centennial campaign," Yep
said.
A broad base expansion could
open the door for full-fledged
Res Ed computer clusters on the
Row, according to Merriman.
He also said the success of the
new Mirrielees computer
cluster might encourage the
Row office to assist in bringing
in clusters.
