# Row may get computers

The Row may soon receive some long
awaited computer clusters from the Of
fice of Residential Education, according
to Jeff Merriman, the office's computer
administrator.
Clusters of Digital Equipment Corpo
ration (DEC) Rainbow computers will be
installed in Row houses as early as this
summer. The computers will have word
processing and data base capabilities but
will not be connected to LOTS, Mer
riman said yesterday.
Res Ed has installed computer clusters
in most campus dorms but has been
unable to service the Row due to physi
cal problems of distance and the fact that
the individual Row houses are too small
to warrant the large expenditures neces
sary, Merriman said.
The Rainbows, while they are suitable
for "everything a student could want,"
are not as expandable as other systems,
Merriman said.
Many of the Rainbow clusters in
dorms have been replaced by IBM
clusters. Those Rainbows can be used

elsewhere, he said. "I hope to take many
of the DEC Rainbows and put them into
Row locations."
The locations have not yet been selec
ted, Merriman said, but added that the
goal is to establish a few clusters on the
Row in central locations, where resi
dents of other Row houses can easily
reach them.
The University now has three differ
ent types of computer clusters on
campus: Rainbows, IBMs and Macin
toshes. There are 14 IBM clusters, three
Macintosh clusters and four Rainbow
clusters.
According to Merriman, the fact that
Row houses are not connected to SUNet,
the University's cable system, presents
an obstacle to extending computer
services.
SUNet, in addition to carrying televi
sion channels, is used to hook computers
to LOTS, SOCRATES and other com
puter networks. Because SUNet is not
available on the Row, neither are these
resources.
"The main reason that we haven't set
