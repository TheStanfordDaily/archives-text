# Connecting road to El Camino
## Cities to study Sand Hill link 
### ERIN MARTIN Staff writer 
After more than 25 years of
controversy, representatives
from Stanford, Palo Alto and
Menlo Park have taken new ini
tiative in constructing a con
necting road between Sand Hill
Road and El Camino Real.
At a meeting held Thursday
by the Palo Alto City Council,
the three groups organized an
exploratory committee to study
the possibility of extending the
roadway on University land be
tween the Stanford Shopping
Center and San Francisquito
Creek.
Bob Freelen, Stanford vice
president for public affairs and
a committee member, explained
that the University is in favor
of the road primarily for safety
reasons.
"The flow of traffic as it exists
now is unsafe for Stanford
employees, students and
anyone else who uses the road,"
he said.
At present, traffic from Sand
Hill Road is channeled through
the Stanford Shopping Center
parking lot to the center's en
trance on to El Camino Real.
Palo Alto city manager and
committee organizer Bill Zaner
said he is confident the group
can succeed in bringing about
construction of the roadway. "I
think this time we, as a commit
tee, are better able to examine
the very different interests of
Stanford, Palo Alto and Menlo
Park and reconcile the contro
versy that may arise," he said.
Public debate, which has
prevented construction of the
connector, stems from concerns
about increased traffic and en
vironmental problems, particu
larly with reference to the San
Francisquito Creek, which bor
ders Palo Alto and Menlo Park.
The committee, which still re

quires official support of the in
dividual city councils and the
Stanford Board of Trustees, con
sists of two members each from
Stanford, Palo Alto and Menlo
Park.
Jan La Fetra, committee
member and Menlo Park city
councilwoman, said that the
committee is "clearly at the ad
visory stage.
"This is a fresh start with
new ideas and a new approach,"
she said. "We are going to ap
proach this in a very relaxed
manner in order to explore all
potential problems. It may take
two years, if not more."
Pending approval from the
councils, which according to
Zaner is "very likely," Stanford
will fund up to $50,000 for a
study to examine traffic and en
vironmental problems that
could result from the proposed
extension.
According to Kent Peterson,
University vice president for
business, the University is
"very interested" in the project
and "would not object to using
that land for a road."
The most recent attempt to
join the two roads was halted by
a lawsuit filed by citizens of
Menlo Park that charged envi
ronmental surveys were not
thorough enough. The city won
the case and the project was
temporarily abandoned.
"I think we should put history
behind us and discuss the cor
ridor from a new perspective,"
said La Fetra.
Other committee members
include Mayor Gail Woolley
and councilman Leland Levy,
both of Palo Alto, councilman
Calvin Jones of Menlo Park and
William Massy, Stanford vice
president for business and
finance.
The committee has not set a
date for its next meeting.
