# Economists defend findings of comparable worth study
## 
### BRIAN RHOADS Staff writer 
Stanford economists who conducted
a two-year study on the effects of a
nationwide comparable worth policy
responded critically yesterday to a un
ion official's recent dispute of their
findings.
The study, which was completed
last December, revealed that the
private sector would generally suffer
from the implementation of a national
comparable worth program, through
which employers would be required to
offer equal pay to women and men for
jobs of comparable worth.
In a recent New York Times article,
Diana Rock, director of women's
rights at the American Federation of
State, County and Municipal
Employees, disputed their predictions
of a redistribution of wealth from men

to women and higher unemployment
upon implementation of the program.
Rock said that in the dozen state
governments where pay equity is in
effect, "I can't think of any where
men's salaries were reduced to
achieve equity. In fact, we contend
that it is illegal."
Furthermore, she said, there has
been no increased unemployment un
der pay equity in states where govern
ment is the largest employer.
Rock argued that if a drop in em
ployment and output "didn't happen
in the public sector, why would it hap
pen in the private sector?"
B. Douglas Bernheim, associate
professor of economics and co-author
of the study, called the dispute a
"naive" one, on the grounds that the
statistics Rock cited were results of a
local and not a nationwide pro
gram.
Bernheim said Rock referred
to state and local government
sponsored programs, while the
private sector, operating on
"different incentives — such as
profit — would react differ
ently."
Bernheim placed part of the
blame on the New York Times,
saying that it listed specific fig
ures, giving the readers a "false
sense of precision." The
economists presented the statis
tics as ranges.
The ranges of numbers
resulted from several different

cases, with variables based on
discrimination, productivity
differences and the dynamics of
married couples' decision
making, according to Perry
Beider, a graduate student who
participated in the study.
The study made no recom
mendations for reducing men's
salaries to achieve equity. The
redistribution referred to would
occur through the dynamics of
the economic market, Beider
said.
"The Times was correct in its
report, but the numbers they in
dicated were only of our
'standard case.' " Beider added.
The Times reported that
"GNP would fall by 1.6 percent

and employment by 2.5 per
cent." The study actually found
that with implementation of the
comparable worth program,
GNP could fall anywhere be
tween "0.8 and 5.5 percent."
Beider said one of the most
interesting results of the analy
sis was that "single women are
big winners as a group," indi
cated by a general improvement
in < their income. However,
single women should also suffer
unemployment, due to the pos
sible increase of married
women looking for jobs or to
possible discrimination against
women by employers, he said.
The analysis showed also that
"married households as a whole
lose the most" under a

nationwide comparable worth
program, Beider said.
"We never made any value
judgements on the comparable
worth program in our study,"
said Bernheim. The problem is
that newspaper people "contact
the implementers of this policy
for dispute and invariably [the
implementors] say something
naive, as they work on a
minutia of the policy and don't
look at the global picture."
No competing study currently
exists, Bernheim said. "There
has been criticism of the meth
odology, but as of yet no one's
taken the step to correct the
false methodology" in any rival
study.
