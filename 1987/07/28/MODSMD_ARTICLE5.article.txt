Stanford economists who conducted
a two-year study on the effects of a
nationwide comparable worth policy
responded critically yesterday to a un

findings.
The study, which was completed
last December, revealed that the
private sector would generally suffer
from the implementation of a national
comparable worth program, through
which employers would be required to
offer equal pay to women and men for
jobs of comparable worth.
In a recent New York Times article,
Diana Rock, director of women's
rights at the American Federation of
State, County and Municipal
Employees, disputed their predictions
of a redistribution of wealth from men

to women and higher unemployment
upon implementation of the program.
Rock said that in the dozen state
governments where pay equity is in
effect, "I can't think of any where
men's salaries were reduced to
achieve equity. In fact, we contend
that it is illegal."
Furthermore, she said, there has
been no increased unemployment un
der pay equity in states where govern
ment is the largest employer.
Rock argued that if a drop in em
ployment and output "didn't happen
in the public sector, why would it hap
pen in the private sector?"
B. Douglas Bernheim, associate
professor of economics and co-author
of the study, called the dispute a
"naive" one, on the grounds that the
statistics Rock cited were results of a
