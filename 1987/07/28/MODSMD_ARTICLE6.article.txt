Meese set to testify on arms scandal
WASHINGTON — Two days before Attorney General
Edwin Meese 111 told a nationally televised news conference
last November that the U.S. government had not been in
volved in a 1985 Israeli arms shipment to Iran, he was told by
White House aide Oliver North that the CIA had directly par
ticipated in the deal, according to handwritten notes of their
meeting.
That discrepancy between what Meese said in the news
conference and what he had learned during a weekend fact
finding inquiry into the Iran-contra affair is one of many sub
jects on which the attorney general is expected to face ques
tioning this morning when he testifies before the congres
sional Iran-contra committees.
During the hastily called Nov. 25 news conference in the
White House briefing room, Meese disclosed that profits from
direct U.S. arms sales to Iran had been diverted to the
Nicaraguan contras but stated that Israel's two 1985 ship
ments "did not involve, at that time, the United States."
Terry Eastland, a spokesman for Meese, said yesterday
that the attorney general used the phrase "not involved" to
mean that the U.S. government had not "organized the trans
action. It was an Israeli project."
Shultz to meet with Shevardnadze
WASHINGTON — Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard
Shevardnadze and Secretary of State George Shultz are ex
pected to meet here in mid-September to discuss arms control
and other matters, U.S. officials said yesterday.
The effect of the meeting date, which is about one month
later than the United States had proposed, will probably be to
push the next U.S.-Soviet summit into November or later.
Soviet Ambassador Yuri Dubinin told Shultz yesterday
that Shevardnadze proposed visiting Washington 10 days to
two weeks before the United Nations General Assembly in
late September. No firm date was set, but the Soviet
timetable is likely to be accepted, officials said.
The United States had suggested a Shultz-Shevardnadze
meeting in late July or August, with the prospect of an Sep
tember or October summit if all went well.
Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev last week removed the
biggest hurdle to an arms agreement by offering to agree to
eliminate all intermediate-range nuclear missiles — those
with a range of 300 to 3,000 miles — on either side.
White House spokesman blasts press
HARTFORD, Wis. — White House spokesman Marlin
Fitzwater, responding to news reports that President Ronald
Reagan led an effort to conceal details of Iranian arms-and
hostages dealings in November, angrily declared yesterday:
I frankly think that some members of the press are so
hungry to try to destroy the president that they've lost all
perspective."
He was apparently referring to stories reporting that
Reagan led an effort in November to conceal the details about
arms dealing with Iran in an effort to salvage the program
after press disclosures about it. The articles were based on
notes taken at a White House meeting Nov. 10, 1986, by Al
ton Keel Jr., then deputy national security adviser.
According to the notes, which were released last week by
the congressional committees investigating the Iran-contra
affair, the president told his assistants that "we don't talk
TOWs, don't talk specifics." TOWs are the U.S. anti-tank
missiles that were delivered to Iran in the effort to free
Americans held hostage by pro-Iranian terrorists in Lebanon.
Fitzwater, who said Reagan took this action out of concern
for the lives of American hostages, made his pointed com- •
ments to reporters aboard Air Force One on a trip to Wiscon
sin. Reagan made speeches in three small cities north of Mil
waukee as part of his summer-long drive to draw public sup
port on economic issues at a time when much of the nation's
attention remains locked on the Iran-contra hearings.
Stark officers take blame for attack
WASHINGTON — The skipper and the tactical weapons
officer of the USS Stark yesterday accepted accountability for
the vessel's "lack of readiness" when it was hit by two Iraqi
missiles May 17 in a Persian Gulf attack that killed 37
sailors.
A Navy spokesman said both officers were given a letter of
reprimand and that the skipper, Glenn Brindel, had re
quested retirement while Lt. Basil Moncrief Jr. had submit
ted his resignation.
The action was taken by Adm. Frank Kelso 11, commander
of the Atlantic Fleet, who opted to hold an "Admiral's Mast"
and administer non-judicial punishment rather than send
Brindel and Moncrief before a general court-martial.
Neither of the officers was present for the proceeding at At
lantic Fleet headquarters in Norfolk, Va., Monday morning.
Officials said Brindel would be retired as a commander be
cause he had not served the requisite three years to make him
eligible for retirment as captain and thus would lose about
$100,000 in retirement pay.
