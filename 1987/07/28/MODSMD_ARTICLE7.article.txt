# Aquino: Democracy is in danger

### 
MANILA, Philippines —
Philippine President Corazon
Aquino yesterday used her
state-of-the-nation speech at
the inaugural session of the
new Congress to level a sharp
criticism at the international
lending community for refusing
to grant more concessional
repayment terms for the
country's $28 billion foreign
debt.
In a 35-minute address to
mark the country's final pas
sage from strong-man rule,
Aquino also sounded a tough
call against threats to the new
democracy, including "total
itarian slavery on the left and
reversion to fascist terror and
corruption on the right." She
urged the new Congress to
make "a sober assessment of
(the) adequacy" of the military
and the need to increase defense
spending so the army can be
better equipped to meet the
threats.
The Congress opened yester
day amid extraordinary secu

rity precautions.
Hundreds of leftist and right
wing demonstrators staged
protest marches and there were
rumors of another possible coup
attempt by followers of deposed
president Ferdinand Marcos.
Brig. Gen. Alexander Aguirre,
chief of the military capital
command, said a total of 3,000
military and police personnel
had been
Aquino's speech was
delivered before a joint session
at the complex that housed the
old Marcos-dominated parlia
ment, which last year
proclaimed Marcos the official
winner of the 1986 "snap" presi
dential election. Aquino yester
day called that action "the dic
tatorship's last mockery of
democracy."
Yesterday's first session of
the two chambers elected May
11 restored the U.S.-style
Congress that Marcos abolished
under martial law in 1972.
Aquino reserved some of her

harshest words for the country's
international lenders, mostly
American private banks led bv
Citibank.
Our extraordinary achieve
ment in fulfilling the first re
quirement of renegotiation —.
the establishment of free and
responsible government —
gained us applause but no sub
stantial accommodation from
our foreign creditors," Aquino
said.
Earlier this month, the
Philippines and more than 400
creditor banks formally signed
an agreement rescheduling
$13.2 billion of the country's
$28 billion foreign debt.
The saga of democracy had
made great television, but no
appreciable change on their
business priorities," she said.
"We were treated not much bet
ter than other debtors, even
those who had rejected the aus
tere discipline mandated by re
structuring."
