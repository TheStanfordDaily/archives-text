## Iranian immigrants face hostility, psychologist says 
### NASSRINE AZIMI 
Many Iranian immigrants feel psyc
hologically disoriented in the United
States and have difficulty adjusting to
their new role as a minority in a hostile
culture, an Iranian psychologist said
here Saturday.
Mohammed Ali Oveissi, a psychologist
at the University of Santa Clara, spoke
before about 200 Iranian nationals,
many young of them professionals, at
Dinkelspiel Auditorium.
"Though many Iranians have faced
drastic changes in social and financial
standing, they are still one of the best
educated and wealthiest immigrant
groups in the U. 5.," Oveissi said. "But
they are at times subject to media and
public opinion hostility — which often
does not distinguish between the radical
stand of the regime in Tehran and those
Iranians who are here as a result of it."
Oveissi has a private practice in San
Jose where has worked extensively with
Iranian patients since the 1979 Islamic
revolution, headed by the Ayatollah
Ruhollah Khomeini, toppled the Shah
and sent hundreds of thousands of
Iranians into exile.
The Khomeini regime openly partici
pated in many anti-U.S. activities, in
cluding the seizure of the U.S. Embassy
in Tehran in November 1979.
The Reagan administration has
repeatedly charged that most terrorist

activities in the Middle East and
recently in Europe are backed by Iran.
"President Reagan, speaking of Iran
some time ago, described it as a nation of
'barbaric savages' — this of a country
with a 2,500-year-old written history,"
Oveissi said.
"Such thoughtless remarks create dis
dain among Americans for the Iranian
culture and humilate Iranians living
here. They are ashamed at being
Iranians but can hardly relate to the
American culture. The result is a classi
cal case of identity crisis," he said.
The psychologist said Iranians lack
experience as a minority group. "While
Iranian Muslims abroad are coping pain
fully," he said, "other religious
minorities from Iran such as Jews,
Bahais, Assyrians and Zoroastrians are
doing very well, accustomed as they
were to strong community support."
Until the establishment of the Islamic
republic, now ruled by the Shariah
(Islamic religious laws), Iran was one of
the few Middle Eastern havens for reli
gious minorities.
"Iranian women have also better ad
justed to immigrant life abroad," Oveissi
said. "For many of them, this has been
an emancipation of some kind: many
have taken jobs, drive cars, are more in
dependent than ever. Iranian men on the
other hand have lost social status as well
as patriarchal status. Consequently, the
balance of power has completely

changed in the traditional Iranian fam
ily."
As a result, the number of divorces
and separations in the Iranian commu
nity has increased sharply over the last
few years. The effect of this on younger
Iranians can be dramatic, he said.

"Iranians are at times sub
ject to media and public
opinion hostility - which
often does not distinguish
between the radical stand of
the regime in Tehran and
those Iranians who are here
as a result of it."

"Like most second-generation immi
grants here, Iranian youngsters are torn
between the dominant American culture
around them and a native culture at
home they no longer relate to," Oveissi
said. "This tension might lead to vio
lence and crime, as often seen among
other minorities."
Unfortunately, very few studies con
cerning Iranian immigration to the U.S.
have been conducted until now. Figures
on the total immigrant population vary
between 1 million and 2 million with

sharp increases since 1978.
UCLA is currently conducting one of
the first in-depth studies on Iranians in
California. There are more than 300,000
Iranians in Los Angeles — called
'Irangeles' by many natives, Oveissi
said.
According to Haleh Kashani, a
graduate student at the California
School of Professional Psychology in
Berkeley, "The U.S. government is only
starting to recognize Iranians as a
minority group."
Kashani, whose thesis is called "The
Psychological Adjustment to Forced Im
migration," works on a project conducted
by five Iranian women psychologists
who have organized free consultations
for needy compatriots.
"Such centers are now increasing,"
said Kashani, "but the most encouraging
of all is the change taking place in the
Iranian stigma that used to consider psy
chological help to be the resource of the
very mad.
"The real issue is that most Iranian
immigrants are still confused as to
where their country really is. It is a
Catch-22 situation: they cannot go back,
and they cannot stay," Oveissi said.
"To avoid entropy, they must join soci
ety's mainstream. Once they accept the
world they are living in, maybe they will
be able to come to terms with the one
they were forced to leave behind," he
said.
