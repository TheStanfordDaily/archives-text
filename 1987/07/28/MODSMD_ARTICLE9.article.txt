The American public has heard a good deal about the presi
dent's social agenda during the last seven years. Through the
political process, anti-abortion and school prayer legislation,
which would have helped make this agenda a reality, was
defeated. Now Reagan is trying to achieve his dreams by tip
ping the balance on the Supreme Court.
Reagan's nomination of Robert Bork will create a danger
ous turning point. If the conservative judge is approved by
the Senate, the president will be able to make his social
priorities American law.
Today, as the balance of the court leans toward the right,
we look skeptically at arguments proclaiming that ideology
should not be a factor in choosing the court members. These
nine judges make monumental decisions that affect most
areas of our lives. Are we to believe that those decisions do
not reflect their own political and social values?
A fashionable strain of thought claims that Supreme Court
justices should be chosen solely on the basis of their intellec
tual qualifications and honesty. This philosophy has been
popular only for the last two or three decades. Historically,
almost 20 percent of the Supreme Court hopefuls have been
denied, often because their political leanings proved discor
dant with the mood of the times.
Certainly Bork's academic qualifications cannot be ques
tioned with much success. A Yale Law School professor who
turned down a prestigious law firm partnership in 1981 to sit
on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia,
Bork has an impressive resume.
Bork has adequately survived the investigative once-over.
Although he once wrote articles criticizing federal legislation
requiring hotels, bars and restaurants to serve black custom
ers, he has since rescinded many of those opinions.
But Bork is a rigidly ideological man, a strict construc
tionist who does not see rights and privileges in the Constitu
tion unless they are expressly written out. The right to
privacy, which is not named in the Constitution but was
clearly a guiding principle to the drafters of the document
and its amendments, is therefore threatened.
Bork's opposition to the Roe v. Wade abortion ruling and
recent limited affirmative action rulings leave those and
other civil rights decisions with only the precarious prestige
of stare decisis, a position he may move the court to end.
Moreover, Bork's dismissal of Watergate special prosecutor
Archibald Cox reinforces the view of him as a man who
strongly believes in executive power. Between his adherence
to a limited constitution and this veneer for executive pres
tige, his professed validity of legislative action as a means for
decision-making in this country is thrown into doubt.
Bork's replacement of moderate conservative Justice Lewis
Powell would cement Reagan's majority on the highest judi
cial branch in the land. This is the one legal area within gov
ernment that Reagan has been able to significantly populate
with members of the far right. Americans elected Reagan for
eight years. Do they want the Reagan revolution to continue
for another 25?
