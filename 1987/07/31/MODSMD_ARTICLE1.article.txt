Yohei Kono, a member of the Japanese Diet
and a possible candidate for prime minister,
came to campus this week and began informal
meetings with University officials.
Kono's visit is a political one, according to
William Stone, director of the Stanford
Alumni Association. "As I see it, his trip was
sponsored by the Asia Foundation to add to his
future chances at prime minister, much like
(Vice President George) Bush going to Russia,
or (Democratic presidential candidate Mi
chael) Dukakis going to Indiana."
Kono, who in 1960-61 did post-graduate
work here in political science, has visited

Stanford only once since then and wanted to
return, said Professor Emeritus Kurt Steiner,
Kono's graduate adviser.
At a luncheon yesterday with faculty mem
bers and administrators, Kono voiced concern
over trade disputes between Japan and the
United States.
In a brief discussion on U.S.-Japan trade re
lations, Kono expressed concern over growing
nationalism in Japan, "but by inference he
considered the U.S. guilty as well," Stone said.
When asked about the sale of sensitive mili
tary technology to the Soviet Union by the
Japanese firm Toshiba, Kono said he didn't be
lieve it was an isolated incident, according to

Yohei Kono, a member of the Japanese Diet and former science and technology minister, shakes
hands with University President Donald Kennedy yesterday. Kono, who attended graduate
school here, is considered a leading candidate to become prime minister of Japan.
