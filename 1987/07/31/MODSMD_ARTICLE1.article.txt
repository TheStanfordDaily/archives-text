### BRIAN RHOADS Staff writer 
Yohei Kono, a member of the Japanese Diet
and a possible candidate for prime minister,
came to campus this week and began informal
meetings with University officials.
Kono's visit is a political one, according to
William Stone, director of the Stanford
Alumni Association. "As I see it, his trip was
sponsored by the Asia Foundation to add to his
future chances at prime minister, much like
(Vice President George) Bush going to Russia,
or (Democratic presidential candidate Mi
chael) Dukakis going to Indiana."
Kono, who in 1960-61 did post-graduate
work here in political science, has visited

Stanford only once since then and wanted to
return, said Professor Emeritus Kurt Steiner,
Kono's graduate adviser.
At a luncheon yesterday with faculty mem
bers and administrators, Kono voiced concern
over trade disputes between Japan and the
United States.
In a brief discussion on U.S.-Japan trade re
lations, Kono expressed concern over growing
nationalism in Japan, "but by inference he
considered the U.S. guilty as well," Stone said.
When asked about the sale of sensitive mili
tary technology to the Soviet Union by the
Japanese firm Toshiba, Kono said he didn't be
lieve it was an isolated incident, according to

Yohei Kono, a member of the Japanese Diet and former science and technology minister, shakes
hands with University President Donald Kennedy yesterday. Kono, who attended graduate
school here, is considered a leading candidate to become prime minister of Japan.
Political Science Prof. Stephen
Krasner, who attended the lun
cheon.
"Kono considered the Toshiba
question very difficult for the
Japanese government to solve
and prevent [because of the dif
ferent trade styles of the United
States and Japan]," said Bob
Freelan, vice president of public
affairs, who hosted the lun
cheon.

"Kono felt the question of ex
ports to the Soviet Union has
been an ongoing issue between
the U.S. and Japan and will
remain one," Krasner said.
Kono's packed itinerary also
included a visit with Law Prof.
Thomas Heller, director of
Overseas Studies. Heller
briefed Kono on the Stanford
program in Kyoto, which is
tentatively scheduled to open in
the fall of 1988.
Noting Kono's political poten
tial, Heller stated he was
"trying to lobby someone of sub
stantial political influence to
take an active role getting the

program's regulatory structure
worked out."
According to Stone, Kono
warned that "A lot of self
important bureaucrats may
stand in the way."
"However, [Kono] joked that
if rival faction leader Hujime Is
hii made it into office, Ishii
would also be helpful to Stan
ford, as Ishii also went to
graduate school here," Steiner
said.
Kono was minister of state for
Japan's science and technology
agency from December of 1985
to August 1986. His political
popularity, evident in his eight

straight election victories to the
Diet, has caused many to con
sider him a future cabinet mem
ber or candidate for prime mini
ster.
According to Stone, "Kono
spent some time reminiscing"
while here. Among the things
Kono recalled were the Nixon-
Kennedy debate, his adviser
Steiner and seeing Alexander
Kerensky, the head of Russia's
provisional government after
the fall of the Czar who later did
research here.
"I tried to sell [Kono] an
alumni membership," Stone

said.'Tm never one to miss an
opportunity. He said he'd take
the information and study it
later."
Kono's party politics has a
dynamic history. He was
elected at age 30 to fill the seat
in the Diet that was left empty
by his father's death in 1965.
His career in Japan's Liberal
Democratic Party (LDP) was
considered promising, due
partly to his lineage — his
father was a very powerful
postwar politician — but also
because he established a repu
tation as an attractive new per
sonality in the party.
