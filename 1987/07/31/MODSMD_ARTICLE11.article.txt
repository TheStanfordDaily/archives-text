Cheerleaders are
annoying resident
I have been a student at
Stanford for four years and I
am spending my first summer
here studying. I've been fairly
impressed with the care that
Stanford has put into the resi
dential experience.
I have never, however, felt so
inconvenienced as I have this
summer with the invasion of
the cheerleaders. I am not
against pep squads and cheer
leader camps. But Stanford
University, even in the sum
mer, is a highly inappropriate
place for cheerleading camps to
take place.
I come home only to find very
loud men and women yelling
right outside my window from
8 a.m. all the way to 9:30 p.m.
The libraries are one place to
go, but even those have shorter
summer hours and one cannot
really sleep there or relax.
I realize that the Conference
Program makes a lot of money
on hosting these camps, but it
is highly inappropriate to
sacrifice learning and students'
well-being for a fast buck.
There are other groups that
could fill the spots just as well.
Many students and other con
ference members are here only

for a short time and I hate to
think that they remember
Stanford as the place with
noisy cheerleaders.

End the ethnic
theme houses here
As a former resident of an
ethnic theme house, and as one
who was bused to a voluntarily
integrated inner-city grammar
school, I find theme houses to
be Stanford's most obvious and
correctable obstacle in achiev
ing racial and cultural har
mony.
Although some may benefit
from the social and educational
programs, others simply seek
the camaraderie and protection
they perceive can be had by
isolating themselves from the
"outside world." Meanwhile,
the other residences remain
mostly white.
This is a disservice to all
involved. First, there are the
minority theme house residents
who avoid living in an integra
ted world. Second, the non
minority residents of theme
houses sometimes find them
selves in the minority for the
first time, and they rarely live
in these houses by choice.
Third, the minority students

in non-theme houses are virtu
ally isolated from those of
similar background, and
become part of a very small
minority. Finally, non-minority
students in non-theme houses,
many of whom have not been
exposed to an integrated life
style, may never properly learn
to live and work with all of
their peers.
I hope the Office of Residen
tial Education is not blinded by
its own statistics, which show
support of the theme houses by
their residents. Any group
bound by a common theme (and
residents of non-theme houses
are not so bound) will identify
more closely with its immedi
ate "family" than with out
siders.
This is true whether the
group is bound by culture, sex,
profession, hobby or criminal
record. Just because female
soccer players, for example, are
more comfortable with other
female soccer players is no
reason to demand, based on the
statistics, that there be a
Female Soccer Theme House.
Statistics can be twisted or
misinterpreted to support any
preconceived notion.
Isolation does nothing to
promote peace and growth.
Isn't it about time we all
started living together?
