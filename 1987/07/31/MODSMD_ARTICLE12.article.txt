# Rethink American foreign policy in Nicaragua
## 
### 
The Sandinista regime in Nicaragua
recently celebrated its eighth anniversary
in power. Once occasions for celebration
among American supporters of the regime,
such anniversaries have generated less en
thusiasm in recent years as the Sandinistas
have consolidated their rule over
Nicaragua.

These days the Sandinistas are anxious
to appear amenable to a negotiated settle
ment of Nicaragua's civil war. President
Daniel Ortega will meet with other Central
American presidents in Guatemala City on
August 6 to discuss the prospects for peace
in the region.
The Sandinistas realize that American
public and congressional opinion, never
wholeheartedly behind the contras in the
first place, can now only be further divided
by the appearance of reasonableness and
pragmatism on the part of the Sandinistas.
We are unlikely to see a repeat of President
Ortega's unannounced Visit to Moscow just
prior to a highly contested vote on aid to the
contras.
Sandinista posturing aside, the coming

months should be a time for the United
States to re-examine and reaffirm its policy
toward Nicaragua. Sandinista Nicaragua,
all can finally concede, has not been the
model of Third World revolution and devel
opment which many claimed it would be.
The dire predictions of Sandinista oppo
nents have been realized. Even while ac
cepting an unprecedented amount of aid
from the Carter administration, the Sandi
nistas were embarking on the military
build-up which has given them the largest
armed force in the history of Central
America.
Since 1979, the Soviets and their allies
have furnished the Sandinistas with over
$1 billion in military assistance. For their
part, the Sandinistas continue to support
the likes of the M-19 terrorists in Colombia,
the PLO, Libya's Khadafi and the Marxist
led rebels of El Salvador.
What's more, the Sandinistas now hold
thousands of political prisoners, as
Americas Watch and Amnesty Interna
tional will attest. The newspaper La Prensa
has long ago fallen under government con
trol, and the predictable deprivations and
dislocations of centralized economic plan
ning have taken their toll. It is the height of
political naivete (and inconsistent with
public statements by the Sandinistas them
selves) to think that the current
Nicaraguan regime will ever voluntarily
relinquish power.
With all of this in mind, American pblicy
— unreliable, uncommitted and short

sighted — must be rethought to accommo
date the recent political dissolution of the
United Nicaraguan Opposition and the
reality of protracted conflict in Nicaragua.
We should not self-righteously condemn
the shortcomings and abuses of an ill
trained peasant army while refusing to aid
in its political and military professionaliza
tion.
The contras now number between 12,000
and 18,000, depending on whose estimates
you accept. This makes them a force at least
twice the size of the Salvadoran rebels in a
country half as large as El Salvador.
The contras are primarily disaffected
peasants, but include representatives of the
middle and business classes, the church,
Miskito Indians and a small number of
former National Guardsmen. The contras,
it must be emphasized, are not a mercenary
force. They are indigenous, they have
legitimate grievances, and they deserve our
support.
Tocqueville wrote some time ago,
"Foreign politics demand scarcely any of
those qualities which are peculiar to a
democracy." We have seen the criminal be
havior (a la Casey, North and Poindexter)
that one approach to this claim counsels.
Let us hope that in the months ahead,
both in the September vote on continued
contra aid and in the 1988 election, we can
muster the national resolve to find a
legitimate way to prove Tocqueville wrong.
