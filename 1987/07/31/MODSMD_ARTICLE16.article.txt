## Taiwanese teachers become students of America 
### TARRANT MAHONY 
When most people hear of
Volunteers-in-Asia (VIA), they
think of Stanford students ser
ving in small schools in In
donesia, working in rural com
munities in the Philippines or
teaching English in China.
But to students in Japan or
teachers in Taiwan, VIA
represents the best way to
spend a few weeks or months at
one of America's most famous
universities.
On July 4, 25 teachers from
Taiwan arrived at Stanford to
begin a one-month, VlA
sponsored program on language
training and English teaching
methodoloerv.
Cliff Chan, the VIA coordina
tor of this summer's Taiwan
program, said "we are really
excited because VIA sends a lot
of Americans to Taiwan, and
now we have an exchange. An
integral part of language teach
ing is culture, so the impact on
them and their students back in
Taiwan should be broad."
The program includes 15
hours a week in a classroom,
with time given to studying
American culture as well as
grammar and teaching meth
ods, and substantial homework.
Most other American univer
sities limit their cultural ex
change programs to classroom
work, room and board. "That's
where it would normally end,"
said Chan. But for VlA's guests,

that's where it begins.
The group was literally just
off the plane when they went to
a Fourth of July symphony con
cert at Shoreline Amphitheatre.
"We thought they'd be tired,"
Chan joked, "but they were
raring to go."
The group will also have re
ceptions with members of the
Stanford community involved
in Chinese studies, go to cook
outs at the homes of Stanford
students and faculty and take
trips to the City, where they
will discuss issues involving
ethnic diversity and Asian-
American problems.
"We wanted them to have
more, to interact with
Americans — see America. We
tried to supplement the class
room learning with experiential
education," Chan said.
"For many it's the first and
perhaps only time to come —
they have children and other re
sponsibilities back home — and
are approaching it as such.
They want to do as much as pos
sible and see everything," he
added.
Chan, who taught English for
two years in Taiwan and one
year in China, admitted to
learning new things about
Asian culture from this year's
group. "It opened my eyes. I
thought of Chinese as shy and
quiet but many of these people
don't fit that stereotype. We
told them at the beginning

'you're here by yourselves —
you've got to be bold, brave' and
they took us at our word," he
remarked.

Chan is staying with the 25
Taiwanese at the French House
and is responsible for many of
the after-class activities. "It's
like being a cultural inter
preter: 'Why do you do this?
Why do you do that?' Watching
them learning is fascinating,"
Chan said.
Chan noted that he and the
Taiwanese were not the only
ones benefitting from the teach

ers' being here. "People who
didn't know much about
Taiwan have become more in
terested after meeting them
and want to know more," he
said.
Lisa Hung, a junior high
school teacher from the south
ern Taiwan city of Tainan, said
"for the past few years VIA just
sent students to Asia to teach
English, but now want to ex
change. We came here to learn
new skills."
Another participant in the
program, Amy Lee, graduated

from college in Taiwan this
June and would like to be a
teacher. "My interest is in
children's literature, but it is all
published in America. I thought
it would help to visit America,
that it was important to go."
One problem Lee encountered
in coming to America was ob
taining a visa. David Chang,
the leader of the group, ex
plained that they had to go
through the American Institute
in Taiwan to obtain their visas.
American policy, designed to
stop illegal immigration, makes
it difficult for certain people to
enter the country. Young,
single women who aren't yet
employed — such as Amy Lee
— fall into one of these
catagories. However, only one
of the members of the group was
denied a visa because she was
not a teacher, according to
Chang.
Ginger Jung, another ex
uberant English teacher, said
she came because, "I really like
traveling and English. Now I
know why everyone goes to
America: It is a happy land."
In a more serious vein Jung
added that "English is the in
ternational language. In
Taiwan we must study English
from junior high school and yet
there are many people who
can't speak. There must be
something wrong with our edu
