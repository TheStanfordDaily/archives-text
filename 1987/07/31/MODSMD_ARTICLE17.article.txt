# University groups battle energy waste

It costs $12 million a year to keep Stan
ford lit and electrified.
For most of those concerned with en
ergy costs, that amount is too high. To
reduce that number, the Energy Manage
ment Group (EMG) recently inaugurated
an awareness program intended to ad
dress the problem of the campus' high en
ergy cost and excessive use.
According to Ken Wilke, a facilities en
gineer with the EMG, the campus aware
ness program "is primarily targeted
toward University staff and faculty." The
EMG sends out information on a quar
terly and monthly basis to various mem
bers of the University. Example: a poster
reading "Let's be frank. Wasted energy is
a monster of a problem."
Another organization on campus, the
Housing Energy Conservation Center
(HECC), concentrates on student energy
use. Among other tactics to encourage
limited use, the HECC assigns a student
energy representative from each dorm to
act as as a liason between the HECC of
fice and the residence. Another activity
sponsored by the HECC is a contest, held
periodically, that awards gifts to the dorm
with the lowest energy bill.
Wilke said, however, that the technical
buildings use much more energy than
student residences. Forsythe Hall, which
houses computers, uses by far the most
energy of any building on campus.
Two other buildings that follow closely
behind Forsythe in energy consumption
are the Center for Intergrated Systems
and the McCullogh building, both techni

cal facilities. While these buildings do
consume large amounts of energy, fund
ing for their energy costs is provided
through research grants. Research
proposals typically have an "indirect cost"
attatched to their budgets that is in
tended to cover overhead costs, such as
energy expense.
Other problems confronting the EMG
are the large, energy-inefficient buildings
such as Meyer and Green Libraries. Ac
cording to Wilke, the EMG is dealing
with this problem as well.
"Right now we have what you might
call a two-pronged program. We study a
building from top to bottom and consider
any type of measure that would make the
building more energy efficient," Wilke

said. Meyer Library, Green Library, Mar
garet Jacks Hall — the home of the Com
puter Science Department — and the
Mitchell Earth Sciences building are all
undergoing this review, he added.
The second "prong" of the system, ac
cording to Wilke, is to look for specific
areas in buildings where "general techni
cal improvements" can be made, citing as
a case in point the substitution of fluores
cent lighting for incandescent.
"[lncandescent] bulbs burn out so fast,"
Wilke said, adding that, with the innova
tion of screw-in fluorescent bulbs, the in
candescent bulbs can be replaced without
having to change the existing fixtures.
"It's great for outdoor lighting. These
lights last 10 times as long," he said.
