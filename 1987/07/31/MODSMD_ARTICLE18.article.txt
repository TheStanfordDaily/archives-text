La Bamba **%
The Stanford Theater
221 University Ave., Palo Alto
In spite of my wanting very
much to enjoy this film, I could
not. "La Bamba" is not as fasci
nating or emotional as it could
have been. Instead, it is trite
and overdone.
The film tells part of the tale
of Ritchie Valens (Lou Diamond
Phillips), a poor Hispanic teen
ager who became an overnight
rock 'n' roll success in the late

19505. Valens' tragic death —
in the same plane crash that
took the life of Buddy Holly —
ended his career almost before
it had begun.
Though Phillips and co-star
Esai Morales both turn in fine
performances, the script was
written with neither creativity
nor class. Writer and director
Luis Valdez shoves fore
shadowing and irony into the
viewers' faces as if the audience
were blind.
The really disappointing part
of this movie involved its
wasted potential.

The life of someone as young
and ambitious as Valens must
have been filled with interest
ing stories involving his
thoughts and emotions and his
passion for music. "La Bamba"
simply does not do justice to
those aspects of the story.
I must mention that the
music in this film is excellent
and it may be worth seeing "La
Bamba" just to hear it and to
catch the appearances by Los
Lobos, Brian Setzer and Mar
shall Crenshaw.

Withnail and I **
Fine Arts Theater
430 California St. Palo Alto)
This is a dark comedy about
two would-be English actors
living together in near-poverty
in London who decide to take a
holiday in the country.
One of the actors, Withnail
(Richard Grant), is a conniving

alcoholic who is only going
through the motions of pursu
ing a once-promising acting
career.
When the heat runs out at the
same time as the alcohol, they
decide to ask Withnail's
homosexual uncle to allow them
to stay at his cabin in the
country.
Unknown to his roommate,
Withnail tells his uncle that the
other actor (Paul McGann) is
also gay in order to elicit the
uncle's sympathy. The humor of
the film comes when the uncle
unexpectedly shows up at the
cottage to pursue the young ac
tor.
The film, written and di
rected by Bruce Robinson, un
fortunately does little more
than hold your interest most of
the time. It is well-acted, but
the viewer will inevitably leave
the cinema asking what the
point of the movie was.
