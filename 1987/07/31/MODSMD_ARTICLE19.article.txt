# Napa Valley wineries give variety by the bunches

Wine tasting in Napa Valley
is deservedly one of the major
tourist attractions in Northern
California. With over 100
wineries in Napa Valley open to
the public, the greatest di
lemma faced by potential wine
tasters is which wineries to
visit.
Too often people try to stop at
every winery they see.
However, if you try this, by the
end of the day you will be too
tired to distinguish the various
wines that you have tasted.
At most, a person can visit
four to five wineries per day.
Tourists hoping to make the
most of their time should plan
ahead. Here is a list of unique
wineries which may provide
some ideas.
Near the southern end of the
valley is the Robert Mondavi
winery. This is one of the larg
est wineries in the valley and
their excellent tour explains
state-of-the-art wine produc
tion. One must take the tour in
order to taste their wines,
which are quite good.
Farther north on Highway 29
(the main Napa thoroughfare)
is Beaulieu Vineyard. Beaulieu
offers an exceptionally classy
wine tasting experience.
Upon entering the winery
guests are presented wine
glasses and encouraged to stroll
around the hospitality room
while enjoying the wine. The

room itself is decorated with
photographs of the winery and
antique wine paraphernalia.
Along with the informative
tour, Beaulieu provides an in
teresting 15 minute multi
media presentation every half
hour. The tours and presenta
tion are optional.
A great place to stop for lunch
is the V. Sattui winery. This
winery has a complete
delicatessen and an outdoor pic
nic area.
In addition, V. Sattui makes
some excellent wines â€” partic
ularly their Rieslings and
Madeira. Their wines are sold
only at the winery, so the selec
tion offered for tasting is more
generous than at most places.
Tours are by appointment only.
Almost directly across the
street is the Sutter Home
Winery, offering some very in
expensive wines. These wines
should be a staple for those on a
student's budget. Unfortun
ately, Sutter Home is often
crowded and offers no tours.
Quite a bit further north is
Sterling Vineyards. Sterling is
a large Spanish-style building
set on the top of a hill and acces
sible only by tram. Once at the
top, though, the view is stun
ning.
Though the tram costs $5 per
person, the ticket stub entitles
the bearer to a $2 discount on
any purchase of wine. Arrive
fairly early, since the last tram
leaves the base of the mountain

at 4:30 p.m. and there is often a
line.
Sterling offers a self-guided
tour. If one takes the time to
read the posted signs, this tour
will provide more information
than other tours.
At the end of the tour is the
wine-tasting room where
visitors can relax while wines
are served to each table.
At the base of Sterling is Clos
Pegase, which opened only
three weeks ago. Pegase's build

ing was constructed according
to a design by well-known ar
chitect Michael Graves. The
design won a San Francisco
Museum of Modern Art compe
tition in which over 90 ar
chitects competed to create a
winery that would combine the
best of art and function.
Pegase is owned by art collec
tor Jan Shrem, who has filled
the winery with replicas of
pieces of abstract and surrealis
tic art from his collection. The

tour is fun and exciting thanks
both to the building and the
flamboyant guide.
Because the winery is new, it
makes only two wines, both of
which are available for tasting.
Visitors must buy an exception
ally nice wine glass ($3) in or
der to taste the wines. The tour
is free.
All of the wineries above are
located on or next to Highway
29 and are easily accessible.

Several wineries in Napa Valley are worth visiting if only for their distinct architecture.
