# Stanford ordered to clean up park

### ERIN MARTIN Staff writer 
The California Regional
Water Quality Control Board
last week ordered Stanford to
clean up groundwater pollution
detected at two sites bordering
the Stanford Research Park.
A July 24 report from the
board said water control inspec
tors had detected toxic chemical
pollution at the former
Mayfield School lot at 2650 El
Camino, adjacent to Hewlett-
Packard and Varian Associates,
and in the Palo Alto Square
area at 3000 El Camino, across
Page Mill Road from Hewlett-
Packard.
The University has re
peatedly denied responsibility
for the contamination on Stan
ford land, but the report orders
Stanford to trace the cause of
the pollution, which "may have
originated from different
sources."
Paula Kakimoto, property
manager for the Stanford De
partment of Lands Manage
ment, said the University was
named the responsible party be
cause of water control board
policy.
"Their standard is to name
the landowner when the source
of chemicals is still unknown,
though we have asked them not
to," she said.
Kakimoto said University of
ficials will meet with represen
tatives from Hewlett-Packard
and Varian Associates at the
end of August to discuss a possi

ble connection between the new
pollutants and old toxic leaks
from the two companies.
Chemical pollutants were
traced to Hewlett-Packard in
1982 and Varian Associates in
1986.
"At this point, we don't really
know how we will handle this,"
Kakimoto said.
The report documents results
from the regular monitoring of
the Stanford Research Park and
the surrounding area by the
board and the California De
partment of Health Services
(DHS).
The DHS finished a series of
soil gas monitoring tests on
July 24 that included samples
from the Research Park, Barron
Park, the Veteran's Adminis
tration Hospital, the Stanford
Quarry and areas along
Matadero Creek.
In 1965 the Stanford Quarry
was used as a dumping site for
"unidentified laboratory waste
by unidentified labs on
campus," said Jennifer Gates, a
specialist for the Stanford
Departartment of Health and
Safety.
The waste was excavated in
1980 at the urging of the water
control board and relocated to a
landfill, Gates said.
Since then, monitoring wells
have been constructed to watch
contamination levels. Accord
ing to Gates, there has been
"some soil contamination, but
not a significant amount."
Allan Lui, DHS case en
gineer, said he did not expect to
find significantly higher per
centages of toxic waste at the
quarry site than at other sites.
The DHS extended its testing
beyond the Research Park and
the immediately surrounding
area in order "to uncover any
concentrations or hot spots of
chemicals that would help
define sources of the pollution
conclusively," Lui said.
According to Dwight Hoenig,
a chief officer at DHS, the test
results will be released in mid-
August.
