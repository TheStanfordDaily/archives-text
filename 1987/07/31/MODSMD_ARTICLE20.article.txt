## Big Mac attack and a Plunk could put A's in first 
### 
Another week has gone by, and an
other ball off the bat of Athletics' rookie
Mark McGwire has gone out of the
stadium. That's number 37 for the 23-
year-old first baseman.

The A's have played 101 times this
season, and McGwire is hitting a home
run every 2.7 games. If he keeps this
pace up for the remainder of the season
he will hit 60 homers.
In other words, he's no longer on pace
to knock Roger Maris out of the record
books. But he could bat .290, hit 50 home
runs and drive in 120 runs. Not a bad
debut in the major leagues.
Perhaps more interesting to A's fans is
that these guys just might win the
American League West. A couple of
months ago I would've said that they
have no chance, now I'm beginning to be
lieve in these guys a little.
Dave Stewart has proven he is truly a

front line starting pitcher. Steve On
tiveros is proving he just might be one
too. If Curt Young can come back from
his injury, the A's will have three
legitimate starters. In the 1980s that's
been enough to win a division.
Admittedly, the pitching is shaky and
it may not carry them to a division title.
Then again it might. If any of the miss
ing pieces fall into place the A's could be
real tough to beat.
And, who might complete the pitching
puzzle? The list is long. First, there's
Joaquin Andujar. True, he's tempermen
tal. True, he's been ineffective lately.
But, he has won before and he could win
again.
But, more importantly Andujar is not
the only hope. The A's mystery men —
Eric Plunk and Jose Rijo — could return
from Tacoma in September and give the
A's a big lift.
Both of them have 90 mph fastballs
and major league breaking pitches. They
should win games, but they don't. If you
have to have a problem, it's not a bad one
to have because it means you can win
anytime.
The A's may move Plunk to short
relief, in an attempt to fill the void

created by the disappearance of the real
Jay Howell. If they do that, history will
be on their side. Two years ago the Car
dinals and Blue Jays brought up hard
throwing short releivers in the second
half of the season and went on to win
their divisions.
Plunk might follow in the footsteps of
the Cardinals' Todd Worrell or the Blue
Jays' Tom Henke, and lead his team to
victory. True, the Royals, Twins and An
gels will give the A's a run for their
money, but I wouldn't be all that
surprised if the A's came out on top.
In other news ... I think I'll be cancel
ing my Sports Illustrated (SI) subscrip
tion soon. If you just take a look at this
week's cover story you'll understand my
ire.
A few weeks ago SI ran and issue
titled "A Day in Baseball," which was
one of their best ever. Then, they follow
it up with pure garbage. I promised I'd
never report on the issue they did, so
you'll really have to pick up a copy your
self.
Something else has been bothering me
lately. There seems to be a growing con
sensus that the Blue Jays' Tony Fernan
dez has supplanted the Cardinals' Ozzie

Smith as the best defensive shortstop in
baseball.
I don't know how it got started but I do
know it has gained momentum. As with
any chatter in the sports world someone
hears it and says "Yeah, I was thinking
that too," and they tell someone else.
Before you know it everyone is saying it.
The problem here is what's being said
simply isn't true. Fernandez is good,
very good in fact. But, Ozzie Smith is the
best defensive shortstop ever. Period. If
you watch him play you'll find it hard
not to agree.
Final thought: Last winter, the
owners of baseball's 26 teams decided
they didn't need Jack Morris or Tim
Raines. They denied that they were col
luding not to sign free agents.
Few people believed this in light of the
fact the Morris is the winningest pitcher
of the 1980s and Raines is arguably the
best player in the National League.
This year Mike Schmidt, Dale
Murphy, Jack Clark, Cal Ripken Jr.,
Dwight Evans, Dave Righetti and Mor
ris will be free agents. It will be fun to
see the owner's try to claim they don't
need any of these guys.

surprised if the A's came out on top.
In other news ... I think I'll be cancel
ing my Sports Illustrated (SI) subscrip
tion soon. If you just take a look at this
week's cover story you'll understand my
ire.
A few weeks ago SI ran and issue
titled "A Day in Baseball," which was
one of their best ever. Then, they follow
it up with pure garbage. I promised I'd
never report on the issue they did, so
you'll really have to pick up a copy your
self.
Something else has been bothering me
lately. There seems to be a growing con
sensus that the Blue Jays' Tony Fernan
dez has supplanted the Cardinals' Ozzie

Smith as the best defensive shortstop in
baseball.
I don't know how it got started but I do
know it has gained momentum. As with
any chatter in the sports world someone
hears it and says "Yeah, I was thinking
that too," and they tell someone else.
Before you know it everyone is saying it.
The problem here is what's being said
simply isn't true. Fernandez is good,
very good in fact. But, Ozzie Smith is the
best defensive shortstop ever. Period. If
you watch him play you'll find it hard
not to agree.
Final thought: Last winter, the
owners of baseball's 26 teams decided
they didn't need Jack Morris or Tim
Raines. They denied that they were col
luding not to sign free agents.
Few people believed this in light of the
fact the Morris is the winningest pitcher
of the 1980s and Raines is arguably the
best player in the National League.
This year Mike Schmidt, Dale
Murphy, Jack Clark, Cal Ripken Jr.,
Dwight Evans, Dave Righetti and Mor
ris will be free agents. It will be fun to
see the owner's try to claim they don't
need any of these guys.
