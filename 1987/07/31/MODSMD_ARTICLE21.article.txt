Physicists probe the heavens
for elusive gravity waves
Stanford physicists are using a gigan
tic aluminum cylinder to listen for faint
echoes of celestial explosions that may
help confirm Einstein's theory of
relativity and unlock some secrets of the
universe.
The scientists are searching for
gravity waves, the infinitesimal traces
of distant galactic explosions.
No one has ever detected these
"obscenely small" waves, according to
Robert Taber, a research associate at the
High Energy Physics Laboratory.
However, Albert Einstein's general the
ory of relativity predicts that they must
exist.
The Stanford team, led by Physics
Profs. William Fairbank and Peter
Michelson, have been working since
1968 to capture the tiny signals. They

have recently begun using a 10,000-
pound ultrasensitive instrument that
resembles a giant aluminum tanker
truck barrel.
The detector's sensitivity is compara
ble to being able to see a single
wavelength of light stretching from the
Earth to the sun. Even that may not be
enough. A new machine, described in the
July 10 issue of Science magazine, is
being built which would provide a flve
order-of-magnitude improvement over
the present instrument.
Taber called the research project "a
test lab for relativity like no other lab we
possess."
Gravity waves may become an impor
tant tool for understanding other celes
tial phenomena, such as black holes, he
added.
"We're studying not just the gravity
waves themselves but what they tell us

about the events that produced them,"
Taber said.
Study reports an explosion of
education lawsuits since 1957
A recent study by a Stanford educa
tion professor has found that the volume
of education-related lawsuits in state
and federal courts has skyrocketed over
the last three decades.
"The past 30 years has been a period of
unprecedented turmoil in education law
and in the schools," the study observes.
Since the U.S. Supreme Court's
landmark 1954 decision in Brown v.
Board of Education, "law has become a
major tool in the quest for social justice,"
the researchers suggest.
The study was conducted by Education
Prof. David Tyack, Thomas James, asso
ciate director of educational studies at
Wesleyan University and Aaron

Benavot, assistant professor of sociology
at the University of Georgia.
They estimated the total volume of ed
ucation cases heard in state appellate
and federal courts during 10-year inter
vals over the last two centuries and
found that the volume of litigation
nearly doubled from the period 1957-66
to the period 1967-76.
"What is new is not the activity of
pressure groups in shaping education
legislation and litigation," the authors
state, "but the greatly increased volume
of education law, the new types of issues
raised and the constitutional doctrines
employed to decide cases."
The nature of the cases has also
changed. According to the study, tradi
tional suits involving funding and gover
nance have given way to cases about
pupil discipline, segregation, sports
eligibility and teacher employment
disputes.
