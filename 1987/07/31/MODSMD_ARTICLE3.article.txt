# Decision delayed on animal research facility

The Santa Clara County Board of Su
pervisors delayed a decision at a public
hearing Tuesday on a land use permit
for Stanford's proposed Research Animal
Facility II following an appeal by the
Palo Alto Humane Society.
The supervisors have asked the county
planning commission to call on addi
tional resources in investigating the sci
entific issues involved, Supervisor Zoe
Lofgren said. The matter will be recon
sidered by the board August 18.

'The issues need analysis through an
outside source," Lofgren said. "You can't
do adequate fact-finding in a hearing
with two different groups of apparently
professional people diametrically
opposed. One of them has got to be
wrong."
The humane society questioned the
safety of the facility, which would house
approximately 50,000 rodents, and
charged that potentially hazardous ge
netics research might be performed in
the building. According to Lofgren, the
society is concerned that a combination
of gene splicing and an inadequate ven-

tilation system might pose a risk to
health.
"Stanford is not an isolated commu
nity," said humane society member
Patricia Elsen, who stressed that she
was speaking as an individual board
member of the society and not as a repre
sentative of the organization.
"The safety of the community should
be considered before the facility is put
up," she said.
Dr. Thomas Hamm, director of labora
tory animal medicine here, denied that
any potentially dangerous biogenetic
work will be conducted at the facility.

"When you have biohazardous research,
you need special facilities," Hamm said.
"When you're looking at the plans, it's
very obvious that there are no biohazar
dous projects planned for the facility."
The humane society does not feel that
the University has adequately answered
questions about safe research, however.
"Who's going to know?" Elsen asked.
"They say that they're not going to be
doing these things. So what? How will
we know? They said the facility is not de
signed for that kind of research. That's
