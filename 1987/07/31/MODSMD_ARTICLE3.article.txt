# Decision delayed on animal research facility
## 
### SUSAN SLUSSER Editorial staff 
The Santa Clara County Board of Su
pervisors delayed a decision at a public
hearing Tuesday on a land use permit
for Stanford's proposed Research Animal
Facility II following an appeal by the
Palo Alto Humane Society.
The supervisors have asked the county
planning commission to call on addi
tional resources in investigating the sci
entific issues involved, Supervisor Zoe
Lofgren said. The matter will be recon
sidered by the board August 18.

'The issues need analysis through an
outside source," Lofgren said. "You can't
do adequate fact-finding in a hearing
with two different groups of apparently
professional people diametrically
opposed. One of them has got to be
wrong."
The humane society questioned the
safety of the facility, which would house
approximately 50,000 rodents, and
charged that potentially hazardous ge
netics research might be performed in
the building. According to Lofgren, the
society is concerned that a combination
of gene splicing and an inadequate ven-

tilation system might pose a risk to
health.
"Stanford is not an isolated commu
nity," said humane society member
Patricia Elsen, who stressed that she
was speaking as an individual board
member of the society and not as a repre
sentative of the organization.
"The safety of the community should
be considered before the facility is put
up," she said.
Dr. Thomas Hamm, director of labora
tory animal medicine here, denied that
any potentially dangerous biogenetic
work will be conducted at the facility.

"When you have biohazardous research,
you need special facilities," Hamm said.
"When you're looking at the plans, it's
very obvious that there are no biohazar
dous projects planned for the facility."
The humane society does not feel that
the University has adequately answered
questions about safe research, however.
"Who's going to know?" Elsen asked.
"They say that they're not going to be
doing these things. So what? How will
we know? They said the facility is not de
signed for that kind of research. That's
not any kind of an answer."
Hamm said the humane soci
ety is using the biohazardous
research issue as a tactic to stop
construction of the facility.
"They're using the same argu
ments to block facilities in a va
riety of places. Berkeley is a
good example where they're
using the same argument.
"My office is in this building.
Would I do anything biohazar
dous around here? I'm here a lot
of the time — believe me, it's
going to be safe."
The humane society is also
concerned that the new build

ing will fail to meet new regula
tions on animal research that
the U.S. Department of
Agriculture is expected to an
nounce within a year.
No date has been set for the
issue of new regulations, but ac
cording to Lofgren, "There have
been allegations that [the Uni
versity] is trying to hurry this
facility through before the new
regulations are announced."
Alice Sicular, an aide to Su
pervisor Dianne McKinna, said,
"The questions are why the fa
cility can't wait until the new
regulations come oat, and how
incompatible is it going to be
with the regulations after it's
built?"
"These issues should be con
sidered before the building goes
up," Elsen said. "If it is put up
before the regulations are
promulagted and changes are
necessary, then the facility will
be out of date. . . . We're trying
to prevent something from
being wrong before it's even
finished."
But Hamm said: "The USDA
has been releasing regulations
for 20 years and will in the fu
ture continue to release new

regulations. None of the regula
tions necessitate changes in the
building — it's another delay
ing tactic. Should we wait an
other 20 years?
"It doesn't make sense to
delay the building because of
future regulations. There al
ways will be future regulations.
We have to obey them, and we
will," he added.
According to Hamm, Univer
sity animal research facilities
have always passed unan
nounced inspections by the
USDA and the National Insti
tute of Health with "flying
colors" and have often been
ahead of national regulations.
"In my opinion, there is no
valid reason to block this facil
ity," Hamm said. "We are in full
compliance with every rule and
regulation."
The proposed facility would
house rodents currently located
at various research centers in
the Medical Center. The esti
mated $17 million building,
which will contain 25,000
square feet, is scheduled to take
14 months to construct.
"We either need to renovate

the current mice facilities or
build a new, more centralized
mice facility. The centralized
facility makes more sense; it's
cheaper, it's more efficient and
it's easier to monitor," Hamm
said.
Animal rights activists are
also demanding a representa
tive of a humane society to
serve on the University Animal
Care and Use Committee, a
body which approves projects
that involve the use of research
animals.
"The Palo Alto Humane Soci
ety will be pleased to have a
member serve on the research
committee in order to make a
contribution toward balancing
fairly concerns for human
health and animal welfare," El
sen said.
The committee is presently
comprised of 12 members, in
cluding Hamm, the Dean of the
chapel, a law school professor, a
student, medical school faculty
and three people not affiliated
with the University. One of the
three is a past president and
board member of the Peninsula
Humane Society.

with the regulations after it's
built?"
"These issues should be con
sidered before the building goes
up," Elsen said. "If it is put up
before the regulations are
promulagted and changes are
necessary, then the facility will
be out of date. . . . We're trying
to prevent something from
being wrong before it's even
finished."
But Hamm said: "The USDA
has been releasing regulations
for 20 years and will in the fu
ture continue to release new

regulations. None of the regula
tions necessitate changes in the
building — it's another delay
ing tactic. Should we wait an
other 20 years?
"It doesn't make sense to
delay the building because of
future regulations. There al
ways will be future regulations.
We have to obey them, and we
will," he added.
According to Hamm, Univer
sity animal research facilities
have always passed unan
nounced inspections by the
USDA and the National Insti
tute of Health with "flying
colors" and have often been
ahead of national regulations.
"In my opinion, there is no
valid reason to block this facil
ity," Hamm said. "We are in full
compliance with every rule and
regulation."
The proposed facility would
house rodents currently located
at various research centers in
the Medical Center. The esti
mated $17 million building,
which will contain 25,000
square feet, is scheduled to take
14 months to construct.
"We either need to renovate

the current mice facilities or
build a new, more centralized
mice facility. The centralized
facility makes more sense; it's
cheaper, it's more efficient and
it's easier to monitor," Hamm
said.
Animal rights activists are
also demanding a representa
tive of a humane society to
serve on the University Animal
Care and Use Committee, a
body which approves projects
that involve the use of research
animals.
"The Palo Alto Humane Soci
ety will be pleased to have a
member serve on the research
committee in order to make a
contribution toward balancing
fairly concerns for human
health and animal welfare," El
sen said.
The committee is presently
comprised of 12 members, in
cluding Hamm, the Dean of the
chapel, a law school professor, a
student, medical school faculty
and three people not affiliated
with the University. One of the
three is a past president and
board member of the Peninsula
Humane Society.
The Santa Clara County Board of Su
pervisors delayed a decision at a public
hearing Tuesday on a land use permit
for Stanford's proposed Research Animal
Facility II following an appeal by the
Palo Alto Humane Society.
The supervisors have asked the county
planning commission to call on addi
tional resources in investigating the sci
entific issues involved, Supervisor Zoe
Lofgren said. The matter will be recon
sidered by the board August 18.

'The issues need analysis through an
outside source," Lofgren said. "You can't
do adequate fact-finding in a hearing
with two different groups of apparently
professional people diametrically
opposed. One of them has got to be
wrong."
The humane society questioned the
safety of the facility, which would house
approximately 50,000 rodents, and
charged that potentially hazardous ge
netics research might be performed in
the building. According to Lofgren, the
society is concerned that a combination
of gene splicing and an inadequate ven-

tilation system might pose a risk to
health.
"Stanford is not an isolated commu
nity," said humane society member
Patricia Elsen, who stressed that she
was speaking as an individual board
member of the society and not as a repre
sentative of the organization.
"The safety of the community should
be considered before the facility is put
up," she said.
Dr. Thomas Hamm, director of labora
tory animal medicine here, denied that
any potentially dangerous biogenetic
work will be conducted at the facility.

"When you have biohazardous research,
you need special facilities," Hamm said.
"When you're looking at the plans, it's
very obvious that there are no biohazar
dous projects planned for the facility."
The humane society does not feel that
the University has adequately answered
questions about safe research, however.
"Who's going to know?" Elsen asked.
"They say that they're not going to be
doing these things. So what? How will
we know? They said the facility is not de
signed for that kind of research. That's
not any kind of an answer."
Hamm said the humane soci
ety is using the biohazardous
research issue as a tactic to stop
construction of the facility.
"They're using the same argu
ments to block facilities in a va
riety of places. Berkeley is a
good example where they're
using the same argument.
"My office is in this building.
Would I do anything biohazar
dous around here? I'm here a lot
of the time — believe me, it's
going to be safe."
The humane society is also
concerned that the new build

ing will fail to meet new regula
tions on animal research that
the U.S. Department of
Agriculture is expected to an
nounce within a year.
No date has been set for the
issue of new regulations, but ac
cording to Lofgren, "There have
been allegations that [the Uni
versity] is trying to hurry this
facility through before the new
regulations are announced."
Alice Sicular, an aide to Su
pervisor Dianne McKinna, said,
"The questions are why the fa
cility can't wait until the new
regulations come oat, and how
incompatible is it going to be
with the regulations after it's
built?"
"These issues should be con
sidered before the building goes
up," Elsen said. "If it is put up
before the regulations are
promulagted and changes are
necessary, then the facility will
be out of date. . . . We're trying
to prevent something from
being wrong before it's even
