# Computer offices reorganized
## News 
### CHRIS CRADER Staff writer 
In an effort to restructure its
million-dollar deficit information sys
tem, the University has created a
four-division department to replace
Information Technology Systems
(ITS), Stanford officials announced
Wednesday.
The new department, Information
Resources, will be divided into four
distinct sections, unlike ITS which
provided an amalgamation of various
services.
"We'll have a better handle on the
whole picture and it means we'll be
able to give better advice, and more
coherent advice," said Robert Street,
vice provost and dean of research and
academic information services from

one central department.
The new organization will be under
the direction of Street. "Essentially,
the ITS central office disappears and
becomes subsumed under my central
office," he said.
Originally responsible for running
the University's mainframe com
puter, ITS grew to contain almost all
the computer operations on campus. It
was used by every administrative of
fice and nearly every academic de
partment. ITS organized Stanford's
information transmission system,
SUNet; sold and repaired microcom
puters; established the electronic tele
phone system; maintained
SOCRATES; handled electronic mail;
and kept all the University's adminis-
trative databases.
Early this year, approxi
mately 20 employees were laid
off in an effort to shrink a
budget that had a deficit of
more than $1 million in 1986.
No further jobs were lost when
ITS was dissolved on July 1,
Street said.
Four divisions of Information
Resources will provide the
majority of ITS's services:
•The Stanford Data Center,
which will include operations,
systems, graphics and client
services, will be under the di
rection of John Sack, the former

director of data and technology
resources.
•Academic Information Re
sources, will be headed by
Ralph Gorin, the director of
LOTS. This section will contain
LOTS and Instruction and Re
search Information Systems.
•Networking and Communi
cations, consisting of SUNet
and the telephone system, will
be under William Yundt,
former director of networking.
• A "library connection,"
which will deal with the techno
logical facets of the library sys
tem and will be headed by
Bruce Jones, the director of ad
ministrative services in the li'
braries.
"What you've got now is a set

of basically four vertical pieces
of organization," Street said.
"What I see us doing is cutting
across that organization.
"One of the things that's im
mediately come out so far is a
need ... to begin to build a
more holistic vision of consult
ing. Not so that the person in
the library would be an expert
in answering your questions
about why your telephone
wouldn't work or why the net
work was down, but that person
would have access to that infor
mation that would allow them
to say who you would talk to,"
he said.
ITS had been running well
since it was created from an
other service in 1983, but "it

just got too big," according to
William Massy, vice president
for business and finance. "They
had built a certain amount of
overhead in anticipation of con
tinued growth," he said.
"They were always building
in anticipation of growth.
That's not necessarily a bad
thing as long as you continue
growing and as long as the
growth is right, in a good cause.
But when they stopped growing
about a year and a half, two
years ago, it became apparent;
then the high levels of support
became excessive and uecame a
problem," Massy said.
"Needless to say, that caused
a problem, both because of the
large numbers and because it

had been unanticipated," he
added.
Under the new set-up there
will be less separation between
the academic and administra
tive branches of computing.
"I like the new organization,"
Gorin said. "I think [its] most
important characteristic is that
it allows us to take a more holis
tic view. . . . Before, that view
was fragmented by drawing
boundaries that didn't serve us
well."
Gorin added that "our ap
proach to the client is impor
tant," and that a new
"coordinated and coherent
view" would allow them to bet
ter and more quickly serve their
clients.
