Reagan plans move against abortion
WASHINGTON — President Ronald Reagan, promising
to push "just as hard as I know how for pro-life measures,"
moved yesterday to end the use of federal family planning as
sistance money for abortion counseling and referral.
Reagan also said he has ordered Surgeon General C.
Everett Koop to prepare "a comprehensive medical report on
the health effects, mental and physical, of abortion on
women," although there was no immediate indication how
much time Koop would have to submit such a study.
These were among a series of steps Reagan announced to
anti-abortion activists gathered in an Old Executive Office
Building auditorium, and as he ticked off each initiative, the
president was given a loud ovation.
Pro-choice groups condemned the proposals.
In his speech, Reagan said: "We must not rest — and I
pledge to you that I will not rest — until a human life amend
ment becomes a part of our Constitution."
But he acknowledged that battle will be a long one, and
said in the meantime, other alternatives must be found to dis
courage — if not abolish — abortions.
President to undergo surgery again
WASHINGTON — President Ronald Reagan has suffered
a recurrence of skin cancer on his nose and will enter
Bethesda Naval Hospital today for surgery to remove a small
amount of tissue, the White House announced yesterday.
White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said that a
biopsy of tissue excised from near the tip of Reagan's nose
Wednesday indicated the need for deeper surgery, which will
be performed this afternoon, using a local anesthetic.
It was uncertain whether the president, who canceled plans
to spend the weekend at Camp David, would remain over
night at the hospital in Maryland.
Fitzwater said the tissue sample was taken during a
routine medical observation in the White House physician's
office. He said the biopsy, or microscopic examination, of the
two to three millimeters of skin removed "indicated the pres
ence of basal cell epithelioma" — a small tumor that rarely
spreads.
Dr. Chung Hong Hu, an associate professor of dermatology
at Stanford Medical School, said the cure rate for the condi
tion is greater than 95 percent if it is treated early.
The president's skin problem is considered unrelated to the
colon cancer for which he underwent surgery two years ago.
Poll: Tough AIDS measures needed
LOS ANGELES — Many Americans are prepared to ac
cept very strong measures to battle the mounting AIDS
epidemic, and 42 percent say they believe that some civil
liberties must be suspended in the effort, according to a Los
Angeles Times Poll.
When asked "do you think some civil liberties must be
suspended in the war on AIDS," 42 percent of respondents in
the nationwide poll said yes, 38 percent said no, and 19 per
cent were not sure.
Also, 68 percent said they would favor criminal sanctions
against people with AIDS who remain sexually active and 84
percent approved making it a crime for people in AIDS high
risk groups to donate blood. Both findings represent signifi
cant increases since the same questions were asked by the
Times Poll in December 1985, when the affirmative figures
were 51 percent and 77 percent, respectively.
The national survey of 2,095 people, conducted July 24 to
28, was designed to assess public perceptions of how to control
the AIDS epidemic and to see if they had changed since the
1985 poll.
The new survey showed that about half of Americans would
tolerate mandatory testing for people with a high risk of ac
quiring AIDS and adding AIDS to the list of infectious
diseases that require quarantine.
Biologist discovers new antibiotics
A chance observation by a federal researcher working
with a common laboratory frog has led to the discovery of a
new family of naturally occurring antibiotics that kills an un
usually wide variety of germs.
The discovery adds credence to the growing belief that vir
tually all animals and insects — including humans — have
previously unknown chemical defenses that provide at least
some protection against many infections, said Michael Zas
loff, a molecular biologist at the National Institute of Child
Health and Human Development.
If so, he said in an interview yesterday, these defense sys
tems could be exploited to provide new drugs for fighting
human disease. The compounds should be particularly
valuable, Zasloff added, because they have a different mecha
nism of action than existing antibiotics and thus should kill
microorganisms that have grown resistant to conventional
antibiotics, such as the bacteria that cause venereal disease.
Preliminary studies in animals suggest that the new an
tibiotics may also have fewer side effects than most an
tibiotics now in use.
