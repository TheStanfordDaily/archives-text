# Regan: President didn't know
## 
### 
WASHINGTON â€” President
Ronald Reagan "visibly was
shook .. . and recoiled" when he
was told that profits from U.S.
arms sales to Iran had been
diverted to Nicaragua's contras,
former White House Chief of
Staff Donald Regan told
Congress' Iran-contra investi
gating committees yesterday.
Reagan's shock upon hearing
the news was so convincing,
Regan testified, that "I'd give
him an Academy Award" if the
former actor was feigning
surprise. Regan is expected to
conclude his testimony today.
Regan's account, lauded by
both Democrats and
Republicans on the committees
as candid and credible, rein
forced the claim of John Poin
dexter, Reagan's former na
tional security adviser, that the

president knew nothing of the
diversion of money to the con
tras during the period when
Congress had banned U.S. aid
to the rebels.
The congressional inves
tigators had made the presi
dent's knowledge of the diver
sion, which apparently was
carried out in his name by
White House aide Oliver North,
into the central issue of their
three months of hearings,
which probably will end early
next week.
As chief of staff for a presi
dent who did not involve him
self in details, Regan was
known for putting an iron grip
on most aspects of WTiite House
operations. His testimony pro
vided the committees with their
first Oval Office perspective on
the foreign policy disasters that

plummeted the administration
into its worst crisis.
In vivid, salty and often
humorous detail, he described
how the president became the
victim of a frustrating "bait and
switch" operation by the
Iranians on whom he had
pinned his hopes of opening a
long-range relationship with
the regime of the Ayatollah
Ruhollah Khomeini and
gaining the release of
Americans held hostage by
Iranian-backed terrorists in
Lebanon.
"I told (Reagan) I thought we
ought to break it off, that, you
know, we'd been snookered
again/' Regan testified. "And
how many times, you know, do
we put up with this rug
merchant type of stuff?"
