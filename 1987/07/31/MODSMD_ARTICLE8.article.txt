Last week the ASSU Senate and members of the Council of
Presidents discussed a proposal to televise the second senate
meeting of the school year. The senators have set aside nearly
$600 for the telecast, which will be an experiment that could
lead to televising all regular ASSU Senate meetings.
The seven senators who attended the summer meeting
postponed a final decision on future telecasts until the full
senate can consider it this fall.
Apparently the senators and COP members who supported
the bill are trying to make the ASSU more accessible to stu
dents. While this goal is laudable, televising the senate is a
lousy idea.
The senators are considering broadcasting the meetings on
the student channel to campus residences. As it is, no one is
really interested in ASSU Senate meetings, which tend to be
time-wasting battles over proper parlimentary procedure.
Putting the senate on television looms as a $600 boondoggle
as well is a most unlikely way for the student channel to build
an audience.
The idea that scores of students will put aside their books
or forsake a night of fun to watch pedantic senators play-act
the democratic process on camera stretches the imagination.
Admittedly, it would be nice if everyone was more con
cerned about student government â€” perhaps greater interest
would inspire the ASSU to be more efficient and worthwhile.
But at $600 a pop, televising the senate is much too pricey a
way of trying to cultivate that interest.
