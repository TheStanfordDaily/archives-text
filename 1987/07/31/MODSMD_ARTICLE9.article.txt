One can't help but be impressed with the recent decision
made by Stanford, Palo Alto and Menlo Park regarding the
Sand Hill Road extension.
For more than 25 years, Stanford officials have been trying
to get the neighboring cities to allow the construction of a
link between El Camino Real and Sand Hill Road. Currently,
traffic is funneled in an inefficient and unsafe pattern
through the Stanford Shopping Center parking lot. It makes
sense for both safety and convenience reasons that a link be
built.
However, the cities have opposed the construction of a link
for what they claim is concern about the environment and in
creased traffic.
At long last parties involved have been able to reach the
first step in a settlement. Representatives from the three
communities have commissioned a study to examine any en
vironmental and traffic problems the extension may create.
Ostensibly, if there are no major problems, construction will
start â€” if the link will cause damage to the environment, it
will not.
Let's hope that the study will move with all due speed, and
that the residents of Menlo Park and Palo Alto are not just
trying selfish blocking measures because they are concerned
about the effect of increased traffic on their property values.
