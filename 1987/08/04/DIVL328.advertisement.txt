IS YOUR BLOOD PRESSURE MEDICATION
AFFECTING YOUR CHOLESTEROL??
The reduction of elevated blood pressure has resulted in a
dramatic decrease in the incidence of stroke. Based on the
magnitude of blood pressure reduction achieved, a 25% to
30% reduction in the incidence of heart attack would also be
expected. This has not happened. Only a 7% average
decrease lias been seen. What went wrong?
Recent evidence suggests that some medications used to
treat high blood pressure may have an adverse effect on
blood cholesterol levels. Other medications may have a
beneficial effect.
If you have high blood pressure and would like to learn
