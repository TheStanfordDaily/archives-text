# Conference here draws many faiths
## News 
### TARRANT MAHONY Staff writer 
Over 800 people from 21
countries arrived at Stanford
this week for a worldwide con
ference on religious and social
issues sponsored by the Interna
tional Association for Religious
Freedom (lARF).
Representatives from 50 reli
gious faiths and several liberal
organizations will spend the
next three days discussing is
sues ranging from Sikhism to
religious violence in Northern
Ireland, according to Janine
Denegall, director of public re
lations for the Unitarian Uni
versalist Association (UUA),
which is hosting the conference.
The theme of the 26th trien
nial conference, which runs
through Thursday, is "World
Religions Face the 21st Cen
tury."
The conferees will meet in
discussion groups each morning
and in the afternoon take part
in approximately 40 workshops,
according to the conference di
rectory.
On Thursday the conferees
will hold a candlelight cere
mony commemorating the 47th
anniversary of the dropping of
the atomic bomb on Hiroshima.
Participants will float candles
in the fountain in front of
Hoover Tower, Denegall said.
"The candles light the way for
the passing of those who died
this year from radiation sick
ness and light the way for the
'citizen pilgrim,' for people who
are here to rededicate them
selves to peace and justice,"
Denegall said.
The conference began Friday
night with a speech by Maya
Angelou, poet and author of "I
Know Why The Caged Bird
Sings," who began by singing a
Southern spiritual and told the
audience "you delight me."
Angelou told the capacity
crowd in Memorial Church, "I
want to speak to you about one
thing, one word, and that thing
is love — not mush, not sen
timentality." She challenged
her listeners to "have the
courage to build bridges and
then walk across them."
"We are more alike than we
are unalike," Angelou said, sur
rounded on stage by colorful
banners from around the world.
"With this conference you have
a chance to look into each
other's eyes and dream your
selves in other continents.
Vida Bertrand, a lecturer in
the French Department here
and the Bahai representative to
the conference, called Angelou's

speech "the most beautiful I've
ever heard. I just had to hug
her, a handshake wouldn't do,"
Bertrand said.
If Angelou set the spiritual
tone of the conference, then the
second speaker, Dr. Sam Keen,
set the intellectual tone. Keen,
author of "Faces of The Enemy"
and former contributing editor
to "Psychology Today," spoke
Saturday morning about
"Religious Paths to Peace."
"I want to begin by going
backwards to what the future
looked like 35 years ago," Keen
said.
"We imagined technology to
be much more benign than it
turned out to be. We saw the
1950s as a time of opening, of
optimism in religion, as the be
ginning of the end of religious
parochialism," he said.
"Never did we anticipate the
rise of neo-fundamentalism in
America, in Christianity. Nor

did we anticipate neo-fund
amentalism in Islam, within
Judaism, Hinduism. We did not
anticipate the unholy union of
religious fanaticism and politi
cal power," he said.
"The question is not how reli
gion in the 21st century will
contribute to peace, but
whether there will be a 21st
century. Will religion contrib
ute or will it help destroy the
path to peace?"
The Rev. Anne Heller of the
UUA said, "I think that even to
begin to have communication
around issues as critical as reli
gious work is significant. Dr.
Keen talked about the fact that
more wars have been fought
over religion than anything
else, but being religious means
being peaceful. Peace is part of
the sacred work."
Over 300 of the conference
participants are from Japan,
the largest number from any

one country outside of the
United States, according to
Masao Shimura of the Buddhist
lay organization Rissho Kosei-
Kai.
Six different Japanese reli
gious groups are present at the
conference, including Budd
hists, Shintoists and members
of lARF-Japan, according to
Shimura.
The large Japanese involve
ment was also reflected in spe
cial events concerning Japanese
religion, including a Shinto cer
emony in Memorial Auditorium
on Sunday night.
The Shinto ceremony was
performed by the Rev.
Yukitaka Yamamoto, the 96th
chief priest of the Tsubaki
Grand Shrine who is also the
treasurer of the lARF executive
committee.
Yamamoto and Stuart Pick
ens, a Scottish Presbyterian

minister who teaches in Tokyo,
gave a brief and humorous in
troduction to Shinto. Pickens
wondered how Shinto could be
termed "primitive" by religious
scholars. "Certainly nothing
about Japan is primitive," he
joked.
Monday night members of the
conference got to taste the
flavor of a Japanese festival
when they carried a mikoshi (a
portable Shinto shrine) to
shouts of "waisho, waisho." Seiji
Mizuno, the builder of the cart
sized shrine, explained that the
chant means "harmony to
gether" and that the purpose of
the festive activity is to create
harmony between people and
the gods.
The conference will announce
its findings and declarations on
Thursday morning, Denegall
said, and will hold its closing
ceremony in the Memorial
Church on Thursday night.

begin to have communication
around issues as critical as reli
gious work is significant. Dr.
Keen talked about the fact that
more wars have been fought
over religion than anything
else, but being religious means
being peaceful. Peace is part of
the sacred work."
Over 300 of the conference
participants are from Japan,
the largest number from any

one country outside of the
United States, according to
Masao Shimura of the Buddhist
lay organization Rissho Kosei-
Kai.
Six different Japanese reli
gious groups are present at the
conference, including Budd
hists, Shintoists and members
of lARF-Japan, according to
Shimura.
The large Japanese involve
ment was also reflected in spe
cial events concerning Japanese
religion, including a Shinto cer
emony in Memorial Auditorium
on Sunday night.
The Shinto ceremony was
performed by the Rev.
Yukitaka Yamamoto, the 96th
chief priest of the Tsubaki
Grand Shrine who is also the
treasurer of the lARF executive
committee.
Yamamoto and Stuart Pick
ens, a Scottish Presbyterian

minister who teaches in Tokyo,
gave a brief and humorous in
troduction to Shinto. Pickens
wondered how Shinto could be
termed "primitive" by religious
scholars. "Certainly nothing
about Japan is primitive," he
joked.
Monday night members of the
conference got to taste the
flavor of a Japanese festival
when they carried a mikoshi (a
portable Shinto shrine) to
shouts of "waisho, waisho." Seiji
Mizuno, the builder of the cart
sized shrine, explained that the
chant means "harmony to
gether" and that the purpose of
the festive activity is to create
harmony between people and
the gods.
The conference will announce
its findings and declarations on
Thursday morning, Denegall
said, and will hold its closing
ceremony in the Memorial
Church on Thursday night.
Over 800 people from 21
countries arrived at Stanford
this week for a worldwide con
ference on religious and social
issues sponsored by the Interna
tional Association for Religious
Freedom (lARF).
Representatives from 50 reli
gious faiths and several liberal
organizations will spend the
next three days discussing is
sues ranging from Sikhism to
religious violence in Northern
Ireland, according to Janine
Denegall, director of public re
lations for the Unitarian Uni
versalist Association (UUA),
which is hosting the conference.
The theme of the 26th trien
nial conference, which runs
through Thursday, is "World
Religions Face the 21st Cen
tury."
The conferees will meet in
discussion groups each morning
and in the afternoon take part
in approximately 40 workshops,
according to the conference di
rectory.
On Thursday the conferees
will hold a candlelight cere
mony commemorating the 47th
anniversary of the dropping of
the atomic bomb on Hiroshima.
Participants will float candles
in the fountain in front of
Hoover Tower, Denegall said.
"The candles light the way for
the passing of those who died
this year from radiation sick
ness and light the way for the
'citizen pilgrim,' for people who
are here to rededicate them
selves to peace and justice,"
Denegall said.
The conference began Friday
night with a speech by Maya
Angelou, poet and author of "I
Know Why The Caged Bird
Sings," who began by singing a
Southern spiritual and told the
audience "you delight me."
Angelou told the capacity
crowd in Memorial Church, "I
want to speak to you about one
thing, one word, and that thing
is love — not mush, not sen
timentality." She challenged
her listeners to "have the
courage to build bridges and
then walk across them."
"We are more alike than we
are unalike," Angelou said, sur
rounded on stage by colorful
banners from around the world.
"With this conference you have
a chance to look into each
other's eyes and dream your
selves in other continents.
Vida Bertrand, a lecturer in
the French Department here
and the Bahai representative to
the conference, called Angelou's

speech "the most beautiful I've
ever heard. I just had to hug
her, a handshake wouldn't do,"
Bertrand said.
If Angelou set the spiritual
tone of the conference, then the
second speaker, Dr. Sam Keen,
set the intellectual tone. Keen,
author of "Faces of The Enemy"
and former contributing editor
to "Psychology Today," spoke
Saturday morning about
"Religious Paths to Peace."
"I want to begin by going
backwards to what the future
looked like 35 years ago," Keen
said.
"We imagined technology to
be much more benign than it
turned out to be. We saw the
1950s as a time of opening, of
optimism in religion, as the be
ginning of the end of religious
parochialism," he said.
"Never did we anticipate the
rise of neo-fundamentalism in
America, in Christianity. Nor

did we anticipate neo-fund
amentalism in Islam, within
Judaism, Hinduism. We did not
anticipate the unholy union of
religious fanaticism and politi
cal power," he said.
"The question is not how reli
gion in the 21st century will
contribute to peace, but
whether there will be a 21st
century. Will religion contrib
ute or will it help destroy the
path to peace?"
The Rev. Anne Heller of the
UUA said, "I think that even to
begin to have communication
around issues as critical as reli
gious work is significant. Dr.
Keen talked about the fact that
more wars have been fought
over religion than anything
