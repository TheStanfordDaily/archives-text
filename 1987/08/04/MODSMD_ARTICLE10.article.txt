## The 						Stanford Daily An Independent Newspaper Build facility now 
### 
Last week the Santa Clara County Board of Supervisors
delayed a decision on granting a land use permit for Stan
ford's proposed Research Animal Facility 11. The delay fol
lowed an appeal by the Palo Alto Humane Society, which
charged, among other things, that the University might con
duct potentially hazardous biogenetic research in the pro
posed facility.
Laboratory animal medicine officials have refuted these al
legations very convincingly, stating that RAF II is not
equipped do any biohazardous activity and that this is clearly
evident in the plans for the building.
The humane society also claims that the University is at
tempting to slide the project through before new U.S. Depart
ment of Agriculture regulations pertaining to animal re
search are announced.
But no date is set for the USD A regulations, and Stanford,
by law, must completely comply with all new USDA rules
anyway — rules that are issued on a regular basis. In addi
tion, officials say it is doubtful that any modifications would
need to be made on the building even after the USDA issues
new restrictions.
The remainder of the humane society's concerns do not
deal specifically with the proposed facility. The questions
deal with Stanford's overall philosophy of using animals for
research — which is understandably quite different from the
humane society's stance — and with Stanford's opposition to
the Dole/Brown Animal Welfare Bill.
This is all very well: A research facility opposes certain
provisions of animal welfare legislation, and the human soci
ety supports it. Philosophically, the two groups are opposed
on this and on numerous other issues. But what does this
have to do with RAF II? Absolutely nothing.
According to animal research administrators, Stanford has
passed every unannounced inspection with "flying colors"
and is in full compliance with national rules and regulations.
While the humane society might not favor animal research,
certainly by professional standards the University conducts
research correctly and legally. It is difficult to argue with
this record.
RAF II will hold 50,000 mice — not dogs or primates, two
species which the humane society repeatedly mentions in a
July 28 memorandum to the Board of Supervisors. Mice
make up 90 percent of the animals used by Stanford for re
search, and this new underground center will make care of
the mice more efficient and cost-effective.
No new types of research are planned. Centralization of
mice facilities sounds like an idea that the humane society
should favor, if society members really do support correctly
done research as they claim.
The humane society has laudable goals. Improved care of
research animals is a very worthwhile aim. But the argu
ments the Palo Alto Humane Society is using to try and block
the facility are not relevant to RAF 11, and the building
should not be delayed any longer.
