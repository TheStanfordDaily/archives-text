Supporting contras
would be mistake
Columnist Gary Rosen's July
31 argument was based on
several misstatements of fact.
There is no evidence that the
Nicaraguan government is
sending arms to Salvadoran
rebels or aiding Libyan Col.
Moammar Khadafi. The presi
dent and defense minister of
Colombia both angrily denied
that the Sandinistas were con
nected to the M-19 guerrillas
after Reagan administration
officials made that charge in
early 1986.
As for Nicaragua's having
the "largest armed force in the
history of Central America,"
Nicaragua has 40,000 regular
forces. El Salvador has an
army of 48,000 and Guatemala
has 40,000. Neither El Sal
vador nor Guatemala is threat
ened by a U.S.-backed army.
Rosen says"the Sandinistas
are anxious to appear
amenable to a negotiated
settlement." Why not test their
sincerity? The plan offered by
President Arias of Costa Rica
and supported by other Central
American leaders calls for a
cease-fire, negotiations, in
creased political freedom in
Nicaragua and an end to
outside military intervention.
The United States has
rejected this proposal and all

offers by the Sandinistas to
negotiate. Instead it has poured
millions of dollars into a war
that will bring not democracy
but continued agony to one of
the world's poorest countries.
So far, attacks by U.S.-funded
contras have killed 12,000
civilians, more than 3,000 of
them children. Hundreds of
rural schools and health clinics
have been destroyed.
For 50 years the United
States supported the cruel dic
tatorships of the Somoza family
in Nicaragua. The Sandinista
revolution overthrew that dic
tatorship and with it the domi
nation of the United States. It
is hard to believe that U.S.
support for the contras, who
are commanded by former
Somoza officials, is anything
but an effort to regain U.S.
control of a country that is
determined to assert its inde
pendence.

Different facts
for contra debate
In his July 31 column for
support of the contras, Gary
Rosen approvingly mentions
Amnesty International. If he
had read the section of their
1986 report dealing with
Nicaragua, he would have dis

covered that the majority of the
"thousands of political
prisoners" held by the Sandi
nista government were former
members of Somoza's national
guard. Given the atrocities this
group committed against the
Nicaraguan people, they richly
deserve to spend the rest of
their lives behind bars.
Had he read still further,
Rosen would have discovered
Al's concern over "reports of
the routine practice of torture
and summary execution" by
the contras. They did not
accuse the Sandinistas of
similar abuse.
Had he picked up the June 1
issue of Newsweek and read
the article "The New Contras?"
he would have discovered that
the spectacular lack of military
success of the contras stems not
so much from want of training
or equipment (both are now
being kindly provided at the
expense of the American tax
payer), but from the fact that
the contra "army" is really a
"rabble on the loose" — more
concerned with pillaging
peasants than with doing any
real fighting.
And had he consulted an
atlas, he would have discovered
that Nicaragua is not "a
country half as large as El Sal
vador," but quite the reverse.
