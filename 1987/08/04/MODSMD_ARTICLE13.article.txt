# William Randolph Hearst and Stanford liberals
## 
### 
Bad news. William Randolph Hearst Jr.,
czar of the Hearst Corporation, doesn't like
the way we do business on the Farm. In an
editorial in the San Francisco Examiner,
Hearst lambasts the Stanford faculty for
their ideological slant to the left.

Says Hearst, "It has long been apparent
that teaching of traditional American
values and a balanced understanding of dif
fering political and economic philosophies
has been denied our youth by liberal profes
sors who dominate most of our institutions
of higher learning."
Of course, the Examiner itself has always
been a paragon of objectivity and balanced
reporting. In all seriousness, Hearst's
charge must be met squarely.
Hearst's simplistic definition of "liberal"
is based on the percentage of Stanford's fac
ulty registered as Democrats. His figures
are provoking. Sociology counts 100 per
cent; English and history, 96 percent; polit
ical science, 92 percent; philosophy, 83 per
cent; and economics, 75 percent. Hearst
probes those areas where the naive under
graduate is supposedly most vulnerable:
the liberal arts and humanities.

Fall quarter of my freshman year this
particular "blank slate" arrived for his first
Western Culture class, only to be greeted
rudely by a manic Marxist history profes
sor, Mark Mancall, who told us he aimed to
dismantle every value we had brought with
us to Stanford. Prof. Mancall was surely a
Hearst Liberal. Mancall candidly admitted
his biases and pressed Marxist history upon
us throughout the year.
Were we brainwashed? No. Were our
values confronted? Yes — again and again.
No one became a raving Marxist, but all
were profoundly influenced by the aggres
sive, irrepressible posture Mancall took.
The "traditional American values"
Hearst cherishes were in fact not lost, not
ripped away, not subverted. Rather, they
were toughened, tested, proven under fire.
We're not kids. We don't mimic our teach
ers (not too much). The Stanford liberal ed
ucation, driven by all those Stanford
liberals whom Hearst baits, is an education
of choices. The best kind.
What redeems our faculty is that it is
decidedly liberal, and so keeps Stanford
honest. Stanford could be an incredibly con
servative university. The students are com
placent, and the administration is no
hotbed of liberal ideas either, to say noth
ing of the alumni, the trustees, the Hoover
Institution and the contributing money
(power) behind the University. Considering
such circumstances, I cheer the faculty.
How to explain the imbalance?
Some tempting thoughts — Are Demo

crats simply smarter than Republicans? Or
more open-minded? Or more human? Or
humane? Or scholarly? My conservative ac
quaintances quickly snuff these flights of
fancy.
Perhaps there really is a vast pool of Re
publican scholars out there, languishing on
the sidelines, consistently excluded by
Democrats from the top-flight faculties. I
doubt it.
The likely answer lies in the self
perpetuation of the faculty. Like attracts
like. When Stanford's faculty can hire from
the best in the world, why not take person
ality and politics into consideration? There
is also self-selection within the hiring pool.
A brilliant liberal student is more likely to
aspire to the ivory tower than a brilliant
conservative because the liberal will feel
more at home than the conservative; the po
tential colleagues will be friends.
This imbalance is not bad in and of itself.
Yes, more conservatives should be drawn
into the faculty. And they will, inexorably,
as the new "conservative youth" comes of
age. Remember, though, that faculties (like
Supreme Courts) evolve slower than soci
ety. That is for the good at present.
Mr. Hearst, there could be nothing worse
than a conservative faculty rubber
stamping the ideology of conservative stu
dents. Or a liberal faculty pandering to
liberal students, for that matter. Neither is
the case at Stanford.
