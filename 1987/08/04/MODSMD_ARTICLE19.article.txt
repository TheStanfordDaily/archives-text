## 'Investigator' charts the tidal flows of Lake Lag Campus lake can't even hold its own water 
### JOHN D. LEE Staff writer 
Every summer we lose it and every
spring we get it back. But where does
Lake Lagunita go? My mother always
used to say to me whenever I lost some
thing, "Well, things don't just disappear.
It didn't just grow legs and walk away,
now, did it?"
Mothers can be so helpful when they
really don't want to be.
But it's a darn good question, isn't it?
Lake Lagunita didn't just disappear. So
what happened to it?
To uncover the answer to this ques
tion, I threw on my trench coat and
Bogart hat, jumped into my red Ferrari
(well, actually it's a beige Mazda GLC)
and took off to do some intense investi
gative reporting. I became "Magnum,
IR"
I found many students around campus
explain the lake's disappearance this
way: "It just dries up."
Yeah, right. And all the water that
doesn't dry up is used to make "Stanford
Genuine Draft — the Champagne of
Stagnant Waters."
I couldn't be fooled that easily; there
had to be more to the story. My little
voice was telling me that this was a
scandal. I first called campus informa
tion.
The staff member at information sug
gested that I call Operations, Mainte
nance and Utilities. OK, easy enough.
When I called, I was told I needed to
talk to work control supervisor Chonna
Delaney, who wasn't in that day. When I
finally got in touch with Delaney, she
told me that I needed to talk to Larry
Andrews, water division superinten
dant. Fine.
I called Andrews and he told me that
the person I should talk to was Cheryl
Jensen. At this point I was ready to call
it quits. I was all set to put away my pen
and notebook, hang up my trench coat
and Bogart hat, grab my fishing pole and
wander off into the wilderness to fish for
largemouth bass — for the rest of my
life.

I decided, though, to give it one last
try. Jensen, manager of mechanical
utilities, enlightened me in my hour of
darkness.
"After graduation," she said suspense
fully, "we open the outlet and drain it."
That's it?
"That's it," Jensen said. "Very simple
— the water all goes away," she added.
That's all there is to it?
I had to press her for more informa
tion, and luckily I managed to get some.
"The water goes down the storm drain
system, meanders out through the arbo
retum and eventually over the San
Francisquito Creek and to the (San
Francisco) Bay," she said.
I asked Jensen for information about
the filling of the lake.
"Hopefully, the rains fill it up each
year," she said. "All the water that falls
in the Foothills flows down, crosses
Junipero Serra and goes into the lake.
This year we didn't have very good rains
and so we pumped out of San Fran
cisquito Creek," she said.
I asked Jensen why they drain the
lake at all. Is it some sort of plot to divert
attention away from bigger scandals?
Jensen crushed my hopes of uncover
ing Lagunitagate. "It's not a natural
lake, it's a man-made lake. Therefore, it
has no natural inlet and no natural out
let, and the water does not flow through.
It becomes stagnant. If we tried to keep
it all year long, we would have a stagna
tion problem," she said.
Another problem is the fact that it
doesn't always rain. It would cost the
University a great deal of money to
maintain water in the lake throughout
the year, she said.
Just before I hung up, Jensen revealed
to me the harsh reality of Lake
Lagunita. "Even if we didn't open the
drain, it would eventually leak out or
some of it would evaporate off," she said.
So why the whole cover-up? Why is it
the untold secret?
"The idea is that nobody knows what
we're doing," Jensen answered happily.
"If nobody knows what we're doing, then
we're doing it right."

A fun and filled Lake Lagunita (top) lasts for only four months a year. The other two
thirds of the year the lake is a bowl of mud (bottom). Though speculations abound for
why Lake Lag disappears every June, financial restraints and good old-fashioned
evaporation top the list of waterless explanations.
