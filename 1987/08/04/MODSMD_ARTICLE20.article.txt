# Housing draw has history
## 
### DAVID CLINE 
Every spring quarter, in the midst of
the great weather and, perhaps less of
ten, a 13-unit class load, each Stanford
student must face the housing draw.
Just uttering those two ominous words,
"the Draw," can send any unsuspecting
freshman into convulsions. The reason
for this torture is simple: There is not
enough housing to go around.
Since as far back as the 1930s there
has been a housing crunch at Stanford.
"The demand (for housing) has always
exceeded supply," said Asst. Dean of Stu
dent Affairs Rodger Whitney, director of
the Housing Center. But never has this
problem been more critical than in the
past two decades.
In 1968, there were 300 students on
the waiting list for campus housing after
the second round of the Draw. By 1972,
this number had climbed to over 700.
What created this sharp increase in
demand of on-campus housing?.
"Basically, it was two factors," Whit
ney said. "First of all, the cost of off
campus housing rose considerably.
Second, on-campus housing became
more desirable."
Average rent in Palo Alto skyrocketed
in the early 19705. A University study
showed there was only one apartment
available in the area that was even near
the price of on-campus housing. In the
next few years, there were virtually no
affordable off-campus apartments
available.
While housing prices increased, there
were many changes taking place on
campus. Students became more vocal in
their opposition to the University's so
cial restrictions and in their desire for
more housing options. As a result, the
administration commissioned the Study
of Education at Stanford (SES) in 1967.
SES — composed of over 100 faculty
members and students — conducted a
comprehensive two-year review of the
University which culminated in a set of
recommendations to the Board of Trus
tees.
These 1968 recommendations, in
strumental in making on-campus
housing more desirable, were numerous.
They supported coed housing, suggested
eliminating social restrictions such as
curfews for students, favored more
academically oriented and theme
related houses and pushed for an in
creased role of resident fellows and resi
dent assistants. Within months, the
trustees approved the entire list of rec
ommendations.

To incorporate these new housing op
tions, the student housing draw (as we
know it today) began.
The 1968 draw resembles the one we
use today with only a few exceptions.
While today students can draw in
groups of up to eight, back then no more
than three were allowed to draw to
gether — and they had to be the same
sex. Coed drawing was allowed a few
years later.
In 1974 there were additional changes
made in the Draw.
The computer program used by the
Housing Center was created that year
and the trustees established the policy of
guaranteeing students three years of on
campus housing. Before that date, stu
dents were only guaranteed to live on
campus their first year.

With the creation of the theme houses
in 1981 and completion of Governor's
Corner in 1982, the Draw was once
again adapted. The latest alteration to
the Draw was in 1983 when the draw
pool was divided. Now, numbers up to
3,000 are kept for guaranteed students,
and numbers over 3,000 are for unguar
anteed students.
The next major change in the Draw
may be extending the guaranteed years
to include all four years of undergradu
ate study, Whitney said. However, this
will not take effect until there is enough
housing, which isn't expected to happen
for quite some time.
The Draw is likely here to stay,
forever, to add stress and anxiety to the
otherwise relaxed calm of spring quar
ter.
