# Bookstore continues to give its excess profits to students
## 
### ANDY COHEN 
Anyone who has purchased
textbooks at the Stanford Bookstore
may have been surprised to discover
that occasionally the Bookstore pays its
customers.
The Bookstore's rebate program
exists not out of sheer generosity but
because it is a non-profit organization.
This means.that unlike a corpora
tion, where profits are pulled out of the
company for the stockholders' personal
gain, the Bookstore uses its excess prof
its to pay its loyal patrons.
The reason that the Bookstore is non
profit dates back all the way to 1897,
six years after the University first
opened. A group of professors pooled
their money and bought books in large
quantities. They then set up a store to
provide a convenient location for stu
dents to buy textbooks and supplies at
prices that were very favorable. These
are the events that gave birth to the
Stanford Bookstore.
But soon after they inaugurated this
book-sale program, the professors
found that they were making a profit
and didn't know where the extra money
should go. They finally decided to pull
out their investment and shortly there
after chartered the Stanford Bookstore
as a non-profit organization.
The rebate policy, however, didn't
begin until 1981. Before that time, the
store would just give discounts directly
at the cash registers. Anyone who
showed a faculty, staff or student ID
card would get an immediate discount
on book purchases.
There was at least one problem with
this policy, however. The amount that
was being returned to customers was
uncontrollable. End-of-the-year re
bates, on the other hand, allow the
Bookstore to determine how much
money it has to give back after all the
store's goods are sold.
The decision to initiate the rebate
program was made by the Bookstore's
board of directors, which operates com
pletely independent of the University.
Rosie Sims, operations manager of
the Bookstore, said there has been a
definite improvement in the
Bookstore's financial situation since it
switched to the rebate program. Ac

cording to Sims, before the program the
Bookstore would go in the red every
year because the discounts that it paid
out would always exceed the amount of
excess profits it had each year. It
wouldn't make enough money to cover
its basic expenses.

Candy, supplies and
clothing subsidize the
cost of books

Now, with the rebate program, there
are fewer problems. "It's much more
feasible, and I think we can operate
more efficiently and thereby serve the
customers better," Sims said.
Not everyone is aware of the rebates,
however. Computer operator Bente
Galle has worked at Stanford for 20
years and never knew about the rebate
program.
"They could advertise it a little more
so people are aware of it," she said.
Participation in the rebate program
is relatively simple. Each person is
asked to submit receipts for books paid
for by cash, check or Stanford
Bookstore Charge from May to the fol
lowing April 30 of each year. These
receipts are tabulated and after June
30, the end of the fiscal year, the direc
tors look at the Bookstore's financial
statement and decide how much money
to return to the customers. The rebates
are divided up by the percentage of the
total amount purchased and are mailed
back to the customers each fall.
Although there is no set percentage
for rebates, it has averaged between 14
and 15 percent in recent years.
There is at least one problem with
the rebate program, though. Little
money is made on the sale of books â€”
and sometimes money is even lost. So
in order to ensure that there will be
money left over at the end of the year,
the prices of other goods are raised.
When customers purchase candy,
supplies or clothing, for instance, the
money they spend helps to subsidize
the cost of the books.
