## Breakfast inn provides perfect romantic getaway 
### JAMES R. DICKEY Editorial staff 
If the Hilton's businesslike atmos
phere satisfies you, don't bother going
for a stay at the Babbling Brook Inn.
However, if a romantic weekend at one
of Northern California's oldest and most
beautiful bed-and-breakfast inns sounds
nice, pack your bags for Santa Cruz.
Everything about the Babbling Brook
Inn is perfectly orchestrated to provide
the most relaxing, cordial atmosphere
possible.
The main building, situated on the
foundation of an 1870s tannery, is a nos
talgic log building once owned by a self
proclaimed Austrian countess.
Most of the inn's 12 rooms are spread
around an acre of garden through which
Laurel Creek runs, giving the Babbling
Brook Inn its name.
The gardens are as exquisite as they
are extravagant, originally planted by
the countess and faithfully maintained
by the present innkeepers, Tom and
Helen King.

Every evening from 5:30 on, the Kings
invite their guests to the inn's lovely sit
ting room to enjoy a blazing fire and
partake in a sherry hour, during which
wine, beer and soda are also served.
The Kings also encourage guests to
look through the "review books" the inn
maintains. These helpful notebooks con
sist of entries from past Babbling Brook
guests. Each entry includes a description
of at least one restaurant the guests had
visited and their recommendations con
cerning those establishments. In addi
tion, most of the entries are full of lavish
praise of the King's hospitality. Our own
experience was that this praise was not
unfounded.
My guest and I stayed in the Pisarro
Room (10 of the 12 rooms are named for
French Impressionist artists, the other
two are the Honeymoon Suite and the
Countess, in honor of the inn's former
owner). Like all of the rooms named
after Impressionists, the room was
decorated with prints by the artist and
in the colors most prevalent in his
works.

Most of the inn's rooms have
fireplaces, and the two that do not have
them have whirlpool baths — a
reasonable trade-off considering the sit
ting room's review books indicate that
the baths are large enough to fit two
(snugly, at any rate).
When Tom King showed us to our
room, he pointed out the television — a
portable black-and-white kept in the
closet — explaining that, "The guests do
not come here for our TV."
• What the guests do come for — and
what they get — is a wonderfully relax
ing break from the rules and rituals of
daily life. The Kings encourage the
guests to do whatever seems most pleas
ing. Accordingly, it is not unusual to see
people dining on the private balconies
outside each room or borrowing the pic
nic basket and getting recommendations
for ideal picnicing spots.
The inn also has a selection of card
and board games for the guests in addi
tion to plenty of reading material.
The nicest part about staying at the
Babbling Brook is the completeness of

the service. Nothing is left out. From the
detailing in our room to Helen King's de
licious fresh baked cookies served each
evening, all the amenities home never
had are provide for.
Unlike some bed-and-hreakfast inns,
Babbling Brook serves breakfast buffet
style from 7 a.m. to 10 a.m. daily. Guests
are allowed to dine at the charming
tables around the sitting area and
outside decks, or to take breakfast back
to their rooms on the trays the Kings
thoughtfully provide.
Breakfast is a delicious, wholesome
fare. Granola and yogurt accompany
quiche and bran muffins surrounded by
fresh fruits and breakfast juices. As with
the cookies, all baked goods are made
fresh by Helen King.
Located within blocks of the
boardwalk and downtown Santa Cruz,
the inn is a convenient place to stay on
any weekend getaway. But simply enjoy
ing the peace of the inn's two waterfalls
and the gentle flow of the brook with a
friend can easily fill many hours on some
special weekend.

phere satisfies you, don't bother going
