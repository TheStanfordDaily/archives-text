# 'Charley's Aunt' kicks off vineyard's season
## 
### JIM DURKIN 
The Paul Masson Vineyards
are perched high in the Santa
Cruz Mountains near the
quaint village of Saratoga.
While you might consider
traveling there to do a little
wine tasting on a lazy summer
weekend, you should consider
making the trip to the vine
yards for this summer's Valley
Institute of Theater Arts play
series. I recently watched the
opening play in the series,
"Charley's Aunt," in the vine
yard's breathtaking outdoor
theater.
"Charley's Aunt" tells the
hilarious tale of three Oxford
undergraduates who are in
love. Two of them, Jack and

Charley, invite the objects of
their passion to a luncheon to
meet Charley's rich aunt, only
to find that the aunt must can
cel at the last minute. They
then con a male friend into im
personating the millionaire
aunt.
When the real rich aunt un
expectedly arrives, and the
tyrannical uncle of one of the
girl falls in love with the fake
aunt, uproarious chaos ensues.
As a whole the cast was very
good. Bill Peck performed par
ticularly well as the bogus aunt
Donna Lucia D'Alvadorez from
Brazil, "where the nuts come
from."
Peck seems to have taken
playwright Brandon Thomas's
character and transformed it

into an 18th century version of
Dustin Hoffman's character in
'Tootsie" — with results that
made the audience howl with
laughter even before the
punchlines were delivered.
Besides the excellently acted
play, what made the trip to the
vineyard theater particularly
worthwhile was the atmos
phere.
The stage lies just in front of
an ancient, castle-like vineyard
building. The small outdoor am
phitheater itself is nestled in a
garden knoll where one can see
the lights of the valley
twinkling far below. You get
the feeling that you're watching
theater as it was performed for
the audiences of Shakespeare
and Thomas.
But there are some modern
conveniences at the Masson
theater, too. You can rent
blankets if the night is chilly.
Or purchase a bottle of Sauvig
non at the vineyard store lo
cated a stone's throw from the
theater. You can also take a
walk through the gardens or
watch the workers tend to the
grapes, if you arrive early
enough before the curtain rises.
