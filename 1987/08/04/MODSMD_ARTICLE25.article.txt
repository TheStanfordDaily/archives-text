# Jazz workshop sponsors concerts

For the next two weeks Stanford will be a jazz
hot spot for everyone from the true artist to the
appreciative listener.
The Stanford Jazz Workshop began its annual
series of summer jazz concerts last night in
Campbell Auditorium with music by Mel Martin,
Eddie Marshall, Larry Grenadier and Randy
Vincent. Jazz performances will continue every
night through Friday Aug. 14.
Stanford alumnus and co-director of the jazz
music program, Jim Nadel, founded the Stanford
Jazz Workshop in 1972. "It was founded with the
intention of improving jazz education on the San
Francisco Peninsula," Nadel said.
The workshop tries to provide both a world
class environment for students as well as a gath
ering place and creative outlet for Bay Area jazz
musicians, he said.

"It lets players who are interested in jazz come
to Stanford and check out the scene â€” which aids
in recruiting for and promotion of the academic
jazz program," Nadel said. "The workshop is a
laboratory and forum for exchange of ideas about
jazz education."
The summer concerts are put on in order to
help fund the non-profit workshop. Because all of
the performers are members of the workshop fac
ulty, they are busy teaching when they aren't
performing.
The highlight of the next two weeks will be a
performance on Sunday Aug. 9 in Frost Amphi
theater. Performers will include Nadel's quintet,
Stanford's artist-in-residence Stan Getz and The
Manhattan Transfer, a popular jazz vocal quar
tet.
The show is being presented by the Music De
partment and all the money will go to support the
University's academic jazz program.
