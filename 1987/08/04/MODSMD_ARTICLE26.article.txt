# Lion-style Chinese food
## 
### DANIEL GRANT 
You don't have to go all the
way to San Francisco to enjoy
tasty and authentic Chinese
food. China Lion on El Camino
Real in Palo Alto specializes in
Mandarin and Szechuan cuisine
— and if you are a Chinese food
connoisseur you'll enjoy discov
ering this fine restaurant.
China Lion's menu is wonder
fully diverse, with an ample se
lection of soups, chicken, duck,
beef, pork, seafood and
vegetable dishes. The spicy
Szechuan dishes we tried were
superb.
For the adventurous Chinese
food enthusiast, the Kung-Pao
Chicken is a must. It is a stir
fry dish with diced chicken,
roasted peanuts, chili peppers
and Szechuan spices, and al
though the dish may make your
mouth a little warm, the pep
pers are kept to a minimum.
Those interested in trying
Szechuan dishes, but worried
the dishes may be too spicy, can
have the flavor altered to suit
their taste.
Another highlight of the meal
was the Mu Shu Pork. The
shredded vegetable and egg
stuffing was very fresh and the
plum sauce was wonderfully

tangy and distinctive.
Not only was it some of the
best Mu Shu Pork I've had in a
long time, but China Lion is the
first restaurant I've been to that
has its waiters prepare the first
pancakes for its customers at
the table. Although they get
points for classy service, they
didn't provide enough pancakes
for the dish as there was plenty
of sauce and stuffing left over.

China Lion has a wide vari
ety of exotic soups and for an
average price of $4, you can get
a huge bowl of soup that will
easily serve five or six people.
We tried the Velvet Chicken
with Sweet Corn Soup — which
despite a light, frothy taste, had
corn niblets in it that were
frighteningly reminiscent of
creamed corn.

Unless the soup is your main
course or you're sharing it with
a large group, a cup of the soup
de jour for $1.35 might be a
good alternative.
Considering how many good
Chinese restaurants have a
complete lack of decor, China
Lion's is quite nice. To the left
of the restaurant as you walk in
there is an attractive aquarium
containing a few large, colorful
fish. On the walls are some nice
Oriental knick-knacks among
the domestic beer mirrors that
— although slightly tacky —
are infinitely more classy than
neon beer signs.
As more and more people
came in during the night, the
noise level never became an
noying as Frank Sinatra could
be heard softly "scooby
doobying" in the background at
all times.
China Lion is nice for
Chinese food lovers tired of run
of-the-mill Chinese food restau
rants.
Good food, service, atmos
phere and a splendid time is al
most guaranteed. After all, how
could you not help but like a
place that has fortune cookies
that say: "Lots of good luck is
coming your way?"
