A look at Stanford athletes around the world

McDowell finally
signs with the Sox
After nearly two months of
negotiations, former Stanford
pitching ace Jack McDowell has
agreed to a contract with the
Chicago White Sox.
The contract is a one year
deal worth about $175,000. It
allows the White Sox to retain
the rights to McDowell for six
years. McDowell's agent, Jeff
Moorad, said the deal also in
cludes a provision for McDowell
to make donations to the Stan
ford baseball program and a
Chicago-based charity to be de
termined.
McDowell's first stop on his
journey to the big leagues is
Sarasota, Fla., where he will
spend a week with the White
Sox's rookie league club. He is
then slated to go to Birming
ham, Ala. There he will join the
Sox's Class AA affiliate in the
Southern League.
McDowell's career record at
Stanford was 35-13 with a 3.58
ERA. He was chosen seventh
overall in this year's June draft.
Though he hasn't pitched
since he won the championship
game of the College World Se

ries by a 9-5 score over Okla
homa State, McDowell is enthu
siastic about starting his pro
career. "This is what I wanted
to do all along," he said. "And
I've been sitting around a long
time waiting for it to happen.
But I've been throwing, and I'm
probably in better shape now
than I was at the end of the
(collegiate) season."

Water polo shows
why they're the best
When you're hot, you're hot.
The Stanford water polo team
showed just how good it is over
the weekend. After facing
teams containing most of the
best players in the nation, Stan
ford won the Open National
Championship with a 9-7 vic
tory over Santa Barbara at
deGuerre.
Additionally, Stanford's B
team took fourth after losing
Sunday afternoon to the New
port A team, led by 1984 Olym
pian and Stanford graduate
Jody Campbell.
The Stanford A team,
composed mostly of players
from the team that won the
1986 NCAA championship,
faced Santa Barbara in the final
and fell behind quickly, trailing
3-1 after the first period.
Going into the third quarter
trailing 5-3, the Cardinal came
alive and scored four con
secutive goals to gain a 7-5 ad
vantage going into the fourth
quarter.
With the score 8-6, Santa
Barbara was given four six-on
five power plays in the last four
minutes of the game. Stanford
held tough, allowing only one
conversion, and Greg Gamble's
goal with 3:05 left put the game
out of reach.
David Imbernino, a June

graduate and four-time All-
American, led Stanford with
three goals, while Gamble
added two. The Cardinal hopes
to have another great season
this year as they try to defend
their 1985 and 1986 NCAA
titles.
Swimmers impress
at meet in Fresno
The awesome Stanford
swimming machine made its
presence felt at the U.S. Long
Course National Championship
held in Fresno last week.
While 15-year-old Janet
Evans of Placentia, Calif.,
gobbled up all the publicity,
Cardinal stars of the past and
present did some work of their
own.
Recent graduate Pablo
Morales, the world record
holder in the 100-meter butter
fly, took that event in a time of
53.74. California's Matt Biondi
was second and Stanford's Jay
Mortensdn was third.
Morales also took second in
the 200-meter individual med
ley with a time of 2:03.03. He
was beaten by David Wharton
of Westminster, Pa.
Mortenson's best showing
was in the 100-meter back
stroke where he beat out world
record holder Rick Carey in
56.58.
Junior Jenna Johnson was

second in the 100-meter butter
fly with a time of 1:01.10.
Junior Michelle Donahue was
fourth in the 100-meter back
stroke with a time of 1:03.41.
Tennis, football
recruits see action
When the Stanford men's
tennis team failed to make the
NCAA tournament this past
season it marked its lowest
point in a long time. But if
freshman-to-be David Wheaton
has anything to say in the mat
ter, things should be looking up
very soon.
In the third round of the D.C.
Tennis Classic, held in our na
tion's capital, Wheaton pushed
number-one-ranked Ivan Lendl
to three sets before losing, 6-7,
6-3, 6-2.
Wheaton is currently ranked
428 th in the world.
In the 36th Shrine All-Star
Football Classic, held at the
Rose Bowl in Pasadena Satur
day night, Stanford's defensive
backfield of the future got its
first chance to play together.
Well, three-fourths of it at least.
Incoming freshman Blaik
Nichols, Albert Richardson and
Tuan Van Le played very well
for the North, holding the South
to just 11 completions in 35 pass
attempts.

Tennis, football
recruits see action
When the Stanford men's
tennis team failed to make the
NCAA tournament this past
season it marked its lowest
point in a long time. But if
freshman-to-be David Wheaton
has anything to say in the mat
ter, things should be looking up
very soon.
In the third round of the D.C.
Tennis Classic, held in our na
tion's capital, Wheaton pushed
number-one-ranked Ivan Lendl
to three sets before losing, 6-7,
6-3, 6-2.
Wheaton is currently ranked
428 th in the world.
In the 36th Shrine All-Star
Football Classic, held at the
Rose Bowl in Pasadena Satur
day night, Stanford's defensive
backfield of the future got its
first chance to play together.
Well, three-fourths of it at least.
Incoming freshman Blaik
Nichols, Albert Richardson and
Tuan Van Le played very well
for the North, holding the South
to just 11 completions in 35 pass
attempts.

Jack McDowell, perhaps the
finest pitcher in Stanford his
tory, could be in the majors
within a year.
A look at Stanford athletes around the world

McDowell finally
signs with the Sox
After nearly two months of
negotiations, former Stanford
pitching ace Jack McDowell has
agreed to a contract with the
Chicago White Sox.
The contract is a one year
deal worth about $175,000. It
allows the White Sox to retain
the rights to McDowell for six
years. McDowell's agent, Jeff
Moorad, said the deal also in
cludes a provision for McDowell
to make donations to the Stan
ford baseball program and a
Chicago-based charity to be de
termined.
McDowell's first stop on his
journey to the big leagues is
Sarasota, Fla., where he will
spend a week with the White
Sox's rookie league club. He is
then slated to go to Birming
ham, Ala. There he will join the
Sox's Class AA affiliate in the
Southern League.
McDowell's career record at
Stanford was 35-13 with a 3.58
ERA. He was chosen seventh
overall in this year's June draft.
Though he hasn't pitched
since he won the championship
game of the College World Se

ries by a 9-5 score over Okla
homa State, McDowell is enthu
siastic about starting his pro
career. "This is what I wanted
to do all along," he said. "And
I've been sitting around a long
time waiting for it to happen.
But I've been throwing, and I'm
probably in better shape now
than I was at the end of the
(collegiate) season."

Water polo shows
why they're the best
When you're hot, you're hot.
The Stanford water polo team
showed just how good it is over
the weekend. After facing
teams containing most of the
best players in the nation, Stan
ford won the Open National
Championship with a 9-7 vic
tory over Santa Barbara at
deGuerre.
Additionally, Stanford's B
team took fourth after losing
Sunday afternoon to the New
port A team, led by 1984 Olym
pian and Stanford graduate
Jody Campbell.
The Stanford A team,
composed mostly of players
from the team that won the
1986 NCAA championship,
faced Santa Barbara in the final
and fell behind quickly, trailing
3-1 after the first period.
Going into the third quarter
trailing 5-3, the Cardinal came
alive and scored four con
secutive goals to gain a 7-5 ad
vantage going into the fourth
quarter.
With the score 8-6, Santa
Barbara was given four six-on
five power plays in the last four
minutes of the game. Stanford
held tough, allowing only one
conversion, and Greg Gamble's
goal with 3:05 left put the game
out of reach.
David Imbernino, a June

graduate and four-time All-
American, led Stanford with
three goals, while Gamble
added two. The Cardinal hopes
to have another great season
this year as they try to defend
their 1985 and 1986 NCAA
titles.
Swimmers impress
at meet in Fresno
The awesome Stanford
swimming machine made its
presence felt at the U.S. Long
Course National Championship
held in Fresno last week.
While 15-year-old Janet
Evans of Placentia, Calif.,
gobbled up all the publicity,
Cardinal stars of the past and
present did some work of their
own.
