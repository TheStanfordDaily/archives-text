An article in Friday's Daily
said the University was ordered
to clean up two parcels of
Stanford-owned land con
taminated by toxic chemicals.
In fact, Stanford is only respon
sible for tracing the source of
the contamination and oversee
ing its eventual clean-up. The
University has been involved
because it is the owner of the
land.
The Daily regrets the error.
