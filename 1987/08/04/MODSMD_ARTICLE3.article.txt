# Stanford to fence toxic waste site
## 
### ERIN MARTIN Staff writer 
The University will present a
revised proposal Thursday to
the Palo Alto Architectural
Review Board (ARB) to fence in
a parcel of Stanford-owned land
contaminated by toxic chemi
cals.
If proposal is adopted, a tem
porary six foot chain-link fence
would be erected to keep people
off the land. The proposal also
includes a plan to landscape the
site, formerly the Mayfield
School, located on El Camino
Real.
The Regional Water Quality
Control Board, which discov
ered the contamination earlier
this year, hopes the site will be
free of toxics by 1989, according
to a June 24 report. The source
of the contamination is un
known.
Paula Kakimoto, property
manager for the University De
partment of Lands Manage
ment, said the fence is intended
to protect the land by prevent
ing further pollution and to
protect people who are unaware
of the chemical contamination.
The ARB approved a June 18
proposal to install a fence, but
requested that a different mate

rial be used for construction and
that some sort of landscaping be
included to "soften the appear
ance of the fence," according to
ARB chair Linn Winterbotham.
Winterbotham said that in
the past, the ARB has not
allowed chain-link fences on
streetfront property, "particu
larly on El Camino."
"Because the fence will be in
place for an undetermined pe
riod of time, the ARB would like
to see a higher quality mate
rial," Winterbotham said.
The proposal that will be pre
sented on Thursday has
retained the chain-link provi
sion because, according to
Kakimoto, "the cost of iron or
some other material is abso
lutely prohibitive for a tempo
rary measure."
The landscaping in the
revised proposal was requested
by the ARB. It is necessary for
what Winterbotham described
as "visual mitigation."
Kakimoto said the University
was "willing to put in a few
shrubs to cover up the fence."
Winterbotham also said that
it would be difficult to say what
direction the ARB would take
on the new proposal.
