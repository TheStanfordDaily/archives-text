# Superconductor plan may aid University

Stanford stands to receive significant
federal support to study the properties of
superconducting materials, although the
University will not benefit directly from
President Reagan's recently proposed na
tional superconductivity research program,
Physics Prof. Malcolm Beasley said yester
day.
According to Beasley, former chair of the
Applied Physics Department, the Univer
sity is talking to federal agencies about es
tablishing a major program here.
"We are having discussions with the Air
Force Office of Scientific Research now

about the possibility of forming a center for
research of superconductivity and super
conductive electronics at Stanford," Beas
ley said.
"I hope it will happen. I don't think Stan
ford's going to be left out," he added.
According to Beasley, the discussions
with the Air Force have "been ongoing for
some time" and preceded the announce
ment of Reagan's initiative.
Beasley said the University was first ap
proached formally in June. He attributed
the government's interest in Stanford to the
fact that the University "has been long es
tablished in areas of ceramic films,"
Currently many researchers believe that

thin ceramic films hold the key to commer
cial applications of superconductivity.
Stanford's research will be broad based,
focusing on understanding the material sci
ence aspects of superconductivity as well as
the technological possibliities, Beasley
said.
Although "everything is moving very
quickly" and future developments are hard
to anticipate, the program should be in
place sometime during the next academic
year, Beasley said.
Reagan's "Superconductivity Initiative,"
announced last week, calls for the creation
of four national research
centers to study the commercial
applications of superconducting
materials â€” substances that of
fer no resistance to the flow of
electrical current.
According to Beasley, the
centers will be located at three
Department of Energy laborato
ries and one National Bureau of
Standards laboratory.
One of the research centers
will be at the Lawrence
Berkeley Laboratory at UC-
Berkeley.
The Ames Laboratory in lowa
will coordinate a nationwide ex
change of information on super
conductor physics, and the De
partment of Energy's Argonne

National Laboratory in Illinois
will coordinate research into
large motors and magnetic
fields.
While the Stanford program
under discussion is not con
nected to Reagan's proposed ini
tiative, it is in keeping with the
administration's desire to foster
international competitiveness
in a variety of areas not limited
to superconducting materials,
Beasley said.
Reagan described the new re
search as "a quantum leap in
energy efficiency that would
bring with it many benefits, not
least among them a reduced de
pendence on foreign oil, a
cleaner environment and a
stronger national economy."
Reagan's program contains
three main proposals. Anti
trust regulations would be

relaxed to make joint ventures
easier for manfacturers; patent
laws would be strengthened to
allow companies to seek dam
ages when imported products
infringe patents; and the
Freedom of Information Act
would be modified to allow gov
ernment laboratories to with
hold commercially valuable sci
entific information.
The President's program was
unveiled eight months after
physicists first announced they
had discovered a new class of
superconducting materials.
"The effects of all these dis
coveries will change the world
in ways that we will all have to
stretch our imaginations to con
ceive," said White House Sci
ence Adviser William Graham
in an interview with the New
York Times.
