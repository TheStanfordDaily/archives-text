Stanford stands to receive significant
federal support to study the properties of
superconducting materials, although the
University will not benefit directly from
President Reagan's recently proposed na
tional superconductivity research program,
Physics Prof. Malcolm Beasley said yester
day.
According to Beasley, former chair of the
Applied Physics Department, the Univer
sity is talking to federal agencies about es
tablishing a major program here.
"We are having discussions with the Air
Force Office of Scientific Research now

about the possibility of forming a center for
research of superconductivity and super
conductive electronics at Stanford," Beas
ley said.
"I hope it will happen. I don't think Stan
ford's going to be left out," he added.
According to Beasley, the discussions
with the Air Force have "been ongoing for
some time" and preceded the announce
ment of Reagan's initiative.
Beasley said the University was first ap
proached formally in June. He attributed
the government's interest in Stanford to the
fact that the University "has been long es
tablished in areas of ceramic films,"
Currently many researchers believe that

thin ceramic films hold the key to commer
cial applications of superconductivity.
Stanford's research will be broad based,
focusing on understanding the material sci
ence aspects of superconductivity as well as
the technological possibliities, Beasley
said.
Although "everything is moving very
quickly" and future developments are hard
to anticipate, the program should be in
place sometime during the next academic
year, Beasley said.
Reagan's "Superconductivity Initiative,"
announced last week, calls for the creation
