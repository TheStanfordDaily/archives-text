international networks of fu
ture decision makers and
promote cross-cultural under
standing. A non-profit organi
zation incorporated in 1985, the
Center is headquartered in Co
lumbus, Ind.
"It was a real exchange," said
Silvia Rogers of Physicians for
Social Responsibility, who coor
dinated the campus meetings.
"There was a sharp sharing of
views, even differing ones," she
said.

Sergei Kirillin, 28, chief re
searcher for the Institute for
Space Exploration; Mikhail
Lugachiov, 41, chief of the Eco
nomic Laboratory at Moscow
State University; Mikhail
