### ELEANOR PONOMAREFF 
Four potential Soviet leaders
met with faculty members yes
terday for an open and relaxed
exchange of ideas about politi
cal and economic reforms in the
Soviet Union, according to par
ticipants.
"You see the ymithful en
ergy," said David Wick, staff de
velopment specialist with the
University's personnel depart
ment. "Both sides are looking to
share information and learn
from each other."
The Soviets were here as part
of a 15-member delegation par
ticipating in the US-USSR
Emerging Leaders Program,
sponsored by the American
Center for International Lead
ership. The program is designed
to bring future leaders together
for improved inter-cultural un
derstanding.
The Center sponsors dia
logues between emerging
American leaders, ages 25 to

40, and their counterparts
worldwide. The goal is to form
international networks of fu
ture decision makers and
promote cross-cultural under
standing. A non-profit organi
zation incorporated in 1985, the
Center is headquartered in Co
lumbus, Ind.
"It was a real exchange," said
Silvia Rogers of Physicians for
Social Responsibility, who coor
dinated the campus meetings.
"There was a sharp sharing of
views, even differing ones," she
said.
The Soviet group included
Sergei Kirillin, 28, chief re
searcher for the Institute for
Space Exploration; Mikhail
Lugachiov, 41, chief of the Eco
nomic Laboratory at Moscow
State University; Mikhail
Gratchev, 33, an economist
specializing in innovation man
agement; and Maria Zudina, 21,

The Soviets' visit to Stanford
lopped off a two-week stay in
the United States that included
stops in Washington, D.C., New
York and San Francisco and a
five-day dialogue with their
American counterparts in
Racine, Wis. . Academics,
politicians and artists made up
the multi-professional delega
tion.
"I really wanted to break
through feelings of mistrust
and get beyond the prejudices,"
said Gratchev. "I think we had
some success."
After a morning of discus
sions with Stanford personnel
in related fields, the Soviets had
lunch at the Faculty Club with

Economics Profs. Kenneth Ar
row and Ronald McKinnon and
Political Science Prof. Michael
Boskin.
Arrow described the Soviets
as "well-briefed, very polite and
not controversial or ar
gumentative in any way." The
delegation seemed most inter
ested in "our attitudes toward
the new economic developments
taking place in the Soviet Un
ion," he said.
McKinnon said that the
Soviets were not ''willing to talk
in too much depth," but said
that the meeting made for "good
fellowship."
"I was pleased to see them so
anxious to have an open and
free exchange," said Boskin. "It
was a useful and valuable first
step."
Mary Lucia Bun, a doctoral
candidate in Slavic studies who
acted as interpreter for the lun

cheon, was impressed by the
discussion. "Usually all they do
is exchange greetings and busi
ness cards," she said. "This was
much more substantive. ... I
felt like I was watching future
leaders."
Kirillin spent part of the
morning at the Center for Inter
national Security and Arms
Control, where he met Ameri
can astronaut Sally Ride. Ac
cording to Political Science
Prof. David Holloway, who also
attended, the meeting was
"informal, with interesting con
versation."
Kirillin said it was the high
point of his trip. "I saw all the
secrets," he joked.
Zudina, the only one of the
four who did not speak English,
said she was able to find a
'common language" with the
Americans she met. "We bring
a humanitarian message," she

said.
Activities in the Bay Area
were coordinated through the
Center for US-USSR In
itiatives, located in San Fran
cisco.
Soviets who participate in the
program are selected by the
USSR's Committee of Youth
Organizations, which coordi
nates international exchanges
for Komsomol (the young Com
munist league) and all other So
viet young adult leadership or
ganizations.
