U.S. to hold aid talks with Vietnam
HANOI, Vietnam — A White House-appointed delega
tion agreed yesterday to discuss humanitarian aid for Viet
nam in return for a resumption of talks aimed at accounting
for American servicemen reported as missing in action or
held prisoners of war during the Vietnam War.
In a brief statement issued at the end of three days of
meetings here, the two sides declared the discussions were
limited to humanitarian concerns, including the MIA-POW
issue, and were not linked to questions of diplomatic relations
or U.S. economic aid.
Washington provides no aid of any kind to the pro-Soviet
government of Vietnam, victors in the war of the 1960s and
early 1970s over the U.S.-backed South Vietnamese regime.
The 107-word statement said two sets of meetings would
take place in the near future, "one to discuss next steps to
resolve MIA issues, and one to discuss urgent Vietnamese
humanitarian concerns."
Gen. John Vessey Jr., the former chairman of the joint
chiefs of staff who is President Reagan's hand-picked emis
sary, refused to answer questions after the statement was
read to a crowded room of reporters and diplomats.
House OKs banking fund bailout
WASHINGTON — On a lopsided, bipartisan vote, the
House approved sweeping bank reform legislation yesterday
providing $10.8 billion for the beleaguered federal insurance
fund that guarantees deposits in the nation's savings and
loan institutions.
The bill, which is expected to receive quick approval in the
Senate, also provides new banking protections for consumers
— including a rule that banks must clear out-of-state checks
and make flmds available from them within four days of a
customer's deposit.
Other provisions would require banks to tell customers the
maximum amount of interest payments they would be liable
for under adjustable rate home mortgage loans, and ban the
creation of additional "non-bank banks" run by department
stores and other businesses.
If President Reagan signs the legislation, as he is expected
to, new funds would become available immediately to shore
up the Federal Savings and Loans Insurance Corporation.
The money would be generated through sales of long-term
bonds and would not come from the federal treasury, sponsors
said.
DEA investigates Panamanian leader
WASHINGTON — Panamanian strongman Manuel An
tonio Noriega is the focus of a major federal drug conspiracy
investigation and is suspected of providing protection to
cocaine trafficking and money laundering operations in
return for hefty payoffs, federal law enforcement sources said
yesterday.
The probe by a federal grand jury in Miami is being
pursued despite a split within the Reagan administration
about whether to press for Gen. Noriega's ouster, with CIA
and Pentagon officials reportedly maintaining that the fall of
the Panamanian defense chief could endanger U.S. military
bases in Panama.
Investigators charge that Noriega allegedly has been skim
ming as much as 1.5 percent of the value of drug shipments
and drug-related money transfers passing through Panama
for several years. They say that attempts by Noriega to in
crease his percentage prompted people with knowledge of the
scheme to come to U.S. authorities and contribute to the case
being built by Drug Enforcement Administration agents.
Aides divided on Reagan speech
WASHINGTON — With the public segment of the con
gressional Iran-contra investigation completed, President
Reagan's aides are arguing about whether Reagan should use
next week's expected speech to criticize Congress for a politi
cally motivated inquiry or to take a more conciliatory stance.
Either way, according to White House officials and others,
the address is likely to give short shrift to the Iran-Contra af
fair itself and to focus instead on Reagan's goals for the
remaining 17 months of his term. The goal, they say, will be
to shift public attention away from what has become the most
damaging period in the Reagan presidency.
The speech has not been announced, and the precise date
has not been determined. White House spokesman Marlin
Fitzwater conceded that "a lot of people have different ideas
about what should be in it."
Conservatives are pressing for Reagan to "take on
Congress and the hearing process," according to sources
inside and outside the White House. "Right now that view
holds sway," said a Republican source with ties to the senior
White House staff.
But Reagan could be motivated to take a more accommo
dating stance, this source said, if the White House and
Congress should settle their long and bitter quarrel over the
size and shape of the controversial fiscal 1988 budget.
