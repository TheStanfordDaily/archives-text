# Iran-contra hearings are finished

### 
WASHINGTON — The Iran
contra hearings ended yester
day, bringing to a close a gruel
ing, three-month public inquiry
into high-level trickery that ap
parently cleared President
Reagan of wrongdoing while
leaving an indelible scar on his
presidency.
"The story has now been
told," said Sen. Daniel Inouye,
D-Hawaii, chair of the Senate
panel, as he gaveled the
hearings to a close. "I believe
we have largely succeeded in
piecing together the incredible
chapters of this chilling story
and presenting to our fellow
citizens a chronology of events
as they occurred."
Inouye noted that the Senate
and House investigating com
mittees, which jointly heard 29
witnesses in 40 days of public

testimony, privately inter
viewed nearly 500 people and
reviewed about 250,000 pages
of documentary evidence, had
completed the task much faster
than their historical counter
part — the Senate Watergate
Committee, which had 53 days
of hearings.
In concluding statements,
Republicans as well as Demo
crats agreed that Reagan's deci
sion to sell arms to Iran was "an
act of folly," as Sen. Warren
Rudman, R-N.H., termed it, and
that members of Reagan's staff
— namely former national secu
rity adviser John Poindexter
and his aide, Marine Lt. Col.
Oliver North — had abused
their power by diverting sale
profits to the Nicaraguan
rebels.
But Republicans were quick

to emphasize that the investiga
tion had uncovered no evidence
that Reagan himself violated
any law. "These hearings have
demonstrated conclusively, in
my opinion, that the president
has indeed been telling the
truth," said Rep. Dick Cheney,
R-Wyo., vice chair of the House
panel.
"There is no evidence that the
president had any knowledge of
the diversion of profits from the
arms sale to the Nicaraguan
Democratic resistance."
Rudman added that Reagan's
personal diaries, portions of
which were made available to
the committees but never made
public, support the conclusion
that he was unaware of the di
version.
