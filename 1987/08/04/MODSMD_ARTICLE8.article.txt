## Zete status still up in the air 
### LIZ LEMPERT Staff writer 
The University expects to reach a final deci
sion on the fate of the Zeta Psi fraternity
"probably by the end of this week," acting Dean
of Student Affairs Norm Robinson said yester
day.
Robinson said he has already received advice
from Fraternal Affairs Adviser Joe Pisano and
Asst. Dean of Student Affairs Diana Conklin,
and is now waiting to hear from representatives
of the Zetes.
Pisano and Conklin agreed that "some separa
tion (suspension) would be helpful for the frater
nity," Robinson said.
The possible suspension of the Zetes stems
from a number of incidents in the past few years
that culminated in the alcohol-related drowning
of junior David Dunshee last April after he left a
Zete rush party at the Boathouse.
The fraternity demonstrated "substantial dis
regard of Interfraternity Council (IFC) policies
and Boathouse rules and regulations" at the

party, according to a report prepared by Asst. to
the Provost Michael Jackson.
As a result, Stanford's alcohol policy is also un
der scrutiny. Unlike the decision on the Zete
chapter's status, however, the University's alco
hol policy will remain in limbo throughout most
of autumn quarter, Robinson said.
An eight-member group, headed by Pisano and
Conklin, is currently discussing ways to improve
enforcement of existing guidelines. Robinson ap
pointed ne group in mid-July and instructed it to
prepare a report by August 30 that makes
"recommendations addressing the issues as they
relate specifically to residences and to non
residential student organizations."
Robinson said that after the group issues its
report, he will seek input from the campus at
large and make a decision "toward the end of au
tumn quarter."
Robinson conceded that these matters are "not
top priority" and that "other things are more im
mediate" at this time. However, he said he will
definitely make a decision on the Zetes before the
beginning of fall.
