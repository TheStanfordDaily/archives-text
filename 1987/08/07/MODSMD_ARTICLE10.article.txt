# Theme houses foster diversity
## 
### 
Ken Whitney's July 31 letter urged the Office
of Residential Education to end the ethnic theme
house program. I, too, lived in an ethnic theme
house, but my impression of them is different.

VIEWPOINT:
LLOYD MAYER

Whitney urges elimination of ethnic theme
houses in order to promote "racial and cultural
harmony." However, in these houses there is an
attempt to foster cultural diversity while main
taining racial and cultural harmony. One of the
great benefits of ethnic theme houses is that they
allow other cultures to thrive along with the
mainstream American culture of Stanford.
Certain individuals do choose to isolate them
selves from the "outside world" in ethnic theme
houses. But there are many other ways for these
individuals to isolate themselves. Trying to elim
inate all such possibilities of escape from the
"outside world," however, would mean abolishing
all freshman dorms, frats, academic theme
houses and student groups as well as ethnic
theme houses.
Stanford is integrated because it allows a large
number of different groups to exist together
peacefully. People who choose to spfcnd more time
with one group than any other have that right.
Whitney's arguments center on teaching racial
harmony, which he seems to equate with ethnic
minorities being forced to deal with an environ
ment where whites make up the majority.
But in most of the world, and soon in Califor
nia, whites will not be in the majority. Isn't it ed
ucational for some of them to learn what it is like

to be in the minority? The experience may help
them understand other ethnic groups better, and
also help them deal with the reality that whites
are often in the minority.
Whitney notes that the ethnic theme houses
reduce the number of minority students in non
theme houses, who therefore feel isolated. He
also states that this lack of minority students in
non-theme houses will cause non-minority stu
dents to not have to deal with living an integra
ted lifestyle.
Frankly, the 50 students of each ethnic back
ground who are in the respective ethnic theme
houses, when divided between all the other
residences, will probably not make a big dent
either way. But together in one place, these 50 or
so students become a powerful force for celebrat
ing, maintaining and educating others (and
themselves) about their culture.
Further, note the academically oriented thenje
houses, such as the French House, the Italian
House and the American Studies House. They
can certainly serve as places for students of cer
tain academic disciplines to isolate themselves.
Surely the cultures celebrated in ethnic theme
houses deserve as much attention as these
various Western cultures.
A final note: One of his experiences, which
Whitney cites as an example of the promotion of
racial harmony, is the voluntarily integrated
inner-city grammar school he attended. This
school was no doubt a great means of letting two
ethnic groups meet and share experiences.
However, it did not demand that either group
eliminate the cultural home they had come from.
We also go to class together at Stanford, only
some of the classrooms are in the dorms.
