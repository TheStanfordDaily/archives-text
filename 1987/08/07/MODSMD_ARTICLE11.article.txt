# 'Hoover essays' give misleading view of Stanford
## 
### 
The Hoover Institution publishes a quar
terly collection of newspaper, op-ed and
magazine articles by its fellows, staff and
authors. Hoover's writers are prolific, you
quickly learn from perusing the collection,
and they write for the most widely read
newspapers in the country.

These "Hoover Essays," as the collection
is called, are from such newspapers as The
New York Times, the Wall Street Journal,
The Washington Post and the Los Angeles
Times.
The collection from the first quarter of
this year includes articles with titles like,
"This Ploy By Soviets Too Good To Be
True," " 'Compassion' Leads the List of Pet
Peeves," "Who Will Pay the Baby-Boomers'
Social Security" and "An Alternative to
Contadora." The flavor of the titles is gen
erally conservative and the articles do not
disappoint one's expectations.
"Hoover Essays" illustrates why the
Hoover Institution belongs in the trium
virate of American conservative think
tanks, along with American Heritage and
the American Enterprise Institute. Unlike

Hoover, however, the latter two operate
outside the purview of any other institu
tion.
Despite the insights offered by the arti
cles themselves, "Hoover Essays" rankled
me on the whole. It typifies my discontent
with the relationship between Stanford and
the Hoover Institution.
"Hoover Essays" is a conservative publi
cation, bearing the Stanford name and ex
hibiting Stanford's most prominent
landmark. It collects in one place much of
the popular literature by which the rest of
the nation judges Stanford.
The readership of "Hoover Essays," one
would suppose, is small. The readership of
The New York Times, et al., we all know, is
considerably larger. And a steady diet of ar
ticles, identified as being from"The Hoover
Institution, Stanford University," is
enough to generate the incredible belief
among well-read people that Stanford is po
litically conservative.
This is not to lend credence to William
Randolph Hearst Jr.'s recent spleen-letting
in the Sunday San Francisco Examiner.
Stanford is not doctrinaire liberal, either.
Stanford accommodates, as it should, as
sorted views â€” including those of the
Hoover Institution. What is at issue with
Hoover is not the views themselves but
their uniformity and institutionalization. It
is objectionable that one will seldom err in
assuming a publication from the Hoover In
stitution to have a conservative slant to it.
Predictability of this magnitude does not

exist in the published work from other
parts of the University.
The implicit rationale behind Hoover's
insularity is to protect the right-thinking
community from the depradations of an un
friendly world. Conservatives often com
plain that they are made to feel unwelcome
in an academic environment where liberals
do, in fact, prevail. They point to the ab
sence in university departments of conser
vative views and registered Republicans as
evidence. Any conservative worth her salt
can tell you, though, that a lack of repre
sentation does not necessarily indicate dis
crimination.
The reality, as hard as it may come (and
as regrettable as it may be), is that liberals
simply outnumber conservatives among
elite academics, particularly in the social
sciences. It is one thing to say that univer
sity faculties are overwhelmingly liberal. It
is quite another to say that liberalism is in
stitutionally supported.
A certain unwillingness to concede
legitimacy to conservative thought does ex
ist in academic circles. And the work of the
Hoover Instition does indeed argue per
suasively for the due consideration of con
servative scholarship.
In itself, such a mission is acceptable,
even laudable. Within the institutional
framework of Stanford, such a mission is
anomalous and is carried out at the expense
of the University's name and reputation.
