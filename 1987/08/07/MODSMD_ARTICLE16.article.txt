## The 						'president's man' celebrates 32 years with the Farm 
### TARRANT MAHONY Staff writer 
The sign on his door shows a sad
looking dog and in German reads:
Unfortunately I have to stay outside."
But the warm and personable man on
the inside says, "Come on in."
The man on the inside is Bob
Hamrdla, since 1977 the assistant to
University President Donald Kennedy
and the liason between the Office of the
President, the Board of Trustees and the
student body.
"I have a lot of involvement with un
dergraduate life now," Hamrdla said,
adding that he is the person whom stu
dent groups first see if they want to talk
with Kennedy.
His bookshelf, full of red leather
bound trustees' minutes, indicates
Hamrdla's other main responsibility:
taking care of trustees' affairs, such as
setting up meetings, creating agendas
and preparing minutes. "If a trustee
needed a parking permit, they would
probably call me," Hamrdla joked.
"The last line of my contract reads
'any other task assigned by the presi
dent,' " he said.

Hamrdla first came to Stanford as a
freshman in 1955 and has been with the
University ever since, working both in
California and Germany. Originally
planning to major in mechanical engi
neering, he went to the Stanford-in-
Germany campus as a senior and ended
up a mathematics major, finishing his
bachelor's after five years. He then spent
two years in Germany as the assistant to
the overseas campus' director and
returned to Stanford in 1962 to complete
a master's in history.
"Being overseas changed my direc
tion," Hamrdla said, perhaps an under
statement considering that he lived in
Germany for a total of five years on
three separate occassions and has visited
East Germany every year since 1968.
Hamrdla taught freshman English
seminars and writing classes with an
East German theme for 15 years, the
most recent being a Wilbur Hall fresh
man seminar titled, "Would I have been
a Nazi?"
"Many people say, T would never have
been a Nazi,' Hamrdla said, "so I pro
posed a tutorial on that subject. It was a
wonderful teaching experience."
Aside from teaching, Hamrdla has

been active in undergraduate life
through his many years as a resident as
sistant and resident fellow. In 1967
Hamrdla was the RA at Lambda Nu,
taking part in a program in which young
University staff members, instead of stu
dents, worked as RAs.

After Lambda Nu, Hamrdla became
the RA at the Sigma Alpha Epsilon
house and began a long association with
that fraternity. On his wall hangs a
"citation for distinguished service,"
which he received for his 15 years as an
adviser to the national SAE chapter.
"I enjoyed being an RA," Hamrdla
said, "If it weren't for that I probably
wouldn't be student liason now.
"I hate the phrase, 'working with
people.' It doesn't say anything,"
Hamrdla said. "But one of the things I
like about my job is that I have a lot of
contact with people.
"I like organizing. I'm better at taking
somebody's concept and putting it into
operation than coming up with the idea
in the first place," Hamrdla added.
"I also like writing and do a lot of it.
Someday I want to go hide somewhere
for six months and write a book," he
said.
As for the dog on the door, that is a
holdover from the late 19605. According
to Hamrdla, back then mangy-looking
students would occupy the president's of
fice and bring their mangy-looking pets
with them. "I like dogs," Hamrdla said,
"but not in my office."
