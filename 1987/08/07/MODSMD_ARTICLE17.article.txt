# Stanford: prime target for eating disorders
## 
### LYDIA SELLING 
In recent decades, Western society started to place a
great value on thinness. A 1980 study of Playboy cen
terfolds and Miss America winners found that their
bust, hip and weight measurements have greatly
decreased in the past 25 years. This emphasis on thin
ness plays a significant, role in the development of
eating disorders by tempting women into abnormal
eating patterns.

Dr. John Schneider, clinical psychologist and associ
ate director of the Eating Disorders Clinic, cites a un
precedented concern for appearance among college stu
dents as the predominant reason for the increasing
evidence of eating disorders.
Anorexia nervosa and bulimia — the most perplex
ing of eating disorders — are syndromes characterized
by an intense preoccupation with food. Those who suf
fer from anorexia nervosa experience extreme weight
loss, body-image distortion and intense fear of becom
ing obese. Bulimia, different from anorexia nervosa, is
distinguished by binge-eating episodes, self-induced
vomiting, fasting or the use of diuretics, which increase
the flow of urine, and laxatives.
Anorexia nervosa and bulimia affect as many as 5 to
10 percent of adolescent girls and young women. Most
sufferers are white and come from middle- to upper
middle-class families. According to recent medical
studies, the incidence of anorexia nervosa has doubled

in the past 20 years. It is unclear whether this figure
represents an increase in the incidence of the syndrome
itself or an increase in awareness of the syndrome.
Dr. Harvey Weinstein, a psychiatrist and director of
Counseling and Psychological Services at Cowell Stu
dent Health Center, has had much experience treating
female students for eating disorders. "Every study we
have done has shown women at Stanford have prob
lems with body image and diet," Weinstein said.
"Generally, this is a problem with women in this age
group. It is definitely gender-related. The ranges for
various college populations vary between 5 to 19 per
cent. Stanford probably falls somewhere in the
middle," he added.
According to Weinstein, there are usually from 25 to
30 students in treatment at Cowell for bulimia at any
one time. For some women, it is only a temporary
phase. On the average, Cowell treats one to two
anorexics per year. According to Weinstein, there are
other students who are not true anorexics but fall just
above the line, clinically.
The awareness of bulimia has increased dramati
cally since the late 19705. Bulimia used to be consid
ered psychiatric hysteria. Only recently has bulimia
been recognized as a distinct sydrome.
Dr. John Bachman, a clinical psychologist with a
private practice in Menlo Park, counsels some of the
bulimic patients from Cowell. Many students at Stan
ford, according to Bachman, come from family back
grounds that "emphasize a perfection-oriented, high
expectation atmosphere." There may also be "pressure
and tendency in the family from which they come to
repress feelings," he said.
Eating disorders, Bachman said, often surface when
women go away to college, since that is a time of
profound anxiety.
According to Ana Cupp, a nurse practitioner at

According to psychologist John Bach
man, many Stanford students come
from families that emphasize perfection
and where there is pressure to repress
feelings. Eating disorders occasionally
result from this anxiety.

Cowell, Stanford students tend to fall into the socioeco
nomic group in which bulimia is most common.
Clinical bulimia, Bachman's statistics show, is in 2
to 5 percent of the population. Reports of occasional
binge eating are much higher than the actual clinical
bulimic.
Alice Supton, assistant dean of Student Affairs,
ensures that the training for resident fellows and resi
dent assistants includes competence in recognizing
signs of eating disorders and knowledge of referral
sources. According to Supton, trying to "maintain a
balance between showing interest and concern and in
appropriate intervention" is stressed.
The Bridge, the University's peer counseling center,
provides services for students who feel they may have
an eating disorder. According to Sara Spears, a coun
selor at the Bridge, "Food is inexpensive and legal. It's
rare to go to parties where there isn't food. People go
out to dinner — it is so imbedded in the social culture.
Women are especially imbedded in the culture with
preparation of food."
Support groups at the Bridge operate under the as
sumption that the individual needs help in order to
achieve a healthier life where he or she is not ruled by
a food compulsion.
