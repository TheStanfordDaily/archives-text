## Crosby, Stills and Nash: still a powerhouse 
### STEVE RUSSELL 
Concord is a hell of a long way from Palo
Alto, but the drive was worth it as the Con
cord Pavilion, booked to capacity, provided
the perfect environment for listening to a
trio of musicians now in their 18th year of
performing together: Crosby, Stills and
Nash.
The boys were all right. Graham Nash,
descended from British rockers The Hollies,
is still in suberb voice and looks well
treated by Father Time. Stephen Stills, late
of Buffalo Springfield, turned in licks and
riffs on his various six-strings that leave
younger guitarists in the dust. David
Crosby looked, shall we say, teddy
bearesque, recovering from his latest incar
ceration. But who cares about his rebel
liousness? The guy harmonizes beautifully.
With a format that hasn't changed since I
first saw them at Woodstock, the group
opened with an acoustical set containing
their old standards sprinkled with a few
new tunes. The sonorous sensitivities of
"Gueneviere" demonstrated why their
music is still a benchmark.
A rendition of the Beatles' tune
"Blackbird" was especially melodic. After a
solo each, the guys ended with "Suite: Judy
Blue Eyes," which, as trivia buffs and 1960s
relics recall, is Stills' love sonnet to Judy
Collins — remember her?
Enough pretty stuff — let's rock. For the
second set CS&N were joined by some of the
slickest side men in the business. Stills'
long-time touring partners Michael Fin

nigan — keyboardist extraordinare — and
Joe Lala on percussion added sugar and
spice to the performance. Joe Vitali on
drums and Bob Brown on bass — from
Jackson Browne's band — filled in the
cracks for an hour and a half of solid, get
down, we-still-got-it rock 'n' roll.

The set opened with Stills' "Love the One
You're With" to get the juices flowing. Then
Crosby attempted to rock out with his new
tune, "Night Time For Generals." He
looked pretty silly trying to "shake his
bootie," but he's happy and the crowd ate it
up. So what can I say?
After a ho-hum rendition of "Dark Star,"
Nash, the inveterate political activist, in
troduced his latest comment, "Soldiers Of
Peace," presumably to remind us about the

horror of Vietnam and to admonish us
about Central America. It got a standing
ovation — point taken.
The threesome's whale song, "Wind On
The Water," started with a prerecorded
voice-over of the acappella introduction.
Disappointing. But hey, they recovered big
time with "Long Time Coming" followed by
the classic Buffalo Springfield tune "For
What It's Worth" (you remember: "Stop,
children. What's that sound?") Stills and
Finnigan swapped searing licks through
out.
The second set closed with "Southern
Cross." At this point the crowd was on its
feet, in the aisles. The security people did
their best, but the audience knew better.
Next came what can best be described as
their encore set. The first tune was
"Wooden Ships," again with Stills and Fin
nigan dominating the scene. After a quick
walkoff, back again for "Teach Your
Children." And, again after a walkoff, the
boys knocked off for the night with "Our
House," accompanied by a 10,000-voice
backup. Moving.
It's good to see these guys still on stage
and still enjoying themselves. Their sound
is clean and controlled, better than ever.
However, for my money, Stills was the star
and I look forward to another solo effort
from him.
CS&N didn't end the show with "Find
The Cost Of Freedom." Oh well, I guess
some things have to change. Crosby, Stills
and Nash play the Shoreline Amphitheater
in Mountain View tonight at 8 p.m.
