# Changes may aid passage
## Western Culture plan may be modified 
### BRIAN RHOADS Senior staff writer 
Critics and proponents of a
revamped Western Culture program
hope to find common ground in the
revised recommendations of the
Western Culture Task Force, ex
pected to be presented to the Faculty
Senate fall quarter, English Prof.
Herbert Lindenberger said.
"I've heard through the grapevine
that it might meet our demands,"
said Lindenberger, a critic of the
original proposal issued by the task
force in the spring.
Lindenberger said the task force is
rewriting "vague" recommendations
and considering faculty objections to
the first proposal.
The spring report called on West
ern Culture tracks to focus on a non-
European culture, abolish the core

list of readings and include primary
texts by women and minorities.
Critics said the original recommen
dations require a breadth of knowl
edge beyond the capacity of most in
structors and call for the elimination
of essential core readings.
The spring report is under discus
sion by the University administra
tion. Dean of Undergraduate Studies
Thomas Wasow said he has read "a
report with recommendations, and I
have discussed it with one member of
the task force." But, he said, nothing
official has been decided.
The proposal is unlikely to escape
debate.
"I'm sure there will be very exten
sive discussion on it as it is a proposal
which would have far-reaching ef
fects on undergraduate education,"
Wasow said. "Nothing [will come]
quickly or quietly."

Some of the faculty are in favor of
change. "I'm all for changing the pro
posal," said Classics Prof. John
Winkler, a lecturer for the Conflict
and Change Western Culture track.
A major objection to the initial pro
posal was that the minimum time pe
riod to be covered in the course was
too short. By only going back five cen
turies, everything "before America
was discovered" may be neglected, ac
cording to Lindenberger.
One problem Lindenberger fears
will not be addressed in the new pro
posal is the fate of the one quarter,
non-Western culture requirement, if
the Western Culture program is
restructured to include non-Western
culture material. He recommended
that "perhaps a four-quarter course
could be taught with at least a full
quarter devoted to non-Western cul
ture."
