The Living Daylights
Century 10
1500 Stierlin Road, Mountain View
Bond is back, this time to escort a
defecting Soviet general and his
girlfriend to safety. Things naturally go
haywire, and Bond spends the rest of the
movie uncovering a plot that includes
opium-smuggling Afghans, a Strad
ivarius cello and Joe Don Baker as a
double-dealing gunrunner. The opening
scene is the best since "Thunderball"
and the action as a whole is quite satisfy
ing. Die-hard Bond fans will be happy to
know that the roles of both "M" and "Q"
are being re-created by the same actors
who have played them in the last three
films. Here is what some Daily staffers
think of the movie:
Timothy Dal ton is fine. I mean, he is
fine. "The Living Daylights" shows this
guy is a real charmer.
The chase scenes are smashing even
by the best 007 standards, and if the Sat
urday night Century 10 audience is a
good response meter, this film is a
darned good time. I wouldn't say it's per
fect, because the leading actress is only a
new and equally unfortunate version of

the shallow harem that has preceded
her. This time she's so innocent you
want to shake her — and Bond doesn't
shake her for most of the movie, a
change in our hero that the moviegoers
may or may not approve. Still, this is
definitely one to put at the top of the list.
- Elaine Riggs, opinions editor
Timothy Dalton looked like a reptile
and could not say "shaken, not stirred"
right. His female sidekick was a
stereotyped, anorexic airhead with a
pitiful Russian accent who kept flitting
between complete helplessness and
sniper capability.
Still, the movie was a blast, providing
enough excitement to give me a hernia,
some gorgeous scenery and gadgets
aplenty. Rest assured — they have not
forgotten to give Bond a car armed to the
teeth and a key ring that is really a
bomb. All that and it even avoids the
stagnation that plagued the last two
lame, formula Bond films. One conniv
ing triple agent. One Oxford-brand Af
ghan rebel. One friendly Russian KGB
director. One shot-up cello. Two breasts.
Twenty-plus dead bodies. One fake dead
body. Four stars. I say check it out.

After languishing in the doldrums of
two-dimensional adventure, James Bond
returns in"The Living Daylights" as a
regular guy who we believe actually
could be doing all those dangerous
things. No more flabby Roger Moore
daintily dispatching villains in a white
dinner jacket.
Timothy Dalton, while he lacks Sean
Connery's commanding presence, comes
across as a believable Bond, and he's
helped by a plot that for once gives the
audience something to think about
besides what the next pun will be. This
Bond still downs shaken martinis, still
carries a gaggle of gadgets and still
steals female hearts. Except now he is
monogamous, which may not be such a
good thing since his fragile female com
panion can't seem to do much but fret
about him. Nonetheless, "Living
Daylights" is the best Bond flick I've
seen in years, and Timothy Dalton is the
reason.
-A.J. Thomas, news editor
"The Living Daylights" doesn't put
gadgetry at center stage, and I under
stand that Producer Albert Broccoli will
continue to give Timothy Dalton room to
act. So far, it seems promising that Dal

ton will.
His Bond is intense, driven by a dedi
cation to do good. That's a real departure
from Roger Moore's character, who was a
spy for the fun of it, and Sean Connery's,
who secretly enjoyed killing so much
that I bet if her majesty hadn't signed
him up, he would have worked for the
bad guys.
I hope Dalton follows Connery's lead
and brings some depth to the character.
His new monogamy and human caring
add to the good guy image, but I'd like to
see more scenes that show Bond's darker
side, like the one in "Daylights" where
Dalton readies to kill a KGB officer in
cold blood.

The new Bond passes with flying
jeeps. He is a Bond for the 1980s. But
isn't it about time the Bond women fol
lowed suit? As Bond's female companion,
Maryam d'Abo was not merely disap
pointing, but came very close to spoiling
the show with her gutless whine. Bond
manages to survive modernationization
with charm intact. Would a little charac
ter and competence in his sidekick be too
much to ask?

panion can't seem to do much but fret
about him. Nonetheless, "Living
Daylights" is the best Bond flick I've
seen in years, and Timothy Dalton is the
reason.

"The Living Daylights" doesn't put
gadgetry at center stage, and I under
stand that Producer Albert Broccoli will
continue to give Timothy Dalton room to
act. So far, it seems promising that Dal

ton will.
His Bond is intense, driven by a dedi
cation to do good. That's a real departure
from Roger Moore's character, who was a
spy for the fun of it, and Sean Connery's,
who secretly enjoyed killing so much
that I bet if her majesty hadn't signed
him up, he would have worked for the
bad guys.
I hope Dalton follows Connery's lead
and brings some depth to the character.
His new monogamy and human caring
add to the good guy image, but I'd like to
see more scenes that show Bond's darker
side, like the one in "Daylights" where
Dalton readies to kill a KGB officer in
cold blood.

The new Bond passes with flying
jeeps. He is a Bond for the 1980s. But
isn't it about time the Bond women fol
lowed suit? As Bond's female companion,
Maryam d'Abo was not merely disap
pointing, but came very close to spoiling
the show with her gutless whine. Bond
manages to survive modernationization
with charm intact. Would a little charac
ter and competence in his sidekick be too
much to ask?
