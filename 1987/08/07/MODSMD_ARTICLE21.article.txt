## Hmm.... maybe — Giants could come out on top 
### 
A week ago in this space I suggested
the Oakland A's had a realistic chance of
winning the American League West this
season. As of last night they are
percentage points ahead of the Minne
sota Twins, leading the division.

There are 55 games left to play and
the A's have clearly not sewn anything
up yet. Nevertheless, maybe the magic
that worked on the men from Oakland
can work for the guys across the Bay.
If you take a look at the National
League West you can see why the Giants
have a good chance of coming out on top.

The three contenders are the Cincinnati
Reds, the Houston Astros and the
Giants. The Reds are on top of the pack
with a 58-50 record, hardly enough to
conjure up images of the '86 Mets.
The Giants are currently in third
place and in the midst of a slump, having
lost four straight and seven of their last
10.
Compounding their problems is the
fact that the Reds just reactivated Kal
Daniels. With Daniels in the lineup the
Reds excellent offensive machine is, in a
word, awesome.
In the Giants favor, though, they prob
ably have the deepest pitching of the
three contenders. In the stretch drive,
pitching may very well make the differ
ence.
In starting pitching, the Giants have a
big edge over the Reds. Mike Krukow
seems to be returning to the form that
allowed him to win 20 games last year.
With Krukow, Kelly Downs, Dave

Dravecky and Atlee Hammaker, the
Giants have four solid starters.
The Reds ace is Bill Gullickson, and
he's given up 30 homers already. They
also have a Guy named Hoffman, Ron
Robinson and Tom Browning.
Hoffman and Robinson are good relief
pitchers, Browning wasn't even good in
the minors this year.
The Reds bullpen has Rob Murphy and
John Franco, certainly one of the best
righty-lefty duos in the game. But, Reds
manager Pete Rose has warmed up
Murphy nearly every day and he very
well might wear out before its over.
The Giants, on the other hand, have
all the pieces in hand. The acquisition of
Don Robinson from the Pirates last
week, along with the pick up of Craig
Lefferts from the Padres last month,
gives them a lot to work with.
Robinson and Lefferts mesh nicely
with the other Robinson, Jeff that is, and
the enigmatic Scott Garrelts. Garrelts

throws the ball over 95 mph and has a
devastating split-finger fastball. By all
right he should be in the top echelon
among relievers. He isn't, but can be.
Admittedly, the Giants everyday
players don't match up to their Cincin
nati counterparts.
The Reds have the aforementioned
Daniels, Tracy Jones and the great Eric
Davis all with power, speed and
averages over .300. They've also got
Buddy Bell, future Hall-of-Famer Dave
Parker and the National League's
Player of the Month for July, Bo Diaz.
Clearly, the Giants have an uphill bat
tle ahead of them. To catch the Reds they
have to first leap over the Astros — no
easy feat in itself. But if they shake the
doldrums they're in now, they should be
ready for the war in September. And
who knows, after they read this, maybe
they'll get down to business.
