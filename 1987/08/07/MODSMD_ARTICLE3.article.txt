# University tries to block drug testing
## News 
### LIZ LEMPERT Staff writer 
Stanford filed a request Wednesday for a court
order exempting the University from enforcing
the NCAA's drug-testing policy while the case
against the tests is being tried.
If the University's request is granted, all Stan

mitting to drug testing.
The University also asked the Santa Clara
County Superior Court to grant a temporary

the risk of severe penalties, " Zumwalt said in a

suggestion [to refuse to comply with the drug
testing rules] it will become subject to discipli
nary or corrective action under established
NCAA procedures for failure to fulfill its obliga

If Stanford does not obtain consent forms or al

forms, the NCAA can penalize the University in
a number of ways, according to Athletic Director
Andy Geiger.
"It can refuse to allow Stanford teams and ath
letes to participate in any championships or post
season games," Geiger said. "It can take away
team and individual championships. It can
impose monetary penalties. It can prevent Stan
ford games from appearing on television. It can
suspend Stanford's membership in the NCAA or
