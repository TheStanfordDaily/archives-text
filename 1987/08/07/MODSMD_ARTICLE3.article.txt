# University tries to block drug testing
## News 
### LIZ LEMPERT Staff writer 
Stanford filed a request Wednesday for a court
order exempting the University from enforcing
the NCAA's drug-testing policy while the case
against the tests is being tried.
If the University's request is granted, all Stan
ford athletes will be able to compete without sub
mitting to drug testing.
The University also asked the Santa Clara
County Superior Court to grant a temporary
restraining order prohibiting the NCAA from en
forcing its requirement that the University ob
tain signed drug-testing consent forms from its
athletes.
Jennifer Hill and Barry McKeever, the student
plaintiffs in the suit, also asked for preliminary
injuctions which would allow them to compete in
dividually without signing the forms.
The two athletes and the University made
their requests separately because "it is con
ceiveable one could win and one could lose," ac
cording to Stanford's attorney Debra Zumwalt.
A decision on Stanford's request is scheduled
for Aug. 21.
If the request is not granted, the University
"must either require its students to sign consent
forms, which is probably a violation of their con
stitutional rights, or violate NCAA rules â€” sub
jecting the University, its teams and athletes to
the risk of severe penalties, " Zumwalt said in a
legal memorandum to the court.
In a May 8 letter to Stanford General Counsel
John Schwartz, NCAA attorney George
Gangwere warned that "if Stanford follows your
suggestion [to refuse to comply with the drug
testing rules] it will become subject to discipli
nary or corrective action under established
NCAA procedures for failure to fulfill its obliga
tions of membership."
If Stanford does not obtain consent forms or al
lows athletes to compete who refuse to sign the
forms, the NCAA can penalize the University in
a number of ways, according to Athletic Director
Andy Geiger.
"It can refuse to allow Stanford teams and ath
letes to participate in any championships or post
season games," Geiger said. "It can take away
team and individual championships. It can
impose monetary penalties. It can prevent Stan
ford games from appearing on television. It can
suspend Stanford's membership in the NCAA or
take it away entirely. The po
tential damage to Stanford from
such penalties is incalcuable
and irreparable."
The University's motion is
based on a March ruling in
which Judge Peter Stone
granted diver Simone LeVant a
preliminary injunction allow
ing her to compete without
signing a consent form while
the case was pending.
The granting of that prelimi

nary injuction "indicates that
plaintiffs will probably prevail
in their challenge to the con
stitutionality of the program,"
Zumwalt said.
The preliminary injunction
was dissolved by agreement in
May because LeVant, a
graduating senior, was no
longer eligible for intercol
legiate sports. Hill, co-captain
of the women's soccer team, en
tered the suit in February, and
McKeever, a linebacker on the
football team, joined the suit as
an additional plaintiff two
weeks ago.

LeVant argued that the drug
testing program was degrading
and invaded her right to
privacy under the California
Consititution.
In granting the preliminary
injuction, Judge Stone found
that the NCAA's program
"appears to be scientifically un
sophisticated and overbroad"
and that there "is very little
reasonable relationship be
tween the urinalysis tests and
the performance or the general
health of an athlete, given the
broad application of 3,000
banned substances to all 28
sports regulated by the NCAA."
The court also found that the
"NCAA does not meet any of
the procedural tests for justify

ing an infringement of privacy."
In Seattle, students at the
University of Washington won
a suit against their college's
drug-testing program by sum
mary judgement on July 24.
Athletes there were suing the
university to invalidate both
the university's own program
and its enforcement of the
NCAA program, according to
Iris Brest, staff counsel in Stan
ford's legal office.
The Seattle court ruled that
the NCAA drug-testing pro
gram violated the right to
privacy under the United States
and Washington Constitutions.
The Court enjoined the univer
sity from enforcing the program
and temporarily enjoined the

NCAA from taking any action
against the University of Wash
ington and its athletes for
failing to obtain and sign con
sent forms.
"This year, we plan to delay
asking students to sign the con
sent form until after the
hearing on this application for a
temporary restraining order,
but we cannot delay too long/'
Geiger said in the Aug. 4 decla
ration to the court.
"Under the NCAA rules,
Stanford must declare an ath
lete ineligible and not allow any
student to participate in any
competition if he or she has not
signed the consent form," he
continued.
The first NCAA intercol
legiate competition in which
Stanford will compete is a
women's field hockey preseason
tournament on Aug. 31, fol
lowed by a women's soccer game
and a women's volleyball game
on Sept. 3 and a football game
on Sept. 5.
