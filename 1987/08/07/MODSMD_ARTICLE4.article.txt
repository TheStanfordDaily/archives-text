# Review board makes fence specifications
## 
### A.J. THOMAS Editorial staff 
The Palo Alto Architectural
Review Board yesterday gave
conditional approval to a pro
posal by the University to fence
off a parcel of Stanford-owned
land containing toxic ground
water pollution.
In a June 18 proposal, the
University requested permis
sion to install a 6-foot chain
link fence around the site of the
former Mayfleld School on El
Camino Real, where inspectors
from the California Regional
Water Quality Control Board
detected contaminated ground
water earlier this year.
The ARB stipulated yester
day that the fence be covered
with a green or black vinyl
glavanized coating to darken it,
that it be set back 16 to 20 feet
from El Camino and that the

area between the fence and the
road be landscaped, according
to Paula Kakimoto, property
manager for the University De
partment of Lands Manage
ment.
ARB chair Linn Winter
botham said the conditions
were included "for aesthetic
reasons."
The ARB reviews the "design
value" of new and remodeled
buildings in Palo Alto, includ
ing all fences and apartment
buildings, Winterbotham said.
According to Kakimoto, the
source of the contamination is
not known. She said it might be
the result of toxic waste dump
ing, although she did not know
who might be responsible for
the dumping.
Kakimoto said the fence is in
tended "to prevent any further
dumping and to limit people's
exposure to the site" in case the
pollution poses a health risk.
The next step for the Univer
sity will be to "investigate the
costs to determine if they are
prohibitive" and to talk to the
ARB about what measures will
be acceptable, Kakimoto said.
"We will go ahead and comply

if the costs are not prohibitive,"
she said.
The University plans to
remove the fence as soon as the
pollution is cleaned up,
Kakimoto said.
"It has been a long process for
what we view as a temporary
measure," she added.
In June the University pro
posed putting up a chain-link
fence and screening it from
view with drought-resistant
shrubbery. At that time, the

ARB told the University to con
struct an iron fence and install
an irrigation system to water
the plantings, which Kakimoto
said was too costly.
Kakimoto said the vinyl
coated fence will cost more than
a plain chain-link fence but con
siderably less than an iron one.
The only remaining sticking
point is the landscaping, she
said.
The University's landscaping
plans will be subject to ARB ap

proval, Winterbotham said. He
said the matter will be put on
ARB's consent calendar, which
"will considerably expedite the
process."
The consent calendar is a list
of "minor items" which the
board usually votes on without
discussion, he said.
Kakimoto said the require
ment to set the fence back from
the street will probably force
the University to landscape the
entire area between the fence

and El Camino, which will add
considerably to the overall cost.
"They probably won't be
satisfied with screening," she
said.
When asked if the set-back
stipulation could prevent the
University from enclosing the
entire site, Kakimoto said there
will be no problem "as long as
we can keep within the fence
the wells (where the contamina
tion was detected) that are al
ready there."
