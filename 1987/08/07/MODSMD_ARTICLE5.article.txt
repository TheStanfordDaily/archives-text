# Vigil remembers Hiroshima
## 
### TARRANT MAHONY Staff writer 
About 250 people gathered
in the shadow of Hoover
Tower Wednesday night as
floating lanterns were lit to
commemorate the 42nd anni
versary of the atomic bombing
of Hiroshima.
Representatives of about 50
religous groups from 20
countries lit red, yellow, blue
and white lanterns, which
were made in Hiroshima, and
floated them out on the dark
water of the fountain between
Memorial Auditorium and
Hoover Tower.
The commemoration was
planned to take place at the
same time as the observance
in Hiroshima, according to
event coordinator Loretta
Williams. Services in Japan
are held at 8:15 a.m. on Au
gust 6, the exact time of the

world's first atomic bombing,
she said.
The event closed the week
long 26th triennial conference
of the International Associa
tion for Religious Freedom, an
interfaith organization.
"We come from so many dif
ferent countries and faiths,
and we've been talking about
peace, an abstraction," Wil
liams said. "We wanted to vis
ually remind ourselves that
we are one with the human
race.
"The past folly of Hiroshima
and Nagasaki is part of us too,
and we want not to repeat it,"
she added.
Williams, who is also the di
rector of the department of so
cial justice for the Unitarian
Universalist Association, and
the Rev. Yukiyasu Yama
moto, a Shinto priest living in
Stockton, led the kimono-,
sari- and T-shirt-clad group

Memorial Auditorium to the
fountain singing, "Go now in
peace. .
Yamamoto read a prayer in
Japanese before the lanterns
were lit. Once lit the laterns
projected flickering shadows
on the side of the Hoover
Tower.
"We light these lanterns to
honor those who died and to
give hope to all those now
alive, for now and all time to
come," Williams said to the
group, which surrounded the
fountain.
"May the lamp of peace be
with us as we leave this
place," Williams said to con
clude the ceremony. Scattered
"amens" were heard from the
crowd.
The candle-lighting is part
of the traditional Japanese
ceremony for the dead, accord
ing to Yamamoto. That cere
mony, the Obon Festival, takes
place in August as well, he said.
"It is a way of remembering
those who have lost their lives,"
Yamamoto said. "The light

consoles the dead."
During the last lARF confer
ence in Tokyo in 1984, members
traveled to Hiroshima to take
part in the memorial cer
emonies there.
One of the scheduled
speakers at the lARF confer
ence here was a woman whose
relatives were "hibakusha,"
those who directly experienced
the bomb, Yamamoto said.

About 300 of the more than
800 people who attended this
year's conference were Jap
anese, according to press repre
sentative Janine Denegall.
The conference's "findings
and declarations," released yes
terday, state that, "We affirm
that all religious traditions ex
press universal human experi
ences and aspirations,"
Denegall said.

"We urge all to work with
those in technology to reform
priorities on human values and
to take a more holistic approach
to technological development,"
she said.
"We reaffirm the require
ment laid upon us by our reli
gious committment to work for
peace, mutual understanding,
human rights and the allevia
tion of suffering," she said.
