Ortega says he will talk with U.S.
GUATEMALA CITY — Nicaraguan President Daniel
Ortega said yesterday he was prepared to open talks with the
Reagan administration "immediately" on a new U.S. peace
plan for Central America but ruled out making internal dem
ocratic reforms as part of the negotiating process.
"We are already practicing democracy," Ortega told a news
conference here. Demands for internal democratization
"cannot be an object of negotiations between states," he said.
In Washington, Secretary of State George Shultz spurned
Ortega's call for bilateral talks, saying any peace settlement
in Central America must involve all of the countries in the
region.
Ortega's rejection of U.S. demands for internal changes and
Shultz's renunciation of direct U.S.-Nicaraguan talks under
scored the serious obstacles facing the peace proposal that
President Reagan announced Wednesday.
The U.S. initiative was unveiled just before the presidents
of Nicaragua, El Salvador, Guatemala, Costa Rica and Hon
duras opened a two-day Central American meeting to discuss
a peace plan proposed by Costa Rican President Oscar Arias
Sanchez in February.
College costs outstrip inflation again
WASHINGTON — The cost of a college education is con
tinuing to climb far more rapidly than inflation, according to
a new College Board survey. At some of the nation's most
prestigious private colleges and universities, the survey indi
cates, the total four-year cost of a bachelor's degree has
reached $75,000.
"It's sobering when you look at these figures," said Kath
leen Brouder, director of information for the College Scholar
ship Service, the financial aid division of the College Board.
Even with financial aid, Brouder said, "it's going to require
quite a bit of effort for most families to send their children" to
private colleges.
Despite relatively large tuition increases, averaging 8 per
cent for the coming academic year, private four-year institu
tions generally say they have had a strong year in student ap
plications and acceptances.
"If you are at a certain perceived level of quality, then you
can charge higher tuition and get the students you want,"
said Mary McKeown, associate director of the finance divi
sion of the Maryland State Board of Higher Education.
"Maybe if your tuition is at a certain level, you are perceived
to be of high quality."
Iran continues maneuvers in Gulf
DUBAI, United Arab Emirates — Iran stepped up its psy
chological war against the United States yesterday, extend
ing naval maneuvers in the Persian Gulf for an additional
day as a convoy of American ships made preparations to
steam into the gulf.
Word of the one-day extension of the maneuvers, which
started on Tuesday under the code-name "Martyrdom," was
broadcast by Tehran Radio.
In the first detailed Iranian account of the exercises, the
broadcast said Revolutionary Guard units were rehearsing
attacks on shipping, using vessels equipped with cannon "as
well as remote-controlled vessels packed with explosives and
pilotless planes."
The broadcast appeared to be a thinly veiled warning to the
United States, which Iran has threatened to retaliate against
because of the last week's violence in Mecca. Iran has accused
Saudi Arabian authorities of massacring Iranian pilgrims in
Mecca at the behest of the United States.
Israel breaks off talks with Walsh
WASHINGTON — Negotiations between the govern
ment of Israel and independent counsel Lawrence Walsh
have broken down, and a federal judge will now decide
whether Israeli citizens will be required to answer questions
about their roles in the Iran-contra affair, according to
sources familiar with the discussions.
The failure to reach an out-of-court solution largely
stemmed from a disagreement between Israel and Walsh over
whether his investigators would be allowed to directly ques
tion Israeli citizens — including David Kimche, former direc
tor general of the Israeli foreign ministry and Adolph
Schwimmer, an Israeli arms dealer — according to the
sources.
Walsh is seeking to question Kimche, Schwimmer and at
least two other Israelis — Amiram Nir, an Israeli govern
ment counterterrorism adviser and Yaacov Nimrodi, another
Israeli arms dealer — concerning their roles in the secret sale
of U.S. arms to Iran.
In late May, after members of Walsh's staff made an un
successful trip to Israel, a federal grand jury investigating
the Iran-contra affair subpoenaed Kimche. Schwimmer, who
holds dual Israeli-U.S. citizenship, was subpoenaed in June.
The Israeli government angrily protested the subponeas
and went into court to block Walsh's efforts.
