Democracy expanding world
wide, Hoover scholar says
Citing recent political reforms in
South Korea and the fall of auth
oritarian regimes in Haiti and the
Philippines, Seymour Lipset, a senior
fellow at the Hoover Institution, told a
recent meeting of the Commonwealth
Club of California that democracy is
growing throughout the world.

"I believe moderately that democracy
can be expected to expand beyond its
present boundaries given the current
trends," Lipset said in the July 24
speech.
Lipset defined democracy as the abil
ity of citizens to choose their government
through freely contested elections in a
atmosphere where freedom of speech and
the press prevail.
Lipset also discussed the trend toward
greater individual freedom in commu
nist bloc countries.
"Does this mean we can anticipate
democracy or anything approaching a
free society in the Soviet Union or
China?" Lipset asked. "I doubt it. But
they know that greater economic
freedom, a more market-oriented eco
nomy, is necessary to improve the situa
tion.
"Soviet intellectuals I have spoken to
refer repeatedly to economic and social
difficulties. When asked what could be
done to change the situation, the answer
has one word: democratization," he
added.
Lipset said the movement toward
democracy is propelled by a restless and
politically aware middle class.

"Increasingly the middle classes want
free societies. But the masses also want
them. However, the economically
developed democratic countries remain
confused as to how to help," he said.
