The Office of Residential Education's decision to eliminate
the Orientation Week faculty debates should be reconsidered
because it threatens the variety and intellectual quality of
Freshman Orientation.
Orientation 1986 featured three debates between profes
sors on Third World poverty, ethics in science and the influ
ence of Christianity in Western culture. The debates were
successful by any measure — they were well-attended, con
troversial and succeeded in getting freshmen to think and
talk (and argue) on their second day here.
Equally important, the debates were the one aspect of Ori
entation that treated the freshmen like college students
rather than children. Complex ideas were argued on both
sides, and students were left to sort through them in their
own minds.
This fall, the debates will be replaced by one watered-down
forum on a very safe topic: "Why Are You Here? Debate on
the Purpose of a College Education." According to Alice Sup
ton, assistant dean of Residential Education, the change was
made because several resident fellows felt orientation should
address the various ways of approaching a college education.
Although the University does not adequately address this
issue — for the benefit of freshmen or anyone else — it is not
a topic that lends itself to debate. It is hard to imagine people
having strong disagreements about how to go to college.
(Would one side advocate spending every night in the library
and the other support taking only easy classes and then skip
ping them?)
A debate on the purpose of education is likely to come
across less as an exchange of opposing views than as a con
trived exercise designed to impart Res Ed's own how-to
college message.
Last year's debates presented arguments on both sides of
controversial issues over which reasonable people disagree.
They highlighted an aspect of Stanford that orientation
otherwise completely ignores, and they gave freshmen a
chance to see professors in a medium outside of classroom in
struction.
Res Ed has said it might invite speakers from outside the
University for the education debate. That's unfortunate, as
Orientation is a perfect opportunity to expose freshmen to
what Stanford has to offer.
Surely there is time to do both — to discuss the task of get
ting an education and hold interesting and provocative
debates.
It's not too late for Res Ed to rethink its decision, especially
considering that no one has agreed to participate in the edu
cation debate.
Orientation Week should orient new students to all aspects
of life at Stanford. For too many freshmen, Orientation
means nothing but a week of games and a few tests.
To succeed, Orientation should reach out to all types of
freshmen, and it should awaken them to Stanford's intellec
tual possibilities — at the same time that it showcases all the
opportunities for frolicking in the sun.
