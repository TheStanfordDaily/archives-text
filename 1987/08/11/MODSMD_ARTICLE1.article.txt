# Tuition outpaces inflation
## 
### DEBBIE RUBENSTEIN 
The rising costs of college ed
ucation are outstripping the na
tional rate of inflation, but
Stanford's 6 percent tuition in
crease for the 1987-88 academic
year is comparable to other uni
versities.
Tim Warner, associate
provost at the Office of Manage
ment and Budget, said costs are
rising faster than inflation be
cause 70 percent of the Univer
sity's budget is salary driven
and the general growth rate of
salaries is faster than increases
in the Consumer Price Index.
Warner also said that the
University must maintain high
education standards and is in
vesting in new programmatic
development, such as in the
computer sciences. As a result,
the University is in need of new
money.
According to Warner, tuition
comprises 50 percent of the Uni
versity's budget.
The overall rise in Stanford's
costs is comparable to those at
similar institutions, Warner
said.
Students here will pay
$16,835 for tuition, room and
board next year. At Harvard
University, for example, total
expenses will reach an esti
mated $18,800 next year.
In tuition alone, Stanford is
one of the 10 most expensive
universities of comparable in
stitutions, according to Warner.
Including room and board,
Stanford ranks third or fourth,
he said.
At other Bay Area univer
sities tuition increases occured
but tended to be less substan
tial. UC-Berkeley costs rose
only 1.5 percent for state resi
dents, who will now pay $4,620
for tuition plus room and board.
Out-of-state resident costs rose
4.9 percent.
Santa Clara University tui
tion is $12,237, an increase of
9.6 percent. At San Jose State
