# Tuition outpaces inflation
## 
### DEBBIE RUBENSTEIN 
The rising costs of college ed
ucation are outstripping the na
tional rate of inflation, but
Stanford's 6 percent tuition in
crease for the 1987-88 academic
year is comparable to other uni
versities.
Tim Warner, associate
provost at the Office of Manage
ment and Budget, said costs are
rising faster than inflation be
cause 70 percent of the Univer
sity's budget is salary driven
and the general growth rate of
salaries is faster than increases
in the Consumer Price Index.
Warner also said that the
University must maintain high
education standards and is in
vesting in new programmatic
development, such as in the
computer sciences. As a result,
the University is in need of new
money.
According to Warner, tuition
comprises 50 percent of the Uni
versity's budget.
The overall rise in Stanford's
costs is comparable to those at
similar institutions, Warner
said.
Students here will pay
$16,835 for tuition, room and
board next year. At Harvard
University, for example, total
expenses will reach an esti
mated $18,800 next year.
In tuition alone, Stanford is
one of the 10 most expensive
universities of comparable in
stitutions, according to Warner.
Including room and board,
Stanford ranks third or fourth,
he said.
At other Bay Area univer
sities tuition increases occured
but tended to be less substan
tial. UC-Berkeley costs rose
only 1.5 percent for state resi
dents, who will now pay $4,620
for tuition plus room and board.
Out-of-state resident costs rose
4.9 percent.
Santa Clara University tui
tion is $12,237, an increase of
9.6 percent. At San Jose State
University, in-state residents
will get a cost increase of 7 per
cent, while out-of-state resi
dents will pay an additional 4
percent.
"The issue is that tuition over
the long run doesn't grow faster
than the ability of families to
pay," Warner said.
Stanford will continue to
"meet the full demonstrated fi
nancial need" of the student as
a matter of policy, Warner said.
About 65 percent of the student
body is currently on some type

of financial aid.
Associate Director of Finan
cial Aids Roberta Johnson said
the increase does not affect
Stanford's "need blind" aid com
mitment now or in the future. -
Johnson said last year the
government raised the loan bor
rowing limit for the first time in
20 years, which will be helpful
to students for combatting the
rising tuition costs.
Under the Reauthorization of
the Higher Education Act,
passed last October, graduate
students will now be able to bor
row $7,500 annually, up from
$5,000. The loan ceiling for
juniors and seniors will go from
$2,500 to $4,000, while fresh

men and sophmores can now
borrow $2,625, up from $2,500.
Warner said the University
has also made budget reduc
tions and increased productiv
ity to prevent any unnecessary
increases. However, the Uni
versity can't cut any existing
programs, he added.
Centennial fund-raising ef
forts are expected to help
relieve some of the budget pres
sures, although it can't be di
rectly quantified into tuition
costs, Johnson said.
"The Centennial campaign is
aimed at strengthening the
general financial aid endow
ment on a need blind basis,"
Johnson said.
