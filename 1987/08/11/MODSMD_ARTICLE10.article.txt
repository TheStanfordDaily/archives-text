# Stanford scientists not refusing funds
## 
### LIZ LEMPERT Staff writer 
About 12,000 scientists
worldwide, including 7,000
in the United States, have
pledged to refuse research
funds linked to the Reagan
administration's Strategic
Defense Initiative, according
to organizers of the cam
paign.
More than 10 Stanford sci
entists, however, said yester
day they are not involved
with the movement and don't
know anyone here who is.
SDI research is aimed at
developing lasers and other
high-tech weapons that could
be installed on the ground or
in space to automatically
shoot down missiles fired at
the United States.
The nature of Star Wars
research done here is difficult
to pinpoint. SDI is a
relatively new proposal and
never established its own
funding agency, according to
Applied Physics Prof. Robert
Byer.
"SDI funds wouldn't neces
sarily show up as SDI funds,"
Byer said, because the money
is channeled through the

basic research arms of the
Army, Navy and Air Force.
"The faculty elects what
research they want to do, and
that is critical. Proposals are
sent outwards from Stan
ford," Byer explained.
"The good news about the
U.S.A. is that there are a
multitude of agencies," he
said. Professors can write
and submit proposals to
NASA and the National Sci
ence Federation as well as
the Department of Defense.
They also rely on private
gifts, he said.
Last month a bill to cut
funding to universities refus
ing to do research on SDI was
introduced in Congress. The
Stanford Linear Accelerator
Center stood in risk of losing
$160,274,000 in federal fund
ing, according to figures pub
lished in the Campus Report.
However, the bill was killed.
SLAC conducts research on
high energy particle physics
and receives all of its federal
funding from the Depart
ment of Energy, according to
Dr. Wofgang Panofsky, direc
tor emeritus of SLAC's re
search division.
