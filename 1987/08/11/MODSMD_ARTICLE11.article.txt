## The 						Stanford Daily An Independent Newspaper Suspend the Zetes 
### 
This week, acting Dean of Student Affairs Norm Robinson
plans to make a decision on whether to suspend the Zeta Psi
fraternity. This review of the fraternity's status was
prompted in part by evidence unearthed by the investi
gation of junior David Dunshee's drowning after a Zete party
last spring. Suspension of the fraternity is not a perfect solu
tion, but it is the best of the choices available.
Investigations indicated that alcohol intoxication had con
tributed to Dunshee's death. Officials also found that the
Zetes at that rush party had not been checking for rush iden
tification cards, had failed to appoint a sober rush monitor,
were serving alcohol after 11:30 p.m. and were drinking
straight shots of hard liquor. These conditions were in direct
violation of rules set by the Inter-Fraternity Council.
In light of this Zete disregard for alcohol policy, the Uni
versity has considered suspending recognition of the frater
nity, which would effectively disband it. The Zetes already
lost their housing after an incident in which members threw
a Mills College woman into a concrete pond prompted a
similar review in 1981.
There are some considerations in the Zetes' favor. Most im
portantly, the Zetes probably took the death of David Dun
shee more to heart than most of us. Might that have been
enough of a lesson?
Also, the Zetes were very likely not the only fraternity
breaking the rules. An unfortunate mishap is bound to hap
pen when several groups have functions which combine the
pressure of peer acceptance and consumption of large
amounts of alcohol. The odds just happened to catch up with
the Zetes.
Suspension is necessary, however, because the Zetes broke
guidelines that provided some degree of alcohol responsibil
ity, and this neglect contributed to the worst possible conse
quence — the death of a student — something which cannot
go ignored.
The rules were laid down to avoid just this sort of situation.
The suspension, more than insuring that the Zetes have
learned their lesson, is also an indication to other fraternities
of the seriousness with which the University regards alcohol
safety.
Potentially, however, officials are caught in a bind.
Suspension has been instituted against other fraternities
before, with less than ideal results. The University revoked
recognition of the Delta Upsilon fraternity in May 1986, and
such action has only taken them further out of University
control.
On the other hand, when these fraternities are under the
auspices of University and IFC guidelines, some frequently
break the rules anyway. Clearly, suspension is not a magical
remedy, but fraternities do not treat it lightly.
It's about time that fraternities take serious responsibility
for the alcohol they serve and the according guidelines to
which they have agreed. Suspension of the Zete fraternity is
necessary to show that the University is equally serious
about enforcing the rules.
