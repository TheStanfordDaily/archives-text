Columnist was
not well-informed
Gary Rosen's July 31 column
is based on a litany of er
roneous statements and misin
formation that need some
serious rethinking.
I take issue with his asser
tions that the Sandinistas sup
port insurgency groups in the
region and terrorism abroad.
This position reflects the well
known Reagan rhetoric that
Nicaragua exports revolution.
There exists no empirical
evidence to support this claim.
Rosen advocates military
support for the most notorious
organization of terrorists in the
region. The mining of civilian
roads and the kidnapping and
murdering of people is not sim
ply the "shortcomings and
abuses of an ill-trained peasant
army."
And he has the audacity to
suggest that condemnation of
their wholesale terrorizing
would be "self-righteous!" A
more accurate categorization
would be "well-informed."
To blame Nicaragua's eco
nomic problems on "centralized
economic planning" ignores the
fact that Nicaragua has a
mixed economy with over 60
percent of its productive forces

privately owned, operating
according to market incentives.
And how about blaming the
economic devastation incurred
by the contra war, now totaling
over $2 billion in war-related
damages? What about the
Reagan administration block
ing over $400 million in inter
national development loans
and the total U.S. trade em
bargo?
By neglecting these two fac
tors as contributors to the eco
nomic deterioration in
Nicaragua, Rosen forces me to
question his ability to fully
conceptualize the issues.

Contras regularly
violate medical
neutrality laws
As coordinator of a local
medical aid project for Central
America, I take issue with col
umnist Gary Rosen's July 31
statements that the
Nicaraguan contras deserve
our support.
I refuse to support any group
of people that deliberately and
consistently violates medical
neutrality provisions of the
Geneva Conventions. The con

tras carry out deliberate and
continual attacks on health
care personnel and facilities
within Nicaragua. Such at
tacks are not accidents or
mistakes made by an "ill
trained peasant army" but
rather are a direct result of
U.S. training and policy.
Dozens of volunteer health
workers have been killed by
the contras in the region sur
rounding El Cua in the past
four years. This does not in
clude the deaths of over 100
health care professionals and
the destruction of 42 health
care facilities as of 1986.
I am constantly asked to
solicit support to help rebuild
clinics and health posts that
have been damaged as a result
of contra attacks.
The U.S. has no business
supporting the contras or any
other force whose repeated
violations of medical neutrality
are part of everyday opera
tions.
Yes, Mr. Rosen, we should
rethink our policy in Nicara
gua â€” but our thought process
should be one of justice and
peace rather than ruthless
destruction.
