# A 						touch of hedonism, is long overdue at Stanford

Tantalus cut up his son in defiance of
Zeus, challenging the deity to put the child
back together. Zeus, enraged by the hubris
of Tantalus, sentenced him to eternal
torture in Hades — up to his chin in water
and never a drop to drink, luxuriant fruit
dangling above him and never a bite to eat.
Hence the word "tantalize": tempting
desire to the point of madness, but doomed
to be forever refused.

Stanford is a bountiful place, a veritable
cornucopia of delights to appease every con
ceivable desire (excepting Food Service per
haps). The physical environs are wonderful.
We can play tennis in January, hit the
beach on a half-hour's notice and just lie on
a sundeck most any time of the year.
The social environment, though not as
lively and mixed as it could be, neverthe
less offers a number of things to do on any
given night. The dating scene has always
been a target of abuse — but come on, ad
mit that there are more possibilities here to
meet amazing, attractive, intelligent
people than just about anywhere else.
In his first speech to my class, University
President Donald Kennedy enumerated all

these Stanford offerings, and then attacked
a traditional dichotomy. He ridiculed the
notion that Stanfordian intellectualism
was somehow "addled by the sun." Kennedy
felt defensive, and for good reason.
"Addled by the sun" is a useful metaphor
to describe the satiation of any appetite and
the resulting intoxication that impairs in
tellectual sharpness. Through the ages
philosophers have recognized a basic re
quirement for the scholar to avoid this
muddy, confused state: asceticism. Plato
and Aristotle both leaned in this direction,
and the Stoics pressed the most extreme
view of the benefits of repression. Ken
nedy's hypothesis, then, is a radical one.
Stanford wants to have its cake and eat it
too (or not eat it, as the case may be).
Are the two compatible? Are they even
actually mutually beneficial? This is a fun
damental question for Stanford because
we've staked our reputation on the Ivy-
League-Fun-In-The-Sun billing.
Summer quarter should be the perfect
time to test the theory. In fact, intellectual
productivity should increase due to the cor
responding summer increase in the
"relaxation" coefficient.
How productive are you right now?
If you at all resemble the little band of
frenetic lunatics who slave to put this paper
in your hands, you're pretty productive. If
you're leading a "normal" campus lifestyle,
you're probably enjoying Kennedy's famous
mix: the Harvard of the West, the Dis
neyland of the North, etc. Or are you?

Being a student demands an awful lot of
delayed gratification. It demands the
mortgaging of desire for some future payoff.
Grad schools are a grind, but undergradu
ate life is no picnic either, to judge from the
choices often made by Stanford students al
locating their time.
An invitation from a relative stranger to
shoot the breeze at the Coffee House
sometime? Sorry, have to finish a problem
set. Phone numbers exchanged. Follow-up
calls never made. San Francisco? Forget it.
I'll eat my hat if you're a student and you
get to the City more than once or twice a
quarter.
Stanford's bursts of hedonism are gener
ally explosive releases letting out a lot of
frustrated energy in short bursts, only to
return ever-so-quickly to the grind. Just
look at the Sunday Flicks. Thafs how we're
supposed to wind down a weekend?
We run ourselves into the ground and
then wonder where all the time went. It's a
sick, sick way of looking at the world.
I wish I could say we were all addled by
the sun here, but I'm afraid that's not true.
We're too busy, too single-minded, too
obsessed even to notice that the sun's out
there. And I don't mean simply the sun; I
mean all of those tantalizing possibilities.
Tantalus could teach us a few things. His
desires were put on hold forever. He would
say, "Don't wait, Stanford." I agree. Enjoy
your summer. Damn it — When if not now?
