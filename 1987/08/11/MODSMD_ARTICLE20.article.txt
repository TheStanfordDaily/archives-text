## Work program helps those with disabilities 
### EMMA STERLAND Staff writer 
Until last year, an average day for Don Quacken
bush would be spent alone in his room, usually in his
underwear, watching television.
Now he is doing contract work for local industry and,
after years of solitude, he is making new friends and
improving his rusty social skills.
Quackenbush, 44, is mentally retarded. He has
recently joined the Work Activity Program, which is
run by the Community Association for Retarded in
Palo Alto.
The program teaches mentally disabled adults voca
tional and social skills with the aim of increasing their
independence. It is one of several programs organized
by CAR — others include classes for developmentally
delayed children, a group home for the disabled and a
swim center for anyone with a disabling condition,
whether they are blind, paralyzed or trauma victims.
Several CAR staff members are Stanford graduates
who began working with the organization as volun
teers. Many students become involved through a Psy
chology Department class titled, "Experience-based
Study on the Meaning of Being Handicapped."
The class, which will be in its 13th year this fall, is
taught by Betty Wright, founder and original director
of the swim center. She says volunteers are crucial to
CAR. "We can't run the place without them," she said.
A former Stanford volunteer, Mark Dammann, is
now the production manager for the Work Activity Pro
gram. Dammann took Wright's class in 1983 and joined
CAR after graduating two years later.
His job involves supervising about 40 clients of
varying abilities in the program's workshop. Clients
start off with "work samples," which might be sorting
colored bricks into different containers or folding
leaflets. They then get a chance to perform paid jobs.
The work varies, but usually it involves stuffing envel
opes, packaging, sorting and assembling.
Dammann said the clients get a great deal out of the

program. As we}l as learning vocational skills, they
gain self-esteem through their achievements. Dam
mann used Quackenbush as an example of the kind of
progress clients can make.
Quackenbush attended a special workshop until
1978. Then there was a lull in the workload and his
mother decided to let him stay at home.

"At any college you run into a
relatively homogeneous group of
people. You don't tend to see old,
poor or disabled people. When
college students come to CAR,
they're reminded that there is a
world out there full of different
people
- Mark Dammann, Class of '85

From that time on Quackenbush spent his days
watching television, according to Marg, his sister-in
law. He forgot most of what he had learned at work, she
said.
"He used to be able to take a bus across town on his
own," she said. "Now we're working toward a reclama
tion of those skills."
Quackenbush joined the Work Activity Program last
September and is regaining some of his independence.
The program mainly teaches job-related skills, but
clients are also given social training in preparation for
work in the community. Quackenbush is taking classes
in street safety and language development.

His sister-in-law is delighted with the program. "It's
bringing Don back into the world," she said. "This
whole change in his life has been wonderful."
For Dammann, part of the appeal of working at CAR
is watching people like Quackenbush make progress.
"The workshop is a great place to work. It can be a real
challenge and the atmosphere is wonderful," Dam
mann said.
The staff is careful to create a disciplined working
environment, but the atmosphere is relaxed and
friendly. Clients are rewarded for hard work with ap
plause, "worker-of-the-month" awards and, of course,
paychecks.
Several such awards have gone to Marilu Harmon,
40, who has been in the program since 1983. The CAR
staff is hoping to get Harmon into a "supportive work
situation" some time this year, Dammann said. That
would mean an actual job in private industry, with on
going training and supervision from CAR.
Dammann described Harmon as "very conscien
tious." He added: "If we need a job done precisely we
give it to Marilu, because as soon as she's learned it
she'll do it right every time."
Like Quackenbush, Harmon's social skills have im
proved since she has been in the program. She spent 30
years in a state mental hospital and, according to Dam
mann, that made her very routine-oriented. "She never
used to like changing jobs to begin with and she was
afraid to leave the building by herself," he said.
Now Harmon has a lunchtime job cleaning the
kitchen in another CAR building. "She walks there
everyday by herself," Dammann said.
For Quackenbush and Harmon, CAR is offering a
stimulating environment where they can feel chal
lenged and capable.
For Dammann, CAR is an equally stimulating exper
ience, one he recommends to students. "At any college
you run into a relatively homogeneous group of
people," he said. "You don't tend to see old, poor or dis
abled people. When college students come to CAR,
they're reminded that there is a world out there full of
different people."

gram. Dammann took Wright's class in 1983 and joined
CAR after graduating two years later.
His job involves supervising about 40 clients of
varying abilities in the program's workshop. Clients
start off with "work samples," which might be sorting
colored bricks into different containers or folding
leaflets. They then get a chance to perform paid jobs.
The work varies, but usually it involves stuffing envel
opes, packaging, sorting and assembling.
Dammann said the clients get a great deal out of the

program. As we}l as learning vocational skills, they
gain self-esteem through their achievements. Dam
mann used Quackenbush as an example of the kind of
progress clients can make.
Quackenbush attended a special workshop until
1978. Then there was a lull in the workload and his
mother decided to let him stay at home.

"At any college you run into a
relatively homogeneous group of
people. You don't tend to see old,
poor or disabled people. When
college students come to CAR,
they're reminded that there is a
world out there full of different
people
- Mark Dammann, Class of '85

From that time on Quackenbush spent his days
watching television, according to Marg, his sister-in
law. He forgot most of what he had learned at work, she
said.
"He used to be able to take a bus across town on his
own," she said. "Now we're working toward a reclama
tion of those skills."
Quackenbush joined the Work Activity Program last
September and is regaining some of his independence.
The program mainly teaches job-related skills, but
clients are also given social training in preparation for
work in the community. Quackenbush is taking classes
in street safety and language development.

His sister-in-law is delighted with the program. "It's
bringing Don back into the world," she said. "This
whole change in his life has been wonderful."
For Dammann, part of the appeal of working at CAR
is watching people like Quackenbush make progress.
"The workshop is a great place to work. It can be a real
challenge and the atmosphere is wonderful," Dam
mann said.
The staff is careful to create a disciplined working
environment, but the atmosphere is relaxed and
friendly. Clients are rewarded for hard work with ap
plause, "worker-of-the-month" awards and, of course,
paychecks.
Several such awards have gone to Marilu Harmon,
40, who has been in the program since 1983. The CAR
staff is hoping to get Harmon into a "supportive work
situation" some time this year, Dammann said. That
would mean an actual job in private industry, with on
going training and supervision from CAR.
Dammann described Harmon as "very conscien
tious." He added: "If we need a job done precisely we
give it to Marilu, because as soon as she's learned it
she'll do it right every time."
Like Quackenbush, Harmon's social skills have im
proved since she has been in the program. She spent 30
years in a state mental hospital and, according to Dam
mann, that made her very routine-oriented. "She never
used to like changing jobs to begin with and she was
afraid to leave the building by herself," he said.
Now Harmon has a lunchtime job cleaning the
kitchen in another CAR building. "She walks there
everyday by herself," Dammann said.
For Quackenbush and Harmon, CAR is offering a
stimulating environment where they can feel chal
lenged and capable.
For Dammann, CAR is an equally stimulating exper
ience, one he recommends to students. "At any college
you run into a relatively homogeneous group of
people," he said. "You don't tend to see old, poor or dis
abled people. When college students come to CAR,
they're reminded that there is a world out there full of
different people."
