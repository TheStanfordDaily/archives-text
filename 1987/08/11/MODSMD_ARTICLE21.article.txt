## Berkeley's chancellor criticizes abuses in athletics Athletics and academics: Do they compete? 
### CAROL WATSON 
Ira Michael Heyman, chancellor of
UC-Berkeley, created a stir at the July
NCAA conference in Dallas when he
suggested some radical changes in col
lege athletics, including eliminating
post-season bowl games.
Heading Heyman's list of grievances
was the tension existing between
academics and athletics. There is a prob
lem, he said, when students attend col
lege for the sake of athletic competition
rather than academic learning.
Heyman said some of the abuses sur
rounding this "incompatible combina
tion" are college recruiters bribing
talented high school athletes and admis
sions officers granting entrance to il
literate athletes.
He also criticized those coaches who
place players in community colleges and
direct them to take easy courses in order
to gain eligibility, and those who order
the alteration of transcripts for
eligibility purposes.
Stanford Law Prof. Jack Friedenthal,
faculty athletic representative, and Alan
Cummings, senior associate director of
Athletics, argue that these problems do
not exist here because the University's
athletes are accepted based on their aca
demic abilities.
"Stanford begins by having all of its
athletes admitted through the regular
academic process. Coaches accept aca
demic principles as givens and operate
within them. We don't face the kinds of
issues that we read about so often in ath
letic programs," Cummings said.
Friedenthal acknowledged that ath
letes are required to make certain com
mitments to their sports. However, he
was quick to mention that other stu
dents here are just as busy with other ex
tracurricular activities.
In his address, Heyman also said

"colleges and universities are simply
subsidizing pro football and pro basket
ball at the expense of really educating
others," referring to the high costs of
training players. As a solution, Heyman
suggested creating minor league farm
systems for these sports much like
baseball's farm system.
Through this change one must also,
Heyman said, "sever what has been
called the 'unnatural link' between
academics and athletics. By creating al
ternative paths, we could stop insisting
that all aspiring professional football
and basketball players become college
students."
Friedenthal agreed with Heyman that
the only way to solve the problem of lack
of remuneration is for the colleges to
stop training athletes who are un
interested in school for the sake of learn
ing.
"Where you go to college, or if you go,
should be functions of your basic
capacity, your goals, where you're com
fortable and your personality. A whole
lot of people shouldn't go. However, for
the athlete who has professional poten
tial in football or basketball, unless that
person goes to college, the chances of
making it in the pros are virtully nil,"
Friedenthal said.
In the face of offers from big-name uni
versities, Friedenthal said, most ath
letes are afraid to go to smaller schools
that may be appropriate for their aca
demic needs but aren't large enough to
showcase their athletic talents.
Athletes interested in major league
baseball, however, can enter college or
go directly to the minor leagues after
high school. While playing in the minor
leagues, they may be noticed by a major
team. Because college athletic programs
preceded professional football and bas
ketball, farm systems for these sports
never emerged.

While Friedenthal agrees with
Heyman's suggestion to create farm
teams in other sports, he is realistice
about the reluctance of the professional
leagues to support such a plan. "They're
not going to do it voluntarily because it
costs money," he said.
Heyman proposed abolishing football
bowl games and post-season basketball
tournaments to prevent infringement of
athletics on academic schedules.
Cummings thought a change such as
this could be detrimental because cham
pionship competition is a hallmark of all
sports. "[lt] is an extension of practice
and regular competition, and it ought to
be important in the overall picture of
athletics and academics," he said.
Friedenthal, however, agreed with
Heyman that there was too much em
phasis on being number one in a champi

onship game rather than simply win
ning the regular-season competition. "In
football you're never going to play
enough games to know who's best. We
play games to satisfy a few alumni
groups," he said.
However, Friedenthal said he would
never prevent an athlete from attending
a championship game. He explained that
Stanford accommodates these games by
offering exams before or after the compe
tition. And, if necessary, exams are
given at the site of the competition. For
instance, in June some Stanford baseball
players took finals in Omaha, Neb., on
the mornings before College World Se
ries games.
The Athletics Department is making
an effort to schedule competitions that
don't conflict with academics, according
to Friedenthal. The department "has
become more sensitive over the years to
scheduling," he said, but "We still have
problem with games in Dead Week.
Sometimes (prior) contractual arrange
ments make things difficult," he said.
In matters where the University has
no control, such as when the NCAA
holds championships, Friedenthal said
the Athletics Department is a guiltless
victim. When athletes ask professors to
arrange special test dates in such cases,
Friedenthal said, "That's not a matter of
athletics over academics â€” that's a mat
ter of accomodation."
About Heyman's proposals, Cum
mings said, "I don't think at Stanford we
see reasons why the current program of
athletics and competition ought to be
changed. It doesn't seem to be necessary
to establish some new type of program."
Cummings said he believes that the
ability to handle corruption within ath
letics begins with each institution's prin
ciples regarding its athletics program. "I
don't feel it can be effectively legislated
by external groups," he said.
