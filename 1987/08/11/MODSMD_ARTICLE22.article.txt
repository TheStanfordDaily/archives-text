## Sixth 'Dune' novel finally released in paperback 
### ERIK MCDERMOTT Chapterhouse: Dune By Frank Herbert Ace Science Fiction, 1987. $4. 50 
The paperback edition of the
last of the six "Dune" books has
finally appeared, much to the
delight of "Dune" fans around
the world.
The uninitiated may wonder
what all the excitement is
about. What, they may ask, is
"Dune"?
"Dune" is a universe unto it
self. "Dune" is populated by
characters who push human
abilities to their limits and
beyond. "Dune" is about the
drug "melange," which extends
life, expands consciousness and
can confer powers of prescience.
"Dune" is about titanic
struggles for control of the uni
verse. "Dune" is about the sur
vival of the human race.
The "Dune" series can be
divided into roughly three
parts. The first deals with the
rise and fall of Paul Muad'Dib.
The second is concerned with
the 3,500-year rule of Leto 11,
the God Emperor. The third
part is about the aftermath of
Leto's death.
"Chapterhouse" continues
the story of this aftermath,
begun in "Heretics of Dune."
Very little time elapses be
tween the two books. It is still
about 1,500 years after the God
Emperor's death. In that time
there has been a huge explosion

in the population of the uni
verse.
Once the shackles of Leto's
harsh rule were removed, the
"Scattering" began: Huge num
bers of people left the known
universe and colonized the un
known. This, we gather, is the

essence of Leto's plan, his
Golden Path: "humankind
'erupting' into the universe . . .
never again confined to any
single planet and susceptible to
a singular fate. All of our eggs
no longer in one basket."
But the "old" universe we
become acquainted with in the
first four books has yet to deal
fully with the Golden Path. In
"Chapterhouse," the remnants

of the old universe are forced to
do so when some of the descen
dants of the people who left in
the Scattering return with hos
tile intentions.
But "Chapterhouse" is in a
sense just an episode, whose
outcome will not affect the suc
cess of the Golden Path. Yet the
book can be viewed as the com
pletion of the Golden Path with
respect to the Bene Gesserit.
After reading six of his books,
I am a getting tired of Herbert's
writing style.
I sense a general decrease in
quality since the first book.
Moreover, the dialogue in the
"Dune" books always strives to
achieve the subtlest kind of
communication. At times this
seems a bit ridiculous. There
are constantly allusions to
broader meanings, plans within
plans within plans, hints that
may or may not be deceptive,
tense word play, hand signals.
National Lampoon's "Doon"
provides a good parody of this,
along the lines of: "When the
spice — " "Obviously!" "But
what about — " "Not at all!" "I
see. And then — " "Of course"
and so on.
But on the whole I liked
"Chapterhouse." If you are
"Dune" addict, of course, you
must read this book. In fact,
you've probably already read it.
If you have never read any of
the "Dune" books, I encourage
you to pick up the first one,
"Dune." It's easy reading and a
lot of fun.
