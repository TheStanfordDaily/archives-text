## Bowie plays Spartan Stadium 
### JAMES R. DICKEY Editorial staff 
Giant spider eyes looked out over thousands of
swarming prey as the crowd waited for David
Bowie to begin his performance Friday night at
Spartan Stadium in§an Jose,
In this, the Glass Spider tour, Bowie has mixed
his years of musical experience and performing
expertise honed in the movies "The Man Who
Fell to Earth," "Merry Christmas Mister
Lawrence" and "Labyrinth."
Everything about the show was distinctly
Bowie.
Before the performance began, the set looked
bizarre, unfinished. There were no musical in
struments, drum risers or typical elements of a
concert stage. Instead there were girders and
construction platforms — and over it all was the
body of the spider.
The show began after dark with the entrance of
Bowie's guitarist, wearing what can only be de
scribed as a futuristic costume designed to make
him look half-human, half-machine.
While he played unbelievable riffs on his
guitar, the other band members joined him on
stage by sliding down the legs of the spider, in

struments slung over their shoulders.
Once everyone was in place, Bowie entered
with typical style. As the audience heard him tell
the "Tale of the Glass Spider" through a
microphone shaped like an $ntique phone, he
emerged from the spider's mouth and was
lowered onto the st^age.
Casually, effortlessly, Bowie began the show,
relaxing in his chair as he sang.
As he warmed to the crowd, the real perform
ance began and the theatrics were non-stop.
For backup there was a five-member group of
acrobat/dancer/singer/actors who performed
myriad parts in Bowie's unique musical. For ex
ample, during the "Tale of the Spider," they
hobbled wildly on their hands, playing
abandoned baby spiders. During other songs they
alternately danced with Bowie, performed
acrobatic feats or played parts that coincided
with the lyrics of the songs.
Through all the pageantry and bizzare antics,
the music rolled on. Bowie performed only three
of his oldest hits — "Rebel, Rebel," "Young
Americans" and "Fame" — and three newer
chart-toppers — "Let's Dance," "Modern Love"
and "China Girl." The crowd was swayed by
every chord. New or old, Bowie is great.
