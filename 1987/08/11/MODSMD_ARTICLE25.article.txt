# Bolshoi Ballet delights the City

### CHRISTINA LEPNIS 
The Soviet Union's bastion of
classical perfection, the Bolshoi
Ballet, came to San Francisco
with all the majesty and strik
ing theatrics that the company
has exemplified for over 100
years.
The first half of the Bolshoi's
eight performances at the
Opera House was a collection of
exerpts from the company's
repertory works, most of which
were choreographed by artistic
director Yuri Grigorovich.
The mixed programs began
with Act I of Grigorovich's regal
and direct version of "Romeo
and Juliet" and ended with Act
II of his boldly expressive ver
sion of "Spartacus." A series of
divertissements, including the
waltz from Fokine's "Chopin
iana" and Gorsky's Grand pas

from "Don Quixote," were pre
sented in between.
"Spartacus" is the story of the
Roman gladiator who leads his
fellow slaves in revolt against
the oppressive Crassus and the
Roman army. It is a mighty dis
play of rebellion and conflict
with very masculine and force
ful ensemble sections.
Aleksei Fadeyechev gives the
impassioned Spartacus a com
manding presence, portraying
also the depth and integrity of
the hero's ideals. Indeed, the
ballet produces not just a spec
tacle, but an effective account of
emotional conviction as well.
"Romeo and Juliet" also ex
hibits the Bolshoi dancers' flair
for strong acting and charac
terization. Nina Ananiashvili
and Andris Liepa distinguish
the lead portrayals with poetic
grace and finesse.

Nothing about the choreo
graphy is particularly original
or interesting, but the dancing
is so technically flawless and
unsurpassed in elegance that
the piece succeeds nonetheless.
The drama unfolds with as
little plot embellishment as pos
sible, concentrating heavily on
the eager young lovers, the
opulent pageantry and the
feuding of the families.
Outstanding among the
divertissements is the "Don
Quixote" Grand pas, brimming
with bravado and breathtaking
feats. Lyudmila Semenyaka, a
Bolshoi veteran, and the darkly
intense Irek Mukhamedov are
phenomenal.
The orchestra was led by Bol
shoi conductor Alexandr Kop
ilov and included members of
the San Francisco Symphony
and visiting Soviet musicians.
