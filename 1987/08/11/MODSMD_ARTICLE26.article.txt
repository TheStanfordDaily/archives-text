# Concert fills Frost
## 
### JOHN D. LEE Staff writer 
To say that Frost Amphi
theater was packed Sunday
afternoon would be more
than a slight understate
ment. But it was a great day
for an outdoor concert and
the enormous audience was
treated to quite a show under
the sun and sky.
Proceeds from the three
act jazz concert all went to a
worthy cause: the academic
Stanford jazz program, which
struggles to survive on a
year-to-year basis.
Jimmy Nadel's sextet,
composed entirely of mem
bers of the Stanford Jazz
Workshop faculty, opened
the afternoon's events.
Alto saxophonist Nadel,
who is also the founder of the
Stanford Jazz Workshop and
an integral part of the aca
demic jazz program at Stan
ford, was joined by Gerald
Carelli (trombone), Joe
Oliveira (tenor sax), Jon
Davis (piano), Larry Gren
adier (bass) and Jeff Ballard
(drums). The group put on a
fine opening performance
which included a piece writ
ten by Carelli and the jazz
standard "Stella" by Star
light.
Nadel's group was followed
by the University's artist-in
residence and tenor sax
ophone legend Stan Getz.
Getz, dressed in a joyously
bright pink, orange, lime
green and yellow shirt, really
opened up his heart to the au
dience during the perform
ance. Particularly touching
was Getz's rendition of a bal
lad by Billy Strayhorn. The
piece, titled "Bloodcount,"
was written during the final

days of Strayhorn's stay in a
hospital.
Getz told the audience,
"You can hear what the
man's going through in that
hospital." He did a masterful
job of painting the sad
picture through his instru
ment.
Getz's rhythm section,
made up of Jim McNeely
(piano), Rufus Reid (bass)
and Victor Lewis (drums),
was solid through and
through. Acknowledged as
some of the best in the busi
ness, McNeely, Reid and
Lewis proved themselves to
be true professionals.
The Manhattan Transfer's
eagerly anticipated appear
ance began as they drove up
to the stage in a sleek black
convertible. The popular vo
cal group, made up of Cheryl
Bentyne, Tim Hauser, Alan
Paul and Janis Siegel, pre
sented themselves to the
crowd at Frost with intense
energy and love of music.
This intensity was immedi
ately transferred to the audi
ence, which sprang to life the
minute the group began their
set with the classic opening
tune, "Four Brothers."
The group was joined on
several of the songs by Getz
in addition to being backed
by Reid and Lewis through
out their set.
Running through favorites
like "Route 66," "Corner
pocket," "Tuxedo Junction"
and "Operator," the Manhat
ten Tranfer was delightful in
their casual style and
friendly rapport with the au
dience.
Though they joked around
a great deal and even muffed
a few introductions, the
entire production was purely
professional entertainment.
