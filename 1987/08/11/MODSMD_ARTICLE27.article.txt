Wassenaar rolling,
others still struggle
Rob Wassenaar continues to
serve notice that his past suc
cesses on the pitcher's mound
were no fluke.
The right-handed reliever,
now playing for the Angels'
Class A affiliate in Salem. Ore.,
is producing the kind of num
bers that get noticed by the
higher-ups in the organization.
Wassenaar has appeared in
15 games and pitched 32 in
nings. He has a 2-2 record and a
miniscule 1.69 ERA. He has
allowed only 31 hits and 11
walks, while striking out 39.
That gives Wassenaar an out
standing 10.97 strikeouts per
game, and an excellent 3.54
strikeout-to-walk ratio.
His 1986 College World Se

ries champion teammates still
haven't come into their own.
Ruben Amaro, a teammate of
Wassenaar's at Salem, is bat
ting .217, with 11 RBIs and one
home run in 115 at-bats. David
Esquer, playing for the Orioles
in the New York-Penn League,
is hitting .243.
A 1 Osuna has been promoted
to the Astros Asheville affiliate
in the South Atlantic League.
In his first week there he ap
peared in one game and allowed
four hits in one inning.
But on a more optimistic
note, Pete Stanicek was drafted
by the Orioles in 1985 and has
been having an excellent year.
He batted .315 in 88 games for
Class AA Charlotte. That was
good enough to earn him a
promotion to Class AAA
Rochester where he met up with
another former Stanford star,

Rob Wassenaar continues to
baffle the opposition.
1985 graduate Jeff Ballard.
Ballard held several Stanford
pitching records until Jack
McDowell broke many of them
this past season.
Stanicek seems certain to
have a major league future

playing second base, but there's
one thing standing in his way.
The Orioles current second
baseman is Bill Ripken, son of
manager Cal Ripken Sr. One
Orioles official thinks that
Stanicek is better than the
young Ripken.
Spring training 1988 prom
ises to be quite a battle. Stay
tuned.
Card hopes to play
San Jose St.in '88
When the Stanford Cardinal
meets the San Jose State Spar
tans on the gridiron this year it
will extend the rivalry's streak
to 29 years. But, as the
schedules now stand, the streak
will not reach 30.
Athletic directors Andy
Geiger of Stanford and Randy
Hoffman of SJS are working to
make sure that does not hap
pen.
In order to make room for the
game, Arizona must find an
other opponent for next year,

Geiger said. Stanford and
Arizona are scheduled to meet
on Oct. 8, 1988 in an optional
ninth Pac-10 game for both
teams.
If another opponent can be
found for Arizona, Stanford and
San Jose State will shuffle their
existing schedules to find a date
for the game. Stanford's open
dates will be Sept. 3 and Oct. 8,
while San Jose State's are Sept.
17, Oct. 15 and Nov. 26.
Shuffling the schedules
should be easy, according to
Geiger and Hoffman.
"It's an important game,"
Geiger told the San Jose Mer
cury News. "It's a game we will
always try to play. I think we
will play it."
In other football news, former
star quarterback John Paye did
not play in last Saturday's Hall
of Fame game. The 49er rookie
is still suffering from pain in his
right shoulder. Paye has un
dergone two operations in the
past two years on the shoulder.
