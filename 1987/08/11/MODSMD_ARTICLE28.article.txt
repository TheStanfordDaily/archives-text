## Green books move to auxiliary site 
### JAMES LIN 
Hundreds of thousands of
books are being moved out of
Green Library in preparation
for renovations planned for the
coming academic year.
The renovations will involve
adding seismic bracing to the
West Stack that will enable the
structure to withstand a serious
earthquake, according to Joan
Krasner, chief of access services
for the library.
''The West Stack was built in
1919 and is the oldest part of
Green Library," Krasner said.
"The [earthquake safety] codes
have changed considerably in
those decades."
In addition to the structural
reinforcement, the library will
install modern environmental
controls designed to better
preserve the books housed in
the stacks, Krasner said.
Krasner said she expects the
renovations to continue for at
least 10 months. "We're looking
for a June or July completion,"
she said.
"When the West Stack is com
pleted, we will move all the ma
terials back, hopefully in time
for the start of the 1988-89 aca
demic year," she said.
The collections being moved,
which include all those in the
Jonsson Library of Government
Documents, contain almost
600,000 volumes. Most of the
relocated books are rarely used,
Krasner said.
"What we're moving are ma
terials acquired by the library
before or during the mid-19605.
Most of these materials are
older, lesser used materials in
the humanities," she said.

Academic journals that are
used more often have been
reclassified and retained in
Green. "We conferred con
stantly with the faculty during
this process on which books to
move and which to keep," Kras
ner said.
The moving process should be
completed by the end of the
week, when the renovations are
expected to begin, Krasner said.
She estimated that more than a
million books have been trans
ferred in the past three months.
While the materials from the
Jonsson Library have moved to
the basement of Meyer Library,
the remaining books are now lo
cated at a new auxiliary library
in the former commissary build

ing on Pampas Lane.
Subjects at the Stanford Aux
iliary Library will include phi
losophy, psychology, religion,
languages and linguistics, an
thropology, applied science,
technology, medicine, history
and geography.
From now until late August,
books from the auxiliary library
can only be retrieved by paging
them at the Green Library loan
desk, Krasner said.
The auxiliary library will
open on August 24, and materi
als can be checked out directly
at that time.
While no reference librarian
will be available at the auxil
iary library, staff will assist
users during the library's open

hours, Krasner said. Photocopy
machines and study space will
be available, and the Mar
guerite will provide transporta
tion to and from the building on
the Blue/Purple line.
Expected hours for the auxil
iary library are 10 a.m. to 6
p.m. on weekdays and 1 p.m. to
5 p.m. on Sunday.
Between summer and fall
quarters the auxiliary library
will be open Monday through
Thursday 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. and
Friday from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. It
will be closed on weekends.
When renovation of the West
Stacks is finished, the auxiliary
library will remain open to li
brary users and will be used as
overflow shelving for lesser
used materials.
