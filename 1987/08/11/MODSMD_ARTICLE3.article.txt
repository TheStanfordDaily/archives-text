# Stanford, NASA consider center
## News 
### A.J. THOMAS Editorial staff 
University scientists met
with officials at the National
Aeronautics and Space Ad
minstration in Washington,
D.C., last week to discuss estab
lishing a major space research
center on campus.
Elliot Levinthal, director of
the Stanford Institute for
Manufacturing and Automa
tion, and Electrical Engineer
ing Prof. Leonard Tyler talked
with the space agency. Both
declined to comment on the pro
posal.
Levinthal and Tyler pre
sented a proposal to NASA on
Wednesday for establishing a
joint research center on campus
dedicated to training future
space scientists and engineers,
according to the San Jose Mer
cury News.
Calling the talks "nothing
new," Levinthal said Stanford
and NASA routinely have "lots
of discussions . . . about ways to
foster better relations." He said
it would be "premature" to label
the discussions formal negotia
tions.
The Aug. 5 issue of the San
Jose Mercury News said Levin

thai and Tyler had presented "a
proposal that could make Stan
ford the undisputed leader in
university space research."
Tyler admitted there was a
proposal under consideration
but said he did not wish to dis
cuss it because it "is not in the
public domain."
"We don't know where the
[press] accounts came from,"he
said.
"It is not a formal proposal at
this stage," Tyler said, adding
that he might be willing to dis
cuss it at length in anywhere
from one week to "a month or
more."
Levinthal denied any pro
posal had been made, saying
that NASA had announced two
months ago that it was inter
ested in establishing "a number
of space engineering research
centers throughout the nation."
He said NASA was planning
to hold a bidders' briefing soon
and predicted that at least 500
universities would make
proposals.
According to Electrical Engi
neering Prof. Peter Banks, the
idea of creating a center here
has been"in the air for about a
year."
Banks, who headed a NASA
space station advisory commit
tee this spring, said he was not
involved in the current discus
sions but has a general under
standing of the proposal.
NASA would pay about $1.5
million a year to run the Stan
ford center, while the Univer
sity would own the buildings
and provide the staff, Banks
said.
The center "would put Stan
ford on the map as the
preeminent place to go for space
science and space engineering,"
Banks said.
"I'm hoping that Stanford
will be the first in line to have a
formal relationship with
NASA," he added.
According to Larry Colin,
chief of the space sciences at
NASA's Ames Research Center
in Mountain View, a program
here would be unique among
the space ageny's current rela
tionship with universities.
"NASA has many many ties
to other universities," he told
The Daily. "But as I understand
it this will be more broad
based."

Programs at other univer
sities focus on specific tasks or
research areas, Colin said.
Colin also said he anticipated
that the Stanford research cen
ter would work closely with the
Ames Center. "If it comes to
pass, we hope we can do some
joint projects together," he said.
Such a center would give a
big boost to NASA's efforts to
rebuild the space program,
Colin said.
"Clearly there is not enough
science expertise within the
NASA institution itself. If we
are going to regain leadership
in space, the source is going to
come from newly trained
graduate students," he said.
Colin said his involvement in
the process has been to make
suggestions on how the Univer
sity and Ames might cooperate.
Colin added that Stanford
would probably cooperate with
a number of NASA research
facilities, including the Jet
Propulsion Laboratory in
Pasadena.
Stanford is already one of the
country's leading universities
in terms of funding for space re
search, receiving $20 million a
year for 160 NASA-sponsored
projects.
