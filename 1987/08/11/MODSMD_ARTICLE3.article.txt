# Stanford, NASA consider center
## News 
### A.J. THOMAS Editorial staff 
University scientists met
with officials at the National
Aeronautics and Space Ad
minstration in Washington,
D.C., last week to discuss estab
lishing a major space research
center on campus.
Elliot Levinthal, director of
the Stanford Institute for
Manufacturing and Automa
tion, and Electrical Engineer
ing Prof. Leonard Tyler talked
with the space agency. Both
declined to comment on the pro
posal.
Levinthal and Tyler pre
sented a proposal to NASA on
Wednesday for establishing a
joint research center on campus
dedicated to training future
space scientists and engineers,
according to the San Jose Mer
cury News.
Calling the talks "nothing
new," Levinthal said Stanford
and NASA routinely have "lots
of discussions . . . about ways to
foster better relations." He said
it would be "premature" to label
the discussions formal negotia
tions.
The Aug. 5 issue of the San
Jose Mercury News said Levin

thai and Tyler had presented "a
proposal that could make Stan
ford the undisputed leader in
university space research."
Tyler admitted there was a
proposal under consideration
but said he did not wish to dis
cuss it because it "is not in the
public domain."
"We don't know where the
[press] accounts came from,"he
said.
"It is not a formal proposal at
this stage," Tyler said, adding
that he might be willing to dis
cuss it at length in anywhere
from one week to "a month or
more."
Levinthal denied any pro
posal had been made, saying
that NASA had announced two
months ago that it was inter
ested in establishing "a number
of space engineering research
centers throughout the nation."
He said NASA was planning
to hold a bidders' briefing soon
and predicted that at least 500
universities would make
proposals.
According to Electrical Engi
neering Prof. Peter Banks, the
idea of creating a center here
has been"in the air for about a
year."
