# Second parking structure gets underway
## 
### CHRIS CRADER Staff writer 
Campus commuters should find more
parking spaces by the end of the week after
the last safety rails are hammered into the
top levels of Parking Structure I, a five
level facility at Campus Drive and Roth
Way.
The first level, of the $9.4 million
structure was completed and opened three
weeks ago. Now all that's left for construc
tion workers are the finishing touches on
the top levels. "We're shooting for
(completion) this week," said Dennis
Perkinson, managing director of transpor
tation programs.
The guard rails for the structure were all
pre-cast except for the last piece on each
level. The remaining gaps were measured
on-site and the parts individually cast.

These parts should be delivered to the site
some day this week, and then they will be
painted and installed.
"It's really a trivial thing," Perkinson
said, citing safety and the possibility con
struction work would damage parked cars
as reasons for delay.
The structure will provide 1,050 spaces
when it is fully in use. It will contain
mostly "C" parking permit spaces and a sec
tion for metered parking. The meters have
not yet been installed.
Work has already begun on Parking
Structure 11, located in the Near West area
of campus across from the Roble tennis
courts. Construction began two weeks ago
and is expected to take 15 months. The
structure is scheduled to open in late Octo
ber or early November 1988.

The $8.7 million project will provide 750
parking spaces on six levels.
Because this lot is being built on the pres
ent lot adjacent to Forsythe Hall, tempo
rary parking for 190 cars will be con
structed on the Roble tennis courts. A new
tennis court complex will first be built the
Near West area across Campus Drive from
Governor's Corner.
The parking on the Roble Court site will
be used only until the completion of the
structure. There are no further plans for
the area, but the new tennis courts will be
permanent, according to Lewis Darrow,
project manager for Structure 11.
"Everything is going very well," Darrow
said. "We're operating on schedule."
Darrow added that there are plans to set
up a courtyard near the new facility with
extensive landscaping.
