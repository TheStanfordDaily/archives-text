## Kyoto program promising, others planned 
### ERIN MARTIN Staff writer 
Pending final land negotiations, the
new Stanford center in Kyoto, Japan,
will open in September, 1988, according
to Director of Overseas Studies Thomas
Heller.
University officials are discussing the
location of the new campus with private
landowners and the government of
Kyoto, Heller said.
"At this point in time, the negotiations
are extremely delicate," he said. "But it
looks very positive."
Japanese architects prepared for
Overseas Studies diagrams and models
of proposed buildings, which Heller de
scribed as "very elegant and spectacu
lar."

The center in Japan is only one of
several new overseas campuses Stanford
plans to open by 1990.
The center in Japan is only one of

getina, Costa Rica and Brazil are also
planned.
The Kyoto Center in Japanese Studies
will begin classes in the fall of 1988 with
32 students, including five from Stan
ford.
KCJS, administered by Stanford, will
function as a consortium of eight Ameri
can universities. It will offer classes in
Japanese language, history and culture.
The Stanford Center for Technology
and Innovation, a separate department
of the Kyoto center, will be administered
by Stanford and composed of Stanford

students.
SCTI is scheduled to open in the
spring of 1989 with positions for 30 stu
dents to study engineering, earth
sciences, humanities and sciences, busi
ness and law of contemporary Japan.
Heller said the University intends to
expand the Kyoto program over the next
few years to accommodate other fields of
study, assuming the successful comple
tion of facilities and classes in KCJS and
SCTI.
Heller said the final OK for the Kyoto
proposal should come by early fall.
"We hope that we will eventually be
able to work into other parts of Asia as
well â€” maybe into Korea or mainland
China," Heller said.
Overseas Studies also anticipates the
opening of a new center in Jerusalem in

the fall of 1988.
The Jerusalem program, which will
focus on Israeli history, politics and lan
guage, will run in conjunction with He
brew University.
According to Heller, the University
plans to open a center for Latin-
American studies in 1989, which will
probably be based in Buenos Aires, Ar
gentina.
The Buenos Aires center will concen
trate on issues of Third World develop
ment, Heller said.
A pilot program to run during the
summer of 1988 in Guadacaste, Costa
Rica, will involve classes and work with
regions lacking adequate medical care.
It will act as a probe to discover the ne
cessary dimensions of a similar program
in Argentina.
