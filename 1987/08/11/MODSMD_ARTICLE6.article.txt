Strikers shut down S. African mines
JOHANNESBURG, South Africa — Striking black
miners shut down production at more than a third of South
Africa's gold and coal mines yesterday to support their
demands for higher wages and safer working conditions.
The National Union of Mineworkers said that 340,000 of
the country's 550,000 black miners, including many who are
not union members, had stopped work. Support for the strike
was growing and could spread soon to mines where the union
is not recognized, the union said.
The South African Chamber of Mines, which had earlier
predicted that relatively few miners would heed the strike
call, acknowledged yesterday evening that at least 40 percent
of the country's black miners were on strike and that the larg
est mines were the hardest hit.
Work was effectively halted at 44 of the 46 struck mines,
the union said, noting that these mines produce more than
half of South Africa's gold and 20 percent of its coal. The
Chamber of Mines contended that only 31 of its members' 99
mines had been closed by the strike, but agreed that a
prolonged strike at those mines would have a substantial eco
nomic impact.
President defers to Central Americans
WASHINGTON — President Reagan has placed his
Central America peace proposal on hold and is determined to
give the five Central American presidents a chance to make a
success of their plan, administration officials said yesterday.
White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said that the
plan adopted Friday in Guatamala City by the presidents of
Nicaragua, El Salvador, Costa Rica, Honduras and
Guatamala "clearly moves the process forward in an encour
aging manner" although he said it is too early to predict
whether it will actually bring peace and democracy to
Marxist-ruled Nicaragua.
At the same time, State Department spokesman Charles
Redman said that the United States, despite its own proposal
for peace in the region, will work with the Central American
nations toward making their initiative succeed.
Fitzwater delivered a mild rebuke to Vice President George
Bush, Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger and others who
have said that the Guatemala City plan makes too many
concessions to Nicaragua's Sandinista government and places
the U.S.-backed contras in an untenable position.
"You will find within the administration a whole spectrum
of attitudes about this proposal," Fitzwater said. "The vice
president's viewpoint is one, and I can give you probably 40 or
50 others. . . . But I think it is fair to say that everyone in the
administration, including Secretary Weinberger, Vice Presi
dent Bush and everyone else, agrees with the overall policy of
seeking a negotiated settlement in Central America."
New commerce secretary nominated
WASHINGTON — President Reagan said yesterday that
he would nominate C. William Verity, the 70-year-old former
chairman of an Ohio steel company, to succeed the late Mal
colm Baldrige as secretary of commerce.
In brief remarks at a White House news conference,
Reagan said he expected Verity to continue pursuing both the
administration's free trade policies and its efforts "to keep vi
tal technology from falling into the hands of our adversaries,"
primarily the Soviet Union.
Verity told Reagan at yesterday's introductory session that
"all the specifics you mentioned, I endorse," although as head
of Armco Inc., a Middletown, Ohio, diversified steel producer,
he was known as an effective advocate of trade protection for
the steel industry and later as a supporter of greater trade
with the Soviets.
Verity said he would not comment further until his confir
mation hearing in the Senate Commerce Committee this fall.
Reagan also sidestepped reporters' queries, saying "There are
questions, but no answers." The president has not held an
open press conference since the economic summit in Venice in
June.
Bolivian anti-cocaine efforts improve
LA PAZ, Bolivia — Law enforcement officials are still
losing the war to stop the cocaine traffic between Bolivia and
the United States, but U.S. officials say that Bolivia's special
battalion of cocaine police — although widely regarded as in
ept and corrupt — is beginning to mend its ways.
The special battalion, known as the Leopards, has been
reorganized. Since May, it has been getting jungle training
from a team of U.S. Army specialists and close support from
an augmented squad of Drug Enforcement Administration
agents.
One optimistic U.S. official predicts that improvements in
the unit's performance could turn around the war against
cocaine. "There is light at the end of the tunnel in Bolivia,"
this official said the other day.
But it will take months of sterling conduct to persuade
some skeptics that the Leopards have changed their ways.
Bolivians involved in anti-cocaine efforts say that a succes
sion of corrupt officers has given traffickers wide latitude to
operate in exchange for big bribes.
