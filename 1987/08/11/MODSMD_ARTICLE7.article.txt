DUBAI, United Arab
Emirates — An American
operated supertanker carrying
Iranian oil hit an underwater
mine yesterday in the Gulf of
Oman — the region's first re
ported mining outside the
waters of the Persian Gulf.
As the almost seven-year-old
Iran-Iraq war suffered that sig
nificant escalation, a convoy of
American warships and three
Kuwaiti-owned tankers inched
its way toward Kuwait after the
discovery of another mine in the
shipping channels leading to
the northern end of the Persian
Gulf.
Iraq, meanwhile, announced
that it had broken a de facto
truce in the air war with Iran,
sending fighter bombers to at
tack oil installations in the
north and southeast. Iran re
ported that a number of
workers had been killed.
Shipping officials said the
250,015-ton supertanker Tex
aco Caribbean, owned by Lexi
ngton Tankships Ltd., a subsid
iary of Texaco Panama Inc., and
operated by the National Bulk
Carrier Corp. of New York, hit
the mine at midday as it was
entering the anchorage off
Fujaira, a port on the eastern
coast of the United Arab

Emirates.
The blast blew a three-toot
long hole in the ship's left side,
just below the waterline. The
ship had taken on a full load of
crude oil from Iran's Larak Is
land terminal, where Iranian
tankers unload oil that they
carry from Kharg Island in the
northern gulf, about nine hours
before. Shipping officials said
that by nightfall, oil was still
leaking into the sea, causing

substantial pollution of the
waters around Fujaira.
A statement from Texaco Inc.
of White Plains, N.Y., said that
there were no injuries to the
tanker's crew. The ship is on
lease for one trip to a Nor
wegian trading company.
Shipping sources in the gulf
said the destination was Rotter
dam, in the Netherlands.
