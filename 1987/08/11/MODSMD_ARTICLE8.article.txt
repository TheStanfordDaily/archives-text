WASHINGTON â€” A U.S.
Navy fighter plane last
weekend fired two missiles at
an Iranian aircraft "perceived"
to be threatening an unarmed
U.S. patrol plane flying over the
Navy escort of Kuwaiti oil
tankers through the Strait of
Hormuz, Reagan administra
tion sources said yesterday.
Both missiles fired by the
Navy F-14 Tomcat fighter ap
parently missed their target,
sources said. But the firing is
believed to be the first direct
hostile act by U.S. forces
against Iranian military forces
in years, and marks a signifi
cant moment in the long con
frontation between the United

States and the Iranian regime
of Ayatollah Ruhollah Kho
meini.
Sources said the episode
began when a suspected Iranian
warplane approached a U.S. P-3
surveillance plane while the
convoy of three reflagged
tankers and three U.S. war
ships steamed into the troubled
Persian Gulf.
The P-3 aircraft "was per
ceived to be threatened" by the
approaching contact, and warn
ings to stay away were issued
by U.S. forces, sources said. But
the intruder airplane did not
respond, sources said.
