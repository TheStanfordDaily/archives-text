Hoover fellow emeritus
receives ISSA award
Stefan Possony, senior fellow
emeritus at the Hoover Institu
tion, has received an award
from the International Strate
gic Studies Association for his
"outstanding contributions to
strategic philosophy and
humanity," Hoover announced
last week.
Possony, who taught interna
tional politics for 15 years at
Georgetown University, has
served as an adviser to the
White House, the Air Force and
the Navy.
ISSA is a nonpartisan, non

Population biology key
science, Ehrlich says
Charging that the United
States' failure to use new
knowledge about population bi
ology is costing the country
"billions of dollars," Biology
Prof. Paul Ehrlich called for a
quadrupling of federal funding
for the field in a speech to the
American Institute of Biologi
cal Sciences yesterday.
Addressing the institute's
38th annual meeting at Ohio
State University, Ehrlich said
the National Science Founda
tion needs to spend about $4 bil
lion a year on population biol

ogy "if we wish to maintain an
organized technological soci
ety."
"Not heeding the lessons of
this centrally important disci
pline could lead to a collapse of
civilization over the next few
decades," Ehrlich warned.
Population biology includes
ecology, evolutionary biology
behavior and taxonomy.
Ehrlich called it"the single
most important branch of sci
ence from the standpoint of
solving the human predica
ment."
"There are very real
deadlines for solving the bur
geoning problems of ecosystem
health. If we fail to so, diseases
like cancer and AIDS will be
among the least of our worries,"
he said.
Ehrlich, who is the Bing pro
fessor of population biology
here, cited several areas where
the expertise of population biol
ogy could save money and lives:
controlling disease-carrying or
ganisms, designing better an
tibiotics, evaluating toxic
chemicals, harvesting the
oceans and reducing human
damage to the environment.
