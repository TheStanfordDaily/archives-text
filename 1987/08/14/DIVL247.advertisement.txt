BEGINNING
AEROBICS.
Learning to fly is no easy task. But The Stanford Flying Club makes it fun.
Our step by step lessons will have you flying like a pro in no time. We'll
take you all the way from your first lesson to your pilot's license. After that,
you might try one of our advanced training or aerobatics classes.
Once you're a pilot, you'll wonder why you didn't do it sooner.
Call today between 1:00 - 5:30 pm and get the details.
