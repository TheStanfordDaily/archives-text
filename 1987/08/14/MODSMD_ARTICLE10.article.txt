New Orientation
debate worthwhile
In response to your Aug. 7
editorial titled "Keep the
Debates," we would like to
clarify a few points.
This year for the first time,
Orientation will be five days
instead of six in order to avoid
conflict with the Jewish high
holiday Rosh Hashonah.
Moreover, the first home foot
ball game falls on the Saturday
of Orientation week. This has
required serious restructuring
of the Orientation calendar.
Our primary goal is that Orien
tation 1987 offers a balanced
introduction to the academic,
intellectual, cultural and social
opportunities at Stanford.
One of the main concerns
expressed in the editorial was
the threatened intellectual
quality of the New Student
Orientation 1987 due to the
replacement of last year's three
concurrent small debates with
one central debate attended by
the entire class. To ensure the
intellectual quality of Orienta
tion, the debate, "Why Are You
Here? A Debate on the

Purposes of a College Educa
tion," was chosen as a featured
evening event instead of the
traditional all-frosh dance.
Far from being a "watered
down forum on a very safe
topic," this year's debate
focuses on the most essential
question a person can ask: How
should I live my life and what
values should I have? Is the
best Stanford education to be
found in the library developing
one's critical thinking through
study and reading, or through
engagement and involvement
as a citizen of the world? Be
cause this topic affects every
new student, we though it
would be valuable for the
whole class to come together
for the debate.
Those who attended the
debates last year said they
were not true debates but
rather platforms through
which opinions were expressed.
This year, we believe the topic
will incite real argument
among the debaters that will
carry over to the students, as
they will be polled using a vis
ual ballot following the debate.
As to the statement about
inviting outside personalities, a

faculty debate means a faculty
debate, and thus we have
invited only Stanford faculty.
We believe that Stanford has
its own celebrities to feature.
In response to the remark
that the debate might be "a
contrived exercise designed to
impart Res Ed's own how-to
college message," such a state
ment implies that Residential
Education has a one
dimensional point of view it
would like all students to ad
here to without thought or
investigation. On the contrary,
Res Ed wants students to be
exposed to, and investigate
intellectual and social
opportunities and to sponsor
spirited dialogue about those
opportunities. That is the pur
pose of the Orientation debate.
Orientation is the time to set
the tone for each new student's
Stanford experience, and thus,
we have made every effort to
ensure that New Student Ori
entation 1987 equally high
lights the academic, intellec
tual, cultural and social aspects
of Stanford.
