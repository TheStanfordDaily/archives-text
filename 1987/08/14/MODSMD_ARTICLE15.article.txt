## Graduate student will study nutrition in Africa Mali: a country attracting student research 
### NASSRINE AZIMI 
Graduate students Shelly Sundberg
and Christopher Culy don't have much
in common, except a passion for the
country of Mali in West Africa.
These doctoral candidates will return
to the sub-Sahara Desert nation in a few
weeks, Sundberg on a grant from the
Center for Research in International
Studies, and Culy on a Fulbright-Hays
research scholarship from the Linguis
tics Department.
Landlocked Mali, three times the size
of California and with a population of
hardly eight million, is a tempting chal
lenge for many young Western research
ers. Sundberg, who previously worked
with a foreign aid agency in Western
Africa, said he believes "Mali's intact
culture and the warmth of the people
make it even more appealing to foreign
ers.
Sundberg will conduct a nutrition and
economic survey for Stanford's Food Re
search Institute. The survey will review
some 100 rural households around
Bamako, the capital city, and will give
Sundberg the opportunity to question
Malian housewives, who "are doing all
the work while the men sit in shade."
Sundberg is fluent in French, Mali's offi
cial language, and studies Bambara —
one of the country's 16 national dialects
— with Culy.
Culy, a Peace Corps volunteer in Mali
from 1983 to 1985, is a language special
ist — in addition to French, he speaks
the Bambara, Dogon and Fula dialects.
His research will be on the morphology
and syntax of two Dogon dialects.
Mali needs all the help it can get. Like
most of the Sahel — the area just south
of the North African Sahara Desert —
Mali, in addition to its daily woes, faces
two persistent plagues: drought and
desertification.

Pel, a village of 2,000 inhabitants, is a
case in point. This small community is
situated 500 miles northwest of Bamako,
and is only a few miles from the looming
Sahara Desert to the north.
Luc Delle Arama, Pel's local
schoolmaster, recently complained about
the lack of resources, everything from
books to paper to teachers. "We have not
even been paid for the last three
months," he said.
Last year, the teacher's union went on
strike and the government promised "to
take action." However, Arama said,
"Salaries are not coming." With a shrug
he added, "In Mali, money is the rarest
of commodities.
"Children drop out of school to work in
the capital as housekeepers or gardners.
The $1.50 school fee is too expensive for
their parents. Land is drier and the over
all price of grains on the international
market lower. Soon, farmers will not
even have enough cash to buy the strict
minimum," he said.
Estimates are that 26 percent of the
Sahel region, covering 19 countries, is
undergoing moderate to severe desert
ification. Two successive droughts, in
1971 and 1984, and the deforestation of
the Sahelian regions have made things
even worse.
Yet Sundberg remains optimistic.
"Mali's situation is more encouraging
than many other African nations," she
said. "This is one of the rare countries
that can cultivate rice, now an impor
tant food staple in this region. The po
tential of the Niger River — which
crosses the entire country — is immense
and not used at all.
"Mali's political problems are also less
prevalent than in many neighboring
countries. The government is willing to
apply reform in agriculture, people are
receptive to new technologies and cor
ruption is not as rampant as in some

other African nations. It is all rather
stimulating," she added.
Mali's population is divided into 10
major ethnic groups. The Bambara —
who comprise the majority — seem to
have government reigns firmly in hand.
Gen. Moussa Traore, president after
seizing power in a military coup 19 years
ago, recently "invited" all ethnic groups
to become involved in government af
fairs.
Culy said he believes that ethnic vari
ety doesn't need to be a negative issue.
"The Malians are one of the gentlest
people in Africa and very open to out
siders and differing ideas," he said.
The challenge for Malians, foreign aid
agencies and young researchers like
Sundberg and Culy is nevertheless im

mense. Adult literacy in Mali stands
below 15 percent, industry is almost
non-existant and agriculture, the pri
mary source of income, is highly vulner
able to climate changes. Soils are poor,
technology stagnant and production al
ternatives limited. In a 1986 World
Bank report, Mali has the third lowest
per capita income in the world, after
Bangladesh and Ethiopia.
But, at sunset, Mali's troubles seem to
disappear. In Bamako, the Niger takes
on a magic tone. On the river banks,
women clad in colorful robes wash
clothes, while old men bend to water
onion plots by hand. The chants from the
mosques fill the land.
"In Mali," said Sundberg, "it is almost
impossible not to have faith in the fu
ture."

These kids from the village of Pel in Mali attend school for a fee of approximately
$1.50 a year. Education is a critical issue for Malians: last year a teacher's strike
lasted almost two months at a time when literacy stands at hardly 15 percent.
