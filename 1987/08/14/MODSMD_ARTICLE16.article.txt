# Preferential housing is OK, officials here say

### SALLY RICHARDS 
Every year almost 500 male students exercise their
"fraternal right" to inhabit palatial living quarters,
while the majority of students find themselves at the
mercy of the "luck of the draw."
All students who want on-campus housing take part
in the annual housing draw except fraternity members,
who occupy 10 of the 70 University-owned residences.
Joe Pisano, fraternal affairs adviser, acknowledges
that many have questioned the equity of exempting
fraternities from the housing draw and letting them
choose their own members, considering the University
owns the houses.
"By any objective standard it is not fair. Is it fair that
one department has its office in the Inner Quad rather
than somewhere else? [Fraternity housing] exists be
cause it is part of our history," said Pisano.
Diana Conklin, assistant dean of Residential Educa
tion and director of the Row, respects the tradition.
"[Fraternities] are not part of the housing draw be
cause they have fraternal privilege," said Conklin.
"What that means is they have the privilege of selec
ting their own members."
Norm Robinson, acting dean of Student Affairs, had
a similar response.
"The basic reason is historical," Robinson said. "In
most cases the fraternities have been around since the
University opened. Their alumni contributed the
money that built the houses. So while there was no
guarantee that the fraternity would be able to occupy

the houses forever, there was an idea that as long as
the group occupying the houses complied with Univer
sity policy they would be able to stay," he said.
"There is a feeling that it's the University's obliga
tion to be responsive to the original intent of the
donors," he added.
Until the 19605, fraternity groups leased University
land and financed the construction of their own houses.
During that decade the University introduced an
agreement to buy the run-down houses and offer frater
nities priority in new houses under the condition that
fraternities would solicit part of the cost. Technically,
though, all the money for these new houses was
donated directly to the University, even though frater
nities solicited part of it, to avoid taxes.
Over time these agreements spread and the Univer
sity became the owner of most of the fraternities. Those
groups that chose not to be bought up remained in their
residences, but later, in most cases because of financial
problems, the University once again intervened with a
helping hand and purchased the houses. Sigma Chi,
the only remaining self-owned fraternity on campus,
never made such a deal with the University and was
able to weather their financial storms.
Thus, the financial relationship between the Univer
sity and fraternities is almost no different than be
tween the University and other campus residences. But
does the University have different expectations for stu
dent behavior in dorm than it does for fraternities?
When asked why the University seems to tolerate
more from the fraternities than from other campus

houses, University President Donald Kennedy an
swered that outrageous fraternity behavior is not
tolerated.
"[ Phi Delta Theta] had one incident that had me a
little aroused," said Kennedy. "That's just one blot on
what otherwise has not been a particularly bad record,"
he said.
Last October an unusually loud party at the Phi Delt
house was shut down by the police after a. complaint
was reported at 3:20 a.m. by a call from Kennedy.
"In the case of the Phi Delt incident, I had the entire
membership of the fraterity in my office at 7:30 the
morning after. I told them never to do it again, and
they haven't. If that constitutes tolerance, we have a
slightly different view of the meaning," said Kennedy.
During the 1985-86 school year, four fraternities
were put on social probation. Social probation restricts
the fraternities from sponsoring social functions.
In 1986 the Delta Upsilon fraternity had their
housing privileges revoked because of four years of
serious behavioral problems, according to Pisano. Last
April David Dunshee, a Zeta Psi member, drowned in
Lake Lagunita after drinking at a fraternity party.
William Stone, director of the Alumni Association,
said he believes that if the abuse of fraternity
privileges continues, equity in the housing policy will
cease to be an issue.
"It sounds to me like organized suicide to be as
abusive and insensitive of their responsibity to the
University that some of them are," Stone said. "Give
them enough rope and they'll hang themselves."
