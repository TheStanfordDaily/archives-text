On Other Days While Going Home
By Michelle Carter
Murrow Press, 1987. $15.95
Almost everyone has at one time or an
other dreamt of taking off — hitting the
road in search of freedom and perhaps a
place to belong.
In Michelle Carter's new novel, "On
Other Days While Going Home," we follow
Annie, a disillusioned and streetwise 18-
year-old, on such a quest.
Carter, who did both her undergraduate
and graduate work here, now teaches in the
Creative Writing Program.
This novel — her first — is an ambitious
work, a book that takes a fresh approach to
the genre of "on the road" novels. These
novels explore the process of self-discovery
through a character's journey from home
and perhaps back again.
Carter's book is well-crafted, full of vivid
and surprising characters whose lives are
poignant, sad and funny. But even more so,
"On Other Days While Going Home" is a
heart-thumping precipitous trek across the
darker side of the American landscape.
Carter's characters are those living at the
lower end of the social ladder. They are, at
times, the lonely figures who always seem
to be in trouble, in need of money, unable to
keep away from danger or in jail.
Whatever the reason for their circum
stances, their faith in sex, drugs and rock
n' roll acts like a religion to help these

people survive.
It is in this world Annie has spent her
first 18 years — a tough, concrete neighbor
hood south of Market Street in San Fran
cisco where she lives in the back room of the
bond office her Aunt Marie manages.
In the book's prologue, the 10-year-old
Annie is introduced as a young girl
protected from the world around her by her
aunt and a family friend, Jotta.

But lurking outside is a world dominated
by men, a dangerous world that both
excites and confuses Annie.
Her confusion about the relationship be
tween men and women increases as she
watches while Jotta is reduced to helpless
ness by Tom Cleaver, her husband. Tom, a
sadistic biker, renders this interesting

woman powerless every time he reappears.
But that is the past.
Eight years later, Jotta lives in Massa
chusetts, is married to a better man and is
trying to forget the past. Annie is lovesick
for a man named Carter, who is twice her
age and has left for Wyoming.
So Annie takes off, first in search of
Carter, who lives with a group of musicians
caught up in lies and legends. Unable to fit
in to the world and tired of Carter's exces
sive self-pity, Annie heads east toward
Jotta, along the way running across a mul
titude of misfits looking for love.
Meanwhile, following Annie like a
shadowy past is Tom. Just released from
prison, Tom keeps watch over Annie and
waits, hoping she will lead him to his ex
wife Jotta, whom he can't forget.
In a sense Tom is a mythical character, a
symbol for the street life that promises
freedom and excitement. He is made even
more desirable by his dangerous nature.
Michelle Carter expertly develops a raw
and surprising world. This first book
refreshingly lacks the self-indulgent prose
of many first novels. Annie's world unfolds
dramatically, each character is real — a
flawed human being trying to come to
terms with how to live, how to make the
hard choices we all must make.
As Annie nears the end of her journey, as
her past, present and future converge, we
are shocked and exhilarated with her
choice. She accepts the dangers of living as
a woman on the road and prepares for her
future.
