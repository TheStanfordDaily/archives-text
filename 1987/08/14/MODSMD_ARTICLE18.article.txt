Snow White
and the Seven Dwarfs ****
Park Theatre
1275 El Camino, Menlo Park
"Snow White" as a film is starting to
show a little age. The colors just aren't
that clear and defined and the sound
isn't anywhere near Dolby quality. But
since no one goes to see this film for
those reasons anyway, those points are
pretty moot.
The music is still timeless as is the
plot, the simplest of good-guy, bad-guy
stories. It is interesting to note that
both the villian and the hero are
female, but other than that it's the
same old story.
In some of the slower parts — such as
the close-ups of Snow White — the
movie actually doesn't live up to expec
tations.
But the dwarfs are as spectacular as
ever, and Dopey will charm every
viewer regardless of age. See this one, if
only to remember there should be a
little child in all of us.

Summer School **
Century 10
1500 Stierlin Road, Mountain View
Mark Harmon may win awards for
being "The sexiest man alive," but he's
not likely to win anything for his role in
"Summer School."
In his big-screen debut, Harmon
plays Freddy Shoop, a totally lax physi
cal education teacher blackmailed by a
school administrator into teaching
remedial English to a group of high
school lunkheads. Harmon's portrayal
of Shoop is adequate, but one
dimensional.
The best moments of the film concern
the exploits of the class clowns, Dave
and Chainsaw, who get their kicks im
itating Siskel and Ebert and grossing
out their teachers and peers with
gruesome monster make up. Sadly, very
little of the film is as funny as the scene
where the clowns pretend to be attacked
by "bunnies from hell."
"Summer School" does have a few
good moments that keep it out of the
"Reprehensible Teen Film" category,
but it's far from another "Breakfast
Club."

Kevin Costner faces the business end of a barrel in his role as the hunter and the hunted
in "No Way Out" — opening today at Palo Alto Square.
