## Watch out Blue Jays! The Yanks are coming (back) 
### 
Two weeks ago in this space, I sugges
ted that the A's might win their division
and a week later they were in first place.
Last week, I made a similar prediction
about the Giants, and, lo and behold,
they moved into first a couple of days
ago.

Admittedly, the A's have dropped back
a little — that fact has left me wonder
ing about just how much magic a men
tion in this column can generate. But,
what the heck, I may as well try it
again. . . .
To put it mildly, the past week has not
been a good one for the' New York
Yankees. The Bronx Bombers have
vacated first place for the first time in a
long while.
Yankee owner George Steinbrenner,

the man who captures more headlines
than anyone else in baseball, let his
team know he was displeased the way he
usually does — he told the papers.
This week's statement was vintage
Steinbrenner: blaming the manager for
the team's slump. Steinbrenner doesn't
understand that a team can lose a few
games every once in a while. Usually,
his prescription for team is to fire the
manager. Remarkably, Lou Piniella still
has his job.
It has probably occurred to Steinbren
ner that despite their current mis
fortune, the Yankees have a good chance
to win their division this year. Not a
great chance, mind you, but a good one.
Let's take a look at why.
Currently sitting atop the heap known
as the AL East are the Toronto Blue
Jays. Canada's finest denizens of the dia
mond do match up very well with the
Yanks.
Toronto has a well-balanced club with
some bona fide superstars. The starting
pitchers include the steady Jims —
Clancy and Key. They keep the Jays
close just about every time they take the

mound.
Along with them is the tempermental
but sometimes brilliant Dave Stieb.
Toronto's everyday line-up is quite im
pressive, too. The talented trio that
plays the outfield — George Bell, Jesse
Barfield and Lloyd Moseby — matches
up favorably with any in the game.
What then do the Yankees have to
match up with this formidable chal
lenger?
For starters, there's Don Mattingly. If
Mattingly plays like he has been for an
other decade, his name will most cer
tainly be mentioned in the same breath
as Mantle, DiMaggio and Ruth. He is the
best player in the game today.
Behind Mattingly in the batting order
the Yanks have Steinbrenner's favorite
punching bag, Dave Winfield. Winfield
has driven in 100 runs for five straight
years and will most certainly do it again
this year. The last Yankee to do that was
the aforementioned DiMaggio.
They also got plenty of power in guys
named Pagliarulo and Pasqua and even
some pitching of note.
Rick Rhoden has a good shot to win 20

in his first season in New York —
whether or not he is scuffing the ball.
Rhoaeix, along with future Hall of Famer
Ron Guidry and the Tommy "the Bionic
Man" John, give the Yankees proven
winners who will give it their best down
the stretch. In the pen, they've got Dave
Righetti who's no slouch himself.
But the one thing they have that
Toronto lacks is the Yankee mystique.
This team has won more times than
anyone else in the history of the game.
They've been denied a division title since
1981. It seems like its time for good ol'
Yankee pride to return for yet another
encore presentation.
When Rickey Henderson, baseball's
most awesome leadoff hitter, and Willie
Randolph, perhaps the most consistent
second baseman in the game for the past
11 years, return from the disabled list,
the Yankees awesome offensive machine
should start firing on all cylinders.
When that happens, they probably
should run for cover in Toronto.
