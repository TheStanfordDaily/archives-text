# Africa Fund gets positive review from study group
## 
### BRIAN RHOADS Staff writer 
The creation of an educational fund equivalent
in size to the University's South Africa-related
investments came one step closer to completion
as University officials and faculty members dis
cussed the issue in a meeting of the South Africa
Working Group last week.
Prof. Frederick Hillier, chair of the Commis
sion on Investment Responsibility, said the Stan
ford South Africa Fund is moving toward ap
proval "very deliberately."
The working group consists of representatives
from the faculty and the administration. It was
created by the Board of Trustees' Special Com
mittee on Investment Responsibility to iron out
the proposal and possibly implement it before the
next trustee meeting in September.
"We're moving ahead," Hillier said. He added,
however, that the Aug. 6 meeting was primarily
an idea-gathering one, saying that "nothing has
crystalized yet."
In its current form the South Africa Fund
would be used to finance educational programs
related to South Africa, such as internships there

for Stanford students or scholarships here for
South African blacks.
Last month Hillier predicted the fund might
receive administration approval without having
to wait for final review by the trustees.
Working group members appear optimistic
that some form of the plan will reach implemen
tation, though it may not be in the shape of the
current version of the fund, said Political Science
Prof. Richard Brody, chair of the group.
"There appears to be a lot of consensus in the
group that we increase the variety of programs,"
Brody said. Members recognize that "the needs
(for these South African programs) are great," he
added.
Asst. Director of University Relations Diana
Diamond, present at the South Africa Working
Group meeting, confirmed the existence of such
consensus. "There seems to be general support
for the concept of the fund," she said.
Brody cited the current Career Development
Fellowship as an example that "the University is
committed to contributing money to the educa
tion of black South Africans."
