# Africa Fund gets positive review from study group
## 
### BRIAN RHOADS Staff writer 
The creation of an educational fund equivalent
in size to the University's South Africa-related
investments came one step closer to completion
as University officials and faculty members dis
cussed the issue in a meeting of the South Africa
Working Group last week.
Prof. Frederick Hillier, chair of the Commis
sion on Investment Responsibility, said the Stan
ford South Africa Fund is moving toward ap
proval "very deliberately."
The working group consists of representatives
from the faculty and the administration. It was
created by the Board of Trustees' Special Com
mittee on Investment Responsibility to iron out
the proposal and possibly implement it before the
next trustee meeting in September.
"We're moving ahead," Hillier said. He added,
however, that the Aug. 6 meeting was primarily
an idea-gathering one, saying that "nothing has
crystalized yet."
In its current form the South Africa Fund
would be used to finance educational programs
related to South Africa, such as internships there

for Stanford students or scholarships here for
South African blacks.
Last month Hillier predicted the fund might
receive administration approval without having
to wait for final review by the trustees.
Working group members appear optimistic
that some form of the plan will reach implemen
tation, though it may not be in the shape of the
current version of the fund, said Political Science
Prof. Richard Brody, chair of the group.
"There appears to be a lot of consensus in the
group that we increase the variety of programs,"
Brody said. Members recognize that "the needs
(for these South African programs) are great," he
added.
Asst. Director of University Relations Diana
Diamond, present at the South Africa Working
Group meeting, confirmed the existence of such
consensus. "There seems to be general support
for the concept of the fund," she said.
Brody cited the current Career Development
Fellowship as an example that "the University is
committed to contributing money to the educa
tion of black South Africans."
In the fellowship program, or
ganized by Brody, Stanford has
offered three fellowships to
black South Africans for study
here next year.
"Even if there is not a South
Africa Fund," Brody said, it ap
pears the University will
remain committed to fund
raising efforts and programs
aiding South African blacks.
Hillier said the next step fol
lowing last week's meeting will
be the approval of the Provost's
and President's offices.
Provost James Rosse said the
plan had been "received and
discussed extensively in our of
fice."
When asked if it met his per
sonal approval, Rosse said, "I've
reviewed it, and I'm encour
aged. However, we have to come
forward with a viable set of
plans."

Rosse said meetings to dis
cuss such "viable plans" have
been scheduled for next week
and the following week.
President Donald Kennedy
was unavailable for comment.
According to Brody, the Uni
versity would like to establish a
universal South Africa program
to deal with the related pro
grams, but this would be diffi
cult. At issue are the
desirability of the fund, its over
lap with other South Africa pro
grams at Stanford and its mone
tary and administrative
feasibility, he said.
It is possible that the South
Africa Fund will fail to be
worked out administratively,
according to Diamond. "There
appears to be initial support for
the project," he said. But "it is
still at a very conceptual stage
— there are no dollar amounts."
Should the program fail to
reach implementation by this
fall, it remains on the agenda
for the September trustees'
meeting, Diamond said.
