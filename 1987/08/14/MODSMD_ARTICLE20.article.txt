Med Center plans
single-lung transplants
Doctors at the Medical Center
are ready to perform two
transplants of a single lung as
soon as they find suitable
donors.
Single-lung transplants are
more difficult surgical proce
dures than either heart
transplants or heart-lung
transplants, procedures for
which Stanford did the pioneer
ing work, according to Dr. Mi
chael Mill, chief resident in car
diac surgery.
Only a few single-lung opera
tions have been performed in
this country. Mill said the most
difficult aspect of the procedure
is preventing the body from re
jecting the new lung.

Dr. John Baldwin, director of
the heart-lung transplant pro
gram, has been interested in
doing tingle-lung operations for
quite some time, according to
Mill.
"He's done work in the
experimental laboratory to per
fect the technique and he
started accepting patients in
January for evaluation for
'suitability' for the operation,"
Mill said.
Candidates for single-lung
transplants are usually
patients with lung disease that
does not involve heart failure.
Mill was optimistic that
single-lung donors will be
easier to find than heart-lung
donors because heart-lung
transplants require two healthy
lungs while a donor with only
one good lung could donate for a

single-lung operation.
"Potentially, one donor could
donate both a heart and a single
lung for separate recipients,"
Mill said.
Stanford researchers,
Ugandan minister work
to save tropical forests
The Ugandan minister of en
vironmental protection met last
week with University biologists
and lawyers to discuss ways to
modify his country's develop
ment policies to reflect conser
vationist concerns.
Judge 8.8. Kamugasha at
tributed much of the damage to
his country's famous tropical
forests to massive population
shifts resulting from former
Ugandan President Idi Amin's

reign of terror, the recent civil
war and concurrent population
explosion.
The people who traditionally
lived near the forests have been
replaced by new dwellers who
frequently engage in wildlife
poaching and illegal timber
harvesting, he said.
Over the next six years, the
World Bank and other Western
aid agencies will pour $40 mil
lion into a program to revitalize
Uganda's forestry department.
"Despite our poverty, our gov
ernment has put its foot down
and decided environmental is
sues have to be taken into ac
count in whatever development
project is proposed,"
Kamugasha said.
Kamugasha met with Bruce
Wilcox, director of the Center of
Conservation Biology, and two

other University researchers to
discuss ways to apply modern
scientific knowledge to the
country's natural resource
crisis.
"In the past, most of our
politicians were interested in
conspicuous development,"
Kamugasha said. "We as con
servationists think some of the
investment from multination
als has been adverse to our in
terests ... It can bring us mil
lions of dollars initially, but
what happens to our resource
base after that?"
"There is hardly any wildlife
left in some countries," he said.
"That's why we are starting
from the beginning, trying to
ensure that management of our
natural resources follows the
right direction."
