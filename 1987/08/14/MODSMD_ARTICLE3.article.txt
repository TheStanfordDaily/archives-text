# Research facility criticism addressed
## 
### SUSAN SLUSSER Editorial staff 
Stanford sent a 28-page docu
ment Wednesday to the Santa
Clara County Board of Super
visors in response to questions
raised by the Palo Alto Humane
Society regarding the Univer
sity's proposed Research
Animal Facility 11.
The University hopes the let
ter will convince the city that
University plans for the facility
are satisfactory and follow na
tional guidelines for humane
animal care, according to Uni
versity officials.
On May 7, the Santa Clara
County Planning Commission
unanimously approved a use
permit for construction of the
proposed animal research facil
ity on campus. But after an ap
peal by the humane society, the
supervisors voted July 28 to
delay a decision that would
grant Stanford a land-use per
mit for the building.
The board asked for a review
of the issues and requested that
the humane society prepare a
list of the questions about the
proposed facility. The list was
delivered to Stanford on Aug. 5,
and the University finished pre
paring its response Tuesday.
In a Wednesday cover letter
to the board, University Presi
dent Donald Kennedy said, "We
believe that the record now

before the board fully supports
affirming the planning commis-,
sion's unanimous approval of
the use permit."
Kennedy also wrote that the
University hopes the land-use
permit will be approved at the
board's meeting Tuesday. The
hearing is set for 1:30 p.m.
The document answers all 29
questions set forth by the
humane society. "We hope
people will read this and get ed
ucated on the subject," said Dr.
Thomas Hamm, University di
rector of animal laboratory
medicine. "I think it answers
the questions very adequately."
The package addressed many
of the society's concerns in great
detail. Some of the majors is
sues include:
•The possibility of biohazar
dous research being conducted
at the facility. According to the
report, "The small amount of
biohazardous research we con
duct at Stanford takes place
only in facilities designed with
special containment systems to
ensure safety. . . . No biohazar
dous research will be conducted
in RAF 11, nor will animals
posing a health threat to
humans and other animals as a
result of biohazardous research
be housed in RAF II."
•Animal welfare. "We meet
— and in many cases exceed. —.
