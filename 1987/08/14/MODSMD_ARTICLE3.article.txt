# Research facility criticism addressed
## 
### SUSAN SLUSSER Editorial staff 
Stanford sent a 28-page docu
ment Wednesday to the Santa
Clara County Board of Super
visors in response to questions
raised by the Palo Alto Humane
Society regarding the Univer
sity's proposed Research
Animal Facility 11.
The University hopes the let
ter will convince the city that
University plans for the facility
are satisfactory and follow na
tional guidelines for humane
animal care, according to Uni
versity officials.
On May 7, the Santa Clara
County Planning Commission
unanimously approved a use
permit for construction of the
proposed animal research facil
ity on campus. But after an ap
peal by the humane society, the
supervisors voted July 28 to
delay a decision that would
grant Stanford a land-use per
mit for the building.
The board asked for a review
of the issues and requested that
the humane society prepare a
list of the questions about the
proposed facility. The list was
delivered to Stanford on Aug. 5,
and the University finished pre
paring its response Tuesday.
In a Wednesday cover letter
to the board, University Presi
dent Donald Kennedy said, "We
believe that the record now

before the board fully supports
affirming the planning commis-,
sion's unanimous approval of
the use permit."
Kennedy also wrote that the
University hopes the land-use
permit will be approved at the
board's meeting Tuesday. The
hearing is set for 1:30 p.m.
The document answers all 29
questions set forth by the
humane society. "We hope
people will read this and get ed
ucated on the subject," said Dr.
Thomas Hamm, University di
rector of animal laboratory
medicine. "I think it answers
the questions very adequately."
The package addressed many
of the society's concerns in great
detail. Some of the majors is
sues include:
•The possibility of biohazar
dous research being conducted
at the facility. According to the
report, "The small amount of
biohazardous research we con
duct at Stanford takes place
only in facilities designed with
special containment systems to
ensure safety. . . . No biohazar
dous research will be conducted
in RAF 11, nor will animals
posing a health threat to
humans and other animals as a
result of biohazardous research
be housed in RAF II."
•Animal welfare. "We meet
— and in many cases exceed. —.
all existing applicable state and
federal animal welfare laws and
regulations," the report reads.
•Charges that new U.S. Food
and Drug Administration regu
lations may force costly altera
tions to the building. According
to the report, "We have every
reason to believe that our new
facility will be in full compli
ance with the new USDA regu
lations. . . . But even if some
changes are required, Stanford
will make them in a timely
manner. The design of RAF II
will permit any modifications
we think may be required."
•The proposal put forth hy
Supervisor Susanne Wilson
that the University place a
member of the humane society
in its 12-member Animal Use
and Care Committee. According
to the report,"We do not permit
any outside group to select
members to any of Stanford
University's committees or ad
ministrative panels. . . . We be
lieve that Stanford's panel is
well represented by public
members with a history of dem
onstrated commitment to the
animal welfare."

The University addressed
numerous other concerns, many
of which "were not germane to
land use issues," according to
Assoc. Vice President of Public
Affairs Larry Horton.
Many of these questions
related to the "much-publicized
public controversy over medical
research using animals," Ken
nedy wrote in his three-page
letter.
Kennedy addressed the issues
of USDA regulations and ap
pointing a humane society
member to the Animal Care
and Use Committee. "No date
for the issuance of final regula
tions has been set by the
USDA," Kennedy wrote. "As a
former commissioner of the
Food and Drug Administration,
I know that complex regula
tions can take years to finalize.
"We will be legally required
to comply with the new regula
tions whenever they are issued.
There is therefore no reason to
delay the use permit and the
construction of the building."
With regard to appointing a
humane society member to the
University committee, Ken
nedy said, "We believe such a
condition exceeds the board's
normal purview for issuing a
use permit for the construction
of a building.
"We already include on our

panel three public members —
not just one as required by law
— to represent the concerns of
the general community on the
humane care and treatment of
laboratory animals."
Palo Alto Humane Society
President Helen McClosky said,
"A lot of it is double-speak.
Some of the stuff I have real
problems with."
The humane society has not
had a chance to go over the Uni
versity's reponse but will dis
cuss the document today, she
said.
"What possible humane
reasons are there to house re
search animals in the old
facilities?" Horton asked.
"We're building a better and
more modern facility. It's obvi
ous the humane society is
delaying the facility. The ques
tion is why."
"It certainly is strange," Ken
nedy said yesterday. "What it
tells you is that their agenda is
not the humane treatment of
animals, but stopping the use of
animals in biomedical re
search."
The proposed facility will
replace 22,400 net square feet of
aging facilities in various
places scattered around campus
with 27,300 net square feet that
will primarily house rats and
mice.
