# Profs, boycott SDI

### LIZ LEMPERT Staff writer 
More than 100 Stanford sci
entists have joined a national
movement against President
Reagan's Strategic Defense Ini
tiative, signing a pledge to
refuse SDI research funds.
According to local organizers
of the drive, 118 faculty and
staff have pledged not to "apply
for or accept support from the
Strategic Defense Institute" be
cause "the 'Star Wars' program
is technically dubious and poli
tically unwise."
"The program doesn't make
any sense," said Chemistry
Prof. Henry Taube yesterday.
"The present program has no

way of protecting against all
missiles, such as those coming
from submarines."
University scientists cite a
number of reasons for signing
the pledge in addition to SDl's
impracticality. Taube said that
SDI research is "not even
remotely related to the work I
do. I signed the pledge as a sym
bol of solidarity with other sci
entists."
Others have signed the
pledge as a matter of academic
principle. "SDI research is clas
sified research, and I don't
think the Unversity should be
doing clasified research," said
Chemistry Prof. William
Johnson.
"I signed the pledge for the
same reason I refused to do war
research around the time of
World War 11. Universities are
supposed to have a free ex
change of ideas," he said.
Other Stanford scientists,

such as Sydney Drell, deputy di
rector of the Stanford Linear
Accelerator Center, did not sign
the pledge. "I believe a prudent
research program is sensible,"
he said.
However, Drell said, "It's up
to every individual" whether to
work on SDI or not.
Approximately $25 million
worth of SDI research is in
progress at Stanford, according
to report compiled by Scott

Bohning of Stanford Action for
Nuclear Disarmament.
Electrical Engineering Prof.
Lambertus Hesselink is one
University scientist receiving
SDI funds. Hesselink is cur
rently researching sensors in
electromagnetic fields. His
work is supported by the Na
tional Science Foundation as
well as the SDI Office. The
grant from SDI totals "under
$200,000 a year," he said.

Electrical Engineering Prof.
Gene Franklin specializes in
feedback control. His research
entails "how to make a com
puter fly an airplane," he said.
"SDI will involve lots of com
puters, both in sensing incom
ing missiles and in guiding
weapons to destroy them,"
Franklin explained.
His research, along with that
of Hesselink and all other Stan
ford faculty members, is unclas

sified. "It's a clasic control prob
lem they're interested in seeing
if we can solve. And they're pro
viding us with the money,"
Franklin said.
A group of Stanford students,
including anthropology
graduate student Hugh Guster
son, is currently working on a
video documentary about SDI
research at the University.
Gusterson expects the film to
come out in the winter.
