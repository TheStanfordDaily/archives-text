# Profs, boycott SDI

### LIZ LEMPERT Staff writer 
More than 100 Stanford sci
entists have joined a national
movement against President
Reagan's Strategic Defense Ini
tiative, signing a pledge to
refuse SDI research funds.
According to local organizers
of the drive, 118 faculty and
staff have pledged not to "apply
for or accept support from the
Strategic Defense Institute" be
cause "the 'Star Wars' program
is technically dubious and poli
tically unwise."
"The program doesn't make
any sense," said Chemistry
Prof. Henry Taube yesterday.
"The present program has no

way of protecting against all
missiles, such as those coming
from submarines."
University scientists cite a
number of reasons for signing
the pledge in addition to SDl's
impracticality. Taube said that
SDI research is "not even
remotely related to the work I
do. I signed the pledge as a sym
bol of solidarity with other sci
entists."
Others have signed the
pledge as a matter of academic
principle. "SDI research is clas
sified research, and I don't
think the Unversity should be
doing clasified research," said
