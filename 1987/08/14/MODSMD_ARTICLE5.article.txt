# New software teaches drama by computer

Students here and across the country
may soon find their Shakespeare and
drama courses entering the computer
age, thanks to a new program by Stan
ford English Prof. Larry Friedlander.
Friedlander's program, announced
Tuesday at a Mac World conference in
Boston, is designed to let college stu
dents study theater interactively using
the scripts, critical notes on production
and interpretation and video produc
tions of the works.
"The intention is to give people an in
sight into the theater: how it is made,
how to watch theater," Friedlander said.
Friedlander also has created a pro
gram called Theatre Game, which helps
students work on blocking — the posi

and movements of actors or other ele
ments on stage.
The new program, which has yet to be
named, takes the process several steps
further, allowing users to examine a
script or make notes on it while simulta
neously watching the animated produc
tion on another screen.
Script, notes, study aids and the
animated display can progress together,
so that users can stop, edit, make or read
notes, or modify the blocking at any mo
ment and have all the modifications
remain together as a unit, Friedlander
explained.
"It's discovery space, where you can do
many different kinds of things with a
performance," Friedlander said.
"People will have choices of how to
spend their time in this program," he
said, noting that in addition to tradi
tional text-based theater such as Shake

speare, the new program will work with
modern theater, which often works with
images rather than text.
Users will also be able to look at ac
tors' intentions and listen to interior
monologues — the unspoken thoughts of
the actors — with the program,
Friedlander said.
"Given different databases, you can
get different configurations," he added.
Different versions of a production will
also be available in the database, so that
students can switch from one version to
the next while remaining at the same
point in time within the production, he
said.
The technology behind Friedlander's
program is a new software product by
Apple Computer called the HyperCard,
which was also introduced this week.
HyperCard, which runs on the Macin
tosh Plus and requires one megabyte of

memory, allows users to create and cus
tomize their own programs and informa
tion using simple commands.
Yolanda Davis of Apple's public rela
tions office described the hypercard as "a
personal tool kit."
"It lets you take your own information
and organize it in a way that makes
sense to you," she said. For example, a
patron of the arts might use the Hyper-
Card program to catalog names, ad
dresses, telephone numbers and other
information onto "file cards" onto the
computer. The cards could be categorized
ihto topics such as ballet, theater and
opera, but also could be retrieved alpha
betically or individually.
"It's very, very fast," Davis said. "You
can throw away your Rolodex." .
The HyperCard software could also
