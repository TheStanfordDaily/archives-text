# New software teaches drama by computer
## 
### JAMES LIN Staff writer 
Students here and across the country
may soon find their Shakespeare and
drama courses entering the computer
age, thanks to a new program by Stan
ford English Prof. Larry Friedlander.
Friedlander's program, announced
Tuesday at a Mac World conference in
Boston, is designed to let college stu
dents study theater interactively using
the scripts, critical notes on production
and interpretation and video produc
tions of the works.
"The intention is to give people an in
sight into the theater: how it is made,
how to watch theater," Friedlander said.
Friedlander also has created a pro
gram called Theatre Game, which helps
students work on blocking — the posi

and movements of actors or other ele
ments on stage.
The new program, which has yet to be
named, takes the process several steps
further, allowing users to examine a
script or make notes on it while simulta
neously watching the animated produc
tion on another screen.
Script, notes, study aids and the
animated display can progress together,
so that users can stop, edit, make or read
notes, or modify the blocking at any mo
ment and have all the modifications
remain together as a unit, Friedlander
explained.
"It's discovery space, where you can do
many different kinds of things with a
performance," Friedlander said.
"People will have choices of how to
spend their time in this program," he
said, noting that in addition to tradi
tional text-based theater such as Shake

speare, the new program will work with
modern theater, which often works with
images rather than text.
Users will also be able to look at ac
tors' intentions and listen to interior
monologues — the unspoken thoughts of
the actors — with the program,
Friedlander said.
"Given different databases, you can
get different configurations," he added.
Different versions of a production will
also be available in the database, so that
students can switch from one version to
the next while remaining at the same
point in time within the production, he
said.
The technology behind Friedlander's
program is a new software product by
Apple Computer called the HyperCard,
which was also introduced this week.
HyperCard, which runs on the Macin
tosh Plus and requires one megabyte of

memory, allows users to create and cus
tomize their own programs and informa
tion using simple commands.
Yolanda Davis of Apple's public rela
tions office described the hypercard as "a
personal tool kit."
"It lets you take your own information
and organize it in a way that makes
sense to you," she said. For example, a
patron of the arts might use the Hyper-
Card program to catalog names, ad
dresses, telephone numbers and other
information onto "file cards" onto the
computer. The cards could be categorized
ihto topics such as ballet, theater and
opera, but also could be retrieved alpha
betically or individually.
"It's very, very fast," Davis said. "You
can throw away your Rolodex." .
The HyperCard software could also
dial telephone numbers from
the file cards. And graphics,
music, voice and video could
also be entered as data on the
cards, she said.
Friedlander's program uses a
database stored on a video disc
to hold the scripts, notes and
video information. Users of the
program retrieve and or
chestrate the information from
these disks using the Macintosh
and its mouse.
Friedlander said the new

software is valuable. "Hyper
card makes things go much
more quickly and is much less
expensive." He said he is
looking forward to the use of his
program as a prototype for ap
plications in other disciplines.
"I think that multimedia
techniques are going to be very
powerful in the classroom," he
said, noting the possibilities for
using video and animation in
the same way people use texts
today and for recording student
comments on such animation
with floppy disks for later com
ment and analysis.
Friedlander mentioned psy

chology and sociology as likely
disciplines for such uses, where
scenarios could be played out on
the computer screen and stu
dents would be able to freeze,
analyze and comment on the
situations presented.
"It's the beginning of an at
tempt to engage faculty in au
thoring applications of this
technology," he said. Fried
lander said he began work on
what he calls the Shakespeare
Project as a novice on the com
puter.
Although he worked closely
with Charles Kerns of Instruc
tion and Research Information

Systems during the primary
stages of the project,
Friedlander said the new pro
gramming "has basically been
my work," with some coopera
tion on the most difficult
aspects of the program.
Other universities, including
Harvard, Yale and Dartmouth,
have already expresssed inter
est in using the program as a
prototype for other applications,
he said.
While the project is not yet
entirely complete, Friedlander
said he hopes to introduce a
simplified version of his pro
gram to Stanford students in

the fall, perhaps using a small
group of students from English
173, which he teaches. He also
plans to integrate some use of
the program into his spring
courses in Shakespeare and in
Western Culture.
"We're hoping to finish the
program some time this year,"
he said.
The HyperCard is expected to
be available by the end of the
month, along with other related
software. Meanwhile, Fried
lander plans to travel to
theatrical archives in Paris to
continue research and further
development of the databases
for his program.
