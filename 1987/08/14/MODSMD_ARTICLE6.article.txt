Reagan to seek new aid for contras
NORTH PLATTE, Neb. — The Reagan administration
may seek new military aid for contras battling Nicaragua's
Sandinista regime even before a White House-backed offer
for a cease-fire between the two sides expires Sept. 30, a
senior administration official said yesterday.
The proposed aid request appeared to cloud prospects for
the White House peace plan, unveiled only two weeks ago by
President Reagan and House Speaker Jim Wright, D-Texas.
White House chief of staff Howard Baker Jr. asserted yes
terday that the plan remains on track and that no decision on
asking Congress to allot further contra funding has been
made.
Nevertheless, the early aid request was deemed "a very
real option" by one ranking official traveling with Reagan en
route to his ranch in California, although the president has
not "signed off' on the plan.
The money apparently would provide stop-gap support for
the rebels between Sept. 30, when current U.S. aid lapses,
and the Nov. 7 date for a cease-fire proposed by Central
American leaders in a preliminary peace accord reached last
week.
Without a strong contra force inside Nicaragua after Sept.
30, U.S. officials fear, President Daniel Ortega, the chief of
the Sandinista government in Nicaragua, will have no reason
to carry out the democratic reforms in his government that
are called for by Nov. 7 in the Central American's prelimi
nary accord.
Experts: AIDS threat is exaggerated
ATLANTA — AIDS is not spreading at the anticipated
rate among heterosexual Americans who do not use drugs,
and officials here at the Centers for Disease Control and else
where are generally agreed that they see no evidence the
disease will reach epidemic proportions, except among gays
and intravenous drug users.
As a consequence, there is a growing consensus among
leading medical scientists that the threat of AIDS to the
wider population, while serious, has been exaggerated.
Doctors who share in this new consensus base their conclu
sions on recent reviews of statistical data, which show far
fewer cases among American-born heterosexuals than earlier
epidemiological predictions suggested. Moreover, according
to the CDC, more careful study of widely publicized instances
of heterosexual transmission — such as those that reportedly
had occurred among new Army recruits — has found them to
be unreliable.
CDC studies show also that in areas such as California and
New York, where AIDS is epidemic among gays and drug
users, "very little crossover to the mainstream heterosexual
population has occurred," said Dr. Harold W. Jaffe, the
centers' chief of AIDS epidemiology.
Author held in theft of rare letters
WASHINGTON — A Washington artist and author was
arrested by FBI agents at a Boston bookstore yesterday after
he tried to sell rare letters written by Abraham Lincoln, Win
ston Churchill and others apparently stolen from the Na
tional Archives, federal law enforcement officials said.
Charles Merrill Mount, 59-year-old art historian who had
published three works on famed artists in the 1950s and
1960s but then fell on hard times, according to friends, was
charged with interstate transportation of stolen property, au
thorities said.
The federal complaint alleges that Mount took from Wash
ington to Boston nine letters written by the 19th century art
ist James Abbott McNeill Whistler, most noted for the
portrait of his mother, that were discovered missing from the
Library of Congress, and three Civil War era letters written
or signed by Abraham Lincoln that were missing from the
National Archives, according to James F. Ahearn, special
FBI agent in charge of the Boston office.
Plans set to open Titanic safe on TV
A spokesman for a controversial French-based expedition
to the wreck of the Titanic announced plans in Paris yester
day to raise one of the historic liner's fabled safes and open it
Oct. 28 on a worldwide television spectacular from Monte
Carlo.
At the same time, from New York, the expedition chairman
disclosed that he will go on the offensive with an Aug. 25
news conference in the United States in an effort to beat back
international criticism of the expedition goals.
The spokesman, Daniel Puget of Taurus International,
technical consultants for the $2.5 million salvage effort, told
reporters in Paris that the expedition's small submarine lo
cated the safe in the debris field surrounding the broken liner
at the wreck site 350 miles southwest of Newfoundland. He
said they planned to raise it in several days, but will wait un
til the October television event to discover whether it holds
the millions in jewels legend says went down with the ship,
or, as historians believe, is empty.
