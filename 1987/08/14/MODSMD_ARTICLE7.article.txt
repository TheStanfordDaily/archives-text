Night at Co well
Cowell Student Health Center's services are cut back
during the summer. This information is important to know,
as became clear recently when one of our staff was taken ill
during a production night.
The infirmary is closed for the summer and there is no one
to take calls after hours. Nighttime callers will hear a record
ing advising them to dial the Palo Alto Medical Clinic if the
situation is urgent. Once the students reach that operator,
they can explain the situation and be referred immediately to
an on-call doctor.
This means it makes more sense to call the PAMC directly
at 321-4121 when faced with an after-hours emergency;
simple information, but important when dealing with a situ
ation in which minutes can make a difference.
Regular outpatient health care is still available from 9
a.m. to 12 p.m. and from 1:30 p.m. to 5 p.m. on weekdays.
Cowell is not expected to provide round-the-clock care that it
does during the school year, administrators say, because
there are significantly fewer students on campus.
Cowell hasn't done an adequate job notifying the public of
these altered services — but it's important that people know.
If Cowell is to ensure effective health care for the students,
the center should start by letting them in on the game plan.
If a mistake causes an injury, that's understandable. If the
injury is not treated as effectively and quickly as possible,
then changes must be made.
Fix Palm Drive
Something is amiss at Stanford, the land of perpetual con
struction work. Shiny new parking structures are popping
up, Campus Drive is forever under repair and Welch Road
recently got a new facelift.
Yet before visitors or new students have a chance to appre
ciate all this spiffy progress, most have already gotten a rude
welcome to the Unversity — they've had to drive on the
shoddy, potholed, humpbacked street that is supposedly a
Stanford scenic wonder.
Let's face it, Palm Drive is an embarassment. It is full of
holes, the right lanes slope so sharply away from center that
passengers complain of vertigo and the asphalt has decayed
to the point that the outer edges are jagged rubble.
Those drivers who make the mistake of choosing the outer
lanes are often forced to crowd the cars in the inner lanes,
and there is little room for bicyclists along the edge of the
street.
All hyperbole aside, Palm Drive is the most unpleasant
street on campus to drive on, and the road surface has been
allowed to deteriorate until it is now unsafe in many places.
If the University can afford to resurface little-used Welch
Road, it surely can pay to make some long-overdue improve
ments on its most well-known avenue.
The trip up Palm Drive is the first impression many
visitors and new students get of Stanford. They should at
least be able to travel on a smooth and level street.
