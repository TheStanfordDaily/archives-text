# The 						competing currents of constitutional thought
## 
### 
The confirmation proceedings this fall for
Appeals Court Judge Robert Bork promise
to be quite a show. Presidential would-be
Joseph Biden, who sometimes doubles as a
senator from Delaware and chair of the
Senate Judiciary Committee, has sounded
the battle cry against him. Bork, he insists,
cannot be allowed to tilt the balance of the
Supreme Court any further to the right.

Biden's task is complicated by Bork's
credentials, which, as we've all heard,
match or surpass those of any nominee in
recent memory. This has forced Biden to
adopt a controversial stand: that the Sen
ate's constitutional role in such a matter,
"to advise and consent," should be ex
panded beyond traditional concerns of com
petence, judicial temperament and profes
sional ethics to include the likely impact of
a nominee on the court's ideological
makeup.
So the confirmation is expected to be
fought on ideological grounds. This pro
vides a unique opportunity, on the bicen
tennial of the Constitution, to expose the
public to the competing currents of consti
tutional thought.

The spectrum in this debate is bounded
by two broadly defined camps: inter
pretivists (constitutional conservatives), on
the one hand, and activists (constitutional
liberals) on the other.
Activists approach the Constitution as a
document that explicitly recognizes certain
rights while implying the existence of
many others. This requires members of the
Supreme Court to enumerate fundamental
and lesser rights that are not stated in the
Constitution. These rights are explained as
corresponding to one or more abstract con
stitutional notions — ordered liberty, social
justice, moral conscience, etc.
Such an open-ended reading of the Con
stitution lends itself to a variety of judicial
interpretations. Collective moral sen
sibility tends to take the place of constitu
tional principle, and the Supreme Court
transforms itself into a legislative body of
prodigious power.
Conversely, interpretivists hesitate to ex
tend their rulings beyond the intended or
plausible scope of the Constitution. They
recognize that the Constitution is a na
tional charter of limited aims, leaving
many matters outside the jurisdiction of the
Supreme Court. Interpretivists restrain
themselves from the temptation to brand
bad public policy (that is, public policy with
which they disagree) unconstitutional.
They acknowledge that the Constitution
tolerates much that the nine members of
the Supreme Court might consider immoral
or unfair.

The significance of these opposed judicial
philosophies is well illustrated by the
Court's 1973 ruling on abortion, Roe v.
Wade. It is the premier example of judicial
activism. The Supreme Court ruled that a
woman has a right to an abortion (subject to
certain limitations) by virtue of the right to
privacy implied in a number of the Consti
tution's provisions.
From an interpretivist's point of view,
Roe v. Wade is an unambiguous fabrication
of constitutional rights to suit the needs of
the moment. The Supreme Court did little
more than act as a willful superlegislature,
overruling the varied abortion laws of 50
states in one fell swoop only to impose its
own extraconstitutional preferences. Roe v.
Wade presents a bold invitation to judicial
excess.
Circumstance has placed the upcoming
confirmation hearings at the heart of a
long-standing constitutional dispute. Cast
as it is in ideological terms, Bork's confir
mation will be an opportunity for an artic
ulate interpretivist to make his case, in
self-defense, for discontinuing the activist
trend. The likely implications for future
rulings should be made clear by his tes
timony.
Bork's confirmation would signal the end
of a period marked by a lack of judicial
restraint. Whether this alone will be con
sidered sufficient grounds to disallow him
remains to be seen.
