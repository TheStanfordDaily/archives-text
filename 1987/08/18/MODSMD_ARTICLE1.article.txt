# Conference profits top $4 million

In financial terms, Stanford
enjoyed "perhaps its most suc
cessful" summer hosting
academically related confer
ences on campus, according to
Lois Fariello, University con
ference manager.
"We expect to gross about $4
million," said Fariello. "And
that's for housing and food only
â€” not even counting tuition."
According to Fariello, the net
income from the conference
schedule will go back into the
housing and food services
budget to "keep costs of room
and board (in University
residences) down for Stanford
students."
This summer's conferences
have bought people here from
all parts of the United States
and from as far away as Europe,
Africa, Asia and South
America. They came "for stays
of anywhere from one night to
11 weeks," said Fariello.
The most well-represented
groups are those attending con
ferences hosted by the Graduate
School of Business, the Athle
tics Department, the Alumni
Association and the Engineer
ing Department, according to
Fariello. "However, the Medical
School isn't too far behind," she
said.
Fariello attributed the over
all success of the programs to
good relationships between the
conference office and Univer
sity departments. "The depart
ments are very helpful in (the
process of) bringing programs to
Stanford," said Fariello, adding
that "of course the Provost and
the President's Office are very
supportive."
Stanford hosts a wide variety
of conferences, ranging from the
cheerleading camps hosted by
the Athletics Department to the
International Association of Re
ligious Freedom's conference on
religious and social issues.
Each program must be
academically related, Fariello
said, and the conference office
"more or less decides which
groups may come."
The conferences "are a good
source of income," Fariello said.
"They also keep people
employed during the summer,
such as housing and food ser
vice workers who would be
without jobs. Many students
would also lose job opportuni
ties."
However, the major reason
for the conferences is "to bring
people from all over the world to
share research and knowledge,"
said Fariello, citing this
month's conference on sto
chastic processes sponsored by
the Engineering Department.
Another major reason is to
provide educational opportuni
ties. "Upward Bound is a tutor
ing program that provides edu
cational opportunities to stu
dents from schools that don't
provide upper level classes such
as chemistry or physics,"
Fariello said.
Bringing a large number of
varying groups to Stanford in
such a short time span is not
without its difficulties. One of
the greatest, according to
Fariello, js "trying to turn a
University residence and food
service into a hotel. Many of the
older visitors aren't always easy
to please, as they are not used to
University facilities."
