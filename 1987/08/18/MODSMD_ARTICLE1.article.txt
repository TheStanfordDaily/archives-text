In financial terms, Stanford
enjoyed "perhaps its most suc
cessful" summer hosting
academically related confer
ences on campus, according to
Lois Fariello, University con
ference manager.
"We expect to gross about $4
million," said Fariello. "And
that's for housing and food only
â€” not even counting tuition."
According to Fariello, the net
income from the conference
schedule will go back into the
housing and food services
budget to "keep costs of room
and board (in University
residences) down for Stanford
students."
This summer's conferences
have bought people here from
all parts of the United States
and from as far away as Europe,
Africa, Asia and South
America. They came "for stays
of anywhere from one night to
11 weeks," said Fariello.
The most well-represented
groups are those attending con
ferences hosted by the Graduate
School of Business, the Athle
tics Department, the Alumni
Association and the Engineer
ing Department, according to
Fariello. "However, the Medical
School isn't too far behind," she
said.
Fariello attributed the over
all success of the programs to
good relationships between the
conference office and Univer
sity departments. "The depart
ments are very helpful in (the
process of) bringing programs to
Stanford," said Fariello, adding
that "of course the Provost and
the President's Office are very
supportive."
Stanford hosts a wide variety
of conferences, ranging from the
cheerleading camps hosted by
the Athletics Department to the
International Association of Re
ligious Freedom's conference on
religious and social issues.
