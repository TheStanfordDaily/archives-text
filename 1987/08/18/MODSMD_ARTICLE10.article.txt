# Tom Heller and the Overseas Studies Renaissance
## 
### 
There is a specter haunting Stanford-in-
Europe — the specter of Thomas Heller.
The Hellerian Manifesto has taken root
at Overseas Studies. After spending his
first two years at the helm in continuous
ideological warfare, the law professor can
finally point to material progress in re
structuring Stanford's overseas programs.
The Aug. 11 Daily reported Heller's good
news: The Kyoto campus in Japan will open
on schedule in the fall of 1988, and centers
in Jerusalem, Buenos Aires and Costa Rica
are targeted for 1988-89.

And the ideas keep flowing. Director Hel
ler is taking aim at "other parts of Asia as
well — maybe Korea or mainland China."
Heller's best news may be what wasn't re
ported. No mention of the closing of the
Vienna campus, Heller's personal bane.
Also telling were the descriptions of the
Stanford Center for Technology and Inno
vation, the key to Kyoto, and the Center for
Latin American Studies, the banner for
Buenos Aires. The former will focus on en
gineering, business, law and humanities
and sciences in contemporary Japan; the
latter, issues of Third World development.

Heller's theory becomes reality.
Heller's critics twist his theory, charging
that the "Overseas Studies Center" has now
become "The Center for the Study of Amer
ican Economics in its Transplanted Varie
ties," or perhaps "The Imperialist Studies
Center." (Stands that other manifesto on its
head, doesn't it?)
However, the critics, mostly European
traditionalists among the humanities fac
ulty who fall into apoplexy at the mention
of "business," "technology," "culture" and
"academics" in the same breath, have him
all wrong. Unfortunately, the misun
derstandings are his own fault.
Tom Heller remains a campus enigma.
The problem with Heller is not one of ideas,
substance or creativity. Rather, what dogs
him is packaging, timing and salesman
ship.
I first heard Heller at a seminar for the
Krupp Internship Program held last March
in Essen, West Germany, purportedly to air
student views on the Krupp experience and
get feedback from the German corporate
sponsors of the program.
Heller dominated the table with a bewil
dering, elevated polysyllabic defense of his
agenda. It was supposed to impress the Ger
mans and the interns, but in fact tuned
them out. No one could figure out exactly
what he said about "transnationalism" and
"technology transfer" and"the shifting
forms of social institutions."
Another Hellerism, on rapidly changing
Florence: "Italy lives concretely in the pres

ence of its myriad myths and monuments,
struggling to accommodate the preserva
tion of its artisanal economic and regional
political institutions to a society with ele
ments on the edge of the global technologi
cal and artistic avant garde." OK, Tom,
agreed. But speak the language.
Heller's biggest botch was the handling
of the Vienna closure. We never knew
whether it was a "Vienna-for-Kyoto" trade,
or mere coincidence that the two happened
at the same time. Heller should have
stepped in immediately to give a full ac
counting for the reasoning behind the deci
sion. It would have been painful to some but
it became rancorous to all after hearing
contradictory reports from the Overseas,
Humanities and Vienna offices.
He's rubbed us the wrong way at times,
but Heller's ideas remain exciting and pro
gressive.
Heller's overseas vision parallels the
Western Culture reforms and the new em
phasis on interdisciplinary, self-designed
education. Engineers in Japan and Hum
Bio majors in Argentina? Study centers in
Moscow and Jerusalem linked to Interna
tional Relations? Integrating overseas
study with honors theses and coursework at
the home campus? Incredible. Unheard of.
We need this man. Give him his due. He's
turning a mediocre, exclusive part of Stan
ford into a rewarding, accessible educa
tional experience.
