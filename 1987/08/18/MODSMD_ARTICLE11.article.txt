SDI article found
to be misleading
4
The Daily's Aug. 11 article
on SDI research at Stanford
was extremely misleading. The
article states that "more than
10 Stanford scientists" inter
viewed — for some reason they
are never identified — are not
involved with the national
movement to refuse SDI re
search funds, and "they don't
know anyone here who is."
I have news-for The Daily
and those more than 10 scien
tists: At Stanford, 118 faculty
and staff have signed the na
tional pledgd to refuse SDI
research funds. They include
such distinguished figures as
Henry Taub (Nobel Prize win
ner in Chemistry), William
Johnson (winner of a National
Medal of Science for his work
in Chemistry) and Terry
Winograd (one of the leading
computer scientists in the
country).
Seventy-six students have
signed the same pledge and,
according to a recent article in
the San Jose Mercury News, 27

of the 50 senior staff and fac
ulty at SLAC have also signed.
The article then states that
SDI research at Stanford "is
difficult to pinpoint because
SDI has not established its own
funding agency." Wrong! SDI
research all over the country is
funded by a government fund
ing agency called the SDI Of
fice, which is currently funding
Prof. Joseph Goodman
(Electrical Engineering) to
research optical computing.
It is true that much SDI re
search is also funded by the
Army, Navy and Air Force, but
it is not difficult to pinpoint
this research. If you go to the
Sponsored Projects Office on
campus, they will tell you
names of professors who are
funded by the Pentagon to do
SDI research.
There is currently $25 mil
lion worth of SDI research in
progress at Stanford. There is
also a significant movement
opposing that research. That is
an important news story, and
The Daily missed it. Worse
still, The Daily seriously mis
represented the situation to the
campus community.
I am one person in a group of

students currently working on
a video documentary about SDI
research at Stanford. This is an
important issue for the Univer
sity community, and I urge
everyone to see the film when
it comes out in the winter. I
hope staff members of The
Daily will be among the first to
watch it.

Meyer restrictions
are unfortunate
My heart is sick. I came to
Meyer Library today to poke
about, look at some books and
spend a nice day doing nothing
of any importance. The guy
asked me for my ID. I am 16
years old! I can't enroll here.
All I want to do is look
through the library's fine col
lection of books. I have never
put any pressure on its space
and services.
But you have made this
regretful decision. How sad.
