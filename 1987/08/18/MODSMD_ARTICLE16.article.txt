## Those interviewed say they haven't 'sold out' Graduates of '70 revisit their college values 
### LIZ LEMPERT Staff writer 
On June 7, 1970, The New York Times
published an article about the college
class of 1970. The Stanford students
quoted in the article were tracked down
for the following story.
The year was 1970. War raged in Viet
nam as protestors clashed with police on
the homefront. For the graduating class,
the motto was "Don't sell out," and 17
years later, that ideology still runs
strong.
Representing the sentiments of many
of his classmates today, Roger Boesche
(Class of'7o, political science) said, "Not
to say I haven't changed, but all in all,
the core set of ideas |I held in 1970] are,
with some certain modifications, still in
tact."
In 1970, Boesche told The New York
Times: "I'm really resentful that so
many institutions are so harmful to the
things I value — my friends, my freedom
and my life itself — that I can't find a
place in them. I don't fit in."
Today Boesche is a professor of politi
cal science at Occidental College in
Southern California, and has just pub
lished his second book, an analysis of the
political philosophy of French author
Alexis DeToqueville.
"1 don't think I've changed much," he
said. "There are still many sources of

power in this country that are dangerous
to the things I value."
Today, Nancy Perry (Class of'7o, psy
chology) calls herself a "yuppie," but
maintains that her "values are not nec
essarily hypocritical."
"You can be comfortable and still
give," she explained. As a college senior
in 1970 however, she saw the world in a
slightly different light.
Perry, then Nancy Walker, told The
Times: "There's very little emphasis on
personal joys and pleasures. People look
down on that now, it seems so petty," she
said.
"It's interesting," Perry remarked re
garding her 1970 comments. "Then I was
talking about material joys, but now I
see many joys come from the giving of
yourself. Now, pleasure comes from
things that are intangible — like help
ing someone else grow and learn."
Earlier this decade, Perry spent five
years working with emotionally dis
turbed children and their families. She
is currently a professor of psychology at
Creighton University in Nebraska.
"Students today are more career ori
ented," she said. "They want to take
courses that will lead to monetary gain
and prestige.
"In the '70s there was a less self
serving attitude. I believe that I've
carried over that attitude and hopefully

have imparted it on my students, she
added.
In 1970, graduating senior Fred
Lonsdale, English, was heading for law
school. "[l'll] work in political cases,
defending the Black Panthers or people
in the movement for the Third World
community. You either work for the
people or for the oppressor," he told The
New York Times.

In 1970, graduating
senior Roger Boesche
resented that so many
institutions were hostile
to his values. Today he is
a college professor. I
don't think I've changed
much," he said.

In 1987, Lonsdale is still "plugging
away," representing labor unions as an
attorney for the law firm Davis, Cowell
and Bowe in San Francisco.
"There's still a lot of underlying dedi
cation to making this a more just soci
ety," he observed. "There may be a burn

out phenomenon, but there's certainly
not a wholesale embracing of the philos
ophy that we should become Republicans
and make as much money as we can.
"I'm still every bit as outraged about
Reagan giving money to the contras as I
was in 1970 about Nixon's bombing of
Cambodia and Vietnam," he added.
Rick Stewart (Class of'7o, psychology)
was drafted after graduation and went to
Vietnam. After two years of service,
Stewart returned home with an
honorary discharge and moved to Santa
Cruz.
In 1978, after several years of holding
janitorial, fast food and other odd jobs,
he bought a bike shop with two friends.
He is now sole owner and recently
opened another store. "I'm a capitalist,"
he now jokes.
"I don't want to sell out. I don't want to
take a nine to five job and escape with
the kids to the mountains on the
weekend," Stewart declared 17 years
ago.
Today he believes, "When you're
trying to find work and raise a family,
you've got to work within the system."
He added, however, that "of all the
people I keep in contact with, none
embraces the status quo."
"Life is good for me," said the Stewart
of 1987. While he hasn't "sold out," he
admitted he did just get back from a
weekend trip to Tahoe.
