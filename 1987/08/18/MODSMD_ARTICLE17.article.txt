# AIDS afflicts students, staff, faculty, alumni

Doctors, it would, seem, can take just about anything.
Their contact with sickness, disease and death is so fre
quent that they seem to develop almost an emotional
immunity to the condition of their patients — almost,
but not quite.

Dr. John Dorman, associate director of medicine at
Cowell Student Health Center, recently realized his
own emotional vulnerability. Last fall he learned that
one of his long-time patients — a Stanford graduate
student — had died of AIDS the previous spring.
"I have had many patients die," Dorman said in a
recent Cowell publication, "but one of the characteris
tics of student health is that the patients hardly ever
die. Since Ralph looked so well when I last saw him, I'm
not sure that I ever really believed, on an emotional
level, that he had AIDS until I learned that he was
dead."
Ralph — not his real name — came to Dorman at
Cowell one fall a couple of years ago with an abdominal
pain. After some routine tests — an appendicitis check,
for example — Ralph's abdominal pain was finally at
tributed to AIDS, a syndrome that attacks the body's
ability to fight off illness. But even after uncovering
the problem, Dorman never fully accepted that Ralph
would be powerless against the fatal disease.
Not too long after the diagnosis, Ralph graduated
and then lost his job when the news of his disease
leaked out. At Ralph's request, Dorman referred his
case to a San Francisco physician who specializes in
treating AIDS patients. Dorman retained hope. But in
the spring of 1986, Ralph died.
"Perhaps the scariest part is that someone so young
and apparently healthy can have a fatal disease that
kills so fast," Dorman said.
Ralph was one of a small group from the Stanford
community that has contracted AIDS.
In a San Jose Mercury News article in May of 1986,
Jim Lyons, dean of Student Affairs, said that there

have been 11 reported cases of the disease among stu
dents, faculty and staff. This number — presumably
higher now — is very difficult to calculate because
those who do contract AIDS often return to their homes
and families without alerting the University. In most
cases University officials are reluctant even to spec
ulate about the number of cases for fear of creating un
necessary panic in others.
Of the small number of known cases, only one has
been publicized.
Last March, English Prof. Donald Howard fell victim
to the disease. Howard was the first Stanford professor
whose death has been publicly attributed to AIDS. Ac
cording to Bob Beyers of Stanford's News and Publica
tions, where the official University obituaries are writ
ten, "There have been other AIDS deaths among fac
ulty, but we heard of them only indirectly and after the
fact." Howard's survivors and friends were open, like
he was, about his disease.
According to University officials, who chose not to be
named, at least one staff member has died of AIDS.
To date, there has been no student who has gone on
record as having AIDS or as being tested positive with
the AIDS virus. But anonymous cases, like Ralph's, are
known about anecdotally.
In December 1985, a Graduate School of Business
student died of AIDS. His name has never been
revealed, but his death was publicly cited as cause for
his close friends mobilizing to create "Stanford Cares,"
a weekend-long benefit in May of 1986 to raise money
for AIDS research at the Medical Center and other lo
cal research labs.
"I lost a very good friend after living through a very
ugly year," said Michael Smith, a 1986 GSB graduate
who watched his friend's battle against the disease. "I
felt a deep loss and tried to decide how to respond," he
said. Smith organized the weekend benefit.
At least five deaths among Stanford alumni have
been publicly attributed to AIDS, one of which was
cited in a recent Newsweek magazine cover story on
the disease. Jay Spears, a 1976 graduate of the Law
School, served as president of the Stanford Law
Review, and, right after graduating, clerked for U.S.
Supreme Court Justice Potter Stewart. When he died,
Spears was practicing law in San Francisco.
Howard was also included in the Newsweek article.
Some students' concern about the spread of AIDS has
led them to get a blood test. Cowell doesn't release sta
tistics on the number or results of blood tests they have

administered. One reason for this guarded policy, ac
cording to Doryn Chervin, director of the health promo
tion program and Cowell, is that the number of tests
Cowell has conducted is quite small compared to the
number of students who have been tested elsewhere.
Consequently, Chervin said, their statistics would be
"meaningless" and unhelpful in coming to any conclu
sions about the problem of AIDS at Stanford.
Dorman stresses the importance of keeping a careful
perspective on the disease. The number of known cases
among Stanford members, he noted, is quite small. 'I
think it's appropriate to be concerned. I think its inap
propriate to be panicked," he said.
As of Aug. 10, the nation's reported AIDS cases
reached a record 40,051, according to the Centers for
Disease Control in Atlanta. Of that number, 8,397 (21
percent) were reported from persons between the ages
of 20 and 29, the best breakdown they register for those
of college age. While the rate for this group to the over
all incidence of AIDS has been a steady ratio for years,
the growth of reported cases per month from this age
group has reached an unprecedented 312.
With the way AIDS has touched campus, one would
expect students to exhibit caution, but not panic, in
their intimate behavior. A recent Cowell survey,
however, suggests that this isn't necessarily the
response.
In Cowell's random sampling of the University's
13,000 students released this spring, 74 percent of
those who characterized themselves as sexually active
also admitted not discussing sexually transmitted
diseases with their partners before intercourse. The
poll also found that more than a quarter of the student
sampling did not know what constitutes "safe sex," and
many who thought they did also indicated as safe
practices things that medical experts don't.
Despite some of the ignorance, and in most cases be
cause of it, much at Stanford is being done to combat
the plague of AIDS. Students, staff and community
members have coalesced, to the displeasure of some, to
educate themselves and others about this deadly
disease. AIDS has touched the Stanford family and will
assuredly carve a deeper path.
In his eulogy at Donald Howard's memorial service,
English Prof. Ronald Rebholz said: "Like most of us,
(Howard) was at his best when he was loving and being
loved. It is a sad irony that he contracted this fatal
disease in just such a relationship."

of 20 and 29, the best breakdown they register for those
of college age. While the rate for this group to the over
all incidence of AIDS has been a steady ratio for years,
the growth of reported cases per month from this age
group has reached an unprecedented 312.
With the way AIDS has touched campus, one would
expect students to exhibit caution, but not panic, in
their intimate behavior. A recent Cowell survey,
however, suggests that this isn't necessarily the
response.
In Cowell's random sampling of the University's
13,000 students released this spring, 74 percent of
those who characterized themselves as sexually active
also admitted not discussing sexually transmitted
diseases with their partners before intercourse. The
poll also found that more than a quarter of the student
sampling did not know what constitutes "safe sex," and
many who thought they did also indicated as safe
practices things that medical experts don't.
Despite some of the ignorance, and in most cases be
cause of it, much at Stanford is being done to combat
the plague of AIDS. Students, staff and community
members have coalesced, to the displeasure of some, to
educate themselves and others about this deadly
disease. AIDS has touched the Stanford family and will
assuredly carve a deeper path.
In his eulogy at Donald Howard's memorial service,
English Prof. Ronald Rebholz said: "Like most of us,
(Howard) was at his best when he was loving and being
loved. It is a sad irony that he contracted this fatal
disease in just such a relationship."


MEDICAL REPORT:
AIDS AT STANFORD
Doctors, it would, seem, can take just about anything.
Their contact with sickness, disease and death is so fre
quent that they seem to develop almost an emotional
immunity to the condition of their patients — almost,
but not quite.

Dr. John Dorman, associate director of medicine at
Cowell Student Health Center, recently realized his
own emotional vulnerability. Last fall he learned that
one of his long-time patients — a Stanford graduate
student — had died of AIDS the previous spring.
"I have had many patients die," Dorman said in a
recent Cowell publication, "but one of the characteris
tics of student health is that the patients hardly ever
die. Since Ralph looked so well when I last saw him, I'm
not sure that I ever really believed, on an emotional
level, that he had AIDS until I learned that he was
dead."
Ralph — not his real name — came to Dorman at
Cowell one fall a couple of years ago with an abdominal
pain. After some routine tests — an appendicitis check,
for example — Ralph's abdominal pain was finally at
tributed to AIDS, a syndrome that attacks the body's
ability to fight off illness. But even after uncovering
the problem, Dorman never fully accepted that Ralph
would be powerless against the fatal disease.
Not too long after the diagnosis, Ralph graduated
and then lost his job when the news of his disease
leaked out. At Ralph's request, Dorman referred his
case to a San Francisco physician who specializes in
treating AIDS patients. Dorman retained hope. But in
the spring of 1986, Ralph died.
"Perhaps the scariest part is that someone so young
and apparently healthy can have a fatal disease that
kills so fast," Dorman said.
Ralph was one of a small group from the Stanford
community that has contracted AIDS.
In a San Jose Mercury News article in May of 1986,
Jim Lyons, dean of Student Affairs, said that there

have been 11 reported cases of the disease among stu
dents, faculty and staff. This number — presumably
higher now — is very difficult to calculate because
those who do contract AIDS often return to their homes
and families without alerting the University. In most
cases University officials are reluctant even to spec
ulate about the number of cases for fear of creating un
necessary panic in others.
Of the small number of known cases, only one has
been publicized.
Last March, English Prof. Donald Howard fell victim
to the disease. Howard was the first Stanford professor
whose death has been publicly attributed to AIDS. Ac
cording to Bob Beyers of Stanford's News and Publica
tions, where the official University obituaries are writ
ten, "There have been other AIDS deaths among fac
ulty, but we heard of them only indirectly and after the
fact." Howard's survivors and friends were open, like
he was, about his disease.
According to University officials, who chose not to be
named, at least one staff member has died of AIDS.
To date, there has been no student who has gone on
record as having AIDS or as being tested positive with
the AIDS virus. But anonymous cases, like Ralph's, are
known about anecdotally.
In December 1985, a Graduate School of Business
student died of AIDS. His name has never been
revealed, but his death was publicly cited as cause for
his close friends mobilizing to create "Stanford Cares,"
a weekend-long benefit in May of 1986 to raise money
for AIDS research at the Medical Center and other lo
cal research labs.
"I lost a very good friend after living through a very
ugly year," said Michael Smith, a 1986 GSB graduate
who watched his friend's battle against the disease. "I
felt a deep loss and tried to decide how to respond," he
said. Smith organized the weekend benefit.
At least five deaths among Stanford alumni have
been publicly attributed to AIDS, one of which was
cited in a recent Newsweek magazine cover story on
the disease. Jay Spears, a 1976 graduate of the Law
School, served as president of the Stanford Law
Review, and, right after graduating, clerked for U.S.
Supreme Court Justice Potter Stewart. When he died,
Spears was practicing law in San Francisco.
Howard was also included in the Newsweek article.
Some students' concern about the spread of AIDS has
led them to get a blood test. Cowell doesn't release sta
tistics on the number or results of blood tests they have

administered. One reason for this guarded policy, ac
cording to Doryn Chervin, director of the health promo
tion program and Cowell, is that the number of tests
Cowell has conducted is quite small compared to the
number of students who have been tested elsewhere.
Consequently, Chervin said, their statistics would be
"meaningless" and unhelpful in coming to any conclu
sions about the problem of AIDS at Stanford.
Dorman stresses the importance of keeping a careful
perspective on the disease. The number of known cases
among Stanford members, he noted, is quite small. 'I
think it's appropriate to be concerned. I think its inap
propriate to be panicked," he said.
As of Aug. 10, the nation's reported AIDS cases
reached a record 40,051, according to the Centers for
Disease Control in Atlanta. Of that number, 8,397 (21
percent) were reported from persons between the ages
of 20 and 29, the best breakdown they register for those
of college age. While the rate for this group to the over
all incidence of AIDS has been a steady ratio for years,
