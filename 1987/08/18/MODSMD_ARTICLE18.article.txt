## 'Butler' doesn't make the grade 
### DANIEL GRANT 
The major problem with the
Hillbarn Theater's production
of the sex farce "What the But
ler Saw" is it just isn't very
funny. This is unfortunate, be
cause Joe Orton's play — which
I've seen elsewhere — can be
quite hilarious when done
right.
The reason for the produc
tion's failure is the flat way the
cast delivers their lines. Sure,
some sight gags and straight
forward jokes got a few laughs.
But because the humor in Or
ton's play (as in many English

comedies) is often subtle or so
phisticated, different words
need to be stressed or spoken
slowly enough that an audience
can assimilate and appreciate
the humor.
In this production, many
funny moments went com
pletely over the heads of the au
dience simply because of flawed
delivery.
The outrageous and intricate
plot takes place in the office of
Dr. Prentice, and the play is so
full of mistaken identities, plot
twists, disappearances, dis
guises, seductions and dis
coveries that explaining the

plot at length would be impos
sibly confusing.
The basic story is this: Med
dling Dr. Ranee has made an
impromptu visit to Dr.
Prentice's office, and as a result
of the disguises and mistaken
identities, is convinced that
Prentice, his wife and a young
secretary are insane and should
be committed.
Hal O'Connell plays Dr.
Prentice far too straight, and he
looked frighteningly similiar to
the "Entertainment Tonight"
movie critic milktoast, Leonard
Maltin.
O'Connell's performance
defeats any realism the play
develops. The normalcy he
lends his character prevents the
audience from understanding
how anyone could misconstrue
his actions as being those of a
maniac.
It was also curious how
O'Connell's portrayal had the
doctor repeatedly take another
shot of brandy when the plot
took another twist.
It was amazing that after a
whole bottle of brandy Prentice
didn't act the least bit drunk.
The rest of the cast did an ad
equate job, with only Richard
Ryan turning in a first-rate per
formance as the pompous Dr.
Ranee.
The production does have its
funny moments that work, but
it isn't nearly as funny as it
should have been.
The Hillbarn Theater does
get an honorable mention,
though, for the complimentary
coffee, tea and goodies served at
intermission. It was a nice
touch to an otherwise slow eve
ning.


The cast of the British sex farce "What the Butler Saw" pays their
respects to the remains of Sir Winston Churchill. The play is cur
rently running at the Hillbarn Theater in Foster City.
