# Brazilian restaurant provides alternative

### JAMES R. DICKEY Editorial staff 
Off the 1900 block of Uni
versity Avenue, just west of
Highway 101, is an alley that
every Sunday turns into
"Pagode" — a Brazilian block
party.
The alley is outside of a
club called Pena Moai. The
dining and dancing club
sponsors the weekly event
that features a salsa group
known as the Brazilian All-
Stars.
Pena Moai is as much a
cultural center as a dinner
club.
Most of the customers
know each other well and the
staff is friendly and cordial.
The atmosphere is def
initely casual. The back half
of the alley is blocked off by
temporary fencing. Some
times there is an employee at
the entrance to collect the $5
cover charge, but usually
there isn't.
Customers are seated at
folding wooden chairs and
tables scattered loosely
around the courtyard that is
formed by the fencing, gener
ally facing the stage area.
The Brazilian All-Stars are
a local group, with a definite
ethnic flavor. Picture six
guys, one playing an acoustic
guitar and the other five
playing percussion instru
ments, and you get the idea.
Accordingly, the music is
quite rhythmic — and very

good.
The food is prepared with a
distinct cultural slant as
well.
I began dinner with an ap
petizer of Clam Ceviche ($4)
— a platter of clams mixed
with a large portion of sliced
onion and jalapeno and
topped with vinegar. The
dish was tangy and spicy, as
one would expect, but a little
overpowering.
The corn and lettuce
served with the ceviche did
little to dampen the taste,
but were nice touches.
For an entree, I selected
Feijoada — a plateful of dried
beef and pork in black beans
served with rice. It took a
little effort to get used to the
texture of the dried meats,
but the beans were perfectly
seasoned.
As a whole, the entree
wasn't bad at all.
For dessert, I chose the
Flan. A traditional latin des
sert, the pudding-style dish
was fine. The black tea that
accompanied the selection
was delicious and helped
complete the meal.
The food Pena Moai has to
offer is fine. However, I
would recommend the club
more for its friendly atmos
phere and salsa music than
for its dinner fare.
Pena Moai's block party is
Sundays from 4 p.m. to 8
p.m., but the band doesn't
even set up until about 4:30
p.m., so be fashionably late.
