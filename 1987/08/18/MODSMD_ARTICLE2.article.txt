# Row to get computers early in fall quarter
## 
### A.J. THOMAS Editorial staff 
Plans are progressing to install
clusters of personal computers on the
Row, although no terminals are expected
to be in place until early October, accord
ing to JefT Merriman, computer adminis
trator for the Office of Residential Edu
cation.
Clusters of Digital Equipment Corpo
ration Rainbow computers will be in
stalled in some Row houses by the "first
two or three weeks of fall quarter," Mer
riman said. "There won't be any move
ment until after October 1," he added.
Merriman said he looked at Cowell
Cluster and Row residences last week to
see what kind of facilities exist to house
the computers. "Were looking especially
hard at theme houses — the French

House, the Italian House — where there
are [resident fellows] who are willing to
take the reins of a project like that/' he
added.
The exact destinations of the comput
ers have not yet been selected, Mer
riman said, but the goal is to establish a
few central clusters that can be easily
reached by residents of other Row
houses.
Many of the DEC Rainbows will come
from dormitories that have recently ac
quired new IBM systems. "A lot of DEC
clusters are going to be freed up," Mer
riman predicted.
Res Ed has installed computer clusters
in most campus dorms but has been
unable to service the Row because of its
distance from the heart of campus and
because the individual Row
houses are too small to warrant
the large expenditures neces
sary, Merriman said.
But that expense will be
avoided by moving old Rain
bows from those residences that
will receive new IBMs to
residences on the Row.
The Rainbows will have word
processing capability but will
not be connected to LOTS be
cause Row houses are not part
of SUNet, the University's un
derground cable network, Mer
riman said.
In addition to carrying televi
sion channels, SUNet is used to
link computers to LOTS,
SOCRATES and other com
puter networks.
The University now has three
types of computer clusters on
campus: DEC Rainbows, IBMs
and Apple Macintoshes. There
are four Rainbow clusters, 14
IBM groups and three Macin
tosh clusters.
