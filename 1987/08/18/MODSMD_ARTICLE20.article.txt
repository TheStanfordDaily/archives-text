# Parrot heads rejoice
## Buffett brings 'Margaritaville' to the Bay 
### JAMES R. DICKEY Editorial staff 
Though parrot heads aren't
as well-publicized as Dead
Heads, Jimmy Buffett's col
orfully named followers turned
out in force Saturday night at
Shoreline Amphitheatre.
The show, part of his
Floridays tour, created a unique
blend of sights and sounds that
were typically Buffett.
The members of the audience
represented about as wide a va
riety of backgrounds as is so
cially possible. There were
young preppies, old cowboys,
suburban housewives and every
other subcultural group possi
ble.
The wide variety of fans is
truly startling until seen in the
light of Buffett's music.
His music is, like many other
artists', an original blending of
past styles. In Buffett's case, the
original elements were calypso,
salsa and country music.
The finished product is a style
of music that has thrilled parrot
heads and the general public for
15 years.
The Coral Reefer Band —
with Buffett since his first
release, "A White Sport Coat
and a Pink Crustacean," in
1973 — provided the back
ground music for a very pleas

ant, almost cozy evening of en
tertainment.
Following a few warm-up
numbers by the band, Buffett
emerged in his trademark tropi
cal shirt.
Except for the large Corona
sign, the stage was quite plain,
Buffett being one entertainer
who doesn't need help from
flashy lights or props.
In fact, a complicated light
show would have been com
pletely out of place in the com
fortable, familiar atmosphere
he established. Buffett's enter
taining style seemed perfectly
suited for an amphitheater.
His attitude and the sense of
familiarity that pervaded the
arena is best summed up by the
title of his greatest hits album,
''Songs You Know By Heart."
Almost undetected, Buffett was
leading the audience through a
sing-along of an incredible list
of hits.
The list included "Changes in
Lattitudes, Changes in Atti
tudes," "Son of a Son of a
Sailor" and his is first Top 30
hit, "Come Monday."
In between the songs, Buffett
chatted with the audience,
showing his casual humor. His
favorite topic was Sunday's
Harmonic Convergence, which
he affectionately referred to as
"Harmonica Virgins," saying he

would get up at dawn for one of
those any day, though he'd
never had the pleasure of
meeting one.
The second set introduced
Buffett's livelier songs, and the
crowd was on its feet.
Newer releases like Buffett's
"Brown-Eyed Girl," mixed with
"Turning Around" and "Who's

the Blonde Stranger."
Through it all, the rapport
that Buffett established with
the crowd simply heightened
the enjoyment of the music.
Without talking too much or of
fering gratuitous compliments
about San Francisco or the Bay
Area, he was honestly interest
ing and humorous.
After coming back for his

encore, Buffett daringly pro
claimed Til play as long as you
want me." He ended up playing
a three-song hit list that in
cluded the parrot head anthem,
"Margaritaville."
After the show, almost every
one in the audience, including
those — like me — who were
once skeptics, was a bona fide
parrot head.
