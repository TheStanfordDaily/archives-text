## High hopes reign for Card football 
### MARK ROGOWSKY Editorial staff 
Last year, the Stanford Cardinal football team
won eight games and lost only four. That was
good enough for a spot in the Gator Bowl where
the Clemson Tigers came away with a 27-21 vic
tory.
Had quarterback John Paye been able to play,
instead of nursing his injured throwing shoulder,
the Cardinal might have come away from Jack
sonville with a win.
This season, another man will "shoulder" the
offensive load for Stanford. That man is Heisman
trophy candidate Brad Muster. Muster is a fifth
year senior tailback, and, for Stanford to win,
Muster will have to turn in Heisman trophy
numbers.
Clearly, though, Muster won't be able to do it
alone. Fortunately, he'll have some help from an
All-America candidate — wide receiver Jeff
James. An unanswered question is who will
throw the ball to James, Muster et al.
At the moment it appears to be junior Greg En
nis, but he can expect to face some tough competi
tion. Redshirt freshman Scott Stark and incom
ing freshman Jason Palumbis will give Ennis a

run for his money.
If everyone on the offensive line gets healthy in
time for the season opener, that should be a
strength. Four of last season's five starters
return, including center Andy Sinclair, tabbed by
many as a possible Ail-American.
The defense contains several question marks.
The line returns starters Lester Archambeau,
Ray Huckestein and Eric Volta. The three im
proved throughout last season and should get
even better this year.
The linebacker position will be a strength if
Barry McKeever's knee holds up. Along with
Kevin Richardson, McKeever will be expected to
take over a large portion of the leadership role
vacated by Dave Wyman.
The kicking game is a mixed bag. Punter Doug
Robison had a fantastic year, while kicker David
Sweeney had an awful one.
Sweeney will face a strong challenge from
John Hopkins, a graduate of his high school in
Highland Park, Tex.
If everything comes together, the Cardinal
could have a banner year. The answers to all the
questions will start to come in on Sept. 5 in
Husky Stadium when the denizens of the
gridiron take on the University of Washington.
