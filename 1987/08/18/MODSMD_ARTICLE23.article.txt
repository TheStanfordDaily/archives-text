A look at Stanford athletes around the world

McDowell rocked;
Wassenaar rolls
Jack McDowell's first outing
for the Chicago White Sox'
Class AA affiliate in Birming
ham, Ala., was nothing to write
home about.
McDowell, the ace of this
year's College World Series
champion Stanford Cardinal
baseball team, gave up nine
runs on six hits in four innings.
Meanwhile, Rob Wassenaar,
a former teammate of
McDowell's here, continues to
pitch well for the Angels' Class
A affiliate in Salem, Ore.
Wassenaar is 2-2 with a spec
tacular 1.64 ERA. He has ap
peared in 16 games and pitched
a total of 33 innings. Over that
stretch he has allowed only 33
hits and 11 walks while strik
ing out 40.

Cardinal swimmers
do it down under
It seems that whenever and
wherever there's a major swim
ming competition, present and
former Stanford swimmers are
grabbing headlines. Last week's
Pan-Pacific games in Brisbane,
Australia, were no exception.
Pablo Morales, a June
graduate and the finest swim
mer in Stanford history,
captured the 100-meter butter
fly in 53.37 seconds. He
defeated 1984 Olympic gold
medalist Jon Sieben.
Junior Jenna Johnson was a
member of the U.S. 400-meter
freestyle team that captured
that event in 2:43.90. Johnson
also took second in the 50-meter
freestyle in 56.11.
