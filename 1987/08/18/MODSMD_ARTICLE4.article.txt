# Sites selected for S. America campus

### LIZ LEMPERT Staff writer 
The University has narrowed
its choices to Buenos Aires, Ar
gentina and Santiago, Chile for
a new overseas campus in Latin
America, according to the Over
seas Studies office.
However, unless "substantial
change" is brought about by the
plebiscite scheduled to take
place in Chile next year, Stan
ford "would not feel comfortable
in Chile," said Thomas Heller,
director of Overseas Studies.
Heller said he plans to travel
to both Latin American cities in
November or December to
develop institutional links for
the center, which will focus on
Latin American culture and the
problems of Third World devel
opment. The campus is sched
uled to open at one of the two lo
cations in September, 1989.
Argentine President Raul Al
fonsin visited Stanford in late
June, opening discussions about
a possible Stanford-Buenos
Aires connection. Manuel
Sadosky, Argentina's secretary
of state for science and technol
ogy, accompanied the president.
Sadosky, who was reportedly
enthusiastic about the potential
for such a relationship, has
since been placed in charjafe of
negotiations with Stanford.
A joint faculty-student panel

presented its recommendations
on site options to Heller in July.
The panel named the two cities
as the most promising for the
center. The panel also consid
ered but rejected Carcas,
Venezuela; Quito, Ecuador; San
Paulo, Brazil; and Mexico City
as possible sites.
The panel based its decision
on student polls and interviews,
Heller said. It favored "places
involved with the contemporary
issues of urbanization and in
dustrialization, places where
we find important groups of
academics and researchers, and
places with a political atmos
phere in which Stanford could
flourish, rather than cause con
troversy," Heller added.
"The virtues of Buenos Aires
as a study site are many," Hel
ler said."lt is a major, autono
mous center of Latin American
culture. Literature, music, art
and theater are all well estab
lished there. It is not a trans
planted piece of Europe."
The proposed theme for the
center is "Dilemmas of Develop
ment in the Third World,"
which would include course of
ferings in the history and cul
ture of Latin America, the
causes and consequences of
poverty and underdevelopment,
comparative politics and lan
«tudioK. According to
Heller, both cities are rich in
cultural and educational oppor
tunities.
"There is a very large concen
tration of cultural and educa
tional institutions in Buenos
Aires. The intellectual life of
the country has survived quite
well," Heller said, referring to
the previous eight years of mili
tary rule during which many
Argentinian artists and intel
lectuals fled the country.
Santiago shares many of the
same qualities as Buenos Aires,
Heller said, but intellectual and
political freedoms have suffered
greatly under the rule of Gen.
Augusto Pinochet, who has
been president of Chile since
1973.
"Currently, it's an unfavora
ble place for a Stanford center.
The Pinochet regime does not
lend itself to the kind of aca
demic freedom essential for the
program to flourish," Heller
said.
The plebiscite, expected to oc
cur in September 1988, will be a
vote on the matter and speed
with which democracy may
return to Chile, according to
Heller.
However, "even if the
plebiscite indicated the desire
for change in that country,
there would remain the ques
tion of whether the military
would seriously respond to
those changes by 1989, when we

plan to begin our program,"
Heller said.
"It would be a very beautiful
thing for Stanford to participate
in Chile's transition to
democracy," he added.
Because of the vastness and
diversity of Latin America, stu
dents and faculty utilizing
Stanford's study center will also
have the option of taking field
trips to other parts of the con
tinent.
Small groups comprised of
four to seven students will
"have the chance to combine ac

ademic learning with public
service and individual research
opportunities," Heller said.
Projects in development in
clude a conservation biology re
search site in Guanacasta Na
tional Park in Costa Rica;
studies of multiculturalism in
Rio de Janeiro; and public
health research in Chiapas,
Mexico.
Heller predicted that the
Latin America campus would
house 40 students, much like its
European counterparts. Those
participating in the program

would be required to take at
least two quarters of Spanish.
About one-third of Stanford's
undergraduates participate in
the overseas program. Initiated
in 1958, the program currently
includes Stanford campuses in
Berlin, Florence, Oxford and
Tours with an additional pro
gram planned in Kyoto, Japan.
The University also offers
special programs for undergrad
uates in Paris, Rome, Cairo,
Nairobi, Tokyo, Taipei and
Salamanca, Spain; Haifa, Is
rael; Lima, Peru; and Sao Paolo,
Brazil.

on student polls and interviews,
Heller said. It favored "places
involved with the contemporary
issues of urbanization and in
dustrialization, places where
we find important groups of
academics and researchers, and
places with a political atmos
phere in which Stanford could
flourish, rather than cause con
troversy," Heller added.
"The virtues of Buenos Aires
as a study site are many," Hel
ler said."lt is a major, autono
mous center of Latin American
culture. Literature, music, art
and theater are all well estab
lished there. It is not a trans
planted piece of Europe."
The proposed theme for the
center is "Dilemmas of Develop
ment in the Third World,"
which would include course of
ferings in the history and cul
ture of Latin America, the
causes and consequences of
poverty and underdevelopment,
comparative politics and lan
«tudioK. According to
Heller, both cities are rich in
cultural and educational oppor
tunities.
"There is a very large concen
tration of cultural and educa
tional institutions in Buenos
Aires. The intellectual life of
the country has survived quite
well," Heller said, referring to
the previous eight years of mili
tary rule during which many
Argentinian artists and intel
lectuals fled the country.
Santiago shares many of the
same qualities as Buenos Aires,
Heller said, but intellectual and
political freedoms have suffered
greatly under the rule of Gen.
Augusto Pinochet, who has
been president of Chile since
1973.
"Currently, it's an unfavora
ble place for a Stanford center.
The Pinochet regime does not
lend itself to the kind of aca
demic freedom essential for the
program to flourish," Heller
said.
The plebiscite, expected to oc
cur in September 1988, will be a
vote on the matter and speed
with which democracy may
return to Chile, according to
Heller.
However, "even if the
plebiscite indicated the desire
for change in that country,
there would remain the ques
tion of whether the military
would seriously respond to
those changes by 1989, when we

plan to begin our program,"
Heller said.
"It would be a very beautiful
thing for Stanford to participate
in Chile's transition to
democracy," he added.
Because of the vastness and
diversity of Latin America, stu
dents and faculty utilizing
Stanford's study center will also
have the option of taking field
trips to other parts of the con
tinent.
Small groups comprised of
four to seven students will
"have the chance to combine ac

ademic learning with public
service and individual research
opportunities," Heller said.
Projects in development in
clude a conservation biology re
search site in Guanacasta Na
tional Park in Costa Rica;
studies of multiculturalism in
Rio de Janeiro; and public
health research in Chiapas,
Mexico.
Heller predicted that the
Latin America campus would
house 40 students, much like its
European counterparts. Those
participating in the program

would be required to take at
least two quarters of Spanish.
About one-third of Stanford's
undergraduates participate in
the overseas program. Initiated
in 1958, the program currently
includes Stanford campuses in
Berlin, Florence, Oxford and
Tours with an additional pro
gram planned in Kyoto, Japan.
The University also offers
special programs for undergrad
uates in Paris, Rome, Cairo,
Nairobi, Tokyo, Taipei and
Salamanca, Spain; Haifa, Is
rael; Lima, Peru; and Sao Paolo,
Brazil.
