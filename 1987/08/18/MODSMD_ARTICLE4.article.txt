The University has narrowed
its choices to Buenos Aires, Ar
gentina and Santiago, Chile for
a new overseas campus in Latin
America, according to the Over
seas Studies office.
However, unless "substantial
change" is brought about by the
plebiscite scheduled to take
place in Chile next year, Stan
ford "would not feel comfortable
in Chile," said Thomas Heller,
director of Overseas Studies.
Heller said he plans to travel
to both Latin American cities in
November or December to
develop institutional links for
the center, which will focus on
Latin American culture and the
problems of Third World devel
opment. The campus is sched
uled to open at one of the two lo
cations in September, 1989.
Argentine President Raul Al
fonsin visited Stanford in late
June, opening discussions about
a possible Stanford-Buenos
Aires connection. Manuel
Sadosky, Argentina's secretary
of state for science and technol
ogy, accompanied the president.
Sadosky, who was reportedly
enthusiastic about the potential
for such a relationship, has
since been placed in charjafe of
negotiations with Stanford.
A joint faculty-student panel

presented its recommendations
on site options to Heller in July.
The panel named the two cities
as the most promising for the
center. The panel also consid
ered but rejected Carcas,
Venezuela; Quito, Ecuador; San
Paulo, Brazil; and Mexico City
as possible sites.
The panel based its decision
on student polls and interviews,
Heller said. It favored "places
involved with the contemporary
issues of urbanization and in
dustrialization, places where
we find important groups of
academics and researchers, and
places with a political atmos
phere in which Stanford could
flourish, rather than cause con
troversy," Heller added.
"The virtues of Buenos Aires
as a study site are many," Hel
ler said."lt is a major, autono
mous center of Latin American
culture. Literature, music, art
and theater are all well estab
lished there. It is not a trans
planted piece of Europe."
The proposed theme for the
center is "Dilemmas of Develop
ment in the Third World,"
which would include course of
ferings in the history and cul
ture of Latin America, the
causes and consequences of
poverty and underdevelopment,
comparative politics and lan
