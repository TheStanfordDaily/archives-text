# Humane society still questioning RAF II
## 
### SUSAN SLUSSER Editorial staff 
The Palo Alto Humane Society sent a six
page letter to the Santa Clara County
Board of Supervisors yesterday rebutting a
Stanford document issued last week con
cerning a proposed animal research facility
on campus.
The University's 28-page document was
written in response to questions raised by
the humane society earlier this month re
garding the proposed Research Animal Fa
cility 11.
The board will discuss granting Stanford
a land-use permit for RAF II at 1:30 p.m.

today. The humane society has asked that
construction of the animal facility be
delayed until an environmental impact
study is conducted.
"The research facility should be delayed
until some kind of environmental impact
study is done," humane society board mem
ber Lise Giraud said. "To reject an environ
mental impact report out of hand and to
suggest absolute guarantees that there will
be no environmental impact is really rash."
In the letter, the humane society also re
quested that a representative from their
group serve on Stanford's Animal Care and
Use Committee "as a condition for the
granting of a use permit."
On May 7, the Santa Clara County Plan

ning Commission unanimously voted to al
low a land-use permit for the project, but
the supervisors voted July 28 to delay the
final decision after an appeal by the
humane society.
The supervisors asked the humane soci
ety to prepare a list of questions for Stan
ford about the proposed building. The ques
tions were delivered to the University on
Aug. 5 and Stanford released its response
Thursday.
The humane society said that the Univer
sity has not answered its questions ade
quately. "Their response on almost every
question has been misleading and high-
handed in tone," Giraud said.
"It reiterates the same tired
rhetoric we hear from them all
the time."
The humane society letter,
compiled by the group's presi
dent, Helen McClosky, and soci
ety board members Patricia El
sen and Giraud, does not ad
dress all the questions that
Stanford replied to last week.
The University responded to
all 29 questions posed by the
humane society on RAF II and
related animal research topics,
but in yesterday's letter the
humane society addressed only
a few of their concerns "in the
interest of brevity."
Among the issues addressed
in the letter is the placement of
a humane society member on
the Animal Care and Use Com
mittee. The letter quotes Uni
versity President Donald Ken
nedy as saying it would be
"especially unwise" to have a
member of another private or
ganization on a Stanford
"critical operating committee"
when the two organizations
might find themselves involved
in a "fundamental dispute."
"Does Dr. Kennedy mean to
suggest conditions are such that
a representative of an animal
research organization will find
him or herself only able to
dispute the animal care and use
at Stanford?" the letter asks.
"Or that only people who will
not dispute what is brought up
for consideration will be ap
pointed?"
The humane society response
also contends that the Univer
sity is not a "wholly disin
terested party when it comes to
seeing lucrative biomedical re
search procede forthwith."
Thomas Hamm, director of
animal medicine here, said it

would be poor policy to place a
humane society member on the
committee. "In the first place, I
can't understand why this re
quirement is being tied to a
land use permit," Hamm said.
"We don't allow anyone from
outside organizations to pick
members for committees on
campus," he said. "Does this
mean that outside people can
pick members for all University
committees? That is something
we just can't accept."
Hamm pointed out that a
former president and board
member of a humane society is
currently on the committee.
The letter also questions the
concern for and knowledge
about animals among some
members of the current Univer
sity committee, and states that
"veterinarians in general do not
represent nor are they responsi
ble to any particular con
stituency, as a member from a
broadly based animal welfare
organization would be."
The humane society is con
cerned that possible health and
safety dangers could be caused
by biohazardous research it
believes may take place in the
facility or by biohazardous work
done on animals that might be
housed there.
"If RAF II will house no
animals that in any way pose a
threat to public safety, is the
county satisfied that the areas
where such animals and tissues
are kept are state of the art and
fully secure?" the letter asks.
But according to Hamm, "If
these animals have anything
that is hazardous, they won't be
in RAF 11, period. Anything
hazardous is required by law, in
fact, to be housed in other
facilities where the animals are
properly quarantined.
"[The humane society is] at
tacking RAF II any way they
can think of. We don't even do
much biohazardous work on
animals at Stanford," he added.
