# Faculty debates restored
## 
### JAMES LIN Staff writer 
Plans for a single Orientation Week
faculty debate on the purposes of col
lege education have been revamped in
favor of sponsoring smaller, concur
rently running debates on several
policy-oriented and political issues, ac
cording to the Office of Residential Ed
ucation.
The change, said Asst. Dean of Resi
dential Education Alice Supton, was
precipitated by difficulties in finding
available faculty to participate in the
original topic, "Why Are You Here? A
Debate on the Purposes of a College Ed
ucation."
"We weren't pulling the debate to
gether in the way that we had hoped,"
Supton said. "We could not find
presenters whom we thought would
make a dynamic forum."
Junior Laurie Langfitt, Res Ed's co

ordinator for freshman orientation, ex
plained that faculty members who were
originally slated for the debate would
be unavailable during the scheduled
time.
"It was just circumstance," she said.
"One was going out of town, one was
going on sabbatical. We thought we
had the perfect people."
Current plans resemble those for last
year's faculty debates. In 1986, the first
year in which the debates were offered,
discussion focused on ethics in science,
Third World poverty and the influence
of Christianity on Western culture.
Tentative topics for the Orientation
this year include affirmative action
and terrorism, Langfitt said. According
to Supton, a third topic under consider
ation focuses on technology and sci
ence, perhaps addressing issues such as
SDI.
