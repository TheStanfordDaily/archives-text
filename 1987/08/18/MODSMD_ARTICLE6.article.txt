# Faculty debates restored
## 
### JAMES LIN Staff writer 
Plans for a single Orientation Week
faculty debate on the purposes of col
lege education have been revamped in
favor of sponsoring smaller, concur
rently running debates on several
policy-oriented and political issues, ac
cording to the Office of Residential Ed
ucation.
The change, said Asst. Dean of Resi
dential Education Alice Supton, was
precipitated by difficulties in finding
available faculty to participate in the
original topic, "Why Are You Here? A
Debate on the Purposes of a College Ed
ucation."
"We weren't pulling the debate to
gether in the way that we had hoped,"
Supton said. "We could not find
presenters whom we thought would
make a dynamic forum."
Junior Laurie Langfitt, Res Ed's co

ordinator for freshman orientation, ex
plained that faculty members who were
originally slated for the debate would
be unavailable during the scheduled
time.
"It was just circumstance," she said.
"One was going out of town, one was
going on sabbatical. We thought we
had the perfect people."
Current plans resemble those for last
year's faculty debates. In 1986, the first
year in which the debates were offered,
discussion focused on ethics in science,
Third World poverty and the influence
of Christianity on Western culture.
Tentative topics for the Orientation
this year include affirmative action
and terrorism, Langfitt said. According
to Supton, a third topic under consider
ation focuses on technology and sci
ence, perhaps addressing issues such as
SDI.
The original plans, which
were sharply criticized by some
students, called for a single
large debate to discuss the
purposes of a college education.
Student criticism of the pro
posal called the topic "safe" in
contrast with the highly contro
versial issues covered in 1986.
"If I had known the debate
was on the purpose of a Stan
ford education, I would never
have gone," said sophomore
Ilan Reuben, who said he
enjoyed last year's Orientation
debate on Christianity.
"I had had so much 'how-to
college' stuff drummed into my
head at that point, it would
have made me sick to my
stomach," he added.
According to Supton, "This
year there was an idea to dis
cuss what people come to col
lege for. Every new student
should be addressing the ques
tion: What am I doing here?
What am I trying to get out of
college?"
Langfitt said that the topic
had originated as an idea pro
posed by the resident fellows.
"Ifs the kind of debate that
would challenge freshmen after
they have had some experi
ence," said Amy Sims, a
Florence Moore Hall resident
fellow. Sims, who was away
when the original choice was
made, said that she thought the
change to new topics was a good
idea.

Supton, while emphasizing
that she thought the topic of the
purpose of college remained
viable as a possibility for future
debates, said that Res Ed is also
considering raising the issue as
a discussion topic in the dormi
tories.
"We're interested in discuss
ing this in the dorm, as a con
tinuation of Orientation," she
said, agreeing with Sims that
the subject would have added
value "when students have
some experiences against which
to measure what they're
hearing."
"Since we can't do the large
debate," Langfitt said, "my
hope is that it does come out in
a discussion, workshop, forum
or panel — perhaps even a
quarter into their Stanford ex
perience."
It would nevertheless be im
portant,-she said, to have the
discussions fairly early for
freshmen, "while they're still
fresh."
Sims observed that the issue
was already being discussed at
the classroom level in
Structured Liberal Education
and in several Western Culture
courses.
Both Supton and Langfitt
said the circumstances of ob
taining faculty had caused the
change in plans. Langfitt noted
that the faculty scheduled to
participate in the debate were
very interested before having to
bow out due to scheduling con
flicts.
"It just happened to be a bad
time," she said, noting that or

ganizers of the new debates
were encountering similar diffi
culties.
Langfitt added that the
change from a single debate to
multiple smaller debates was
influenced by the need for more
choice among the new subjects.
"When you go from a topic that
affects everyone to a more spe
cific one, there needs to be a
little more choice."
Supton explained that the
process of planning the debates
for Orientation Week was evo
lutionary and flexible by neces
sity. "As in many programs in
Orientation, it is under con
stant re-evaluation," she said.
"There was an ongoing discus
sion, as there has to be."
The new debates, while re
sembling those of the previous
year in some aspects, will also
show some changes. The topics
will be discussed in a more
traditional format, with time
given for both opening argu
ments and for rebuttal.
Langfitt suggested that about
10 minutes might be given for
the initial arguments and five
minutes for the rebuttal, with
more time given in the debate
over affirmative action, which
will have two speakers for each
side.
In addition to the changes in
format, Langfitt also hopes that
this year's debate will include
women and representatives of
minority groups.
"There was a legitimate ob
servation that the people on the
platform who were speaking (in
1986) were almost exclusively
white males," Supton said. It's a

concern, and it's on our minds."
When asked whether the
changes were instituted in
response to criticism of last
year's debates, Supton said,
"We aren't doing this to please
the critics. We are doing it be
cause it's the right thing to do."
Sims expressed excitement
about the debate on terrorism,
which she is organizing. "We're
trying to find speakers who will
probe significant questions,
who will address the issue
seriously and explore its
philosophical and moral impli
cations," she said.
"Part of the challenge of the
debate will be the challenge of
defining terrorism and asking
not only what terrorism is, but
who defines it," she said.
Sims also noted the plural
purposes behind the debates de
signed for freshmen. "To chal
lenge them, make them think,
expose them to faculty and to
the fact that faculty take these
ideas seriously and yet can also
have fun with them."
The faculty debates serve
several purposes, Supton said.
"They give students an opportu
nity to recognize that there are
intelligent, articulate people,
with carefully reasoned argu
ments, who don't agree," she
said, adding that the debates
highlight an environment in
which people are free to dis
agree and yet respect each
other's opinions.
Supton also emphasized that
the debates encourage students
to think seriously about world
and community issues.

a discussion, workshop, forum
or panel — perhaps even a
quarter into their Stanford ex
perience."
It would nevertheless be im
portant,-she said, to have the
discussions fairly early for
freshmen, "while they're still
fresh."
Sims observed that the issue
was already being discussed at
the classroom level in
Structured Liberal Education
and in several Western Culture
courses.
Both Supton and Langfitt
said the circumstances of ob
taining faculty had caused the
change in plans. Langfitt noted
that the faculty scheduled to
participate in the debate were
very interested before having to
bow out due to scheduling con
flicts.
"It just happened to be a bad
time," she said, noting that or

ganizers of the new debates
were encountering similar diffi
culties.
Langfitt added that the
change from a single debate to
multiple smaller debates was
influenced by the need for more
choice among the new subjects.
"When you go from a topic that
affects everyone to a more spe
cific one, there needs to be a
little more choice."
Supton explained that the
process of planning the debates
for Orientation Week was evo
lutionary and flexible by neces
sity. "As in many programs in
Orientation, it is under con
stant re-evaluation," she said.
"There was an ongoing discus
sion, as there has to be."
The new debates, while re
sembling those of the previous
year in some aspects, will also
show some changes. The topics
will be discussed in a more
traditional format, with time
given for both opening argu
ments and for rebuttal.
Langfitt suggested that about
10 minutes might be given for
the initial arguments and five
minutes for the rebuttal, with
more time given in the debate
over affirmative action, which
will have two speakers for each
side.
In addition to the changes in
format, Langfitt also hopes that
this year's debate will include
women and representatives of
minority groups.
"There was a legitimate ob
servation that the people on the
platform who were speaking (in
1986) were almost exclusively
white males," Supton said. It's a

concern, and it's on our minds."
When asked whether the
changes were instituted in
response to criticism of last
year's debates, Supton said,
"We aren't doing this to please
the critics. We are doing it be
cause it's the right thing to do."
Sims expressed excitement
about the debate on terrorism,
which she is organizing. "We're
trying to find speakers who will
probe significant questions,
who will address the issue
seriously and explore its
philosophical and moral impli
cations," she said.
"Part of the challenge of the
debate will be the challenge of
defining terrorism and asking
not only what terrorism is, but
who defines it," she said.
Sims also noted the plural
purposes behind the debates de
signed for freshmen. "To chal
lenge them, make them think,
expose them to faculty and to
the fact that faculty take these
ideas seriously and yet can also
have fun with them."
The faculty debates serve
several purposes, Supton said.
"They give students an opportu
nity to recognize that there are
intelligent, articulate people,
with carefully reasoned argu
ments, who don't agree," she
said, adding that the debates
highlight an environment in
which people are free to dis
agree and yet respect each
other's opinions.
Supton also emphasized that
the debates encourage students
to think seriously about world
and community issues.
Plans for a single Orientation Week
faculty debate on the purposes of col
lege education have been revamped in
favor of sponsoring smaller, concur
rently running debates on several
policy-oriented and political issues, ac
cording to the Office of Residential Ed
ucation.
The change, said Asst. Dean of Resi
dential Education Alice Supton, was
precipitated by difficulties in finding
available faculty to participate in the
original topic, "Why Are You Here? A
Debate on the Purposes of a College Ed
ucation."
"We weren't pulling the debate to
gether in the way that we had hoped,"
Supton said. "We could not find
presenters whom we thought would
make a dynamic forum."
Junior Laurie Langfitt, Res Ed's co

ordinator for freshman orientation, ex
plained that faculty members who were
originally slated for the debate would
be unavailable during the scheduled
time.
"It was just circumstance," she said.
"One was going out of town, one was
going on sabbatical. We thought we
had the perfect people."
Current plans resemble those for last
year's faculty debates. In 1986, the first
year in which the debates were offered,
discussion focused on ethics in science,
Third World poverty and the influence
of Christianity on Western culture.
Tentative topics for the Orientation
this year include affirmative action
and terrorism, Langfitt said. According
to Supton, a third topic under consider
ation focuses on technology and sci
ence, perhaps addressing issues such as
SDI.
The original plans, which
were sharply criticized by some
students, called for a single
large debate to discuss the
purposes of a college education.
Student criticism of the pro
posal called the topic "safe" in
contrast with the highly contro
versial issues covered in 1986.
"If I had known the debate
was on the purpose of a Stan
ford education, I would never
have gone," said sophomore
Ilan Reuben, who said he
enjoyed last year's Orientation
debate on Christianity.
"I had had so much 'how-to
college' stuff drummed into my
head at that point, it would
have made me sick to my
stomach," he added.
According to Supton, "This
year there was an idea to dis
cuss what people come to col
lege for. Every new student
should be addressing the ques
tion: What am I doing here?
What am I trying to get out of
college?"
Langfitt said that the topic
had originated as an idea pro
posed by the resident fellows.
"Ifs the kind of debate that
would challenge freshmen after
they have had some experi
ence," said Amy Sims, a
Florence Moore Hall resident
fellow. Sims, who was away
when the original choice was
made, said that she thought the
change to new topics was a good
idea.

Supton, while emphasizing
that she thought the topic of the
purpose of college remained
viable as a possibility for future
debates, said that Res Ed is also
considering raising the issue as
a discussion topic in the dormi
tories.
"We're interested in discuss
ing this in the dorm, as a con
tinuation of Orientation," she
said, agreeing with Sims that
the subject would have added
value "when students have
some experiences against which
to measure what they're
hearing."
"Since we can't do the large
debate," Langfitt said, "my
hope is that it does come out in
a discussion, workshop, forum
or panel — perhaps even a
quarter into their Stanford ex
perience."
It would nevertheless be im
portant,-she said, to have the
