Writer held hostage is free in Beirut
BEIRUT, Lebanon — American free-lance writer and
journalist Charles Glass escaped or was freed early today
after two months in captivity, according to security sources
quoted by the Christian Voice of Lebanon radio.
The radio said the 36-year-old Californian, kidnapped in
the southern suburbs of this Lebanese capital on June 17,
arrived at the Summerland Hotel at 2:30 a.m. local time (4:30
p.m. PDT yesterday) in a taxi. The luxurious summer resort
is at the border of the southern slums where pro-Iranian fun
damentalist groups are based.
"Special Syrian units came to the hotel and escorted Glass
to an unknown destination," the radio station reported.
Receptionists at the hotel blocked telephone calls and told
journalists who arrived there: "We would like to help you but
we can't."
Glass was the first foreigner seized in Lebanon since the
Syrians moved 7,500 troops into West Beirut on Feb. 22 to
curb feuding militias. He was seized near a Syrian army
checkpoint
AIDS vaccine test reportedly OK'd
An experimental AIDS vaccine developed by a small,
little-known Connecticut company has become the first to
receive government approval for testing in humans, a usually
reliable trade publication reported yesterday.
The Washington Drug Letter said the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration had given its approval for a vaccine
manufactured by MicroGeneSys of West Haven, Conn., to be
tested in clinical trials that will be supervised by the Na
tional Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases.
Officials of both federal agencies refused to confirm the
report yesterday, but MicroGeneSys and the institute have
scheduled a joint news conference in Washington today, when
a formal announcement is expected.
News that a test vaccine has been approved was not sur
prising. As recently as last spring, Dr. Anthony Fauci, the di
rector of the infectious-disease institute, had said that five or
six candidate vaccines were under FDA consideration and
that human trials could be expected to begin late this year or
early next year.
The approval of the MicroGeneSys product apparently
means only that such trials might begin several months
sooner than anticipated.
NASA: Moon base should be built
WASHINGTON — A study led by Astronaut Sally Ride
said yesterday the United States should move toward build
ing a permanent outpost on the moon as a way station toward
the ultimate goal of "exploring, prospecting and settling
Mars."
The long-awaited report, ordered as a part of the National
Aeronautics and Space Administration's effort to recover
from the devastation of the January 1986 Challenger acci
dent, was delivered to NASA Administrator James Fletcher
last week and released yesterday.
In its broad outlines it agreed with the conclusions of a
blue-ribbon study completed by a National Commission on
Space last year.
In her 63-page report, Ride, a Stanford graduate, brushed
aside persistent calls from some space enthusiasts for the
United States to adopt a single over-arching objective similar
to the Kennedy administration's commitment to land men on
the moon in the 19605.
Indeed, she said, "It would not be good strategy, good sci
ence or good policy for the U.S. to select a single initiative,
then pursue it single-mindedly. The pursuit of a single initia
tive to the exclusion of all others results in leadership in only
a limited range of space endeavor."
Aide to Hitler dies in Berlin prison
Rudolf Hess, once Adolf Hitler's devoted aide and the last
known surviving member of the Nazi leadership, died yester
day in West Berlin's Spandau Prison for war criminals, where
he had spent 40 years in virtual solitary confinement. He was
93.
Hess' death was officially announced by British diplomatic
spokesman Anderson Purdon. The cause of death was not dis
closed. But Hess, whom Hitler called a madman for his mys
terious flight to Scotland in 1941 on a quixotic peace mission,
suffered from lung, heart and stomach ailments.
Hess reportedly had tried to commit suicide on at least
three occasions, and in later years he was nearly blind. He
was the sole inmate of Spandau, located in the British sector
of West Berlin, for 20 years.
Throughout his imprisonment he had been forbidden to
read, listen to or watch any material of a political content.
With Hess' death, the prison will be torn down to prevent it
from becoming a shrine for Nazi sympathizers, according to
an Allied statement. Six other top Nazis had served up to 20
years in Spandau.
The Allied statement said Hess' body would be cremated
today in a private family ceremony near Munich and his
ashes would then be scattered.
