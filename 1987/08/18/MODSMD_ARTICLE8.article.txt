ROMULUS, Mich. — Inves
tigators searching for the cause
of Sunday night's deadly crash
of Northwest Airlines flight 255
turned their attention yester
day to the plane's engines.
Bound for Phoenix and
Southern California's John
Wayne Airport, the twin-engine
MD-80 crashed seconds after
takeoff just beyond the
perimeter of Detroit's Met
ropolitan Airport, killing at
least 154 people.
Witnesses, including air traf
fic controllers, said they saw
flames coming from the plane's
left engine which, they said, ex
ploded seconds before the plane
swerved and crashed on a busy
highway.
"At this point all we have are
the barest facts," said John
Lauber, chief spokesman for the
National Transportation Safety
Board, which is investigating
the crash.
"Some eyewitnesses have re
ported seeing an in-flight fire
before impact," Lauber said late
yesterday,"and other eyewit

nesses report seeing no such fire
before impact."
Lauber said 25 witnesses
were interviewed yesterday and
that the differences in their ob
servations illustrated how diffi
cult the investigation would be.
Investigators also examined
the remnants of both engines,
which are lying under an inter
state highway overpass near
the end of the aircraft's deadly
skid. The core of the left engine
had been inspected, he said.
"We found no evidence of an un
contained failure ... or any
evidence of an in-flight fire."
Lauber said, however, that
only the right engine was still
covered by its outer cowling,
but insisted, "there is no
evidence of an uncontained fail
ure of either engine." He identi
fied the engine as Pratt & Whit
ney JTBD-217.
The disaster unfolded in a
similar fashion to the August
1985 crash of a British Airtours
Boeing 737 equipped with an
other version of the engine, the
JTBD-15.

One of the engines on that
plane exploded and caught fire,
authorities said, as the fully
loaded plane reached takeoff
speed at Manchester. Fifty-four
people were killed and 83
survived.
U.S. officials have been con
cerned about the engines on the
MD-80 airliner for several
months, it was disclosed yester
day.
Less than three weeks ago,
the Federal Aviation Adminis
tration asked the airline indus
try to comment on a proposed
directive to inspect the engines.
The National Transportation
Safety Board, now in charge of
the Northwest Airlines investi
gation, urged in April that all
JTBD 200-series engines be in
spected because a 1-inch by 15-
inch tear was found in the outer
skin of one of the engines on an
American Airlines MD-80. That
plane encountered trouble in
mid-flight and landed safely at
Minneapolis.
