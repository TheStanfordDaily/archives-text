						Stanford Daily An Independent Newspaper AIDS: Be aware 
### 
It would be a mistake to ignore the problem of AIDS at
Stanford. But unfortunately, it seems that a sizable portion of
the Stanford community is not accepting the impact this
deadly disease could have on their lives.
A Cowell Student Health Center poll showed that of the
students who categorize themselves as sexually active, 74
percent say they do not discuss sexually transmitted diseases
with their partners before intercourse. Those people are act
ing irresponsibly.
Ignoring STDs can kill you. AIDS has taken over 40,000
lives in the United States â€” and some lives at Stanford. For
every one of the few people here who publicly acknowledged
that they had AIDS, such as the late Prof. Donald Howard,
there are several about whom we never hear.
Professors, staff members, graduate students and under
graduate students have contracted AIDS.
And AIDS is not the only danger to our community. Accord
ing to Kathy McCoy, senior medical technologist at Cowell, so
far this year the center has found 45 positive results in tests
for chlamydia, herpes and gonorrhea.
Those results do not include the cases of the STD genital
warts, for which no lab tests are run and the numbers are un
available. Nor do they include several cases of chlamydia, the
most common STD here, among men. Chlamydia tests are
rarely run on men because treatment for the symptoms would
not change even in the event of a positive test.
The pain, the tragedy and the death can all be avoided if
only people would take the responsibility to protect them
selves from disease.
But many don't. Some college students have a sense of
youthful invulnerability that leads them to believe they can
not be struck down. Others believe that Stanford people are
not "the kind of people" who might have AIDS or some other
STD.
That's not the case. Anyone who is sexually active can get
AIDS or an STD if they have not been careful in their sexual
activity.
Students should get the facts.
Call Cowell, the Bridge, the AIDS Awareness Project or
your physician. Find out what the safer forms of sexual activ
ity are. According to the Cowell survey, about 28 percent of
students don't have this potentially life-saving information.
Worse still, nearly half of those students who know what
"safe sex" is ignore it in their sexual activity. This is asking
for trouble.
There are several responsible actions anyone can take to
deal with the reality ot AIDS. One is going to programming
by the Office of Residential Education on STD prevention.
Also, talking with partners about sexual practices and each
others sexual histories is a basic precaution.
Remember that despite the Thursday report by the Centers
for Disease Control that AIDS is spreading slower than ex
pected, AIDS is still spreading. Those who will be least likely
to get it or any other STD will be those who take responsible
steps to protect themselves now.
