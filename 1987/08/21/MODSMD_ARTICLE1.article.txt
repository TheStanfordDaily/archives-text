# Zetes voluntarily disband for five years
## 
### LIZ LEMPERT Staff writer 
The Stanford chapter of the Zeta Psi
fraternity decided to disband for five
years in order to improve relations with
the University administration and help
to rebuild the chapter in the future, the
University announced yesterday.
The decision follows a University in
vestigation into the April 22 drowning
death of Zete member David Dunshee
after a Boathouse rush party. In a report
issued in June, Michael Jackson, assis
tant to the dean of student affairs, rec
ommended that the University revoke
recognition of the Zete chapter indefi

nitely.
Acting Dean of Student Affairs Norm
Robinson has been expected to make a
final decision on the chapter's status for
several weeks.
"We understand that the most likely
course of action will be denial of recogni
tion of Zeta Psi by the University," Zete
President Neil Hanson wrote in a letter
to Robinson dated August 13. "We feel
that it is in our interest to comply volun
tarily with this decision.
"Numbers are down and morale is low
given the events of last April," Hanson
continued. Voluntarily disbanding
"would effectively clear the air and pro
vide a good atmosphere for rebuilding

the chapter, with alumni support, in the
future."
Furthermore, disbanding "would help
to ease the strained relations that exist
between our organization and the ad
ministration. This would further
facilitate our efforts to work out a long
term, mutual agreement for reinstate
ment of Zeta Psi on campus," he said.
Dunshee drowned in Lake Lagunita
with a blood alcohol level of 0.25, two
and-a-half times the level at which an
individual is considered legally drunk.
The fraternity broke a number of
Inter-Fraternity Council guidelines at
its Boathouse rush party, according to
the Jackson report. Infractions included

failing to check rush cards, serving alco
hol past the 11:30 p.m. restriction and
failing to designate a sober monitor.
"It is our opinion that the IFC viola
tions which occured on the night of April
21 and David's death are two separate is
sues," Hanson's letter said.
"Light was shed on the violations as a
result of the extensive investigation
which followed David's death. However,
we do not feel that the guidelines broken
contributed to his accident," Hanson
said.
Robinson agreed that the rule viola
tions did not necessarily lead directly to
Dunshee's drowning.
"The violations and the
tragedy of David's death — it's
possible that one did not cause
the other," Robinson told The
Daily yesterday."The events
have a temporal relationship,
but not necessarily a causal
one.
Robinson promptly accepted
the decision, noting that it
showed good judgement on the
part of the students. "The five
year hiatus should begin at
such a time as there is as
surance — and conduct that
supports that assurance — from
current undergraduate mem
bers and from the alumni group
committed to the future of Zeta
Psi at Stanford that a complete
break in the continuity of the
organization will occur," Robin
son wrote in his reply to Han
son.
After five years, if there is
sufficient interest on the part of
Zeta Psi alumni, national offi

cials and especially Stanford
students, a representative of
the dean of student affairs will
work with a core group of stu
dents to help Zeta Psi prepare a
petition to regain University
recognition, Robinson said.
According to Robinson, if
things go as everyone hopes,
there is a good chance that the
Zetes will start up again
"without the burden of the
baggage they've been carrying
around for the last couple
years."
"Assuming that fraternity
housing still exists at Stanford
— an assumption that should
prove valid — after two com
plete cycles of rush, pledging
and officer transition, Stanford
would accept from a recon
stituted Zeta Psi fraternity a
petition for housing," Robinson
said.
"I am optimistic that a Stan
ford chapter of Zeta Psi reor
ganized in this manner will be
able to enrich the Stanford ex
perience of its members and to
be a group of which the alumni,
the national and the University
can be proud," Robinson said.
