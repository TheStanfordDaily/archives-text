Theme houses
deserve a chance
I would like to respond to the
July 17 editorial about assign
ment of frosh to ethnic theme
houses. The Daily takes the
position that entering students
should have the opportunity to
express a preference not to be
assigned to ethnic theme
houses because "some freshmen
may simply not want to deal
with understanding a whole
new culture as part of the resi
dential package for the first
year of college."
Upon review this year, the
Sub-Committee on Residential
Education and Advising
decided that the old choice "I
prefer a theme house/I prefer a
non-theme house" created an
incorrect impression in the

minds of entering students that
the ethnic theme houses did
not offer first-year students the
same residential experience as
other houses (otherwise why
offer two choices and why sug
gest some students might
prefer a non-theme house). To
correct this impression, this
year students had the chance to
express an affirmative prefer
ence to be assigned to a theme
house but did not have the
option of expressing a prefer
ence for a non-theme house.
Like all other houses with
first-year students, ethnic
theme houses strive to combine
a warm, supportive environ
ment with intellectually
stimulating activities. The
theme component of the pro
gram is provided in addition to,
not instead of, the full array of
activities found in non-theme
houses.

Data from the annual
residence evaluation demon
strate that first-year students
enjoy life in the ethnic theme
houses. In fact, students from
all backgrounds report strong
feelings of belonging to a
"family" and of personal
growth from life in a truly mul
ticultural house.
By approving the change, the
Sub-Committee on Residential
Education and Advising af
firmed the principle that the
same assignment principles
should apply to all houses. Just
as the usual assignment proc
ess may place students of color
in predominantly white
residences, so too may white
students find themselves in
ethnic theme houses. They'll be
the lucky ones.
