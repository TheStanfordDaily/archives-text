# Finding a catchphrase for an unnamed generation
## 
### 
Out of habit, it would seem, the powers
that-be have sought a label for our genera
tion to match the "we" and "me" genera
tions that supposedly preceded us. Elusive
devils that we are, a consensus has yet to
form on a fitting epigram to capture the
mood and outlook of this college generation.
The big news magazines have run their
covcr stories on us, though, and adjectives
recur even if we haven't been properly
christened.

Pre-professional, careerist, self-oriented,
materialistic — the litany is familiar and
accepted. We can't lay exclusive claim to it,
though. We share such adjectives with an
other contemporary generation, one with
the dubious distinction of having escaped
anonymity.
"Yuppie," after all, has achieved the
status of dictionary entry. It describes the
premier sociological (and marketing) phe
nomenon of the '80s. The flower children
have clipped their hair and taken to driving
expensive German sedans. Former Black
Panther Bobby Seales now markets his fa
vorite BBQ recipes to those who once
swooned to his cries of "black power." And
the volatile mix of free love, radical politics
and hallucinogenic drugs has given way to
the somewhat less threatening prospect of
widespread "health-consciousness."
Though we have yet to be compartmen
talized so neatly, the constellation of yuppie
adjectives has been applied to us as well.
Our universities are said to be veritable
yuppie incubators. We are not yuppies,
however, if only for definitional reasons. It
would be more fitting to say that we are a

symptom, or perhaps an evolutionary stage,
of yuppiedom.
To many, we have become indistin
guishable from the young adults who we
are supposed to become. No little resent
ment attaches to this association. As appro
priate as it may be, most Stanford students
bristle at having their behavior described
as "yuppie-like." To be generationally in
distinct is demeaning, even insulting. This
is so despite the fact that many of our peers
do, in fact, find their way into the yuppie
ranks.
Like any overused term, "yuppie" has
strayed from its strict meaning to take in a
great variety of things. Playing tennis after
leaving the office might be "yuppie," but it
is hardly worth remarking about. In my
mind, "yuppie" has a narrower, more value
laden sense.
My understanding of yuppies is not based
on the clothes they wear, the food they eat
or the cars they drive, though these are im
portant trappings. As I see it, the defining
yuppie characteristic — transcending
workplace and campus — is the glorifica
tion and near monofocal pursuit of personal
wealth.
Yuppies conceive of life's formative expe
riences (education and career, most
notably) as means, with money as the only
recognized end. It matters little whether
the base of operations is History Corner or
Kidder-Peabody. The attitude is one of un
abashed instrumentalism. For them, suc
cess corresponds to the financial utility of
their relationships and experiences.
I always get the distinct impression from
people whom I consider yuppies that they
would be satisfied doing virtually anything
if the pay were good enough. Considera
tions of job status notwithstanding, it
seems to me that most of these people would
happily screw in lightbulbs for a living if
they could get a six-figure income for doing
it. Indeed, yuppies often take jobs that are
the functional equivalent of well-paid

menial labor for people of their capabilities.
This is not to nay-say private enterprise.
To be sure, it has its virtues, not the least of
which is the possibility of realizing a per
sonal fortune. To begrudge someone's
desire for financial success is petty. Secu
rity and happiness are achieved in many
different ways. A fortune, however you
wish to define it, may not be a goal for
everyone, but we all seek a comfortable
standard of living. And comfort, most will
acknowledge, is largely a function of
income.
What is reprehensible is not the goal of fi
nancial success per se, but the way in which
it is pursued and its isolation from other
considerations. Adam Smith's "invisible
hand should move under certain con
straints. Reckless self-interest does not con
tribute to the common welfare.
Regrettably, greed has achieved a politi
cal vogue of sorts. Encouragement of the
private sector under a conservative Repub
lican president has been taken as a stamp
of approval by many. And it is a stamp of
approval — for entrepreneurship, for inno
vation and change, for productive enter
prise. It is not a license for self-indulgence
in the purported service of some political
cause. Personal greed is not a public virtue.
It's a private vice.
The casualties of an overriding avarice
are many. For the University, it means the
loss of a student, in any meaningful sense of
the word. For the community, a dearth of
public spirit. For personal relationships,
the probability of bartered affection.
As a statement about lifestyle and out
look, "yuppie" has become pejorative.
People already shy away from its connota
tions of fashionable materialism. Perhaps
they will also come to look critically at the
values it implies. Certainly our still
unnamed generation can aspire to better
things.

Out of habit, it would seem, the powers
that-be have sought a label for our genera
tion to match the "we" and "me" genera
tions that supposedly preceded us. Elusive
devils that we are, a consensus has yet to
form on a fitting epigram to capture the
mood and outlook of this college generation.
The big news magazines have run their
covcr stories on us, though, and adjectives
recur even if we haven't been properly
christened.

Pre-professional, careerist, self-oriented,
materialistic — the litany is familiar and
accepted. We can't lay exclusive claim to it,
though. We share such adjectives with an
other contemporary generation, one with
the dubious distinction of having escaped
anonymity.
"Yuppie," after all, has achieved the
status of dictionary entry. It describes the
premier sociological (and marketing) phe
nomenon of the '80s. The flower children
have clipped their hair and taken to driving
expensive German sedans. Former Black
Panther Bobby Seales now markets his fa
vorite BBQ recipes to those who once
swooned to his cries of "black power." And
the volatile mix of free love, radical politics
and hallucinogenic drugs has given way to
the somewhat less threatening prospect of
widespread "health-consciousness."
Though we have yet to be compartmen
talized so neatly, the constellation of yuppie
adjectives has been applied to us as well.
Our universities are said to be veritable
yuppie incubators. We are not yuppies,
however, if only for definitional reasons. It
would be more fitting to say that we are a

symptom, or perhaps an evolutionary stage,
of yuppiedom.
To many, we have become indistin
guishable from the young adults who we
are supposed to become. No little resent
ment attaches to this association. As appro
priate as it may be, most Stanford students
bristle at having their behavior described
as "yuppie-like." To be generationally in
distinct is demeaning, even insulting. This
is so despite the fact that many of our peers
do, in fact, find their way into the yuppie
ranks.
Like any overused term, "yuppie" has
strayed from its strict meaning to take in a
great variety of things. Playing tennis after
leaving the office might be "yuppie," but it
is hardly worth remarking about. In my
mind, "yuppie" has a narrower, more value
laden sense.
My understanding of yuppies is not based
on the clothes they wear, the food they eat
or the cars they drive, though these are im
portant trappings. As I see it, the defining
yuppie characteristic — transcending
workplace and campus — is the glorifica
tion and near monofocal pursuit of personal
wealth.
Yuppies conceive of life's formative expe
riences (education and career, most
notably) as means, with money as the only
recognized end. It matters little whether
the base of operations is History Corner or
Kidder-Peabody. The attitude is one of un
abashed instrumentalism. For them, suc
cess corresponds to the financial utility of
their relationships and experiences.
I always get the distinct impression from
people whom I consider yuppies that they
would be satisfied doing virtually anything
if the pay were good enough. Considera
tions of job status notwithstanding, it
seems to me that most of these people would
happily screw in lightbulbs for a living if
they could get a six-figure income for doing
it. Indeed, yuppies often take jobs that are
the functional equivalent of well-paid

menial labor for people of their capabilities.
This is not to nay-say private enterprise.
To be sure, it has its virtues, not the least of
which is the possibility of realizing a per
sonal fortune. To begrudge someone's
desire for financial success is petty. Secu
rity and happiness are achieved in many
different ways. A fortune, however you
wish to define it, may not be a goal for
everyone, but we all seek a comfortable
standard of living. And comfort, most will
acknowledge, is largely a function of
income.
What is reprehensible is not the goal of fi
nancial success per se, but the way in which
it is pursued and its isolation from other
considerations. Adam Smith's "invisible
hand should move under certain con
straints. Reckless self-interest does not con
tribute to the common welfare.
Regrettably, greed has achieved a politi
cal vogue of sorts. Encouragement of the
private sector under a conservative Repub
lican president has been taken as a stamp
of approval by many. And it is a stamp of
approval — for entrepreneurship, for inno
vation and change, for productive enter
prise. It is not a license for self-indulgence
in the purported service of some political
cause. Personal greed is not a public virtue.
It's a private vice.
The casualties of an overriding avarice
are many. For the University, it means the
loss of a student, in any meaningful sense of
the word. For the community, a dearth of
public spirit. For personal relationships,
the probability of bartered affection.

look, "yuppie" has become pejorative.

tions of fashionable materialism. Perhaps
