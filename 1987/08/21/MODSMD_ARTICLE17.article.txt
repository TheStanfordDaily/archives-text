## Many summer students enjoy 'foreign' Farm 
### LAURA PRINETTI 
Every year hundreds of students from
several foreign countries choose to spend
their summer vacations at Stanford. One
of the most interesting things about the
foreign students that come here to study
intensively is that most are university
graduates and young professionals —
they don't need the credits.
For many of these summer students,
Stanford will leave some indelible
marks. They will undoutedly take some
California culture back home with them.
"I received high quality technical in
put here," Giuditta Rado, an Italian
graduate student in electrical engineer
ing, said recently. Because of Stanford's
seat in Silicon Valley, she felt she was
"in the heart of the computer science
world."
Rado has enjoyed the chance to meet
people from all over the globe who share
her interest in computer graphics. "I
could open my range of perspectives
here. I received many challenges to be
more innovative in my job," she said.
"1 wish Italian universities had the
same relationship Stanford has between

university research and industries. They
aren't two different worids far from each
other. The wall between them has never
been built, and that's why Stanford
works so well," she added.
Peruvian business student Pablo Del
gado Carrillo is impressed by Stanford's
up-to-date technology.
"Instead of blackboards you have
microcputers here in front of you. And
students have one even in their rooms.
To a person living here it must be nor
mal, but it is the vanguard of technol
ogy. It is something great," Carrillo said.
"At the same time I appreciated that
each student here is closely and individ
ually tutored. I never felt abandoned in
my research work, because the TAs took
good care of me," he added.
International summer students seem
to look at Stanford students with a lot of
respect — and maybe a pinch of envy.
They consider Stanford students very
lucky.
Bruno Machiels, a sophomore from
Belgium, said, "All the Stanford stu
dents I met have this in common: They
are very motivated to work hard, they
are dynamic, they face university life

Bruno Machiels, a
summer student from
Belgium, recently ob
served: rr Stanford stu
dents want to be the
people who'll make
things go better in the
world"

with a good spirit, and for that I mean
they are also able to balance time for
studying and time for sport. They want
to be the people who'll make things go
better in the world."
"[Stanford students] can concentrate
and work constantly," added Isabel
Lluch, an economics student from Spain.
When asked what she learned at Stan
ford, Lluch said: "At home, I'll try to
make an effort to study day by day, and
not just the month before the term."

The challenges offered here seem to be
the main reason that foreign students
come to spend their summers and why
they appreciate their time here so much.
"I have learned to be more responsible
in my study," freshman from Japan
Asako Kavashima said. "Here, teachers
trust us, and that makes you work better
on your own. I found it very interesting
that when we are given a test in class
there is no one who watches us."
Furthermore, according to Kava
shima, it is unusual that during a
lecture the professor invites students to
ask questions and give input. "I had
never seen that," Kavashima said.
Asked what they liked most about
Stanford, most foreign students inter
viewed mentioned the study skills they
gained, the technological equipment
they were able to use and even the
smiles of friendly peers.
But, the youngest of the students in
terviewed, 17-year-old Kavashima, gave
a more heartfelt answer: "I'll miss the
friends I made here. I know we can prob
ably meet again, but not here, and not
this time and not this same many people
together," she said.
