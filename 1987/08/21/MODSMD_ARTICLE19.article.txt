# Experts can't fully answer the pressing question: Why?
## Suicide rate is high for those of college age 
### LYDIA SELLING 
The rate of suicides in the college age population is
steadily increasing, particularly for males, but experts
say the reasons for the rise are unclear.
According to Mark Antonucci, clinical director of
Suicide and Crisis Service of Santa Clara County, any
kind of loss — whether it be in a relationship, poor
grades or simply not meeting expectations — can be se
vere to someone. "Real answers are not known. We
have guesses and a lot more guesses than answers,"
Antonucci said.

About the increase in suicides of the college age
group, Dr. Joseph Silverman, psychiatric resident at
Cowell Student Health Center, said, "One hypothesis is
that depression itself is an illness that has been in
creasing in frequency over the last generation or so.
Other social factors are making suicide look more ap
pealing," he said.
According to Douglas Daher, staff psychologist at
Cowell, there were five suicides at Stanford in 1980-81
and none last year. "With regards to frequency, there is
no sort of etiology to predict or explain these," Daher
said.
Daher defines two types of college students seeking
suicide as an option. First, a depressed person who has
given out lots of messages that he or she is depressed;
secondly, the person who impulsively kills him or her
self after reaching a major breakdown in his or her life.
The latter is most perplexing to mental health profes
sionals, according to Daher.
Jim Cadena, assistant dean of Student Affairs, said:

"People come here expecting to achieve great things.
Students want to major in something and the parents
want them to major in something else. Stanford is a
stressful place."
Suicide is the second leading cause of death for 20 to
24-year-olds. According to the Centers for Disease Con
trol in Atlanta, from 1970 to 1980, 49,496 of the na
tion's 15 to 24-year-olds committed suicide. In 1960
there were 7.1 suicides per 100,000 in the 20 to 24-
year-old group, and in 1980 there were 16.1 suicides
per 100,000 in the same age group. The ratio of suicides
committed by males to those committed by females is
almost five to one.
"Men don't know how to ask for help," Antonucci
said. "There are a lot of pressures on males to succeed.
Men do not have the emotional coping skills that
women have — they don't start out in the same place
that women do. It doesn't come as naturally to them.
It's something we have to learn," he added.
In reference to men leading the statistics, Silverman
said, "It has been a long-standing pattern in suicides. It
may have to do with, in part, the successful methods
males use, such as firearms and hanging."
The firearm suicide rate has climbed 10 times faster
than the suicide rate for all other methods for 20 to 24-
year-olds. Firearm suicide has increased 139 percent
from 1933 to 1982 and is the leading method of suicide
in the 10 to 24-year-old group.
There are several suicide prevention efforts here.
Counseling and Psychological Services has mental
health consultants assigned to dorms on campus
during the regular school year. According to Daher, the
consultants' attention is focused on "good training of
people on the front lines — the resident assistants. We
want to make sure that people aren't falling through
the cracks."
Cowell Student Health Center has a counselor on
duty 24 hours a day to respond to student needs. The
Bridge, the University's peer counseling center, trains
its counselors how to respond to suicidal individuals.

"Young people need to know their
behavior is understandable, that
there are people out there who can
understand their feelings.
Suicidal feelings don't mean you
are crazy."

County Suicide Prevention and
Crisis Center

"There is a premise that if they're calling us, they are
asking for help," said peer counselor Sara Spears.
"There is the myth of the suicide call. It's not a per
son with a gun to his head. It's often someone who is
confused, reaching out, scared, numb, not feeling any
thing and needs to talk it out," Spears said.
Charlotte Ross, executive director of the Suicide Pre
vention and Crisis Center of San Mateo County, said
she is concerned that many young people are not com
ing to the attention of mental health professionals.
"Young people need to know their behavior is under
standable — that there are people out there who can
understand their feelings. Suicidal feelings don't mean
you are crazy. We are sort of in a mentality that if we
don't talk to them of depression and suicide, they won't
think about it," Ross said.
Ross encourages any student who knows of a suicidal
friend or acquaintance to take verbal messages very
seriously and to call Cowell or the county hotlines for
advice. There is sometimes a "double tragedy — some
one confides in a friend but pledges the friend to
secrecy," she said.
The San Mateo County 24-hour helpline is 367-8000.
The Santa Clara County 24-hour helpline is 494-8420.
