## 'Learned Ladies,' a Theatre Works success 
### DANIEL GRANT 
If Tonys were given to local
theater companies, Robert Kel
ley would be a likely contender
for one for his direction of
Theatre Work's "The Learned
Ladies."
His version of Moliere's 17th
century satire is brilliantly
updated to the women's suf
frage era, circa 1914, and is a
complete, innovative success.
Kelly's interpretation works
so well because of the striking
parallel between women of 17th
century France and early 20th
century America. In both cases,
the women are striving for
equality with men and the op
portunity for intellectual
growth and development.
As if a great reinterpretation
of Moliere and fine direction
weren't enough, Kelley is also
responsible (as is assistant di
rector Johanna Dickey) for the
songs that were added to the
comedy.

The brief, funny songs corre
spond very well with the action
on stage.
If "The Learned Ladies" has a
fault, it's that the plot is a bit
weak.
It concerns Clitandre, a
young, dashing, "Dudley Do
Right" type who wants to marry
Henriette, a simple and beauti
ful young lass.
Henriette's rich father ap
proves of their engagement, but
her bossy, overbearing mother,
Philaminte, has already made
plans to have Henriette
married to a greasy-haired in
tellectual named Trissotin.
Philaminte is a pseudointel
lectual and feels that it is more
important for her daughter to
be intellectually stimulated
than to be happy.
Love may conquer all, but it
creates havok in the household
as Philaminte fights to have
Henriette marry Tristotine and
her husband fights to keep the
two true lovers together.

The whole cast does a fine job,
but it is the "hired help" that
steals the show.
Richard Sherman plays the
part of L'Epine, the stuffy,
proper butler, to the hilt. He
has a wonderfully dry sense of
humor, is always ready with a
vistor's hat and cane when
they're being thrown out of the
house, and will hilariously
quaff his employer's liquor
when no one is looking.
Carla Vaughn does a wonder
ful characterization of the uned
ucated but kindhearted maid.
Her solo, "I Got Those Old Do
mestic Blues," is the highlight
of the show.
"The Learned Ladies" is a
unique and enjoyable play, al
though it should be noted that
Moliere has a style similiar to
Shakespeare in that the lines
end in rhyme and some words
are unusual. Once you get used
to this style, you're in for a
treat.


L'Epine the butler (Richard Sherman) gets a tongue lashing from
Belise (Ginger Drake) in Moliere's "The Learned Ladies," playing
through Sept. 12 at the Lucie Stern Theatre in Palo Alto.
