## 
### JAMES R. DICKEY Editorial staff 
This weekend, University Avenue will
be out of service.
Unlike the campus roads closed for
construction, downtown Palo Alto's most
famous avenue will be closed for party
ing.
The hosts of the occasion, the Down
town Palo Alto Art Fair Committee, are
sponsoring their sixth annual Palo Alto
Art and Wine Festival on University Av
enue between High and Webster streets.
The fair, acclaimed as one of Northern
California's finest, will feature crafts by
artisans from the Bay Area and the

world as well as a wide variety of food
and beverages.
Organizers described the event as an
excellent opportunity for the public to
enjoy the style of downtown Palo Alto in
an environment not usually available.
The fair's crafts exhibits will display a

unique mix of handmade items. Among
the pieces shown will be handblown
glass pieces by Santa Cruz's award
winning David Salazar and animal
shaped carved-wood furniture by Brad
Flaherty.
There will also be photographs,
handmade jewelry, calligraphied art and
wheat-woven items available.
There will be five different cafes serv
ing food, wine and
beverages. The food is being provided by
local restaurants and caterers.
Among the wines served will be
vintages from Felton Empire, Balverne
Vineyard and Sherrill Cellars â€” Palo

Alto's only winery. There will also be
Henry Winehard's and Moosehead beers
available for those with less elevated
tastes.
There will be entertainment at each of
the cafes and at the intersections.
Groups will be performing from 10 a.m.
to 6 p.m. each day.
Opening ceremonies will be conducted
Saturday at noon and a swing dance
competition will be held at 4 p.m. that
day.
The fair is open to the public and all
exhibits and entertainment is free. Com
memorative glasses cost $5, which in
cludes the price of the first glass of wine.
Refills cost $2 each.
