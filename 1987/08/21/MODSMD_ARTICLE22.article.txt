The Lost Boys ***
Century 10
1500 Stierlin Road, Mtn. View
If you're planning a trip to
Santa Cruz this summer, you
might want to think twice
about seeing "The Lost Boys" —
or about canceling your trip.
Set in the fictitious town of
Santa Carla, California, "Lost
Boys" opens with a shot of the
boardwalk in Santa Cruz.
\
Within minutes a group of
four young male vampires
make their first kill.

The Lost Boys" successfully
attempts to place an evil gang
of vampires in a modern set
ting.
They sleep all day, party all
night, ride motorcyles, kill a
few people and go back to sleep.
Unfortunately, the movie is
flawed when it falls back on
typical horror-genre violence
and attempts to combine a
"Goonies"-like teenage ad
venture with a classic vampire
story.
The end result is a humorous
and suspenseful film that un
doubtedly could have been bet
ter.

Can't Buy Me Love
Century 10
1500 Stierlin Road, Mtn. View
Money isn't everything.
That thought has nothing to
do with the plot of "Can't Buy
Me Love," a whimsical teenage
comedy about a boy who does
manage to buy love, popularity
and acceptance.
Patrick Dempsey is great as
the jock-wanna-be who couldn't
tell culture from cultures.
Then, in one of those coin
cidences writers seem to love,
he sees the head cheerleader,
played by Amanda Peterson, in
desperate need of money.

He seizes upon her moment of
desperation and persuades her
to pretend to be his girlfriend
for one month in exchange for
$1,000.
For some reason — or, more
likely, 1,000 reasons — she
agrees, and during the month
they spend together she teaches
him how to dress with style and
mousse his hair.
Presto — instant popularity!
What follows are some of the
best scenes of the movie — ones
that teach group dynamics bet
ter than any class ever could.
In addition, quite a few of the
scenes are really funny, as the
audience watches Dempsey

make a fool of himself and his
new "friends" in his attempt to
be "cool."
The movie does present some
very true and very powerful
messages, like the impact of
group opinion, the strength of
the desire to be popular and the
limits of friendship.
However, "Can't Buy Me
Love" manages to overplay
every one of those messages,
and most of them get lost in the
stereotypes and speeches.
This movie doesn't claim to be
thought-provoking or meaning
ful, and it's not. However, the
girl's cute, the good guys win
and the movie is fun.
