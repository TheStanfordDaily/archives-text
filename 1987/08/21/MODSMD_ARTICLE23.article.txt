## Look! Up in the sky! But hurry 'cause they're falling fast 
### 
For several months now, the St. Louis
Cardinals have been flying high atop the
National League's Eastern Division. So
high, in fact, that many midseason prog
nosticators were certain the Cards would
still be playing ball come October.

I'll admit, I too suspected that the Car
dinals would finish first. The reason that
I've waited this long to write about the
NL East is because I am from New York,
and was hoping against hope that the
Cardinals would falter. Then, I figured, I
could say, "Here come the Mets."
Lately, my wish has been coming true.
Not only are the Cardinals losing games,
but a certain World Series Champion
team has been playing really well lately.
It's been a long time since a team has
won back-to-back division titles (the last
team to do it was the 1980-81 Yankees),
let alone back-to-back World Series.

Still, the Mets seemed primed to at least
make an appearance in the League
Championship Series, and maybe even
win the whole thing.
On what do I base this prediction?
Many things actually. The first is the
strength of the Mets pitching.
This season the following Mets
pitchers have been lost for significant
periods of time: Bob Ojeda (elbow), Rick
Aguilera (elbow), Dwight Gooden (drug
rehab), Sid Fernandez (knee and
shoulder), David Cone (finger) and
Roger McDowell (hernia). Ojeda and
Aguilera have been out nearly all
season, McDowell missed spring train
ing and hasn't been consistent at all, and
when Cone started to pitch well he got
hit by a pitch and missed the last two
months.
But, there's a bright side to this. Cone
pitched brilliantly yesterday against the
Giants, Aguilera pitched seven scoreless
innings in the minors Wednesday while
feeling no pain and Fernandez is slated
to start on Sunday.
Add to this the fact that Ron Darling
has been sensational for the last month
and a half, Gooden has been fairly su
perb all year and Randy Myers has
emerged as the Mets bullpen stopper of

the future — if not the present.
Myers is in some ways symbolic of the
Mets season to this point. The people
who have kept them close are not always
the big names like Hernandez and
Carter. Instead, names like Leach, San
tana, Teufel, Mazilli and Johnson come
to mind.
Terry Leach is a 33-year-old jour
neyman minor leaguer who got to play
for the Mets this year only because of the
extensive injuries to the pitching staff.
All Leach did was win his first 10 deci
sions before finally losing one last week.
Rafael Santana has played excellent
defense at shortstop every year. This
year, though, he's batting over .270, 50
points above his career average.
Tim Teufel usually plays second base
only against lefties. But when Wally
Backaman went down with an injury in
June, Teufel went on a tear. He's still on
fire.
Lee Mazilli has filled in the outfield
and as a pinch hitter. He clearly
deserved a chance to play every day, but
manager Dave Johnson thought he'd be
more valuable coming off the bench. In
the era of inflated egos, Mazilli never
complained.
Howard Johnson came over in a trade

with the Tigers after the 1984 season.
Until this year Johnson didn't produce
and people continually second guessed
Mets General Manager Frank Cashen
for making the deal. This year, HoJo has
30 homers and 81 runs batted in. Suffice
it to say, the second guessing is over.
Cashen also helped the Mets out by ac
quiring Kevin Mcßeynolds last winter.
Mcßeynolds hits, hits for power runs,
throws, fields and never complains. This
guy is simply a star.
Oh, one familiar name has been a key
for the Mets this year. That name is Dar
ryl Strawberry. A few months ago, the
New York press was ready to trade him
for $3 and a minor leaguer to be named
later.
When they left Strawberry alone, he
quietly began to have the finest season
of his already excellent career. Straw
berry is batting .280, he has 74 RBI and
a career high 30 home runs, with 40
games left to play.
Considering all this, I think it's pretty
safe to say it: Here come the Mets.
