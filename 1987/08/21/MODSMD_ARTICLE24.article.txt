## 'Gay Liberation' statue marred 
### C.R. DOUGLAS Editorial staff 
George Segel's controversial statue "Gay
Liberation" was removed yesterday to repair
vandalism damage that occured early this
week. It is the second time since it was placed
on campus over three years ago that the statue
has been defaced.
According to an eyewitness, some time before
Tuesday a vandal had inscribed the acronym
"AIDS" in black spray paint on one of the male
figures.
The statue depicts two men standing next to
each other and two women seated on a park
bench.
Late yesterday, University President Donald
Kennedy's office granted a request from Art
History Prof. Albert Elsen — who was in
strumental in bringing the work to Stanford —
to temporarily remove the $150,000 statue so
that the spray paint could be cleaned off and the
surface could be repainted.
According to Elsen, the statue has needed

resurfacing from general wear and tear "for a
long time."
In March 1984, just two weeks after Segel's
statue was erected at the northern end of
Lomita Mall just west of the Mathematics De
partment, a vandal with a ball peen hammer
made almost 40 blows to the faces and bodies of
the four figures, damaging both the white
patina coating and the hard bronze core.
After the 1984 defacement, Segel, an interna
tionally renowned artist, had to give permission
for the sculpture to be recast.
When asked about the recent vandalism to
Segel's statue, Roland Van Gaalen, a gay
graduate student in statistics, said: "There are
always random nuts. I personally don't think it
is very important.
"Stanford has a very favorable climate for
gay and lesbian students. I don't think people
should get the wrong impression because of an
isolated act like this," he added.
The statue is on indefinite loan from the
owner, the Mildred Andrews Fund, until it is
approved for installation in the Harvey Milk
Plaza in San Francisco.
