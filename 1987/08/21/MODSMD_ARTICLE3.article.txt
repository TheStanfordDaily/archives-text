# Drug-test hearing postponed
## 
### BRIAN RHOADS Staff writer 
Stanford athletes must wait until Wednesday
for a ruling by the Santa Clara County Superior
Court on whether they can compete this season
without submitting to the NCAA drug-testing
program.
At the hearing, originally scheduled for today,
Judge Conrad Rushing will decide whether or not
to give Stanford athletes temporary permission
to compete without signing NCAA drug-testing
consent forms.
Rushing issued the July 20 ruling that allowed
Stanford to intervene officially in the suit filed by
Stanford students Jennifer Hill and Barry

McKeever. That suit challenges the con
stitutionality of the NCAA drug-testing policy.
In the hearing, attorneys for the University
will attempt to demonstrate that plaintiffs Hill
and McKeever, as well as Stanford athletes in
general, "are likely to suffer irreparable harm" if
a temporary restraining order is not issued al
lowing athletes to compete in NCAA events with
out signing drug-testing consent forms, said John
Schwatrz, vice president and general counsel for
the University.
The temporary restraining order would last
until a decision is reached on whether to grant a
preliminary injunction, giving the plaintiffs
permission to participate in
athletic events without signing
the forms while the con
stitutionality of the program is
decided.
Even though Wednesday's
hearing will not decide the
merits of drug testing, both
sides view it as important.
According to NCAA attorney
Kristina Hanson, "The effects of
a temporary restraining order
could have a harmful effect in

the sense that it weakens our
drug-testing program and the
athlete's requirements for
elegibility."
The granting of a temporary
restraining order is unneces
sary, Hanson said, because
"students will be missing only
the first game of the season."
However, because a prelimi
nary injunction requires longer
testimony, it could take as long
as 30 days before a final deci
sion is reached, Schwartz said.
As a result, Stanford athletes
might miss several competative
events by waiting for the pre
liminary injunction. "You can't

compensate an athlete for that,"
he added.
According to Schwartz, the
students face "irreparable
harm" because they either must
sign a "document that the court
has indicated is unconstitu
tional (the consent form), or not
participate in their sport."
"We will also ask the con
verse: does the restraining or
der hurt the the NCAA?"
Schwartz said. "We say no, be
cause the only time the athlete
can be drug tested is for a bowl
game or national competition."
Stanford attorneys will argue

that since post-season competi
tion is so far off, no damage to
the NCAA will occur with a
restraining order.
"If the court rules it constitu
tional later down the road, the
NCAA still has plenty of time to
implement drug testing," said
University attorney Debra
Zumwalt.
Stanford attorneys are hope
ful that the court will rule in
their favor because "it has pre
viously ruled that the program
is likely to be unconstitutional,
as has a court in Washington,"
Zumwalt said.

Stanford moved to intervene
in the case following the success
of a January lawsuit in which
Stanford diver Simone Levant
gained a preliminary injunction
from Superior Court Judge
Peter Stone allowing her to
compete without undergoing
NCAA drug testing while her
case was being tried.
LeVant argued that the drug
testing program was degrading
and invaded her right to
privacy under the California
Constitution. The injunction
was dissolved by agreement
May 11 because LeVant was a
graduating senior.
