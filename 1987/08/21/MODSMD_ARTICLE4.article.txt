# Board votes to delay animal facility again
## 
### SUSAN SLUSSER Editorial staff 
The Santa Clara County
Board of Supervisors responded
Tuesday to concerns of local
animal rights groups and
delayed a land-use permit for
Stanford's proposed Research
Animal Facility II for the
second time in less than a
month.
Consideration of a land-use
permit for RAF II will have to
wait until an environmental
impact report is done, the su
pervisors decided.
Because of the delay, Stan
ford could lose over $100,000 in
contracting fees and the cost of
the EIR, which could take five
months to a year to complete,
sources in the University ad
ministration said.
The University will try to
complete an EIR by the super
visors' Dec. 15 meeting, but
that would be "like running a
four-minute mile," said Larry
Horton, the University's associ
ate vice president for public af
fairs.
University project manager
Stephen Kyle Glenn said ear
lier estimates that the delay
will cost Stanford $5,000 per
week are "grossly underes
timated."
According to Supervisor
Diane McKenna, the California
Environmental Quality Act
states that if an EIR is re
quested and enough questions
are raised to indicate that a
public controversy is associated
with a land-use permit request,

then an EIR must be conducted.
"I'm sure that information
presented by the public must
have had an influence on our
counsel's recommendation,"
McKenna said.
On May 7, the Santa Clara
County Planning Commission
recommended unanimously
that the University be granted
a land-use permit for RAF 11,
but after an appeal by the Palo
Alto Humane Society, the
Board of Supervisors voted to
delay approval while investi
gating charges that Stanford
might conduct biohazardous ge
netic research in the facility.
On Aug. 12, the University
issued a lengthy response to 29
questions raised by the humane
society. But the supervisors, fol
lowing the advice of its legal
counsel, deemed that enough
controversy existed to make an
EIR necessary and voted 5-0
Tuesday to delay RAF II once
again.
"EIRs have been requested ad
nauseum at the federal and
state level for cities and towns
all over," said Chemistry Prof.
Paul Berg, a 1980 Nobel Prize
winner. "All have concluded
that the risks posed by these
types of facilities are insignifi
cant.
' Hundreds and hundreds of
recombinant DNA experiments
have been done all over, and a
very large body of experience
shows no evidence of any risks
associated with the types of ex
periments done at Stanford —
I'd say that categorically," he
added.
Berg, who spoke on Stanford's
behalf at the hearing, told the
supervisors that the dangers
posed by genetic research in
volving animals at RAF II
would be minimal and that op
portunities for major medical
breakthroughs are possible
through animal research.
"Somehow, the supervisors
were not impressed," he said.
"They're still back in the 1970s
with vague ideas that recom
binant DNA means danger.
They admitted they didn't un
derstand it, and they felt an
EIR was necessary."
Humane society representa
tives were happy with the deci
sion. "What we wanted was an
impact report, and that's what
we got," said Helen McClosky,
humane society president. "I
think an environmental impact
report is something that the
public is owed. I'm very pleased
— I think the decision was a
very smart one."
According to McClosky, the
humane society would still like
to see a representative from
their group placed on the Uni
versity Animal Care and Use
Committee.
"We don't object to having a
humane society representative
on our panel," said Thomas
Hamm, director of laboratory
animal medicine. "We already
have one. We do object to
having someone opposed to
animal research at Stanford on
our panel, and we really object
to having outside people ap
pointing members to our com
mittee."
