# City Council task force to study Sand Hill link
## News 
### JAMES LIN Staff writer 
A controversial project to extend Sand
Hill Road to El Camino Real moved a
step forward Monday when the Palo Alto
City Council approved the formation of a
six-member task force to examine the
feasibility of the extension.
The task force, composed of two repre
sentatives each from Stanford, Palo Alto
and Menlo Park, will meet to discuss rel
evant issues and construct a tentative
work plan for the project, said Palo Alto
Mayor Gail Woolley, who will serve on
the committee.

The task force must still be approved
by the Menlo Park City Council before it
can begin its work.
The work plan, which will be drafted
in coordination with a hired consultant,
is intended to precede any actual con
struction proposals, Woolley said.
"It's a very preliminary step," she
added, noting that task force suggestions
will be purely advisory and that the
group will act primarily as a sounding
board for the particular needs and inter
ests of the three communities involved.
Woolley estimated it will take at least
six months to create a work
plan for the extension and
proposals and environmental
impact reports may extend the
date of construction two years
beyond that.
Traffic between Sand Hill
and El Camino is currently
routed through the parking lot
of Stanford Shopping Center.
"We have a major arterial
road ending in the middle of a
shopping center," said Univer
sity Vice President for Public

Affairs Bob Freelen, adding
that the roadway also serves as
an entrance to the Stanford
Hospital.
Two previous proposals to
build a connecting road encoun
tered serious opposition by resi
dents of Palo Alto and Menlo
Park. In the most recent objec
tion, residents of Menlo Park
claimed that further studies on
the environmental impact of
the roadway were needed before
the proposal could be accepted.
Meetings of the task force
will be open to the public and
will be advertised in advance,
said Andrew Doty, director of
community relations for the

University.
However, Palo Alto City
Council member Ellen Fletcher,
who voted against the task
force, expressed concern that
public participation in the plan
ning process would be decreased
by not having the issue dis
cussed by the full council.
"I felt that the work on the
whole concept should be done in
as much of a public forum as
possible," Fletcher said. "The
public is not as fully aware as it
is with issues that occur with a
full council."
Fletcher noted that normal
council meetings are broadcast
over the radio and that minutes

of the discussion are made and
kept for reference. "That isn't
going to happen in this case,"
she said.
Doty predicted that the task
force will appear on the Menlo
Park council's agenda within
the next few weeks and said he
thought approval was likely.
Jan La Fetra, a member of
the Menlo Park City Council
and the task force, agreed that
the council will probably ap
prove the task force but ex
pressed doubts that progress
beyond that point world be fast
or effective.
"I cannot be terribly optimis
tic," she said. "It's a political

football, but I'm not looking for
a touchdown."
La Fetra emphasized that the
purpose of the task force is ex
ploratory.
"I hope that we can do some
exploring of ideas, get some
background information. The
original fact and idea-getting is
best done in a very informal set
ting," she said.
"I'd like to see it done over a
kitchen table with a cup of cof
fee."
According to Wooley, city
leadership of the task force is
necessary because of the high
cost of the project, which will re
quire state funding for which
Stanford is ineligible.
