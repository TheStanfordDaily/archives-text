# Soil pollution discussed

Department of Health Services pre
liminary studies of carcinogenic
chemical vapors in the soil near
Matedero Creek provided no new in
dications as to the source of chemical
spills in the creek but did narrow the
areas where contamination most
likely occurred, DHS officials said last
night.
The DHS discussed its findings last
night at a meeting of the Palo Alto
Hazardous Material Coordinating
Council, a group comprised of commu
nity residents, local government offi
cials and Stanford representatives.

Howard Hatayama of the DHS said
the preliminary studies are tools for
finding where the problem sites are
and not for determining direct concen
tration numbers. The data was taken
only from the shallowest aquifer,
which is not the source of Palo Alto's
back-up water supply.
Hatayama cautioned that the
results are only indicators for further
investigation. "Take what we say with
a grain of salt," he said.
The screening, which cost over
$40,000, involved testing 196 data
points regularly between July 6 and
20, Hatayama said. The DHS started
at the Watkins-Johnson site at
the base of Matadero Creek and
moved upstream.
The DHS concurrently tested
private wells in the Barron
Park area.
During the second phase of
the study, the DHS retested 14
sites in the area of the Stanford
Industrial Park that yielded in
itial indications of contamina
tion. Twelve of those sites are in
the Barron Park area, said DHS
Project Officer Alan Lui.
The retesting was finished
Wednesday, but no report has
yet been released, Hatayama
said.
The soil gas study identified
the boundaries of groundwater
contamination. A chemical in
vapor form tends to rise to the
surface between the soil parti
cles, Lui said. DHS surveyors
planted hollow metal probes, an
inch in diameter and open on
the end, five feet into the
ground. The probes are used as

a straw to suck up the vapors.
The level of contamination is
measured in micrograms per
liter of air and has no direct cor
relation to the previous meas
urements of water contamina
tion in parts per million, Lui
said.
Also discussed at the meeting
were the latest results of the in
vestigation of water and soil
contamination at the Aydin
plant in Palo Alto.
Aydin, located in Stanford In
dustrial Park, investigated the
soil and water around its re
search plant after receiving a
joint order with Stanford from
the DHS in May 1986. Stanford
did not respond to the order.
Steve Nelson, a civil engineer
involved in the investigation,
said he discovered polychlor
inated biphenyls in vertical
deposits running down to the
ground water table. The pos
sibly cancer-causing chemicals
did not spread laterally but fol
lowed the flow of the stream,
Nelson said.
Nelson said he is waiting for
DHS approval to conduct addi
tional site investigations.
