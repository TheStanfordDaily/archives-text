Reagan to meet with contra leaders
SANTA BARBARA, Calif. — President Reagan, still
smarting from conservative attacks on his Central America
peace proposals, will meet next week in Los Angeles with
Nicaraguan resistance leaders in a public show of support for
the contras, the White House said yesterday.
The session, to be held on Thursday, will include talks with
both the rebels' six-member political directorate and their
military general commander, Enrique Bermudez, White
House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said.
Reagan met with the six political leaders only two weeks
ago, on Aug. 5, but the Los Angeles gathering will be his first
face-to-face meeting with the rebels' military chief.
The meeting appears likely to draw demonstrations on both
sides of the Central America peace issue.
Fitzwater said the session will review the United States
and contra positions on peace negotiations in the region and
the state of the contra war inside Nicaragua, which faces a
cutoff of American military aid on Sept. 30.
"Make no mistake about it: We want to demonstrate to the
conservative leaders and to the, (contra) directorate . . . that
the president will not desert the contras," Fitzwater added.
Cause of plane crash is still unclear
ROMULUS, Mich. — Conflicting evidence began to build
yesterday as to whether the cockpit crews' failure to deploy
wing flaps and slats on takeoff caused the crash of Northwest
Airlines Flight 255.
John Lauber, head of the National Transportation Safety
Board investigation of the crash said last night that a new
witness — the pilot of another Northwest flight — stated
"very positively" that the flaps of the ill-fated MD-80 jetliner
were deployed during its entire acceleration and liftoff prior
to the crash that took least 154 lives Sunday night.
Lauber said that while all the flaps and wing structures of
the stricken jet have been collected for examination by inves
tigators, it is still too early to say whether the flaps were
deployed correctly.
"What we have learned is that we have a lot of work to do,"
Lauber said.
He said the new witness was a Northwest co-pilot who was
waiting in line to take off after flight 255, which was bound
for Phoenix and John Wayne Airport in Southern California.
CDC: Test hospital patients for AIDS
WASHINGTON — Federal health officials yesterday
issued guidelines that suggest for the first time that hospital
patients be tested for the AIDS virus.
The recommendation by the federal Centers for Disease
Control departs from its policy of advising against
widespread AIDS testing in the nation's hospitals. But in
releasing new standards for protecting the nation's 6.5 mil
lion health care workers from the spread of the HIV virus, the
agency "noted the need for health care workers to consider all
patients as potentially infected with HIV."
"This is a compromise really," said Dr. Harold Jaffe, chief
of the epidemiology branch of the CDC's AIDS program.
"There is no real data to suggest that testing would increase
the safety of health care workers. But the reality is that some
AIDS testing has already begun and this document attempts
to assure that it will not result in the denial of treatment to
those who test positive."
Anxiety about contracting the virus has risen sharply
among health care workers since the CDC reported May 21
that three women working in hospitals had been infected
with the HIV virus after each was accidentially splashed with
the blood of infected patients.
So. African firms begin firing miners
JOHANNESBURG, South Africa — Three of South
Africa's mining companies, adopting tougher tactics to deal
with a strike by black miners, began firing thousands of the
strikers yesterday when they refused to return to work in the
country's gold mines.
Anglo American Corp., hit hardest by the strike, dismissed
more than 2,000 strikers at one shaft of its sprawling Vaal
Reefs mine at Orkney, about 100 miles southwest of Johan
nesburg, when they rejected an ultimatum to go back to work.
Anglo American said the shaft would be closed and the jobs
lost.
Anglo American warned 4,000 more strikers at a second
mine, a shaft at Western Holdings in the Orange Free State,
that they, too, would be fired and their jobs abolished if they
did not return to work today and accept the management's
pay package.
The miners voted to continue their strike, according to the
National Union of Mineworkers, and 18,000 other miners at
the complex said they would leave with those dismissed in a
show of solidarity.
The mineworkers union is asking for a 30 percent across
the-board pay increase. The companies offered raises of 15
percent to 23 percent, which they implemented unilaterally
last month, declaring the issue closed.
