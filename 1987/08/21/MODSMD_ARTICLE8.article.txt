## The 						Stanford Daily An Independent Newspaper Editor's farewell 
### 
Everyone at The Daily seems to be looking toward the fu
ture. There is little talk of "that's the way it's always been
done" and more discussion about how we can improve our or
ganization and serve our community better.
This, I think, is a result of the people who've worked here
this summer. Our writers, editors, sales representatives and
managers have taken a real interest in strengthening The
Daily.
Long nights have been spent here this summer after the
production of each issue, talking about our mistakes and how
to prevent them in the future. (Late at night, it seems you
can solve every problem.) Even longer days have been spent
working on reorganizing our operations and organizing our
newspaper.
The hard work of the summer will pay off in the fall. The
vast majority of the summer staff will be returning, so those
things we've brought to The Daily will continue and those
things we've learned will not be lost.
The summer Daily is meant to be a training ground — and
this year that has proved to be the case more than ever. Many
of us stepped into our positions in June with little knowledge
and experience, but it took no time at all for us to start put
ting out the best summer Daily in years.
We've worked hard to meet our goals of providing solid
news coverage and a comprehensive entertainment section.
We've laid the groundwork for the new Inside department,
which will continue to deal with some of the most important
issues at Stanford.
We've been pleased that the community has taken a real
interest in The Daily this summer. People are helpful and in
terested in our news coverage, we received a variety of letters
to the editor, and several people have joined the staff.
And, once again, The Daily is a morning newspaper. We
will work to continue to improve when The Daily returns
next quarter.
For now, we're going to celebrate our successes, consider
our failures and have a chewable vitamin C.
