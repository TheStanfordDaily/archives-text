Major:lndustrial Engineering.â€žsort of
Welcome back to the farm and all
that stuff. So...are you all set for
school? Got those pencils sharpened
and those binders full of fresh,
white college-ruled paper? I hope
not. You don't want to seem too
anxious. Anyway...you're probably
wondering why Chris and I are here.
No reason, really, except we're the
new student managers at The
Store....which, by the way, had a
facelift over the summer. Have
you seen it? It's wild. (I hope you
guys like green.) That's why I've
got the camera. To snap pictures of
The Store. Now if Chris would just
let me take his picture in front of
the cool new refrigerated section...
