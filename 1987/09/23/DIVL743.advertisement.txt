Take out a box of ribs. And not just any ribs.The best ■
ribs in the Bay Area, as voted by San Francisco Fonts ■
magazine readers.The leanest, juiciest baby back ribs,
marinated for 24 hours, oakwood smoked, and sizzled
over a hot mesquite fire. So drop by or call ahead. We'll
even supply the extra napkins.
