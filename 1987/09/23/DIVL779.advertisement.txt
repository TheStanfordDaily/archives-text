Think again.
Since January 1987, AT&T's
rates have dropped more than
15% for direct-dialed out-of

can call us at 1 800 222-0300.
And AT&T offers clear long
distance connections, operator
assistance, 24-hour customer
service, and immediate credit
for wrong numbers. Plus, you
can use AT&T to call from
anywhere to anywhere, all over
the United States and to over
250 countries.
You might be surprised at
how good a value AT&T really
is. So before you choose a
long distance company, pick
up the phone.
