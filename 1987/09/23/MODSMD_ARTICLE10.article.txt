# From horses to higher education
## Little Lelands's living legacy 
### 
When David Starr Jordan arrived at Stan
ford in the summer of 1891 to be the Univer
sity's first president, he found the countryside
enthralling.
"The Santa Clara Valley," he wrote in his
autobiography, "extends southward 50 miles
and more from near the head of San Francisco
Bay. Bounding it on the southwest rises . . .
the Sierra de la Santa Cruz — 'a misty camp of
mountains pitched tumultously. . . .
"Immediately behind the University estate
and forming its higher background is the
wooded Sierra Morena, its cloak of redwood,
oak and madrono diversified by thickets of
chemisal. . . .
"On the east, opposing the green ridges of
the Holy Cross, stretches the long, relatively
barren and treeless Sierra del Monte Diablo."
In this sheltered area 30 miles south of San
Francisco, its favorable climate assured by its
location between bay and ocean, its meadows
patterned with ancient oaks, Sen. Leland
Stanford and his wife, Jane, established a uni
versity on the site of their home in Palo Alto.
The first parcel of land, bought in 1876,
consisted of 650 acres along San Francisquito
Creek. Subsequent purchases increased the
total to 8250 acres.
All of the Stanfords' land was deeded to the
University in the school's 1885 Grant of En
dowment with the stipulation that it should
never be sold.
To plan construction of the university he
envisioned, Sen. Stanford in the summer of
1886 brought then-MIT President Francis
Walker and prominent landscape architect
Frederick Law Olmsted to Palo Alto.

They gave serious thought to locating the
campus in the foothills of the Stanford ranch,
so as to take advantage of the magnificent
view of the Bay, but finally decided to locate
the school in the grainfields below. The
Senator felt the flat site would be more practi
cal for later expansion.
Olmsted worked out a general plan for the
grounds and buildings, but it remained for the
young Boston architect, Charles Allerton
Coolidge, to develop this concept in the style
of his late mentor, Henry Hobbs Richardson,
considered the most eminent architect of his
time.
Stanford's architectural style is called Rich
ardsonian Romanesque, and it follows the
European Romanesque, which is character
ized by rectilinear stone buildings joined by
covered arcades formed of successive half
circle arches supported by short columns with
decorated capitals.
The Inner Quad of 12 classroom buildings
— with the central place reserved for the fu
ture Memorial Church — and three engineer
ing buildings, Encina Hall for men and Roble
Hall for women, were ready for the Univer
sity's opening on Oct. 1, 1891.
"These long corridors with their stately pil
lars," Jordan said at the dedication, "will have
their part in the students' training. Each stone
in the quadrangle shall teach its lesson of
grace and genuineness."
President Andrew White of Cornell
pronounced the Stanford buildings the most
beautiful college architecture in America.
Just before 5 a.m. on the morning of April
18, 1906, the ground beneath Stanford's new

buildings shook vigorously for nearly a min
ute. The great earthquake of 1906, which
resulted in the near total destruction of down
town San Francisco, killed two men on
campus and caused millions of dollars of
damage to the young university.
The ponderous tower of Memorial Church,
with its clocks, chimes and spire, crashed into
the chancel, and the concussion blew out the
front wall. The rose window and the huge
Venetian mosaic of the Sermon on the Mount
that had graced the facade lay as rubble in the
Inner Quad.
Memorial Arch, the central structure of the
Outer Quad — 100 feet high and decorated
with a frieze depicting the march of civiliza
tion — was damaged beyond repair. So were a
library and a gymnasium that had been just
short of completion. None of these were
replaced.
Reconstruction cost more than $2 million.
Classes were dismissed until the fall. Seniors
in what has come to be known as "the Earth
quake Class" were voted their degrees in
May.
It was a setback, but only a temporary one,
for the young university quickly rebuilt,
pursuing a construction project that was
begun in 1886 and has continued to the pres
ent day.
Construction of the University has taken
place on approximately 5000 acres reserved
by the Board of Trustees for educational uses.
This land is the heart of the Stanford holdings,
running generally from El Camino to the

Foothills.
The areas designated for "light
use' include the arboretum area
between the Quad and El Camino
and the Foothill lands used for
space-probing antennae and re
search in nuclear physics and bio
logical sciences.
The Inner and Outer Quads oc
cupy 17 acres at the University's
heart. The Inner Quad's 12 class
room buildings, two of which are
now used by the president and his
staff, date from the time the Uni
versity opened in 1891. The
Outer Quad was completed in
1903, the same year that Memo
rial Church was dedicated.
The size and prominence of
Memorial Church in the inner
Quad reflects the Stanfords' deep
religious faith, even though they
were followers of no particular
denomination. In the University's

Founding Grant, the Stanfords
directed the trustees "to have
taught in the University the im
mortality of an all-wise and
benevolent Creator, and that
obedience to His laws is the high
est duty of man."
To serve the widest needs of
the campus community, they
decreed that the church and the
University were to be nonsec
tarian and at no time tied to any
particular denomination.
In the original plans of the Uni
versity, the central site in the
Quad was reserved for the
church, though construction was
deferred for several years. When
Sen. Stanford died in 1893, his
widow ordered that the church be
built as a memorial to him.
Jane Stanford chose the final
designs for windows and mosaics,
traveling to Italy to approve the
mosaic sketches, and obtaining
papal permission to copy the
Roseili fresco of the "Last Sup
per" in the Sistine Chapel.
The Venetian mosaics that

cover the interior walls are largely
drawn from the Old Testament,
depicting the history of redemp
tion. The largest mosaic, how
ever, occupying most of the
facade of the church and contain
ing 47 figures, depicts the Sermon
on the Mount.
After the earthquake of 1906,
the stucture was completely dis
mantled and rebuilt around a
steel framework. Another set of
mosaics was brought from
Venice, but the 80-foot spire,
housing clocks and chimes, was
never rebuilt.
The campus landmark, 285-
foot Hoover Tower, was dedi
cated at the University's 50th an
niversary in 1941. The tower and
the adjoining Lou Henry Hoover
Building (opened in 1967) house
the vast documentary collections
of the Hoover Institution on War,
Revolution and Peace — millions
of items that include books, docu
ments, files, manuscripts, diaries,

pamphlets, posters, maps and
photos. The Herbert Hoover
Memorial Building, completed in
1978, honors the former presi
dent's humanitarian works.
Herbert Hoover started the li
brary collection during World
War 1 when he headed the Com
mission for Relief in Belgium.
Struck with the thought that his
relief work placed him in a posi
tion to document the war, Hoover
shipped crates of material to the
library at Stanford, his alma
mater, and laid the literary foun
dation of the Hoover Institution.
At the 1941 ceremony, Hoover
said: "The purpose of this institu
tion is to promote peace. Its
records stand as a challenge to
those who promote war. They
should attract those who search
for peace."
The institution has more mate
rial on communism than can be

found anywhere outside the So
viet Union. It has more data on
Mussolini than can be found in
Italy. It also probably has the
most complete record on Hitler
and the Nazi movement in exis
tence today.
With these resources, the insti
tution serves as a center for ad
vanced study and research on
problems of social, political and
economic change in the 20th cen
tury.
Across from Hoover Tower sits
Memorial Hall Auditorium, dedi
cated in 1937. Built primarily
through student contributions as
a memorial to Stanford students
and faculty slain in World War I,
the auditorium also houses
plaques honoring the Stanford
dead of World War 11, the
Korean conflict and the Vietnam
War. The main auditorium seats
1700 and the Little Theater seats
200.
Just south of the Quad is White
Memorial Plaza, a 200,000-
square-foot landscaped area

donated to the University by Mr.
and Mrs. Raymond White in
memory of their sons. The focal
point of the plaza is a tall, free
form fountain executed in bronze
by San Francisco sculptor Aris
tides Demetrios. Students call it
"the Claw."
Bordered by the Bookstore,
post office, Tresidder Memorial
Union, the music building and the
Old Union — which contains
several student services — the
plaza is a campus crossroads.
The Stanford School of
Medicine moved from San Fran
cisco into its present quarters on
the west side of campus in 1959.
The $21 million structure consists
of three sections —the hospital,
the outpatient clinics and the
teaching laboratories and class
rooms.
The Stanford Law School has
been housed in Crown Quad
rangle since September 1975,
when President Ford dedicated
the $ 1 1.9-million facility. The

school consists of four buildings:
the Robert Crown Library, which
can seat the entire law student
body at the same time; Frederick
I. Richman Hall, which contains
the classrooms and moot court;
the James Irvine Gallery, which
contains the faculty and student
meeting rooms and lounges; and
600-seat Kresge Auditorium.
Behind the central campus, the
University operates its science
"farms," the oldest of which is the
Jasper Ridge Biological Preserve.
Rising steeply from Searsville

Lake, the 735-acre preserve con
tains a unique association of rock
ledges and outcroppings, oak
dotted savannahs, chaparral, red
woods, streams and pools. The
preserve is used regularly for
teaching.
The Radioscience Laboratory
conducts at its antenna farm in
the Stanford foothills one of the
most productive and varied pro
grams of ionosperic and inter
planetary radio investigation. Its
scientists made the first radar
contact with the sun.

The most spectacular of the an
tennae, the 70-ton, 150-foot
diameter steel and aluminum
"Dish," has explored the sun,
planets and interplanetary gases
by through those of a radar beam.
The Stanford Linear Ac
celerator Center (SLAC) oper
ates a two-mile-long atom smas
her on 460 acres along Sand Hill
Road. The $1 14 million machine,
financed by the Atomic Energy
Commission and completed in
1966, fires the tube rather than
whirling protons in circles, as
most atom smashers do. The ma
chine develops an energy of 20
billion electon volts.
In the last 20 years, the Univer
sity has raised some $325 million
to pay for new campus facilites
and improvements, including
campus landmarks such as
Maples Pavilion, Meyer Library,
the Green Library annex, the
Terman Engineering Center, the
Mudd Chemistry Building, Sweet
Hall, the Center for Integrated
Systems and Braun Music Center.
