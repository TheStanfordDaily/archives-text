# From horses to higher education
## Little Lelands's living legacy 
### 
When David Starr Jordan arrived at Stan
ford in the summer of 1891 to be the Univer
sity's first president, he found the countryside
enthralling.
"The Santa Clara Valley," he wrote in his
autobiography, "extends southward 50 miles
and more from near the head of San Francisco
Bay. Bounding it on the southwest rises . . .
the Sierra de la Santa Cruz — 'a misty camp of
mountains pitched tumultously. . . .
"Immediately behind the University estate
and forming its higher background is the
wooded Sierra Morena, its cloak of redwood,
oak and madrono diversified by thickets of
chemisal. . . .
"On the east, opposing the green ridges of
the Holy Cross, stretches the long, relatively
barren and treeless Sierra del Monte Diablo."
In this sheltered area 30 miles south of San
Francisco, its favorable climate assured by its
location between bay and ocean, its meadows
patterned with ancient oaks, Sen. Leland
Stanford and his wife, Jane, established a uni
versity on the site of their home in Palo Alto.
The first parcel of land, bought in 1876,
consisted of 650 acres along San Francisquito
Creek. Subsequent purchases increased the
total to 8250 acres.
All of the Stanfords' land was deeded to the
University in the school's 1885 Grant of En
dowment with the stipulation that it should
never be sold.
To plan construction of the university he
envisioned, Sen. Stanford in the summer of
1886 brought then-MIT President Francis
Walker and prominent landscape architect
Frederick Law Olmsted to Palo Alto.

They gave serious thought to locating the
campus in the foothills of the Stanford ranch,
so as to take advantage of the magnificent
view of the Bay, but finally decided to locate
the school in the grainfields below. The
Senator felt the flat site would be more practi
cal for later expansion.
Olmsted worked out a general plan for the
grounds and buildings, but it remained for the
young Boston architect, Charles Allerton
Coolidge, to develop this concept in the style
of his late mentor, Henry Hobbs Richardson,
considered the most eminent architect of his
time.
Stanford's architectural style is called Rich
ardsonian Romanesque, and it follows the
European Romanesque, which is character
ized by rectilinear stone buildings joined by
covered arcades formed of successive half
circle arches supported by short columns with
decorated capitals.
The Inner Quad of 12 classroom buildings
— with the central place reserved for the fu
ture Memorial Church — and three engineer
ing buildings, Encina Hall for men and Roble
Hall for women, were ready for the Univer
sity's opening on Oct. 1, 1891.
"These long corridors with their stately pil
lars," Jordan said at the dedication, "will have
their part in the students' training. Each stone
in the quadrangle shall teach its lesson of
grace and genuineness."
President Andrew White of Cornell
pronounced the Stanford buildings the most
beautiful college architecture in America.
Just before 5 a.m. on the morning of April
18, 1906, the ground beneath Stanford's new

buildings shook vigorously for nearly a min
ute. The great earthquake of 1906, which
resulted in the near total destruction of down
town San Francisco, killed two men on
campus and caused millions of dollars of
damage to the young university.
The ponderous tower of Memorial Church,
with its clocks, chimes and spire, crashed into
the chancel, and the concussion blew out the
front wall. The rose window and the huge
Venetian mosaic of the Sermon on the Mount
that had graced the facade lay as rubble in the
Inner Quad.
Memorial Arch, the central structure of the
Outer Quad — 100 feet high and decorated
with a frieze depicting the march of civiliza
tion — was damaged beyond repair. So were a
library and a gymnasium that had been just
short of completion. None of these were
replaced.
Reconstruction cost more than $2 million.
Classes were dismissed until the fall. Seniors
in what has come to be known as "the Earth
quake Class" were voted their degrees in
May.
It was a setback, but only a temporary one,
for the young university quickly rebuilt,
pursuing a construction project that was
begun in 1886 and has continued to the pres
ent day.
Construction of the University has taken
place on approximately 5000 acres reserved
by the Board of Trustees for educational uses.
This land is the heart of the Stanford holdings,
running generally from El Camino to the
