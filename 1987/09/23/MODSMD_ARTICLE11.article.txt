# Annual Draw determines placement
## Residence roulette a hallowed rite of spring 
### David Cline 
Every spring quarter, in the midst of great
weather and 13-unit class loads, Stanford students
must face the annual housing draw.
The mere mention of those two ominous words,
"the Draw," are enough to send some students into
convulsions.
The reason for this is simple: there is not enough
on-campus housing to go around.
Since as long ago as the 1930s there has been a
housing crunch at Stanford. "The demand for
housing has always exceeded supply," according to
Asst. Dean of Student Affairs Rodger Whitney,
who is also director of the Housing Center. But
never has the problem been more critical than in the
past two decades.
In 1968, there were 300 students on the waiting
list for campus housing after the second round of the
Draw. By 1972, that number had climbed to over
700.
What created this sharp increase in demand for
on-campus housing?
"Basically, it was two factors," Whitney said.
"First of all, the cost of off-campus housing rose
considerably. Second, on-campus housing became
more desirable."
Average rent in Palo Alto skyrocketed in the
early 19705. A University study showed there was
only one apartment in the area available at even
close to the price of on-campus housing. Over the
next few years, virtually no affordable off-campus
apartments were available.
While housing prices increased, there were many
changes taking place on campus. Students became
more vocal in their opposition to the University's
social restrictions and in their desire for more
housing options. As a result, the administration

commissioned the Study of Education at Stanford
(SES) in 1967.
SES — composed of over 100 faculty members
and students — conducted a comprehensive two
year review of the University which culminated in a
set of recommendations to the Board of Trustees.
These 1968 recommendations, instrumental in
making on-campus housing more desirable, were
numerous. They supported co-ed housing, sugges
ted eliminating social restrictions such as curfews for
students, favored more academically oriented and
theme-related houses and pushed for an increased
role for resident fellows and resident assistants.
Within months, the trustees approved the entire list
of recommendations.
To incorporate these new housing options, the
student housing draw (as we know it today) began.
The 1968 draw resembled the present one in ail
but a few ways.
While students can now draw in groups of up to
eight, back then no more than three were allowed to
draw together — and all the draw partners in a
group had to be of the same sex.
Co-ed drawing was first allowed a few years later.
In 1974 additional changes were made in the
Draw. The computer program used by the Housing
Center was created that year and the trustees estab
lished a policy of guaranteeing students three years
of on-campus housing. Previously, students had
been guaranteed on-campus housing only their first
year.
With the creation of academic and ethnic theme
houses in 1981 and the completion of Governor's
Corner the next year, the Draw was again modified.
The latest alteration came in 1983 when the number
pool was split, with guaranteed students drawing
from numbers up to 3,000 and unguaranteed stu

dents drawing from numbers over 3,000.
The next major change in the Draw will be ex
tending the housing guarantee to include all four
years of undergraduate study, Whitney said.
However, that won't happen until adequate new

housing is built, and that will he some time from
now.
The Draw is likely here to stay, meanwhile, add
ing stress and anxiety to those otherwise idyllic
spring quarters.
