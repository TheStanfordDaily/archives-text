# Jordan program targets talent, draws fire

Stanford, an institution that
never seems to stop putting up
new buildings, recently erected a
new program in its Office of Un
dergraduate Admissions: the Jor
dan Scholars Program.
Named for the University's first
president, David Starr Jordan,
the program formally recognized
200 freshmen admitted last April
as best meeting the admissions
criteria of academic excellence
and adherence to the University's
fundamental standards, according
to Jean Fetter, dean of Under
graduate Admissions.
Of those 200 applicants who
received extra-thick envelopes
last spring, 76 will be coming to
the Farm this week. That number
represents a 38 percent yield (the
percentage of those granted ad

mission who enroll) which is tar
below the overall class yield. That
overall yield has ranged between
60 and 64 percent during the past
decade, and was 60 percent for
the class of '91.
However, Freshman Admis
sions Director John Bunnell said
the yield for those students
honored with a Jordan Scholar
ship compared favorably with the
yield of 43 percent for the top
600 admittees.
Part of the reason for establish
ing the new distinction for incom
ing students was to help Stanford
compete with universities that of
fer merit-based financial aid
packages.
"One of the concerns at Stan
ford is that we offer admission to
fine students, and a number of
them choose not to come because
they've been offered financial aid

elsewhere," Fetter said.
According to Robert Huff, di
rector of Financial Aids, the in
crease in merit-based financial
aid at competing universities has
made it difficult for Stanford to
continue offering only need
based aid and still attract top
flight applicants. Need-based aid
has risen by as much as one-third
in recent years at some four-year
institutions.
According to University offi
cials, Stanford has resisted imple
menting merit-based scholarships
because it does not want to get
into the business of "buying" stu
dents based on their academic
qualifications.
All Jordan Scholars received
only a certificate — no financial
awards — and those who do
matriculate this fall will be
honored further with a few low-

year.
While the Office of Undergrad
uate Admissions is generally con
tent with the program, the new
Jordan awards have recieved less
then enthusiastic comment from
students and faculty.
Soon after the program was an
nounced last spring, many oppo
nents — mostly students —
argued in letters to The Daily that
the awards would threaten the
University's tradition of equality
among incoming freshman.

Furthermore, they contended,
a selective program such as this
undermines the values of the Uni
versity by creating a hierarchy
among freshmen from the mo
ment they set foot on campus.
One student, Katie Albiston,
who graduated in June, expressed
her disagreement with the pro
gram in a letter to The Daily last
April.
"The distinction alone is inade
quate. Perhaps we could build a
special David Starr Jordan Li
brary, exclusively for the use of

the scholars. (The scholars)
should also be permitted to sign
up for classes first each quarter.
Each scholar should be provided
with his or her own personal Mac
intosh," Albiston wrote.
University President Donald
Kennedy has admitted on at least
one occasion that he is "semi
uncomfortable" with the new
freshman distinction.
"The message (of the Jordan
Scholarships) is somewhat incon
sistent," Kennedy said in a
campus radio interview in May.
"You want to signal your attach
ment to academic values by
recognizing strong achievement
and strong potential where it oc
curs. You are also creating at
least the impression of an elite,
whereas in fact in your financial
aid policy you're explicitly declin
ing to create an elite."
