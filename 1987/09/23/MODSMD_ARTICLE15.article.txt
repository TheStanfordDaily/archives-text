# Card led by Heisman hopeful Muster
## 
### Susan Slusser 
The slogan for Stanford football this
season is "The Tradition Continues," and
the banner season the Cardinal had in
1986 — including the team's first winning
record since 1980 and its first bowl appear
ance since 1978 — would be a nice tradi
tion to continue.
In fact, Coach Jack Elway would like to
do even better this year. Whether or not he
does will depend largely on the perform
ance of senior tailback Brad Muster. The
keystone of Stanford's offense and widely
touted as a Heisman Trophy candidate.
Muster sprained his left ankle on the first
day of fall practice. He aggravated the in
jury only a few series into the team's
season opener at Washington Sept. 5.
Muster's status is listed as "day-to-day."
Without Muster, the Cardinal will be
hard-pressed to match last year's success.
And with or without Muster, but espe
cially without him, the Cardinal will rely
heavily on its defense.
In years past, it was offense that earned
the Cardinal invitations to bowl games, but
the guys on the other side of the ball kept
the team in the race for postseason play in
1986, allowing only 14.9 points per game
and forcing 32 turnovers.
The defense keyed several victories and
kept the team close in narrow losses to
Washington. USC and California.
Several key members of last year's
defense are gone, however. Team leader
Dave Wyman is rooming with fellow
Seahawk linebacker Brian Bosworth in
Seattle, tackle Tony Leikerisin Green Bay
playing for the Packers, and cornerback
Toi Cook, also an outfielder for the NCAA
champion Cardinal baseball team, is with
the New Orleans Saints. Linebacker Chris
Weber and safety Walt Harris also
graduated.
The offense, meanwhile, lost six starters.

Quarterback John Paye moved a few miles
north to play for the 49ers, and running
hack Kevin Scott is with the San Diego
Chargers. Receiver Thomas Henley was
one of the last players cut by the Saints.
Graduation also claimed fullback Brian
Morris as well as linemen Kurt Josephson
and Tom Nye.
Still, 12 starters return. The most impor
tant of those returnees is All-America
Muster, who turned down an opportunity
to enter the NFL draft in order to return to
his spot at tailback for Stanford.
It's somewhat ironic that the most
talented player at Stanford, which tradi
tionally has been a breeding ground for
talented quarterbacks, is a running back.
Muster is one of the best pro prospects in
the country and, if his health improves, a
genuine Heisman candidate. He is the
career leader among all returning NCAA
players in both all-purpose running and re
ceptions.
As Muster goes, so may go Stanford's
chances, as the Cardinal found out in its
season-opening 31-21 loss to Washington.
Muster played only a few series before sit
ting out.
With the senior ball carrier out of the
Cardinal lineup. Washington was able to
put double coverage on star receiver Jeff
James, who did not catch a pass in the
game.
Stanford could muster only 122 yards on
the ground, and quarterback Greg Ennis
was the leading rusher with 55 yards.
Clearly, the Cardinal needs Muster in
order to operate an effective offense.
Muster is a double threat who is just as
good coming out of the backfield to catch a
pass as he is rushing the ball. He's even
been known to throw a pass.
