# Card led by Heisman hopeful Muster
## 
### Susan Slusser 
The slogan for Stanford football this
season is "The Tradition Continues," and
the banner season the Cardinal had in
1986 — including the team's first winning
record since 1980 and its first bowl appear
ance since 1978 — would be a nice tradi
tion to continue.
In fact, Coach Jack Elway would like to
do even better this year. Whether or not he
does will depend largely on the perform
ance of senior tailback Brad Muster. The
keystone of Stanford's offense and widely
touted as a Heisman Trophy candidate.
Muster sprained his left ankle on the first
day of fall practice. He aggravated the in
jury only a few series into the team's
season opener at Washington Sept. 5.
Muster's status is listed as "day-to-day."
Without Muster, the Cardinal will be
hard-pressed to match last year's success.
And with or without Muster, but espe
cially without him, the Cardinal will rely
heavily on its defense.
In years past, it was offense that earned
the Cardinal invitations to bowl games, but
the guys on the other side of the ball kept
the team in the race for postseason play in
1986, allowing only 14.9 points per game
and forcing 32 turnovers.
The defense keyed several victories and
kept the team close in narrow losses to
Washington. USC and California.
Several key members of last year's
defense are gone, however. Team leader
Dave Wyman is rooming with fellow
Seahawk linebacker Brian Bosworth in
Seattle, tackle Tony Leikerisin Green Bay
playing for the Packers, and cornerback
Toi Cook, also an outfielder for the NCAA
champion Cardinal baseball team, is with
the New Orleans Saints. Linebacker Chris
Weber and safety Walt Harris also
graduated.
The offense, meanwhile, lost six starters.

Quarterback John Paye moved a few miles
north to play for the 49ers, and running
hack Kevin Scott is with the San Diego
Chargers. Receiver Thomas Henley was
one of the last players cut by the Saints.
Graduation also claimed fullback Brian
Morris as well as linemen Kurt Josephson
and Tom Nye.
Still, 12 starters return. The most impor
tant of those returnees is All-America
Muster, who turned down an opportunity
to enter the NFL draft in order to return to
his spot at tailback for Stanford.
It's somewhat ironic that the most
talented player at Stanford, which tradi
tionally has been a breeding ground for
talented quarterbacks, is a running back.
Muster is one of the best pro prospects in
the country and, if his health improves, a
genuine Heisman candidate. He is the
career leader among all returning NCAA
players in both all-purpose running and re
ceptions.
As Muster goes, so may go Stanford's
chances, as the Cardinal found out in its
season-opening 31-21 loss to Washington.
Muster played only a few series before sit
ting out.
With the senior ball carrier out of the
Cardinal lineup. Washington was able to
put double coverage on star receiver Jeff
James, who did not catch a pass in the
game.
Stanford could muster only 122 yards on
the ground, and quarterback Greg Ennis
was the leading rusher with 55 yards.
Clearly, the Cardinal needs Muster in
order to operate an effective offense.
Muster is a double threat who is just as
good coming out of the backfield to catch a
pass as he is rushing the ball. He's even
been known to throw a pass.

Although hampered by an ankle injury of late, senior tailback Brad Muster is still in the running for the Heisman Trophy.

strong, deceptively quick runner.
He's hard to tackle and draws the
defense away from his
teammates, leaving holes for
other runners and allowing
receivers to get open.
"Brad Muster is the best back
I've been associated with in my
career," Elway said. "He's an
outstanding back, he's competi
tive and he's got size."
"We're going to use Brad as
many different ways as we can,"
Elway continued. "We're going
to give him the ball a minimum of
20 times running a game, and
he'll also be involved in our pass
ing attack. I know other teams
will be keying on him, but they'll
have to find him first."
Muster has had problems with
injuries in the past, but he must
be healthy if the Cardinal is to
move up a few notches in the Pac

10. And a healthy Brad Muster is
certainly capable of winning col
lege football's highest individual
honor.
"Brad is a bona fide candidate
for the Heisman Trophy," Elway
said. "Obviously, if the voting
was tomorrow and I had the only
vote, he'd be the Heisman
Trophy winner."
Although Muster is getting
most of the media attention,
James is also a potent offensive
weapon. A preseason All-
America, James was third in the
conference in receptions last
season (right behind Muster) and
caught eight touchdown passes.
Don't expect him to be shut down
again this season like he was
against Washington. Elway says
the senior is "as good as any
receiver in the country."
The most frequently asked
question this fall was "What
about quarterback?" That's an
unfamiliar query at Stanford,
which has been blesed with a
seemingly endless line of gifted.

NFL-bound signal-callers, includ
ing Jim Plunkett, Guy Benjamin,
Turk Schonert, John Elway and
John Paye.
When Paye graduated, how
ever, there was no heir apparent.
Senior Greg Ennis eventually
won the starting job, and has
shown leadership and ability
despite somewhat erratic perfor
mances thus far.
Ennis got his first college start
in the 1986 Gator Bowl — some
thing of a baptism by fire for the
redhead, who threw for just 18
yards in the first half but then
came back and completed 14 of
27 passes for 150 yards and two
touchdowns in the second half.
"It was an important learning ex
perience," Ennis said. "I matured
a lot from it."
In his second collegiate start, in
the Washington game, Ennis
showed that he can run with the
ball and also stay in the pocket
and complete the pass under
pressure. Although he was inter
cepted twice, Ennis generally

showed good judgement in not
forcing passes when his receivers
were covered.
Ennis finished with 266 yards
passing and one touchdown
against the Huskies, a team that
shut out Stanford 34-0 in Seattle
two years ago. Ennis is tough, in
telligent and hard-working. All
he lacks is experience, and he's
gaining that rapidly.
Ennis has big targets in tight
ends Eric Snelson (a 6-foot-3,
240-pound senior) and Jim Price
(a 6-foot-4, 240-pound junior),
as well as 6-foot-6, 220-pound
sophomore wide receiver Ed
McCaffrey, who pulled down four
catches for a total of 108 yards at
Washington and was named the
team's offensive player of the
game.
Despite numerous injuries, the
backfield is loaded with talent:
Joining Muster are veteran full
back Marshall Dillard and
promising sophomores Charlie
Young and Jon Volpe. Young
caught five passes for 78 yards

and one TD and also ran for an
other score in the opener.
The offensive line is among the
finest in the conference, with a
number of veterans, including
pre-season All-America center
Andy Sinclair, a senior . Junior
guard Andy Papathanassiou and
senior tackle John Zentner also
return, joined by senior tackle
Robbie Coffin and senior guard
John Mahoney. Projected starter
Jeff Marchin, a senior, may be out
for the year after undergoing
knee surgery in the spring. The
line allowed only one sack against
the Huskies.
Defensively, Stanford's biggest
problem has been injuries.
Linebacker Barry McKeever, the
man slated to fill Wynian's shoes,
suffered a severe knee injury
during spring, underwent surgery
and missed the Washington game.
Junior Darron Bennett, at the
other linebacking spot, may also
miss a couple of games with ton
silitis. Bennett, who blocked
three kicks last year, collected 10

tackles against Washington, and
is a key member of the defense.
Even healthy, this year's
defense will have a tough job out
doing its predecessor. Last year,
the defense did not allow the op
position to score a touchdown in
the first quarter of any game until
the second-to-last game of the
season. The most points any team
scored against the Cardinal
defense was the 27 tallied by
Clemson in the Gator Bowl.
The Cardinal defense has al
ready given up more points than
that (31) in the first game of this
season. The defense surrendered
509 total yards to the Huskies
after only giving up 319.5 yards
per game last year.
But there were bright spots,
particularly the play of the
linebackers, even without Mc-
Keever. Senior Kevin Richard
son, named the team's defensive
player of the game, had a superb
day, collecting 17 tackles, while
Bennett and senior Kurt
Colenower each picked up 10
stops. Colehower also added an
interception, as did junior corner
back Brad Cook.
The defensive line is also solid,
literally, with 6-foot-6, 260-
pound Sean Scheller, 6-foot-5,
255-pound Lester Archambeau]
and 6-foot-2, 255-pound Ray
Huckestein taking care of busi
ness.
Elway calls junior tackle Ar
chambeau "a truly great talent."
Nose guard Huckestein, who was
nominated for Pac-10 Player of
the Week for his performance

against UCLA last year, is ex
tremely quick and very highly re
garded.
There's a Cook back in the sec
ondary, but it's not Toi. It's trans
fer Brad, one of only two new
transfers on the team (Steve Sul
lens is the other). Since coming
over from Snow Junior College
(Utah), Cook has won a spot at
right corner and picked off a pass
against the Huskies.
Speedy junior Alan Grant is at
the other corner, while senior
Brad Humphreys returns for his
third straight year at strong
safety. Senior Bruce Richardson
has nailed down the job at free
safety and collected nine tackles
against Washington.
Cornerback Grant is a speed
ster on special teams as well, as he

showed with u 69-yard touch
down on a punt return versus the
Huskies. Volpe and Charlie
Young will run hack kicks, and
senior punter Doug Robison is
among the best in the country.
Stanford's only weakness on
special teams is place-kicking.
Senior David Sweeney had a
miserable outing last season, con
necting on just 4 of I 5 field goals.
Sweeney missed his first attempt
of this year, a 45-yarder against
Washington that went just wide
left. Freshman John Hopkins,
from the same Texas high school
as Sweeney, missed an extra point
and had a bad snap for a field goal
attempt. Elway says the coaching
staff is "still working on a deci
sion" about which kicker will
hold the starting position.

Stanford's only weakness on
special teams is place-kicking.
Senior David Sweeney had a
miserable outing last season, con

Sweeney missed his first attempt
of this year, a 45-yarder against
Washington that went just wide

from the same Texas high school
as Sweeney, missed an extra point
and had a bad snap for a field goal
attempt. Elway says the coaching

The slogan for Stanford football this
season is "The Tradition Continues," and
the banner season the Cardinal had in
1986 — including the team's first winning
record since 1980 and its first bowl appear
ance since 1978 — would be a nice tradi
tion to continue.
In fact, Coach Jack Elway would like to
do even better this year. Whether or not he
does will depend largely on the perform
ance of senior tailback Brad Muster. The
keystone of Stanford's offense and widely
touted as a Heisman Trophy candidate.
Muster sprained his left ankle on the first
day of fall practice. He aggravated the in
jury only a few series into the team's
season opener at Washington Sept. 5.
Muster's status is listed as "day-to-day."
Without Muster, the Cardinal will be
hard-pressed to match last year's success.
And with or without Muster, but espe
cially without him, the Cardinal will rely
heavily on its defense.
In years past, it was offense that earned
the Cardinal invitations to bowl games, but
the guys on the other side of the ball kept
the team in the race for postseason play in
1986, allowing only 14.9 points per game
and forcing 32 turnovers.
The defense keyed several victories and
kept the team close in narrow losses to
Washington. USC and California.
Several key members of last year's
defense are gone, however. Team leader
Dave Wyman is rooming with fellow
Seahawk linebacker Brian Bosworth in
Seattle, tackle Tony Leikerisin Green Bay
playing for the Packers, and cornerback
Toi Cook, also an outfielder for the NCAA
champion Cardinal baseball team, is with
the New Orleans Saints. Linebacker Chris
Weber and safety Walt Harris also
graduated.
The offense, meanwhile, lost six starters.

Quarterback John Paye moved a few miles
north to play for the 49ers, and running
hack Kevin Scott is with the San Diego
Chargers. Receiver Thomas Henley was
one of the last players cut by the Saints.
Graduation also claimed fullback Brian
Morris as well as linemen Kurt Josephson
and Tom Nye.
Still, 12 starters return. The most impor
tant of those returnees is All-America
Muster, who turned down an opportunity
to enter the NFL draft in order to return to
his spot at tailback for Stanford.
It's somewhat ironic that the most
talented player at Stanford, which tradi
tionally has been a breeding ground for
talented quarterbacks, is a running back.
Muster is one of the best pro prospects in
the country and, if his health improves, a
genuine Heisman candidate. He is the
career leader among all returning NCAA
players in both all-purpose running and re
ceptions.
As Muster goes, so may go Stanford's

strong, deceptively quick runner.
He's hard to tackle and draws the
defense away from his
teammates, leaving holes for
other runners and allowing
receivers to get open.
"Brad Muster is the best back
I've been associated with in my
career," Elway said. "He's an
outstanding back, he's competi
tive and he's got size."
"We're going to use Brad as
many different ways as we can,"
Elway continued. "We're going
to give him the ball a minimum of
20 times running a game, and
he'll also be involved in our pass
ing attack. I know other teams
will be keying on him, but they'll
have to find him first."
Muster has had problems with
injuries in the past, but he must
be healthy if the Cardinal is to
move up a few notches in the Pac

10. And a healthy Brad Muster is
certainly capable of winning col
lege football's highest individual
honor.
"Brad is a bona fide candidate
for the Heisman Trophy," Elway
said. "Obviously, if the voting
was tomorrow and I had the only
vote, he'd be the Heisman
Trophy winner."
Although Muster is getting
most of the media attention,
James is also a potent offensive
weapon. A preseason All-
America, James was third in the
conference in receptions last
season (right behind Muster) and
caught eight touchdown passes.
Don't expect him to be shut down
again this season like he was
against Washington. Elway says
the senior is "as good as any
receiver in the country."
The most frequently asked
question this fall was "What
about quarterback?" That's an
unfamiliar query at Stanford,

John Paye.
When Paye graduated, how
ever, there was no heir apparent.
Senior Greg Ennis eventually
won the starting job, and has
shown leadership and ability
despite somewhat erratic perfor
mances thus far.
Ennis got his first college start
in the 1986 Gator Bowl — some
thing of a baptism by fire for the
redhead, who threw for just 18
yards in the first half but then
came back and completed 14 of
27 passes for 150 yards and two
touchdowns in the second half.
"It was an important learning ex
perience," Ennis said. "I matured
a lot from it."
In his second collegiate start, in
the Washington game, Ennis
showed that he can run with the
ball and also stay in the pocket
and complete the pass under
pressure. Although he was inter
cepted twice, Ennis generally

showed good judgement in not
forcing passes when his receivers
were covered.
Ennis finished with 266 yards
passing and one touchdown
against the Huskies, a team that
shut out Stanford 34-0 in Seattle
two years ago. Ennis is tough, in
telligent and hard-working. All
he lacks is experience, and he's
gaining that rapidly.
Ennis has big targets in tight
ends Eric Snelson (a 6-foot-3,
240-pound senior) and Jim Price
(a 6-foot-4, 240-pound junior),
as well as 6-foot-6, 220-pound
sophomore wide receiver Ed
McCaffrey, who pulled down four
catches for a total of 108 yards at
Washington and was named the
team's offensive player of the
game.
Despite numerous injuries, the
backfield is loaded with talent:
Joining Muster are veteran full
back Marshall Dillard and
promising sophomores Charlie
Young and Jon Volpe. Young
caught five passes for 78 yards

and one TD and also ran for an
other score in the opener.
The offensive line is among the
finest in the conference, with a
number of veterans, including
pre-season All-America center
Andy Sinclair, a senior . Junior

senior tackle John Zentner also

Robbie Coffin and senior guard

will be keying on him, but they'll
have to find him first."
Muster has had problems with
injuries in the past, but he must
be healthy if the Cardinal is to
move up a few notches in the Pac

10. And a healthy Brad Muster is
certainly capable of winning col
lege football's highest individual
honor.
"Brad is a bona fide candidate
for the Heisman Trophy," Elway
said. "Obviously, if the voting
was tomorrow and I had the only
vote, he'd be the Heisman
Trophy winner."
Although Muster is getting
most of the media attention,
James is also a potent offensive
weapon. A preseason All-
America, James was third in the
conference in receptions last
season (right behind Muster) and
caught eight touchdown passes.
Don't expect him to be shut down
again this season like he was
against Washington. Elway says
the senior is "as good as any
receiver in the country."
The most frequently asked
question this fall was "What
about quarterback?" That's an
unfamiliar query at Stanford,
which has been blesed with a
seemingly endless line of gifted.

NFL-bound signal-callers, includ

John Paye.
When Paye graduated, how
ever, there was no heir apparent.
Senior Greg Ennis eventually
won the starting job, and has
shown leadership and ability
despite somewhat erratic perfor
mances thus far.
Ennis got his first college start
in the 1986 Gator Bowl — some
thing of a baptism by fire for the
redhead, who threw for just 18
yards in the first half but then
came back and completed 14 of
27 passes for 150 yards and two
touchdowns in the second half.
"It was an important learning ex
perience," Ennis said. "I matured
a lot from it."
In his second collegiate start, in
the Washington game, Ennis
showed that he can run with the
ball and also stay in the pocket
and complete the pass under
pressure. Although he was inter
cepted twice, Ennis generally

showed good judgement in not
forcing passes when his receivers
were covered.
Ennis finished with 266 yards
passing and one touchdown
against the Huskies, a team that
shut out Stanford 34-0 in Seattle
two years ago. Ennis is tough, in
telligent and hard-working. All
he lacks is experience, and he's
gaining that rapidly.
Ennis has big targets in tight
ends Eric Snelson (a 6-foot-3,
240-pound senior) and Jim Price
(a 6-foot-4, 240-pound junior),
as well as 6-foot-6, 220-pound
sophomore wide receiver Ed
McCaffrey, who pulled down four
catches for a total of 108 yards at
Washington and was named the
team's offensive player of the
game.
Despite numerous injuries, the
backfield is loaded with talent:
Joining Muster are veteran full
back Marshall Dillard and
promising sophomores Charlie
Young and Jon Volpe. Young
caught five passes for 78 yards

and one TD and also ran for an
other score in the opener.
The offensive line is among the
finest in the conference, with a
number of veterans, including
pre-season All-America center
Andy Sinclair, a senior . Junior
guard Andy Papathanassiou and
senior tackle John Zentner also
return, joined by senior tackle
Robbie Coffin and senior guard
John Mahoney. Projected starter
Jeff Marchin, a senior, may be out
for the year after undergoing
knee surgery in the spring. The
line allowed only one sack against
the Huskies.
Defensively, Stanford's biggest
problem has been injuries.
Linebacker Barry McKeever, the
man slated to fill Wynian's shoes,
suffered a severe knee injury
during spring, underwent surgery
and missed the Washington game.
Junior Darron Bennett, at the
other linebacking spot, may also
miss a couple of games with ton
silitis. Bennett, who blocked
three kicks last year, collected 10

tackles against Washington, and
is a key member of the defense.
Even healthy, this year's
defense will have a tough job out
doing its predecessor. Last year,
the defense did not allow the op
position to score a touchdown in
the first quarter of any game until
the second-to-last game of the
season. The most points any team
scored against the Cardinal
defense was the 27 tallied by
Clemson in the Gator Bowl.
The Cardinal defense has al
ready given up more points than
that (31) in the first game of this
season. The defense surrendered
509 total yards to the Huskies
after only giving up 319.5 yards
per game last year.
But there were bright spots,
particularly the play of the
linebackers, even without Mc-
Keever. Senior Kevin Richard
son, named the team's defensive
player of the game, had a superb
day, collecting 17 tackles, while
Bennett and senior Kurt
Colenower each picked up 10
stops. Colehower also added an
interception, as did junior corner
back Brad Cook.
The defensive line is also solid,
literally, with 6-foot-6, 260-
pound Sean Scheller, 6-foot-5,
255-pound Lester Archambeau]
and 6-foot-2, 255-pound Ray
Huckestein taking care of busi
ness.
Elway calls junior tackle Ar
chambeau "a truly great talent."
Nose guard Huckestein, who was
nominated for Pac-10 Player of
the Week for his performance

against UCLA last year, is ex
tremely quick and very highly re
garded.
There's a Cook back in the sec
ondary, but it's not Toi. It's trans
fer Brad, one of only two new
transfers on the team (Steve Sul
lens is the other). Since coming
over from Snow Junior College
(Utah), Cook has won a spot at
right corner and picked off a pass
against the Huskies.
Speedy junior Alan Grant is at
the other corner, while senior
Brad Humphreys returns for his
third straight year at strong
safety. Senior Bruce Richardson
has nailed down the job at free
safety and collected nine tackles
against Washington.
Cornerback Grant is a speed
ster on special teams as well, as he

showed with u 69-yard touch
down on a punt return versus the
Huskies. Volpe and Charlie
Young will run hack kicks, and
senior punter Doug Robison is
among the best in the country.
Stanford's only weakness on
special teams is place-kicking.
Senior David Sweeney had a
miserable outing last season, con
necting on just 4 of I 5 field goals.
Sweeney missed his first attempt
of this year, a 45-yarder against
Washington that went just wide
left. Freshman John Hopkins,
from the same Texas high school
as Sweeney, missed an extra point
and had a bad snap for a field goal
attempt. Elway says the coaching
staff is "still working on a deci
sion" about which kicker will
hold the starting position.
The slogan for Stanford football this
season is "The Tradition Continues," and
the banner season the Cardinal had in
1986 — including the team's first winning
record since 1980 and its first bowl appear
ance since 1978 — would be a nice tradi
tion to continue.
In fact, Coach Jack Elway would like to
do even better this year. Whether or not he
does will depend largely on the perform
ance of senior tailback Brad Muster. The
keystone of Stanford's offense and widely
touted as a Heisman Trophy candidate.
Muster sprained his left ankle on the first
day of fall practice. He aggravated the in
jury only a few series into the team's
season opener at Washington Sept. 5.
Muster's status is listed as "day-to-day."
Without Muster, the Cardinal will be
hard-pressed to match last year's success.
And with or without Muster, but espe
cially without him, the Cardinal will rely
heavily on its defense.
In years past, it was offense that earned
the Cardinal invitations to bowl games, but
the guys on the other side of the ball kept
the team in the race for postseason play in
1986, allowing only 14.9 points per game
and forcing 32 turnovers.
The defense keyed several victories and
kept the team close in narrow losses to
Washington. USC and California.
Several key members of last year's
defense are gone, however. Team leader
Dave Wyman is rooming with fellow
Seahawk linebacker Brian Bosworth in
Seattle, tackle Tony Leikerisin Green Bay
playing for the Packers, and cornerback
Toi Cook, also an outfielder for the NCAA
champion Cardinal baseball team, is with
the New Orleans Saints. Linebacker Chris
Weber and safety Walt Harris also
graduated.
The offense, meanwhile, lost six starters.

Quarterback John Paye moved a few miles
north to play for the 49ers, and running
hack Kevin Scott is with the San Diego
Chargers. Receiver Thomas Henley was
one of the last players cut by the Saints.
Graduation also claimed fullback Brian
Morris as well as linemen Kurt Josephson
and Tom Nye.
Still, 12 starters return. The most impor
tant of those returnees is All-America
Muster, who turned down an opportunity
to enter the NFL draft in order to return to
his spot at tailback for Stanford.
It's somewhat ironic that the most
talented player at Stanford, which tradi
tionally has been a breeding ground for
talented quarterbacks, is a running back.
Muster is one of the best pro prospects in
the country and, if his health improves, a
genuine Heisman candidate. He is the
career leader among all returning NCAA
players in both all-purpose running and re
ceptions.
As Muster goes, so may go Stanford's
chances, as the Cardinal found out in its
season-opening 31-21 loss to Washington.
Muster played only a few series before sit
ting out.
With the senior ball carrier out of the
Cardinal lineup. Washington was able to
put double coverage on star receiver Jeff
James, who did not catch a pass in the
game.
Stanford could muster only 122 yards on
the ground, and quarterback Greg Ennis
was the leading rusher with 55 yards.
Clearly, the Cardinal needs Muster in
order to operate an effective offense.
Muster is a double threat who is just as
good coming out of the backfield to catch a
pass as he is rushing the ball. He's even
been known to throw a pass.

Muster is the leader in career all-purpose running among returning NCAA players.
strong, deceptively quick runner.
He's hard to tackle and draws the
defense away from his
teammates, leaving holes for
other runners and allowing
receivers to get open.
"Brad Muster is the best back
I've been associated with in my
career," Elway said. "He's an
outstanding back, he's competi
tive and he's got size."
"We're going to use Brad as
many different ways as we can,"
Elway continued. "We're going
to give him the ball a minimum of
20 times running a game, and
he'll also be involved in our pass
ing attack. I know other teams
will be keying on him, but they'll
have to find him first."
