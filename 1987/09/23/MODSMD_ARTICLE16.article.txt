### Chris Crader 
Ah. September. The time for leaves to
change colors, students to return to school and
the Stanford women's volleyball team to begin
anew its pursuit of a national title.
The Cardinal is the only team in the nation
to have reached the NCAA Final Four each of
the last five years, and the squad is off to a 4-1
start in the 1987 season.
Stanford began the season ranked third in
the nation in the preseason polls of both Vol
leyball Monthly magazine and the Collegiate
Volleyball Coaches Association (CVCA). The
Cardinal garnered these ratings on the
strength of four returning starters from last
year's NCAA semifinalists. The Cardinal is
presently ranked fourth in the CVCA's
weekly poll.
Senior Teresa Smith, a CVCA first-team
All-America, leads the Stanford lineup. The
6-foot outside hitter was named the Pacific 10
Conference Player of the Year last season.
She led the conference with a .340 hitting
percentage and with 87 service aces. Smith
also set a Stanford record with 563 kills in
1986 and was third on the team in both digs
and total blocks.
Smith spent the early part of the summer
playing for the U.S. team at the World Uni
versity Games in Zagreb, Yugoslavia, where
she was joined by senior teammate Nancy
Reno. Both Cardinal standouts started most
of the matches for the United States, which
finished the competition in I Ith place.
Reno, a 5-foot-1 1 middle blocker, begins
her third year in the starting lineup for the
Cardinal. She was second on the team in total
blocks last year and will be counted on this
year to complement Smith both offensively
and defensively.
Running the show for Stanford will be
senior setter Wendi Rush, a three-time All-
America. Rush is perhaps the quickest setter
in the country (she set a record with 73 digs in
the NCAA tournament in 1984). At 5-foot
-10, she is also effective at the net.
Junior Laura Olesen is Stanford's fourth re
turning starter. A 6-foot middle blocker,

Olesen redshirted her freshman your and thus
is in only her second year of eligibility for the
Cardinal. She led the team in blocks last year
and her .310 hitting percentage was third in
the Pac-10.
Stanford Coach Don Shaw's hardest task
this season will be to replace Barbara Fontana
and Brooke Hahner, who graduated in June
with more than five years starting experience
between them The winners in the battle for
the two vacated spots in the starting lineup are
junior Amy Hayes and sophomore Lara
As per.
The 5-foot-10 Hayes has taken Fontana's
spot on the left side. She played in every
match her freshman year as a back-row substi
tute. recording 45 service aces. Hayes did not
play as much last season, but she has im
proved her hitting greatly since then.
Asper came to Stanford as a setter, but was
used often last season as a defensive substi
tute. She is a good hitter and blocker at 5-
foot-1 I and will be playing as right-side hitter
this year.
Sophomore middle blocker Jenny Chaffee
will also see a lot of court time this year. At 6-
foot-2, she will also spend some time on the
outside.
The Cardinal's remaining players are three
5-foot-9 freshmen. Setter Karen Anderson
was a three-time team MVP of a Los Altos
High School team that was ranked third in the
country and sent four players to top-five col
legiate teams.
Outside hitter Cheryl Conly was also a
three-time MVP of her high school team,
Montclair Prep in Van Nuys. The final fresh
man. Tracy Hughes, also an outside hitter,
was a member of Volleyball Monthly's
Fabulous 50 recruits list and a two-time
league MVP for Parker High School in San
Diego.
Stanford this fall plays one of the toughest
schedules in the nation. The Cardinal will play
17 matches against Top-20 teams, including
seven matches against the other four top-5
teams.
Stanford opened its season at home Sept. 3
with an easy win over Nevada-Reno. Stanford

took only 60 minutes to go 1 -0, by 1 5-7, 1 5-2,
15-4.
The Cardinal then took off on a grueling
road trip. The team heat Colorado 15-4, 15-5,
15-3 Sept. 6. then traveled north to topple
Wyoming 15-9, 15-11, 15-7 two days later.
Stanford visited No. 10 Colorado State
Sept. 9. The vya* prepared, however,
and although the Cardinal dropped its first
game of the season, Stanford remained unde
feated with a 15-7, 11-15, 15-12, 15-8 tri
umph It was then off to Provo, Utah, to face
No. 3 BYU.
The Cougars were still smarting from a loss
to Stanford last December that ended not only
BYU's 25-match winning streak, but also its
season. Mariliisa Salmi, the 1986 Reebok
College Player of the Year, led the Cougars to
a 10-15, 15-12, 15-10, 15-5 win over Stan
ford Sept. I 1.
The Cardinal will have played fifth-ranked
UCLA Sept. 18 and No. 12 USC the next
night. These opening matches in Pac-10 play
should provide a good indicator of the way the
conference race will go as Stanford, UCLA
and USC are the three favorites to capture the
league crown.
UCLA returns one of the top setters in the
country in 6-foot junior All-America Ann
Boyer. The Bruins have 6-foot-3 Stacey Buck
and 6-foot-1 Daiva Tomkus in the middle and
All-America candidate Lori Zeno on the
outside. Also on the outside will be Wendy
Fletcher, Jenny Crocker, Traci Broadway and
Samantha Shaver. In addition, UCLA has
Julie Barnes, the nation's premier defensive
specialist.
USC went 2-32 last year in a season in
which Coach Chuck Erbe was almost one of
the few healthy Trojans. Setter Kathi Rich is
f»ut for the year, but Western Michigan trans
er Christine Brigman will fill in. Nancy Hill
man. freshmen Antoinette White and
Yleanna Carasco — who high-jumped 6 feet
in high school — will roam the outside.
Trisonya Thompson and Jamie Hatchett, who

both had serious ankle injuries
last year, will fight 1986 Reebok
High School Player of the Year
Megan McCallister for the two
middle spots.
Both Southern California
teams are coming in on a down
note, however. UCLA went to
Hawaii last weekend, but won
only one game in two losses to the
second-ranked Rainbow Wa
hines. USC, on the other hand,
went east to the Illinois/Mid-
American Classic. The Trojans
reached the championship match,
only to be drubbed 15-7, 15-7,
1 5-7 by No. 6 Illinois.

Stanford gets closer to home
Sept. 22, when the Cardinal
travels to Stockton to take on
University of the Pacific. UOP is
ranked first in the nation after re
turning everyone from the team
that cake-walked to the NCAA
title last year. The Tigers still
have four starters from their 1985
national championship team as
well, making them the favorite to
win their third straight title.
One hitch is Elaina Oden's
knee, which will keep her off the
court for about three more weeks.
Replacing her to join second
team All-America Mary Miller in
the middle will be either redshirt
freshman Cathey Scotlan, who
spent last year practicing against
Oden and Miller every day, or

freshman Krissy Fifer, a 6-foot-3
leaper from Los Altos.
Senior Liz Hert returns to run
the offense, and she will have
three familiar targets on the
outside in Brooke Herrington,
Dorothy Hert and second-team
All-America Teri McGrath.
When Oden returns, the Tigers
should have the talent to beat
everyone they face until con
frontations with Hawaii in No
vember. However, Stanford,
which lost two very tight five
game matches to UOP last year,
always plays the Tigers tough and
has a good shot at an upset.
Stanford will return home the
following weekend, hosting
Washington State Sept. 25, and
Washington the following after
noon.

should provide a good indicator of the way the
conference race will go as Stanford, UCLA
and USC are the three favorites to capture the
league crown.
UCLA returns one of the top setters in the
country in 6-foot junior All-America Ann
Boyer. The Bruins have 6-foot-3 Stacey Buck
and 6-foot-1 Daiva Tomkus in the middle and
All-America candidate Lori Zeno on the
outside. Also on the outside will be Wendy
Fletcher, Jenny Crocker, Traci Broadway and
Samantha Shaver. In addition, UCLA has
Julie Barnes, the nation's premier defensive
specialist.
USC went 2-32 last year in a season in
which Coach Chuck Erbe was almost one of
the few healthy Trojans. Setter Kathi Rich is
f»ut for the year, but Western Michigan trans
er Christine Brigman will fill in. Nancy Hill
man. freshmen Antoinette White and
Yleanna Carasco — who high-jumped 6 feet

both had serious ankle injuries
last year, will fight 1986 Reebok
High School Player of the Year
Megan McCallister for the two
middle spots.
Both Southern California
teams are coming in on a down
note, however. UCLA went to
Hawaii last weekend, but won
only one game in two losses to the
second-ranked Rainbow Wa
hines. USC, on the other hand,
went east to the Illinois/Mid-
American Classic. The Trojans
reached the championship match,
only to be drubbed 15-7, 15-7,
1 5-7 by No. 6 Illinois.

Stanford gets closer to home
Sept. 22, when the Cardinal
travels to Stockton to take on
University of the Pacific. UOP is
ranked first in the nation after re
turning everyone from the team
that cake-walked to the NCAA
title last year. The Tigers still
have four starters from their 1985
national championship team as
well, making them the favorite to
win their third straight title.
One hitch is Elaina Oden's
knee, which will keep her off the
court for about three more weeks.
Replacing her to join second
team All-America Mary Miller in
the middle will be either redshirt
freshman Cathey Scotlan, who
spent last year practicing against
Oden and Miller every day, or

freshman Krissy Fifer, a 6-foot-3
leaper from Los Altos.
Senior Liz Hert returns to run
the offense, and she will have
three familiar targets on the
outside in Brooke Herrington,
Dorothy Hert and second-team
All-America Teri McGrath.
When Oden returns, the Tigers
should have the talent to beat
everyone they face until con
frontations with Hawaii in No
vember. However, Stanford,
which lost two very tight five
game matches to UOP last year,
always plays the Tigers tough and
has a good shot at an upset.
Stanford will return home the
following weekend, hosting
Washington State Sept. 25, and
Washington the following after
noon.
Ah. September. The time for leaves to
change colors, students to return to school and
the Stanford women's volleyball team to begin
anew its pursuit of a national title.
The Cardinal is the only team in the nation
to have reached the NCAA Final Four each of
the last five years, and the squad is off to a 4-1
start in the 1987 season.
Stanford began the season ranked third in
the nation in the preseason polls of both Vol
leyball Monthly magazine and the Collegiate
Volleyball Coaches Association (CVCA). The
Cardinal garnered these ratings on the
strength of four returning starters from last
year's NCAA semifinalists. The Cardinal is
presently ranked fourth in the CVCA's
weekly poll.
Senior Teresa Smith, a CVCA first-team
All-America, leads the Stanford lineup. The
6-foot outside hitter was named the Pacific 10
Conference Player of the Year last season.
She led the conference with a .340 hitting
percentage and with 87 service aces. Smith
also set a Stanford record with 563 kills in
1986 and was third on the team in both digs
and total blocks.
Smith spent the early part of the summer
playing for the U.S. team at the World Uni
versity Games in Zagreb, Yugoslavia, where
she was joined by senior teammate Nancy
Reno. Both Cardinal standouts started most
of the matches for the United States, which
finished the competition in I Ith place.
Reno, a 5-foot-1 1 middle blocker, begins
her third year in the starting lineup for the
Cardinal. She was second on the team in total
blocks last year and will be counted on this
year to complement Smith both offensively
and defensively.
Running the show for Stanford will be
senior setter Wendi Rush, a three-time All-
America. Rush is perhaps the quickest setter
in the country (she set a record with 73 digs in
the NCAA tournament in 1984). At 5-foot
-10, she is also effective at the net.
Junior Laura Olesen is Stanford's fourth re
turning starter. A 6-foot middle blocker,

Olesen redshirted her freshman your and thus
is in only her second year of eligibility for the
Cardinal. She led the team in blocks last year
and her .310 hitting percentage was third in
the Pac-10.
Stanford Coach Don Shaw's hardest task
this season will be to replace Barbara Fontana
and Brooke Hahner, who graduated in June
with more than five years starting experience
between them The winners in the battle for
the two vacated spots in the starting lineup are
junior Amy Hayes and sophomore Lara
As per.
The 5-foot-10 Hayes has taken Fontana's
spot on the left side. She played in every
match her freshman year as a back-row substi
tute. recording 45 service aces. Hayes did not
play as much last season, but she has im
proved her hitting greatly since then.
Asper came to Stanford as a setter, but was
used often last season as a defensive substi
tute. She is a good hitter and blocker at 5-
foot-1 I and will be playing as right-side hitter
this year.
Sophomore middle blocker Jenny Chaffee
will also see a lot of court time this year. At 6-
foot-2, she will also spend some time on the
outside.
The Cardinal's remaining players are three
5-foot-9 freshmen. Setter Karen Anderson
was a three-time team MVP of a Los Altos
High School team that was ranked third in the
country and sent four players to top-five col
legiate teams.
Outside hitter Cheryl Conly was also a
three-time MVP of her high school team,
Montclair Prep in Van Nuys. The final fresh
man. Tracy Hughes, also an outside hitter,
was a member of Volleyball Monthly's
Fabulous 50 recruits list and a two-time
league MVP for Parker High School in San
Diego.
Stanford this fall plays one of the toughest
schedules in the nation. The Cardinal will play
17 matches against Top-20 teams, including
seven matches against the other four top-5
teams.
Stanford opened its season at home Sept. 3
with an easy win over Nevada-Reno. Stanford

took only 60 minutes to go 1 -0, by 1 5-7, 1 5-2,
15-4.
The Cardinal then took off on a grueling
road trip. The team heat Colorado 15-4, 15-5,
15-3 Sept. 6. then traveled north to topple
Wyoming 15-9, 15-11, 15-7 two days later.
Stanford visited No. 10 Colorado State
Sept. 9. The vya* prepared, however,
and although the Cardinal dropped its first
game of the season, Stanford remained unde
feated with a 15-7, 11-15, 15-12, 15-8 tri
umph It was then off to Provo, Utah, to face
No. 3 BYU.
The Cougars were still smarting from a loss
to Stanford last December that ended not only
BYU's 25-match winning streak, but also its
season. Mariliisa Salmi, the 1986 Reebok
College Player of the Year, led the Cougars to
a 10-15, 15-12, 15-10, 15-5 win over Stan
ford Sept. I 1.
The Cardinal will have played fifth-ranked
UCLA Sept. 18 and No. 12 USC the next
