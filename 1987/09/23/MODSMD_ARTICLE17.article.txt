# Men's and women's crew recruiting rowers
## 
### Don Hogue 
Stanford crew is looking for a few good men and
women to participate in one of the Farm's most
popular and successful varsity sports.
Although crew is sanctioned as a varsity sport at
Stanford, all of the athletes are walk-ons. Many had
never seen a racing shell, much less raced in one,
before coming to Stanford.
And with nary a scholarship to offer its athletes.
Cardinal crews were ranked third on the West Coast
last year and among the top ten in the nation. The
men's team last year swept a powerhouse Washing
ton squad in the Pacific Coast Championships, while
the women placed third in the prestigious San Diego
Crew Classic and beat California in the annual Big
Row. This year Stanford will face the top five teams
in the country on at least two occasions
"We re good," said women's coach John Davis,
"and we're getting better."
Stanford crew has been represented in all nine
Olympiads since 1952, producing 12 Olympians
who put in eight medal-winning performances
four of them gold. Stanford oarsmen and women
have also garnered medal performances at other
world and national competitions, including the
World Championships last summer
Stanford athletes have captured the Senior Pairs
the past two years in national competition This was
accomplished by junior Christie May and last year's
captain Lynn Gawthrop, as well as by Hilde
Klmslander and senior Kristin Dahl two years ago
But what exactly is crew?

Basically, there are two types of rowing. One type
is sculling, where each rower has two oars. This is
done at the national and international level. Much
of the rowing done at the collegiate level, however,
is sweep rowing, in which each rower pulls one oar,
keeping in synch with the lead rower (or "stroke"),
as well as listening to the coxswain for directions.
The coxswain (rhymes with "oxen") is really the
eyes and ears of the racing shell. The only one facing
forward in the shell, the coxswain is the only person
who can sec where the boat is going and where rival
crews are in relation to the boat It's much like run
ning a team of horses, and a coxswain, like a jockey,
is very light (130 pounds or so for men. about I 10
for women). Men's varsity coxswain Doug Wilner
was named All-Conference last year.
With the exception of coxswain, height is a defi
nite advantage in crew A taller oarsman is able to
keep the oar in the water longer, thus creating more
pull. Crew teams look for men who are over 6 feet,
women who are over 5-fool-8, or those who are
"tough enough to make the difference "
"It's the ultimate team sport," Davis said. "In no
other sport can one match the feeling of being in a
racing shell with all eight rowers perfectly in synch.
Fhe sensations of the boat moving through the
water are unmistakable to the rower You give your
all to have that feeling â€” that pendulum rhythm
generated by the sheer muscle power of everyone
within the boat."
"Once you experience that feeling in crew," he
