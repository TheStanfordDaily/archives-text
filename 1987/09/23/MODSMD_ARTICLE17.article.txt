# Men's and women's crew recruiting rowers
## 
### Don Hogue 
Stanford crew is looking for a few good men and
women to participate in one of the Farm's most
popular and successful varsity sports.
Although crew is sanctioned as a varsity sport at
Stanford, all of the athletes are walk-ons. Many had
never seen a racing shell, much less raced in one,
before coming to Stanford.
And with nary a scholarship to offer its athletes.
Cardinal crews were ranked third on the West Coast
last year and among the top ten in the nation. The
men's team last year swept a powerhouse Washing
ton squad in the Pacific Coast Championships, while
the women placed third in the prestigious San Diego
Crew Classic and beat California in the annual Big
Row. This year Stanford will face the top five teams
in the country on at least two occasions
"We re good," said women's coach John Davis,
"and we're getting better."
Stanford crew has been represented in all nine
Olympiads since 1952, producing 12 Olympians
who put in eight medal-winning performances
four of them gold. Stanford oarsmen and women
have also garnered medal performances at other
world and national competitions, including the
World Championships last summer
Stanford athletes have captured the Senior Pairs
the past two years in national competition This was
accomplished by junior Christie May and last year's
captain Lynn Gawthrop, as well as by Hilde
Klmslander and senior Kristin Dahl two years ago
But what exactly is crew?

Basically, there are two types of rowing. One type
is sculling, where each rower has two oars. This is
done at the national and international level. Much
of the rowing done at the collegiate level, however,
is sweep rowing, in which each rower pulls one oar,
keeping in synch with the lead rower (or "stroke"),
as well as listening to the coxswain for directions.
The coxswain (rhymes with "oxen") is really the
eyes and ears of the racing shell. The only one facing
forward in the shell, the coxswain is the only person
who can sec where the boat is going and where rival
crews are in relation to the boat It's much like run
ning a team of horses, and a coxswain, like a jockey,
is very light (130 pounds or so for men. about I 10
for women). Men's varsity coxswain Doug Wilner
was named All-Conference last year.
With the exception of coxswain, height is a defi
nite advantage in crew A taller oarsman is able to
keep the oar in the water longer, thus creating more
pull. Crew teams look for men who are over 6 feet,
women who are over 5-fool-8, or those who are
"tough enough to make the difference "
"It's the ultimate team sport," Davis said. "In no
other sport can one match the feeling of being in a
racing shell with all eight rowers perfectly in synch.
Fhe sensations of the boat moving through the
water are unmistakable to the rower You give your
all to have that feeling — that pendulum rhythm
generated by the sheer muscle power of everyone
within the boat."
"Once you experience that feeling in crew," he

said, "you're hooked."
You don't necessarily need ex
perience to be a good rower.
"We're looking for people who
are interested in taking part in a
successful activity," Davis said.
"We're looking for the people
with a strong work ethic, enthusi
asm, a sense of cooperation in a
group situation and a little
humility."
Davis himself had never rowed
before college, but with only two
years experience, he became a
national champion and captured
five medals en route to becoming
an Olympic Trials finalist.

The men's and women's crew
teams are looking for athletes
who excelled in high school. "It's
the perfect sport for the volleyball
player who's not quite good
enough to play on a Final Four
team or the swimmer who finds it
tough to break into one of the top
swim teams in the country,"
Davis said. "And it's great for the
person who's looking for a new
sport."
"The same elements that make
a student successful at Stanford
will make them successful at
rowing," men's coach Ken
Dreyfuss said. "Rowing is open to
everyone, even if you haven't
rowed before."
The coaches stress academics
for their athletes. Since Davis
came to Stanford in 1980, every

athlete in crew who applied to
medical school has been ac
cepted.
Ihe crew teams hold practices
five afternoons a week during the
fall. In addition to on-land condi
tioning, the team travels by bus to
Redwood City, where the teams
practice rowing on the Bay.
Dreyfuss, Davis and the rest of
the coaching staff invite inter
ested students to attend one of
two informational meetings
during Orientation Week: Mon
day, Sept. 28, or Tuesday, Sept.
29. Both meetings will be held at
6:15 p.m. in the History Corner,
Room 2. Interested students can
also drop by the crew office in
Encina Gym or call 723-0748.

men's team last year swept a powerhouse Washing
ton squad in the Pacific Coast Championships, while
the women placed third in the prestigious San Diego
Crew Classic and beat California in the annual Big
Row. This year Stanford will face the top five teams
in the country on at least two occasions
"We re good," said women's coach John Davis,
"and we're getting better."
Stanford crew has been represented in all nine
Olympiads since 1952, producing 12 Olympians
who put in eight medal-winning performances
four of them gold. Stanford oarsmen and women
have also garnered medal performances at other
world and national competitions, including the
World Championships last summer
Stanford athletes have captured the Senior Pairs
the past two years in national competition This was
accomplished by junior Christie May and last year's
captain Lynn Gawthrop, as well as by Hilde
Klmslander and senior Kristin Dahl two years ago
But what exactly is crew?

Basically, there are two types of rowing. One type
is sculling, where each rower has two oars. This is
done at the national and international level. Much
of the rowing done at the collegiate level, however,
is sweep rowing, in which each rower pulls one oar,
keeping in synch with the lead rower (or "stroke"),
as well as listening to the coxswain for directions.
The coxswain (rhymes with "oxen") is really the
eyes and ears of the racing shell. The only one facing
forward in the shell, the coxswain is the only person
who can sec where the boat is going and where rival
crews are in relation to the boat It's much like run
ning a team of horses, and a coxswain, like a jockey,
is very light (130 pounds or so for men. about I 10
for women). Men's varsity coxswain Doug Wilner
was named All-Conference last year.
With the exception of coxswain, height is a defi
nite advantage in crew A taller oarsman is able to
keep the oar in the water longer, thus creating more
pull. Crew teams look for men who are over 6 feet,
women who are over 5-fool-8, or those who are
"tough enough to make the difference "
"It's the ultimate team sport," Davis said. "In no
other sport can one match the feeling of being in a
racing shell with all eight rowers perfectly in synch.
Fhe sensations of the boat moving through the
water are unmistakable to the rower You give your
all to have that feeling — that pendulum rhythm
generated by the sheer muscle power of everyone
within the boat."
"Once you experience that feeling in crew," he

said, "you're hooked."
You don't necessarily need ex
perience to be a good rower.
"We're looking for people who
are interested in taking part in a
successful activity," Davis said.
"We're looking for the people
with a strong work ethic, enthusi
asm, a sense of cooperation in a
group situation and a little
humility."
Davis himself had never rowed
before college, but with only two
years experience, he became a
national champion and captured
five medals en route to becoming
an Olympic Trials finalist.

The men's and women's crew
teams are looking for athletes
who excelled in high school. "It's
the perfect sport for the volleyball
player who's not quite good
enough to play on a Final Four
team or the swimmer who finds it
tough to break into one of the top
swim teams in the country,"
Davis said. "And it's great for the
person who's looking for a new
sport."
"The same elements that make
a student successful at Stanford
will make them successful at
rowing," men's coach Ken
Dreyfuss said. "Rowing is open to
everyone, even if you haven't
rowed before."
The coaches stress academics
for their athletes. Since Davis
came to Stanford in 1980, every

athlete in crew who applied to
medical school has been ac
cepted.
Ihe crew teams hold practices
five afternoons a week during the
fall. In addition to on-land condi
tioning, the team travels by bus to
Redwood City, where the teams
practice rowing on the Bay.
Dreyfuss, Davis and the rest of
the coaching staff invite inter
ested students to attend one of
two informational meetings
during Orientation Week: Mon
day, Sept. 28, or Tuesday, Sept.
29. Both meetings will be held at
6:15 p.m. in the History Corner,
Room 2. Interested students can
also drop by the crew office in
Encina Gym or call 723-0748.
