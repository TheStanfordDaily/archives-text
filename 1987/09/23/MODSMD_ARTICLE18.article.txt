# Field hockey successful and confident
## 
### Linda Dodge 
This week, as most freshmen are orienting them
selves to campus life, and upperclassmen are re
orienting themselves, the Stanford field hockey
team is nowhere to be found.
The team has packed its sticks and bags and
headed for the best field hockey competition in the
country â€” on the East Coast.
The Cardinal will be competing in Pennsylvania
against Westchester University, the University of
Delaware and St. Joseph's University. All three are
top-10 teams, and all play on grass fields rather than
astroturL Field hockey here on the West Coast is
normalljriplayed on astroturf.
However, in the wake of a recent successful road
trip, Coach Sheryl Johnson and her team are more
confident of their chances against other highly
ranked teams. This year's squad is loaded with tal
ent, and the Cardinal lost only three seniors from
last season's team. With the addition of four fresh
men, Stanford may turn out to be one of the top
teams in the country.
The Cardinal has won its conference for the past
two seasons, advancing to the NCAA Champion
ships and ending up with a No. 9 national ranking
both years.
So far this season Stanford boasts a 3-1 record,
including a 1-0 conference win over Chico State in
the first match of the season. The team also spent a
weekend at Northwestern, and won two matches,
beating Northwestern and Ball State and losing only
to Maryland.
"We were especially excited to beat Northwest
ern," said Johnson, who is now in her third year as
head coach. "We lost to them in the NCAA Cham
pionships last year, so revenge was definitely a fac
tor. That win definitely encouraged our team."
Offensively, Stanford is led this year by three
juniors on the forward line Kat Thomas, who led
the team in scoring last season with seven goals, and
Tracy Stieglitz and Laura Gartland at the wing posi
tions. Midfielder Dana Fleming, another junior, has
already scored two goals this season, and is one of
four players named All-Conference in 1986.
Thomas, goalkeeper Karen Jones and midfielder

Alison Smith are the others.
On defense, team captains Ami Chitwood, the
teams's only senior and its most consistent player so
far this season, and juniors Wanda Kay Key (who
red shirted last year) and Smith will provide experi
ence. Smith was a second-team All-America last
season as a sophomore and spent the summer
traveling with the U S National 21-and-Under
Team.
In addition, goalkeeper Karen Jones will be one
of the nation's best at her position. In 1986, the
sophomore led Stanford to a 10-game winning
streak late in the season by shutting out the opposi
tion nine times.
"We should have a stong team this year,''
Johnson said. "With eight returning juniors, the nu
cleus of our team is back, we are off to a great start;
I just hope that we can keep it up."
Johnson is currently co-captain of the U.S. Na
tional Team that qualified for the Olympics last
summer. The Stanford coach has played with the
U.S. team since 1978 and won a bronze medal at the
1984 Olympic Games.
Because there is no Pacific 10 Conference for
field hockey (the Pac-10 did not exist for women's
sports until a year ago), Stanford competes with
other California teams in the Northern Pacific Con
ference.
"The teams in our conference (California, San
Jose State, University of the Pacific and Chico
State) are all pretty equal," Johnson said,"which
makes it especially competitive. Cal should be one
of the better teams this year and San Jose State and
(Pacific) are usually strong, too. We don't take
anyone lightly."
Four members of the Class, of '91 should see
playing time this year: Ellen Lee, a midfielder from
Haddonfield, N.J., who led her high school team to
two undefeated seasons and the state championship
her senior year; Patricia McJennet, a midfielder
from Providence, R. 1., who was second-team All-
State her junior and senior seasons; Leslie
Smithline, from Stamford, Conn., who played both
forward and midfield positions before an injury
forced her to miss most of her senior year; and Clare
Stephens, a midfielder from Wilmington, Del., who

was All-Conference her senior year.
"Clare has been one of our biggest suprises so far
this year," Johnson said. "She is starting at left mid
field, and with so many upperclassmen on the team,
it was remarkable for her to break into the lineup.
"We had a good recruiting year," Johnson
added."We have a solid group of freshmen, and we
also brought up two players from the junior varsity

squad. We definitely have the potential to win the
conference again and go on to the NCAA's."
Stanford's first home match is Oct. 3 against San
Jose State, followed by another conference contest
Oct. 10 against rival Cal. Both matches start at 11
a.m. on the field at the intersection of El Camino
and Serra behind the Stanford Federal Credit Un
ion.
