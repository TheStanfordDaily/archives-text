# Water polo wants third straight NCAA title
## Dettamanti will redshirt Kemp; Greenman alone in goal this year

Tennis balls. Golf balls. Legs on a
stool. Stooges. Musketeers. Deaths
of celebrities.
All of these are things that come
in threes, and Dante Dettamanti
hopes he can add NCAA water polo
championships to that list. Det
tamanti, head coach of the Stanford
men's water polo team, has watched
his team streak to national cham
pionships in both of the last two
years.
Now he's hoping the team can do
it again. But he has his doubts. "I
don't think we can do what we did
last year," he said.
Hmmm. . . last year the team went
undefeated and rolled through the
NCAA Championships. Then it lost
five of eight starters to graduation.
Still, the squad returns two All-
Americas, was ranked third nation
ally in a pre-season coaches' poll and
finished fourth in the World Junior
Championships here at Stanford this
summer. That was without two of
this season's projected starters,
junior Andrew Lawson and sopho
more Jeff Oeding. both of whom
were busy playing on the U.S. Junior

National Team.
A couple of weeks ago, the same
team, again without Lawson and
Oeding, played No. 1 California to a
tie in a scrimmage at DeGuerre
Pool.
"I was kind of surprised," Det
tamanti said. "We're doing better
than I thought we would. ... I think
we've got a much better team than
other people anticipate." '
Dettamanti has never had a
shortage of talent. This year, he'll
make a calculated gamble, red
shirting All-America goalie Todd
Kemp, who has shared time with
Obi Greenman for the past two
seasons.
This year, Greenman, a senior,
will have the position to himself, and
Dettamanti has faith that he'll rise to
the occasion.
"Obi. . . is just as good (as
Kemp)," he said. "It's a shame to
have them split time. We're going to
give Obi a shot at it himself. It won't
hurt us in the goal at all."
Stanford lost a lot of offense when
David Imbernino and Craig Klass
graduated in June, but no doubt the
slack will be made up.
Senior Erich Fischer returns after

scoring 87 goals last year. He'll get
help from senior Matt Tingler, who
scored 37 goals, from Oeding (41
goals) and from senior Grant Stan
ley (27).
Dettamanti said one of the team's
strengths will be its depth.
"I'll probably substitute more
than I traditionally have," he said.
As always, Stanford's schedule
will be among the toughest in the na
tion. Four of the top six teams in the
nation — Stanford, UCLA, USC
and California — are in the Pacific
-10 Conference, and the other two —
Pepperdine and UC-lrvine — are on
the Cardinal's schedule.
In one masochistic weekend in
early October (Oct. 2-4) Stanford
will host UC-lrvine, UCLA and
Pepperdine on successive days at
DeGuerre Pool.
Even a two-time defending champ
can't take that kind of schedule
lightly, and Dettamanti doesn't
think his troops will be over
confident.
"Most of these guys didn't have
anything to do with it when we won
(the NCAA championship) two
years ago," he said. "They want to
do it themselves."
