# Men's soccer looks for balanced attack
## 
### 
After being less than a goal's length away from
receiving a bid to the NCAA post-season tourna
ment in 1985, the men's soccer team fell to 6-11-4
last year. However, buoyed by a talented core of re
turning players, the Cardinal has its mind set on an
NCAA berth.
Stanford Coach Sam Koch, who is beginning his
fourth season at the Cardinal helm, called his 1987
squad "a much better team than last year's."
The Cardinal has worked hard to improve on last
year's record, Koch said. "There is not as much in
dividual talent as with the 1985 team, but they (this
year's team) are a better team. They want it more.
They've worked harder."
The most important element in this year's team is
its desire to win. "Our strength is an inner charac
ter," Koch said. "This team, more so than the others
I've coached here, has a craving for not accepting a
tie, for not accepting a loss. They have an inner
drive to win."
The path to the NCA As will not be a smooth one,
however. The Cardinal must face several top-20
teams, including Pacific Conference rival Fresno
State, the number one-ranked team in the nation,
and N0.9 UCLA.
"There isn't an easy game on the schedule," Koch
said.
On a swing through the East Coast earlier this
month, Stanford showed it can compete with the
best teams in the country. On the road trip, the Car
dinal forced three top-20 teams, including defend
ing national champion Duke, into overtime before
losing.
Stanford also was undefeated in five off-season
exhibition games, beating the University of Sydney
(4-0) and two Argentine clubs (4-0 and 2-0). The
Cardinal tied UCLA (1-1) and the San Jose State
Earthquakes (2-2).
If the Cardinal hopes to beat the top teams this
fall, it must play "errorless soccer," Koch said. "It is

a question of our defenders playing consistently
well. !f the other team has to beat us to score, we
can put a lot of wins up on the board."
A trio of talented sophomores, led by sweeper
Mark Semioli, key the Cardinal. Semioli, who last
year was named Second Team All-Pacific Soccer
Conference as well as team MVP, forms the
backbone of the team's defense.
Koch will look to another sophomore, goalkeeper
Chris Helling, to keep the ball out of the net. Hel
ling, who logged an impressive 0.90 goals against
average in the four games he played last season, was
one of the last players cut from the Junior National
Team.
The Cardinal will rely largely on a third sopho
more, Chris Porch, to score goals. As a freshman
Porch tied for the team lead in points scored last
year and this summer scored two goals on the team's
East Coast trip.
Directing the action from his midfield position is
senior co-captain Mike Mossmer. A fifth-year
senior, Mossmer tied for second on the team in
goal-scoring with three last season.
Joining Mossmer in the midfield will be junior
Luke Garrott and fifth-year senior Pat Sheehy. Gar
rott scored four points last year, and his ability to
switch fields is the best on the team.
Sheehy, who sat out part of last year with a stress
fracture, registered a goal in an overtime loss to
North Carolina State earlier this month.
The Cardinal's prospects this season will be
boosted by the return of another player who was
injured last year, senior fullback Tim Westergren.*
Stanford also expects to receive immediate help
from freshmen midfielders Tim Keyes and Todd
Caven. Caven dished out two assists on the recent
road trip. Caven and Keyes are members of what
Koch called "the best freshman group to come in
since I've been here."
