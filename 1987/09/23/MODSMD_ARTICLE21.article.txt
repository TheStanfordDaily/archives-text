# Youth key to success for cross country
## 
### 
Although they usually play second or even third
fiddle to the more publicized fall sports, the men's
and women's cross country teams are among Stan
ford's most consistent winners. And although both
teams are in a "redirection" year, according to Stan
ford Coach Brooks Johnson, they still figure to be in
the running when the NCAA championships roll
around.
"We have a youth movement going," said
Johnson, who is entering his ninth season as director
of track and field at Stanford. This season there are
only three upperclassmen on the men's team and
only two on the women's.
"Despite our youth, I think both teams have the
potential to blossom this year and qualify for the na
tionals," he said.
Johnson will have to rely on a core of young run
ners aided by a few seasoned athletes. "We have to
keep the pressure low and the expectations high,"
Johnson said.
"We're going to be patient and give our young
athletes time to develop at their own rate," Johnson
said. "We have a lot of potential on both teams and
are capable of being one of the top teams in the con
ference."
The women's team, which capped a successful
season last year with a Isth-place finish at< the
NCAA Championships, will look to sophomore
Carol Gray for leadership. Gray garnered All-
America honors last year after placing 25th at the
NC A As.
Gray, who also earned All-America honors in
track last year, finished second in the Meeting of the
Minds cross country meet, third at the Pacific 10
Conference Championships and at the NCAA Dis
trict 8 Championships, seventh at the Stanford Invi
tational and eighth in the Arizona Invitational.
Along with Gray, the women will count on a trio

of highly touted freshmen: Wendy Neely, Jamie
Fallon and Mary Mendoza, who were finalists at the
Kinney Nationals a year ago.
Neely, one of the top recruits in the nation, placed
third at the Kinney Nationals. She also competed in
the 1986 World Junior Track and Field Champion
ships in Athens, Greece.
An Oregon All-State selection in both cross
country and track and field in 1986 and 1987, Fal
lon won the Oregon cross country championships
and the 800 and 1500 meter races at the state track
championships last year.
Mendoza won the California state two-mile
championship last year as a high school senior. The
San Jose native's time in the two-mile ranked third
in the nation for high school girls in 1987. In addi
tion, she was named 1987 NorCal Girls Track and
Field Althlete of the Year by the San Jose Mercury
News.
The men will look to junior James Alborough to
lead them to victory this season. Alborough. consid
ered one of the top distance runners in the country,
placed third in the Meeting of the Minds, 14lh in the
Stanford Invitational, 22nd in the Pac-10 Cham
pionships and 26th in the Arizona Invitaitonal last
year. He finished in 96th place at the 1985 NCA As.
The Cardinal also will need strong performances
from Eric and Mark Mastalir and Steve Schadler if it
hopes to improve on its fifth-place finish at the
NCAA District 8 Championships last year.
Eric Mastalir, a sophomore, came to Stanford as
the top prep distance runner in the country. As a
senior at Jesuit High School in Sacramento he ran
the second fastest prep 3000 of all time in the
United States.
Mark Mastalir, also a sophomore, was one of the
top prep runners in the nation in 1986. Both Mas
talir brothers were members of the U.S. Junior

Cross Country team that competed at the 1987
World Cross Country Championships.
Schadler, a senior from New Jersey, last year
qualified for the 1987 Pac-10 Track Championships

in the 1500. In cross country last season, he placed
23rd at the Pac-10 Championships, 36th at the
Stanford Invitational and 37th at the NCAA Dis
trict 8 Championships.
