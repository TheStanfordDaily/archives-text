# Outlook for women's soccer good with new coach, entire team back
## 
### 
Its captain is embroiled in a
court case with the NCAA; its
coach was not named until late
June; and it is only beginning its
third season as an intercollegiate
sport. Faced with these obstacles,
the Stanford women's soccer
team has no where to go but up.
Now for the good news. The
Cardinal returned its entire team
from last season, and with the ad
dition of a few talented recruits
the team has reason to be opti
mistic.
Responsibility for developing
the nascent program will go to the
team's new coach, Berhane An
deberhan, who hopes to work the
same magic at Stanford that he
did at C'al State-Los Angeles. In
his six years at CSLA, Andeber
han produced four conference
champions, five All-Americas,
one senior national player and
two Junior National Team select
players.
In addition, Andeberhan is cur
rently th'e Western Regional
Head Coach for Women and
Girls. He coached the winning
team at the 1986 Olympic Festi
val and the second-place team at
the 1985 Festival. Andeberhan
also directed the soccer training
site for the Los Angeles Summer
Olympics.
"Berhane brings a tremendous
amount of experience and success
to the Stanford women's soccer
program," Athletic Director
Andy Geiger said when announc
ing Andeberhan's appointment.

"I am excited about having him
build our program in women's
soccer."
So far this season the Cardinal
has struggled, losing two and
tying two of its first four games. A
slow start for Stanford was ex
pected, however, and Andeber
han believes his team has the tal
ent to do well this season.
The Cardinal will be a ball
control, defensive-minded team
that will rely on counterattacks to
generate goals and put pressure
on the opposition's defense.
The defense will be led by
junior goalie Vija Brookshire,
while the offense will look to
sophomore Tonya Antonucci,
who tied for top scoring honors
last season.
The Stanford offense also will
count on forwards Jen Hill, a
senior, and juniors Stacey Keare
and Jenny Howick. Hill may have
her mind on other matters,
however, as she, along with the
University, is seeking to have the
NCAA's drug-testing policy
declared unconstitutional by the
courts.
The midfield will be anchored
by senior Amy Geisse, junior
Carolyn Denney and freshman
Denise Denney.
The Cardinal will play home
games against Sonoma State, UC-
Davis, San Francisco State, USC,
Westmont College, the Univer
sity of Portland, Chico State Uni
versity and St. Mary's.
