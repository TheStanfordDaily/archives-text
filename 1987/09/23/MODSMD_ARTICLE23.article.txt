# Sailing already underway

While the thoughts of many
Stanford students head west when
September rolls around, the Car
dinal sailing team went east.
Although West Coast competi
tion in intercollegiate sailing does
not begin until the start of school
in October, East Coast schools
get a one-month head start by
competing on Labor Day
weekend. The Stanford sailing
team took advantage of this "pre
season" opportunity by compet
ing in the annual Nevins Trophy
Regatta at the U.S. Merchant
Marine Academy in King's Point,
N. Y., Sept. 12-13.
Six East Coast members of the
Cardinal squad, including three
freshmen, met Sept. 1 I for
several hours of practice in the
now-familiar waters of Long Is
land Sound. King's Point was the
site of the 1987 Collegiate Na
tionals.
By Sept. 13, when the waves
had subsided, the Cardinal found
itself in l()th place in a highly
competitive fleet that included 17
schools from around the country.
"Eight of the top 10 teams in
the country were sailing this
weekend," said Stanford Coach
Blake Middlcton, "so we were in
really good company."
Becaust most of Stanford's top
sailors did not compete in the
event, the performance — against
the nation's best teams and a
huge field of All-America sailors
— was actually quite good.
Stanford junior Bill Shoemaker
was scheduled to start in the A di
vision for the Cardinal, but a bout
with mononucleosis forced some
last-minute switches for the team.
Junior Brad Swett, sailing with
freshman crew Maria Reiser,
switched over to A division.
After a rough start in the first
three races, including one race
where Swett and Reiser went
from first all the way back to 14th
after fouling a competitor, the
pair settled down and ran off a

string of impressive finishes in the
420-class races Saturday after
noon, eventually working up to
sixth place in the division by the
end of the day.
"I was kind of wondering about
this guy after the first few races,"
Reiser jokingly said of Swett.
"But once we got untracked, it
was fun to be sailing at the top of
the fleet."
"It was casual," Swett said.
"With 17 races to sail in each di
vision, we had plenty of time to
get organized."
In the B division, a pair of
freshmen, David Dowd and
Kevin Hagen, started for the Car
dinal. The pair sailed Tech
Dinghies for the first half of the
regatta. "I had a great time in the
Techs," Hagen said, adding that
"these things are a blast to crew
in."
Dowd and Hagen had a tough
time in the early going, but they
eventually found the pace, finish
ing third in the final race Sept. 13.
There du Pont, captain of the
Cardinal sailors, handled C
division duties in the talented
Laser fleet. "The Laser experts
were out in force for this regatta.
It was tough to break into the top
half of this fleet on a regular
basis," du Pont said.
C-division competitors in
cluded Brown's freshman sensa
tion Kevin Hall, the current
World Youth Champion.
On Sunday, the A and B divi
sions switched boats, with the A
taking over the Tech Dinghies,
and the B switching to 4205. The
New York weather did not
cooperate much, however; rain
came down all day.
Sophomore Jonathan Schreiber
replaced Reiser for several of the
A-division races when the wind
picked up, helping the Cardinal A
team to an impressive sixth place
finish.
Dowd and Hagen finished
ninth in the B division, while du

Pont came in 1 Ith in the C divi
sion.
"It was a great experience for
the team, especially the fresh
men." Middleton said. "It should
help give us an advantage when
the California regattas start in
October."
The regatta was won by Old
Dominion University, with Navy
and host King's Point finishing
second and third. Other top
finishers included Connecticut
College, Brown, Tufts, Harvard,
Yale and an all-star team from
Great Britain.
In other sailing news, while the
team was competing in New
York, senior Tom Kuhnle was
racing a Laser in the open North
west District Championships in
Vancouver, Canada, against a
world-class fleet of 52 Lasers.
Kuhnle finished an impressive
second in the regatta, which was
won by Pan American Games
gold medalist Ross Mac Donald.
Kuhnle also beat Carl Buchan
and Jonathan McKee, both gold
medal winners at the 1984 Los
Angeles Olympics.

Junior Brad Swett, sailing with
freshman crew Maria Reiser,
switched over to A division.
After a rough start in the first
three races, including one race
where Swett and Reiser went
from first all the way back to 14th
after fouling a competitor, the
pair settled down and ran off a

string of impressive finishes in the
420-class races Saturday after
noon, eventually working up to
sixth place in the division by the
end of the day.
"I was kind of wondering about
this guy after the first few races,"
Reiser jokingly said of Swett.
"But once we got untracked, it
was fun to be sailing at the top of
the fleet."
"It was casual," Swett said.
"With 17 races to sail in each di
vision, we had plenty of time to
get organized."
In the B division, a pair of
freshmen, David Dowd and
Kevin Hagen, started for the Car
dinal. The pair sailed Tech
Dinghies for the first half of the
regatta. "I had a great time in the
Techs," Hagen said, adding that
"these things are a blast to crew
in."
Dowd and Hagen had a tough
time in the early going, but they
eventually found the pace, finish
ing third in the final race Sept. 13.
There du Pont, captain of the
Cardinal sailors, handled C
division duties in the talented
Laser fleet. "The Laser experts
were out in force for this regatta.
It was tough to break into the top
half of this fleet on a regular
basis," du Pont said.
C-division competitors in
cluded Brown's freshman sensa
tion Kevin Hall, the current
World Youth Champion.
On Sunday, the A and B divi
sions switched boats, with the A
taking over the Tech Dinghies,
and the B switching to 4205. The
New York weather did not
cooperate much, however; rain
came down all day.
Sophomore Jonathan Schreiber
replaced Reiser for several of the
A-division races when the wind
picked up, helping the Cardinal A
team to an impressive sixth place
finish.
Dowd and Hagen finished
ninth in the B division, while du

Pont came in 1 Ith in the C divi
sion.
"It was a great experience for
the team, especially the fresh
men." Middleton said. "It should
help give us an advantage when
the California regattas start in
October."
The regatta was won by Old
Dominion University, with Navy
and host King's Point finishing
second and third. Other top
finishers included Connecticut
College, Brown, Tufts, Harvard,
Yale and an all-star team from
Great Britain.
In other sailing news, while the
team was competing in New
York, senior Tom Kuhnle was
racing a Laser in the open North
west District Championships in
Vancouver, Canada, against a
world-class fleet of 52 Lasers.
Kuhnle finished an impressive
second in the regatta, which was
won by Pan American Games
gold medalist Ross Mac Donald.
Kuhnle also beat Carl Buchan
and Jonathan McKee, both gold
medal winners at the 1984 Los
Angeles Olympics.
