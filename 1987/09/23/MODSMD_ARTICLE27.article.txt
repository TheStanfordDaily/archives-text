# From Bach to the future
## A
						guide to the Bay Area's varied music scene 
### 
Music is the hardest Bay Area entertainment cat
egory to pin down because it encompasses every
thing from the San Francisco Opera to San Fran
cisco's I-Beam night club, with room in between for
Bach societies and U2 concerts at the Oakland
Coliseum.
At the same time, the local music scene is less
monolithic than the theater. In any given genre of
music, it is possible to keep track of what's happen
ing, and even to attend a good proportion of the rel
evant events.
Most musical performers spend their time travel
ing, so the best way to describe local music offerings
is in terms of organizations, which tend to stay in
one place.
On campus, the most visible of these organizers is
the Lively Arts at Stanford. While the Lively Arts
program contains a variety of events, including
dance companies, films, lectures and occasionally
drama, the oulk of the schedule is made up of musi
cal acts. The Lively Arts will be opening its fall
schedule this year Oct. 11 with a debut American
performance by the Liege Philharmonic of Belgium.
All Lively Arts concerts take place either in
Memorial Auditorium or Dinkelspiel Auditorium,
depending on the drawing power of the act. For the
big acts, it may be hard to find good seats, or any
seats. The Lively Arts conducts an aggressive season
ticket sales campaign each spring.
For tickets to individual events, go to the Tresid
der Ticket Office. Ticket prices are high, but less
than you'd pay to see the same performers else
where. Don't worry about missing out on the events
— it's hard not to hear about them. The Lively Arts
advertising campaigns, like their ticket sales, are ag
gressive.

The Stanford Ikpartment of Music sponsors a full
season of performances throughout the school year
featuring departmental ensembles and performers.
Many 01 the department's students participate in the
free Wednesday Noon Musicals, informally known
as Bach's Lunches, in the Dinkelspiel rehearsal hall.
Most of the department's solo recitals, chamber
recitals, and orchestral performances take place in
Dinkelspiel Auditorium or Campbell Recital Hall in
Braun Music Center.
The Stanford Chorale, Chorus, Early Music Sing
ers and Renaissance Wind Band do most of their
performing in Memorial Church. All organ recitals,
whether by Stanford faculty and students, or by
visiting organists in the George Morell Organ Se
ries, take place in Memorial Church, either on the
1901 Murray Harris organ, or the 1984 Fisk-
Nanney organ.
One of the nicer Stanford traditions is the annual
Messiah sing-along shortly before winter break:
singers should bring a score, and orchestral parts
will be provided for those who want to play along on
their instruments.
The student price for those Department of Music
events which charge admission is usually $3.
The department's much-publicized jazz program
will continue this year. The Jazz Bands will have a
new director, Bill Bell, who has been recognized by
the California State Legislature for excellence in
music. He is often heard as accompanist for such
jazz greats as Carmen Mcßae, Joe Williams and
Nancy Wilson when thev visit the Bav Area.
Artist-in-residence Stan Getz will give one con
cert each quarter with his quartet and sometimes
with a guest artist. Trumpeter Art Farmer will join
the saxophone legend for his autumn concert in

Dinkelspiel. NBC Tonight Show drummer Ed
Shaughnessy will also be on campus this year per
forming and giving a clinic.
The May Area is known as a hotbed of new music.
Stanford's contributions to this area are Alea II: the
Ensemble for New Music, and the Center for Com
puter Research and Acoustics (CCRMA.
pronounced "karma"), located in the recently
renovated Knoll. Alea II generally gives one per

formance each quarter, and CCRMA gives several
performances each year, often in Frost Amphithea
ter under the stars.
The department publishes a quarterly calendar of
events, which can be obtained from the department.
If you wish to buy tickets for an event in advance,
you can purchase them at Tresidder Ticket Office.
