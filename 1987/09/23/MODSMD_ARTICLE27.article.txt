# From Bach to the future
## A 						guide to the Bay Area's varied music scene 
### 
Music is the hardest Bay Area entertainment cat
egory to pin down because it encompasses every
thing from the San Francisco Opera to San Fran
cisco's I-Beam night club, with room in between for
Bach societies and U2 concerts at the Oakland
Coliseum.
At the same time, the local music scene is less
monolithic than the theater. In any given genre of
music, it is possible to keep track of what's happen
ing, and even to attend a good proportion of the rel
evant events.
Most musical performers spend their time travel
ing, so the best way to describe local music offerings
is in terms of organizations, which tend to stay in
one place.
On campus, the most visible of these organizers is
the Lively Arts at Stanford. While the Lively Arts
program contains a variety of events, including
dance companies, films, lectures and occasionally
drama, the oulk of the schedule is made up of musi
cal acts. The Lively Arts will be opening its fall
schedule this year Oct. 11 with a debut American
performance by the Liege Philharmonic of Belgium.
All Lively Arts concerts take place either in
Memorial Auditorium or Dinkelspiel Auditorium,
depending on the drawing power of the act. For the
big acts, it may be hard to find good seats, or any
seats. The Lively Arts conducts an aggressive season
ticket sales campaign each spring.
For tickets to individual events, go to the Tresid
der Ticket Office. Ticket prices are high, but less
than you'd pay to see the same performers else
where. Don't worry about missing out on the events
— it's hard not to hear about them. The Lively Arts
advertising campaigns, like their ticket sales, are ag
gressive.

The Stanford Ikpartment of Music sponsors a full
season of performances throughout the school year
featuring departmental ensembles and performers.
Many 01 the department's students participate in the
free Wednesday Noon Musicals, informally known
as Bach's Lunches, in the Dinkelspiel rehearsal hall.
Most of the department's solo recitals, chamber
recitals, and orchestral performances take place in
Dinkelspiel Auditorium or Campbell Recital Hall in
Braun Music Center.
The Stanford Chorale, Chorus, Early Music Sing
ers and Renaissance Wind Band do most of their
performing in Memorial Church. All organ recitals,
whether by Stanford faculty and students, or by
visiting organists in the George Morell Organ Se
ries, take place in Memorial Church, either on the
1901 Murray Harris organ, or the 1984 Fisk-
Nanney organ.
One of the nicer Stanford traditions is the annual
Messiah sing-along shortly before winter break:
singers should bring a score, and orchestral parts
will be provided for those who want to play along on
their instruments.
The student price for those Department of Music
events which charge admission is usually $3.
The department's much-publicized jazz program
will continue this year. The Jazz Bands will have a
new director, Bill Bell, who has been recognized by
the California State Legislature for excellence in
music. He is often heard as accompanist for such
jazz greats as Carmen Mcßae, Joe Williams and
Nancy Wilson when thev visit the Bav Area.
Artist-in-residence Stan Getz will give one con
cert each quarter with his quartet and sometimes
with a guest artist. Trumpeter Art Farmer will join
the saxophone legend for his autumn concert in

Dinkelspiel. NBC Tonight Show drummer Ed
Shaughnessy will also be on campus this year per
forming and giving a clinic.
The May Area is known as a hotbed of new music.
Stanford's contributions to this area are Alea II: the
Ensemble for New Music, and the Center for Com
puter Research and Acoustics (CCRMA.
pronounced "karma"), located in the recently
renovated Knoll. Alea II generally gives one per

formance each quarter, and CCRMA gives several
performances each year, often in Frost Amphithea
ter under the stars.
The department publishes a quarterly calendar of
events, which can be obtained from the department.
If you wish to buy tickets for an event in advance,
you can purchase them at Tresidder Ticket Office.

Famed violinist Isaac Stern is one of the big-name classical artists who make occasional guest appearances
with the San Francisco Symphony.
The Department of Music also
sponsors many performing
groups. These groups offer music
ranging from Gregorian chants to
the most avant-garde computer
music and jazz. The department
invites all students to participate
in department ensembles.
Auditions for all ensembles will
take place all day during both
registration days, Sept. 28 and 29.

sons, or concert schedules.
STARTS (Student Arts at
Stanford) is a student group,
headquartered in Tresidder,
which works to involve students
in the arts. It sponsors a truly
wide variety of events: lectures,
art exhibits, excursions around
the Bay Area, classes in callig
raphy, dancing, music, etc., and
large-scale events such as the
Stanford Christmas Faire and
Plant and Poster sale. And, of

course, there's also music.
STARTS puts on popular noon
concerts on the Tresidder patio
featuring local rock and jazz
groups, as well as occasionial pro
grams at the Coffee House and at
Encina Station.
At an institution that doesn't
have many "institutions" of its
own, the Stanford Savoyards
stand out. For the past several
years, they have performed Gil
bert & Sullivan operettas in
Dinkelspiel Auditorium. The
Savoyards' membership is drawn
from all parts of the University:
students, faculty, staff and com
munity members work together
to put on the shows.
This only covers the more for
mal instances of music on
campus. Although you can expect
to go to Oakland Coliseum and
the nearby Shoreline Amphithea
tre for the big-name rock con
certs, the springtime Grateful
Dead shows in Stanford's Frost
Amphitheater are experiences
not to be missed.
And when budgets allow, dorm
and frats will forgo the DJ and in
stead feature live music for par

ties, especially during spring
quarter. Some excellent campus
bands as well as a few big-name
local bands make appearances.
The best-known Bay Area pur
veyor of classical music is also the
one least popular among students
— the San Francisco Opera. The
opera, on the basis of its numer
ous big-name guest stars, is
world-renowned. This season's
lineup includes such all-time
favorites as "The Barber of
Seville," "The Magic Flute" and
"Romeo and Juliet." All perfor
mances are in the War Memorial
Opera House (Civic Center, San
Francisco, Van Ness Avenue and
Grove Street).
In the City, the Pocket Opera
presents opera on a small scale at
the On Broadway Theatre, 433
Broadway, and the Lamplighters
perform operettas at the
Presentation Theater on Turk
near Masonic.
The San Francisco Symphony,
while certainly respectable, does
not have quite the world-class
status accorded the Opera. But
critical opinion has improved
every year to the point where now

the symphony is ranked among
the best in the country. Under the
direction of Herbert Blomstedt,
the symphony keeps garnering
better and better reviews and
more and more honors. Going to
the symphony is a very popular
cultural activity among students,
largely because of the symphony's
student outreach program. Many
dorms buy season tickets to the
symphony so students can attend
for reduced or free admission.
Programs at the symphony gener
ally run from one to two weeks,
Wednesday through Sunday.
The San Jose Symphony, con
ducted by George Cleve, is
known mainly for its extensive
Mostly Mozart series, given every
summer. All performances are in
the San Jose Performing Arts
Center (one of the area's best
auditoriums) in downtown San
Jose.
If in doubt about Bay Area
music — or theater, cinema or art
— remember to think pink: the
pink section of the Sunday San
Francisco Chronicle is an invalua
ble, comprehensive resource.
