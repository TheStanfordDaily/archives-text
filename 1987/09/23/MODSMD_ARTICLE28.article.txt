# Passing the screen test
## How local movie houses measure up 
### 
So you've seen the latest James Bond
flick three times and managed to avoid
that new Madonna movie. You're hip
now, but — suddenly, in the midst of the
sun, tun and work on campus, you'll re
member that there are new movies out
there.
Yes, if something is happening in
greater Palo Alto it's probably movies —
and there are plenty of theaters to choose
from. Closer to home, there are a few
good campus film series, at prices much
cheaper than the commercial rates off
campus.
To start with, the original, the one and
only . . .
The ASSU Sunday Hicks, which are
scheduled — surprise! — every Sunday
night in Memorial Auditorium during the
quarter, feature new or nearly new
releases. Memorial Auditorium has a
good sound system and a fairly large
screen, so you can expect to enjoy the
movie as well as the numerous loud com
ments throughout from the audience.
The movies are usually fun crowd
pleasers, with an offbeat one or two
("The Killing Fields" and "Blue Velvet"
in recent years, for example) joining the
list. Come early for the paper fights.
Also, you may notice that during the be
ginning credits the crowd will cheer and
boo alternately for the actors/actresses.
It's, well, one of those Stanford things.
The Tuesday Film Series works to
bring rare and offbeat films of high artis
tic value to campus. Often co-sponsored
by various campus organizations, these

movies offer students and faculty a
thought-provoking alternative to stan
dard fare Hollywood cinema.
Haus Mitteleuropa, the German theme
house, sponsors a weekly film series
throughout the year. German, Austrian
and Swiss films are shown Thursday
nights in the living room of "Haus Mitt,"
located on Mayfield Ave. The series
usually offers a good mix of both better
and lesser-known films and directors.
The audience at these movies often
laughs at jokes that haven't been in
cluded in the subtitles — sometimes a
little bewildering to those of us who are
not particularly fluent in German. Haus
Mitt's living room is small and often
crowded, so don't expect much in the
way of viewing comfort.
Other film series on campus may ap
pear on a quarter-by-quarter basis, spon
sored by various organizations including
STARTS and Bechtel International Cen
ter. Watch for fliers around campus and
check The Daily's "Once Around the
Quad" section for information about
these programs.
Theaters in Palo Alto, Menlo Park and
Mountain View are mostly within biking
distance of the Stanford campus
(although this may be the time to
befriend your neighbor's car-owning
roommate). Admission prices hover in
the $5> to $6 range.
Aquarius — The Aquarius, on Emer
son between University Avenue and Lyt
ton Avenue, has two small cinemas that
show mostly foreign films, with an occa

sional "small" American feature, like last
year's popular "Something Wild." Since
it is one of Palo Alto's major claims to
culture, the Aquarius is nearly always
crowded on Friday and Saturday nights;
the Palo Alto moviegoing crowd tends to
adopt certain movies that open at the
Aquarius — "Carmen" or "My Life as a
Dog"— and keep them playing there for

months. It's your basic (essential) univer
sity theater, and though its films are of
highly variable quality, the management
has never compromised its decision to
show art house selections.
Stanford — Revived as a movie theater
last year after many years of neglect, the
Stanford Theater on University treats
viewers to first-run movies in a beautiful

old-style moviehouse setting.
Varsity — For over a decade, the
venerable New Varsity theater and res
taurant on University offered audiences a
solid lineup of repertory films, live music,
good food and even better atmosphere.
