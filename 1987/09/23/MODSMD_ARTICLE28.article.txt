# Passing the screen test
## How local movie houses measure up 
### 
So you've seen the latest James Bond
flick three times and managed to avoid
that new Madonna movie. You're hip
now, but — suddenly, in the midst of the
sun, tun and work on campus, you'll re
member that there are new movies out
there.
Yes, if something is happening in
greater Palo Alto it's probably movies —
and there are plenty of theaters to choose
from. Closer to home, there are a few
good campus film series, at prices much
cheaper than the commercial rates off
campus.
To start with, the original, the one and
only . . .
The ASSU Sunday Hicks, which are
scheduled — surprise! — every Sunday
night in Memorial Auditorium during the
quarter, feature new or nearly new
releases. Memorial Auditorium has a
good sound system and a fairly large
screen, so you can expect to enjoy the
movie as well as the numerous loud com
ments throughout from the audience.
The movies are usually fun crowd
pleasers, with an offbeat one or two
("The Killing Fields" and "Blue Velvet"
in recent years, for example) joining the
list. Come early for the paper fights.
Also, you may notice that during the be
ginning credits the crowd will cheer and
boo alternately for the actors/actresses.
It's, well, one of those Stanford things.
The Tuesday Film Series works to
bring rare and offbeat films of high artis
tic value to campus. Often co-sponsored
by various campus organizations, these

movies offer students and faculty a
thought-provoking alternative to stan
dard fare Hollywood cinema.
Haus Mitteleuropa, the German theme
house, sponsors a weekly film series
throughout the year. German, Austrian
and Swiss films are shown Thursday
nights in the living room of "Haus Mitt,"
located on Mayfield Ave. The series
usually offers a good mix of both better
and lesser-known films and directors.
The audience at these movies often
laughs at jokes that haven't been in
cluded in the subtitles — sometimes a
little bewildering to those of us who are
not particularly fluent in German. Haus
Mitt's living room is small and often
crowded, so don't expect much in the
way of viewing comfort.
Other film series on campus may ap
pear on a quarter-by-quarter basis, spon
sored by various organizations including
STARTS and Bechtel International Cen
ter. Watch for fliers around campus and
check The Daily's "Once Around the
Quad" section for information about
these programs.
Theaters in Palo Alto, Menlo Park and
Mountain View are mostly within biking
distance of the Stanford campus
(although this may be the time to
befriend your neighbor's car-owning
roommate). Admission prices hover in
the $5> to $6 range.
Aquarius — The Aquarius, on Emer
son between University Avenue and Lyt
ton Avenue, has two small cinemas that
show mostly foreign films, with an occa

sional "small" American feature, like last
year's popular "Something Wild." Since
it is one of Palo Alto's major claims to
culture, the Aquarius is nearly always
crowded on Friday and Saturday nights;
the Palo Alto moviegoing crowd tends to
adopt certain movies that open at the
Aquarius — "Carmen" or "My Life as a
Dog"— and keep them playing there for

months. It's your basic (essential) univer
sity theater, and though its films are of
highly variable quality, the management
has never compromised its decision to
show art house selections.
Stanford — Revived as a movie theater
last year after many years of neglect, the
Stanford Theater on University treats
viewers to first-run movies in a beautiful

old-style moviehouse setting.
Varsity — For over a decade, the
venerable New Varsity theater and res
taurant on University offered audiences a
solid lineup of repertory films, live music,
good food and even better atmosphere.
With its open-air atrium, espresso bar

and huge viewing screen, the New
Varsity was easily the most pleas
ant place to see a movie in town.
Bought out by new owners last
spring, and rechristened as just
tne Varsity, the theater now
shows first-run art and indepen
dent films. Temporarily closed for
renovation, the Varsity's restau
rant is slated to reopen in Janu
ary.
Fine Arts — On California
Avenue, just east of El Camino
Real — in the midst of the nicest
commercial area in Palo Alto.
The Fine Arts is a fairly nice
theater; it was known in the past

for grabbing hold of movies like
" Amadeus" that it eould show for
months and months, but lately the
turnover has been more rapid.
Palo Alto Square — These twin
theaters take up the bottom floor
of a very bland-looking office
building at the corner of El
Camino Real and Page Mill
Road. They draw mostly high
school kids, because they tend to
show pop films like "Beverly
Hills Cop II" and "Raiders of the
Lost Ark," but they are undeni
ably comfortable and convenient.
Guild and Park — These are
Menlo Parks' two movie theaters.
They are located a couple of
blocks from each other on El
Camino. Each offers first-run
movies of all kinds, including "art
house films." They are pleasant

theaters, and pretty reliable with
regard to programming. Gener
ally speaking, at least one of them
is offering a film worth seeing at
any given time.
Old Mill 6 — The bane of a
moviegoer's existence — you
can't avoid seeing films here be
cause since there are six screens,
two or three new pictures arrive

every week. Besides, the bargain
twilight shows are very seductive.
But the screens are tiny, the
theater is always crowded and
you move from line to line until
you feel you're being processed.
Furthermore, it's an offensively
ugly environment in which to see
movies — the theater looks
vaguely like a video arcade. But if

you must, it is located in the Old
Mill Shopping Mall on San An
tonio Road, near the San Antonio
Shopping Center. (The easiest
way to get to it is via Alma; if you
take the San Antonio turnoff,
you'll immediately find signs for
the Old Mill.)
Century 10 — Another monster
of a theater, this house has ten

screens and looks like an airport
terminal.
Century 10 is usually crowded.
But don't worry. Because of the
variety of movies it shows, if you
don't get into your first choice,
there is probably another one
you'll be able to see. It's about a
15 minute drive from Stanford,
located at 1500 Stierlin Road.

So you've seen the latest James Bond

But the screens are tiny, the
theater is always crowded and
you move from line to line until
you feel you're being processed.
Furthermore, it's an offensively
ugly environment in which to see
movies — the theater looks
vaguely like a video arcade. But if

you must, it is located in the Old
Mill Shopping Mall on San An
tonio Road, near the San Antonio
Shopping Center. (The easiest
way to get to it is via Alma; if you
take the San Antonio turnoff,
you'll immediately find signs for
the Old Mill.)
Century 10 — Another monster
of a theater, this house has ten

screens and looks like an airport
terminal.
Century 10 is usually crowded.
But don't worry. Because of the
variety of movies it shows, if you
don't get into your first choice,
there is probably another one
you'll be able to see. It's about a
15 minute drive from Stanford,
located at 1500 Stierlin Road.

So you've seen the latest James Bond
flick three times and managed to avoid
that new Madonna movie. You're hip
now, but — suddenly, in the midst of the
sun, tun and work on campus, you'll re
member that there are new movies out
there.
Yes, if something is happening in
greater Palo Alto it's probably movies —
and there are plenty of theaters to choose
from. Closer to home, there are a few
good campus film series, at prices much
cheaper than the commercial rates off
campus.
To start with, the original, the one and
only . . .
The ASSU Sunday Hicks, which are
scheduled — surprise! — every Sunday
night in Memorial Auditorium during the
quarter, feature new or nearly new
releases. Memorial Auditorium has a
good sound system and a fairly large
screen, so you can expect to enjoy the
movie as well as the numerous loud com
ments throughout from the audience.
The movies are usually fun crowd
pleasers, with an offbeat one or two
("The Killing Fields" and "Blue Velvet"
in recent years, for example) joining the
list. Come early for the paper fights.
Also, you may notice that during the be
ginning credits the crowd will cheer and
boo alternately for the actors/actresses.
It's, well, one of those Stanford things.
The Tuesday Film Series works to
bring rare and offbeat films of high artis
tic value to campus. Often co-sponsored
by various campus organizations, these

movies offer students and faculty a
thought-provoking alternative to stan
dard fare Hollywood cinema.
Haus Mitteleuropa, the German theme
house, sponsors a weekly film series
throughout the year. German, Austrian
and Swiss films are shown Thursday
nights in the living room of "Haus Mitt,"
located on Mayfield Ave. The series
usually offers a good mix of both better
and lesser-known films and directors.
The audience at these movies often
laughs at jokes that haven't been in
cluded in the subtitles — sometimes a
little bewildering to those of us who are
not particularly fluent in German. Haus
Mitt's living room is small and often
crowded, so don't expect much in the
way of viewing comfort.
Other film series on campus may ap
pear on a quarter-by-quarter basis, spon
sored by various organizations including
STARTS and Bechtel International Cen
ter. Watch for fliers around campus and
check The Daily's "Once Around the
Quad" section for information about
these programs.
Theaters in Palo Alto, Menlo Park and
Mountain View are mostly within biking
distance of the Stanford campus
(although this may be the time to
befriend your neighbor's car-owning
roommate). Admission prices hover in
the $5> to $6 range.
Aquarius — The Aquarius, on Emer
son between University Avenue and Lyt
ton Avenue, has two small cinemas that
show mostly foreign films, with an occa

sional "small" American feature, like last
year's popular "Something Wild." Since
it is one of Palo Alto's major claims to
culture, the Aquarius is nearly always
crowded on Friday and Saturday nights;
the Palo Alto moviegoing crowd tends to
adopt certain movies that open at the
Aquarius — "Carmen" or "My Life as a
Dog"— and keep them playing there for

months. It's your basic (essential) univer
sity theater, and though its films are of
highly variable quality, the management
has never compromised its decision to
show art house selections.
Stanford — Revived as a movie theater
last year after many years of neglect, the
Stanford Theater on University treats
viewers to first-run movies in a beautiful

old-style moviehouse setting.
Varsity — For over a decade, the
venerable New Varsity theater and res
taurant on University offered audiences a
solid lineup of repertory films, live music,
good food and even better atmosphere.
With its open-air atrium, espresso bar

and huge viewing screen, the New
Varsity was easily the most pleas
ant place to see a movie in town.
Bought out by new owners last
spring, and rechristened as just
tne Varsity, the theater now
shows first-run art and indepen
dent films. Temporarily closed for
renovation, the Varsity's restau
rant is slated to reopen in Janu
ary.
Fine Arts — On California
Avenue, just east of El Camino
Real — in the midst of the nicest
commercial area in Palo Alto.
The Fine Arts is a fairly nice
theater; it was known in the past

for grabbing hold of movies like
" Amadeus" that it eould show for
months and months, but lately the
turnover has been more rapid.
Palo Alto Square — These twin
theaters take up the bottom floor
of a very bland-looking office
building at the corner of El
Camino Real and Page Mill
Road. They draw mostly high
school kids, because they tend to
show pop films like "Beverly
Hills Cop II" and "Raiders of the
Lost Ark," but they are undeni
ably comfortable and convenient.
Guild and Park — These are
Menlo Parks' two movie theaters.
They are located a couple of
blocks from each other on El
Camino. Each offers first-run
movies of all kinds, including "art
house films." They are pleasant

theaters, and pretty reliable with
regard to programming. Gener
ally speaking, at least one of them
is offering a film worth seeing at
any given time.
Old Mill 6 — The bane of a
moviegoer's existence — you
can't avoid seeing films here be
cause since there are six screens,
two or three new pictures arrive

every week. Besides, the bargain
twilight shows are very seductive.
