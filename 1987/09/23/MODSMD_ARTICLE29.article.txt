# Good eats and good times
## Where to go when Food Service loses its luster: a survey 
### 
Where the Cardinal flocks
Stanford hangouts change from
year to year, of course, hut there
are such things as old standards.
Half the people in Kamona's
(541 Ramona St., Palo Alto) on
any given weekend night will be
from Stanford; the crush is partic
ularly intense before anu after
basketball games. Most of them
will be eating the second-best
pizza in the area, while those who
want to be different chew on
calzones or decent hamburgers.
The once-great Ramona*s salad
bar retains only a shade of its
former glory.
Down the street at the Good
Earth Restaurant (185 University
Ave., Palo Alto), you'll find a dif
ferent, slightly older Stanford
crowd eating chic health food.
The iced tea at this time of year is
particularly refreshing, and so are
the yogurt-based milkshakes.

Of course, "hangouts" in the
true Stanford sense of the word
are places you go to swill beer,
and there are a few of those, too.
The Dutch Gootc (357 Ala
meda de las Pulgas, Menlo Park),
a functional sort of place where
it's standing room only on Senior
Pub Nights, and The Oasis (241
El Camino, Menlo Park), a down
right ugly place that has been wit
ness to untold decades of Stan
ford history. One thing to know:
refer to the two establishments as
"The Goose" and"The
respectively.
The granddaddy of them all,
though, is the Alpine Inn Beer
Garden (3915 Alpine Road, Por
tola Valley), more commonly
known as "/ott's." If you can fig
ure out why it's called Zott's, then
you are very intelligent and you
deserve to be at Stanford.
Zott's serves robust rectangular
burgers, French fries so good that

even the French would be proud
to have their name attached to
them, and of course, lots of beer.
Throw in a massive outdoor
eating area, a heavy contingent of
locals to dilute the Stanford in
flux, plus a nifty jukebox that
seemingly has every Elvis Presley
hit ever, and you know why this
place is a drawing card.
One of the most popular new
hangouts is the Stanford Pub
(445 Emerson, Palo Alto). Ex
pect a lively, sometimes rowdy
crowd often affiliated with
various athletic teams.
Another newish spot is the
Vortex (260 California Ave., Palo
Alto), which used to be the
Keystone Palo Alto, but now
plays lots of new wave/dance
music and features a graffiti
splattered, mannequin-dangling
interior.
In recent years an attempt has
been made to turn The Lan
cashire Tavern (547 Emerson St.,
Palo Alto) into a Stanford hang
out of the Pub Night variety, and
this year it seems to have finally
caught on. Be sure to try the
cider.
If you'd like your nightlife a bit
rowdier, try St. James Infirmary
(390 Moffett Blvd., Mountain
View) or Antonio's Nut House
(321 California Ave., Palo Alto),
places where you can get into a
fight if you try hard enough or
look enough like a Stanford stu
dent. Antonio's remodeled
during the summer and now looks
quite spiffy inside.
Slices of life
Frankie, Johnnie & I uigi Too
(939 El Camino, Mountain View)
has no peer in pizza. What it does
have are long waits on some
weekend nights, which can fly by
if a large group of people go and
drink while waiting (it you look
21, you'll be accosted by a roving
cocktail waitress the minute you
sign in). Try the fresh tomato and
gaflic pizza, a house specialty, or

the ever-popular stromboli or
Hawaiian. Avoid the Italian din
ners, which are often dreadful.
A distant second to FJ&L is
Ramona's, which has decent New
York-style (i.e. heavy and spicy)
pizza and slightly shorter waits,
and is closer to campus.
Honorable mention goes to the
Argentine pizza with barbecue
sauce (ladled on in place of
tomato sauce) at Jose's (2275 E£l
Camino, Palo Alto), and the pizza
with almost anything on it at
Applewood Inn (1001 El Camino,
Mcnlo Park).
Mountain Mike's, at 2000 El
Camino, offers decent pizza and a
location very close to campus.
And new to the area is Pizza a (io
(io, an ultra-modern pizza-by
the-slice joint on University.
Wonders of the Orient
There is a plethora of Chinese
restaurants in the Palo Alto area.
Here are just a few:
Generations of Stanfordites
have fallen in love with the mu
shu pork at Chef Chu's (1067 N.
San Antonio Road at El Camino
Real, Los Altos). This always
crowded Mandarin restaurant
prepares perfectly solid, unexcit
ing dishes — it's the ideal place
for large groups with diverse
tastes. The food's more exciting
at China First (675 El Camino,
Palo Alto), another place with a
big reputation. The cuisine here is
Szechuan/Hunan, albeit not too
spicy, and there are great dishes
on the menu.
Also, China Lion (3345 El
Camino, Palo Alto), is a nearby
alternative with Manda
rin/Szeehuan cooking. A new fa
vorite is Jing-Jing's (443 Emer
son Rd., Palo Alto), a Szech
wan/Hunan restaurant with excel
lent hot and sour soup.
On a more modest scale, there
are three worthwhile Chinese
places in Menlo Park. The first
two, Yuen Yung (639 Santa Cruz
Ave.) and Su Hong (1039 El

Camino), are both eclectic but
primarily Cantonese/Mandarin.
Su Hong has better food, Yuen
Yung more interesting decor — it
looks like a cross between a
Chinese restaurant and a fern bar.
A personal favorite is Ten Fu
(1352 El Camino Real), which
offers Szechwan, Hunan and
Mandarin food in a casual but
classy atmosphere. The service is
excellent and both the potstickers
and the wonton soup are other
wordly. Don't miss the fried
bananas for dessert.
If you've been starving yourself
passing up some of the tasty
entrees served by Food Service,
the place to catch up on lost food
is Colonel l.ee's Mongolian Bar-B-
Q (304 Castro, Mountain View),
basically an all-you-can-eat place
serving a rib-tickling variety of
barbecued morsels including
beef, pork, lamb and turkey.
The area is graced by a bevy of
Japanese restaurants, most ser
ving sushi. One of the best is
Mivake Restaurant (261 Univer
sity), which is quaint and not too
expensive.
South of the border
Palo Alto lost its only really
good Mexican restaurant when
the Andes Mexican Restaurant, a
Whiskey Gulch anomaly, folded
several years back. Now a trip to

Menlo Park or Los Altos is re
quired.
Rosita's Taqueria (171 A sth
Ave., Redwood City) occupies a
storefront in an uninviting part of
Redwood City, but makes the
only authentic burritos-to-go in
the area. These are big sloppy
things that can't be eaten while
driving a car, and Rosita's has a
wide variety, including pork and
beef in several sauces, steak,
chicken, sausage and tongue.
Rosita's also has a good selection
of Mexican beers and soft drinks
— you haven't lived until you've
had a Boing soda.
Lstrellita (971 North San An
tonio Rd., Los Altos) isn't what it
used to be, but it still has great
chimichangas. There are two pas
sable family-style Mexican joints
in Menlo Park: La Luna Mexican
Cafe (1137 Chestnut St.) and
Caleta (1 143 D Crane St.).
The Senor Taco Drive-In (3490
El Camino Real, Palo Alto) looks
modest, but has the burritos that
made Mexico famous.
If you don't mind a drive, the
best Latin restaurant around is
probably EI Calderon (699 El
Calderon Ave., Mountain View),
which is hidden away in a small
shopping center and has a
Mexican/Salvadoran menu.
However, if you are insistent
