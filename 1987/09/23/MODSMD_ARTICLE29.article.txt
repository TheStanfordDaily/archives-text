# Good eats and good times
## Where to go when Food Service loses its luster: a survey 
### 
Where the Cardinal flocks
Stanford hangouts change from
year to year, of course, hut there
are such things as old standards.
Half the people in Kamona's
(541 Ramona St., Palo Alto) on
any given weekend night will be
from Stanford; the crush is partic
ularly intense before anu after
basketball games. Most of them
will be eating the second-best
pizza in the area, while those who
want to be different chew on
calzones or decent hamburgers.
The once-great Ramona*s salad
bar retains only a shade of its
former glory.
Down the street at the Good
Earth Restaurant (185 University
Ave., Palo Alto), you'll find a dif
ferent, slightly older Stanford
crowd eating chic health food.
The iced tea at this time of year is
particularly refreshing, and so are
the yogurt-based milkshakes.

Of course, "hangouts" in the
true Stanford sense of the word
are places you go to swill beer,
and there are a few of those, too.
The Dutch Gootc (357 Ala
meda de las Pulgas, Menlo Park),
a functional sort of place where
it's standing room only on Senior
Pub Nights, and The Oasis (241
El Camino, Menlo Park), a down
right ugly place that has been wit
ness to untold decades of Stan
ford history. One thing to know:
refer to the two establishments as
"The Goose" and"The
respectively.
The granddaddy of them all,
though, is the Alpine Inn Beer
Garden (3915 Alpine Road, Por
tola Valley), more commonly
known as "/ott's." If you can fig
ure out why it's called Zott's, then
you are very intelligent and you
deserve to be at Stanford.
Zott's serves robust rectangular
burgers, French fries so good that

even the French would be proud
to have their name attached to
them, and of course, lots of beer.
Throw in a massive outdoor
eating area, a heavy contingent of
locals to dilute the Stanford in
flux, plus a nifty jukebox that
seemingly has every Elvis Presley
hit ever, and you know why this
place is a drawing card.
One of the most popular new
hangouts is the Stanford Pub
(445 Emerson, Palo Alto). Ex
pect a lively, sometimes rowdy
crowd often affiliated with
various athletic teams.
Another newish spot is the
Vortex (260 California Ave., Palo
Alto), which used to be the
Keystone Palo Alto, but now
plays lots of new wave/dance
music and features a graffiti
splattered, mannequin-dangling
interior.
In recent years an attempt has
been made to turn The Lan
cashire Tavern (547 Emerson St.,
Palo Alto) into a Stanford hang
out of the Pub Night variety, and
this year it seems to have finally
caught on. Be sure to try the
cider.
If you'd like your nightlife a bit
rowdier, try St. James Infirmary
(390 Moffett Blvd., Mountain
View) or Antonio's Nut House
(321 California Ave., Palo Alto),
places where you can get into a
fight if you try hard enough or
look enough like a Stanford stu
dent. Antonio's remodeled
during the summer and now looks
quite spiffy inside.
Slices of life
Frankie, Johnnie & I uigi Too
(939 El Camino, Mountain View)
has no peer in pizza. What it does
have are long waits on some
weekend nights, which can fly by
if a large group of people go and
drink while waiting (it you look
21, you'll be accosted by a roving
cocktail waitress the minute you
sign in). Try the fresh tomato and
gaflic pizza, a house specialty, or

the ever-popular stromboli or
Hawaiian. Avoid the Italian din
ners, which are often dreadful.
A distant second to FJ&L is
Ramona's, which has decent New
York-style (i.e. heavy and spicy)
pizza and slightly shorter waits,
and is closer to campus.
Honorable mention goes to the
Argentine pizza with barbecue
sauce (ladled on in place of
tomato sauce) at Jose's (2275 E£l
Camino, Palo Alto), and the pizza
with almost anything on it at
Applewood Inn (1001 El Camino,
Mcnlo Park).
Mountain Mike's, at 2000 El
Camino, offers decent pizza and a
location very close to campus.
And new to the area is Pizza a (io
(io, an ultra-modern pizza-by
the-slice joint on University.
Wonders of the Orient
There is a plethora of Chinese
restaurants in the Palo Alto area.
Here are just a few:
Generations of Stanfordites
have fallen in love with the mu
shu pork at Chef Chu's (1067 N.
San Antonio Road at El Camino
Real, Los Altos). This always
crowded Mandarin restaurant
prepares perfectly solid, unexcit
ing dishes — it's the ideal place
for large groups with diverse
tastes. The food's more exciting
at China First (675 El Camino,
Palo Alto), another place with a
big reputation. The cuisine here is
Szechuan/Hunan, albeit not too
spicy, and there are great dishes
on the menu.
Also, China Lion (3345 El
Camino, Palo Alto), is a nearby
alternative with Manda
rin/Szeehuan cooking. A new fa
vorite is Jing-Jing's (443 Emer
son Rd., Palo Alto), a Szech
wan/Hunan restaurant with excel
lent hot and sour soup.
On a more modest scale, there
are three worthwhile Chinese
places in Menlo Park. The first
two, Yuen Yung (639 Santa Cruz
Ave.) and Su Hong (1039 El

Camino), are both eclectic but
primarily Cantonese/Mandarin.
Su Hong has better food, Yuen
Yung more interesting decor — it
looks like a cross between a
Chinese restaurant and a fern bar.
A personal favorite is Ten Fu
(1352 El Camino Real), which
offers Szechwan, Hunan and
Mandarin food in a casual but
classy atmosphere. The service is
excellent and both the potstickers
and the wonton soup are other
wordly. Don't miss the fried
bananas for dessert.
If you've been starving yourself
passing up some of the tasty
entrees served by Food Service,
the place to catch up on lost food
is Colonel l.ee's Mongolian Bar-B-
Q (304 Castro, Mountain View),
basically an all-you-can-eat place
serving a rib-tickling variety of
barbecued morsels including
beef, pork, lamb and turkey.
The area is graced by a bevy of
Japanese restaurants, most ser
ving sushi. One of the best is
Mivake Restaurant (261 Univer
sity), which is quaint and not too
expensive.
South of the border
Palo Alto lost its only really
good Mexican restaurant when
the Andes Mexican Restaurant, a
Whiskey Gulch anomaly, folded
several years back. Now a trip to

Menlo Park or Los Altos is re
quired.
Rosita's Taqueria (171 A sth
Ave., Redwood City) occupies a
storefront in an uninviting part of
Redwood City, but makes the
only authentic burritos-to-go in
the area. These are big sloppy
things that can't be eaten while
driving a car, and Rosita's has a
wide variety, including pork and
beef in several sauces, steak,
chicken, sausage and tongue.
Rosita's also has a good selection
of Mexican beers and soft drinks
— you haven't lived until you've
had a Boing soda.
Lstrellita (971 North San An
tonio Rd., Los Altos) isn't what it
used to be, but it still has great
chimichangas. There are two pas
sable family-style Mexican joints
in Menlo Park: La Luna Mexican
Cafe (1137 Chestnut St.) and
Caleta (1 143 D Crane St.).
The Senor Taco Drive-In (3490
El Camino Real, Palo Alto) looks
modest, but has the burritos that
made Mexico famous.
If you don't mind a drive, the
best Latin restaurant around is
probably EI Calderon (699 El
Calderon Ave., Mountain View),
which is hidden away in a small
shopping center and has a
Mexican/Salvadoran menu.
However, if you are insistent


about staying in the area, good
food and yummy margaritas can
be found at all of the following
places: Chili's (700 El Camino,
Menlo Park, or 2560 El Camino,
Mountain View), Compadres
Mexican Bar & Grill (3877 El
Camino, Palo Alto) both of which
serve great margaritas, and
Armadillo Willy's BBQ & Cafe
(1031 N. San Antonio Rd., Los
Altos) and Acapulco's (2515 El
Camino Real, Palo Alto).
Vive la France!
Without going into too much
detail, there's one local restaurant
that comes close to meeting the
bistro ideal (good food, relatively
low prices) Le Pot au Feu (1149
El Camino, Menlo Park). Some
what more formal and relatively
expensive is Chez Louis (4170 El

Camino, Palo Alto), virtually an
institution.
Fishies from the deep blue sea
The Big Two for serious
seafood in the area are Scott's
Seafood Bar & Grill (2300 E.
Bayshore Rd.) and The Fish Mar
ket (3150 El Camino). Scott's is
the posher of the two, but The
Fish Market is closer and has a
great on-the-wharf feel, even
though it's right next to
McDonald's.
Deli delights
When the sandwich urge
strikes, try Togo's (several loca
tions, including 518 University
Ave.), Manhattan West (420
Emerson, Palo Alto) or the deli
counters at Safeway (several loca
tions) or the Town and Country
Market (corner of Embarcadero
and El Camino.)
The Bedrock (2999 El
Camino), formerly the
wondrously named "Joy of

Junque," offers a good burger
and shake combination.
Spirits in the night
There are as many different
kinds of bars as there are
drinkers, and the most popular
ones — the Goose, the 'O' and
the Pub — we've already dis
cussed. We're concerned here
with the bar as a comfortable en
vironment in which to drink, as
opposed to a supportive environ
ment in which to get drunk.
The Gatehouse (265 Lytton
Ave., Palo Alto) is a snitzy res
taurant by day a snitzy bar by
night, and one of the nicest places
in which to sit around in Palo
Alto. The bar at Mama's (379
Stanford Shopping Center) is a
bit out of the way, but it has a cer
tain hushed elegance that makes
it attractive.
Henry's (482 University, Palo
Alto), is hot and crowded once
the dinner customers clear out,
but there's no one on the make;
just lots of successful young Palo

Altans enjoying their success in
one of their favorite bars.
For a taste of the exotic, take a
trip up the Bayshore to San
Mateo and visit The Lanai (4070
S. El Camino). The atmosphere
will remind you of a Gilligan's Is
land nightmare and the drinks are
expensive but huge and strong.
If you're looking for something
a bit more staid, try the bar at the
rear of the London House (630
Ramona St., Palo Alto), a loving
recreation of an English pub
where you can get most any
British beer you want, pub snacks
and a game of darts. t
Yuppie love
Style is everything in a Yuppie
hangout, and Mac Arthur Park
(27 University, Palo Alto, near
the train station) is in one of the
approved styles: big, open, white
panelled spaces, wood floor, brass
railings everywhere. The food
ranges from fair to middling —
except for the barbecued meats,
which are exceptional. Be sure to

order something from the grill,
especially the ribs.
Another style is represented by
Waverley Place (560 Waverley
St, Palo Alto), which is all glass
and bleached wood and serves ex
pensive (but surprisingly good)
pastas and seafood dishes.
Along with these younger res
taurants, a couple of established
Palo Alto restaurants have swung
with the times: The Gatehouse,
one of Palo Alto's prettiest places
to eat and drink, is taken over by

the young come dinner hour, and
Henry's is a favorite with the local
advertising/design community
that lives off Silicon Valley.
Ivet them eat coffeecake
Morning eaters are lucky here
— Palo Alto and Menlo Park
have lots of good restaurants that
specialize in breakfast and lunch.
First among equals is Late for

the Train (150 Middle-field Rd.,
Menlo Park, near the train sta
tion), a folksy place that makes
great omelettes, divine blitzes and
fruit pancakes and the usual
salads and sandwiches, plus ever
changing desserts. If you go on a
weekend, particularly a Sunday,
expect at least a 30-minute wait;
it's best, if you can, to go for an
early or late weekday lunch, when
you can often be seated immedi
ately.
Modeled along much the same
lines is Hobee's (two locations in
Palo Alto: 4224 El Camino and
Town and Country Village, across
from the Stadium), a family oper
ation with more branches around
the peninsula. Hobee's follows
more traditional American
breakfast lines — sausage, eggs,
ham — but isn't lacking for fresh
squeezed juices, fruit and other
California trimmings, and it has a
truly addicting coffeecake that
comes with most of the break
fasts. Both Hobee's and Late for
the Train provide free coffee for
waiting crowds.
The Farmer's Market (448
California Ave., Palo Alto) has a
small menu, spotty service (semi
cafeteria style) and the ambiance
of a butcher shop, but it serves

great breakfasts (try the apple
pancakes or a ham/swiss/apple
omelette) at relatively low prices.
Finally, there's the favorite
morning meeting spot of Stanford
sororities — Dinah's Poolside
Coffee Shop (4269 El Camino,
Palo Alto.
In the midnight hour
There used to be a wealth of
places where you could go at 2
a.m. — or 4 or 6 a.m. — with the
gang and be obnoxious, or with a
loved one to fortify yourself in an
emotional crisis, or by yourself to
studv and mainline some caffeine.
Then Stickney's cut back to
midnight and became a trendy
tourist/alumni hangout, and Luv's
went to 24 hours on weekends
only and eventually became a
singles pickup joint. In the old
days, going to Denny's or Lyons
didn't even cross your mind; now
they're all that's left.
Closer (by about 100 yards)
and friendlier is Denny's (426 El
Camino, Palo Alto). Denny's is
also cheaper than Lyons, has food
that's at least as good or better
and tackier vinyl.
So why go to Lyons (4298 El
Camino, Los Altos) at all? Be
cause sometimes you need a
change. Lyons is darker, the
waitresses are younger. And if
you're determined to eat a lot of
food at 4 a.m. and get really sick,

there's nothing like a Mighty Lion
Burger. The patty melt is also
pretty good, and the pancakes are
decent.
The only competition left for
these corporate monsters is the
University Creamery (209 Uni
versity, Palo Alto), which sensed
the vacuum and went to 24-hour
service about two years ago. The
Creamery has pretty mediocre
greasy-spoon food, but the
milkshakes are big and good
(they use Bud's ice cream) and
it's a lot closer to campus —
within biking range, even. Plus
you can call your friends and
loved ones on the phones
supplied to some of the booths!
I scream for you
Everyone loves ice cream, to be
sure, but no one can deny that the
Stanford area is practically
drowning in the stuff.
Within a quick drive of campus
are a Haagen-Dazs (Stanford
Barn, 700 Welch Rd.), two
Swenson's (440 University Ave.,
Palo Alto and 1350 El Camino,
Menlo Park), Blatz Folded Ice
Cream (101 California Ave., Palo
Alto), Double Rainbow (1083 El
Camino, Menlo Park), Rick's
Rather Rich Ice Cream
(Charleston at Middlefield, Palo
Alto) and the Peninsula
Creamery (corner of Hamilton
and Emerson, Palo Alto) and the

University Creamery.
Then there is an array of Italian
ice cream shops, including Gelato
Alota (2953 So. El Camino,*San
Mateo) and Gelato Classico (437
Emerson St., Palo Alto).
With such a wide variety to
choose from, you might sample
everything and then decide.
Three things to keep in mind:
the ice cream at Rick's is smooth,
rich and delicious, the home
made waffle cones and fold-ins at
Blatz are not to be missed, and
the Peninsula Creamery has great
ice cream plus the kind of roman
tic, '50s-throwback atmosphere
that your parents would appreci
ate. You should, too.
In this, the most health
conscious state in the Union,
traditional calorie-laden dessert
fare has to compete with a power
ful threat: frozen yogurt. For
those of you who just can't bring
yourselves to splurge on tradi
tional dessert fare, Palo Alto of
fers several good purveyors of
cooled curd. By far the easiest
place to get frozen yogurt is at the
Corner Pocket in Tresidder Un
ion. Although the Co Po's fro yo
isn't quite top notch, the many
toppings available are good,
varied and cheap.
Quality frozen yogurt can also
be found at the Yogurt Village in
the Stanford Shopping Center
and at Crouton's on University.

Wonders of the Orient
There is a plethora of Chinese
restaurants in the Palo Alto area.
Here are just a few:
Generations of Stanfordites
have fallen in love with the mu

prepares perfectly solid, unexcit

Also, China Lion (3345 El

alternative with Manda
rin/Szeehuan cooking. A new fa
vorite is Jing-Jing's (443 Emer
son Rd., Palo Alto), a Szech
wan/Hunan restaurant with excel
lent hot and sour soup.
On a more modest scale, there
are three worthwhile Chinese
places in Menlo Park. The first
two, Yuen Yung (639 Santa Cruz
Ave.) and Su Hong (1039 El

Camino), are both eclectic but
primarily Cantonese/Mandarin.
Su Hong has better food, Yuen
Yung more interesting decor — it
looks like a cross between a
Chinese restaurant and a fern bar.
A personal favorite is Ten Fu
(1352 El Camino Real), which
offers Szechwan, Hunan and
Mandarin food in a casual but
classy atmosphere. The service is
excellent and both the potstickers
and the wonton soup are other
wordly. Don't miss the fried

If you've been starving yourself

South of the border
Palo Alto lost its only really
good Mexican restaurant when
the Andes Mexican Restaurant, a
Whiskey Gulch anomaly, folded
several years back. Now a trip to

Menlo Park or Los Altos is re
quired.
Rosita's Taqueria (171 A sth

Lstrellita (971 North San An

sable family-style Mexican joints
in Menlo Park: La Luna Mexican
Cafe (1137 Chestnut St.) and
Caleta (1 143 D Crane St.).
The Senor Taco Drive-In (3490
El Camino Real, Palo Alto) looks
modest, but has the burritos that
made Mexico famous.
If you don't mind a drive, the
best Latin restaurant around is
probably EI Calderon (699 El
Calderon Ave., Mountain View),
which is hidden away in a small
shopping center and has a
Mexican/Salvadoran menu.
However, if you are insistent


about staying in the area, good
food and yummy margaritas can
be found at all of the following
places: Chili's (700 El Camino,
Menlo Park, or 2560 El Camino,
Mountain View), Compadres
Mexican Bar & Grill (3877 El
Camino, Palo Alto) both of which
serve great margaritas, and
Armadillo Willy's BBQ & Cafe
(1031 N. San Antonio Rd., Los
Altos) and Acapulco's (2515 El
Camino Real, Palo Alto).
Vive la France!
Without going into too much
detail, there's one local restaurant
that comes close to meeting the
bistro ideal (good food, relatively
low prices) Le Pot au Feu (1149
El Camino, Menlo Park). Some
what more formal and relatively
expensive is Chez Louis (4170 El

Camino, Palo Alto), virtually an

Fishies from the deep blue sea
The Big Two for serious
seafood in the area are Scott's
Seafood Bar & Grill (2300 E.
Bayshore Rd.) and The Fish Mar
ket (3150 El Camino). Scott's is
the posher of the two, but The
Fish Market is closer and has a
great on-the-wharf feel, even
though it's right next to
McDonald's.
Deli delights
When the sandwich urge
strikes, try Togo's (several loca
tions, including 518 University
Ave.), Manhattan West (420
Emerson, Palo Alto) or the deli
counters at Safeway (several loca
tions) or the Town and Country

Ivet them eat coffeecake

specialize in breakfast and lunch.
First among equals is Late for

the Train (150 Middle-field Rd.,
Menlo Park, near the train sta
tion), a folksy place that makes
great omelettes, divine blitzes and
fruit pancakes and the usual
salads and sandwiches, plus ever
changing desserts. If you go on a
weekend, particularly a Sunday,
expect at least a 30-minute wait;
it's best, if you can, to go for an
early or late weekday lunch, when
you can often be seated immedi
ately.
Modeled along much the same
lines is Hobee's (two locations in
Palo Alto: 4224 El Camino and
Town and Country Village, across
from the Stadium), a family oper
ation with more branches around
the peninsula. Hobee's follows
more traditional American
breakfast lines — sausage, eggs,
ham — but isn't lacking for fresh
squeezed juices, fruit and other
California trimmings, and it has a
truly addicting coffeecake that
comes with most of the break
fasts. Both Hobee's and Late for
the Train provide free coffee for
waiting crowds.
The Farmer's Market (448
California Ave., Palo Alto) has a
small menu, spotty service (semi
cafeteria style) and the ambiance
of a butcher shop, but it serves

great breakfasts (try the apple
pancakes or a ham/swiss/apple
omelette) at relatively low prices.
Finally, there's the favorite
morning meeting spot of Stanford
sororities — Dinah's Poolside
Coffee Shop (4269 El Camino,
Palo Alto.
In the midnight hour
There used to be a wealth of
places where you could go at 2
a.m. — or 4 or 6 a.m. — with the
gang and be obnoxious, or with a
loved one to fortify yourself in an
emotional crisis, or by yourself to
studv and mainline some caffeine.
Then Stickney's cut back to
midnight and became a trendy
tourist/alumni hangout, and Luv's
went to 24 hours on weekends
only and eventually became a
singles pickup joint. In the old
days, going to Denny's or Lyons
didn't even cross your mind; now
they're all that's left.
Closer (by about 100 yards)
and friendlier is Denny's (426 El
Camino, Palo Alto). Denny's is
also cheaper than Lyons, has food
that's at least as good or better
and tackier vinyl.
So why go to Lyons (4298 El
Camino, Los Altos) at all? Be
cause sometimes you need a
change. Lyons is darker, the
waitresses are younger. And if
you're determined to eat a lot of
food at 4 a.m. and get really sick,

there's nothing like a Mighty Lion
Burger. The patty melt is also
pretty good, and the pancakes are
decent.
The only competition left for
these corporate monsters is the
University Creamery (209 Uni
versity, Palo Alto), which sensed
the vacuum and went to 24-hour
service about two years ago. The
Creamery has pretty mediocre
greasy-spoon food, but the
milkshakes are big and good
(they use Bud's ice cream) and
it's a lot closer to campus —
within biking range, even. Plus
you can call your friends and
loved ones on the phones
supplied to some of the booths!
I scream for you
Everyone loves ice cream, to be
sure, but no one can deny that the
Stanford area is practically
drowning in the stuff.
Within a quick drive of campus
are a Haagen-Dazs (Stanford
Barn, 700 Welch Rd.), two
Swenson's (440 University Ave.,
Palo Alto and 1350 El Camino,
Menlo Park), Blatz Folded Ice
Cream (101 California Ave., Palo
Alto), Double Rainbow (1083 El
Camino, Menlo Park), Rick's
Rather Rich Ice Cream
(Charleston at Middlefield, Palo
Alto) and the Peninsula
Creamery (corner of Hamilton
and Emerson, Palo Alto) and the

University Creamery.
Then there is an array of Italian
ice cream shops, including Gelato
Alota (2953 So. El Camino,*San
Mateo) and Gelato Classico (437
Emerson St., Palo Alto).
With such a wide variety to
choose from, you might sample
everything and then decide.
Three things to keep in mind:
the ice cream at Rick's is smooth,
rich and delicious, the home
made waffle cones and fold-ins at
Blatz are not to be missed, and
the Peninsula Creamery has great
ice cream plus the kind of roman
tic, '50s-throwback atmosphere
that your parents would appreci
ate. You should, too.
In this, the most health
conscious state in the Union,
traditional calorie-laden dessert
fare has to compete with a power
ful threat: frozen yogurt. For
those of you who just can't bring
yourselves to splurge on tradi
tional dessert fare, Palo Alto of
fers several good purveyors of
cooled curd. By far the easiest
place to get frozen yogurt is at the
Corner Pocket in Tresidder Un
ion. Although the Co Po's fro yo
isn't quite top notch, the many
toppings available are good,
varied and cheap.
Quality frozen yogurt can also
be found at the Yogurt Village in
the Stanford Shopping Center
and at Crouton's on University.


Daily file
This Chez Louis chef looks happy with his work as he serves up one of
the restaurant's tasty French offerings.
Where the Cardinal flocks
Stanford hangouts change from
year to year, of course, hut there
are such things as old standards.
Half the people in Kamona's
(541 Ramona St., Palo Alto) on
any given weekend night will be
from Stanford; the crush is partic
ularly intense before anu after
basketball games. Most of them
will be eating the second-best
pizza in the area, while those who
want to be different chew on
calzones or decent hamburgers.
The once-great Ramona*s salad
bar retains only a shade of its
former glory.
Down the street at the Good
Earth Restaurant (185 University
Ave., Palo Alto), you'll find a dif
ferent, slightly older Stanford
crowd eating chic health food.
The iced tea at this time of year is
particularly refreshing, and so are
the yogurt-based milkshakes.

Of course, "hangouts" in the
true Stanford sense of the word
are places you go to swill beer,
and there are a few of those, too.
The Dutch Gootc (357 Ala
meda de las Pulgas, Menlo Park),
a functional sort of place where
it's standing room only on Senior
Pub Nights, and The Oasis (241
El Camino, Menlo Park), a down
right ugly place that has been wit
ness to untold decades of Stan
ford history. One thing to know:
refer to the two establishments as
"The Goose" and"The
respectively.
The granddaddy of them all,
though, is the Alpine Inn Beer
Garden (3915 Alpine Road, Por
tola Valley), more commonly
known as "/ott's." If you can fig
ure out why it's called Zott's, then
you are very intelligent and you
deserve to be at Stanford.
Zott's serves robust rectangular
burgers, French fries so good that

even the French would be proud
to have their name attached to
them, and of course, lots of beer.
Throw in a massive outdoor
eating area, a heavy contingent of
locals to dilute the Stanford in
flux, plus a nifty jukebox that
seemingly has every Elvis Presley
hit ever, and you know why this
place is a drawing card.
One of the most popular new
hangouts is the Stanford Pub
(445 Emerson, Palo Alto). Ex
pect a lively, sometimes rowdy
crowd often affiliated with
various athletic teams.
Another newish spot is the
Vortex (260 California Ave., Palo
Alto), which used to be the
Keystone Palo Alto, but now
plays lots of new wave/dance
music and features a graffiti
splattered, mannequin-dangling
interior.
In recent years an attempt has
been made to turn The Lan
cashire Tavern (547 Emerson St.,
Palo Alto) into a Stanford hang
out of the Pub Night variety, and
this year it seems to have finally
caught on. Be sure to try the
cider.
If you'd like your nightlife a bit
rowdier, try St. James Infirmary
(390 Moffett Blvd., Mountain
View) or Antonio's Nut House
(321 California Ave., Palo Alto),
places where you can get into a
fight if you try hard enough or
look enough like a Stanford stu
dent. Antonio's remodeled
during the summer and now looks
quite spiffy inside.
Slices of life
Frankie, Johnnie & I uigi Too
(939 El Camino, Mountain View)
has no peer in pizza. What it does
have are long waits on some
weekend nights, which can fly by
if a large group of people go and
drink while waiting (it you look
21, you'll be accosted by a roving
cocktail waitress the minute you
sign in). Try the fresh tomato and
gaflic pizza, a house specialty, or

the ever-popular stromboli or
Hawaiian. Avoid the Italian din
ners, which are often dreadful.
A distant second to FJ&L is
Ramona's, which has decent New
York-style (i.e. heavy and spicy)
pizza and slightly shorter waits,
and is closer to campus.
Honorable mention goes to the
Argentine pizza with barbecue
sauce (ladled on in place of
tomato sauce) at Jose's (2275 E£l
Camino, Palo Alto), and the pizza
with almost anything on it at
Applewood Inn (1001 El Camino,
Mcnlo Park).
Mountain Mike's, at 2000 El
Camino, offers decent pizza and a
location very close to campus.
And new to the area is Pizza a (io
(io, an ultra-modern pizza-by
the-slice joint on University.
Wonders of the Orient
There is a plethora of Chinese
restaurants in the Palo Alto area.
Here are just a few:
Generations of Stanfordites
have fallen in love with the mu
shu pork at Chef Chu's (1067 N.
San Antonio Road at El Camino
Real, Los Altos). This always
crowded Mandarin restaurant
prepares perfectly solid, unexcit
ing dishes — it's the ideal place
for large groups with diverse
tastes. The food's more exciting
at China First (675 El Camino,
Palo Alto), another place with a
big reputation. The cuisine here is
Szechuan/Hunan, albeit not too
spicy, and there are great dishes
on the menu.
Also, China Lion (3345 El
Camino, Palo Alto), is a nearby
alternative with Manda
rin/Szeehuan cooking. A new fa
vorite is Jing-Jing's (443 Emer
son Rd., Palo Alto), a Szech
wan/Hunan restaurant with excel
lent hot and sour soup.
On a more modest scale, there
are three worthwhile Chinese
places in Menlo Park. The first
two, Yuen Yung (639 Santa Cruz
Ave.) and Su Hong (1039 El

Camino), are both eclectic but
primarily Cantonese/Mandarin.
Su Hong has better food, Yuen
Yung more interesting decor — it
looks like a cross between a
Chinese restaurant and a fern bar.
A personal favorite is Ten Fu
(1352 El Camino Real), which
offers Szechwan, Hunan and
Mandarin food in a casual but
classy atmosphere. The service is
excellent and both the potstickers
and the wonton soup are other
wordly. Don't miss the fried
bananas for dessert.
If you've been starving yourself
passing up some of the tasty
entrees served by Food Service,
the place to catch up on lost food
is Colonel l.ee's Mongolian Bar-B-
Q (304 Castro, Mountain View),
basically an all-you-can-eat place
serving a rib-tickling variety of
barbecued morsels including
beef, pork, lamb and turkey.
The area is graced by a bevy of
Japanese restaurants, most ser
ving sushi. One of the best is
Mivake Restaurant (261 Univer
sity), which is quaint and not too
expensive.
South of the border
Palo Alto lost its only really
good Mexican restaurant when
the Andes Mexican Restaurant, a
Whiskey Gulch anomaly, folded
several years back. Now a trip to

Menlo Park or Los Altos is re
quired.
Rosita's Taqueria (171 A sth
Ave., Redwood City) occupies a
storefront in an uninviting part of
Redwood City, but makes the
only authentic burritos-to-go in
the area. These are big sloppy
things that can't be eaten while
driving a car, and Rosita's has a
wide variety, including pork and
beef in several sauces, steak,
chicken, sausage and tongue.
Rosita's also has a good selection
of Mexican beers and soft drinks
— you haven't lived until you've
had a Boing soda.
Lstrellita (971 North San An
tonio Rd., Los Altos) isn't what it
used to be, but it still has great
chimichangas. There are two pas
sable family-style Mexican joints
in Menlo Park: La Luna Mexican
Cafe (1137 Chestnut St.) and
Caleta (1 143 D Crane St.).
The Senor Taco Drive-In (3490
El Camino Real, Palo Alto) looks
modest, but has the burritos that
made Mexico famous.
If you don't mind a drive, the
best Latin restaurant around is
probably EI Calderon (699 El
Calderon Ave., Mountain View),
which is hidden away in a small
shopping center and has a
Mexican/Salvadoran menu.
However, if you are insistent


about staying in the area, good
food and yummy margaritas can
be found at all of the following
places: Chili's (700 El Camino,
Menlo Park, or 2560 El Camino,
Mountain View), Compadres
Mexican Bar & Grill (3877 El
Camino, Palo Alto) both of which
serve great margaritas, and
Armadillo Willy's BBQ & Cafe
(1031 N. San Antonio Rd., Los
Altos) and Acapulco's (2515 El
Camino Real, Palo Alto).
Vive la France!
Without going into too much
detail, there's one local restaurant
that comes close to meeting the
bistro ideal (good food, relatively
low prices) Le Pot au Feu (1149
El Camino, Menlo Park). Some
what more formal and relatively
expensive is Chez Louis (4170 El

Camino, Palo Alto), virtually an
institution.
Fishies from the deep blue sea
The Big Two for serious
seafood in the area are Scott's
Seafood Bar & Grill (2300 E.
Bayshore Rd.) and The Fish Mar
ket (3150 El Camino). Scott's is
the posher of the two, but The
Fish Market is closer and has a
great on-the-wharf feel, even
though it's right next to
McDonald's.
Deli delights
When the sandwich urge
strikes, try Togo's (several loca
tions, including 518 University
Ave.), Manhattan West (420
Emerson, Palo Alto) or the deli
counters at Safeway (several loca
tions) or the Town and Country
Market (corner of Embarcadero
and El Camino.)
The Bedrock (2999 El
Camino), formerly the
wondrously named "Joy of

Junque," offers a good burger
and shake combination.
Spirits in the night
There are as many different
kinds of bars as there are
drinkers, and the most popular
ones — the Goose, the 'O' and
the Pub — we've already dis
cussed. We're concerned here
with the bar as a comfortable en
vironment in which to drink, as
opposed to a supportive environ
ment in which to get drunk.
The Gatehouse (265 Lytton
Ave., Palo Alto) is a snitzy res
taurant by day a snitzy bar by
night, and one of the nicest places
in which to sit around in Palo
Alto. The bar at Mama's (379
Stanford Shopping Center) is a
bit out of the way, but it has a cer
tain hushed elegance that makes
it attractive.
Henry's (482 University, Palo
Alto), is hot and crowded once
the dinner customers clear out,
but there's no one on the make;
just lots of successful young Palo

Altans enjoying their success in
one of their favorite bars.
For a taste of the exotic, take a
trip up the Bayshore to San
Mateo and visit The Lanai (4070
S. El Camino). The atmosphere
will remind you of a Gilligan's Is
land nightmare and the drinks are
expensive but huge and strong.
If you're looking for something
a bit more staid, try the bar at the
rear of the London House (630
Ramona St., Palo Alto), a loving
recreation of an English pub
where you can get most any
British beer you want, pub snacks
and a game of darts. t
Yuppie love
Style is everything in a Yuppie
hangout, and Mac Arthur Park
(27 University, Palo Alto, near
the train station) is in one of the
approved styles: big, open, white
panelled spaces, wood floor, brass
railings everywhere. The food
ranges from fair to middling —
except for the barbecued meats,
which are exceptional. Be sure to

order something from the grill,
especially the ribs.
Another style is represented by
Waverley Place (560 Waverley
St, Palo Alto), which is all glass
and bleached wood and serves ex
pensive (but surprisingly good)
pastas and seafood dishes.
Along with these younger res
taurants, a couple of established
Palo Alto restaurants have swung
with the times: The Gatehouse,
one of Palo Alto's prettiest places
to eat and drink, is taken over by

the young come dinner hour, and
Henry's is a favorite with the local
advertising/design community
that lives off Silicon Valley.
Ivet them eat coffeecake
Morning eaters are lucky here
— Palo Alto and Menlo Park
have lots of good restaurants that
specialize in breakfast and lunch.
First among equals is Late for

the Train (150 Middle-field Rd.,
Menlo Park, near the train sta
tion), a folksy place that makes
great omelettes, divine blitzes and
fruit pancakes and the usual
salads and sandwiches, plus ever
changing desserts. If you go on a
weekend, particularly a Sunday,
expect at least a 30-minute wait;
it's best, if you can, to go for an
early or late weekday lunch, when
you can often be seated immedi
ately.
Modeled along much the same
lines is Hobee's (two locations in
Palo Alto: 4224 El Camino and
Town and Country Village, across
from the Stadium), a family oper
ation with more branches around
the peninsula. Hobee's follows
more traditional American
breakfast lines — sausage, eggs,
ham — but isn't lacking for fresh
squeezed juices, fruit and other
California trimmings, and it has a
truly addicting coffeecake that
comes with most of the break
fasts. Both Hobee's and Late for
the Train provide free coffee for
waiting crowds.
The Farmer's Market (448
California Ave., Palo Alto) has a
small menu, spotty service (semi
cafeteria style) and the ambiance
of a butcher shop, but it serves

great breakfasts (try the apple
pancakes or a ham/swiss/apple
omelette) at relatively low prices.
Finally, there's the favorite
morning meeting spot of Stanford
sororities — Dinah's Poolside
Coffee Shop (4269 El Camino,
Palo Alto.
In the midnight hour
There used to be a wealth of
places where you could go at 2
a.m. — or 4 or 6 a.m. — with the
gang and be obnoxious, or with a
loved one to fortify yourself in an
emotional crisis, or by yourself to
studv and mainline some caffeine.
Then Stickney's cut back to
midnight and became a trendy
tourist/alumni hangout, and Luv's
went to 24 hours on weekends
only and eventually became a
singles pickup joint. In the old
days, going to Denny's or Lyons
didn't even cross your mind; now
they're all that's left.
Closer (by about 100 yards)
and friendlier is Denny's (426 El
Camino, Palo Alto). Denny's is
also cheaper than Lyons, has food
that's at least as good or better
and tackier vinyl.
So why go to Lyons (4298 El
Camino, Los Altos) at all? Be
cause sometimes you need a
change. Lyons is darker, the
waitresses are younger. And if
you're determined to eat a lot of
food at 4 a.m. and get really sick,

there's nothing like a Mighty Lion
Burger. The patty melt is also
pretty good, and the pancakes are
decent.
The only competition left for
these corporate monsters is the
University Creamery (209 Uni
versity, Palo Alto), which sensed
the vacuum and went to 24-hour
service about two years ago. The
Creamery has pretty mediocre
greasy-spoon food, but the
milkshakes are big and good
(they use Bud's ice cream) and
it's a lot closer to campus —
within biking range, even. Plus
you can call your friends and
loved ones on the phones
supplied to some of the booths!
I scream for you
Everyone loves ice cream, to be
sure, but no one can deny that the
Stanford area is practically
drowning in the stuff.
Within a quick drive of campus
are a Haagen-Dazs (Stanford
Barn, 700 Welch Rd.), two
Swenson's (440 University Ave.,
Palo Alto and 1350 El Camino,
Menlo Park), Blatz Folded Ice
Cream (101 California Ave., Palo
Alto), Double Rainbow (1083 El
Camino, Menlo Park), Rick's
Rather Rich Ice Cream
(Charleston at Middlefield, Palo
Alto) and the Peninsula
Creamery (corner of Hamilton
and Emerson, Palo Alto) and the

University Creamery.
Then there is an array of Italian
ice cream shops, including Gelato
Alota (2953 So. El Camino,*San
Mateo) and Gelato Classico (437
Emerson St., Palo Alto).
With such a wide variety to
choose from, you might sample
everything and then decide.
Three things to keep in mind:
the ice cream at Rick's is smooth,
rich and delicious, the home
made waffle cones and fold-ins at
Blatz are not to be missed, and
the Peninsula Creamery has great
ice cream plus the kind of roman
tic, '50s-throwback atmosphere
that your parents would appreci
ate. You should, too.
In this, the most health
conscious state in the Union,
traditional calorie-laden dessert
fare has to compete with a power
ful threat: frozen yogurt. For
those of you who just can't bring
yourselves to splurge on tradi
tional dessert fare, Palo Alto of
fers several good purveyors of
cooled curd. By far the easiest
place to get frozen yogurt is at the
Corner Pocket in Tresidder Un
ion. Although the Co Po's fro yo
isn't quite top notch, the many
toppings available are good,
varied and cheap.
Quality frozen yogurt can also
be found at the Yogurt Village in
the Stanford Shopping Center
and at Crouton's on University.

vorite is Jing-Jing's (443 Emer

On a more modest scale, there

places in Menlo Park. The first

Palo Alto lost its only really

several years back. Now a trip to

Menlo Park or Los Altos is re

Rosita's Taqueria (171 A sth

driving a car, and Rosita's has a
wide variety, including pork and
beef in several sauces, steak,
chicken, sausage and tongue.
Rosita's also has a good selection
of Mexican beers and soft drinks
— you haven't lived until you've
had a Boing soda.
Lstrellita (971 North San An
tonio Rd., Los Altos) isn't what it
used to be, but it still has great
chimichangas. There are two pas
sable family-style Mexican joints
in Menlo Park: La Luna Mexican
Cafe (1137 Chestnut St.) and
Caleta (1 143 D Crane St.).
The Senor Taco Drive-In (3490
El Camino Real, Palo Alto) looks
modest, but has the burritos that
made Mexico famous.
If you don't mind a drive, the
best Latin restaurant around is
probably EI Calderon (699 El
Calderon Ave., Mountain View),
which is hidden away in a small
shopping center and has a
Mexican/Salvadoran menu.
However, if you are insistent


about staying in the area, good
food and yummy margaritas can
be found at all of the following
places: Chili's (700 El Camino,
Menlo Park, or 2560 El Camino,
Mountain View), Compadres
Mexican Bar & Grill (3877 El
Camino, Palo Alto) both of which
serve great margaritas, and
Armadillo Willy's BBQ & Cafe
(1031 N. San Antonio Rd., Los
Altos) and Acapulco's (2515 El
Camino Real, Palo Alto).
Vive la France!
Without going into too much
detail, there's one local restaurant
that comes close to meeting the
bistro ideal (good food, relatively
low prices) Le Pot au Feu (1149
El Camino, Menlo Park). Some
what more formal and relatively
expensive is Chez Louis (4170 El

Camino, Palo Alto), virtually an
institution.
Fishies from the deep blue sea
The Big Two for serious
seafood in the area are Scott's
Seafood Bar & Grill (2300 E.
Bayshore Rd.) and The Fish Mar
ket (3150 El Camino). Scott's is
the posher of the two, but The
Fish Market is closer and has a
great on-the-wharf feel, even
though it's right next to
McDonald's.
Deli delights
When the sandwich urge
strikes, try Togo's (several loca
tions, including 518 University
Ave.), Manhattan West (420
Emerson, Palo Alto) or the deli
counters at Safeway (several loca
tions) or the Town and Country
Market (corner of Embarcadero
and El Camino.)
The Bedrock (2999 El
Camino), formerly the
wondrously named "Joy of

Junque," offers a good burger
and shake combination.
Spirits in the night
There are as many different
kinds of bars as there are
drinkers, and the most popular
ones — the Goose, the 'O' and
the Pub — we've already dis
cussed. We're concerned here
with the bar as a comfortable en
vironment in which to drink, as
opposed to a supportive environ
ment in which to get drunk.
The Gatehouse (265 Lytton
Ave., Palo Alto) is a snitzy res
taurant by day a snitzy bar by
night, and one of the nicest places
in which to sit around in Palo
Alto. The bar at Mama's (379
Stanford Shopping Center) is a
bit out of the way, but it has a cer
tain hushed elegance that makes
it attractive.
Henry's (482 University, Palo
Alto), is hot and crowded once
the dinner customers clear out,
but there's no one on the make;
just lots of successful young Palo

Altans enjoying their success in
one of their favorite bars.
For a taste of the exotic, take a
trip up the Bayshore to San
Mateo and visit The Lanai (4070
S. El Camino). The atmosphere
will remind you of a Gilligan's Is
land nightmare and the drinks are
expensive but huge and strong.
If you're looking for something
a bit more staid, try the bar at the
rear of the London House (630
Ramona St., Palo Alto), a loving
recreation of an English pub
where you can get most any
British beer you want, pub snacks
and a game of darts. t
Yuppie love
Style is everything in a Yuppie
hangout, and Mac Arthur Park
(27 University, Palo Alto, near
the train station) is in one of the
approved styles: big, open, white
panelled spaces, wood floor, brass
railings everywhere. The food
ranges from fair to middling —
except for the barbecued meats,
which are exceptional. Be sure to

order something from the grill,
especially the ribs.
Another style is represented by
Waverley Place (560 Waverley
St, Palo Alto), which is all glass
and bleached wood and serves ex
pensive (but surprisingly good)
pastas and seafood dishes.
Along with these younger res
taurants, a couple of established
Palo Alto restaurants have swung
with the times: The Gatehouse,
one of Palo Alto's prettiest places
to eat and drink, is taken over by

the young come dinner hour, and
Henry's is a favorite with the local
advertising/design community
that lives off Silicon Valley.
Ivet them eat coffeecake
Morning eaters are lucky here
— Palo Alto and Menlo Park
have lots of good restaurants that
specialize in breakfast and lunch.
First among equals is Late for

the Train (150 Middle-field Rd.,
Menlo Park, near the train sta
tion), a folksy place that makes
great omelettes, divine blitzes and
fruit pancakes and the usual
salads and sandwiches, plus ever
changing desserts. If you go on a
weekend, particularly a Sunday,
expect at least a 30-minute wait;
it's best, if you can, to go for an
early or late weekday lunch, when
you can often be seated immedi
ately.
Modeled along much the same
lines is Hobee's (two locations in
Palo Alto: 4224 El Camino and
Town and Country Village, across
from the Stadium), a family oper
ation with more branches around
the peninsula. Hobee's follows
more traditional American
breakfast lines — sausage, eggs,
ham — but isn't lacking for fresh
squeezed juices, fruit and other
California trimmings, and it has a
truly addicting coffeecake that
comes with most of the break
fasts. Both Hobee's and Late for
the Train provide free coffee for
waiting crowds.
The Farmer's Market (448
California Ave., Palo Alto) has a
small menu, spotty service (semi
cafeteria style) and the ambiance
of a butcher shop, but it serves

great breakfasts (try the apple
pancakes or a ham/swiss/apple
omelette) at relatively low prices.
Finally, there's the favorite
morning meeting spot of Stanford
sororities — Dinah's Poolside
Coffee Shop (4269 El Camino,
Palo Alto.
In the midnight hour
There used to be a wealth of
places where you could go at 2
a.m. — or 4 or 6 a.m. — with the
gang and be obnoxious, or with a
loved one to fortify yourself in an
emotional crisis, or by yourself to
studv and mainline some caffeine.
Then Stickney's cut back to
midnight and became a trendy
tourist/alumni hangout, and Luv's
went to 24 hours on weekends
only and eventually became a
singles pickup joint. In the old
days, going to Denny's or Lyons
didn't even cross your mind; now
they're all that's left.
Closer (by about 100 yards)
and friendlier is Denny's (426 El
Camino, Palo Alto). Denny's is
also cheaper than Lyons, has food
that's at least as good or better
and tackier vinyl.
So why go to Lyons (4298 El
Camino, Los Altos) at all? Be
cause sometimes you need a
change. Lyons is darker, the
waitresses are younger. And if
you're determined to eat a lot of
food at 4 a.m. and get really sick,

there's nothing like a Mighty Lion
Burger. The patty melt is also
pretty good, and the pancakes are
decent.
The only competition left for
these corporate monsters is the
University Creamery (209 Uni
versity, Palo Alto), which sensed
the vacuum and went to 24-hour
service about two years ago. The
Creamery has pretty mediocre
greasy-spoon food, but the
milkshakes are big and good
(they use Bud's ice cream) and
it's a lot closer to campus —
within biking range, even. Plus
you can call your friends and
loved ones on the phones
supplied to some of the booths!
I scream for you
Everyone loves ice cream, to be
sure, but no one can deny that the
Stanford area is practically
drowning in the stuff.
Within a quick drive of campus
are a Haagen-Dazs (Stanford
Barn, 700 Welch Rd.), two
Swenson's (440 University Ave.,
Palo Alto and 1350 El Camino,
Menlo Park), Blatz Folded Ice
Cream (101 California Ave., Palo
Alto), Double Rainbow (1083 El
Camino, Menlo Park), Rick's
Rather Rich Ice Cream
(Charleston at Middlefield, Palo
Alto) and the Peninsula
Creamery (corner of Hamilton
and Emerson, Palo Alto) and the

University Creamery.
Then there is an array of Italian
ice cream shops, including Gelato
Alota (2953 So. El Camino,*San
Mateo) and Gelato Classico (437
Emerson St., Palo Alto).
With such a wide variety to
choose from, you might sample
everything and then decide.
Three things to keep in mind:
the ice cream at Rick's is smooth,
rich and delicious, the home
made waffle cones and fold-ins at
Blatz are not to be missed, and
the Peninsula Creamery has great
ice cream plus the kind of roman
tic, '50s-throwback atmosphere
that your parents would appreci
ate. You should, too.
In this, the most health
conscious state in the Union,
traditional calorie-laden dessert
fare has to compete with a power
ful threat: frozen yogurt. For
those of you who just can't bring
yourselves to splurge on tradi
tional dessert fare, Palo Alto of
fers several good purveyors of
cooled curd. By far the easiest
place to get frozen yogurt is at the
Corner Pocket in Tresidder Un
ion. Although the Co Po's fro yo
isn't quite top notch, the many
toppings available are good,
varied and cheap.
Quality frozen yogurt can also
be found at the Yogurt Village in
the Stanford Shopping Center
and at Crouton's on University.


Daily file
This Chez Louis chef looks happy with his work as he serves up one of
the restaurant's tasty French offerings.
Where the Cardinal flocks
Stanford hangouts change from
year to year, of course, hut there
are such things as old standards.
Half the people in Kamona's
(541 Ramona St., Palo Alto) on
any given weekend night will be
from Stanford; the crush is partic
ularly intense before anu after
basketball games. Most of them
will be eating the second-best
pizza in the area, while those who
want to be different chew on
calzones or decent hamburgers.
The once-great Ramona*s salad
bar retains only a shade of its
former glory.
Down the street at the Good
Earth Restaurant (185 University
Ave., Palo Alto), you'll find a dif
ferent, slightly older Stanford
crowd eating chic health food.
The iced tea at this time of year is
particularly refreshing, and so are
the yogurt-based milkshakes.

Of course, "hangouts" in the
true Stanford sense of the word
are places you go to swill beer,
and there are a few of those, too.
The Dutch Gootc (357 Ala
meda de las Pulgas, Menlo Park),
a functional sort of place where
it's standing room only on Senior
Pub Nights, and The Oasis (241
El Camino, Menlo Park), a down
right ugly place that has been wit
ness to untold decades of Stan
ford history. One thing to know:
refer to the two establishments as
"The Goose" and"The
respectively.
The granddaddy of them all,
though, is the Alpine Inn Beer
Garden (3915 Alpine Road, Por
tola Valley), more commonly
known as "/ott's." If you can fig
ure out why it's called Zott's, then
you are very intelligent and you
deserve to be at Stanford.
Zott's serves robust rectangular
burgers, French fries so good that

even the French would be proud
to have their name attached to
them, and of course, lots of beer.
Throw in a massive outdoor
eating area, a heavy contingent of
locals to dilute the Stanford in
flux, plus a nifty jukebox that
seemingly has every Elvis Presley
hit ever, and you know why this
place is a drawing card.
One of the most popular new
hangouts is the Stanford Pub
(445 Emerson, Palo Alto). Ex
pect a lively, sometimes rowdy
crowd often affiliated with
various athletic teams.
Another newish spot is the
Vortex (260 California Ave., Palo
Alto), which used to be the
Keystone Palo Alto, but now
plays lots of new wave/dance
music and features a graffiti
splattered, mannequin-dangling
interior.
In recent years an attempt has
been made to turn The Lan
cashire Tavern (547 Emerson St.,
Palo Alto) into a Stanford hang
out of the Pub Night variety, and
this year it seems to have finally
caught on. Be sure to try the
cider.
If you'd like your nightlife a bit
rowdier, try St. James Infirmary
(390 Moffett Blvd., Mountain
View) or Antonio's Nut House
(321 California Ave., Palo Alto),
places where you can get into a
fight if you try hard enough or
look enough like a Stanford stu
dent. Antonio's remodeled
during the summer and now looks
quite spiffy inside.
Slices of life
Frankie, Johnnie & I uigi Too
(939 El Camino, Mountain View)
has no peer in pizza. What it does
have are long waits on some
weekend nights, which can fly by
if a large group of people go and
drink while waiting (it you look
21, you'll be accosted by a roving
cocktail waitress the minute you
sign in). Try the fresh tomato and
gaflic pizza, a house specialty, or

the ever-popular stromboli or
Hawaiian. Avoid the Italian din
ners, which are often dreadful.
A distant second to FJ&L is
Ramona's, which has decent New
York-style (i.e. heavy and spicy)
pizza and slightly shorter waits,
and is closer to campus.
Honorable mention goes to the
Argentine pizza with barbecue
sauce (ladled on in place of
tomato sauce) at Jose's (2275 E£l
Camino, Palo Alto), and the pizza
with almost anything on it at
Applewood Inn (1001 El Camino,
Mcnlo Park).
Mountain Mike's, at 2000 El
Camino, offers decent pizza and a
location very close to campus.
And new to the area is Pizza a (io
(io, an ultra-modern pizza-by
the-slice joint on University.
Wonders of the Orient
There is a plethora of Chinese
restaurants in the Palo Alto area.
Here are just a few:
Generations of Stanfordites
have fallen in love with the mu
shu pork at Chef Chu's (1067 N.
San Antonio Road at El Camino
Real, Los Altos). This always
crowded Mandarin restaurant
prepares perfectly solid, unexcit
ing dishes — it's the ideal place
for large groups with diverse
tastes. The food's more exciting
at China First (675 El Camino,
Palo Alto), another place with a
big reputation. The cuisine here is
Szechuan/Hunan, albeit not too
spicy, and there are great dishes
on the menu.
Also, China Lion (3345 El
Camino, Palo Alto), is a nearby
alternative with Manda
rin/Szeehuan cooking. A new fa
vorite is Jing-Jing's (443 Emer
son Rd., Palo Alto), a Szech
wan/Hunan restaurant with excel
lent hot and sour soup.
On a more modest scale, there
are three worthwhile Chinese
places in Menlo Park. The first
two, Yuen Yung (639 Santa Cruz
Ave.) and Su Hong (1039 El

Camino), are both eclectic but
primarily Cantonese/Mandarin.
Su Hong has better food, Yuen
Yung more interesting decor — it
looks like a cross between a
Chinese restaurant and a fern bar.
A personal favorite is Ten Fu
(1352 El Camino Real), which
offers Szechwan, Hunan and
Mandarin food in a casual but
classy atmosphere. The service is
excellent and both the potstickers
and the wonton soup are other
wordly. Don't miss the fried
bananas for dessert.
If you've been starving yourself
passing up some of the tasty
entrees served by Food Service,
the place to catch up on lost food
is Colonel l.ee's Mongolian Bar-B-
Q (304 Castro, Mountain View),
basically an all-you-can-eat place
serving a rib-tickling variety of
barbecued morsels including
beef, pork, lamb and turkey.
The area is graced by a bevy of
Japanese restaurants, most ser
ving sushi. One of the best is
Mivake Restaurant (261 Univer
sity), which is quaint and not too
expensive.
South of the border
Palo Alto lost its only really
good Mexican restaurant when
the Andes Mexican Restaurant, a
Whiskey Gulch anomaly, folded
several years back. Now a trip to

Menlo Park or Los Altos is re
quired.
Rosita's Taqueria (171 A sth
Ave., Redwood City) occupies a
storefront in an uninviting part of
Redwood City, but makes the
only authentic burritos-to-go in
the area. These are big sloppy
things that can't be eaten while
driving a car, and Rosita's has a
wide variety, including pork and
beef in several sauces, steak,
chicken, sausage and tongue.
Rosita's also has a good selection
of Mexican beers and soft drinks
— you haven't lived until you've
had a Boing soda.
Lstrellita (971 North San An
tonio Rd., Los Altos) isn't what it
used to be, but it still has great
chimichangas. There are two pas
sable family-style Mexican joints
in Menlo Park: La Luna Mexican
Cafe (1137 Chestnut St.) and
Caleta (1 143 D Crane St.).
The Senor Taco Drive-In (3490
El Camino Real, Palo Alto) looks
modest, but has the burritos that
made Mexico famous.
If you don't mind a drive, the
best Latin restaurant around is
probably EI Calderon (699 El
Calderon Ave., Mountain View),
which is hidden away in a small
shopping center and has a
Mexican/Salvadoran menu.
However, if you are insistent


about staying in the area, good
food and yummy margaritas can
be found at all of the following
places: Chili's (700 El Camino,
Menlo Park, or 2560 El Camino,
Mountain View), Compadres
Mexican Bar & Grill (3877 El
Camino, Palo Alto) both of which
serve great margaritas, and
Armadillo Willy's BBQ & Cafe
(1031 N. San Antonio Rd., Los
Altos) and Acapulco's (2515 El
Camino Real, Palo Alto).
Vive la France!
Without going into too much
detail, there's one local restaurant
that comes close to meeting the
bistro ideal (good food, relatively
low prices) Le Pot au Feu (1149
El Camino, Menlo Park). Some
what more formal and relatively
expensive is Chez Louis (4170 El

Camino, Palo Alto), virtually an
institution.
Fishies from the deep blue sea
The Big Two for serious
seafood in the area are Scott's
Seafood Bar & Grill (2300 E.
Bayshore Rd.) and The Fish Mar
ket (3150 El Camino). Scott's is
the posher of the two, but The
Fish Market is closer and has a
great on-the-wharf feel, even
though it's right next to
McDonald's.
Deli delights
When the sandwich urge
strikes, try Togo's (several loca
tions, including 518 University
Ave.), Manhattan West (420
Emerson, Palo Alto) or the deli
counters at Safeway (several loca
tions) or the Town and Country
Market (corner of Embarcadero
and El Camino.)
The Bedrock (2999 El
Camino), formerly the
wondrously named "Joy of

Junque," offers a good burger
and shake combination.
Spirits in the night
There are as many different
kinds of bars as there are
drinkers, and the most popular
ones — the Goose, the 'O' and
the Pub — we've already dis
cussed. We're concerned here
with the bar as a comfortable en

The Gatehouse (265 Lytton

taurant by day a snitzy bar by
night, and one of the nicest places
in which to sit around in Palo
Alto. The bar at Mama's (379
Stanford Shopping Center) is a
bit out of the way, but it has a cer
tain hushed elegance that makes
it attractive.
Henry's (482 University, Palo
Alto), is hot and crowded once
the dinner customers clear out,
but there's no one on the make;
just lots of successful young Palo

Altans enjoying their success in
one of their favorite bars.
For a taste of the exotic, take a
trip up the Bayshore to San
Mateo and visit The Lanai (4070
S. El Camino). The atmosphere
will remind you of a Gilligan's Is
land nightmare and the drinks are
expensive but huge and strong.
If you're looking for something

rear of the London House (630
Ramona St., Palo Alto), a loving
recreation of an English pub
where you can get most any
British beer you want, pub snacks
and a game of darts. t
Yuppie love
Style is everything in a Yuppie
hangout, and Mac Arthur Park
(27 University, Palo Alto, near
the train station) is in one of the
approved styles: big, open, white
panelled spaces, wood floor, brass
railings everywhere. The food
ranges from fair to middling —
except for the barbecued meats,
which are exceptional. Be sure to

order something from the grill,
especially the ribs.
Another style is represented by
Waverley Place (560 Waverley
St, Palo Alto), which is all glass
and bleached wood and serves ex
pensive (but surprisingly good)
pastas and seafood dishes.
Along with these younger res
taurants, a couple of established
Palo Alto restaurants have swung
with the times: The Gatehouse,
one of Palo Alto's prettiest places
to eat and drink, is taken over by

the young come dinner hour, and
Henry's is a favorite with the local
advertising/design community
that lives off Silicon Valley.
Ivet them eat coffeecake
Morning eaters are lucky here
— Palo Alto and Menlo Park
have lots of good restaurants that
specialize in breakfast and lunch.
First among equals is Late for

the Train (150 Middle-field Rd.,
Menlo Park, near the train sta
tion), a folksy place that makes
great omelettes, divine blitzes and
fruit pancakes and the usual
salads and sandwiches, plus ever
changing desserts. If you go on a
weekend, particularly a Sunday,
expect at least a 30-minute wait;
it's best, if you can, to go for an
early or late weekday lunch, when
you can often be seated immedi
ately.
Modeled along much the same
lines is Hobee's (two locations in
Palo Alto: 4224 El Camino and
Town and Country Village, across
from the Stadium), a family oper
ation with more branches around
the peninsula. Hobee's follows
more traditional American
breakfast lines — sausage, eggs,
ham — but isn't lacking for fresh
squeezed juices, fruit and other
California trimmings, and it has a
truly addicting coffeecake that
comes with most of the break
fasts. Both Hobee's and Late for
the Train provide free coffee for
waiting crowds.
The Farmer's Market (448
California Ave., Palo Alto) has a
small menu, spotty service (semi
cafeteria style) and the ambiance
of a butcher shop, but it serves

great breakfasts (try the apple
pancakes or a ham/swiss/apple
omelette) at relatively low prices.
Finally, there's the favorite
morning meeting spot of Stanford
sororities — Dinah's Poolside
Coffee Shop (4269 El Camino,
Palo Alto.
In the midnight hour
There used to be a wealth of
places where you could go at 2
a.m. — or 4 or 6 a.m. — with the
gang and be obnoxious, or with a
loved one to fortify yourself in an
emotional crisis, or by yourself to
studv and mainline some caffeine.
Then Stickney's cut back to
midnight and became a trendy
tourist/alumni hangout, and Luv's
went to 24 hours on weekends
only and eventually became a
singles pickup joint. In the old
days, going to Denny's or Lyons
didn't even cross your mind; now
they're all that's left.
Closer (by about 100 yards)
and friendlier is Denny's (426 El
Camino, Palo Alto). Denny's is
also cheaper than Lyons, has food
that's at least as good or better
and tackier vinyl.
So why go to Lyons (4298 El
Camino, Los Altos) at all? Be
cause sometimes you need a
change. Lyons is darker, the
waitresses are younger. And if
you're determined to eat a lot of
food at 4 a.m. and get really sick,

there's nothing like a Mighty Lion
Burger. The patty melt is also
pretty good, and the pancakes are
decent.
The only competition left for
these corporate monsters is the
University Creamery (209 Uni

greasy-spoon food, but the
milkshakes are big and good

I scream for you
Everyone loves ice cream, to be
sure, but no one can deny that the
Stanford area is practically
drowning in the stuff.
Within a quick drive of campus
are a Haagen-Dazs (Stanford
Barn, 700 Welch Rd.), two
Swenson's (440 University Ave.,
Palo Alto and 1350 El Camino,
Menlo Park), Blatz Folded Ice
Cream (101 California Ave., Palo
Alto), Double Rainbow (1083 El
Camino, Menlo Park), Rick's
Rather Rich Ice Cream
(Charleston at Middlefield, Palo
Alto) and the Peninsula
Creamery (corner of Hamilton
and Emerson, Palo Alto) and the

University Creamery.
Then there is an array of Italian
ice cream shops, including Gelato
Alota (2953 So. El Camino,*San
Mateo) and Gelato Classico (437
Emerson St., Palo Alto).
With such a wide variety to
choose from, you might sample
everything and then decide.
Three things to keep in mind:
the ice cream at Rick's is smooth,
rich and delicious, the home
made waffle cones and fold-ins at
Blatz are not to be missed, and
the Peninsula Creamery has great
ice cream plus the kind of roman
tic, '50s-throwback atmosphere
that your parents would appreci
ate. You should, too.
In this, the most health
conscious state in the Union,
traditional calorie-laden dessert
fare has to compete with a power
ful threat: frozen yogurt. For
those of you who just can't bring
yourselves to splurge on tradi

place to get frozen yogurt is at the
Corner Pocket in Tresidder Un

isn't quite top notch, the many
toppings available are good,
varied and cheap.
Quality frozen yogurt can also
be found at the Yogurt Village in
the Stanford Shopping Center
and at Crouton's on University.

burgers, French fries so good that

even the French would be proud
to have their name attached to
them, and of course, lots of beer.
Throw in a massive outdoor
eating area, a heavy contingent of
locals to dilute the Stanford in
flux, plus a nifty jukebox that
seemingly has every Elvis Presley
hit ever, and you know why this
place is a drawing card.
One of the most popular new
hangouts is the Stanford Pub
(445 Emerson, Palo Alto). Ex
pect a lively, sometimes rowdy
crowd often affiliated with
various athletic teams.
Another newish spot is the
Vortex (260 California Ave., Palo
Alto), which used to be the
Keystone Palo Alto, but now
plays lots of new wave/dance
music and features a graffiti
splattered, mannequin-dangling
interior.
In recent years an attempt has
been made to turn The Lan
cashire Tavern (547 Emerson St.,
Palo Alto) into a Stanford hang
out of the Pub Night variety, and
this year it seems to have finally
caught on. Be sure to try the
cider.
If you'd like your nightlife a bit
rowdier, try St. James Infirmary
(390 Moffett Blvd., Mountain
View) or Antonio's Nut House
(321 California Ave., Palo Alto),
places where you can get into a
fight if you try hard enough or
look enough like a Stanford stu
dent. Antonio's remodeled
during the summer and now looks
quite spiffy inside.
Slices of life
Frankie, Johnnie & I uigi Too
(939 El Camino, Mountain View)
has no peer in pizza. What it does
have are long waits on some
weekend nights, which can fly by
if a large group of people go and
drink while waiting (it you look
21, you'll be accosted by a roving
cocktail waitress the minute you
sign in). Try the fresh tomato and
gaflic pizza, a house specialty, or

the ever-popular stromboli or
Hawaiian. Avoid the Italian din
ners, which are often dreadful.
A distant second to FJ&L is
Ramona's, which has decent New
York-style (i.e. heavy and spicy)
pizza and slightly shorter waits,
and is closer to campus.
Honorable mention goes to the
Argentine pizza with barbecue
sauce (ladled on in place of
tomato sauce) at Jose's (2275 E£l
Camino, Palo Alto), and the pizza
with almost anything on it at
Applewood Inn (1001 El Camino,
Mcnlo Park).
Mountain Mike's, at 2000 El
Camino, offers decent pizza and a
location very close to campus.
And new to the area is Pizza a (io
(io, an ultra-modern pizza-by
the-slice joint on University.
Wonders of the Orient
There is a plethora of Chinese
restaurants in the Palo Alto area.
Here are just a few:
Generations of Stanfordites
have fallen in love with the mu
shu pork at Chef Chu's (1067 N.
San Antonio Road at El Camino
Real, Los Altos). This always
crowded Mandarin restaurant
prepares perfectly solid, unexcit
ing dishes — it's the ideal place
for large groups with diverse
tastes. The food's more exciting
at China First (675 El Camino,
Palo Alto), another place with a
big reputation. The cuisine here is
Szechuan/Hunan, albeit not too
spicy, and there are great dishes
on the menu.
Also, China Lion (3345 El
Camino, Palo Alto), is a nearby
alternative with Manda
rin/Szeehuan cooking. A new fa
vorite is Jing-Jing's (443 Emer
son Rd., Palo Alto), a Szech
wan/Hunan restaurant with excel
lent hot and sour soup.
On a more modest scale, there
are three worthwhile Chinese
places in Menlo Park. The first
two, Yuen Yung (639 Santa Cruz
Ave.) and Su Hong (1039 El

Camino), are both eclectic but
primarily Cantonese/Mandarin.
Su Hong has better food, Yuen
Yung more interesting decor — it
looks like a cross between a
Chinese restaurant and a fern bar.
A personal favorite is Ten Fu
(1352 El Camino Real), which
offers Szechwan, Hunan and
Mandarin food in a casual but
classy atmosphere. The service is
excellent and both the potstickers
and the wonton soup are other
wordly. Don't miss the fried
bananas for dessert.
If you've been starving yourself
passing up some of the tasty
entrees served by Food Service,
the place to catch up on lost food
is Colonel l.ee's Mongolian Bar-B-
Q (304 Castro, Mountain View),
basically an all-you-can-eat place
serving a rib-tickling variety of
barbecued morsels including
beef, pork, lamb and turkey.
The area is graced by a bevy of
Japanese restaurants, most ser
ving sushi. One of the best is
Mivake Restaurant (261 Univer
sity), which is quaint and not too
expensive.
South of the border
Palo Alto lost its only really
good Mexican restaurant when
the Andes Mexican Restaurant, a
Whiskey Gulch anomaly, folded
several years back. Now a trip to

Menlo Park or Los Altos is re
quired.
Rosita's Taqueria (171 A sth
Ave., Redwood City) occupies a
storefront in an uninviting part of
Redwood City, but makes the
only authentic burritos-to-go in
the area. These are big sloppy
things that can't be eaten while
driving a car, and Rosita's has a
wide variety, including pork and
beef in several sauces, steak,
chicken, sausage and tongue.
Rosita's also has a good selection
of Mexican beers and soft drinks
— you haven't lived until you've
had a Boing soda.
Lstrellita (971 North San An
tonio Rd., Los Altos) isn't what it
used to be, but it still has great
chimichangas. There are two pas
sable family-style Mexican joints
in Menlo Park: La Luna Mexican
Cafe (1137 Chestnut St.) and
Caleta (1 143 D Crane St.).
The Senor Taco Drive-In (3490
El Camino Real, Palo Alto) looks
modest, but has the burritos that
made Mexico famous.
If you don't mind a drive, the
best Latin restaurant around is
probably EI Calderon (699 El
Calderon Ave., Mountain View),
which is hidden away in a small
shopping center and has a
Mexican/Salvadoran menu.
However, if you are insistent


about staying in the area, good
food and yummy margaritas can
be found at all of the following
places: Chili's (700 El Camino,
Menlo Park, or 2560 El Camino,
Mountain View), Compadres
Mexican Bar & Grill (3877 El
Camino, Palo Alto) both of which
serve great margaritas, and
Armadillo Willy's BBQ & Cafe
(1031 N. San Antonio Rd., Los
Altos) and Acapulco's (2515 El
Camino Real, Palo Alto).
Vive la France!
Without going into too much
detail, there's one local restaurant
that comes close to meeting the
bistro ideal (good food, relatively
low prices) Le Pot au Feu (1149
El Camino, Menlo Park). Some
what more formal and relatively
expensive is Chez Louis (4170 El

Camino, Palo Alto), virtually an
institution.
Fishies from the deep blue sea
The Big Two for serious
seafood in the area are Scott's
Seafood Bar & Grill (2300 E.
Bayshore Rd.) and The Fish Mar
ket (3150 El Camino). Scott's is
the posher of the two, but The
Fish Market is closer and has a
great on-the-wharf feel, even
though it's right next to
McDonald's.
Deli delights
When the sandwich urge
strikes, try Togo's (several loca
tions, including 518 University
Ave.), Manhattan West (420
Emerson, Palo Alto) or the deli
counters at Safeway (several loca
tions) or the Town and Country
Market (corner of Embarcadero
and El Camino.)
The Bedrock (2999 El
Camino), formerly the
wondrously named "Joy of

Junque," offers a good burger
and shake combination.
Spirits in the night
There are as many different
kinds of bars as there are
drinkers, and the most popular
ones — the Goose, the 'O' and
the Pub — we've already dis
cussed. We're concerned here
with the bar as a comfortable en
vironment in which to drink, as
opposed to a supportive environ
ment in which to get drunk.
The Gatehouse (265 Lytton
Ave., Palo Alto) is a snitzy res
taurant by day a snitzy bar by
night, and one of the nicest places
in which to sit around in Palo
Alto. The bar at Mama's (379
Stanford Shopping Center) is a
bit out of the way, but it has a cer
tain hushed elegance that makes
it attractive.
Henry's (482 University, Palo
Alto), is hot and crowded once
the dinner customers clear out,
but there's no one on the make;
just lots of successful young Palo

Altans enjoying their success in
one of their favorite bars.
For a taste of the exotic, take a
trip up the Bayshore to San
Mateo and visit The Lanai (4070
S. El Camino). The atmosphere
will remind you of a Gilligan's Is
land nightmare and the drinks are
expensive but huge and strong.
If you're looking for something
a bit more staid, try the bar at the
rear of the London House (630
Ramona St., Palo Alto), a loving
recreation of an English pub
where you can get most any
British beer you want, pub snacks
and a game of darts. t
Yuppie love
Style is everything in a Yuppie
hangout, and Mac Arthur Park
(27 University, Palo Alto, near
the train station) is in one of the
approved styles: big, open, white
panelled spaces, wood floor, brass
railings everywhere. The food
ranges from fair to middling —
except for the barbecued meats,
which are exceptional. Be sure to

order something from the grill,
especially the ribs.
Another style is represented by
Waverley Place (560 Waverley
St, Palo Alto), which is all glass
and bleached wood and serves ex
pensive (but surprisingly good)
pastas and seafood dishes.
Along with these younger res
taurants, a couple of established
Palo Alto restaurants have swung
with the times: The Gatehouse,
one of Palo Alto's prettiest places
to eat and drink, is taken over by

the young come dinner hour, and
Henry's is a favorite with the local
advertising/design community
that lives off Silicon Valley.
Ivet them eat coffeecake
Morning eaters are lucky here
— Palo Alto and Menlo Park
have lots of good restaurants that
specialize in breakfast and lunch.
First among equals is Late for

the Train (150 Middle-field Rd.,
Menlo Park, near the train sta
tion), a folksy place that makes
great omelettes, divine blitzes and
fruit pancakes and the usual
salads and sandwiches, plus ever
changing desserts. If you go on a
weekend, particularly a Sunday,
expect at least a 30-minute wait;
it's best, if you can, to go for an
early or late weekday lunch, when
you can often be seated immedi
ately.
Modeled along much the same
lines is Hobee's (two locations in
Palo Alto: 4224 El Camino and
Town and Country Village, across
from the Stadium), a family oper
ation with more branches around
the peninsula. Hobee's follows
more traditional American
breakfast lines — sausage, eggs,
ham — but isn't lacking for fresh
squeezed juices, fruit and other
California trimmings, and it has a
truly addicting coffeecake that
comes with most of the break
fasts. Both Hobee's and Late for
the Train provide free coffee for
waiting crowds.
The Farmer's Market (448
California Ave., Palo Alto) has a
small menu, spotty service (semi
cafeteria style) and the ambiance
of a butcher shop, but it serves

great breakfasts (try the apple
pancakes or a ham/swiss/apple
omelette) at relatively low prices.
Finally, there's the favorite
morning meeting spot of Stanford
sororities — Dinah's Poolside
Coffee Shop (4269 El Camino,
Palo Alto.
In the midnight hour
There used to be a wealth of
places where you could go at 2
a.m. — or 4 or 6 a.m. — with the
gang and be obnoxious, or with a
loved one to fortify yourself in an
emotional crisis, or by yourself to
studv and mainline some caffeine.
Then Stickney's cut back to
midnight and became a trendy
tourist/alumni hangout, and Luv's
went to 24 hours on weekends
only and eventually became a
singles pickup joint. In the old
days, going to Denny's or Lyons
didn't even cross your mind; now
they're all that's left.
Closer (by about 100 yards)
and friendlier is Denny's (426 El
Camino, Palo Alto). Denny's is
also cheaper than Lyons, has food
that's at least as good or better
and tackier vinyl.
So why go to Lyons (4298 El
Camino, Los Altos) at all? Be
cause sometimes you need a
change. Lyons is darker, the
waitresses are younger. And if
you're determined to eat a lot of
food at 4 a.m. and get really sick,

there's nothing like a Mighty Lion
Burger. The patty melt is also
pretty good, and the pancakes are
decent.
The only competition left for
these corporate monsters is the
University Creamery (209 Uni
versity, Palo Alto), which sensed
the vacuum and went to 24-hour
service about two years ago. The
Creamery has pretty mediocre
greasy-spoon food, but the
milkshakes are big and good
(they use Bud's ice cream) and
it's a lot closer to campus —
within biking range, even. Plus
you can call your friends and
loved ones on the phones
supplied to some of the booths!
I scream for you
Everyone loves ice cream, to be
sure, but no one can deny that the
Stanford area is practically
drowning in the stuff.
Within a quick drive of campus
are a Haagen-Dazs (Stanford
Barn, 700 Welch Rd.), two
Swenson's (440 University Ave.,
Palo Alto and 1350 El Camino,
Menlo Park), Blatz Folded Ice
Cream (101 California Ave., Palo
Alto), Double Rainbow (1083 El
Camino, Menlo Park), Rick's
Rather Rich Ice Cream
(Charleston at Middlefield, Palo
Alto) and the Peninsula
Creamery (corner of Hamilton
and Emerson, Palo Alto) and the

University Creamery.
Then there is an array of Italian
ice cream shops, including Gelato
Alota (2953 So. El Camino,*San
Mateo) and Gelato Classico (437
Emerson St., Palo Alto).
With such a wide variety to
choose from, you might sample
everything and then decide.
Three things to keep in mind:
the ice cream at Rick's is smooth,
rich and delicious, the home
made waffle cones and fold-ins at
Blatz are not to be missed, and
the Peninsula Creamery has great
ice cream plus the kind of roman
tic, '50s-throwback atmosphere
that your parents would appreci
ate. You should, too.
In this, the most health
conscious state in the Union,
traditional calorie-laden dessert
fare has to compete with a power
ful threat: frozen yogurt. For
those of you who just can't bring
yourselves to splurge on tradi
tional dessert fare, Palo Alto of
fers several good purveyors of
cooled curd. By far the easiest
place to get frozen yogurt is at the
Corner Pocket in Tresidder Un
ion. Although the Co Po's fro yo
isn't quite top notch, the many
toppings available are good,
varied and cheap.
Quality frozen yogurt can also
be found at the Yogurt Village in
the Stanford Shopping Center
and at Crouton's on University.


Daily file
This Chez Louis chef looks happy with his work as he serves up one of
the restaurant's tasty French offerings.
Where the Cardinal flocks
Stanford hangouts change from
year to year, of course, hut there
are such things as old standards.
Half the people in Kamona's
(541 Ramona St., Palo Alto) on
any given weekend night will be
from Stanford; the crush is partic
ularly intense before anu after
basketball games. Most of them
will be eating the second-best
pizza in the area, while those who
want to be different chew on
calzones or decent hamburgers.
The once-great Ramona*s salad
bar retains only a shade of its
former glory.
Down the street at the Good
Earth Restaurant (185 University
Ave., Palo Alto), you'll find a dif
ferent, slightly older Stanford
crowd eating chic health food.
The iced tea at this time of year is
particularly refreshing, and so are
the yogurt-based milkshakes.

Of course, "hangouts" in the
true Stanford sense of the word
are places you go to swill beer,
and there are a few of those, too.
The Dutch Gootc (357 Ala
meda de las Pulgas, Menlo Park),
a functional sort of place where
it's standing room only on Senior
Pub Nights, and The Oasis (241
El Camino, Menlo Park), a down
right ugly place that has been wit
ness to untold decades of Stan
ford history. One thing to know:
refer to the two establishments as
"The Goose" and"The
respectively.
The granddaddy of them all,
though, is the Alpine Inn Beer
Garden (3915 Alpine Road, Por
tola Valley), more commonly
known as "/ott's." If you can fig
ure out why it's called Zott's, then
you are very intelligent and you
deserve to be at Stanford.
Zott's serves robust rectangular
burgers, French fries so good that

even the French would be proud
to have their name attached to
them, and of course, lots of beer.
Throw in a massive outdoor
eating area, a heavy contingent of
locals to dilute the Stanford in
flux, plus a nifty jukebox that
seemingly has every Elvis Presley
hit ever, and you know why this
place is a drawing card.
One of the most popular new
hangouts is the Stanford Pub
(445 Emerson, Palo Alto). Ex
pect a lively, sometimes rowdy
crowd often affiliated with
various athletic teams.
Another newish spot is the
Vortex (260 California Ave., Palo
Alto), which used to be the
Keystone Palo Alto, but now
plays lots of new wave/dance
music and features a graffiti
splattered, mannequin-dangling
interior.
In recent years an attempt has
been made to turn The Lan
cashire Tavern (547 Emerson St.,
Palo Alto) into a Stanford hang
out of the Pub Night variety, and
this year it seems to have finally
caught on. Be sure to try the
cider.
If you'd like your nightlife a bit
rowdier, try St. James Infirmary
(390 Moffett Blvd., Mountain
View) or Antonio's Nut House
(321 California Ave., Palo Alto),
places where you can get into a
fight if you try hard enough or
look enough like a Stanford stu
dent. Antonio's remodeled
during the summer and now looks
quite spiffy inside.
Slices of life
Frankie, Johnnie & I uigi Too
(939 El Camino, Mountain View)
has no peer in pizza. What it does

the ever-popular stromboli or

A distant second to FJ&L is
Ramona's, which has decent New

pizza and slightly shorter waits,
and is closer to campus.
Honorable mention goes to the
Argentine pizza with barbecue
sauce (ladled on in place of
tomato sauce) at Jose's (2275 E£l
Camino, Palo Alto), and the pizza
with almost anything on it at
Applewood Inn (1001 El Camino,
Mcnlo Park).
Mountain Mike's, at 2000 El

location very close to campus.
And new to the area is Pizza a (io

Wonders of the Orient
There is a plethora of Chinese
restaurants in the Palo Alto area.
Here are just a few:
Generations of Stanfordites
have fallen in love with the mu
shu pork at Chef Chu's (1067 N.
San Antonio Road at El Camino

crowded Mandarin restaurant
prepares perfectly solid, unexcit

at China First (675 El Camino,
Palo Alto), another place with a
big reputation. The cuisine here is
Szechuan/Hunan, albeit not too
spicy, and there are great dishes
on the menu.
Also, China Lion (3345 El
Camino, Palo Alto), is a nearby
alternative with Manda
rin/Szeehuan cooking. A new fa
vorite is Jing-Jing's (443 Emer
son Rd., Palo Alto), a Szech
wan/Hunan restaurant with excel
lent hot and sour soup.
On a more modest scale, there
are three worthwhile Chinese
places in Menlo Park. The first
two, Yuen Yung (639 Santa Cruz
Ave.) and Su Hong (1039 El

Camino), are both eclectic but
primarily Cantonese/Mandarin.
Su Hong has better food, Yuen
Yung more interesting decor — it
looks like a cross between a
Chinese restaurant and a fern bar.
A personal favorite is Ten Fu
(1352 El Camino Real), which
offers Szechwan, Hunan and
Mandarin food in a casual but
classy atmosphere. The service is
excellent and both the potstickers
and the wonton soup are other
wordly. Don't miss the fried
bananas for dessert.
If you've been starving yourself
passing up some of the tasty
entrees served by Food Service,
the place to catch up on lost food
is Colonel l.ee's Mongolian Bar-B-
Q (304 Castro, Mountain View),
basically an all-you-can-eat place
serving a rib-tickling variety of
barbecued morsels including
beef, pork, lamb and turkey.
The area is graced by a bevy of
Japanese restaurants, most ser
ving sushi. One of the best is
Mivake Restaurant (261 Univer
sity), which is quaint and not too
expensive.
South of the border
Palo Alto lost its only really
good Mexican restaurant when
the Andes Mexican Restaurant, a
Whiskey Gulch anomaly, folded
several years back. Now a trip to

Menlo Park or Los Altos is re
quired.
Rosita's Taqueria (171 A sth
Ave., Redwood City) occupies a
storefront in an uninviting part of
Redwood City, but makes the
only authentic burritos-to-go in
the area. These are big sloppy
things that can't be eaten while

beef in several sauces, steak,
chicken, sausage and tongue.
Rosita's also has a good selection
of Mexican beers and soft drinks
— you haven't lived until you've
had a Boing soda.
Lstrellita (971 North San An
tonio Rd., Los Altos) isn't what it
used to be, but it still has great
chimichangas. There are two pas
sable family-style Mexican joints
in Menlo Park: La Luna Mexican
Cafe (1137 Chestnut St.) and
Caleta (1 143 D Crane St.).
The Senor Taco Drive-In (3490
El Camino Real, Palo Alto) looks
modest, but has the burritos that
made Mexico famous.
If you don't mind a drive, the
best Latin restaurant around is
probably EI Calderon (699 El
Calderon Ave., Mountain View),
which is hidden away in a small
shopping center and has a
Mexican/Salvadoran menu.
However, if you are insistent


about staying in the area, good
food and yummy margaritas can
be found at all of the following
places: Chili's (700 El Camino,
Menlo Park, or 2560 El Camino,
Mountain View), Compadres
Mexican Bar & Grill (3877 El
Camino, Palo Alto) both of which
serve great margaritas, and
Armadillo Willy's BBQ & Cafe
(1031 N. San Antonio Rd., Los
Altos) and Acapulco's (2515 El
Camino Real, Palo Alto).
Vive la France!
Without going into too much
detail, there's one local restaurant
that comes close to meeting the
bistro ideal (good food, relatively
low prices) Le Pot au Feu (1149
El Camino, Menlo Park). Some
what more formal and relatively
expensive is Chez Louis (4170 El

Camino, Palo Alto), virtually an
institution.
Fishies from the deep blue sea
The Big Two for serious
seafood in the area are Scott's
Seafood Bar & Grill (2300 E.
Bayshore Rd.) and The Fish Mar
ket (3150 El Camino). Scott's is
the posher of the two, but The
Fish Market is closer and has a
great on-the-wharf feel, even
though it's right next to
McDonald's.
Deli delights
When the sandwich urge
strikes, try Togo's (several loca
tions, including 518 University
Ave.), Manhattan West (420
Emerson, Palo Alto) or the deli
counters at Safeway (several loca
tions) or the Town and Country
Market (corner of Embarcadero
and El Camino.)
The Bedrock (2999 El

wondrously named "Joy of

Junque," offers a good burger
and shake combination.

Yuppie love
Style is everything in a Yuppie
hangout, and Mac Arthur Park
(27 University, Palo Alto, near
the train station) is in one of the
approved styles: big, open, white
panelled spaces, wood floor, brass
railings everywhere. The food
ranges from fair to middling —
except for the barbecued meats,
which are exceptional. Be sure to

order something from the grill,
especially the ribs.
Another style is represented by
Waverley Place (560 Waverley
St, Palo Alto), which is all glass
and bleached wood and serves ex
pensive (but surprisingly good)
pastas and seafood dishes.
Along with these younger res
taurants, a couple of established
Palo Alto restaurants have swung
with the times: The Gatehouse,
one of Palo Alto's prettiest places
to eat and drink, is taken over by

the young come dinner hour, and
Henry's is a favorite with the local
advertising/design community

Ivet them eat coffeecake
Morning eaters are lucky here
— Palo Alto and Menlo Park
have lots of good restaurants that
specialize in breakfast and lunch.
First among equals is Late for

the Train (150 Middle-field Rd.,
Menlo Park, near the train sta
tion), a folksy place that makes
great omelettes, divine blitzes and
fruit pancakes and the usual
salads and sandwiches, plus ever
changing desserts. If you go on a
weekend, particularly a Sunday,
expect at least a 30-minute wait;
it's best, if you can, to go for an
early or late weekday lunch, when
you can often be seated immedi
ately.
Modeled along much the same
lines is Hobee's (two locations in
Palo Alto: 4224 El Camino and
Town and Country Village, across
from the Stadium), a family oper
ation with more branches around
the peninsula. Hobee's follows
more traditional American
breakfast lines — sausage, eggs,
ham — but isn't lacking for fresh
squeezed juices, fruit and other
California trimmings, and it has a
truly addicting coffeecake that
comes with most of the break
fasts. Both Hobee's and Late for
the Train provide free coffee for
waiting crowds.
The Farmer's Market (448
California Ave., Palo Alto) has a
small menu, spotty service (semi
cafeteria style) and the ambiance
of a butcher shop, but it serves

great breakfasts (try the apple
pancakes or a ham/swiss/apple
omelette) at relatively low prices.
Finally, there's the favorite
morning meeting spot of Stanford
sororities — Dinah's Poolside
Coffee Shop (4269 El Camino,
Palo Alto.
In the midnight hour
There used to be a wealth of
places where you could go at 2
a.m. — or 4 or 6 a.m. — with the
gang and be obnoxious, or with a
loved one to fortify yourself in an
emotional crisis, or by yourself to
studv and mainline some caffeine.
Then Stickney's cut back to
midnight and became a trendy
tourist/alumni hangout, and Luv's
went to 24 hours on weekends
only and eventually became a
singles pickup joint. In the old
days, going to Denny's or Lyons
didn't even cross your mind; now
they're all that's left.
Closer (by about 100 yards)
and friendlier is Denny's (426 El
Camino, Palo Alto). Denny's is
also cheaper than Lyons, has food
that's at least as good or better
and tackier vinyl.
So why go to Lyons (4298 El
Camino, Los Altos) at all? Be
cause sometimes you need a
change. Lyons is darker, the
waitresses are younger. And if
you're determined to eat a lot of
food at 4 a.m. and get really sick,

there's nothing like a Mighty Lion
Burger. The patty melt is also
pretty good, and the pancakes are
decent.
The only competition left for
these corporate monsters is the
University Creamery (209 Uni
versity, Palo Alto), which sensed
the vacuum and went to 24-hour
service about two years ago. The
Creamery has pretty mediocre
greasy-spoon food, but the
milkshakes are big and good
(they use Bud's ice cream) and
it's a lot closer to campus —
within biking range, even. Plus
you can call your friends and
loved ones on the phones
supplied to some of the booths!
I scream for you
Everyone loves ice cream, to be
sure, but no one can deny that the
Stanford area is practically
drowning in the stuff.
Within a quick drive of campus
are a Haagen-Dazs (Stanford
Barn, 700 Welch Rd.), two
Swenson's (440 University Ave.,
Palo Alto and 1350 El Camino,
Menlo Park), Blatz Folded Ice
Cream (101 California Ave., Palo
Alto), Double Rainbow (1083 El
Camino, Menlo Park), Rick's
Rather Rich Ice Cream
(Charleston at Middlefield, Palo
Alto) and the Peninsula
Creamery (corner of Hamilton
and Emerson, Palo Alto) and the

University Creamery.
Then there is an array of Italian
ice cream shops, including Gelato
Alota (2953 So. El Camino,*San
Mateo) and Gelato Classico (437
Emerson St., Palo Alto).
With such a wide variety to
choose from, you might sample
everything and then decide.
Three things to keep in mind:
the ice cream at Rick's is smooth,
rich and delicious, the home
made waffle cones and fold-ins at
Blatz are not to be missed, and
the Peninsula Creamery has great
ice cream plus the kind of roman
tic, '50s-throwback atmosphere
that your parents would appreci
ate. You should, too.
In this, the most health
conscious state in the Union,
traditional calorie-laden dessert
fare has to compete with a power
ful threat: frozen yogurt. For
those of you who just can't bring
yourselves to splurge on tradi
tional dessert fare, Palo Alto of
fers several good purveyors of
cooled curd. By far the easiest
place to get frozen yogurt is at the
Corner Pocket in Tresidder Un
ion. Although the Co Po's fro yo
isn't quite top notch, the many
toppings available are good,
varied and cheap.
Quality frozen yogurt can also
be found at the Yogurt Village in
the Stanford Shopping Center
and at Crouton's on University.
