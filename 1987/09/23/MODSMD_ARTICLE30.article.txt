Student bibliophiles (even
bibliomaniacs) are faced with an
unusual problem at Stanford.
Finding a good bookstore near
campus is no challenge. Choosing
is the hard part.
Between California Avenue, in
Palo Alto, and Santa Cruz Ave
nue, in Menlo Park, there are
nearly 30 stores that sell only (or
primarily) books, and a number
of other establishments — thrift
shops, consignment shops, out
door stores, etc. — that keep
books on hand. Any attempt to
cover them all would be over
whelming; the following account
attempts to point out the the
highlights.
The place to start, of course, is
on campus. The Stanford Book
store is both more than, and less
than, a good bookstore. More,
because half of its floor space is
given over to office, art and engi
neering supplies, clothing, candy
and cookies, stationary, cards,
and hundreds of useless items
that say "Stanford." The
Bookstore also stocks textbooks
(upstairs), orders art prints and
does a lot of other things most
bookstores won't.
It is less than a good bookstore,
however, because it isn't a very
nice place to browse for books. If
you're looking for something spe
cific, the selection is excellent in
most areas (particularly art his
tory and literary criticism), but
the atmosphere in the front of the
store, where the books are
shelved, will inevitably force you
to find the book you want quickly
and leave. The lighting is un
pleasant, there is no seating of
any kind, and the rows of often
crowded check-out lines make
the store resemble a supermarket.
It's a good place to find a book
(they will order anything in
print), but it ranks low as a place
for browsing.
The campus is bracketed by the
area's two best "new book"
bookstores. To the southeast is
Printers Inc. (310 California
Ave.). Printers Inc. has estab

lished itself as one of the most
popular places around, largely on
the strength of its espresso bar
and its artsy/literary ambiance.
You saunter in, feel the warmth,
smell the coffee and don't want to
leave. Printers Inc. calls itself
"the literary bookstore," and
most nights the store is full of
English professors, local artist
types, a few real writers and Palo
Alto intellectuals.
Printers Inc. is a good store,
well-stocked in most areas (hard
and softcover). The store is espe

cially strong in fiction and
children's books, with lots of
chairs scattered around and nice
carpeting. Perhaps the best thing
about Printers Inc. is its the mag
azine selection. Scattered around
the front of the store are
hundreds of periodicals — every
thing from Arizona Highways to
Vogue to the area's best selection
of scholarly and literary journals.

What the Stanford Bookstore lacks in ambience, it makes up for in selection.
Kepler's. Kepler's is a local
landmark, having been a focus for
"radical" activity in the 19605.
The store has since changed with
the times; today, its image is
composed of equal parts environ
mental awareness, small-scale
technology advocacy and champi
onship of small and avant-garde
presses.
The main bragging point at
Kepler's, as far as books go, is its

claim to be the biggest paperback
bookstore around. Most people
don't find the whole store during
their first visit. Eventually, on
their second or third trip, they
stumble into the back stacks and
find the other half of the store's
books.
Kepler's has a magazine selec
tion second only to Printer's Inc's.
among local bookstores, and a
section devoted to small press
publications. Both stores are
open late. Printers Inc. until 11
p.m. every night and Kepler's un
til 11 p.m. weeknights and until
midnight on weekends.

Several other bookstores
deserve mention. Stacey's (219
University Ave.) has grown into a
good place to browse through a
wide variety of books.
Stacey's began as strictly a
medical/technical store, but has
expanded into most of the general
areas. Scientific books still seem
to be the store's strength, but the
photography section is worth a
look.
Behind Macy's, in the Stanford
Shopping Center, you'll find
Books Inc., a hardcover/softcover
store notable for its paperback
mystery and science fiction stocks

and its remainder tables.
There are, of course, the usual
chain stores in the area; you
should shun them its a matter of
principle, but occasionally a bar
gain can be found there. Closest
to campus is B. Dalion's, in the
Stanford Shopping Center.
Then there are the specialty
bookstores . Arguably the most
interesting store of this type is
Minerva Books (1027 Alma, Palo
Alto), a small but very attractive
store with interesting selections in
mythology and religion.
Comics & Comix (405 Califor

nia Ave.) has lots of comic books,
science fiction paperbacks,
posters and magazines. Its stock
runs toward sadistic porn, and the
clientele appears to be mostly of
high-school age. Future Fantasy
(233 El Camino, Palo Alto) is
smaller, but more serious.
All the backpacking stores
(Sierra Designs, Ski Hut and
North Face) carry books related
to their specialties: hiking and
climbing guides, nature books,
camping directories. Two places
with more extensive stocks in
these areas are the Nature Com

pany (Stanford Shopping Cen
ter), and the Peninsula Conserva
tion Center (2253 Park Blvd).
The Conservation Center also has
a library, a gift-shop and a walk
through water-saving garden. A
few doors down at 2185 Park
Blvd., is Peninsula Scientific,
which carries books along with its
telescopes, microscopes and
freeze-dried bacteria.
Finally, Szwede Slavic Books
(2233 El Camino, Palo Alto)
carries an impressive selection of
books written in Eastern Euro
pean languages.

The place to start, of course, is
on campus. The Stanford Book
store is both more than, and less
than, a good bookstore. More,
because half of its floor space is
given over to office, art and engi
neering supplies, clothing, candy
and cookies, stationary, cards,
and hundreds of useless items
that say "Stanford." The
Bookstore also stocks textbooks
(upstairs), orders art prints and
does a lot of other things most
bookstores won't.
It is less than a good bookstore,
however, because it isn't a very
nice place to browse for books. If
you're looking for something spe
cific, the selection is excellent in
most areas (particularly art his
tory and literary criticism), but
the atmosphere in the front of the
store, where the books are
shelved, will inevitably force you
to find the book you want quickly
and leave. The lighting is un
pleasant, there is no seating of
any kind, and the rows of often
crowded check-out lines make
the store resemble a supermarket.
It's a good place to find a book
(they will order anything in
print), but it ranks low as a place
for browsing.
The campus is bracketed by the
area's two best "new book"
bookstores. To the southeast is
Printers Inc. (310 California
Ave.). Printers Inc. has estab

lished itself as one of the most
popular places around, largely on
the strength of its espresso bar
and its artsy/literary ambiance.
You saunter in, feel the warmth,
smell the coffee and don't want to
leave. Printers Inc. calls itself
"the literary bookstore," and
most nights the store is full of
English professors, local artist
types, a few real writers and Palo
Alto intellectuals.
Printers Inc. is a good store,
well-stocked in most areas (hard
and softcover). The store is espe

cially strong in fiction and
children's books, with lots of
chairs scattered around and nice
carpeting. Perhaps the best thing
about Printers Inc. is its the mag
azine selection. Scattered around
the front of the store are
hundreds of periodicals — every
thing from Arizona Highways to
Vogue to the area's best selection
of scholarly and literary journals.

What the Stanford Bookstore lacks in ambience, it makes up for in selection.
Kepler's. Kepler's is a local
landmark, having been a focus for
"radical" activity in the 19605.
The store has since changed with
the times; today, its image is
composed of equal parts environ
mental awareness, small-scale
technology advocacy and champi
onship of small and avant-garde
presses.
The main bragging point at
Kepler's, as far as books go, is its

claim to be the biggest paperback
bookstore around. Most people
don't find the whole store during
their first visit. Eventually, on
their second or third trip, they
stumble into the back stacks and
find the other half of the store's
books.
Kepler's has a magazine selec
tion second only to Printer's Inc's.
among local bookstores, and a
section devoted to small press
publications. Both stores are
open late. Printers Inc. until 11
p.m. every night and Kepler's un
til 11 p.m. weeknights and until
midnight on weekends.

Several other bookstores
deserve mention. Stacey's (219
University Ave.) has grown into a
good place to browse through a
wide variety of books.
Stacey's began as strictly a
medical/technical store, but has
expanded into most of the general
areas. Scientific books still seem
to be the store's strength, but the
photography section is worth a
look.
Behind Macy's, in the Stanford
Shopping Center, you'll find
Books Inc., a hardcover/softcover
store notable for its paperback
mystery and science fiction stocks

and its remainder tables.
There are, of course, the usual
chain stores in the area; you
should shun them its a matter of
principle, but occasionally a bar
gain can be found there. Closest
to campus is B. Dalion's, in the
Stanford Shopping Center.
Then there are the specialty
bookstores . Arguably the most
interesting store of this type is
Minerva Books (1027 Alma, Palo
Alto), a small but very attractive
store with interesting selections in
mythology and religion.
Comics & Comix (405 Califor

nia Ave.) has lots of comic books,
science fiction paperbacks,
posters and magazines. Its stock
runs toward sadistic porn, and the
clientele appears to be mostly of
high-school age. Future Fantasy
(233 El Camino, Palo Alto) is
smaller, but more serious.
All the backpacking stores
(Sierra Designs, Ski Hut and
North Face) carry books related
to their specialties: hiking and
climbing guides, nature books,
camping directories. Two places
with more extensive stocks in
these areas are the Nature Com

pany (Stanford Shopping Cen
ter), and the Peninsula Conserva
tion Center (2253 Park Blvd).
The Conservation Center also has
a library, a gift-shop and a walk
through water-saving garden. A
few doors down at 2185 Park
Blvd., is Peninsula Scientific,
which carries books along with its
telescopes, microscopes and
freeze-dried bacteria.
Finally, Szwede Slavic Books
(2233 El Camino, Palo Alto)
carries an impressive selection of
books written in Eastern Euro
pean languages.
Student bibliophiles (even
bibliomaniacs) are faced with an
unusual problem at Stanford.
Finding a good bookstore near
campus is no challenge. Choosing
is the hard part.
Between California Avenue, in
Palo Alto, and Santa Cruz Ave
nue, in Menlo Park, there are
nearly 30 stores that sell only (or
primarily) books, and a number
of other establishments — thrift
shops, consignment shops, out
door stores, etc. — that keep
books on hand. Any attempt to
cover them all would be over
whelming; the following account
attempts to point out the the
highlights.
