Student bibliophiles (even
bibliomaniacs) are faced with an
unusual problem at Stanford.
Finding a good bookstore near
campus is no challenge. Choosing
is the hard part.
Between California Avenue, in
Palo Alto, and Santa Cruz Ave
nue, in Menlo Park, there are
nearly 30 stores that sell only (or
primarily) books, and a number
of other establishments — thrift
shops, consignment shops, out
door stores, etc. — that keep
books on hand. Any attempt to
cover them all would be over
whelming; the following account
attempts to point out the the
highlights.
The place to start, of course, is
on campus. The Stanford Book
store is both more than, and less
than, a good bookstore. More,
because half of its floor space is
given over to office, art and engi
neering supplies, clothing, candy
and cookies, stationary, cards,
and hundreds of useless items
that say "Stanford." The
Bookstore also stocks textbooks
(upstairs), orders art prints and
does a lot of other things most
bookstores won't.
It is less than a good bookstore,
however, because it isn't a very
nice place to browse for books. If
you're looking for something spe
cific, the selection is excellent in
most areas (particularly art his
tory and literary criticism), but
the atmosphere in the front of the
store, where the books are
shelved, will inevitably force you
to find the book you want quickly
and leave. The lighting is un
pleasant, there is no seating of
any kind, and the rows of often
crowded check-out lines make
the store resemble a supermarket.
It's a good place to find a book
(they will order anything in
print), but it ranks low as a place
for browsing.
The campus is bracketed by the
area's two best "new book"
bookstores. To the southeast is
Printers Inc. (310 California
Ave.). Printers Inc. has estab

lished itself as one of the most
popular places around, largely on
the strength of its espresso bar
and its artsy/literary ambiance.
You saunter in, feel the warmth,
smell the coffee and don't want to
leave. Printers Inc. calls itself
"the literary bookstore," and
most nights the store is full of
English professors, local artist
types, a few real writers and Palo
Alto intellectuals.
Printers Inc. is a good store,
well-stocked in most areas (hard
and softcover). The store is espe

cially strong in fiction and
children's books, with lots of
chairs scattered around and nice
carpeting. Perhaps the best thing
about Printers Inc. is its the mag
azine selection. Scattered around
the front of the store are
hundreds of periodicals — every
thing from Arizona Highways to
Vogue to the area's best selection
of scholarly and literary journals.

What the Stanford Bookstore lacks in ambience, it makes up for in selection.
