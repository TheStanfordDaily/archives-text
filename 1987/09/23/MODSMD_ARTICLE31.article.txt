# Moonlight madness: "clubbing" in the City
## 
### 
When the sun sets, the Bay Area wakes up. But
we aren't talking about Palo Alto here. San Fran
cisco has more nightclubs than Los Angeles — a city
with eight times as many inhabitants.
Of course, it is difficult to find your way around
the City s nightclub scene when you don't always
know where to go. Here, then, is a guide to San
Francisco night spots worth frequenting.
If you enjoy hazards and want to go out of your
way to create them, then the Mabuhay Gardens is
waiting for you with open safety pins. Here punk
music seems to have finally settled its feud with (and
acknowledged its debt to) heavy metal. Perhaps in
deference to this newly discovered patrimony (or
perhaps to the sacred cash cow of the concert-going
public), punk clubs often have "metal nights," and
punk audences these days do tend to have more of

an axle-grease aura around them, which is actually
perfect for the Mabuhay Gardens. The "Fab Mab"
is like a slightly oversized garage, with brick walls
and a self-consciously dangerous air about it. Even
if you don't go, at least call the place — the
messages on the answering machine are not to be
missed.
The bands here have the best names in the Bay
Area, though certainly not top tonal quality. Still
thriving as a Polynesian restaurant by day, leather
ette cave by night, the club is best for those who un
derstand the colossal joke taking place six or seven
nights a week. That's entertainment.
Roosting at the mouth of Broadway, the Fab Mab
also serves as an introduction to the North Beach
area of the City, where most of the real nightclubs
reside. Right across the street from the Mab is The
Stone.

The Stone is sort of a hybrid. It has the physical
qualities of its immediate neighbor, but the music
selection is of a decidedly pop flavor.
If you go down Broadway a few blocks (neg
otiating your way past the massage parlors and
striptease acts) and turn onto Columbus, you'll
eventually pass Wolfgang's, the physical successor
to the Boarding House (901 Columbus), and the
spiritual heir to the Old Waldorf as promoter Bill
Graham's Home for Acts That Can't Sell Out the
Coliseum. Thanks to damage from a summertime
fire, Wolfgang's may still be closed for a while, so be
sure to call before making plans to see if they're
open. The sound is decent, the stage and lighting
very good, and there's even a balcony for those who
really don't go to clubs to see the band. The only
caveats to the clubber are well-known to Waldorf
denizens: Beware the drink minimum (the
"Calistoga with Orange Flavor" tastes like it should
have the word agent" in its title somewhere), and
the food (Chicken Lollipops? Come on).
The Kabuki Nightclub at the Japan Center near
Geary Street no longer exists, but the Japantown
Bowling Alley across the street (open until 4 a.m.
on Wednesdays and Thursdays and 24 hours a day
weekends) still provides entertainment (of sorts) in
the Japantown section of the city.
And if you like to combine a night of bowling with
music and rock video, then the Park Bowl on Haight
Street was designed with you in mind. Located a
couple of blocks away from the I-Bcam. one of the
more elaborate dance clubs on the scene (forget the
bands — the stage is a show in itself), the Park Bowl
is your basic, well-mannered direct-from-Mucie,
Ind., bowling alley during the week.
But on Friday and Saturday nighis, the lights go
down, the volume goes up and a 12-foot video
screen descends and hovers over the center lanes. It

and satellite TV sets around the alley show rock
videos and the like while the paying customers (a $6
to $9 cover charge for admission, depending on
which night you go) take their turns at the bowling
line and dance back to their seats. There's a bar,
too, for the athletically inclined. As a concept, the
Park Bowl is tascinating; it inspires the kind of
never-there-but-nostalgic-anyway sight that you
only hear outside old drive-in hamburger stands and
broadway revivals. Moreover, the darn thing works;
it's a lot of fun, and you very rarely get a chance to
think what a stupid game bowling is. If nightclub
bing is the art of distraction, the Park Bowl on
Friday and Saturday nights should be bronzed.
In your search for the perfect San Francisco club,
you'll probably find clubs off the beaten path, and
certainly ones not mentioned here. The North
Beach area has most of the big clubs, but there's a
better variety of acts south of Market Street around
the China Basin. The only problem with this area is
that most of the "clubs" are converted warehouses,
with few comforts and even fewer ways of finding
out about performances. These, however, are the
kind of places you'll find non-mainstream local acts
like Chris Isaac.
In past years, the Oasis nightclub on I lth and Fol
som has been one of the most popular venues in the
SoMa (South of Market) district. Main attraction: a
large swimming pool, which serves its normal func
tion during during the day, but is magically trans
formed with a plexiglass cover for dancing at night.
Unfortunately, the Oasis has developed something
of a "meat market" reputation of late, and cover
charges can run fairly high.
More favored by the younger set and the "black
and-white" crowd are Das Klub (on Folsom be-
