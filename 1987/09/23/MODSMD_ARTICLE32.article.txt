What museums are to Flor
ence. the theater is to San Fran
cisco.
No matter how much people
talk about San Francisco opera,
or the City's nightclubs, it is the
area's hundreds of theater groups
that validate San Francisco's
claim to West Coast cultural
supremacy.
Fhe most important activity
takes place in the many small
theater groups scattered around
San Francisco and Berkeley; the
following account starts closer to
home, covering the campus and
area theater first, then moving to
the City's major groups, ana fi
nally arriving at the smaller
venues.
The Stanford Drama Depart
ment presents a major play each
quarter, with productions usually
taking place in the Little Theater
located behind Memorial Aud
itorium. The productions are di
rected and designed by members
of the department, but cast audi
tions are open to the public and
students from fields other than
drama are often cast.
In addition to the major pro
ductions, the department spon
sors Graduate Directing Work
shops, "no frills" productions di
rected by the department's
graduate students. These free
shows are held at The Nitery, in
the Old Union.

There are several successful,
on-going, student-run production
companies on campus. Chief
among these is Ram's Head,
which produces "Gaieties," a
hugely popular comedy revue
during Big Game week in the fall
that most students will put aside
anything to see. Filled with Stan
ford jokes, silly puns and —
usually — a goodly number of
sexual innuendos, the show gears
up the campus to beat Cal and
provides inside jokes for weeks
after the Big Game hype. Ram's
Head also produces the student
written "winter One Acts"
during winter quarter and a major
musical production each spring.
This year, "Jesus Christ Super
star" is in the works.
The Company is a smaller
group with a more flexible pro
duction schedule, where individ
ual initiative counts most in de
termining what plays are
produced and when. The Com
pany's productions vary greatly in
scope, ranging in recent years
from the elaborate stagings of
"Hair" and "Jesus Christ Super
star" to a traveling troupe that
went from dorm to dorm per
forming "The Fantasticks" in
lounges.
The Black Performing Arts
Group and the Asian American
Theatre Project also produce
plays, usually concentrating their

efforts on spring quarter. Several
years ago, the AATP put on the
first performance anywhere of
David Henry Hwang's FOB, a
play which was later produced, to
critical acclaim, by Joseph Papp
in New York.
All of the student production
companies rely, of course, on stu
dent ability in all areas: perform
ance, direction, set and lighting,
costume work and promotion.
Announcements regarding audi
tions and support positions ap
pear in The v Daily and in fliers
posted around campus.
Spring quarter is prime time for
dorm productions. Most of the
larger dorms, along with some of
the ambitious small ones, put on
plays at this time. The repertoire
is drawn mainly from Broadway
comedies and musicals. Over the
years, some dorms have gained a
reputation for the lavishness of
their productions; Branner,
Toyon, Roble and Lagunita all
are famous in this regard.
In San Francisco, the American
Conservatory Theatre, or ACT,
ranks as one of the country's best
regional theaters. Its presence in
the Geary Theatre, at 450 Geary
in the City, makes Geary Street
the heart of the theater district.
Few companies in the Bay Area,
or even on the East Coast
(outside of Shakespearean festi
val groups) can rival the ACT in

performance, facilities or reputa
tion.
The ACT is an arch-con
servative company: they go heavy
on the classics, and the modern
(meaning 19205) plays they do
perform tend to be of the spar
kling British wit (Noel Coward)
or the folksy-American ("I re
member Mama," "Ah! Wilder
ness") kind. But they are nearly
always a joy to watch, because no
one puts polish on a production
these days like the ACT. The
company's annual rendering of
"A Christmas Carol" is a gem,
well worth leaving the library for
an evening during fall quarter
Dead Week.
The big money in San Fran
cisco theater is tied up in Carole
Shorenstein's two "Best of
Broadway" series. "Best of
Broadway" plays in three differ
ent theatres: the Golden Gate, 25
Taylor St.; the Orpheum, 1192
Market St.; and the Curran, 445
Geary St. (next door to the
ACT). All three host traveling
productions of Broadway hits.
Smaller-scale New York suc
cesses, such as Caryl Churchill's
"Cloud 9" or Harvey Fierstein's
"Torch Song Trilogy," will
sometimes be brought to Theatre
on the Square or the Marine's
Memorial Theatre, both located
in the Geary district near Union
Square.
Although it docs not often
receive much publicity, the bulk
of theatrical activity in San Fran
cisco is centered around the
smaller, semi-professional thea
ters. It is here that most of the lo
cal actors work, where the local
authors often have their plays
first performed and where the lo
cal technicians get to try out their
ideas. They are often referred to
as the "99-seat" theaters, be
cause by limiting themselves to
fewer than 100 seats, they may
avoid Equity (i.e., union) pay
scales and thus mount new pro
ductions at relatively low cost.
The size of these theaters also
brings benefits to the audience.
Spaces this small offer an inti
macy and intensity that almost
never attained in a large theater.
There is often no extravagant
stage; sometimes just a space on
the floor surrounded bv seats.
The traditional distance between
audience and performer can be
almost completely wiped out, em
phasizing the "live" aspects that
give theater its unique excite
ment.
Another advantage of the small

size is that writers and directors
are offered a great deal of
flexibility. The risks of mounting
a production are not so great, and
experimentation is common. An
other important feature is that the
theaters may specialize — only
producing plays with certain
themes, or plays connected with
some social or political group.
Trying to describe this aspect of
San Francisco theater can be dif
ficult since companies can surface
and then quickly disappear.
There are a number of theaters,
however, which have become an
established part of the City's cul
tural life. Even if it omits the
more volatile companies, a des
cription of their work should give
an impression of the vitality of
small theater in the Bay Area.
The Magic Theatre is the best
known of the small theaters in
San Francisco, specializing in new
plays and often staging experi
mental theater pieces by perform
ance artists.
The Julian Theatre specializes
in plays dealing with current
events and contemporary social
issues. In addition, its productions
are usually multi-racial and multi
cultural, thus giving an implicit
social consciousness to any play it
performs. The Julian is located at
953 DeHaro Street, on Potrero
Hill.
Headed by recent Stanford
graduate Simone Genatt, the
Zephr Theater (25 Van Ness) and

its American International
Players produce multi-media dra
matic works focusing on modern
political and social concerns.
There are numerous ethnic and
social groups in the City;
playwrights and performers from
these groups have come together
to form theaters that concentrate
on the special interests and tradi
tion of their communities. Two of
the best-known groups of this
type are Theatre Rhinoceros and
the Asian-American Theatre
Company. Theatre Rhinoceros
produces plays about homo
sexuals, several years ago it
premiered Fierstein's "Torch
Song Trilogy."
Because of its strong emphasis
on improvisation and its often
transitory nature, it is difficult to
give much concrete information
about performance art in the
City. It is almost completely un
publicized, with information
being spread by word-of-mouth
among the artist's friends and col
leagues. Another problem is that
the works are often performed in
such unusual settings as empty
lots, warehouses or parking lots.
The small theaters in San Fran
cisco often put on plays with brief
runs and do not have much
money to spend on publicity. As a
result, just finding out what is
going on can be a challenge. The
San Francisco Chronicle s pink
Datebook section is a good place
to start, though.
