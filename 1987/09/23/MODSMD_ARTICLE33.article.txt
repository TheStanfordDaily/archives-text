# Area art: a beginner's guide
## 
### 
Keeping track of Bay Area art — what is
being done and what is being exhibited — is
the hardest job of all for the culture hound.
Except for a few major museums, art tends to
be the least publicized aspect of the Bay-
Area's cultural life. Adding to this problem is
the fact that many small galleries, especially in
San Francisco, stage important exhibits that
unfortunately last a month or less. Because of
the vast number of places in the area exhibit
ing art, the following account is necessarily
highly arbitrary, covering only a few of the
most important venues.
The Stanford Art Department maintains
both the Stanford Museum of Art and the
Stanford Art Gallery. The museum's perma
nent collection is a marvelous resource for
students. All periods of European art are
represented, and there are rooms devoted
soiey to Greek, Roman, Asian and Oceanic
art. There is also a large gallery devoted to
Stanford family memorabilia. The museum's
main claim to fame is its renowned Rodin col
lection, which is housed in a special rotunda
within the museum and in an expansive out
door garden west of the building. The center
piece of the garden is a full-sized casting of
Rodin's "The Gates of Hell."
The Stanford Gallery, in the Graduate
School of Business, Hoover Tower and the
Art and History buildings, holds rotating ex
hibits throughout the year, including the an
nual show of work by candidates for the

Master of Fine Arts degree. The Art building
also houses the Gallery Bookshop, which sells
art books, cards and posters.
A number of other places on campus put on
art exhibits more or less regularly. STARTS
(Student Arts at Stanford) offers monthly ex
hibits in the in the upstairs lobby of Tresidder
Union. The Bechtel International Center puts
on exhibits with international, often Third
World, themes.
San Francisco is home to four major
museums, three of which are under common
management. These three, the "Fine Arts
Museums of San Francisco," are the M.H. de
Young Memorial Museum, the Asian Art
Museum (both in the same building in Golden
Gate Park) and the California Palace of the
Legion of Honor (Lincoln Park).
The de Young's collection, which encom
passes Western art from Greek and Roman to
early 20th-century European and American
art, isn't particularly noteworthy (i.e., one
visit is enough), but the museum plays host to
many of the top national traveling shows. In
past years, for example, San Francisco money
hits brought the King Tut, Alexander and
Shanghai exhibits to the de Young.
The Asian Art Museum has one of the best
permanent collections in its field in the
country. Unfortunately, there isn't enough
room on the walls for more than a fraction of
it. The collection is constantly rotated.
The Palace of the Legion of Honor collec

tion is composed entirely of French art, from
medieval tapestries to a room of impres
sionists and post-impressionists. In the base
ment of the Legion is the museum's graphic
arts department, which puts up rotating ex
hibits of prints and drawings. The Legion also
draws big-name temporary exhibits — the
Philips collection and the Dresden exhibit
have been there in recent years.
The fourth of San Francisco's major
museums is the rather small Museum of
Modern Art (Van Ness and McAllister, in the
Civic Center). The MOM A can't pretend to
be a catalogue of 20th-century art like its
namesake in New York. In fact, its permanent
collection is surprisingly meager. It has its
strengths, however, especially its vast photog
raphy holdings (100 little of which are ever
hung) and a room of monumental paintings by
local abstract expressionist Clyfford Still.
MOM A, like the Fine Arts Museums, draws
big traveling exhibits all the time (San Fran
cisco probably draws more of these than any
American city other than New York).
Across the bay, the Oakland Museum
(1000 Oak St., near Lake Merritt and the
Lake Merritt BART station) is worth a visit if
only for the building itself, an award-winning
concrete pile with roof-top gardens designed
by Kevin Roche. The museum is officially The
Museum of California and has galleries
devoted to California art, history and natural
sciences.

Although Rodin sculptures can be found scattered around the Stanford
campus in all manner of poses, most of them are kept in the special
Rodin Sculpture Garden near the Stanford Museum.
