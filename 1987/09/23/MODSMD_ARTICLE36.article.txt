# Escaping the grind
## Adventures nearby: take a hike; baste on the beach 
### 
California weather has been
proven to induce frequent volley
ball games and frisbee matches.
Plenty of room to do that here on
the Farm, but when you want to
truly Hit The Road in search of
other adventures, many choices
await you.

The world's largest ocean is less
than an hour away. Half Moon
Bay, with its beautiful beaches
and cliffs, can be reached by fol
lowing Interstate 280 to San
Mateo and then taking Highway
92 west over the hills to the coast.
For a more scenic route — and

one that can be traveled by bike
or moped — take Sand Hill Road
over Interstate 280 and beyond,
pass Whiskey Hill Road and turn
right over Sand Hill onto Portola
Road. Turn left from Portola
onto La Honda Road, which
winds through some breathtaking
redwood forests up to Skyline
Boulevard. Continue on La
Honda down to the coast at San
Gregorio.
The beach there has great caves
and a concession stand, but closes
at dusk. Beaches with camp
grounds are just a little bit farther
south along the coast.
The water at San Gregorio is
cold (freezing, actually). South of
Santa Cruz the water gets a little
warmer, but strong undercurrents
make swimming hazardous.
The beaches near San Fran
cisco are predictably windy, but
pretty — the Point Reyes Na
tional Seashore, just north of the
City, has miles of hiking areas.
If you find bodies beautiful and
tan lines disgusting, there are
several nude beaches in the Bay
Area. Edun Cove Beach, proba
bly the most beautiful of them all,
is located on private land outside
of San Francisco. To get there,
follow Highway 1 north past
Rockaway Beach, past the point
where the highway turns into a
two-lane road and three miles
past an A&W stand. When you
see an American flag and a sign
that says "Beach Parking,"
you've made it.
For those who prefer woods to
water, California's incomparable
state parks offer trails for hiking
and campgrounds for camping.
The closest parks include Mount

Tamalpais, site of the famous
Muir Woods redwood grove.
Tamalpais, which is just north of
San Francisco, has wonderful
hiking trails.
Castle Rock, off Skyline
Boulevard west of campus, is a fa
vorite of rock climbers. Call (408)
338-6132 for camping reserva
tions.
Big Basin Redwoods State
Park, in the Santa Cruz Moun
tains southwest of Stanford, has
more than 35 miles of hiking
trails; call (408) 338-5132 for
reservations.
Camping equipment is easy to
get; the Stanford Outdoor Ad
venture and Recreation (SOAR)
office at Tresidder Union rents
tents, backpacks and sleeping
bags cheaply. The North Face
store in Palo Alto also rents out
door equipment at reasonable
rates.
Those who only want a mild
dose of the outdoors can go to
one of Palo Alto's community
parks; many offer picnic facilities
and playing fields. Byxbee Park,
at East Embarcadero, has 1800
acres of land, a duck pond and a
yacht harbor.
Instead of walking the streets
of San Francisco, why not
rollerskate? There are rental out
lets in Golden Gate Park where
you can get a prime pair of skates
for about $5 per day.
Bicycle rental is generally
about $1.50 to $2 per hour, de
pending on the speed and make.
Be sure to bring an I.D. and
deposit money. Avenue Cyclery,
on the east side of the park, has
3-, 5- and 10-speed bikes and is
open every day (phone 387-
3155).
