# Fun on the Farm: what the tour guide left out
## 
### 
You've gone on the campus tour. It took an hour.
You saw some interesting stuff. But there's an
empty feeling in your stomach. This is partly he
cause you haven't eaten lunch and partly because
you know there's more of Stanford to see. Besides,
you're going to be here for a few years, and you
need some places to go.
Don't despair. There are many spots the tour
guide didn't show you, places hidden, and some not
so-hidden. The sprawling Stanford campus has
many special attractions worth seeking out.
The following is a guide to the hidden Stanford.
These places range from gorgeous to just plain
bizarre. Most you'll never see on postcards, but all
are worth seeing at least once. And, of course, you
can make a few discoveries and jaunts into unex
pected places on your own.
Hoover Tower
Begin your tour of the hidden Stanford with a trip
to the top of Hoover Tower. The elevator ride is
great, and once you get to the top you can see tor
miles around. From here, you'll spot parts of the
campus you never knew existed.
Steam tunnels
We law-abiding citizens have never actually been
down in these ourselves, but we hear they're really
cool.
A network of tunnels lies under the University.
Although it is illegal, "spelunking" in the steam tun
nels has become a sort of tradition with some groups
on campus. Rumor has it that one party of explorers
even ordered a Domino's pi/va from a steam tunnel
under the Quad.
Stanford Mausoleum
A little morbid perhaps, but a gorgeous structure

nonetheless. And it's worth the trip just to see the
magnificent oak tree that guards the crypt. While
you're here, be sure to see the Angel of Grief statue
nearby.
Cactus garden
Right next to the mausoleum, the collection of
cacti and other exotic vegetation used to be the
lovers' lane of Stanford students. Now it's a bit
overgrown, but still beautiful.
The Dish
It's hard to miss the big satellite dish in the foot
hills behind Stanford, but many people miss visiting
it. Take the path that begins off Junipero Serra
Blvd. across the street from Lake Lagunita, and it's
just a short — though uphill — walk to the Dish.
(In-shape runners like to "run the Dish.") There,

you'll have a beautiful view of the Bay Area. An
other great place to have a picnic, the Dish is also
the best place on campus to watch the sun rise or
set
Cowtipping — pushing over the cows that sleep
standing in the fields around the Dish — is said to be
another favorite pastime, although many say cow
tipping stories are tall tales.
Meyer Library sundecks
Speaking of great places to watch the sun set,
here's the second best. Stand on the deck that faces
the center of campus and see the red tile roofs
bathed in the pastels of twilight. Ahhh . . . makes
you want to study or at least go to the library more
often.
Green Library
Sure, everybody and his or her dog goes here to

study, but there are so many other attractions. Start
in the old (west) wing, hut before you go in, admire
the outside and the neat arcade that runs across it.
Once you're inside, just walk straight ahead up the
stairway into the rotunda. This beautiful space hosts
an ever-changing variety of exhibits. Off to the left
when you get to the top of the stairs is the Rare
Book Room, a must-see.
Now, it's time to check out the University Ar
chives. History buffs and anyone interested in Stan
ford's past will go crazy here. The Archives are
housed in the beautiful Bender Room at the very
top of Green, on the seventh floor.
Be sure to take the elevator up. It's a great old or
ange crate of a contraption — even if you've got no
curiosity about Stanford, you'll soon be anxious to
get to the Archives. But don't worry. As one lady in
elevator put it, "When it gets stuck, it's never for
more than a few minutes."
If you survive the elevator ride, you'll find the Ar
chives a wonderful place, staffed by extremely gra
cious and helpful people.
Highlights of the newer east wing are the fountain
outside, the Jonsson Library of Government Docu
ments, a periodical section that surely has your
hometown paper and a staff of research librarians
who can seemingly answer any question. Try them.
Now, if given all these alternatives you still must
study, at least try the West Stacks once. Here, you
can sit among musty and dusty books or study next
to an open window looking out on — and well
within hearing distance of the soothing sounds of —
the Shumway "Hoop" Fountain.
The fountains
Everywhere you turn on the Stanford campus,
there's a fountain. If you escape the red-shirted ori-
