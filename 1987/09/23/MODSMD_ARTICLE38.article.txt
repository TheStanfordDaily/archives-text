# San Francisco: highlights and hotspots
## 
### 
A Stanford education is incomplete without visit
ing some of the more popular tourist spots in the
City. Just remember: No matter how hot it gets
here, it's probably considerably cooler in San Fran
cisco, so dress warmly. And take a camera.
Alcatraz — Known as "The Rock," Alcatraz
claims most of its fame from the time that it was a
Devil's Island-style federal penitentiary that housed
such notable criminals as The Bird Man and A 1
Capone. The island also has been used as a fortifica
tion, a U.S. military prison, an Army disciplinary
barracks and a Native American stronghold. The
National Park Service conducts two-hour tours from
the waterfront, but be warned that this is one of the
City's most popular attractions and reservations are
hard to secure.
Cable Cars — Back in operation after an 18-
month hiatus three years ago. To many San Francis
cans, the cars are more than a means of transporta
tion: They're a way of life.
Bank of America World Headquarters — The

Bank of America complex, completed in 1969, oc
cupies an entire downtown block, complete with a
formal plaza dominated by a black granite sculpture
known locally as "The Banker's Heart." Thousands
of moviegoers witnessed an early demise of the
Bank of America building in the movie, "The Tow
ering Inferno."
California Palace of the Legion of Honor — The
Palace, perched close to Land's End in the western
part of the City, houses an extensive collection of
Rodin bronzes including "The Thinker."
The Cannery — A defunct Del Monte cannery
transformed into a galleria of shops and restaurants.
The Cannery continues the Ghirardelli tradition of
urban redevelopment. Mimes and musicians per
form regularly in the complex's square.
Chinatown — A Hong Kong native once
remarked that San Francisco's Chinatown reminded
him of home — the rush-hour traffic jams on the
main thoroughfare. Grant Avenue, rivaled any
bicycle or automobile tie-up a Chinese city could

muster. But Grant Avenue also offers a kaleidocope
of Asian delights: dim sum bars, restaurants, phar
macies displaying pickled snake, people inspecting
the Chinese cabbage in front of grocery stores while
pressed ducks hang in the windows. The streets
radiating out from Grant Avenue house one of the
largest Chinese populations outside of China and af
ford plenty of opportunities for exploring.
Civic Center — After the 1906 earthquake and
tire, the city planners wanted to remake the town
into a modern Athens. The Civic Center is only a
small part of the elaborate complex originally
planned. San Franciscans boast that City Hall, with
its ornamented dome, gargoyled finials and marble
balustrade, is the finest example of French
Romanesque architecture outside of Europe. The
elaborate federal and state office buildings, Civic
Auditorium, Brooks Exhibit Hall, the public library
and the Performing Arts Center echo this tradi
tional theme. The glass and concrete Louise M.
Davies Symphony Hall is a modern departure.

Telegraph Hill and Coit Tower — Telegraph Hill,
with its circuitous streets and cliff-hanging houses
has long been San Francisco's "Bohemian Section."
It has been inhabited by successive generations of
flower children, artists and literati. The upper area
around Coit Tower — a monument to the city's
early volunteer firefighters — has developed into a
patchwork of posh apartments.
Ferry building — In the days before rush-hour
traffic clogged the Bay and Golden Gate Bridges,
the ferry building annually processed more than 50
million commuters from the East Bay and Marin
County. Today the Bay Bridge obscures this monu
ment situated at the foot of Market Street. Al
though the Golden Gate Ferry operates out of its
south side, most of the building is now used as office
space.
Fisherman's Wharf — Salty fishermen, seagulls
and the pungent smell of freshly cleaned fish once
