# San Francisco: highlights and hotspots
## 
### 
A Stanford education is incomplete without visit
ing some of the more popular tourist spots in the
City. Just remember: No matter how hot it gets
here, it's probably considerably cooler in San Fran
cisco, so dress warmly. And take a camera.
Alcatraz — Known as "The Rock," Alcatraz
claims most of its fame from the time that it was a
Devil's Island-style federal penitentiary that housed
such notable criminals as The Bird Man and A 1
Capone. The island also has been used as a fortifica
tion, a U.S. military prison, an Army disciplinary
barracks and a Native American stronghold. The
National Park Service conducts two-hour tours from
the waterfront, but be warned that this is one of the
City's most popular attractions and reservations are
hard to secure.
Cable Cars — Back in operation after an 18-
month hiatus three years ago. To many San Francis
cans, the cars are more than a means of transporta
tion: They're a way of life.
Bank of America World Headquarters — The

Bank of America complex, completed in 1969, oc
cupies an entire downtown block, complete with a
formal plaza dominated by a black granite sculpture
known locally as "The Banker's Heart." Thousands
of moviegoers witnessed an early demise of the
Bank of America building in the movie, "The Tow
ering Inferno."
California Palace of the Legion of Honor — The
Palace, perched close to Land's End in the western
part of the City, houses an extensive collection of
Rodin bronzes including "The Thinker."
The Cannery — A defunct Del Monte cannery
transformed into a galleria of shops and restaurants.
The Cannery continues the Ghirardelli tradition of
urban redevelopment. Mimes and musicians per
form regularly in the complex's square.
Chinatown — A Hong Kong native once
remarked that San Francisco's Chinatown reminded
him of home — the rush-hour traffic jams on the
main thoroughfare. Grant Avenue, rivaled any
bicycle or automobile tie-up a Chinese city could

muster. But Grant Avenue also offers a kaleidocope
of Asian delights: dim sum bars, restaurants, phar
macies displaying pickled snake, people inspecting
the Chinese cabbage in front of grocery stores while
pressed ducks hang in the windows. The streets
radiating out from Grant Avenue house one of the
largest Chinese populations outside of China and af
ford plenty of opportunities for exploring.
Civic Center — After the 1906 earthquake and
tire, the city planners wanted to remake the town
into a modern Athens. The Civic Center is only a
small part of the elaborate complex originally
planned. San Franciscans boast that City Hall, with
its ornamented dome, gargoyled finials and marble
balustrade, is the finest example of French
Romanesque architecture outside of Europe. The
elaborate federal and state office buildings, Civic
Auditorium, Brooks Exhibit Hall, the public library
and the Performing Arts Center echo this tradi
tional theme. The glass and concrete Louise M.
Davies Symphony Hall is a modern departure.

Telegraph Hill and Coit Tower — Telegraph Hill,
with its circuitous streets and cliff-hanging houses
has long been San Francisco's "Bohemian Section."
It has been inhabited by successive generations of
flower children, artists and literati. The upper area
around Coit Tower — a monument to the city's
early volunteer firefighters — has developed into a
patchwork of posh apartments.
Ferry building — In the days before rush-hour
traffic clogged the Bay and Golden Gate Bridges,
the ferry building annually processed more than 50
million commuters from the East Bay and Marin
County. Today the Bay Bridge obscures this monu
ment situated at the foot of Market Street. Al
though the Golden Gate Ferry operates out of its
south side, most of the building is now used as office
space.
Fisherman's Wharf — Salty fishermen, seagulls
and the pungent smell of freshly cleaned fish once

dominated San Francisco's wharf.
Although the nearby slips still
berth trawlers, the surrounding
;wharf area has been taken over
*by wax museums, carnival rides
• fcnd tourist shops. Nearby,
owever, the 19th century
ship Balclutha harks
JJn>ack to the old days, and some of
- 4he City's best seafood restau
rants are still to be found along
£ihe Wharf.
<£ Fort Point — This three-tiered
M>rick fort at one time guarded the
jGolden Gate against invaders.
dwarfed by the Golden Gate
the building has become a

national historic site. Tours are
offered between 10 a.m. and 5
p. m.
The 49 Mile Drive — This half
day tour is a planned drive
through the most famous
landmarks of the City. An excel
lent introduction to San Fran
cisco, the route starts on Van
Ness Avenue at the Civic Center
and is clearly marked with blue
and white seagull signs.
George R. Moscone Convention
Center — A $126 million af
firmation that San Francisco is
indeed a tourist town. The site of
the 1984 Democratic National
Convention, Moscone Center
houses an exhibit hall, 41 meeting
rooms, a ballroom and a special
events theater. The facility is
named after the late mayor of San

Francisco, who was assassinated
in 1979 by then San Francisco Su
pervisor Dan White.
Ghirardelli Square — Here is
where 19th-century laborers once
made chocolate, packaged spices
and wove fine woolens. Today's
visitors to Ghirardelli Square now
browse in the Mustard Building,
watch street performers in the
plaza next to the Woolen Build
ing and buy Ghirardelli
(pronounced Gear-ar-dely) choc
olate in the old Chocolate Build
ing.
Golden Gate Bridge — Visitors
are often disappointed to discover
the bridge is not so-named be
cause the sun sets in the Golden
Gate. Unfortunately, the Gate is
often "socked in" by fog, to the
dismay of tourists dressed for

California sun.
Japan Town — Japan Center
and the revitalized Japan Town
join to create a Mecca for the
thousands of Japanese business
men and tourists who visit San
Francisco each year. The complex
of hotels, theaters, shops and res
taurants offer some of the best
saimen noodles and electronic
goods this side of the Pacific.
Ix>mbard Street — This twister
descends Russian Hill from Hyde
Street, with 10 hairpin turns in a
single block. Constructed, some
say, by a mischievous city plan
ner, the street now terrifies stu
dent drivers all over the city.
Mission Dolores — Junipero
Serra founded this missionary sta
tion in 1776 as part of Spain's
colonization effort in the New
World. During his lifetime, Serra
started a whole chain of missions
stretching along El Camino Real
— "the King's Highway" — all
the way to Baja, California.
Nob Hill — The exclusive
Commonwealth Club, the lavish
Fairmont Hotel, the Mark Hop
kins Hotel and apartments with
rents as spectacular as their views.
All of these attract San Fran
cisco's glitterati to Nob Hill, one
of the City's most elegant spots.
Old Mint — Though it was
phased out of operation in 1937,
the Old Mint was revamped and
reopened as a museum in 1973.
Its exhibits include period rooms,

a pyramid of gold bars, Old West
artifacts, the mint's Special Coins
and Metals Division and mone
tary treasures of all kinds.
Palace of Fine Arts — Con
structed for the 1915 Pacific Ex
position, a central rotunda
embracing a Corinthian col
onnade ornamented with friezes
and statuary consitute the Palace.
By the 1940s the original plaster
structures had been reduced to
ruins by winds sweeping through
the Golden Gate. During the
1960s a sentimental movement
mobilized to have the monument
restored in concrete. The sup
porting buildings now house the
Exploratorium, a "hands-on" sci
ence museuem.
Pier 39 — Pier 39 surrounds its
mall of shops and restaurants with
the trappings of a turn-of-the
century street scene. Built on a
1000-foot-long pier, the mall of
fers sweeping views of the Bay
and the City.
Polk Street — In the pre
supermarket era, this avenue
once supported a posh shopping
district catering to the well-to-do
residents of Russian Hill and Nob
Hill. Gay bars and counterculture
personalities have since sup
planted fur-coated housewives
and chic shops. Though the shops
have changed with the local tastes
and demands, many fashionable
boutiques and gourmet restau
rants still line Polk Street.

Transamerica Pyramid — The
tallest building in the San Fran
cisco skyline, the 48 stories of the
Pyramid slant skyward to form an
unusual "skysaving" wedge. This
design, a company symbol for the
Transamerica Corporation, and
the building's juxtaposition with
the low-rise Jackson Square,
caused considerable controversy.
Twin Peaks — A drinking
hangout Friday and Saturday
nights, Twin Peaks offers an in
toxicating vista of the Bay Area
from the Marin headlands to the
Santa Clara Valley. During the
day, a drive around the figure
eight road that collars the peaks is
an excellent way to get your
bearings on a first trip.
Union Square — This is San
Francisco's Fifth Avenue. Some
of the City's most swank shops
and hotels — Saks Fifth Avenue,
the Hotel St. Francis, Elizabeth
Arden's — front the square.
Washington Square — School
girls coming out of confession in
the adjacent Church of Saints
Peter and Paul, grandfathers
feeding the pigeons and hucksters
from the red-light district on the
nearby Broadway all circulate
through the piazza of San Fran
cisco's "Little Italy," the North
Beach District. Retreat to one of
the quaint cafes for a breather
(and excellent pasta), then visit
Washington Square to soak up
some of the local color.

pressed ducks hang in the windows. The streets
radiating out from Grant Avenue house one of the
largest Chinese populations outside of China and af
ford plenty of opportunities for exploring.
Civic Center — After the 1906 earthquake and
tire, the city planners wanted to remake the town
into a modern Athens. The Civic Center is only a
small part of the elaborate complex originally
planned. San Franciscans boast that City Hall, with
its ornamented dome, gargoyled finials and marble
balustrade, is the finest example of French
Romanesque architecture outside of Europe. The
elaborate federal and state office buildings, Civic
Auditorium, Brooks Exhibit Hall, the public library
and the Performing Arts Center echo this tradi
tional theme. The glass and concrete Louise M.
Davies Symphony Hall is a modern departure.

Telegraph Hill and Coit Tower — Telegraph Hill,
with its circuitous streets and cliff-hanging houses
has long been San Francisco's "Bohemian Section."
It has been inhabited by successive generations of
flower children, artists and literati. The upper area
around Coit Tower — a monument to the city's
early volunteer firefighters — has developed into a
patchwork of posh apartments.
Ferry building — In the days before rush-hour
traffic clogged the Bay and Golden Gate Bridges,
the ferry building annually processed more than 50
million commuters from the East Bay and Marin
County. Today the Bay Bridge obscures this monu
ment situated at the foot of Market Street. Al
though the Golden Gate Ferry operates out of its
south side, most of the building is now used as office
space.
Fisherman's Wharf — Salty fishermen, seagulls
and the pungent smell of freshly cleaned fish once

dominated San Francisco's wharf.
Although the nearby slips still
berth trawlers, the surrounding
;wharf area has been taken over

dwarfed by the Golden Gate
the building has become a

national historic site. Tours are
offered between 10 a.m. and 5
p. m.
The 49 Mile Drive — This half
day tour is a planned drive
through the most famous
landmarks of the City. An excel
lent introduction to San Fran
cisco, the route starts on Van
Ness Avenue at the Civic Center
and is clearly marked with blue
and white seagull signs.
George R. Moscone Convention
Center — A $126 million af
firmation that San Francisco is
indeed a tourist town. The site of
the 1984 Democratic National
Convention, Moscone Center
houses an exhibit hall, 41 meeting
rooms, a ballroom and a special
events theater. The facility is
named after the late mayor of San

Francisco, who was assassinated
in 1979 by then San Francisco Su
pervisor Dan White.
Ghirardelli Square — Here is
where 19th-century laborers once
made chocolate, packaged spices
and wove fine woolens. Today's
visitors to Ghirardelli Square now
browse in the Mustard Building,
watch street performers in the
plaza next to the Woolen Build
ing and buy Ghirardelli
(pronounced Gear-ar-dely) choc
olate in the old Chocolate Build
ing.
Golden Gate Bridge — Visitors
are often disappointed to discover
the bridge is not so-named be
cause the sun sets in the Golden
Gate. Unfortunately, the Gate is
often "socked in" by fog, to the
dismay of tourists dressed for

California sun.
Japan Town — Japan Center
and the revitalized Japan Town
join to create a Mecca for the
thousands of Japanese business
men and tourists who visit San
Francisco each year. The complex
of hotels, theaters, shops and res
taurants offer some of the best
saimen noodles and electronic
goods this side of the Pacific.
Ix>mbard Street — This twister
descends Russian Hill from Hyde
Street, with 10 hairpin turns in a
single block. Constructed, some
say, by a mischievous city plan
ner, the street now terrifies stu
dent drivers all over the city.
Mission Dolores — Junipero
Serra founded this missionary sta
tion in 1776 as part of Spain's
colonization effort in the New
World. During his lifetime, Serra
started a whole chain of missions
stretching along El Camino Real
— "the King's Highway" — all
the way to Baja, California.
Nob Hill — The exclusive
Commonwealth Club, the lavish
Fairmont Hotel, the Mark Hop
kins Hotel and apartments with
rents as spectacular as their views.
All of these attract San Fran
cisco's glitterati to Nob Hill, one
of the City's most elegant spots.
Old Mint — Though it was
phased out of operation in 1937,
the Old Mint was revamped and
reopened as a museum in 1973.
Its exhibits include period rooms,

a pyramid of gold bars, Old West
artifacts, the mint's Special Coins
and Metals Division and mone
tary treasures of all kinds.
Palace of Fine Arts — Con
structed for the 1915 Pacific Ex
position, a central rotunda
embracing a Corinthian col
onnade ornamented with friezes
and statuary consitute the Palace.
By the 1940s the original plaster
structures had been reduced to
ruins by winds sweeping through
the Golden Gate. During the
1960s a sentimental movement
mobilized to have the monument
restored in concrete. The sup
porting buildings now house the
Exploratorium, a "hands-on" sci
ence museuem.
Pier 39 — Pier 39 surrounds its
mall of shops and restaurants with
the trappings of a turn-of-the
century street scene. Built on a
1000-foot-long pier, the mall of
fers sweeping views of the Bay
and the City.
Polk Street — In the pre
supermarket era, this avenue
once supported a posh shopping
district catering to the well-to-do
residents of Russian Hill and Nob
Hill. Gay bars and counterculture
personalities have since sup
planted fur-coated housewives
and chic shops. Though the shops
have changed with the local tastes
and demands, many fashionable
boutiques and gourmet restau
rants still line Polk Street.

Transamerica Pyramid — The
tallest building in the San Fran
cisco skyline, the 48 stories of the
Pyramid slant skyward to form an
unusual "skysaving" wedge. This
design, a company symbol for the
Transamerica Corporation, and
the building's juxtaposition with
the low-rise Jackson Square,
caused considerable controversy.
Twin Peaks — A drinking
hangout Friday and Saturday
nights, Twin Peaks offers an in
toxicating vista of the Bay Area
from the Marin headlands to the
Santa Clara Valley. During the
day, a drive around the figure
eight road that collars the peaks is
an excellent way to get your
bearings on a first trip.
Union Square — This is San
Francisco's Fifth Avenue. Some
of the City's most swank shops
and hotels — Saks Fifth Avenue,
the Hotel St. Francis, Elizabeth
Arden's — front the square.
Washington Square — School
girls coming out of confession in
the adjacent Church of Saints
Peter and Paul, grandfathers
feeding the pigeons and hucksters
from the red-light district on the
nearby Broadway all circulate
through the piazza of San Fran
cisco's "Little Italy," the North
Beach District. Retreat to one of
the quaint cafes for a breather
(and excellent pasta), then visit
Washington Square to soak up
some of the local color.
A Stanford education is incomplete without visit
ing some of the more popular tourist spots in the
City. Just remember: No matter how hot it gets
here, it's probably considerably cooler in San Fran
cisco, so dress warmly. And take a camera.
Alcatraz — Known as "The Rock," Alcatraz
claims most of its fame from the time that it was a
Devil's Island-style federal penitentiary that housed
such notable criminals as The Bird Man and A 1
Capone. The island also has been used as a fortifica
tion, a U.S. military prison, an Army disciplinary
barracks and a Native American stronghold. The
National Park Service conducts two-hour tours from
the waterfront, but be warned that this is one of the
City's most popular attractions and reservations are
hard to secure.
Cable Cars — Back in operation after an 18-
month hiatus three years ago. To many San Francis
cans, the cars are more than a means of transporta
tion: They're a way of life.
Bank of America World Headquarters — The

Bank of America complex, completed in 1969, oc
cupies an entire downtown block, complete with a
formal plaza dominated by a black granite sculpture
known locally as "The Banker's Heart." Thousands
of moviegoers witnessed an early demise of the
Bank of America building in the movie, "The Tow
ering Inferno."
California Palace of the Legion of Honor — The
Palace, perched close to Land's End in the western
part of the City, houses an extensive collection of
Rodin bronzes including "The Thinker."
The Cannery — A defunct Del Monte cannery
transformed into a galleria of shops and restaurants.
The Cannery continues the Ghirardelli tradition of
urban redevelopment. Mimes and musicians per
form regularly in the complex's square.
Chinatown — A Hong Kong native once
remarked that San Francisco's Chinatown reminded
him of home — the rush-hour traffic jams on the
main thoroughfare. Grant Avenue, rivaled any
bicycle or automobile tie-up a Chinese city could

muster. But Grant Avenue also offers a kaleidocope
of Asian delights: dim sum bars, restaurants, phar
macies displaying pickled snake, people inspecting
the Chinese cabbage in front of grocery stores while
pressed ducks hang in the windows. The streets
radiating out from Grant Avenue house one of the

dwarfed by the Golden Gate
the building has become a

national historic site. Tours are
offered between 10 a.m. and 5
p. m.
The 49 Mile Drive — This half
day tour is a planned drive
through the most famous
landmarks of the City. An excel
lent introduction to San Fran
cisco, the route starts on Van
Ness Avenue at the Civic Center
and is clearly marked with blue
and white seagull signs.
George R. Moscone Convention
Center — A $126 million af
firmation that San Francisco is
indeed a tourist town. The site of
the 1984 Democratic National
Convention, Moscone Center
houses an exhibit hall, 41 meeting
rooms, a ballroom and a special
events theater. The facility is
named after the late mayor of San

Francisco, who was assassinated
in 1979 by then San Francisco Su
pervisor Dan White.
Ghirardelli Square — Here is
where 19th-century laborers once
made chocolate, packaged spices
and wove fine woolens. Today's
visitors to Ghirardelli Square now
browse in the Mustard Building,
watch street performers in the
plaza next to the Woolen Build
ing and buy Ghirardelli
(pronounced Gear-ar-dely) choc
olate in the old Chocolate Build
ing.
Golden Gate Bridge — Visitors
are often disappointed to discover
the bridge is not so-named be
cause the sun sets in the Golden
Gate. Unfortunately, the Gate is
often "socked in" by fog, to the
dismay of tourists dressed for

California sun.
Japan Town — Japan Center
and the revitalized Japan Town
join to create a Mecca for the
thousands of Japanese business
men and tourists who visit San
Francisco each year. The complex
of hotels, theaters, shops and res
taurants offer some of the best
saimen noodles and electronic
goods this side of the Pacific.
Ix>mbard Street — This twister
descends Russian Hill from Hyde
Street, with 10 hairpin turns in a
single block. Constructed, some
say, by a mischievous city plan
ner, the street now terrifies stu
dent drivers all over the city.
Mission Dolores — Junipero
Serra founded this missionary sta
tion in 1776 as part of Spain's
colonization effort in the New
World. During his lifetime, Serra
started a whole chain of missions
stretching along El Camino Real
— "the King's Highway" — all
the way to Baja, California.
Nob Hill — The exclusive
Commonwealth Club, the lavish
Fairmont Hotel, the Mark Hop
kins Hotel and apartments with
rents as spectacular as their views.
All of these attract San Fran
cisco's glitterati to Nob Hill, one
of the City's most elegant spots.
Old Mint — Though it was
phased out of operation in 1937,
the Old Mint was revamped and
reopened as a museum in 1973.
Its exhibits include period rooms,

a pyramid of gold bars, Old West
artifacts, the mint's Special Coins
and Metals Division and mone
tary treasures of all kinds.
Palace of Fine Arts — Con
structed for the 1915 Pacific Ex
position, a central rotunda
embracing a Corinthian col
onnade ornamented with friezes
and statuary consitute the Palace.
By the 1940s the original plaster
structures had been reduced to
ruins by winds sweeping through
the Golden Gate. During the
1960s a sentimental movement
mobilized to have the monument
restored in concrete. The sup
porting buildings now house the
Exploratorium, a "hands-on" sci
ence museuem.
Pier 39 — Pier 39 surrounds its
mall of shops and restaurants with
the trappings of a turn-of-the
century street scene. Built on a
1000-foot-long pier, the mall of
fers sweeping views of the Bay
and the City.
Polk Street — In the pre
supermarket era, this avenue
once supported a posh shopping
district catering to the well-to-do
residents of Russian Hill and Nob
Hill. Gay bars and counterculture
personalities have since sup
planted fur-coated housewives
and chic shops. Though the shops
have changed with the local tastes
and demands, many fashionable
boutiques and gourmet restau
rants still line Polk Street.

Transamerica Pyramid — The
tallest building in the San Fran
cisco skyline, the 48 stories of the
Pyramid slant skyward to form an
unusual "skysaving" wedge. This
design, a company symbol for the
Transamerica Corporation, and
the building's juxtaposition with
the low-rise Jackson Square,
caused considerable controversy.
Twin Peaks — A drinking
hangout Friday and Saturday
nights, Twin Peaks offers an in
toxicating vista of the Bay Area
from the Marin headlands to the
Santa Clara Valley. During the
day, a drive around the figure
eight road that collars the peaks is
an excellent way to get your
bearings on a first trip.
Union Square — This is San
Francisco's Fifth Avenue. Some
of the City's most swank shops
and hotels — Saks Fifth Avenue,
the Hotel St. Francis, Elizabeth
Arden's — front the square.
Washington Square — School
girls coming out of confession in
the adjacent Church of Saints
Peter and Paul, grandfathers
feeding the pigeons and hucksters
from the red-light district on the
nearby Broadway all circulate
through the piazza of San Fran
cisco's "Little Italy," the North
Beach District. Retreat to one of
the quaint cafes for a breather
(and excellent pasta), then visit
Washington Square to soak up
some of the local color.
