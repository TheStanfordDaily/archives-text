# How to get there
## From the Farm to the City: a fare assessment 
### 
•
As your imagination roams beyond the Farm and
even beyond Palo Alto, it often reaches northward
to San Francisco. The perfect day in the City forms
in your mind, but you quickly dismiss the idea, be
cause you, like many Stanford students, have no
wheels.
Suddenly San Francisco seems very far away,
much farther than when you were deciding whether
to come to Stanford and you read the pre
enrollment propaganda that said "San Francisco is
35 miles to the north and offers the urban pleasures
of theaters, galleries, restaurants and an extensive
shopping district."
If you feel your desire to travel north stifled by
your lack of a car, you'll be happy to know that
there are other inexpensive and relatively con
venient ways to get there.
The most easily accessible transportation to the
City is the SamTrans bus, which departs from the El
Camino Real bus stop across from the Stanford
Shopping Center. Although not the most scenic
route, SamTrans to the City costs only $1.50 each
way.
Buses begin the hourly trip to San Francisco at
5:17 a.m. on weekdays and at 6:32 a.m. on
weekends. After 8:37 a.m. buses run every half
hour until 6:07 p.m., when they return to hourly
departures. The last bus leaves Palo Alto at 12:05
a.m.
The travel time by bus is nearly twice that of
driving, but you can make the hour and one-half
ride pass more quickly if you share it with a book,
Walkman or friend. Be prepared to stand if you ride
during commuter hours.
When you arrive at the downtown stop of Eighth
and Mission (near the Civic Center) the City's aura

hits you, and the memory of the long bus ride
quickly fades.
Don't forget that the last bus back to Palo Alto
leaves from First and Mission at 12:49 a.m. and that
the south-bound buses stop at Seventh and Mission
instead of Eighth.
The Palo Alto-bound bound 7F buses leave from
where First and Mission every 30 minutes until 3:19
p.m., when they start leaving once every hour. At
5:45 p.m. departures return to 30 minute intervals.
If you really want to "get into" the Bay Area
commuting scene, you may want to consider taking
BART (Bay Area Rapid Transit) into the City. But
since the closest BART station to Stanford is in
Daly City, using BART First entails finding trans
portation to Daly City — about 20 miles north of
campus on Interstate 280.
Beginning at 6:00 a.m. the 5L SamTrans bus line
leaves the Palo Alto Southern Pacific railway station
every 20 to 30 minutes and stops at the Daly City
Bart station. The trip costs only 50 cents, but the
stop-and-go route takes about an hour and a half.
One practical advantage of using BART is that it
offers special bicycle permits, including temporary,
one-time passes. But because the bus does not allow
bikes, you need to hitch a ride with your bike to
Daly City.
BART, with its space-age appearance and auto
mation — replete with machines that sell tickets that
whiz through slots and magically open gates — is the
pride of the Bay Area. Well-lit signs make the 20-
minute ride From Daly City to downtown San Fran
cisco self-explanatory. The fares on BART are
reasonable, and vary according to your destination.
The seven downtown BART stations are all un
derground and centrally located: four along Market

Street, two on Mission Street and one near San
Francisco City College at Geneva and San Jose
Streets.
BART runs every 15 to 20 minutes from 6 a.m.
until midnight Monday through Saturday and trom
9 a.m. until midnight on Sundays.
If buses make you sick, or if you think BART is
too robotic, there is always the train. The CalTrain
leaves from the Southern Pacific Depot off Univer
sity Avenue — only a short bike ride from campus.
Don't forget to lock your bike securely before aban
doning it for the day, or you may end up walking
home.
The train is more expensive than SamTrans or
BART, but it tends to be more comfortable and
roomier. A one-way ticket costs 53.20, and round
trip fare is $4.80.
After a smattering of dawn departures, the
CalTrain schedule eases into what vaguely resemble
hourly departures from 8:26 a.m. until 10:26 p.m.,
with a few extra trips thrown in. The downtown San
Francisco stop is at Fourth and Townsend, tairly tar
from centers of interest, but along the city bus
routes.

The combined network of cable cars, the fnini
metro (streetcars) and regular buses make up; the
City's transportation system — better known as
MUNI.
MUNI can get you from the BART, CalTraiin or
SamTrans stops to within walking distance of
anywhere you want to go in the City. MUNI (ares
start at 75 cents, but if you ask for a transfer ticket
when you get on the bus, you can use the system for
another several hours without having to pay
Don't forget to bring exact change.
If you arrive by BART, remember to pick Up a
free bus transfer before you leave the station. S|ome
of MUNI's mini metro lines can be boarded under
ground, underneath the BART tracks, while the
other buses are on street level.
Whatever mode of transportation you choose, al
ways call to check fares and schedules before!you
leave. San Francisco is a lot of fun most of the ome,
but not when you're stuck there at 4 a.m. with no
way home. These numbers should keep you out of
that sort of trouble: SamTrans, 367-1500; BART,
788-BART; CalTrain, 323-6105; and MUNI, 673-
M UNI.
