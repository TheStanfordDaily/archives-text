# A 						guide to campus jargon
## Coming to terms with Stanford 
### 
"Yo dude, let's, like, blow off
the So Fo Po ho and hit the Co Po
for some fro yo, whaddya say?
Then we can hop in the Hoop or
go visit Joe at Go Co, unless he's
nerding out at Mem Chu again."
For those of you who are new
to campus and may have been as
saulted by a stream of monosyl
labic gibberish like the one above
only to be left wondering just
what sort of new and unusual
drugs the speaker had been ex
perimenting with, here's a trans
lation of the above quotation
from Stanfordese into English:
"Hey, don't you feel that we
should shirk our academic re
sponsibilities, put aside our Soviet
Foreign Policy homework and go
to the Corner Pocket for some
frozen yogurt? Then we might
feel inclined to go fountain
hopping in the Shumway Foun
tain near Green Library, which so
strongly resembles the rim of a
basketball hoop; or failing that,
we could visit Joe out at his
Governor's Corner residence, un
less he is spending Saturday night
in Memorial Church praying
again."
Stanford students have
developed a language of their
own to describe their campus and
life. Whether out of linguistic
laziness or a warped desire to be
hip, they reduce many words to
truncated one-syllable grunts.
Memorial Church becomes
"Mem Chu" and Memorial
Auditorium is "Mem Aud."

The Hoop near Green Library attracts students debating the merits of Co Po fro yo over Flo-Mo ice cream.
"Yo dude, let's, like, blow off
the So Fo Po ho and hit the Co Po
for some fro yo, whaddya say?
Then we can hop in the Hoop or
go visit Joe at Go Co, unless he's
nerding out at Mem Chu again."
For those of you who are new
to campus and may have been as
saulted by a stream of monosyl
labic gibberish like the one above
only to be left wondering just
what sort of new and unusual
drugs the speaker had been ex
perimenting with, here's a trans
lation of the above quotation
from Stanfordese into English:
"Hey, don't you feel that we
should shirk our academic re
sponsibilities, put aside our Soviet
Foreign Policy homework and go
to the Corner Pocket for some
frozen yogurt? Then we might
feel inclined to go fountain
hopping in the Shumway Foun
tain near Green Library, which so
strongly resembles the rim of a
basketball hoop; or failing that,
we could visit Joe out at his
Governor's Corner residence, un
less he is spending Saturday night
in Memorial Church praying
again."
Stanford students have
developed a language of their
own to describe their campus and
life. Whether out of linguistic
laziness or a warped desire to be
hip, they reduce many words to
truncated one-syllable grunts.
Memorial Church becomes
"Mem Chu" and Memorial
Auditorium is "Mem Aud."
