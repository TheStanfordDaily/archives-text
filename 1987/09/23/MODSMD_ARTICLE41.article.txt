# Taste the spirit of Napa Valley

If you're looking for a real California exper
ience this year, you might want to try wine tas
ting in Napa Valley. Beyond providing a slice
of California life, the winery tours are easily
accessible from Stanford and can be very in
formative.
Maps of Napa, which are helpful in plan
ning visits to the major wineries, are available
in most grocery and liquor stores. There are
over 140 wineries in Napa, most of which are
open to the pubic. So even without a map, you
shouldn't have trouble finding them.
Don't let the gourmet mystique of wine
tasting frighten you away. One day of tasting
is guaranteed to teach each visitor a working
jargon of catch phrases, as well as some true
pointers on how to distinguish fine (or not-so
fine) wines.
In every winery's tasting room there is gen
erally a list of wines being served that day.
The list is in the order that the wines are
served. Whites are served before reds, and dry
wines with very little residual sugar are served
before sweet wines. This way an earlier bou
quet will not cloud the flavor of the next wine.
There are four ways to evaluate the wines.
Each is very subjective and the value given
each criterion is up to you.
The first point is appearance. Does the wine
look good? Personally, I'm not very picky in

this category, I just like a white wine to look
different from water and a red wine to be very
dark.
The smell of the wine is referred to as its
"nose" and is the next step in evaluating a
wine. Some whites have very little smell, while
others smell like a bed of roses. 1 like mine
somewhere in between. Reds typically have a
strong, musty odor.
The entire process so far — evaluating the
appearance and nose — takes about 30
seconds. The next step is to taste the wine.
Everyone knows what he or she likes, so there
are no tips I can offer for this stage.
In general, however, people just starting to
develop an appreciation of wine tend to like
the sweeter white wines and gradually learn to
like dry whites and full-bodied reds.
After drinking the wine, consider the after
taste. Does a pleasant flavor linger or is there
the irresistable urge to pucker? The meaning
of each should be clear.
Almost all wineries offer free wine-tasting.
Only a few require the purchase of a glass.
Probably the best approach to an afternoon
of tasting is to find one or two wines that seem
pleasing and consistently try those types at
each winery. Even if a winery isn't serving
those wines, ask for them anyway — it is my
experience that they will probably serve them
to you. This way you can, by the end of a day,
be able to distinguish differences in each

winery's creation.
Many wineries offer tours that show each
step in the production of wine. Most have a
guide, but some tours are self-guided, which I
think are more interesting since the signs in
each room tend to give more detailed infor
mation than guides have time to provide.
The tours explain how grapes can be made
into either red or white wine. The process of
fermentation and the importance of when to
stop the process is outlined.
Just smelling the aroma of the wine that
permeates the walls and standing next to a
barrel of wine that's larger than most dorm
rooms makes each tour a treat.
As might be expected, food and lodging in
the Napa Valley are both plentiful and expen
sive. For those on a budget, taking bread,
cheese and cold cuts to the picnic grounds at
most wineries is a good idea.
If you are planning to spend the night, call
ahead to make reservations.
To get to Napa, take Highway 101 to the
Dumbarton Bridge and head north on Inter
state 880, which becomes Interstate 80. 1-80
intersects Highway 29, the main Napa
thoroughfare.
There are a lot of wineries worth visiting
right on Highway 29 north of Oakville. The
beauty of the drive through Napa Valley and
the free wine tasting will make the trip well
worth the effort.
