# Berkeley:
## Crazy Cal culture across the Bay 
### 
The streets of Berkeley, including Tele
< graph Avenue, the city's central thoroughfare,
, are painted with a certain amount of "human
jjicolor," some of it psychedelic.
For starters, up until a few years ago the
Man" could he seen virtually any day
parading through the Berkeley streets,
' dressed from head to toe in a vibrant shade of
112 scarlet, carrying on his back a stuffed puppet
the size of an infant.
C "Crazy William" is rumored to have been a
■'{ philosophy graduate student who "went over
t the edge." He painted his clothes and face
] with dollar-size red polka dots and took to
• camping out on Telegraph, making faces at
r people and drawing attention to himself any
t way he could.
"You have to be normal to stand out at
• Berkeley," many University of California
£ freshmen are told, and despite the large stu
j dent population, some undoubtedly find this
j the case.
; Berkeley is still a mecca for political dem
onstrators and activists. Few causes seem to
go unnoticed. Supporters of everything —
from the nuclear freeze to Nicaragua — estab
lish themselves in Sproul Plaza, the focal point
of the Cal campus. During the late morning
, and early afternoon, it is difficult to cross this
f'stretch of pavement without being asked to
{ sign any number of political petitions.
I; Although many of those new to the area
i may find this process intimidating, the
| majority of students tend to develop "defense
I tactics" to ward off the more adamant demon
strators. Clutching textbooks and notepads,

students can be seen with heads bent and eyes
focused firmly on the ground in front of them
as they stride quickly through a crowd of
petition-bearing activists.
The majority of those people often consid
ered "unusual" are generally harmless, pro
vided they are not provoked. Just to make
sure, residents offer visiting outsiders a safety
tip: Whatever you do or see, always avoid eye
contact!
For all their faults, there is at least one thing
Berkeley residents do right: make good food.
Since the arrival of Alice Waters, the owner of
the world-famous Chez Panisse restaurant,
Berkeley has blossomed with quality eateries
of every shape and ethnic origin.
Some claim Berkeley's good eats can be
traced to all those '60s radicals who realized at
some point that they had to make a living;
years of preparing organic food Finally came in
handy. Whether or not this is actually the
source of the local cuisine revolution, fresh in
gredients and an innovative attitude are com
mon to every respected restaurant in the area.
Even if you only stay in Berkeley long
enough to want to go home, you are going to
have to cat at some time.
If you want to risk going to one of the stu
dent hangouts, try Kip's or Larry Biake's,
both within a few blocks of Sproul Plaza. For a
student bar, check into Henry's or Spatz'.
Going out to breakfast has become an art in
the land of the Golden Bear. Places like
Bette's Ocean View Diner and the Buttercup
Bakery serve complete breakfasts with
various omelettes and high-quality pastries.

And, if you have the time to sit down, you
might try Ramona's, but remember that this
restaurant has no connections to its Palo Alto
namesake. The brunch menu features egg
specialties, including Eggs Benedict. The
omelettes are served with home fries and your
choice of bread or pastry. If you want authen
tic Chicago-style pizza and it's after 11:30
a.m., you're in luck. Ramona's has an original
recipe that is the restaurant's claim to fame.
Lunch and dinner open up a whole range of
possibilites. If you like Mexican food and
places with atmosphere, Carlos Murphy's is
conveniently located right off the freeway at
the Emeryville exit just as you approach
Berkeley. Carlos Murphy's has a beautiful
view of the Bay and San Francisco and takes
its name from its theme: it's an Irish Mexican
cafe. The decor and menu reflect this zany
idea. About one-third of the restaurant is
devoted to an extremely active bar.
King Tsin is possibly the oldest and most
successful of Berkeley's Chinese restaurants.
The same man has stood at the register for
years, and yes, he really does use an abacus on
the counter to check his addition. King Tsin is
on Solano Avenue among many other Eastern
restaurants. If you can't get a table right away,
you have plenty of other choices within
walking distance.
In the home city of Peets Coffee, cafes
abound. Cafe Roma, the old standby on Col
lege and Durant, is being challenged by the
up-and-coming Old Blue Cafe, which also
features dessert. There are outdoor tables at
both places, so you're never too far from the
Red Man and Crazy William.
