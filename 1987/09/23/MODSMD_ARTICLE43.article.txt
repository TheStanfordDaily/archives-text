# One reporter's quest
## The 						mystery of Stanford's disappearing lake 
### John Lee 
Every summer we lose it and every spring we get
it back. But where does Lake Lagunita go?
My mother always used to say to me whenever I
lost something, "Well, things don't just disappear. It
didn't just grow legs and walk away, now, did it?"
Mothers can be so helpful when they really don't
want to be.
But it's a good question, isn't it? Lake Lagunita
doesn't just disappear. So what happens to it?
In the springtime this little lake, located just be
hind Roble Hall, becomes a mecca for campus
windsurfers, sailors and sun worshippers. Sometime
in June, however, it begins to shrink. By fall it
becomes little more than a dusty bowl of dirt. Why
does this happen?
To uncover the answer to this question, I threw
on my trench coat and Bogart hat and took off to do
some investigative reporting.
1 found many students around campus simply ex
plain the lake's annual disappearance this way: "It
just dries up."
I couldn't be fooled that easily; there had to be
more to the story. My little voice was telling me that
this was a scandal. I began my search for answers by
calling University Information.
The operator suggested that I call University Op
erations, Maintenance and Utilities. OK, easy

enough.
When I called, I was told I needed to talk to Work
Control Supervisor Chonna Delaney, who wasn't in
that day. When I finally got in touch with Delaney,
she told me I needed to talk to Larry Andrews, who
is apparently water division superintendant for the
University.
I called Andrews and he told me that the person I
should talk to was Cheryl Jensen. At this point I was
ready to call it quits. I was all set to put away my pen
and notebook, grab my fishing pole and wander off
into the wilderness to fish for largemouth bass.
I decided, though, to give it one last try. Jensen,
who is manager of technical utilities, enlightened me
in my hour of darkness.
"After graduation," she said, "we open the outlet
and drain it."
That's it?
"That's it," Jensen said. "Very simple — the
water all goes away," she said.
That's all there is to it?
I had to press her for more information, and luck
ily 1 managed to get some.
"The water goes down the storm drain system,
meanders out through the arboretum and eventually
over the San Francisquito Creek and to the (San
Francisco) Bay," she said.


A few area high school students take advantage of Lake Lagunita's dry bed to do a little partying.
1 asked Jensen for information
about how the lake fills up
"Hopefully, the rains fill it up
each year," she said. "All the
water that falls in the Foothills
flows down, crosses Junipero
Serra (Boulevard) and goes into
the lake. This year we didn't have
very good rains and so we

pumped out of San Francisquito
Creek," she said.
I asked Jensen why they drain
the lake at all. Is it some sort of
plot to divert attention away from
bigger scandals?
Jensen crushed my hopes ot
uncovering Lagunita-gate. "It's
not a natural lake, it's a man
made lake. Therefore, it has no
natural inlet and no natural out
let, and the water does not flow
through. It becomes stagnant. If
we tried to keep it all year long,

we would have a stagnation prob
lem," she said.
Another problem is the fact
that it doesn't always rain. Jensen
explained that it would cost the
University a great deal of money
to maintain water in the lake all
year round.
Just before 1 hung up, Jensen
revealed to me the harsh reality
of Lake Lagunita. "Even if we
didn't open the drain, it would
eventually leak out or some of it
would evaporate off," she said.

it back. But where does Lake Lagunita go?
