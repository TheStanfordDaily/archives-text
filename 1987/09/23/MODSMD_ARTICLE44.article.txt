# Public service opportunities
## Reach out and help 
### Emma Sterland 
For all those community
minded folks out there, here's an
idea of how you can get involved
in public service now that you're
at Stanford.
The first place you should go if
you're interested in volunteer
work is Owen House, located be
tween Kresge Auditorium and
Campus Drive.
There you'll find the Stanford
Public Service Center, which of
fers a number of programs and
activities ranging from Adopting
a-Grandparent to fund-raising
bike rides across the country.
The Stanford Volunteer Network
The Volunteer Network or
ganizes a number of student-run
community projects involving
senior citizens, children, the
handicapped, the homeless, the
hungry and others.
Last year, for example, the net
work sent students from several
dorms to schools in East Palo

Alto and East Menlo Park where
they coached athletics for two
days a week.
A traditional event in the fall is
"Reach Out Today," in which
over 800 students spend a Satur
day doing community service with
others from their dorm. Last year
Branner Hall put on a Halloween
carnival for Stanford Children's
Hospital.
If you don't think your dorm is
getting involved enough, talk to
your community service repre
sentative (every dorm has one)
and suggest something your
house could be doing. The Volun
teer Network is equipped to pro
vide funds, support and informa
tion for students interested in
starting public service projects.
Several Volunteer Network
projects are already established
on campus, such as Adopt-a-
Grandparent, in which students
build a friendship with a senior
citizen, the Ecumenical Hunger
Program, which distributes food
to families in East Palo Alto, and
the Computer Literacy Project, in

which students teach seventh
and eighth-graders the basics of
computer programming.
If none of the above is quite
what you're looking for, call
Owen House and talk to one of
the Volunteer Network's student
directors.

Tutoring
Interested in tutoring? Talk to

House. She's in charge of the
Ravenswood-Stanford Tutoring
Program, which teams up
children in East Palo Alto and
Menlo Park with Stanford stu

You should be prepared to
make a commitment for six
months, but that's only to teach
one afternoon a week for a couple
of hours.
