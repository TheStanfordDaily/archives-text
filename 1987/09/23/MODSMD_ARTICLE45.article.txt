Your academic advisor may tell you to fill your
eight distribution requirements quickly, or you may
decide instead to delve immediately into your own
particular area of study.
But whatever classes you opt to take, don't over
look the courses on the following list. Most are uni
versally popular. All are unique and memorable.
Psychology 001: General Psychology. Philip Zim
bardo. I raditionally one of the most popular
courses on campus, this class is known for the pro
fessor's charisma, unusual lectures and use of
demonstrations. With Zimbardo at the lectern there
is rarely a dull moment.
Art 001: Introduction to Art. StafT. This topical in
troductory course is a popular fall quarter class. The
history and appreciation of architecture, sculpture
and painting are stressed. Students planning to en
roll in any other art history courses should plan to
take this one first.
History 172 A: America Since 1945. Barton
Bernstein. Prof. Bernstein is loved and hated, but is

always admired. A revisionist historian, Bernstein is
one of the best organized and most dynamic lectur
ers on campus. Just about everyone who has taken
this class considers it a favorite. Arrogant or not,
Bernstein certainly gets you thinking. Beware: The
reading is formidable and the grading even tougher.
And don't schedule a class right afterwards.
Bernstein tends to lecture overtime.
Political Science 35: International Politics. David
Holloway. For the ambitious student new to Stan
ford, this political science course is an excellent
choice. Taught for many years by the legendary
Stephen Krasner, this course examines world
politics through a variety of approaches, including
realism, idealism, Marxism and bureaucratic
politics. Holloway, formerly of the the University of
Edinburgh, will bring to the course his expertise on
the Soviet military. The reading load in Poli Sci 35 is
weighty and the grading is tough, but most students
say the work was definitely worth the time.
