# Hoover: a resource to reckon with
## 
### Monique Scheer 
Visually, Hoover Tower is the single most
easily identifiable building on the Stanford
campus. The ivory tower standing alone above
the trees, surrounded by bright blue sky and
fluffy white clouds, is no doubt a sight already
familiar to you.
For the incoming freshman. Hoover Tower
is an indispensible resource. It's a great
vantage point from which to find your way
around, and it provides a breathtaking view of
the campus and the surrounding foothills from
its observation platform on the fourteenth
floor.
What is not easily identifiable is exactly why
the tower is there. Actually, it's one of three
buildings that make up the Hoover Institution
on War, Revolution and Peace, a research
center founded in 1919 by one of Stanford's
most famous alumni, President Herbert
Hoover.
The Institution is the home of over 70 resi
dent scholars and houses the world's largest
collection of library and archival materials on
social, political and economic change since
World War I.
The conservative institution, and the con
troversy it generates gets a lot of attention not
only in this area but nationwide. If you ha
ven't already heard of the Institution, perhaps
you have heard of some of its fellows:
economists Milton Friedman and Martin An

derson, sociologist Thomas Sowell or physicist
Edward Teller, not to mention honorary fel
lows Alexander Solzhenitsyn and Ronald
Reagan.
As one of the nation's leading "think tanks"
— in the same league as the Brookings Insti
tution, the American Enterprise Institute and
the Heritage Foundation, to name a few
others — the Hoover Institution conducts a
broad range of public policy analysis.
The scholars study everything from Social
Security to Sovietology, and the outflow of
written material is constant and heavy. Keep
your eyes open next time you read the New
York Times, the Wall Street Journal or, more
locally, the San Francisco Chronicle and the
San Jose Mercury News. Chances are, you'll
read an editorial piece by a Hoover staff
member. Or, if you're interested in more in
depth analysis, check out the Stanford
Bookstore's stock of books from the Hoover
Press.
What distinguishes Hoover from most other
public policy think tanks, however, is its
massive library and archival collections. The
1.6 million volumes in the Hoover Library fill
the first nine floors of the tower (that's why
there aren't any windows), and the books are
organized into six major collections: Africa,
the Americas, East Asia, the Middle East,
Western Europe and the Soviet Union and
Eastern Europe. All these books are entered
in the computerized SOCR ATES card catalog

network that also includes Green, Meyer and
the other libraries on campus.
The archives contain over 32 million items,
some of which can be found nowhere else.
The very first issue of Pravda is there, as is the
diary of Hitler aide Joseph Goebbels. The li
brary and archives are open to all students and
faculty at Stanford. They also attract hundreds
of visitors each year.
The Hoover Institution is technically "an
independent entity within the frame of Stan
ford University." This arrangement has been
a source of conflict between the Institution
and those who believe the think tank's conser
vative slant compromises Stanford's academic
freedom. Some critics, who include both fac
ulty and students, have suggested that the In
stitution either be brought entirely under the
control of the University or else be severed
entirely from association with Stanford.
Several scholars hold joint appointments
with Hoover and the Stanford faculty. Junior
scholars are frequently involved in visiting
programs for a year or two.
Hoover is also unique in that it is one of
very few think tanks not found on the East
Coast. Despite the distance, however, Hoover
exerts a considerable influence on policy
makers in Washington.
You will undoubtedly encounter Hoover
many times during your years at Stanford, and
you will probably continue to hear about it
after you've left here.
