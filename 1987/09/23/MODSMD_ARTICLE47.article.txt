# Spice up your space with a loft; here's how
## 
### 
For the love of lofts and for those of you who
passed woodshop (do they still have that in high
school?): With the added benefit of making maxi
mum use of your undoubtedly too small University
housing quarters, here's a diversion of sorts for
craftsmen and homebodies.
In case you're not familiar with the term, lofts are
beds on stilts, so to speak. They may be very simple
structures designed to enhance storage space or or
they can be finely crafted pieces of furniture that
add a touch of class to your modest accomodations.
It shouldn't take too long to build one, really, and
then you'll have more space for other diversions like
yoga or a stereo system.
Lofts are actually a fairly recent phenomenon at
Stanford — only in the 10 years or so have they
become popular. The dorm that has the most lofts
by far is Toyon. Its cathedralesque ceilings tend to
give loftless residents a "closing-in-walls" feeling.
Lofts come in all shapes and sizes: single lofts for
one bed, double lofts for two, "L-shaped" lofts with
a mezzanine for studying and reading, split-level
lofts, and lofts with built-in bars, staircases and even
waterbeds.

If you don't want to spend the money to buy a
ready-made loft, it's not that difficult to build one
yourself. Lumber and tools are available from local
merchants, and tools like power saws and drills can
be rented.
"So how do I build a loft?" The basic ingredients
for a one-story, single bed loft are:
• A 4xB sheet of plywood at least 3/8-inch thick. Fi
ber board will also work, but it is heavy and cum
bersome.
• 4x4 posts cut to the desired height.
• 2x4 or 2x6 boards to support the plywood, and
Ix 4 or 2x4 boards to use as cross-bracing to prevent
sway.
• Joist hangers.
• Nails (or wood screws) and lag bolts.
• Carpet to finish off the platform.
The first thing to build is a frame to support the
platform.
There are two basic frames to choose from: A) a
frame of 2x4s with outside dimensions of 4xB ft., or
B) a 2x6 or 2xB outer frame with inside dimensions
4xB ft.
The advantage to frame B is that the plywood can

be set inside the outer frame; this leaves a rim
around the platform which not only keeps the
mattress from sliding off but precludes the use of
nails to anchor the plywood to the frame. This saves
set-up and tear-down time.
For both frames (A and B), cut the corners so the
shorter 2x4s fit inside the long ones. The nicest and
easiest way to secure the outside corners is to use lag
bolts.
At the end of the long board, drill two holes into
the face. Make the diameter of the holes smaller
than that of the bolt. Make sure the lag bolts are
long enough to extend into the end of the shorter
boards and provide a strong joint.
The next step for both A and B frames is to install
joists at 20-inch intervals to support the platform.
Be sure to leave at least four inches clear at each
end for the loft's legs.
Joists are usually 2x4s supported by joist hangers
anchored to the long boards of the frame. The joists
must provide a level surface for the plywood plat
form.
For a 2x4 outer frame (A), make sure the joist
hangers are nailed in so that the inner 2x4 joists will

fit flush with the top of the frame.
First, measure and mark position of the joist
hangers with a small 2x4 block Now cut the 2x4
joists to fit snugly within the outer frame, resting on
the joist hangers. As long as the corners are secure,
the joists need not be nailed.
On frames with top-flush joists (A), plywood
platforms must be nailed or screwed down. For a
loft with a wide outer frame (B), the plywood plat
form may be set on top of the joists inside the frame.
Next, the legs must be installed and braced. Use
4x4 posts. Set them inside the frame at the corners,
with the top of the posts on the same level as the
joists.
Drill holes for at least two lag bolts per leg, or use
at least four 16-inch penny nails.
Braces should run diagonally from the top of one
leg to the bottom of the opposite leg. From the long
side, use a 2x4 for the diagonal brace; on the ends, a
Ix 4 is fine.
If you want built-in shelves, cut a 2x4 or 2x6 to fit
between the legs and nail or bolt it in. This will also
give added support.

The next step for both A and B frames is to install
joists at 20-inch intervals to support the platform.
Be sure to leave at least four inches clear at each
end for the loft's legs.
Joists are usually 2x4s supported by joist hangers
anchored to the long boards of the frame. The joists
must provide a level surface for the plywood plat
form.
For a 2x4 outer frame (A), make sure the joist
hangers are nailed in so that the inner 2x4 joists will

fit flush with the top of the frame.
First, measure and mark position of the joist
hangers with a small 2x4 block Now cut the 2x4
joists to fit snugly within the outer frame, resting on
the joist hangers. As long as the corners are secure,
the joists need not be nailed.
On frames with top-flush joists (A), plywood
platforms must be nailed or screwed down. For a
loft with a wide outer frame (B), the plywood plat
form may be set on top of the joists inside the frame.
Next, the legs must be installed and braced. Use
4x4 posts. Set them inside the frame at the corners,
with the top of the posts on the same level as the
joists.
Drill holes for at least two lag bolts per leg, or use
at least four 16-inch penny nails.
Braces should run diagonally from the top of one
leg to the bottom of the opposite leg. From the long
side, use a 2x4 for the diagonal brace; on the ends, a
Ix 4 is fine.
If you want built-in shelves, cut a 2x4 or 2x6 to fit
between the legs and nail or bolt it in. This will also
give added support.
