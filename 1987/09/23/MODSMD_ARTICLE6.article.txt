# New class draws students from near and far
## 
### James Lin 
There is meaning to be found in
the pages of Incredible Hulk
comic books, if you're willing to
believe at least one member of
the class of 1991.
Required to write an essay
analyzing a quote, most appli
cants wrote essays discussing
quotes from Shakespeare, the Bi
ble and St. Augustine. Some,
however, chose more modern,
but equally famous sources, in
cluding Kurt Vonnegut and that
large green Marvel Comics hero.
The quote from the Hulkster
was "Victim of gamma radia
tion."
The abilities of this year's
freshman class, however, go
beyond a knack for choosing
meaningful essay topics. "There's
an enormously impressive range
of talent in this class," according
»r> Dean of Undergraduate Ad
missions Jean Fetter. Oil painters
and Olympic athletes have joined
mathematicians and actors to
form a 1529-member class culled
from an applicant pool of almost
17,000.
The Class of '91 reflects, in
part, the success of the second
year of Stanford's "extreme tal
ent" search, in which promising
students were targeted and audi
tioned in drama, dance, music
and art. The search also pin
pointed top talent in mathemat
ics.
The 864 men (56 percent) and
665 women of Stanford's centen
nial year class represent every
state except North Dakota, as
well as 28 toreign countries. Fet
ter said.

Californians continue to domi
nate the numbers, comprising 33
percent of the class, down,
however, from 38 percent in the
class of *90. A larger proportion
of students this year are entering
from the Mid-Atlantic states (13
percent) and New England (5
percent).

"Stanford's reputation nation
ally is increasing," Fetter said.
"Where we dropped in Califor
nia, we gained on the Eastern
Seaboard."
Of the 49 foreign students in
this year's incoming class, over 20
percent are from India. The next
most represented foreign country
is Canada.
Members of minority groups
constitute a full third of the Class
of '91, exceeding even last year's

landmark figures. Freshmen from
Black, Chicano or Native Ameri
can backgrounds make up 8 per
cent, 8 percent and I percent of
the class, respectively. Asian-
Americans make up 16 percent of
the incoming class.
A high proportion of the fresh
man class arriving on the Farm
this week chose Stanford over
other top-rated universities, in
cluding schools in the Ivy League.
According to Fetter, Harvard lost
more admitted students to Stan
ford this year than to any other
university.
Of the 40 percent of Stanford
admittees who went elsewhere,
Harvard was the top choice. Over
half are now starting at Harvard,
Princeton, Yale or the Massachu
setts Institute of Technology.
The 96 transfer students enter
ing this year represent just as elite
a pool as their freshman counter
parts. Stanford admitted only 8
percent of 1,457 transfer appli
cants. More than half of this
year's transfers had college CPAs
of 3.8 or higher at the schools
from which they applied.
Fetter said she was pleased
with the high caliber of students
in this year's class. "It's very ex
citing to see," she said. "As al
ways, we've been humbled by the
talents."
Fetter told the story of one ap
plicant this year who sent in an
original oil painting. The painting
portrayed the entire admissions
staff standing in front of Old Un
ion.
However, Fetter recalled, since
the painting had been drawn
based only on head-and-shoul
ders photographs, a 6-foot-8-inch

admissions officer found himself a
head shorter in the painting than
a 5-foot-4-inch colleague. "The
painting was beautifully done, hut
he had no idea of scale." Fetter
said.
Other submissions included a
giant box of Twinkies and a life
preserver on which "S.S. Stan

ford" had been misspelled.
There was, however, only "an
accidental correlation between
goodies and admission" this year,
Fetter added.
What other quotable sources
did this gifted group of freshmen
draw from for their application
essays? Vince Lombardi, Woody

Allen, Virgil, Chaucer and Bob
Dylan all found broad support in
the class of 1991, but ahead of all
of them and just after Shake
speare and the Bible came Ralph
Waldo Emerson.
The most frequently used
Emerson quote: I hate quota
tions."

"Stanford's reputation nation
ally is increasing," Fetter said.
"Where we dropped in Califor
nia, we gained on the Eastern
Seaboard."
Of the 49 foreign students in
this year's incoming class, over 20
percent are from India. The next
most represented foreign country
is Canada.
Members of minority groups
constitute a full third of the Class
of '91, exceeding even last year's

landmark figures. Freshmen from
Black, Chicano or Native Ameri
can backgrounds make up 8 per
cent, 8 percent and I percent of
the class, respectively. Asian-
Americans make up 16 percent of
the incoming class.
A high proportion of the fresh
man class arriving on the Farm
this week chose Stanford over
other top-rated universities, in
cluding schools in the Ivy League.
According to Fetter, Harvard lost
more admitted students to Stan
ford this year than to any other
university.
Of the 40 percent of Stanford
admittees who went elsewhere,
Harvard was the top choice. Over
half are now starting at Harvard,
Princeton, Yale or the Massachu
setts Institute of Technology.
The 96 transfer students enter
ing this year represent just as elite
a pool as their freshman counter
parts. Stanford admitted only 8
percent of 1,457 transfer appli
cants. More than half of this
year's transfers had college CPAs
of 3.8 or higher at the schools
from which they applied.
Fetter said she was pleased
with the high caliber of students
in this year's class. "It's very ex
citing to see," she said. "As al
ways, we've been humbled by the
talents."
Fetter told the story of one ap
plicant this year who sent in an
original oil painting. The painting
portrayed the entire admissions
staff standing in front of Old Un
ion.
However, Fetter recalled, since
the painting had been drawn
based only on head-and-shoul
ders photographs, a 6-foot-8-inch

admissions officer found himself a
head shorter in the painting than
a 5-foot-4-inch colleague. "The
painting was beautifully done, hut
he had no idea of scale." Fetter
said.
Other submissions included a
giant box of Twinkies and a life
preserver on which "S.S. Stan

ford" had been misspelled.
There was, however, only "an
accidental correlation between
goodies and admission" this year,
Fetter added.
What other quotable sources
did this gifted group of freshmen
draw from for their application
essays? Vince Lombardi, Woody

Allen, Virgil, Chaucer and Bob
Dylan all found broad support in
the class of 1991, but ahead of all
of them and just after Shake
speare and the Bible came Ralph
Waldo Emerson.
The most frequently used
Emerson quote: I hate quota
tions."
