# Centennial Campaign seeks $1.1 billion
## And you thought tuition was a lot of money 
### James Lin 
Stanford's Centennial Campaign effort to raise
$1.1 billion is running as scheduled, according to
University officials.
"We're right on target," said Director of Cam
paign Planning Richard Bennett. Stanford's five
year campaign, the largest in the history of higher
education, has already amassed $101 million since
its opening in February. This sum. combined with
the $307-million "nucleus fund" accumulated prior
to the official opening of the campaign, puts the
University past the one-third mark toward its fund
raising goal.
The campaign is part of a larger celebration
honoring the 100 th anniversary of Stanford's found
ing. "We see this as the most significant historical
milestone in an institution's history," said Stephen
Peeps, director of University relations.
The six-year celebration spans the centennial
dates of the signing of the University s Founding
Grant in 1885, the laying of its cornerstone two
years later and the arrival of the first freshman class
Oct. 1, 1891.
"It's a great spring-off point to project the fu
ture," Peeps said.
David Fulton, director of communications in the
Office of Development, expressed pleasure at the
current success of the campaign and cautious op
timism about its future.
"I think it's going well," he said. "(But) you're al
ways a little nervous about the economy."

Bennett agreed, adding that he felt the economy
had affected the campaign favorably so far. "It's al
ways nice when we have a buoyant stock market,"
he said.
"The things that would hurt a campaign are those
that are unsettling to people, like rampant inflation
or serious recession," he added. "We haven't had
any of that."
Peeps put the campaign into the context of the
entire centennial celebration. "If we celebrate our
past and our future well," he said, " it will shine well
on all of us, and encourage people to donate."
Almost half of the targeted $1.1 billion is slated
for what the University calls "current program sup
port," maintaining ongoing expenses for all of Stan
ford's programs and facilities.
The remaining $567 million, however, will fund a
series of "featured campaign objectives," which in
clude the creation of 100 endowed faculty chairs
and the complete renovation of science and engi
neering buildings in the Near West area of campus.
The campaign is divided into three major
categories: undergraduate education, science and
engineering facilities, and faculty and graduate stu
dent support. An additional $75 million has been
designated as unrestricted funding.
Also on the campaign agenda are the bolstering
of Stanford's financial aid programs, increased
graduate fellowship support, renovation of athletic
facilities and the building of a new dormitory for un
dergraduates.
The endowed professorships represent the high

est distinction awarded to faculty members at Stan
ford, according to English Prof. William Chace, who
serves as vice-provost for Academic Planning and
Development.
Chace said that the School of Humanities and
Sciences would claim about 40 of the planned

endowed positions, at least half of which would be
allocated to departments in the humanities. In
cluded in the total number are 12 Centennial
Professorships for faculty who will emphasize un-

Thousands of students, faculty and alumni gathered in the Inner Quad last May to celebrate the centennial
anniversary of the laying of the University's cornerstone. Scheduled to coincide with Stanford's 100 th
birthday, the University's Centennial Campaign is attempting to raise $1.1 billion.
dergraduate teaching during their
five-year terms.
"It's clear that the humanities
and fine arts and performing arts
are a particular priority in the
Centennial Campaign," said Ray
Bacchetti, University budget di
rector and vice-provost for man
agement.
Chace speculated that much of
the graduate fellowship funding
raised by the campaign would
also be used in departments in the
humanities.
The attention to the humanities
in the campaign comes in the
wake of observations that the nat
ural sciences and engineering at
Stanford often dominate the
public spotlight, and that half of
Stanford undergraduates major in
these fields.
"The humanities and social
sciences are much more discreet
in their position at Stanford,"

Dean of Undergraduate Admis
sions Jean Fetter said.
Chace cautioned, however, that
the professorships will be given
almost exclusively to members of
the faculty who are already full
professors at Stanford, and that
the establishment of the positions
did not hail a significant increase
in faculty size.
"It doesn't mean that 100 new
professors will be hired," he said,
adding that a small incremental
number of positions will be
created for the hiring of new fac
ulty.
Of the $80 million tagged for
Financial Aids at Stanford, $25
million will go to undergraduate
scholarships. Robert Huff, direc
tor of financial aids, said that in
spite of its size, the $25 million
represents the minimum amount
needed for continuation of Stan
ford's current undergraduate fi
nancial aid policies.
"My own personal hope is to
achieve more," Huff said. Huff
also said that changes in the

structure of individual aid pack
ages, such as a lowering of work
study or loan expectations, con
tinue to be unlikely in the imme
diate future.
"We're always concerned
about self-help expectations,
about the amounts of loans, and
about the ability of students to
participate in research and public
service affairs, both of which limit
the number of hours students
have available to work," Huff
said.
The 10 hours per week work
study expectations for Stanford
students on financial aid are mar
ginally higher than at similar uni
versities, Huff said. He added,
however, that the average Stan
ford student on aid works only
eight or nine hours per week, of
ten making up the difference in
summer earnings that often
exceed Stanford's expectations.
Bacchetti agreed that funds
from the campaign are unlikely to
be the cause of policy changes in
financial aid. "1 suspect that the

campaign doesn't have anything
to do with that," he said. Bac
chetti emphasized that the Uni
versity is committed to maintain
ing its current policy in order to
fully support all admitted under
graduates through need-based fi
nancial aid. He added that he
would nevertheless not be "at all
surprised" to see a reevaluation
of work-study or loan expecta
tions in the near future.
Also categorized under the
campaign's undergraduate educa
tion heading is a $20-million al
lotment for athletics and recrea
tional facilities. Topping the list
of priorities in this area is the
complete refurbishing and expan
sion of the Old Pavilion, Bac
chetti said.
Currently being used as office
space, the Old Pavilion will be
restored as a gymnasium, and a
field house will be constructed in
back.
Bacchetti said the importance
of the Old Pavilion as an athletic
facility lies primarily in its campus

location. "The Pavilion is syni
bolically and practically integra
ted into the central part of
campus," he said, adding that the
central location would preserve
the real integration of athletics
and academics for students on
campus.
Further renovations, which
may extend beyond the financial
reach of the Centennial Cam
paign, include the construction of
a new athletic complex, including
swimming and tennis facilities
west of Campus Drive, Bacchetti
said.
The third major spending cate
gory for undergraduate education
is $16 million for student
residences and residential educa
tion. About $12 million of this
sum will be used to fund the con
struction of a new student
residence complex, according to
Bennett.
The new residence, which will
house 400 to 500 students, is ex
pected to alleviate the current
housing shortage on campus,

Bacchetti said. "The goal, ulti
mately, is to guarantee four years
of (on-campus) housing," for un
dergraduates, he said.
While ground is already being
broken already for such projects
as the Center for the Study of
Language and Information and
the Gilbert Biology Building,
other programs and buildings,
such as a proposed $10-million
theater complex, remain in the
planning stages. Bennett said that
in spite of campaign priorities, the
determining factor with most
projects is the availability of
donors willing to give large sums
of money to the projects.
The largest contributions to the
campaign so far have been from
David and Lucille Packard, who
donated $70 million for the build
ing of the Stanford Children's
Hospital, and from William
Hewlett, whose $50-million con
tribution will support both the
Near West Campus renovations
and a matching fund for student
aid.
