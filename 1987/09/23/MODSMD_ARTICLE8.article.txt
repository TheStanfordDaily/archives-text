## Where to go when the going gets tough 
### 
Orientation Week can make life at
Stanford seem like a luxury cruise.
Breakfast at eight with your new friends,
fun in the sun and night life that lasts into
the wee hours of the morning.
When you catch on that no one at
Stanford calls anything hy its real name,
you feel like you have everything under
control.
But then classes begin. The first time
you go to the basement to wash your
clothes, you realize that someone out
there thinks three washing machines and
one working dryer are enough for 100
people. You come face to face with the
bitter truth. You have nothing clean to
wear and no one can do anything about
it. You're all alone.
It's true that when things quiet down at
Stanford, you're on your own. But don't
despair. There are plenty of people in
and around the University to give you

help when you need it. You just have to
ask.
Whether you go to talk to someone
about academic, health or personal con
cerns, you can find people who know
about the pressures you face.
Residential Education
One of the principal goals of Residen
tial Education is to give students a sup
portive, helpful environment in which to
study, live and conduct the other activi
ties that go with college life.
Although the resident assistants (RAs)
and resident fellows (RFs) in your dorm
may not know the answer to every ques
tion or problem you have, they probably
can point you in the right direction.
RAs are survivors of the freshman ex
perience who are there to be steady
"anchors" for you and your dormmates

as you go through your first year on the
Farm. RFs are faculty members who are
interested enough in the residential edu
cation process to live with students. Both
RAs and RFs are interested in you and if
you take the trouble to get to know them,
rewarding and lifelong friendships can be
formed.
RAs and RFs also act as liasons be
tween you and your academic advisors
during the first year. They may arrange
for your advisor to come to dinner regu
larly or plan other events.
Your relationship with your advisor
can be a good one if you cultivate it. Just
remember that your advisor isn't there to
plan your college career, but rather to
help you plan it.
Academic help
Although there are no dummies at

Stanford, at times the pace and rigor of
academic life on the Farm can get to be a
little too much. In some cases, the mere
process of changing from a big fish in a
small high school pond to a small fish in a
big university ocean is daunting.
So if you're worried about losing sleep
over your work, it's time to do something
about it.
Sweet Hall (between Meyer Library
and Stern Hall) is the place to start.
There you'll find the Center for Teach
ing and Learning (CTL), where you can
get tutoring in many subjects. The CTL
also provides academic peer counseling
and an accredited course to help you
develop good study skills.
Sweet Hall is also the home of the Un
dergraduate Advising Center, a
wondrously helpful group of people and
definitely the place to turn if your as

signed advisor just isn't meeting your
needs.
If it's papers that make you wish you
had gone to a community college, look to
the term paper advisory service at Meyer
Library and the tutorial center in the
English Department.
For those of you already concerned
about your post-Stanford future, the
Career Planning and Placement Center
(CPPC) can help you put together a
resume. It also has tips on job interview
techniques and provides career counsel
ing.
Taking care of your health
You know that no amount of academic
advising can help you when your head
aches and you have a hard time getting
