## Where to go when the going gets tough 
### 
Orientation Week can make life at
Stanford seem like a luxury cruise.
Breakfast at eight with your new friends,
fun in the sun and night life that lasts into
the wee hours of the morning.
When you catch on that no one at
Stanford calls anything hy its real name,
you feel like you have everything under
control.
But then classes begin. The first time
you go to the basement to wash your
clothes, you realize that someone out
there thinks three washing machines and
one working dryer are enough for 100
people. You come face to face with the
bitter truth. You have nothing clean to
wear and no one can do anything about
it. You're all alone.
It's true that when things quiet down at
Stanford, you're on your own. But don't
despair. There are plenty of people in
and around the University to give you

help when you need it. You just have to
ask.
Whether you go to talk to someone
about academic, health or personal con
cerns, you can find people who know
about the pressures you face.
Residential Education
One of the principal goals of Residen
tial Education is to give students a sup
portive, helpful environment in which to
study, live and conduct the other activi
ties that go with college life.
Although the resident assistants (RAs)
and resident fellows (RFs) in your dorm
may not know the answer to every ques
tion or problem you have, they probably
can point you in the right direction.
RAs are survivors of the freshman ex
perience who are there to be steady
"anchors" for you and your dormmates

as you go through your first year on the
Farm. RFs are faculty members who are
interested enough in the residential edu
cation process to live with students. Both
RAs and RFs are interested in you and if
you take the trouble to get to know them,
rewarding and lifelong friendships can be
formed.
RAs and RFs also act as liasons be
tween you and your academic advisors
during the first year. They may arrange
for your advisor to come to dinner regu
larly or plan other events.
Your relationship with your advisor
can be a good one if you cultivate it. Just
remember that your advisor isn't there to
plan your college career, but rather to
help you plan it.
Academic help
Although there are no dummies at

Stanford, at times the pace and rigor of
academic life on the Farm can get to be a
little too much. In some cases, the mere
process of changing from a big fish in a
small high school pond to a small fish in a
big university ocean is daunting.
So if you're worried about losing sleep
over your work, it's time to do something
about it.
Sweet Hall (between Meyer Library
and Stern Hall) is the place to start.
There you'll find the Center for Teach
ing and Learning (CTL), where you can
get tutoring in many subjects. The CTL
also provides academic peer counseling
and an accredited course to help you
develop good study skills.
Sweet Hall is also the home of the Un
dergraduate Advising Center, a
wondrously helpful group of people and
definitely the place to turn if your as

signed advisor just isn't meeting your
needs.
If it's papers that make you wish you
had gone to a community college, look to
the term paper advisory service at Meyer
Library and the tutorial center in the
English Department.
For those of you already concerned
about your post-Stanford future, the
Career Planning and Placement Center
(CPPC) can help you put together a
resume. It also has tips on job interview
techniques and provides career counsel
ing.
Taking care of your health
You know that no amount of academic
advising can help you when your head
aches and you have a hard time getting
up for your 1:15 p.m. class. For
tunately, the Cowell Student
Health Center is just a few
minutes' walk away.
If you can't walk, Find a friend
with a car or call Cowell's 24-
hour emergency number (723-
4861).
Cowell is open on an out
patient basis Monday through
Friday from 9 a.m. to noon and
from 1:30 to 5 p.m. It provides a
variety of medical services free of
charge to registered students. Its
physicians can make referrals to
specialists in the area for other
services.
Should you become one of the
many Stanford students who suc
cumb to the dreaded mono
nucleosis, Cowell has an in-house
infirmary with 100 beds. You can
stay there up to three months if
need be, and your friends can visit
you if they dare.
To note: mono at the beginning
of Dead Week does not mean the
death of your studies. Most pro
fessors are willing to make excep
tions if you show them the back of
your throat.
Another service at Cowell is
Contraceptive Peer Counseling
(CPC). Trained students willing
to answer your questions about
contraception staff this organiza
tion. They can also field questions
about pregnancy and its prob
lems. Should you need to con
sider an abortion, CPC and
Cowell can help you get informa
tion and can refer you to a local
physician.
Planned Parenthood has an of
fice in Palo Alto. The people
there go out of their way to make

you feel comfortable and to give
you the family planning informa
tion you need.
How about your head?
Sometimes, you may just need
to talk to someone. At the back of
Cowell is Counseling and Psycho
logical Services (CAPS). Here
you'll find professionals of all
ages and backgrounds willing to
help you get through a rough
spot.
The emphasis at CAPS is not
on long-term therapy. The aver
age student uses CAPS only three
or four times. But people at
CAPS will gladly refer you to
someone else in the Stanford area
if you feel you need a longer
counseling program. Counseling
at CAPS is free of charge.
Another counseling service
available to the Stanford commu
nity is The Bridge. This student
staffed organization is open five
days a week, and live-in staffers
take calls at night.
The students who work at The
Bridge are not professionals.
They see their job as one of lis
tening to people, not giving ad
vice.
When they do talk, nine times
out of 10 it's to say, "Well, how
do you feel about that?" It may
be routine, but counselors find it
a good question, giving you the
chance to talk out your concerns.
What some students want,
rather than formal counseling, is
to be around a group of people
who are sympathetic to their par
ticular interests and needs. The
Stanford Student Directory has a
listing of many special-interest
student groups on campus. The
Women's Center, the Gay and
Lesbian Alliance (GLAS) and the

Black Student Union (BSU) are
just a few.
What now?
If you need to know something
or if you need to talk to someone,

people are around to help you.
And there are a lot of fantastic
people around who don't have
proper titles or belong to
acronymmed organizations. You
may find that Stanford's greatest
resource is its students.

The students who staff The Bridge may pretend to see, hear and speak
no evil, but they'll gladly listen to any student's problems, evil or other
wise.

Your relationship with your advisor
can be a good one if you cultivate it. Just
remember that your advisor isn't there to
plan your college career, but rather to
help you plan it.
Academic help
Although there are no dummies at

Stanford, at times the pace and rigor of
academic life on the Farm can get to be a
little too much. In some cases, the mere
process of changing from a big fish in a
small high school pond to a small fish in a
big university ocean is daunting.
So if you're worried about losing sleep
over your work, it's time to do something
about it.
Sweet Hall (between Meyer Library
and Stern Hall) is the place to start.
There you'll find the Center for Teach
ing and Learning (CTL), where you can
get tutoring in many subjects. The CTL
also provides academic peer counseling
and an accredited course to help you
develop good study skills.
Sweet Hall is also the home of the Un
dergraduate Advising Center, a
wondrously helpful group of people and
definitely the place to turn if your as

signed advisor just isn't meeting your
needs.
If it's papers that make you wish you
had gone to a community college, look to
the term paper advisory service at Meyer
Library and the tutorial center in the
English Department.
For those of you already concerned
about your post-Stanford future, the
Career Planning and Placement Center
(CPPC) can help you put together a
resume. It also has tips on job interview
techniques and provides career counsel
ing.
Taking care of your health
You know that no amount of academic
advising can help you when your head
aches and you have a hard time getting
up for your 1:15 p.m. class. For
tunately, the Cowell Student
Health Center is just a few
minutes' walk away.
If you can't walk, Find a friend
with a car or call Cowell's 24-
hour emergency number (723-
4861).
Cowell is open on an out
patient basis Monday through
Friday from 9 a.m. to noon and
from 1:30 to 5 p.m. It provides a
variety of medical services free of
charge to registered students. Its
physicians can make referrals to
specialists in the area for other
services.
Should you become one of the
many Stanford students who suc
cumb to the dreaded mono
nucleosis, Cowell has an in-house
infirmary with 100 beds. You can
stay there up to three months if
need be, and your friends can visit
you if they dare.
To note: mono at the beginning
of Dead Week does not mean the
death of your studies. Most pro
fessors are willing to make excep
tions if you show them the back of
your throat.
Another service at Cowell is
Contraceptive Peer Counseling
(CPC). Trained students willing
to answer your questions about
contraception staff this organiza
tion. They can also field questions
about pregnancy and its prob
lems. Should you need to con
sider an abortion, CPC and
Cowell can help you get informa
tion and can refer you to a local
physician.
Planned Parenthood has an of
fice in Palo Alto. The people
there go out of their way to make

you feel comfortable and to give
you the family planning informa
tion you need.
How about your head?
Sometimes, you may just need
to talk to someone. At the back of
Cowell is Counseling and Psycho
logical Services (CAPS). Here
you'll find professionals of all
ages and backgrounds willing to
help you get through a rough
spot.
The emphasis at CAPS is not
on long-term therapy. The aver
age student uses CAPS only three
or four times. But people at
CAPS will gladly refer you to
someone else in the Stanford area
if you feel you need a longer
counseling program. Counseling
at CAPS is free of charge.
Another counseling service
available to the Stanford commu
nity is The Bridge. This student
staffed organization is open five
days a week, and live-in staffers
take calls at night.
The students who work at The
Bridge are not professionals.
They see their job as one of lis
tening to people, not giving ad
vice.
When they do talk, nine times
out of 10 it's to say, "Well, how
do you feel about that?" It may
be routine, but counselors find it
a good question, giving you the
chance to talk out your concerns.
What some students want,
rather than formal counseling, is
to be around a group of people
who are sympathetic to their par
ticular interests and needs. The
Stanford Student Directory has a
listing of many special-interest
student groups on campus. The
Women's Center, the Gay and
Lesbian Alliance (GLAS) and the

Black Student Union (BSU) are
just a few.
What now?
If you need to know something
or if you need to talk to someone,

people are around to help you.
And there are a lot of fantastic
people around who don't have
proper titles or belong to
acronymmed organizations. You
may find that Stanford's greatest
resource is its students.

The students who staff The Bridge may pretend to see, hear and speak
no evil, but they'll gladly listen to any student's problems, evil or other
wise.
Orientation Week can make life at
Stanford seem like a luxury cruise.
Breakfast at eight with your new friends,
fun in the sun and night life that lasts into
the wee hours of the morning.
When you catch on that no one at
Stanford calls anything hy its real name,
you feel like you have everything under
control.
But then classes begin. The first time
you go to the basement to wash your
clothes, you realize that someone out
there thinks three washing machines and
one working dryer are enough for 100
people. You come face to face with the
bitter truth. You have nothing clean to
wear and no one can do anything about
it. You're all alone.
It's true that when things quiet down at
Stanford, you're on your own. But don't
despair. There are plenty of people in
and around the University to give you

help when you need it. You just have to
ask.
Whether you go to talk to someone
about academic, health or personal con
cerns, you can find people who know
about the pressures you face.
Residential Education
One of the principal goals of Residen
tial Education is to give students a sup
portive, helpful environment in which to
study, live and conduct the other activi
ties that go with college life.
Although the resident assistants (RAs)
and resident fellows (RFs) in your dorm
may not know the answer to every ques
tion or problem you have, they probably
can point you in the right direction.
RAs are survivors of the freshman ex
perience who are there to be steady
"anchors" for you and your dormmates

as you go through your first year on the
Farm. RFs are faculty members who are
interested enough in the residential edu
cation process to live with students. Both
RAs and RFs are interested in you and if
you take the trouble to get to know them,
rewarding and lifelong friendships can be
formed.
RAs and RFs also act as liasons be
tween you and your academic advisors
during the first year. They may arrange
for your advisor to come to dinner regu
larly or plan other events.
Your relationship with your advisor
can be a good one if you cultivate it. Just
remember that your advisor isn't there to
