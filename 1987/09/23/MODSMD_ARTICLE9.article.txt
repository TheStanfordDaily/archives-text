# Safety and security

### 
Thefts, assaults and burglaries can become an unfortunate part
of your Stanford experience â€” if you're not careful.
A publication from the Special Services Unit of Stanford's De
partment of Public Safety can help you take the safe path through
your four years at the University.
"The Stanford Farm Almanac" is a compilation of previous
publications concerning safety and security on campus. Compiled
by the students who make up the Special Services Unit, the Al
manac contains information nn dialing 91 1 in emergencies, using
safety services like SURE escorts, engraving your valuables in
order to deter theft, dealing with peeping Toms and intruders in
the bathroom and securing your room before heading home for
vacation.
The booklet also contains a map of the safest routes to take while
walking or biking around campus.
Designed to be kept near the telephone for quick reference,
the Almanac is available at Old Union, Meyer and Green libra
ries and the Tresidder information desk.
Soon after becoming familiar with the Quad and the
Bookstore, Stanford students cannot help but meet up with the
knot of on-the-hour bike traffic at the clock tower and the nightly
mess of parked bikes at Green Library.
Bike thefts and bike accidents are also part of the Stanford ex
perience for many.
Another publication, titled "Better Bicycling at Stanford," and
produced by the University Bicycle Safety Committee and the
Department of Public Safety's Special Services Unit, details ways
to be safe while on your bike and to keep your bike safe when
you're off it.
Better Bicycling contains practical information that every
bike-riding Stanford resident should be familiar with, including
tips for dealing with safety hazards on campus, what to do if you
have an accident and where to park your bike (and where not to).
The book also includes pointers on how to protect your bike from
theft, as well as very useful information such as a listing of local
bike shops and instructions on how to fix a flat tire.

cial Services Unit at 723-9633.
