WHAT KIND OF FUTURE STANFORD?
During Fall Quarter Prof. Robert B. Textor will again he
offering the "Practicum in Ethnographic Futures Research
1" as Anthropology 269 A (69A for undergrads) and also as
Education 212 A. (See Catalog, p. 245.) The Practicum
provides intensive training in an interviewing approach
adapted from ethnography, and over the years has resulted in
Stanford students' sharing authorship of a number of
publications, e.g., Austria 2005: Projected Sociocultural
Effects of the Microelectronic Revolution.
This year (and last) our project deals with alternative
futures for Stanford itself. Our primary data sources are our
own professors and students, whom we have interviewed by
eliciting their scenarios concerning what the Stanford
"culture" can, might, should, or should not be like 25 years
from now. The response has been excellent: of the fifty
persons we have so far invited for interview, only one
professor and one student have declined and most
interviewees have given us more time than we have asked
for. In short, it is a friendly research situation, and should
produce results useful to the Stanford Community.
We have already written a preliminary draft of our
findings, and our further interviewing and library research
this quarter will serve to flesh out this draft. We will publish
our monograph in 1988. All student team members will be
listed as co-authors.
The course is open to juniors, seniors, and grad students
from any major. Previous interviewing experience is not
necessary. Flexible credit arrangements are possible. If you
are interested in Stanford futures, interview and write-up
methods, cultural interpretation, education, public policy,
and/or broadscale planning, you are welcome to find out
more about the course at our initial meeting on Wed., Sept.
30 at 7:00 PM in the Anthropology Department, Building
110, Room 111).
