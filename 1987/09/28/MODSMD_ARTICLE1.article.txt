# Law prof. might run for House
## McCloskey rules self out 
### Nick Anderson Staff writer 
Law Prof. Tom Campbell, at the urging of
prominent local Republicans, may challenge first
term Congressman Ernie Konnyu in next June's
Republican primary election, Campbell told The
Daily Thursday. Konnyu represents the 12th Con
gressional District, which includes Stanford.
Former 12th District Congressman Paul "Pete"
McCloskey, who said Sept. 14 that if he didn't find
someone to run against Konnyu he would do it him
self, ruled himself out of the race Thursday and
said he is backing Campbell.
Konnyu has come under criticism since pub
lished allegations appeared in early August suggest
ing that he had sexually harassed at least two
female members of his office staff and that he had
alienated the Republican leadership in the House of
Representatives.
Konnyu has been quoted as saying that he did
nothing wrong and that he was an early supporter
of the Equal Rights Amendment.
McCloskey, a Palo Alto attorney who
represented the 12th District from 1967 to 1982,
said "Campbell would make a superb candidate,"
and pledged to "support him all the way."
According to McCloskey, there is "an urgent
need'' to quickly find a strong candidate to face
Konnyu because of the "enormous difficulty" of
defeating a Republican incumbent.
"Somebody has got to start running right now,"
said McCloskey, adding, "We need someone who
is honest and competent'' and who would show
respect to women.
Campbell cautioned, however, that while he's
enthusiastic about the prospect of running, he is
still just "exploring the possiblities."
Konnyu said Friday he does not consider
Campbell a serious threat, citing Campbell's rela
tive anonymity in the district. "People don't elect
nobodies to Congress," he said.
Konnyu said that of the names recently men
tioned as possible opponents, only McCloskey
would make a tough opponent. McCloskey,
however, told The Daily Thursday that he would
not be a candidate despite a September 14 televi
sion interview in which he said he would oppose
Konnyu if no one else would.
In that interview McCloskey named several pos
sible candidates, including Campbell and Political
Science Prof. Condoleezza Rice.
Rice said she was "flattered" by McCloskey's
suggestion, but is "not interested at this time" and
may endorse Campbell if he becomes a candidate.
Campbell's criticism of Konnyu was largely
muted. Campbell said he would not comment on
the reports of Konnyu's improper conduct toward
women, choosing instead to underscore the posi
tive aspects of holding public office and criticize
Konnyu's record.
"1 subscribe to (University President) Don Ken
nedy's philosophy of public service: You can
make a difference.' I enjoy my academic work, but
1 feel an obligation to put my energy to work where
it is of most value," Campbell
said.
He said Konnyu is vulnerable
on several issues, including the
defense budget and foreign
policy. "There's nothing in Ernie
Konnyu's record to suggest that
he has ever put the defense
budget under scrutiny," said
Campbell. "That's a factor that
can't be ignored when we're
trying to cut the federal deficit.''
Campbell also said Konnyu
was "out of sync" with the 12th
District on foreign policy, though
he acknowledged that Konnyu
has shown "some flexibility''
recently on the issue of aid to the
Nicaraguan contras.
Konnyu said he now opposes
military funding for the contras
because of his recent fact-finding
trip to Central America, where
he and five other House mem
bers met with Salvadoran Presi
dent Jose Napoleon Duarte,
Costa Rican President Oscar
Arias Sanchez and contra
leaders. He said his new position
is "based on Duarte's accep
tance of the new regional peace
plan and Nicaragua's recent
democratization efforts."

But Konnyu added that his op
position to contra aid has "a
major caveat: If the Nicaraguan
communists violate the Gua
temala accords, all bets are off."
Konnyu reportedly angered
the House Republican leadership
after a name-calling incident on
the House floor June 25, in which
he improperly affronted 29-year
House member Silvio Conte (R-
Mass.), according to the San Jose

Mercury News.
Campbell, 35, has been a pro
fessor here since 1983 and
received tenure in June. He has
become known for his leadership
in the California Legal Reform
Project, an organization he co
founded in 1985 that is devoted to
eliminating excessive litigation.
He teaches public international
law, anti-trust law, transaction
law and international business

law. From 1981-83 he served un
der President Reagan as the di
rector of the Bureau of Competi
tion at the Federal Trade Com
mission.
Campbell testified Wednesday
before the Senate Judiciary Com
mittee at the confirmation
hearings of Supreme Court
nominee Judge Robert Bork in
defense of Bork's labor
management record.

defeating a Republican incumbent.
"Somebody has got to start running right now,"
said McCloskey, adding, "We need someone who
is honest and competent'' and who would show
respect to women.
Campbell cautioned, however, that while he's
enthusiastic about the prospect of running, he is
still just "exploring the possiblities."
Konnyu said Friday he does not consider
Campbell a serious threat, citing Campbell's rela
tive anonymity in the district. "People don't elect
nobodies to Congress," he said.
Konnyu said that of the names recently men
tioned as possible opponents, only McCloskey
would make a tough opponent. McCloskey,
however, told The Daily Thursday that he would
not be a candidate despite a September 14 televi
sion interview in which he said he would oppose
Konnyu if no one else would.
In that interview McCloskey named several pos
sible candidates, including Campbell and Political
Science Prof. Condoleezza Rice.
Rice said she was "flattered" by McCloskey's
suggestion, but is "not interested at this time" and
may endorse Campbell if he becomes a candidate.
Campbell's criticism of Konnyu was largely
muted. Campbell said he would not comment on
the reports of Konnyu's improper conduct toward
women, choosing instead to underscore the posi
tive aspects of holding public office and criticize
Konnyu's record.
"1 subscribe to (University President) Don Ken
nedy's philosophy of public service: You can
make a difference.' I enjoy my academic work, but
1 feel an obligation to put my energy to work where
it is of most value," Campbell
said.
He said Konnyu is vulnerable
on several issues, including the
defense budget and foreign
policy. "There's nothing in Ernie
Konnyu's record to suggest that
he has ever put the defense
budget under scrutiny," said
Campbell. "That's a factor that
can't be ignored when we're
trying to cut the federal deficit.''
Campbell also said Konnyu
was "out of sync" with the 12th
District on foreign policy, though
he acknowledged that Konnyu
has shown "some flexibility''
recently on the issue of aid to the
Nicaraguan contras.
Konnyu said he now opposes
military funding for the contras
because of his recent fact-finding
trip to Central America, where
he and five other House mem
bers met with Salvadoran Presi
dent Jose Napoleon Duarte,
Costa Rican President Oscar
Arias Sanchez and contra
leaders. He said his new position
is "based on Duarte's accep
tance of the new regional peace
plan and Nicaragua's recent
democratization efforts."

But Konnyu added that his op
position to contra aid has "a
major caveat: If the Nicaraguan
communists violate the Gua
temala accords, all bets are off."
Konnyu reportedly angered
the House Republican leadership
after a name-calling incident on
the House floor June 25, in which
he improperly affronted 29-year
House member Silvio Conte (R-
Mass.), according to the San Jose

Mercury News.
Campbell, 35, has been a pro
fessor here since 1983 and
received tenure in June. He has
become known for his leadership
in the California Legal Reform
Project, an organization he co
founded in 1985 that is devoted to
eliminating excessive litigation.
He teaches public international
law, anti-trust law, transaction
law and international business

law. From 1981-83 he served un
der President Reagan as the di
rector of the Bureau of Competi
tion at the Federal Trade Com
mission.
Campbell testified Wednesday
before the Senate Judiciary Com
mittee at the confirmation
hearings of Supreme Court
nominee Judge Robert Bork in
defense of Bork's labor
management record.
