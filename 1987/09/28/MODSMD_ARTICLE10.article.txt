# Deployment unacceptable
## Soviets: SDI would void pact 
### 
GENEVA â€” The Soviet Union
has proposed to the United
States that any agreement
reached on cuts in long-range
strategic nuclear weapons would
automatically lapse if either side
were to begin deploying defense
systems in outer space, it was
learned here at the nuclear arms
control talks.
The Soviets apparently are
pulling back somewhat from their
diplomatic effort to halt the U.S.
Strategic Defense Initiative pro
gram, popularly known as "Star
Wars," in its current stage of de
velopment and testing. But
sources here say that the new
Moscow proposal would shift the
focus to blocking any deploy
ment of an SDI system.
However, while this seems to
be the Soviet intention, sources
say that the wording of the new
proposals from Moscow is im
precise and open to conflicting
interpretation. A U.S. attempt to
clarify exactly what the Soviets
mean will therefore probably be
an important point of the next
meeting between Secretary of
State George Shultz and Soviet
Foreign Minister Eduard
Shevardnadze in Moscow,
scheduled to begin October 22.

The Soviet proposal, which
was submitted to the Americans
at the Shultz-Shevardnadze
meeting in Washington two
weeks ago, stipulates that a 50
percent cut in strategic nuclear
arms would he conditional on a
10-year extension of the 1972
Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty, and
at the end of that period the new
limits on strategic weapons on
both sides would automatically
lapse in the event of any excep
tional or decisive developments
or changes in the field of anti
ballistic missile defense.
The proposal does not spell out
precisely what the Soviets would
consider to be a "decisive
change" after 10 years that might
then, in effect, open up a new
race in strategic missiles. But
SDI deployment clearly would
fall in this category. The Soviets
also presumably will insist on a
"narrow interpretation" of the
1972 treaty, which would place
limits on the weapons-testing
phase of the SDI development
program.
These are the points that will
need to be clarified in Moscow.
Nevertheless there appears to be
sufficient signs of flexibility in
the new Soviet position to en

courage hopes that the outlines
of a deal on strategic weapons
could soon be reached to follow
the wrap-up of a treaty for elimi
nating intermediate-range nu
clear weapons worldwide.
President Reagan is already on
record as saying that the United
States would not proceed with
deployment of any strategic
defense system in outer space
without consultation with its
allies. He is also on the record
with an offer to share the benefits
of space technology with the So
viet Union and begin deployment
of any SDI system only if the two
sides were unable to reach any
cooperative agreement.
At the Washington meeting,
the American side was encour
aged by indications that the
Soviets are no longer pressing
their long-held position that SDI
development had to be confined
to "laboratory testing."
Nevertheless, if the two sides
were to agree to extend and abide
by the 1972 ABM treaty for 10
more years, they would also have
to agree on precisely how that
treaty is to be interpreted and
what its clauses mean. As a
starter, sources here said, would
this mean that the Soviet radar

installation being built at Kras-J
nagorsk in Siberia has to be
abandoned, or is it within the
terms of the 1972 treaty?
On the other hand, the sources
pointed out, the 1972 treaty per-i
mitted each side to build three
ballistic missile sites. But once
the treaty was signed the United
States decided that ABM sys
tems would not be cost effective
and that war could be prevented
through the deterrent threat of at
tack by massive strategic
missiles.
The sources said that the So
viet Union may now assume that
if they were to agree to a 50 per
cent missile cut, but link this to a
clause that would in effect ban
any deployment of space weap
ons, then the SDI development
will never go much beyond a test
ing phase anyway and will slowly
be abandoned by the United
States on the grounds of cost ef
fectiveness.
Meanwhile, the negotiators in
Geneva will be probing and
posing questions in the next three
weeks which they hope may then
be answered when Shultz goes to
Moscow.
