# Res Ed reversal: Synergy stays co-op
## 
### A.J. Thomas Editorial Staff 
The Office of Residential
Education announced in July
that Synergy will remain a co
op this year, reversing a May
decision to convert the
residence into a self-op.
Synergy residents will have
the option of doing their own
cooking or paying other resi
dents to cook and to clean the
kitchen. But unlike Stanford's
six other co-ops, University
custodians will clean the rest
of the house.
According to Director of the
Row Diana Conklin, Res Ed
accepted most of the iugges
tions put forward in a June
proposal submitted by Syn
ergy residents.
Laura Bonk, resident assis
tant at Synergy, called the de
cision a "very sound compro

mise. The University wanted
to make a change that wasn't
agreeable to everyone, and
now I think we have an
agreeable change."
Synergy residents Jon
Traugott and Eden Quainton
presented the proposal to Res
Ed. "We're happy. We got
most of the things we
wanted," Traugott said after
the decision was announced.
In May, the University an
nounced that Synergy would
become a self-op because it
failed to fill 14 of its 33 spaces
by the second round of the
Draw.
Again this year, Synergy
will have to fill 9() percent of
its spaces by the end of the
second round or face more
drastic changes, including the
possible revocation of its co
op status, according to Con
klin.
