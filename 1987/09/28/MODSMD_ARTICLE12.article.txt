# Humane Society stalls animal resarch facility
## 
### Susan Slusser Senior staff writer 
Construction of Stanford's Re
search Animal Facility II was
delayed late last month by the
Santa Clara County Board of Su
pervisors, pending the comple
tion of an environmental impact
report.
The board's August 28 deci
sion came in response to con
cerns raised by the Palo Alto
Humane Society, which charged
that potentially hazardous ge
netic research that might be per
formed in the building could
create a safety hazard for the
community. The University con
tends that no biohazardous re
search would be conducted at the
facility.
I he proposed facility, which

would replace 22,4(H) square feet
of aging facilities scattered
around campus with a modern
27,300-square-foot building, will
house primarily rats and mice.
The decision could cost the
University over $ 100,000 in con
tracting fees, plus the expense of
the report.
The Humane Society began its
battle against the facility by ap
pealing a land-use permit for con
struction that had been approved
unanimously by the Santa Clara
County Planning Commission in
May. The supervisors voted on
July 28 to delay final approval of
the land-use permit until the
Humane Society's concerns
were studied.
The earliest the supervisors
could consider the issue will be at
their Dec. 15 meeting.
