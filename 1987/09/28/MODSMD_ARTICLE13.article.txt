# SUMMER IN REVIEW
## Zeta Psi fraternity disbands 
### 
Members of the Stanford chapter of the
Zeta Psi fraternity voluntarily agreed in late
August to disband for five years in order to
"clear the air and provide a good atmosphere
for rebuilding."
The decision, announced Aug. 20, was
promptly accepted by Norm Robinson, then
acting dean of student affairs.
In an Aug. 13 letter to Robinson, Zete pres
ident Neil Hanson stated that "numbers are
down and morale is low after the events of
last April," alluding to the April 22 drowning
in Lake Lagunita of Zete member David Dun
shee following a Rush party at the Boat
house.
Hanson said the chapter hoped that dis
banding "would help ease the strained rela
tions between our organization and the ad
ministration . . . (and would) facilitate our ef
forts to work out a long-term mutual agree
ment for reinstatement of Zeta Psi on
campus."

Robinson said that after the five-year
hiatus the University "would accept from a
reconstituted Zeta Psi fraternity a petition for
housing."
A University investigation into Dunshee's
death found that the Zetes disregarded
several I nterfraternity Council (IFC)
guidelines during the party. Infractions in
cluded failing to check Rush cards, serving
alcohol after 11:30 p.m., failing to designate a
sober monitor and serving straight shots of
liquor.
A coroner's report showed that Dunshee
had a blood-alcohol level of .25 percent, two
and-a-half times the legal level in California.
In a June report of the investigation. Assis
tant to the Provost Michael Jackson recom
mended that the University revoke recogni
tion of the Zetes indefinitely.
Hanson's letter stated that the chapter did
not believe the IFC rule infractions contrib
uted to Dunshee's death. However, Hanson

acknowledged that "the most likely course of
action" for the University to take would have
been to revoke recognition of the fraternity
and said the Zetes believed it in their interest
"to comply voluntarily with this decision."
According to Robinson, there is a good
chance that the Zetes will be able to start up
again "without the burden of the baggage
they've been carrying around for the last few
years."
The Zetes, Stanford's oldest fraternity,
have been involved in several disputes with
University officials over the past six years.
In 1981 the fraternity was suspended for
three years and lost its housing after an inci
dent in which Zete pledges threw a Mills Col
lege woman into a shallow cement pond
during a party.
A month later, two pledges were found
bound and face-down, wearing only under
wear, in a stable.
