## Sites in Japan and S. America considered 
### Haru Connolly Staff writer 
The Stanford Overseas center narrowed
its choices for a South American campus
to Santiago, Chile and Buenos Aires, Ar
gentina, while also finalizing preparations
For a new overseas center in Kyoto,
Japan.
Thomas Heller, director of the Overseas
Studies Center, said the University has
some reservations about the Santiago site,
saying that unless substantial change
results from a plebiscite, or popular vote,
scheduled in Chile next year, Stanford
"would not feel comfortable in Chile."
The plebiscite will determine the rate at
which democracy may return to Chile,
Heller explained, adding that "there
would remain the question of whether the
military would seriously respond to (the
plebiscite) by 1989."
He said that currently, Santiago would
be an "unfavorable place for a Stanford
center" because of the repressive
measures imposed by Gen. Augusto
Pinochet, president of Chile since 1973.
"It would be a very beautiful thing for
Stanford to participate in Chile's transi
tions to democracy," he said.
While acknowledging past reDj.essjojis
in Argentina as well. Heller was more pos
itive about the Buenos Aires site. Hnere

is a very large concentration of cultural
and educational institutions in Buenos
Aires. The intellectual life of the country
has survived quite well," he said.
At either site, the South American cen
ter would offer courses in regional culture
and history, poverty, underdevelopment
and language studies.
To participate in the South American
program, students would be required to
have taken at least two quarters of
Spanish. Forty students, both undergradu
ate and graduate, would be housed at the
center, tentatively scheduled to open in
September, 1989.
While the opening of the South Ameri
can center is still at least two years away,
the Kyoto, Japan, center might open as
early as September, 1988, pending final
land negotiations.
In August, University officials dis
cussed the location of the campus with
private landowners and Kyoto govern
ment officials. At that time, Japanese ar
chitects prepared diagrams and models of
proposed buildings for the Overseas
Studies office, which Heller described as
"very elegant and spectacular."
The Kyoto Center in Japanese Studies,
administered by Stanford, will function as
a consortium of eight American univer
sities. Barring unforeseen delay, classes
will begin in the fall of 1988.
