Prof. Carolyn Lougee, who resigned from the
positions last spring to return to teaching.
Wasow spoke enthusiastically about his
new duties.
"Undergraduate education at Stanford is
very exciting. The possibility of being in a po
sition of effecting real change is also very ex
citing," he said.
Wasow is noted for developing the symbolic
systems program, which offers undergradu
ates an interdisciplinary major in computer
science, linguistics, philosophy and psychol
ogy-
During his three-year term, Wasow said he
intends to focus on improving student and fac

ness and academic success," he said. "It
seems that good grades are valued but
working hard to get them is not."
Wasow said he would like to see faculty
members "take the same interest in under
grads that they do in graduate students and re
search."
