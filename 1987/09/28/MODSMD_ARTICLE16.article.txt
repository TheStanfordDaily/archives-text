## The 						Stanford Daily An Independent Newspaper Editor's welcome 
### 
Stanford is a journalist's dream. With its
varied student body, extensive research
facilities and brilliant scholars, the University
community virtually brims with news and activ
ity.
As the only daily newspaper on campus, The
Daily has a special responsibility to probe, distill
and present that information to an unusually in
telligent and demanding readership.
Exhilarating as this task can sometimes be, it
is not an easy one. Staffed by students who must
juggle the demands of academics and social life
with the always-looming pressures of putting out
a paper, The Daily wages an ongoing fight to
cover the campus thoroughly and accurately.
This fall a new staff has moved into The
Daily's offices. From our predecessors we have
inherited you, our readers. Your respect,
however, is something we must earn for our
selves.
As in the past, we will make every effort to
ensure that what goes into the paper is as as fair
and complete as we can possibly make it. Often
we will succeed, and — yes — sometimes we
will do less well than we had hoped.
We will also be making a special effort this
volume to fill our pages with stories that not only
report on the campus community but also chal
lenge it. One of the marks of a good newspaper is
its ability not just to cover the news but also to
get ahead of it. The Daily's News and Inside
pages over the next few months will hopefully

show an added emphasis on in-depth and investi
gative reporting.
Also, we've made a few organizational and ad
ministrative changes that will, with a little luck,
make The Daily more efficient.
Goals like these are of course easier to set
than they are to meet. We'll do our best, but
your help is essential.
Instead of just grumbling when a story makes
you mad, write us a letter and let us know ex
actly what you think of the product we're putting
out.
Or better yet, come by the Daily office and get
involved yourself. Some of our staffers work as
little as once or twice a month, while others —
the true addicts — put in upwards of 40 hours a
week.
The energy and cameraderie of The Daily can
become addictive. Indeed, for many of us, The
Daily at times comes to seem even more impor
tant than the schooling we pay so much money
for each year.
We'll be working to make Volume 192 of The
Daily one you can truly be proud of.
Wish us luck.
