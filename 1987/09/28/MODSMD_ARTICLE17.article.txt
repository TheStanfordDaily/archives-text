Libraries archaic;
computerization
is long overdue
Stanford has modern comput
ing facilities. I was told at Orien
tation last year that Stanford's
facilities were five years ahead of
any other institution, though that
may have been an exaggeration.
With over 5.5 million books,
Stanford also has one of the larg
est academic library facilities in
the United States.
So we have Socrates, a com
puterized catalog with search ca
pabilities. Of course not every
item is listed in Socrates, nor is it
as modern as the Palo Alto Li
brary catalog system, which lists
the status of each book.
However, Socrates is sufficient

for looking up authors, titles,
subjects and the like.
I can't help wondering,
though, how these public libra
ries throughout the country have
better library computing facilities
than a major university five years
ahead of other institutions. What
institutions? Eighteenth century
monasteries?
In any case, why does one
have to fill out a card at Stanford
for each and every item to be
checked out? When I was check
ing out 12 books for some re
search I was doing, it took me 20
minutes to fill out the cards with
my name, address and phone
number and with each book's call
number, title, author, publication
date and so on. The 20 minutes
didn't bother me as much as the
fact that my hand ached by the
time I had filled out all those
cards. It is so much easier at the

public library, where you have a
card with your name and a bar
coded number to be read by a
scanner. Library items are
similarly encoded to improve
checkout and record-keeping
right on the computer.
Well, one shouldn't complain
about such inconveniences when
Stanford does provide wonderful
facilities on folio (free accounts
are available this year by filling
out a form at the privileges desk
at Green) such as housing infor
mation, bookstore holdings,
scholarship and fellowship list
ings, internship opportunities
and community service informa
tion. The only thing that bothers
me is the rumor that they may
start charging for this service
next year.
