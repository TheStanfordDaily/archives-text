## Contra aid cynical, thwarts peace 
### 
How Congress votes this fall will mean life
or death for thousands of Nicaraguan men,
women and children. The vote will also deter
mine whether or not the United States
becomes embroiled in an endless cycle of vio
lence in Central America.

President Reagan intends to ask Congress
for $270 million in aid to the contra rebels
fighting to overthrow the Nicaraguan govern
ment. U.S. military support for the contras is
opposed by a majority of Americans, by the
leaders of almost every Latin American
country and by all of Nicaragua's neighbors.
Further, U.S. aid would seriously un
dermine the Arias peace plan agreed to last
August by all of the Central American na
tions, including Nicaragua. The Nicaraguan
government has already begun implementing
the plan by appointing Cardinal Oblando y
Bravo, an outspoken opponent of the Sandi
nistas, to head a commission to oversee the
lifting of the state of emergency. The opposi
tion newspaper La Prensa, which was shut
down by the government in 1984 for accept
ing CIA funds and supporting the contras,
will be allowed to resume publishing — free
of censorship — October 1. The Sandinistas
have also declared a partial cease-fire and of
fered amnesty to contra soldiers who lay
down their arms.
These are extraordinary concessions by a
country under armed attack. During World
War II when the United States — unlike
Nicaragua today — was in no danger of inva
sion, an American publisher who accepted
funds from Germany or Japan would have

been jailed. More than 100,000 American
citizens were interned behind barbed wire
simply because of their Japanese ancestry.
During the Vietnam War it was illegal to adv
ocate violating draft law. How would the
U.S. government react today if an enemy
army, organized and financed by a foreign
power, were making regular and devastating
raids across our borders?
According to President Reagan,
Nicaragua's leaders have created "a
totalitarian Marxist-Leninist dictatorship to
satisfy their own personal lust for power and
to give the Soviet Union a beachead on this
continent ... a clear national security
threat." Reagan insists that the United States
must "press for true democracy by support
ing those fighting for it."
But neither concern for democracy nor fear
of a Soviet base is the real issue. The Sandi
nistas have long been willing to ban foreign
bases and accept the policing of their bor
ders. According to Thad Sulcz of the New
York Times, Nicaragua is not "an inviting
strategic investment for the Russians," who
recently cut back sharply on oil shipments to
the Nicaraguans. In any case, Nicaragua is
hardly a "Marxist-Leninist" showcase, with
more than 60 percent of the economy in
private hands.
Despite his rhetoric about democracy,
Reagan and his far-right supporters opposed
the revolution against former dictator Anas
tasio Somoza from the beginning, even
though the 50-year U.S.-backed reign of the
Somoza family was one of the most corrupt
and brutal in the Western Hemisphere. En
rique Bermudez, the contras' military com
mander, and many of his officers were high
officials in the Somoza regime. It is ludicrous
to think that their continued terrorist assaults
on farm cooperatives, health clinics and rural

villages, which have already caused 19,000
deaths, will bring about what Reagan calls "a
free, pluralistic, constitutional democracy."
The real intent of the Reagan administra
tion is to bleed the people of Nicaragua until
the Sandinista government is either over
thrown or collapses. For this reason the ad
ministration has thwarted every peace initia
tive so far, using tactics described in a 1984
memo by Vice Admiral John Poindexter:
"Continue active negotiations, but agree on
nothing and try to work out some way to sup
port the contras, either directly or indirectly.
Withhold true objectives from staff." Every
administration official who took the idea of
negotiations seriously was forced to resign.
Nicaragua's crime was to declare an end to
more than 80 years of U.S. domination and
attempt to change the patterns of economic,
political and military power that for so long
had kept Nicaraguans in grinding poverty and
subjection. Since 1981 the Nicaraguan exper
iment has been handicapped by U.S.-
sponsored military attacks, sabotage and eco
nomic boycotts, although there have been
dramatic improvements in literacy and health
care.
Whether the revolution can fully succeed is
still an open question. But a more relevant
question is: What right does the United
States have to tell another sovereign country
how to run its internal affairs? The Interna
tional Court of Justice has declared U.S. mili
tary intervention in Nicaragua to be a viola
tion of international law. To continue that in
tervention by sending more aid to the contras
would compound the damage already done
by blasting hopes for peace and condemning
one of the poorest regions of the world to yet
another round of bloodshed.
