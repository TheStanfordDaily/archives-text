## Technology not enough 
### 
I almost died this year. Despite all of its
wonders, modern medical technology nearly
allowed a ruptured appendix to kill me.
Last January 1 developed stomach pains. Soon
they became so intolerable that even codeine gave
me no relief. The pain was diffused throughout my
abdomen; it was sharp and constant. Food and
water caused me to vomit. I had severe chills and a
high fever. Within a few days I developed a second
pain in my lower back.

I checked into a university hospital. During my
first two weeks there, 1 received a staggering num
ber of tests. I literally had dozens of blood tests and
X-rays. I also had an MRI-scan, two CAT-scans,
an endoscopy, a barium enema, an upper GI series,
two ultrasounds, a bone scan and a white blood cell
scan.
Each morning, my doctors ordered another test.
Each afternoon, they returned to tell me that the
day's test had revealed nothing as to the cause of
my pain, 104-degree fever and elevated white blood
cell count. I was dying. But I received no treatment
whatsoever.
It was only during an abortive bowel resection
that my surgeon found the real cause of my misery:
a ruptured retrocecal appendix. My doctors had
not detected it for four weeks.
Now that many months have passed since my
recovery, 1 have a more objective understanding of
my illness. 1 recall that the tests themselves causcd
some of my worst misery. I was subjected to a
painful barium enema when my resistance to pain
and discomfort was already unacceptably low.
After my system had not been able to handle oral
fluid intake for almost two weeks, I had to swallow
a gallon of barium-laced "lemonade" for my CAT
scan. And since I was already depressed and prone
to fits of crying, I had no ability to fight the
claustrophobia that seemed inevitable in the closed
barrel of an MRI-scanner; my time in that tube was
the worst hour of my life. Though 1 was in absolute
agony as I lay alone in my hospital room, it was the
barrage of torturous procedures that pushed me to
the point of complete hysteria.
Modern medicine and technology go hand-in
hand. Nobody can deny that such technological ad

vances as the CAT-scanner and MRI-scanner have
revolutionized medicine and accordingly have im
proved the entire human condition. But with all
technology there is the risk of dehumanization: In
this case I became a folder full of X-rays and CAT
scans and not a 20-year old squirming in pain. My
doctors were impotent, it seemed to me, because
they were not examining me so much as they were
examining pictures of me. My pain and discomfort
were actually being increased all the while.
Today's doctors must remember to look to the
patient first and to computer printouts second.
Medicine is an inexact science. How can comput
ers and scanners be expected always to provide
precise answers to questions that are inherently in
exact? The physician is necessary in any diagnosis.
It is therefore up to modern doctors to fight the ten
dency to allow their patients to become buried
beneath films and printouts.
While I was sick, my father outlined my case to a
physician with whom he had worked many years
ago. This doctor is an old man now; he no longer
practices. But he is from a generation of doctors
who had to rely on their medical intellect and savvy
to make diagnoses. "Your son," he told my dad,
"has a ruptured appendix."
When my father told my doctors about the older
physician's opinion, they simply responded that
none of my tests had shown a ruptured appendix.
As a pre-medical college student who became a
patient in a teaching hospital, I gained great respecf
for the medical training process. To this patient it
seemed that the purpose of a medical education
was to hone young doctors' medical intellects and
instincts. But unfortunately, the ideals reflected in
this process were frequently violated in practice.
There was too often a quixotic attempt to find a
wonder-scanner that would instantly reveal all of
the answers to my problem. In the end this attitude
almost killed me. Moreover, it was extremely ex
pensive.
Today's physicians have an obligation to try to
better integrate high technology into their diagnos
tic processes. They can save the patient duress and
money and time by ordering only those tests that
they feel actually have a chance of giving insight
into the problem. In legal jargon, they should send
their patient to the radiology suite when they have
"probable cause."
Technology alone, no matter how advanced,
simply cannot provide all of the answers.
