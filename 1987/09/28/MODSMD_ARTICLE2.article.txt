# Asbestos cleanup in Lag nearly done
## 
### Jerilyn Lopez Mendoza 
The isolation and removal of
asbestos found in the base
ment of Lagunita Court in late
August is scheduled to be
completed tomorrow, Univer
sity officials said yesterday.
According to Asst. Provost
John Hughes, the asbestos
was "non-friable," or not dan
gerous unless disturbed. He
said that past and present resi
dents are not in danger of de
veloping cancer.
Hughes said removing the
asbestos will cost the Univer
sity "hundreds of thousands
of dollars."
The project has caused
many students considerable
incovenience. Lagunita resi
dents and other students who
were at Stanford overseas
campuses in the spring have
been unable to remove their
belongings from basement
storage rooms. Lagunita resi
dent assistants and theme as

sociates were unable to move
into their rooms and were
forced to stay in Roble Hall
during the RA training ses
sions held over the past two
weeks.
"It's better to be incon
venienced than have lung can
cer," sophomore Mary Dillard
said of the situation.
Hughes acknowledged that
"every dorm and almost every
building on campus has as
bestos" but said there is no
cause for alarm.
"Almost all of it is non
friable and presents no danger
to students," Hughes said,
adding that potentially danger
ous asbestos is present in
some buildings, but that it is
all in good condition and being
monitored.
The process of isolation and
removal, or "abatement," of
asbestos in Lagunita began
last month when contractors
working on the dormitory's
wiring system realized that their
work would damage pipe insula
tion containing asbestos and
release carcinogenic fibers into
the air.
Hughes said the situation in
Lagunita was not an emergency
but that Lagunita was high on the
list of buildings scheduled for as
bestos abatement. The project
would have been initiated this ac
ademic year even if the electrical
work had not been necessary, he
said.
About two-and-a-half years
ago, the University commis
sioned an external study to iden
tify the location of asbestos in ac
ademic and residential buildings
and evaluate its potential danger.
Since then, a number of aca
demic buildings in the Quad, in
cluding the Mathematics Build
ing, have been abated.
Asbestos is a building material
composed of many different
minerals that was used in con
struction from the 1930s to the

mid-19705. As it does not burn, it
was used extensively for
fireproofing. About 1976, it was
discovered that prolonged expo
sure to asbestos fibers could
cause cancer, and spray-on as
bestos was banned by the Envi
ronmental Protection Agency.
According to Hughes, strin
gent safety precautions have
been taken while removing the
asbestos from Lagunita. Curt
Williams, director of Facilities
Project Management, said the
abatement procedure includes
double-containing the affected
area with plastic layers, provid
ing workers with special suits,
breathing apparatus and
showers, and using specially
made bags to carry away the dan
gerous material.
Air samples taken before the
abatement began show that the
fiber concentration level was
below the Universtiy's maximum
allowable control level. Samples
were also taken during the abate
ment process, and the level con
tinued to stay below the maxi
mum limit.
The University's maximum
level of .01 fibers per cubic centi
meter is well below the federal
limit of . 1 fibers per cubic centi
meter.
