# Asbestos cleanup in Lag nearly done

### Jerilyn Lopez Mendoza 
The isolation and removal of
asbestos found in the base
ment of Lagunita Court in late
August is scheduled to be
completed tomorrow, Univer
sity officials said yesterday.
According to Asst. Provost
John Hughes, the asbestos
was "non-friable," or not dan
gerous unless disturbed. He
said that past and present resi
dents are not in danger of de
veloping cancer.
Hughes said removing the
asbestos will cost the Univer
sity "hundreds of thousands
of dollars."
The project has caused
many students considerable
incovenience. Lagunita resi
dents and other students who
were at Stanford overseas
campuses in the spring have
been unable to remove their
belongings from basement
storage rooms. Lagunita resi
dent assistants and theme as

sociates were unable to move
into their rooms and were
forced to stay in Roble Hall
during the RA training ses
sions held over the past two
weeks.
"It's better to be incon
venienced than have lung can
cer," sophomore Mary Dillard
said of the situation.
Hughes acknowledged that
"every dorm and almost every
building on campus has as
bestos" but said there is no
cause for alarm.
"Almost all of it is non
friable and presents no danger
to students," Hughes said,
adding that potentially danger
ous asbestos is present in
some buildings, but that it is
all in good condition and being
monitored.
The process of isolation and
removal, or "abatement," of
asbestos in Lagunita began
