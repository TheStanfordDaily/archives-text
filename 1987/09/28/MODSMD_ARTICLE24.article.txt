## Ethnicity is focus of Orientation 
### Alicia Kent Staff writer 
"Murphy's Law for Freshman
Orientation is that everyone with
a refrigerator or really heavy
boxes always lives on the third
floor," orientation volunteer
Lisa Hulber said after a day
spent moving freshmen into their
various residences.
Moving boxes, calming par
ents and running parties are all
yearly recurrences for Orienta
tion participants.
But some traditions in Fresh
man Orientation are changing to
better welcome the Class of 1991
by embracing its diversity. These
changes include greater efforts to
welcome international students
and an increased attention to eth
nic orientation.
* Because this year's freshman
class is one-third minority stu
dents, one of the major topics of
Orientation '87 is ethnicity.
Black and Chicano students each
Constitute eight percent of the in
coming class, Native Americans
one percent and Asians 16 per
cent.
"The original idea behind eth
nic orientation was to address the
special problems, concerns, and
anxieties of ethnic students,"
said Laurie Langfitt, the head co
ordinator of Orientation. "In ad
dition, we want to introduce the
general public to ethnic aware
ness and openness. We have a
dual purpose for these events."
Tne new International Banquet
is the most noticeable change in
Orientation, which was pushed

back one day this year to recog
nize the Jewish New Year, Rosh
Hashonah, celebrated last
Thursday.
The International Banquet was
the largest of the six Orientation
dinners put on by the following
committees: the Asian American
New Student Orientation Com
mitee (AANSOC), the Black
Recruitment and Orientation
Committee, the Chicano/Latino
Orientation Committee (CLOC),
the Jewish Orientation Commit
tee, the Native American Orien
tation Committee, and the Inter
national Student Orientation
Committee (1SOC).
"The international students
have their own set of problems
and concerns," Langfitt said.
"This is major culture shock for
them (to come to Stanford). It
became apparent that something
was necessary. Last year was the
first year that we had an interna
tional core group, but we didn't
have an international orientation.
This year the international coor
dinator can work on the whole
program and address (the inter
national students') concerns."
"1 was an international student
(when) there wasn't an interna
tional orientation here," said
ISOC coordinator Lema Atya,
who is from Kuwait. "I know
that the students who came with
me were really displeased that
there was no orientation."
While last year most new stu
dents ate in their own residences,
this year dinner was only served
at the six banquets. Nearly 2,000

frosh, transfers and faculty mem
bers were treated to a semi
formal meal Saturday evening
with music, entertainment and
presentations by faculty mem
bers of several ethnic descents.
"All students have the chance
to attend a banquet and explore
cultural differences," said Alice
Supton, assistant dean of Resi
dential Education. According to
Supton, this increased emphasis
on cultural identity is both timely
and important because most are
living on their own for the first
time, especially the freshmen.
"For freshmen, it is a personal

decision to reach out beyond the
familiar," she said.
Langfitt said that because of
the community's increased focus
on ethnicity, the Orientation staff
and Res Ed have tried to empha
size the need for cultural aware
ness.
"We have made a big point
about your not having to belong
to (a particular) ethnic group in
order to attend the events," said
John Rhee, one of the 213 Orien
tation volunteers.
"It's a realization and continu

diverse group of students at Stan
ford,"' said Juan Yniguez, assis
tant dean of student affairs. "At
CLOC we try to set the tone of
openness. Students expect to see
nothing but brown faces, but we
have every color under the sun."
Jae Choi, the AANSOC coor
dinator, said he wished that more
students attended the ethnic
events to create more exchange
in the Stanford community. "We
are not trying to segregate," he
said. "We are trying to enrich."
Academics, as well as diver
sity, were targeted for special at
tention in this year's Freshman
Orientation, according to Atya.
"We want to introduce them to
the educational facilities here,"
she said.
According to Langfitt, it is im
portant to "highlight all the dif
ferent aspects of Stanford life
and get away from its country
club image."

this year dinner was only served
at the six banquets. Nearly 2,000

frosh, transfers and faculty mem
bers were treated to a semi
formal meal Saturday evening
with music, entertainment and
presentations by faculty mem
bers of several ethnic descents.
"All students have the chance
to attend a banquet and explore
cultural differences," said Alice
Supton, assistant dean of Resi
dential Education. According to
Supton, this increased emphasis
on cultural identity is both timely
and important because most are
living on their own for the first
time, especially the freshmen.
"For freshmen, it is a personal

decision to reach out beyond the
familiar," she said.
Langfitt said that because of
the community's increased focus
on ethnicity, the Orientation staff
and Res Ed have tried to empha

"We have made a big point
about your not having to belong
to (a particular) ethnic group in

CLOC we try to set the tone of
openness. Students expect to see
nothing but brown faces, but we
have every color under the sun."
Jae Choi, the AANSOC coor
dinator, said he wished that more
students attended the ethnic
events to create more exchange
in the Stanford community. "We
are not trying to segregate," he
said. "We are trying to enrich."
Academics, as well as diver

tention in this year's Freshman
Orientation, according to Atya.
"We want to introduce them to
the educational facilities here,"
she said.
According to Langfitt, it is im

ferent aspects of Stanford life
and get away from its country
club image."
