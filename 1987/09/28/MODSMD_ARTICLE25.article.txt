Although Stanford is best
known for its prowess in the
sciences, a group of Stanford
graduates and faculty mem
bers has come to the forefront
of the New York art world
with a major exhibition in
Manhattan.
Celebrating the artistic tal
ents of Stanford alumni on the
East Coast, the show opened
in grand style on Sept. 15 and
will continue its run at the
Charles Cowles Annex
Gallery in the SoHo area of
Manhattan until Oct. 7, ac
cording to Robert Simon, di
rector of the eastern region of
the Stanford Office of Devel
opment.
Featuring the work of 38
Stanford graduates who are
currently practicing artists in
the New York area and nine
faculty members of the Stan
ford Art Department, there is
a wide spectrum of participat
ing artists.
Unknown artists have their
works exhibited next to those
of Robert Motherwell and
Richard Diebenkorn, the most
famous living artists to emerge
from the Stanford master in
fine arts program, according to
Simon.
Participation in the exhibi

tion has been a special experi
ence for many of the artists,
including Jean Krasno, a
painter who obtained her
master's degree in art in 1967.
Krasno's piece, consisting of a
painting on three old doors
hinged together, is the first
work she has had displayed in
a New York gallery.
For her, the event has been
"exciting. I feel like I've had a
lot of good exposure. It really
meant something to bring to
gether all of these artists with
something in common,'' she
said.
Although recent trends in
Stanford education have em
phasized the University's pre
eminence in the areas of sci
ence, business and law, the
New York exhibition high
lights the achievements of
Stanford graduates in the arts
and humanities.
"It's remarkable that (the
show) has received such a
strong showing for such a
relatively small department at
Stanford," Art Prof. Matthew
Kahn said.
Poe Pratt, one of the alumni
on the exhibition's steering
committee, said the results of
their planning were "absolute
ly fabulous. We're all so proud
