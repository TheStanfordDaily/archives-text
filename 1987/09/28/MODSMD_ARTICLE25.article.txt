# Stanford artists take on New York
## 
### Leslie Hatamiya Staff writer 
Although Stanford is best
known for its prowess in the
sciences, a group of Stanford
graduates and faculty mem
bers has come to the forefront
of the New York art world
with a major exhibition in
Manhattan.
Celebrating the artistic tal
ents of Stanford alumni on the
East Coast, the show opened
in grand style on Sept. 15 and
will continue its run at the
Charles Cowles Annex
Gallery in the SoHo area of
Manhattan until Oct. 7, ac
cording to Robert Simon, di
rector of the eastern region of
the Stanford Office of Devel
opment.
Featuring the work of 38
Stanford graduates who are
currently practicing artists in
the New York area and nine
faculty members of the Stan
ford Art Department, there is
a wide spectrum of participat
ing artists.
Unknown artists have their
works exhibited next to those
of Robert Motherwell and
Richard Diebenkorn, the most
famous living artists to emerge
from the Stanford master in
fine arts program, according to
Simon.
Participation in the exhibi

tion has been a special experi
ence for many of the artists,
including Jean Krasno, a
painter who obtained her
master's degree in art in 1967.
Krasno's piece, consisting of a
painting on three old doors
hinged together, is the first
work she has had displayed in
a New York gallery.
For her, the event has been
"exciting. I feel like I've had a
lot of good exposure. It really
meant something to bring to
gether all of these artists with
something in common,'' she
said.
Although recent trends in
Stanford education have em
phasized the University's pre
eminence in the areas of sci
ence, business and law, the
New York exhibition high
lights the achievements of
Stanford graduates in the arts
and humanities.
"It's remarkable that (the
show) has received such a
strong showing for such a
relatively small department at
Stanford," Art Prof. Matthew
Kahn said.
Poe Pratt, one of the alumni
on the exhibition's steering
committee, said the results of
their planning were "absolute
ly fabulous. We're all so proud
of our graduates. Because some
don't get a lot of visiblity, this
gives recognition to those in the
arts."
The mid-September opening
gala was deemed a success by
both Simon and Kahn.
"It was a smashing opening,"
Simon said. "We purchased
1,500 plastic wine glasses for the
event, and there were only a few
hundred left over the morning
after."
Simon said he believed that an
additional benefit to organizing
the show was that it brought to
gether Stanford alumni of differ
ent professions and interests for
one common goal. "The very
idea of having investment bank
ers and corporate heads and art
ists sitting around the same table
was a very positive experience,"
he said.
"I feel good about the spirit ot
Stanford family ties that have

been engendered by the show."
This plurality extended to the
show itself, which Kahn de
scribed as "diverse in character.
It doesn't show a school or
departmental stamp, but (em
phasizes) the originality of each
artist. Much of the work is of a
very high quality."
Although this was the first
major art exhibition by Stanford
alumni and faculty off campus,
Marjorie Price, a member of the
New York/New Jersey Stanford
Club and one of the featured art
ists, presented the idea for a
"Festival of Arts" a few years
ago, according to Simon.
Price's initial vision inspired a
group of Stanford alumni and
parents to come together to form
the Friends of Stanford Artists,
the group responsible for organ
izing the art show.
Organizers called on many
Stanford ties to attract visitors to
the SoHo gallery. "I suspect
there have never been as many
Stanford graduates working on
one project off campus," Simon
said.

In addition to the displays, a
full calendar of panel discussions
and performances are scheduled
as part of the exhibit.
Last Saturday night featured
the Beaux-Arts Ball, a gala
masquerade celebration, and an
evening of performances by
Stanford graduates highlighted
the festivities. While former
Dean of Admissions Fred Har
gadon performed master of
ceremonies duties, Stanford
graduates David Bryant, star of
"Les Miserables," and Mary
Setrakian, of the Light Opera of
Manhattan, performed.
Future scheduled events in
clude a piano recital, a reception
to honor Stanford graduates
prominent in the arts and a panel
discussion on the presidential
outlook, featuring two U.S.
Senators who are Stanford
alumni, Alan Cranston of Califor
nia and Jesse Bingaman of New
Mexico.
Although only 40 alumni artists
are participating in the show,
more than 50 artists expressed in
terest in having their work

shown. A committee selected the
artists and helped them choose
which of their works would best
fit in with the exhibition.
Krasno stressed that many of
the participants did not graduate
from Stanford as art majors, but

instead studied subjects such as
psychology or mathematics.
In fact, few of the featured art
ists currently make their living
through their art. Many hold
other jobs, from driving taxis to
doing graphic design.
