"Four Dubliners"
By Richard Ellmann

$12.95
Richard Ellmann is the man in
the mackintosh. For fans of
James Joyce's "Ulysses," it is
Ellmann who has slipped into
that mysterious and most famous
of all literary raingear and into
the pages of the book itself (so in
tegral has he become to the
reading of Anglo-Irish literature).
A longtime professor at several
American universities, including
Harvard and the University of
Chicago, Ellmann relocated to
Oxford in 1970 to become a fel
low of New College. He was re
ported to have commented that
England would be a perfect base
for a scholar of 20th century
literature because of its easy
access to Dublin and Cork.
Whether at a Bloomsday
celebration in New York or at the
W. B. Yeats Summer Festival in
County Sligo, Ireland, the
renowned critic, who died just
this past year, has been much
missed. We can still find him,
however, and not only in the
older works on Yeats and Joyce;
new titles are upon us.

Ellmann's biography of Oscar
Wilde, a lengthy project on
which the author was working
when he became ill, will soon
emerge from Random House. At
present we have "Four
Dubliners," a collection of es
says originally presented as
lectures at the Library of
Congress and now published in
book form. These Dubliners are
Wilde, Yeats, Joyce and Samuel
Beckett.
The aim of the book is to ex
amine each author at a crucial pe
riod in his development. The
book profiles Wilde as an under
graduate at Oxford, unsure of his
sexuality and hovering between
the Catholic Church and aes
theticism. Ellmann focuses on
Yeats during the period in which
the Nobel laureate was undergo
ing the Steinach vasectomy pro
cedure in the hopes of renewing
his sexual vigor. At the time, Ell
mann writes, Yeats was undergo
ing a "second puberty" and
writing "A Full Moon in March''
and "Last Poems."
Joyce is viewed in Zurich
pounding away at the precious
form of the English novel and
seeking extramarital liaisons as a
means to authenticate "Ulys
ses." Finally, in his treatment of
Beckett, Ellmann takes a look at

the point in the stern dramatist's
life when he was attempting to
both locate himself within, and
distance himself from, the sweep
of the Irish Renaissance.
Except for Beckett's, the focus
of these biographies is
profoundly sexual. Ellmann's
work portrays the peculiarities of
sexuality as windows on the lives
of these Irish greats. Wilde is still
daring and dirty. Yeats is
obsessed with fertility and
regeneration, both in rhyme and
body, and Joyce is boyish in his
fleshly explorations. The person
alities of these men spring into

the world of their literature.
Wilde challenges the Victorian
order with his loaded undertones
and Joyce details the erotic func
tions of the body as few had done
before him. Particularly interest
ing is Ellmann's analysis of the
feminine voice that creeps into
the late Yeats.
This is not to suggest that Ell
mann limits himself to purely
sexual biography. The Beckett
section reads much less sensa
tionally. And with his old favor
ite, Joyce, Ellmann departs from
sexuality and addresses issues
that have always interested him

in "Ulysses" — namely, its
remaking of collected myth and
its deliberate and remarkable
break with literary precedent.
Although he acknowledges
throughout that great writers
come from "nowhere," Ellmann
does perform the task of piecing
together how his Dubliners drift
in and out of each other's work
— from Yeats in Joyce to Joyce
in Beckett. "That they should all
come from the same city," Ell
mann writes of the Dubliners,
"does not explain them, but they
share with their island a tense
struggle for autonomy, a disdain

for occupation by outside author
ities and a good deal of inner divi
sion.
"These qualities," Ellmann
continues, "are not exclusively
Irish, yet Ireland helps to focus
them. And through these four of
her natives, Dublin — once re
luctantly imperial — regains its
power to influence the world
through another imperium, that
of art."
Yes, but in a book about
Dubliners, why are we constantly
in Oxford, Zurich or France? Is
"Sailing to Byzantium" truly a
poem about Irish emigration?
