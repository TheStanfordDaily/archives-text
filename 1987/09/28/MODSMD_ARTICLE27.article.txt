## Spartan defense bends but doesn't break Bennett, Scott keep Cardinal in the game 
### Chris Fialko Senior staff writer 
Usually it's no fun to get kicked in the stomach.
In fact, Stanford players, coaches and fans prob
ably walked away from Saturday's 24-17 loss to the
San Jose State Spartans with that sour feeling in
their bellies.
All except for special teams players Darron Ben
nett and Kevin Scott. Heck, these two guys were
happy that they had literally received a foot in the
gut.
Bennett blocked two San Jose State extra point
attempts, and Scott blocked a punt in the waning
moments of the third quarter.
On a day when Stanford had repeated problems
finishing its drives, these two gentlemen certainly
finished their jobs well.
Despite the solemn post-game mood in the Cardi
nal locker room, Scott immediately brightened up
when he talked about his block.
"I'm not usually on the starting punt block
team," he said. "But coach (Asst. Coach Larry
Kerr) just told me to go in and block one."
The freshman from Phoenix, Ariz., certainly fol
lowed directions. As he lined up for the play, Scott
said he had the feeling he might be able to get to
Spartan punter Tom Diehl.

Marshall Dillard's unsuccessful lateral was symbolic of the Cardinal's futility inside the SJSU 10-yard line.
Brad Muster did recover this fourth-quarter miscue, but a muffed field goal attempt killed the Stanford
scoring drive.
