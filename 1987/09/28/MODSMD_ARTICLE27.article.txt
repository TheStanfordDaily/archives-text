## Spartan defense bends but doesn't break Bennett, Scott keep Cardinal in the game 
### Chris Fialko Senior staff writer 
Usually it's no fun to get kicked in the stomach.
In fact, Stanford players, coaches and fans prob
ably walked away from Saturday's 24-17 loss to the
San Jose State Spartans with that sour feeling in
their bellies.
All except for special teams players Darron Ben
nett and Kevin Scott. Heck, these two guys were
happy that they had literally received a foot in the
gut.
Bennett blocked two San Jose State extra point
attempts, and Scott blocked a punt in the waning
moments of the third quarter.
On a day when Stanford had repeated problems
finishing its drives, these two gentlemen certainly
finished their jobs well.
Despite the solemn post-game mood in the Cardi
nal locker room, Scott immediately brightened up
when he talked about his block.
"I'm not usually on the starting punt block
team," he said. "But coach (Asst. Coach Larry
Kerr) just told me to go in and block one."
The freshman from Phoenix, Ariz., certainly fol
lowed directions. As he lined up for the play, Scott
said he had the feeling he might be able to get to
Spartan punter Tom Diehl.

Marshall Dillard's unsuccessful lateral was symbolic of the Cardinal's futility inside the SJSU 10-yard line.
Brad Muster did recover this fourth-quarter miscue, but a muffed field goal attempt killed the Stanford
scoring drive.
"The (San Jose State) guy on
the line didn't point to me, so 1
knew he wasn't going to block
me," Scott said. "And the up
man checked inside, so 1 had a
clear path from the outside."
Scott had so much momentum
as he blocked the punt that the
ball flew all the way out of
bounds on the sideline.
"Man, he kicked me right in
the stomach," Scott said of
Diehl. "But 1 didn't feel it — 1
was too excited."
Six plays later Cardinal kicker
John Hopkins tallied a field goal
which cut the San Jose State lead
to 24-17, and all of a sudden Stan
ford was a touchdown away.
Of course, the reason that the
Spartan's lead was only seven
points, although they had scored
four touchdowns, was that Ben
nett's midsection had earlier dis
rupted two San Jose State extra
points.

Bennett, who missed last
week's game against Colorado
because of a tonsillectomy, posi
tions himself right behind the
nose tackle on extra-point at
tempts and attacks the kicker by
running straight up the middle.
"It's not me, it's the pattern
that's set up by the guys in front
of me," Bennett said. "A
grandma could have run through
that hole."

have run through that
hole/

Bennett reacted in a quiet,
grandmotherly manner after
blocking the Spartan's first extra
point attempt. He just trotted
calmly off the field with nary a
fist pumping.
"It wasn't that big of a deal,"
Bennett said. "We noticed on
films that they were weak at the
guard-center hole. They were a
little smaller too. You can't do it

against teams like Washington —
they stay pretty stout."
Bennett, who will probably see
some action at the inside
linebacker position when he fully
recovers from his tonsillectomy,
repeated his performance in the
third quarter.
Because of Bennett's two
blocks, the Spartans went for
two-point conversions after their
other two touchdowns and failed
both times. San Jose State had
scored four touchdowns, but had
only 24 points to show for it.
"People really don't realize
how important (special teams)
can be," sophomore cornerback
Alan Grant said. "You can neu
tralize mistakes on offense and
defense with a big play on the
special teams."
Scott and Bennett came up
with not one, but three big plays.
Yet the Cardinal team still lost,
and despite their efforts, the two
kick-block specialists probably
left Stanford Stadium with that
gnawing feeling of a loss — and a
couple bruises — in their
stomachs.
