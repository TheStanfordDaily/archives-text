If getting to the opposition's 10-yard line was all
that counted in college football, then Stanford
would have emerged victorious in Saturday s con
test with San Jose State at Stanford Stadium.
But the combination of a tough Spartan defense
and a sputtering Stanford offense kept the Cardinal
out of the end zone twice when Stanford appeared
on the verge of scoring, and San Jose State held on
for a 24-17 win. Stanford dropped to 0-3.
On paper, it all looked good. Stanford outgained
the Spartans in total yardage and dominated time of
possession. Brad Muster returned from his ankle
injury to lead all rushers with 87 yards and score
both Cardinal touchdowns. The defense held Spar
tan quarterback Mike Perez, who led the nation in
total offense coming into the game, to just 34 yards
passing in the second half. Outstanding play by the
special teams unit denied San Jose State any con
versions after touchdowns.
But Perez connected on 14 of 16 passes for 213
yards, including a 26-yard scoring strike to Johnny
Johnson, in the first half, and bookend backs
Kenny Jackson and James Saxon picked up big
gains and both ran for touchdowns. Stanford had
long drives but was unable to capitalize on good
field position, moving the ball into Spartan territory
five times without scoring.
"They had their way offensively the first half,"
Stanford Head Jack El way said. "But we came out
and made some adjustments in the second half, and
the defense did a good job shutting them down. We
had our opportunities, but things
happened at the wrong time.
Credit San Jose State with hang
ing in there and doing a good job
on the goal line."
Things started off well for the
Cardinal. Stanford's first posses
sion covered 73 yards in 13 plays,
culminating with the first of
Muster's touchdowns on a
leaping 2-yard score. Freshman
kicker John Hopkins' extra point
put Stanford up 7-0 with 9:28 left
in the first quarter.
The scenario looked even
brighter when sophomore
linebacker Jono Tunney
recovered a fumbled handoff
from Perez to Jackson on the

Stanford 47-yard line to end the
Spartans' first series.
The Cardinal managed only
one first down, however, before
David Sweeney was called in to
pooch punt. It was a beauty,
downed at the SJSU 2-yard line,
and after a couple of costly hold
ing penalties, the Spartans had to
punt as well.
The Cardinal started on its
own 26, and another nice drive
took Stanford down to the SJSU
30-yard line. Faced with third
down and three, Ennis overthrew
Jeff James, and a subsequent 47-
yard field goal attempt by Hop
kins missed short and wide left.
San Jose State then put to
gether a 70-yard drive on seven
plays, highlighted by a Perez
screen pass to Saxon, who cut
left and rambled for 34 yards
before Rob Englehardt-Tain
made the stop at the Stanford 6.

On the next play, Jackson scored
on a six yard sweep to the right
side with 8:23 remaining in the
half. Sergio Olivarez' extra point
attempt was blocked by Stanford
linebacker Darron Bennett, who
missed the Colorado game last
week following a tonsillectomy.
Stanford came up with some
clutch plays on its next posses
sion but again came away empty.
Twice on second down and 15,
Ennis completed passes â€” first
to Ed McCaffrey, who picked up
34 yards, and then to Muster,
who went 16 yards. On third and
15 at the Spartan 25, Ennis (who
had 57 yards on the ground for
the game) went 18 yards on a
keeper. Two plays later,
however, the senior quarterback
fumbled after being hit by SJSU
defensive star Yepi Pauu, and
James Burnside recovered for
the Spartans.

Again it took the Spartans just
seven plays to get into the end
zone, this time on a two-yard
Saxon sweep left. A two-point
coversion failed, and San Jose
State led 12-7 with 1:40 left in the
half.
The Spartans then capitalized
on another Stanford mistake, as
Charlie Young fumbled the ensu
ing kickoff and Tim Wells came
up with the ball for San Jose
State on the Stanford 32. Just
two plays later, Perez connected
with Johnson on a 26-yard score.
Again a shot at two points failed,
and the half ended with the Spar
tans on top 18-7.
The second half began the
same way as the first half ended.
Saxon took the kickoff 32 yards,
the Spartans drove 68 yards in 10
plays, and Saxon dove in from a
yard out for the final SJSU score.
Bennett came up with the fifth

blocked extra point of his career
to keep the score at 24-7.
The Cardinal offense also fol
lowed its earlier pattern, as a 10-
play drive from the Stanford 30
to the SJSU 23 sputtered to a halt
despite a run by Muster
to start things off. On fourth and
five, Spartan tackle Mike
Hutcherson hit Ennis' arm, and
the pass went incomplete.
San Jose State took over the
football, but the Stanford defense
took over the game, stopping the
Spartan offense each of its next
five possessions. "The second
half our attitude changed
intensity-wise," Stanford safety
Brad Humphreys said. "We
came together as a unit, and that
gives us a lot to draw on in the fu
ture. Even between the first half
and the second half there was an
amazing difference."
Perez had only 24 yards pass

ing in the third quarter and just 10
yards in the fourth quarter. "It
was a good feeling to stop them,
Humphreys said "We were con
fusing them and stopping them
on three plays. But you've got to
play a full game of football.
The first time the Cardinal
defense stopped the Spartans,
the offense took advantage of the
shift in momentum. Ennis hit
McCaffrey, who caught four
passes for 95 yards, with a 37-
yard gain to the SJSU 23, and
tight end Jim Price caught a pass
over the middle and hulled tor
ward nine yards to the 14.
On third and seven from the 8,
San Jose State was called for in
terference on a pass from Ennis
to Eric Snelson, and on his third
attempt, Muster took the ball in
from the I with :59 to go in the
third quarter. The kick was good,
and Stanford trailed 24-14.
The defense continued to shut
down Perez, Saxon and Jackson,
and special teams again came up
with a big play as freshman
Kevin Scott blocked Tom Diehl's
punt, giving the Cardinal the ball
on the SJSU 29. This time,
however, Stanford had to settle
for a 19-yard field goal after three
straight running plays failed to
get the ball in from inside the
Spartan 4-yard line.
"They (the Spartan defense)
were just a tough group," Muster
said. "They followed the ball
well. They played sound when
they had to inside the 20."
On Stanford's next possession,
Marshall Dillard's 31-yard run
took the Cardinal all the way
down to the SJSU 5-yard line
again, but two more runs lost
three yards, and an incomplete
pass brought lip fourth down.

This time, however, Stanford
couldn't even come away with
three points, as the snap was high
on the field goal attempt and
holder Spencer Cotten was
smothered before he could get
the ball down.
"San Jose was tough inside the
10-yard line," Elway said. "Our
execution had something to do
with it also. I take credit for not
having enough variety of
fensively when we were down
there (inside the 10). When you
are that close, you must be able
to come away with some
points."
With 5:49 to play, Stanford got
another chance at its own 28.
Two consecutive holding
penalties, however, put Ennis in
the unenviable position of first
and 30 at his own 18-yard line. A
pass to Henry Green picked up
11 yards, as did an Ennis keeper,
but on fourth and eight, Ennis
was pressured and his pass
wound up in the hands of Spartan
linebacker Barry Kidney.
The defense again got the ball
back, stopping Perez on a fourth
down run at the Stanford 46, but

with :46 left on the clock, Ennis
completed only one pass, a 6-
yard gain to James. On fourth
and four at the SJSU 48 with just
six seconds left, Ennis threw up a
prayer toward the end zone that
fell incomplete as time ran out.
"I think 1 could have played
better," Ennis said. "Whether it
would have helped or not, I don't
know. We had chances, we just
didn't capitalize. 1 think we re
starting to come together. It
would he nice to have a win.
"We're a lot better than an 0-3
team, 1 can tell you that."
Card notes
Attendance for Stanford's first
home game was 67,500. The Cardinal
plays at home again next week
against 13th-ranked UCLA at 12:30
p.m.
Former Stanford quarterback John
Elway, son of Stanford Coach Jack
Elway and currently quarterback for
the Denver Broncos, was patrolling
the sidelines at Saturday's game. The
ongoing NFL strike gave Elway a
free weekend to watch his alma
mater play.
