# Sac State defeats men's soccer

Across the way, "Music and
Fun Under The Sun" was in full
session. The band was bouncing,
excited freshmen were frolick
ing. Over on Maloney Field,
however, as the men's soccer
game wound down, the mood
was a little more somber.
An enthusiastic crowd had
turned out to cheer Stanford
through its first home game of the
season, but somehow the result
didn't come out quite right. After
battling its way through a score
less first half, the Cardinal
seemed poised to take control of
the contest, but the win didn't
materialize. As in the first half,
Stanford couldn't convert in the
second and ultimaltly fell to
visiting Sacramento State by a
score of 1-0. The loss dropped
Stanford's season record to 3-4-
2.
There was really no reason the
Hornets should have won the
game. In the second half, as both
teams fought to break the dead
lock, Sacramento State scoring
opportunities could be counted
on one hand. In fact, the official
scorer credited the Hornets with
only 3 shots on goal for the game,
compared to a whopping 24 for
the Cardinal.
Stanford was all over the Hor
nets' side of the field, but
couldn't zero in on the net. Of
the Cardinal's twenty-four shots,
only four had to be saved by the
Hornet goalkeeper. Stanford's
closest call came 65 minutes into
the contest, when a crossing shot
by Chris Porch was headed into
the goal by Ross Torres. The
Cardinal, however, was offside,
negating the score. No other shot
by Stanford threatened the Hor
nets' nest.
Inept on offense, the Hornets
earned this victory on defense.

Even their lone score seemed
just a little bit lucky. 75 minutes
into the game, Sacramento State
was awarded a corner kick.
Midfielder Jay Bailey lofted the
ball in front of the Cardinal net
and Stanford goalkeeper Chris
Helling promptly knocked it
toward midfield. The ball went
directly to Sacramento State's

Dave Morris, who powered it
back at the goal.
Helling was in position, but
passing through the crowd the
ball hit a stray leg and popped
into the net. Helling played it
properly, but couldn't get to the
ball in time.
