# No. 2 polo dethrones top-rated California
## Defending champs win NorCal Tournament 
### Matthew Bodman Editorial staff 
Since the NCAA Water Polo
Championships began in 1969,
two Bay Area schools have al
ternated as the sport's domi
nant team: Stanford and Cali
fornia. Either the Cardinal or
the Golden Bears have won the
NCAAs 11 of the last 13 years.
Last season, it was Stan
ford's turn at the top. Led by
four senior All-Americans, the
Cardinal held the No. 1 ranking
the entire season en route to its
second straight NCAA title and
a 36-0 record.
This year, the top ranking
and the NCAA Championship
was supposed to shift to the
other side of the Bay. Cal
returned five starters from last
season's No. 2 team and was
top-rated in preseason.
The Cardinal, with four new
starters (seniors Bob Abbott
and Grant Stanley and juniors
Andrew Lawson and Jeff
Oeding) and the decision to
redshirt 1986 First Team All-
America goalie Todd Kemp,
was rated third in preseason.
Saturday, however, Stanford
put such preliminary predic
tions in jeopardy at the Spieker
Aquatic Complex in Berkeley.
Spurred by the defensive play
of senior goalie Obi Greenman
and two goals by senior Matt
Tingler, the Cardinal overcame
a 2-1 halftime deficit to upset
the No. 1-ranked Bears 4-2 and

win the Northern California
Tournament.
"Cal is tough to beat in their
pool," Stanford Coach Dante
Dettamanti said. "It was the
lowest scoring Stanford-Cal
game that 1 can remember. To
hold them to just two goals is
just outstanding. We played ex
cellent defense, with Obi
playing a great game in goal."
Stanford _also defeated Uni
versity of the Pacific 14-3,
Pomona 15-3 and Fresno State
8-6 in the tournament, pushing
its season record to 10-1. Cal
dropped to 9-2.
"There is no doubt that
having one goalie play the
entire game is more solid for
the team," senior Erich Fis
cher said. (Last season Kemp
and Greenman shared the goal
keeping duties.)
Stanford should move into
the top position in the national
rankings this week based on its
first-place finish in the NorCal
Tournament and second-place
finish behind Cal (a 10-8 loss in
the final) in the UC-Irvine Invi
tational last weekend. By
beating the Cardinal in Irvine,
the Bears ended the nation s
longest consecutive win streak,
put together by Stanford be
tween 1985 and 1987, at 51
games.
"We had something to prove
this weekend," Tingler said.
"We all thought we played
pretty poorly last weekend

against Cal. We were mentally
ready for this one."
The NorCal Tournament, as
well as the games at the UC-
Irvine Invitational (Stanford
upset No. 2 UC-Irvine 10-9 in
overtime), proved that there
are several teams capable of
winning the NCAAs, rather
than one team dominating as
the Cardinal did last season.
Given that only five California
teams receive NCAA invita
tions, just making the NCAAs
will be difficult.
"This is a tough year in
water polo," Fischer said.
"Any team can beat any other
team on a given day. None
really stands above the rest.
Now we have something to
hold on to — we want to lock
our position in and be sure to
make the NCAAs."
With the bulk of the schedule
yet to come and the degree of
parity among the top six teams
— Stanford, Cal, Irvine, USC,
UCLA and Pepperdine — the
rankings may change from
week to week throughout the
season.
"I am pleased with the way
we are playing right now," Det
tamanti said. "The UC-Irvine
tournament made believers out
of a lot of people and gave the
guys confidence. Any doubts
we had about Cal were erased
this weekend. We know we can
beat them. But the tough games
are coming up — the season is
barely getting started."
