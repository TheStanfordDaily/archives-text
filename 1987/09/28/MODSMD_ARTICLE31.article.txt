You gotta like these kids.
> No, this isn't another article
about the San Francisco Giants
and their playoff hopes. The kids
in question are the members of
the Stanford women's volleyball
team, and they are on a roll. With
wins this weekend over both
Washington and Washington
State, the Cardinal is 7-3, 3-1 in
the Pacific 10 Conference.
Stanford entered Pacific 10
play a week ago, with a trip to
UCLA and USC. In Wooden
Center on September 18 the Car
dinal opened league play against
the Bruins.
UCLA, ranked fourth in the
latest American Volleyball
Coaches Association poll, came
into the match as the preseason
pick to win the conference, while
Stanford was picked second. The
Credictions held true to form as
ICLA came out strong and
never let up en route to a four
game win.
All-Amcrican Bruin setter Ann
Boyer ran a well-balanced at
tack, and UCLA served very ef

fectively to post the win. Leading
the way were sophomore Daiva
Tomkus and freshman Samantha
Shaver. The Bruins were also
helped by the offense of Wendy
Fletcher and Stacy Buck, and the
electrifying play of defensive
specialist Julie Barnes.
Tomkus, a 6-foot-1 middle
blocker, registered a match-high
five service aces with an accurate
topspin serve, recording 15 kills
and a .440 hitting percentage.
She was also in on four blocks
and had nine digs.
Shaver, a 5-10 freshman from
Los Altos, was the other hot hit
ter, scoring 13 kills and posting a
.407 hitting mark. She added 16
digs in only her sixth match as a
collegian and is now ranked
second in digs in the conference.
Shaver has already been
compared to former Bruin All-
Americans Patty Orozco-Dodd
and Liz Masakayan, but Shaver
shrugs that off. "It's a compli
ment, but I've got so much to
learn," she said. "It's the
greatest opportunity (to play at
UCLA), both academically and
for volleyball."
Despite the setback, the Cardi

nal is still looking to win the Pac
-10 title. "UCLA's got the jump
on people," Stanford Coach Don
Shaw said, "(but) I don't know if
they have the depth to overcome
(any potential injuries)."
The conference race "looks
pretty good," junior middle
blocker Laura Olesen said.
"Now we have them up here (in
November)."
The following night, the Cardi
nal traveled to USC's North
Gym to meet the 16th-ranked
Trojans. Led by senior Teresa
Smith's 12 kills and Olesen's
eight kills and .615 hitting mark,
Stanford won easily in three
games.
The Trojans are trying to
recover from last season when
they went 2-32 because of inju
ries to almost the entire team.
USC is still suffering, however,
as sophomore Kathi Rich, who
was its projected starting setter
this year, retired because of a
knee injury she suffered last
year. All-American outside hitter
Yvonne Lewis is also out at this
point in the season.
