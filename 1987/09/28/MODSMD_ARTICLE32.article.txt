Joggers in Golden Gate Park
got the surprise of their lives Sat
urday. Four Stanford women's
cross country runners joined
teams from a host of other
schools in the Golden
Bear/Reebok Invitational cross
country meet. The Stanford
men's team, resting in prepara
tion for next week's Stanford In
vitational, withdrew from the
meet.
Senior Cory Schubert led the
Cardinal contingent with her
fourth place finish of 17:50.
Freshmen Wendy Neely and
Jamie Fallon followed with
finishes of 18:21 and 18:31,
respectively, good enough for
12th and 14th places. Patty Wil-

son's 19:40 earned her 20th
place.
"We entered the meet to give
people meet experience," Stan
ford Asst. Coach Scott Chisam
said. "We went to support the
event, but the main reason was to
give the freshmen some meet ex
perience."
Both the men's and women's
squads used this weekend to
ready themselves for the Stan
ford Invitational, one of only two
home meets this season and what
Stanford Coach Brooks Johnson
calls "a preview of the District 8
(Regionals) for the men and
NCAAs for the women."
"The men passed on the meet
because they have to go longer,"
Chisam added. "You can't run a
10 (kilometer) race every week."
