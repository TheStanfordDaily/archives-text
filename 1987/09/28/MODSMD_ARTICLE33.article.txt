Applying relentless pressure throughout the
game, the Stanford women's soccer team posted its
first victory of the season Friday afternoon, shut
ting out USC 3-0 at Maloney Field to raise its
record to 1-4-2.
The Cardinal produced an astounding 55 shots on
goal to the Trojans' five.
"We should have had ten goals," said halfback
Denise Denney, who alone had five attempts hit the
crossbar.
But close doesn't count in soccer, as Stanford
has learned this season. Four of the Cardinal's
games have gone into overtime, resulting in two
ties and two losses. Coming off a 3-1 loss at UC-
Santa Barbara, Stanford hopes to have righted it
self with Friday's win.
"We finally put together what we had been
trying to do all season. We deserved the win,"
senior captain Jen Hill said.
"We're definitely on a winning streak now,"
Denney said.
Denney, a freshman, played the entire game for
Stanford, helping control the tempo of the game at
midfield. Vija Brookshire and Elise Edwards split
time in goal for the shutout.
Offensively, forward Tonya Antonucci put two
balls in the net for the Cardinal to garner top
scoring honors. Midfielder Blair Elliott scored the
Cardinal's other goal.
First-year Coach Berhane Anderberhan will get
another chance to employ his strategies when the
Cardinal takes on Westmont College Oct. 3 at 2
p.m. at Maloney field.
