# Dead skunk found in Synergy House
## 
### Liz Lempert Staff writer 
University cleaning crews
were forced to tear out floor
boards and deoderize Synergy
House after a skunk trapped
under a floor during a Septem
ber 18 termite fumigation
secreted its characteristically
foul-smelling odor and died.
The skunk, which had
burrowed under a student's
room on the first floor, could
not escape when all openings
in the house were sealed for
the termite extermination.
According to Lucy Wil
liams, director of Row
facilities, crews had to remove
the floor of the affected room
to retrieve the skunk. The
crew then cemented the bur
row hole and re-installed the
floor, Williams said.
"It took all day to clean up.
We had to wash the entire
house â€” the walls, the

ceilings, the furniture.
O'Connell Cleaners was called
in to do the rugs and drapes,"
she added.
The house no longer smells,
except for a storage room,
Synergy Resident Assistant
Laura Bonk said yesterday.
The storage room will be
cleaned when residents
remove their belongings.
While most house residents
had not yet returned from
summer vacation when the in
cident occurred, those who
moved back early had to
endure the unpleasant smell.
"People are now just starting
to trickle in and most of them
don't know about it," Bonk
said. "Those who moved in
early took it with a grain of salt
and lived upstairs."
However, Bonk, who had
moved in before anyone else
to assume her RA duties, fled
the pungent odor and slept at
Phi Psi for several nights.
