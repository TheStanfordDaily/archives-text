### Nick Anderson Staff writer 
Condoleezza Rice, associate
professor of political science,
smiles when asked how she feels
about local support for a possible
run at Congressman Ernie Kon
nyu in the Republican primary in
June. "1 find it flattering. The
12th District is a terrific, active
district," she said, but added that
"now is not the time."
Rice, 32, returned in Septem
ber from a year-long fellowship
with the Council on Foreign Re
lations in Washington, D.C.,
where she worked with the Joint
Chiefs of Staff researching mili
tary policy and international se
curity.
She has taught military politics

and alliance politics at Stanford
for six years, in addition to
working at the Center for Inter
national Security and Arms Con
trol on Galvez Street. Rice says
she is committed to her teaching
and research for at least "one
year at a time," observing that
this was not the first time she had
been approached about a can
didacy and probably won't be the
last.
Rice hedges when posed with
the possible choice between
Konnyu and Campbell, but leans
toward Campbell. She supports
Konnyu's right to shift his
opinion on aid to the contras. "In
general, campaigns get bogged
down on the 'consistency
issue,' " she says. "1 think it
shows Konnyu has an open
mind." She would not comment
on the allegations of sexual har
assment on Konnyu's part, de
scribing them as "rumor."
Of Campbell, she says enthusi
astically, "I have the highest
regard for him."
