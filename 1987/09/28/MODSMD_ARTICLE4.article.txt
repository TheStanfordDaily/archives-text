## San Jose man dies after game 
### Mark Lawrence Senior staff writer 
A 23-year-old San Jose man
died Saturday, possibly from
alcohol-related causes, after at
tending the Stanford-San Jose
State football game here, Stan
ford Police Chief Marvin Her
rington said yesterday.
Herrington stressed that it is
unclear whether alcohol was a
factor and said that a final deter
mination on cause of death will
be made by a coroner.
He would not release the
man's name since he was unsure
whether the man's family had
been notified. It is unclear
whether he was a San Jose State
University student, and informa
tion about the conditions sur
rounding his death remain uncer
tain.
Herrington said only that the
man was treated by paramedics
and then taken to Stanford
Hospital, where he died. More
details will probably be available
today.
In an effort to combat an alco
hol problem that has grown in
recent football seasons, Herring
ton said, police patrolling the
stadium gates before the game ar
rested approximately 10 Stanford
students under the age of 21 who
tried to carry alcohol into the
stadium.
The game was the first time in
several years when police sys
tematically checked identifica
tion cards of students entering
the stadium with alcohol. In the
past, police have arrested stu
dents only for drunken behavior

inside the stadium.
"The problem has been bad
and has been getting worse,"
said Herrington, who pledged to
continue checking identification
cards and making arrests as long
as problems persist. "We are
going to make arrests any time
we see [offenses]" he said.
It was unclear exactly how
many students were arrested,
whether they were taken to the
police station or simply cited and
released, and what they were
charged with.
Saturday's developments call
into question the University's
policy concerning alcohol in the
stadium. After lengthy consider
ation last spring of a proposal
that would have banned alcohol
in the stadium, the University
Committee on Athletics, Physi
cal Education and Recreation
decided to continue Stanford's
longstanding policy of allowing
alcohol in the stadium.
But the committee said its de
cision represented a "trial con
tinuation" of the policy and that
a more permanent decision to al
low drinking was contingent on
improved behavior by specta
tors.
Debate over the stadium alco
hol policy followed a 1986 foot
ball season marked by increased
unruliness in the stands. During
last year's games, several specta
tors and a member of the Dollies
were hit by beer cans and other
debris thrown by rowdy fans.
Athletic Director Andy Geiger
said last May that if there was no
reduction in the disruptions
caused by alcohol during football
games, the University would be
prepared to place a total ban on
drinking in the stadium.
Stanford police have in recent
years considered carding specta
tors as a way of reducing alcohol
consumption in the stadium, but
only recently brought in enough
officers to make arrests, Herring
ton said.

Geiger and Dean of Student
Affairs James Lyons said yester
day that they were unaware that
the police planned to check iden
tification at Saturday's game.
But, they said, the police actions
were justified given the recent
concern over rowdiness in the
stadium.
"It seems to me it was fairly
predictable after the discussions
of last spring," Lyons said.
Because of the late hour at
which information was made
available, University officials
were unavailable to comment on
the ramifications of the San Jose
man's death.
