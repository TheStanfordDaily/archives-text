# Kennedy targets alcohol abuse, racism
## 
### Elaine Lu 
University President Donald Ken
nedy welcomed the Class of 1991 to
Stanford with a strong condemnation
of alcohol abuse and an appeal to stu
dents to fight the subtle racism that
exists at the University.
Kennedy, Dean of Undergraduate
Admissions Jean Fetter and Dean of
Undergraduate Studies Thomas
Wasow, speaking at an assembly of
freshmen in Memorial Auditorium
Friday night, encouraged the new stu
dents to take risks during their time at
Stanford.
One way in which freshmen can
take risks, Kennedy said, is by refus
ing to accept passively all the social
traditions of the Stanford community.

especially the tradition of alcohol con
sumption. When social behavior gets
"out of hand," Kennedy said, indi
viduals need to learn how to say,
" No, thanks.' "
In remarks concerning minority
groups at Stanford, Kennedy said
that, "despite good intentions, the
University is guilty of some forms of
racism." He went on to say that in
this "unusually difficult time for
people of color in the United States,"
prejudice needs to be redressed by
both "institutional and personal" ap
proaches.
Because Stanford may be one of the
most diverse environments students
here will ever encounter, Kennedy
urged each individual to go beyond
mere tolerance of other races and

cultures, and actively work to combat
prejudice.
Kennedy was even stronger in his
remarks about alcohol consumption,
saying that there are "no redeeming
virtues in binge drinking." Such
drinking, he said, "squanders re
sources." He urged freshmen "to run
against the tide of (their) own cohorts
. . . at the risk of disapproval."
Kennedy's unusually blunt refer
ence to alcohol comes on the heels of
the alcohol-related drowning death of
a student last spring and after Ken
nedy received a letter from concerned
resident fellows urging him to speak
out against alcohol abuse.
After a workshop on alcohol and
discussions with other resident fel
lows this summer. Soto resident fel

low John Perry drafted a letter to
Kennedy expressing concern about
campus alcohol abuse. In his letter,
Perry urged Kennedy to "make a
strong statement to the entire
campus." He then obtained the
signatures of other resident fellows.
Perry said that because Kennedy
occupies a position "unique in the
whole administration," and because
his words have an "extra impact,"
the resident fellows simply encour
aged him to express what was already
"on his mind, especially after the
drowning of David Dunshee last
spring."
Frenchie Perry, also a resident fel
low at Soto, views Kennedy's
remarks on alcohol as a
"repercussion" from Dunshee's
death in Lake Lagunita. She said
she was not so certain that his
speech was triggered by the letter
from resident fellows.
She said Kennedy may have
had his speech written "long
before" he received the letter.
Responding Sunday to Ken
nedy's remarks, freshman
Adolfo Montesinos said that the
University's alcohol policy was
very lenient, considering what
has been happening on campus
recently."
Freshman Jack Buchanan
agreed. "Kennedy seemed to ac
cept the fact that Stanford stu
dents are going to drink, but he

discourages them from drinking
excessively," he said. "Con
sidering I came from a strict
private school, I thought his
remarks were appropriate, and
not at all out of place."
Although response to Ken
nedy's remarks seemed generally
positive, some observers ques
tioned the timing of the state
ment. "I just didn't think it was
the right time or place, but I
agree with the alcohol policy,"
said junior Alexia Fanayiotou, an
Orientation volunteer. "Under
any other circumstances, I could
have accepted his remarks, but
not in a welcome speech."
Kennedy ended his speech
with a challenge, saying, "You
are part of a historical process,
not mere observers," and a
warm "welcome to the fusion of
life and learning that is our busi
ness here."
