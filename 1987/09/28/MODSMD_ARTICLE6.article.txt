### Bob Michitarian Editorial staff 
A 20-year-old student was
severely injured Friday night
w hen he cut himself on a skylight
in the roof of the Stanford
Bookstore. He is in stable condi
tion today at Stanford Hospital
after surgery early Saturday
morning.
Kenneth Russell, a junior in
Fnglish, cut his leg in two places
when he attempted to run over
the skylight in an effort to avoid
police.
Russell said he climbed onto
the roof at about 10:40 p.m.
Friday in order to get a good seat
for the Stanford Hand rally that
was scheduled to begin in front of
the Bookstore at 11 p.m.
Paramedics reponded to the
accident and the rally was
abruptly moved to the CJuad.
According to witnesses,
several students climbed onto the
overhang at the front of the
Bookstore's roof by climbing up
post office carts near the back of

the building and walking over the
angled part of the roof.
Sophomore Kelly kervisch,
who was standing on the over
hang with Russell and several
others, said that when police
shined their flashlights at the stu
dents on the roof Russell "turned
and ran" up the roof.
"Everyone was saying the
police were coming, so 1 turned
to get off the roof, Russell said

last night. He ran from the over
hang to the top of the roof in an
effort to jump off th£ back side of
the Bookstore, Kervisch said.
When Russell reached the apex
of the roof he stepped on one of
several skylights.
"When I got to the apex of the
I skylight | the second half started
to break. Basically I was jumping

to get off the glass when I felt it
breaking," Russell said.
Russell said he fell on the roof
and the glass cut his thigh and his
ankle. The cut in his thigh was
"not bad," he said, but his ankle
was badly hurt. Kervisch said
Russell was helped by graduate
student Steve Jurichich, a friend
of his who was on the roof, and
the police.
"The police were right there"

to administer first aid, Russell
said. "They really did a good
job."
Russell went into surgery be
tween I and 2 a.m. Saturday
morning and was operated on for
four hours. He said doctors told
him he would have full use of his
leg and would not need any phys
ical rehabilitation.
Russell, who returned Sept. 8
from 10 weeks of study in
Leningrad, said, in a reference to
Soviet medical care, "When I
called my mom I said I was glad
the accident didn't happen there
— I d have been in really bad
shape"
