A 20-year-old student was
severely injured Friday night
w hen he cut himself on a skylight
in the roof of the Stanford
Bookstore. He is in stable condi
tion today at Stanford Hospital
after surgery early Saturday
morning.
Kenneth Russell, a junior in
Fnglish, cut his leg in two places
when he attempted to run over
the skylight in an effort to avoid
police.
Russell said he climbed onto
the roof at about 10:40 p.m.
Friday in order to get a good seat
for the Stanford Hand rally that
was scheduled to begin in front of
the Bookstore at 11 p.m.
Paramedics reponded to the
accident and the rally was
abruptly moved to the CJuad.
According to witnesses,
several students climbed onto the
overhang at the front of the
Bookstore's roof by climbing up
post office carts near the back of

the building and walking over the
angled part of the roof.
Sophomore Kelly kervisch,
who was standing on the over
hang with Russell and several
others, said that when police
shined their flashlights at the stu
dents on the roof Russell "turned
and ran" up the roof.
"Everyone was saying the
police were coming, so 1 turned
to get off the roof, Russell said

last night. He ran from the over
hang to the top of the roof in an
effort to jump off thÂ£ back side of
the Bookstore, Kervisch said.
When Russell reached the apex
of the roof he stepped on one of
several skylights.
"When I got to the apex of the
I skylight | the second half started
to break. Basically I was jumping
