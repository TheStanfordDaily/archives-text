Poll: Americans oppose Bork 2-1
WASHINGTON — A new nationwide poll released Sunday
found that Americans by a nearly 2-1 margin opposed the confir
mation of Judge Robert Bork to the Supreme Court.
This latest survey was the fourth national poll issued since
Bork testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee, and all
found public opinion turning against the conservative jurist, al
though by substantially different margins.
The surveys are particularly significant because Bork's con
firmation probably depends on about a dozen middle-of-the
road senators who remain undecided. Moreover, before the
Senate hearings, the White House said that Bork's testimony
would prove to be "the secret weapon" that would turn public
support in his favor.
Instead, for reasons that remain unclear, support for Bork ap
parently has slipped as a result of his Senate appearance.
Among 1,249 people questioned by Louis Harris Associates,
57 percent said the Senate should reject President Reagan's
nominee to the high court, while 29 percent said they favored his
confirmation. Those who said they watched Bork's testimony
on television or followed it closely in the newspapers opposed
his confirmation by a 61-32 margin.
Iraq intensifies air attacks in Gulf
MANAMA, Bahrain — Iraq stepped up its air strikes against
shipping in the Persian Gulf on Sunday, attacking three oil
tankers off the Iranian coast in one of the most intensive series
of raids since the so-called "tanker war" began four years ago.
The Iraqis accompanied their latest attacks on ships servicing
Iran with a warning that the tanker war will be further intensi
fied unless Teheran accepts a cease-fire as called for by the
United Nations Security Council July 20.
"The Teheran regime has one of two choices — either a com
prehensive peace or all-out war," A 1 Thawra, the official news
paper of Iraq's ruling Baath Party, said in an editorial Sunday.
Gulf-based shipping sources reported Iraqi attacks Sunday on
an Iranian shuttle tanker, a Liberian bulk carrier and on a
Cypriot ship hit twice in two days — the second time as it was
being towed to an Iranian port in the northern gulf.
The Cypriot tanker — the 225,682-ton Coral Cape — was set
on fire, but the blaze was later extinguished and no casualties
were reported, the sources said.
Weinberger blasts actions
WASHINGTON — U.S. Secretary of Defense Caspar
Weinberger, charging that Iran's recent actions in the Persian
Gulf have stamped it as an "outlaw nation," said Sunday that a
new, "totally different kind of government" must come to
power in Teheran before there can be a lasting peace in the bit
ter Iran-Iraq War.
Weinberger, who is in the Persian Gulf inspecting the U.S.
naval fleet, also blasted a proposal by Senate Majority Leader
Robert Byrd (D-W.Va.) that could halt the American convoys
protecting Kuwaiti oil tankers sailing under the American flag
and give Congress a greater role in determining the level of U.S.
military involvement in the volatile region.
Byrd's proposal, which is scheduled for a vote Wednesday,
would be the "height of absurdity," Weinberger said, because it
would tie President Reagan's hands and prevent the United
States from carrying out meaningful military and economic
policies against Iran.
Peace plan hurting contra morale
RIO COCO, Nicaragua — Nicaraguan rebel leaders, in the
face of what they describe as a potentially damaging Sandinista
propaganda barrage, are working to boost the morale of their
confused troops and allay the worries of commanders about a
Central American peace accord.
At the same time, the top military leaders of the rebels, who
are known as contras, are preparing a contingency plan to con
tinue their guerrilla warfare against the Managua government
should U.S. aid be cut off as a consequence of the accord and a
peace acceptable to the contras is not reached.
Also being planned is another action designed to show the
contras' compliance with the peace agreement in the interim:
the freeing of about 30 Sandinista prisoners not included in an
earlier release.
A contra commander acknowledged that Sandinista actions
on the political front lately have caused some uncertainty among
the rebels. "The Sandinistas say we are already at peace," he
said. "This is confusing our troops."
Bush confers with Polish leatlers
WARSAW, Poland — Polish communist leader Gen. Woj
ciech Jaruzelski Sunday rebuffed appeals from Vice President
George Bush for political changes sought by the banned
Solidarity trade union, describing them as "suicidal," in talks
that appeared to make no headway on longstanding U.S.-Polish
differences.
On the second day of a visit here intended to boost his presi
dential campaign at home. Bush repeatedly made symbolic
gestures of support for Solidarity while taking a hard line with
the government. He flashed a Solidarity victory sign at a waiting
crowd, heard praise for Solidarity and U.S. freedoms at Catho
lic Mass, and Sunday night met with Solidarity leader Lech
Walesa at a private dinner.
Officials conceded that Bush had not won additional commit
ments from Jaruzelski for the changes the Reagan administra
tion maintains are necessary in Poland, including the re
establishment of independent unions. Instead, officials said,
Jaruzelski reviewed initiatives of his government and argued
that his human rights record was good.
"The general didn't give ground." one senior U.S. official
said.
Baker defends debt plan at IMF
WASHINGTON —Treasury Secretary James Baker 111 Sun
day rejected Third World demands for dramatic new shifts in
global debt strategy and defended his own plan for dealing with
the debt problem.
"There are no quick fixes that can solve the debt problem,
and dramatic solutions won't appear overnight," Baker said in a
speech to the Interim Committee, the policy-making board of
the International Monetary Fund.
Meanwhile, the decision of the Group of Seven major indus
trial nations to continue to work for stability of exchange rates
around current levels was "warmly endorsed" by the Group of
Ten and by the Interim Committee, which will endorse the ac
tion in a communique to be issued Monday.
The G-7 countries are the United States, Japan, West Ger
many, France, England, Italy and Canada. The Group of Ten —
actually 11 — adds Belgium, the Netherlands, Sweden and Swit
zerland.
All of these group meetings were held to prepare for the joint

nominee to the high court, while 29 percent said they favored his
confirmation. Those who said they watched Bork's testimony
on television or followed it closely in the newspapers opposed
his confirmation by a 61-32 margin.
Iraq intensifies air attacks in Gulf
MANAMA, Bahrain — Iraq stepped up its air strikes against
shipping in the Persian Gulf on Sunday, attacking three oil
tankers off the Iranian coast in one of the most intensive series
of raids since the so-called "tanker war" began four years ago.
The Iraqis accompanied their latest attacks on ships servicing
Iran with a warning that the tanker war will be further intensi
fied unless Teheran accepts a cease-fire as called for by the
United Nations Security Council July 20.
"The Teheran regime has one of two choices — either a com
prehensive peace or all-out war," A 1 Thawra, the official news
paper of Iraq's ruling Baath Party, said in an editorial Sunday.
Gulf-based shipping sources reported Iraqi attacks Sunday on
an Iranian shuttle tanker, a Liberian bulk carrier and on a
Cypriot ship hit twice in two days — the second time as it was
being towed to an Iranian port in the northern gulf.
The Cypriot tanker — the 225,682-ton Coral Cape — was set
on fire, but the blaze was later extinguished and no casualties
were reported, the sources said.
Weinberger blasts actions
WASHINGTON — U.S. Secretary of Defense Caspar
Weinberger, charging that Iran's recent actions in the Persian
Gulf have stamped it as an "outlaw nation," said Sunday that a
new, "totally different kind of government" must come to
power in Teheran before there can be a lasting peace in the bit
ter Iran-Iraq War.
Weinberger, who is in the Persian Gulf inspecting the U.S.
naval fleet, also blasted a proposal by Senate Majority Leader
Robert Byrd (D-W.Va.) that could halt the American convoys
protecting Kuwaiti oil tankers sailing under the American flag
and give Congress a greater role in determining the level of U.S.
military involvement in the volatile region.
Byrd's proposal, which is scheduled for a vote Wednesday,
would be the "height of absurdity," Weinberger said, because it
would tie President Reagan's hands and prevent the United
States from carrying out meaningful military and economic
policies against Iran.
Peace plan hurting contra morale
RIO COCO, Nicaragua — Nicaraguan rebel leaders, in the
face of what they describe as a potentially damaging Sandinista
propaganda barrage, are working to boost the morale of their
confused troops and allay the worries of commanders about a
Central American peace accord.
At the same time, the top military leaders of the rebels, who
are known as contras, are preparing a contingency plan to con
tinue their guerrilla warfare against the Managua government
should U.S. aid be cut off as a consequence of the accord and a
peace acceptable to the contras is not reached.
Also being planned is another action designed to show the
contras' compliance with the peace agreement in the interim:
the freeing of about 30 Sandinista prisoners not included in an
earlier release.
A contra commander acknowledged that Sandinista actions
on the political front lately have caused some uncertainty among
the rebels. "The Sandinistas say we are already at peace," he
said. "This is confusing our troops."
Bush confers with Polish leatlers
WARSAW, Poland — Polish communist leader Gen. Woj
ciech Jaruzelski Sunday rebuffed appeals from Vice President
George Bush for political changes sought by the banned
Solidarity trade union, describing them as "suicidal," in talks
that appeared to make no headway on longstanding U.S.-Polish
differences.
On the second day of a visit here intended to boost his presi
dential campaign at home. Bush repeatedly made symbolic
gestures of support for Solidarity while taking a hard line with
the government. He flashed a Solidarity victory sign at a waiting
crowd, heard praise for Solidarity and U.S. freedoms at Catho
lic Mass, and Sunday night met with Solidarity leader Lech
Walesa at a private dinner.
Officials conceded that Bush had not won additional commit
ments from Jaruzelski for the changes the Reagan administra
tion maintains are necessary in Poland, including the re
establishment of independent unions. Instead, officials said,
Jaruzelski reviewed initiatives of his government and argued
that his human rights record was good.
"The general didn't give ground." one senior U.S. official
said.
Baker defends debt plan at IMF
WASHINGTON —Treasury Secretary James Baker 111 Sun
day rejected Third World demands for dramatic new shifts in
global debt strategy and defended his own plan for dealing with
the debt problem.
"There are no quick fixes that can solve the debt problem,
and dramatic solutions won't appear overnight," Baker said in a
speech to the Interim Committee, the policy-making board of
the International Monetary Fund.
Meanwhile, the decision of the Group of Seven major indus
trial nations to continue to work for stability of exchange rates
around current levels was "warmly endorsed" by the Group of
Ten and by the Interim Committee, which will endorse the ac
tion in a communique to be issued Monday.
The G-7 countries are the United States, Japan, West Ger
many, France, England, Italy and Canada. The Group of Ten —
actually 11 — adds Belgium, the Netherlands, Sweden and Swit
zerland.
All of these group meetings were held to prepare for the joint
annual meeting of the 151 member countries of the World Bank
and IMF starting Tuesday.

Poll: Americans oppose Bork 2-1
WASHINGTON — A new nationwide poll released Sunday
found that Americans by a nearly 2-1 margin opposed the confir
mation of Judge Robert Bork to the Supreme Court.
This latest survey was the fourth national poll issued since
Bork testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee, and all
found public opinion turning against the conservative jurist, al
though by substantially different margins.
The surveys are particularly significant because Bork's con
firmation probably depends on about a dozen middle-of-the
road senators who remain undecided. Moreover, before the
Senate hearings, the White House said that Bork's testimony
would prove to be "the secret weapon" that would turn public
support in his favor.
Instead, for reasons that remain unclear, support for Bork ap
parently has slipped as a result of his Senate appearance.
Among 1,249 people questioned by Louis Harris Associates,
57 percent said the Senate should reject President Reagan's
nominee to the high court, while 29 percent said they favored his
confirmation. Those who said they watched Bork's testimony
on television or followed it closely in the newspapers opposed
his confirmation by a 61-32 margin.
