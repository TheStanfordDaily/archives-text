At first glance, it may look like an
ordinary calculator, but the Casio
solar CM-100 is anything but. It's
an extraordinary software tool
that's as useful in programming an
Apple™ as it is a mainframe IBM™
The key to the CM-100's
incredible flexibility is Casio's
adjustable bit-size selector which
can be set to suit any size com
puter up to 32 bits. And its block
display which can, by scrolling
blocks of 8 digits at a time, display
up to a 32 bit word.
But there's much more to this
pocket-size powerhouse. It can do
base conversions from binary/
octal/decimal/hexadecimal modes
and can store in its memory
numbers in any base. It also has
Shift, Rotate, Arithmetic Shift and
Boolean functions that include
AND, OR, XOR and NOT.
Perhaps what is most extraor
dinary about the CM-100 though,
is not how much it can do, but how
little it costs to do it. The CM-100 is
the only calculator that'll let you do
all your software figuring for less
than you'd figure to pay for an
average ($25.00) textbook.
The more you work with com
puters—whatever their size—the
more you need a CM-100. Whether
you're a student or professional, it's
the one piece of hardware that will
make designing your software easier.
