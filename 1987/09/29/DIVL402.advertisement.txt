CSI23 Cognitive Introduction to
Artificial Intelligence
(Revised Course Description:
ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE:
AN INTRODUCTION AND SURVEY)
Artificial Intelligence (AI) is the science and technology of
building computer programs that reason about problems
using knowledge, that interact with people in natural
language, and that perceive images and speech. The
course will survey the main areas of work in AI, and
address their economic, social, and scientific importance:
knowledge representation; problem solving methods;
expert systems; natural language and speech
understanding; computer vision; machine learning,
software tools, and some other current research areas.
The course is aimed at a broad university audience. No
programming will be done, but CSIOS or equivalent
computer exposure (by permission of instructor) is
required.
