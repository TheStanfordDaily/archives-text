# Reagan lobbies senators for Bork
## 
### 
WASHINGTON President
Reagan, faced with surveys that
show public opinion turning
against Judge Robert Bork, will
attempt to rescue his embattled
Supreme Court nomination with
an intense, personal lobbying ef
fort directed at undecided
senators, administration officials
said yesterday.
"What happens now is hand
to-hand combat," said White
House political adviser Frank
Donatelli. "The outcome will be
very close, and it's up for
grabs."
Reagan advisers said the presi
dent has rejected any "backup
strategy" for an alternative to
Bork and plans to begin making
telephone calls to key senators
and holding one-on-one meetings
with some of them. A senior offi
cial said Reagan had made Bork
his "No. 1 domestic priority"
and would call for his confirma
tion in virtually every public ap
pearance.
Meanwhile, Senate Majority
Leader Robert Byrd (D-W.Va.)
told NBC News that he had rec
ommended to Senate Judiciary
Committee Chairman Joseph
Biden Jr. (D-Del.) that the Bork
nomination be sent to the Senate
floor without a recommendation,
a move that would allow un
decided senators to delay a deci
sion and give both sides more
time to maneuver.
As the committee began its
third week of public hearings on
the nomination yesterday, Biden
announced that its vote on Bork,
originally set for Thursday,
would be put off until next week.
He said the hearings would end
this week, possibly as early as to
morrow.
Strategists for both sides ac
knowledge that the fate of the
nomination is up in the air, with
20 or more senators undecided.
But there is also a clear sense
among pro-Bork forces that they
have been thrown on the defen
sive by an effective public rela

tions campaign by Bork's oppo
nents.
Senior officials said that a sur
vey taken for the White House
produced a similar result to last
week's Washington Post-ABC
News poll, which showed that a
slight plurality of those aware of
the nomination opposed Bork.
Both surveys found voters shift
ing from undecided to a position
of opposition.
"There's no question that the
public relations war heated up
and we didn't do well," said one
strategist. "We got killed. The
civil rights groups turned it into a
political campaign. Look at the
polls. They've scored some
points, indeed."
This source also complained
about the inactivity of conserva
tive groups in the public battle.
When Bork was nominated, he
acknowledged, the White House
told right-wing groups to "calm
down" for fear they would play
into the hands of Bork's oppo
nents, who have tried to portray
him as a right-wing zealot. But,
he said, "they've calmed down
to the point they've gone under
ground."
A number of the conservatives
complained, however, that the
White House miscalculated by
underestimating the intensity of
the assault on Bork.
"They came to the realization
too late that this was going to be
trench warfare," said Daniel
Casey, executive director of the
American Conservative Union.
"They failed to shift gears in time
and recognize the need to get the
president more frequently out
front."
"The White House was figur
ing out that this was a real fight in
September," said Patrick
McGuigan, legal affairs analyst
for Coalitions for America, a
conservative umbrella group.
"We figured out it was a real
fight in July."
McGuigan said the White
House rebuffed suggestions for
an "August offensive" on Bork's

behalf, instead limiting Reagan's
effort during his California vaca
tion to a single meeting with law
enforcement groups.
"That was the August offen
sive," McGuigan said. "It was a
joke for that to be the whole
thing."
White House officials pointed
out that Reagan emphasized
Bork's confirmation in three of
the five speeches he made on his
vacation, two of them in Ne
braska en route to his California
ranch. They also disputed con
servative complaints that the
White House had erred in
presenting Bork as a mainstream
candidate, instead of an ardent
conservative.
"First of all, the president con
siders Bork to be centrist and a
strict constructionist, which is
the way we've been presenting
him," said one strategist. "It
never works for this president
when the presentation isn't close
to what he thinks about things.
Secondly, we would not have
had the support of people like
(former chief justice) Warren
Burger and (former president)
Gerald Ford if we had offered
Bork as a right-winger."
White House officials now
hope that conservative support
ers will stop second-guessing
early strategy and help in the
confirmation fight.
"There's no one at the White
House with a defeatist attitude,"
said White House communica
tions director Thomas Griscom.
Legislative strategist Will Ball
said the outcome is "truly an
open question" that could be
decided by the president's partic
ipation.
"Since the nomination the
president has been speaking out
publicly," Ball said. "He will
continue to do so, but he will also
turn his attention to getting votes
in the Senate."
Reagan is scheduled to keep up
his public campaign for Bork
today at the signing of a deficit
reduction bill and continue it to

morrow at a meeting of Bork sup
porters and Thursday at the
swearing-in of new FBI Director
William Sessions, where the
president will emphasize Bork's
position on criminal justice is
sues.
Reagan's higher profile in the
confirmation fight was signaled
by Assistant Attorney General
John Bolton, who has been coor
dinating the administration effort
at the Bork hearings.
"The president's speech on
Friday was a harbinger of what is
to come," Bolton said. "This is,
after all, a presidential nomina
tion and he cares about it. . . .
Overall, as the hearings conclude
and we move into the next stage,
both the president and the admin
istration as a whole will be much
more visible."
Reagan on Friday told a group
of conservative women that
Bork's critics are "ideologically
inspired" and predicted that the
60-year-old appeals court judge
would be confirmed.
Bolton denied the growing im
pression that the Bork nomina
tion is in jeopardy because of the
constant pounding by opponents
during the hearings.
"I don't think the tide is run
ning in either direction," he said.
"Because the vote is not immedi
ately in sight, there are a lot of
genuinely undecided senators."
The administration may be
playing for time, as Reagan
begins to launch his counterof
fensive. During the summer,
Republicans complained bitterly
about the mid-September start of
hearings, accusing Biden and the
Democrats of attempting to kill
the nomination through delays.
There were no complaints yester
day from Judiciary Committee
Republicans when Biden an
nounced the committee vote
would be put off until next week.
