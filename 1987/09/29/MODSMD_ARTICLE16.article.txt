## Bork will undermine Constitutional rights 
### Alexander Rawls 
Judge Robert Bork advocates that
where the language of the Constitution is
not perfectly clear, justices should look
to the "original intent" of the framers
for an interpretation. But in fact, Bork
uses the doctrine of original intent not
primarily to clarify what is not clear but
to circumvent the clear language of the
Constitution. His view of the First
Amendment's freedom of speech is a
good example.

The First Amendment reads: ;
"Congress shall make no law . . .
abridging the freedom of speech." Be
cause the guarantee of free speech is
listed alongside some clearly political
protections, such as the right to petition,
Bork finds that the framers intended
only to protect political speech. But the
words are explicit: "Congress shall
make no law." Original intent is used to
deny an explicit interpretation.
Bork has retreated from this view of
the First Amendment, but only because
he finds it unworkable. Any speech
could be made political, Bork avers, by
adding at the end "so let's pass a law."
He has not renounced the principle that

only political speech should be
protected.
The doctrine of original intent is fun
damentally flawed. The legislature of the
several states ratified the Constitution
and its amendments, not the delibera
tions that led to them.
This distinction made news recently
when the Reagan administration tried to
reinterpret the 1972 anti-ballistic missile
(ABM) treaty to allow testing of space
based missile defenses. They claimed
that the negotiating record never sub
mitted to the Senate called for the
reading Reagan wanted. It turned out to
be a ruse. Sen. Sam Nunn (D-Ga.) in
sisted on seeing the negotiating record
and it said no such thing. But even if it
had, it was the treaty, and not the
negotiating record, that was ratified by
the Senate.
At Bork's confirmation hearing, much
of the questioning centered around the
Ninth Amendment. Bork's philosophy
of "judicial restraint" holds that justices
should extend no protections that are
not explicitly enumerated in the Consti
tution. This is an exact negation of the
Ninth Amendment, which reads as fol
lows: "The enumeration in the Constitu
tion of certain rights shall not be con
strued to deny or disparage others
retained by the people." When asked by
Sen. Strom Thurmond (R-S.C.) what he
thought the Ninth Amendment meant,

Bork replied that he didn't know what it
could mean, though the language is per
fectly clear.
The standard interpretation, as Bork
well knows, was stated by Justice Ar
thur Goldberg in a concurring opinion in
Griswold v. Connecticut. Goldberg
wrote that the Ninth Amendment was
offered "to quiet expressed fears that a
bill of specifically enumerated rights
could not be sufficiently broad to cover
all essential rights and that the specific
mention of certain rights would be inter
preted as a denial that others were
protected."
Then Bork offered a startling view of
the Ninth Amendment that portends a
gambit by Bork, should he be confirmed,
to gut the amendment under jthe guise of
original intent. Bork made an offfiand
remark to some scholars in Virginia who
claimed to have evidence that the Ninth
Amendment was intended to protect
states' bills of rights from infringement
by federal law. Under this reading, the
Ninth Amendment contrary to its lan
guage would not protect any non
enumerated rights but would only
protect enumerated rights of the states'
bills of rights, and it would not afford
any protections at the federal level.
Bork rejects the obvious reading of
the Ninth Amendment for a contorted
one that is at odds with the declared pur
pose of the Constitution to "secure the

blessings of liberty to ourselves and our
posterity." As with freedom of speech,
Bork would use the method of original
intent to get around the clear language of
the Constitution.
Whether these unknown scholars
from Virginia made a real discovery or
not is irrelevant. It was the language of
the Bill of Rights that was ratified by the
states, not some esoteric understanding
of that language and not the negotiating
record of the framers.
To the discredit of the first 175 years
of the Court's history, there is little body
of precedent for interpreting the Ninth
Amendment. It is only recently that the
Court has started to extend the non
enumerated protections called for by the
Ninth. When the Court did start finding
some non-enumerated protections, it did
so by the very conservative method of
building on the enumerated protections.
The role of the Ninth Amendment in
supporting this process was introduced
by Justice William Douglas in Griswold
v. Connecticut. That opinion, and the
concurring opinion by Justice Goldberg,
are virtually all that would seem to stand
between a Justice Bork and the es
tablishment of his own version of the
Ninth Amendment. It is not surprising,
then, that Bork has bitterly and
repeatedly attacked the Griswold deci
sion as "unprincipled."

In fact, Griswold is an outstanding ex
ample of genuine "strict construc
tionism" and is decidedly conservative
in its reasoning. Douglas knew by the
Ninth Amendment that some non
enumerated rights were to be protected.
He did not take this as license to protect
whatever he preferred. He was only will
ing to find a Ninth Amendment protec
tion where the logic of the enumerated
protections seemed to call for it. For
each of several protections in the Bill of
Rights, Douglas found "penumbras
formed by emanations" which protected
the privacy of the individual. Invoking
also the Ninth Amendment, Douglas
then found a right to privacy.
It is this extremely conservative
opinion that Bork continually assails as
"radical" and "unprincipled." It is hard
to avoid the conclusion that it is the
Ninth Amendment itself that Bork finds
unprincipled.
America is a freedom-loving, not a
freedom-hating, country. That an im
placable foe of liberty should be ap
pointed to the Supreme Court is surreal.
I am sure that most who support Bork's
nomination do not know what he
represents. They would do well to inves
tigate my warnings. The Constitution
must not fall into the hands of its detrac
tor.
