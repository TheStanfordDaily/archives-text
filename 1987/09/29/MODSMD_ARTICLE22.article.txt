## Bug Me is back! He's bristling over a Bangle and a Barrymore 
### Andrew Berkowitz Staff writer 
The Bug is back! After a
glorious summer attempting to
divorce sockeye salmon from
the frozen waters of Alaska,
the Bug has returned to answer
those tricky questions that
have been burning on your va
cant brain during the summer.

Many thanks to KathrynVer
Ploeg for her job as the Bug last
volume. But, as in the Miss
America Pageant, once your
year is over the fame is fleeting.
Unless, of course, you pose
nude. Stay tuned for the Pent
house Bug-of-the-Month.
Kathryn?
For those of you new to
Stanford or to reading, Bug Me
is your column to get those

answers to the little questions
that have been, well, bugging
you.
Want to know how much
they mark up the shampoo at
the Store?
Write to the Bug.
Curious about how to build a
thermonuclear device for under
fifty dollars? Write to the
Bug.
Need the answers to tomor
row's Western Culture final?
Write to the Bug.
Really, there are absolutely
no limits to what you can ask.
Traditionally, questions to the
Bug have focused largely on
Stanford, Palo Alto and the sur
rounding areas, but please
don't limit your inquiring minds
to such narrow venues. The
Bug is ready and willing to an
swer your questions on sci
ence, etiquette, sex, cooking,
consumer safety or anything
else that pops inexplicably into
your heads during a poli sci
lecture.
Questions sent to Bug Me in
the past have ranged from the
idiotic (What is the maximum
velocity attainable by the com
mon housefly?) to the just
downright stupid (What is the
name of Dudley Do-Right's
horse?).
Why, you ask, does the Bug
go to such Herculean efforts to

answer your poignant qu*j
tions in a lively yet timely _
manner? Because the Bug cam
get a date with Susanna Hofl
of the Bangles. That's why.
And if the Bug can't have a
Bangle, what else is there to do
with life?
Also, you may ask, why does
the Bug refer to himself in the
third person, taking the consid
erable risk of being mistaken
for Miss Manners? Because if
the Bug referred to himself in
the second person he would be
labeled schizophrenic and
hauled off to the Abnormal
Psychology Department.
YOU'VE gotta send in the
questions. Every question in
this column comes from a real
person; they are not made up.
Without the questions, there
can be no answers. So send
your questions to:
Bug Me
Stanford Daily
Storke Building
Stanford, CA 94305
Or bring your questions to
the Daily in person. Or, even
better, send your questions via
the LOTS computer system to
Bug-Me. Not B.Bug-Me or Bug
Me. Sending e-mail to Bug-Me
is a great way to break the

monotony of an all-nighter at
Sweet Hall!
So bring on those burning
questions. There is no obligation.
Nothing to buy. No salesman will
call. Do it today.
Dear Bug: While watching
Ishtar this summer, I was sud
denly struck with the thought
that someone must once have
made the worst movie of all time.
Someday I hope to subject my
kids to something so un
speakable that they will leave
home and not force me to pay for
their education. What IS the
worst movie of all time? Will it be
suitable for my kids?
Future Evil Parent.
Has it ever occured to you that
if there was one movie of all time
that was actually certified as the
worst film in history, you might,
have heard about it by now? You
know what the tallest mountain
is. The biggest state. But you've
never seen the category "Worst
Movie" in the Guiness Book of
World Records. Why? Because
the question calls for the Bug to
give a subjective answer, which
he does not dane to do.
Well, if you insist.
There are so many candidates
for this dubious honor that it is
hard to pick just one.
The worst movie of this decade
is unquestionably that epic of
silliness, "Firestarter." Insipidly
cute Drew Barrymore plays a
little girl who is normal in every
way. Unless you count that little
problem she has when she gets
mad. She turns into the Incredi
ble Hulk . . . er . . . she starts
fires with her (drumroll please)
psychic powers. Her father is
also blessed with psychic
powers, although when he thinks
too hard, blood comes out of his
face. Now there's a malady many
Stanford students can readily
identify with.

that someone must once have
made the worst movie of all time.
Someday I hope to subject my
kids to something so un
speakable that they will leave
home and not force me to pay for
their education. What IS the
worst movie of all time? Will it be
suitable for my kids?

Has it ever occured to you that
if there was one movie of all time
that was actually certified as the
worst film in history, you might,
have heard about it by now? You
know what the tallest mountain
is. The biggest state. But you've
never seen the category "Worst
Movie" in the Guiness Book of
World Records. Why? Because
the question calls for the Bug to
give a subjective answer, which
he does not dane to do.
Well, if you insist.
There are so many candidates
for this dubious honor that it is
hard to pick just one.
The worst movie of this decade
is unquestionably that epic of
silliness, "Firestarter." Insipidly
cute Drew Barrymore plays a
little girl who is normal in every
way. Unless you count that little
problem she has when she gets
mad. She turns into the Incredi
ble Hulk . . . er . . . she starts
fires with her (drumroll please)
psychic powers. Her father is
also blessed with psychic
powers, although when he thinks
too hard, blood comes out of his
face. Now there's a malady many
Stanford students can readily
identify with.
