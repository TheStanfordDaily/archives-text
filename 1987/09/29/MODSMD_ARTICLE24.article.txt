## New robot helps quadriplegics meet needs 
### Ingrid Wickelgren Editorial staff 
A robotic arm developed at the
Veterans Administration Medical
Center in Palo Alto can feed,
wash and groom quadriplegics in
response to their one-word com
mands, allowing these disabled
people to become more indepen
dent.
"Are you my mother?" asks
the electronic voice after the pa
tient has said his name and, in
doing so, turned on the com
puter. But the robot is asleep. In
fact, it is snoring. To wake up the
robot, the patient will say
"ready" and then "attention."
Once the robot is awake, it will
move into "home position,"
from which it can perform a vari
ety of tasks such as shaving the
patient, brushing his teeth with
an electronic toothbrush, was
hing and drying his face, feeding
him soup and turning on other
appliances such as a lamp or a
radio.
"This robot is the only one (of
its type) in the country that has
been proved reliable in extensive
clinical tests and is ready to go
out into the home and vocational
setting," said Joy Hammel, re
search occupational therapist on
the project.
Two Stanford students, Bob
Crigler and David Lees, received
master's degrees in mechanical
engineering while working on the
project. Crigler and Lees
programmed all the software
developed over the last year-and
a-half, according to Lees. This
recent software has made the
robot much more user-friendly
and has brought it to the testing
stage.
The robot was evaluated clini
cally using 20 patients in the VA

Hospital's spinal chord injury
ward. "The response from
patients has been great," Ham
mel said.
Each patient was asked both
before and after using the system
whether he would like to have it
in his home. Before using the
robot, 17 said "maybe" and
three said "no." After using the
robot, 19 said "yes" and one said
"maybe," according to Hammel.
A "high level" quadriplegic
has no use of his or her arms or
legs and is dependent in every
way, according to Hammel.
Quadriplegics usually need
around-the-clock assistance, but
by using the robot they only need
an attendant for a couple of
hours, Hammel said.
The quadriplegic does with a
mouthstick what most people do
with their hands (i.e. turn the
pages of a book or type on a
keyboard). The robot hands the
mouthstick to the quadriplegic
when asked. Movement of the
mouth is a key motor skill for
quadriplegics one of the few
available to them, according to
Hammel.
Most quadriplegics also have
control over their voice. That is
why developers of the robot
made their computer system
voice-activated, Hammel said.
Before the robot is used by the
patient, he must train the com
puter to recognize his voices.
This training consists of repeat
ing the 60 words in the robot's
vocabulary twice and takes about
10 minutes, according to Ham
mel.
The robot does its tasks using a
human prosthetic arm with a cy
lindrical grip so it can grab
various objects ranging from
razors to washcloths. It can
move multiple joints at once and

is able to open doors like those
attached to refrigerators and mi
crowave ovens, two things that
most robot arms cannot do,
Hammel said.
The arm must perform a very
complicated sequence of actions
to do many of the tasks the quad
riplegic asks it to do. For in
stance, to feed the patient a bowl
of soup, the arm must open the
refrigerator and microwave oven
doors, grip the bowl, put the
bowl in the microwave, shut the
microwave door, set the timer
and turn on the oven. It must also
know when the soup is done in
order to retrieve it from the mi
crowave. It then feeds the patient
when the patient says "use."
The robot can perform an
amazing variety of tasks, but it is
not capable of thought. It
assumes that all of its utensils
and appliances are in precisely
determined locations.
"Everything in the robot's envi

ronment must be very
structured," Hammel said. The
robot arm operates in a fixed lo
cation; it is not on a mobile base.
The robot is run by an Interna
tional Business Machines Corp.
PC/AT computer and a robot
controller in its back. It utilizes a
Puma 260 industrial arm made by
Westinghouse Electric Corp. and
was programmed in a language
called Turbo Pascal, according to
Hammel.
The robot's new name is
DeVAR, an acronym for Desktop
Vocational Assistant Robot, be
cause the robot will soon be able
to perform many tasks such as
propping up a book or handing
over a pen that are needed in a
job setting. It will incorporate
these vocational tasks with the
daily living activities. For in
stance, it could serve the quad
riplegic lunch in the middle of the
work day, Hammel said.
The robot decreases the cost of

daily care for the quadriplegic
enormously, according to Ham
mel. She said the robot costs
about $5 per hour to run, while
an attendant is usually paid be
tween $ll and $2O per hour.
The entire robot system costs
about $43,000 and the arm itself
costs $35,000, Hammel said. The
project was funded by a grant
provided by the VA system.
Everything in the system, from
the computer to the toothpaste,
is available commercially, except
the software, according to Ham
mel. "But even the software is
public domain so anyone can use
it," Hammel said. She added,
though, that developing such a
system requires a lot of robotics
training.

The major problem that Ham
mel and Lees forsee in marketing
the robot is the speed at which
computer technology becomes
obsolete. "By the time we have it
marketed, it will be old," Ham
mel said. IBM has already come
out with a new computer system
that replaces the PC/AT line.
The dilemma the developers
will have to face will be when to
stop developing it and get it out

in the marketplace, Hammel
said. Lees, who is still working
on the project for his doctorate,
wants to expand the robot's func
tions to include more skills appli
cable to the home environment,
such as answering a telephone,
as well as those that are specifi
cally vocational functions.
"We are going to push to get
the system out into different test
ing environments by late Decem
ber," Hammel said. The robot
will first be used outside the
hospital probably at a San Jose
school where disabled people are
trained to do computer program
ming.
The San Jose school will evalu
ate the system for eight weeks,
after which they will have the
choice of.buying it, according to
Hammel. Hammel said that there
are currently three robotic arms,
but they are proposing to build iO
more to test around the country.
Larry Leifer, associate profes
sor of mechanical engineering at
Stanford, has headed the project
since it began four years ago, ac
cording to Hammel. Lees said
that the idea for the project was
conceived in the late 1970s when
Leifer first heard of this type of
robot arm. Leifer then gave some
of his students a class project to
see if they could program the arm
to help quadriplegics with daily
tasks.
A similar robotic arm on a
movable base is being developed
by two other Stanford mechani
cal engineers, Machiel Van Der
Loos and Stefan Michalowski.
This robot will have features that
the fixed arm does not. For in
stance, it will be able to see color
and detect differences in materi
als like paper and glass. It will
take another 10 years to com
plete, however, Hammel said.

The robot can
perform a variety
of tasks, including
shaving the
patient and
brushing his
teeth.
