Despite going 1-2 last week, the
Stanford field hockey team proved it
belongs among the nation's powers.
The No. 6 Cardinal opened
Thursday with a hard-fought 2-0 loss at
No. 2 Westchester University, then
Saturday absorbed a bitter 1-0 defeat
at 17th-ranked Delaware. Stanford
came back with a vengeance Sunday,
however, handing St. Joseph's a 1-0
defeat in Philadelphia. The Cardinal

now stands at 5-3 for the season.
Stanford's No. 6 ranking is its high
est national position in the history of
the Cardinal program.
"We felt we should have won the
Delaware game. We had some chances
to score but we just couldn't put it in.
It was our most consistent game,"
Stanford Coach Sheryl Johnson said.
In the Cardinal's win over St.
Joseph's, the game's lone score came
from junior forward/midfielder Missy
