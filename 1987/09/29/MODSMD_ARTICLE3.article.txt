Stanford Medical School researchers will join a
local biotechnology company in looking for new
methods to treat AIDS, U.S. Health and Human
Serices Department officials said Wednesday.
Stanford was one of 11 institutions chosen to par
ticipate in a new federally funded program designed
to expedite the application of new approaches to
the therapy of AIDS and HIV (human immune
deficiency virus) victims. The program will coor
dinate the efforts of private industry, government
agencies and academic researchers, according to

Dr Edgar Engleman, associate professor of pathol
ogy and medicine and principal project investigator
at Stanford.
Under the program, Engleman will direct a re
search group comprising scientists at Stanford and
at Gene Labs, Inc., a biotechnology company he
helped establish in Redwood City.
The group will receive approximately $3.5 mil
lion over the next five years from the National In
stitute of Health. A total of $6B million will be com
mitted to AIDS research through 1992, according
to NIH spokesperson Elaine Baldwin.
