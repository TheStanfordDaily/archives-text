# Hospital joins AIDS effort

Stanford Medical School researchers will join a
local biotechnology company in looking for new
methods to treat AIDS, U.S. Health and Human
Serices Department officials said Wednesday.
Stanford was one of 11 institutions chosen to par
ticipate in a new federally funded program designed
to expedite the application of new approaches to
the therapy of AIDS and HIV (human immune
deficiency virus) victims. The program will coor
dinate the efforts of private industry, government
agencies and academic researchers, according to

Dr Edgar Engleman, associate professor of pathol
ogy and medicine and principal project investigator
at Stanford.
Under the program, Engleman will direct a re
search group comprising scientists at Stanford and
at Gene Labs, Inc., a biotechnology company he
helped establish in Redwood City.
The group will receive approximately $3.5 mil
lion over the next five years from the National In
stitute of Health. A total of $6B million will be com
mitted to AIDS research through 1992, according
to NIH spokesperson Elaine Baldwin.
"This is an unusual program
because all the 11 groups in
volved are working with second
ary parties," Baldwin said.
"There's a peer relationship be
tween the various components
federal government, private in
dustry and academia."
Stanford and Gene Labs will
work on separate projects with
separate budgets, Engleman
said. "We want to make sure we
know who's doing what where."
However, opportunities to col
laborate will probably arise,
Engleman said. "We at Stanford
specialize in the immune system,
and Gene Labs specializes in de
signing novel agents," he said.
"If Gene Labs devised an an
tibody, we could test to see
whether it could work without af
fecting the body's natural
defense system.
"For a while we'll be using the
cocktail approach (to fight the
disease)," he said. "We must
look at various points in its life
style. Just attacking at one point

is not sufficient."
Stanford researchers are
working to develop a "killer"
lymphocyte, a type of white
blood cell that would kill cells in
fected with AIDS.
In a project based at Gene
Labs, scientists are developing
antibodies immuno-toxic con
jugates that could carry highly
poisonous molecules to kill the
virus.
"One of the things that distin
guishes AIDS from other
diseases is that the virus hides
inside the cell," Engleman ex
plained. "The immuno-toxic
conjugate is a double weapon.
The anti-body homes in on the in
fected cells; then the poison kills
them."
Currently, the most effective
drug in prolonging lives of AIDS
victims is AZT, Baldwin said.
AZT, however, has many prob
lems, according to Engleman.
"For one it's very toxic to the
bone marrow," he said. "But
more importantly it only works at
the initial stage of infection."
"AZT is not a cure," Baldwin
said. "Ultimately, this program
will bring both a cure and safe
and effective therapy."
