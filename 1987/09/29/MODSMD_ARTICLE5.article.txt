Comedians, the Stanford Band and
the rock group The Tubes will kick off
a campus-wide celebration Thursday
night designed as a first step to improve
the image of this year's four Council of
Presidents (COP) members.
According to council member Maria
Canas, the COP wants to be more ac
cessible to students and "the party will
help the image of the ASSU in gen
eral."
Running on a platform last spring
which emphasized improved communi
cation with the student body, Jim
Durkin, Leonard Adler, Maria Canas
and Roechelle Smith, this year's COP
members, see the ASSU-sponsored
dance as one step in their active effort
to change the ASSU's image.
"We don't want to be seen as a
bunch of petty bureaucrats. We want

students to have a better idea of what
the ASSU is doing," Durkin said.
According to Durkin, the party,
called the "Welcome Back to The
Farm, Go Stanford, Beat UCLA, First
Big All Campus Party," is so large
scale that the ASSU is the only student
organization with the financial capabil
ity to sponsor the event. "If we don't
put up the money, no one will," Durkin
said.
According to Adler, $lO,OOO will be
spent on the party. Adler stressed that
the money does not come from student
fees but from accumulated ASSU prof
its.
Agreeing with Durkin, Adler said the
party will kick the year off with
aplomb. "It will* show that we're here
to help the students," Adler said.
In addition to staging the party, the
COP hopes to research student inter
ests by establishing a straw poll.

"We'll poll the student body every two
weeks over the phone," Durkin said,
adding that over 100 hours of research
in statistical methods were spent this
summer to set up an accurate polling
system.
To further strengthen the COP's link
to students, each COP member plans to
attend one dorm meeting per week.
The COP will also schedule weekly of
fice hours in White Plaza to talk with
students on the run. "We held five
(office times) during the main part of
summer term. Now we'll probably hold
them on Wednesdays from 11 to 1,"
Durkin said, emphasizing that final
times have not yet been determined.
Freshmen were also targeted by the
COP's communication campaign. Ori
entation packets contained ASSU
handouts. Adler said that many fresh-
men a.4 transfer students have
already,topped by the ASSU of
fice to nquire about what the
ASSU h s to offer. "More (new
students)han I can imagine have
come by-it's quite a pleasant
surprise,'\ e said.
Canas concerned
about strenthening the commu
nication tie among women at
Stanford. "I?e set up a meeting
with all the i\portant leaders in
the women's-ommunity," she
said.

The meeting, a luncheon on
Oct. 13, is the first of Canas' ef
forts'to keep the women's com
munity informed. Canas invited
19 campus leaders to attend.
According to Durkin, the COP
has also decided to hire two com
munication assistants to help
them in their efforts to keep stu
dents informed.
A straw poll coordinator will
conduct the biweekly telephone
survey. A press chief will write
press releases concerning major
ASSU news for The Daily as well
as for local newspapers, Durkin
explained.
Durkin also said that the

ASSU news page, which appears
in The Daily, will have a more
serious format than it did last
year. The Daily page, which runs
twice a week, will be more in
formative and list ASSU job op
portunities, campus events, and
locations and times of Senate
meetings, Durkin said.
Despite ambitious strategies
for improving COP communica
tion, Durkin said he does not be
lieve in miracles. "But at least
(COP efforts) will make it easier
for (students) to think we're a
good organization if they just
know what's going on," Durkin
said.
