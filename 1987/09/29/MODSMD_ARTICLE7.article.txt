# Fatality may spur dry stadium rule

The University is "abso
lutely" prepared to ban alcohol
in Stanford Stadium if behavior
of spectators at Saturday's
UCLA-Stanford football game is
not better than it was at last
week's game, Athletic Director
Andy Geiger said yesterday.
"We're going to watch care
fully," Geiger said. "If it's a zoo,
then we'll admit that we have
failed, and we'll change."
Geiger's pledge came two days
after a game marked by the pos
sibly alcohol-related death of one
spectator, 10 citations of un
derage Stanford students for pos
session of alcohol, and at least
six fights involving spectators
who had been drinking.
Geiger, who said he was
"disappointed" by Saturday's
events, said the UCLA game is a
"last chance" for spectators to
show that they can drink respon
sibly at the stadium. In past dis
cussions of the stadium alcohol
policy, the University has main
tained that students should be
allowed to decide for themselves
the kind of behavior that is ac
ceptable in the stands.
"Once again, we're going to
appeal to this community to
please don't throw things at other
people, please don't abuse alco
hol, and please have considera
tion for those sitting next to you
and around you," Geiger said.
Dean of Student Affairs James
Lyons and Norm Robinson, as
sociate dean of Student Affairs
for Residential Education, ex
pressed support for Geiger's ul
timatum, asserting that students
have had ample opportunity to
show that they can drink respon
sibly in the stadium.
Stanford, the only member of
the Pacific 10 Conference to al
low alcohol in its stadium,
decided after a lengthy review of
the policy last spring to continue
on a probationary basis its

longstanding policy of allowing
alcohol in the stadium.
The University Committee on
Athletics, Physical Education
and Recreation said in May that
its decision represented a "trial
continuation" of its policy and
that a more permanent decision
to allow drinking was contingent
on improved behavior by specta
tors.
