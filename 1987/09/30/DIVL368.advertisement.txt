The New ASSU News
Welcome !!!
This is the first issue of the ASSU NEWS, a bi-weekly publication of the Associated Students of Stanford University. The NEWS is where we tell the students what's
going on in the ASSU-from list job opportunities to announcing upcoming events to listing Senate decisions. If you have any suggestions on how we can make the
NEWS better serve you give the Council of Presidents (Leonard, Maria, Jim & Roechelle) a call at 725-1465, since we're responsible for this.
