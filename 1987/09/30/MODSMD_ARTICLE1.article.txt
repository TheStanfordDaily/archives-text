# Asbestos cleanup continues
## 
### Ken Yew 
The cleanup of asbestos in
Lagunita Court scheduled to he
completed yesterday will not be
finished until after Thursday, ac
cording to cleanup workers at the
site.
The removal project could in
convenience residents until the
middle of next week, workers
said. For the past few weeks resi
dents have been unable to wash
their laundry or to retrieve their
possessions held in basement
storage areas.
Curtis Williams, director of
Facilities Project Management,
said the Lagunita cleanup was
slated for "the tail end of last
week" but has been delayed by
minor problems with the removal
of the asbestos from the electri
cal wiring system.
Williams described the as
bestos abatement project as
being a process of fixing "loose
ends."
The abatement project at
Lagunita has taken so long
primarily because "a fair amount
of asbestos" was discovered
during a re-wiring project over
the summer, Williams said. He
added that about 15 workers
were operating in two shifts to
remove the asbestos.
John Hughes, assistant
provost for Management and
Budget, said they were working
"lots of overtime" in an attempt
to finish the project before the
beginning of fall quarter.
The workers, wearing leak
proof suits and breathing
devices, sealed off areas and in
stalled air pumps to remove the
asbestos. The fibers were
wrapped three times before dis
posal.
The removal of asbestos in the
Lagunita basement is expected to
cost about $200,000, but the
Lagunita cleanup is only part of a
larger asbestos abatement proj
ect that will remove the danger
ous fiber from all campus build
ings. Abatement project workers
have been conducting surveys of
several other locations to deter
mine whether abatement should
proceed in those areas.
Hughes said there is currently
no risk of endangering lives here
from asbestos exposure.
However, Hughes said most
campus buildings built before
1976 probably contain some as
bestos, although most in a
relatively safe, non-friable form.
The project, which Hughes
said was initiated by the Univer
sity without government involve
ment, is expected to run for "a
very long time."
