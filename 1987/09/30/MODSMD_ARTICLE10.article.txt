# Bork's 'Massacre' role contested
## 
### 
W ASHINGTON — Two former Watergate
prosecutors yesterday strongly disputed Su
preme Court nominee Robert Bork's descrip
tion of his role in the "Saturday Night
Massacre" and its aftermath, while former
Attorney General Elliot Richardson praised
Bork as acting in the nation's best interest by
firing Watergate special prosecutor Archibald
Cox.
"1 don't want to see history rewritten just
to confirm a Supreme Court justice," Henry
Ruth Jr., Cox's deputy, told the Senate
Judiciary Committee on its second to last day
of public testimony.
Ruth and George Frampton Jr., an assis
tant prosecutor in the Watergate special pros
ecutor's office, said Bork misled the commit
tee when he testified, in 1982 during confir
mation hearings for the federal appeals court
and again two weeks ago, that he moved
promptly to assure the independence and in
tegrity of the special prosecutor's office, in
cluding its power to go after tapes of Presi
dent Richard Nixon's conversations.
On Oct. 20, 1973, Bork — who as solicitor
general was the department's top-ranking of
ficial after the resignations of Richardson and
Deputy Attorney General William Ruckel
shaus — fired Cox for defying Nixon's order
that he drop his subpoena for White House

tapes. Bork testified that he fired Cox to stop
more resignations at the Justice Department
and that he then moved promptly to ensure
the integrity and independence of the
Watergate prosecutors.
Although Bork's role in Watergate has not
been a major focus of the confirmation
hearings, Tuesday's testimony by two former
lawyers on the Watergate prosecution force
kept the issue alive and could reinforce
doubts among undecided senators about
Bork's credibility.
Frampton said Bork's actions during that
period offer a "window" on the 60-year-old
jurist, adding that "the view through that
window in several respects is a troubling one,
both with regard to the reworking of those
facts and the attitude toward executive
power."
Richardson, who resigned rather than fire
Cox, said "the nation owes a substantial debt
to Robert Bork for his service in that situa
tion .... From the outset, Bob Bork was
first of all determined to make certain the
Watergate special prosecution force was kept
intact."
Richardson said the Watergate crisis
"turned out all right ... in significant part
because of the role played by Robert H.
Bork." He acknowledged, however, that he

had no first-hand knowledge of Bork's ac
tions after his resignation.
In his testimony, Ruth said Bork was
"irrelevant" in the days following Cox's
firing and that the eventual appointment of
Leon Jaworski as successor to Cox "was a
reaction to the firestorm" caused by the
firing.
"Mr. Bork on Saturday night fired Mr.
Cox" for seeking tapes of presidential con
versations, Ruth said. "I had no reason to be
lieve that within 48 hours Mr. Bork had un
dergone a conversion and now believed we
were right" in going after the tapes.
In the days after Cox was fired, Ruth said,
"We were totally tenuous in operating. We
did not know what was going to happen . . . .
It was only after a week and a half that we
thought we were going to be back in busi
ness."
Frampton said Bork's account of the days
after Cox's firing was "absolutely un
tenable" and a "substantial reworking of the
facts."
Commenting on Bork's testimony that he
moved within 24 hours to protect the inde
pendence of the office, Frampton said, "The
facts demonstrate that those assurances were
not made and could not have been made."
