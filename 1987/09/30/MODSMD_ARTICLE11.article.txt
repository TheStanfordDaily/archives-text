# Gates promises CIA changes

PRINCETON, N.J. â€” The
deputy director of the Central In
telligence Agency said last night
that the agency has adopted new
procedures to prevent any CIA
director from carrying out inde
pendent covert actions such as
those reportedly undertaken by
the late William Casey.
Robert Gates, the agency's
deputy director, did not directly
confirm or deny a report by
reporter Bob Woodward, in The
Washington Post and in a new
book, that Casey had indepen
dently called upon the Saudi
Arabian intelligence service to
attempt the murder in March,
1985, of Sheikh Mohammed Hus
sein Fadlallah, spiritual leader of
the extremist Shiite Moslem
Hezbollah group.

But in answer to a question
about what the CIA was doing to
prevent the recurrence of such an
"off-the-books" action, Gates
said, "We are tightening up on
the procedures for the approval
of covert action."
He said the CIA also is making
a "more rigorous review" of all
proposed covert actions "to
evaluate whether it makes
sense" and ensure that they are
consistent with the law.
Gates said members of the
ClA's analytical branch, which
traditionally has had nothing to
do with the agency's operational
side, are now included in covert
operation reviews.
A senior CIA official said later
Tuesday night that the agency's
legal counselor, a congressional

affairs representative and the
CIA executive director, who is
not a member of the covert oper
ations division, are part of the
review group.
Gates' comments came during
a speech at Princeton Univer
sity's Woodrow Wilson School
of Public Law and International
Affairs on the ClA's role in
making American foreign policy.
While avoiding in his speech
the question of the agency's con
troversial conduct in the Iran
contra affair and other covert ac
tivities, Gates in a brief question
and-answer period was re
peatedly asked about the ClA's
conduct under Casey. He told
the audience that under new di
rector William Webster, the CIA
once again is concentrating on its

traditional role of gathering and
providing information to
Congress and the administration.
"You have a lot of new proce
dures and new approaches in
tended to try and make the
covert action process more ac
countable and more strictly
confined to those channels that
are appropriate and that have
been set forth by regulation and
law," Gates told one questioner.
Gates also seemed to indirectly
criticize Casey, whom critics
charge politicized intelligence to
support Reagan administration
policy objectives:
"To attempt to slant intelli
gence not only transgresses the
deepest ethical and cultural prin
ciple of the CIA.
