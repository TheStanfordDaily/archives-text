# Celebration welcomes sophomore class back
## 
### Bobby Schrader 
Newly appointed Dean of Un
dergraduate Studies Thomas
Wasow yesterday encouraged
students at the fifth annual Soph
omore Celebration to use their
second year of college to "shop
for a major."
The event, held in Frost Am
phitheater and attended by over
800 students, served both as an
official "welcome back" party
for the Class of 1990 and as a
time to honor recipients of the
President's Award for Academic
Excellence in the Freshman
Year. Forty-eight sophomores
received the prestigious award
from University President
Donald Kennedy in recognition
of outstanding academic per
formance.
Speeches by Kennedy, Wasow
and junior Nga Dang, as well as
appearances by the Dollies and
the Band, highlighted the event.
All three speakers talked about
the importance of choice in the
college experience and about the
unique choices sophomores face.
Wasow pointed out that sopho
mores have fewer restraints

imposed on them in terms of
choosing their curriculum than
do students at any other level in
college.
"Over one-third of the fresh
man course load is taken up by
the Western Culture require
ment, and juniors and seniors are
burdened by major require
ments," he said.
Kennedy prefaced his speech
with a rhetorical question about
the dilemma encountered by
most Stanford students when
they are choosing a major: "Why
should choices between things
that are clearly good give us uni
versal stress?"
Kennedy urged students to set
aside enough time to explore aca
demic alternatives rather than
follow a program that caters sim
ply to a career path.
Dang, a biology and Latin
American studies major who
recounted her experiences dig
ging latrines and studying in
Ecuador this summer, com
mented on the transition between
the freshman and sophomore
years. The sophomore year
marks "a time to go from some
thing structured to something in
dividualized," she said.
