# Branner obtains North slide show
## 
### Mark Rogowsky Editorial staff 
A slide show that was nearly
introduced as evidence at the
Iran-contra hearings will be
shown next Tuesday in Branner
Hall.
Entitled "Soviet Intervention
in the Western Hemisphere," the
slide show was shown around the
country by Lt. Col. Oliver North
in an attempt to influence people
to contribute to the Nicaraguans.
Several members of the con
gressional committee investigat
ing the Iran-contra affair, includ
ing Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-Utah),
wanted to show the slides during
the hearings to support North's
testimony and generate public
support for the contras.
"On national television, it
would have been a significant
breakthrough for Oliver North
and contra aid." said History
Prof. Kennell Jackson, the Bran
ner resident fellow.
Jackson said the show is inter
esting because it provides a good

look at the pro-contra viewpoint
as well as a "glimpse into the
minds of the administration."
The slide show and the script
that went along with it were ob
tained after a long search by
Jackson and the Branner staff
with the help of Barbara
Vucanovich (R-Nev.). "I don't
think there were a whole lot of
copies (of the show)," Jackson
said.
Branner will have two com
mentators on hand to discuss the
content of the show: Political
Science Prof. Terry Karl, who
has led congressional delegations
to Central America, and Angelo
Codevilla, a senior fellow at the
Hoover Institution who has
served as a senior staff member
of the Senate Select Intelligence
Committee.
The show will be held Tuesday
at 6:30 p.m. in the Branner
lounge. Jackson said he believed
it will be the first time the slides
have been shown in the Bay
Area.
