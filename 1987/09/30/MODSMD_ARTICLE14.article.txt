As students return to campus this fall the Uni
versity is again dotted with construction proj
ects. A major building effort is raising a new
graduate student housing complex next to Mir
rielees. Over the summer work was completed
on the Mark Taper Law Student Center, a facil
ity complete with a weight room and lounge area
but intended strictly for the use of graduate stu
dents.
Now is the time for the University to take sub
stantial steps toward the construction of new un
dergraduate housing and the improvement of
existing facilities.
Ideally , by the first day of classes all under
graduates should be settled in their residences
for the school year. But this year, as usual, many
students are either still scrambling for on
campus spots or settling for expensive, often in
conveniently located housing in neighboring
communities.
This kind of experience should not have to be
part of life at Stanford.
There is no plausible explanation for the Uni
versity's inability to guarantee four years of
housing to all undergraduates who desire it.
Stanford lacks neither the land nor the funds to
make the unguaranteed year a thing of the past.
Institutions Stanford is fond of comparing itself
to — like Harvard and Yale — have long
guaranteed their students on-campus housing for
the duration of those students' undergraduate
careers.

Some observers may argue that the unguaran
teed year inspires juniors and seniors to go over
seas or to try the off-campus experience. But
this is a feeble attempt to rationalize the housing
shortage. Students should have the option of
living on campus for four years. The choice to go
overseas or to live in a house in Palo Alto should
be a decision made freely, not by compulsion.
Disparity in the quality of on-campus housing
is also a problem that must be reckoned with.
Some dorms are beautiful while others cry out
for renovation and modernization.
Then there is the embarrassment of Manzanita
Park. Students claim they like the style of life
that Manzanita provides, but Manzanita was
supposed to be a temporary structure.
Instead of allowing students to continue living
in dilapidated mobile homes which take up a
considerable chunk of land in the core of the
campus, the University should use that land for
construction of a new residence cluster.
Such a cluster would simultaneously meet the
remaining demand for on-campus housing and, if
properly planned, provide students with the
same kind of coziness and privacy they get in the
trailers.
The Stanford Centennial Campaign has al
lotted $16 million for residences and residential
education. Now the University must put to
gether tangible plans for the use of that money
once it is raised. The construction of enough
new housing to eliminate the unguaranteed year
should be top priority in earmarking those funds.
