## Paranoia: Big Ivan may be listening 
### 
After collecting my bags at Moscow Inter
nationa] Airport, I collapsed exhausted into
the back seat of my parents' car. It was mid-
December and I was visiting Mom and Dad at
their new post for the first time.

"Welcome to Moscow, son," my father
said. "What would you like to do first?" It
was about 5 in the afternoon, it was bitterly
cold and a light snow was falling.
"Dad, I've been on a plane for the past 18
hours. Take me home and put me to bed."
"All indue time, son, but first you must go
to the embassy for your security briefing."
"My what?" Oh God.
That's just what I needed after 18 hours of
hell: to sit around for two more and listen to
some flunky tell me how I should always
keep my door locked and how I should never
get into cars with strange communists.
When we arrived at the giant building on
Tchaikovsky Street, 1 was immediately
halted by two Soviet militiamen guarding the
entrance. They apparently were there to
guard against possible defections and wanted
to make sure I wasn't a Russian.
Wow, I thought, once past the soldiers,
these communists sure are strict. What an op
pressive and restrictive society!
Once inside, I found myself standing in a
bullet-proof, bomb-proof room that acted as
an anti-terrorist/communist buffer between
the outside and the inside of the building.
"Yo! Hold it right there, mister!" came a
voice that made me think of Apollo Creed.
An enormous Marine dressed in camouflage
was glaring at me from behind a glass
encased control booth overlooking the bullet
proof room, with his hand resting ever so
slightly on the butt of his .38. I nearly sullied
my khakis.

"It's OK, Steve," said my father ner
vously from behind me, "it's just my son."
The Marine eyed me suspiciously and
demanded to see my passport. I presented it,
he looked at my picture, then at me, then at
my picture, and then at me again, smiled,
saluted and pressed a button which automati
cally unlocked the huge door in front of me.
I completely understood. The Marine had
to be like that. I mean, we wouldn't want any
suspicious communists invading this, our
metaphorical island of free enterprise in a sea
of state-controlled industry, would we? Hell,
I might have even looked like a communist
(my hair's kinda long).
When we got out of the elevator, there was
another Marine who asked to see my pass
port. He summoned someone who looked
kind of like Kojak's brother Stavros to take
us into the "Secure Room."
Now, the "Secure Room" is the only room
in the embassy you can talk safely in. Every
other place is bugged, they say. This room,
though, is made of 4-inch-thick plastic and is
monitored for bugs all the time, so we can say
anything we want in here and not worry
about a seismic shift in the balance of power
occurring as a result.
Stavros ran his fingers through his oily
hair, put his little finger briefly in his ear and
twisted it, cleared his throat and began to
speak. "The only thing there is to say," he
said, "is that you should never . . . under any
circumstances, trust a Soviet. They are all
working for the KGB. and they will all do
anything in their power to trick you into
giving them information or to cause you em
barrassment. If one approaches you on the
street, just ignore him til he goes away. In
fact, if we find out that you have been frater
nizing with the Soves, you'll be in big trou
ble. Understand?
"Not only that, but every room in your
house is bugged, so you better not say any
thing that could potentially damage the stra

tegic position of your country. Plus, you will
doubtless be followed by a KGB agent wher
ever you go when you leave the building.
1 must admit I had never been briefed
before, but I sure was glad I had been today!
Just think. If they hadn't told me about what
the Russians were really up to, I might have
ended up talking to one on a bus or some
thing, or one might have invited me over for
dinner and then would have tricked me into
revealing secrets about my country, even
though I didn't know any. I was happy to
know the score. Those sneaky devils.
Christmas came and went (they don't even
get to take the day off there) and my parents
decided to have a New Year's Eve party at
our house. I drank lots of champagne, and
when 12 o'clock finally came around, I was
pretty drunk. We made the countdown, and I
started thinking about how much fun we were
having and how all the Soviets had to sit there
in their one-room apartments, huddled
around their tiny gas heaters, drinking cheap
vodka on New Year's Eve.
1 thought about how free and wonderful
America was and how grim and solemn Rus
sia was. 1 got real excited and told everyone
in the room to quiet down so 1 could make a
toast.
1 raised my glass of champagne, and said
loudly with a slight slur, "Here's to the poor
bastards who have to spend New Year's Eve
suffering in a cold basement somewhere mon
itoring the bugs planted here in our house and
who have to listen to us while we have fun!"
Everyone laughed and clapped and clinked
glasses and drank. I could tell that they, too,
were grateful they were American.
A minute or so later the telephone rang.
Neither of my parents looked like they were
going to answer it, so 1 walked over, picked it
up and said, "Hello?"
I heard the sound of a popping champagne
cork, and the line went dead.
