## Ueberroth decision harms blacks 
### 
As most sports followers in the world
know, several months ago Al Campanis [then
the general manager of the Los Angeles
Dodgers] made certain derogatory statements
about black athletes "... not having the
necessities" for front-office management
jobs. It is not what Campanis said that is be
coming troublesome; it was a view known to
most followers of athletics.

It is what followed Campanis's statements
that is causing many increasing concern:
baseball Commissioner Peter Ueberroth's ap
pointment of Harry Edwards, a UC-Berkeley
sociology professor, as his special assistant
to examine the prospects for minority ad
vancement in baseball. The compelling ques
tion is this: Does Edwards have "the neces
sities" to accomplish the desired objectives?
Campanis is not an owner and does not
necessarily know how owners think; and
most know it is what the owners do that is the

bottom line â€” not what they think. Edwards'
efforts will be misguided if he directs his at
tention to the thoughts of vice presidents and
former vice presidents in organized baseball
(or any professional sport).
Another "necessity" is professional and
academic integrity. In an address before the
Commonwealth Club of San Francisco in
September, Edwards boasted that, in the
writing of his dissertation in 1973, he created
a new discipline, "sports sociology." Ed
wards may have created a new title, but he
definitely did not create a new discipline. For
example, many foreign countries have
adopted sports programs that are rooted in
nationalism, and much has been researched
and written about such programs for at least
fifty years.
Another "necessity" is the respect Ed
wards receives on the field and in the club
house. I question whether most current (and
recent) black professional athletes respect
Edwards; instead, most probably regard him
with great suspicion. Without the widespread
support of black athletes, Edwards' mission
will be difficult, if not impossible.
An additional "necessity" is the respect
Edwards receives from the black community.

Whatever it is at this stage, it appears to be
diminishing due to arrogant public statements
he has made since his appointment
(coronation).
One has to question the motives of the
owners and the commissioner in appointing
Edwards. If their appointee is not serious and
respected, how can they be serious and
respected? Edwards' appointment can only
be viewed as diversionary, cosmetic and en
tertaining to some, but certainly disrespectful
to the black community. Edwards can change
this; otherwise, the black community must
insure that he is not viewed as the sole soul
authority on the black community.
The athletic industrial complex has a can
cerous grip on the youth of the black commu
nity. and it is seizing the minds of black youth
at lower and lower age levels. This is no place
for Edwards' theatrics. If he is to be efTec
tive, he must "run silent; run deep." In con
trast, his statements have been boisterous
and sophomoric. His jaded couplets must be
replaced by maturity and vision, rather than
manure and visibility.
