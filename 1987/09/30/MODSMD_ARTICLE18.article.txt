Marguerite drivers
are underpaid
This is a request to all people
who use or ride the Marguerite
daily. This service is provided by
Stanford and contracted by St.
Clair Transportation. Every Mar
guerite driver loves his custom

ers and is doing his best to pro
vide you the best service possible
in a professional and dignified
way. Our problems with our
employers revolve around
wages.
We are protesting the hourly
wage of $4.35 for Marguerite
drivers and want to see our
wages raised to $6 an hour.
