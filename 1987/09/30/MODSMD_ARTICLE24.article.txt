## Dean to stress intellectualism 
### Steve Lippman 
Thomas Wasow, newly ap
pointed dean of Undergradu
ate Studies and associate dean
of Humanities and Sciences,
hopes Stanford students will
"make the academic part of
life more central" to their time
at Stanford.
Wasow, professor of lin
guistics and philosophy, began
his three-year term as the new
dean on the first of this month.
He succeeds Assoc. History
Prof. Carolyn Lougee, who
stepped down from the posi

teaching.
Wasow said his main goal is
to emphasize the academic
aspects of undergraduate edu

Wasow added that he
believes the widely accepted
view that Stanford students
don't value intellectualism "is
not entirely without basis."
Students should place less
value on academic success

curiousity, he said.
Students' tendency to
devalue intellectualism is one
Wasow said he is "not entirely
happy with."
Wasow would like to estab

as their students. He sugges

the one in which graduate pro
fessors are given research
grants might foster positive
competition in undergraduate
teaching. In addition, such a
program would increase the
status of such teachers, he
said.
Wasow has a "long history
of commitment to undergradu
ate education," according to
Dean of Humanities and
Sciences Norman Wessells,
who chaired the committee
that selected him.
Wasow has been an aca
demic adviser to freshmen and
sophomores, and has dealt
with undergraduate curricula
issues as chairman of the De
partment of Linguistics. Wes
sells said Wasow has the repu
tation of being a thoughtful
teacher, which fit the commit
tee's criteria that the new dean
would have to be "responsive
to undergraduates."
Although Wasow has taught
at Stanford since 1973, he said
he is still learning about the re
sources available for under
graduate education. The most
