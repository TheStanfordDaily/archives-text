## Dean to stress intellectualism 
### Steve Lippman 
Thomas Wasow, newly ap
pointed dean of Undergradu
ate Studies and associate dean
of Humanities and Sciences,
hopes Stanford students will
"make the academic part of
life more central" to their time
at Stanford.
Wasow, professor of lin
guistics and philosophy, began
his three-year term as the new
dean on the first of this month.
He succeeds Assoc. History
Prof. Carolyn Lougee, who
stepped down from the posi
tion last spring to return to
teaching.
Wasow said his main goal is
to emphasize the academic
aspects of undergraduate edu
cation on the faculty and stu
dent level.
Wasow added that he
believes the widely accepted
view that Stanford students
don't value intellectualism "is
not entirely without basis."
Students should place less
value on academic success
and place more on intellectual
curiousity, he said.
Students' tendency to
devalue intellectualism is one
Wasow said he is "not entirely
happy with."
Wasow would like to estab

lish incentive programs for un
dergraduate professors as well
as their students. He sugges
ted that a program similar to
the one in which graduate pro
fessors are given research
grants might foster positive
competition in undergraduate
teaching. In addition, such a
program would increase the
status of such teachers, he
said.
Wasow has a "long history
of commitment to undergradu
ate education," according to
Dean of Humanities and
Sciences Norman Wessells,
who chaired the committee
that selected him.
Wasow has been an aca
demic adviser to freshmen and
sophomores, and has dealt
with undergraduate curricula
issues as chairman of the De
partment of Linguistics. Wes
sells said Wasow has the repu
tation of being a thoughtful
teacher, which fit the commit
tee's criteria that the new dean
would have to be "responsive
to undergraduates."
Although Wasow has taught
at Stanford since 1973, he said
he is still learning about the re
sources available for under
graduate education. The most
exciting aspect of his new posi
tion, he said, is learning about
the many programs available to
undergraduates.
Wasow said he expects to con
tinue "in the same direction as
Dean Lougee, picking up where
she left off' in such programs as
undergraduate research. He ex
pects the Golden Grant program,
which provides humanities stu
dents with funds to pursue re
search projects, to continue in
the same form in which it existed
during Lougee's term.
As dean, Lougee established
the "writing-intensive" courses
and pushed for the new Fresh
man English requirements.
Other programs completed in
recent years include reorganizing
the Center for Teaching and
Learning, which offers learning
strategies courses and tutoring
for students, and providing more

opportunities for undergraduate
research.
Lougee won the Dinkelspiel
Award in 1980 for her service to
undergraduate education.
Lougee resigned to return to
teaching after her second three
year term as dean, and is taking a
sabbatical to complete a book
she is in the process of writing.
Wasow served as chairman of
the committee that developed an
inter-departmental major in sym
bolic systems in 1986.
Impressed with the Under
graduate Studies staff, Wasow
said, "We have the people in
place to do exciting things."
However, Wasow has not yet
developed a specific agenda. He
said it will probably take him be
tween six months and a year to
"learn the ropes" and "see
what's feasible."
Wessells said he expects
Wasow's term as dean to be
"active," not simply a continua
tion of past trends in undergradu
ate education at Stanford.
