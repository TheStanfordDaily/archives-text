## Recycled summer a success 
### James Lujan Editorial staff 
You probably didn't realize it,
but when you plunked down $10
this summer for you and a date to
see a Friday night movie, you
were contributing to the most
successful summer movie season
ever.
According to industry trade
papers, the summer of 1987 was
the highest-grossing summer to
date. How and why the summer

movie season met with such
sucess is a sad testimony to the
current state of creative affairs in
Hollywood.
I managed to sneak a peak at
most of the big summer releases.
While some were entertaining,
almost all of them were totally
devoid of originality, daring or
fresh storytelling approaches.
Actually, that is probably why
it was such a profitable summer
for the movie industry.
Most movie producers bank on

the assumption that the movie
going audience only wants to in
vest its money in films that are
safe bets for predictable, easygo
ing entertainment. Moviegoers
who thrive on familiarity are
more likely to see a movie from
which they know they can expect
fast-paced action or characters
made familiar in previous
movies.
Unfortunately, the assump
tions that movie producers make
about their audiences, almost al

ways pay off.
The result of all this is that
movies that are original, daring
and challenging have less of a
chance to be a success because
the majority of the movie-going
public is not inclined to take risks
on such films. As a result, the
road to success this summer was
paved with remakes and sequels,
big name stars and action
adventures. A movie taking any

or all of these routes was almost
guaranteed hit status.
Remakes and sequels were
everywhere. The summer started
off with a hang with "The Un
touchables," an updating of the
old TV series. Kevin Costner was
wooden as Elliot Ness and the
story sometimes got sappy, hut
there was some good violence
and a good supporting cast led hy
Robert De Niro (doing his
patented Joe Palooka routine in
the part of Al Capone) and Sean
Connery (finally showing what a
good actor he really is). Most
critics loved the film and
audiences did. too.
Critics were not quite as kind
to "Dragnet," a less serious trib
ute to its TV predecessor, with
Dan Ackroyd doing a good job as
a new Friday and the always
funny Tom Hanks lending able
support as his sidekick. It's a
shame that the script wasn't
funny, too.

In"The Living Daylights,"
Timothy Dalton made his debut
as the safe sex generation's an
swer to James Bond. There was
plenty of two-fisted action but
not nearly enough of Bond's
renowned action with the oppo
site sex.
Speaking of action, it didn't
matter that "Beverly Hills Cop
II" had no plot, had no laughs
and had no interesting charac
ters. What it did have was a lot of
action and a lot of Eddie
Murphy. Apparently, that's all it
took to make this lame sequel a
hit.
Another way to ensure the suc
cess of a movie this summer was
to have a big name star attached.
Jack Nicholson's marquee value
proved potent as the inane
"Witches of Eastwick" grossed
a pretty penny.
Meanwhile, Richard Dreyfuss,
who had revived his career with a
pair of recent successes ("Down
and Out in Beverly Hills" and
"Tin Men") struck gold again
with "Stakeout," an enjoyable
though predictable cop drama.
Costner, riding the coattails of

his triumph in"The Un
touchables," scored another
knockout with "No Way Out,"
which, apart from its ridiculous
ending, was a well-acted, enter
taining, edge-of-your-seat thril
ler.
The final alternate pathway to
glory this summer was to make a
violent action-adventure film. In
"Predator," Arnold Schwar
zenegger played a commando
who gets involved with terrorists
and a creature and foils both with
lots of macho gunplay. In other
words, the movie was a real
change of pace for him.
More successful and more en
joyable was "Robocop," which
beneath the surface was a funny
and sardonic look at the corpo
rate world of the future.
So, after a financially success
ful summer like this, is Holly
wood doomed to a self
perpetuating cycle of derivative,
unadventurous, formulaic films?
Not necessarily. There were a
few films which managed to defy
the odds â€” films which didn't
come off the Hollywood assem
bly line of pre-packaged hits.

These films weren't necessarily
good, but at least they were dif
ferent.
An example of this was "La
Bamba," a well-acted though su
perficial and highly predictable
telling of the short life and insig
nificant times of rock star Richie
Valens.
Steve Martin finally hit it big
again with the innocuously pleas
ant "Roxanne," an updating of
Edmund Rostand's play,
"Cyrano De Bergerac."
Another guy who finally made
it big was Stanley Kubrick.
Kubrick has never enjoyed
widespread box office accep
tance, but "Full Metal Jacket,"
his vision of Vietnam, scored im
pressively. It's my favorite film
of the summer and, so far, my fa
vorite film of the year.
All in all, though, while films
like "La Bamba," "Roxanne"
and "Full Metal Jacket" did
well, they were exceptions to the
rule that says that a movie can
only follow a tried and true for
mula before it can be successful.
It's a sad fact, but the box office
numbers speak for themselves.
