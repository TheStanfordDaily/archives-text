# TV redefines Vietnam War
## 
### James Lujan Editorial Staff 
After the appearance of
"Hamburger Hill," one of the
worst movies of the summer,
it seemed the recent glut of
Vietnam movies and TV
shows, which have virtually
milked the subject for all it's
worth, would finally come to
an end.
Not so. After the $130 mil
lion success of "Platoon"
proved that Vietnam was hot
commercial property, it was
only a matter of time before
television reared its ugly rip
off head. So, before you could
say "Ho Chi Minh," CBS has
announced that it was produc
ing a TV series about the fight
ing men in Vietnam.
"Tour of Duty" premiered
last Thursday. It was an OK
TV show with good intentions,
but it was nothing special.
The inherent problem here
is that "Tour of Duty" is a
program with a topic too im

portant and too volatile to be
trapped within the limiting,
censor-conscious confines of
network television.
There are already signs, in
fact, that the series will buckle
to the network censor. For in
stance, the producers have
said that while there will be
gunfire and explosions, there
will be no torn, bloody limbs
flying all over the place; drug
use will be downplayed; and,
of course, no one will be able
to say the "F" word.
In effect, the producers are
saying that they will tone
down the violence, the drugs
and the language of Vietnam.
Clearly, realism is getting top
priority here.
A TV series like
"M.A.S.H." was able to get
away with downplaying the
brutal side of the war because
of the intrinsically unrealistic
framework of the situation
comedy and because the
Korean War took place at a less
chaotic time in American history.
The Vietnam War, on the other
hand, occurred during a time of
social upheaval during which
drug use was as rampant in the
war as in the counterculture back
home. Also, if a sergeant had
never yelled anything worse than
a "hell" or a "damn" he would
have lost all respect from his men
and then been laughed out of his

platoon for being offended by the
"F" word.
If "Tour of Duty," with its 60-
minute, dramatic, tell-it-like-it-is
approach wants to remain true to
its subject, it will have to find
some way to stop pulling
punches and present Vietnam in
all its blood-and-guts, drug
laden, profanity-inundated glory.
Otherwise, the show faces the
prospect of trivializing the war
and degenerating into a standard
"war is hell" drama operating at
the same superficial level as
"Combat" or "Hogan's He
roes."
