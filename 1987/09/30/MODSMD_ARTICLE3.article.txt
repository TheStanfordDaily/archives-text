# Res Ed warning
## Memo cautions football fans 
### Mark Lawrence Senior staff writer 
Norm Robinson, associate
dean of Student Affairs for Resi
dential Education, yesterday
called on University residence
staff members to urge students to
control their behavior during Sat
urday's Stanford-UCLA football
game, lest the University be
forced to ban alcohol in Stanford
Stadium.
"The simple truth of the mat
ter is that if students are unable
or unwilling to behave respon
sibly on their own, the Univer
sity will have to take steps to
ensure that they do," Robinson
said in a memorandum that resi
dent fellows and resident assis
tants will receive today.
In a separate development,
Athletic Director Andy Geiger

said yesterday that in the next
three days he and University
President Donald Kennedy
would review the University's
policy concerning alcohol in the
stadium. Geiger would not rule
out the possibility that alcohol
could be banned in the stadium
for Saturday's game.
Geiger said he and Kennedy
will consider a report by Stanford
Police Chief Marvin Herrington
concerning a series of alcohol
related incidents that marred last
Saturday's Stanford-San Jose
State game. They will also con
sult with Dean of Student Affairs
James Lyons and other Univer
sity officials in their review,
Geiger said.
University officials said Mon
day that they would ban alcohol
in the stadium if behavior of
spectators at the UCLA game is
not better than it was last week.
Geiger called the upcoming game
a "last chance" for students to
show that they can drink respon
sibly during football games.
The San Jose State game was
marked by the possibly alcohol
related death of 23-year-old San
Jose resident Matthew Carlyle,
the citations of 10 students under
the age of 21 for possession of al
cohol, six fights in the stands and
six reports of spectators throw
ing beer cans and other debris.
Despite the unusually high
number of incidents, students
and administrators interviewed

this week said they believe the
disruptions were caused by a
small number of spectators and
that, in general, conditions in the
stands during last week's game
were relatively calm.
In his letter, Robinson said stu
dents, by their unruly behavior,
are jeopardizing the right the
University gives them "to moni
tor and control their own behav
ior." In past evaluations of Stan
ford alcohol policies, the Univer
sity has repeatedly maintained
that students should decide stan
dards of acceptable behavior for
themselves.
"Students must understand
that it will be their own behavior
that will determine the future of
the policies regarding what can
and cannot be brought into the
stadium and where students will
be allowed to sit," Robinson
said.

Stanford, after considering a
proposal last spring to ban alco
hol in the stadium, decided to
continue to allow alcohol in the
stadium on a probationary basis.
Stanford is the only member of
the Pacific 10 Conference that al
lows alcohol in its stadium.
The University Committee on
Athletics, Physical Education
and Recreation said in May that
its decision represented a "trial
continuation" of its policy and
that a more permanent decision
to allow drinking was contingent
on good behavior by spectators.
"If conduct in the stadium
does not improve substantially
and immediately, then some or
all of the proposals that were
considered by the Athletic De
partment last spring . . . will un
doubtedly be implemented, much

to the displeasure of many,"
Robinson said in the memo.
The letter asked residence staff
members to inform students of
the University's position and to
give Residential Education ideas
for effective responses. The staff
members should receive the let
ter today.
Controversy over the stadium
alcohol policy arose less than a
day after Kennedy gave a strong
condemnation of student alcohol
abuse in his welcome address to
the incoming freshman class
Friday night.
In addition to the incidents at
the game, six underage students
walking on campus Saturday
night were cited by police for
possession of alcohol. Herring
ton said police will continue to
enforce the 21-year-old drinking
age on campus, and especially at
football games.
