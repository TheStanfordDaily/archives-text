# Res Ed warning
## Memo cautions football fans 
### Mark Lawrence Senior staff writer 
Norm Robinson, associate
dean of Student Affairs for Resi
dential Education, yesterday
called on University residence
staff members to urge students to
control their behavior during Sat
urday's Stanford-UCLA football
game, lest the University be
forced to ban alcohol in Stanford
Stadium.
"The simple truth of the mat
ter is that if students are unable
or unwilling to behave respon
sibly on their own, the Univer
sity will have to take steps to
ensure that they do," Robinson
said in a memorandum that resi
dent fellows and resident assis
tants will receive today.
In a separate development,
Athletic Director Andy Geiger

said yesterday that in the next
three days he and University
President Donald Kennedy
would review the University's
policy concerning alcohol in the
stadium. Geiger would not rule
out the possibility that alcohol
could be banned in the stadium
for Saturday's game.
Geiger said he and Kennedy
will consider a report by Stanford
Police Chief Marvin Herrington
concerning a series of alcohol
related incidents that marred last
Saturday's Stanford-San Jose
State game. They will also con
sult with Dean of Student Affairs
James Lyons and other Univer
sity officials in their review,
Geiger said.
University officials said Mon
day that they would ban alcohol
