It wasn't supposed to be this easy.
The Stanford women's volleyball team
defeated California last night at Harmon
Gym in Berkeley 15-10, 15-1, 15-8. The
Cardinal is now 8-3 overall and stands
alone in second place in the Pacific 10
Conference with a 4-1 record. Cal
dropped to 5-6, 2-3 in Pac-10 play.
Stanford went into the match looking
for a tough fight. The Bears were not only
playing at home but were also coming off
a pair of league wins last weekend against
Washington and Washington State. The
Cardinal, on the other hand, was not
supposed to be in top form.
Stanford had also beaten both the
Huskies and Cougars last weekend but
went into the match with a big question
mark. Senior outside hitter Teresa Smith
injured her ankle Friday night against
WSU and was unable to play Saturday.
The Cardinal received a big lift,
however, when Smith, who set a school
record with 563 kills last year, started last
night despite being listed as questionable
for the match.
In fact, Smith did much more than just
start. She recorded a match-high 19 kills
and a .571 hitting percentage. The Playa
Del Rey native also led the Cardinal with
14 digs and had three aces with her jump
serve.
Other top hitters for Stanford were
senior Nancy Reno, with 14 kills, and

junior Laura Olesen, who added eight.
Not only did the Cardinal hit well, hut
Stanford also shut down Cal's attack.
"Overall, this was one of our better
matches blocking," Stanford Asst.
Coach Ruben Nieves said.
The statistics don't reflect a dominant
blocking performance, but the Cardinal
was able to take away the Bear hitters' fa
vorite shots, forcing them to try lower
percentage attacks. "I think we forced
them into a few hitting errors," Nieves
said.
The blocking scheme also made it
easier for the backcourt players to dig
balls. Besides Smith's 14 digs, Reno had
13 and sophomore Lara Asper had 12, all
high totals for such a short match.
For Cal, freshman Lisa Arce had 13
kills and senior Kelly Moomaw had eight.
Sophomore Tiffany Rochelle, who made
the All-Pac-10 Freshman team last year,
was held to only seven kills and
commited five hitting errors. The Cardi
nal virtually eliminated the Bears' middle
attack.
Asper and junior Amy Hayes, who
both stepped into the starting lineup this
season, had particularly strong matches.
Asper, a 5-foot-11 right-side hitter, and
Hayes, a 5-10 left-side hitter, took the
starting spots of 1987 graduates Barbra
Fontana and Brooke Hahner. "1 think

Sophomore Jenny Chaffee (7) and her Stanford teammates clobbered
Pac-10 rival California last night in Harmon Gym. The Cardinal is 8-3
on the season, with all three losses on the road against top-10 teams.
Amy and Asper had their best all
around matches of the season,"
Nieves said. "Both hit well and
they carried out their blocking
assignments."
Stanford's next match is to
morrow night in the opening
round of the Jostens' Invitational
Tournament. The Cardinal takes
on No. 13 UC-Santa Barbara at 6
p.m. at Maples Pavilion. The
second semifinal pits Cal against
I Ith-ranked Texas.
Friday night the consolation
match begins at 6 p.m., and the
championship match is sched
uled for 8 p.m.
Following the tournament,
Stanford travels to San Jose
State and will attempt to avenge
the two losses it suffered against

the Spartans last season. The
Cardinal then heads north to take
on Oregon State and Oregon.
With wins over both teams, Stan
ford can take the Pac-10 lead
from the 12th-ranked Ducks.
Card Notes
In the latest American Volleyball
Coaches Association poll, released
yesterday, Stanford remained in fifth
place. The Cardinal is behind (in or
der) Pacific, Hawaii, Brigham Young
and Nebraska.
The Pac-10 appears to be the
toughest volleyball conference in the
nation. Five teams (Stanford,
UCLA, Oregon, Arizona and USC)
are ranked in the top 20, with
Arizona State and Washington just
missing the top 20.
The Cardinal also plays one of the
toughest schedules in the nation.
Stanford plays 18 matches against
top-20 teams this year, including two
matches each against No. I UOPand
No. 2 Hawaii.
