# Baseball year makes up for football follies
## 
### 
The news is not good on the football front, what
with the NFL strike and Stanford's 0-3 start. But
that's OK, because it's still baseball season.
And what a baseball season! I mean, the Giants
won their division! The San Francisco Giants. The
baseball Giants.
People from out of state, or even from the lower
portion of California, probably don't understand
the enormity of this event. Cleveland fans, per
haps, might relate. Seattle fans will empathize in a
few more years.
It has been 16 years since the guys in the Hallow
een colors won a division title. To put this in per
spective, the same year that the Giants won their
last division title, the Beatles had just broken up,
Richard Nixon was President of the United States,
Richard Lyman was president of the University

and the Stanford Indians played in their second
straight Rose Bowl. Most of this year's freshmen
were about 2 years old.
I was 5 years old, and though I grew up in the
Bay Area, I didn't even know who the Giants were
in the early 19705. Those were the years of the Oak
land A's dynasty — Reggie Jackson, Catfish
Hunter, Joe Rudi, Vida Blue, Rollie Fingers . . .
that was the team to follow in Northern California.

My first memories of the
Giants are from the stormy late
'70s. Joe Altobelli's and Frank
Robinson's Giants. The ques
tions that were often asked were
"Do we fire Altobelli/
Robinson?" and "Do we trade
Montefusco/Moffitt/M in ton?"
"When will Jack Clark stop com
plaining?" "Will the Giants
move to Denver?" "Should
Candlestick be demolished?"
Ah, but things began to change
last year under Roger Craig and
Al Rosen. Suddenly, Giant
pitchers all had split-finger
fastballs. Mike Krukow won 20
games. A new Clark — Will —
was emerging as a star first
baseman.
This year was a true joy.
Former Stanford star Mike
Aldrete proved that he's a dan
gerous hitter, particularly in the
clutch. Jeffrey Leonard finally
emerged as a leader. Craig made
all the right moves and Rosen's
deals shored up an oft-injured
pitching corps.
Baseball season has been suc
cessful even closer to home, with

the Stanford baseball team win
ning the College World Series in
June. Since the championships
took place during Dead Week
and finals, and because the
games could only be seen on
ESPN and there is no cable TV in
Palo Alto, this feat did not get the
recognition it otherwise would
have received, although a num
ber of students turned out to
welcome the team home from
Omaha.
The Stanford team is the
champion of college baseball —
best in the country. They beat
Texas. They beat Oklahoma
State. Paul Carey, just a fresh
man, was Most Valuable Player
of the series.
To make the victory all the
more impressive, Stanford won
the series in the middle of finals.
Six of the other seven teams in
Omaha were already out of
school, and the other school in
session, Georgia, lost in the first
round.
Stanford team members were
taking finals the day of the cham
pionship game. Talk about
making life difficult.
The good year has continued
for some Cardinal players. Third
baseman Ed Sprague played for
the U.S. Pan American team
over the summer. Outfielder Toi
Cook turned to football and is

now a defensive back for the
New Orleans Saints. (The real
Saints, not the strike team.) And
hard-throwing Jack McDowell
was called up by the Chicago
White Sox in September and
since then has gone 2-0 in three
starts.
The right-hander should be 3-0
after throwing seven innings of
two-hit, shutout ball against the
A sin Oakland last Friday night,
but wound up not getting a deci
sion. McDowell sure looked
good, though, with seven strike
outs, including a whiff of mighty
Mark McGwire, the major league
leader in home runs.
Another Stanford grad cur
rently making good this year is
Baltimore Oriole second
baseman Pete Stanicek, who
graduated in 1985 after three trips
to the College World Series with
the Cardinal. Stanicek got a pair
of hits and a stolen base in Bal
timore's victory over Detroit
Monday, and also drove in the
game-winning run. One of
Stanicek's teammates at Stan
ford, pitcher Jeff Ballard, is also
on the Baltimore roster.
There's only one negative
aspect to all of this. It's going to
be a hard baseball season to top,
especially if the Giants win the
World Series.And that is looking
like a definite possibility.
