# Baseball year makes up for football follies
## 
### 
The news is not good on the football front, what
with the NFL strike and Stanford's 0-3 start. But
that's OK, because it's still baseball season.
And what a baseball season! I mean, the Giants
won their division! The San Francisco Giants. The
baseball Giants.
People from out of state, or even from the lower
portion of California, probably don't understand
the enormity of this event. Cleveland fans, per
haps, might relate. Seattle fans will empathize in a
few more years.
It has been 16 years since the guys in the Hallow
een colors won a division title. To put this in per
spective, the same year that the Giants won their
last division title, the Beatles had just broken up,
Richard Nixon was President of the United States,
Richard Lyman was president of the University

and the Stanford Indians played in their second
straight Rose Bowl. Most of this year's freshmen
were about 2 years old.
I was 5 years old, and though I grew up in the
Bay Area, I didn't even know who the Giants were
in the early 19705. Those were the years of the Oak
land A's dynasty â€” Reggie Jackson, Catfish
Hunter, Joe Rudi, Vida Blue, Rollie Fingers . . .
that was the team to follow in Northern California.
