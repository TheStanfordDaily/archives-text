# Search for pollutants continues
## 
### Erin Martin Senior staff writer 
The source of toxic pollution de
tected last spring at the old Mayfield
School site on Stanford land is still un
known, a University official said yes
terday.
Paula Kakimoto, property manager
for the Stanford Department of Lands
Management, said the University is
continuing to work with Hewlett-
Packard and Varian Associates Labora
tories in a joint effort to clean up the
contamination and trace its source.
The pollution poses no immediate
threat to people, health officials say,
but local residents are worried that the
toxics may taint area wells. The wells
may be needed by residents if the area
loses its present source of water, the
Hetch Hetchy Reservoir.
The contaminated site, which is
owned by Stanford, is located adjacent
to Varian and H-P near the corner of El
Camino Real and Page Mill Road in the
Stanford Industrial Park.
The University, though not responsi

ble for any of the contamination, has
been made responsible for cleanup be
cause it owns the property. If the
source of the contamination is not
found, Stanford is legally responsible
for the financial burden of cleanup.
The H-P and Varian plants, which
have been cited for other incidents of
toxic leakage, border the polluted site
and have been included in the Depart
ment of Health Services (DHS) order
to assist in detecting sources of the
chemicals.
Kakimoto stated that the University
will seek the responsible party in the
event that it should have to assume the
financial responsibility.
However, "it is not clear that
Hewlett-Packard or Varian is the
source of the contamination," she said.
The joint cleanup was ordered by the
DHS in July.
The DHS will deliver a final revised
version of the request to the Hazardous
Materials Coordinating Council Oct.
22.
The request details the identification
and cleanup process. According to

Kakimoto, the order establishes a July,
1989, deadline for completion of the
project.
The cleanup work continuing on the
Mayfield School site is part of an effort
to eliminate toxic contamination first
detected in the Stanford Industrial Park
about two years ago.
The DHS and the Regional Water
Quality Control Board have traced
much of the contamination in the park
to chemical leaks from various indus
tries in the park. Some of the pollution
has contaminated private wells in parts
of Palo Alto, including Barron Park and
College Terrace.
According to Kakimoto, testing has
not yet provided the information neces
sary to pinpoint the pollution sources
at the Mayfield School site.
The most recent test results,
released by the DHS Aug. 20, show a
"number of hot spots at the site," said
Kakimoto.
"The DHS is not as interested in
finding the party responsible for the
contamination as they are in cleaning it
up," she said.
