### 
Monday's Daily incorrectly
identified graduate student Steve
Jurichich as the person who
helped an injured student after a
Bookstore roof accident. In
stead, the article should have
named senior Steve Jurvitson as
that person.
The names below pictures of
James Joyce and Samuel Beckett
in Monday's Daily were acciden
tally transposed.
A map in yesterday's Daily in
correctly portrayed the proposed
Sand Hill Road extention. The
proposal is to link Sand Hill with
El Camino Real and possibly
with Alma Street.
An article in yesterday's Daily
failed to note that tomorrow's In
ner Quad party is co-sponsored
by the Concert Network and the
Orientation Committee.
