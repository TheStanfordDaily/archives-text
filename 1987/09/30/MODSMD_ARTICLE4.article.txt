# Stanford involved in bid to host Olympics

Stanford University is reluctantly
cooperating with San Francisco in its bid
to host the XXV Olympiad to be held in
1996, according to Athletic Director Andy
Geiger.
"We have made no commitment, but
we are cooperating and participating at
this level," Geiger said. "We are not
wildly enthusiastic about it."
State Sen. Quentin Kopp (Indep.-San
Francisco), the major proponent of a Bay
Area Olympiad, said San Francisco has "a
50/50 chance" of being selected by the
United States Olympic Committee
(USOC). But Geiger called the possibility
"an incredible longshot."
Atlanta, Ga., Nashville, Tenn. and
Minneapolis-St. Paul, Minn, have also
submitted bids to the USOC.
According to Geiger, if the Olympics

were to come to the Bay Area, Stanford
would host both the opening and closing
ceremonies, the track and field events and
the swimming. The University would also
house between 7000 and 8000 athletes.
"(Housing the athletes) would not even
be remotely possible." Geiger said, citing
the problems of feeding so many people
from so many nations, as well as the bu
reaucratic structure required.
However. Kopp said that Stanford
would benefit from hosting Olympic
events.
" The Stadium would gain an eighth lane
for the track and field events, and added
comforts," Kopp said. Additional stands
would also be built for the swimming
events.
"The eyes of the world would be on
Stanford, even more so than the Super
Bowl," which was held in Stanford
Stadium in 1985, he added.
But Geiger dismissed Kopp's compari

son of the Super Bowl and the Olympics,
noting that the Super Bowl was a one-time
event, whereas the Olympics would in
volve capacity crowds several times each
day for a period of two weeks.
While Kopp praised Stanford's
facilities, Gieger expressed reservations
about Stanford's suitability as an Olympic
site. "The University is not promoting the
Olympics, because we are located in the
middle of a residential area," Geiger said.
Geiger acknowledged, however, that if
the Olympics were to come to San Fran
cisco, Stanford would have to be a part of
hosting the games.
"We are a part of the community,"
Geiger said. "Stanford shouldn't slam the
door when we have much to offer, in spite
of our concerns."
According to Kopp. a panel will meet
Oct. 4 to formulate a recommendation for
the USOC executive board, which will
decide Oct. 26 which of the four sites to

consider. Representatives from the USOC
will then travel to the contending cities
and end the process with a final meeting in
January, 1988. At this meeting, the cities
will try to enhance their bids.
Fund raising efforts have fallen behind
for the San Francisco effort. According to
Kopp, the Bay Area Olympic Committee
has raised only $35,(XX) of the necessary
$250,000, but fund raising is continuing.
Looking farther ahead, Kopp com
mented on foreign cities also bidding for
the 19% Olympics. "Several interesting
things have happened internationally," he
said. "Paris has withdrawn from the bid
ding process in favor of Athens, Greece.
Athens has been having financial difficul
ties, and Toronto, Canada has made a
robust effort."
Athens is considered to be the sen
timental favorite to host the Olympics in
1996, the centennial year of the modern
Olympics.
