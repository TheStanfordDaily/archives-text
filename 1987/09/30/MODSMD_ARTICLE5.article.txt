After a year of struggling with
poor management, directors of
Students United for Rape Elimi
nation (SURE) Escort Service
hope a new school year and new
membership in the ASSU will
revive their underutilized pro
gram.
"Our biggest goal this year is
to increase our usership," said
junior Katie Voth, one of three
SURF directors. The other two

directors are junior Bridget Lar
son and sophomore Michelle
Hohnke.
"Last year, on a good night we
got three calls. Sometimes we
didn't get a call at all," Voth said.
She said the service is mostly
used by graduate students and
University employees.
SURE was established in
March, 1979, after numerous at
tacks on women in the Stanford
community in the late 19705. The
program was designed to provide
a anyone who called the service

with an escort between any two
points on campus from H p.m. to
midnight, seven days a week.
Since that time, the relatively
low number of reported assaults
on campus, combined with "a
lack of motivation among direc
tors,' has led to a drop in use of
the service, said Julie Ann Yuen,
one of last year's directors.
The service's only cart was
stolen during winter break last
year, forcing all escorts to travel
by foot or bicycle during the rest
of the academic year. SURE

plans to have two to three
operable carts this year, Voth
said.
"In the beginning (of the '86-
'87 school year) things were
going well," Yuen said. But
when federal work-study funds
didn't come through to pay the
escorts, management spirits
dropped, Yuen said. "I'm criti
cizing myself as well as the other
directors," she added.
SURE will now operate under
the auspices of the ASSU, ac
cording to Sheilon King, assis

tant administrative manager of
the ASSU and the liaison be
tween that organization and
SURE.
"Last year, SURE was having
administrative problems. They
weren't doing the job they could
have," King said.
The escort service "used to be
part of the University (and was
only partially funded by the
ASSU), but SURE now operates
under ASSU guidelines as part of
