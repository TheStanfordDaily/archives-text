# SURE reorganizes and looks to the future
## 
### Ann Marsh Editorial staff 
After a year of struggling with
poor management, directors of
Students United for Rape Elimi
nation (SURE) Escort Service
hope a new school year and new
membership in the ASSU will
revive their underutilized pro
gram.
"Our biggest goal this year is
to increase our usership," said
junior Katie Voth, one of three
SURF directors. The other two

directors are junior Bridget Lar
son and sophomore Michelle
Hohnke.
"Last year, on a good night we
got three calls. Sometimes we
didn't get a call at all," Voth said.
She said the service is mostly
used by graduate students and
University employees.
SURE was established in
March, 1979, after numerous at
tacks on women in the Stanford
community in the late 19705. The
program was designed to provide
a anyone who called the service

with an escort between any two
points on campus from H p.m. to
midnight, seven days a week.
Since that time, the relatively
low number of reported assaults
on campus, combined with "a
lack of motivation among direc
tors,' has led to a drop in use of
the service, said Julie Ann Yuen,
one of last year's directors.
The service's only cart was
stolen during winter break last
year, forcing all escorts to travel
by foot or bicycle during the rest
of the academic year. SURE

plans to have two to three
operable carts this year, Voth
said.
"In the beginning (of the '86-
'87 school year) things were
going well," Yuen said. But
when federal work-study funds
didn't come through to pay the
escorts, management spirits
dropped, Yuen said. "I'm criti
cizing myself as well as the other
directors," she added.
SURE will now operate under
the auspices of the ASSU, ac
cording to Sheilon King, assis

tant administrative manager of
the ASSU and the liaison be
tween that organization and
SURE.
"Last year, SURE was having
administrative problems. They
weren't doing the job they could
have," King said.
The escort service "used to be
part of the University (and was
only partially funded by the
ASSU), but SURE now operates
under ASSU guidelines as part of
the ASSU," King said.
"I want to make sure that
SURE Escort gets back on its
feet again," Council of Presi
dents member Maria Canas said.
Canas said she has suggestions
on how to "improve the consis
tency in the way [SURE]
presents itself.
Canas said she hopes that stu
dents will receive business cards
with SURE information on them.
The cards could be carried in a
student's wallet at all times, and
"this will provide an incentive to
use the service," she said.
Because the service has been
receiving so few calls, Voth said
she was surprised that the ASSU
fee request for SURE passed last
spring with over 80 percent of
voters supporting it. The organi
zation will be run this year with
$47,093, before election refunds,
in ASSU funds.
"There's obvious interest out
there," Voth said. "Many of the
women we had sign the petition
(to get on the ballot) were very
supportive, but they just don't
use (the service]."
"This campus is not very well
lit," Voth said, emphasizing that
many people are under the mis
taken impression that rape "will
never happen to them."
A memo released in 1979 by
the then-dean of Student Affairs

and the Stanford police, stated
that the escort service was de
signed "to lessen, and hopefully
eliminate, the occurence of rape
on the Stanford campus."
There is reason to believe that
such a service can effectively
achieve those goals. The success
of the Evening Guide Service at
San Jose State University offers
testimony to that fact. "Since we
started our escort system (in the
late 19705), we don't have in
cidences of rape" on campus,
said Michelle Wilson, an em
ployee of the SJSU campus
police.
Joel Yusim, also an employee
of the SJSU campus police, said
that the service handles between
50 and 100 calls before I a.m
each night.
However, "our campus is not
nearly so dispersed as Stan
ford's," he said.
Recognizing that there is a
continuing interest in SURE on
campus is the first step to im
proving its usage at Stanford, ac
cording to Voth.
Past SURE management has
already worked out some of the
problems that have plagued the
service in the past. Among these
were the complaints which
surfaced in early 1985 that SURE
was promoting sexism because of
its male-dominated staff.

Sophomore Michelle Hohnke (I.), and juniors Bridget Larson and Katie
Voth are the directors of the SURE Escort Service.
Feminists raised concerns that
having a largely male staff (based
on the presumption that men
must protect women) would
foster the kinds of attitudes that
lead to rape.
Since that time, SURE direc
tors have actively recruited
female escorts who ride two at a
time to answer calls, while their
male counterparts ride alone.
Women must ride in tandem,
Voth said, or the whole purpose
of the service would be defeated.
Still, Voth said she is grateful
for any help that is volunteered.
Fall and winter quarter last year,
fraternity members staffed
SURE on Saturday nights. "We
appreciated the help," Voth said.
Although SURE escorts have
been paid in the past, the work is
done mostly on a volunteer basis,
depending on the availability of
individuals. According to Voth,
the new ASSU funds have
allowed SURE to budget enough

money to pay 21 employees, or
three per evening.
"Because it's student run, we
can't reasonably expect [SURE]
to run all night," she said.

Our biggest goal
this year is to in
crease our user
ship

Although they will take callers
to and from anywhere on
campus, Voth said SURE tradi
tionally has made hourly stops
between Green Library and
Meyer Library, as well as Tresid
der. This year will potentially see
these stops made more fre
quently, perhaps at half-hour in
tervals.
Although the service only runs
until midnight, Voth said that the
Stanford Police will usually help
people who need escorts after
that time.

female escorts who ride two at a
time to answer calls, while their
male counterparts ride alone.
Women must ride in tandem,
Voth said, or the whole purpose
of the service would be defeated.
Still, Voth said she is grateful
for any help that is volunteered.
Fall and winter quarter last year,
fraternity members staffed
SURE on Saturday nights. "We
appreciated the help," Voth said.
Although SURE escorts have
been paid in the past, the work is
done mostly on a volunteer basis,
depending on the availability of
individuals. According to Voth,
the new ASSU funds have
allowed SURE to budget enough

money to pay 21 employees, or
three per evening.
"Because it's student run, we
can't reasonably expect [SURE]
to run all night," she said.

Our biggest goal
this year is to in
crease our user
ship

Although they will take callers
to and from anywhere on
campus, Voth said SURE tradi
tionally has made hourly stops
between Green Library and
Meyer Library, as well as Tresid
der. This year will potentially see
these stops made more fre
quently, perhaps at half-hour in
tervals.
Although the service only runs
until midnight, Voth said that the
Stanford Police will usually help
people who need escorts after
that time.
After a year of struggling with
poor management, directors of
Students United for Rape Elimi
nation (SURE) Escort Service
hope a new school year and new
membership in the ASSU will
revive their underutilized pro
gram.
"Our biggest goal this year is
to increase our usership," said
junior Katie Voth, one of three
SURF directors. The other two

directors are junior Bridget Lar
son and sophomore Michelle
Hohnke.
"Last year, on a good night we
got three calls. Sometimes we
didn't get a call at all," Voth said.
She said the service is mostly
used by graduate students and
University employees.
SURE was established in
March, 1979, after numerous at
tacks on women in the Stanford
community in the late 19705. The
program was designed to provide
a anyone who called the service

with an escort between any two
points on campus from H p.m. to
midnight, seven days a week.
Since that time, the relatively
low number of reported assaults
on campus, combined with "a
lack of motivation among direc
tors,' has led to a drop in use of
the service, said Julie Ann Yuen,
one of last year's directors.
The service's only cart was
stolen during winter break last
year, forcing all escorts to travel
by foot or bicycle during the rest
of the academic year. SURE

plans to have two to three
operable carts this year, Voth
said.
"In the beginning (of the '86-
'87 school year) things were
going well," Yuen said. But
when federal work-study funds
didn't come through to pay the
escorts, management spirits
dropped, Yuen said. "I'm criti
cizing myself as well as the other
directors," she added.
SURE will now operate under
the auspices of the ASSU, ac
cording to Sheilon King, assis

tant administrative manager of
the ASSU and the liaison be
tween that organization and
SURE.
"Last year, SURE was having
administrative problems. They
weren't doing the job they could
have," King said.
The escort service "used to be
part of the University (and was
only partially funded by the
ASSU), but SURE now operates
under ASSU guidelines as part of
the ASSU," King said.
"I want to make sure that
SURE Escort gets back on its
feet again," Council of Presi
dents member Maria Canas said.
Canas said she has suggestions
on how to "improve the consis
tency in the way [SURE]
presents itself.
Canas said she hopes that stu
dents will receive business cards
with SURE information on them.
The cards could be carried in a
student's wallet at all times, and
"this will provide an incentive to
use the service," she said.
Because the service has been
receiving so few calls, Voth said
she was surprised that the ASSU
fee request for SURE passed last
spring with over 80 percent of
voters supporting it. The organi
zation will be run this year with
$47,093, before election refunds,
in ASSU funds.
"There's obvious interest out
there," Voth said. "Many of the
women we had sign the petition
(to get on the ballot) were very
supportive, but they just don't
use (the service]."
"This campus is not very well
lit," Voth said, emphasizing that
many people are under the mis
taken impression that rape "will
never happen to them."
A memo released in 1979 by
the then-dean of Student Affairs

and the Stanford police, stated
that the escort service was de
signed "to lessen, and hopefully
eliminate, the occurence of rape
on the Stanford campus."
There is reason to believe that
such a service can effectively
achieve those goals. The success
of the Evening Guide Service at
San Jose State University offers
testimony to that fact. "Since we
started our escort system (in the
late 19705), we don't have in
cidences of rape" on campus,
said Michelle Wilson, an em
ployee of the SJSU campus
police.
Joel Yusim, also an employee
of the SJSU campus police, said
that the service handles between
50 and 100 calls before I a.m
each night.
However, "our campus is not
nearly so dispersed as Stan
ford's," he said.
Recognizing that there is a
continuing interest in SURE on
campus is the first step to im
proving its usage at Stanford, ac
cording to Voth.
Past SURE management has
already worked out some of the
problems that have plagued the
service in the past. Among these
were the complaints which
surfaced in early 1985 that SURE
was promoting sexism because of
its male-dominated staff.
