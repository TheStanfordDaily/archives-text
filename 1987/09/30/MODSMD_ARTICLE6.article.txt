# Tresidder gets a face lift
## 
### Chad Shirley 
Stanford students returned this week to find a
new look to the Tresidder Union, the controversial
building's second face lift in three years.
Tresidder officials planned the modernization as
part of an effort to dispel the image that the building
is not actually a "student" union because it has his
torically catered to alumni, visitors and local resi
dents with conference rooms and services.
When the Council of Presidents last year dis
cussed returning control of Tresidder to the ASSU,
Tresidder officials started an effort to win over dis
contented students.
Paul Szczesiul, former acting director of Tresid
der Union, said yesterday he is hopeful that the
Board of Trustees will approve additional renova
tions to improve the facility.
Bobbi Braden, the new Tresidder director, said
she also hopes to "integrate the rest of the campus
with our program" and wants more student input
for future changes.
Although the renovations are scheduled to take
f>lace over four years and cost $5 million to $6 mil
ion, they are needed in a building that has changed
little in its 25 years of existence, Szczesiul said.
The latest round of renovations began over the
summer recess. Two meeting rooms were con
verted into 60 additional seats for the Grand Mar
ketplace. New furniture and lighting was also in
stalled. The refurbished upstairs lounge will now be
open from 8 a.m. to midnight seven days a week.

The fate of the proposed long-term structural
renovations rests in the hands of the Board of Trus
tees. The trustees will vote Oct. 12 on a plan to
move the LOTS II computer cluster to a 9500
square-foot facility on the balcony above its pres
ent location.
Tresidder, built in 1%2, was constructed so that
an addition on the balcony could be made without
major modifications.
Officials said the new structure will be used as a
temporary home for the Computer Science Depart
ment and LOTS until a new building in the Campus
West development opens. Construction on the
computer building is scheduled to start in the
spring.
Once the balcony addition is vacated, the area
will be used to provide offices for student groups.
The master plan calls for a shift of business loca
tions in order to utilize the newly freed space and
streamline operations. When LOTS moves
upstairs, the Coffee House will fill the vacant
space. I he Store will be moved to the area now oc
cupied by The Coffee House, and the Corner
Pocket will move to the Store space.
University officials have long recognized the
need for additional space and better utilization of
existing facilities at Tresidder. In the early 1980s a
committee of students, staff members and Univer
sity officials developed a plan for modernizing the
building. The committee's work led to the adoption
of the Tresidder Long Range Space Plan in Janu
ary, m\.
