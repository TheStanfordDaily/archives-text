Gorbachev returns after absence
MOSCOW — Soviet television viewers turned on their sets
last night to see Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev back at work
after an uncharacteristic 52-day absence from public view.
Looking tan, slimmer and in good humor, he was shown
talking to a visiting French delegation. "1 believe there has been
some suggestion that I have taken too long a holiday. 1 can tell
you 1 earned it,"he told them, according to the official news
agency Tass.
Gorbachev's energetic performance yesterday cut short some
of the wilder rumors that had circulated here about his health,
but it served to highlight once again the powerful impact of the
leader's image in this autocratic society.
It also showed that despite calls for more openness in Soviet
society, the Kremlin has not yet allowed the light of "glasnost"
to shine on its own internal doings, least of all on the leader's
personal life.
Official assurances given to Western reporters over the past
week that Gorbachev was on vacation and in good health were
not presented to the Soviet public. The silence, punctuated only
by articles and messages in the press signed by Gorbachev, left
people here wondering and fueled rumors that Gorbachev was
ailing, or worse.
Coming at a pivotal moment in Gorbachev's campaign for
economic and social reforms, his absence was seen by some
here as troubling. Many noticed that as Gorbachev's voice fell
silent, others — such as Yegor Ligachev and KGB chief Viktor
Chebrikov — filled the vacuum, striking a conservative note on
cultural themes.
Gorbachev took the opportunity of his remarks to the French
delegation today to affirm his political strength. "There is no po
litical opposition in the Soviet Union," he said, adding that
"restructuring is gathering strength."
Shultz: Aid S. African moderates
NEW YORK — Secretary of State George Shultz, avoiding
even the word "sanctions," sketched a remarkably sunny vi
sion of South Africa's future yesterday and promised U.S. eco
nomic, political and diplomatic support to moderate groups
seeking to end apartheid by democratic means.
Shultz's speech, billed in advance as a major policy state
ment, came as the administration was completing a report on the
first year of the U.S. economic sanctions against South Africa.
The sanctions were imposed by Congress last October over the
objections of President Reagan.
The report, which is expected to call for relaxation of the
pressure on the white minority government, is scheduled to be
sent to Capitol Hill on Friday.
Although Shultz said nothing about the sanctions, a senior ad
ministration official who briefed reporters in advance of the
speech said, "We think our influence has been weakened, at
least for the time being" by the Congress-ordered restrictions
on U.S. economic dealings with the white ruling government.
The official said that the purpose of the Shultz speech, to a
black-tie audience at a dinner sponsored by the Business Coun
cil for International Understanding, was to raise the morale of
moderate South Africans, both black and white, who are
seeking to end the apartheid system of racial separation and
white minority government without violence and without sub
stituting a black totalitarian government.
"The sanctions debate is behind us — that is last year's
agenda," the official said.
Shultz said that future U.S. policy is aimed at "a rapid end to
apartheid, achieved by negotiations among all South Africans."
State Dept. pushes Saudi arms sale
WASHINGTON —The State Department yesterday strongly
suggested that the administration plans to go ahead with a large
scale arms sale to Saudi Arabia despite the opposition of 64
senators, and administration officials said a final decision on
what arms will be sold is likely to be made next week.
State Department spokeswoman Phyllis Oakley said the $1.4
billion arms sale under consideration would be in America's in
terest and that it is "unfortunate" that the sale is being opposed
on Capitol Hill "when the Saudis are providing critical support
to U.S. naval operations in the (Persian) Gulf in ways which
meet our mutual interests and needs, and in ways which many in
Congress have long urged."
Oakley declined to make public details of the support that
Saudi Arabia is providing, but she said the information has been
provided to members of Congress in classified reports.
At least 217 House members are adding their opposition to
that of the senators, which was expressed in a letter presented
to the White House on Friday. Rep. Larry Smith (D-Fla.) and
other members of the House Foreign Affairs Committee are
scheduled to make public Wednesday the House members' let
ter to President Reagan opposing the sale.
Congressional sources said presidential national security af
fairs adviser Frank C. Carlucci was at the Capitol Tuesday to
discuss the arms sale with key lawmakers and that senior State
Department officials have spent much time in similar consulta
tions in recent days.
No decision on the details of the arms package is likely before
the end of the Jewish high holy days this weekend, according to
an administration official. He added that the arms proposal
probably will have to be submitted to Congress next week in or
der to provide the required 50-day opportunity for congressional
action before Congress recesses for the year in November.
Industry seeks imported workers
LOS ANGELES — Southern California garment manufac
turers are seeking permission from immigration authorities to
import workers from foreign countries to replace employees al
legedly lost as a result of the new immigration law.
One Los Angeles company already has won preliminary ap
proval to bring in 40 workers from the Philippines for seven
months and six other companies have applied to import
seamstresses from that country for a year, according to govern
ment officials involved in processing the applications.
Other companies are seeking to bring in workers from Guam
and Mexico.
If approved, it would mark the first time large numbers of un
skilled workers would be legally imported for temporary, non
agricultural labor. The garment industry has traditionally im
ported small numbers of specialized employees — such as silk
seamstresses — for permanent jobs.
Union officials oppose the requests on the grounds that it
would depress wages, entrench poor working conditions and
retard efforts to unionize garment workers.
Moreover, Josie Gonzales, a Los Angeles immigration
lawyer, predicted that if garment companies are permitted to
bring in guest workers, hotel and restaurant owners, who also
have complained of shortages linked to the immigration law,
would follow suit.
Historically, garment manufacturers have had a readily
available supply of low-wage workers here, many of whom were
undocumented aliens. But the employers assert that the situa
tion has changed dramatically in recent months.
