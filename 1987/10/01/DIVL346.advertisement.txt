Can we save a seat for
you in the Reserved
Senior Football Section?
Senior Tailnater Festivities begin at 10:00 am this
Saturday. We'lf be easy to find. Just look for the Class
of '88 banner near De Guerre Pool. Plenty of food and
spirits to go around.
From there, we'll waltz into the Senior Section
together.
Please sign up to reserve your seat in the section. The
Senior Class Presidents and Senior Core Members have
the lists. There's also one in White Plaza.
The Senior Section, we believe, will be a roaring
success. Simple proof that being a Senior has its privi
leges.
