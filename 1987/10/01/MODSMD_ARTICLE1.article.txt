# RFs warn students, lay blame on frats
## 
### Mark Lawrence Senior staff writer 
Several resident fellows said
yesterday that they would, at the
request of the Office of Residen
tial Education, warn students to
act responsibly at Saturday's
football game, but the RFs in
sisted that students living in their
dorms were well-behaved at last
week's game.
Many of the RFs and other
University officials interviewed
blamed fraternities instead for
most of the alcohol-related inci
dents that marred last Saturday's
Stanford-San Jose State game at
Stanford Stadium.
In the Stanford student section
at that game, police broke up
three fights and received six
reports of drunken spectators
throwing beer cans and other
debris. Students, faculty and ad
ministrators who attended the
game said that most disruptions
occurred in a small part of the
seating area where several frater
nities were sitting.
Fraternity officers yesterday
accepted blame for many of the
incidents and said the University
would be justified in banning al
cohol in the stadium if spectator
behavior does not improve this
week.
"I think that the University
has put up with a lot," said Phi
Delta Theta President Jon Payne.
"They've been fairly liberal so
far. I think the privilege (of being
allowed to drink in the stadium)
has been abused."
Interfraternity Council Presi
dent Vinny Frost said he and
other IFC representatives had
visited several fraternities earlier
in the week to discuss ways of re
ducing alcohol-related problems
in the stadium. The IFC will hold
more meetings in the fraternity
houses before Saturday, Frost
said.
"We're asking fraternity mem
bers to control themselves a little
better," he said. "1 think things
are going to improve."
Athletic Director Andy Geiger
said Monday that the University
is prepared to ban alcohol in the
stadium if the behavior of specta
tors at this week's game is not
better than it was last week. He
called the UCLA game a "last
chance" for students to show
that they can drink responsibly in
the stands.
In addition to the problems in
the Stanford student section, the
game was marked by the possibly

alcohol-related death of a 23-
year-old San Jose man, citations
of 10 students under the age of 21
for possession of alcohol and
three fights in other seating
areas.
Geiger and University Presi
dent Donald Kennedy are con
ducting a review of Stanford's
policy concerning alcohol in the
stadium. They will consider a
report by Stanford Police Chief
Marvin Herrington and meet
with Dean of Student Affairs
James Lyons and other Univer
sity administrators. On Tuesday,
Geiger would not rule out im
possibility that alcohol could be
banned for the UCLA game.
The University Committee on
Athletics, Physical Education
and Recreation decided in May
to continue on a probationary
basis its longstanding policy of
allowing alcohol in the stadium.

In repeated considerations of
Stanford alcohol policies, the
University has maintained that
students should be allowed to
decide for themselves on stan
dards of acceptable behavior.
But last weekend's incidents
prompted Norm Robinson, asso
ciate dean of Student Affairs for
Residential Education, to send a
memorandum to residence staff
members asking them to inform
students that "if students are
unable or unwilling to behave
responsibly on their own, the
University will have to take steps
to ensure that they do."
Resident fellows said they sup
ported Robinson's effort and
hoped that the University was
serious about its ultimatum.
"I feel that if you say you're
going to do something, you ought
to do it," said Soto RF John
Perry, professor of philosophy.

Larkin RF Bruce Rosenstock,
professor of classics, said he
would "talk to the dorm and en
courage the students to take the
situation seriously."
Frost said he expected frater
nity members would make a
serious attempt to improve their
behavior. "Over the summer,
people forgot what was being
said (about the possibility of ban
ning alcohol) last spring," Frost
said. "Now that alcohol has been
drawn to people's attention
again, students will be more care
ful."
Kappa Alpha President
Charles Moody was also confi
dent that fraternities will improve
their behavior. "1 think that the
warnings will have an effect," he
said. "If students see that the
University is serious, they will
try to do better."
