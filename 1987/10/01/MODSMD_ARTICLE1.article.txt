# RFs warn students, lay blame on frats
## 
### Mark Lawrence Senior staff writer 
Several resident fellows said
yesterday that they would, at the
request of the Office of Residen
tial Education, warn students to
act responsibly at Saturday's
football game, but the RFs in
sisted that students living in their
dorms were well-behaved at last
week's game.
Many of the RFs and other
University officials interviewed
blamed fraternities instead for
most of the alcohol-related inci
dents that marred last Saturday's
Stanford-San Jose State game at
Stanford Stadium.
In the Stanford student section
at that game, police broke up
three fights and received six
reports of drunken spectators
throwing beer cans and other
debris. Students, faculty and ad
ministrators who attended the
game said that most disruptions
occurred in a small part of the
seating area where several frater
nities were sitting.
Fraternity officers yesterday
accepted blame for many of the
incidents and said the University
would be justified in banning al
cohol in the stadium if spectator
behavior does not improve this
week.
"I think that the University
has put up with a lot," said Phi
Delta Theta President Jon Payne.
"They've been fairly liberal so
far. I think the privilege (of being
allowed to drink in the stadium)
has been abused."
Interfraternity Council Presi
dent Vinny Frost said he and
other IFC representatives had
visited several fraternities earlier
in the week to discuss ways of re
ducing alcohol-related problems
in the stadium. The IFC will hold
more meetings in the fraternity
