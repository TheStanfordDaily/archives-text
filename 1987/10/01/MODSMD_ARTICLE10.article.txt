# Coup rumors sweep Manila

MANILA, Philippines â€” As rumors
mounted yesterday that another coup against
Philippine President Corazon Aquino was im
minent, hundreds of army and marine combat
troops backed by armored personnel carriers
and helicopter gunships sealed off principal
entrances to the capital and touched off a new
round of civilian panic in Manila.
Jittery soldiers at one checkpoint just
outside the city accidentally shot up a pas
senger bus when its brakes failed early Yes
terday morning.
When word spread that anti-government
soldiers under renegade Col. Gregorio
Honasan, leader of a coup attempt Aug. 28,
were approaching Manila, troops loyal to
Aquino stopped other loyalist troops on
routine maneuvers. In one case, dozens of
loyalist troops detained other loyalists at gun
point until allegiances could be confirmed.
The troops were withdrawn from the city
streets late in the afternoon, but by then their
deployment and the presence of such heavy
equipment had touched off panic buying in
stores and jammed the city's telephone lines.
Just before noon, hundreds of panicky
downtown residents called radio and police
stations when five F-4 fighter jets buzzed
Manila's bay front. The jets belonged to the

U.S. Air Force's Thunderbirds team, which
was putting on a long-scheduled goodwill
demonstration.
Yesterday's events illustrated how Manila
continues to be what one columnist has
dubbed "Jitter City" more than a month after
Honasan's nearly successful attempt to over
throw Aquino IK months after he helped lead
a successful revolt against President Fer
dinand Marcos.
Conceding that the nation has yet to stabi
lize in the aftermath of the mutiny, Aquino's
Armed Forces Chief Gen. Fidel Ramos yes
terday told soldiers at one provincial camp
who had joined in the August rebellion, that
"for as long as our country is not stable, eco
nomic recovery will not be attained." And
Ramos appealed to the armed forces "to
close ranks and help the government attain
stability."
The latest round of panic set in after more
than 100,000 leftist mourners waved red ban
ners and black ribbons throughout the city
Tuesday as they staged a 16-mile funeral
protest march behind the coffin of slain anti
government street activist Leandro
Alejandro.

All such recent shows offeree by the politi
cal left have been met with a calibrated
response from the nation s armed
ultrarightists and military renegades, and a
series of what the armed forces called
"unauthorized troop movements immedi
ately following the funeral led to the massive
military deployment around Manila.
Ramos' concern yesterday reportedly
deepened after his intelligence officers
learned that military police Col. Reynaldo
Cabauatan, who took part in a failed coup at
tempt last January, held a press conference in
Manila's business district of Makati late
Tuesday night.
Dozens of local and foreign journalists had
been invited to the press conference in a high
rise office building, but Aquino's defense
minister Rafael lleto was quoted Yesterday
as saying that, by the time the military
learned of it, Cabauatan had finished with the
media and escaped.
Cabauatan accused Aquino of being a
Communist and urged the 155,0(H)--member
armed forces to renounce her and Ramos and
join the rebels.
