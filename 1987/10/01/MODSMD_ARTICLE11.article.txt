# Embattled Dukakis aides quit
## 
### 
WASHINGTON — Massa
chussetts Gov. Michael Dukakis,
grim-faced and embarrassed, ac
knowledged yesterday that his
presidential campaign manager,
John Sasso, was the source of an
"attack video" that triggered the
series of events forcing Sen.
Joseph Biden (D-Del.) to quit the
race for the 1988 Democratic
nomination.
"Although 1 had no knowledge
of this as a candidate in this cam
paign, I accept full responsibility
for it. I'm running for the
presidency, not against any
body,"' Dukakis said at a press
conference in Boston.
Sasso, who had served Du
kakis for seven years as the
governor's chief of staff and in
other roles before taking charge

of his presidential campaign,
resigned later in the day. So did
Dukakis' national political direc
tor, Paul Tully, who previously
had denied any connection be
tween the Dukakis campaign and
the damaging tape.
Dukakis' disclosure, all the
more awkward because the Mas
sachusetts governor had ex
pressed disbelief just two days
earlier that anyone in his organi
zation could have played such a
role, was a potentially serious
setback for a candidate who has
surged to the forefront of the
Democratic field.
Not only must Dukakis find
replacements for the two top offi
cials of his campaign, he must
also deal with the distracting
questions now certain to be

raised about his control over the
organization he heads and even
about his judgment.
Dukakis is "going to have to
come forward and explain the
events that led to this revela
tion.'' said lowa State Demo
cratic Chairman Bonnie Camp
bell. While declining to assess
the damage directly, she said:
"No one's going to be happy
about it."
"I think it's serious," said
Joseph Grandmaison, New
Hampshire Democratic party
chairman and manager of
Dukakis' first successful cam
paign for governor in 1974. "Is it
the end of the world politically?
No. But it is a great embarrass
ment."
"This raises real questions in

my mind about Dukakis' judg
ment in people," said Austin
Ranney, chairman of the political
science department at UC-
Berkeley.
And Alan Seerist, a Demo
cratic pollster specializing in
lowa, which was the center of
the Biden controversy, said
negative reaction to Dukakis'
disclosure would he heightened
by what he called "a backdrop or
context that is especially at
tentive to character." He said
that this public attitude stemmed
not only from the Biden episode
and former Colorado Sen. Gary
Hart's involvement with a Miami
model, but also from such recent
imbroglios as the Iran-contra
scandal and the Jim and Tammy
Bakker scandal.
