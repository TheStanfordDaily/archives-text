Medical supplies valued at ap
proximately $30.000 have been
sent to two Nicaraguan hospitals
by the Palo Alto-Stanford Medi
cal Aid Committee for Central
America (PASMAC), according
to organization member Susan
Harrison.
The shipment, consisting of
surgical instruments, bandages
and pediatric equipment, was
purchased by PASMAC from
UNICEF in Denmark at 20 to 25
percent of retail cost.
PASMAC, a non-profit volun
teer organization formed in 19K4.
attempts to provide medical as
sistance to Central American
communities and educate the
members of local communities
about medical issues in those

countries.
"This is the best we have ever
done," saul Harrison. "We only
hope to continue doing more of
the same in the future."
Last March, PASMAC held a
benefit concert to raise money
for medical aid to Central
America. The concert, which
featured Jackson Browne, raised
513.0(H). Some of these proceeds
went to purchase the supplies
that were just shipped.
According to Harrison, the
two hospitals to which the
supplies were sent are the Olof
Palme Clinic in Managua and the
Bernardino Diaz Ochoa Hospital
in Ciranada. She said the hospi
tals are in desperate need of the
supplies.
The Palme Clinic is named for
slain Swedish prime minister
Olof Palme, who was assas-

sinated the same day the
Nicaraguan Ministry of Health
approved plans for the clinic. Ac
cording to Harrison, the clinic
has not been able to open for lack
of supplies.
"We are all delighted PAS
MAC has been able to help in the
opening," said Harrison.
According to Harrison, there is
a desperate need for medical aid
in Nicaragua, but she said the
shipment is not scheduled to
arrive in Managua until January,
Harrison attributed this
delay to the U.S. trade embargo
against Nicaragua, which has
closed commercial shipping
channels between the two
countries. The embargo neces
sitated ocean shipment of the
supplies from Europe, which ex
tended shipment time.
