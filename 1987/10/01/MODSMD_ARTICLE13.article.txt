# Oaks dying on campus

A major reforestation project
in the Stanford Foothills is cur
rently being implemented to
counteract a decline in the
number of mature native oaks
growing there and the failure of
new oaks to take hold.
According to University offi
cials, Stanford reforestation
workers are doing "whatever
humans are able to do" to save
the oaks, said David Schrom, a
forestry consultant working on
the project.
According to Biology Prof.
John Thomas, most of the oaks
in the Foothills are "quite old.
and some are probably near the
end of their natural lifespans."
Thomas added that the number
of mature, healthy trees has ap
parently declined over the past
few years. Although the cause
of this decline is uncertain,
Thomas cited a number of cir
cumstances that may have
combined to weaken the older
oaks.
Possible factors include a
recent series of relatively dry
years, a severe drought about

10 years ago, defoliation
caused by insects like the Cali
fornia Oak Moth, and a root
fungus which may be attacking
the trees.
In addition, Thomas said
acorns dropped by mature trees
and new oak shoots have been
eaten by cattle grazing in the
hills and rodents in the area.
Because of the cattle and ro
dent problem, Thomas said,
"we will have to do more than
set out acorns and young
trees" to increase the oak pop
ulation.
Campus planner Bob Segar
said the University is testing a
number of planting methods in
the foothills aimed at protecting
the acorns and young trees and
increasing the number of oaks
in Stanford's hills.
According to Segar, the Uni
versity is spending between
$ 10.0(H) and $40,000 each year
on reforestation efforts that
began in 1983 after a tree age
distribution survey indicated
that "vegetation management"
was necessary.
The University Planning Of
fice then hired Schrom and his

company, Magic Inc., to do the
actual planting and monitoring
in the hills. According to
Schrom, Magic Inc. planted
3000 acorns and young oaks
last winter on 250 acres of Stan
ford land near the Dish from
which cattle have been ex
cluded.
Segar explained that refor
estation methods include
seeding acorns in areas fenced
to protect them from hungry ro
dents as well as fencing around
young trees.
Signs of positive progress are
evident in some areas under
reforestation, Segar said, al
though he cautioned that "four
years is a short time in which to
judge the success of the proj
ect."
Schrom made a similar
assessment. He said it is impos
sible to predict "whether there
will be oak trees on the Stan
ford foothills in 100 years."
According to Schrom, over
half of the acorns planted three
years ago and two-thirds of the
acorns planted last year have
survived to date.
