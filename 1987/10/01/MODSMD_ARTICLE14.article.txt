## The 						Stanford Daily An Independent Newspaper Take words to heart 
### 
In his welcoming speech to the freshman class
Friday night. University President Donald Ken
nedy issued a challenge to new students, urging
them to take risks.
1 would like to urge you to run against the
tide of belief in your own cohort, to be true to
the values you have established for yourself,"
he said. That, Kennedy said, "involves taking
on some risks."
Kennedy went on to speak with considerable
emphasis about the need for new students to be
open to differences between themselves and the
people they w ill encounter at Stanford.
Kennedy said that to take advantage of the op
portunities presented by the diversity of Stan
ford's student body, students must go beyond
tolerance — "beyond the easy, surface accept
ance of differences that allows us to escape the
charge of prejudice but immunizes us from a real
understanding of what differences are all
about."
Institutions like Stanford, however, are
"sometimes guilty of forms of racism them
selves," Kennedy said. Institutional and per
sonal means, he said, must be used to right such
wrongs.
Kennedy's words certainly ring true. Any at
tempt to eliminate racism must ultimately be the
responsibility of individuals, whose personal
feelings and prejudices lie at the heart of racism.
But the institution that plays host to individ
uals can also take an integral leadership role in
dealing with racism.
Stanford should set an example for its stu
dents that — as Kennedy said Friday night —
"racism is an absolutely unacceptable form of
social behavior on this campus."
There have been encouraging signs of late:
minority representation in the freshman class is
up and the Office of Residential Education has
gone to great lengths to expose students to
workshops and seminars on "openness to differ
ences."
Other signs are not so encouraging. The ad
ministration's bureaucratic response to a set of

demands sent to him by a coalition of minority
groups this spring was roundly and justifiably
decried by spokespersons of these groups.
As one spokesperson said at the time,
minority groups "represent one-third of the
campus and . . . deserve more."
Equally discouraging is the University's
response to proposals for changes in the West
ern Culture program. Kennedy said Friday that
"some students have been unwilling to offer an
opinion" in the debate about Western Culture
"simply because to do so might entail contro
versy and discomfort."
Hut the University, too, has been largely silent
on the issue, shuffling it off to a myriad of task
forces and committees without making a strong
statement for or against changes in the curricu
lum.
The University response to proposals for
changes in the program show a profound non
openness to differences. The University's West
ern Culture Programming Committee wrote in
April that "the systematic study of cultural di
versity ought to be met not by abandoning the
Western Culture requirement, but by redefining
the existing non-Western requirement."
Finally, the University's pace in divesting its
holdings in companies doing business in South
Africa can best be described as sluggish.
More aggressive divestment, the argument
goes, might not be the most effective way of rid
ding South Africa of its racist apartheid govern
ment. Maybe that's true, but maybe it isn't.
All of which brings us back to the issue of risk
taking. Kennedy told the freshmen that they
should be willing to take risks. The University
he heads needs to take his words to heart.
Faking a stronger stand on minority representa
tion on campus, or on the Western Culture pro
gram or on divestment, might be risky for the
University. But all of those are risks that Stan
ford needs to take. It it does, it will send an un
equivocal message to students that racism really
is, as Kennedy said Friday night, "abhorred
throughout this community."

versity ought to be met not by abandoning the
Western Culture requirement, but by redefining
the existing non-Western requirement."
Finally, the University's pace in divesting its
holdings in companies doing business in South
Africa can best be described as sluggish.
More aggressive divestment, the argument
goes, might not be the most effective way of rid
ding South Africa of its racist apartheid govern
ment. Maybe that's true, but maybe it isn't.
All of which brings us back to the issue of risk
taking. Kennedy told the freshmen that they
should be willing to take risks. The University
he heads needs to take his words to heart.
Faking a stronger stand on minority representa
tion on campus, or on the Western Culture pro
gram or on divestment, might be risky for the
University. But all of those are risks that Stan
ford needs to take. It it does, it will send an un
equivocal message to students that racism really
is, as Kennedy said Friday night, "abhorred
throughout this community."
