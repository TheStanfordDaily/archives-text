## Kennedy calls for responsibility, curiosity 
### 
What follows are excerpts from
University President Donald
Kennedy's address to incoming
freshmen Sept. 25:
It is in the interest of Stan
ford's future, as well as of your
own. that I tell you about our
aspirations as an institution, and
then about the hopes and expec
tations we hold for you.

Donald Kennedy

First, you need to know that
Stanford — like a handful of the
world's great universities — is
dedicated equally to teaching and
to discovery. The search for new
knowledge — that is, research —
together with the thoughtful and.
we hope, frequently inspirational
teaching of established knowl
edge, are joint missions
here. . . .
Second, this institution and the
people in it are committed — as
the society that supports us ex
pects us to be — to the better
ment ol the human condition.
And so. although we aspire to be
a treasure house of good ideas,
our aspirations don't stop there;
we want some of those good
ideas to improve our lives by en
livening our culture, by creating
new technologies that make us
more productive, by enhancing
our health, and by strengthening
our institutions. Thus we believe
in service and in the power of our
intellectual ventures to enhance
that service. . . .
Now, what about our hopes
and expectations for you? They
relate, not surprisingly, to the
descriptions of Stanford I have
just given. And they all relate to a
single theme: the undertaking of
risk.
I hope, first of all, that you will
be explorers. This morning I
spoke on that subject to your par
ents; but I suspect they may not
pass it on, or, if they do, that you
may not listen. There is more to
this university than any under
graduate can possibly discover,
let alone experience. In fact, it is
also true that there is more to this
university than any undergradu
ates regularly discover or exfueri
ence. That means there ai"b un
told riches of uncommitted fac
ulty time, projects, seminars,
courses, independent study ex
periences that are not being
utilized merely because they
have not been discovered. That
is a challenge to the entrepre
neurial instincts of each of you.

and I hope you take it up. . . .
Second, employ some faith in
the capacities and values that
you brought here with you. Don't
be too willing to accept the con
victions or traditions of others
here about what is and is not OK
to do.
Third, remember the part 1 told
you about the university in ser
vice of society. That applies not
only to the knowledge that is
gained here, but to other aspects
of the institution's life as well.
There are ample opportunities to
participate constructively in
what Stanford gives to the world
outside — through volunteer
work in tutoring programs or
other activities, through partici
pation in such activities as Reach
Out Today, the day of commu
nity service that will take place
October 17, or the "You Can
Make A Difference'' conference,
this year on the subject of racism
and scheduled for Nov. 12 and
13. . . .
There is a fourth and last ex
pectation, to which I want to give
special emphasis, and that's why
1 put it last: Be prepared to
encounter and to seriously ex
plore human differences. For the
vast majority of you, this will be
the most diverse community you
will ever live in. Almost a third of
your entering classmates are
people of color, and the
percentage of international stu
dents is high. We consider that to
be one of Stanford's greatest
strengths — one that offers you a
profound opportunity to learn
and to prepare for life beyond
Stanford, which, for evermore,
will take place in a multi-racial
and multi-cultural society. To
take advantage of what Stanford
can offer you, it will be necessary
to go beyond tolerance —
beyond the easy, surface accept
ance of differences that allows us
to escape the charge of prejudice
but immunizes us from a real un
derstanding of what differences
are all about. It is not hard to deal
with diversity by just being nice
— but that's a life lived under
light anesthesia.
Going beyond mere tolerance
is especially challenging when
the differences are racial. It is
hard, first of all, even to find a
safe language in which to discuss
race openly and seriously. But it
can be done. The alternative —
to avoid the exploration of racial
differences entirely — is too
common and too easy, particu
larly for those of us who do not
belong to a racial minority.

Consider two examples: One
might decide, for instance, to
stay away from Ujamaa or Casa
Zapata because those residences
appear too different; but to do so
would be to forego both a warm
welcome and an opportunity to
experience cultural breadth.
Similarly, some students here
have been unwilling to offer an
opinion in the current debate
about the curricular appropriate
ness of our Western Culture se
quence simply because to do so
might entail controversy and dis
comfort.
I he subject is an especially dif
ficult one now for reasons that go
far beyond Stanford. The fact is
that we find ourselves at an un
usually difficult time for people
of color in the United States.
Much of this decade has been oc
cupied by an evident retreat at
the federal level from principles
of equal opportunity that many of
us thought had been firmly estab
lished. We have also witnessed
an organized campaign by the At
torney General and by other gov
ernment officials against efforts
to secure equality of opportunity
through the courts. It is small
wonder that discouragement is
evident in our minority commu
nities, and that it surfaces even in
environments like this one that
are committed to a more equi
table future.
And it is also true at the same
time — regrettably — that insti
tutions like Stanford, despite a
set of generally good intentions,
are sometimes guilty of forms of
racism themselves. We need,
first of all, to be realistic enough
to accept that such failings occur
and to recognize that the redress
ing of those wrongs involves both
institutional and individual re
sponsibility. You should know
that racism is an absolutely unac
ceptable form of social behavior
on this campus. There ought,
therefore, to be a very clear un
derstanding that public dis
paragement and hurtful generali
ties about any group — whether
based upon ethnicity, religion,
physical limitations or sexual
preference — are abhorred
throughout this community. But
how can that outcome be assured
in a place like this?
Certainly the University bears
institutional responsibility by
virtue of the values it promotes
and the formal processes it
makes available for the resolu
tion of matters involving racism.
Yet such processes will work

only if you as individuals are will
ing to accept responsibility as
well - by encountering such
incidents directly, by speaking
out. and.finally, by using what
the University makes available
for their resolution. At Stanford,
that begins with turning to resi
dent assistants, to the resident
fellows, and even to your
dorm mates and classmates. It ex
tends to the University om
budsperson and to the dean of
Student Affairs and to the Stan
ford Police Department. It could
mean coming directly to me.
Sometimes, though, we can
become so concerned with the
desire not to create inadvertent
offense that we create still an
other difficulty, one that finds us
without a safe language in which
to open a discussion about
human difference. That sub
stitutes one problem for another,
because it is sure to inhibit our
best efforts at cross-cultural un
derstanding. The only antidote is
an environment that permits and
even rewards some risk-taking.
I hus, while we should condemn
all forms ot racial disparagement,
we should also welcome sincere
inquiry, even where it may seem
awkward, naive or perhaps tact
less. At the Forum on Racism
here last spring, successful
though it was, we saw some con
spicuous failures in this regard —
incidents in which honest ques
tions drew laughter or, worse,
were ridiculed. We should be dis
turbed when that happens, just as
we are when demeaning state
ments are made about groups.
Finally, I want to point out a
particular challenge and di
lemma: Sometimes — even in the
area of race relations — there are
inevitable collisions between
values, in which something im
portant to us may have to give
way to something else that is also
important.
Surely, for example, it is the
right thing to discourage speech
that is racist, or that does serious
injustice to individual persons.
At the same time, however, uni
versities have always placed ex
traordinary value on the exercise
of free speech. Their special —
and precious — role, after all, is
to be a forum for free expression;
it follows that the protection of
such expression, especially when
it may be controversial, is partic
ularly important in environments
like ours.
Thus we will sometimes find

ourselves in the position of
having to deplore hut neverthe
less withhold censure. For exam
ple, students who lampoon a sin
cere effort to improve awareness
ot gay and lesbian issues, or who
greet a controversial black South
African leader by wearing tires
and shouting "necklace." are
surely guilty of serious offenses
against the values of the Univer
sity. In each ot these cases (they
happen to be real ones, and the
second occurred here) strong ar
guments were made for univer
sity discipline. In each one,
however, it was eventually
decided, and rightly I think, that
the freedom of speech principle
had to win out. But that still does
not mean that we should
condone, by silence, conduct
that offends our sense of decency
and fairness.
I close with these difficult ex
amples for a reason. They are
typical of issues we often see re

solved only abstractly in the
classroom, hut will later find our
selves confronting concretely in
our lives in this community.
I hey have tested the intellect of
the greatest philosophers and his
torians; and in exactly the same
way they will test yours. The
idea that there is some kind of
impermeable barrier between
your academic existence and the
social one that you will live to
gether (alls of its own weight.
V ou are part ot a historical proc
ess, not mere observers of it.
I hat understanding is at the heart
of what we really mean by an in
tellectual lite — not some elitist
notion ol what is clever or cul
tivated, it's the knowledge that
we can put the accumulated wis
dom and reason of our kind to
work here and now , for ourselves
and for the institutions we build
together. , . .
