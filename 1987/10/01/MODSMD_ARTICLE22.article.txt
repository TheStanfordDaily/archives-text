## Vandals spray-paint sculpture Segal statue will be repaired 
### Kathy Lachenauer Staff writer 
The University is currently
spending $2(XK) to restore world
renowned sculptor George
Segal's "Gay Liberation" statue,
according to a University offi
cial.
The official, who wished to
remain anonymous, said the
bronze statue, which depicts two
men standing closely together
and two women sitting on a
bench, is valued at $150,000.
Over the summer unknown
vandals spray-painted the
acronym "AIDS" on one of the
male figures, according to Stan
ford Outdoor Art Committee
Chairman Nathan Oliveira. The
sculpture was promptly and dis
creetly removed from its
prominent campus location for
repairs, Oliveira said. The
sculpture is still being worked on
and will probably be returned to
campus sometime this fall.
The unidentified vandals are
"mindless maniacs who are not
concerned about what it takes to
maintain [art]," Oliveira said,
adding that "the sculpture is
being repaired and it is coming at
a fair expense."
Whether damages occur from
acid rain or from vandals,
Oliveira stressed how very vul
nerable outdoor art is. He said
that "Gay Liberation" is espe
cially fragile because of its deli
cate white coloring.

"Gay Liberation" became a
victim to vandalism shortly after
its installation in February, 1984,
according to Stanford Museum of
Art Designer/Fabricator Frank
Kommer. Severe damage,
caused by hammer blows.

occured in March of that year,
Kommer said.
Despite the two serious at
tacks, former Chairman of Stan
ford's Outdoor Art Committee
John Merry man said that "Gay
Liberation" is a totally inof

fensive work that arouses contro
versy only because of its title.
"It (the sculpture) could be
people waiting for a bus,"
Oliveira added.
But Classics Prof. John
Winkler, the first openly
declared gay professor to be
promoted to tenure at Stanford,
called the statue a "lightning
rod" for some homophobic stu
dents. Winkler urged the Stan
ford community to "follow the
lead of Don Kennedy," who told
the freshman class last week that
intolerant behavior to gays and
lesbians simply would not be
tolerated at Stanford.
Winkler added that he feels
like "a different person" because
of the statue's presence on
campus, explaining that van
dalism to the statue reminded
him of the attacks against him as
a gay.
"Respecting the sculpture is
like respecting people," Art
Prof. Albert HI sen said. "It's
more cowardly to attack the
statue than the people because
the sculpture can't tight back."
"Gay Liberation" is not the
only Stanford outdoor art work
to have been damaged severely
by vandals. A bronzed portrait
commemorating the Stanford
family is presently "in hiding"
because a student once cut off a
finger from one of the figures for
a souvenir, Oliveira said.
