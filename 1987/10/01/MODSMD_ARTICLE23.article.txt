"It's good to be back,"
James Lyons, dean of Student
Affairs, said of his recent
return from a four-month med
ical leave of absence. It
seemed "very natural" to
resume work, he said, adding
that Stanford looks "that
much better" after his break.
Lyons left his post tempo
rarily on the advice of his doc
tors, after discovering that he
had a heart condition ag
gravated by weight-related
problems and stress-induced
high blood pressure.
Lyons said he took the time
off to exercise, change his die
tary habits and reduce stress.
While his absence was
clearly "a burden on some
people," Lyons, who was
temporarily replaced by Asso
ciate Dean of Student Affairs
Norm Robinson, said he felt
the leave was overwhelmingly
beneficial.
Impressed with the work of
colleagues in his absence,
Lyons will be "reorganizing
the student services slightly to
give people more responsibil
ity," he said.
Since his return, "getting
out to more student communi
ties" to meet with students

will he one of Lyons' goals.
Lyons said he also hopes to
secure funds from the Centen
nial fundraising campaign to
build new undergraduate
housing. Approximately $18
million dollars from the Cen
tennial fund are now being tar
geted for new residences, ac
cording to Lyons.
"It's our intent to solve the
housing problem and guaran
tee housing for all those
(students) who want it,"he
said, adding that planning for
construction, by the Student
Services Office, should be un
der way by next month.
Such a housing project
would have to provide space
for approximately 4(H) people,
Lyons said. Sites eurrently un
der consideration include the
Manzanita Park area and the
area now occupied by the golf
driving range, which would
have to be relocated.
Lyons said he believes that
student residences play an im
portant role in teaching people
to be more open-minded to dif
ferences.
A university must be a place
"where differences can be
varied and there is tolerance of
ideas," Lyons said.
"We need to help students cel
ebrate the human differences
among us, he honest with each
other, be critics and friends."
Lyons said he hopes to
strongly promote co-ops, theme
houses, cultural centers, Bechtel
International Center and the Vil
lage Center at Escondido.
"We want (these places| to be
important to the lives of students
who are there," l.yons said.
Since his return, another chal
lenge l.yons faces is to maintain
the healthy lifestyle he has
striven to adopt during his leave.
Living healthfully "is one of
those things that you have to
continually work at," Lyons
said, adding that "there's no
magic solution to it."
"When you are engaged in a
habit, Lyons said, "be it
smoking, eating, drinking or any
thing that has no immediate
short-term consequences, you
lose sight of the long-term prob
lems it can cause."
Realizing that his lifestyle was
quite similar to most Stanford
students, Lyons said he saw
facing his dilemma as a way to
set an example for students.
