## SOAR plans adventures 
### Lori Silver Editorial Staff 
Ten Stanford students will escape the florescent
lights of Green Library and the post-football game
traffic jams on Campus Drive to experience a hit of
the great outdoors this weekend.
But their backpacking trip in Yosemite will be
different from the usual outdoor excursion. The
three-day trip was organized by Stanford Outdoor
Adventures and Recreation (SOAR). Sharing the
responsibilities for the trip's organization and oper
ation, 10 diverse people will become one cohesive
group.
A unique Stanford resource, SOAR otters
cooperative adventures, skill clinics, slide shows
and special events to the Stanford community.
SOAR also organizes trips for organizations or
dorms, rents equipment and houses a resource file
and a library.
Started by a graduate student who wanted to go
mountain climbing, SOAR is financed by Tresidder
Union. Mary Duffy, the current director of SOAR,
was hired in 1982 to get the program off the ground.
Duffy is busy this quarter organizing a ropes
course for a Stanford dorm. Dorm members will
walk on a cable 40 feet off the ground and will work
together to get every member of their group over a
30-foot wall.
"People will feel connected by going through the
scary activities," Duffy said, adding that the activi
ties are perfectly safe.
Although not all SOAR trips are as challenging as
this, many do require a sense of adventure. Canoe
ing the Russian River, backpacking to Sykes Hot
Springs, horseback riding on the beach and an
overnight bike trip are all scheduled for this quar
ter.
For students with a taste for the unusual and ex
citing, Duffy suggested a Barbary Coast tour of San
Francisco, which features a tour of the waterfronts
followed by a Chinese dinner cooked by a noted
chef.
Students looking for the ultimate adrenaline kick
can use SOAR to go whale watching from kayaks,
Duffy said. Participants travel to the Monterey kelp
beds where they can observe sea otters and whales
up close.

SOAR's cooperative adventures are initiated,
lead and directed by students. They take care of the
logistics and SOAR arranges for the equipment and
reservations, Duffy said.
"If you'd like to go to Yosemite, but you don't
know anything, we'll help out," Duffy said. She
recommended that any student interested in plan
ning a trip attend the trip planning and information
meeting oct. 6.
No experience is needed to plan a wilderness
trip, Duffy said. For a student organizing an outing
to see the Ano Nuevo Elephant Seals, for example,
Duffy explained that all the student has to do is or
ganize a pre-trip meeting and get the car pools to
gether.
"1 would encourage people who don't have any
background to come in because it really is a lot of
fun," she said.
Jenny Schmitz, a junior majoring in International
Relations, who organized a trip to Yosemite this
summer, cailed it a "great experience."
For Schmitz, the highlight of her trip was a 12-
hour hike to the top of Half Dome. "We had to
climb up cables to get to the top of the mountain,"
she said. "There was a great view from the top."
SOAR clinics give students a chance to learn
new skills like mountaineering, rock climbing and
kayaking on San Francisco Bay. Unlike
cooperatives, SOAR hires qualified instructors and
provides much of the trip organization, although
students are still expected to share in trip responsi
bilities.
This quarter, clinics offered will include moun
taineering at Mt. Conness in Yosemite. Skiing will
be offered in the winter and rafting and kayaking in
the spring.
Schmitz added that one of the benefits of SOAR
trips is the chance to meet new people.
"Usually we get a group of random people.
When we do get that kind of group, they get along
really well on the trip," Schmitz said.
She described the makeup of most groups as half
graduate students and half undergraduates with
many of the participants being foreign students.
The cost for trips, which includes transportation,
dinner and equipment, ranges from $22 for a three
day backpacking trip in Yosemite to $60 for moun
taineering.
