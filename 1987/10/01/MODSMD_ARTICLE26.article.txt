To start Scott Stark or not to
start Scott Stark — that is not
only a tongue-twister, hut is also
the question buzzing around the
sidelines of Stanford football
practices this week.

Almost every day, a group of
alumni — ranging from as far
back as the Class of 1931 — and
other Cardinal fans lounge in the
shade of the trees which sur
round the Stanford practice field.
And Stark is the quarterback
they want to see start on Satur
day against UCLA.
On Monday, Coach Jack El
way began giving sophomore
Stark more snaps with the first
team offense, because starting
quarterback Greg Ennis has led
the Cardinal to an 0-3 start. Ennis
continues to get some repeti
tions, so the question is: whom
should Elway hand the ball to?
"Stark, Stark, Stark, Stark,
Stark," one gentleman said from
behind the dashboard of his
parked car. "He should have
been given a chance earlier in the
season."
This brings us to the status-quo
syndrome. Many of these folks
on the sidelines believe Elway
has been too stubborn in sticking
with Ennis.
"Yes, he (Ennis) has paid his
dues, it's his fourth year here,
and the players and coaches like
him," another spectator said.
"But 1 don't think he'll ever get
much better.'"
In other words, Elway and
staff might have been paying too
much attention to Ennis' great at
titude and work ethic, and not
enough attention to how he per
formed in the games?
"That was obvious to me after
the very first game," said a
gentleman who graduated from
Stanford in the early 19305.

"Elway was almost defiant in the
way he said 'Ennis is my QB.
He's going to get better, and
don't ask me about that any
more.' But that's just my
opinion. Hey, I'm a sidewalk
Board of Directors."
Another member of the Cardi
nal quorum phrased his argument
against Ennis in a more eloquent
manner.
"It's like taking a concert
pianist who's reached a certain
level and asking him to play a
concerto with more feeling,
tempo, etc. Ennis has reached
his potential already."
None of these gentlemen
meant any discredit to Greg En
nis. Most of them said something
like, "He's trying his best," or,
"He's got a lot of heart."
But they just don't think Ennis
has the talent to be a "Stanford
quarterback."
"They (the coaches) should
have known Ennis was too
awkward to be a quarterback
here," the man behind the dash
board said.
Obviously the sentiment is
against Mr. Ennis. But why so
gung-ho for Mr. Stark, who
hasn't had a down of college ex
perience?
"Seriously, overall Stark has
the greater potential," the elo
quent man said. "He's got natu
ral talent, in case there's any
other kind of talent, that Ennis
just doesn't have."
It is true that in practice Stark
looks more like a classic drop
back quarterback than Ennis.
And Stanford has certainly had
success in the past with quarter
backs who felt comfortable in the
pocket and could throw deep.
But should Elway give Stark his
debut against a team as tough as
UCLA?
"To put him in against UCLA
is asking an awful lot," Mr.
Board of Directors said. "They'll
definitely go after him (because
he's inexperienced), and they'll
also want revenge because we
beat them last year."
As the conversation contin
ued, Stark ran some plays on the
Held. He looked comfortable in


Chris
Fialko
the pocket, and his passes hit the
mark, even though they were
rather wobbly.
Hopefully for these and other
Cardinal fans, if Stark starts,
he'll be calm enough to see some
of the open receivers the fans
see.
"(Knnis) has happy feet in the
pocket, and he's always looking
around so nervously that he can't
zoom in on someone open, the
eloquent one said.
Finally as the conversation
broke up. Stark lofted a 30-yard
touchdown strike to Jeff James in
the corner of the end zone. We'll
see if he gets the chance to do the
same on Saturday.

Stark," one gentleman said from
behind the dashboard of his
parked car. "He should have
been given a chance earlier in the
season."
This brings us to the status-quo
syndrome. Many of these folks
on the sidelines believe Elway
has been too stubborn in sticking
with Ennis.
"Yes, he (Ennis) has paid his
dues, it's his fourth year here,
and the players and coaches like
him," another spectator said.
"But 1 don't think he'll ever get
much better.'"
In other words, Elway and
staff might have been paying too
much attention to Ennis' great at
titude and work ethic, and not
enough attention to how he per
formed in the games?
"That was obvious to me after
the very first game," said a
gentleman who graduated from
Stanford in the early 19305.

"Elway was almost defiant in the
way he said 'Ennis is my QB.
He's going to get better, and
don't ask me about that any
more.' But that's just my
opinion. Hey, I'm a sidewalk
Board of Directors."
Another member of the Cardi
nal quorum phrased his argument
against Ennis in a more eloquent
manner.
"It's like taking a concert
pianist who's reached a certain
level and asking him to play a
concerto with more feeling,
tempo, etc. Ennis has reached
his potential already."
None of these gentlemen
meant any discredit to Greg En
nis. Most of them said something
like, "He's trying his best," or,
"He's got a lot of heart."
But they just don't think Ennis
has the talent to be a "Stanford
quarterback."
"They (the coaches) should
have known Ennis was too
awkward to be a quarterback
here," the man behind the dash
board said.
Obviously the sentiment is
against Mr. Ennis. But why so
gung-ho for Mr. Stark, who
hasn't had a down of college ex
perience?
"Seriously, overall Stark has
the greater potential," the elo
quent man said. "He's got natu
ral talent, in case there's any
other kind of talent, that Ennis
just doesn't have."
It is true that in practice Stark
looks more like a classic drop
back quarterback than Ennis.
And Stanford has certainly had
success in the past with quarter
backs who felt comfortable in the
pocket and could throw deep.
But should Elway give Stark his
debut against a team as tough as
UCLA?
"To put him in against UCLA
is asking an awful lot," Mr.
Board of Directors said. "They'll
definitely go after him (because
he's inexperienced), and they'll
also want revenge because we
beat them last year."
As the conversation contin
ued, Stark ran some plays on the
Held. He looked comfortable in


Chris
Fialko
the pocket, and his passes hit the
mark, even though they were
rather wobbly.
Hopefully for these and other
Cardinal fans, if Stark starts,
he'll be calm enough to see some
of the open receivers the fans
see.
"(Knnis) has happy feet in the
pocket, and he's always looking
around so nervously that he can't
zoom in on someone open, the
eloquent one said.
Finally as the conversation
broke up. Stark lofted a 30-yard
touchdown strike to Jeff James in
the corner of the end zone. We'll
see if he gets the chance to do the
same on Saturday.
To start Scott Stark or not to
start Scott Stark — that is not
only a tongue-twister, hut is also
the question buzzing around the
sidelines of Stanford football
practices this week.

Almost every day, a group of
alumni — ranging from as far
back as the Class of 1931 — and
other Cardinal fans lounge in the
shade of the trees which sur
round the Stanford practice field.
And Stark is the quarterback
they want to see start on Satur
day against UCLA.
On Monday, Coach Jack El
way began giving sophomore
Stark more snaps with the first
team offense, because starting
quarterback Greg Ennis has led
the Cardinal to an 0-3 start. Ennis
continues to get some repeti
tions, so the question is: whom
should Elway hand the ball to?
"Stark, Stark, Stark, Stark,
Stark," one gentleman said from
behind the dashboard of his
parked car. "He should have
been given a chance earlier in the
season."
This brings us to the status-quo
syndrome. Many of these folks
