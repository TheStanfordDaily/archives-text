# Stanford hosts Jostens Invite
## UCSB, Texas, Cal visit Maples 
### Chris Crader Editorial staff 
It doesn't get any better than
this.
That could very well be the
slogan of the Jostens Invitational
Tournament as four of the top
women's volleyball teams in the
country converge on Maples
Pavilion tonight and tomorrow
night. Play kicks off at 6 p.m. as
Stanford takes on UC-Santa Bar
bara. Immediately following that
match, at 8 p.m., Texas will bat
tle California.
The consolation and champi
onship matches will be played at
6 p.m. and 8 p.m. tomorrow
night.
According to the American
Volleyball Coaches Association
rankings, released Tuesday,
Stanford would appear to be the
favorite, as the Cardinal is pres
ently ranked fifth. UCSB is
ranked 13th, while in the other
semifinal, the Longhorns are
ranked 11th and California is just
out of the top 20.
The fact that the Cardinal is
ranked higher than the Gauchos

does not mean much, however.
First, the Gauchos have won
seven of the eight matches be
tween the two teams, although
their last meeting was back in
September of 1983 (a five-game
Stanford win). UCSB also has a
penchant for upsetting highly
ranked teams.
In UCSB's first match last
year, they upset top-ranked and
defending national champion
Pacific, ending the Tigers' 27-
match home winning streak. The
Gauchos also beat San Jose State
and San Diego State, two other
teams that were ranked No. 1 last
year.
The Gauchos finished last
season with a 24-12 record and a
No. 9 national ranking. They had
a 12-6 record in the Pacific Coast
Athletic Association (PCAA),
good for fourth place behind only
Pacific (ranked No. 1 in the
country), Hawaii (No. 3) and San
Jose State (No. 4).
UCSB is off to a 11-5 start this
season, 3-2 in the PCAA. Their
most recent victory occured last

night, when the Gauchos beat
Cal Poly-SLO in a two-and-a-half
hour match by a score of 8-15,
15-10, 15-11, 7-15, 16-14.
Tonight's match should prove a
good test of their physical condi
tioning after the marathon win.
The Gauchos are led by two
seniors, Judy Bellomo and Yami
Menendez. Bellomo, a 5-foot-10
middle blocker, is hitting at a
.320 clip this season. She also set
a school record with 87 block as
sists last year. And after only one
year at UCSB (she transferred
after two years at Nevada-Las
Vegas when (he Rebels dissolved
their volleyball program), she is
in the top 10 in school history in

three different statistical
categories.
Menendez, also in only her
second year as a Gaucho after
transferring from El Camino
Junior College, is a 5-8 starter on
the outside. She's hitting .297
this year, after hitting .273 last
year. She is Coach Kathy
Gregory's top returnee in both
kills (342 last year) and digs
(361).
The Gauchos other returning
starter is All-America candidate
Liz Towne. The junior setter is in
her third year as a starter and will
he trying to improve on the
second-team All-PC A A honors
she won last year. As a fresh
man, Towne led the nation in as
sists, averaging 13.1 per game.
Last year she broke her own
school record by tallying 1439
total assists, an average of 12.4

per game. She also reeorded 301
digs last year.
The Cardinal appears to have
the talent to contain the
Gauchos, though. Stanford
comes in having won its last
three matches and 11 ot its last 13
games, and senior I eresa Smith
has recovered from her mild
ankle sprain.
The 6-foot outside hitter
missed all of the Washington
match last Saturday but came
hack to lead the Cardinal to a
sweep of Cal two days ago.
Smith posted a match-high
kills on only 28 attempts, good
for a .571 hitting percentage.
Also hot for Stanford are
senior Nancy Reno (13 kills
versus the Bears) and junior
Laura Olesen, who is nominated
for the Pacific 10 Conference
Player of the Week award for this
past week.
Stanford comes in with an 8-3
record, and is in second place in
the Pac-1() with a 4-1 mark.
The other semifinal should also
prove interesting. The Golden
Bears come into the tournament
as the only team not in the top 20,
but they have a young and
steadily improving team. They
are now 5-6 following a loss to
Stanford Tuesday night in
Berkeley, and are currently sixth
in the Pac-10 with a 2-3 mark.
The team has two freshmen
starting, and 10 of the 13 players
on the roster are either freshmen
or sophomores. Such a young

team obviously has a great deal
of room for improvement, and
the upset-minded Bears are
shooting to play their way into
the top 20 this year.
The Longhorns, on the other
hand, are dependent on returning
middle blockers Dawn Daven
port and Karen Kramer. The two
returning starters and All-
America candidates helped lead
the team to its first-ever Final
Four appearence last year and
should be the key to this year's
performance.
The Longhorns' biggest prob
lem this year is replacing
graduated All-America setter
Eva Murray, but they have junior
Sue Schelfhout, Murray's under
study the past two seasons, as
well as freshman Dagmara
Szyszczak, a finalist for the
Texas high school Player-of-the-
Year award last year.
It doesn't get any better than

bara. Immediately following that
match, at 8 p.m., Texas will bat
tle California.
The consolation and champi
onship matches will be played at
6 p.m. and 8 p.m. tomorrow

According to the American
Volleyball Coaches Association
rankings, released Tuesday,
Stanford would appear to be the
favorite, as the Cardinal is pres
ently ranked fifth. UCSB is
ranked 13th, while in the other
semifinal, the Longhorns are
ranked 11th and California is just
out of the top 20.
The fact that the Cardinal is
ranked higher than the Gauchos

does not mean much, however.
First, the Gauchos have won
seven of the eight matches be
tween the two teams, although
their last meeting was back in
September of 1983 (a five-game
Stanford win). UCSB also has a
penchant for upsetting highly
ranked teams.
In UCSB's first match last
year, they upset top-ranked and
defending national champion
Pacific, ending the Tigers' 27-
match home winning streak. The
Gauchos also beat San Jose State
and San Diego State, two other
teams that were ranked No. 1 last
year.
The Gauchos finished last
season with a 24-12 record and a
No. 9 national ranking. They had
a 12-6 record in the Pacific Coast
Athletic Association (PCAA),
good for fourth place behind only
Pacific (ranked No. 1 in the
country), Hawaii (No. 3) and San
Jose State (No. 4).
UCSB is off to a 11-5 start this
season, 3-2 in the PCAA. Their
most recent victory occured last

night, when the Gauchos beat
Cal Poly-SLO in a two-and-a-half
hour match by a score of 8-15,
15-10, 15-11, 7-15, 16-14.
Tonight's match should prove a
good test of their physical condi
tioning after the marathon win.
The Gauchos are led by two
seniors, Judy Bellomo and Yami
Menendez. Bellomo, a 5-foot-10
middle blocker, is hitting at a
.320 clip this season. She also set
a school record with 87 block as
sists last year. And after only one
year at UCSB (she transferred
after two years at Nevada-Las
Vegas when (he Rebels dissolved
their volleyball program), she is
in the top 10 in school history in

three different statistical
categories.
Menendez, also in only her
second year as a Gaucho after
transferring from El Camino
Junior College, is a 5-8 starter on
the outside. She's hitting .297
this year, after hitting .273 last
year. She is Coach Kathy
Gregory's top returnee in both
kills (342 last year) and digs
(361).
The Gauchos other returning
starter is All-America candidate
Liz Towne. The junior setter is in
her third year as a starter and will
he trying to improve on the
second-team All-PC A A honors
she won last year. As a fresh
man, Towne led the nation in as
sists, averaging 13.1 per game.
Last year she broke her own
school record by tallying 1439
total assists, an average of 12.4

per game. She also reeorded 301
digs last year.
The Cardinal appears to have
the talent to contain the
Gauchos, though. Stanford
comes in having won its last
three matches and 11 ot its last 13
games, and senior I eresa Smith
has recovered from her mild
ankle sprain.
The 6-foot outside hitter
missed all of the Washington
match last Saturday but came
hack to lead the Cardinal to a
sweep of Cal two days ago.
Smith posted a match-high
kills on only 28 attempts, good
for a .571 hitting percentage.
Also hot for Stanford are
senior Nancy Reno (13 kills
versus the Bears) and junior
Laura Olesen, who is nominated
for the Pacific 10 Conference
Player of the Week award for this
past week.
Stanford comes in with an 8-3
record, and is in second place in
the Pac-1() with a 4-1 mark.
The other semifinal should also
prove interesting. The Golden
Bears come into the tournament
as the only team not in the top 20,
but they have a young and
steadily improving team. They
are now 5-6 following a loss to
Stanford Tuesday night in
Berkeley, and are currently sixth
in the Pac-10 with a 2-3 mark.
The team has two freshmen
starting, and 10 of the 13 players
on the roster are either freshmen
or sophomores. Such a young

team obviously has a great deal
of room for improvement, and
the upset-minded Bears are
shooting to play their way into
the top 20 this year.
The Longhorns, on the other
hand, are dependent on returning
middle blockers Dawn Daven
port and Karen Kramer. The two
returning starters and All-
America candidates helped lead
the team to its first-ever Final
Four appearence last year and
should be the key to this year's
performance.
The Longhorns' biggest prob
lem this year is replacing
graduated All-America setter
Eva Murray, but they have junior
Sue Schelfhout, Murray's under
study the past two seasons, as
well as freshman Dagmara
Szyszczak, a finalist for the
Texas high school Player-of-the-
Year award last year.
It doesn't get any better than
this.
That could very well be the
slogan of the Jostens Invitational
Tournament as four of the top
women's volleyball teams in the
country converge on Maples
Pavilion tonight and tomorrow
night. Play kicks off at 6 p.m. as
Stanford takes on UC-Santa Bar
bara. Immediately following that
match, at 8 p.m., Texas will bat
