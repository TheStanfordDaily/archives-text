### Chris Crader Editorial staff 
It doesn't get any better than
this.
That could very well be the
slogan of the Jostens Invitational
Tournament as four of the top
women's volleyball teams in the
country converge on Maples
Pavilion tonight and tomorrow
night. Play kicks off at 6 p.m. as
Stanford takes on UC-Santa Bar
bara. Immediately following that
match, at 8 p.m., Texas will bat
tle California.
The consolation and champi
onship matches will be played at
6 p.m. and 8 p.m. tomorrow
night.
According to the American
Volleyball Coaches Association
rankings, released Tuesday,
Stanford would appear to be the
favorite, as the Cardinal is pres
ently ranked fifth. UCSB is
ranked 13th, while in the other
semifinal, the Longhorns are
ranked 11th and California is just
out of the top 20.
The fact that the Cardinal is
ranked higher than the Gauchos

does not mean much, however.
First, the Gauchos have won
seven of the eight matches be
tween the two teams, although
their last meeting was back in
September of 1983 (a five-game
Stanford win). UCSB also has a
penchant for upsetting highly
ranked teams.
In UCSB's first match last
year, they upset top-ranked and
defending national champion
Pacific, ending the Tigers' 27-
match home winning streak. The
Gauchos also beat San Jose State
and San Diego State, two other
teams that were ranked No. 1 last
year.
The Gauchos finished last
season with a 24-12 record and a
No. 9 national ranking. They had
a 12-6 record in the Pacific Coast
Athletic Association (PCAA),
good for fourth place behind only
Pacific (ranked No. 1 in the
country), Hawaii (No. 3) and San
Jose State (No. 4).
UCSB is off to a 11-5 start this
season, 3-2 in the PCAA. Their
most recent victory occured last

Pavilion.
