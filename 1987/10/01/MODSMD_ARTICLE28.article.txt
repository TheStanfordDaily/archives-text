Showing a great similarity to tine wine,
women's volleyball in the Pacific 10 Con
ference is getting better with age.
Last year, the first in which women's
sports were played under the title of the the
Pac-10, the conference volleyball season
quickly became a two-team show, as
UCLA and Stanford ran away from the
field. This year, there are at least three
teams staking a strong claim to the confer
ence title, and the league appears deeper
throughout. In fact, Arizona State, cur
rently tied for seventh in the league, has
been in the top 20 in the nation for most of
this young season.
Conference play is now just over two
weeks old, and here is an in-depth guide to

the contenders, the pretenders and those
who should just give up:
Oregon
The Ducks (7-3 overall, 4-0 in Pac-10
play, ranked 12th in the nation) just com
pleted the best weekend in Oregon volley
ball history. They hosted USC and UCLA,
both then undefeated in conference play.
The Ducks beat both the Trojans and the
Bruins by identical 3-1 scores and took over
the league lead. This was the Ducks first
ever win over UCLA, and it threw a shock
into the other conference teams.
Oregon is led by outside hitters Teri
Kramer and Michele Krebsbach, both of
whom were in the top five in the nation in
kills last year, but the Ducks' success is due
primarily to the fact that setter Stephanie
Snyder is orchestrating a more balanced at
tack this year.

Stanford
Stanford (8-3, 4-1, sth) has coped well so
far with the graduation of two starters, as
Lara Asper, Amy Hayes and Jenny Chaffee
have stepped in and played well. The
strength of the Cardinal squad still lies with
its seniors, however, and setter Wendi
Rush, outside hitter Teresa Smith and
middle blocker Nancy Reno are all having
good years. Stanford is only one-half game
out of first and will face Oregon in Eugene
one week from Saturday.
UCLA
UCLA (8-3, 3-1, 6th) took the early lead
in the conference race by beating Stanford
in both teams' Pac-10 opener, but lost its
203 advantage by dropping the match at
Oregon last week. The Bruins are led by
