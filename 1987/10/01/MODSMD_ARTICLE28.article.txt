# Cardinal, Bruins, Ducks seek title
##

Showing a great similarity to tine wine,
women's volleyball in the Pacific 10 Con
ference is getting better with age.
Last year, the first in which women's
sports were played under the title of the the
Pac-10, the conference volleyball season
quickly became a two-team show, as
UCLA and Stanford ran away from the
field. This year, there are at least three
teams staking a strong claim to the confer
ence title, and the league appears deeper
throughout. In fact, Arizona State, cur
rently tied for seventh in the league, has
been in the top 20 in the nation for most of
this young season.
Conference play is now just over two
weeks old, and here is an in-depth guide to

the contenders, the pretenders and those
who should just give up:
Oregon
The Ducks (7-3 overall, 4-0 in Pac-10
play, ranked 12th in the nation) just com
pleted the best weekend in Oregon volley
ball history. They hosted USC and UCLA,
both then undefeated in conference play.
The Ducks beat both the Trojans and the
Bruins by identical 3-1 scores and took over
the league lead. This was the Ducks first
ever win over UCLA, and it threw a shock
into the other conference teams.
Oregon is led by outside hitters Teri
Kramer and Michele Krebsbach, both of
whom were in the top five in the nation in
kills last year, but the Ducks' success is due
primarily to the fact that setter Stephanie
Snyder is orchestrating a more balanced at
tack this year.

Stanford
Stanford (8-3, 4-1, sth) has coped well so
far with the graduation of two starters, as
Lara Asper, Amy Hayes and Jenny Chaffee
have stepped in and played well. The
strength of the Cardinal squad still lies with
its seniors, however, and setter Wendi
Rush, outside hitter Teresa Smith and
middle blocker Nancy Reno are all having
good years. Stanford is only one-half game
out of first and will face Oregon in Eugene
one week from Saturday.
UCLA
UCLA (8-3, 3-1, 6th) took the early lead
in the conference race by beating Stanford
in both teams' Pac-10 opener, but lost its
203 advantage by dropping the match at
Oregon last week. The Bruins are led by
junior setter Ann Buyer, one of
the top setters in the nation.
They have a very strong
middle attack with 6-foot-3 Stacy
Buck and 6-1 Daiva Tomkus, and
great outside hitters in Lori
Zeno, Wendy Fletcher and fresh
man Samantna Shaver. They also
have the hest defensive specialist
in the conference in Julie Barnes,
hut they have almost no experi
enced players to come off the

bench. UCLA vmII get a rematch
with Oregon on Oct. 23.
Arizona
The Wildcats (KM. 2-1, 17th)
showed they will he tough this
year hy heating Arizona State
last week, hut they have the
toughest part of their schedule —
including games with Stanford
and UCI A ahead.
They have an up-and-coming
setter in sophomore Lindsay
Hahn, and the attack is led by
middle blockers Stephanie Murry
and Leigh Halliwell, who can
double as a setter. The win over

ASU was the Wildcats' first
defeat of the Sun Devils since
I9SS.
use
USC <5-4. 2 2, IXth) has al
ready more than doubled its win
output from last year, when inju
ries to four starters resulted in a
2-32 record. Injuries still haunt
the Trojans, though, as setter
Kathi Rich, scheduled to start,
was forced to retire from volley
ball because of a knee injury,
Christine Brigman has done a
good job in her place, however,
and outside hitters Nancy Hill

man, Vleana Carrasco, An
toinette White and Lonise
Norfleet pack a big punch. The
Trojans also have one of the
youngest lineups in the country,
with freshmen Megan McCal
lister, White and Norfleet often
teaming with sophomores Brig
man and Carrasco on the floor.
California
California (5-6, 2-3, unranked)
swept the Washington schools in
Berkeley last weekend to move
into sixth place in the confer
ence. The Bears are another
young team, starting two fresh

men. and should improve as the
season goes on. Cal is looking to
enter the top 20 and to qualify for
the N( AA playoffs for the first
time since 1983.
Sophomore Tiffany Koehelle
leads the offense from her
outside hitter spot, and Holly
MePeak has won the starting set
ting job as a freshman. The
Bears, with only three seniors
and no juniors on their roster,
will he a foree in the conference
for the next few years.
Washington
The Huskies (13-3, 1-2, un
ranked) lost only one starter from
last year's NCAA playoff team.
That one loss was at setter, but
Hawaii transfer Melinda Becken
hauer has taken over the starting
spot. The Huskies are led by
middle blocker Laurie Wetzel
and outside hitter Lisa McCam
mond. Washington got off to a
13-1 start, their best in ten years,
but a good test will come when

they face the Arizona schools.
Arizona State
Arizona State (5-4, 1-2, un
ranked) returns three good
players in Kegina Stahl, Tracey
Barberie and Christie Nore, but
was greatly hurt by the gradua
tion of All-Americans Tammy
Webb and Valentina Vega. The
Sun Devils have a good freshman
class including Mindy Gowell
and Tina Berg. Look for the Sun
Devils to start creeping back up
in the standings.
Washington State
The Cougars (9-8, 0-3, un
ranked) have dropped matches to
Washington. Stanford and Cali

fornia already this year, and their
only consolation is that they will
play Oregon State twice this
season. The Cougars have two
good players in Laurie Van Diest
and freshman Susan Guest.
Oregon State
First-year coach Guy Fn
riques was not left with enough
talent to compete in the Pac-10,
but at least the Beavers (1-8, 0-4,
unranked) are trying. They have
a very young team and will look
to improve as the season
progresses. Oregon State has al
ready taken a game from No. 17
Arizona in Tuscon, and the
Beavers have a shot at ninth
place in the conference.

Webb and Valentina Vega. The
Sun Devils have a good freshman
class including Mindy Gowell
and Tina Berg. Look for the Sun
Devils to start creeping back up
in the standings.
Washington State
The Cougars (9-8, 0-3, un
ranked) have dropped matches to
Washington. Stanford and Cali

fornia already this year, and their
only consolation is that they will
play Oregon State twice this
season. The Cougars have two
good players in Laurie Van Diest
and freshman Susan Guest.
Oregon State
First-year coach Guy Fn
riques was not left with enough
talent to compete in the Pac-10,
but at least the Beavers (1-8, 0-4,
unranked) are trying. They have
a very young team and will look
to improve as the season
progresses. Oregon State has al
ready taken a game from No. 17
Arizona in Tuscon, and the
Beavers have a shot at ninth
place in the conference.
Showing a great similarity to tine wine,
women's volleyball in the Pacific 10 Con
ference is getting better with age.
Last year, the first in which women's
sports were played under the title of the the
Pac-10, the conference volleyball season
quickly became a two-team show, as
UCLA and Stanford ran away from the
field. This year, there are at least three
teams staking a strong claim to the confer
ence title, and the league appears deeper
throughout. In fact, Arizona State, cur
rently tied for seventh in the league, has
been in the top 20 in the nation for most of
this young season.
Conference play is now just over two
weeks old, and here is an in-depth guide to

the contenders, the pretenders and those
who should just give up:
Oregon
The Ducks (7-3 overall, 4-0 in Pac-10
play, ranked 12th in the nation) just com
pleted the best weekend in Oregon volley
ball history. They hosted USC and UCLA,
both then undefeated in conference play.
The Ducks beat both the Trojans and the
Bruins by identical 3-1 scores and took over
the league lead. This was the Ducks first
ever win over UCLA, and it threw a shock
into the other conference teams.
Oregon is led by outside hitters Teri
Kramer and Michele Krebsbach, both of
whom were in the top five in the nation in
kills last year, but the Ducks' success is due
primarily to the fact that setter Stephanie
Snyder is orchestrating a more balanced at
tack this year.

Stanford
Stanford (8-3, 4-1, sth) has coped well so
far with the graduation of two starters, as
Lara Asper, Amy Hayes and Jenny Chaffee
have stepped in and played well. The
strength of the Cardinal squad still lies with
its seniors, however, and setter Wendi
Rush, outside hitter Teresa Smith and
middle blocker Nancy Reno are all having
good years. Stanford is only one-half game
out of first and will face Oregon in Eugene
one week from Saturday.
UCLA
UCLA (8-3, 3-1, 6th) took the early lead
in the conference race by beating Stanford
in both teams' Pac-10 opener, but lost its
203 advantage by dropping the match at
Oregon last week. The Bruins are led by
junior setter Ann Buyer, one of
the top setters in the nation.
They have a very strong
middle attack with 6-foot-3 Stacy
Buck and 6-1 Daiva Tomkus, and
great outside hitters in Lori
Zeno, Wendy Fletcher and fresh
man Samantna Shaver. They also
have the hest defensive specialist
in the conference in Julie Barnes,
hut they have almost no experi
enced players to come off the

bench. UCLA vmII get a rematch
with Oregon on Oct. 23.
Arizona
The Wildcats (KM. 2-1, 17th)
showed they will he tough this
year hy heating Arizona State
last week, hut they have the
toughest part of their schedule —
including games with Stanford
and UCI A ahead.
They have an up-and-coming
setter in sophomore Lindsay
Hahn, and the attack is led by
middle blockers Stephanie Murry
and Leigh Halliwell, who can
double as a setter. The win over

ASU was the Wildcats' first
defeat of the Sun Devils since
I9SS.
use
USC <5-4. 2 2, IXth) has al
ready more than doubled its win
output from last year, when inju
ries to four starters resulted in a
2-32 record. Injuries still haunt
the Trojans, though, as setter
Kathi Rich, scheduled to start,
was forced to retire from volley
ball because of a knee injury,
Christine Brigman has done a
good job in her place, however,
and outside hitters Nancy Hill

man, Vleana Carrasco, An
toinette White and Lonise
Norfleet pack a big punch. The
Trojans also have one of the
youngest lineups in the country,
with freshmen Megan McCal
lister, White and Norfleet often
teaming with sophomores Brig
man and Carrasco on the floor.
California
California (5-6, 2-3, unranked)
swept the Washington schools in
Berkeley last weekend to move
into sixth place in the confer
ence. The Bears are another
young team, starting two fresh

men. and should improve as the
season goes on. Cal is looking to
enter the top 20 and to qualify for
the N( AA playoffs for the first
time since 1983.
Sophomore Tiffany Koehelle
leads the offense from her
outside hitter spot, and Holly
MePeak has won the starting set
ting job as a freshman. The
Bears, with only three seniors
and no juniors on their roster,
will he a foree in the conference
for the next few years.
Washington
The Huskies (13-3, 1-2, un
ranked) lost only one starter from
last year's NCAA playoff team.
That one loss was at setter, but
Hawaii transfer Melinda Becken
hauer has taken over the starting
spot. The Huskies are led by
middle blocker Laurie Wetzel
and outside hitter Lisa McCam
mond. Washington got off to a
13-1 start, their best in ten years,
but a good test will come when

they face the Arizona schools.
Arizona State
Arizona State (5-4, 1-2, un
ranked) returns three good
players in Kegina Stahl, Tracey
Barberie and Christie Nore, but
was greatly hurt by the gradua
tion of All-Americans Tammy
Webb and Valentina Vega. The
Sun Devils have a good freshman
class including Mindy Gowell
and Tina Berg. Look for the Sun
