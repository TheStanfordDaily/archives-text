# ASSU alters selection process
## Ethnic groups to nominate minority commission members 
### Elizabeth Howton 
In its first meeting of the
school year, the ASSU Senate
last night passed a bill giving
campus ethnic minority groups
the power to nominate their own
representatives to the Univer
sity's Commission on Minority
Life.
The University formed the
commission last spring in
response to the groups' concerns
about their treatment at Stan
ford. The Black Student Union
(BSU), Asian American Student
Association (AASA), MEChA
and the Stanford American In
dian Organization (SAIO) will
each nominate one member to
the commission, bypassing the

standard process of selecting
committee members through the
ASSU's Nominations Commis
sion.
In other business, the senate
passed a resolution opposing the
confirmation of Judge Robert
Bork to the U.S. Supreme Court,
voted to allow the Speakers
Bureau to exceed its spending
limit to bring a Soviet journalist
to Stanford and passed a bill pro
viding for the establishment of
office hours for senators.
Members of the BSU were on
hand to speak in support of the
nominations procedure bill. BSU
member and former Nominations
Commission Deputy Chair David
Porter said it would be "a great
disservice to the minority com

munity" if the ethnic organiza
tions were not allowed to select
'heir own representatives on the
committee.
Debate on the hill centered on
whether it would allow impartial
investigation of the possibility of
institutionalized racism at Stan
ford and whether the rights of
other minoritv and oppressed
groups, such as women, Jews,
gays and lesbians would be
ignored by the proposed nomina
tion process.
The committee will include
faculty and administration mem
bers in addition to the four stu
dents. The committee was
charged to investigate issues con
cerning "people of color" at
Stanford and to issue a prelimi
nary report by April and a final
report one year from now.
To clarify the role of the com
mittee, the senate also passed a
resolution recommending that
the University change the com
mittee's name to the Commission
on Ethnic Minority Life.
After some debate over the
wording of the resolution, the

senators voted to oppose Bork's
confirmation and to endorse Oct.
6 as a national day of student
protest against Bork.
Senior Stacey Leyton, author
of the bill, said students belong to
the age group most likely to be
affected if Bork were confirmed.
Junior Barb Voss, a representa
tive of SOLGE Stanford Organi
zation for Lesbian and Gay
Equality, voiced that organiza
tion's opposition to Bork due to
his position on right-to-privacy
issues.
The senate bill providing for
office hours for senators,

authored by sophomore Shari
Fetterman, requires senators to
hold at least one office hour per
week in the ASSU offices. When
the measure is implemented, at
least one senator will he in the
ASSU offices from 12 to 5 p.m.
Monday through Friday to an
swer students' questions.
The senate approved a request
by the ASSU Speakers Bureau to
exceed the $2500 spending limit
by $2575 to bring Soviet jour
nalist Vladimir Pozner to campus
Oct. 8. Pozner will be paid a
$5000 honorarium and $75 for
travel expenses.
