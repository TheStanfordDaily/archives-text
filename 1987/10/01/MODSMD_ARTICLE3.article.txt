# ASSU alters selection process
## Ethnic groups to nominate minority commission members 
### Elizabeth Howton 
In its first meeting of the
school year, the ASSU Senate
last night passed a bill giving
campus ethnic minority groups
the power to nominate their own
representatives to the Univer

office hours for senators.
Members of the BSU were on
hand to speak in support of the
nominations procedure bill. BSU
member and former Nominations
Commission Deputy Chair David
Porter said it would be "a great
disservice to the minority com

committee.

investigation of the possibility of
institutionalized racism at Stan
ford and whether the rights of
other minoritv and oppressed
groups, such as women, Jews,
gays and lesbians would be
ignored by the proposed nomina
tion process.
The committee will include
faculty and administration mem

charged to investigate issues con
