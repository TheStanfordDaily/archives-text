# Cardinal golf sports new look

Stocked with new talent and improved re
turning players, the Stanford women's golf
team "is right now the best team we've ever
had," according to Coach Tim Baldwin.
Despite the loss of graduated seniors
Adrienne Gilmartin and three-time Ail-
American Kathleen McCarthy, Baldwin feels
that from his "eight very scrappy players" he
can produce a lineup of five that will repre
sent the Cardinal admirably in the upcoming
season.
This year the Cardinal has a very new look.
In past seasons, the team has relied on solid
performances from veteran players like
McCarthy. T his year there are only four re
turning players from last year's top-20 team.
Consequently, Baldwin will have to rely on
the ability of his new recruits.
Leading the team this year will be senior
Kay Cornelius. Cornelius did not spend much
time on the amateur circuit this summer. In
stead she returned home to Arizona where
she spent most of the summer improving her
fundamentals. Although she still occasionally
slips into her old swing, Baldwin said, "she
gets more and more confident with each pass
ing day."
Cornelius has been chosen a preseason
second-team All-America, and although she
admits she has "a lot of new things to work
on," she feels she can have her best year yet.
"I'm very happy with Kay. She will be a

major factor in collegiate golf this year,
Baldwin said.
In addition to Cornelius, junior Clare
Dolan will he returning to the Stanford lineup
this year. Dolan's performance at Stanford
has been hurt by injuries that in the past have
disrupted her usually strong and consistent
play. This summer she popped a disc in her
back while playing with the Pacific 10 All-
Stars in Taiwan. "The pain was so great she
had to go home," Baldwin said. But Dolan
feels that if she stays healthy she will
definitely make her mark in collegiate golf
this year.
Also returning to the Farm this year are
senior Irish McGonigle and sophomore
Stephanie Parel.
"Stephanie has not had much experience,"
Baldwin said, "but she could be a factor. She
wants to be a factor."
This year inaugurates four excellent fresh
men into the world of collegiate golf: Kath
leen Shanahan, Kristin Ryan. Jodi Figley and
Michele Lyford, the 1986 Junior World
Champion, all figure to contribute to the
Stanford team this year. "They will all make
an impact this year," said Baldwin.
Cornelius and Dolan agree. "They've all
got good records and had very good sum
mers," Dolan said.
Lyford began the season on fire, carding a
76 in a match that pitted both the men's and
women's teams against the People's Republic
of China's national team. "I am really

pleased with Michele. She'll be very strong
this year," said Baldwin.
Baldwin enjoyed watching the matches
against the Chinese team. " The chemistry
between the two teams was terrific," he
added.
The Chinese have only been playing golf
for three years, and according to Baldwin are
returning next year for a series of three
matches against Stanford. "I could see their
top players applying (to Stanford) in a couple
of years," he said.
The Cardinal enters the season ranked 12th
in the nation, but Cornelius feels that "we
can do better than that."
Baldwin has trimmed the fall schedule
down to only two tournaments. Normally the
team would spend the first week of classes in
New Mexico. But Baldwin felt that taking
away the first week from the players, particu
larly the freshmen, was not right. Cornelius
agreed: "You spend the first week of school
on the road, and when you come back every
one has already formed their friendships, and
you almost feel like you're barging in on
everything."
The team's first tournament is next
weekend in Seattle. Not all of the top teams
in the country will be there, so Baldwin ex
pects his team to finish very well.
The scene changes, however, when Stan
ford hosts its fall tournament later in the
