Four Stanford academics
recently testified before the Sen
ate Judiciary Committee at the
confirmation hearings of U.S.
Supreme Court nominee Judge
Robert Bork.
Hoover Fellow Thomas Sowell
and I.aw School professors Bar
bara Babcock, Tom Campbell
and Thomas Grey gave tes
timony before the committee.
Babcock, who testified on is
sues of gender and justice, told
The Daily yesterday that Bork's
decisions as a justice on the U.S.
Circuit Court of Appeals for the
District of Columbia were "15
years behind contemporary
thinking on sex discrimination
and civil rights."
Babcock cited a 1986 opinion
written by Bork which referred
to a case of sexual harassment as
"an office romance, a mere dal
liance." The Supreme Court, in a
later appeal, voted 9-0 in favor of
the plaintiff, a woman.
" Though there is just one case
(in which) to explore Bork's view
of sex discrimination, the Su
preme Court's unanimous deci
sion shows that he was funda

mentally unsympathetic in a de
veloping area of the law," Bab
cock said.
Campbell testified in support
of Bork s record on labor law,
disputing an AFL-CIO report
that accused Bork of hostility
toward unions.
Campbell described Bork's de
cisions in such cases as "very
middle-of-the- road."
Campbell said that a study he
made of all 10 of Bork's opinions
in labor-related cases showed
that Bork had "no bias either
way and that the AFL-CIO
report was not quite accurate."
Sowell, one of the few blacks
who spoke in support of Bork's
nomination, stated in testimony

"shrill propaganda from special
interest groups" was preventing
objective evaluation of Bork's
record, the New York limes re
ported.
According to the limes,
Sowell argued during his tes
timony that civil rights were not a
"special benefit to minorities,
but something essential to every
one" and that Bork's legal schol
arship demonstrates his opposi
tion to racial discrimination.
Sowell declined to comment
when contacted yesterday .
Grey, who appeared before the
committee to denounce Bork's
decisions on constitutional the
ory and equal protection, was un
available for comment yesterday.
