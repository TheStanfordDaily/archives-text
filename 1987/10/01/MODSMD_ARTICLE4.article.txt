# Music department cuts back
## 
### Vida Tigrani 
Non-majors may find it difficult to
enroll in beginning music classes this
quarter because of funding cuts in the
Music Department.
The department has eliminated all
beginning guitar classes and signifi
cantly reduced the number of begin
ning piano and beginning flute classes
for non-majors. These classes remain
available to majors, administrators
said.
According to Department Adminis
trator John Planting, the Music Depart

ment received less money from the
University this year and had to decide
where to make cuts in its own budget.
Most of the cuts came in teachers'
salaries. Instructors who received
salary cuts are teaching fewer classes
than in the past. Planting said, so the
department was forced to reduce the
number of classes it could offer to non
majors.
According to a University official,
the budget cuts were made as part of a
routine process of "general cuts in . . .
(several) areas of the school's budget.

"There are cuts every year, said
Susan Schofield, associate dean of the
School of Humanities and Sciences.
She called this year's cuts "fairly
modest."
Schofield emphasized that the Music
Department — not the University —
made the decisions about where to
make the cuts. "We (the University)
don't have any direct involvement in
how the cuts are made." she said.
Schofield also said school adminis
trators are looking at ways to solve the
problem of inadequate funding.
