## County releases prisoners 
### Jordan Ethe 
Over 100 prisoners were released
from Santa Clara County jails on Tues
day, but Stanford Director of Public
Safety Marvin Herrington anticipates
no direct impact on the Stanford com
munity.
The release of the prisoners — the
largest such release in the history of the
Santa Clara County jail system — is the
latest step in a controversial effort to
reduce prison overcrowding in the
county's jails.
Herrington said the Stanford police
does not expect any unusual problems
on campus, because none of the
released inmates are violent offenders
and none are from the Stanford com
munity.
"The University does not feel the
need to take any special precautions,'"
hC said
The release of prisoners stems from
a decision by Alameda County Supe

rior Court Judge Henry Ramsey Jr.,
who ordered the county to reduce its
jail population to 26(H) inmates by Oct.
5. Currently, the county jails house
several hundred more prisoners than
Ramsey deems acceptable.
The Santa Clara County Sheriffs
Department, which is handling the pro
gram. will release approximately 1(H)
prisoners a day until the requirements
of the court order are met.
Herrington said the prisoners eligible
for release under the court order were
either those serving sentences of 90
days or less or those prisoners already
on a public service work program.
Roughly half of the prisoners to be
released are currently serving time on
either weekend work programs or
other alternative sentencing plans.
The North County Jail, which is less
than a mile from the Stanford campus,
released three prisoners yesterday.
The individuals released were not vio
lent offenders, Sgt. Paul Prickett said

in a telephone interview from the jail.
Prickett said the released prisoners
were serving time for a variety of
crimes, including forgery, theft and
possession of controlled substances, as
well as assorted lesser crimes.
While the released prisoners are not
considered violent, both Herrington
and Prickett expressed concern that a
dangerous precedent was being set by
the county's inability to impose the
sentences dictated by its court system.
Prickett said this kind of "revolving
door" justice system, in which
criminals who have just recently been
sentenced are set free soon thereafter,
generally has negative effects on the
community and on law enforcement ef
forts.
The Santa Clara County District At
torney's Office, in accordance with the
court order, has the right to challenge
in court any of the names on the list,
but has decided not to.
