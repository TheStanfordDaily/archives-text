### Nick Anderson Staff writer 
Law Prof. Tom Campbell will
challenge first-term Congress
man Ernie Konnyu in next June s
primary election for the Republi
can nomination for U.S. repre
sentative in the 12th district,
which includes Stanford.

Campaign '88

"If the question is Am I run
ning?" the 35-year-old Campbell
said last night, "then the answer
is definitely, 'Yes, I am running."
"I believe the incumbent has
not served the district as well as
it deserves," Campbell said.
"He's vulnerable on several
counts in his record." Campbell
listed the defense budget and
foreign policy as two of Kon
nyu's weak points.
Campbell noted, however, that
he is still formally undeclared.
"Officially, as a matter of law. I
am forming an 'exploratory
committee," he said, adding that
he plans to declare his candidacy
early next year.
"Federal Election Commis
sion law is more lenient toward
undeclared candidates, who need
not file contribution reports until
January," said Campbell, who
compared his situation to that ot
presidential hopeful Sen. Bob
Dole (R-Kan.). Campbell said he
is accepting contributions now,
but that if he were to declare im
mediately, he would have to file
financial campaign reports within
10 days.
Konnyu has come under attack
since early August when two ot
his former female staffers alleged
that he sexually harassed them,
and since reports emerged alleg
ing that he had alienated the
House Republican leadership.
Campbell's bid to unseat Kon
nyu comes at the urging of local
Republican leaders. Paul "Pete*
McCloskey, a Palo Alto attorney
who represented the 12th district

from 1967 to 1982, and Tom
Ford, head of the Lincoln Club, a
Republican group of prominent
Santa Clara County business
men, have both announced their
support for Campbell. McClos
key told The Daily last week that
Konnyu "has become known as
a joke."
In support of his candidacy,
Campbell cited a poll he commis
sioned of 400 voters in the dis
trict that showed Konnyu's sup
port to be "relatively weak"
among Republican voters, and
especially low when voters were
told of some of Konnyu's alleged
controversial behavior.
"He's vulnerable,'" said
Campbell. "I'm encouraged."

The congressman, however,
was unfazed when told of an im
minent Campbell candidacy.
Konnyu stressed to reporters
Tuesday that Campbell had been
a Jimmy Carter appointee.
Campbell responded to Kon
nyu's criticism by explaining that
he was a non-partisan counsel to
Carter's chief of staff in 1980,
and that he had in fact worked in
the Reagan administration as di
rector of the Bureau of Competi
tion at the Federal Trade Com
mission from 1981 to 1983.
A professor at Stanford since
1983, Campbell earned a doc
torate in economics from the
University of Chicago in 1980
and a J.I), from Harvard in 1976.
