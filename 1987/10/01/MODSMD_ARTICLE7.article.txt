# Faculty involved in school board election
## 
### Alicia Kent Staff writer 
Citing concern about the quality of
their children's education, many Stan
ford faculty have become actively in
volved in the upcoming Palo Alto
School Board election.
Last winter, the Palo Alto Unified
School District School Board (PAUSD)
proposed that Gunn High School be
converted into a middle school, leaving
Palo Alto High Scool as the district's
only high school. The proposal has
caused much controversy, and has
generated a high level of interest in next
month's election.
Education Prof. Henry Levin is a
candidate in that election. After an
nouncing Aug. 15 his plans to run for
one of three open PAUSD School
Board positions. Levin recommended
that the board's conversion proposal be
rescinded.
If Gunn and Palo Alto High Schools
were to combine, the 1267 Gunn stu
dents and 1415 Palo Alto students
would constitute one of the largest high
school student bodies in California,
Levin said.
According to Allyn Taylor, wife of
Economics Prof. John Taylor, schools
of such size are often characterized by
a lower quality of education than is of
fered at schools with smaller enroll
ments.
"Big schools can have a directly
negative effect on children,' she said.
"We feel it will reduce the likelihood of
our children's ability to succeed if they
can't participate."

John Taylor agreed. "Most
educators feel that you can get more in
dividual attention at a smaller school,"
he said. "A lot of people I talk to are
upset and concerned (about the
merger)."
The enrollment of Stanford
connected students in the Palo Alto
School District is high, especially at
schools close to campus. At Escondido
Elementary school, SI percent of the
students are children of Stanford stu
dents from Escondido Village: at Nixon
Elementary, approximately 50 percent
of the students are children of Stanford
faculty or students.
Levin said he is finding that many
faculty members are voicing their dis
content about what they see as a threat
to the quality of their children's educa
tion. "The attention to the education
program has not been there." Levin
said. "The school board has lost a lot of
direction in the last decade."
Levin also said he is concerned that
the creation of larger schools may hurt
Stanford's ability to keep talented fac
ulty. He said he knows of at least one
faculty member v\ho is leaving Stanford
because of dissatisfaction with the Palo
Alto school system.
Levin, along with two other school
board candidates. Diane Reklis and
Terry Trumball. argues that it is not ne
cessary to close schools because of
declining enrollment and an estimated
$2.7 million deficit.
Levin said if a 5 percent utility tax is
approved in the Nov. 3 election, it may
not he necessary to combine the
schools. If the tax were to pass,
the Palo Alto School District
would receive about $3 million.
In addition. Levin said the

predicted increase in property
tax revenues that will be allotted
to the school district and the
recent increase in kindergarten
enrollment will strengthen the
school district's financial secu
rity.
" I he board has in the past got
ten carried away with closing
schools in reacting to financial

problems," said Jo Ann Cabrera,
Levin's campaign manager.
If the board decides to merge
Ciunn and Palo Alto High School,
"we will have gone from six
schools to only two," Cabrera
said. "This is a 66 percent
decrease in space, but there is
only a 50 percent decrease in stu
dents."
