Baker proposes new gold standard
WASHINGTON — Treasury Secretary James Baker 111, in
the first U.S. proposal to bring gold back into the global cur
rency system since it was abandoned in 1971, yesterday sugges
ted including the precious metal in a price index of various com
modities that would be used by the largest industrial nations to
provide "an early-warning signal" of future inflation.
Baker's unexpected disclosure, in a speech at the annual
meeting of the International Monetary Fund and World Bank,
marks a major step toward a permanent system under which the
seven leading industrial democracies would attempt to curb the
excessive currency fluctuations and price instability that have
battered iiic world economy for nearly two decades.
P*a:(ly in reaction to Baker's suggestion, gold prices dropped
about $5 an ounce in New York trading to $453.75.
British Finance Minister Nigel Lawson, while avoiding any
mention of gold, also called for establishing a joint system to
manage currency levels that would monitor commodity price
trends in an effort to avoid a resurgence of worldwide inflation.
But Baker's suggestion, while far short of a return to the gold
standard, is nonetheless certain to spark a major controversy
because many monetary officials and economic analysts have
ridiculed the idea of depending on the price of gold and other
commodities as a guide to the conduct of economic policies.
Wedtech sought lobbyists' support
WASHINGTON — The scandal-scarred Wedtech Corp. won
multimillion dollar contract extensions from the Navy in 1985
and 1986, over the objections of Navy contract officers, after
the company hired politically connected lobbyists for fees rang
ing from $150,000 to $400,000, a Senate subcommittee was told
yesterday.
Mario Moreno, a former Wedtech executive vice president
who has pleaded guilty to bribery and conspiracy charges for his
role in the bankrupt company's activities, said in an affidavit to
the subcommittee that he agreed to pay San Francisco lawyer
and consultant E. Robert Wallach $150,000 to help Wedtech get
and extend a Navy pontoon contract. Wallach was a close friend
of Attorney General Edwin Meese 111.
Moreno said he also offered a maximum fee of $400,000 in
connection with the Navy project to Mark Bragg, a partner with
former White House political director Lyn Nofziger in a public
relations firm.
"Mr. Wallach reported that he had spoken to his friend' and
kept 'his friend' informed of Wedtech's efforts to obtain the
pontoon contract," Moreno said in his sworn statement.
Moreno added that "in the context of prior conversations with
Mr. Wallach, I took his friend to mean Edwin Meese III," who
was White House counselor before he became attorney general
in early 1985.
Kremlin changes stance on PLO
NEW YORK — Israeli Foreign Minister Shimon Peres told
Secretary of State George Shultz yesterday that the Soviet Un
ion has signaled its readiness to stop insisting that the Palestine
Liberation Organization must represent the Palestinian people
in any new Middle East peace talks.
Sources familiar with their meeting quoted Peres as saying he
had been given that impression by Soviet Foreign Minister
Eduard Shevardnadze when they met here last week. The three
ministers were here for the opening of the United Nations Gen
eral Assembly session.
Also at yesterday's meeting, the sources said, Shultz ex
pressed the Reagan administration's displeasure over the Israeli
government's criticism of a planned $1 billion U.S. arms sale to
Saudi Arabia.
Shultz reportedly described the sale as an important element
of U.S. efforts to keep the confidence of the Persian Gulf states
and suggested that Israel, if it feels unable to support the sale,
should at least mute its criticism. Neither Peres nor U.S. offi
cials would discuss details of yesterday's talks. But the sources
said the major emphasis was on the Mideast peace process and
Peres' perception of a more flexible Soviet attitude on whether
the PLO would have a role in it.
Plane crash kills six passengers
SAN DIEGO — A small chartered airplane attempting to land
at the airport in Tijuana, Mexico, in heavy fog early yesterday
crashed into a hillside near the U.S.-Mexico border, killing all
six people on board.
Officials said the dead included the pilot, a Mexican national;
two American technicians who worked for a San Francisco Bay
Area company; and three Japanese officials of Exportadora de
Sal, a Mexico-based company owned by Mexican and Japanese
interests that exports salt from Baja California, mostly to Japan.
The men were returning from a business trip to a salt mine at
Guerrero Negro, on the Baja pennisula about 320 miles south of
the border, authorities said.
After arriving in Tijuana, the men were apparently going to
the salt company's purchasing office in San Diego, and, after
wards, were expected to catch flights from San Diego to their
homes, said a company official.
Investigators from the Federal Aviation Administration and
the National Transportation Safety Board were combing
through the wreckage seeking clues for the cause of the crash,
but as of yesterday afternoon there was no official word about
what went awry.
Committee closes Bork hearings
WASHINGTON — With major questions still unresolved
despite three weeks of testimony, the Senate Judiciary Commit
tee completed its hearings on Supreme Court nominee Robert
Bork yesterday, as President Reagan, speaking to a group of
supporters, predicted that "common sense will prevail" to
ensure Bork's confirmation.
The hearings ended soon after Committee Chairman Joseph
Biden Jr. (D-Del.) read a letter from former President Carter
declaring his opposition to Bork, saying that "as a southerner
who has observed personally the long and difficult years of the
struggle for civil rights," he found Bork's opinions on those is
sues "particularly obnoxious."
Action on the nomination now shifts to the full Senate, where
questions about how Bork might rule on civil rights protections,
as well as on cases involving personal privacy, free speech and
equal protection of the laws, are expected to dominate the
debate.
With the committee's adjournment, Bork's supporters and
opponents began frantically manuevering for advantage.
Leading Democratic opponents, feeling that momentum is on
their side, began pushing for an early October vote on the nomi
nation. Bork supporters, who once hoped to have Bork con
firmed in time to join the court for its October session, now were
talking of a vote sometime in November, hoping to give the
Reagan's newly intensified pro-Bork lobbying campaign time to
have the maximum effect.

about $5 an ounce in New York trading to $453.75.
British Finance Minister Nigel Lawson, while avoiding any

trends in an effort to avoid a resurgence of worldwide inflation.
But Baker's suggestion, while far short of a return to the gold
standard, is nonetheless certain to spark a major controversy
because many monetary officials and economic analysts have
ridiculed the idea of depending on the price of gold and other
commodities as a guide to the conduct of economic policies.
Wedtech sought lobbyists' support
WASHINGTON — The scandal-scarred Wedtech Corp. won
multimillion dollar contract extensions from the Navy in 1985
and 1986, over the objections of Navy contract officers, after
the company hired politically connected lobbyists for fees rang
ing from $150,000 to $400,000, a Senate subcommittee was told
yesterday.
Mario Moreno, a former Wedtech executive vice president
who has pleaded guilty to bribery and conspiracy charges for his
role in the bankrupt company's activities, said in an affidavit to
the subcommittee that he agreed to pay San Francisco lawyer
and consultant E. Robert Wallach $150,000 to help Wedtech get
and extend a Navy pontoon contract. Wallach was a close friend
of Attorney General Edwin Meese 111.
Moreno said he also offered a maximum fee of $400,000 in
connection with the Navy project to Mark Bragg, a partner with
former White House political director Lyn Nofziger in a public
relations firm.
"Mr. Wallach reported that he had spoken to his friend' and
kept 'his friend' informed of Wedtech's efforts to obtain the
pontoon contract," Moreno said in his sworn statement.
Moreno added that "in the context of prior conversations with
Mr. Wallach, I took his friend to mean Edwin Meese III," who
was White House counselor before he became attorney general
in early 1985.
Kremlin changes stance on PLO
NEW YORK — Israeli Foreign Minister Shimon Peres told
Secretary of State George Shultz yesterday that the Soviet Un
ion has signaled its readiness to stop insisting that the Palestine
Liberation Organization must represent the Palestinian people
in any new Middle East peace talks.
Sources familiar with their meeting quoted Peres as saying he
had been given that impression by Soviet Foreign Minister
Eduard Shevardnadze when they met here last week. The three
ministers were here for the opening of the United Nations Gen
eral Assembly session.
Also at yesterday's meeting, the sources said, Shultz ex
pressed the Reagan administration's displeasure over the Israeli
government's criticism of a planned $1 billion U.S. arms sale to
Saudi Arabia.
Shultz reportedly described the sale as an important element
of U.S. efforts to keep the confidence of the Persian Gulf states
and suggested that Israel, if it feels unable to support the sale,
should at least mute its criticism. Neither Peres nor U.S. offi
cials would discuss details of yesterday's talks. But the sources
said the major emphasis was on the Mideast peace process and
Peres' perception of a more flexible Soviet attitude on whether
the PLO would have a role in it.
Plane crash kills six passengers
SAN DIEGO — A small chartered airplane attempting to land
at the airport in Tijuana, Mexico, in heavy fog early yesterday
crashed into a hillside near the U.S.-Mexico border, killing all
six people on board.
Officials said the dead included the pilot, a Mexican national;
two American technicians who worked for a San Francisco Bay
Area company; and three Japanese officials of Exportadora de
Sal, a Mexico-based company owned by Mexican and Japanese
interests that exports salt from Baja California, mostly to Japan.
The men were returning from a business trip to a salt mine at
Guerrero Negro, on the Baja pennisula about 320 miles south of
the border, authorities said.
After arriving in Tijuana, the men were apparently going to
the salt company's purchasing office in San Diego, and, after
wards, were expected to catch flights from San Diego to their
homes, said a company official.
Investigators from the Federal Aviation Administration and
the National Transportation Safety Board were combing
through the wreckage seeking clues for the cause of the crash,
but as of yesterday afternoon there was no official word about
what went awry.
Committee closes Bork hearings
WASHINGTON — With major questions still unresolved
despite three weeks of testimony, the Senate Judiciary Commit
tee completed its hearings on Supreme Court nominee Robert
Bork yesterday, as President Reagan, speaking to a group of
supporters, predicted that "common sense will prevail" to
ensure Bork's confirmation.
The hearings ended soon after Committee Chairman Joseph
Biden Jr. (D-Del.) read a letter from former President Carter
declaring his opposition to Bork, saying that "as a southerner
who has observed personally the long and difficult years of the
struggle for civil rights," he found Bork's opinions on those is
sues "particularly obnoxious."
Action on the nomination now shifts to the full Senate, where
questions about how Bork might rule on civil rights protections,
as well as on cases involving personal privacy, free speech and
equal protection of the laws, are expected to dominate the
debate.
With the committee's adjournment, Bork's supporters and
opponents began frantically manuevering for advantage.
Leading Democratic opponents, feeling that momentum is on
their side, began pushing for an early October vote on the nomi
nation. Bork supporters, who once hoped to have Bork con
firmed in time to join the court for its October session, now were
talking of a vote sometime in November, hoping to give the
Reagan's newly intensified pro-Bork lobbying campaign time to
have the maximum effect.

Baker proposes new gold standard
WASHINGTON — Treasury Secretary James Baker 111, in
the first U.S. proposal to bring gold back into the global cur

modities that would be used by the largest industrial nations to
provide "an early-warning signal" of future inflation.

seven leading industrial democracies would attempt to curb the
