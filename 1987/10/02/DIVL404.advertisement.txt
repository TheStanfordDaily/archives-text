Notice to the Stanford Community
about Delta Upsilon Fraternity
Bccause of Intolerable behavior and failure to uphold the
principles of Delta Upsilon Fraternity, the charter of the Stanford
Chapter of IX-lta Upsilon was suspended last February.
It has come to our attention th.it some former members of the
former DU chapter apparently believe nothing has changed. They
are sorely mistaken.
We would like the Stanford University community to know
that these men do not represent Delta Upsilon. They have no right
to refer to themselves as DU, nor to pledge or Initiate men. nor
conduct any activities in the name of Delta Upsilon.
If these former members of our former chapter wish to
continue friendships among themselves, neither we nor the Unl
verstty can prevent this. However, they and all Stanford students,
faculty and staff should know that they alone are responsible for
their conduct. They do not represent Delta Upsilon.
We apologize to Stanford University for any Irresponsible be
havlor which occurred when our chapter was In operation. We
hope that the men who were formerly members of our chapter will
realize the detrimental effect their behavior has on the University
and themselves.
As a chapter wltii 90 successful years, and as an Interna
tional Fraternity, Delta Upsilon plans to be a productive member
of the Stanford community. Toward the revival of DU, we pledge
ourselves to full and complete cooperation with Stanford Unlver
slty. We want no repeat of values and attitudes which resulted In
our suspension of our Stanford Chapter's charter. We hope to one
day find men who appreciate both the privilege of attending
Stanford and membership In Delta Upsilon.
