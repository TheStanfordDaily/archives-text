# Environmental group delays bio building
## 
### Erik Sten Senior staff writer 
Spurred by a local protest group, Stanford has
decided to file an enviromental impact report (KIR)
on a proposed addition to the Biology Building,
delaying construction of the controversial
structure.
The University's action follows a decision by the
Santa Clara County Planning Commission to
postpone until November a hearing on whether the
University would have to commission the report.
Protesters have criticized the proposed addition as
potentially dangerous.
Biology Department Chairman Philip Hanawalt
said Stanford chose to go ahead with the report to
avoid possible future delays. He said even if the
planning commission decides in Stanford's favor,
the protesters could appeal. The report will cost in
excess of $1()0,(KH).
At the hearing yesterday, the county commis
sioners voted 3 to 2 to postpone their decision for
another month in order to allow Stanford time to
collect more data. "The planning commission
wasn't quite ready to make a decision." according
to Jaunell Waldo, an associate planner for the
county.
"They need more information on the monitoring
of the exhaust emissions," she said.
On Aug. 13, the county Board of Supervisors ap
proved the construction based on a staff report that
claimed the emissions would have little impact on
the environment. During the ensuing 15 days given
for appeals, however, a letter of protest sent to the
planning commission by the Silicon Valley Toxics
Coalition forced a hearing to check the report.
The coalition also objected to some of the re
search that will be done in the proposed facility.
That research will involve gene-splicing experi
ments, known as recombinant DNA, which the co
alition said may endanger public health.
The planning commission did not, however, ad
dress the issue of ongoing DNA research at Stan
ford, which is currently being conducted in the
existing Hen in Laboratories.
According to Hanawalt, an EIR was not done in
the first place "because one had not been required
in the past." Hanawalt said the plans for the build
ing comply with existing University guidelines
which have in past projects satisified the county.
"In retrospect, had we just done it (an FIR) in
the first place, there probably wouldn't have been
any problem," Hanawalt said.
Hanawalt said the protesters are not properly in
formed on recombinant DNA research.
He said it has been difficult to explain the depart
ment's research to the coalition. "We're dealing
with people who are basically distrustful of sci
ence," Hanawalt said.
According to Hanawalt, recombinant DNA work
is basically a tool used in different projects and not
a way of "creating new monster organisms that are
