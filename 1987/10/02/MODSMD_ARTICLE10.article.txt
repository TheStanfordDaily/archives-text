## Quake rocks Los Angeles 
### 
LOS ANGELES — A major earthquake
rocked the Los Angeles metropolitan area at
7:42 a.m. yesterday, killing at least three
people, injuring scores of others, severely
damaging dozens of buildings and forcing the
closure of two freeways.
Seismologists at the California Institute of
Technology in Pasadena said the quake mea
sured 6.1 on the Richter Scale — con
siderably less than the devastating Sylmar
quake that hit Los Angeles in 1971, killing
more than 60 people — and was centered in
south Rosemead, about 10 miles east of
downtown Los Angeles.
Yesterday's quake — the third largest to
hit the area in the last 50 years — was felt as
far away as San Diego, San Luis Obispo and
even Las Vegas, Nev., more than 200 miles to
the northeast. Scientists said it was not the
"big quake" forecast for Southern California
sometime in the next 30 years.
Walls crumbled, windows shattered,
ceilings collapsed and at least 100 fires broke
out in scattered locations throughout the
metropolitan area. Telephone, radio and tele
vision systems were momentarily knocked
out of service by the quake and there were
numerous reports of gas and water leaks.
Some of the worst damage was in Whittier,
one of the suburban towns closest to the
epicenter. Sixty persons were treated at
Whittier Presbyterian Hospital for injuries
and about KKK) people were evacuated from
homes and businesses. About 150 people fled
to a Red Cross shelter in the local community
center; about SO were still there by mid
afternoon.
Power to nearly 500,000 customers in Los
Angeles metropolitan area was knocked out
by the quake, with blockouts lasting from a
few minutes to several hours. Outages
trapped office workers in more than 20 stalled
elevators and thousands of employees were
evacuated from downtown office structures.

Power outages in the downtown area con
tributed to surface street tie-ups when traffic
lights blinked out.
Police officers, placed on an alert that kept
morning watch officers on duty into the after
noon to assure adequate manpower, said they
arrested five people looting stores with bro
ken windows in the downtown area.
Damage to the control tower at
Hollywood-Burbank Airport forced closure
of the airfield for 35 minutes while controllers
switched operations to a backup facility, ac
cording to the Federal Aviation Administra
tion. Los Angeles International Airport was
closed for three minutes while FAA inspec
tors made sure there was no runway damage.
City fire officials said Lupe Esposito, 23, of
San Gabriel was killed when the wall of a
parking garage fell on her at the CalState-Los
Angeles campus.
A construction worker, Antonia Bernal,
41, of Hemet, Calif., was killed when he was
buried under seven feet of earth during a
landslide in a tunnel being dug in the Eaton
Canyon area above Pasadena, according to
the Pasadena Fire Department.
Another man sustained fatal head injuries
when he reportedly fell out of a second-floor
window in Maywood when the quake rocked
the building. He was identified as Juan Her
rera, 32.
At least four people suffered fatal heart at
tacks in the moments during and after the
quake.
In all, more than 1(H) people were treated
for quake-related injuries.
An emergency room spokesman at the Los
Angeles County-UCLA Medical Center said
the room was swamped with earthquake inju
ries. "We've had every kind of injury that
can come in, and we're extremely busy with
all kinds of problems from very bad to
minor," he said.
One man was injured when a 3 foot by 4

foot boulder rolled down a steep hillside,
crushing a car on a freeway transition road
near downtown.
Another man, a construction worker at Los
Angeles International Airport, sustained
burns when he grabbed a powerline to steady
himself as his ladder began to sway.
The quake forced the closure of the Inter
state 5 and Interstate 605 freeways in the
Santa Fe Springs area at the height of the
morning rush hour after chunks of concrete
tumbled onto the roadway, and California
Department of Transportation engineers
noted major cracks in the 1-605 overpass.
Landslides forced the Los Angeles County
Sheriffs Department to close roads in the
San Gabriel Mountains. "There's a lot of
damage, large boulders and slides," Deputy
Ron Marquez of the Crescenta Valley substa
tion said.
A staff seismologist at Cal Tech, Kate Hut
ton, said that the quake, which was the
strongest in the Los Angeles area since the
Sylmar earthquake in 1971, appeared to oc
cur along the Whittier Fault, a massive sub
terranean crack in the earth that has been the
source of a number of relatively minor
tremors over the years.
She said tracking equipment recorded doz
ens of aftershocks yesterday morning, but
none approached the 6.1 magnitude of the
main quake.
One aftershock measuring 4.4 was regis
tered at 7:45 a.m., followed by another 4.4 at
8:12 a.m. By midafternoon, there had been at
least a dozen more between 3.0 and 3.5
The Richter scale is a measure of ground
motion as recorded on seismographs. Every
increase by one number means a 10-fold in
crease in magnitude. An earthquake of 5 on
the Richter scale can cause considerable
damage, while one measuring 6 can cause se
vere damage.

LOS ANGELES — A major earthquake
rocked the Los Angeles metropolitan area at
7:42 a.m. yesterday, killing at least three
people, injuring scores of others, severely
damaging dozens of buildings and forcing the
closure of two freeways.
Seismologists at the California Institute of
Technology in Pasadena said the quake mea
sured 6.1 on the Richter Scale — con
siderably less than the devastating Sylmar
quake that hit Los Angeles in 1971, killing
more than 60 people — and was centered in
south Rosemead, about 10 miles east of
downtown Los Angeles.
Yesterday's quake — the third largest to
hit the area in the last 50 years — was felt as
far away as San Diego, San Luis Obispo and
even Las Vegas, Nev., more than 200 miles to
the northeast. Scientists said it was not the
"big quake" forecast for Southern California
sometime in the next 30 years.
Walls crumbled, windows shattered,
ceilings collapsed and at least 100 fires broke
out in scattered locations throughout the
metropolitan area. Telephone, radio and tele
vision systems were momentarily knocked
out of service by the quake and there were
numerous reports of gas and water leaks.
Some of the worst damage was in Whittier,
one of the suburban towns closest to the
epicenter. Sixty persons were treated at
Whittier Presbyterian Hospital for injuries
and about KKK) people were evacuated from
homes and businesses. About 150 people fled
to a Red Cross shelter in the local community
center; about SO were still there by mid
afternoon.
Power to nearly 500,000 customers in Los
Angeles metropolitan area was knocked out
by the quake, with blockouts lasting from a
few minutes to several hours. Outages
trapped office workers in more than 20 stalled
elevators and thousands of employees were
evacuated from downtown office structures.

Power outages in the downtown area con
tributed to surface street tie-ups when traffic
lights blinked out.
Police officers, placed on an alert that kept
morning watch officers on duty into the after
noon to assure adequate manpower, said they
arrested five people looting stores with bro
ken windows in the downtown area.
Damage to the control tower at
Hollywood-Burbank Airport forced closure
of the airfield for 35 minutes while controllers
switched operations to a backup facility, ac
cording to the Federal Aviation Administra
tion. Los Angeles International Airport was
closed for three minutes while FAA inspec
tors made sure there was no runway damage.
City fire officials said Lupe Esposito, 23, of
San Gabriel was killed when the wall of a
parking garage fell on her at the CalState-Los
Angeles campus.
A construction worker, Antonia Bernal,
41, of Hemet, Calif., was killed when he was
buried under seven feet of earth during a
landslide in a tunnel being dug in the Eaton
Canyon area above Pasadena, according to
the Pasadena Fire Department.
Another man sustained fatal head injuries
when he reportedly fell out of a second-floor
window in Maywood when the quake rocked
the building. He was identified as Juan Her
rera, 32.
At least four people suffered fatal heart at
tacks in the moments during and after the
quake.
In all, more than 1(H) people were treated
for quake-related injuries.
An emergency room spokesman at the Los
Angeles County-UCLA Medical Center said
the room was swamped with earthquake inju
ries. "We've had every kind of injury that
can come in, and we're extremely busy with
all kinds of problems from very bad to
minor," he said.
One man was injured when a 3 foot by 4

foot boulder rolled down a steep hillside,
crushing a car on a freeway transition road
near downtown.
Another man, a construction worker at Los
Angeles International Airport, sustained
burns when he grabbed a powerline to steady
himself as his ladder began to sway.
The quake forced the closure of the Inter
state 5 and Interstate 605 freeways in the
Santa Fe Springs area at the height of the
morning rush hour after chunks of concrete
tumbled onto the roadway, and California
Department of Transportation engineers
noted major cracks in the 1-605 overpass.
Landslides forced the Los Angeles County
Sheriffs Department to close roads in the
San Gabriel Mountains. "There's a lot of
damage, large boulders and slides," Deputy
Ron Marquez of the Crescenta Valley substa
tion said.
A staff seismologist at Cal Tech, Kate Hut
ton, said that the quake, which was the
strongest in the Los Angeles area since the
Sylmar earthquake in 1971, appeared to oc
cur along the Whittier Fault, a massive sub
terranean crack in the earth that has been the
source of a number of relatively minor
tremors over the years.
She said tracking equipment recorded doz
ens of aftershocks yesterday morning, but
none approached the 6.1 magnitude of the
main quake.
One aftershock measuring 4.4 was regis
tered at 7:45 a.m., followed by another 4.4 at
