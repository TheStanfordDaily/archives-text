Stanford University professors are being
featured in"The Health Century," a four-part
PBS documentary on health issues that will con
clude Oct. 4.
PBS interviewed Stanley Falkow, professor of
medical microbiology; Norman Shumway, pro
fessor and chairman of the Department of Car
diovascular Surgery; Robert Sapolsky, assistant
professor of biological sciences; and Bio
chemistry Prof. Paul Berg, a 1980 Nobel laureate
in chemistry.
According to a PBS news release, the series
highlights the major achievements in bio
medicine and traces the history of bacteriology,
as well as the changing attitudes toward infec
tious diseases in its attempt to "help all
Americans better understand the research pro
cess and the technologies being used to unravel
the mysteries of disease."
The series celebrates the centennial of the Na
tional Institutes of Health (NIH) and coincides
with the 100 th anniversary of the founding of the
Pasteur Institute.
Part one, which aired Sept. 27, focused on the
war on polio and on the developments in com
batting infectious diseases such as yellow fever,
whooping cough, pneumonia and AIDS.
Falkow, who was featured in this segment, de
scribed the evolution of theories on bacteriologi
cal development. He said past mistaken concep
tions of spontaneous generation and the evils of
deity have been replaced by the present under
standing of pathological bacteria in causing
disease.
According to Falkow, current research
centers around the AIDS virus. He added that
other such infectious diseases are slowly being
controlled. He said, however, that despite the
knowledge of the basic biology of the immune

system, public opinion is still overly dependent
on antibiotics in curing disease, and the next
century should place greater emphasis on
disease prevention.
In the second segment, which analyzed heart
disease, diabetes and brain disorders, Shumway,
a heart transplant pioneer, discussed cardiovas
cular surgery.
Focusing on the effect of surgical advances
and efforts in cell biology on the health of
Americans, segment three will feature Shumway
and Sapolsky.
Berg, as a part of the last segment, will relate
the early development of biotechnology, focus
ing on the advancements and the public policy
issues over genetic recombination in the early
19705.
Molecular genetics have had practical applica
tions, according to Berg. He said they are
revolutionizing agriculture and effecting an
"enormous impact on medicine and chemistry.
Berg cited the example of improved food pro
duction as evidence of this revolution.
The last segment, airing this Sunday, will ex
amine the role recombinant DNA research will
play as a catalyst to medical technology in the
future.
The series featured professors from around
the nation, including professors from the Mas
saehussetts Institute of Technology and Harvard
and Johns Hopkins Universities.
The NIH began as a lab in the attic of the
Marine Health Service Hospital in Straten Is
land, N.Y., where research took place in the
then-infantile stages of biotechnology.
Over the last 1 (K) years, the NIH has grown
into one of the world's largest biomedical institu
tions. The organization supports 20,000 scien
tists in 1300 universities, medical schools and
hospitals in the United States and abroad.
