# Agenda optimistic about Western Culture changes

### Patsy Mickens 
The Rainbow Agenda, a coali
tion of campus minority groups
seeking to improve the quality of
minority life at Stanford, is
focusing its energy this quarter
on the restructuring of the West
ern Culture program, according
to Black Student Union Chair
Bill King, a member of the
Agenda.
Besides revamping Western
Culture, the Rainbow Agenda's
other priorities will include the
examination of financial aid for
minorities. University recruit
ment of minority faculty and stu
dents, and affirmative action for
University staff. King said.
According to King, the West
ern Culture debate is a vital issue
that "will set the tone for the
next couple of years in terms of
minority relations to the Univer
sity."
Central to the debate is the
Area One Task Force, which was
set up last year to study the Uni
versity's Western Culture re
quirement. The task force was to
investigate ways of incorporating
more fully the works of women
and minorities in Western Cul
ture courses. The task force is
now finishing its final proposal,
which will eventually be submit
ted to the Committee on Under
graduate Studies (CUS) and
brought before the Faculty Sen
ate for a vote.
King said he hopes the senate

will "follow the spirit" of the
task force s recommendations,
which he said had a 60 percent
chance of passing.
The Agenda is pushing for the
vote on the Western Culture pro
posal to take place on or before
December 3.
Critics of the movement to
revise Western Culture argue
that by requiring additional
works to be studied in Western
Culture classes, students will be
unable to study any given work
in depth.
In response to this argument,
King said a more balanced selec
tion of readings, one that in
cluded works by women and
minorities, would still allow stu
dents to study particular works in
depth if they prioritized their
studies.
According to King, the Rain
bow Agenda hopes to eliminate
misconceptions about the pro
posed changes and set up
dialogue with students who have
reservations about them.
Last spring, the Rainbow
Agenda expressed its dissatisfac
tion with the University's hand
ling of minority issues by protest
ing at the Centennial celebration
in the Quad.
At that time, the Agenda pre
sented a list of demands to the
University, which included the
following:
• The establishment of a vice
provost to oversee minority af
fairs;

• The creation of a budget for
minority admissions and a sum
mer tutoring program for incom
ing freshmen;
• A new location for the Asian-
American activities center and
the creation of an Asian-
American assistant deanship;
• Administration support of the
proposed Western Culture
changes;
• The appointment of an outside
commission to study racism and
the state of minority life at Stan
ford; and
• Total divestment by the Uni
versity of Stanford stock in com
panies that do business in South
Africa.
Since that time, the Asian
American Student Association
has been given a new office in the
Old Union Clubhouse and as
signed a new assistant dean. A
commission on the state of
minority life at Stanford will also
be established.
The ASSU Senate voted Wed
nesday to give the ethnic
minority groups on campus the
power to nominate their own rep
resentatives to the University's
Commission on Minority Life.
The senate also voted to propose
that the University change the
title of the commission to reflect
the commission's specific focus
on ethnic minority life. The com
mission will study the state of
both overt and subtle racism at
Stanford.
