## The 						Stanford Daily An Independent Newspaper Improve athletic access 
### 
Yesterday morning the quarterly event known
as intramural signups took place at the Encina
Gym courtyard. The fact that students will
voluntarily wait in line for hours to sign up their
teams is not only noteworthy (considering the
typical complaining that accompanies waiting in
the lengthy lines at Old Union or the Bookstore),
but it also indicates the importance of athletic
participation to a significant portion of the Stan
ford student body. Indeed, the athletic spirit
continues to be in evidence throughout the Stan
ford campus.
Unfortunately, although the spirit is willing,
the facilities at Stanford in many cases are sub
standard, inaccessible or altogether lacking.
The neglect has been particularly visible in
terms of facilites for four of the major recrea
tional sports: tennis, basketball, swimming and
weightlifting.
Lack of accessibility, more than a lack of
courts, is the problem for people wishing to play
tennis. Between the varsity teams and the tennis
classes, a majority of the courts are taken during
the day. This would not be so problematic, ex
cept for the fact that none of the tennis court
complexes has lights. In an informal meeting
with The Daily last spring. University President
Donald Kennedy said lighted tennis courts were
a necessity so that students who could not get on
the courts or had other commitments during the
day could play at night. He said installation of
lights was high on the University's agenda. So
far, there has been no improvement.
Basketball facilities, on the one hand, have
not been available and, on the other hand, are
not well maintained. Access to indoor courts is
very limited. Maples Pavilion is used almost en
tirely by varsity athletes, and Roble Gym has
just one court and is often reserved for other
sports. Outdoor courts are in plentiful supply
around campus, but most are weather-beaten
(with cracks in the cement, bent rims and torn
nets) and not repaired on a regular basis.

Roble Fool has suffered much the same fate as
the outdoor basketball courts. It has been char
acterized by recurring maintenance problems —
"It's a very, very old pool," Club Sports and
Recreation Director Shirley Schoof said — as
typified by the current plumbing problem which
has forced its shutdown until at least Oct. 12. In
addition, the pool is closed during winter quarter
in order to save heating costs. During the week,
deGuerre Pool is only open to students from
noon to 2 p.m. and from 5:30 p.m. to 7 p.m. Part
of the money being raised by the Centennial
Campaign has been allocated for the building of
a new pool complex on Campus Drive West, but
that project will not be completed for at least 10
years.
There is one adequate weight room on
campus, but it is restricted to varsity athletes.
The Encina weight room, where most students
go, is overcrowded and has aging equipment.
The disparity in weight rooms is indicative of the
general difference between varsity and non
varsity facilities. This is not to say that varsity
facilities should not have top-of-the-line equip
ment and be well-maintained. Rather, it is to say
that students, be they athletes or not, are enti
tled to the same considerations with regard to
athletic facilities that varsity athletes get.
Yesterday's opening of the eight-court tennis
complex across the street from Governor's Cor
ner hopefully signals that the University has
made improvement of facilities a priority. If it
has, then it is important that the renovation of
the Encina Gym complex, which is part of the
Centennial Campaign agenda, be completed
within the next year or so, as planned.
Physical activity, along with intellectual and
social activity, should be part of the college ex
perience. The University does its best to provide
students with a quality intellectual and social en
vironment in which to prosper academically and
socially; it should do likewise with regard to ath
letic facilities.

the outdoor basketball courts. It has been char
acterized by recurring maintenance problems —
"It's a very, very old pool," Club Sports and
Recreation Director Shirley Schoof said — as
typified by the current plumbing problem which
has forced its shutdown until at least Oct. 12. In
addition, the pool is closed during winter quarter
in order to save heating costs. During the week,
deGuerre Pool is only open to students from
noon to 2 p.m. and from 5:30 p.m. to 7 p.m. Part
of the money being raised by the Centennial
Campaign has been allocated for the building of
a new pool complex on Campus Drive West, but
that project will not be completed for at least 10
years.
There is one adequate weight room on
campus, but it is restricted to varsity athletes.
The Encina weight room, where most students
go, is overcrowded and has aging equipment.
The disparity in weight rooms is indicative of the
general difference between varsity and non
varsity facilities. This is not to say that varsity
facilities should not have top-of-the-line equip
ment and be well-maintained. Rather, it is to say
that students, be they athletes or not, are enti
tled to the same considerations with regard to
athletic facilities that varsity athletes get.
Yesterday's opening of the eight-court tennis
complex across the street from Governor's Cor
ner hopefully signals that the University has
made improvement of facilities a priority. If it
has, then it is important that the renovation of
the Encina Gym complex, which is part of the
Centennial Campaign agenda, be completed
within the next year or so, as planned.
Physical activity, along with intellectual and
social activity, should be part of the college ex
perience. The University does its best to provide
students with a quality intellectual and social en
vironment in which to prosper academically and
socially; it should do likewise with regard to ath
letic facilities.
