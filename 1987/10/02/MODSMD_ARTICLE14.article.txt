Elusive sign-ups
unfair to students
We are paying a hefty sum of
money to get a quality education
here at Stanford and Clint Smith,
who teaches a class in the Latin
American Studies Department, is
playing a game.
Smith is teaching a seminar
this autumn in U.S.-Mexico rela
tions, but he wants to limit the
size of the class to fifteen. How
will he do it?
Smith's plan is simple. Don't
put the appropriate marking in
the Time Schedule to tell stu
dents they must sign a class list.
Simply hide out and leave a sign
up sheet and a short application
to be filled out at the Latin Amer
ican Studies office. Then further
screen out interested students by
putting the wrong room number
an the time schedule.
; The plan is beautiful and
sinister, inspired yet evil. When
Tnisguided students pick up the
scent and find the correct class
room at the Center for Latin
American Studies in the Bolivar
|House, the introductory session
is half over and twenty intruding
Nvant-to-be's are made to feel
•rude for interrupting. No rebut

tals or complaints will be heard
during class time.
The conflict is between a group
of highly motivated students en
thusiastic about our country's re
lationship with its most impor
tant neighbor and with a profes
sor who denies those students
their right to learn.
A constructive solution: in
form students through the Time
Schedule that they must sign a
class list; clearly communicate to
students the necessary qualifica
tions to participate in a class with
limited enrollment; let the com
petition begin with integrity!
My intent is not to be dis
respectful or to vent my frustra
tion irresponsibly. I feel strongly
about this. I and twenty other eli
gible candidates for Smith's class
were manipulated and ultimately
cheated.
Perhaps Smith has been study
ing Mexico too long. Perhaps he
has forgotten that in the United
States — even in a private insti
tution — citizens are accustomed
to having a voice and to getting
what they deserve.

Race on campus
Sunday morning
You can expect to see the
streets busier than they've been
all year on Sunday.
The Ninth Annual Great Race
is scheduled to start at 8:30 a.m.
and will use parts of Campus
Drive and Junipero Serra Boul
evard until about 9:30 a.m.
At the moment, runners from
all over the Peninsula will hit the
pavement in their first steps of
many on the 10-kilometer (6.21
mile) course.
The Great Race follows
Campus Drive, part of Mayfield
Avenue, Junipero Serra Boul
evard and ends with an Olympic
style finish in the Stanford
Stadium.
If you like to sleep late, you
have nothing to fear: the runners
will be out and off Campus Drive
before you've had your second
thought of pulling off those warm
blankets. Otherwise you'd better
prepare for the sound of
thousands of pounding feet be
hind your back.
