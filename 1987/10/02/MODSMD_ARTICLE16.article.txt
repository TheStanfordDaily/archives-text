## Vietnam lessons ignored 
### 
In a Sept. 30 article titled "TV redefines Vietnam
War," a Daily article criticized the IV networks for
their unrealistic portrayal of the Vietnam War in the
upcoming series, "Tour of Duty."
The reporter claimed the topic was "too impor
tant and too volatile to be trapped within the limit
ing, censor-conscious confines of network televi
sion." A more accurate portrayal, the reporter con
tended, would depict the war "in all its blood-and
guts, drug-laden, profanity-inundated glory."

This touches a sensitive nerve in me, because
I've long been frustrated and irritated by the way in
which the Vietnam War has been portrayed in the
popular media and in the recent spate of action
movies.
The most important lessons we can learn from
that war have far more to do with the appropriate
conduct of United States foreign policy than with
the horrors of war. God knows that the Vietnam
War was a terrifying experience for those who had
to fight it, but the trenches of World War I were no
picnic, either.
In fact, I'm sure that comparably gruesome
movies could be made about practically every war
that was ever (or will be) fought. However, if we
are to avoid such senseless wars in the future, we
must learn about more than simply the physical and
psychological misery of the Vietnam War.
We have to realize that our principal motivation
behind the war — to stop the spread of communism
— was based more on myth and misinformation
than on fact. We have to realize that the Vietnam
War was essentially a nationalistic struggle for in
dependence on the part of the Vietnamese people,
not simply an attempt by the Chinese or the Soviets
to spread communism throughout Southeast Asia
en route to the rest of the world.
The Vietnamese were tired of having to serve
colonial powers — whether they were the
Japanese, the French or the Americans — and they

were willing to give their lives to regain control
over their own country. The popular notion that we
"lost" the war because Congress refused to vote
enough money for us to win it completely ignores
the sheer tenacity of the Vietnamese, which was
driven by this nationalistic fervor, and which virtu
ally guaranteed that we would never "win."
Transforming even more of Vietnam into a
poisoned moonscape could never have destroyed
the resolve of the Vietnamese to rid their country of
foreign influence. To paraphrase the famous words
of one brilliant American general, we would have
had to completely destroy Vietnam in order to save
it- # umAtc 1 • «<
I hus, a FV series or movie that teaches us what
we really need to know about the Vietnam War
doesn't have to resort to gory battle scenes or foul
language, but it would have to deal with a subject
which would draw far more heated public opposi
tion — the Vietnamese perspective on the war.
A more courageous depiction of the war might,
for example, tell the story of a Vietnamese family
living south of the 17th parallel during the mid
-19505. (Incidentally, North and South Vietnam,
contrary to popular belief, didn't exist prior to the
agreement at the Geneva Conference of 1954.)
Stealing a plot idea from a Civil War story, such a
film might portray the conflict arising in the family
as one son decides to fight with the Viet Minh
against the French and the Americans, while an
other son decides to try to gain power within the
Western-supported regime in Saigon.
I do not purport to be an expert on the history of
the United States' involvement in Vietnam. In fact,
what is so alarming to me is the persistence of the
mythology about the need to "contain commu
nism" in Vietnam, despite the widespread availabil
ity of information debunking this oversimplification
of our role in the Vietnam War (e.g., Frances
Fitzgerald's book, "Fire in the Lake").
One need only look at the similarities between
our support for the Saigon regime during the 1950s
and 1960s and our current support for the contras in
Nicaragua to see that the myths about Vietnam are
alive and well in 1987.
