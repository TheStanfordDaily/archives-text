# New art studios planned
## Construction in Foothills could spark controversy 
### Tracy Brune 
C onstruction of new art studios may begin near
the Dish in the Stanford foothills this fall if the
University Board of Trustees approves of the plan
in its meeting this Tuesday.
Campus Planner Tom Richman said he is confi
dent the plan will pass.
I he $5(K),()(H) project will include two studios and
a common work area, totaling 50(H) square feet. Art
Profs. Nathan Oliveira and Greg Lynch, along with
several other faculty members and graduate stu
dents, will be the first to occupy the facility. The
studio will not be available to undergraduates.
Construction in the Foothills was the subject of

heated campus debate last year when the contro
versial Reagan Library was slated to be built in the
hills above Junipero Serra Boulevard.
Richman, however, said the cluster v\ ill not be
on the same site or scale as the Reagan Library.
"This cluster is an ideal low-intensity academic
use for the foothills. It is not comparable to the
Reagan Library by any standard at all. Richman
said.
The project's architect, Alton Lee, also said he is
aware of the sensitive location of the proposed
studios.
"We have tried to make this low-key so it won't
be prominent in the landscape,
but (the controversy) is not our
major concern; that's for the
University to deal with." Lee
said.
"The studio is off the beaten
path, which gives it some degree

of privacy," Lee added. "It is
also elevated on a hillside, so it
will receive unobstructed light.
The oak trees around it provide a
large degree of camouflage, so
(the studio) will blend into the
landscape."
Lee has designed other build
ings on Stanford's campus, in
cluding Tresidder Memorial Un
ion and Stern and Wilbur Halls.
"The new studio won't bear

any resemblance to anything on
campus," Lee said.
The proposed structure is the
first of five or six scheduled to be
built in a cluster. When com
pleted, the project will unite fac
ulty artists and art students who
are now scattered across cam
pus. Many of the artists currently
are working in Ryan Lab, which
is scheduled to be demolished in
the near future.
