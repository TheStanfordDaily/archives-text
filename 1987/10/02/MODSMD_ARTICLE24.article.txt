# Program supplies troubled workers

The return to school always
seems to mean a return to long
days on one's feet. There are
books to be bought, things to
get for one's room, long lines
to stand in, class lists to be
signed. But students are not
the only ones whose feet have
been suffering lately.
Carol Larson, Gary Nook
and Arnie Jensen have also
been spending a lot of time on
their feet lately. All three are
working long hours checking
bags in front of the Bookstore
as part of the Miramonte Voca
tional Program, a work pro
gram for emotionally troubled
adults.
This is the third quarter that
participants in the program
have worked at Stanford, said
client counselor Valerie Herst,
who is coordinating the pro
gram's activities at the
Bookstore. "We're really
happy to be here. I really
mean it," she said.
The Miramonte Program
was founded 25 years ago by a
doctor whose son committed
suicide. After the death of his
son, the man decided to
devote himself to counseling
others in need. In addition to
vocational counseling for
people who suffer from mental

illnesses, Miramonte provides
family counseling and has a
program for seniors. It also
has two residential facilities
for people in the vocational
program who are on their way
to getting a steady job.
"The program gives people
a sense of structure and pro
ductivity that is missing in
their lives," Herst said.
Herst has worked at
Miramonte for several years
and said she enjoys it because
"it's a genuinely happy place.
You grow attached to it, and
you don't want to leave."
Although working at Stan
ford has been one of their
more challenging assignments
because of the long workday,
the workers like it because it
pays well. Larson remarked
that she thought working at
Stanford was "real exciting. I
feel like I'm really important,
I'm really needed."
Larson, Jensen, and Nook
agreed that the Miramonte
program was very worthwhile
to them, primarily because it
adds structure to their lives.
"If I didn't do this I would
just be sitting around not doing
anything," Jensen said.
Larson said the Miramonte
program has helped her become
more social. "1 have a lot more
friends, more of a social life
now," she said.
Herst said the people in the
program suffer from chronic
mental illness and have a "sense
of being an outsider." Getting
out and working makes them feel
better about themselves, she
said.
"A lot of times they are very
frustrated, and they have the atti
tude of 1 don't want to deal with
my illness. 1 just want to get a
job,' " Herst said, explaining
that Miramonte helps its partici
pants deal with the fact that they
do have an illness, and, at the
same time, helps them slowly
build up to a point where they
can someday work at a full-time
job.
The program holds seminars
and workshops on how to write
resumes and how to conduct
oneself in an interview. Videotap
ing allows the participants to
watch themselves in an interview
situation.

So, before looking for full-time
positions, the participants learn
how to be reliable and punctual
and how to keep commitments.
In the course of the program they
move from part-time volunteer
work to paid work, and then to
full-time work.
In addition to their work at the
Stanford Bookstore, the people
in the program also do "a lot ot
mail room preparation for non
profit organizations as well as
gardening," Herst said.
Herst finds that the biggest
problem with her clients is that
they often get bored and restless.
"They often think, 'Why am I
not getting paid more? 1 can do
better than this,' " she said.
There have been some big suc
cesses with people who have
stuck with the program,
however. Two people who
recently left after being in the
program for several years are
now working in full-time jobs,
and one is even in a management
position.
Nook, who has been with the
program three years, is getting
ready to move out of one of the
residences and to try living on his
own. He is 36 years old, has at
tended college and has held
several jobs, "but they never

lasted long," he said.
Nook also has two other vol
unteer jobs, one with the Sierra
Club and the other with the Mid-
Peninsula Health Serviee. He is
looking forward to moving out
but has some reservations. "In a
way it will be a stress, too," he
said.
Larson has been in the pro
gram for two years and right now
has a job in the Miramonte ad
ministrative office doing light of
fice work. She hopes someday to
have a full-time office job. Lar
son moved to California from the
Midwest, where she had been
living with her parents. She said
that before joining the Mira
monte program, she "didn't
know that these support groups
existed."
She found, however, that she
liked the program at Miramonte
because it provided her with a
sense of security and also gave
her a degree of independence.
Jensen has been in and out of
institutions and is at Miramonte
for the second time. Although he
is only in the beginning stages of
the program, he already likes the
way it has structured his lite.
He particularly enjoys working
at Stanford. "1 like it a lot. I here
are good vibes here! he said.

ing allows the participants to
watch themselves in an interview
situation.

So, before looking for full-time
positions, the participants learn
how to be reliable and punctual
and how to keep commitments.
In the course of the program they
move from part-time volunteer
work to paid work, and then to
full-time work.
In addition to their work at the
Stanford Bookstore, the people
in the program also do "a lot ot
mail room preparation for non
profit organizations as well as
gardening," Herst said.
Herst finds that the biggest
problem with her clients is that
they often get bored and restless.
"They often think, 'Why am I
not getting paid more? 1 can do
better than this,' " she said.
There have been some big suc
cesses with people who have
stuck with the program,
however. Two people who
recently left after being in the
program for several years are
now working in full-time jobs,
and one is even in a management
position.
Nook, who has been with the
program three years, is getting
ready to move out of one of the
residences and to try living on his
own. He is 36 years old, has at
tended college and has held
several jobs, "but they never

lasted long," he said.
Nook also has two other vol
unteer jobs, one with the Sierra
Club and the other with the Mid-
Peninsula Health Serviee. He is
looking forward to moving out
but has some reservations. "In a
way it will be a stress, too," he
said.
Larson has been in the pro
gram for two years and right now
has a job in the Miramonte ad
ministrative office doing light of
fice work. She hopes someday to
have a full-time office job. Lar
son moved to California from the
Midwest, where she had been
living with her parents. She said
that before joining the Mira
monte program, she "didn't
know that these support groups
existed."
She found, however, that she
liked the program at Miramonte
because it provided her with a
sense of security and also gave
her a degree of independence.
Jensen has been in and out of
institutions and is at Miramonte
for the second time. Although he
is only in the beginning stages of
the program, he already likes the
way it has structured his lite.
He particularly enjoys working
at Stanford. "1 like it a lot. I here
are good vibes here! he said.

Arnold Jensen, a participant in the Miramonte Vocational Program for
emotionally troubled adults, helps check bags at the Bookstore.
The return to school always
seems to mean a return to long
days on one's feet. There are
books to be bought, things to
get for one's room, long lines
to stand in, class lists to be
signed. But students are not
the only ones whose feet have
been suffering lately.
Carol Larson, Gary Nook
and Arnie Jensen have also
been spending a lot of time on
their feet lately. All three are
working long hours checking
bags in front of the Bookstore
as part of the Miramonte Voca
tional Program, a work pro
gram for emotionally troubled
adults.
This is the third quarter that
participants in the program
have worked at Stanford, said
client counselor Valerie Herst,
who is coordinating the pro
gram's activities at the
Bookstore. "We're really
happy to be here. I really
mean it," she said.
The Miramonte Program
was founded 25 years ago by a
doctor whose son committed
suicide. After the death of his
son, the man decided to
devote himself to counseling
others in need. In addition to
vocational counseling for
people who suffer from mental

illnesses, Miramonte provides
family counseling and has a
program for seniors. It also
has two residential facilities
for people in the vocational
program who are on their way
to getting a steady job.
"The program gives people
a sense of structure and pro
ductivity that is missing in
their lives," Herst said.
Herst has worked at
Miramonte for several years
and said she enjoys it because
"it's a genuinely happy place.
You grow attached to it, and
you don't want to leave."
Although working at Stan
ford has been one of their
more challenging assignments
because of the long workday,
the workers like it because it
pays well. Larson remarked
that she thought working at
Stanford was "real exciting. I
feel like I'm really important,
I'm really needed."
Larson, Jensen, and Nook
agreed that the Miramonte
program was very worthwhile
to them, primarily because it
adds structure to their lives.
"If I didn't do this I would
just be sitting around not doing
anything," Jensen said.
Larson said the Miramonte
program has helped her become
more social. "1 have a lot more
friends, more of a social life
now," she said.
Herst said the people in the
program suffer from chronic
mental illness and have a "sense
of being an outsider." Getting
out and working makes them feel
better about themselves, she
said.
"A lot of times they are very
frustrated, and they have the atti
tude of 1 don't want to deal with
my illness. 1 just want to get a
job,' " Herst said, explaining
that Miramonte helps its partici
pants deal with the fact that they
do have an illness, and, at the
same time, helps them slowly
build up to a point where they
can someday work at a full-time
job.
The program holds seminars
and workshops on how to write
resumes and how to conduct
oneself in an interview. Videotap
ing allows the participants to
watch themselves in an interview
situation.
