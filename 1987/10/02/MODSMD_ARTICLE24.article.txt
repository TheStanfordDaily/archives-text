# Program supplies troubled workers

The return to school always
seems to mean a return to long
days on one's feet. There are
books to be bought, things to
get for one's room, long lines
to stand in, class lists to be
signed. But students are not
the only ones whose feet have
been suffering lately.
Carol Larson, Gary Nook
and Arnie Jensen have also
been spending a lot of time on
their feet lately. All three are
working long hours checking
bags in front of the Bookstore
as part of the Miramonte Voca
tional Program, a work pro
gram for emotionally troubled
adults.
This is the third quarter that
participants in the program
have worked at Stanford, said
client counselor Valerie Herst,
who is coordinating the pro
gram's activities at the
Bookstore. "We're really
happy to be here. I really
mean it," she said.
The Miramonte Program
was founded 25 years ago by a
doctor whose son committed
suicide. After the death of his
son, the man decided to
devote himself to counseling
others in need. In addition to
vocational counseling for
people who suffer from mental

illnesses, Miramonte provides
family counseling and has a
program for seniors. It also
has two residential facilities
for people in the vocational
program who are on their way
to getting a steady job.
"The program gives people
a sense of structure and pro
ductivity that is missing in
their lives," Herst said.
Herst has worked at
Miramonte for several years
and said she enjoys it because
"it's a genuinely happy place.
You grow attached to it, and
you don't want to leave."
Although working at Stan
ford has been one of their
more challenging assignments
because of the long workday,
the workers like it because it
pays well. Larson remarked
that she thought working at
Stanford was "real exciting. I
feel like I'm really important,
I'm really needed."
Larson, Jensen, and Nook
agreed that the Miramonte
program was very worthwhile
to them, primarily because it
adds structure to their lives.
"If I didn't do this I would
just be sitting around not doing
anything," Jensen said.
