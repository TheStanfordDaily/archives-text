## Study breakthrough for computers Professors solve ancient paradox 
### Joyce Mitamura 
Imagine someone telling you. "I am
lying." Without using any obvious clues,
such as the tone of the person's voice, could
you determine whether the statement is true
or not?
This puzzle, known traditionally as "the
Liar," has confounded philosophers since it
first appeared in the Epistle of Paul to Titus.
Recently, two Stanford professors claim to
have stumbled upon the solution with the aid
of a computer. Their discovery, they said,
will help in the search for a computer that can
fully understand the complexities of human
language.
Philosophy Prof. Jon Barwise, director of
the University's Symbolic Systems Program,
and Asst. Philosophy Prof. John
Etchemendy, have written a book about the
Liar puzzle and its significance. The book is
titled. "The Liar: An Essay on Truth and Cir
cularity."
To understand the solution to the puzzle,
one must first comprehend the paradox posed
by the statement, the book says.
The difficulty with The Liar Puzzle is that
if one assumes that the speaker is telling the
truth, the statement must be false, in which
case the speaker is lying. But if it is assumed
that the speaker is lying, then the statement
must be true, in which case the speaker is
telling the truth.
The actual answer to this paradox is that
the statement is usually false. Bartwise and
Etchemendy spend over 100 pages of their
book explaining why this is the case. But the
solution is not so significant in itself, they
claim.
What is more important is how the dis
covery can help in the development of artifi
cial intelligence.

"What's crucial is that the solution shows
you the kinds of trouble you can get in if you
ignore context in your mathematical account
of language," Barwise said.
In order for a computer to understand the
semantics of a sentence more than just a
precise description of the grammar is needed.
A complete theory of semantics must be able
to tell when a statement is true or false by an
analysis of the context in which the statement
is made.
The Liar puzzle shows researchers that a
computer would also need to understand the
context of the sentence before deciding if it
was true or false.
The same sentence can make different
claims depending on the context.

"The sentence (of the Liar's paradox) can
express various things in various contexts,"
Etchemendy said. When the context is estab
lished, the exact meaning of the claim can he
determined as can its validity. "Typically it
will simply he false," Etchemendy said, "We
have solved the paradox because there is
nothing contradictory at all about the claim
anymore."
Until now logicians have largely ignored
the issue of context, and this is why they
have failed to solve the paradox of the Liar
Likewise, until logicians and researchers in
artificial intelligence are able to mathemati
cally describe context, the problem of creat
ing a computer that understands human
speech will not he solved.
