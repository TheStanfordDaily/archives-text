# Squad faces criticism
## Cheerleaders make debut 
### Kim Walsh 
When it comes to school spirit,
Stanford fans have traditionally
been laid back. Cheering and
key-rattling are spontaneous
events that have never been or
ganized.
This year however, junior Kris
Jessen and the new coed cheer
leading squad that she founded,
the Stanford Cheerleaders, are
out to eliminate what some view
as crowd apathy by whipping
spectators into a cheering frenzy.
Jessen said she decided to
form the squad last spring be
cause she was "frustrated about
(the lack of) crowd response at
football games." She said she
also missed being a cheerleader
after cheerleading throughout
high school.
She received approval for the
squad in the spring from Athletic
Director Andy Geiger, then

rounded up a squad of nine other
students: senior Fdwin Cooka,
juniors Fatima Ford, Sylvia Min,
Lani Kanehe and Zorn Brock,
and sophomores Shawne
Neeper, Matt Brodlie, Anne
James and J.J. Kuo.

The cheerleaders
are "a good idea,'
because there's 'not
enough school
spirit' at Stanford.

The cheerleaders now practice
regularly and are preparing for
Big Game, the only football game
this year at which they plan to
make an appearance.
The four men and six women
made their fall quarter debut

Sunday at "Music and Fun Un
der the Sun," part of Orientation
Week.
The squad will pass up most of
the football season hut will per
form during the basketball
season. The more intimate at
mosphere at basketball games
should make crowds more
receptive to the cheerleaders'
performances, Jessen said. The
squad plans to cheer at all bas
ketball home games and will
travel with the team to three
games in California.
While some students have
questioned the need for a cheer
leading squad, Dollie Anne
Chun, a sophomore, said she and
her fellow Dollies have no hostile
feelings towards the cheer
leaders. The cheerleaders are "a
good idea," Chun said, because
there is "not enough school
