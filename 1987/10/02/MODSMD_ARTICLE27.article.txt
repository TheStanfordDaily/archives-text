## Bolder and balder: a terrific new 'Trek' 
### Andrew Berkowitz Staff writer 
"Star Trek — The Next Genera
tion," the television series that
Trekkies and normal folks have been
waiting for with some skepticism, is fi
nally here. And surprise: Judging from
the premiere episode, which will be
rebroadcast at p.m. Sunday on Chan
nel 44, the new show is terrific!
It is now the 24th century, Stardate
41153.7. The new. improved starship
Enterprise (not to be confused with the
new, unimproved Enterprise in the
"Star Trek" movies), complete with a
revamped crew, is again sailing the uni
verse in search of strange new life and
civilizations. No more "five-year mis
sion"' for these space invaders; the
opening voice-over now describes the
mission as "continuing," presumably
until the Next Generation gets replaced
by the New Monkees.
Things have changed since the good
of days when the only good Klingon
was a dead Klingon. Now the Klingons
are — you may want to sit down for
this — members of the Federation. The
Enterprise even has a Klingon on the
bridge: Wort" the Klingon (played by
Michael Dorn). Yes, Worf. That's the
sound a golden retriever makes when it
barfs. And the poor Klingon really
looks like he has a cow pie on his
forehead.
The captain of the new Enterprise is
Jean-Luc Picard (Patrick Stewart). He
looks and acts like Alan Cranston. The

first officer is William Shatner clone
William Riker (Johnathan Frakes).
Riker is personable, attractive, likeable
and intelligent. Picard is bald, dull, old,
quiet and he hates children. Gene Rod
denbery, if you're out there, take my
advice: Beam Captain Picard into a
rock and promote Riker.
Rounding out the new characters are
Security Chief Tasha Yar (Denise
Crosby), a built, blonde karate expert
who looks great in the snug 24th cen
tury uniforms and who is always
looking to beat up the enemy; psychic
Deanna Trol < Marina Sirtis), the female
character who gets the privilege of
wearing the Lieutenant Uhura
Memorial Miniskirt and emphatically
crying a lot; Lieutenant Commander
Data (Brent Spiner), a pale but person
able android who takes Spock's place
by being both emotionless and about a
billion times smarter than anybody on
the bridge; and Lieutenant Geordi
Laforge (Levar Burton), who is blind
but wears special glasses that make
him see twice as well, anyway.
It was hard getting used to seeing
these strange characters on the bridge,
but by the end of the show they seemed
to be showing some real potential.
Gone are Scotty, Kirk, Sulu and
Chekov (McCoy makes a cameo ap
pearance at the age of 137 — he still
looks the same), but these characters
hold a new kind of appeal (except for
Picard, who's too bald to be appeal
ing). Also, because they use the music
from the "Star Trek" movies, it feels
like "Star Trek."

Gene Roddenbery, the producer of
both the old and new "Treks," has
been smart enough to realize why the
old "Trek" was successful. The chal
lenge was to make the new "Trek" bad
enough so that it would be as good as
the great old bad "Treks."
Got that? It was a relief to see that
the mediocre special effects and cheap,
cardboard sets are still there. The
bridge still doesn't look like you could
control a space ship from it; in fact, it
looks like a hotel lobby — 1 kept ex
pecting to see potted plants and a bel
lhop. Trekkies don't want to see "Star
Wars;" Trekkies want to see kitsch.
Even the humor is still there. Wit
ness this exchange between Riker and
Data:
Riker: "Do you feel superior to me
because you're an android'.'"
Data: "1 am superior ... but I'd
gladly give it up to be human."
(Perhaps he should visit the great
and powerful Wizard of Oz!?!)
Remember "Battlestar Galactica,"
the last of the great network space
shows? (Yes? Try therapy, it might
help you forget.) "Battlestar Galac
tica" had great characters, top-flight
special effects, and perhaps the worst
plot situation ever created for a space
series.
For a while that "rag-tag fugitive
fleet looking for that planet known as
Earth" was kind of compelling, but
after a while it became pretty apparent

that they were not going to find
Earth. Do you remember what
happened when they discovered
Earth? Commander Adama went
back to selling Alpo. and Kenner
had a surplus of about ten zillion
Starbuek action figures.
"Star Trek" breaks the rules
of space shows. Sure, maybe
Yoda can lift a spaceship out of a
swamp using The Force, but
"Star Wars" never had a giant
jellyfish get kidnapped by an old
geezer, be forced to transform it
self into a space base, and then
be reunited with its mate in an
explicit reunion made possible by
the hard work of Captain Cranst
. . . er, Picard and his crew. And
that was only the first episode of
the new "Trek."
"Star Trek" never scored well
in the ratings when it was first
aired in the sixties, but then took
off phenomenally years later in
syndication. A similar fate will
probably befall the "Next Gener
ation," because there simply
aren't enough Trekkies among
the Nielson families of America.
Hut boy are your kids gonna
love it!

Data:
Riker: "Do you feel superior to me
because you're an android'.'"
Data: "1 am superior ... but I'd
gladly give it up to be human."
(Perhaps he should visit the great
and powerful Wizard of Oz!?!)
Remember "Battlestar Galactica,"
the last of the great network space
shows? (Yes? Try therapy, it might
help you forget.) "Battlestar Galac
tica" had great characters, top-flight
special effects, and perhaps the worst
plot situation ever created for a space
series.
For a while that "rag-tag fugitive
fleet looking for that planet known as
Earth" was kind of compelling, but
after a while it became pretty apparent

that they were not going to find
Earth. Do you remember what
happened when they discovered
Earth? Commander Adama went
back to selling Alpo. and Kenner
had a surplus of about ten zillion
Starbuek action figures.
"Star Trek" breaks the rules
of space shows. Sure, maybe
Yoda can lift a spaceship out of a
swamp using The Force, but
"Star Wars" never had a giant
jellyfish get kidnapped by an old
geezer, be forced to transform it
self into a space base, and then
be reunited with its mate in an
explicit reunion made possible by
the hard work of Captain Cranst
. . . er, Picard and his crew. And
that was only the first episode of
the new "Trek."
"Star Trek" never scored well
in the ratings when it was first
aired in the sixties, but then took
off phenomenally years later in
syndication. A similar fate will
probably befall the "Next Gener
ation," because there simply
aren't enough Trekkies among
the Nielson families of America.
Hut boy are your kids gonna
love it!
"Star Trek — The Next Genera
tion," the television series that
Trekkies and normal folks have been
waiting for with some skepticism, is fi
nally here. And surprise: Judging from
the premiere episode, which will be
rebroadcast at p.m. Sunday on Chan
nel 44, the new show is terrific!
It is now the 24th century, Stardate
41153.7. The new. improved starship
Enterprise (not to be confused with the
new, unimproved Enterprise in the
"Star Trek" movies), complete with a
revamped crew, is again sailing the uni
verse in search of strange new life and
civilizations. No more "five-year mis
sion"' for these space invaders; the
opening voice-over now describes the
mission as "continuing," presumably
until the Next Generation gets replaced
by the New Monkees.
Things have changed since the good
of days when the only good Klingon
was a dead Klingon. Now the Klingons
are — you may want to sit down for
this — members of the Federation. The
Enterprise even has a Klingon on the
bridge: Wort" the Klingon (played by
Michael Dorn). Yes, Worf. That's the
sound a golden retriever makes when it
barfs. And the poor Klingon really
looks like he has a cow pie on his
forehead.
The captain of the new Enterprise is
Jean-Luc Picard (Patrick Stewart). He
looks and acts like Alan Cranston. The

first officer is William Shatner clone
William Riker (Johnathan Frakes).
Riker is personable, attractive, likeable
and intelligent. Picard is bald, dull, old,
quiet and he hates children. Gene Rod
denbery, if you're out there, take my
advice: Beam Captain Picard into a
rock and promote Riker.
Rounding out the new characters are
Security Chief Tasha Yar (Denise
Crosby), a built, blonde karate expert
who looks great in the snug 24th cen
tury uniforms and who is always
looking to beat up the enemy; psychic
Deanna Trol < Marina Sirtis), the female
character who gets the privilege of
wearing the Lieutenant Uhura
Memorial Miniskirt and emphatically
crying a lot; Lieutenant Commander
Data (Brent Spiner), a pale but person
able android who takes Spock's place
by being both emotionless and about a
billion times smarter than anybody on
the bridge; and Lieutenant Geordi
Laforge (Levar Burton), who is blind
but wears special glasses that make
him see twice as well, anyway.
It was hard getting used to seeing
these strange characters on the bridge,
but by the end of the show they seemed
to be showing some real potential.
Gone are Scotty, Kirk, Sulu and
Chekov (McCoy makes a cameo ap
pearance at the age of 137 — he still
looks the same), but these characters
hold a new kind of appeal (except for
Picard, who's too bald to be appeal
ing). Also, because they use the music
from the "Star Trek" movies, it feels
like "Star Trek."

Gene Roddenbery, the producer of
both the old and new "Treks," has
been smart enough to realize why the
old "Trek" was successful. The chal
lenge was to make the new "Trek" bad
enough so that it would be as good as
the great old bad "Treks."
Got that? It was a relief to see that
the mediocre special effects and cheap,
cardboard sets are still there. The
bridge still doesn't look like you could
control a space ship from it; in fact, it
looks like a hotel lobby — 1 kept ex
pecting to see potted plants and a bel
lhop. Trekkies don't want to see "Star
Wars;" Trekkies want to see kitsch.
Even the humor is still there. Wit
ness this exchange between Riker and
Data:
Riker: "Do you feel superior to me
because you're an android'.'"

gladly give it up to be human."
