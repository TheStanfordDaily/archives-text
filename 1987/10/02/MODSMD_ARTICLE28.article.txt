# Author Barker raises hell in movies
## 
### Mark Tompkins Editorial staff 
In the past year, you may have
heard the name Clive Barker
buzzing around your conscious
ness. A novelist, short story
writer, dramatist and illustrator.
Barker is the latest Goliath to
swagger through the media
landscape. Formerly a play
wright, our man Clive decided a
few years ago to try his hand at
writing horror fiction, with spec
tacular, revolting, screaming
meemies results.
His short story collections,
"The Books of Blood," were
bestsellers in his native Britain
and were praised by genre heavy
weights like Peter Straub and
Stephen King. (Oh, how they
were praised by Stephen King.
It's a wonder King doesn't sign
on as Barker's official drum
majorette, he praises Barker so
much).
As their lurid title promises,
The Books of Blood are full of
visceral bits of nastiness. But
what made Barker's reputation is
that his stories, undeniably im
aginative, create a uniquely
modern horror. First of all, he
refuses to use any reheated old

formulae or warmed-over cli
ches. Further, he dispenses with
any sense of compromise or sen
timentality to make the going
easier for the reader.
Barker's only flaw was that in
writing his compact little Grand
Guignol masterworks, he occa
sionally had trouble creating
characters who weren't just
props easily thrown into
bodybags once they were no
longer needed. But, ever on the
ascent, Barker rectified this
problem in his recent novel The
Diminution Chime, a brilliantly
updated retelling of the Faust
parable. By creating characters
who were actually sympathetic,
not to mention interesting,
Barker made the sense of im
pending doom in his novel all the
more "doom-y," shall we say.
And now our boy has tried his
hand at movies, with "Hell
raiser." The film is being sold
with recommendations from —
who else — Stephen King, whose
own film-making debut,
"Maximum Overdrive," earned
a few hearty guffaws, and little
else, last year.
Barker has tried something a
little more ambitious, and 1 wish
1 could say he's succeeded. But

he didn't. Nope. It's nice to
know that he can't do everything
well. "Hellraiser" is a big disap
pointment.
Barker has fashioned a promis
ing story about a man and wife
(played by Andrew Robinson and
Claire Higgins) who move into a
roach mill of an old house in Eng
land. The house was once owned
by Robinson's brother Frank, a
compulsive hedonist who, un
beknownst to anyone else, began
seeking otherwordly pleasures
after he exhausted all earthly
ones. Through the aid of an in
geniously designed Oriental
cube, he tapped into another di
mension and vanished.
Or so it seemed. In her ex
plorations of the house, Higgins
discovers that a gruesomely
decomposed Frank has returned,
but needs fresh blood in order to
look a bit more presentable. Hig
gins is mightily aroused by Frank
and agrees to supply him with
victims, the memory of her adul
terous affair with him being her
prime motivation. (Sins of the
flesh can't take place if your fel
low sinner has no flesh, you see).
The only problem is that Frank
has to get himself together before
the Cenobites can locate him.

The Cenobites are fantastic,
freakish creatures, other-di
mensional de Sades summoned
by Frank's Oriental cube. In
their hazy realm, sensual plea
sure is comingled with pain and
torture. It's more than even
Frank can bear, and so he must
escape.
So far, so good. Barker's fic
tion is often suffused with
eroticism — it's part and parcel
of his modern terrors — and he
creates an intriguing triangle of
desire gone amok here. But, just
when things look like they're
about to get really wild (when, as

a viewer, you start to sink very
low in your seat to avoid getting
splattered) Barker has Frank's
teenage niece (Ashley Laurence)
and her boyfriend (played by
some stiff whose name history
will soon forget, just as I already
have), save the day.
These two are cute and bland,
and you hate them at first sight.
Barker does absolutely nothing
to make either character interest
ing. Their unrelieved innocence
makes the movie's climax wildly
unconvincing. Barker seems to
be just going through the motions
of a conventional ending; you
know that in his heart of hearts
he'd rather have the Cenobites
come out on top. And he should
have, but the name of the game
here seems to be mainstream
concessions.
Thus the movie is dragged
down, kicking and screaming, by
the two Clearasil refugees.
Which is too bad, because the
Cenobites are a real explosion
from Barker's subconscious, and
il looks like someday he could
write and direct a good movie —
one that doesn't cop out on its
baser instincts. As things stand
now, the (itle "Hellraiser" is just
wishful thinking.

on as Barker's official drum
majorette, he praises Barker so
much).
As their lurid title promises,
The Books of Blood are full of
visceral bits of nastiness. But
what made Barker's reputation is
that his stories, undeniably im
aginative, create a uniquely
modern horror. First of all, he
refuses to use any reheated old

formulae or warmed-over cli
ches. Further, he dispenses with
any sense of compromise or sen
timentality to make the going
easier for the reader.
Barker's only flaw was that in
writing his compact little Grand
Guignol masterworks, he occa
sionally had trouble creating
characters who weren't just
props easily thrown into
bodybags once they were no
longer needed. But, ever on the
ascent, Barker rectified this
problem in his recent novel The
Diminution Chime, a brilliantly
updated retelling of the Faust
parable. By creating characters
who were actually sympathetic,
not to mention interesting,
Barker made the sense of im
pending doom in his novel all the
more "doom-y," shall we say.
And now our boy has tried his
hand at movies, with "Hell
raiser." The film is being sold
with recommendations from —
who else — Stephen King, whose
own film-making debut,
"Maximum Overdrive," earned
a few hearty guffaws, and little
else, last year.
Barker has tried something a
little more ambitious, and 1 wish
1 could say he's succeeded. But

he didn't. Nope. It's nice to
know that he can't do everything
well. "Hellraiser" is a big disap
pointment.
Barker has fashioned a promis
ing story about a man and wife
(played by Andrew Robinson and
Claire Higgins) who move into a
roach mill of an old house in Eng
land. The house was once owned
by Robinson's brother Frank, a
compulsive hedonist who, un
beknownst to anyone else, began
seeking otherwordly pleasures
after he exhausted all earthly
ones. Through the aid of an in
geniously designed Oriental
cube, he tapped into another di
mension and vanished.
Or so it seemed. In her ex
plorations of the house, Higgins
discovers that a gruesomely
decomposed Frank has returned,
but needs fresh blood in order to
look a bit more presentable. Hig
gins is mightily aroused by Frank
and agrees to supply him with
victims, the memory of her adul
terous affair with him being her
prime motivation. (Sins of the
flesh can't take place if your fel
low sinner has no flesh, you see).
The only problem is that Frank
has to get himself together before
the Cenobites can locate him.

The Cenobites are fantastic,
freakish creatures, other-di
mensional de Sades summoned
by Frank's Oriental cube. In
their hazy realm, sensual plea
sure is comingled with pain and
torture. It's more than even
Frank can bear, and so he must
escape.
So far, so good. Barker's fic
tion is often suffused with
eroticism — it's part and parcel
of his modern terrors — and he
creates an intriguing triangle of
desire gone amok here. But, just
when things look like they're
about to get really wild (when, as

a viewer, you start to sink very
low in your seat to avoid getting
splattered) Barker has Frank's
teenage niece (Ashley Laurence)
and her boyfriend (played by
some stiff whose name history
will soon forget, just as I already
have), save the day.
These two are cute and bland,
and you hate them at first sight.
Barker does absolutely nothing
to make either character interest
ing. Their unrelieved innocence
makes the movie's climax wildly
unconvincing. Barker seems to
be just going through the motions
of a conventional ending; you
know that in his heart of hearts
he'd rather have the Cenobites
come out on top. And he should
have, but the name of the game
here seems to be mainstream
concessions.
Thus the movie is dragged
down, kicking and screaming, by
the two Clearasil refugees.
Which is too bad, because the
Cenobites are a real explosion
from Barker's subconscious, and
il looks like someday he could
write and direct a good movie —
one that doesn't cop out on its
baser instincts. As things stand
now, the (itle "Hellraiser" is just
wishful thinking.

In the past year, you may have
heard the name Clive Barker
buzzing around your conscious
ness. A novelist, short story
writer, dramatist and illustrator.
Barker is the latest Goliath to
swagger through the media
landscape. Formerly a play
wright, our man Clive decided a
few years ago to try his hand at
writing horror fiction, with spec
tacular, revolting, screaming
meemies results.
His short story collections,
"The Books of Blood," were
bestsellers in his native Britain
and were praised by genre heavy
weights like Peter Straub and
Stephen King. (Oh, how they
were praised by Stephen King.
