## UCLA visits 0-3 Card 
### Susan Slusser Senior staff writer 
Tomorrow's Pacific 10 contest
between Stanford (0-3) and I lth
ranked UCLA (3-1) has been
hyped for months as the match
up between Heisman candidates
Gaston Green and Brad Muster.
Only one has a legitimate shot at
the Heisman Trophy now,
however, and the other might not
even play.
Stanford tailback Muster,
whose sprained left ankle kept
him out of most of the Washing
ton game and all of the Colorado
game, did not practice yesterday
after re-injuring the ankle in
practice Wednesday. He is still
listed as probable for the UCLA
game, however.
UCLA tailback Gaston Green,
on the other hand, has made the
most of the Bruins' first four
games, picking up 445 yards and
five touchdowns on the ground
this season. The senior rushed
for a season-high 149 yards
against Arizona last week, and
ran for 142 yards and three
touchdowns in Stanford's 28-23
upset last year.
"Gaston Green is a great run
ning back, Stanford cornerback

Kevin Scott said. "He has a lot
of elusiveness and speed, and
great cut back ability. We're
going to have to really try to con
tain him rushing. He's a Heisman
I rophy candidate so he must be
doing something right."
I he Bruins also nave a transfer
quarterback who is doing some
thing right. But what is an Okla
homa boy — especially one
named Troy (that, of course,
being the place Trojans are from)
— doing playing at UCLA?
The real question, according to
Stanford Head Coach Jack El
way, is why was Troy Aikman
ever at Oklahoma? "There's
probably a reason why he left
Oklahoma," Elway said. "The
question is why he went to Okla
homa in the first place."
Oklahoma, of course, is a run
ning team. Aikman is a passer. In
fact, the junior, who sat out last
year after going from Sooners to
the Bruins, is currently leading
the nation in passing. "He's a
mature player and an excellent
passer," Flway said. "He's got
to be one of the better passers
there in a long time."
I his gives UCLA a dangerous
two-pronged attack paced by
Green and Aikman . Aikman has

completed 48 of 71 passes for 776
yards and four touchdowns. He
was good on 19 of 25 attempts for
256 yards and three scores last
week against the Wildcats.
Aikman's favorite target is
split end Willie "Flipper" Ander
son, who caught four passes for
101 yards in the UCLA's 34-24
win over Arizona. The senior is
averaging 24.5 yards per recep
tion and has scored twice.
There is a weak spot in the of
fense, however, believe it or not.
The offensive line allowed 10
sacks against Fresno State.
("Certainly a UCLA record,"
UCLA Coach Terry Donahue
said.) Luckily for UCLA, no
Bruin quarterbacks were killed,
but either the line will have to im
prove or Troy Aikman will spend
a lot of time running.
Once they've made a mis
take, they're not active enough
or quick enough to recover,"
Donahue said of his line. "That
really can't be rectified except
through recruiting."
No such problem on the defen
sive line, which is led by senior
noseguard Terry Tumey, with 25

preseason Heisman Irophy candidate, Muster has been injured for most of the season and is listed as
probable for the 12:30 p.m. start.
