### David kazanjian 
Representatives of a Stanford
coalition to block the nomination
of Judge Robert Bork to the Su
preme Court will stage a three
day letter-writing campaign in
opposition to Bork's nomination.
Today, Monday and Tuesday,
the coalition will have tables set
up in White Plaza where students
can "write a letter or just a quick
postcard to their senators," said
coalition representative Barb
Voss. The campaign will be
aimed particularly at California
Senators Pete Wilson, a Republi

can. and Democrat Alan
Cranston.
Members of the coalition said
they hoped to put particular pics
sure on Wilson, who is up for re
election next year, and who has
said he will vote for Bork.
Cranston has said he will
oppose Bork's confirmation.
The coalition decided against
staging a rally in opposition to
Bork. "There does not seem to
be enough energy right now, it
being the very beginning of
school, to hold a rally here,"
Voss said.
Coalition members also plan to

visit dorms over the next few
days to seek support for their ef
fort.
The Washington-based Na
tional Student Action Commit
tee. which is organizing National
Block Hork Day, will hold a rally
in Washington Tuesday to
coincide with rallies anil letter
writing campaigns on campuses
across the country. UC Her
keley, UC-Santa Barbara and
San Jose State are among the
California schools planning
rallies.
Voss said members of the Stan
ford coaltion oppose Bork's
nomination because of his record
on civil rights and human rights
cases.
"We are against Bork because
of hi s views on civil rights,
privacy, (and) especially because
of his enforcement of sodomy
laws and his challenge to abor
tion and to birth control," she
said.
"We feel he doesn't look at the
needs of different groups. ... It
seems like the human element
doesn't matter to Bork, and
that's the kind of ideology we are
working against," she said.
"You see, it's not only Bork we
arc against, but any judge who
won't take into consideration all
people,s needs."

The Senate Judiciary Commit
tee is expected to vote either
today or early next week on
whether or not to recommend
confirmation of Bork, and the full
Senate is scheduled to vote on
the nomination at the end of this
month.
"At this point I think he will
fail," said Voss. "But it will he
close. We need to continue lob
bying efforts across the country,
especially in light of Reagan's
new campaign to support Bork.
I Reagan] has a lot of political
power, and 1 would like a safer
margin in the Senate."

endorsed by Stanford Organiza
tion for Lesbian and Gay
Equality, Stanford Out of South
Africa, Students United for a
Democratic Education, The
Women's Center and the Aids
Education Project.
