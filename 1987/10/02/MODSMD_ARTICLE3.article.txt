Representatives of a Stanford
coalition to block the nomination
of Judge Robert Bork to the Su
preme Court will stage a three
day letter-writing campaign in
opposition to Bork's nomination.
Today, Monday and Tuesday,
the coalition will have tables set
up in White Plaza where students
can "write a letter or just a quick
postcard to their senators," said
coalition representative Barb
Voss. The campaign will be
aimed particularly at California
Senators Pete Wilson, a Republi

can. and Democrat Alan
Cranston.
Members of the coalition said
they hoped to put particular pics
sure on Wilson, who is up for re
election next year, and who has
said he will vote for Bork.
Cranston has said he will
oppose Bork's confirmation.
The coalition decided against
staging a rally in opposition to
Bork. "There does not seem to
be enough energy right now, it
being the very beginning of
school, to hold a rally here,"
Voss said.
Coalition members also plan to

visit dorms over the next few
days to seek support for their ef
fort.
The Washington-based Na
tional Student Action Commit
tee. which is organizing National
Block Hork Day, will hold a rally
in Washington Tuesday to
coincide with rallies anil letter
writing campaigns on campuses
across the country. UC Her
keley, UC-Santa Barbara and
San Jose State are among the
California schools planning
rallies.
