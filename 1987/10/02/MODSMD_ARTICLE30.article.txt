# Stanford rolls, faces Texas tonight
## 
### Chris Crader Editorial staff 
According to Judy Garland in"The
Wizard of Oz, there's no place like
home.
The players on the Stanford
women s volleyball team, however,
would probably amend that statement
to say, " I here's no place like home
away from home." Since the dorms
opened a couple weeks ago and the
players moved in.the team has
produced four impressive results, the
latest a 15-8. 16-14. 15-11 win over UC-
Santa Barbara last night in the opening
round of the second annual Jostens In
vitational Tournament. In the other
semifinal, I'exas beat California 15-6,
15-8. 15-12. I he finals are tonight at
Maples Pavilion with Cal playing Santa
Barbara tor third place at 6 p.m. Stan
ford and Texas square off for the title at
8 p.m.
The Cardinal's victory over the 13th
ranked Gauchos followed a blowout of
Cal last Tuesday and a pair of easy
wins over Washington and Washington
State last weekend. The Cardinal has
only dropped one game in its last four
matches.
Stanford s attack was again led by
senior Teresa Smith. Smith led the
team with 18 kills and chipped in 17
digs. Senior Nancy Reno added 16 kills
and 15 digs to the cause, hitting .371.
Junior Amy Hayes led the team with
a .421 hitting percentage and came up
with 23 digs, second only to the 25 digs
of senior setter Wendi Rush. Junior
Laura Olesen also played a big role, re
cording eight blocks.
Santa Barbara did not go down with
out a fight, though. Despite playing a
grueling two-and-one-half hour match

the previous night — a match they won
16-14 in the fifth game — and driving
up from San Luis Obispo yesterday
morning, the Gauchos gave N0.5 Stan
ford a good scare.
I he Gauchos were led by senior
middle blocker Judy Bellomo who
posted a team-high 18 kills, four ser
vice aces, 18 digs and five total blocks.
Santa Barbara's other senior starter,
Yami Menendez, was kept well in
check by the Cardinal blockers,
however, as she tallied I I kills but only
a .(>64 hitting mark.
Stanford not only swept the three
games, but took each one in a different
fashion. Santa Barbara jumped out to a
7-0 lead in game one, but the blocking
of Olesen and sophomore Lara Asper
turned the tide and a Rush kill ended
the comeback at 15-8.
Game two was close all the way, and
. Santa Barbara was actually serving for
the game at 14-13, but Stanford hung
tough. A Smith kill got the serve back
for the Cardinal, and Olesen and Smith
scored with a block. Olesen then
teamed with Asper for another block,
giving Stanford a game point. That was
all they needed as Smith ended it by
burying her 10th kill of the game.
In game three it was Stanford's turn
to take a big lead, and the Cardinal ap
peared to have everything under con
trol at 13-4. I'he Gauchos crept back to
14-11, however, before Smith's 18th
kill on the seventh match point ended
the contest.
Stanford is now 9-3, 4-1 in the Pac
-10. while Santa Barbara is 11-6, 3-2 in
the Pacific Coast Athletic Conference.
I thought we were sloppy in
spells," Stanford Coach Don Shaw
said. "(But) Santa Barbara had some
thing to do with it."

Shaw added, ' I was pleased with the
way we won each game. On the whole I
was pretty pleased."
I he second match was not as close,
as the Lady Longhorns' hitting and
blocking overwhelmed the Bears.
Outside hitter Angie Alhrecht had a
match-high 15 kills, and Texas' All-
America candidates, middle blockers
Dawn Davenport and Karen Kramer,
had 15 and 12 kills, respectively.
Kramer and Davenport had five
blocks each, while Alhrecht and Katie
Salen had tour apiece to cripple Cal's
offense. The Bears hit only .053 as a
team, and freshman Lisa Arce was the
only Bear with more than three kills.
No. I I Texas goes into tonight s
match at 7-4 and 1-0 in the Southwest
Conference, while unranked Cal is now
5-7, 2-3 in the Pac-10.
I hey (Texas) are a good team,"
Shaw said. "It's going to be an inter
esting match. We're gtjing to have to
control the ball better than we did
tonight. Ihey're a big blocking team.
I hey don t let a lot of balls hit the
floor."
Stanford will also be looking for a
little revenge. The Cardinal went to
Austin for two matches early last
season, and didn't have much luck.
Rush and Reno both suffered injuries
and missed parts of the two matches,
and the Cardinal left after winning only
one of seven games. Stanford,
however, still does lead the series 6-3.
Santa Barbara is the favorite in the
third place game. The Gauchos have
beaten the Bears nine out of the 10
times the two teams have met, includ
ing a 15-9, 15-3 swamping last year.
The Gauchos also play more consis
tently and are more experienced as a
team than the Bears.
