# Rivals come to de Guerre
## 
### Mark Smoyer Staff writer 
In recent years, the Stanford
water polo team has seemed all
but unbeatable. Indeed, the team
is the two-time defending NCAA
champion and went unbeaten last
season.
Now some observers are
speculating that the team, after
losing some key players from last
year's juggernaut, may be a bit
more vulnerable than usual,
despite the fact that it is ranked
No. I in the nation.
Just how vulnerable will be
revealed this weekend as the
team takes on three of the
country's top 10 teams on three
successive days.
loday, at 3:30 p.m. at
deGuerre pool, Stanford faccs
No. 3 UC-lrvine. Saturday, in its
first Pacific 10 Conference game,
the Cardinal meets fifth-rated
U( I.A at 10:30 a.m. The Cardi
nal finishes the marathon home
stand at noon Sunday against
No. 7 Pepperdine.
Already this season, the Cardi
nal has defeated each of these
teams once. These wins,
however, are not reasons for any
extra confidence, according to
Stanford Coach Dante Det
tamanti. "We could lose all three
games this weekend, Det
tamanti said.
"I don't think we're playing as
well as we can," he added.
"We're going to have to improve
to win the majority of our games
over the rest of the season. '
For a team that is 10-1, No. I
in the nation and has already
avenged its only loss of the
season — to No. 2 California —
improvement may seem unneces

sary. Many of the Cardinal's
games, however, have been
decided by one or two goals. And
this year's Pac-10, usually the
toughest conference in the na
•tion, is as competitive as it has
ever been.
I his afternoon, Irvine comes
to deGuerre with a potent offen
sive attack that forced Stanford
into overtime in the UC-lrvine
Invitational earlier this season.
The Cardinal prevailed 10-9.
The game promises to be espe
cially last-paced in the beginning,
when both teams will be looking
for the early lead.
Irvine is a quick-starting
team. I think they jumped out 2-0
on us last time,' Dettamanti
said. "It's important that we get
a good start against them."
In contrast to UC-lrvine's
evenly balanced offense, both
UCLA and Pepperdine have an
attack built around a few big
scorers.
Juniors Alex Rousseau and
Fernando Carsalade are the main
Bruin weapons. Rousseau was
named the best two-meter player
among world juniors (19 and un
der) after his performance at this
summer's World Junior Cham
pionships. Carsalade is a
seasoned veteran who played on
the IMN4 Brazilian Olympic team.
"We pretty much have to shut
down those two guys and take
advantage of their weaker
players," Dettamanti said.
"UCLA has the weakest goalie
they've had in a few years."
In this season of parity among
the top water polo teams, no one
team will dominate. Despite the
difference in ranking between
Stanford and Pepperdine. Sun
day's contest will in all likelihood

also be a close one.
The Waves are led by Sasha
Poljack and Rafael Gardarilla.
Aaron Jason, another Pepperdine
standout, has an injured hand
and may not play.
Entering today's game, senior
Erich Fischer is Stanford's
leading scorer with 25 goals.
Sophomore Eric Blum has 1!,
followed by juniors Andrew
Lawson and Jeff Oeding and
senior Matt Tingler, with 10
each.
In the goal, senior Obi Green
man continues to excel. His play
has ratified Dcttamanti's
preseason decision to redshirt
junior goalie Todd Kemp, a First
Team All-American last year.
1 he 1986 Stanford water polo
team is a hard act to follow. Each
starter for the 1986 C ardinal was
an All-American. Last season's
N( A A Player of the Year Craig
Klass, four-time Ail-American
David Imbernino, two-time Ail-
American Greg Gamble, All-
American Greg Ocasek, Chris
Thompson and 1987 redshirt
goalie Todd Kemp have all had to
be replaced this year,
"Stanford is the best team I've
ever seen play in my entire life,"
HC -Irvine Coach Ted Newland
said last Oct. 18. "They must be
the best team in the history of
water polo. I have never seen a
team with so much talent."
I he Cardinal, despite losing
those players, has drawn upon its
endless supply of talent and
remained No. I. Seniors Grant
Stanley, Bob Abbott, juniors
Andrew Lawson and Jeff Oeding
and sophomores Jon Swerdloff,
Erik Blum and Steve Milham
assume the positions of last
season's graduates.

The lop goalie recruit in the nation in I <>84, senior Obi Greenman has the position all to himself this ve»r for
the first time in his Stanford career. "He hasn't had hi.s own year to play without splitting time." senior
teammate Matt Tinkler said. **()hi has something to prove — that he is a great goalie."
