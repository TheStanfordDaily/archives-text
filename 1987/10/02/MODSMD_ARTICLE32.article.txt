# Men's soccer meets USF
## 
### Debbie Spander 
Coming off a narrow loss to Sacramento State,
the Stanford men's soccer team is looking to get
back to the .500 mark vs. the University of San
Francisco tomorrow.
The 3-4-2 Cardinal travels to Burlingame to face
the undefeated Dons in their first Pacific Soccer
Conference game of the year.
Although the Dons have shut out opponents in
six of nine games this season and are ranked in the
top three nationally, Stanford Coach Sam Koch
feels the Cardinal has a realistic chance of winning.
If Stanford can capitalize on USF's tendency to
over-commit up front by moving the ball quickly
into the coiners, Koch thinks the Cardinal will
have good scoring opportunities.
"USF has a tough defense. We have to hope for
a goal, because we haven't been taking our oppor
tunities very well this season," co-Captain Mike
Mossmer said. He added that he. too, thinks the
squad will be competetive tomorrow, as it is rated
one of the top three teams on the West Coast, with
USF and Fresno State.
Stanford will be battling USF's All-America
defender John Doyle, as well as Dons Coach Step
hen Negoesco, the NCAA's all-time winningest

coach. In his 26th season, Negoesco has 373 vic
tories, 61 losses and 40 ties.
The Cardinal currently carries a losing record but
has had an extremely tough schedule. By next
weekend the squad, which last year did not even
finish in the top 10 in the West, will have faced
seven top-20 teams, including Duke and North
Carolina State. In addition, Stanford has lost a
number of games in overtime.
Injuries have also plagued the team. Four
starters — midfielder Mossmer, midfielder/fullback
Kevin Woodhouse, standout sophomore forward
Chris Porch and fullback David Thorpe — have
missed all or part of the season, greatly debilitating
the Cardinal. Porch, however, is expected to be
ready for tomorrow's match.
Koch credits the improvement of the squad to
maturity and a hard-working offseason.
"Our overall play has improved. We are just
lacking consistency at the top level," he stated.
He is not planning any major changes in lineup or
strategy unless they are needed as the game
progresses.
"1 think we'll do well the next two games
(Fresno State follows USF), because the squad is
very anxious," Koch said.
