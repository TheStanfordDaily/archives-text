### Ed Pike 
The youthful Stanford men's
and women's cross country
teams will undergo a big quality
check tomorrow when they play
host to teams from across the na
tion in the Stanford Invitatjynal.
The meet begins at 9 a.m. at the
Stanford Golf Course.
The Cardinal women will at
tempt to capture their eighth con
secutive Stanford Invitational.
Their opposition includes Texas,
the 1986 NCAA champion. The
Cardinal men, who placed
second at the Stanford Invita
tional last year, will also face top
competition.
Although this season looks to
be a rebuilding year for the Car
dinal harriers, Stanford Coach
Brooks Johnson sees great po
tential in his young runners. Both
teams were winners at the
Meeting of the Minds in Chicago
Sept. 19, the first meet of the
season.
"We are talented and deep,
but young," Johnson said.

Sophomore Carol Gray, an
Ail-American in both cross
country and track and field last
year, leads the Cardinal women.
In addition, top freshmen re
cruits Wendy Neely. Jamie Fal
lon and Mary Mendoza are ex
pected to make an immediate im
pact.
Junior James Alborough is the
men's runner. Senior Steve
Sehadler, the Sacramento
brother duo of sophomores Eric
and Marc Mastalir and sopho
more Bill Crowley also figure to
be among the top finishers.
"We have a youth movement
going," Johnson said. "We have
to keep the pressure low and the
expectations high. Despite our
youth, I think both teams have
the potential to blossom this year
and qualify for nationals."
The competition begins with
the open competition at 9 a.m.
The Stanford women start the 5-
kilometer run at 10:30 a.m., with
the Cardinal men beginning the
lOK run at II a.m.
