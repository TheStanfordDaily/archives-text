# Card soccer hosts Westmont College
## 
### Robert Partington 
Spirits are high around the
Stanford women's soccer camp
this week. Coming off its first
win of the season, a 3-0 victory
over USC last Saturday, the 1-4-
2 Cardinal faces Westmont Col
lege at 10 a.m. tomorrow at
Maloney Field. The early starting
time is a change from the sched
uled 3 p.m. slot.
Tomorrow's game is Stan
ford's chance to prove it isn't a
weak sibling of California
women's soccer. In only the
women's soccer program's third
year of existence, the Cardinal
has several gifted young players
and a big win under its belt.
Nevertheless, problems exist.
Stanford must show it can
score. Through seven games, the
Cardinal has scored only six
goals. Three of them have been
by sophomore Tonya Antonucci.
Senior Amy Geisse, midfielder
Jenny Rowland and sophomore
Blair Elliott round out the goal
scoring club.
The players believe Stanford's
record is not reflective of the

team's ability. "We've played
several tough games, and we've
been in all of them. Antonucci
said.
Sophomore Vija Brookshire
will start at goalie for the Cardi
nal. Brookshire has been sharing
time in goal with Elise Edwards,
who has allowed only 1.12 goals
per game this season. Edwards,
however, has an injured ankle
and is doubtful for tomorrow's
contest.
There is certainly no dearth of
talent in the coaching position.
Stanford Coach Berhane An
deberhan, new to the Farm this
year, is already laying the
groundwork for a successful
women's soccer program. An
deberhan realizes, however, that
he isn't entering a well
established team.
"We want to use each game
this year to improve
everybody." Andeberhan said.
"We have a long way to go."
To facilitate improvement, An
deberhan has rotated his lineup
so that each player gets some
game time. The players appreci
ate his efforts. "Berhane is the
best you can get," Antonucci
said.
Westniont won't he a pushover
tomorrow. The Warriors feature
an experienced Sandra Asimos,
who played for Andeberhan's
Northern California Select Team
last summer. Westmont Coach
Karen Jennings is highly re
garded as both a coach and a
player. Jennings has played on
the U.S. national team.
Thus far Stanford fans have
turned out in unexpected num
bers for home games. "I have
been happily surprised by the
number of people who have
come out to games," Andeber
han said. "Even before school
started, there was a strong
showing."
It appears even the fans can
sense an upsurge in women's
soccer at Stanford.
