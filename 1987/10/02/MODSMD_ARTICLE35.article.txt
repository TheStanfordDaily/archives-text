# Field hockey faces league foe
## 
### Mark Anderegg 
As the football team looks for
its first win tomorrow against
UCLA, an often overlooked
group of Stanford athletes will
vie for its third consecutive con
ference victory.
Stanford's field hockey squad,
with a 5-3 record and a No. 5 na
tional ranking, is coming off of an
impressive 1-0 triumph over St.
Joseph's University and hosts
San Jose State tomorrow at 11
a.m. Prior to the victory over St.
Joseph's, Stanford had lost two
consecutive games, being shut
out by both Westchester State
College and Delaware. But those
losses didn't seem to bother
coach Sheryl Johnson.
"We played really well,"
Johnson said. "Although we won
one and lost two on our most
recent road trip, we lost to the
teams ranked second and third in
the country. 1 am very happy
with our performance."

San Jose State will give the
Cardinal some trouble in its quest
to remain undefeated in confer
ence play. The Spartans, who
battled California to a tie last
week, are presently ranked 20th
in the country. "They're always
a strong squad, and this year is
no different," said Johnson, who
anticipates a tough game. "We'll
have to work very hard."
The Cardinal certainly has the
ability to throttle San Jose's
potent offense. Center defender
Ami Chitwood, Stanford's lone
senior, and goalie Karen Jones
lead a defense which has given
up a mere 0.62 goals per game
thus far in 1987.
Johnson pinpointed Chitwood
as the real stabilizer of the team,
and her praise did not stop there.
"She's such a good defender
. . . she's so fast," Johnson said.
The coach concluded her anal
ysis by noting the difficulty of
Chitwood's position. "As center
defense, Ami generally contains

the other team's top scorer."
Stanford should also be able to
keep the pressure on offensively.
Despite being shut out three
times this year, the Cardinal of
fense has had some very strong
performances. Most notable was
a 3-0 thrashing of Pacific. Dana
Fleming. Stanford's leading
scorer, contributed two goals to
that victory.
Stanford is looking for a big
game to set the tone for the tough
part of its conference schedule.
Aside from the alumni game Oct.
7 and an invitational tournament
at Cal the following weekend, the
rest of the Cardinal's season is
filled with conference play. The
team is looking for its second
Northern Pacific championship.
Assuming the team is able to
perform well in this critical latter
part of the season, another
NCAA berth should also be
assured. It would be the third
consecutive invitation for the
Cardinal.
