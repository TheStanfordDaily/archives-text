# Elway on strike, Raczynski crosses picket line
## Greek back for pigskin prognostication 
### 
An invaluable guide for dorm
or office football pools, The
Stanford Daily Greek of the
Week returns for yet another
season of authoritative picks on
selected college football games.
This season's intrepid staff
features Daily sports editors
Matt Bodman and Robert
Portnoy, Card Today editors
Chris C rader and Evan Tuc
hinsky, returning veteran Chris
Halko and defending champion
Susan Slusser (who was 48-22 at
last count.)
Guest Greeks last year went an
impressive 41-29, led by Donald
Kennedy who correctly picked
seven of 10 games. Pretty good
for an amateur.
After a week of fruitlessly
trying to track down former Stan
ford quarterback John Elway to
ask him (beg him) to be the first
Guest Greek of the fall (what else

does he have to do right now?),
we finally called in back-up
Greek Steve Raczynski of the
Staaford Sports Information De
partment. Who better to provide
information on college football
picks than a sports information
director?
Raczynski, also known as
"Raz" and "Radar," is in his
sixth year at Stanford. The
Worcester, Mass. native also
served as sports information di
rector at Princeton, which ex
plains his daring pick of the
Tigers over Brown. "Because I
worked at Princeton, it's obvious
they're going to win," he ex
plained with infallible logic.
Along similar lines, Raczynski
chose Duke "because they're an
academic school." Stanford's
upset over UCLA will come
about, he says, because "we will
lull them to sleep."
