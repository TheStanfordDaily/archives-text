# Superconductor venture
## Profs, join hi-tech firm 
### Bobby Schrader 
Three top superconductor researchers at Stan
ford have begun a a new enterprise to tap the po
tentially lucrative market in superconductor
technology.
Profs. Malcolm Beasley and Theodore
Geballe and Assoc. Prof. Aharon Kapitulnik
all of the Applied Physics Department —
recently joined Conductus, the first May Area
superconductor development company.
Superconductors are materials that conduct
electricity with virtually perfect efficiency,
Geballe said. He said scientists, however, have
had difficulty in developing economically
feasible means of using superconductors since
the initial discovery of superconductivity by
Dutch physicist Kammerlig Onner in 1911.
Although a substantial amount of research is
being done on superconductor technology,
Geballe said, application of superconductors to
commercial needs is "at least a generation
away."
Geballe, however, compared the steady prog-

less in superconductor research to "having
money in the hank."
"It's nice to have choices," Geballe said.
"Superconductivity is likely to offer some nice
choices for the next generation."
Superconductivity is important not merely for
its revolutionary commercial applications it sug
gests, hut also for the new opportunity it offers
scientists to explore the nature of matter,
electricity and magnetism, he said.
The ability to conduct electricity without
resistance or to minimize heat dissipation in
electric motors and generators would greatly in
crease power efficiency.
Researchers envision resistance-free power
lines and computer chips packed to extremely
high densities with information.
Superconductor technology has already paved
the way for the development of one of the major
diagnostic breakthroughs in medicine — mag
netic resonance imaging. This method functions
much like X-ray radiography; however, not only
is it more efficient in terms of power consump
tion. it is also much safer, Geballe said.
