# Western Culture debate is stalled
## 
### Diane Bisgeier Senior staff writer 
University President Donald Kennedy
defended the Western Culture Program
Committee yesterday after members of
the Faculty Senate expressed concern
about the committee's progress in suggest
ing revisions of the Western Culture pro
gram.
"It's relatively easy ... to propose an
evaluation, but much more difficult for
others to carry out. I hope that the Senate
would be reasonable in its expectations."
Kennedy said at the first senate meeting of
the academic year.
Kennedy's statement followed an ex
change between Classics Prof. Marsh
McCall and Fnglish Prof. Ronald Rebholz,
in which Rebholz asked McCall why the
committee had not yet evaluated an expe
rimental Western Culture class offered
last spring, as it had had been mandated to
do by the Committee on Undergraduate
Studies (CUS).
"1 believe that there was no follow-up,
but I may be mistaken," McCall said.
In other business, the Faculty Senate
discussed retirement benefits for Univer
sity faculty and the formation of an inter
disciplinary program in immunology were
among the items discussed yesterday by
the Faculty Senate in its first meeting of
the academic year.
Kennedy outlined the University s posi
tion on retirement benefits for faculty, en
couraging professors to invest more dis
posable income into retirement accounts.
He noted that younger faculty are invest

ing less and less in retirement programs
and said he hoped to examine possibilities
for changes in the current program.
Currently, faculty participation in the
University's retirement plan, the Stanford
Contributory Program Contributory Pro
gram (SCRP), is strictly voluntary.
Kennedy told the senate of the Univer
sity's efforts to facilitate faculty saving by
encouraging a non-profit investment com
pany to allow for transferability of inves
tors' funds into other, alternative invest
ment programs.
According to Kennedy, transferability
would allow professors to invest in
"alternative vehicles" and might raise in
centives for retirement saving. "We can't
do this exclusively by regulation. We must
also encourage it through co-investment
on our part."
In a unanimous vote, the senate estab
lished a new program in immunology un
der the auspices of several departments in
the School of Medicine and the School of
Humanities and Sciences.
"Such a program is long overdue at
Stanford," said Biological Sciences Prof.
Patricia Jones, who submitted a proposal
for the interdepartmental program to the
Committee on Graduate Studies (CGS) in
April.
Jones explained that Stanford currently
has an immunology faculty of 22 profes
sors spread out over seven different de
partments.
