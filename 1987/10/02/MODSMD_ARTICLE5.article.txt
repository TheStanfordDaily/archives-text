# Western Culture debate is stalled
## 
### Diane Bisgeier Senior staff writer 
University President Donald Kennedy
defended the Western Culture Program
Committee yesterday after members of
the Faculty Senate expressed concern
about the committee's progress in suggest
ing revisions of the Western Culture pro
gram.
"It's relatively easy ... to propose an
evaluation, but much more difficult for
others to carry out. I hope that the Senate
would be reasonable in its expectations."
Kennedy said at the first senate meeting of
the academic year.
Kennedy's statement followed an ex
change between Classics Prof. Marsh
McCall and Fnglish Prof. Ronald Rebholz,
in which Rebholz asked McCall why the
committee had not yet evaluated an expe
rimental Western Culture class offered
last spring, as it had had been mandated to
do by the Committee on Undergraduate
Studies (CUS).
"1 believe that there was no follow-up,
but I may be mistaken," McCall said.
In other business, the Faculty Senate
discussed retirement benefits for Univer
sity faculty and the formation of an inter
disciplinary program in immunology were
among the items discussed yesterday by
the Faculty Senate in its first meeting of
the academic year.
Kennedy outlined the University s posi
tion on retirement benefits for faculty, en
couraging professors to invest more dis
posable income into retirement accounts.
He noted that younger faculty are invest

ing less and less in retirement programs
and said he hoped to examine possibilities
for changes in the current program.
Currently, faculty participation in the
University's retirement plan, the Stanford
Contributory Program Contributory Pro
gram (SCRP), is strictly voluntary.
Kennedy told the senate of the Univer
sity's efforts to facilitate faculty saving by
encouraging a non-profit investment com
pany to allow for transferability of inves
tors' funds into other, alternative invest
ment programs.
According to Kennedy, transferability
would allow professors to invest in
"alternative vehicles" and might raise in
centives for retirement saving. "We can't
do this exclusively by regulation. We must
also encourage it through co-investment
on our part."
In a unanimous vote, the senate estab
lished a new program in immunology un
der the auspices of several departments in
the School of Medicine and the School of
Humanities and Sciences.
"Such a program is long overdue at
Stanford," said Biological Sciences Prof.
Patricia Jones, who submitted a proposal
for the interdepartmental program to the
Committee on Graduate Studies (CGS) in
April.
Jones explained that Stanford currently
has an immunology faculty of 22 profes
sors spread out over seven different de
partments.
Chemistry Prof. John Brauman and
Economics Prof. Kenneth Arrow ex-
pressed concern that the creation
of interdisciplinary programs
might lead to a lack of structure
and organization, but Provost
James Rosse told them that "the
development of knowledge
doesn't always stay within organ
ized lines. We have a five-year
review process in place to ensure
that each program created fulfills
its objectives."
Kennedy also addressed con
cerns about the commercializa
tion of college athletics. He said
that Stanford's reliance on reve
nues from intercollegiate football

"is much more than we would
like, much more than any other
institution."
When Education Prof. Denis
Phillips brought up the question
of whether the University prefers
summer conferences on athletics
over academic ones, Kennedy
answered, "Academic confer
ences are always given prefer
ence. Any excess in revenue
from camps go to the Department
of Athletics, which is subject to
Stanford audits and NCAA regu
lations."
In the case of privately-run
camps, the coaches must rent the
space from the University, Ken
nedy said.
Another issue Rebholz brought
before McCall and the ( I S
regards a pending report of the

Task Force on Fraternities and
Sororities.
In a letter to the senate,
McCall wrote that. "CUS dis
cussed extensively . . . fraternity
issues affecting undergraduate
education at Stanford." Hut
McCall added that a report on the
matter is "still nonexistent".
Responding to statements that
Dean of Student Affairs James
Lyons had promised to have the
report completed by last year,
McCall said that he believed
Lyons" four-month medical leave
of absence prevented completion
of the report.
Oscar Serbein, a professor at
the Graduate School of Business,
confirmed that the report does in
fact exist, but has not been offi
cially classified.

Currently, faculty participation in the
University's retirement plan, the Stanford
Contributory Program Contributory Pro
gram (SCRP), is strictly voluntary.
Kennedy told the senate of the Univer
sity's efforts to facilitate faculty saving by
encouraging a non-profit investment com
pany to allow for transferability of inves
tors' funds into other, alternative invest
ment programs.
According to Kennedy, transferability
would allow professors to invest in
"alternative vehicles" and might raise in
centives for retirement saving. "We can't
do this exclusively by regulation. We must
also encourage it through co-investment
on our part."
In a unanimous vote, the senate estab
lished a new program in immunology un
der the auspices of several departments in
the School of Medicine and the School of
Humanities and Sciences.
"Such a program is long overdue at
Stanford," said Biological Sciences Prof.
Patricia Jones, who submitted a proposal
for the interdepartmental program to the
Committee on Graduate Studies (CGS) in
April.
Jones explained that Stanford currently
has an immunology faculty of 22 profes
sors spread out over seven different de
partments.
Chemistry Prof. John Brauman and
Economics Prof. Kenneth Arrow ex-
pressed concern that the creation
of interdisciplinary programs
might lead to a lack of structure
and organization, but Provost
James Rosse told them that "the
development of knowledge
doesn't always stay within organ
ized lines. We have a five-year
review process in place to ensure
that each program created fulfills
its objectives."
Kennedy also addressed con
cerns about the commercializa
tion of college athletics. He said
that Stanford's reliance on reve
nues from intercollegiate football

"is much more than we would
like, much more than any other
institution."
When Education Prof. Denis
Phillips brought up the question
of whether the University prefers
summer conferences on athletics
over academic ones, Kennedy
answered, "Academic confer
ences are always given prefer
ence. Any excess in revenue
from camps go to the Department
of Athletics, which is subject to
Stanford audits and NCAA regu
lations."
In the case of privately-run
camps, the coaches must rent the
space from the University, Ken
nedy said.
Another issue Rebholz brought
before McCall and the ( I S
regards a pending report of the

Task Force on Fraternities and
Sororities.
In a letter to the senate,
McCall wrote that. "CUS dis
cussed extensively . . . fraternity
issues affecting undergraduate
education at Stanford." Hut
McCall added that a report on the
matter is "still nonexistent".
Responding to statements that
Dean of Student Affairs James
Lyons had promised to have the
report completed by last year,
McCall said that he believed
Lyons" four-month medical leave
of absence prevented completion
of the report.
Oscar Serbein, a professor at
the Graduate School of Business,
confirmed that the report does in
fact exist, but has not been offi
cially classified.
University President Donald Kennedy
defended the Western Culture Program
Committee yesterday after members of
the Faculty Senate expressed concern
about the committee's progress in suggest
ing revisions of the Western Culture pro
gram.
"It's relatively easy ... to propose an
evaluation, but much more difficult for
others to carry out. I hope that the Senate
would be reasonable in its expectations."
Kennedy said at the first senate meeting of
the academic year.
Kennedy's statement followed an ex
change between Classics Prof. Marsh
McCall and Fnglish Prof. Ronald Rebholz,
in which Rebholz asked McCall why the
committee had not yet evaluated an expe
rimental Western Culture class offered
last spring, as it had had been mandated to
do by the Committee on Undergraduate
Studies (CUS).
"1 believe that there was no follow-up,
but I may be mistaken," McCall said.
In other business, the Faculty Senate
discussed retirement benefits for Univer
sity faculty and the formation of an inter
disciplinary program in immunology were
among the items discussed yesterday by
the Faculty Senate in its first meeting of
the academic year.
Kennedy outlined the University s posi
tion on retirement benefits for faculty, en
couraging professors to invest more dis
posable income into retirement accounts.
He noted that younger faculty are invest

ing less and less in retirement programs
and said he hoped to examine possibilities
for changes in the current program.
