The earthquake that rocked Los
Angeles yesterday was "moderate
. . . I(MH) times less intense in energy
than the earthquake" that
destroyed much of San Francisco
and Stanford, according to Anne
Kireniidjian, co-director of Stan
ford's John A. Blume Karthquake
Center.
An earthquake registering 6.1 on
the Richter scale, followed by nu
merous aftershocks, shook Southern
California early yesterday morning,
resulting in six confirmed fatalities,
dozens of injuries and significant
structural damage to buildings in I I
Monte, Montihello and Whittier.
Kiremidjian, also a professor of
civil engineering, said the damage
and number of casualties could have
been worse considering that the

earthquake occurred during rush
hour. "People responded well, in a
well-organized fashion," she said.
Stephen Hart/ell, a seismologist
with the U.S. Geological Survey in
Pasadena, said that no threat of
tremors stemming from the Los An
geles quake could be expected in this
area.
Civil Engineering Prof. Helmut
Kraw inkier, the other co-director of
the Blume center, rushed from
campus to the quake's epicenter east
of Los Angeles shortly after the
quake occurred, according to his
secretary, Jan Bailey.
"He left this morning as quickly
as possible as soon as he heard."
Bailey said.
krawinkler. who traveled with a
team of geologists from the U.S.
Geological Survey in Menlo Park,
was unavailable for comment yester

day. Kircmidjian said she expects to
hear a more complete report of the
incident from krawinkier today.
Anshel Schiff. a consulting profes
sor at the Blume center, will leave
for Southern California either today
or Monday with the Technical Coun
sel on Lifeline Earthquake Engineer
ing to survey damage to gas. power
and water lines in areas hit hard by
the quake.
Stanford students with family
members residing in the quake area
reacted quickly with phone calls
home, and discovered, for the most
part, minor damage. Bruce Rich
man. a Stanford graduate student
from Newport Beach who experi
enced the 1971 trembler in the San
Fernando Valley, said, "I don't
know how I would react to it now.
but it's bound to be scary."
Sophomore Athanasia Syrengelas

contacted her aunt in Whittier, who
reported only damaged furniture and
broken glass. But, having felt
smaller earthquakes in Southern
California, Syrengelas said. "The
worst thing about earthquakes is that
you are completely helpless. In this
one. 1 would be really scared.''
According to the measurement by
the U.S. Geological Survey's earth
quake information center in Golden,
Colo., the quake was the most se
vere in Southern California since the
1971 San Fernando Valley earth
quake. which measured 6.5 on the
Richter scale.
Along with the 17 aftershocks
above 3.0 that were detected by the
Geological Survey before 5 p.m., the
earthquake toppled several old brick
