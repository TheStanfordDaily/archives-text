Gorbachev hints at new arms pacts
MOSCOW — Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev, saying he ex
pected his coming summit meeting with President Reagan to
cause a "peaceful chain reaction" that could lead to a series of
arms agreements, yesterday proposed new talks between
NATO and the Warsaw Pact to curtail military activity in the
northern European seas.
Speaking in the Arctic port city of Murmansk, Gorbachev
said he saw "signs of improvement" in international affairs and
outlined his concept of a "military detente" encompassing the
Baltic, North, Greenland and Norwegian seas.
"Favorable trends are gaining in strength in interstate rela
tions," he said. "The substantive and frank East-West dialogue
... has become a characteristic trait of contemporary world
politics."
Gorbachev's optimistic assessment was his first public com
ment on the state of East-West relations since Washington and
Moscow reached an agreement in principle on a treaty to elimi
nate medium and shorter-range nuclear weapons more than two
weeks ago. Gorbachev, 56, returned from vacation late last
week and made his first public appearance in 52 days on Tues
day.
In his proposal, Gorbachev said the Soviet Union would con
sider removing nuclear-armed submarines from its Baltic fleet
and reviewing its nuclear testing range at Novaya Zemlya if dis
cussions proceed on the creation of a nuclear-free zone in the
region.
Two pivotal senators oppose Bork
WASHINGTON — The Supreme Court nomination of
Robert Bork moved to the edge of defeat yesterday as two key
senators — a closely watched moderate Republican and a
leading conservative Southern Democrat — announced their op
position to Bork.
But President Reagan, briefly answering questions at the end
of a day that included a flurry of White House strategy sessions
and Reagan's personal lobbying of a pivotal Democrat, insisted
that the nomination was still winnable. "I don't think that's
decided yet and I'm working my head off to make sure we don't
lose it,"he said.
"Frankly, I think it has been a disgraceful situation, because I
think the process of confirming a Supreme Court justice has
been reduced to a political, partisan struggle," Reagan said.
"The president is in the fight to the end," Sen. Strom Thur
mond (R-S.C.), vowed after meeting with Reagan. "Bork does
not want to withdraw." Sen. Alan Simpson (R-Wyo.K declared.
White House vote counters admitted, however, that the
losses have placed the nomination in severe jeopardy. "It's not
fatal," said veteran Republican lobbyist Tom Korologos, who
has been leading the pro-Bork lobbying effort in the Senate. But
he conceded that "there is a little wishful thinking" in current
pro-Bork tallies of support.
The announcements of opposition by Sens. J. Bennett
Johnston of Louisiana, a southern Democrat, and Arlen Specter
of Pennsylvania, a moderate Republican, were particularly
serious because each is a leading member of a bloc of votes
Bork needs to win.
Reagan suffers arms treaty setback
WASHINGTON — In a major victory for the arms control
lobby, the Senate for the first time expressed support yesterday
for a binding proposal that would force President Reagan to
abide by key elements of the unratified 1979 U.S.-Soviet SALT
2 treaty.
By a surprisingly decisive 55-44 vote, the Democratic
controlled chamber refused to set aside the proposal, authored
by Sen. Dale Bumpers (D-Ark.h which has long been one of the
perennial issues in the annual legislative battle over arms con
trol.
"I really believe that the size of the vote indicates that people
want to put a cap on this arms race," Bumpers said.
It was the second major setback for Reagan on arms control
issues since the Senate began debating a mammoth $303 billion
defense spending bill for fiscal 1988. Two weeks ago, the Senate
adopted an amendment that would require Reagan to abide by
the traditional interpretation of the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile
Treaty, which limits testing of the "Star Wars" missile defense
program.
Reagan's supporters reacted angrily to the vote on the second
strategic arms limitation treaty, branding it an ill-timed response
to the Soviet Union's test firing of a long-range missile at a loca
tion just 350 miles from Hawaii. One leading opponent, Sen.
John Warner (R-Va.), characterized it as nothing more than a
"thank-you note" to the Soviets for violating the treaty them
selves.
The SALT 2 pact, negotiated by President Carter, was never
brought up for a ratification vote in the Senate because of the
Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in 1979. Although Reagan con
demned it as "fatally flawed," he continued to abide by the
treaty until last year.
Gore urges end to mudslinging
WASHINGTON — Sen. Albert Gore Jr. (D-Tenn.) declaring
that other presidential candidates are feeding "negative tidbits"
about their opponents to the news media, called yesterday for
the Democratic presidential campaign to focus more on issues
facing the country and less on "relatively trivial" matters.
Striking a similar note, Senate Majority Leader Robert Byrd
(D-W.Va.), cautioning that constant negative campaign tactics
by his party's presidential candidates "will only bury the Demo
cratic Party," urged that contenders run campaigns that did not
"violate the American people's sense of fair play."
Both Democratic leaders warned about the course of their
party's presidential campaign after the two top officials of Mas
sachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis' campaign resigned following
the disclosure of their part in supplying the news media with an
"attack video" that set off a chain of events leading to Delaware
Sen. Joseph Biden Jr.'s withdrawal from the campaign. The
video documented that in one of his own speeches Biden had
used — without attribution — significant segments of a speech
by British Labor Party Leader Neil Kinnock.
Earlier, Sen. Gary Hart decided against running for the Dem
ocratic presidential nomination after the press published stories
suggesting that he had spent the night in his Washington
townhouse with Miami model Donna Rice.
Gore, in a lengthy breakfast session with the Los Angeles
Times Washington Bureau, suggested that news stories of
relatively trivial matters have obscured campaign dialogue
about important issues facing the country.
He also emphasized that he differed sharply with other Demo
cratic hopefuls in his more conservative approach to arms con
trol and vowed that he would deliver "a series of hard-hitting
messages on issues that involve differences between myself and
the other five candidates in the race."

In his proposal, Gorbachev said the Soviet Union would con

and reviewing its nuclear testing range at Novaya Zemlya if dis

region.
Two pivotal senators oppose Bork
WASHINGTON — The Supreme Court nomination of
Robert Bork moved to the edge of defeat yesterday as two key
senators — a closely watched moderate Republican and a
leading conservative Southern Democrat — announced their op
position to Bork.
But President Reagan, briefly answering questions at the end
of a day that included a flurry of White House strategy sessions
and Reagan's personal lobbying of a pivotal Democrat, insisted
that the nomination was still winnable. "I don't think that's
decided yet and I'm working my head off to make sure we don't
lose it,"he said.
"Frankly, I think it has been a disgraceful situation, because I
think the process of confirming a Supreme Court justice has
been reduced to a political, partisan struggle," Reagan said.
"The president is in the fight to the end," Sen. Strom Thur
mond (R-S.C.), vowed after meeting with Reagan. "Bork does
not want to withdraw." Sen. Alan Simpson (R-Wyo.K declared.
White House vote counters admitted, however, that the
losses have placed the nomination in severe jeopardy. "It's not
fatal," said veteran Republican lobbyist Tom Korologos, who
has been leading the pro-Bork lobbying effort in the Senate. But
he conceded that "there is a little wishful thinking" in current
pro-Bork tallies of support.
The announcements of opposition by Sens. J. Bennett
Johnston of Louisiana, a southern Democrat, and Arlen Specter
of Pennsylvania, a moderate Republican, were particularly
serious because each is a leading member of a bloc of votes
Bork needs to win.
Reagan suffers arms treaty setback
WASHINGTON — In a major victory for the arms control
lobby, the Senate for the first time expressed support yesterday
for a binding proposal that would force President Reagan to
abide by key elements of the unratified 1979 U.S.-Soviet SALT
2 treaty.
By a surprisingly decisive 55-44 vote, the Democratic
controlled chamber refused to set aside the proposal, authored
by Sen. Dale Bumpers (D-Ark.h which has long been one of the
perennial issues in the annual legislative battle over arms con
trol.
"I really believe that the size of the vote indicates that people
want to put a cap on this arms race," Bumpers said.
It was the second major setback for Reagan on arms control
issues since the Senate began debating a mammoth $303 billion
defense spending bill for fiscal 1988. Two weeks ago, the Senate
adopted an amendment that would require Reagan to abide by
the traditional interpretation of the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile
Treaty, which limits testing of the "Star Wars" missile defense
program.
Reagan's supporters reacted angrily to the vote on the second
strategic arms limitation treaty, branding it an ill-timed response
to the Soviet Union's test firing of a long-range missile at a loca
tion just 350 miles from Hawaii. One leading opponent, Sen.
John Warner (R-Va.), characterized it as nothing more than a
"thank-you note" to the Soviets for violating the treaty them
selves.
The SALT 2 pact, negotiated by President Carter, was never
brought up for a ratification vote in the Senate because of the
Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in 1979. Although Reagan con
demned it as "fatally flawed," he continued to abide by the
treaty until last year.
Gore urges end to mudslinging
WASHINGTON — Sen. Albert Gore Jr. (D-Tenn.) declaring
that other presidential candidates are feeding "negative tidbits"
about their opponents to the news media, called yesterday for
the Democratic presidential campaign to focus more on issues
facing the country and less on "relatively trivial" matters.
Striking a similar note, Senate Majority Leader Robert Byrd
(D-W.Va.), cautioning that constant negative campaign tactics
by his party's presidential candidates "will only bury the Demo
cratic Party," urged that contenders run campaigns that did not
"violate the American people's sense of fair play."
Both Democratic leaders warned about the course of their
party's presidential campaign after the two top officials of Mas
sachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis' campaign resigned following
the disclosure of their part in supplying the news media with an
"attack video" that set off a chain of events leading to Delaware
Sen. Joseph Biden Jr.'s withdrawal from the campaign. The
video documented that in one of his own speeches Biden had
used — without attribution — significant segments of a speech
by British Labor Party Leader Neil Kinnock.
Earlier, Sen. Gary Hart decided against running for the Dem
ocratic presidential nomination after the press published stories
suggesting that he had spent the night in his Washington
townhouse with Miami model Donna Rice.
Gore, in a lengthy breakfast session with the Los Angeles
Times Washington Bureau, suggested that news stories of
relatively trivial matters have obscured campaign dialogue
about important issues facing the country.
He also emphasized that he differed sharply with other Demo
cratic hopefuls in his more conservative approach to arms con
trol and vowed that he would deliver "a series of hard-hitting
messages on issues that involve differences between myself and
the other five candidates in the race."

Gorbachev hints at new arms pacts
MOSCOW — Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev, saying he ex
pected his coming summit meeting with President Reagan to
cause a "peaceful chain reaction" that could lead to a series of
arms agreements, yesterday proposed new talks between
NATO and the Warsaw Pact to curtail military activity in the
northern European seas.
Speaking in the Arctic port city of Murmansk, Gorbachev
said he saw "signs of improvement" in international affairs and
outlined his concept of a "military detente" encompassing the
Baltic, North, Greenland and Norwegian seas.
"Favorable trends are gaining in strength in interstate rela
tions," he said. "The substantive and frank East-West dialogue
... has become a characteristic trait of contemporary world
politics."
Gorbachev's optimistic assessment was his first public com
ment on the state of East-West relations since Washington and
Moscow reached an agreement in principle on a treaty to elimi
nate medium and shorter-range nuclear weapons more than two
weeks ago. Gorbachev, 56, returned from vacation late last
week and made his first public appearance in 52 days on Tues
day.
In his proposal, Gorbachev said the Soviet Union would con
