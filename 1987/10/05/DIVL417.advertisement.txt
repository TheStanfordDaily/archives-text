DEPARTMENT OF LINGUISTICS
LINGUISTICS 155: Multilittgualism
This course will examine in detail the phenomena of
multilingualism and language variation from an
international perspective. Major topics of discussion will
include: (1) multilingualism (what is it and how does it
come about, etc.); (2) language policy & planning
vis-a-vis education; and (3) language spread in
multilingual societies (e.g., how does language spread?
What factors crucially contribute to it and how does the
spread impact on language structure & language
planning?).
Data for the course will be drawn from African, Asian,
and Western languages (e.g., Swahili, Arabic, Lingala,
French, English, Hindi, Russian, Quechua, Creole
languages).
The course is open to undergraduate and graduate
students. For further information, contact Ms. Michelle
Assaf (Linguistics) at 725-1552.
