# Kennedy outlines goals, priorities
## Stresses Centennial, race issues 
### A.J. Thomas Editorial staff 
Predicting that the Centennial
fundraising campaign will
enable Stanford to establish a
"top-notch undergraduate col
lege," University President
Donald Kennedy called the
campaign his top priority for the
new academic year.
In a wide-ranging interview
Friday, Kennedy also ex
pressed optimism about the
chances of resolving the debate
over the Western Culture cur
riculum and said the University
has made a "deliberate and
purposeful" decision to empha
size combating racism this year.
He also said students can ex
pect to see more regulation of
drinking in Stanford Stadium.
Kennedy defended the Uni
versity's commitment to the
liberal arts in his discussion of
the Centennial Campaign's
goals. While Kennedy acknowl
edged that the largest target
items for the Centennial Cam
paign are the Near West
Campus scientific facilities, he
said the University is investing
more money in people.
When Centennial Professor
ships, humanities and sciences
funding and the new Commu
nity of Scholars program are
considered together, Kennedy
said, "we are putting much
more into people than into sci
ence and technology facilities."
Kennedy also said that Cen
tennial funds will eventually
enable the University to pro
vide housing for all undergradu
ates, although he did not
specify how soon that would be
possible.

Kennedy admitted that a new
administration emphasis this
year on awareness of racism
came in "deliberate response"
to the spring protests of the
minority groups making up the
Rainbow Agenda.
According to Kennedy, Ori
entation this year tried to stress
the importance of being open to
ethnic and cultural differences.
In his welcoming address to the
freshman class, Kennedy chal
lenged students to go beyond
passive tolerance and actively
fight racism.
Kennedy admitted that insti
tutional racism exists at Stan
ford "in the sense that most in
stitutions in society which have
been predominantly white and
have tried to do the things Stan
ford has tried to do . . . have
developed areas in which
awareness is not high."
Kennedy said he believed
there is "abundant room for
compromise" in the current
debate over changing the fresh
man Western Culture require
ment. The debate is currently
focused on the issue of how
much emphasis to place on the
influence of women and non-
Western cultures on the devel
opment of Western culture.
"I have always said I felt it
was possible to introduce a
great deal more into our West
ern Culture courses from these
areas," Kennedy said.
Kennedy said the current dis
cussion, conducted on a highly
abstract level by impasssioned
people, tends to come to an im
passe and "can only go on so
long."
However, "once teachers sit

down to work out the actual
curriculum, I think you will see
some real intellectual excite
ment."
Alcohol policy
On the subject of alcohol use
on campus, Kennedy noted that
"I don't think there's any ques
tion there is more drinking and
public display of drunkenness"
this year than in past years. Ik
said the practice of checking the
identification of people carrying

alcohol into the stadium will
continue but that he did not ex
pect such monitoring to extend
to other parts of campus.
"As a general rule, I regard
regulation as a last resort,"
Kennedy said, "but the issue in
the stadium is a complicated
one."
For one thing. Kennedy said,
the liability risk — always pres
ent because "not everyone who

paign, the Western Culture program and other campus issues Friday
drinks is a student" — is in
creased in the stadium because
there is a greater chance that
someone will be injured in a fight
or hit by a thrown object.
Kennedy said he is approach
ing the new academic year with
renewed enthusiasm for his job.
"Seeing another year begin
and the students come back, I
can say that I am as satisfyingly
and fully engaged in this place as
I ever have been," Kennedy
said.
Kennedy said community in
terest in his personal life follow
ing his separation last winter
produced "no change in my ap
petite for this job and, I think, no
change in my effectiveness in the
job."
Kennedy said there was
"never an iota of truth" to

speculation that his desire to
remain president was "shifting or
dissolving."
"I love this institution," Ken
nedy said. "I've been here over
20 years. I think I understand its
culture and values, and I like the
variety — I really like the stu
dents. I think it's the best job in
the world."
But Kennedy did not rule nut
the possihlity of someday leaving
the University for a position in
the public sector. "At my age,
one thinks about the possibility
of doing one more job. I have al
ways been open to that possibil
ity," Kennedy said.
But for the immediate future,
"my first obligation is to this
(Centennial) Campaign," he
said.
Edueation reform
Kennedy also discussed ways
that institutions like Stanford can
help improve high school educa
tion by elevating the social status

of the teaching profession.
Last month, Kennedy led 37
college and university presidents
and chancellors in drafting an
open letter to 3,3(K) college presi
dents urging them to "act to
gether as persistent and pas
sionate advocates for reform" in
education.
The seven-page letter recom
mended that university leaders
speak out for education and the
importance of teaching, take
steps to improve their own
schools of education, endeavor
to bring more minorities into
teaching and work with second
ary schools on areas of mutual in
terest.
Kennedy, the only representa
tive of a major research univer
sity among the 37 officials, said
his concern was both institu
tional and personal. Noting his
involvement with the Carnegie
Forum on Education and the
Economy, and with the Stanford
and the Schools program, Ken

nedy suggested ways that re
search universities, which train a
mere fraction of the nation's pri
mary and secondary teachers,
can contribute to improving the
quality of education and teach
ing.
"I believe we should be posi
tive about the influences higher
education can have on teacher
education and teacher certifica
tion," Kennedy said. "I have al
ways felt that universities should
assume an active, promoting,
catalytic role."
Among the assets Stanford has
to offer in this field is "the ex
pertise of a first-rate school of
education," Kennedy said. In
addition, he said Stanford will
work to encourage other re
search universities to work with
secondary schools, as Stanford
has done.
Finally, in the area of teacher
education, Kennedy looked to
Stanford's own master's level
teacher training program to in

crease minority representation in
the profession.
"I would love to be able to
demonstrate that STEP (the
Stanford Teacher Education Pro
gram) can attract more minority
teachers," Kennedy said.
On a related topic, Kennedy
said he had observed a decline in
the quality of California's public
high schools since the Proposi
tion 13 property tax reforms
forced large cuts in state funding
for public education.
Kennedy noted that although
Stanford has maintained a
"geographically blind" admis
sions policy, "the portion of Cal
ifornia students in the freshman
class has slipped steadily . . .
while there has been no change in
the number in the applicant
pool." Kennedy said this change
"reflects declining average prep
aration of the California public
schools."
"California is now tied with
Mississippi in per pupil expendi

tures on education," Kennedy
said.
Community relations
Kennedy also listed improving
community relations among his
prime goals for the year. "We
suffered a couple of rather
serious setbacks over the sum
mer with the Santa Clara County
Board of Supervisors," Kennedy
said.
In August, the supervisors
delayed approval of the Univer
sity's proposed Research Animal
Facility 11, a 27,000-square-foot
structure designed to house labo
ratory rats amd mice, after the
Palo Alto Humane Society
charged that potentially hazar
dous biogenetic research would
be conducted in the building.
Last week, the University
decided to file an environmental
impact report on a proposed ad
dition to a biology building after a
local protest group persuaded the
Santa Clara County Planning
Commission to postpone a
hearing on whether such a report
was needed.
"I'd like to stress once again
that biomedical research isn't en

gaged in because it's fun." Ken
nedy said.
"It's relatively easy for the
humane society to find people
who will say that our new facility
will release clouds of dangerous
recombinant DNA. The opposing
constituency is the children who
will be helped by medical
breakthroughs, and it's hard to
gather that constituency for a

board meeting," Kennedy
added.
He said Stanford wants "to be
a good neighbor," but also
stressed that the University has
"grave reservations about giving
up our summer to be an Olympic
village."
He said hosting large-scale
sporting events can be "a head
ache."
