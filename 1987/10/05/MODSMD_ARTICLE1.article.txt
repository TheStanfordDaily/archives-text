Predicting that the Centennial
fundraising campaign will
enable Stanford to establish a
"top-notch undergraduate col
lege," University President
Donald Kennedy called the
campaign his top priority for the
new academic year.
In a wide-ranging interview
Friday, Kennedy also ex
pressed optimism about the
chances of resolving the debate
over the Western Culture cur
riculum and said the University
has made a "deliberate and
purposeful" decision to empha
size combating racism this year.
He also said students can ex
pect to see more regulation of
drinking in Stanford Stadium.
Kennedy defended the Uni
versity's commitment to the
liberal arts in his discussion of
the Centennial Campaign's
goals. While Kennedy acknowl
edged that the largest target
items for the Centennial Cam
paign are the Near West
Campus scientific facilities, he
said the University is investing
more money in people.
When Centennial Professor
ships, humanities and sciences
funding and the new Commu
nity of Scholars program are
considered together, Kennedy
said, "we are putting much
more into people than into sci
ence and technology facilities."
Kennedy also said that Cen
tennial funds will eventually
enable the University to pro
vide housing for all undergradu
ates, although he did not
specify how soon that would be
possible.

Kennedy admitted that a new
administration emphasis this
year on awareness of racism
came in "deliberate response"
to the spring protests of the
minority groups making up the
Rainbow Agenda.
According to Kennedy, Ori
entation this year tried to stress
the importance of being open to
ethnic and cultural differences.
In his welcoming address to the
freshman class, Kennedy chal
lenged students to go beyond
passive tolerance and actively
fight racism.
Kennedy admitted that insti
tutional racism exists at Stan
ford "in the sense that most in
stitutions in society which have
been predominantly white and
have tried to do the things Stan
ford has tried to do . . . have
developed areas in which
awareness is not high."
Kennedy said he believed
there is "abundant room for
compromise" in the current
debate over changing the fresh
man Western Culture require
ment. The debate is currently
focused on the issue of how
much emphasis to place on the
influence of women and non-
Western cultures on the devel
opment of Western culture.
"I have always said I felt it
was possible to introduce a
great deal more into our West
ern Culture courses from these
areas," Kennedy said.
Kennedy said the current dis
cussion, conducted on a highly
abstract level by impasssioned
people, tends to come to an im
passe and "can only go on so
long."
However, "once teachers sit

down to work out the actual
curriculum, I think you will see
some real intellectual excite
ment."
Alcohol policy
On the subject of alcohol use
on campus, Kennedy noted that
"I don't think there's any ques
tion there is more drinking and
public display of drunkenness"
this year than in past years. Ik
said the practice of checking the
identification of people carrying

alcohol into the stadium will
continue but that he did not ex
pect such monitoring to extend
to other parts of campus.
"As a general rule, I regard
regulation as a last resort,"
Kennedy said, "but the issue in
the stadium is a complicated
one."
For one thing. Kennedy said,
the liability risk â€” always pres
ent because "not everyone who
