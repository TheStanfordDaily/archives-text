## Aftershock jolts Los Angeles 
### 
LOS ANGELES — A large aftershock
rolled through the Los Angeles basin before
dawn yesterday. It frightened already jittery
residents of hard-hit areas of the San Gabriel
Valley, sent scores of people to hospitals and
shelters and further damaged buildings
weakened by last Thursday's major earth
quake.
No deaths were reported from the after
shock, however, and there were no major
fires.
Disaster officials placed the epicenter of
yesterday's earthquake in the city of San
Gabriel, about eight miles east of downtown
Los Angeles and two miles northwest of the
epicenter of Thursday's temblor.
Yesterday's shaker was variously mea
sured at 5.3 and 5.5 on the Richter scale of
ground motion. That means it emitted be
tween 20 and 25 times less energy than
Thursday's quake, which was measured at
6.1, officials said.
But to some badly shaken San Gabriel Val
ley residents it seemed even worse."The
force was incredible," said Karen Shaw of
Rosemead, who was staying with her family
at a Red Cross shelter in nearby Alhambra
along with about 50 others left homeless by
Thursday's quake. "It was horrible. . . .
Imagine [all these] people in a dark room and

'Kaboom,' the whole room is going, things
are falling and people are scrambling and
screaming and yelling and hysterical."
Several heart attacks were reported on the
heels of the aftershock. At least one proved
fatal.
Disaster officials, meanwhile, released an
updated $108 million damage estimate from
Thursday's quake and said that number is
sure to rise when yesterday's damage is tab
ulated.
The most striking damage yesterday
occured in the city of San Gabriel, where a
bell tower crashed into the 1,500-seat Civic
Auditorium, causing at least $500,000 in
damage, city administrator Bob Clute said.
Clute said other damage in city was mainly
to brick walls and windows weakened by
Thursday's quake.
"Anything that was already weakened
went," he said.
That appeared to be the story throughout
Los Angeles County.
"It appears as though the aftershock . . .
caused some facilities that were already
damaged to be . . . damaged some more,"
said Ken Raske, assistant director of disaster
services for the county. "It doesn't appear
there is much fresh damage."
One new problem yesterday was apparent

however: A number of water mains ruptured.
The aftershock struck at 3:59 a.m. and was
felt as far away as San Diego. But damage
was concentrated in the already hard-hit
communities of the San Gabriel Valley.
In the city of Los Angeles, Police Del.
Dennis Tilton said no reports of serious
damage had reached his department.
In particularly hard-hit Whittier, however,
police cordoned off a large portion of the
city's badly damaged 24-square block Up
town Village business district for the second
time in less than a week.
Police had closed the district as a precau
tion after Thursday's quake. But late Friday
they reopened it and many business owners
had begun cleanups of their vulnerable old
unre-enforced brick and masonry structures.
Some had installed new windows only to
have their work undone by yesterday's
tremor, which littered streets once again with
shattered glass and bricks and tiles.
"The frustration level is on a little higher
level today," said Lane Langford, a book
store owner and president of the Whittier Up
town Association.
Local authorities reopened the area to the
public late Sunday but said that nearly half its
buildings remain unsafe.
