# GAO faults Reagan misdeeds
## 
### 
WASHINGTON â€” The
Reagan Administration relied on
"covert propaganda activities"
designed to influence the media
and the public to suppport its
Central American policies, ac
cording to a report by the con
gressional General Accounting
Office released yesterday.
The report said the State De
partment's Office of Public
Diplomacy for Latin America
and the Caribbean had violated a
congressional ban on the use of
taxpayers' money for unauth
orized publicity and propaganda
purposes in 1985. In a state
ment releasing the report, Rep.
Jack Brooks (D-Texas), chair
man of the House Government
Operations Committee, said that
"this illegal operation re
presented an important cog in the
administration's effort to manip
ulate public opinion and congres
sional action."
Rep. Dante Fascell (D-Fla.),
chairman of the House Foreign
Affairs Committee, said, "It

makes me wonder what else is
still being hidden from Congress
and the American people."
Attached to the GAO report is
a "confidential eyes only"
memorandum of March 13, 1985,
to Patrick Buchanan, then White
House communications director,
from Jonathan Miller, then an of
ficial of the State Department
Latin America public diplomacy
unit, boasting of its "white
propaganda" operations. Later
Miller became a White House ad
ministrative aide and resigned
this May after it was revealed
that he had cashed travelers
checks from Lt. Col. Oliver
North's National Security Coun
cil safe for payment to a contra
leader.
In a related development,
President Reagan prepared to in
augurate a new phase of his cam
paign to continue U.S. aid to the
Nicaraguan Contras in a speech
Wednesday, demanding addi
tional actions by Nicaragua to
change its internal policies and

meet U.S. national security con
cerns, White House sources said
yesterday.
Reagan's speech to the Organi
zation of American States, fol
lowed by an address by Secre
tary of State George Shultz in
Chicago Friday, was described
as the kickoff of a month-long
drive that will culminate in a re
quest to Congress shortly after
Nov. 7 for additional Contra aid.
The administration's efforts to
continue Contra aid have been
complicated by Nicaraguan gov
ernment acceptance of a Central
American peace agreement call
ing for major policy shifts, in
cluding greater political freedoms
and other reforms, by Nov. 7.
The New York Times reported
yesterday that the White House
has settled on a list of demands to
be made of the Nicaraguan gov
ernment that go beyond the
Central American peace agree
ment. The Times said these
demands include new presiden
tial elections, an end to Soviet

and Cuban military aid, negotia
tion of a Nicaraguan cease-fire
directly or indirectly with the
Contras, full amnesty for the
Contras, release of all
Nicaraguan political prisoners
and sharp reduction in the size of
the Nicaraguan armed forces.
A White House official con
firmed that these points have
been under discussion in the ex
ecutive branch, hut said it is un
certain whether Reagan will spell
them out in his OAS address
Wednesday.
Nicaragua's ambassador to the
United States, Carlos Tunner
mann, said Sunday that "it is not
up to the government of the
United States to take upon itself
the right to tell the presidents of
the Central American countries
to add to the Guatemala ac
cords." Tunnermann said
Nicaragua would refuse to
change the timing of its next
presidential elections, which are
scheduled for 1990 under the
country's constitution.
