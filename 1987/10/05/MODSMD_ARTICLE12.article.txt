# Bio Prof. wins teaching prize

### Elizabeth Chang 
Associate Biology Prof. Patricia
Jones has become the first winner of
the Hoagland Prize for Undergraduate
Teaching, which was awarded at the
fourth annual Junior convocation
Friday.
The prize, which includes a quarter
of paid release time, is designed to give
Stanford faculty members who excel in
undergraduate teaching "an opportu
nity to pursue new directions in teach
ing that will benefit Stanford under
graduates on a continuing basis," ac
cording to Dean of Undergraduate
Studies Thomas Wasow, who pre
sented the award.
According to Hllen Woods, special
assistant to the dean, the Hoagland
prize is distinguished from other Uni
versity awards for outstanding teaching
by the fact that it is awarded specifi
cally for the teaching of undergradu
ates.
Wasow said that Jones was de
scribed by some of her students as
being "tough, very tough â€” but as
tough in standards for her own teaching
as about the results of student effort."
Jones was selected from over 50 candi
dates nominated by students and fac
ulty, according to Charlie Junkerman,

assistant to the dean.
Jones was unaware that she had been
selected to receive the Prize and, thus,
following the ceremony was unable to
provide specific details about her plans
for the future. She said, however, that
she is interested in developing a pro
gram to promote more independent re
search and small group interaction be
tween faculty and students.
Jones was instrumental in the forma
tion of the Biology for Humanists
course and has been an active sponsor
of the Women in Science and Engineer
ing program.
The prize was established by
Laurance and Naomi Carpenter
Hoagland in in appreciation of the un
dergraduate education their family
received at Stanford.
In the tradition established last year,
the convocation's two-part keynote ad
dress was delivered by two generations
of the same family, who both presented
their perspectives of scholarly en
deavor.
Albert Hastorf, professor of psychol
ogy and Benjamin Scott Crocker pro
fessor of human biology and his
daughter, Christine Hastorf, assistant
professor of anthropology at the Uni
versity of Minnesota, both emphasized

that juniors need not have a life plan to
succeed after graduating.
The elder Hastorf offered an account
of his academic and post-collegiate en
deavors, beginning with his childhood
in New Jersey and ending with his
graduate work at Princeton University.
The younger Hastorf dealt mainly
with her indecisive and anxiety-filled
junior year at Stanford, "an ivory
tower which didn't seem to be much of
an experiment in real life, nor was it
answering questions about which di
rection we should take with our lives."
She ended with a few words of ad
vice for the class of 1989: "You must
follow your own crazy first passionate
interests which will probably never let
you down."
In addition to the faculty proces
sional, the convocation also featured
performances by three members of the
class of 1989. Sarah Liu read some of
her original poetry to the audience, and
Laurel Roberts and Sally Smith played
a piano duet.
Dean Wasow emphasized the differ
ence between the first and second
halves of the undergraduate career and
encouraged juniors to take initiatives
during their remaining years at Stan
ford.
