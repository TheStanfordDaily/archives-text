If all goes according to plan, Stanford may
soon begin building several new art studios in
the Foothills near the Dish. Were this to happen,
it would set an unfortunate precedent for future
expansion into one of Stanford's most precious
natural resources.
The Foothills have been cherished by genera
tions of Stanford students, faculty and staff as an
area of great natural beauty, a place for quiet re
flection and outdoor exercise free of noise and
traffic.
And while art professors may desire studios in
the Foothills for just this beauty and quietude, so
might professors and researchers from many
other departments. To accede to the Art Depart
ment's desires would in the future necessitate
equal consideration of other departments' plans
for expansion there.
Construction of art studios in the Foothills
may eventually lead to an acceleration of devel
opment in the area. If such development is
allowed to continue, the Foothills may, in time,
come to resemble a patchwork subdivision of
studios, laboratories and offices. This would be
a tragedy.

No less disturbing is the fact that the architec
tural firm hired to design the studios is the very
same company that designed such well-known
campus embarrassments as Tresidder Union and
Wilbur and Stern Halls.
The wisdom of the University's choice of ar
chitects seems questionable, especially in light
of the proposed studios' sensitive location.
There are many other locations on campus
that would be suitable for art studios. Let Stan
ford utilize this land rather than despoil its Foot
hills.
In light of the issues raised by last year's con
troversy over the Reagan Library, Stanford
would be well-served to pause in its haste to ex
pand into the Foothills. Rather than rushing to
"use"' that special land, those in decision
making positions should stop to enjoy it.
Were they to do so, they might recognize the
unfortunate implications of building in the Foot
hills, be it art studios or laboratories or presiden
tial libraries.
The Foothills are virtually free of buildings; let
them stay that way, for present and future
generations to enjoy.
