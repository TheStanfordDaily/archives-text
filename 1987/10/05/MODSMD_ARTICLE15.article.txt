# The 						road to modern adulthood
## 
### 
A friend of mine was arrested last Satur
day. He had been partying at the Theta Delts,
and when he stepped out to leave he was still
carrying a beer can. A lurking police officer
demanded to see some identification and
when my friend explained he was under 21,
he was charged with underage drinking and
not-so-cordially invited to meet the judge.
So, in a few weeks my friend will have to ex
plain to this judge how it was that he dared
drink at such a young and supposedly imma
ture age.

Despite what you may think, this column is
not about the fairness of the alcohol laws. At
one point or another, almost everyone airs
his views on when, if ever, people should he
allowed to drink. This column is about other,
more subtle, expectations that go along with
age — ones that are rarely discussed and are
usually accepted without the realization that
they are being accepted.
For many of us, the first twenty to thirty
years of our lives were mapped out from
birth. Our parents hoped we would go
through a long succession of school —
elementary school, middle school, high
school, college and probably some form of
graduate school — and then graduate into a
good job. It wasn't long before we, too, came
to accept this as our life plan.
The problem is that along with the plan for
a good education comes the implication that
we aren't real people until we're done with
these many years of school. This attitude has
spread through our society in the past twenty
years, and now it often seems that if you
don't have a college degree you might as well
be illiterate: How many of us spent our sum

mers doing mindless jobs because we hadn't
graduated yet? And worse, even once you get
your degree it's often only good enough for
an entry-level job; modern thinking says that
really responsible jobs require people with
graduate degrees.
This is obviously ridiculous. In earlier eras
the average life expectancy was 35. Marriage
was at 14; you were a fully functioning mem
ber of society at 13. And while there's no
doubt that life has grown a little more compli
cated since those days, this is no reason to
consider people half-people until they're 25.
The real tragedy isn't that we're thought in
competent when we really aren't. The
tragedy is that over time we begin to accept
that we really aren't capable, that we're
really too young to accomplish anything.
Even here, where six thousand of the
country's most promising undergraduates are
gathered, how many of us really believe we
can do anything of value? Most of us don't.
Yet, in some ways, we're more capable now
that we'll ever be again: We have tremendous
enthusiasm. We have good health; we're free
from the pressures of raising a family; and
our ideals haven't been shattered by the
cynicism of bad experience. It makes you
wonder: How many great achievements have
been lost to mankind because potential ach
ievers were led to believe that they weren't
educated enough yet, that they should wait
on their pet projects in favor of their more im
portant school work?
It's well-known that people rise to chal
lenge, yet all that's expected of us is to do
wel! on next week's midterm or get that five
pager in on time. But think about it: Steve
Jobs and Steve Wozniak founded Apple at
little over 20, Mark Twain and William
Shakespeare started writing at 18, and
Einstein did poorly all through his formal ed
ucation because he was too busy with his
own ideas. Granted, these are exceptional
people, but so is everyone here. The differ
ence between us and them is that they had the
guts to believe in themselves and to get on
with their interests, while most of us expect
no more of ourselves than to get through
today's chemistry class.

If college really was the four-year vacation
before the real world that people make it out
to be, these things might not be so bad. But
let's face it, whoever first made that oft-heard
comparison wasn't describing college
classes. For all too many of us, classes are a
pain in the butt, and that's a shame because
most of us really do have serious interests.
Instead of pursuing them, though, most of us
end up having to worry about fulfilling major
requirement No. 15 or distribution require
ment No. 8.
Listen in on a class the day a research
report is due: Students will say they came
across some intriguing stuff, but since it
didn't really have anything to do with the as
signment, they didn't have time to pay much
attention. And this is the great education we
all pay so much for? Doesn't it stand to rea
son that the real potential for us to be useful
(and happy) members of society lies with the
material we're naturally interested in? Why,
then, do we spend so little time following up
on our interests and so much on getting an
"education?"
And don't tell me that we need an educa
tion to have open minds. Humans are born
with open minds. If anything, hours and
hours of classes and tons of forced reading
promote an anti-intellectual atmosphere. If
you tell someone here that you went to the li
brary for fun, they look at you as if you were
crazy. That's because they're so tired from
doing stuff they are only semi-interested in
that they forget how much fun learning really
is.
The truth is, if we all took the effort we
were putting into our classroom educations
and instead used it to follow up our own
varied interests, we'd accomplish a lot more,
have a better time doing it and feel more ful
filled as individuals. In the long run, we'd
also have a better attitude towards learning,
which over time would help us become more
well-rounded human beings.
I was going to try to find some solutions to
this problem, but I have some classwork to
do . . .

graduated yet? And worse, even once you get
your degree it's often only good enough for
an entry-level job; modern thinking says that
really responsible jobs require people with
graduate degrees.
This is obviously ridiculous. In earlier eras
the average life expectancy was 35. Marriage
was at 14; you were a fully functioning mem
ber of society at 13. And while there's no
doubt that life has grown a little more compli
cated since those days, this is no reason to
consider people half-people until they're 25.
The real tragedy isn't that we're thought in
competent when we really aren't. The
tragedy is that over time we begin to accept
that we really aren't capable, that we're
really too young to accomplish anything.
Even here, where six thousand of the
country's most promising undergraduates are
gathered, how many of us really believe we
can do anything of value? Most of us don't.
Yet, in some ways, we're more capable now
that we'll ever be again: We have tremendous
enthusiasm. We have good health; we're free
from the pressures of raising a family; and
our ideals haven't been shattered by the
cynicism of bad experience. It makes you
wonder: How many great achievements have
been lost to mankind because potential ach
ievers were led to believe that they weren't
educated enough yet, that they should wait
on their pet projects in favor of their more im
portant school work?
It's well-known that people rise to chal
lenge, yet all that's expected of us is to do
wel! on next week's midterm or get that five
pager in on time. But think about it: Steve
Jobs and Steve Wozniak founded Apple at
little over 20, Mark Twain and William
Shakespeare started writing at 18, and
Einstein did poorly all through his formal ed
ucation because he was too busy with his
own ideas. Granted, these are exceptional
people, but so is everyone here. The differ
ence between us and them is that they had the
guts to believe in themselves and to get on
with their interests, while most of us expect
no more of ourselves than to get through
today's chemistry class.

If college really was the four-year vacation
before the real world that people make it out
to be, these things might not be so bad. But
let's face it, whoever first made that oft-heard
comparison wasn't describing college
classes. For all too many of us, classes are a
pain in the butt, and that's a shame because
most of us really do have serious interests.
Instead of pursuing them, though, most of us
end up having to worry about fulfilling major
requirement No. 15 or distribution require
ment No. 8.
Listen in on a class the day a research
report is due: Students will say they came
across some intriguing stuff, but since it
didn't really have anything to do with the as
signment, they didn't have time to pay much
attention. And this is the great education we
all pay so much for? Doesn't it stand to rea
son that the real potential for us to be useful
(and happy) members of society lies with the
material we're naturally interested in? Why,
then, do we spend so little time following up
on our interests and so much on getting an
"education?"
And don't tell me that we need an educa
tion to have open minds. Humans are born
with open minds. If anything, hours and
hours of classes and tons of forced reading
promote an anti-intellectual atmosphere. If
you tell someone here that you went to the li
brary for fun, they look at you as if you were
crazy. That's because they're so tired from
doing stuff they are only semi-interested in
that they forget how much fun learning really
is.
The truth is, if we all took the effort we
were putting into our classroom educations
and instead used it to follow up our own
varied interests, we'd accomplish a lot more,
have a better time doing it and feel more ful
filled as individuals. In the long run, we'd
also have a better attitude towards learning,
which over time would help us become more
well-rounded human beings.
I was going to try to find some solutions to
this problem, but I have some classwork to
do . . .

A friend of mine was arrested last Satur
day. He had been partying at the Theta Delts,
and when he stepped out to leave he was still
carrying a beer can. A lurking police officer
demanded to see some identification and
when my friend explained he was under 21,
he was charged with underage drinking and
not-so-cordially invited to meet the judge.
So, in a few weeks my friend will have to ex
plain to this judge how it was that he dared
drink at such a young and supposedly imma
ture age.

Despite what you may think, this column is
not about the fairness of the alcohol laws. At
one point or another, almost everyone airs
his views on when, if ever, people should he
allowed to drink. This column is about other,
more subtle, expectations that go along with
age — ones that are rarely discussed and are
usually accepted without the realization that
they are being accepted.
For many of us, the first twenty to thirty
years of our lives were mapped out from
birth. Our parents hoped we would go
through a long succession of school —
elementary school, middle school, high
school, college and probably some form of
graduate school — and then graduate into a
good job. It wasn't long before we, too, came
to accept this as our life plan.
The problem is that along with the plan for
a good education comes the implication that
we aren't real people until we're done with
these many years of school. This attitude has
spread through our society in the past twenty
years, and now it often seems that if you
don't have a college degree you might as well
be illiterate: How many of us spent our sum

mers doing mindless jobs because we hadn't
graduated yet? And worse, even once you get
your degree it's often only good enough for
an entry-level job; modern thinking says that
really responsible jobs require people with
