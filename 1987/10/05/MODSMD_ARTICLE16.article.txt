## Pursue interests, not education 
### 
Science and technology are so
highly revered and the educa
tional requirements so rigorous
that one might wonder what is
the value of studying the
humanities. To excel in a scien
tific or technological field re
quires a depth of knowledge that
seems to preclude acquiring a
breadth of knowledge. In the
grand scheme of human history,
this is a very recent phenome
non.

Peter Lilienthal

Throughout most of recorded
history, the prevailing ethos
called for mankind to accept the
state of nature and his role in it.
Starting with the Renaissance,
man began to believe that he
could change his environment
and harness nature for his
purposes.
It could be argued that this
process began with the Agricul
tural Revolution thousands of
years earlier. However, after
laying dormant during the Dark
Ages, the growth of technology
accelerated once it was un
leashed by the Renaissance. The
important figures of that time,
such as Leonardo Da Vinci, have

been called Renaissance men,
and the term is used to describe
the breadth of their knowledge.
In today's world, where it is
not possible to achieve the kind
of breadth of a Da Vinci, the ten
dency is to specialize as much as
possible. To some extent this is
unavoidable. But if a broad range
of knowledge was so valuable to
igniting the cultural revolution of
the last five hundred years, it is
worth asking what we are losing
when we become a culture of
specialists. Because the study of
humanities has little monetary
payoff many students sacrifice
acquiring the breadth of knowl
edge that has until recently been
the hallmark of an educated per
son.
The Greek tragedies were writ
ten over 2000 years ago. Except
for the person who is interested
in history for its own sake, does
anyone really need to study these
ancient writings? Can a hard
core techie learn anything from
them?
One of the recurring themes of
the Greek tragedies is the con
cept of hubris. This is a special
kind of arrogance where a mortal
man assumes for himself the
qualities reserved for the deities.
The tragedies are a kind of
morality plan in which the
protagonist suffers greatly as a

result of his hubris. The moral is
clear: One should maintain
enough humility to recognize the
differences between reasonable
human capabilities and the
divine.
The concept of divinity has
changed substantially since anti
quity, but the lessons of hubris
are strangely relevant. Unlike the
ancient gods, who had faults, one
of the most significant character
istics of the modern monotheistic
god is perfection.
Without delving in great detail
into a theological argument, it
can be argued that a belief in
one's own perfection is an excel
lent example of hubris in the
modern world.
This is also true of belief in the
perfection of any human crea
tion. If an engineer were to be
lieve that he had created a per
fect machine, that would be
hubris, and that arrogance could
be expected to cause suffering,
just as in the ancient tragedies.
The cost of hubris is worth
remembering in today's complex
and interdependent technological
world. We hear talk with increas
ing frequency of fail-safe systems
â€” perfect systems in which the
probability of failure is
presumably zero, and the costs
of a failure are therefore not
worth considering. This is the

mindset of the nuclear industry.
Blind faith in technology and
its underlying arrogance led to
the entire nation being shocked
by the Challenger accident, even
though space travel is one of the
most inherently risky endeavors
imaginable. In that case, the cost
of failure was seven lives and a
large amount of money. What
would the cost of failure be for
other supposedly perfect tech
nologies? If the Strategic
Defence Initiative (Star Wars)
has any strategic value, we will
come to rely on it.
Have the proponents of SDI
really considered what the cost
of failure would be? The world
might be a much safer place if
everyone (especially the techno
logical optimists) were to read
the ancient tragedies, rather than
force the rest of us to live one.
