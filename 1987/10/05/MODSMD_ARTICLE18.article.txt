Music Dept. cuts
The cuts in University funding
for the Department of Music,
cuts which have forced the
"elimination of beginning guitar
classes and significantly reduced
the number of beginning piano
and beginning flute classes for
non-majors," continues a sad
trend in Stanford's commitment
to liberal undergraduate educa
tion.
It is not coincidental that the
Music Department cuts occur
during a period when many un
dergraduates are concerned, if
not cynical, over the allocation of
Centennial Campaign funds;
when many humanities majors
feel increasingly disgruntled over

class quality and question the
University's commitment to their
education; or during a period of
rising pre-professionalism, of
which Stanford is very much a
part.
Perhaps we might cut research
funds for the Department of
Physics, the Medical School, the
Graduate School of Business or
the School of Engineering or
reduce the number of introduc
tory calculus classes. We should
view the administration's reac
tion to such cuts and then draw
conclusions as to the nature of
the education we receive here
and the University's commit
ment to our development.
