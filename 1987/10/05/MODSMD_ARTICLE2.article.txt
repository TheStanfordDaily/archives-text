# Law students protest AIDS policy
## 
### Bob Michitarian Editorial staff 
In a tense confrontation Friday, Law
School students questioned representatives
of an international law firm interviewing job
applicants here about the firm's alleged dis
criminatory firing of an employee with AIDS.
The Law School's decision to allow
Chicago-based Baker & McKenzie on
campus raised questions about the implemen
tation of the Law School's policy of not al
lowing firms that discriminate to interview
here.
About 60 students crowded a Law School
classroom for the lunchtime meeting, hastily

arranged by the law student Muticultural
Council, a coalition of ethnic minority,
women's, lesbian and gay groups.
The coalition s concerns stem from a suit
reported in May's National Law Review
brought by one of Baker & McKenzie's New
York associates, Geoffrey Bowers, who says
the firm violated that state's human rights law
and fired him because he has AIDS.
Law School administrators were on hand
to explain their decision to allow the firm to
conduct interviews. The Law School decided
to allow Baker & McKenzie to conduct inter
views Friday because "there were charges
made — not charges proven," according to
lom Mcßride, associate dean of Administra

tion at the Law School.
Mcßride further defended the Law
School's laissez-faire position by saying that
the school had made information about the
charges available to students at the earliest
possible moment.
But coalition members were unsatisfied
that the firm was not banned from campus
when the charges came to light. Student rep
resentatives charged that the incident was an
example of the school's "disregard for the
spirit" of the anti-discrimination policy.
"I was totally outraged when I read the
(National Law Review) article and am totally
outraged that this firm is inter
viewing here," said Michael
Adams, a coalition member and
co-chair of the Gay and Lesbian
Law Students' Association.
According to Adams, most dis
crimination cases are settled out
of court. To wait for a court deci
sion to implement the policy is
unrealistic, Adams said, and
"takes the teeth out of the
policy."

"We have a law firm right
here, right now, interviewing all
day, that does discriminate on
the basis of sexual orientation
and disability," Adams said.
Company representative Mi
chael Meznik, however,
reiterated that the case had not
yet been decided and argued
that, considering Baker &
McKenzie's multinationalism,
the company is "doing OK" in
avoiding discriminatory policies.
The firm's record might not be
up to "U.S. standards," he said,
"but we are a different animal.
We march under a multitude of

Hags." .
Adams countered, saying l
don't care what kind of different
animal or what kind of cultural
sensitivity they say they sho w *
They showed no sensitivity
toward this man." Adams
charged that the firm had "used
AIDS as a weapon."
The coalition urged students
who had signed up to interview
with the firm to cancel their ap
pointments or to use the
meetings to raise questions about
the AIDS case. More than half of
the 55-60 on the sign up lists
crossed their names off.
