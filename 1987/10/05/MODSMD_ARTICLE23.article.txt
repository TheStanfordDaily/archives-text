## Development remains controversial History of growth still alive

This is the first in a scries on the
growth of Stanford. The next install
ment will appear two weeks from
today.

The architecture of Stanford Uni
versity has come a long way from
the pastoral ideal that its original
designers planned for it.
Architects in 1885 envisioned that
the future Stanford University
would he built on the Knoll, the hill
on which the Music Annex now
stands. Also, if the planners' vision
had been followed, winding roads
and paths, rather than the arcades of
today's formal Quadrangle, would
have connected the University's
well-spaced buildings.

Research by Art History Prof.
Paul Turner has revealed that the
development of the University has
been controversial since its earliest
days.
Today, disputes about the ar
chitectural development of the Uni
versity often arise over the issue of
the Foothills. Many were relieved,
for example, that further develop
ment was kept out of the Foothills
last year when construction of the
Reagan Library was cancelled.

The Board of Trustees will vote
tomorrow on a plan to install a S(XM)
square-foot studio in the Foothills
for faculty and graduate students in
the art department.
These are, however, only the
most recent conflicts over Stan
ford's development.
According to Turner, the first land
planning dispute at Stanford arose
between Leland Stanford, Sr. and
Frederick Law Olmsted, the
landscape architect Stanford com
missioned for $I(),(K)() to design his
university.
Olmsted, known as "the father of
American landscape architecture,"
is perhaps most famous for his
desiun of Central Park in New York

In the late IXIMIs, Stanford architects envisioned that the University's original quadrangle would eventually be sur
rounded by up to six peripheral quadrangles.
City. His first college campus
plan was for UC-Berkeley and its
surrounding community.
Turner's book, "The Founders
and the Architects," quotes
Olmsted describing his Berkeley
design as "picturesque, rather
than a formal and perfectly sym
metrical arrangement."
Although Olmsted's early
design for Stanford incorporated
similar ideas, it was his first sym
metrical plan.
His first sketch, dated Sept.
26, 1886, shows Stanford as a
semicircular set of buildings. It
would have included plantings of
trees and a botanical garden
downslope from the University,
which was to be located in the
Foothills near the Knoll.
Later plans indicate that
Olmsted would have planted the
Foothills with trees to form an ar
tificial forest called the
"arboretum."
Senator Stanford, however,
wanted the University to be a
formal and imposing memorial to
his son, Leland Stanford, Jr.,
who died of typhoid fever at 15.
Rejecting Omstead's informal
plans, Stanford chose a design,
reminiscent of 17th century
Baroque palaces in Spain and the
South of France, that he thought
would be an imposing monument
to his son's memory.
Turner called the final design
of Stanford University, "formal

and monumental to a degree
never before seen in American
college planning," though it did
incorporate some elements of
Olmsted's informal design.
The University's Quadrangle
design, for example, was meant
to bring Old World culture to the
uncivilized American republic,
Turner wrote.
Although the inspiration for
the design was European,
Senator Stanford wanted his uni
versity to be "distinctly Califor
nian in character." As a result,
the architecture of the central
Quadrangle resembles that of the
California Missions.
Olmsted, who was not pleased
with the final plans for the Uni
versity, offered a compromise
plan that would have turned the
Quad ninety degrees from its
present angle so that Memorial
Church would be placed asym
metrically to the side of the
Quad. This perspective would
have allowed for a broad vista
into the foothills behind the Uni
versity.
Senator Stanford, however, in
structed that the University be
built where it now stands, on the
"Menlo Plain." The main Quad
rangle was orginally intended to
have had between two and six
other quadrangles added to its
sides for expansion.
Upon her husband's death,
however, Jane Stanford dropped
Olmsted's master plan, which in
cluded the construction of the
Outer Quad. Instead she built a
gymnasium. library and
chemistry building.

According to Turner, Jane
Stanford's supervision of con
struction was not as rigorous as
her husband's.
Following the San Francisco
Earthquake of 1906 that devasted
the University, most of Senator
Stanford's structures survived,
while Jane Stanford's were badly
damaged. The library and gym
nasium that she built were never
replaced.
Today, after a hundred years
of modifications, some remnants
of Olmsted's plan survive. The
curving roads of the faculty
ghetto are reminiscent of
Olmsted's interest in integrating
his sites with nature.
According to graduate student
Gerard Koskovich, author of a
graduate seminar paper on
Olmsted, the completion of the
Graduate School of Business ad
dition last year destroyed the
longest surviving vista of nature
from Olmsted's original plans.
Lamenting the death of
Olmsted's master plan, John
Branner, the second president of
the University, wrote in a letter
to Andrew Dickson White, then
president of Cornell University,
"A fact . . . that few people now
remember is that important parts
of the original plans by Frederick
Law Olmsted have been entirely
lost sight of by the president and
the trustees."
"Those plans lay at the foun
dation of the beauty of the place,
but they were so comprehensive
that they were soon lost sight of
in dealing with some of the
details."
