## Development remains controversial History of growth still alive 
### Tim Hullar 
This is the first in a scries on the
growth of Stanford. The next install
ment will appear two weeks from
today.

The architecture of Stanford Uni
versity has come a long way from
the pastoral ideal that its original
designers planned for it.
Architects in 1885 envisioned that
the future Stanford University
would he built on the Knoll, the hill
on which the Music Annex now
stands. Also, if the planners' vision
had been followed, winding roads
and paths, rather than the arcades of
today's formal Quadrangle, would
have connected the University's
well-spaced buildings.

Research by Art History Prof.
Paul Turner has revealed that the
development of the University has
been controversial since its earliest
days.
Today, disputes about the ar
chitectural development of the Uni
versity often arise over the issue of
the Foothills. Many were relieved,
for example, that further develop
ment was kept out of the Foothills
last year when construction of the
Reagan Library was cancelled.

The Board of Trustees will vote
tomorrow on a plan to install a S(XM)
square-foot studio in the Foothills
for faculty and graduate students in
the art department.
These are, however, only the
most recent conflicts over Stan
ford's development.
According to Turner, the first land
planning dispute at Stanford arose
between Leland Stanford, Sr. and
Frederick Law Olmsted, the
landscape architect Stanford com
missioned for $I(),(K)() to design his
university.
Olmsted, known as "the father of
American landscape architecture,"
is perhaps most famous for his
desiun of Central Park in New York

In the late IXIMIs, Stanford architects envisioned that the University's original quadrangle would eventually be sur
rounded by up to six peripheral quadrangles.
