Because the Hoover Institu
tion is the object of many a joke
or snide remark at Stanford, it's
nice now and then to read a new
work from one of its research fel
lows in order to keep an objec
tive eye on the intellectual activ
ity at that controversial conser
vative think tank.
"My Dear Alex: Letters From
the KGB" is a collaborative ef
fort by Gregory Fossedal, a
media fellow at Hoover, and
Dinesh D'Souza, managing
editor of Policy Review, a rightist
journal closely alligned with the
Heritage Foundation in Washing
ton. D.C.
Fossedal, 28, and D'Souza, 26,
are both products, and in some
sense creators, of the conserva

tive revolution on college
campuses during the late "70s and
early '80s. Fossedal was the
founding editor in 1980 of the
groundbreaking conservative
college weekly, "The Dartmouth
Review."
He and D'Souza have
authored four hooks between

them, all nonfiction. D'Souza
received favorable reviews from
The New York Times for
"Before the Millenium," his
1984 biography of Jerry Falwell.
Fossedal's previous works have
addressed public policy issues,
with an emphasis on the Reagan
administration.
"My Dear Alex" is modeled
after C.S. Lewis' "Screwtape
Letters," but it perhaps best
resembles a collection of Art
Hoppe or Art Buchwald newspa
per columns, in that it uses the
same kind of farcical, broad
brushed method of criticism by
humorous, inverse logic.
A quick read, "My Dear
Alex" is at times entertaining
and thought-provoking. Not
withstanding its relentlessly
rightist tilt, the book manages to
deftly pick apart some sloppy
reasoning in standard left-wing
arguments.
Calling itself "a work of sat
ire," the 117-page epistolary
book tells the fictional story of a
raw young KCIB agent who tries
to sow seeds of communist dis
cord in Reagan's America by

cozying up to and manipulating
this country's liberal press and
"intelligentsia."
The key to this Soviet cam
paign is a "zero-sum game" line
of reasoning adopted by a slick
KGB disinformation expert
named Vladimir, who is the in
carnation of every conservative's
most cynical conception of Gor
bachevian "glasnost." This Rus
sian considers any political loss
of Reagan's, no matter how
small, a gain for the Soviet Un
ion.
As the book's only voice,
Vladimir is presumably a pure
spokesman for Moscow's
"real," hidden (i.e. subversive)
agenda. Vladimir's assignment:
to teach his apprentice, Alex, the
subtleties of political warfare
against Reagan-style anti
communism.
Naturally, according to
Vladimir, those who are the most
capable of poking holes in
Reagan's balloon are the leftist
media â€” the eternal whipping
boys of conservatives every
where. So Vladimir is content to
let Anthony Lewis, Tom Wicker

and the other denizens of the
New York Times' editorial page
do the Soviets' work for them. If
the media aren't all outright
apologists for the Soviets (some

columns.

are, claims Vladimir), then they
at least further the communist
cause whenever they criticize the
president.
This dubious premise is the
book's centerpiece.

Fossedal and D'Souza do,
however, make some witty and
salient points about the conduct
of the contemporary political
dialogue on the editorial pages.
Linguistic crutches are exposed
ruthlessly. One all-too-true ex
ample: "Whatever you say,
Alex, never fail to bring up the
moral high ground.' Americans
seem to think one loses it every
time one pursues any policy
other than appeasement."
Fortunately, there are a few
darts aimed at conservative pun
dits as well. William F. Buclcley
takes a brief fall for his
"disposition for the polysyllabic,
especially when he is losing an
argument."
In his somewhat hyperbolic in
troduction, former President
Richard Nixon calls the book
"the best political satire since
Orwell.''
This it is not. The book offers
no real characters, only thinly
veiled fictional polemic. The
prose is choppy, clipped and
repetitive.
"My Dear Alex" is not
polished fiction; it is journalism.
