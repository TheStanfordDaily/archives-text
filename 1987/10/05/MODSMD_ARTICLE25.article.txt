## UCLA humiliates winless Cardinal 49-0 
### Susan Slusser Senior staff writer 
In the past six years, whenever
Stanford has beaten UCLA the
Bruins have not gone to the Rose
Bowl.
If Saturday's game between
the two Pacific 10 Conference
schools is any indication, it looks
like UCLA will once again be
playing at home in Pasadena on
New Year's Day.
The Bruins shellacked the Car
dinal, 49-0, dealing Stanford its
worst loss since USC embar
rassed the team by the same
score in 1977. The win ups
UCLA's record to 4-1 overall
and 2-0 in the Pac-10, while the
Cardinal drops to 0-4 overall and
0-2 in conference play â€” the
poorest start for Stanford since
the team went 1-10 in 1983.
"We're going to really have to
evaluate what's happening,''
Stanford Coach Jack Elway said
after the game.
UCLA demonstrated on Satur
day that it has the most talent in
the Pac-10 on both offense and
defense, while Stanford, once
again without the services of tail
back Brad Muster, continued to
struggle offensively. "Today was
absolutely a terrible, terrible day
on offense," Elway said.
So terrible, in fact, that Stan
ford quarterbacks completed al
most as many passes to the Bruin
defense as they did to Cardinal
receivers. Three different Cardi
nal quarterbacks threw a total of
six interceptions, two of which
were returned for touchdowns.
"It was the most frustrated
I've ever felt in my whole life,"
said sophomore Scott Stark, who
made his first college start only
to have two passes picked off. "1
tried to get things going, but

nothing would work."
"You remember these for
life," senior Greg Ennis said,
who had three tosses inter
cepted.
Overall, Stark, Ennis and
sophomore Brian Johnson (who
threw the final Stanford intercep
tion with 24 seconds left in the
game) completed 13 of 30 passes

for 125 yards. Bruin signal
callers Troy Aikman and Bren
dan McCracken, on the other
hand, finished 16 of 21 for 237
yards with one interception.
The solo interception,
acrobatically picked off by Stan
ford safety Brad Humphreys in
the Cardinal end zone in the first
quarter, was the first interception

thrown by a UCLA quarterback
this season, and Aikman wasn't
happy about it."It still bothers
me," the transfer from Okla
homa said. "I shouldn't have
thrown it. I was getting greedy
and trying to go for the end
zone."
No further miscues (apart from

Sophomore quarterback Scott Stark wasn't the answer to the Cardinal's offensive problems on Saturday.
Stark threw two interceptions and was removed in favor of (ireg Knnis in the second quarter.
