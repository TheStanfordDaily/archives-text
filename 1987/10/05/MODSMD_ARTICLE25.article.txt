## UCLA humiliates winless Cardinal 49-0 
### Susan Slusser Senior staff writer 
In the past six years, whenever
Stanford has beaten UCLA the
Bruins have not gone to the Rose
Bowl.
If Saturday's game between
the two Pacific 10 Conference
schools is any indication, it looks
like UCLA will once again be
playing at home in Pasadena on
New Year's Day.
The Bruins shellacked the Car
dinal, 49-0, dealing Stanford its
worst loss since USC embar
rassed the team by the same
score in 1977. The win ups
UCLA's record to 4-1 overall
and 2-0 in the Pac-10, while the
Cardinal drops to 0-4 overall and
0-2 in conference play — the
poorest start for Stanford since
the team went 1-10 in 1983.
"We're going to really have to
evaluate what's happening,''
Stanford Coach Jack Elway said
after the game.
UCLA demonstrated on Satur
day that it has the most talent in
the Pac-10 on both offense and
defense, while Stanford, once
again without the services of tail
back Brad Muster, continued to
struggle offensively. "Today was
absolutely a terrible, terrible day
on offense," Elway said.
So terrible, in fact, that Stan
ford quarterbacks completed al
most as many passes to the Bruin
defense as they did to Cardinal
receivers. Three different Cardi
nal quarterbacks threw a total of
six interceptions, two of which
were returned for touchdowns.
"It was the most frustrated
I've ever felt in my whole life,"
said sophomore Scott Stark, who
made his first college start only
to have two passes picked off. "1
tried to get things going, but

nothing would work."
"You remember these for
life," senior Greg Ennis said,
who had three tosses inter
cepted.
Overall, Stark, Ennis and
sophomore Brian Johnson (who
threw the final Stanford intercep
tion with 24 seconds left in the
game) completed 13 of 30 passes

for 125 yards. Bruin signal
callers Troy Aikman and Bren
dan McCracken, on the other
hand, finished 16 of 21 for 237
yards with one interception.
The solo interception,
acrobatically picked off by Stan
ford safety Brad Humphreys in
the Cardinal end zone in the first
quarter, was the first interception

thrown by a UCLA quarterback
this season, and Aikman wasn't
happy about it."It still bothers
me," the transfer from Okla
homa said. "I shouldn't have
thrown it. I was getting greedy
and trying to go for the end
zone."
No further miscues (apart from

Sophomore quarterback Scott Stark wasn't the answer to the Cardinal's offensive problems on Saturday.
Stark threw two interceptions and was removed in favor of (ireg Knnis in the second quarter.
a weak 14-yard Harold Barkate
punt) marred the Bruins' per
formance, however, despite a
strong first half effort by the
Stanford defense.
In fact, that defense kept the
Cardinal in the game during ihe
first half, forcing the Bruins to
kick field goals of 22, 49 and 42
yards in its first three posses
sions and holding Heisman
Trophy candidate Gaston Green,
who was averaging 11 1 yards
rushing per game, to a mere 28
yards on 12 carries. Along with
Humphreys, linebackers Rob
Hinckley and Jono Tunney and
freshman cornerback Kevin
Scott all had big plays for Stan
ford.
"Our defense did play hard,"
Elway said. "Even through the
emotional downs created by our
offense, the defense still played
tough and with intensity."
The Stanford offense started
creating problems for itself al
most from the minute the game
began. On the third play of the

game, just 40 second into the
contest, Stark completed his first
college pass — right into the
arms of waiting Bruin tackle Jeff
Glasser.
That started a run of three
UCLA possessions culminating
in field goals (a span which in
cluded a successful Bruin onside
kick), and then, with Stanford
trailing 9-0 in the second quarter,
cornerback Marcus Turner
picked off a tipped Stark pass
and returned it 54 yards for the
first Bruin touchdown.
On their next possession, the
Bruins traveled 82 yards in eight
plays — 54 of those coming on a
long pass play to Green — and
scored on a a three-yard toss
from Aikman to flanker Paco
Craig.
Ennis came on in relief at quar
terback with 1:02 left in the half
and with Stanford in UCLA terri
tory for the first time in the game.
A penalty and a sack moved
Stanford backward instead of
forward, however, and the half
ended with UCLA on top 23-0.
It wasn't until the third quarter
that things started getting ugly.
Really ugly. The Bruins scored
almost immediately on an 80-

yard four-play drive highlighted
by a 20-yard run by Green and a
40-yard scoring strike from Aik
man to Craig.
It was obvious Stanford's ini
tial possession of the half would
not be a good one when freshman
running back Charlie Young
fumbled on the first play from
scrimmage. Young recovered his
own fumble, but lost seven yards
on the play, back to the Stanford
17-yard line. After an incomplete
pass and faced with third down
and 17 from his own 17, Ennis,
pursued by UCLA defenders,
was about to go down at the goal
line and decided to get rid of the
ball.
It was an unwise decision, to
say the least. The ball traveled
nine yards — right into the hands
of oncoming linebacker Ben
Hummel, who took the intercep
tion into the end zone for the
fourth UCLA touchdown of the
game and the second touchdown
by the defense.
"It was a stupid play," Ennis
said, "My stupid play. It was a
fullback screen. I though I saw
the outside backer inside, so I
didn't throw it. Then I got bit,
and decided to throw it."

After another sack, Stanford
had to punt again, and a 59-yard
beauty by Doug Robison put the
Bruins back on their own 9-yard
line.
What a time for Gaston Green
to finally break out of his game
long slump. And he really broke
out of it. On the very first play of
the UCLA possession, after
sweeping right, then cutting back
left and finding the open field,
Green took the ball all the way.
Once in the open field, no one
caught him.
"I knew sooner or later some
thing was going to happen," said
Green, who became the Bruins'
all-time leading rusher with the
91-yard TD run."I feel I'm capa
ble of breaking it open."
With his team down 44-0 and
things getting a little out of hand,
Ennis moved Stanford into
UCLA territory once again
before throwing his second inter
ception, which Bruin linebacker
Chance Johnson returned 41
yards before turning the ball over
himself, fumbling at the Stanford
33-yard line. Chuck Gillingham
recovered for the Cardinal, but
two plays later, another Ennis
pass was intercepted — by

Turner again — after linebacker
Craig Davis batted the ball in the
air.
Turner's 53-yard interception
return was nullified by a UCLA
personal foul, but the Bruins
retained possession. Once again
the Stanford defense played
tough at the goal line, stopping
the Bruins after a first and goal at
the Stanford 5-yard line and forc
ing Alfredo Velasco to kick his
fourth field goal of the contest.
Even down 47-0, the defense
didn't back down, as UCLA
drove 80 yards to the Stanford 11
before the Cardinal forced a
McCracken fumble which was
recovered by sophomore Kevin
Mescher.
But it takes more than good
defense to be successful, of
course, and the way the offense
was going, about the only thing
that hadn't happened was a
safety.
That, of course was exactly
what happened four plays later
with Stanford moved back to its
own 13 after a clipping penalty.
Stark, back in the game and un
der heavy pursuit, was finally
brought down in the Cardinal end
zone by Rocen Keeton and Brad

Bryson. Mercifully, that brought
an end to the Bruin scoring.
Johnson, who came in with
1:28 left, provided some much
needed offensive excitement in
engineering Stanford's final
drive. The sophomore scrambled
and threw the Cardinal down to
the UCLA 32 before Mark
McGill ended the Stanford of
fense's day with, appropriately
enough, an interception.
"The offense scored a lot of
points," said senior wide
receiver Jeff James, who caught
four passes for 33 yards, "it was
just on the wrong side of the
scoreboard. That seems to be the
story of the last three weeks —
we keep beating ourselves."
All in all, the six interceptions
directly led to 20 Bruin points.
UCLA compiled 564 total yards
to 146 for Stanford. Even more
startling, the Bruins totalled 346
yards on the ground to just 73 for
the Cardinal. Playing without
Muster, who sat out with a
reinjured left ankle, Stanford
averaged a miniscule .7 yards pe>"
run.
averaged a miniscule .7 yards per
run.
"I thought our defense did an
excellent job of forcing turn
overs," UCLA Coach Terry
Donahue said. "Stanford played
really hard and they had a good
game against us, hut they just
didn't have a quarterback who
could get it done for them. And
they also played without their
best player— Muster."
Green finished with 139 yards
on 14 carries and also caught four
passes for 78 yards. Aikman,

who came into the game leading
the nation in passing efficiency,
was again efficient, connecting
on 12 of 15 for 187 yards and two
scores.
"I was impressed (by Aik
man)," Ennis said. "1 went up to
him at the end of the game and
wished him luck. He's a good
quarterback, he's going to go
far."
Card notes
A crowd of 57,500 showed up for
the game, which was shown on a
split-national basis by ABC.
A bright spot for Stanford was the
return of linebacker Barry
MeKeever, who has been out since
knee surgery last spring.
