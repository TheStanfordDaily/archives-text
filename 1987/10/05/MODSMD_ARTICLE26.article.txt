# Fortunes of James, Robison diverging
## 
### Chris Fialko Senior staff writer 
Stanford's 49-0 loss to UCLA
on Saturday provided Cardinal
punter Doug Robison with a
catch-22 situation, but left wide
reeeiver Jeff James simply with
out many catches.
The final season on the Farm
for these two Stanford seniors
has been one of diverging
fortunes. When the NCAA
finishes compiling the statistics
from Saturday's games, Robison
will most likely be ranked as one
of the top three punters in the na
tion, if not the top one statisti
cally.
James, meanwhile, has been
frustrated by the highly inconsis
tent Cardinal offense. During
Stanford's 0-4 start, Cardinal
quarterbacks have been able to
get him the ball only 13 times.
"It's a little bit frustrating, es
pecially coming off last season
and the year like last year,"
James said. "It's hard not to
compare the two. It's time to
stop doing that and worrying
about our won-loss record. We
need to think week to week."
Indeed, after James' perform
ance last year, the Beverly Hills
native was touted as an All-
America candidate. In 1986,
James caught 52 passes for 779
yards and 8 touchdowns.
In addition, James and then
Stanford quarterback John Paye
always seemed to know where
the other was on the field. Now
James isn't even sure who's
going to be at quarterback.

"Quarterback is the type of
position the team has to rally
around," James said. "But with
them shuffling in and out that's
hard to do."
But James definitely doesn't
put the blame for the woeful
Stanford record on quarterback
ing problems.
"I don't think that's the prob
lem," he said. "We're just not
executing. Wo need to get
cohesiveness on offense."'
Stanford does have seven
games left, but right now James,
understandably, isn't feeling too
good about the season.
"Being 0-4 and getting your
ass kicked in the last one doesn't
feel great. I'll try to forget this
one," he said.
About the only performance
Stanford would like to remember
was Robison's punting clinic.
The four-year starter had kicks of
45, 40, 52, 42, 59 and 43 yards
against the Bruins. That comes to
a 46.8 average.
Of course, the fact that
Robison punted so often was
symptomatic of Stanford's sput
tering offense.
"It's nice to get recognized in
the stats, but it's a catch-22 situa
tion," Robison said. "At the
same time it means our offense is
not moving the ball."
Robison would have been
leading the nation in punting,
with a 48.6 yard average, going
into Saturday's game, but he
didn't have enough punts to
qualify for the leader board.
After Saturday's performance,
Robison will qualify.
In addition, opponents have
returned only seven of Robison's
16 punts, for a measly 6.3
average per return.
"It's been my childhood
dream." Robison said, when
asked if he was going to try to
play in the NFL next year. "But
I'm not putting everything in one
pile. I'll take it as it comes."
