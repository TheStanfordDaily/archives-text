# Water polo 2-1 in homestand
## 
### Mark Smoyer Staff writer 
For Stanford water polo, it was a
weekend of extremes.
With an inconsistent offense, a con
sistent defense, spurts of brilliance,
and despite spurts of haplessness, the
No. I Cardinal came out of a tough
three- game weekend with two wins.
The victories — over No. 3 UC-Irvine
and No. 8 Pepperdine — along with the
loss to No. 5 UCLA, put Stanford at
12-2 on the year.
The Cardinal's win over of Irvine on
Friday mirrored the two teams' match
earlier in the season only in the close
ness of the score. The teams' first
meeting Sept. 20 was a high-scoring
contest won 10-9 by the Cardinal in
overtime. Friday's game, however,
was a tight defensive battle.
The Cardinal jumped out early over
the Anteaters, scoring the game's first
two goals and leading 3-1 at the half.
Stanford did not score again until there
was 3:25 remaining in the third quarter
when sophomore Jon Swerdloff rifled
in a shot from six meters out. The

clincher came with 2:43 left in the
fourth quarter when senior Hob Abbott
passed to junior Grant Stanley, who
shot the ball past Irvine goalkeeper
Mark Maizel.
That goal made the score 5-3. Two
defensive stands ensured the Cardinal
win. Irvine's Dan Smoot finished up
the scoring with a goal with only 15
seconds on the clock. Besides his key
assist on the game-winner, Abbott con
tributed two goals. Senior Erich Fis
cher also scored twice.
"We need to be a little more produc
tive on offense," senior goalie Obi
Greenman said. "If we play like we did
on defense today, we'll have a good
chance to win tomorrow and Sunday."
Unfortunately for Stanford, the slug
gishness that marked much of its game
Friday did not change in Saturday's
match versus UCLA. In fact, it got
worse. After scoring only one goal
through the first three quarters of play,
Stanford finally started scoring in the
fourth quarter, thanks in part to Bruin
substituting, according to Stanford
Coach Dante Dettamanti.
In the Final quarter, Fischer scored

three goals, and junior Andrew Law
son scored one, but the Bruins (12-5)
scored two of their own. and that was
more than they needed for a 7-5 win.
"We've got to play better, ,, Lawson
said. "Our offense wasn't very good at
all.
"IFischer| is turning out a lot of of
fense, we're not generating enough of
fense in the front court or on the coun
terattack," Assistant Coach Greg
Gamble said.
While the defense remained very
strong against Pepperdine (8-3), the of
fense started out a little slow, not
scoring until 3:38 remained in the first
quarter, when Fischer scored, shooting
past Pepperdine goalie Scott Madill to
make the score 2-1.
Stanford then engineered a number
of blistering counterattacks in the
second quarter, resulting in goals for
Swerdloff (2), Stanley, and Oeding.
Stanford was up 5-3 at the half.
The Waves' only goal did not come
until only 10 seconds remained in the
quarter, as the Cardinal defense shut

Senior Erich Fischer leads the Cardinal in scoring this season. "He will definitely Ik- a
First Team All-American," Stanford Coach Dante I)cttamanti said. " He is one of the top
three players in the nation."
