# Spikers beat Texas, win title

Good things come to those who wait.
That could have been the motto for
the Stanford women's volleyball team
Friday night as the Cardinal won the
second annual Jostens Invitational
tournament in Maples Pavilion. After a
grueling match that lasted over two
hours, Stanford triumphed over Texas
15-8, 17-15. 15-12 behind a 20-kill effort
by tournament Most Valuable Player
Nancy Reno.
Stanford will now go to San Jose
State Tuesday night with a 10-3 record,
while the Longhorns drop to 7-5.
The dramatic tone was set early on
as California and UC-Santa Barbara
had a tight match for third place. The
Gauchos made it look like a laugher
after it took the first game 15-7, but Cal
bounced back to take a 7-0 lead in game
two.
UCSB fought back and tied it up at
11-11, but the Bears toughened and
held on for a 15-11 win. Santa Barbara
took the third game easily, 15-10, but
the match looked like it was going to go
to a fifth game when Cal went up 8-0 in
game four.
The Gauchos closed to 9-4, but Cal
freshman Tracy Krueger scored three
kills to make the margin 12-4. Then
Santa Barbara showed why it is ranked
13th in the nation as senior Judy Bel
lomo led them to the game and the
match. The final score was 15-7, 11-15,
15-10, 15-13.
Cal was led by freshman Lisa Arce
(28 kills and 22 digs for the tourna
ment), sophomore Tiffany Rochelle (18
kills against UCSB) and freshman set

ter Holly Me Peak, who had a team
high 20 digs and four blocks Friday
night.
For the Gauchos, Be Homo was
named to the all-tournament team after
her 22 kills and 19 digs against Cal.
Senior Yami Menendez added 12 kills
and 22 digs and junior setter Liz Towne
added 13 digs.
Cal is now 5-7 while UCSB improved
to 12-6.
When the final began, there was a
considerable amount at stake. Stanford
lost to San Jose State in the tournament
final last year and wanted to win its
own tournament this time around.
Texas, on the other hand, has always
had to fight the stigma of being a South
ern team in a sport dominated by
Californians. The Longhorns reached
its first-ever NCAA Final Four last
year by winning the Midwest regional,
but many people maintain Texas would
have had no chance to finish that high if
the NCAA had spread out the top
teams, instead of setting up the
regionals geographically.
In addition to Texas' eternal struggle
for respect on the West Coast, the
Longhorns and Cardinal have
developed a rivalry over the past few
years. The rivalry began in earnest in
1983 when Stanford beat Texas 16-14 in
the fifth game of the championship
match at the San Jose State Invita
tional.
The teams met again in 1985, at Stan
ford, and while the Longhorns served
for the match three times at two games
all, 14-12, the Cardinal pulled out a 15-
8, 16-14, 13-15, 5-15, 18-I6win.
Texas returned the favor with a ven
geance last year, taking a pair from the

Cardinal in Austin, three games to zero
and three games to one. Incredibly, for
a match with this kind of build-up, the
final on Friday actually lived up to the
hype.
Stanford, ranked No. 5 in the
country, got on the board first with an
Amy Hayes kill, but the game see
sawed until Hayes served up five
straight points for a 9-5 Cardinal lead.
Stanford ran the score to 14-6, but the
Longhorns stiffened. Seven times the
Cardinal served for the game and seven
times Texas said no with a side-out.
Finally, on the eighth game point,
Stanford senior setter Wendi Rush
came up with her 13th dig of the game
and Hayes buried a Lara Asper set
crosscourt for the game.
The 37-minute game was only the be
ginning, however, of a contest that 5-
foot-11 senior Reno called, "the most
draining match of the year." Stanford
continued its strong play in the second
game, working its way out to a 9-3 lead.
At this point Texas Coach Mick Haley
removed junior setter Sue Schelfhout
and inserted freshman Dagmara
Szyszczak, as well as sophomore
outside hitter Yvette Bradley.
Szyszczak did her best to get Haley
into a vicious two-setter controversy
by leading the Longhorns back to 9-8.
She recorded 6 assists on 11 attempts
for a .545 setting percentage (compared
to Schelfhout's 34-135, .252) and Brad
ley had a pair ol kills in the comeback.
Schelfhout returned at this point,
though, and when Stanford served for
the game at 14-13 she dug a ball that
went back over the net and hit the floor

to save the game. An Angie
Albrecht kill saved another Car
dinal game point at 15-14, but a
kill by Laura Olesen gave Stan
ford a third try at 16-15.
The third time was a charm as
Hayes came up with a big dig and
Rush gave the ball to Olesen
again. The sophomore middle
blocker made good once more,
scoring her ninth kill of the game
to put Stanford up two games to
love. The second game went for
47 minutes, an unheard-of length.
Following a 10-minute inter
mission in which the infamous
Doctor Dig made his 1987 debut
for the Mi/uno serving contest,
the players dragged their tired
bodies back out for game three.
The Longhorns played excep
tionally well in the early going,
jumping out to a 5-0 lead and
forcing a Cardinal timeout.
The Cardinal scored a pair and
then Stanford freshman Tracy
Hughes came in to spell senior
Teresa Smith in the back row.

Smith returned at 4-5 and another
four points drew a Texas timeout
at 8-5. The Longhorns crept back
to 12-12, but then Karen Kramer,
Texas' big gun, hit long and then
netted.
With Rush serving at match
point, Kramer redeemed herself
with a clutch kill, but Lara Asper
returned the favor for the Cardi
nal. On the second match point.
Rush took an Olesen dig and set
sophomore Jenny Chaffee. The
6-foot-2 hitter caught the Texas
defense on its heels with a soft
dink no one could reach, and fi
nally, at 11:02 p.m., victory went
to the Cardinal.
"It was a tough match," Stan
ford Coach Don Shaw said.
"Texas is a very disciplined,
good blocking team. Somehow
we managed to win the three
games."
The hero was tournament MVP
Reno, who had a match-high 27
digs against Texas, seven blocks
and a .325 hitting percentage to
go along with her 20 kills. Olesen
added 16 kills, and Smith pitched
in 14 kills and 18 digs. Rush had
26 digs and contributed 58 as
sists.

Texas received outstanding
performances from All-America
candidates Kramer and Dawn
Davenport, with 16 and 11 kills,
respectively. Both had .300-plus
hitting percentages. A big key for
the Cardinal, though, was stop
ping Angie Albrecht (15 kills
versus Cal on Thursday), who
had 11 hitting errors to match her
11 kills.
"Nancy (Reno) played ex
tremely well," Haley said, '"that
hurts us."
He found many good points in
the Horns' play, however,
mainly as a learning experience,
especially for Schelfhout, a
junior in her first year as a
starter. ' I really can't be too up
set about this loss because it gave
her the experience she needs,"
he said.
"1 think we'll grow. Davenport
played her heart out, and so did
Kramer," Haley said. "I think
Stanford is a good team."
Joining UCSB's Bellomo on
the all-tournament team were
Kramer and Davenport from
Texas, and Hayes, Smith and
Rush from Stanford.

for a .545 setting percentage (compared

though, and when Stanford served for

to save the game. An Angie
Albrecht kill saved another Car
dinal game point at 15-14, but a
kill by Laura Olesen gave Stan
ford a third try at 16-15.
The third time was a charm as
Hayes came up with a big dig and
Rush gave the ball to Olesen
again. The sophomore middle
blocker made good once more,
scoring her ninth kill of the game
to put Stanford up two games to
love. The second game went for
47 minutes, an unheard-of length.
Following a 10-minute inter
mission in which the infamous
Doctor Dig made his 1987 debut
for the Mi/uno serving contest,
the players dragged their tired
bodies back out for game three.
The Longhorns played excep
tionally well in the early going,
jumping out to a 5-0 lead and
forcing a Cardinal timeout.
The Cardinal scored a pair and
then Stanford freshman Tracy
Hughes came in to spell senior
Teresa Smith in the back row.

Smith returned at 4-5 and another
four points drew a Texas timeout
at 8-5. The Longhorns crept back
to 12-12, but then Karen Kramer,
Texas' big gun, hit long and then
netted.
With Rush serving at match
point, Kramer redeemed herself
with a clutch kill, but Lara Asper
returned the favor for the Cardi
nal. On the second match point.
Rush took an Olesen dig and set
sophomore Jenny Chaffee. The
6-foot-2 hitter caught the Texas
defense on its heels with a soft
dink no one could reach, and fi
nally, at 11:02 p.m., victory went
to the Cardinal.
"It was a tough match," Stan
ford Coach Don Shaw said.
"Texas is a very disciplined,
good blocking team. Somehow
we managed to win the three
games."
The hero was tournament MVP
Reno, who had a match-high 27
digs against Texas, seven blocks
and a .325 hitting percentage to
go along with her 20 kills. Olesen
added 16 kills, and Smith pitched
in 14 kills and 18 digs. Rush had
26 digs and contributed 58 as
sists.

Texas received outstanding
performances from All-America
candidates Kramer and Dawn
Davenport, with 16 and 11 kills,
respectively. Both had .300-plus
hitting percentages. A big key for
the Cardinal, though, was stop
ping Angie Albrecht (15 kills
versus Cal on Thursday), who
had 11 hitting errors to match her
11 kills.
"Nancy (Reno) played ex
tremely well," Haley said, '"that
hurts us."
He found many good points in
the Horns' play, however,
mainly as a learning experience,
especially for Schelfhout, a
junior in her first year as a
starter. ' I really can't be too up
set about this loss because it gave
her the experience she needs,"
he said.
"1 think we'll grow. Davenport
played her heart out, and so did
Kramer," Haley said. "I think
Stanford is a good team."
Joining UCSB's Bellomo on
the all-tournament team were
Kramer and Davenport from
Texas, and Hayes, Smith and
Rush from Stanford.
Good things come to those who wait.
That could have been the motto for
the Stanford women's volleyball team
Friday night as the Cardinal won the
second annual Jostens Invitational
tournament in Maples Pavilion. After a
grueling match that lasted over two
hours, Stanford triumphed over Texas
15-8, 17-15. 15-12 behind a 20-kill effort
by tournament Most Valuable Player
Nancy Reno.
Stanford will now go to San Jose
State Tuesday night with a 10-3 record,
while the Longhorns drop to 7-5.
The dramatic tone was set early on
as California and UC-Santa Barbara
had a tight match for third place. The
Gauchos made it look like a laugher
after it took the first game 15-7, but Cal
bounced back to take a 7-0 lead in game
two.
UCSB fought back and tied it up at
11-11, but the Bears toughened and
held on for a 15-11 win. Santa Barbara
took the third game easily, 15-10, but
the match looked like it was going to go
to a fifth game when Cal went up 8-0 in
game four.
The Gauchos closed to 9-4, but Cal
freshman Tracy Krueger scored three
kills to make the margin 12-4. Then
Santa Barbara showed why it is ranked
13th in the nation as senior Judy Bel
lomo led them to the game and the
match. The final score was 15-7, 11-15,
15-10, 15-13.
Cal was led by freshman Lisa Arce
(28 kills and 22 digs for the tourna
ment), sophomore Tiffany Rochelle (18
kills against UCSB) and freshman set

ter Holly Me Peak, who had a team
high 20 digs and four blocks Friday
night.
For the Gauchos, Be Homo was
named to the all-tournament team after
her 22 kills and 19 digs against Cal.
Senior Yami Menendez added 12 kills
and 22 digs and junior setter Liz Towne
added 13 digs.
Cal is now 5-7 while UCSB improved
to 12-6.
When the final began, there was a
considerable amount at stake. Stanford
lost to San Jose State in the tournament
final last year and wanted to win its
own tournament this time around.
Texas, on the other hand, has always
had to fight the stigma of being a South
ern team in a sport dominated by
Californians. The Longhorns reached
its first-ever NCAA Final Four last
year by winning the Midwest regional,
but many people maintain Texas would
have had no chance to finish that high if
the NCAA had spread out the top
teams, instead of setting up the
regionals geographically.
In addition to Texas' eternal struggle
for respect on the West Coast, the
Longhorns and Cardinal have
developed a rivalry over the past few
years. The rivalry began in earnest in
1983 when Stanford beat Texas 16-14 in
the fifth game of the championship
match at the San Jose State Invita
tional.
The teams met again in 1985, at Stan
ford, and while the Longhorns served
for the match three times at two games
all, 14-12, the Cardinal pulled out a 15-
8, 16-14, 13-15, 5-15, 18-I6win.
Texas returned the favor with a ven
geance last year, taking a pair from the

Cardinal in Austin, three games to zero
and three games to one. Incredibly, for
a match with this kind of build-up, the
final on Friday actually lived up to the
hype.
Stanford, ranked No. 5 in the
country, got on the board first with an
Amy Hayes kill, but the game see
sawed until Hayes served up five
straight points for a 9-5 Cardinal lead.
Stanford ran the score to 14-6, but the
Longhorns stiffened. Seven times the
Cardinal served for the game and seven
times Texas said no with a side-out.
Finally, on the eighth game point,
Stanford senior setter Wendi Rush
came up with her 13th dig of the game
and Hayes buried a Lara Asper set
crosscourt for the game.
The 37-minute game was only the be
ginning, however, of a contest that 5-
foot-11 senior Reno called, "the most
draining match of the year." Stanford
continued its strong play in the second
game, working its way out to a 9-3 lead.
At this point Texas Coach Mick Haley
removed junior setter Sue Schelfhout
and inserted freshman Dagmara
Szyszczak, as well as sophomore
outside hitter Yvette Bradley.
Szyszczak did her best to get Haley
into a vicious two-setter controversy
by leading the Longhorns back to 9-8.
She recorded 6 assists on 11 attempts
for a .545 setting percentage (compared
to Schelfhout's 34-135, .252) and Brad

took the third game easily, 15-10, but
the match looked like it was going to go
to a fifth game when Cal went up 8-0 in
game four.
The Gauchos closed to 9-4, but Cal
freshman Tracy Krueger scored three
kills to make the margin 12-4. Then
Santa Barbara showed why it is ranked
13th in the nation as senior Judy Bel
lomo led them to the game and the
match. The final score was 15-7, 11-15,
15-10, 15-13.
Cal was led by freshman Lisa Arce
(28 kills and 22 digs for the tourna
ment), sophomore Tiffany Rochelle (18
kills against UCSB) and freshman set

ter Holly Me Peak, who had a team
high 20 digs and four blocks Friday
night.
For the Gauchos, Be Homo was
named to the all-tournament team after
her 22 kills and 19 digs against Cal.
Senior Yami Menendez added 12 kills
and 22 digs and junior setter Liz Towne
added 13 digs.
Cal is now 5-7 while UCSB improved
to 12-6.
When the final began, there was a
considerable amount at stake. Stanford
lost to San Jose State in the tournament
final last year and wanted to win its
own tournament this time around.
Texas, on the other hand, has always
had to fight the stigma of being a South
ern team in a sport dominated by
Californians. The Longhorns reached
its first-ever NCAA Final Four last
year by winning the Midwest regional,
but many people maintain Texas would
have had no chance to finish that high if
the NCAA had spread out the top
teams, instead of setting up the
regionals geographically.
In addition to Texas' eternal struggle
for respect on the West Coast, the
Longhorns and Cardinal have
developed a rivalry over the past few
years. The rivalry began in earnest in
1983 when Stanford beat Texas 16-14 in
the fifth game of the championship
match at the San Jose State Invita
tional.
The teams met again in 1985, at Stan
ford, and while the Longhorns served
for the match three times at two games
all, 14-12, the Cardinal pulled out a 15-
8, 16-14, 13-15, 5-15, 18-I6win.
Texas returned the favor with a ven
geance last year, taking a pair from the

Cardinal in Austin, three games to zero
and three games to one. Incredibly, for
a match with this kind of build-up, the
final on Friday actually lived up to the
hype.
Stanford, ranked No. 5 in the
country, got on the board first with an
Amy Hayes kill, but the game see
sawed until Hayes served up five
straight points for a 9-5 Cardinal lead.
Stanford ran the score to 14-6, but the
Longhorns stiffened. Seven times the
Cardinal served for the game and seven
times Texas said no with a side-out.
Finally, on the eighth game point,
Stanford senior setter Wendi Rush
came up with her 13th dig of the game
and Hayes buried a Lara Asper set
crosscourt for the game.
The 37-minute game was only the be
ginning, however, of a contest that 5-
foot-11 senior Reno called, "the most
draining match of the year." Stanford
continued its strong play in the second
game, working its way out to a 9-3 lead.
At this point Texas Coach Mick Haley
removed junior setter Sue Schelfhout
and inserted freshman Dagmara
Szyszczak, as well as sophomore
outside hitter Yvette Bradley.
Szyszczak did her best to get Haley
into a vicious two-setter controversy
by leading the Longhorns back to 9-8.
She recorded 6 assists on 11 attempts
for a .545 setting percentage (compared
to Schelfhout's 34-135, .252) and Brad
ley had a pair ol kills in the comeback.
Schelfhout returned at this point,
though, and when Stanford served for
the game at 14-13 she dug a ball that
went back over the net and hit the floor

to save the game. An Angie
Albrecht kill saved another Car
dinal game point at 15-14, but a
kill by Laura Olesen gave Stan
ford a third try at 16-15.
The third time was a charm as
Hayes came up with a big dig and
Rush gave the ball to Olesen
again. The sophomore middle
blocker made good once more,
scoring her ninth kill of the game
to put Stanford up two games to
love. The second game went for
47 minutes, an unheard-of length.
Following a 10-minute inter
mission in which the infamous
Doctor Dig made his 1987 debut
for the Mi/uno serving contest,
the players dragged their tired
bodies back out for game three.
The Longhorns played excep
tionally well in the early going,
jumping out to a 5-0 lead and
forcing a Cardinal timeout.
The Cardinal scored a pair and
then Stanford freshman Tracy
Hughes came in to spell senior
Teresa Smith in the back row.

Smith returned at 4-5 and another
four points drew a Texas timeout
at 8-5. The Longhorns crept back
to 12-12, but then Karen Kramer,
Texas' big gun, hit long and then
netted.
With Rush serving at match
point, Kramer redeemed herself
with a clutch kill, but Lara Asper
returned the favor for the Cardi
nal. On the second match point.
Rush took an Olesen dig and set
sophomore Jenny Chaffee. The
6-foot-2 hitter caught the Texas
defense on its heels with a soft
dink no one could reach, and fi
nally, at 11:02 p.m., victory went
to the Cardinal.
"It was a tough match," Stan
ford Coach Don Shaw said.
"Texas is a very disciplined,
good blocking team. Somehow
we managed to win the three
games."
The hero was tournament MVP
Reno, who had a match-high 27
digs against Texas, seven blocks
and a .325 hitting percentage to
go along with her 20 kills. Olesen
added 16 kills, and Smith pitched
in 14 kills and 18 digs. Rush had
26 digs and contributed 58 as
sists.

Texas received outstanding
performances from All-America
candidates Kramer and Dawn
Davenport, with 16 and 11 kills,
respectively. Both had .300-plus
hitting percentages. A big key for
the Cardinal, though, was stop
ping Angie Albrecht (15 kills
versus Cal on Thursday), who
had 11 hitting errors to match her
11 kills.
"Nancy (Reno) played ex
tremely well," Haley said, '"that
hurts us."
He found many good points in
the Horns' play, however,
mainly as a learning experience,
especially for Schelfhout, a
junior in her first year as a
starter. ' I really can't be too up
set about this loss because it gave
her the experience she needs,"
he said.
"1 think we'll grow. Davenport
played her heart out, and so did
Kramer," Haley said. "I think
Stanford is a good team."
Joining UCSB's Bellomo on
the all-tournament team were
Kramer and Davenport from
Texas, and Hayes, Smith and
Rush from Stanford.
Good things come to those who wait.
That could have been the motto for
the Stanford women's volleyball team
Friday night as the Cardinal won the
second annual Jostens Invitational
tournament in Maples Pavilion. After a
grueling match that lasted over two
hours, Stanford triumphed over Texas
15-8, 17-15. 15-12 behind a 20-kill effort
by tournament Most Valuable Player
Nancy Reno.
Stanford will now go to San Jose
State Tuesday night with a 10-3 record,
while the Longhorns drop to 7-5.
The dramatic tone was set early on
as California and UC-Santa Barbara
had a tight match for third place. The
Gauchos made it look like a laugher
after it took the first game 15-7, but Cal
bounced back to take a 7-0 lead in game
two.
UCSB fought back and tied it up at
11-11, but the Bears toughened and
held on for a 15-11 win. Santa Barbara
took the third game easily, 15-10, but
the match looked like it was going to go
to a fifth game when Cal went up 8-0 in
game four.
The Gauchos closed to 9-4, but Cal
freshman Tracy Krueger scored three

Santa Barbara showed why it is ranked
