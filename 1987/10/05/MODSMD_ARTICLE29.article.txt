# Cardinal cross country runs in Stanford Invite
## 
### Ed Pike 
The Stanford men's and women's cross country
teams experienced mixed results at the Stanford In
vitational on Saturday.
While junior James Alborough and sophomore
Eric Mastalir had an excellent meet, placing third
and ninth, respectively, in the men's invitational
10-kilometer run, the men's team finished a disap
pointing sixth overall.
Alborough gutted out a 31:23.6 time to finish less
than 20 seconds behind the winner, San Diego
State's Matt Clouton. Mastalir also broke the 32-
minute mark, crossing the line in 31:48.5.
The strong performances by Alborough and Mas
talir, however, could not make up for low finishes
by other Cardinal runners.
Stanford's scoring was rounded out by David
Reese (in 48th place), Scott Forest (59th) and
senior Steve Schadler (67th).

"We needed to move up our third, fourth and
fifth runners," Stanford Coach Brooks Johnson
said of the men's team.
The Cardinal women came in third, well behind
1986 NCAA Champion Texas, but just one point
short of second-place UCLA.
Senior Cory Schubert, the first Stanford finisher
in the 5-kilometer race, took 12th overall with a
17:36.4 time. Sophomore Carol Gray returned from
an injury to place 17th and freshman Melanie Bloch
was 21st overall. All three completed the circuit in
less than 18 minutes.
Mary Mendoza (39th), Wendy Neely (63rd) and
Jamie Fallon (79th) rounded out the Cardinal
women's effort.
Despite Saturday's results, Johnson said he
believes his lower finishers will step forward to fill
the void behind the top finishers in time for the
Pacific 10 Conference Championship meet Novem
ber 2nd. Consistency will be the key in that meet,
Johnson said.
