# Jewish students see real Germany

In an effort to confront the
tragedy of their ancestors, 16
Jewish Stanford students
traveled to West Germany this
past September on a three week
program to build a "bridge of un
derstanding' ' between young
Jews and Germans.
United by a common trauma,
the students all felt a responsibil
ity to question their Jewish iden
tity. "Since childhood I've been
taught never to buy a German
car, never to vacation in Ger
many. and God forbid never to
marry a German man," said
Sheryl Lyss, a junior miyoring in
human biology.
"Rather than letting the views
of my parents, community and
friends fall into my lap and ac
cepting them as my own, I
wanted to see and determine (my
beliefs) for myself," she said.
Hans Adolf" Jacobsen, head of
the political science department
at the University of Bonn, first

conceived the idea for the trip.
His idea was received enthusias
tically by Hans Cohn, cantor at a
synagogue in Palo Alto, and
Rabbi Ari Cartun of the Hillel
Foundation, the Jewish students'
organization at Stanford.
Once a Nazi youth himself
who spent time in the Soviet Un
ion Russia as a prisoner of war,
Jacobsen persuaded the German
government to sponsor the pro
gram.
Traveling to Germany for the
first time, most of the students
felt apprehensive. Carolyn
Bronstein, a sophomore in com
munication. recalled an incident
at the start of the visit.
"I was coming off a train sta
tion near Bonn when an old
woman came right up to me,
raised her arm, and said Hiel
Hitler!' 1 was so shocked that I
was speechless," she said.
"What bothered me most,
though, was the German girl
standing behind me who just laughed. I
felt so angry I almost went back to the
airport to catch the next flight home."
According to Steven Lurie, a senior
majoring public policy, the Holocaust is a
catastrophe of such immense scale that
historians today try to minimize its tragic
proportions by watering down the facts.
"They would compare the Holocaust
to other atrocities in the Soviet Union,"
he said. "This form of historical
revisionism is dangerous and pernicious
to me simply because the truth is con
cealed by facile comparisons."
Along with studies, part of the trip's
educational experience came from living
with families in West Germany.
"These people live with communism
day by day and have relatives in East
Germany," said Howard Finkelstein, a
sophomore majoring in industrial engi
neering.
Finkelstein said he was amazed to see
how his German family could achieve
stability in such a divisive environment.
Most students expressed disappoint
ment, but not surprise, at their conversa
tions with the older generation of Ger
mans.
"I came to expect a common response
from everyone, " said junior Dan
Schechter.
"The grandparents were willing to talk
only if they hadn't been guilty" of com
plicity with the Nazis, he said. "Those
who were in Germany during the war felt
[they were only) tiny parts in the big ma
chine that exterminated Jews."

"When I detected in them that the only
horrible thing about the war was that
[Germany] lost and not that the Jews
were murdered, however, I was ex
tremely said Jocelyn Reisman,
associate director of the Hillel Founda
tion.
"But with the younger generation, I
found a whole different level of curiosity,
openness and sympathy. These young
people really wanted to know what hap
pened but are afraid to ask their parents
or grandparents," she said.
Indeed, some of the students said they
discovered that many German children
have created a myth about the Holocaust
experiences based on their own fantasies,
particularly in families where parents had
been silent about their personal experi
ences.
In addition to their stay in West Ger
many, the group also traveled to Munich,
and East Berlin.
"We passed by churches less than
three miles away from Dachau (one of the
concentration camps used by Germans to
exterminate Jews during the war), and
the question that ran through my mind
was how people could go to church, pray
to Jesus to help them love their neighbor
as themselves and then resume their daily
activity of murdering the Jews, Reisman
said.
Jeff Kessler, a senior in biology, said
he was shaken by his own ignorance." At
the museum in Dachau there was a list of
companies during the 40s which exploited
Jewish labor," he said. "1 was shocked
to learn that it included popular
names like BMW and Mer
cedes."
Offering a similar sentiment,
Lyss said that at Dachau "I
realized for the first time that had
I been there 40 years ago, I
would not have been one of the
strong people standing up and
giving others hope. 1 would have
followed like a sheep and gone to
my death," Lyss said.
Back in the United States, the
students all expressed their fears
for the dying Jewish communities
in Germany.
During the war, the Germans
destroyed all the Jewish
synagogues, Finkelstein said. "It
is scary to think that there are 10
times as many Jews in the Bay
area as there are in the whole of
Germany today."
"The Jewish community will
never be the same," Noa More, a
graduate student in applied
physics, said.
More continued, "It seems in
congruous to me that a lot of
Jews would express heartfelt
concern but would not step foot
in Germany because of what had
happened to their ancestors
there. The Nazi campaign was to
rid Germany of Jews. When
there are no longer any Jewish
people living in Germany, then
Hitler has indeed won."
