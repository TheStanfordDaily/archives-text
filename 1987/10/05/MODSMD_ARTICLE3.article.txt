In an effort to confront the
tragedy of their ancestors, 16
Jewish Stanford students
traveled to West Germany this
past September on a three week
program to build a "bridge of un

"I was coming off a train sta

woman came right up to me,
raised her arm, and said Hiel
Hitler!' 1 was so shocked that I
was speechless," she said.
"What bothered me most,
