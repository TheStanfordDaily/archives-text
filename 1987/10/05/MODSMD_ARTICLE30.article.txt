# Tigers slay Jays

### 
DETROIT (AP) â€” The
Detroit Tigers took advantage
of one of the great collapses in
baseball history to win the
American League East title
yesterday, beating the
Toronto Blue Jays 1-0 behind
the six-hit pitching of Frank
Tanana.
The Blue Jays lost their last
seven games of the season, in
cluding three in a row in this
season-ending series in
Detroit, squandering a lead
over the Tigers that was 3
games on Sept. 26.
The Tigers, who got a home
run from Larry Herndon in the
clincher, finished the season
two games ahead of the Blue
Jays and avoided a one-game
playoff that would have been
held here today if the Blue
Jays had won.
Tanana, 15-10, pitched his
third shutout, walking three
and striking out nine. Herndon

put the Tigers ahead once and
for all in this season of struggle
with a one-out, solo homer in
the second inning off
Toronto's ace, Jimmy Key,
17-8, who allowed only three
hits, struck out eight and
finished with the AL ERA title
at 2.76.
The Blue Jays held their 3-
game lead over Detroit after
winning six in a row, inluding
the first three games of a four
game set against Detroit in
Toronto last weekend. But
Toronto lost the last game of
the series, then three straight
to Milwaukee before coming
to Detroit.
All seven of the games the
Blue Jays and Tigers played in
the final two weeks of the
season were decided by one
run, and two went extra in
nings, including Saturday's 3-
2, 12-inning victory that put
the Tigers a game ahead.
