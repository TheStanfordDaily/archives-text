With a superb team effort, the
men's soccer squad defeated No.
2 San Francisco 1-0 Saturday,
handing the Dons their first loss
of the season. With the victory at
San Francisco, the Cardinal
raised its overall record to an
even 4-4-2, and is 1-0 in Pacific
Soccer Conference play.
"It was definitely a great win.
The entire team did an excellent
job," Coach Sam Koch said.
The match was scoreless
through the first half, with each
squad preventing the other from
even taking many shots at the
goal. The lone goal was recorded
by junior midfielder Luke Gar
rott in the second period on a free
kick. USF All-America sweeper
John Doyle committed a foul
outside the penalty box, giving
the Cardinal the free shot ap
proximately 35 feet from the
goal. Garrott kicked a bent ball
over the human wall of Dons
players covering the goal on the
kick and into the top corner of

the net, out of reach of USF
goalie Phil Coates.
"Garrott made a great goal. It
is an extremely difficult shot to
connect on," stated Koch.
In the defense-dominated
game, Stanford recorded eight
shots on goal to USF's seven.
Cardinal goalie Chris Helling and
Coates had two saves each.
While stating that all the Stan
ford booters "played hard and
did a good job," Koch also sin
gled out Helling, midfielder Pat
Sheehy and the four Cardinal
defenders — David Thorpe,
Andrew Westergren, Tim Keyes
and Mark Simioli — for excep
tional individual performances.
"This victory is the biggest
win of the fall season — for any
sport," said Stanford Sports In
formation Director Steve Rac
zynski.
The Cardinal hosts another
Pacific Conference rival, Fresno
State, Wednesday,.
Stanford will be seeking to
avenge last season's 1-0 loss.

Fullback Kelly McDevitt is part of a stingy Cardinal defense. Despite allowing only one
goal against Westmont College on Saturday, Stanford lost its fifth game this season.
