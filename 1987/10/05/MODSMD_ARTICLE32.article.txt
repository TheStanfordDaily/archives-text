# Warriors win
## 
### Robert Partington 
Frustration was the key word Saturday when the
Stanford women's soccer team dropped a close
contest to Westmont College, 1-0. The Cardinal is
now 1-5-2 on the season with its next game against
undefeated California on Friday.
Using an offside trap in the first half, Westmont
controlled the field early on. The Warriors forced
three offside calls against the Cardinal. Led by
sweeper Sandra Asimos, who policed the field with
authority throughout the game, Westmont s
defense was tough to penetrate.
Fifteen minutes into the game. Warrior midfielder
Cindy Kurle poked the ball into the net, scoring her
second goal of the season. Kurle's shot proved to
be the only goal scored all day.
"We thought Stanford would give us a tough
game." Kurle said. "But if we played our game, we
knew we could beat them.".
Despite another Cardinal loss, the statistics show
the game to have been fairly even. Westmont took
II shots on goal to Stanford's nine. Cardinal
goalkeeper Vija Brookshire had four saves,
compared to Westmont keeper Shelly Sprague's
three.
"Vija played well." Stanford Coach Berhane An
deberhan said. "She stayed composed after their
(Westmont's) goal."
Overall, Andeberhan was pleased with the team s
effort. "We mounted a good comeback in the
second half," he said.
In fact. Stanford had the ball in scoring position
for most of the game's last five minutes. But the ex
perienced Warrior defenders held out. Westmont
has five seniors on its team, while the Cardinal has
only two.
After losing to St. Mary's and beating Stanford
on consecutive days, the Warriors are now 3-4-1.
"We knew we would have a hard game with Stan
ford," Westmont Coach Karen Jennings said. "But
coming off that loss, we were up for a win."
