# Field hockey beats SJSU

### Mark Anderegg 
Junior Alison Smith scored a
controversial goal with 1 1
minutes left in the game to lead
the Stanford field hockey team to
a 2-1 victory over San Jose State
on Saturday.
Smith's goal was scored off a
rebound from the Cardinal's
seventh penalty corner shot of
the game. After the goal, a
rejuvenated Stanford team lined
up to resume play, apparently
carrying a one-goal lead.
But one of the referees, think
ing the ball hadn't stopped after
the penalty corner shot, dis
allowed the goal.
After a conference between
the two referees, however, the
goal was allowed to stand. "We
don't usually yell that much,"
Stanford Coach Sheryl Johnson
said. "But that was clearly a
goal."
The Cardinal dominated play
early on, but was unable to score
in the first half. Nine shots on
goal went for naught in the first
35 minutes of play as the Spartan
defense held tough.
"1 thought that we controlled
the game early on," Johnson
said. "(But) there were a few

key calls that changed the atmos
phere of the game."
SJSU recovered from a lack
luster first half performance,
which included only four shots
on goal, and came out strong in
the second half. For almost 15
minutes, play was focused near
the Stanford goal.

fc We don't usually
yell that much. But
that was clearly a
goal.'

The Cardinal defense rose to
the occasion, however, denying
the Spartans any goals during
that stretch. That 15-minute
stretch was the turning point of
the game.
Stanford was later able to
move into SJSU territory. It
jumped out to a 1-0 lead when
freshman Patricia McJennet
rocketed in an unassisted goal
from outside the goal circle with
20 minutes left in the game.
The Cardinal could not make
the lead stand up, however, and

the contest was deadlocked once
again just six minutes later, when
SJSU's Lisa Gray knocked one
just inside the goalpost from
close range.
At that point the Cardinal
poured on the pressure, with
Smith scoring late in the game.
Stanford's defense held up as the
team cashed in for its third suc
cessive conference victory.
Although Stanford dominated
the game statistically, the Cardi
nal performance was obviously
subpar. "It wasn't our best
game," Johnson said. "I'm
happy we won and I think we
should've won, but it wasn't our
best game."
But Johnson was very happy
with some individual perfor
mances. She noted that senior
Ami Chitwood and junior Lena
Slachmuijlder had "great"
games. Johnson also pointed to
yet another solid game from
junior goalie Karen Jones, who
had eight saves.
Next up for the Cardinal is Cal
ifornia. "I expect a good game,"
Johnson said of the California
contest. "But ranked No. 5, I ex
pect to win. The team is getting
their rhythm. We'll be real tough
from here on out."
