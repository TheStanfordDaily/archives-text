# Alcohol policy still pending
## 
### Mark Lawrence Senior staff writer 
University officials said yes
terday they were encouraged by
the behavior of spectators during
Saturday's Stanford-UCLA foot
ball game at Stanford Stadium
but that it was too early to spec
ulate on whether alcohol will be
allowed at future games here.
High-ranking University ad
ministrators, including Univer
sity President Donald Kennedy,
Athletic Director Andy Geiger
and Dean of Student Affairs
James Lyons, will discuss the
stadium alcohol policy at a presi
dent's staff meeting this morning
and decide what course to take
for Stanford's three remaining
home games this year.
A key factor in that discussion
will be a police report on the dis
ruptions that occurred during the
game. Stanford Police Chief Mar
vin Herrington said immediately
following the game that there
were significantly fewer alcohol
related incidents this Saturday
than there were at last week's
Stanford-San Jose State game,
and that spectator behavior was
generally much improved.
"In the number of arrests, it
was about the same, but there
was much less fighting (in the
stands)," Herrington said.

He said police issued citations
to 10 students under the age of 21
for possession of alcohol — the
same number as last week. Police
received four reports of beer
cans and ice being thrown, and
broke up one "shoving match"
in the student section, Herring
ton said.
Herrington added that a new
policy of not allowing spectators
to bring in any alcohol after the
beginning of the game appeared
to have had an effect on the con
ditions in the stands. He esti
mated that the rule, adopted last
week, prevented about 100 cases
of beer from being brought into
the stadium at halftime.
The Sept. 26 game against San
Jose State was marred by at least
six fights — three of them in the
student section — and six reports
of spectators throwing debris in
the stands. In addition, a 23-year
old San Jose man died, possibly
of alcohol-related causes, while
jogging to his car at halftime to
get more beer.
Last week, Geiger threatened
that the UCLA game was a "last
chance" for students to show
that they could drink responsibly
at football games. In addition,
Norm Robinson, associate dean
of Student Affairs for Residential
Education, sent a memorandum
to residence staff members ur
ging them to discuss with stu
dents the University's concern
about growing problems with
alcohol-related disruptions in the
stadium.
Robinson said yesterday that
the memorandum appeared to
have had some effect. "It
seemed like an entirely different

group of students than last
week's game," he said.
Lyons called the behavior of
students in the stands "superb."
Geiger, reached yesterday,
said he could not comment on
student behavior or on the future
of alcohol in the stadium until
after this morning's meeting.
Stanford, the only Pacific 10
Conference member to allow al
cohol in its stadium, decided
after a review last spring to con
tinue on a probationary basis its
longstanding policy of allowing
alcohol in the stands.

The University Committee on
Athletics, Physical Education
and Recreation said in May that
its decision represented a "trial
continuation" of the policy and
that a more permanent decision
to allow drinking was contingent
on improved behavior by specta
tors.
The committee will meet next
week and will discuss the
stadium alcohol policy, said Rob
inson, a committee member. The
committee makes recommenda
tions to Kennedy, who has final
authority over the matter.
