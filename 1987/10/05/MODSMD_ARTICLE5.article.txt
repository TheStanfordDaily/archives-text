# Stolen Cal bear issues 'demands'
## 
### Mark Rogowsky Editorial staff 
Oski the Bear, UC-Berkeley's
missing 7-foot-tall mascot, has
resurfaced after more than a
year's absence.
Missing since his kidnapping
from a glass case in the Cal stu
dent union Aug. 3, 1986, "Oski"
sent a letter last week to student
groups here and at Cal.
The letter, purportedly written
by Oski himself, details the
quarter-ton stuffed bear's experi
ences during the past year and
outlines conditions for his return
to Berkeley.
In the letter, "Oski" claims to
have toured the United States
and done "quite a bit of drink
ing" in the past year. According
to the letter, the bear has "had
much more fun that I ever did in
that glass case at Berkeley."
How the kidnappers managed

to spirit Oski out of the locked
and prominently displayed
showcase remains a mystery.
"That's teriffic," 1 said Univer
sity President Donald Kennedy.
"I've always appreciated the
devotion of Stanford students to
public service. I regard it as an
act of kindness that they would
take it upon themselves to show
a bear such a wonderful time."
Accompanying the letter was a
photo of the bear in a Stanford T
shirt. Junior Tom Smegal, chair
man of the Stanford Axe Com
mittee, said he is "fairly certain"
that the photo is of Oski.
Jon Erickson, University bur
sar and faculty adviser to the Axe
Committee said, "My gut feeling
is that it's for real. It's going to
be interesting to see how Cal
responds. I don't think that
they'll respond to the demands."
Berkeley junior Dave Hassen
zahl concurred. "There's no rea
son to believe that it (the letter) is
legitimate."
The letter demands a docu
ment be drawn up promising that
no punitive legal action will be
taken against Oski's kidnappers.
As a precondition to Oski's
return, the letter demands further
that several prominent people
sign the letter, including Califor
nia Governor George Deuk
mejian, Sammy Davis Jr. and the
president of Round Table Pizza.

Brian Smith, another Cal
junior, said he believed Oski's
"demands were made under
duress. He's been induced to
make such ridiculous requests."
Hassenzahl called the
demands "silly" and predicted
no action would be taken until
more tangible evidence is
produced.
Smith was even more
adamant. "We shall not bow to
such terrorism." He also
promised that Oski's captors will
be dealt with harshly. "You can
run, but you can't hide," he said.
At Stanford, meanwhile, plans
are being made should the letter
prove to be genuine. "I'd like to

see it (the bear) come out at Big
Game," Smegal said.
"It would be great at the
Bonfire," added Rob Eno, asso
ciate chairman of the Axe Com
mittee.
Smegal said the Axe Commit
tee would be happy to serve as
mediators between Oski's cap
tors and UC-Berkeley.
Stanford Police Chief Marvin
Herrington was glad he finally
had some "fresh tracks" on an
otherwise cold trail. "We've
worked tirelessly on one case for
many months. Finally we have
bear tracks. An appropriate num
ber of officers will follow up," he
said.
