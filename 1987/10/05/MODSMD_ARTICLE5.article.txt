# Stolen Cal bear issues 'demands'
## 
### Mark Rogowsky Editorial staff 
Oski the Bear, UC-Berkeley's
missing 7-foot-tall mascot, has
resurfaced after more than a
year's absence.
Missing since his kidnapping
from a glass case in the Cal stu
dent union Aug. 3, 1986, "Oski"
sent a letter last week to student
groups here and at Cal.
The letter, purportedly written
by Oski himself, details the
quarter-ton stuffed bear's experi
ences during the past year and
outlines conditions for his return
to Berkeley.
In the letter, "Oski" claims to
have toured the United States
and done "quite a bit of drink
ing" in the past year. According
to the letter, the bear has "had
much more fun that I ever did in
that glass case at Berkeley."
How the kidnappers managed

to spirit Oski out of the locked
and prominently displayed
showcase remains a mystery.
"That's teriffic," 1 said Univer
sity President Donald Kennedy.
"I've always appreciated the
devotion of Stanford students to
public service. I regard it as an
act of kindness that they would
take it upon themselves to show
a bear such a wonderful time."
Accompanying the letter was a
photo of the bear in a Stanford T
shirt. Junior Tom Smegal, chair
man of the Stanford Axe Com
mittee, said he is "fairly certain"
that the photo is of Oski.
Jon Erickson, University bur
sar and faculty adviser to the Axe
Committee said, "My gut feeling
is that it's for real. It's going to
be interesting to see how Cal
responds. I don't think that
they'll respond to the demands."
