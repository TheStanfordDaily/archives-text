## 
### Bruce LeDesma 
Expecting an increase in
campus political activity this
year. University officials
reminded student political groups
Friday of rules limiting their use
of Stanford's name, resources
and facilities.
University Registrar Sally
Mahoney reaffirmed Stanford's'
guidelines governing these mat
ters at a noon meeting with
several campus political organi
zations in Tresidder Union.
Emphasizing the need to dis
tinguish Stanford policy from the
opinions of campus political
groups. Mahoney told students
that the University does not take
political stands on particular is
sues."Stanford University has
no (official) opinion," she said.
According to the guidelines,
which were established in the
early 19705, campus groups may
not use Stanford's name or seal
on written material intended for
political purposes, and may not
list University telephone num
bers or offices as sources for po
litical information.
In addition, campus groups
may not use Stanford duplicating
machines, computers or
telephones for political purposes,
nor may they request the
services of University employees
for tasks related to such activi
ties.
While Mahoney encouraged
students to become politically in
volved, she stressed the neces
sity of the guidelines governing
their activities.
"They are merely intended to
make clear that the University is
not involved, that the Univer

sity s resources are not in
volved," she said.
Although most student repre
sentatives at the meeting did not
dispute Stanford's need to disas
sociate itself from the opinions of
campus groups, at least one stu
dent said the regulations were
too restrictive.
"I think they're too
restrictive," said Senior Mark
Lemley, who has been actively
involved in many political organi
zations at Stanford.
"There is enough political
apathy on campus that, while I
recognize the reasoning behind
the guidelines, it seems a shame
that (the University is) making it
more difficult for people to get in
volved," he said.
Lemley added that the rules —
which prohibit the use of ASSU
funds to support activities such
as precinct walking, canvassing
districts and phone calling — is
olate Stanford from the sur

rounding community.
"(These) are activities political
groups here do a lot," he said.
"We want to have an impact
broader than just the people who
are living on the Stanford
campus."
Michael Ramsey-Perez, direc
tor of Student Organizational
Services (SOS), disagreed.
"I have never seen political
apathy on this campus," he said,
noting that he has been with SOS
since 1982. "Nothing stops polit
ical activity from happening
here."
He also disputed Lemley's
claim that the guidelines isolate
Stanford. "There are a number
of community people working in
timately with many campus
groups on issues which concern
them," he said, citing as an ex
ample Jesse Jackson's work with
the campus-based Rainbow
Agenda last spring.
