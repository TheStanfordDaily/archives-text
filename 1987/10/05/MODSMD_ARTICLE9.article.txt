New leader emerges in Mexico
MEXICO CITY — Mexico's ruling party yesterday named
career bureaucrat Carlos Salinas de Gortari, architect of the
country's austere economic policies, as its candidate for presi
dent.
His nomination by the Institutional Revolutionary Party,
which has dominated Mexican politics for 58 years, assures for
all practical purposes that Salinas, 39, will be this nation's new
president after elections next year. Salinas is budget and plan
ning secretary in the outgoing government of President Miguel
de la Madrid. He is better known for his intellect than his
charisma. Salinas holds three postgraduate degrees from Har
vard University and has spent his professional career in govern
ment ministries.
As such, Salinas is one of a breed of so-called technocrats
who have come to dominate Mexico's governing politics for the
past 25 years. He is the fourth consecutive presidential candi
date of the PRI, as the ruling party is universally called here for
its Spanish initials, never to have served in elected office before
taking on the campaign for the highest post.
"Emotion-filled, I accept the decision of the party," Salinas
said during a half-hour acceptance speech. "1 accept it because
I feel passionately committed to Mexico and its destiny."
The PRI is Mexico's largest political party, a cohesive organi
zation that embraces citizens from every walk of life and from
across nearly the entire political spectrum, left to right. It con
trols electoral machinery nationwide, and as its candidate,
Salinas is the sure winner in the presidential vote set for July
1988.
Duarte meets with rebel leaders
SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador— Surrounded by heavy se
curity and competing demonstrations. President Jose Napoleon
Duarte and leaders of the leftist guerrillas who are fighting his
government met in the capital yesterday for their first peace
talks in nearly three years.
The closed-door meeting began five hours late due to logisti
cal problems in the guerrillas' arrival, which the rebels blamed
on the Salvadoran army and the government blamed on the
rebels. The talks continued late into the night.
Opening the session. Bishop Francesco de Nittis urged the
warring factions to be "artisans of peace" and to "respond with
deeds to the hopes of the suffering Salvadoran people." De Nit
tis hosted the talks at his residence in the hilly, tree-lined Es
calon neighborhood, where San Salvador's elite live behind high
brick walls.
The talks were being held in the formal dining room of the
Bishop's residence. The two sides sat at an elongated,
hardwood table beneath a portrait of the Virgin Mary. Arch
bishop of San Salvador Arturo Rivera y Damas mediated, aided
by Bishop Gregorio Rosa Chavez.
Reagan will not give up oil Bork
WASHINGTON — President Reagan will not withdraw the
embattled Supreme Court nomination of Robert Bork even if the
Senate Judiciary Committee votes against the nominee, a
leading pro-Bork senator said yesterday.
But Reagan's prospects for victory appear grim: 50 senators
— one fewer than necessary to defeat the nomination — are now
either leaning against Bork or already publicly committed to
vote no, according to leading independent and anti-Bork vote
counters. The pro-Bork vote — leaning and committed — is just
under 40, the counts indicate.
In the event of a 50-50 tie in the Senate, Vice President George
Bush would cast the deciding vote in Bork's favor.
Fewer than a dozen senators remain undecided on the nomi
nation, and Reagan will now have to win all of them or else turn
around votes that now seem to be heading against him, if Bork is
to become a high court justice.
Reagan will try over the next two weeks to accomplish that.
"You'll see something every day," White House spokesman
Marlin Fitzwater said as the president returned yesterday to
Washington after a weekend at Camp David, Md.
Fitzwater said the administration has scheduled a full week of
activities to keep the nomination battle at the top of Reagan's
agenda. Among those events will be personal calls to senators
urging them to support Bork and speeches designed to rally sup
port for the nominee.
Fighting still rough in Nicaragua
LA PINUELA, Nicaragua — A peace agreement signed two
months ago has produced no letup in the fighting in Nicaragua.
The Sandinista army and U.S.-backed Nicaraguan contras are
waging intense combat north of La Pinuela and elsewhere along
the country's mountainous central spine. Western military
analysts say each side is maneuvering for advantage before the
Nov. 7 cease-fire deadline set by the plan.
Prospects for peace on that date have been dimmed by the
Sandinista government's insistence on setting cease-fire condi
tions unilaterally and by the rebel leaders' refusal to abide by
any terms that are not negotiated.
In signing the Aug. 7 peace accord with four other Central
American nations, Nicaragua agreed to restore full press and
political freedoms as the price of a cutoff of U.S. and other
outside aid to the Contras.
Last week, the Sandinistas began to comply. The opposition
newspaper La Prensa and the Roman Catholic radio station,
both shut by decree last year, were allowed to reopen, and a
wartime state of emergency was eased to let unarmed opposi
tion groups march in the streets.
Carter sees spirit of "'76 in 1988
PLAINS, Ga. — Former President Carter, criticizing both the
Reagan administration and some Democrats, said yesterday that
recent events have made the 1988 presidential race similar to the
one he won in 1976 because voters will reward candor.
"I think the American people will be looking for someone
who will tell the truth and be competent and compassionate,"
Carter said. "There is a lot of similarity between what has oc
curred this time and in 1976."
In that campaign, which followed the Watergate scandal.
Carter promised voters,"I will never lie to you" and went from
relative obscurity to the White House.
Although he rarely criticizes President Reagan, the man who
replaced him in the White House, Carter took the opportunity to
do so yesterday, saying: "I think everyone in the 1988 presiden
tial campaigns has to realize that the American people are fed up
with constant misstatements of fact that have been coming from
the White House for the past six years."
Carter made his comments after meeting with Illinois Sen.
Paul Simon, who is campaigning in the South for the Democratic
nomination.
The former president said he did not think the Democrats suf
fered long-term damage from the embarrassing withdrawals of
Gary Hart and Sen. Joseph Biden Jr. and the controversy that
forced Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis' campaign
manager to quit after he gave reporters a videotape demonstrat
ing plagiarism by Biden.

New leader emerges in Mexico
MEXICO CITY — Mexico's ruling party yesterday named
career bureaucrat Carlos Salinas de Gortari, architect of the
country's austere economic policies, as its candidate for presi
dent.
His nomination by the Institutional Revolutionary Party,
which has dominated Mexican politics for 58 years, assures for
all practical purposes that Salinas, 39, will be this nation's new
president after elections next year. Salinas is budget and plan
ning secretary in the outgoing government of President Miguel
de la Madrid. He is better known for his intellect than his
charisma. Salinas holds three postgraduate degrees from Har
vard University and has spent his professional career in govern
ment ministries.
As such, Salinas is one of a breed of so-called technocrats
who have come to dominate Mexico's governing politics for the
past 25 years. He is the fourth consecutive presidential candi
date of the PRI, as the ruling party is universally called here for
its Spanish initials, never to have served in elected office before
taking on the campaign for the highest post.
"Emotion-filled, I accept the decision of the party," Salinas
said during a half-hour acceptance speech. "1 accept it because
I feel passionately committed to Mexico and its destiny."
The PRI is Mexico's largest political party, a cohesive organi
zation that embraces citizens from every walk of life and from
across nearly the entire political spectrum, left to right. It con
trols electoral machinery nationwide, and as its candidate,
Salinas is the sure winner in the presidential vote set for July
1988.
Duarte meets with rebel leaders
SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador— Surrounded by heavy se
curity and competing demonstrations. President Jose Napoleon
Duarte and leaders of the leftist guerrillas who are fighting his
government met in the capital yesterday for their first peace
talks in nearly three years.
The closed-door meeting began five hours late due to logisti
cal problems in the guerrillas' arrival, which the rebels blamed
on the Salvadoran army and the government blamed on the
rebels. The talks continued late into the night.
Opening the session. Bishop Francesco de Nittis urged the
warring factions to be "artisans of peace" and to "respond with
deeds to the hopes of the suffering Salvadoran people." De Nit
tis hosted the talks at his residence in the hilly, tree-lined Es
calon neighborhood, where San Salvador's elite live behind high
brick walls.
The talks were being held in the formal dining room of the
Bishop's residence. The two sides sat at an elongated,
hardwood table beneath a portrait of the Virgin Mary. Arch
bishop of San Salvador Arturo Rivera y Damas mediated, aided
by Bishop Gregorio Rosa Chavez.
Reagan will not give up oil Bork
WASHINGTON — President Reagan will not withdraw the
embattled Supreme Court nomination of Robert Bork even if the
Senate Judiciary Committee votes against the nominee, a
leading pro-Bork senator said yesterday.
But Reagan's prospects for victory appear grim: 50 senators
— one fewer than necessary to defeat the nomination — are now
either leaning against Bork or already publicly committed to
vote no, according to leading independent and anti-Bork vote
counters. The pro-Bork vote — leaning and committed — is just
under 40, the counts indicate.
In the event of a 50-50 tie in the Senate, Vice President George
Bush would cast the deciding vote in Bork's favor.
Fewer than a dozen senators remain undecided on the nomi
nation, and Reagan will now have to win all of them or else turn
around votes that now seem to be heading against him, if Bork is
to become a high court justice.
Reagan will try over the next two weeks to accomplish that.
"You'll see something every day," White House spokesman
Marlin Fitzwater said as the president returned yesterday to
Washington after a weekend at Camp David, Md.
Fitzwater said the administration has scheduled a full week of
activities to keep the nomination battle at the top of Reagan's
agenda. Among those events will be personal calls to senators
urging them to support Bork and speeches designed to rally sup
port for the nominee.
Fighting still rough in Nicaragua
LA PINUELA, Nicaragua — A peace agreement signed two
months ago has produced no letup in the fighting in Nicaragua.
The Sandinista army and U.S.-backed Nicaraguan contras are
waging intense combat north of La Pinuela and elsewhere along
the country's mountainous central spine. Western military
analysts say each side is maneuvering for advantage before the
Nov. 7 cease-fire deadline set by the plan.
Prospects for peace on that date have been dimmed by the
Sandinista government's insistence on setting cease-fire condi
tions unilaterally and by the rebel leaders' refusal to abide by
any terms that are not negotiated.
In signing the Aug. 7 peace accord with four other Central
American nations, Nicaragua agreed to restore full press and
political freedoms as the price of a cutoff of U.S. and other
outside aid to the Contras.
Last week, the Sandinistas began to comply. The opposition
newspaper La Prensa and the Roman Catholic radio station,
both shut by decree last year, were allowed to reopen, and a
wartime state of emergency was eased to let unarmed opposi
tion groups march in the streets.
Carter sees spirit of "'76 in 1988
PLAINS, Ga. — Former President Carter, criticizing both the
Reagan administration and some Democrats, said yesterday that
recent events have made the 1988 presidential race similar to the
one he won in 1976 because voters will reward candor.
"I think the American people will be looking for someone
who will tell the truth and be competent and compassionate,"
Carter said. "There is a lot of similarity between what has oc
curred this time and in 1976."
In that campaign, which followed the Watergate scandal.
Carter promised voters,"I will never lie to you" and went from
relative obscurity to the White House.
Although he rarely criticizes President Reagan, the man who
replaced him in the White House, Carter took the opportunity to
do so yesterday, saying: "I think everyone in the 1988 presiden
tial campaigns has to realize that the American people are fed up
with constant misstatements of fact that have been coming from
the White House for the past six years."
Carter made his comments after meeting with Illinois Sen.
Paul Simon, who is campaigning in the South for the Democratic
nomination.
The former president said he did not think the Democrats suf
fered long-term damage from the embarrassing withdrawals of
Gary Hart and Sen. Joseph Biden Jr. and the controversy that
forced Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis' campaign
manager to quit after he gave reporters a videotape demonstrat
ing plagiarism by Biden.
