# Alcohol decision delayed
## 
### Mark Lawrence Senior staff writer 
University administrators
agreed yesterday to hold another
meeting sometime within the
next two weeks to decide
whether alcohol will be allowed
in Stanford Stadium during foot
ball games.
Dean of Student Affairs James
Lyons said the move to delay a
firm decision on the stadium al
cohol policy should not be
viewed as an indication that Uni
versity officials were not pleased
with student behavior at Satur
day's Stanford-UCLA game.
"I don't think this means that
we were dissatisfied with what
took place," Lyons said. "I
thought the behavior of students
was quite good."
Lyons said he. Athletic Direc
tor Andy Geiger and Stanford
Police Chief Marvin Herrington
plan to discuss the policy. Al
though no date has yet been set
for the meeting, Lyons and
Geiger said they expected a deci
sion would be made before Stan
ford's next home game Oct. 24.
Geiger said he will also hold
meetings in the next two weeks
with student leaders, beginning
with the Council of Presidents
today, in an effort to incorporate
their opinions into the decision
making process.
"We all need to listen to each
other before we snap to a quick
decision," Geiger said. "There
are a lot of people with strong
feelings on both sides of the issue
who deserve a fair hearing."
Another element in the discus
sion of the stadium alcohol policy
will be a meeting Monday of the
University Committee on Athle
tics, Physical Education and
Recreation. Geiger said the com
mittee will also examine the
policy and possibly make a rec
ommendation to University Pres
ident Donald Kennedy.
The committee, after a lengthy
review of the policy last spring,
recommended that Stanford con
tinue on a probationary basis its
longstanding policy of allowing
alcohol in the stadium.
Following the Sept. 26 game,
which was marred by several
alcohol-related incidents in the
student section and the possibly
alcohol-related death of a San
Jose man, Geiger said the UCLA
game represented a "last
chance" for students to show
that they could drink responsibly
in the stands.
Geiger said yesterday he was
"disappointed" that the Univer
sity has been forced to take a
leading role in deciding stadium
alcohol policy.
